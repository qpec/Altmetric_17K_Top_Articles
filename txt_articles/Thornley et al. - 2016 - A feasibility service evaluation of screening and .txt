Objectives: The UK 5 year antimicrobial resistance strategy recognizes the role of point-of-care diagnostics
to identify where antimicrobials are required, as well as to assess the appropriateness of the diagnosis and
treatment. A sore throat test-and-treat service was introduced in 35 community pharmacies across two localities
in England during 2014–15.
Methods: Trained pharmacy staff assessed patients presenting with a sore throat using the Centor scoring system
and patients meeting three or all four of the criteria were offered a throat swab test for Streptococcus pyogenes,
Lancefield group A streptococci. Patients with a positive throat swab test were offered antibiotic treatment.
Results: Following screening by pharmacy staff, 149/367 (40.6%) patients were eligible for throat swab testing. Of
these, only 36/149 (24.2%) were positive for group A streptococci. Antibiotics were supplied to 9.8% (n¼36/367) of
all patients accessing the service. Just under half of patients that were not showing signs of a bacterial infection
(60/123, 48.8%) would have gone to their general practitioner if the service had not been available.
Conclusions: This study has shown that it is feasible to deliver a community-pharmacy-based screening and treat-
ment service using point-of-care testing. This type of service has the potential to support the antimicrobial resist-
ance agenda by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and inappropriate antibiotic consumption.
Introduction
Patients with sore throat symptoms commonly visit their general
practitioner (GP), but in most cases the cause is a virus and only
symptomatic treatment is needed.1 Infection with group A
streptococci can cause severe disease and late complications
such as scarlet fever or rarely rheumatic fever and acute glomer-
ulonephritis. Whilst a recent study found that serious septic com-
plications were rare events, antibiotic treatment was associated
with fewer complications.2 With the emergence of multiresistant
pathogens and a limited supply of new antibiotics, antimicrobial
stewardship has become central to strategies adopted by the
Chief Medical Officer and The National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK.3,4 Point-of-care testing (POCT)
has been recognized as a means to confirm the need for appropri-
ate antimicrobial treatment in respiratory illness.3,5 Faced with a
distressed patient and the potential sequelae of bacterial pharyn-
gitis, GPs may feel pressured to prescribe antibiotics, despite
guidance to avoid or delay antibiotic use.5,6 Research by the
Wellcome Trust showed that patients associate antibiotics
with having ‘a real illness’ and ‘proof that they are ill’.7 They also
found evidence that patients look up symptoms beforehand so
that they know what to say to their GP to obtain antibiotics.
Both current NICE guidance and the UK Department of Health
5 year strategy aim to delay the development of antimicrobial
resistance by targeting antibiotics to those patients in need.3,4
In a study of treatment of acute pharyngitis in 537 GP practices
in England, antibiotics were prescribed in 62% of cases, despite
usually being caused by viral infection, but with a wide variation
between practices (45%–78%).1 In the Capibus Ipsos MORI sur-
vey in the UK, 58% of 1767 participants reported a respiratory
infection in the last 6 months. A fifth had contacted the GP and
53% of them expected to receive antibiotics.8 Another 6%
asked a pharmacist for advice. Of the 26% who asked a GP
or nurse for antibiotics for any reason in the past year, 97%
had been given them. To guide GPs in their choice of antibiotics
and to limit unnecessary use, the TARGET (Treat Antibiotics
Responsibly, Guidance, Education, Tools) antibiotics toolkit has
been introduced.9
A 2007 study looking at GP practice data estimated that
1.2 million GP consultations were for sore throats.10 A more

 up-to-date study has found that an average GP with a patient
list of 2000 people will see around 120 patients each year for
acute pharyngitis.11 The Centor scoring system is designed to
pick out those patients at higher risk of infection due to group A
Streptococcus pyogenes and guidelines suggest this group (with
a Centor score of 3 or 4) could be offered rapid antigen detection
testing (RADT) to confirm presence of the organism. In this way
antibiotic use could be minimized.5 Community pharmacists are
well placed to help patients to manage their symptoms and to
signpost the public for further investigation if there are signs of
more complex infection. Sore throat ‘test-and-treat’ services are
delivered in some pharmacies in the USA and can avoid unneces-
sary antibiotic use.12–14 A pilot service was introduced to test the
feasibility and benefit of a service run from community pharma-
cies incorporating RADT for patients 12 years and over presenting
with sore throat symptoms according to Centor criteria.
Patients and methods
A sore throat test-and-treat service was introduced in 20 community
pharmacies across central London from October 2014 and 15 pharmacies
across Leicestershire from January 2015. The sites were chosen to allow
evaluation of the service in a variety of locations, socioeconomic groups
and types of pharmacy.
The service was developed with advice and input from a clinical advis-
ory board comprising doctors, pharmacists and a consultant microbiolo-
gist. Trained pharmacy staff assessed the patient’s presenting condition
using the Centor scoring system.15 This is a four-point validated method
that helps to identify the likelihood of bacterial infection in adults with a
sore throat. Patients who had a history of fever and/or absence of cough
were referred to the pharmacist to complete the second part of the Centor
scoring system, i.e. examination of the tonsils for exudate and palpation of
the neck for tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.
Patients meeting three or all four of the Centor criteria were offered a
throat swab test. The pharmacist would take a throat swab and test for
group A streptococci using the OSOMw Strep A Test (manufactured by
Sekisui Diagnostics UK Ltd, Maidstone, UK). The OSOMw Strep ATest detects
either viable or non-viable organisms directly from a throat swab, provid-
ing results within 5 min (96% sensitivity; 98% specificity).
Antibiotic treatment was discussed with the patient if their Centor
score was 3 or 4 and they had a positive throat swab test for group A
streptococci. Penicillin V was used as first-choice treatment at a dose of
two 250 mg tablets every 6 h for 10 days. If patients were allergic or unable
to take penicillin tablets, one clarithromycin 250 mg tablet twice a day for
5 days was used (in line with prescribing guidelines). Antibiotics were sup-
plied by the pharmacist under the authority of a Patient Group Direction
(PGD). Throughout the service, all patients were given general written and
verbal advice about managing their condition, including products to help
with symptomatic relief as necessary (including TARGET principles).9
Patient examination and testing took place within a private consult-
ation room in the pharmacy. Patients paid £7.50 for the test and a further
£10 if antibiotic supply was required. The fees were calculated based on
the cost of materials and staff resource to deliver the service and an esti-
mation of the number likely to progress through each stage of the service.
Patients with atypical symptoms or a severe presentation (unilateral or
chronic symptoms, signs of sepsis or recent antibiotics) were referred by
the pharmacist to their GP for review. Those who had symptoms for
more than 10 days, were under 12 years of age or were pregnant or breast
feeding were excluded from the service. Those whose symptoms were
improving or had already taken antibiotics or were immunocompromised
or showing signs or symptoms that would indicate any other infection or
more serious disease were also excluded. Patients with history of reaction
to the antibiotics offered via the PGD were excluded.
Across the 35 pharmacies, 98 pharmacists completed a training pack-
age that included a face-to-face session on the pathophysiology of viral
and bacterial throat infections, clinical examination and assessment of
throats, warning signs requiring referral, swabbing technique and method
for the near-patient Streptococcus A test itself. All pharmacists were also
encouraged to register as Antibiotic Guardians.16 GPs located near the
pilot pharmacies were made aware of the service and were able to refer
patients to the pharmacy if appropriate. Patients were also made aware
of the service through posters and leaflets displayed within the pharmacy
and by discussion with the pharmacy staff.
Data from the consultations were collected through Boots UK pharma-
cies from launch of the service (London, October 2014; Leicestershire,
January 2015) up to 2 May 2015. Boots UK is a member of Walgreens
Boots Alliance, with headquarters in Nottingham. Anonymized copies
of the standard data recorded were sent to the Boots UK head office for
electronic input and analysis using Microsoft Excel 2007. Deprivation pro-
files were calculated using the Carstairs index.17 This is used to calculate
deprivation quintiles for the least and most deprived and is based on four
census indicators: low social class, lack of car ownership, overcrowding
and male unemployment. A negative value indicates areas of low depriv-
ation and a positive value equates to high deprivation. Savings to the NHS
were calculated using Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU)
reference costs.18
Ethics
The anonymized data were collected as part of a pre-planned service audit
and therefore no ethics approval was necessary.
Results
Data were analysed for 367 patients from 35 community pharma-
cies in London (278 patients across 20 pharmacies, range 2–62) and
Leicestershire (89 patients across 15 pharmacies, range 1–13)
(Figure 1). Data were collected from October 2014 to April 2015
from pharmacies in London (7 months) and January 2015 to April
2015 (4 months) from pharmacies across Leicestershire. These
data represent 78.0% of patients that received the service during
this time period [missing data were due to non-returns of
Customer Record Forms (CRFs)].
Of all 367 patients who had the initial discussions with
the healthcare assistant and for whom data are available, 149
(40.6%) were eligible for throat swab testing. Of these 149
patients, 113 (75.8%) tested negative and 36 (24.2%) were
positive for group A streptococci. Antibiotics were supplied to all
patients who tested positive (36/367, 9.8%) (Table 1).
Data on age were available for 356/367 (97.0%) patients
(Figure 2). Over two-thirds (251/356, 70.5%) of patients accessing
the service were aged between 16 and 44 years.
A higher proportion of women accessed the service (221/354,
62.4%) than men (133/354, 37.6%). The gender distribution
across the various age bands was similar (Table 2). There were
more men in the 35–44 year group than women.
For the Carstairs analysis, data (n¼339) were analysed
separately based on whether patients paid for the service (throat
test+PGD) or not (Centor assessment only). Figure 3 shows the
detailed breakdown and how the profile compares with custo-
mers accessing those pharmacies for general healthcare queries
and medicines. Patients from the least deprived areas (Carstairs
24 to 21) represented over half (76/137, 55.5%) of patients
paying for the service and 75/202 (37.1%) of patients accessing
the non-payment component. Of those paying for the service in

 the least deprived areas, 22/76 (28.9%) were aged between
16 and 25 years.
Staff recorded 1720 occasions when patients enquired about
the service, but did not progress (due to ineligibility or standard
pharmacy care received). This was split by weekday (Monday to
Friday) and weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and then compared
with the time profile of when patients accessed the service, as
recorded on the CRF. The results were then calculated as rate per
hour based on the opening hours of the pharmacies (Figure 4).
There were more enquiries (patients not meeting the eligibility
criteria or choosing not to have the service) than test and treat-
ments delivered at the start (7 am to 9 am) and the end of the
day (7 pm to 12 am) during both the weekdays and the weekends.
The peak times of service delivery were between the hours of
11 am and 5 pm, when 60/76 (78.9%) of services were delivered
at the weekend and 176/272 (64.7%) during the week.
Data were available for 356 out of 367 patients (97.0%)
on method of referral into the service. Over half of patients
(200/356, 56.2%) self-referred into the service, 163/356 (45.8%)
were recommended to the service by a member of the pharmacy
they were visiting, 13/356 (3.7%) were recommended by friends
or family and 5/356 (1.4%) were signposted to the service by a
GP (patients could choose multiple responses).
Data were available for 99.2% of patients (364/367) on dur-
ation of symptoms. Two-thirds of patients (235/364, 64.6%)
waited 72 h or more before presenting at the pharmacy. For
patients with symptoms of a possible bacterial infection (Centor
score 3 or 4), but who tested negative, 87/112 (77.7%) waited
72 h or more. For swab-positive infections, over half (21/36,
58.3%) of patients presented within 48 h from the onset of
symptoms. Most positive throat tests were identified where symp-
toms appeared within 24 h (13/36, 36.1%).
There were 56 patients (15.3% of 367) who were referred to
their GP. The primary reasons were patients displaying unilateral
symptoms (18/56, 32.1%), difficulty swallowing saliva (13/56,
23.2%), symptoms of a more serious infection (12/56, 21.4%)
and significant voice change (12/56, 21.4%) (Figure 5). Patients
could have multiple reasons for referral.
Data were only available for 60.5% (222/367) patients on their
course of action had they not accessed the service at the pharmacy
(Table 3). Those not receiving antibiotic treatment were less likely to
complete the questionnaire (57.1%, 189/331 compared with
91.7%, 33/36 who received antibiotics). Most would have self-
treated (44.1%, 98/222) or consulted a GP (43.7%, 97/222).
About half of the patients (48.8%, 60/123) that were not showing
signs of a bacterial infection (Centor score 1 or 2) would have gone
to the GP if the service had not been available. Of those 97 patients
who would have seen a GP, 37/97 (38.1%) had a throat test, of
which 22/37 (59.5%) were negative. The overall positivity rate for
which antibiotics were provided was 15.5% (15/97) in this subgroup
of patients. Less than one-third of these patients (32.0%, 31/97)
were referred to the GP following the service based on their present-
ing symptoms as described in Figure 5.
Possible savings to the NHS in GP consultations avoided were
calculated to be £2747. This was based on the difference between
the number of patients that would have seen the GP if the service
had not been available (n¼97) and the number referred (n¼56)
using PSSRU at a cost of £67 per consultation.18 (These calcula-
tions do not take into account the cost of delivery of the service
within community pharmacies.)
Discussion
Data presented have shown that it is feasible to deliver a
community-pharmacy-based screening and treatment service
for sore throats using POCT. This type of service has the potential

 to support the antimicrobial resistance agenda by reducing
unnecessary antibiotic use and inappropriate consumption.
Study limitations
Data reported were part of a service evaluation that was
conducted in 35 community pharmacies over a period of
4–7 months, presenting limitations to the methodology and
results. The sample size is small (due to the service not being
widely advertised) and the study was performed during the win-
ter months, so cannot be extrapolated over a full year. Whilst chil-
dren average two to three times more respiratory infections per
year compared with adults,5 the service was aimed at patients
12 years and over. This was due to the practicalities of carrying
out examinations with younger children within the pharmacy
environment and the (lack of) experience of the pharmacy staff.
Whilst we asked patients what they would have done if they had
not accessed the service (to establish the number that would have
accessed their GP), this provides an indication only. Estimates of
those that would have been likely to have been prescribed antibio-
tics if they had seen their GPare based on other literature findings. A
more accurate measure would have been to compare both of these
elements with a control group. We also had no follow-up informa-
tion for patients, so do not know whether those that were referred
actually consulted their GP or not, or whether they had any compli-
cations. The test used detected Streptococcus group A, but did not
pick up any other pathogens that may have caused similar symp-
toms. Missing data from the CRF also resulted in different sample
sizes being used for the analysis.
Findings
Increasing antimicrobial resistance and lack of new agents to treat
infections is one of the main health concerns of governments, the

 WHO and the general public alike.3,4,19 Increasing involvement of
community pharmacies in primary care treatment of patients has
been developing over the last 10 years, principally with a view to
improving patient access and choice, as well as releasing GP
resources to deal with more complex patients.20 In this service,
however, the aim is to improve antimicrobial stewardship by
reducing antimicrobial usage and expenditure. The service was
effective in narrowing antibiotic use to ,10% of those presenting
and most of those were young adults. Men in the 35–44 year
group were heavily represented yet are the group most difficult
for primary care services to reach. Referral of patients to the GP
by the pharmacy service fulfilled a potentially important role in
managing the more complicated cases, especially those choosing
otherwise to self-treat. Patients with proven S. pyogenes infection
tended to present earlier than the rest of the population.
Patients presented from all sociodemographic areas, although
surprisingly there was a skew towards those in the least deprived
areas accessing the paid elements of the service. However,

 payment did not appear to be a barrier to patients receiving the
test and antibiotics as all patients that were eligible based on
their Centor score went on to access the paid elements regardless
of deprivation index. More patients from deprived areas accessed
the service compared with the normal profile of patients attend-
ing those pharmacies to purchase healthcare products (as shown
in Figure 3).
The reduced availability of GP services at weekends did not
appear to have had an effect on timing of the use of the service,
as despite the number of enquiries between 7 am and 9 am and
between 7 pm and 12 pm, very few patients went on to have the
service. This could have been due to the patient not being eligible,
choosing to receive standard pharmacy care (advice and/or prod-
uct) or the patient deciding to wait to see their GP.
Other methods of screening for bacterial pharyngitis in primary
care have proved effective in targeting antimicrobial chemother-
apy. Screening for S. pyogenes group A on the basis of 15 patient-
reported symptoms in retail health clinics was successful when
local prevalence of the organism was known.21 A POCT was con-
firmed with throat culture or DNA probe. For every patient with
streptococcal pharyngitis missed, 27 healthcare visits would be
saved if patients with a low score were used to determine further
action. With rapid antigen detection in another study, the likeli-
hood of GP prescription of antibiotic fell significantly (64% versus
44%) even though antibiotics were still prescribed in 31% of cases
where the rapid test was negative.22 However, in a series of 597
patients having throat swabs collected in general practice, 34%
of swabs were positive for pathogenic streptococci, but one-third
were not S. pyogenes group A.23 Group C and G streptococci were
associated with symptoms of similar severity to those of group
A. It is not known what proportion of our patients had other
groups of streptococcal infection, but all septic patients were
referred to a GP, and safety-netting was offered to all patients.
A different scoring system (feverPAIN) for sore throat has been
assessed and been shown to be as effective as group A strepto-
coccal antigen testing.24 The same study found that the use of
antigen tests according to a clinical score provided similar bene-
fits, but with no advantages over clinical score alone. The finding
in our results of more streptococcal infections among those
patients with a shorter duration of symptoms also supports the
use of the feverPAIN scale. Whilst the role of testing has been dis-
cussed and debated due to lack of published evidence,3,15,25 it
could prove useful in the community setting to support conversa-
tions with patients around when antibiotics are appropriate. UK
primary care guidelines,26 however, still recommend the Centor
scoring system for assessing sore throats and not POCT due to
the limited evidence available.3,11
There is a debate about whether a lower Centor score could be
used to trigger RADT.27 The management of sore throat in primary
care varies greatly across the world.28 Some countries, such as the
USA, France and those in Scandinavia, use RADT to guide prescrip-
tion of antibiotics for tonsillitis.29 In Scandinavia, guidelines sug-
gest using RADT in patients with two to three Centor criteria.29
In this way, antibiotics are used only in patients with symptoms
of tonsillitis, but not carriers. Patients with scores of 1 or 2 may
still access their GP for a consultation. Furthermore, GPs are
more likely to be influenced by patients’ expectations if they do
not use RADT.
Conclusions
The principal benefit of this type of service would be in saving
unnecessary antibiotic usage in potentially large numbers of com-
munity patients. The service demonstrated that two-thirds of
patients who would have seen their GP did not need to do so. If
this was extrapolated to the 1.2 million consultations that GPs
see annually for sore throats,10 then an additional 800000
patients could be potentially seen within community pharmacy.
Such a service should reduce antibiotic pressure and the emer-
gence of resistance, and further the aims of antibiotic control pro-
grammes. If the service were not available, half of the patients
would self-treat, regardless of severity, such that patients could
delay seeking medical attention when it was needed. If the ser-
vice continues in its current format, there is a risk that patients
might only access it if they have funds to pay. The impact of sup-
porting antimicrobial stewardship could be enhanced by making
the service more widely available through the National Health
Service (NHS). To understand the true impact of this service, a
comparative study would need to be undertaken with a full health
economic analysis. This concurs with NICE recommendations that
suggest that randomized controlled trials should be undertaken
to determine whether using POCT in decision making when pre-
scribing antimicrobials is clinically and cost effective.3
