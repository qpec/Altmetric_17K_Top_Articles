Abstract
Purpose: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is highly heritable
and a serious complication of cancer and its treatment. We
examined the individual and joint effects of chemotherapy and
genetic susceptibility on VTE risk in patients with breast cancer.
Experimental Design: A Swedish population-based study
including 4,261 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast
cancer between 2001 and 2008 in Stockholm, followed until
2012. Risk stratification by chemotherapy and genetic suscepti-
bility [a polygenic risk score (PRS), including nine established VTE
loci] was assessed using Kaplan–Meier and flexible parametric
survival analyses, adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment
characteristics.
Results: In total, 276 patients experienced a VTE event during a
median follow-up of 7.6 years. Patients receiving chemotherapy
[HR(95%CI)¼ 1.98;1.40–2.80]andpatientsinthehighest5%of
the PRS [HR (95% CI) ¼ 1.90; 1.24–2.91] were at increased risk of
developing VTE. Chemotherapy and PRS acted independently on
VTE risk and the 1-year cumulative incidence in patients carrying
both risk factors was 9.5% compared with 1.3% in patients not
having these risk factors (P < 0.001). Stratified analyses by age
showed that the risk-increasing effect of PRS was stronger in older
patients (P interaction ¼ 0.04), resulting in an excess risk among
genetically susceptible patients receiving chemotherapy aged � 60
years (1-year cumulative incidence ¼ 25.0%).
Conclusions: Risk stratification by chemotherapy and genetic
susceptibility identifies patients with breast cancer at high VTE
risk, who could potentially benefit from thromboprophylaxis.
Our results further suggest that genetic testing is more informative
in older patients with breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(21); 5249–55.

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious complication in
patients with breast cancer, resulting in significant morbidity,
mortality, and health-care–associated costs (1–3). The inci-
dence of VTE is relatively low in patients with breast cancer
(�1%–2%; refs. 1, 4) compared with other cancer populations
(up to �8% in pancreatic cancer; refs. 4, 5), but as one of the
most common cancers, breast cancer contributes to a large
number of cancer-associated VTE cases. Long-term conse-
quences of VTE in terms of future complications (2) and quality
of life (6) are substantial, especially for nonmetastatic patients
who have a rather good prognosis.
The incidence of VTE varies considerably among breast cancer
patients and is particularly high shortly after diagnosis during
chemotherapy treatment (5, 7–9). Routine thromboprophylaxis
is not recommended in patients receiving chemotherapy, but
expert

an

approach to identify high-risk patients who could potentially
benefit from thromboprophylactic measures (10, 11).
In addition to chemotherapy, hereditary factors strongly
contribute to VTE risk. The heritability of VTE has been esti-
mated at 50% to 60% (12, 13), and nine susceptibility loci have
been identified to date (14), of which rs6025 [called Factor V
Leiden (FVL)] is the most established, accounting for �20% of
all VTE cases (15). Measures of genetic susceptibility, including
FVL carriership (16, 17) and VTE family history (18), have been
associated with a �twofold increased risk of VTE in patients
with cancer, and several lines of evidence suggest that genetic
markers are promising candidates for further risk stratification
of high-risk patients (16–18). Few studies, however, have
evaluated the excess risk associated with genetic susceptibility
in patients treated with chemotherapy. A case–control study
(19) found an increased risk of thrombosis during chemother-
apy in patients with breast cancer carrying the FVL mutation,
whereas no risk-increasing effect of FVL was observed in a small
prospective study (20). No studies to date have examined the
collective impact of multiple genetic loci, and little is known
about potential age-dependent effects in patients with breast
cancer, although previous reports suggest a stronger impact of
FVL with advancing age (21, 22).
In the present study, we assessed the individual and joint effects
of chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility on VTE risk, overall,

Materials and Methods
Study population
For the present study, we analyzed patients from the Libro-1
study, a cohort study aimed at identifying risk and prognostic
factors for breast cancer (23, 24). The Libro-1 study comprises
women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer between
2001 and 2008 in the Stockholm-Gotland region, who were
invited for questionnaire interviews and blood sampling in
2009. All patients were identified through the Stockholm Breast
Cancer Register,which has high completeness(99%) and includes
detailed information on tumor characteristics and breast cancer
treatment (25). In total, 4,851 patients (63%) consented to
participate, of whom 4,261 donated blood. All patients were
diagnosed at age 25 to 75 years and had no distant metastases
at diagnosis. The study population was linked by the unique
personal identity number to the National Patient Register, Cause
of Death Register, Population Register and Prescribed Drug reg-
ister, and follow-up was complete until 31 December 2012. The
study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in
Stockholm (Sweden) and all participants gave written informed
consent.
Venous thromboembolism
VTE events were identified through the Swedish Patient Regis-
ter, which has nationwide coverage since 1987 and includes all
inpatient hospitalizations in Sweden (26). Since 2001, Swedish
counties are also obliged to report hospital-based outpatient
physician visits. VTE was defined according to the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD), including diagnostic codes as
described elsewhere (refs. 27, 28; Supplementary Table S1). The
validity of Swedish hospital discharge diagnoses for specific
cardiovascular disorders, including VTE, is high and has been
estimated to be around 90% (29). For sensitivity analyses, we used
additional data from the Prescribed Drug Register, which contains
data on all drugs dispensed from Swedish pharmacies from July
2005 and onward.
Chemotherapy and other covariates
Information on chemotherapy administration was obtained
from the Stockholm Breast Cancer Register. Patient characteristics,
tumor pathology, and other treatment specifics were also
extracted from this register, including age and menopausal status
at diagnosis, tumor size, histological grade, number of affected
lymph nodes, endocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and type of sur-
gery. Information on VTE and comorbid disease prior to diagnosis
was retrieved through the Swedish Patient Register. We selected all
comorbid conditions relevant to VTE (28), including chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, alcoholism and alco-
hol-related liver disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, hyperten-
sion, sepsis, varicose veins, peripheral vascular disease, and
congestive heart failure. Pre-diagnostic information on smoking,
physical activity, oral contraceptive use, and hormone replace-
ment therapy (HRT) was extracted from questionnaires. Partici-
pants were also asked to report their weight and height at study
entry, from which BMI was calculated.
VTE polygenic score
Blood-derived DNA samples were genotyped on the custom
Illumina iSelect genotyping array (iCOGS), including 211,155
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; ref. 30) with imputa-
tion to the 1000 Genomes Project March 2012 release as described
previously (31). We selected all genome-wide significant SNPs
(P � 5 � 10�8; n ¼ 9) that were identified and replicated by a
recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS;
ref. 14; Supplementary Table S2). All SNPs were imputed and
passed quality control criteria for imputation: R2 > 0.3, minor
allele frequency � 0.01, and no deviation from Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium at P < 0.05. We constructed a weighted PRS for each
patient using the following formula:
PRS ¼ b1x1 þ b2x2 þ . . . bnxn
where b is the per-allele log odds ratio (OR) for VTE associated
with the risk allele for the kth SNP (SNPk), xk is the number of
alleles for SNPk (0,1,2), and n ¼ 9 is the total number of SNPs.
Literature-based effect sizes (b) were derived from the GWAS
meta-analysis (Supplementary Table S2; ref. 14), and a log-addi-
tive model was used for PRS construction, because pairwise SNP–
SNP interaction analyses did not show evidence of departure from
this model. For comparison, we also analyzed associations with
FVL carriership separately.
Statistical analyses
We studied both individual and joint effects of chemotherapy
and genetic susceptibility on VTE risk. The impact of genetic
predisposition was analyzed using the PRS divided into percentile
groups (<p5,p5-p20,p20-p40,p40-p60,p60-p80,p80-p95,>p95).
For combined chemotherapy and genetic analyses, the PRS was
dichotomized using the 95th percentile as a cutoff.
Relative risks of VTE were analyzed using Cox proportional
hazards models and cumulative incidences were visualized using
Kaplan–Meier plots. Numbers of person-years at risk were calcu-
lated from the date of breast cancer diagnosis until the date of
first VTE event, emigration, death or end of the study period
(December 31, 2012), whichever came first. We constructed four
Translational Relevance
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious complication
in patients with breast cancer, frequently associated with
chemotherapy. Routine thromboprophylaxis, however, is not
recommended in patients treated with chemotherapy due to
the increased risk of bleeding. Because VTE is highly heritable,
genetic markers are promising candidates for the identification
of high-risk patients who could potentially benefit from
thromboprophylactic measures. In this study, we report VTE
risks by chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility in a popu-
lation-based cohort of 4,261 patients with breast cancer.
Chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility independently influ-
enced VTE risk, with a 1-year cumulative incidence of 9.5% in
patients carrying both risk factors. A statistical interaction
between genetic susceptibility and age was found, resulting
in an excess VTE risk (1-year cumulative incidence ¼ 25.0%) in
those aged 60 years and older. Our results suggest that genetic
testing may have clinical potential for VTE risk stratification in
the chemotherapy setting, particularly in older patients with
breast cancer.

(low, moderate, high), number of affected lymph nodes (0, 1–4, >
4))]; and model 4 including all patient, tumor, and treatment
characteristics [endocrine therapy (yes vs. no), radiotherapy (yes
vs. no), and type of surgery (partial vs. total mastectomy)].
Interactions on an additive scale were evaluated by com-
paring joint and individual effects, and multiplicative inter-
actions were tested by adding a product term to the model.
The proportional hazards assumption was verified using tests
for Schoenfeld residuals and in case of nonproportionality,
time-dependent effects were modelled using flexible paramet-
ric survival models (FPM; ref. 32), as described in detail
elsewhere (25).
We conducted four sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of
our findings. First, we addressed potential misclassification of the
outcome by re-analyzing all associations in patients diagnosed
after July 2005 with available prescription data. To increase
specificity of the outcome, we only included VTE diagnoses
followed by a prescription of vitamin K antagonists (ATC ¼
B01AA) or heparins (ATC ¼ B01AB) within 90 days or death
within 30 days of the VTE event. In a second sensitivity analysis,
we checked whether results were similar in patients with no VTE
history. Third, we evaluated the impact of disease recurrence
during follow-up on VTE risk. For this analysis, person-time was
additionally censored at recurrent events (defined as distant
metastasis, locoregional recurrence, and diagnosis of a second
primary cancer). Finally, due to our study design, analyses could
in theory be subject to survivorship bias, because patients had to
be alive in 2009. Although overall survival was high in the source
population (92% of all patients diagnosed between 2001 and
2008 were alive and eligible for participation in Libro-1), we
decided to carry out a third sensitivity analysis including patients
diagnosed from January 2005 onward to address a theoretically
possible bias.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the study population are summa-
rized in Table 1. Additional information on patient, tumor, and
treatment characteristics can be found in Supplementary Table S3.
Mean age at diagnosis was 58 years, and 1648 (38.7%) patients
received chemotherapy at diagnosis. In total, 276 patients expe-
rienced a VTE event during a median follow-up of 7.6 years (VTE
rate ¼ 8.6 per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI ¼ 7.0–9.7).
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the risk alleles in the
study population, stratified by incident VTE. As expected, the
distribution was shifted toward higher values in patients who
experienced a VTE event during follow-up. The weighted PRS
based on all risk alleles showed a dose–response relation with VTE
(P trend < 0.001), with patients in the highest 5% of the PRS
having a significant increase in VTE risk compared with those
in the middle PRS quintile.
Table 2 lists the HRs for VTE according to chemotherapy and
PRS, individually and combined. Overall, chemotherapy was
associated with a �twofold increased risk of VTE (HR ¼ 1.80;
95% CI ¼ 1.40–2.31). Theassociation was not materially different
in multivariable analyses adjusting for patient, tumor, and treat-
ment characteristics (HR ¼ 1.98; 95% CI ¼ 1.40–2.80). Also, no
major differences in risk were observed for different chemother-
apy agents and in stratified analyses by subsequent endocrine
therapy (Supplementary Table S4). Time-dependent analyses
showed evidence of nonproportional hazards, with the HR for
chemotherapy only being increased within the first year of diag-
nosis (Fig. 2).
Patients with a high genetic score (top 5% of PRS) had a
twofold increased risk of VTE compared with patients having
lower genetic scores (HR ¼ 1.90; 95% CI ¼ 1.24–2.91; Table
2). The joint effect of chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility
(HR ¼ 3.84; 95% CI ¼ 1.91–7.71) was not higher than
expected based on the product of the individual effects. Strat-
ified analyses by age showed that the PRS effect was stronger in
patients aged 60 years and older (HR ¼ 2.44; 95% CI ¼ 1.37–
4.35) than in those aged less than 60 years (HR ¼ 1.31; 95% CI
¼ 0.67–2.55, P interaction ¼ 0.04).
Figure 3 shows the cumulative incidence of VTE by different
strata of chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility, overall, and
stratified by age at diagnosis. The 1-year cumulative incidence was
similar for patients carrying only one of the two risk factors, i.e.,
5.0% for chemotherapy-treated patients with a low genetic score
(< top 5% of the PRS) and 4.3% for patients with a high genetic
score not receiving chemotherapy. Combined, both risk factors
resulted in a 1-year cumulative incidence of 9.5%. Stratified
analyses by age showed a stronger risk-increasing effect of the
PRS with advancing age, resulting in an excess VTE risk in older
patients carrying both risk factors (1-year cumulative incidence ¼
25.0%).

 FVL carriership was observed in 341 patients: 337 with a
heterozygous genotype and four with a homozygous genotype.
Substitution of the PRS by FVL carriership yielded similar results
in terms of relative (Supplementary Table S5) and absolute VTE
risks (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Results of sensitivity analyses are summarized in Supplemen-
tary Tables S6 and 7. Risk estimates were not materially different
in analyses using a more stringent outcome definition; the slightly
increased HRs for chemotherapy reflects the stronger risk increas-
ing effect with shorter follow-up time. Also, exclusion of patients
with a VTE history did not have a meaningful effect. Analyses with
additional censoring at recurrent events showed no difference in
VTE risk estimates, indicating that disease recurrence has no strong
effect on VTE risk in the first 5 years following diagnosis. Sensi-
tivity analyses further argue against a notable survivor bias, as
relative and absolute risk estimates were similar when restricting
the study population to more recently diagnosed cases.
Discussion
VTE is a well-known complication in patients with breast
cancer, but studies focusing on risk stratification are scarce. To
our knowledge, this is the first population-based study evaluating
individual and joint effects of chemotherapy and genetic suscep-
tibility on VTE risk by time since diagnosis. Our results confirm a

 strong independent effect of chemotherapy. The excess risk asso-
ciated with chemotherapy was further increased by genetic sus-
ceptibility, with short-term absolute risks reaching clinical signif-
icance in patients with a high genetic score, defined as the top 5%
of the PRS. Stratified analyses by age further showed that the risk-
increasing effect of the PRS was stronger in older breast cancer
patients.
The observed VTE incidence in patients treated with chemo-
therapy is comparable with previously reported chemotherapy
effects in breast and other cancer populations (7–9). Several
mechanisms have been proposed for the high thrombogenic
potential of chemotherapy, including damage to the vascular
endothelium, release of procoagulant factors after chemothera-
py-induced apoptosis and use of intravascular devices for che-
motherapy delivery (33, 34). Of note, the HR for chemotherapy
was robust and remained unchanged after adjustment for age,
lifestyle factors, comorbidities, tumor size, grade, lymph node
status, and other treatment-related markers of disease aggres-
siveness. This result is consistent with clinical trial data support-
ing a strong independent effect of chemotherapy (9, 35). In
agreement with previous reports (36, 37), the impact of che-
motherapy was only detectable shortly after diagnosis during
active treatment, making it an ideal candidate for thrombo-
prophylaxis (38). This is in contrast to endocrine therapy
for which no excess risk is seen immediately after diagnosis
(39) and therefore a less ideal target for short-term prophylaxis.
Clinical trial data show a lower VTE incidence with prophylactic
anticoagulation in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy
(40), but given the risk of bleeding, additional risk factors need
to be considered for optimal prophylaxis (10, 11, 41).
In the present study, we demonstrate that a PRS based on a log-
additive model of nine SNPs, can be used for risk stratification of
patients receiving chemotherapy. The HR for the top 5% of the
PRS was similar in magnitude to the previously reported risk
estimates for VTE family history (18) and FVL carriership (16, 17).
Because the majority of patients in the highest 5% of the PRS were
FVL carriers (93%), these results may suggest that a routinely
available test is sufficient for identifying patients at highest risk.
Indeed, relative and absolute risk estimates were similar for FVL
carriership. However, an advantage of the PRS is that risks can be
determined across a continuum allowing the identification of
low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients. Moreover, previous
reports have demonstrated increased discriminatory power with
inclusion of multiple SNPs (42, 43), and with the ongoing
discovery of novel risk loci, this approach will ultimately provide
more accurate predictions. We also found a statistical interaction
with age, suggesting the genetic impact to be stronger in older
patients with breast cancer. Although the P value for interaction
(0.04) was not strongly significant, and we cannot rule out the
possibility of an effect being missed in younger patients due
to small numbers of events, this result is consistent with the
previously observed interaction between FVL and age on VTE risk
(21, 22). Although the impact of genetic susceptibility is generally
more profound in younger individuals, stronger effects of genetic
loci with increasing age do exist, and have been reported for other
traits (44, 45). The observed interaction can be interpreted in light
of the multifactorial etiology of VTE requiring interactions
between inherited and acquired risk factors. Because the vascular
environment changes with age (i.e., increased vascular stiffness in
older individuals), a stronger genetic effect at older age is con-
sidered plausible (21, 45). Similarly, accumulation of lifestyle and
environmental exposures may trigger epigenetic mechanisms,
resulting in changes in gene expression with aging (45). Regard-
less of the mechanism involved, this finding suggests that a
patient's age is an important parameter when considering genetic
testing in patients with breast cancer, which requires evaluation in
future risk stratification efforts.
Several other factors have been proposed for the identification
of high-risk cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The Khorana
risk model including five clinical and laboratory measures (pri-
mary cancer site, pre-chemotherapy platelet count, hemoglobin
level and/or use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, leukocyte
count and BMI) is the most established one (46). This model,
however, does not incorporate genetic data and is not specific for
patients with breast cancer. In contrast to other biomarkers that
are influenced by acute inflammation, surgery, and clinical stage,
genetic factors do not require repeated measurement, as they are
fixed and independent of disease state and/or intervention. Of

 note, the short-term VTE risk in patients treated with chemother-
apy who have a high-genetic score is within the range of previously
reported risks in high-risk patients with cancer according to the
Khorana model (6.8%–17.9%; ref. 47). These absolute risks are
also comparable with risks observed in hospitalized and postop-
erative patients for whom routine prophylaxis has been shown
effective (48) and is recommended by international guidelines
(49, 50). Further studies, however, are needed to investigate the
joint effect of genetic markers and other clinical risk factors in VTE
risk prediction, and to identify specific high-risk patients in which
thromboprophylaxis is considered beneficial and safe.
The main strength of our study is the population-based design
and linkage to register-based data which minimizes information
bias. Other strengths include the detailed information on patient,
tumor, and treatment characteristics, and the use of flexible
parametric models for analyzing time-varying effects. Previous
studies evaluating risk stratification by genetic factors were either
small (20) or limited by case–control design (19), from which no
absolute risks could be inferred. Compared with older registry-
based studies (1, 4), our study further benefited from the inclu-
sion of inpatient and outpatient VTE diagnoses, with absolute risk
estimates (overall and by chemotherapy) corresponding to those
observed in a recent UK study using similar diagnostic codes (39).
There are also several methodological aspects that need to be
mentioned. First, analyses were based on registry-based VTE
diagnoses, and despite their high validity, some misclassification
may have occurred. Risk estimates were, however, not materially
different in sensitivity analyses using a more stringent definition,
and the impact of potential misclassification was further reduced
by analyzing main diagnoses only. Second, outpatient VTE diag-
noses were only registered from 2001 onward, which might have
led to an underestimation of prevalent VTE cases. Analyses
excluding patients with a VTE history yielded similar results
though. Third, participants of the Libro-1 study had to be alive
in 2009. However, overall survival is high in nonmetastatic
patients, and results were similar in sensitivity analyses including
more recently diagnosed patients. Finally, SNPs were not directly
genotyped, but imputed instead. The average information score
for imputation (0.80) was nevertheless high, and imperfectly
measured genotypes could only have resulted in attenuated
associations rather than producing spurious ones.
Collectively, our findings illustrate the potential of genetic
testing for identifying patients with breast cancer at high risk of
developing VTE following chemotherapy. Further research is
needed to test the implementation of genetic information in VTE
risk stratification of high-risk patients. Our data also suggest that
the joint effect of chemotherapy and genetic susceptibility is
particularly pronounced in older patients, an observation that
warrants clinical attention.
