IMPORTANCE Given recent advances in screening mammography and adjuvant therapy
(treatment), quantifying their separate and combined effects on US breast cancer mortality
reductions by molecular subtype could guide future decisions to reduce disease burden.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the contributions associated with screening and treatment to breast
cancer mortality reductions by molecular subtype based on estrogen-receptor (ER) and
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network
(CISNET) models simulated US breast cancer mortality from 2000 to 2012 using national
data on plain-film and digital mammography patterns and performance, dissemination and
efficacy of ER/ERBB2-specific treatment, and competing mortality. Multiple US birth cohorts
were simulated.
EXPOSURES Screening mammography and treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The models compared age-adjusted, overall, and
ER/ERBB2-specific breast cancer mortality rates from 2000 to 2012 for women aged 30 to
79 years relative to the estimated mortality rate in the absence of screening and treatment
(baseline rate); mortality reductions were apportioned to screening and treatment.
RESULTS In 2000, the estimated reduction in overall breast cancer mortality rate was 37%
(model range, 27%-42%) relative to the estimated baseline rate in 2000 of 64 deaths (model
range, 56-73) per 100 000 women: 44% (model range, 35%-60%) of this reduction was
associated with screening and 56% (model range, 40%-65%) with treatment. In 2012, the
estimated reduction in overall breast cancer mortality rate was 49% (model range,
39%-58%) relative to the estimated baseline rate in 2012 of 63 deaths (model range, 54-73)
per 100 000 women: 37% (model range, 26%-51%) of this reduction was associated with
screening and 63% (model range, 49%-74%) with treatment. Of the 63% associated with
treatment, 31% (model range, 22%-37%) was associated with chemotherapy, 27% (model
range, 18%-36%) with hormone therapy, and 4% (model range, 1%-6%) with trastuzumab.
The estimated relative contributions associated with screening vs treatment varied by
molecular subtype: for ER+/ERBB2−, 36% (model range, 24%-50%) vs 64% (model range,
50%-76%); for ER+/ERBB2+, 31% (model range, 23%-41%) vs 69% (model range, 59%-77%);
for ER−/ERBB2+, 40% (model range, 34%-47%) vs 60% (model range, 53%-66%); and for
ER−/ERBB2−, 48% (model range, 38%-57%) vs 52% (model range, 44%-62%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this simulation modeling study that projected trends in
breast cancer mortality rates among US women, decreases in overall breast cancer mortality
from 2000 to 2012 were associated with advances in screening and in adjuvant therapy,
although the associations varied by breast cancer molecular subtype.

reast cancer mortality rates have been steadily
declining over time in the United States.1 Simulation
models developed within the Cancer Intervention
and Surveillance Network (CISNET) estimated that screen-
ing mammography and adjuvant therapy (treatment) con-
tributed approximately equally to the reduction in breast
cancer mortality from 1975 to 2000.2 Since then, mammog-
raphy has transitioned from plain-film to digital technology
optimized for tumor detection.3,4 At the same time, there
have been advances in molecularly targeted treatments
based on expression of estrogen-receptor (ER) and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2, formerly HER2
or HER2/neu), including aromatase inhibitors for ER+, and
trastuzumab for ERBB2+ cancers. In addition, there have
been advances in chemotherapy, particularly increasing use
of taxanes.5,6
It is not known how screening and treatment ad-
vances have contributed to recent population-level, mo-
lecular subtype–specific breast cancer mortality rates.
No single national registry contains sufficient informa-
tion to assess this progress. Moreover, most clinical trials
do not consider both screening and treatment effects and
do not readily translate to population effect. Given these
circumstances, simulation modeling can be useful to inte-
grate high-quality data from randomized controlled
trials, large observational studies, and population registries
to estimate the relative contributions of advances on
population-level mortality.2
Inthisreport,6CISNETmodelscomparedtheseparateand
combined contribution associated with screening and treat-
ment on US breast cancer mortality rates by molecular sub-
type from 2000 to 2012.
Methods
The institutional review board at Georgetown University, the
site of the CISNET Breast Cancer Coordinating Center,
approved the study as exempt based on the use of deidenti-
fied data. The 6 CISNET models were Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (model D),7 Erasmus Medical Center (model E),8
Georgetown University-Albert Einstein College of Medicine
(model G-E),9 MD Anderson Cancer Center (model M),10
Stanford University (model S),11,12 and University of
Wisconsin-Harvard (model W-H).13 Compared with earlier
analyses2,14,15 the models portray ER/ERBB2-specific
subtypes,11 include digital screening3,4 and recent treatment
advances,16 and have updated incidence17 and competing
non–breast cancer mortality.18 The modeling approach is
summarized below; additional details are available in the
Supplement and online.19
The models incorporated updated estimates of breast
cancer incidence17 and ER/ERBB2-specific survival trends in
the absence of screening or treatment and then incorpo-
rated information on screening use and molecular subtype-
specific treatment patterns to reproduce observed US inci-
dence and mortality trends.1,20,21 Screen-detection during
the preclinical, screen-detectable period could result in
diagnosis of earlier-stage or smaller tumors than diagnosed
via symptomatic detection. This could translate into lower
breast cancer mortality. Molecular subtype-specific, age-
specific, and stage-specific treatment could reduce the
hazards of breast cancer death (models D, G-E, M, and S) or
result in cure for some cases (models E and W-H).
Model Input Parameters
Each group used a common set of inputs22 based on their
specific model structure, prior research,15 and assumptions
to best reproduce US breast cancer incidence and mortality
trends (eTable 1 in the Supplement).5,6,10-17,22-27 Five models
used age-period-cohort (APC) analyses to estimate 1975-2012
breast cancer incidence rates in the absence of screening
(baseline incidence rate)17,25; model M applied a Bayesian
approach to extend 1975-1979 Surveillance Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER) rates forward in time with a 4%
(SD, 0.2%) annual increase. Plain-film and digital mammog-
raphy sensitivity data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance
Consortium (BCSC) for 1994-2012 were used to estimate sen-
sitivity for detection of invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ
cancers by age group, first vs subsequent screening, and time
since last mammogram.
Screening dissemination was derived from national sur-
vey data for age at first screen and subsequent screening
frequency by birth cohort.23,24 Plain-film mammography
was assumed before 2000. Digital mammography was
phased-in starting in 2001 based on data from the BCSC
(unpublished data) and the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion Mammography Quality Standards Act and Program.28
Molecular subtype–specific treatment dissemination
was based on SEER patterns-of-care special studies for
1975-199626,27 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
work data for 1997 onwards.14,19 Tamoxifen was used in the
1980s; aromatase inhibitor use began in 1997; taxanes in
1998; and trastuzumab in 2006. Treatment effectiveness
was conditioned on stage and ER/ERBB2 status (and age, if
applicable) based on clinical trials; all estimates assumed
local therapy.16
Key Points
Question What are the associations of screening and adjuvant
treatment with reductions in US breast cancer mortality rates by
molecular subtype?
Findings In this study of 6 simulation models that projected US
breast cancer mortality trends for women aged 30 to 79 years,
advances in treatment, such as use of newer adjuvant therapies,
compared with screening advances were associated with greater
estimated reductions in overall breast cancer mortality from 2000
to 2012, although the associations varied by breast cancer
molecular subtype.
Meaning Simulation modeling estimated that advances in
treatment were associated with greater decreases in breast cancer
mortality rates than advances in screening, although these
associations varied by molecular subtype.

 Analyses
Each model simulated mortality rates under 4 intervention
scenarios: (1) no screening or treatment (the baseline mor-
tality rate), (2) screening alone, (3) treatment alone, and
(4) combined screening and treatment. Rates were age-
adjusted using the 2000 US Standard Population,29 and out-
comes were reported for women aged 30 to 79 years.
The absolute mortality reductions associated with
screening alone, treatment alone, or the combination in
a given calendar year were calculated as the difference be-
tween the age-adjusted mortality rates predicted with inter-
vention (scenarios 2, 3, or 4) and the baseline mortality rate
in that year (scenario 1). The percentage of mortality reduc-
tion (hereafter referred to as mortality reduction) in a given
calendar year was calculated as this difference divided by the
baseline mortality rate in that calendar year (scenario 1;
eTable 2 in the Supplement).
ER/ERBB2-specific mortality rates were computed by di-
viding the number of women who died of breast cancer with
that subtype by the total breast cancer population at risk. In
this manner, rates of all subtypes sum to the overall age-
adjusted breast cancer mortality rate.
To estimate the separate contributions associated with
screening and treatment to mortality reductions, we consid-
ered the modeled effects of screening alone and of treat-
ment alone as a fraction of the combined modeled effect in
each calendar year.
The relative contribution associated with screening vs
treatment to the combination associated with both was com-
puted as the ratio of the screening alone modeled effect to the
sum of the screening alone modeled effect and the treatment
alone modeled effect; the relative contribution associated with
treatment was calculated similarly. Alternative approaches for
computing these relative contributions were considered, and
the main conclusions were unchanged (eMethods and eTable
3 in the Supplement).
Whenconsideringthemortalityreductionsassociatedwith
each treatment intervention (eg, chemotherapy, hormonal
therapy, and trastuzumab) to their combination, the relative
contribution associated with the various treatments was de-
composed by first considering the chemotherapy contribu-
tion; then the hormonal therapy contribution for ER+ cases,
given chemotherapy contributions; and lastly, the contribu-
tion associated with trastuzumab for ERBB2+ cases, given the
other therapies.
To estimate relative contributions associated with the
most recent advancements, we compared the mortality
reduction from 2000 to 2012. We focused on this difference
to remove the modeled effect of changes in the baseline rate
during this period.
Uncertainty Analysis
All results were reported by model and summarized as the
mean and range across models. The range provided a mea-
sure of uncertainty because each model has different assump-
tions and structures to represent unobservable factors such
as baseline incidence rate and breast cancer natural history.
Results consistent across models were considered robust.
Results
Rates of mammography increased over time (Figure 1A), and
plain-film was rapidly replaced by digital mammography
starting in 2001 (Figure 1B). Treatment use varied by molecu-
lar subtype, age, and stage, with high rates of dissemination
of recent advances (Figure 1C). Incorporating these observed
screening and treatment patterns, the models reproduced
observed age-adjusted incidence (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment) and breast cancer mortality trends from 1975 to 2012
(Figure 2A). Predicted mortality trends for a representative
model (model G-E) illustrate that the mortality reduction
associated with treatment alone increased faster than that
associated with screening alone over time (Figure 2B).
Overall Breast Cancer Mortality in 2012
With the observed changes in screening technology and
treatment regimens, we estimated a 49% (model range, 39%-
58%) decrease in overall breast cancer mortality in 2012 rela-
tive to the estimated baseline rate in 2012 of 63 deaths
(model range, 54-73) per 100 000 women (Table 1, column 4;
eTable 2 in the Supplement). The estimated screening contri-
bution associated with this mortality reduction was 37%
(model range, 26%-51%), whereas the contribution associ-
ated with treatment was 63% (model range, 49%-74%). The
larger contribution associated with treatment vs screening in
2012 was predicted in 5 of 6 models (Table 1, columns 7-8).
Note, in 2000, screening was associated with 44% (model
range, 35%-60%) of the mortality reduction and treatment
was associated with 56% (model range, 40%-65%) (eTable 5
in the Supplement).
The estimated 63% (model range, 49%-74%) relative con-
tribution associated with treatment in 2012 consisted of 31%
(model range, 22%-37%) from chemotherapy, 27% (model
range, 18%-36%) from hormone therapy, and 4% (model range,
1%-6%) from trastuzumab (Table 2).
Molecular Subtype–Specific Breast Cancer Mortality in 2012
The ER+/ERBB2− subtype was estimated to be associated with
64% (model range, 61%-70%) of the overall mortality reduc-
tion in 2012 because it was the most common subtype (eTable
7 in the Supplement).
Within-subtype analyses demonstrated significant
variations in breast cancer mortality reduction in 2012
(vs estimated subtype-specific baseline rates; Table 1, col-
umn 4). The estimated mortality reduction was largest for
the ER+/ERBB2+ subtype at 58% (model range, 46%-71%),
followed by ER+/ERBB2− at 51% (model range, 42%-59%),
and ER−/ERBB2+ at 45% (model range, 33%-55%). The low-
est mortality reduction was estimated for the ER−/ERBB2−
subtype at 37% (model range, 27%-46%).
The estimated relative contributions associated with
screening vs treatment also varied by molecular subtype,
ranging from 31% (model range, 23%-41%) with screening
vs 69% (model range, 59%-77%) with treatment for the
ER+/ERBB2+ subtype to 48% (model range, 38%-57%) with
screening vs 52% (model range, 43%-62%) with treatment for

 ER−/ERBB2− (Table 1, columns 7-8). The estimated relative
contributions associated with specific treatments varied by
subtype (Table 2). For example, for the ER+/ERBB2+ subtype,
of the 69% (model range, 59%-77%) relative contribution
associated with treatment, 26% (model range, 15%-32%) was
associated with chemotherapy, 29% (model range, 23%-36%)
with hormone therapy, and 14% (model range, 9%-18%) with
trastuzumab (Table 2). For the ER−/ERBB2− subtype, the 52%
(model range, 43%-62%) relative contribution associated
with treatment was associated with chemotherapy alone.

and, in 1997, taxanes could be added to those regimens. Hormonal therapy began
with tamoxifen in the 1980s and, starting in 1997, also included aromatase
inhibitors. For women diagnosed with ERBB2+ tumors (not shown in this
example), trastuzumab was disseminated independently of other treatments
and, based on its immediate rapid uptake, all ERBB2+ patients were modeled as
receiving trastuzumab beginning in year 2006. Models used 2010 treatment
dissemination data for subsequent years (indicated by the dashed lines).

 hormone therapy (largely the addition of aromatase inhibi-
tors), and 15% (model range, 4%-25%) with the introduction of
trastuzumab (Table 3, columns 6-8).
Within each molecular subtype, the estimated difference
in the breast cancer mortality reductions from 2000 to 2012
was largest for the ER+/ERBB2+ subtype at 19% (model range,
17%-25%)andthesmallestforER−/ERBB2−at8%(modelrange,
5%-11%) (Table 3, column 4). The estimated relative contribu-
tion associated with screening and treatment to these differ-
ences also varied by subtype: the relative contribution asso-
ciated with trastuzumab was 41% (model range, 27%-58%) in
the ER+/ERBB2+ subtype and 57% (model range, 35%-78%)
in ER−/ERBB2+ (Table 3, column 8).
To complement the above analysis, we decomposed the
overall mortality reduction in 2012 in terms of the contribu-
tions associated with advances before 2000 and after 2000
(eTable 6 in the Supplement). Of the 37% mortality reduction
(model range, 27%-42%) associated with screening in 2012,
33% (model range, 29%-48%) was associated with screening
advancesbefore2000and4%(modelrange,1%-8%)after2000
(largely digital mammography). The introduction of trastu-
zumab was associated with 15% of overall mortality reduc-
tion between 2000 and 2012. Of the 31% mortality reduction
(model range, 23%-37%) associated with chemotherapy, 22%
(model range, 15%-30%) was associated with chemotherapy
advances before 2000 and 9% (model range, 7%-14%) after
2000 (largely taxanes). Of the 27% mortality reduction (model
range, 18%-36%) associated with hormone therapy, 20%
(model range, 15%-27%) was associated with advances in hor-
mone therapy before 2000 and 7% (model range, 2%-12%) af-
ter 2000 (largely from aromatase inhibitors). eTable 6 in the
Supplement provides subtype-specific results.
Discussion
This model-based analysis provides clinically relevant in-
sights about the separate and combined population contribu-
tions associated with screening and treatment advances on re-
ducing breast cancer mortality by molecular subtype. Six
independent models found that both screening and treatment
were associated with overall and subtype-specific breast can-
cermortalitydecreasesovertime.Between2000and2012,ad-
vances in treatment were associated with a larger contribution

 considered the study period from 2000 to 2012. In this pe-
riod, digital mammography increased screening sensitivity
compared with plain-film mammography, especially for
women younger than 50 years and women with dense
breasts,34 and has increased somewhat the number of breast
cancer deaths averted with screening.35 The current results
support findings that advances in mammography continue to
contribute to reducing breast cancer mortality. It will be im-
portant to update the analysis when there is sufficient evi-
dence about the benefits of tomosynthesis or other emerging
screening approaches.36,37
Even with the recent screening advances, findings from
this model-based analysis demonstrate a shift in the relative
contributionsassociatedwithscreeningandtreatmenttobreast
cancer mortality, with greater contributions associated with
treatment in 2012. Recent observational analyses have also

a Details on the computations are included in eMethods and eTable 5 in the
Supplement. Briefly, in terms of means only, the overall mortality reduction
between 2000 and 2012 associated with combined screening and treatment
advances is estimated to be 12% (column 4). In 2012, the estimated relative
contribution of screening to the mortality reduction associated with combined
screening and treatment is 37% (Table 1, column 7). Hence, in 2012, the
mortality reduction associated with screening is 37% of 49% = 18%. Similarly,
in 2000, the mortality reduction associated with screening is 16% (eTable 5,
row F). The difference in the mortality reduction associated with screening
advances between 2012 and 2000 is 2% (= 18% in 2012 minus 16% in 2000).
The relative contribution of screening advances to the mortality reduction
associated with combined screening and treatment advances is 2% divided by
12% (column 4), giving 17% (column 5). The remainder (83% = 100% − 17%)
is associated with treatment advances between 2000 and 2012; 83% is
distributed by treatment type in columns 6 through 8. Columns 5 to 8 total
100%, within rounding error.
bRelative to the estimated baseline mortality rate in 2000.

 found stage-specific survival improvements related to cur-
rent treatment.33 The results from this model analysis con-
firmthebenefitsatthepopulationlevelfromthediscoveryand
rapiddisseminationoverthispastdecadeofseveralnewclasses
of molecularly targeted therapies, improvements in delivery
ofstandardregimens,andrefinementsintherapybasedonmo-
lecular subtype according to ER and ERBB2 status.
A unique contribution of this population-level analysis is
how the relative contributions associated with screening and
treatment varied by molecular subtype. In 2012, when gains
from treatment alone were estimated, treatment alone could
have been associated with roughly 70% of the predicted mor-
tality reduction achieved with both screening and treatment
for the all the subtypes expressing the ER, ERBB2 receptors,
or both. However, screening is likely to remain important even
if future treatments could cure all breast cancers because
screening can detect disease at earlier stages, which has less
surgical and treatment-related morbidity compared with more
advanced stages.
Among the advances in recent adjuvant therapies, ad-
vances in chemotherapy with the addition of taxanes were as-
sociated with roughly 37% of the difference in overall breast
cancer mortality reduction from 2000 to 2012. Advances in
hormonetherapywiththeadditionofaromataseinhibitorshad
comparable contribution associated with mortality reduc-
tion.Thecontributionassociatedwithtrastuzumabwassmaller
on overall mortality reduction (15%), because ERBB2+ cases
account for approximately 20% of all newly diagnosed breast
cancer cases, with variations based on age and race.38 How-
ever, trastuzumab was associated with more than 40% of the
difference in mortality reduction from 2000 to 2012 among
the ERBB2+ subtypes.
All of the models concluded that the ER−/ERBB2− sub-
type had the lowest overall modeled mortality reduction over
time, although the relative contributions associated with
screening and treatment varied somewhat by model, with 3
of the 6 models estimating a modestly higher contribution as-
sociatedwithtreatmentcomparedwithscreeningin2012.Prior
analysis of SEER data have similar results, with greater mor-
talitydeclinesforthosewithER+vsER−tumors.15,39Giventhat
treatment advancements are lagging for ER−/ERBB2− can-
cers, more intensive screening approaches, or screening with
different modalities, might be considered for groups at high-
est risk for this subtype, including African American women.
Continued investments to discover molecularly targeted treat-
ments for the ER−/ERBB2− subgroup remain important to con-
tinue to lower breast cancer death rates.
Overall, the models projected that screening and treat-
menteachwereassociatedwithcontinuedreductionsinbreast
cancer mortality, but, in 2012, treatment was associated with a
larger relative proportion than screening of the mortality re-
ductions overall and for all subtypes, except the ER−/ERBB2−.
Because ER+ cancers are the most prevalent and this group is
expected to increase with time,40 additional advances for this
subtype could have the largest effect on reducing the overall
population burden of breast cancer. Looking ahead, model-
basedapproachesmaycontinuetobeimportanttoevaluatecon-
tinued population-level progress in reducing the burden of

dissemination of effective molecularly targeted therapies, in-
vention of novel screening technologies to optimize early de-
tectionofaggressivecancersubtypes,andgreaterabilitytoiden-
tify risk of developing specific molecular subtypes to permit
tailored prevention and early detection.
This study has several strengths. First, by synthesizing
national and clinical trial data, the results fill an important
knowledge gap, especially because current surveillance data
systems do not contain information on both screening and
treatment. Second, the main findings were robust across 6
independent models, despite differences in model structures
and assumptions. Third, the validity of this comparative
modeling approach is supported by the consistency of con-
clusions across models, and the ability of each model to
closely replicate the patterns of observed trends in incidence
and mortality.
Limitations
This research has several limitations. First, the accuracy of
model results depends on the availability of good-quality data
for input parameters and reasonable assumptions about un-
observableevents.Forinstance,becausetherearelimitedlong-
term clinical trial or registry data on survival by ERBB2 sta-
tus, the models extrapolated long-term survival. Second,
modeled treatment effects were based on efficacy in trials in-
cludedintheOxfordOverview,16sotherecouldbeaslightover-
estimation of actual population treatment effects and the rela-
tive contribution of treatment to mortality reductions. Third,
each model also made different assumptions about the base-
line incidence and natural history of breast cancer, leading to
variability in the magnitude of results. Fourth, the models con-
sidered only 5 years of hormonal therapy since recommenda-
tions to consider 10 years among women at high-risk of late
recurrencewerejustrecentlyintroducedandhavenotyetbeen
uniformly applied. Future modeling could incorporate the
population-level dissemination and effectiveness of longer-
termhormonaltherapy.Fifth,progesterone-receptorstatuswas
not explicitly modeled because it is missing from many data
sources. Sixth, subtype results for various racial/ethnic sub-
groups were not modeled. Understanding interactions be-
tween race, ethnicity, and subtype-specific outcomes repre-
sents an important future direction.41 Seventh, the effect of
screeningandsubtype-specifictreatmentonmorbidityandall-
causemortalitywasnotevaluated.Eighth,modelingwasbased
onestimatesuntil2012,anditisuncertainwhetherorhowwell
these estimates reflect current breast cancer screening, treat-
ment, or outcomes after 2012.
Conclusions
In this simulation modeling study that projected trends in
breast cancer mortality rates among US women, decreases
in overall breast cancer mortality from 2000 to 2012 were
associated with advances in screening and in adjuvant
therapy, although the associations varied by breast cancer
molecular subtype.
