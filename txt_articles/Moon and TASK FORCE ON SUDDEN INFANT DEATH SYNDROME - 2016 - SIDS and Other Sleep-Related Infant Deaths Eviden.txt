abstract
Approximately 3500 infants die annually in the United States from sleep-
related infant deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), 
ill-defi
 ned deaths, and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed. 
After an initial decrease in the 1990s, the overall sleep-related infant death 
rate has not declined in more recent years. Many of the modifi
 able and 
nonmodifi
 able risk factors for SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths 
are strikingly similar. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a 
safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant 
deaths. Recommendations for a safe sleep environment include supine 
positioning, use of a fi
 rm sleep surface, room-sharing without bed-sharing, 
and avoidance of soft bedding and overheating. Additional recommendations 
for SIDS risk reduction include avoidance of exposure to smoke, alcohol, and 
illicit drugs; breastfeeding; routine immunization; and use of a pacifi
 er. New 
evidence and rationale for recommendations are presented for skin-to-skin 
care for newborn infants, bedside and in-bed sleepers, sleeping on couches/
armchairs and in sitting devices, and use of soft bedding after 4 months 
of age. In addition, expanded recommendations for infant sleep location 
are included. The recommendations and strength of evidence for each 
recommendation are published in the accompanying policy statement, “SIDS 
and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths: Updated 2016 Recommendations for a 
Safe Infant Sleeping Environment, 
” which is included in this issue.
SEARCH STRATEGY AND METHODOLOGY
Literature searches with the use of PubMed were conducted for each of 
the topics in the technical report, concentrating on articles published 
since 2011 (when the last technical report and policy statement were 
published 
1, 
 
2). All iterations of the search terms were used for each topic 
area. For example, the pacifier topic search combined either “SIDS,

SUDDEN UNEXPECTED INFANT 
DEATH AND SUDDEN INFANT DEATH 
SYNDROME: DEFINITIONS AND 
DIAGNOSTIC ISSUES
Sudden unexpected infant death 
(SUID), also known as sudden 
unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), 
is a term used to describe any 
sudden and unexpected death, 
whether explained or unexplained 
(including sudden infant death 
syndrome [SIDS] and ill-defined 
deaths), occurring during infancy. 
After case investigation, SUID can 
be attributed to causes of death 
such as suffocation, asphyxia, 
entrapment, infection, ingestions, 
metabolic diseases, and trauma 
(unintentional or nonaccidental). 
SIDS is a subcategory of SUID and 
is a cause assigned to infant deaths 
that cannot be explained after a 
thorough case investigation including 
autopsy, a scene investigation, and 
review of clinical history. 
4 (See 
 
Table 1 for definitions of terms.) 
The distinction between SIDS and 
other SUIDs, particularly those that 
occur during an unobserved sleep 
period (ie, sleep-related infant 
deaths), such as unintentional 
suffocation, is challenging, cannot be 
determined by autopsy alone, and 
may remain unresolved after a full 
case investigation. A few deaths that 
are diagnosed as SIDS are found, with 
further specialized investigations, 
to be attributable to metabolic 
disorders or arrhythmia-associated 
cardiac channelopathies.
Although standardized guidelines 
for conducting thorough case 
investigations have been developed 
(http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
sids/ 
pdf/ 
suidi- 
form2- 
1- 
2010. 
pdf), 
 
5 these 
guidelines have not been uniformly 
adopted across the >2000 US medical 
examiner and coroner jurisdictions. 
6 
Information from emergency 
responders, scene investigators, and 
caregiver interviews may provide 
additional evidence to assist death 
certifiers (ie, medical examiners and 
coroners) in accurately determining 
the cause of death. However, death 
certifiers represent a diverse group 
with varying levels of skill and 
education. In addition, there are 
diagnostic preferences. Recently, 
much attention has focused on 
reporting differences among death 
certifiers. On one extreme, some 
certifiers have abandoned the 
use of SIDS as a cause-of-death 
explanation. 
6 At the other extreme, 
some certifiers will not classify a 
death as suffocation in the absence 
of a pathologic marker of asphyxia 
at autopsy (ie, pathologic findings 
diagnostic of oronasal occlusion 
or chest compression 
7), even with 
strong evidence from the scene 
investigation suggesting a probable 
unintentional suffocation.
US Trends in SIDS, Other SUIDs, and 
Postneonatal Mortality
To monitor trends in SIDS and other 
SUIDs nationally, the United States 
classifies diseases and injuries 
according to the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases 
(ICD) diagnostic codes. In the United 
States, the National Center for Health 
Statistics assigns a SIDS diagnostic 
code (International Classification 
of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] 
R95) if the death is classified with 
terminology such as SIDS (including 
presumed, probable, or consistent 
with SIDS), sudden infant death, 
sudden unexplained death in infancy, 
sudden unexpected infant death, 
SUID, or SUDI on the certified death 
certificate. 
8, 
 
9 A death will be coded 
“other ill-defined and unspecified 
causes of mortality” (ICD-10 R99) if 
the cause of the death is reported as 
unknown or unspecified. 
8 A death 
is coded “accidental suffocation 
and strangulation in bed” (ICD-10 
W75) when the terms asphyxia, 
asphyxiated, asphyxiation, strangled, 
strangulated, strangulation, 
suffocated, or suffocation are 
reported, along with the terms bed 
or crib. This code also includes 
deaths while sleeping on couches and 
armchairs.

Defi
 nitions of Terms
Caregivers: Throughout the document, “parents” are used, but this term is meant to indicate any infant 
caregivers.
Bed-sharing: Parent(s) and infant sleeping together on any surface (bed, couch, chair).
Cosleeping: This term is commonly used, but the task force fi
 nds it confusing and it is not used in this 
document. When used, authors need to make clear whether they are referring to sleeping in close 
proximity (which does not necessarily entail bed-sharing) or bed-sharing.
Room-sharing: Parent(s) and infant sleeping in the same room on separate surfaces.
Sleep-related infant death: SUID that occurs during an observed or unobserved sleep period.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): Cause assigned to infant deaths that cannot be explained after 
a thorough case investigation including a scene investigation, autopsy, and review of the clinical 
history.

Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID), or sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI): A sudden and 
unexpected death, whether explained or unexplained (including SIDS), occurring during infancy.

Although SIDS was defined 
somewhat loosely until the mid-
1980s, there was minimal change in 
the incidence of SIDS in the United 
States until the early 1990s. In 
1992, in response to epidemiologic 
reports from Europe and Australia, 
the AAP recommended that 
infants be placed for sleep in a 
nonprone position as a strategy 
to reduce the risk of SIDS. 
10 The 
“Back to Sleep” campaign (which 
is now known as the “Safe to 
Sleep” campaign 
11) was initiated 
in 1994 under the leadership of 
the National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development 
(now the Eunice Kennedy Shriver 
National Institute of Child Health 
and Human Development) as 
a joint effort of the Maternal 
and Child Health Bureau of the 
Health Resources and Services 
Administration, the AAP, the SIDS 
Alliance (now First Candle), and 
the Association of SIDS and Infant 
Mortality Programs. Between 1992 
and 2001, the SIDS rate declined, 
with the most dramatic declines 
in the years immediately after 
the first nonprone sleep position 
recommendations, and this decline 
was consistent with the steady 
increase in the prevalence of supine 
sleeping ( 
Fig 1). 
12 The US SIDS rate 
decreased from 120 deaths per 
100 000 live births in 1992 to 56 
deaths per 100 000 live births in 
2001, representing a reduction of 
53% over 10 years. From 2001 to 
2008, the rate remained constant 
(Fig 1) and then declined from 54 
per 100 000 live births in 2009 to 
40 in 2013 (the latest year that data 
are available). In 2013, 1561 infants 
died of SIDS. 
13 Although SIDS rates 
have declined by >50% since the 
early 1990s, SIDS remains the 
leading cause of postneonatal (28 
days to 1 year of age) mortality.
The all-cause postneonatal death rate 
follows a trend similar to the SIDS 
and SUID rates, with a 26% decline 
from 1992 to 2001 (from 314 to 231 
per 100 000 live births). From 2001 
until 2009, postneonatal mortality 
rates also remained fairly unchanged 
(from 231 to 222 per 100 000 live 
births), and then have declined 
yearly since 2009 to a rate of 193 
per 100 000 live births in 2013. 
14 
Several studies have observed that 
some deaths previously classified 
as SIDS (ICD-10 R95) are now being 
classified as other causes of sleep-
related infant death (eg, accidental 
suffocation and strangulation in 
bed [ASSB; ICD-10 W75] or other 
ill-defined or unspecified causes 
[ICD-10 R99]), 
 
15, 
 
16 and that at least 
some of the decline in SIDS rates 
may be explained by increasing rates 
of these other assigned causes of 
SUID. 
15, 
17 To account for variations 
in death certifier classification and 
to more consistently track SIDS and 
other sleep-related infant deaths, 
the National Center for Health 
Statistics has created the special 
cause-of-death category SUID. The 
SUID category captures deaths with 
an underlying cause coded as ICD-
10 R95, R99, and W75. 
13 In 2013, 
SIDS accounted for 46% of the 3422

SUIDs in the United States. Similar 
to the SIDS rate, the SUID rate also 
declined in the late 2000s, from 99 
per 100 000 live births in 2009 to 87 
in 2013.
Racial and Ethnic Disparities
SIDS and SUID mortality rates, like 
other causes of infant mortality, 
have notable and persistent racial 
and ethnic disparities. 
14 Despite 
the decline in SIDS and SUIDs in all 
races and ethnicities, the rate of 
SUIDs among non-Hispanic black 
(172 per 100 000 live births) and 
American Indian/Alaska Native 
(191 per 100 000 live births) 
infants was more than double 
that of non-Hispanic white infants 
(84 per 100 000 live births) in 
2010–2013 ( 
Fig 2). SIDS rates for 
Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic 
infants were much lower than the 
rate for non-Hispanic white infants. 
Furthermore, similar racial and 
ethnic disparities are seen with 
deaths attributed to both ASSB and 
ill-defined or unspecified deaths ( 
Fig 
2). Differences in the prevalence of 
supine positioning and other sleep 
environment conditions between 
racial and ethnic populations may 
contribute to these disparities. 
18 The 
prevalence of supine positioning in 
2010 data from the National Infant 
Sleep Position Study in white infants 
was 75%, compared with 53%, 73%, 
and 80% among black, Hispanic, and 
Asian infants, respectively (Fig 3). 
19 
The Pregnancy Risk Assessment 
Monitoring System also monitors the 
prevalence of infant sleep position 
in several states (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
prams/ 
pramstat/ 
index. 
html). 
In 2011, 78% of mothers reported 
that they most often lay their infants 
on their backs for sleep (26 states 
reporting and most recent year 
available), with 80.3% of white 
mothers and 54% of black mothers 
reporting supine placement. Parent-
infant bed-sharing 
20 
– 
22 and the 
use of soft bedding are also more 
common among black families 
than among other racial/ethnic 
groups.23 
– 
25
Age at Death
Ninety percent of SIDS cases occur 
before an infant reaches the age of 
6 months. 
16 SIDS peaks between 1 
and 4 months of age. Although SIDS 
was once considered a rare event 
during the first month after birth, 
in 2004–2006 nearly 10% of cases 
that were coded as SIDS occurred 
during this period. SIDS is uncommon 
after 8 months of age. 
16 A similar age 
distribution is seen for ASSB. 
16
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS OF 
SIDS
A working model of SIDS 
pathogenesis includes a 
convergence of exogenous triggers 
or “stressors” (eg, prone sleep 
position, overbundling, airway 
obstruction), a critical period of 
development, and dysfunctional

and/or immature cardiorespiratory 
and/or arousal systems (intrinsic 
vulnerability) that lead to a failure of 
protective responses ( 
Fig 4). 
26 The 
convergence of these factors may 
ultimately result in a combination of 
progressive asphyxia, bradycardia, 
hypotension, metabolic acidosis, 
and ineffectual gasping, leading to 
death. 
27 Thus, death may occur as a 
result of the interaction between a 
vulnerable infant and a potentially 
asphyxiating and/or overheating 
sleep environment. 
28
The mechanisms responsible 
for intrinsic vulnerability (ie, 
dysfunctional cardiorespiratory and/
or arousal protective responses) 
remain unclear but may be the 
result of in utero environmental 
conditions and/or genetically 
determined maldevelopment 
or delay in maturation. Infants 
who die of SIDS are more likely 
to have been born preterm and/
or were growth restricted, which 
suggests a suboptimal intrauterine 
environment. Other adverse in 
utero environmental conditions 
include exposure to nicotine or other 
components of cigarette smoke and 
alcohol. 
29
Recent studies have explored how 
prenatal exposure to cigarette 
smoke may result in an increased 
risk of SIDS. In animal models, 
exposure to cigarette smoke or 
nicotine during fetal development 
alters the expression of the nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors in areas 
of the brainstem important for 
autonomic function and alters the 
numbers of orexin receptors in 
piglets, 
 
30, 
 
31 reduces the number 
of medullary serotonergic 
(5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) 
neurons in the raphe obscurus in 
mice, 
 
32 increases 5-HT and 5-HT 
turnover in Rhesus monkeys, 
 
33 alters 
neuronal excitability of neurons 
in the nucleus tractus solitarius 
(a brainstem region important for 
sensory integration) in guinea pigs, 
34 
and alters fetal autonomic activity 
and medullary neurotransmitter 
receptors, including nicotinic 
receptors, in baboons. 
35 
– 
37 From 
a functional perspective, prenatal 
exposure to nicotine causes 
hypoventilation and increased 
apnea 
38, 
39; reduces hypercarbia 
and hypoxia-induced ventilator 
chemoreflexes in mice, rats, 
 
38 
– 
40 
and lambs 
41; and blunts arousal in 
response to hypoxia in rats40 and 
lambs. 
41
In human infants, there are strong 
associations between nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors and 
serotonergic (5-HT) receptors in the 
brainstem during development, 
 
42 and 
there is important recent evidence of 
epigenetic changes in the placentas of 
infants with prenatal tobacco smoke 
exposure. 
43 Prenatal exposure to 
tobacco smoke attenuates recovery 
from hypoxia in preterm infants, 
 
44 
decreases heart rate variability in 
preterm 
45 and term46 infants, and 
abolishes the normal relationship 
between heart rate and gestational 
age at birth. 
45 Moreover, infants of 
smoking mothers exhibit impaired 
arousal patterns to trigeminal 
stimulation in proportion to 
urinary cotinine concentrations. 
47 
It is important to also note that 
prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke 
alters the normal programming of 
cardiovascular reflexes, such that 
the increase in blood pressure and 
heart rate in response to breathing 
4% carbon dioxide or a 60° head-up 
tilt is greater than expected. 
48 These 
changes in autonomic function, 
arousal, and cardiovascular 
reflexes may all increase an infant’s 
vulnerability to SIDS.
A recent large systematic review 
of the neuropathologic features 
of unexplained SUDI, including 
only studies that met strict 
criteria, concluded that “the most 
consistent findings, and most 
likely to be pathophysiologically 
significant, are abnormalities of 
serotonergic neurotransmission in 
the caudal brain stem.” 
49 Brainstem 
abnormalities that involve the 5-HT 
system in up to 70% of infants who 
die of SIDS have now been confirmed 
in several independent data sets and 
laboratories. 
29, 
 
50 
–52 These include 
decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine 
1A (5-HT1A) receptor binding, 
a relative decreased binding to 
the 5-HT transporter, increased 
numbers of immature 5-HT neurons, 
and decreased tissue levels of 
5-HT and the rate-limiting enzyme 
for 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan 
hydroxylase. 
53 Moreover, there is 
no evidence of excessive serotonin 
degradation as assessed by levels 
of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the 
main metabolite of serotonin) or 
ratios of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid to serotonin. 
35 This area of 
the brainstem plays a key role in 
coordinating many respiratory, 
arousal, and autonomic functions, 
and when dysfunctional, might 
prevent normal protective responses 
to stressors that commonly occur 
during sleep. Importantly, these 
findings are not confined to nuclei 
containing 5-HT neurons but also 
include relevant projection sites. 
Other abnormalities in brainstem 
projection sites have been described 
as well. For example, abnormalities 
of Phox2B immune-reactive 
neurons have been reported in the 
homologous human retrotrapezoid 
nucleus, a region of the brainstem 
that receives important 5-HT 
e5

projections and is critical to carbon 
dioxide chemoreception and 
implicated in human congenital 
central hypoventilation syndrome. 
54
The brainstem has important 
reciprocal connections to the limbic 
system comprising both cortical and 
subcortical components, including 
the limbic cortex, hypothalamus, 
amygdala, and hippocampus. These 
areas of the brain are important in 
the regulation of autonomic function, 
particularly in response to emotional 
stimuli. Thus, the brainstem and 
limbic system constitute a key 
network in controlling many aspects 
of autonomic function. Recently, 
abnormalities in the dentate gyrus 
(a component of the hippocampus) 
were observed in 41% of 153 
infants who died unexpectedly with 
no apparent cause and 43% of the 
subset of deaths classified as SIDS. 
This finding suggests that dysfunction 
of other brain regions interconnected 
with the brainstem may participate 
in the pathogenesis of SIDS. 
55 
Dentate gyrus bilamination is also 
found in some cases of temporal 
lobe epilepsy. A future potential 
line of investigation is a possible 
link in brainstem-limbic–related 
homeostatic instability between SIDS 
and sudden unexpected death in 
epilepsy and febrile seizures noted 
in some cases of sudden unexpected 
death in childhood. 
55
There are significant associations 
between brainstem 5-HT1A receptor 
binding abnormalities and specific 
SIDS risk factors, including tobacco 
smoking. 
52 These data confirm 
results from earlier studies in 
humans 
29, 
 
53 and are also consistent 
with studies in piglets that reveal 
that postnatal exposure to nicotine 
decreases medullary 5-HT1A 
receptor immunoreactivity. 
56 
Serotonergic neurons located in 
the medullary raphe and adjacent 
paragigantocellularis lateralis play 
important roles in many autonomic 
functions, including the control 
of respiration, blood pressure, 
heart rate, thermoregulation, 
sleep and arousal, and upper 
airway patency. Engineered mice 
with decreased numbers of 5-HT 
neurons and rats or piglets with 
decreased activity secondary to 
5-HT1A autoreceptor stimulation 
show diminished ventilator 
responses to carbon dioxide, 
dysfunctional heat production 
and heat loss mechanisms, and 
altered sleep architecture.57 The 
aberrant thermoregulation in these 
models provides evidence for a 
biological substrate for the risk of 
SIDS associated with potentially 
overheating environments. 
In addition, mice pups with a 
constitutive reduction in 5-HT–
producing neurons (PET1 knockout) 
or rat pups in which a large fraction 
of medullary 5-HT neurons have 
been destroyed with locally applied 
neurotoxins have a decreased ability 
to auto-resuscitate in response to 
asphyxia. 
58, 
 
59 Moreover, animals with 
5-HT neuron deficiency caused by 
direct injection of a 5-HT–selective 
neurotoxin had impaired arousal in 
response to hypoxia. 
60
Some cases of SUID have a clear 
genetic cause, such as medium-chain 
acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase 
deficiency. A recent study in 
California showed that the frequency 
of mutations for undiagnosed inborn 
errors of metabolism was similar in 
SIDS and controls and that newborn 
screening was effectively detecting 
medium-chain and very-long-chain 
acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase 
deficiencies that could potentially 
lead to SUID. 
61 There is no evidence 
of a strong heritable contribution 
for SIDS; however, genetic 
alterations that may increase the 
vulnerability to SIDS have been 
observed. Genetic variation can 
take the form of common base 
changes (polymorphisms) that 
alter gene function or rare base 
changes (mutations) that often have 
highly deleterious effects. (For a 
comprehensive review, see Opdal 
and Rognum. 
62) Several categories 
of physiologic functions relevant 
to SIDS have been examined for 
altered genetic makeup. Genes 
related to the serotonin transporter, 
cardiac channelopathies, and the 
development of the autonomic 
nervous system are the subject of 
current investigation. 
63 The serotonin 
transporter recovers serotonin from 
the extracellular space and largely 
serves to regulate overall serotonin 
neuronal activity. There are reports 
that polymorphisms in the promoter 
region that enhance the efficacy of 
the transporter (L) allele seem to be 
more prevalent in infants who die of 
SIDS compared with polymorphisms 
that reduce efficacy (S) 
62; however, 
at least 1 study did not confirm 
this association.64 It has also been 
reported that a polymorphism 
(12-repeat intron 2) of the promoter 
region of the serotonin transporter, 
which also enhances serotonin 
transporter efficiency, was increased 
in black infants who died of SIDS 
63 
but not in a Norwegian population. 
62
It has been estimated that 5% to 
10% of infants who die of SIDS 
have novel mutations in the cardiac 
sodium or potassium channel genes, 
resulting in long QT syndrome, as 
well as in other genes that regulate 
channel function. 
63 Some of these 
mutations may represent an actual 
cause of death, but others may 
contribute to causing death when 
combined with environmental 
factors, such as acidosis. 
65 There 
is molecular and functional 
evidence that implicates specific 
SCN5A (sodium channel gene) β 
subunits in SIDS pathogenesis. 
66 
In addition, 2 rare mutations in 
connexin 43, a major gap junction 
protein, have been found in SIDS 
cases and not in ethnically matched 
controls. 
67 In vitro assays of 1 
mutation showed a lack of gap 
junction function, which could lead 
to ventricular arrhythmogenesis. 
The other mutation did not appear 
to have functional consequences.

A recent study also adds weight 
to the need to perform functional 
assays and morphologic studies of 
the altered gene products. Several 
of the missense variants in genes 
encoding cardiac channels that 
have been found in SIDS cases had 
a high prevalence in the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
GO Exome Sequencing Project 
Database.68 A large study in a 
nonreferred nationwide Danish 
cohort estimated that up to 7.5% 
of SIDS cases may be explained 
by genetic variants in the sodium 
channel complex. 
69 These estimates 
are in the range of those previously 
reported. However, it is important 
that for each channelopathy 
variant discovered, the biological 
plausibility for pathogenicity is 
investigated to consider it as a cause 
of or contributor in SIDS.
The identification of polymorphisms 
in genes pertinent to the embryologic 
origin of the autonomic nervous 
system in SIDS cases also lends 
support to the hypothesis that a 
genetic predisposition contributes 
to the etiology of SIDS. The PACAP 
(pituitary adenylate cyclase-
activation polypeptide) gene and the 
gene of 1 of its receptors (PAC1) have 
received recent attention because 
of the apparent racial differences in 
their expression. For example, there 
were no associations between PACAP 
and SIDS found in white infants, 
but in SIDS cases in black infants 
a specific allele was significantly 
associated. 
70 Although in a recent 
study, a strong association between 
variants in the PAC1 gene and SIDS 
was not found, a number of potential 
associations between race-specific 
variants and SIDS were identified; 
these warrant further study. 
71 There 
have also been a number of reports of 
polymorphisms or mutations in genes 
regulating inflammation,

73 energy 
production,

in infants who died of SIDS, but these 
associations require more study to 
determine their importance.
RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE THE 
RISK OF SIDS AND OTHER SLEEP-
RELATED INFANT DEATHS
The recommendations outlined 
herein were developed to reduce 
the risk of SIDS and sleep-
related suffocation, asphyxia, and 
entrapment among infants in the 
general population. As defined 
by epidemiologists, risk refers to 
the probability that an outcome 
will occur given the presence of a 
particular factor or set of factors. 
Although all recommendations 
are intended for all who care for 
infants, some recommendations 
are also directed toward health 
policy makers, researchers, and 
professionals who care for or work 
on behalf of infants. In addition, 
because certain behaviors, such as 
smoking, can increase risk for the 
infant, some recommendations are 
directed toward women who are 
pregnant or may become pregnant in 
the near future.
The recommendations, along with 
the strength of the recommendation, 
are summarized in the accompanying 
policy statement. 
78 It should be 
noted that there are no randomized 
controlled trials with regard to SIDS 
and other sleep-related deaths; 
instead, case-control studies are the 
standard.
The recommendations are based on 
epidemiologic studies that include 
infants up to 1 year of age. Therefore, 
recommendations for sleep position 
and the sleep environment, unless 
otherwise specified, are for the 
first year after birth. The evidence-
based recommendations that follow 
are provided to guide health care 
practitioners in conversations with 
parents and others who care for 
infants. Health care practitioners 
are encouraged to have open and 
nonjudgmental conversations with 
families about their sleep practices. 
Individual medical conditions may 
warrant that a health care provider 
make different recommendations 
after weighing the relative risks and 
benefits.
INFANT SLEEP POSITION
To reduce the risk of SIDS, infants 
should be placed for sleep in the 
supine position (wholly on the 
back) for every sleep period by 
every caregiver until 1 year of age. 
Side sleeping is not safe and is not 
advised.
The prone or side sleep position 
can increase the risk of rebreathing 
expired gases, resulting in 
hypercapnia and hypoxia. 
79 
 
– 
82 The 
prone position also increases the 
risk of overheating by decreasing the 
rate of heat loss and increasing body 
temperature more than the supine 
position.83, 
 
84 Evidence suggests that 
prone sleeping alters the autonomic 
control of the infant cardiovascular 
system during sleep, particularly at 2 
to 3 months of age, 
 
85 and may result 
in decreased cerebral oxygenation. 
86 
The prone position places infants at 
high risk of SIDS (odds ratio [OR]: 
2.3–13.1). 
87 
 
– 
91 In 1 US study, SIDS 
risk associated with the side position 
was similar in magnitude to that 
associated with the prone position 
(ORs: 2.0 and 2.6, respectively), 
 
88 
and a higher population-attributable 
risk has been reported for the side 
sleep position than for the prone 
position.90, 
 
92 Furthermore, the risk 
of SIDS is exceptionally high for 
infants who are placed on the side 
and found on the stomach (OR: 8.7). 
88 
The side sleep position is inherently 
unstable, and the probability of an 
infant rolling to the prone position 
from the side sleep position is 
significantly greater than rolling 
prone from the back. 
90, 
 
93 Infants 
who are unaccustomed to the prone 
position and who are placed prone 
for sleep are also at greater risk 
than those usually placed prone 
(adjusted OR: 8.7–45.4).88, 
 
94, 
 
95 It is 
therefore critically important that 
every caregiver use the supine sleep 
position for every sleep period.

This is particularly relevant in 
situations in which a new caregiver 
is introduced: for example, when an 
infant is placed in foster care or an 
adoptive home or when an infant 
enters child care for the first time.
Despite these recommendations, 
the prevalence of supine positioning 
has remained stagnant for the past 
decade. 
19 One reason often cited by 
parents for not using the supine sleep 
position is the perception that the 
infant is uncomfortable or does not 
sleep well. 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
–104 However, an infant 
who wakes frequently is normal 
and should not be perceived as a 
poor sleeper. Physiologic studies 
show that infants are less likely to 
arouse when they are sleeping in the 
prone position. 
105 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
113 The ability to 
arouse from sleep is an important 
protective physiologic response to 
stressors during sleep, 
114 
 
 
– 
118 and the 
infant’s ability to sleep for sustained 
periods may not be physiologically 
advantageous.
The supine sleep position does not 
increase the risk of choking and 
aspiration in infants, even in those 
with gastroesophageal reflux.
Parents and caregivers continue to 
be concerned that the infant will 
choke or aspirate while supine. 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
104 
Parents often misconstrue coughing 
or gagging, which is evidence of a 
normal protective gag reflex, for 
choking or aspiration. Multiple 
studies in different countries have 
not shown an increased incidence 
of aspiration since the change to 
supine sleeping.119 
– 
121 Parents and 
caregivers are often concerned about 
aspiration when the infant has been 
diagnosed with gastroesophageal 
reflux. The AAP concurs with the 
North American Society for Pediatric 
Gastroenterology and Nutrition 
that “the risk of SIDS outweighs 
the benefit of prone or lateral sleep 
position on GER [gastroesophageal 
reflux]; therefore, in most infants 
from birth to 12 months of age, 
supine positioning during sleep is 
recommended…. Therefore, prone 
positioning is acceptable if the infant 
is observed and awake, particularly 
in the postprandial period, but 
prone positioning during sleep can 
only be considered in infants with 
certain upper airway disorders 
in which the risk of death from 
GERD [gastroesophageal reflux 
disease] may outweigh the risk of 
SIDS.” 
122 Examples of such upper 
airway disorders are those in which 
airway-protective mechanisms are 
impaired, including infants with 
anatomic abnormalities, such as type 
3 or 4 laryngeal clefts, who have 
not undergone antireflux surgery. 
There is no evidence that infants 
receiving nasogastric or orogastric 
feedings are at increased risk of 
aspiration if placed in the supine 
position. Elevating the head of the 
infant’s crib while the infant is 
supine is not effective in reducing 
gastroesophageal reflux 
123, 
124; in 
addition, elevating the head of the 
crib may result in the infant sliding 
to the foot of the crib into a position 
that may compromise respiration and 
therefore is not recommended.
Preterm infants should be placed 
supine as soon as possible.
Infants born preterm have an 
increased risk of SIDS, 
 
125, 
 
126 and 
the association between the prone 
position and SIDS among low birth 
weight and preterm infants is 
equal to, or perhaps even stronger 
than, the association among those 
born at term. 
94 Therefore, preterm 
infants should be placed supine for 
sleep as soon as clinical status has 
stabilized. The task force concurs 
with the AAP Committee on Fetus 
and Newborn that “preterm infants 
should be placed supine for sleeping, 
just as term infants should, and the 
parents of preterm infants should 
be counseled about the importance 
of supine sleeping in preventing 
SIDS. Hospitalized preterm infants 
should be kept predominantly in 
the supine position, at least from 
the postmenstrual age of 32 weeks 
onward, so that they become 
acclimated to supine sleeping before 
discharge.” 
127 Furthermore, the task 
force believes that neonatologists, 
neonatal nurses, and other health 
care providers responsible for 
organizing the hospital discharge 
of infants from NICUs should be 
vigilant about endorsing the SIDS 
risk-reduction recommendations 
from birth. They should model 
the recommendations as soon as 
the infant is medically stable and 
significantly before the infant’s 
anticipated discharge from the 
hospital. In addition, NICUs 
are encouraged to develop and 
implement policies to ensure that 
supine sleeping and other safe 
sleep practices are modeled for 
parents beforeo discharge from the 
hospital.128, 
 
129
As stated in the AAP clinical report, 
“skin-to-skin care is recommended 
for all mothers and newborns, 
regardless of feeding or delivery 
method, immediately following 
birth (as soon as the mother is 
medically stable, awake, and able 
to respond to her newborn), and 
to continue for at least an hour.” 
130 
Thereafter, or when the mother 
needs to sleep or take care of other 
needs, infants should be placed 
supine in a bassinet.
Placing infants on the side after 
birth in newborn nurseries or in 
mother-infant rooms continues to be 
a concern. The practice likely occurs 
because of a belief among nursery 
staff that newborn infants need to 
clear their airways of amniotic fluid 
and may be less likely to aspirate 
while on the side. No evidence that 
such fluid will be cleared more 
readily while in the side position 
exists. Perhaps most importantly, 
if parents observe health care 
providers placing infants in the side 
or prone position, they are likely to 
infer that supine positioning is not 
important 
131 and therefore may be 
more likely to copy this practice 
and use the side or prone position 
at home.

rooming in with their parents or 
cared for in a separate newborn 
nursery should be placed in the 
supine position as soon as they are 
ready to be placed in the bassinet. 
To promote breastfeeding, placing 
the infant skin-to-skin with mother 
after delivery, with appropriate 
observation and/or monitoring, is 
the best approach. When the mother 
needs to sleep or take care of other 
needs, the infant should be placed 
supine in a bassinet.
Once an infant can roll from supine 
to prone and from prone to supine, 
the infant may remain in the sleep 
position that he or she assumes.
Parents and caregivers are frequently 
concerned about the appropriate 
strategy for infants who have learned 
to roll over, which generally occurs 
at 4 to 6 months of age. As infants 
mature, it is more likely that they will 
roll. In 1 study, 6% and 12% of 16- to 
23-week-old infants placed on their 
backs or sides, respectively, were 
found in the prone position; among 
infants ≥24 weeks of age, 14% of 
those placed on their backs and 
18% of those placed on their sides 
were found in the prone position. 
133 
Repositioning the sleeping infant 
to the supine position can be 
disruptive and may discourage the 
use of the supine position altogether. 
Because data to make specific 
recommendations as to when it 
is safe for infants to sleep in the 
prone position are lacking, the AAP 
recommends that all infants continue 
to be placed supine until 1 year of 
age. If the infant can roll from supine 
to prone and from prone to supine, 
the infant can then be allowed to 
remain in the sleep position that he 
or she assumes. One study analyzing 
sleep-related deaths reported to 
state child death review teams found 
that the predominant risk factor for 
sleep-related deaths in infants 4 to 12 
months of age was rolling into objects 
in the sleep area. 
134 Thus, parents 
and caregivers should continue to 
keep the infant’s sleep environment 
clear of soft or loose bedding and 
other objects. Parents may be 
reassured in being advised that the 
incidence of SIDS begins to decline 
after 4 months of age. 
16
SLEEP SURFACES
Infants should be placed on a firm 
sleep surface (eg, a mattress in a 
safety-approved crib) covered by a 
fitted sheet with no other bedding 
or soft objects to reduce the risk of 
SIDS and suffocation.
To avoid suffocation, rebreathing, 
and SIDS risk, infants should sleep on 
a firm surface (eg, safety-approved 
crib and mattress). The surface 
should be covered by a fitted sheet 
without any soft or loose bedding. 
A firm surface maintains its shape 
and will not indent or conform to 
the shape of the infant’s head when 
the infant is placed on the surface. 
Soft mattresses, including those 
made from memory foam, could 
create a pocket (or indentation) and 
increase the chance of rebreathing or 
suffocation if the infant is placed in or 
rolls over to the prone position. 
81, 
 
135
A crib, bassinet, portable crib, or 
play yard that conforms to the 
safety standards of the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) 
is recommended.
Cribs should meet safety standards 
of the CPSC, 
 
136 including those for 
slat spacing, snugly fitting and firm 
mattresses, and no drop sides. The 
AAP recommends the use of new 
cribs, because older cribs may no 
longer meet current safety standards, 
may have missing parts, or may be 
incorrectly assembled. If an older 
crib is to be used, care must be taken 
to ensure that there have been no 
recalls on the crib model, that all of 
the hardware is intact, and that the 
assembly instructions are available.
For some families, the use of a crib 
may not be possible for financial or 
space considerations. In addition, 
parents may be reluctant to place the 
infant in the crib because of concerns 
that the crib is too large for the 
infant or that “crib death” (ie, SIDS) 
only occurs in cribs. Alternate sleep 
surfaces, such as portable cribs, play 
yards, and bassinets that meet safety 
standards of the CPSC, 
 
137, 
 
138 can be 
used and may be more acceptable 
for some families because they are 
smaller and more portable.
Bedside sleepers are attached to the 
side of the parental bed. The CPSC 
has published safety standards for 
bedside sleepers, 
 
139 and they may 
be considered by some parents 
as an option. There are no CPSC 
safety standards for in-bed sleepers. 
The task force cannot make a 
recommendation for or against 
the use of either bedside sleepers 
or in-bed sleepers, because there 
have been no studies examining the 
association between these products 
and SIDS or unintentional injury and 
death, including suffocation. Studies 
of in-bed sleepers are currently 
underway, but results are not yet 
available. Parents and caregivers 
should adhere to the manufacturer’s 
guidelines regarding maximum 
weight of infants who use these 
products. 
140, 
 
141 In addition, with the 
use of any of these products, other 
AAP guidelines for safe sleep outlined 
in this document, including supine 
positioning and avoidance of soft 
objects and loose bedding, should be 
followed.
Mattresses should be firm and 
maintain their shape even when 
the fitted sheet designated for that 
model is used, such that there are 
no gaps between the mattress and 
the wall of the bassinet, playpen, 
portable crib, play yard, or bedside 
sleeper. Only mattresses designed 
for the specific product should be 
used. Pillows or cushions should not 
be used as substitutes for mattresses 
or in addition to a mattress. Soft 
materials or objects, such as pillows, 
quilts, comforters, or sheepskins, 
even if covered by a sheet, should 
not be placed under a sleeping infant.

Mattress toppers, designed to make 
the sleep surface softer, should not 
be used for infants younger than 1 
year. Any fabric on the crib walls or 
a canopy should be taut and firmly 
attached to the frame so as not to 
create a suffocation risk for the 
infant.
Infants should not be placed for sleep 
on adult-sized beds because of the 
risk of entrapment and suffocation. 
142 
Portable bed rails (railings installed 
on the side of the bed that are 
intended to prevent a child from 
falling off of the bed) should not be 
used with infants because of the risk 
of entrapment and strangulation. 
143 
The infant should sleep in an area 
free of hazards, including dangling 
cords, electric wires, and window-
covering cords, because these may 
present a strangulation risk.
Recently, special crib mattresses 
and sleep surfaces that claim to 
reduce the chance of rebreathing 
carbon dioxide when the infant is 
in the prone position have been 
introduced. Although there are no 
apparent disadvantages of using 
these mattresses if they meet the 
safety standards as described 
previously, there are no studies that 
show a decreased risk of SUID/SIDS. 
(See section entitled “Commercial 
Devices” for further discussion of 
special mattresses.)
Sitting devices, such as car 
seats, strollers, swings, infant 
carriers, and infant slings, are 
not recommended for routine 
sleep in the hospital or at home, 
particularly for young infants.
Some parents choose to allow their 
infants to sleep in a car seat or 
other sitting device. Sitting devices 
include, but are not restricted to, 
car seats, strollers, swings, infant 
carriers, and infant slings. Parents 
and caregivers often use these 
devices, even when not traveling, 
because they are convenient. One 
study found that the average young 
infant spends 5.7 hours/day in a 
car seat or similar sitting device. 
144 
However, there are multiple concerns 
about the use of sitting devices as a 
usual infant sleep location. Placing an 
infant in such devices can potentiate 
gastroesophageal reflux 
145 and 
positional plagiocephaly. Because 
they still have poor head control 
and often experience flexion of the 
head while in a sitting position, 
infants younger than 4 months in 
sitting devices may be at increased 
risk of upper airway obstruction 
and oxygen desaturation. 
146 
 
– 
150 A 
recent retrospective study reviewed 
deaths involving sitting and carrying 
devices (car seats, bouncers, swings, 
strollers, and slings) reported to the 
CPSC between 2004 and 2008. Of the 
47 deaths analyzed, 31 occurred in 
car seats, 5 occurred in slings, 4 each 
occurred in swings and bouncers, 
and 3 occurred in strollers. Fifty-two 
percent of deaths in car seats were 
attributed to strangulation from 
straps; the others were attributed to 
positional asphyxia. 
151 In addition, 
analyses of CPSC data report injuries 
from falls when car seats are placed 
on elevated surfaces, 
 
152 
 
– 
156 from 
strangulation on unbuckled or 
partially buckled car seat straps, 
 
151 
and from suffocation when car seats 
overturn after being placed on a 
bed, mattress, or couch.155 There are 
also reports of suffocation in infants, 
particularly those who are younger 
than 4 months, who are carried in 
infant sling carriers. 
151, 
 
157 
– 
159 When 
infant slings are used for carrying, 
it is important to ensure that the 
infant’s head is up and above the 
fabric, the face is visible, and the nose 
and mouth are clear of obstructions. 
After nursing, the infant should be 
repositioned in the sling so that 
the head is up and is clear of fabric 
and the airway is not obstructed 
by the adult’s body.151 If an infant 
falls asleep in a sitting device, he 
or she should be removed from the 
product and moved to a crib or other 
appropriate flat surface as soon as 
is safe and practical. Car seats and 
similar products are not stable on 
a crib mattress or other elevated 
surfaces. 
152 
 
 
–156 Infants should not 
be left unattended in car seats and 
similar products, nor should they be 
placed or left in car seats and similar 
products with the straps unbuckled 
or partially buckled. 
151
BREASTFEEDING
Breastfeeding is associated 
with a reduced risk of SIDS. The 
protective effect of breastfeeding 
increases with exclusivity. 
Furthermore, any breastfeeding is 
more protective against SIDS than 
no breastfeeding.
The protective role of breastfeeding 
on SIDS is enhanced when 
breastfeeding is exclusive and 
without formula introduction. 
160 
– 
162 
Studies do not distinguish between 
direct breastfeeding and providing 
expressed milk. In the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality’s 
“Evidence Report on Breastfeeding in 
Developed Countries, 
” 6 studies were 
included in the SIDS-breastfeeding 
meta-analysis, and ever having 
breastfed was associated with 
a lower risk of SIDS (adjusted 
summary OR: 0.64; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.51–0.81). 
160 The 
German Study of Sudden Infant 
Death, the largest and most recent 
case-control study of SIDS, found that 
exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of 
age halved the risk of SIDS (adjusted 
OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28–0.82).161 
Another meta-analysis of 18 case-
control studies found an unadjusted 
summary OR for any breastfeeding 
of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.35–0.44) and a 
pooled adjusted OR of 0.55 (95% CI: 
0.44–0.69) ( 
Fig 5). 
162 The protective 
effect of breastfeeding increased 
with exclusivity, with a univariable 
summary OR of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.24–
0.31) for exclusive breastfeeding of 
any duration. 
162
Physiologic sleep studies showed 
that breastfed infants are more 
easily aroused from sleep than their 
formula-fed counterparts.

addition, breastfeeding results in 
a decreased incidence of diarrhea, 
upper and lower respiratory 
infections, and other infectious 
diseases 
165 that are associated with 
an increased vulnerability to SIDS 
and provides overall immune system 
benefits attributable to maternal 
antibodies and micronutrients 
in human milk. 
166, 
167 Exclusive 
breastfeeding for 6 months has been 
found to be more protective against 
infectious diseases, compared with 
exclusive breastfeeding to 4 months 
of age and partial breastfeeding 
thereafter. 
165 Furthermore, exclusive 
breastfeeding results in a gut 
microbiome that supports a normally 
functioning immune system and 
protection from infectious disease, 
and this commensal microbiome has 
been proposed as another possible 
mechanism or marker for protection 
against SIDS. 
168
INFANT SLEEP LOCATION
It is recommended that infants 
sleep in the parents’ room, close to 
the parents’ bed, but on a separate 
surface. The infant’s crib, portable 
crib, play yard, or bassinet should 
be placed in the parents’ bedroom, 
ideally for the first year of life, but 
at least for the first 6 months.
The terms bed-sharing and 
cosleeping are often used 
interchangeably, but they are not 
synonymous. Cosleeping is when 
parent and infant sleep in close 
proximity (on the same surface or 
different surfaces) so as to be able to 
see, hear, and/or touch each 
other. 
169, 
 
170 Cosleeping arrangements 
can include bed-sharing or 
sleeping in the same room in close 
proximity. 
170, 
 
171 Bed-sharing refers 
to a specific type of cosleeping when 
the infant is sleeping on the same 
surface with another person.170 The 
shared surface can include a bed, 
sofa, or chair. Because the term 
cosleeping can be misconstrued and 
does not precisely describe sleep 
arrangements, the AAP recommends 
the use of the terms bed-sharing 
and room-sharing (when the infant 
sleeps in the parents’ room but on a 
separate sleep surface [crib or similar 
surface] close to the parents’ bed) 
(see  
Table 1).
The AAP recommends room-sharing, 
because this arrangement decreases 
the risk of SIDS by as much as 50% 
89, 
 
91, 
 
172, 
 
173 and is safer than bed-
sharing89, 
 
91, 
 
172, 
 
173 or solitary sleeping 
(when the infant is in a separate 
room). 
89, 
172 In addition, room-sharing 
is most likely to prevent suffocation, 
strangulation, and entrapment that 
may occur when the infant is sleeping 
in the adult bed. Furthermore, 
this arrangement allows close 
proximity to the infant, which will 
facilitate feeding, comforting, and 
monitoring of the infant. Most of the 
epidemiologic studies on which these 
recommendations are based include 
infants up to 1 year of age. Therefore, 
the AAP recommends that infants 
room-share, ideally for the first year 
after birth, but at least for the first 6 
months. Although there is no specific 
evidence for moving an infant to his 
or her own room before 1 year of 
age, room-sharing during the first 6 
months is especially critical because 
the rates of SIDS and other sleep-
related deaths, particularly those 
occurring in bed-sharing situations, 
are highest during that period.
Parent-infant bed-sharing for all or 
part of sleep duration is common. 
In 1 national survey for the period 
2001–2010, 46% of parents 
responded that they had shared 
a bed with their infant (8 months 
or younger) at some point in the 
preceding 2 weeks, and 13.5% 
reported that they usually bed-
shared. 
174 In another national survey, 
any bed-sharing was reported by 
42% of mothers at 2 weeks of infant 
age and 27% of mothers at 12 
months of infant age. 
175 In a third 
study, almost 60% of mothers of 
infants from birth to 12 months of 
age reported bed-sharing at least 
once. 
176 The rate of routine bed-
sharing is higher among some 
racial/ethnic groups, including 
black, Hispanic, and American 
Indian/Alaska Native parents/
infants. 
20, 
22, 
 
174 There are often 
cultural and personal reasons 
why parents choose to bed-share, 
including convenience for feeding 
(breast or formula), comforting a 
fussy or sick infant, helping the infant 
and/or mother sleep better, bonding 
and attachment, and because it is a 
family tradition. 
175, 
 
177 In addition, 
many parents may believe that their 
own vigilance is the only way that 
they can keep their infant safe and 
that the close proximity of bed-
sharing allows them to maintain 
vigilance, even while sleeping. 
178 
Some parents will use bed-sharing 
specifically as a safety strategy if 
the infant sleeps in the prone 
position23, 
 
178 or there is concern 
about environmental dangers, such 
as vermin or stray gunfire.

Parent-infant bed-sharing continues 
to be highly controversial. Although 
electrophysiologic and behavioral 
studies offer a strong case for its effect 
in facilitating breastfeeding, 
 
179 
– 
181 
and although many parents believe 
that they can maintain vigilance 
of the infant while they are asleep 
and bed-sharing, 
 
178 epidemiologic 
studies have shown that bed-sharing 
is associated with a number of 
conditions that are risk factors for
 SIDS, including soft bedding, 
182 
 
– 
185 
head covering, 
 
186 
– 
189 and, for infants 
of smokers, increased exposure 
to tobacco smoke. 
190 In addition, 
bed-sharing is associated with an 
increased risk of SIDS; a recent meta-
analysis of 11 studies investigating 
the association of bed-sharing 
and SIDS showed a summary OR 
of 2.88 (95% CI: 1.99–4.18) with 
bed-sharing. 
191 Furthermore, bed-
sharing in an adult bed not designed 
for infant safety, especially when 
associated with other risk factors, 
exposes the infant to additional 
risks for unintentional injury 
and death, such as suffocation, 
asphyxia, entrapment, falls, and 
strangulation.192, 
 
193 Infants younger 
than 4 months 
194 and those born 
preterm and/or with low birth 
weight 
195 are at the highest risk, 
possibly because immature motor 
skills and muscle strength make 
it difficult to escape potential 
threats. 
191 In recent years, the 
concern among public health officials 
about bed-sharing has increased, 
because there have been increased 
reports of SUIDs occurring in high-
risk sleep environments, particularly 
bed-sharing and/or sleeping on a 
couch or armchair.196 
– 
198
On the other hand, some breastfeeding 
advocacy groups encourage safer bed-
sharing to promote breastfeeding, 
 
199 
and debate continues as to the safety 
of this sleep arrangement for low-risk, 
breastfed infants. In an analysis from 
2 case-control studies in England 
(1993–1996 and 2003–2006), Blair 
et al 
200 reported an adjusted OR of 
bed-sharing (excluding bed-sharing 
on a sofa) for infants in the absence 
of parental alcohol or tobacco use 
of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6–2.9). For infants 
younger than 98 days, the OR was 1.6 
(95% CI: 0.96–2.7). 
200 These findings 
were independent of feeding method. 
The study lacked power to examine 
this association in older infants, 
because there was only 1 SIDS case 
in which bed-sharing was a factor 
in the absence of other risk factors. 
Breastfeeding was more common 
among bed-sharing infants, and the 
protective effect of breastfeeding was 
found only for infants who slept alone. 
The controls in these analyses were 
infants who were not bed-sharing/
sofa-sharing regardless of room 
location; thus, they included infants 
who were room-sharing or sleeping 
in a separate room. In addition, the 
control infants included those whose 
parent(s) smoked or used alcohol. It 
is possible that this choice of controls 
overestimated their risk, leading to 
smaller ORs for risk among the cases 
(ie, biasing the results toward the 
null).
Carpenter et al 
201 analyzed data 
from 19 studies across the United 
Kingdom, Europe, and Australasia to 
determine the risk of SIDS from bed-
sharing when an infant is breastfed, 
the parents do not smoke, and the 
mother has not taken alcohol or 
drugs. When neither parent smoked, 
in the absence of other risk factors, 
the adjusted OR for bed-sharing 
versus room-sharing for all breastfed 
infants was 2.7 (95% CI: 1.4–5.3). 
201 
For breastfed infants younger than 
3 months, in the absence of other 
risk factors, the adjusted OR for bed-
sharing versus room-sharing was 5.1 
(95% CI: 2.3–11.4). The study lacked 
power to examine this association in 
breastfed infants 3 months and older. 
Moreover, the large proportion of 
missing data for maternal alcohol and 
drug use is a limitation, although the 
authors used appropriate multiple 
imputation techniques for addressing 
these missing data.
The task force, recognizing 
the controversial nature of the 
recommendations about bed-
sharing and the different methods 
and interpretations of these 2 sets 
of analyses outlined previously, 
requested an independent review 
of both articles by Dr Robert Platt, 
a biostatistician with expertise in 
perinatal epidemiology from McGill 
University in Canada. Dr Platt has 
no connection to the task force, nor 
does he have a vested interest in the 
recommendations. Dr Platt provided 
the following conclusion: 
The fundamental difference in 
conclusions is that Blair et al 
conclude that bed-sharing in 
the absence of other risk factors 
(smoking, alcohol) does not convey 
an increased risk of SIDS, while 
Carpenter et al conclude the opposite. 
In both studies, the no-other-risk-
factors group is limited in size, 
and the number of exposed cases 
is very small. In Blair et al, there 
are only 24 cases who bed-shared 
in the absence of these hazards. In 
Carpenter et al, although the total 
number of SIDS cases (1472) is 
more than 3 times the number of 
cases in the Blair study (400), the 
number of cases who bed-shared in 
the absence of these hazards was 
only 12 (personal communication, 
Professor Robert Carpenter, January 
25, 2016). Therefore, the Carpenter 
results should be interpreted with 
some caution as well. In conclusion, 
both studies have strengths and 
weaknesses, and while on the surface 
the studies appear to contradict 
each other, I do not believe that their 
data support definitive differences 
between the 2 studies. There is some 
evidence of an increased risk in 
the no-other-risk-factor setting, in 
particular in the youngest age groups. 
However, based on concerns about 
sample size limitations, we are not 
able to say how large that increased 
risk is. Clearly, these data do not 
support a definitive conclusion 
that bed-sharing in the youngest

age group is safe, even under less 
hazardous circumstances.
There is insufficient evidence to 
recommend for or against the use 
of devices promoted to make bed-
sharing “safe.”
There is no evidence that devices 
marketed to make bed-sharing 
“safe” reduce the risk of SIDS or 
suffocation or are safe. Several 
products designed for in-bed use are 
currently under study, but results are 
not yet available. Bedside sleepers, 
which attach to the side of the 
parental bed and for which the CPSC 
published standards in 2013, may 
be considered by some parents as an 
option. The task force cannot make 
a recommendation for or against 
the use of either bedside sleepers 
or in-bed sleepers, because there 
have been no studies examining the 
association between these products 
and SIDS or unintentional injury and 
death, including suffocation. (See 
section entitled “Sleep Surfaces” for 
further discussion of sleepers.)
Infants who are brought into the 
bed for feeding or comforting 
should be returned to their own 
crib or bassinet when the parent is 
ready to return to sleep.
Studies have found an association 
between bed-sharing and longer 
duration of breastfeeding, 
 
202 but 
most of these were cross-sectional 
studies, which do not enable 
the determination of a temporal 
relationship: that is, whether bed-
sharing promotes breastfeeding or 
whether breastfeeding promotes 
bed-sharing, and whether women 
who prefer one practice are also 
likely to prefer the other. 
203 However, 
a more recent longitudinal study 
provides strong evidence that bed-
sharing promotes breastfeeding 
duration, with the greatest effect 
among frequent bed-sharers. 
202 
Another recent study has shown that, 
compared with mothers who room-
shared without bed-sharing, mothers 
who bed-shared were more likely 
to report exclusive breastfeeding 
(adjusted OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 
1.76–3.45) or partial breastfeeding 
(adjusted OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.33–
2.31). 
204 Although bed-sharing may 
facilitate breastfeeding, 
175 there are 
other factors, such as intent, that 
influence successful breastfeeding. 
205 
Furthermore, 1 case-control study 
found that the risk of SIDS while bed-
sharing was similar among infants in 
the first 4 months of life, regardless 
of breastfeeding status, implying 
that the benefits of breastfeeding 
do not outweigh the increased 
risk associated with bed-sharing 
for younger infants. 
194 The risk of 
bed-sharing is higher the longer the 
duration of bed-sharing during the 
night, 
 
91 especially when associated 
with other risks. 
89, 
90, 
 
206, 
 
207 Returning 
the infant to the crib after bringing 
the infant into the bed for a short 
period of time is not associated with 
increased risk. 
90, 
 
207 Therefore, after 
the infant is brought into the bed for 
feeding, comforting, and bonding, the 
infant should be returned to the crib 
when the parent is ready for sleep.
Couches and armchairs are 
extremely dangerous places for 
infants.
Sleeping on couches and armchairs 
places infants at an extraordinarily 
high risk of infant death, including 
SIDS, 
 
87, 
 
89, 
 
90, 
 
173, 
200, 
 
207 suffocation 
through entrapment or wedging 
between seat cushions, or overlay if 
another person is also sharing this 
surface. 
197 Therefore, parents and 
other caregivers should be especially 
vigilant as to their wakefulness when 
feeding infants or lying with infants 
on these surfaces. It is important to 
emphasize this point to mothers, 
because 25% of mothers in 1 study 
reported falling asleep during the 
night when breastfeeding their infant 
on one of these surfaces. 
176 Infants 
should never be placed on a couch or 
armchair for sleep.
Guidance for parents who fall 
asleep while feeding their infant.
The safest place for an infant 
to sleep is on a separate sleep 
surface designed for infants close 
to the parent’s bed. However, the 
AAP acknowledges that parents 
frequently fall asleep while feeding 
the infant. Evidence suggests that 
it is less hazardous to fall asleep 
with the infant in the adult bed than 
on a sofa or armchair, should the 
parent fall asleep. 
87, 
 
89, 
 
90, 
 
173, 
200, 
 
207 
It is important to note that a large 
percentage of infants who die of SIDS 
are found with their head covered by 
bedding. 
186 Therefore, there should 
be no pillows, sheets, blankets, 
or any other items in the bed that 
could obstruct infant breathing 
87, 
 
182 or cause overheating.208 
 
– 
211 
Parents should follow safe sleep 
recommendations outlined 
elsewhere in this statement. Because 
there is evidence that the risk of 
bed-sharing is higher with longer 
duration, if the parent falls asleep 
while feeding the infant in bed the 
infant should be placed back on a 
separate sleep surface as soon as the 
parent awakens. 
89, 
90, 
 
206, 
 
207
There are specific circumstances 
that, in case-control studies and 
case series, have been shown to 
substantially increase the risk of 
SIDS or unintentional injury or 
death while bed-sharing, and 
these should be avoided at all 
times.
The task force emphasizes that 
certain circumstances greatly 
increase the risk of bed-sharing 
for both breastfed and formula-fed 
infants. Bed-sharing is especially 
dangerous in the following 
circumstances, and these should be 
avoided at all times:
 
• when one or both parents 
are smokers, even if they are 
not smoking in bed (OR: 
2.3–21.6)

90,

207;
 
• when soft bedding accessories such 
as pillows or blankets are used 
(OR: 2.8–4.1) 
87, 
 
215;
 
• when there are multiple bed-
sharers (OR: 5.4)

• when the parent has consumed 
alcohol (OR: 1.66–89.7)

201 
and/or illicit or sedating drugs201; 
and
 
• when the infant is bed-sharing with 
someone who is not a parent (OR: 
5.4). 
87
A retrospective series of SIDS cases 
reported that mean maternal body 
weight was higher for bed-sharing 
mothers than for non–bed-sharing 
mothers. 
216 The only case-control 
study to investigate the relationship 
between maternal body weight and 
bed-sharing did not find an increased 
risk of bed-sharing with increased 
maternal weight. 
217
The safety and benefits of cobedding 
twins and higher-order multiples 
have not been established. It is 
prudent to provide separate sleep 
areas and avoid cobedding (sleeping 
on the same sleep surface) for twins 
and higher-order multiples in the 
hospital and at home.
Cobedding of twins and other infants 
of multiple gestation is a frequent 
practice, both in the hospital setting 
and at home. 
218 However, the 
benefits of cobedding twins and 
higher-order multiples have not 
been established. 
219 
– 
221 Twins and 
higher-order multiples are often 
born preterm and with low birth 
weights, so they are at increased risk 
of SIDS.125, 
 
126 Furthermore, cobedding 
increases the potential for overheating 
and rebreathing, and size discordance 
between multiples may increase the 
risk of unintentional suffocation. 
220 
Most cobedded twins are placed on 
the side rather than supine. 
218 Finally, 
cobedding of twins and higher-order 
multiples in the hospital setting may 
encourage parents to continue this 
practice at home. 
220 Because the 
evidence for the benefits of cobedding 
twins and higher-order multiples is 
not compelling and because of the 
increased risk of SIDS and suffocation, 
the AAP believes that it is prudent to 
provide separate sleep areas for these 
infants to decrease the risk of SIDS 
and unintentional suffocation.
USE OF BEDDING
Keep soft objects, such as pillows, 
pillow-like toys, quilts, comforters, 
sheepskins, and loose bedding, 
such as blankets and nonfitted 
sheets, away from the infant’s 
sleep area to reduce the risk of 
SIDS, suffocation, entrapment, and 
strangulation.
Soft objects and loose bedding can 
obstruct an infant’s airway and increase 
the risk of SIDS, 
 
87, 
 
182 suffocation, and 
rebreathing. 
79, 
 
81, 
82, 
 
135, 
 
222 
– 
224 In the 
United States, nearly 55% of infants 
are placed to sleep underneath or on 
top of bedding such as thick blankets, 
quilts, and pillows.25 The prevalence 
of bedding use is highest among 
infants whose mothers are teenagers, 
from minority racial groups, and 
among those without a college 
education.
Pillows, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, 
and other soft bedding can be 
hazardous when placed under the 
infant 
87, 
 
182, 
 
210, 
 
225 
 
– 
229 or left loose in the 
infant’s sleep area.

– 
234 
Bedding in the sleeping environment 
increases SIDS risk fivefold, 
independent of sleep position, 
87, 
 
182 
and this risk increases to 21-fold when 
the infant is placed prone. 
87, 
 
182 Many 
infants who die of SIDS are found in the 
supine position but with their heads 
covered by loose bedding. 
90, 
225, 
 
226, 
 
230 In 
addition, infants who bed-share (share 
a sleep surface) have a higher SIDS risk 
when sleeping on a soft as opposed to 
a firm surface. 
215
In addition to SIDS risk, soft objects 
and loose bedding in the sleeping 
environment may also lead to 
unintentional suffocation. 
134, 
 
224, 
 
235 A 
review of 66 SUID case investigations 
in 2011 showed that soft bedding 
was the most frequently reported 
factor among deaths classified as 
possible and explained unintentional 
suffocation deaths. 
224 In addition, a 
CPSC report of sleep-related infant 
deaths in 2009–2011 found that 
most deaths attributed to suffocation 
(regardless of whether infant was 
sleeping in a crib, on a mattress, or in 
a play yard) involved extra bedding, 
such as pillows or blankets.235 Soft 
bedding (eg, blankets and stuffed 
animals) may also be a stronger risk 
factor for sleep-related deaths among 
infants older than 3 months than it 
is for their younger counterparts, 
especially when infants are placed in 
or roll to the prone position. 
134
Parents and caregivers are likely 
motivated by good intentions and 
perceived cultural norms when they 
opt to use bedding for infant sleep. 
Qualitative studies show that parents 
who use bedding want to provide a 
comfortable and safe environment for 
their infant. 
236 For comfort, parents 
may use blankets to provide warmth 
or to soften the sleep surface. For 
safety, parents may use pillows as 
barriers to prevent falls from adult 
beds or sofas or as a prop to keep 
their infant on the side. 
236 Images of 
infants sleeping with blankets, pillows, 
and other soft objects are widespread 
in popular magazines targeted to 
families with newborn infants. 
237 
Parents and caregivers who see these 
images may perceive the use of these 
items as the norm, both favorable and 
the ideal, for infant sleep.
To avoid suffocation, rebreathing, and 
SIDS risk, infants should sleep on a firm

surface (see section entitled “Sleep 
Surfaces” for a definition of a firm 
surface). 
135 Because pillows, quilts, and 
comforters can obstruct the infant’s 
airway (nose or mouth), they should 
never be used in the infant’s sleeping 
environment. Infant sleep clothing, 
such as sleeping sacks, are designed 
to keep the infant warm and can be 
used in place of blankets to prevent 
the possibility of head covering or 
entrapment. However, care must be 
taken to select appropriately sized 
clothing and to avoid overheating. 
Nursing and hospital staff should 
model safe sleep arrangements to new 
parents after delivery.
Bumper pads are not 
recommended; they have been 
implicated in deaths attributable 
to suffocation, entrapment, and 
strangulation and, with new safety 
standards for crib slats, are not 
necessary for safety against head 
entrapment.
Bumper pads and similar products 
attaching to crib slats or sides 
are frequently used with the 
thought of protecting infants from 
injury. Initially, bumper pads 
were developed to prevent head 
entrapment between crib slats. 
238 
However, newer crib standards 
requiring crib slat spacing to be 
<2-3/8 inches have obviated the need 
for crib bumpers. In addition, infant 
deaths have occurred because of 
bumper pads. A case series by Thach 
et al, 
 
239 which used 1985–2005 CPSC 
data, found that deaths attributed to 
bumper pads occurred as a result of 3 
mechanisms: (1) suffocation against 
soft, pillow-like bumper pads; (2) 
entrapment between the mattress 
or crib and firm bumper pads; and 
(3) strangulation from bumper pad 
ties. However, a 2010 CPSC white 
paper that reviewed the same cases 
concluded that there were other 
confounding factors, such as the 
presence of pillows and/or blankets, 
that may have contributed to many of 
the deaths in this report. 
240 The white 
paper pointed out that available 
data from the scene investigations, 
autopsies, law enforcement records, 
and death certificates often lacked 
sufficiently detailed information to 
conclude how or whether bumper 
pads contributed to the deaths. Two 
more recent analyses of CPSC data 
also came to different conclusions. 
The CPSC review concluded again 
that there was insufficient evidence 
to support that bumper pads were 
primarily responsible for infant 
deaths when bumper pads were used 
per the manufacturer’s instructions 
and in the absence of other unsafe 
sleep risk factors. 
241 Scheers et al, 
242 
in their re-analysis, concluded that 
the rate of bumper pad–related 
deaths has increased, recognizing 
that changes in reporting may 
account for the increase, and that 
67% of the deaths could have been 
prevented if the bumper pads had 
not been present. Limitations of CPSC 
data collection processes contribute 
to the difficulty in determining the 
risk of bumper pad use.
However, others 
239, 
 
243 have concluded 
that the use of bumper pads only 
prevents minor injuries, and that 
the potential benefits of preventing 
minor injury with bumper pad use 
are far outweighed by the risk of 
serious injury, such as suffocation 
or strangulation. In addition, most 
bumper pads obscure infant and 
parent visibility, which may increase 
parental anxiety. 
236, 
 
238 Other products 
exist that attach to crib sides or crib 
slats and claim to protect infants from 
injury; however, there are no published 
data that support these claims. Because 
of the potential for suffocation, 
entrapment, and strangulation and lack 
of evidence to support that bumper 
pads or similar products that attach 
to crib slats or sides prevent injury 
in young infants, the AAP does not 
recommend their use.
PACIFIER USE
Consider offering a pacifier at 
naptime and bedtime.
Multiple case-control 
studies 
87, 
 
91, 
 
207, 
 
244 
 
 
 
–250 and 2 meta-
analyses 
251, 
 
252 have reported a 
protective effect of pacifiers on 
the incidence of SIDS, particularly 
when used at the time of the last 
sleep period, with decreased risk 
of SIDS ranging from 50% to 90%. 
Furthermore, 1 study found that 
pacifier use favorably modified the 
risk profile of infants who sleep in the 
prone/side position, bed-share, or 
use soft bedding. 
253 The mechanism 
for this apparent strong protective 
effect is still unclear, but favorable 
modification of autonomic control 
during sleep 
254 and maintaining 
airway patency during sleep255 
have been proposed. Physiologic 
studies of the effect of pacifier use 
on arousal are conflicting; 1 study 
found that pacifier use decreased 
arousal thresholds, 
 
163 but others 
have found no effects on arousability 
with pacifier use. 
256, 
 
257 It is common 
for the pacifier to fall from the mouth 
soon after the infant falls asleep; 
even so, the protective effect persists 
throughout that sleep period. 
163, 
258 
Two studies have shown that 
pacifier use is most protective when 
used for all sleep periods. 
207, 
 
250 
However, these studies also showed 
an increased risk of SIDS when the 
pacifier was usually used but not 
used the last time the infant was 
placed for sleep; the significance of 
these findings is yet unclear.
Although some SIDS experts and 
policy makers endorse pacifier use 
recommendations that are similar to 
those of the AAP, 
 
259, 
 
260 concerns about 
possible deleterious effects of pacifier 
use have prevented others from 
making a recommendation for pacifier 
use as a risk-reduction strategy. 
261 
Although several observational 
studies 
262– 
264 have shown a correlation 
between pacifiers and reduced 
breastfeeding duration, a recent 
Cochrane review comparing pacifier 
use and nonuse in healthy term infants 
who had initiated breastfeeding found 
that pacifier use had no effects on 
e15

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
partial or exclusive breastfeeding rates 
at 3 and 4 months. 
265 Furthermore, 
a systematic review found that the 
highest level of evidence (ie, from 
clinical trials) does not support an 
adverse relationship between pacifier 
use and breastfeeding duration or 
exclusivity. 
266 The association between 
shortened duration of breastfeeding 
and pacifier use in observational 
studies likely reflects a number of 
complex factors, such as breastfeeding 
difficulties or intent to wean. 
266, 
267 
However, some have also raised 
the concern that studies that show 
no effect of pacifier introduction on 
breastfeeding duration or exclusivity 
may not account for early weaning or 
failure to establish breastfeeding. 
268 
The AAP policy statement 
“Breastfeeding and the Use of Human 
Milk” includes a recommendation 
that pacifiers can be used during 
breastfeeding but that implementation 
should be delayed until breastfeeding 
is well established. 
269 Infants who are 
not being directly breastfed can begin 
pacifier use as soon as desired.
Some dental malocclusions have 
been found more commonly among 
pacifier users than nonusers, but the 
differences generally disappeared 
after pacifier cessation. 
270 The 
American Academy of Pediatric 
Dentistry policy statement on oral 
habits states that nonnutritive 
sucking behaviors (ie, fingers or 
pacifiers) are considered normal in 
infants and young children and that, 
in general, sucking habits in children 
to the age of 3 years are unlikely to 
cause any long-term problems. 
271 
Pacifier use is associated with an 
approximate 1.2- to 2-fold increased 
risk of otitis media, particularly 
between 2 and 3 years of age. 
272, 
 
273 
The incidence of otitis media is 
generally lower in the first year 
after birth, especially the first 6 
months, when the risk of SIDS is the 
highest.274 
 
 
 
–279 However, pacifier use, 
once established, may persist beyond 
6 months, thus increasing the risk of 
otitis media. Gastrointestinal tract 
infections and oral colonization with 
Candida species were also found to 
be more common among pacifier 
users than nonusers. 
275 
– 
277
Because of the risk of strangulation, 
pacifiers should not be hung around 
the infant’s neck. Pacifiers that attach 
to the infant’s clothing should not be 
used with sleeping infants. Objects, 
such as stuffed toys, that may present 
a suffocation or choking risk, should 
not be attached to pacifiers.
There is insufficient evidence that 
finger sucking is protective against 
SIDS.
The literature on infant finger 
sucking and SIDS is extremely 
limited. Only 2 case-control studies 
have reported these results. 
248, 
 
249 
One study from the United States 
showed a protective effect of infant 
finger sucking (reported as “thumb 
sucking”) against SIDS (adjusted 
OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25–0.77), but 
it was less protective than pacifier 
use (adjusted OR: 0.07 [95% CI: 
0.01–0.64] if the infant also sucked 
the thumb; adjusted OR: 0.08 [95% 
CI: 0.03–0.23] if the infant did not 
suck the thumb). 
249 Another study 
from The Netherlands did not 
show an association between usual 
finger sucking (reported as “thumb 
sucking”) and SIDS risk (OR: 1.38; 
95% CI: 0.35–1.51), but the wide CI 
suggests that there was insufficient 
power to detect a significant 
association. 
248
PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL 
EXPOSURES (INCLUDING SMOKING 
AND ALCOHOL)
Pregnant women should obtain 
regular prenatal care.
There is substantial epidemiologic 
evidence linking a lower risk of SIDS 
for infants whose mothers obtain 
regular prenatal care. 
280 
 
– 
283 Women 
should obtain prenatal care from 
early in the pregnancy, according to 
established guidelines for frequency 
of prenatal visits.284
Smoking during pregnancy, in the 
pregnant woman’s environment, 
and in the infant’s environment 
should be avoided.
Maternal smoking during pregnancy 
has been identified as a major risk 
factor in almost every epidemiologic 
study of SIDS. 
285 
 
– 
288 Smoke in the 
infant’s environment after birth has 
been identified as a separate major 
risk factor in a few studies, 
286, 
 
289 
although separating this variable 
from maternal smoking before birth 
is problematic. Third-hand smoke 
refers to residual contamination 
from tobacco smoke after the 
cigarette has been extinguished 
290; 
there is no research to date on the 
significance of third-hand smoke 
with regard to SIDS risk. Smoke 
exposure adversely affects infant 
arousal 
291 
 
 
 
– 
297; in addition, smoke 
exposure increases the risk of 
preterm birth and low birth weight, 
both risk factors for SIDS. The effect 
of tobacco smoke exposure on 
SIDS risk is dose-dependent. The 
risk of SIDS is particularly high when 
the infant bed-shares with an adult 
smoker (OR: 2.3–21.6), even when 
the adult does not smoke in 
bed.89, 
 
90, 
 
191, 
 
200, 
 
201, 
206, 
 
212, 
 
298 It 
is estimated that one-third of 
SIDS deaths could be prevented 
if all maternal smoking during 
pregnancy was eliminated. 
299, 
 
300 
The AAP supports the elimination 
of all tobacco smoke exposure, both 
prenatally and environmentally.
Avoid alcohol and illicit drug use 
during pregnancy and after the 
infant’s birth.
Several studies have specifically 
investigated the association of 
SIDS with prenatal and postnatal 
exposure to alcohol or illicit drug 
use, although substance abuse often 
involves more than one substance 
and it is often difficult to separate 
out these variables from each other 
and from smoking. However, 1 study 
in Northern Plains American Indian 
infants found that periconceptional

maternal alcohol use (adjusted 
OR: 6.2; 95% CI: 1.6–23.3) and 
maternal first-trimester binge 
drinking (adjusted OR: 8.2; 95% CI: 
1.9–35.3) 
211 were associated with 
increased SIDS risk, independent of 
prenatal cigarette smoking exposure. 
A retrospective study from Western 
Australia found that a maternal 
alcoholism diagnosis recorded during 
pregnancy (adjusted hazard ratio: 
6.92; 95% CI: 4.02–11.90) or within 1 
year postpregnancy (adjusted hazard 
ratio: 8.61; 95% CI: 5.04–14.69) was 
associated with increased SIDS risk, 
and the authors estimated that at 
least 16.41% of SIDS deaths were 
attributable to maternal alcohol use 
disorder. 
301 Another study from 
Denmark, based on prospective data 
on maternal alcohol use, has also 
shown a significant relationship 
between maternal binge drinking 
and postneonatal infant mortality, 
including SIDS. 
302 Parental alcohol 
and/or illicit drug use in combination 
with bed-sharing places the infant 
at particularly high risk of SIDS and 
unintentional suffocation. 
91, 
196
Rat models have shown increased 
arousal latency to hypoxia in rat 
pups exposed to prenatal alcohol. 
303 
Furthermore, postmortem studies 
in Northern Plains American Indian 
infants showed that prenatal 
cigarette smoking was significantly 
associated with decreased serotonin 
receptor binding in the brainstem. 
In this study, the association of 
maternal alcohol drinking in the 3 
months before or during pregnancy 
was of borderline significance on 
univariate analysis but was not 
significant when prenatal smoking 
and case versus control status was 
in the model. 
29 However, this study 
had limited power for multivariate 
analysis because of the small sample 
size. One study found an association 
of SIDS with heavy alcohol 
consumption in the 2 days before the 
death. 
304 Several studies have found 
a particularly strong association 
when alcohol consumption or illicit 
drug use occurs in combination with 
bed-sharing. 
89– 
91, 
 
305
Studies investigating the relationship 
of illicit drug use and SIDS have 
focused on specific drugs or illicit 
drug use in general. One study 
found maternal cannabis use to be 
associated with an increased risk 
of SIDS (adjusted OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 
1.36–4.05) at night but not during the 
day. 
306 In utero exposure to opiates 
(primarily methadone and heroin) 
has been shown in retrospective 
studies to be associated with an 
increased risk of SIDS. 
307, 
 
308 
With the exception of 1 study that did 
not show an increased risk, 
 
309 
population-based studies have 
generally shown an increased risk 
with in utero cocaine exposure.310 
– 
312 
However, these studies did not 
control for confounding factors. 
A prospective cohort study found 
the SIDS rate to be significantly 
increased for infants exposed in 
utero to methadone (OR: 3.6; 95% 
CI: 2.5–5.1), heroin (OR: 2.3; 95% 
CI: 1.3–4.0), methadone and heroin 
(OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.2–8.6), and 
cocaine (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2–2.2), 
even after controlling for race/
ethnicity, maternal age, parity, birth 
weight, year of birth, and maternal 
smoking. 
313 In addition, a meta-
analysis of studies investigating 
an association between in utero 
cocaine exposure and SIDS found 
an increased risk of SIDS to be 
associated with prenatal exposure to 
cocaine and illicit drugs in general. 
314
OVERHEATING, FANS, AND ROOM 
VENTILATION
Avoid overheating and head 
covering in infants.
The amount of clothing or blankets 
covering an infant and the room 
temperature are associated with an 
increased risk of SIDS. 
208 
 
– 
211 Infants 
who sleep in the prone position have 
a higher risk of overheating than 
supine sleeping infants.210 However, 
the definition of overheating in the 
studies that found an increased risk 
of SIDS varies. It is therefore difficult 
to provide specific room temperature 
guidelines to avoid overheating.
It is unclear whether the relationship 
to overheating is an independent 
factor or merely a reflection of the 
increased risk of SIDS and suffocation 
with blankets and other potentially 
asphyxiating objects in the sleeping 
environment. Head covering during 
sleep is of particular concern. In 
1 systematic review, the pooled mean 
prevalence of head covering among 
SIDS victims was 24.6%, compared 
with 3.2% among control infants. 
186 
It is not known whether the risk 
related to head covering is due to 
overheating, hypoxia, or rebreathing.
Some have suggested that room 
ventilation may be important. One 
study found that bedroom heating, 
compared with no bedroom heating, 
increases SIDS risk (OR: 4.5), 
 
315 and 
another study showed a decreased 
risk of SIDS in a well-ventilated 
bedroom (windows and doors open; 
OR: 0.4). 
316 In 1 study, the use of a 
fan appeared to reduce the risk of 
SIDS (adjusted OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 
0.10–0.77). 
317 However, because of 
the possibility of recall bias, the small 
sample size of controls who used 
fans (n = 36), a lack of detail about 
the location and types of fans used, 
and the weak link to a mechanism, 
this study should be interpreted with 
caution. On the basis of available 
data, the task force cannot make a 
recommendation on the use of a fan 
as a SIDS risk-reduction strategy.
IMMUNIZATIONS
Infants should be immunized in 
accordance with AAP and Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
recommendations.
The incidence of SIDS peaks at a 
time when infants are receiving 
numerous immunizations. Case 
reports of a cluster of deaths shortly 
e17

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
after immunization with diphtheria-
tetanus toxoids-pertussis vaccine in 
the late 1970s created concern of a 
possible causal relationship between 
vaccinations and SIDS. 
318 
 
– 
321 Case-
control studies were performed to 
evaluate this temporal association. 
Four of the 6 studies showed no 
relationship between diphtheria-
tetanus toxoids-pertussis vaccination 
and subsequent SIDS322 
 
– 
325; the other 
2 suggested a temporal relationship, 
but only in specific subgroup 
analysis. 
326, 
327 In 2003, the Institute 
of Medicine reviewed available data 
and concluded the following: “The 
evidence favors rejection of a causal 
relationship between exposure to 
multiple vaccinations and SIDS.” 
328 
Several analyses of the US Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System 
database have shown no relationship 
between vaccines and SIDS. 
329 
– 
331 In 
addition, several large-population 
case-control trials consistently have 
found vaccines to be protective 
against SIDS332 
 
– 
335; however, 
confounding factors (social, maternal, 
birth, and infant medical history) may 
account for this protective effect. 
336 
It also has been theorized that the 
decreased SIDS rate immediately 
after vaccination was attributable 
to infants being healthier at the time 
of immunization, or “the healthy 
vaccinee effect.”337 Recent illness 
would both place infants at higher 
risk of SIDS and make them more 
likely to have immunizations 
deferred. 
338
Recent studies have attempted to 
control for confounding by social, 
maternal, birth, and infant medical 
history. 
332, 
 
334, 
 
338 A meta-analysis 
of 4 studies found a multivariate 
summary OR for immunizations and 
SIDS to be 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39–0.76), 
indicating that the risk of SIDS is 
halved by immunization. 
338 The 
evidence continues to show no causal 
relationship between immunizations 
and SIDS and suggests that 
vaccination may have a protective 
effect against SIDS.
COMMERCIAL DEVICES
Avoid the use of commercial 
devices that are inconsistent with 
safe sleep recommendations.
Risk-reduction strategies are based 
on the best-available evidence in 
large epidemiologic studies. These 
studies have been largely focused on 
the correlations between the sleep 
environment and SIDS. Our current 
understanding is that the cause 
of SIDS is multifactorial and that 
death results from the interaction 
between a vulnerable infant and 
a potentially asphyxiating sleep 
environment. Thus, claims that 
sleep devices, mattresses, or special 
sleep surfaces reduce the risk of 
SIDS must therefore be supported 
by epidemiologic evidence. At a 
minimum, any devices used should 
meet safety standards of the CPSC, 
the Juvenile Product Manufacturers 
Association, and ASTM International 
(known previously as the American 
Society for Testing and Materials). 
The AAP concurs with the US Food 
and Drug Administration and CPSC 
that manufacturers should not claim 
that a product or device protects 
against SIDS unless there is scientific 
evidence to that effect.
Wedges and positioning devices are 
often used by parents to maintain 
the infant in the side or supine 
position because of claims that these 
products reduce the risk of SIDS, 
suffocation, or gastroesophageal 
reflux. However, these products 
are frequently made with soft, 
compressible materials, which might 
increase the risk of suffocation. The 
CPSC has received reports of deaths 
attributable to suffocation and 
entrapment associated with wedges 
and positioning devices. Most of 
these deaths occurred when infants 
were placed in the prone or side 
position with these devices 
339; other 
incidents have occurred when infants 
have slipped out of the restraints or 
rolled into a prone position while 
using the device. 
240, 
 
340 Because of 
the lack of evidence that they are 
effective against SIDS, suffocation, or 
gastroesophageal reflux and because 
of the potential for suffocation and 
entrapment risk, the AAP concurs 
with the CPSC and the US Food and 
Drug Administration in warning 
against the use of these products. 
If positioning devices are used in 
the hospital as part of physical 
therapy, they should be removed 
from the infant sleep area well before 
discharge from the hospital.
Certain crib mattresses have been 
designed with air-permeable 
materials to reduce rebreathing 
of expired gases, in the event that 
an infant ends up in the prone 
position during sleep, and these 
may be preferable to those with air-
impermeable materials. With the use 
of a head box model, Bar-Yishay et al 
341 
found that a permeable sleeping 
surface exhibited significantly better 
aeration properties in dispersing 
carbon dioxide and in preventing its 
accumulation. They also found the 
measured temperature within the 
head box to be substantially lower 
with the more permeable mattress, 
concluding that it was due to faster 
heat dissipation. This finding could 
be potentially protective against 
overheating, which has been identified 
as a risk factor for SIDS. Colditz et al 
342 
also performed studies both in 
vitro and in vivo, showing better 
diffusion and less accumulation of 
carbon dioxide with a mesh mattress. 
However, Carolan et al 
343 found that 
even porous surfaces are associated 
with carbon dioxide accumulation 
and rebreathing thresholds unless 
there is an active carbon dioxide 
dispersal system. In addition, although 
rebreathing has been hypothesized 
to contribute to death in SIDS, 
particularly if the head is covered or 
when the infant is face down, there 
is no evidence that rebreathing, per 
se, causes SIDS and no epidemiologic 
evidence that these mattresses 
reduce the risk of SIDS. The use of 
“breathable” mattresses can be an

acceptable alternative as long as the 
other manufacturing requirements 
are met, including being designed for 
a particular crib, having a firm surface, 
and maintaining its shape even when 
the fitted sheet designated for that 
model is used, such that there are no 
gaps between the mattress and the 
side of the crib, bassinet, portable crib, 
or play yard.
HOME MONITORS, SIDS, AND BRIEF 
RESOLVED UNEXPLAINED EVENTS 
(FORMERLY APPARENT LIFE-
THREATENING EVENTS)
There is no evidence that apparent 
life-threatening events are 
precursors to SIDS. Furthermore, 
infant home cardiorespiratory 
monitors should not be used as a 
strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS.
For many years, it was believed 
that brief resolved unexplained 
events (BRUEs; formerly known as 
apparent life-threatening events 
[ALTEs]) were the predecessors of 
SIDS, and home apnea monitors were 
used as a strategy for preventing 
SIDS. 
344 However, the use of home 
cardiorespiratory monitors has 
not been documented to decrease 
the incidence of SIDS. 
345 
 
–348 Home 
cardiorespiratory monitors are 
sometimes prescribed for use at home 
to detect apnea and bradycardia 
and, when pulse oximetry is used, 
decreases in oxyhemoglobin 
saturation for infants at risk of these 
conditions. 
349 Routine in-hospital 
cardiorespiratory monitoring before 
discharge from the hospital has not 
been shown to detect infants at risk 
of SIDS. There are no data that other 
commercial devices that are designed 
to monitor infant vital signs reduce 
the risk of SIDS.
TUMMY TIME
Supervised, awake tummy time 
is recommended to facilitate 
development and to minimize 
development of positional 
plagiocephaly.
Positional plagiocephaly, or 
plagiocephaly without synostosis 
(PWS), can be associated with a 
supine sleeping position (OR: 2.5). 
350 
It is most likely to result if the infant’s 
head position is not varied when 
placed for sleep; if the infant spends 
little or no time in awake, supervised 
tummy time; and if the infant is 
not held in the upright position 
when not sleeping. 
350 
– 
352 Children 
with developmental delay and/or 
neurologic injury have increased rates 
of PWS, although a causal relationship 
has not been shown.350, 
 
353 
 
– 
356 In 
healthy normal children, the incidence 
of PWS decreases spontaneously 
from 20% at 8 months to 3% at 24 
months of age.351 Although data to 
make specific recommendations as to 
how often and how long tummy time 
should be undertaken are lacking, 
the task force concurs with the AAP 
Section on Neurologic Surgery that “a 
certain amount of prone positioning, 
or ‘tummy time, 
’ while the infant 
is awake and being observed is 
recommended to help prevent the 
development of flattening of the 
occiput and to facilitate development 
of the upper shoulder girdle strength 
necessary for timely attainment of 
certain motor milestones.” 
357 The 
AAP clinical report “Prevention and 
Management of Positional Skull 
Deformities in Infants” 
357 provides 
additional detail on the prevention, 
diagnosis, and management of 
positional plagiocephaly.
SWADDLING
There is no evidence to recommend 
swaddling as a strategy to reduce 
the risk of SIDS. Infants who are 
swaddled have an increased risk 
of death if they are placed in or roll 
to the prone position. If swaddling 
is used, infants should always be 
placed on the back. When an infant 
exhibits signs of attempting to roll, 
swaddling should no longer be used.
Many cultures and newborn 
nurseries have traditionally used 
swaddling, or wrapping the infant 
in a light blanket, as a strategy 
to soothe infants and, in some 
cases, to encourage sleep in the 
supine position. Swaddling, when 
done correctly, can be an effective 
technique to help calm infants and 
promote sleep. 
358, 
 
359
Some have argued that swaddling 
can alter certain risk factors for SIDS, 
thus reducing the risk of SIDS. For 
instance, it has been suggested that 
the physical restraint associated with 
swaddling may prevent infants placed 
supine from rolling to the prone 
position. 
358 One study suggested a 
decrease in SIDS rate with swaddling 
if the infant was supine, but notably, 
there was an increased risk of SIDS if 
the infant was swaddled and placed 
in the prone position. 
210 Although 
another study found a 31-fold 
increase in SIDS risk with swaddling, 
the analysis was not stratified by 
sleep position. 
196 Although it may be 
more likely that parents will initially 
place a swaddled infant supine, this 
protective effect may be offset by the 
12-fold increased risk of SIDS if the 
infant is either placed or rolls to the 
prone position when swaddled. 
210, 
359 
In addition, an analysis of CPSC data 
found that deaths associated with 
swaddling were most often attributed 
to positional asphyxia related to prone 
sleeping, and a large majority of sleep 
environments had soft bedding. 
360 
Thus, if swaddling is used, the infant 
should be placed wholly supine, and 
swaddling should be discontinued as 
soon as the infant begins to attempt to 
roll. Commercially available swaddle 
sacks are an acceptable alternative, 
particularly if the parent or caregiver 
does not know how to swaddle 
an infant with a conventional thin 
blanket. There is no evidence with 
regard to SIDS risk related to the arms 
swaddled in or out.
There is some evidence that 
swaddling may cause detrimental 
physiologic consequences. For 
example, it can cause an increase 
in respiratory rate,

swaddling can reduce the infant’s 
functional residual lung 
capacity. 
358, 
 
362, 
 
363 Tight swaddling 
can also exacerbate hip dysplasia if 
the hips are kept in extension and 
adduction, 
364 
 
– 
367 which is 
particularly important because some 
have advocated that the calming 
effects of swaddling are related to 
the “tightness” of the swaddling. 
In contrast, “loose” or incorrectly 
applied swaddling could result in 
head covering and, in some cases, 
strangulation if the blankets become 
loose in the bed. Swaddling may 
also possibly increase the risk of 
overheating in some situations, 
especially when the head is covered 
or there is infection. 
368, 
369 However, 
1 study found no increase in abdominal 
skin temperature when infants were 
swaddled in a light cotton blanket 
from the shoulders down. 
362
Impaired arousal has often been 
postulated as a mechanism 
contributing to SIDS, and several 
studies have investigated the 
relationship between swaddling 
and arousal and sleep patterns in 
infants. Physiologic studies have 
shown that, in general, swaddling 
decreases startling, 
 
361 increases sleep 
duration, and decreases spontaneous 
awakenings. 
370 Swaddling also 
decreases arousability (ie, increases 
cortical arousal thresholds) to a nasal 
pulsatile air-jet stimulus, especially in 
infants who are easily arousable when 
not swaddled. 
361 One study found 
decreased arousability in infants at 3 
months of age who were not usually 
swaddled and then were swaddled but 
no effect on arousability in routinely 
swaddled infants. 
361 In contrast, 
another study has shown infants to be 
more easily arousable370 and to have 
increased autonomic (subcortical) 
responses 
371 to an auditory stimulus 
when swaddled. 
371 Thus, although 
swaddling clearly promotes sleep and 
decreases the number of awakenings, 
the effects on arousability to an 
external stimulus remain unclear. 
Accumulating evidence suggests, 
however, that routine swaddling has 
only minimal effects on arousal. In 
addition, there have been no studies 
investigating the effects of swaddling 
on arousal to more relevant stimuli 
such as hypoxia or hypercapnia. 
Finally, there is no evidence with 
regard to SIDS risk related to the arms 
swaddled in or out.
In summary, it is recognized that 
swaddling is one of many child care 
practices that can be used to calm 
infants, promote sleep, and encourage 
the use of the supine position. 
However, there is no evidence to 
recommend routine swaddling as a 
strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. 
The risk of death is high if a swaddled 
infant is placed in or rolls to the prone 
position. If infants are swaddled, 
they should always be placed on the 
back. When an infant exhibits signs of 
attempting to roll, swaddling should 
no longer be used. Moreover, as many 
have advocated, swaddling must be 
correctly applied to avoid the possible 
hazards, such as hip dysplasia, 
head covering, and strangulation. 
Importantly, swaddling does not 
reduce the necessity to follow 
recommended safe sleep practices.
POTENTIAL TOXICANTS
There is no evidence 
substantiating a causal 
relationship between various 
toxicants to SIDS.
Many theories link various toxicants 
and SIDS. 
372 
– 
374 Although 1 ecological 
study found a correlation of the 
maximal recorded nitrate levels of 
drinking water with local SIDS rates 
in Sweden, 
 
375 no case-control study 
has shown a relationship between 
nitrates in drinking water and SIDS. 
Furthermore, an expert group in 
the United Kingdom analyzed data 
pertaining to a hypothesis that SIDS 
is related to toxic gases, such as 
antimony, phosphorus, or arsenic, 
being released from mattresses376, 
 
377 
and found the toxic gas hypothesis 
unsubstantiated. 
378 Finally, 2 
case-control studies found that 
wrapping mattresses in plastic to 
reduce toxic gas emission did not 
protect against SIDS. 
230, 
 
379
HEARING SCREENS
Current data do not support the 
use of newborn hearing screens as 
screening tests for SIDS.
One retrospective case-control 
study examined the use of newborn 
transient evoked otoacoustic emission 
hearing screening tests as a tool to 
identify infants at subsequent risk 
of SIDS. 
380 Infants who subsequent 
died of SIDS did not fail their hearing 
tests but, compared with controls, 
showed a decreased signal-to-noise 
ratio score in the right ear only, at 
frequencies of 2000, 3000, and 4000 
Hz. Methodologic concerns have been 
raised about the validity of the study 
methods used in this study, 
 
381, 
 
382 
and these results have not been 
substantiated by others. A larger, 
but non–peer-reviewed, report of 
hearing screening data in Michigan 
383 
and a peer-reviewed retrospective 
study in Hong Kong383, 
 
384 showed 
no relationship between hearing 
screening test results and SIDS cases. 
Until additional data are available, 
hearing screening should not be 
considered as a valid screening tool 
to determine which infants may be at 
subsequent risk of SIDS. Furthermore, 
an increased risk of SIDS should not 
be inferred from an abnormal hearing 
screen result.
EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS
Educational and intervention 
campaigns are often effective in 
altering practice.
Intervention campaigns for SIDS have 
been extremely effective, especially 
with regard to the avoidance of prone 
positioning. 
385 Furthermore, primary 
care–based educational interventions, 
particularly those that address 
caregiver concerns and misconceptions 
about safe sleep recommendations, 
e20

, number

can be effective in altering practice. 
For instance, addressing concerns 
about infant comfort, choking, 
and aspiration while the infant is 
sleeping supine is helpful. 
19, 
 
96, 
 
97, 
386 
However, many families report not 
receiving information consistent 
with AAP recommendations. When 
a nationally representative sample 
of mothers of young infants were 
asked about information received 
from their pediatricians, only 54.5% 
had received a recommendation to 
place their infant supine for sleep, 
19.9% had received information 
about appropriate sleep location, 
and 11.0% had received information 
about pacifier use. 
387 Primary care 
providers should be encouraged 
to develop quality-improvement 
initiatives to improve adherence to safe 
sleep recommendations among their 
patients.
In addition, modeling of unsafe sleep 
practices by health care and child care 
providers may increase the prevalence 
of these unsafe practices. 
388 
– 
390 
Modeling of unsafe practices may 
occur because professionals are not 
convinced of the utility of the safe 
sleep recommendations or have 
concerns about the supine sleep 
position, particularly with regard 
to infant comfort, choking, and 
aspiration. 
391 
 
– 
395 Interventions that 
address provider concerns 
are effective in improving 
behavior. 
391, 
396 
– 
398
MEDIA MESSAGES
Media and manufacturers should 
follow safe sleep guidelines in 
their messaging and advertising.
A recent study found that, in magazines 
targeted toward childbearing women, 
more than one-third of pictures of 
sleeping infants and two-thirds of 
pictures of infant sleep environments 
portrayed unsafe sleep positions 
and sleep environments. 
237 Media 
exposures (including movie, television, 
magazines, newspapers, and Web 
sites), manufacturer advertisements, 
and store displays affect individual 
behavior by influencing beliefs and 
attitudes. Frequent exposure to health-
related media messages can affect 
individual health decisions, 
 
399, 
 
400 
and media messages have been very 
influential in decisions regarding 
sleep position. 
101, 
104 Media and 
advertising messages contrary to safe 
sleep recommendations may create 
misinformation about safe sleep 
practices.
Media and manufacturer messaging 
and advertising should follow safe 
sleep guidelines in text, photos, 
and illustrations. In addition, 
public health departments and 
organizations that provide safe sleep 
information should review, revise, 
and reissue this information at least 
every 5 years to ensure that each 
generation of new parents receives 
appropriate information.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations for a safe 
infant sleeping environment to 
reduce the risk of both SIDS and 
other sleep-related infant deaths are 
specified in the accompanying policy 
statement.
