IMPORTANCE Limited data exist on clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who had
infective endocarditis after undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVE To determine the associated factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes
of patients who had infective endocarditis after TAVR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Infectious Endocarditis after TAVR International
Registry included patients with definite infective endocarditis after TAVR from 47 centers
from Europe, North America, and South America between June 2005 and October 2015.
EXPOSURE Transcatheter aortic valve replacement for incidence of infective endocarditis
and infective endocarditis for in-hospital mortality.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Infective endocarditis and in-hospital mortality after
infective endocarditis.
RESULTS A total of 250 cases of infective endocarditis occurred in 20 006 patients after TAVR
(incidence, 1.1% per person-year; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%; median age, 80 years; 64% men). Median
time from TAVR to infective endocarditis was 5.3 months (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-13.4
months). The characteristics associated with higher risk of progressing to infective endocarditis
after TAVR was younger age (78.9 years vs 81.8 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 per year; 95% CI,
0.94-0.99), male sex (62.0% vs 49.7%; HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13-2.52), diabetes mellitus (41.7% vs
30.0%; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.29), and moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (22.4% vs
14.7%; HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.28-3.28). Health care–associated infective endocarditis was present
in 52.8% (95% CI, 46.6%-59.0%) of patients. Enterococci species and Staphylococcus aureus
were the most frequently isolated microorganisms (24.6%; 95% CI, 19.1%-30.1% and 23.3%;
95% CI, 17.9%-28.7%, respectively). The in-hospital mortality rate was 36% (95% CI,
30.0%-41.9%; 90 deaths; 160 survivors), and surgery was performed in 14.8% (95% CI,
10.4%-19.2%) of patients during the infective endocarditis episode. In-hospital mortality was
associated with a higher logistic EuroSCORE (23.1% vs 18.6%; odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per 1%
increase; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05), heart failure (59.3% vs 23.7%; OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.74-6.45), and
acute kidney injury (67.4% vs 31.6%; OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.42-5.11). The 2-year mortality rate was
66.7% (95% CI, 59.0%-74.2%; 132 deaths; 115 survivors).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing TAVR, younger age, male sex,
history of diabetes mellitus, and moderate to severe residual aortic regurgitation were
significantly associated with an increased risk of infective endocarditis. Patients who
developed endocarditis had high rates of in-hospital mortality and 2-year mortality.

I
nfective endocarditis following surgical valve replacement
occurs in 1% to 6% of patients and is associated with high
morbidityandmortality.1Transcatheteraorticvalvereplace-
ment (TAVR) has emerged as a therapeutic option for patients
with aortic stenosis who are considered to be at high or pro-
hibitive surgical risk.2 The rate of infective endocarditis within
the year following TAVR has been reported to be 1.5%, ranging
from 0.5% to 3.1%,3,4 similar to infective endocarditis rates af-
tersurgicalvalvereplacement.5,6Greaterexposuretohealthcare
procedures,olderage,andaconsiderableamountofforeignma-
terial(eg,stentstruts)ofthetranscathetervalveprosthesesmay
have contributed to increase the risk of infective endocarditis
in such patients. To date, data on infective endocarditis after
TAVR have been limited to case reports and relatively small se-
ries with limited follow-up,3,4,7-10 demonstrating in-hospital
complication and mortality rates as high as 87% and 47%, re-
spectively.Valveexplantationratesinsuchpatientsremainrela-
tively low (<10%). It is therefore relevant to further investigate
the factors associated with and the clinical characteristics and
outcomes of infective endocarditis after TAVR.
The objective of this study was to determine the clinical
characteristics and outcomes of patients who develop infec-
tive endocarditis after undergoing TAVR.
Methods
Study Population and Clinical Data
The Infectious Endocarditis after TAVR International Regis-
tryretrospectivelycollecteddatafrompatientsdiagnosedwith
definiteinfectiveendocarditisafterTAVRfromatotalof47sites
fromEurope,NorthAmerica,andSouthAmericabetweenJune
2005 and October 2015 (Figure 1). Sites were contacted by the
senior investigator (J.R.C.) and invited to participate in the reg-
istry. Patients were included in the registry irrespective of the
valve affected. A dedicated case report form was used for data
collection that included baseline and periprocedural TAVR fea-
tures, as well as infective endocarditis characteristics and in-
hospital and follow-up outcomes. Only patients with definite
infective endocarditis were included, and only the first epi-
sode of infective endocarditis recorded for an individual pa-
tient was used in the analysis. In addition to the infective en-
docarditis data, all centers were asked to provide the total
number of patients who had undergone TAVR but did not had
infective endocarditis and had at least 1 year of follow-up.
A total of 31 centers provided individual data on baseline,
procedural,andfollow-upfeaturesfromtheentireTAVRpopu-
lation. All patients gave written informed consent before the
procedure(s), and all studies were performed in accordance
with the local ethics committee of each center. Local institu-
tionalreviewboardswaivedtheinformedconsentforthestudy
due to its retrospective and anonymous nature. Data on 118 pa-
tients (47%) included in the present study have been re-
ported in prior studies.3,4,8,11
Definitions
The definition of definite infective endocarditis was based
on the modified Duke criteria.12 Early infective endocarditis
was defined as any infective endocarditis occurring within
12 months following the TAVR procedure.1 Health care–
associated endocarditis was defined by a positive blood cul-
ture obtained from a patient at the time of hospital admission
or within 48 hours if the patient fulfilled any of the following
criteria13: (1) received intravenous therapy at home or re-
ceived wound care or specialized nursing care in the 30 days
before the bloodstream infection; (2) attended a hospital or
hemodialysis clinic or received chemotherapy in the 30 days
before the bloodstream infection; (3) was hospitalized in an
acute care hospital for 2 or more days in the 90 days before
the bloodstream infection; or (4) resided in a nursing home or
long-term care facility. Clinical events were defined accord-
ing to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria.14
Periannular complication was defined as the presence of an in-
tracardiac abscess, pseudoaneurysm, or fistula by transtho-
racicortransesophagealechocardiography.Othersystemicem-
bolizationwasdefinedasembolismtoanymajorarterialvessel,
excluding stroke. Persistent bacteriemia was defined as pre-
viously reported.12 Perioperative mortality risk was defined ac-
cording to the logistic EuroSCORE,15 which includes the fol-
lowing variables: age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, extracardiac arteriopathy, neurological dysfunction,
previouscardiacsurgery,renalfailure,activeendocarditis,criti-
cal preoperative state, unstable angina, left ventricle func-
tion, recent myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension,
emergency surgery, surgery other than isolated coronary ar-
tery bypass graft, surgery on thoracic aorta, and postinfarct
septal rupture.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD) or median
(interquartile range [IQR]) and categorical variables as per-
centages. Comparison between groups was performed using
the t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables
andχ2orFisherexacttestforcategoricalvariables.TheKaplan-
Meier method was used to estimate the 2-year mortality rate.
The factors associated with in-hospital death after index
infective endocarditis were assessed in the global study co-
hort. A multivariable logistic regression model was con-
structed. The candidate variables are presented in eAppen-
dix 1 in the Supplement. Variables exhibiting a P value<.10 in
Key Points
Question What are the clinical characteristics, management,
outcomes, and factors associated with infective endocarditis
after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)?
Findings In this multicenter registry that included 250 cases of
definite infective endocarditis after TAVR, the in-hospital mortality
was 36% and the 2-year mortality rate was 66.7%. In a subset of
108 cases of infective endocarditis after TAVR younger age, male
sex, history of diabetes mellitus, and moderate to severe residual
aortic regurgitation were significantly associated with an increased
risk of infective endocarditis.
Meaning Among patients undergoing TAVR, risk factors for
subsequent endocarditis were identified; mortality associated
with endocarditis was high.

the bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable
model(LogisticEuroSCORE[per1%increase],stroke,heartfail-
ure, and renal failure all during infective endocarditis hospi-
talization, and Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis). The model
fit was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve.
The factors associated with infective endocarditis after
TAVR were assessed from a subsample of centers that pro-
vided individual data from all patients who had undergone
TAVR irrespective of the occurrence of infective endocarditis.
A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was con-
structed. Event times were measured from the date of TAVR
to the date of diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The candi-
dates variables are presented in eAppendix 1 in the Supple-
ment. Variables exhibiting a P value <.10 in the bivariable
analysis were included in the multivariable model (age [per
1-year increase], sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure,
chronic pulmonary disease, orotracheal intubation, moderate
to severe residual aortic regurgitation). The model was
checked for violation of the proportional hazards assumption
by assessing log-minus-log survival plots and scales Schoen-
feld residuals. The validation was assessed by calculating the
Harrell C concordance coefficient.
For bivariable analysis, patients with missing data for
the covariate of interest were excluded. Missing data for each
covariate included in the models are presented in eAppendix
2 in the Supplement. Missing data were assumed to be miss-
ing at random and were dealt with through the multivariable
imputation using chained equations. The χ2 test of missing
completely at random was used to evaluate whether signifi-
cant differences existed between the means of different
missing-value patterns. The variables used to predict missing
values were selected on a clinical basis. Ten imputed data
sets for each model were created. To evaluate the potential
statistical effect of clusters (sites and countries) a sensitivity
analysis was performed comparing the multilevel models
(patients nested within centers and centers within countries)
estimates with the logistic regression and the Cox propor-
tional hazard model estimates before imputation. The fixed-
effects models were selected based on the similarity of the
estimations, the loss of statistical power associated with the
cluster size variability, and the limited number of patients per
center. The multivariable association model covariates were
summarized by reporting odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios
(HRs) with approximate 95% CIs. A 2-sided P < .05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. Data analyses were per-
formed using version 13.0 of the STATA statistical software
(StataCorp LP).
Results
Study Global Cohort
Definite infective endocarditis was diagnosed in 250 of
20 006 patients after having undergone TAVR (incidence,
1.1% per person-year; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%). The median time
between TAVR and the first symptoms was 5.3 months (IQR,
1.5-13.4 months). Early infective endocarditis occurred in
178 patients (71.2%; 95% CI, 65.6%-76.8%) for an incidence
of 0.9% (95% CI, 0.77%-1.03%), including 72 patients
(28.8%; 95% CI, 23.2%-34.4%) diagnosed within 2 months
of the procedure. The baseline and periprocedural charac-
teristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.
Factors Associated With Infective Endocarditis
The factors associated with infective endocarditis after
TAVR were evaluated in a subset of 6398 patients (indi-
vidual data available from 31 centers, including 6290
patients without and 108 patients with infective endocardi-
tis). The baseline clinical and periprocedural characteristics
according to the occurrence of infective endocarditis are
shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Patients with infective
endocarditis had a mean age of 78.9 years (95% CI, 77.6 to
80.2) vs 81.8 years (95% CI, 81.6 to 82.0; difference, −2.8
years; 95% CI, −4.2 to −1.4 years; P < .001). A total of 67

10.9%; 95% CI, 2.4% to 20.4%; P = .01). The percentage of
patients who received a self-expandable valve was not sig-
nificantly different between groups with 38.9% (95% CI,
29.7% to 48.1%) with and 43.5% (95% CI, 41.5% to 45.4%)
without infective endocarditis (difference, −4.6%; 95% CI,
−13.5% to 4.8%; P = .34).
Forty-four patients (59.3%) with vs 2347 (48.1%) with-
out infective endocarditis had general anesthesia with oro-
tracheal intubation during the TAVR (difference, 11.1%; 95%
CI, 1.6% to 20.0%; P = .02) and 22 (22.4%) with vs 770
(14.7%) without infective endocarditis experienced residual
moderate or severe aortic regurgitation after TAVR (differ-
ence, 7.8%; 95% CI, 0.6% to 17.0%; P = .03). Patients who
received a self-expandable valve were younger than those
who received a balloon-expandable valve (81.4 years vs 81.9
years; difference, −0.5 years; 95% CI, −0.9 to −0.1; P = .01].
There were no other significant differences in baseline or
procedural characteristics and outcomes according to the
type of valve. Performing the TAVR procedure in a catheter-
ization laboratory (vs operating room or hybrid operating
room, which has full catheterization laboratory hemody-
namic capability) was not more frequent among patients
who had infective endocarditis (80.6%; 95% CI, 73.0% to
88.0% among patients with vs 83.2%; 95% CI, 82.2% to
84.1% without infective endocarditis; difference, 2.6%; 95%
CI, −3.8% to 11.1%; P = .47). In multivariable analyses, age
(HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.99), male sex (HR, 1.69; 95% CI,
1.13 to 2.52), history of diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.52; 95% CI,
1.02 to 2.29), and the presence of a residual moderate or
severe aortic regurgitation (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.28)
were associated with increased risk of infective endocarditis
during follow-up (Table 2).
Clinical and Echocardiographic Characteristics
Clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of infec-
tive endocarditis after TAVR are shown in Table 3. The most
common symptoms at presentation were fever (80.4%; 95%
CI, 75.5%-85.3%) and acute heart failure (40.0%; 95% CI,
39.3%-51.7%). A possible source of bacteremia was identified
in 30.4% of patients (95% CI, 43.8%-56.2%). The most fre-
quent source of bacteremia was a soft tissue infection or pre-
sumed intravascular source, which was identified in 26 pa-
tients (10.4%, 95% CI, 6.6%-14.2%). Health care–associated
infective endocarditis was present in 132 patients (52.8%; 95%
CI, 46.6%-59.0%). Among the remaining 47.2% of patients
(95% CI, 41.0%-53.4%) without a health care–associated in-
fection, 74.6% (95% CI, 69.2%-80.0%) did not have any iden-
tifiable possible source of bacteremia.
Enterococcus species (24.6%; 95% CI, 19.1% to 30.1%) and
S aureus (23.8%; 95% CI, 17.9% to 28.7%) were the most com-
mon causative organisms, followed by coagulase-negative
staphylococci (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.0% to 21.6%). In patients
with early infective endocarditis, Enterococcus species was
the most frequent causative organism (24.7%; 95% CI, 19.3%
to 30.1%), followed by S aureus (21.9%; 95% CI, 16.8% to
27.0%). Among patients who underwent the procedure in the
catheterization laboratory, 24% were infected with the
Enterococcus species (95% CI, 16.3% to 33.1%) vs 29.8% of

or hybrid operating room (95% CI, 21.8% to 37.5%; difference,
5.0%; 95% CI, −6.7% to 16.4%; P = .30). Among those
infected with S aureus, 24.7% (95% CI, 16.3% to 33.1%) under-
went the procedure in the catheterization laboratory vs
27.5% (95% CI, 19.8% to 35.1%) who underwent the proce-
dure in the operating room or hybrid room (difference, 2.5%;
95% CI, −8.9% to 13.5%; P = .64). The causative organisms of
infective endocarditis for the entire study population are
shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Echocardiography revealed the presence of vegetations
in 165 patients (67.6%; 95% CI, 61.7%-73.5%), with a largest
mean (SD) size of 10.7 mm (7.5 mm). Vegetations were
anchored to the stent frame among 18.2% (30 of 165) of
patients (95% CI, 12.3%-24.1%) or anchored to the leaflets of
the transcatheter valve among 47.9% (79 of 165) of patients
(95% CI, 40.3%-55.5%) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Of the
patients who received a self-expandable valve, 26.2% (21 of
80) had vegetations within the stent frame vs 10.6% (9 of
85) who received balloon-expandable valves (difference,
15.6%; 95% CI, 3.8%-27.3%; P = .01), whereas 58.8% (50 of
85) of patients who received a balloon-expandable valve
had valve-leaflet level vegetation vs 36.2% (29 of 80)
patients who had received self-expandable valves (differ-
ence, 22.6%; 95% CI, 7.3%-26.2%; P = .02). Concomitant
mitral valve involvement was found in 50 patients (20.0%;
95% CI, 15.0%-25.0%), tricuspid in 11 (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.9%-
6.9%), and in pacemaker devices of 15 (6.0%; 95% CI, 3.1%-
8.9%). New moderate to severe mitral regurgitation was
observed in 34 patients (13.9%; 95% CI, 9.6%-18.2%), and
new moderate to severe aortic regurgitation was observed
in 24 patients (9.8%; 95% CI, 6.1-13.5). Periannular compli-
cations were diagnosed in 44 patients (18.0%; 95% CI,
13.2%-22.8%), including the presence of abscess (15.6%;
95% CI, 11.1%-20.1%), fistulas (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.2%),
and pseudoaneurysms (0.4%; 95% CI, 0%-1.2%) (eFigure 2

were observed in 160 patients (64.0%; 95% CI, 58.1%-
70.0%) and are summarized in Table 3. A total of 203
patients (81.2%; 95% CI, 76.4%-86.0%) had at least 1 indica-
tion for surgery. Surgery during the index hospitalization
was performed in 37 patients (14.8%; 95% CI, 10.4%-19.2%),
including surgical transcatheter valve explantation in 27
patients (10.8%; 95% CI, 6.9%-14.6%). Nonsurgical inter-
ventional treatment was performed in 10 patients (4%; 95%
CI, 1.6%-6.4%), including TAVR valve-in-valve implant
(1.2%; 95% CI, 0%-2.5%) and isolated pacemaker extraction
(2.8%; 95% CI, 0.8%-4.8%). The remaining 205 patients
(82.0%; 95% CI, 77.2%-86.8%) were treated with antibiotic
therapy alone. β-Lactam antibiotics alone were used in 38
patients (15.2%; 95% CI, 10.7%-19.6%), and in combination
with other antibiotics in 126 patients (50.4%; 95% CI,
44.2%-56.6%). Vancomycin was used alone or in combina-
tion with other antibiotics in 53 patients (21.2%; 95% CI,
16.1%-26.3%).

Discussion
Prosthetic valve endocarditis has been recognized as the most
severe form of infective endocarditis, occurring in 1% to 6%
of patients with valve prostheses, accounting for 10% to 30%
of all cases of infective endocarditis.1 The rate of infective en-
docarditis after TAVR observed in the present study is similar
to that reported for surgical prosthetic valve endocarditis,1
therefore, supports the lack of reduction in the rate of pros-
thetic valve infective endocarditis after TAVR despite less in-
vasive nature of TAVR compared with surgical valve replace-
ment. This study confirms the high rate of morbidity and
mortality of infective endocarditis after TAVR and provides
novel information about the timing, causative organisms, and
predictive factors of infective endocarditis in this particular
population. This information may help the clinicians identify
patientsathigherriskandaidinimplementingappropriatepre-
ventive measures.
Factors Associated With Infective Endocarditis
Although the median age of patients in the population was
80 years, patients who were younger were at increased
risk of infective endocarditis after TAVR. There is no clear
explanation for this finding. However, younger patients
considered at high or prohibitive surgical risk may exhibit a
higher comorbidity burden than their older counterparts.
This may have been associated with an increased risk of
infective endocarditis. Similarly, sex differences in comor-
bid conditions and outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR
may partially explain the higher risk of infective endocardi-
tis among male patients.16 Prior studies have already found
an association between diabetes and increased risk of infec-
tive endocarditis.17
Residual moderate or severe aortic regurgitation is associ-
ated with lower survival after TAVR.18 Aortic regurgitation
is associated with abnormal blood flow, turbulence, and

high-shear stress. This may predispose platelets and fibrin to
deposit resulting in nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis and
vegetations.19 These deleterious effects may play an impor-
tant role on the occurrence and maintenance of device
infection.20 Also, a higher valve calcification, which has been
associated with aortic regurgitation after TAVR, may also con-
tribute to the higher risk of infective endocarditis.21 These re-
sults suggest that a more aggressive approach by including an-
tibiotic prophylaxis (as recommended by current guidelines).
Reducingtheriskofbacteremiabyeradicatingunnecessarypro-
cedures and reinforcing the preventive measures could be con-
sidered for patients with significant aortic regurgitation after
TAVR. Other periprocedural TAVR features like transcatheter
valve type or orotracheal intubation were found to be factors
associated with infective endocarditis in prior smaller studies,3
but these findings were not confirmed in the current study,
which included a significantly larger series of patients.
Clinical, Microbiological, and Imaging Characteristics
The percentage of infective endocarditis within 60 days after
TAVR observed in our study (29%) contrasts with the 14% re-
portedbytheInternationalCollaborationonEndocarditis(ICE)
Prospective Cohort Study (PCS).22 These differences may be
secondary to both the higher-risk profile and the high burden
ofinstrumentationintheTAVRpopulation,suggestingtheneed
for a more cautious approach by avoiding unnecessary inva-
sive examinations and reinforcing the importance of main-
taining aseptic conditions during any invasive procedure to re-
duce the exposure to possible sources of bacteremia.
In contrast to prior studies on prosthetic valve infective
endocarditis,22 enterococci were the most frequent causative
microorganisms of infective endocarditis in the present study.
The rates of S aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci in-
fection were similar to those previously reported.22 Ad-
vancedage,chronicdiseases,andaorticvalvecalcificationhave
been associated with enterococcal infective endocarditis. This
may partially explain the higher proportion of enterococcal in-
fection in patients with TAVR than in their surgical prosthetic
valveinfectiveendocarditiscounterparts.Also,theuseoftrans-
femoral access in TAVR (enterococci are a frequent groin con-
taminant) and the high rate of enterococci infective endocar-
ditis within the 60 days following the procedure suggests the
need for antibiotic prophylaxis before the procedure and care-
ful infection control during and after the procedure. The high
prevalence of enterococci infective endocarditis should be
taken into consideration in the antibiotic selection while wait-
ing for the blood culture results in patients with suspicion of
infective endocarditis after TAVR. Also, the type of antibiotic
prophylaxis in such patients may be further evaluated in view
of the present findings. β-Lactam antibiotics were used as an-
tibiotic prophylaxis during TAVR procedures in most pa-
tients, but their efficacy in preventing enterococci infections
is limited; glycopeptides and aminoglycosides would seem a
better option in such cases.23
The presence of vegetations is in accordance with a prior
surgical prosthetic valve infective endocarditis series.22
Interestingly, vegetations attached to the stent frame were
found almost 3 times more frequently in patients who re-
ceived a self-expandable valve than those treated with a
balloon-expandable valve. The larger stent frame of self-
expandabledevicesmaypartiallyexplainsuchdifferences.Ad-
ditionally, the involvement of pacemaker devices in some in-
stances should be noted, particularly considering the high rate
of pacemaker implantation after TAVR. These features, which
are specific to transcatheter valves, should be taken into ac-
count when evaluating a patient with a clinical suspicion of
infective endocarditis after TAVR.
Outcomes and Management
The presence of heart failure and acute kidney injury during
an infective endocarditis episode and a higher surgical pre-
proceduralriskwereassociatedwithincreasedin-hospitalmor-
tality, regardless of the use of surgical therapy. Heart failure
was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality, confirm-
ing the significance of this complication in patients with in-
fective endocarditis after TAVR. A higher logistic EuroSCORE
was also associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death,
which reflects the influence of comorbidities on outcome fol-
lowing infective endocarditis in this high-risk population. The
67% mortality at the 2-year follow-up in this study seems to
be higher than that observed after prosthetic surgical valve en-
docarditis (27% to 61%).24,25 Although this may be partially ex-
plainedbythemoreadvancedageandhighercomorbiditybur-
den of the TAVR population, this mortality rate seems higher
than that observed 2 years after TAVR in patients at high sur-
gical risk (22% in the US pivotal trial for the self-expanding
valve26 and 34% in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter
Valves [PARTNER] trial27). This highlights the poor prognosis
of patients with infective endocarditis after TAVR.
Early surgery in patients with infective endocarditis and
severe valve dysfunction or large vegetations reduces the risk
ofin-hospitaldeathandembolicevents.28Inpatientswithpros-
thetic valve endocarditis, current guidelines recommend sur-
gical intervention with debridement and valve replacement
for patients with severe valve dysfunction, heart failure, car-
diac abscesses, highly resistant organisms, or persistent
bacteriemia.1,2 Lalani et al29 reported a valve surgery rate close
to 50% in a contemporary cohort of patients with prosthetic
valve endocarditis. This contrasts with the 10.8% rate of sur-
gery with valve explantation observed in our study despite the
very high rate (>80%) of patients with at least 1 indication for
surgery according to current guidelines. This very low rate of
valve surgery is likely secondary to the high or prohibitive sur-
gical risk of such patients, in addition to the potential techni-
cal difficulties of removing a stent frame adherent to the aorta.
However, and unlike prior studies, valve surgery was not as-
sociated with a mortality benefit in our study. Although this
may be related to a selection bias and the high surgical risk of
TAVR patients or to the limited number of patients who un-
derwent valve explantation, further studies need to address
the potential benefits of surgical therapy in this challenging
group of patients.

characteristics and outcomes, it represents an important
limitation when evaluating the incidence of infective endo-
carditis, their associated factors, source of entry, and
adequacy of preventive measures. Second, there was no
external monitoring or event adjudication committee to
verify the accuracy of the data reported by each center.
Third, the influence of confounding factors other than those
included in the multivariable models cannot be completely
excluded.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing TAVR, younger age, male sex,
history of diabetes mellitus, and moderate to severe
residual aortic regurgitation were significantly associated
with an increased risk of infective endocarditis. Patients
who developed endocarditis had a high rate of in-hospital
mortality and a low rate of surgical valve explantation.
