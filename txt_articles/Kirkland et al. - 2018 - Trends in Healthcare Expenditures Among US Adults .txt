Background-—One in 3 US adults has high blood pressure, or hypertension. As prior projections suggest hypertension is the
costliest of all cardiovascular diseases, it is important to define the current state of healthcare expenditures related to
hypertension.
Methods and Results-—We used a nationally representative database, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, to calculate the
estimated annual healthcare expenditure for patients with hypertension and to measure trends in expenditure longitudinally over a
12-year period. A 2-part model was used to estimate adjusted incremental expenditures for individuals with hypertension versus
those without hypertension. Sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status, census region, income, marital status, Charlson
Comorbidity Index, and year category were included as covariates. The 2003–2014 pooled data include a total sample of 224 920
adults, of whom 36.9% had hypertension. Unadjusted mean annual medical expenditure attributable to patients with hypertension
was $9089. Relative to individuals without hypertension, individuals with hypertension had $1920 higher annual adjusted
incremental expenditure, 2.5 times the inpatient cost, almost double the outpatient cost, and nearly triple the prescription
medication expenditure. Based on the prevalence of hypertension in the United States, the estimated adjusted annual incremental
cost is $131 billion per year higher for the hypertensive adult population compared with the nonhypertensive population.
Conclusions-—Individuals with hypertension are estimated to face nearly $2000 higher annual healthcare expenditure compared
with their nonhypertensive peers. This trend has been relatively stable over 12 years. Healthcare costs associated with
hypertension account for about $131 billion. This warrants intense effort toward hypertension prevention and management. (J Am

R
ecent national statistics suggest that between 30% and
50% of US adults have high blood pressure (BP), or
hypertension.1,2 This equates to an estimated over 85 million
adults in the United States.1 Despite improvements in
hypertension diagnosis, treatment, and control in recent
decades, only 54.4% of those with hypertension have their BP
controlled. Furthermore, it is estimated that the prevalence of
hypertension will increase by more than 9%, or �27 million
additional people, from 2010 to 2030.3 This is a significant
public health issue that continues to be on the rise.
Consequences of untreated and inadequately treated
hypertension are well documented and include risk of heart
disease, stroke, and renal failure. Despite public health
campaigns and an increased number of available antihyper-
tensive medications, BP-related mortality remains a signifi-
cant burden on the US population. Despite declining case
fatality rates,1 the number of deaths from elevated BP rose
43.6% in the 10 years leading up to 2009, likely related to
increasing prevalence and population size.4 Further, it is
estimated that treatment of hypertension, compared with
numerous other preventative services, would prevent the
largest number of deaths.5 This includes preventing more
deaths than mammography, colonoscopy, and Papanicolaou
testing combined.
The increasing prevalence of hypertension and BP-related
mortality may continue to drive the cost of cardiovascular

 disease upwards even in the setting of improving BP control
and treatment. As such, it is important to define the current
state of healthcare expenditures for patients with hyperten-
sion. Projections from 2001 to 2005 Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS) data suggest that hypertension is the
costliest of all cardiovascular diseases, with an estimated
direct cost of $69.9 billion in 2010.3 However, many prior
hypertension cost projections are limited because they
include hypertension in an aggregate definition of cardio-
vascular disease, making it difficult to parse out costs
related to hypertension versus those from stroke or heart
failure.6 Additionally, prior work has used older data to
project into the future rather than analyzing trends in
expenditure over time.3
In the present study, we used a nationally representative
database to calculate the estimated annual healthcare
expenditure for patients with hypertension. We also mea-
sured the trends in expenditures longitudinally over a
12-year period. Through the use of MEPS, the data
presented herein represent the most complete and detailed
cost information available and reflect expenditures based
on actual payments. Our analysis has the advantage of
using a large sample size and pooled data updated as of
2014.
Finally,
the
cost
methodology
of
this
analysis
involves a 2-part model, which optimizes accuracy of
reporting and interpretation.
Methods
Data Source and Sample
All data and materials are publicly available at the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and MEPS files
(documentation, codebook, programming statement, and data
sets) can be accessed via the internet.7 The Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey-Household Components (MEPS-
HC) 2003–2014 was used for this study. MEPS is a survey of
a nationally representative US civilian noninstitutionalized
population administered by the AHRQ.7–9 MEPS provides
estimates of healthcare use, expenditures, source of payment,
and health insurance coverage. In this study, we used the
total medical cost in MEPS defined as the sum of direct
payments for care (inpatient hospitalization stays, outpatient
visits, prescription medicines, emergency department visits,
dental visits, home health care, and others) provided during
the year, including out-of-pocket payments and payments by
private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources.9
Information on the MEPS-HC is collected by self-report, and
the Medical Provider Component requests data on medical
and financial characteristics from hospitals, physicians, home
healthcare providers, and pharmacies in order to validate
and supplement information received from the MEPS-HC
respondents.10 There were 83 018 unweighted observations,
which represent a weighted US population of 68 420 747
adults (aged ≥18 years) with hypertension.
Diagnoses coded according to International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
are
also
collected
as
part
of
the
Medical
Provider
Component.9
The
medical
conditions
and
procedures
reported by the MEPS-HC related to disease conditions
were recorded by an interviewer as verbatim text and then
converted by professional coders to ICD-9-CM codes. The
error rate for any coder did not exceed 2.5% on verification.
To protect the confidentiality of respondents, fully specified
ICD-9-CM codes were collapsed to 3 digits.9 We merged
data from the HC survey of the medical condition files and
full-year consolidated files using a 1-to-1 match.9 We pooled
12-year data to ensure sufficient sample size and to increase
precision of our estimates. Costs were inflated to the recent
estimate of 2016-dollar value using the Consumer Price
Index.11 MEPS provides data for examining person-level and
household-level changes in selected variables such as health
service use and expenditures.7 Our study accounts for the
complex survey design (sampling weights, clustering, and
stratification) in order to estimate the nationally represen-
tative aggregate and incremental healthcare expenditure for
the US population.7 This study was deemed exempt from
institutional review board approval and informed consent
was waived as MEPS is comprised of publicly available and
deidentified data files.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• National medical costs associated with hypertension are
estimated to account for about $131 billion in annual
healthcare expenditure averaged over 12 years from 2003
to 2014.
• Individuals with hypertension face nearly $2000 higher
annual healthcare expenditure compared with their nonhy-
pertensive peers.
• The incremental cost associated with hypertension for US
adults has remained steady from 2003 to 2014.
• Expenditures associated with hypertension seem to be
shifting from inpatient to outpatient settings.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• We must identify effective strategies to improve control of
chronic diseases that are associated with high annual
expenditures.
• These efforts may focus on expanded access to preventative
care services.
• For hypertension specifically, there may be a growing role
for non–office-based care delivery such as telemonitoring of
home measurements and 24-hour ambulatory blood pres-
sure monitoring.

 Measures
Dependent and primary independent variables
The dependent variable in this study was total healthcare
expenditure, defined as a sum of office-based medical
provider expenditure, hospital outpatient expenditure, emer-
gency department expenditure, inpatient hospital expenditure,
prescription medicine expenditure, dental expenditure, home
healthcare expenditure, and other medical expenses.7 The
primary independent variable was hypertension. To identify
patients with hypertension, we used ICD-9-CM or self-
report.12 The ICD-9-CM codes of hypertension from MEPS
include 401.xx.9,13 Self-reported hypertension diagnosis was
based on a positive response when asked whether the
respondent had ever been diagnosed as having “high blood
pressure (hypertension)”.7
Covariates
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status, census
region, income, marital status, adapted Charlson Comorbidity
Index (CCI),14 and year category were included as covariates
in estimating the adjusted expenditure attributable to hyper-
tension. Race/ethnicity was coded into 4 groups: non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanic, and other.
Marital status was included because of its known impact as a
socioeconomic factor associated with mortality risk and was
coded into: married, nonmarried (widowed/divorced/sepa-
rated), and never married.15,16 The adapted CCI was devel-
oped using the 3-digit collapsed ICD-9-CM codes available in
MEPS, which correspond to ICD-9-CM codes of D’Hoore
et al.14 This was incorporated to account for variance and
complexity of comorbid disease and sequelae of hypertension
that may influence overall healthcare expenditure. The CCI is
a weighted score of 17 conditions including myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular dis-
ease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary
disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer disease, mild liver
disease, hemiplegia (weight 1), moderate or severe renal
disease, diabetes mellitus, any tumor, leukemia, lymphoma
(weight 2), moderate or severe liver disease (weight 3), and
metastatic solid tumor (weight 6). The CCI was grouped into 3
categories: 0, 1, and ≥2.
Statistical Analyses
We compared demographic characteristics of the study
population with and without hypertension using chi-square
test. Unadjusted mean expenditures were used to compare
the total healthcare expenditure by hypertension status over
time. Standard pairwise comparison methods of Sidak,
Scheffe, and Bonferroni were used to compare the trends of
the unadjusted cost (total, inpatient, outpatient, prescription,
emergency department, and home health care) differences for
hypertension across time.17
A 2-part model was used in estimating the adjusted
incremental expenditure for individuals with hypertension
versus those without hypertension. In the 2-part model, the
probit model was used to calculate the probability of zero
versus nonzero medical expenditures followed by a general-
ized linear model used to estimate the adjusted association of
total medical expenditures conditional on a positive medical
expenditure. Two-part models can accommodate situations
with a high concentration of zeros, such as expenditure data.
To address the positive skewness of the expenditure variable,
we used a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution
and a log-link function.18,19 The use of a generalized linear
model in the second part of the model has an advantage over
log ordinary least squares since it relaxes the normality and
homoscedasticity assumptions and avoids bias associated
with retransforming to the raw scale.19 Using the variance
inflation factor test, and taking into account the complex
survey design, it was determined that no multicollinearity
problems existed between predictors of the 2-part model. The
2-part models also estimate the marginal effects and standard
errors from the first and second part of the 2-part model.19
Analysis for the nationally representative medical expendi-
tures was performed at the person-level using STATA 14
(StataCorp). Statistically significant estimates at 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) are discussed.
Results
Demographic Characteristics
The total adult sample in the pooled data from years 2003–
2014 included 224 920 respondents, of whom 83 018
(36.9%) had hypertension (Table 1). The sample of patients
with hypertension represented a weighted population of
68 420 747 US adults. Adults in the following groups were
more likely than not to have hypertension: age 45 years or
older,
male,
non-Hispanic
black,
married
or
previously
married, high school or less education, publicly insured, from
the south region, poor or low income, and ≥1 CCI conditions.
Prevalence of hypertension was higher in years 2007–2010
and 2011–2014 compared with the reference years 2003–
2006.
Trends of Unadjusted Cost Differences for
Hypertension
The unadjusted mean annual medical expenditure (all inflated
to 2016 US dollars) attributable to patients with hypertension
was $9089 (95% CI, $8900–$9278) in the pooled 12-year
data. Relative to individuals without hypertension ($4172

unadjusted hospital inpatient medical expenditure continu-
ously decreased over time, the unadjusted outpatient medical
expenditure, emergency department visit cost, and home
healthcare expenditure continuously increased (Figure 1).
Unadjusted prescription medication expenditure remained
relatively stable, with an initial decrease from 2003/2006 to
2007/2010 followed by a slight increase in 2011/2014.
Pairwise comparison tests showed that only the trend of
unadjusted emergency department expenditure was statisti-
cally and significantly changed over time.
The annual unadjusted mean expenditure by health
services for individuals with hypertension and without hyper-
tension is shown in Figure 2. Both the hospital inpatient cost
and the outpatient cost of hypertension were �$2700 per
year, accounting for the largest components of the total
medical expenditure. In comparison, the annual hospital
inpatient cost and the annual outpatient cost were less than
half of this amount for individuals without hypertension
($1093 and $1542, respectively). Annual prescription medi-
cation expenditure was $2371 for individuals with hyperten-
sion versus only $814 for those without hypertension.
Adjusted Incremental Cost and Estimated US
Burden for Hypertension
The adjusted incremental cost for hypertension per person
using CCI is shown in Table 2 (see Table S2 for incremental
cost
adjusted
for
individual
comorbid
conditions).
The
adjusted incremental expenditure for individuals with hyper-
tension is estimated to be $1920 (95% CI, $1724–$2117), as
compared with individuals without hypertension in a given
year. Finally, we extrapolated adjusted annual incremental
cost based on the estimated burden of hypertension for the
entire US population. Averaged over 12 years, the estimated
annual incremental cost for the total US population with
hypertension was $131 billion per year higher than the cost
for the US population without hypertension.
Discussion
Individuals with hypertension are estimated to face nearly
$2000 higher annual healthcare expenditure compared with
their nonhypertensive peers. This trend has been relatively
stable over a 12-year period and is based on data from a
nationally representative database. Relative to individuals
without hypertension, individuals with hypertension had �2.5
times the inpatient cost, nearly twice the outpatient cost, and
nearly triple the prescription medication expenditure. Trend
analysis suggests that, from 2003 to 2014, inflation-adjusted
inpatient medical expenditures for patients with hypertension
actually declined, while outpatient and home-based expendi-
tures increased somewhat. This may reflect decreases in
hospitalization rates, shorter lengths of stay, fewer proce-
dures such as cardiac catheterizations, or decreased read-
missions for complications, as has been shown for other
chronic medical disease states in recent years including for
heart failure.1,20 The trend may also signal the positive
impacts associated with improvements in hypertension diag-
nosis, treatment, and control in recent decades, marking a
shift towards preventative rather than reactive care.
These findings temporally correlate with expanded access to
preventative and outpatient-based services for chronic disease
states provided by the Affordable Care Act. As screening for
hypertension increases through improved access to preventa-
tive care services, patients with less comorbid disease and
lower overall health costs will enter the hypertensive cohort.
This may lower the average individual healthcare expenditure
yet initially raise the overall societal costs through increased
hypertension treatment. Over time, one would expect overall
societal costs to decrease by avoiding or delaying comorbid
disease or complications. Recent lowering of the BP threshold
for hypertension diagnosis to a systolic reading of 130 mm Hg
is predicted to have similar effects on expenditure estimates
through increased prevalence.
When accounting for the prevalence of hypertension in our
society, our work suggests that hypertension is associated
with about $131 billion per year in population-level expendi-
tures in the United States. Both our data and that of
Heidenreich et al3 represent significantly greater annual costs
of hypertension compared with the estimates provided by the
American Heart Association’s 2017 Update on Heart Disease
and Stroke Statistics, in which the estimated direct and
indirect cost of hypertension for 2012–2013 was reported to
be $51.2 billion. These differences may relate to differences
in prevalence estimates. Our work estimates that 68 million
US adults have hypertension, with an increase over time from
27.9% in 2003/2006 to 37.8% in 2011/2014 (Table 1). This
contrasts with Benjamin and colleagues’1 prevalence estimate
of 88 million adults, which was also based on MEPS data
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute tabulation). The
difference in these numbers is likely related to study
methodology. In both cases, a sample of the US population
was used to extrapolate the overall prevalence rate for the
country. Any difference in sample prevalence would lead to
amplified differences in estimated overall prevalence. This is
particularly relevant with regards to the population older than

 65 years as this group represents over 19% of our sample, yet
2016 US Census data report that 15.3% of the population falls
into this age group. Additionally, the US population increased
from 217 million adults in 2003 to 245 million adults in
2014. Benjamin and colleagues based their total population
on 2014 census data, while our work utilized the average US
population during the survey years 2003–2014 as the overall
population per year. As such, our total population estimate
would be lower than that of Benjamin et al, accounting for
some of the total population difference. The methodology of
the study by Benjamin et al is not reported, thus further
conclusions cannot be drawn. MEPS does not include the
institutionalized population, which may also contribute to a
lower estimate of total population hypertension prevalence in
our sample.
Despite differences in prevalence estimates and overall
population costs of hypertension, the same report by
Benjamin et al also cites an expected $130.4 billion increase
in annual direct costs of hypertension over 20 years, resulting
in a total annual cost of over $200 billion by 2030.1 This is in
line with our estimates of overall national health expenditures.
It is important to note that this calculation by Benjamin et al

 was based on the methodology set forth by Heidenreich and
colleagues who report findings similar to ours.3
Rising healthcare expenditures are likely a result of several
factors. First, the prevalence of hypertension is steadily
increasing with time. This may be in part attributable to
diagnosed adults living longer as well as more adults being
diagnosed and at younger ages. National healthcare expen-
ditures, accordingly, will increase as the prevalence increases.
Additionally, as adults live longer with hypertension, they are
likely to be diagnosed with other comorbid illness, such as
congestive heart failure or renal disease. These comorbidities
drive incremental medical expenditures and may lead to
higher expenditures. This is supported by the finding that the
incremental cost for adults 65 years and older is almost
$2500 more than for adults aged 18 to 44 years (Table 2).
With specific regards to prescription medication expendi-
ture, the calculated annual expenditure was $2371 for
individuals with hypertension compared with $814 for those
without hypertension. The trend over time reveals a slight
decline in annual prescription expenditures for patients with
hypertension. Eighth Joint National Committee guidelines
published in 2014 may account for some decrease in
prescription costs as there may have been less aggressive
treatment of BP in response to more liberal BP targets for
older adults. Increasing emphasis on lifestyle modification to
control BP may also lead to fewer drug costs and perhaps
fewer office visits. On the other hand, the recently published
2017 guidelines may lead to higher prescription costs related
to more aggressive treatment.2 Additionally, the results may
reflect more affordable drug prices with a shift towards
greater reliance on generic formulations and “$4 lists.” Again,
the annual prescription expenditures only slightly decreased
over time, suggesting that other factors counteracted any
significant decline in cost. These may include greater access
to care resulting in more adults receiving prescription
medication or additional cost incurred for medications used
to treat comorbid conditions related to hypertension.
Overall, these results may provide reason for optimism. As
improvements in patient access to care and prescription
medication availability converge with enhanced diagnosis and
treatment of hypertension, decreased high cost utilization of
inpatient resources may offset climbing expenses for outpa-
tient care.
Strengths and Limitations
The work herein presents the most updated estimate of
healthcare expenditures for patients with hypertension and
demonstrates stable total expenditures over time. In addition
to providing up-to-date cost data and trends over time, this
work is notable for the robust data set, which allows pooling
of data to reflect the overall US population. Finally, the cost
methodology utilized in this analysis is a significant strength
of this work. The 2-part model accounts for differentiation of
zero values from nonzero values through a probit model and
generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and a log-
link also accounts for positive skewness that is not as well
accounted for in other studies.
Despite these notable strengths, this work is based on
observational, cross-sectional data, predisposing it to inherent
bias. Neither institutionalized patients nor military members
are included in the cost estimation as these populations are
not included in MEPS data. The former population is generally
considered high cost and thus exclusion may lead to
underestimation of overall healthcare expenditures, while
the latter military population is generally younger and a lower

 utilizer of health care, leading to possible underestimation of
expenditures. Additionally, the data used in this analysis relied
on self-report of comorbid chronic medical conditions, which
are vulnerable to response, social desirability, and recall
biases. Pooled data were used, reducing accuracy of preva-
lence estimates and thus population-level cost analyses. Also,
it is difficult to categorize by disease severity in this study, as
the data set does not include quantitative values (BPs) or
subgroups of diagnosis codes (malignant versus benign
hypertension). These limitations are inherent to the database
and are deemed acceptable given the robust nature of the
sample size, follow-up period, and cost data, which make
MEPS the most appropriate data set for this work.
Conclusions
Hypertension is recognized as a tremendous threat to medical
and financial health. National medical costs associated with
hypertension account for about $131 billion, or over 3% of the
$3 trillion US national healthcare expenditure. While the
incremental cost associated with hypertension for US adults
has remained steady around $2000 per year, it is promising
that expenditures seem to be shifting from inpatient to
outpatient settings. This may reflect the expansion of
preventative care services for millions of Americans under
the Affordable Care Act. As overall US healthcare costs
continue to rise,21 it is imperative that we identify effective
strategies to improve control of chronic diseases that are
associated with high annual expenditures. For hypertension,
these efforts may focus on expanded access to preventative
care services and continued innovation for non–office-based
care delivery such as telemonitoring of home measurements
and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.
