 Effect of Hydrolyzed Infant Formula vs Conventional Formula
on Risk of Type 1 Diabetes
The TRIGR Randomized Clinical Trial
Writing Group for the TRIGR Study Group
IMPORTANCE Early exposure to complex dietary proteins may increase the risk of type 1
diabetes in children with genetic disease susceptibility. There are no intact proteins in
extensively hydrolyzed formulas.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula
decreases the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes in young children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An international double-blind randomized clinical trial
of 2159 infants with human leukocyte antigen–conferred disease susceptibility and a
first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes recruited from May 2002 to January 2007 in 78
study centers in 15 countries; 1081 were randomized to be weaned to the extensively
hydrolyzed casein formula and 1078 to a conventional formula. The follow-up of the
participants ended on February 28, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS The participants received either a casein hydrolysate or a conventional
adapted cow’
s milk formula supplemented with 20% of the casein hydrolysate. The minimum
duration of study formula exposure was 60 days by 6 to 8 months of age.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was type 1 diabetes diagnosed according
to World Health Organization criteria. Secondary outcomes included age at diabetes
diagnosis and safety (adverse events).
RESULTS Among 2159 newborn infants (1021 female [47.3%]) who were randomized, 1744
(80.8%) completed the trial. The participants were observed for a median of 11.5 years
(quartile [Q] 1-Q3, 10.2-12.8). The absolute risk of type 1 diabetes was 8.4% among those
randomized to the casein hydrolysate (n = 91) vs 7.6% among those randomized to the
conventional formula (n = 82) (difference, 0.8% [95% CI, −1.6% to 3.2%]). The hazard ratio
for type 1 diabetes adjusted for human leukocyte antigen risk group, duration of
breastfeeding, duration of study formula consumption, sex, and region while treating study
center as a random effect was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.5; P = .46). The median age at diagnosis of
type 1 diabetes was similar in the 2 groups (6.0 years [Q1-Q3, 3.1-8.9] vs 5.8 years [Q1-Q3,
2.6-9.1]; difference, 0.2 years [95% CI, −0.9 to 1.2]). Upper respiratory infections were the
most common adverse event reported (frequency, 0.48 events/year in the hydrolysate group
and 0.50 events/year in the control group).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among infants at risk for type 1 diabetes, weaning to
a hydrolyzed formula compared with a conventional formula did not reduce the cumulative
incidence of type 1 diabetes after median follow-up for 11.5 years. These findings do not
support a need to revise the dietary recommendations for infants at risk for type 1 diabetes.

ype 1 diabetes is considered to be a chronic immune-
mediated disease characterized by selective loss of
insulin-producing β cells in the pancreatic islets in
genetically susceptible individuals. Overt clinical disease is
preceded by an asymptomatic period of highly variable
duration during which diabetes-associated autoantibodies
appear in the peripheral circulation as markers of emerging
β-cell autoimmunity.1,2 Several disease-related autoantibod-
ies predict clinical type 1 diabetes, including classic islet cell
antibodies (ICAs), insulin autoantibodies (IAAs), and auto-
antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD); the tyro-
sine phosphatase-related insulinoma-associated 2 molecule
(IA-2); and zinc transporter 8.2 In natural history studies
from infancy, positivity for 2 or more autoantibodies signals
a risk of approximately 70% for the development of clinical
diabetes over the subsequent 10 years.3
The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing at an
accelerating rate among children in North America and in
most European countries.4,5 Accumulating evidence sug-
gests that β-cell autoimmunity emerges early in life.6,7
Accordingly, any measure aimed at primary prevention of
type 1 diabetes (ie, prevention of the initiation of the dia-
betic disease process) has to be initiated in infancy. In addi-
tion, there is a growing body of data suggesting that factors
affecting the emergence of autoimmunity may be different
from those associated with progression from autoimmunity
to diabetes.8,9
Some epidemiological and immunological studies sug-
gest that exposure to complex foreign proteins in early
infancy may increase the risk of β-cell autoimmunity and
type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible individuals,10-12
although others do not.13,14 In our previous study, weaning
to an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula did not de-
crease the cumulative incidence of diabetes-associated
autoantibodies by 7 years of age in at-risk children.15 This
article reports on the intervention effect on diabetes inci-
dence by 11.5 years of age in the TRIGR (Trial to Reduce
Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in the Genetically at
Risk) Study.
Methods
Study Design
A randomized, double-blind study was conducted in 78
study centers from 15 countries as previously described.16
The study protocol is available in Supplement 1. Newborn
infants who had a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes
and defined human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes
were recruited between May 2002 and January 2007 and
followed up until the youngest participant reached 10 years
of age in February 2017. Randomization of the infants who
met the inclusion criteria took place before birth or immedi-
ately after birth (Figure 1). Randomization was stratified by
study center, with a block size of 4. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from the family before enrollment. The
study was approved by the ethics committees of all partici-
pating centers.
Dietary Intervention
Infants were randomly assigned weaning to either the inter-
vention or control formulas, which were produced specifi-
cally for this study. Randomization was carried out in each
strata within 4 blocks. The intervention formula was an
extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula, while the
control formula was composed of 80% intact cow’
s milk
protein and 20% hydrolyzed milk protein and formulated so
that the taste and smell would be indistinguishable from the
intervention formula. Study formulas were prepared and
coded with the use of 4 colors by Mead Johnson Nutritional
and were blinded to all investigators except the data man-
agement unit. Newborn infants requiring supplemental
feeding before randomization (eg, infants born at night or
on weekends) received banked breast milk or Nutramigen,
an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula.
Breastfeeding was practiced at the discretion of the par-
ticipating mothers, and maternal diets were unmodified.
Breastfeeding was encouraged and exceeded national aver-
ages in both groups.17 The dietary intervention period lasted
until the infant was at least 6 months of age and, if by that
time the child had not received the study formula for at
least 60 days, study formula feeding was continued until 60
days of study formula exposure was reached, but not
beyond 8 months of age. Parents were asked not to feed the
children any commercial or other baby foods containing
bovine protein during the intervention period. Adherence to
the protocol was monitored by means of regular family
nutrition interviews (at the age of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
months) and by the analysis of cow’
s milk antibodies in
serum samples.
HLA Genotyping
Cord blood or a heel stick blood sample collected on filter
paper shortly after birth was immediately sent to the Turku
(Europe and Australia) or Pittsburgh (North America) labo-
ratories for HLA genotyping. HLA genotyping for the
selected DQB1 and DQA1 alleles was performed using
sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, with
quality control between the 2 laboratories carefully main-
tained. The following genotypes were regarded as eligible:
(1) HLA DQB1*02/DQB1*03:02 (high risk); (2) HLA DQB1*03:
Key Points
Question Does weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula
decrease the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes in children
at risk?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 2159
children with human leukocyte antigen–conferred susceptibility to
type 1 diabetes and at least 1 affected family member, weaning to a
hydrolyzed formula compared with a conventional formula did not
significantly decrease the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes
after a median of 11.5 years (8.4% vs 7.6%).
Meaning Weaning to a hydrolyzed formula did not reduce the risk
of type 1 diabetes in children with an increased disease risk.

β-Cell Autoimmunity
ICAs were detected using indirect immunofluorescence.
The other 3 autoantibodies were quantified with the use of
specific radiobinding assays in the Scientific Laboratory, Chil-
dren’
s Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,
with cutoff limits for positivity of 2.5 JDF units for ICAs, 2.80
relative units (RU) for IAA, 5.36 RU for GAD autoantibodies,
and 0.77 RU for IA-2 autoantibodies.18 The disease sensitivity
and specificity of the ICA assay were 100% and 98%, respec-
tively, in the fourth round of the international workshops on
standardization of the ICA assay. According to the Diabetes
Autoantibody Standardization Program and the International
Autoantibody Standardization Program workshop results in
2002-2016, the disease sensitivities of the IAA, GAD autoan-
tibody, and IA-2 autoantibody radiobinding assays were 42%
to 62%, 70% to 92%, and 62% to 80%, respectively. The cor-
responding disease specificities were 93% to 99%, 90% to
98%, and 93% to 100%, respectively.
Outcomes
The primary end point was the diagnosis of diabetes accord-
ing to World Health Organization criteria.19 According to
those criteria, the diagnosis is based on (1) symptoms + a
single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or greater
(to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555) or (2) if no symp-
toms, the diagnosis requires a raised random plasma glucose
reading of 200 mg/dL or greater on 2 occasions, a raised fast-
ing plasma glucose reading of 126 mg/dL or greater, or a dia-
betic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, fasting venous
plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL and/or a 2-hour venous plasma
glucose ≥200 mg/dL) on 2 occasions. OGTTs were performed
by protocol on all study participants who had not been previ-
ously diagnosed at 6 and 10 years of age and at study end.
Additional OGTTs were performed as clinically indicated. All
diagnosed cases were centrally reviewed.

 Adverse Events
Undesirable experiences occurring to a child during the trial,
whether or not considered related to the investigational
product, were reported as adverse events. Serious adverse
events were reviewed centrally by the safety monitoring
group for this study and were reported annually in tabular
form to an external data safety and monitoring board, which
reviewed each serious adverse event individually.
Statistical Analyses
The cumulative incidence of diabetes onset from the time of
randomization within each group was estimated using a
modified Kaplan-Meier diabetes-free survival function. The
difference between groups in the cumulative incidence
functions, and the associated hazard functions, was tested
using the Mantel–log rank test on discrete time to type 1 dia-
betes (6-month intervals). The relative risk of diabetes onset
between groups was estimated from the discrete Cox pro-
portional hazard model.20 The proportionality assumption
of the Cox proportional hazard model was tested. First, the
Schoenfeld residuals were examined to determine whether
there was an association with time. Second, the interaction
of parameters of interest and time were included in the mod-
els and tested for significance. For treatment and the vari-
ables used in the adjusted models, the null hypothesis of
proportionality failed to be rejected. The analyses were
adjusted for HLA risk, duration of breastfeeding, duration of
study formula consumption, sex, and region, while treating
study center as a random effect. The critical value for the
test statistic (P = .047) and confidence intervals in this pri-
mary analysis were adjusted for multiple looks, which took
place during the trial and were based on the Lan and
DeMets21 spending function. When comparing data between
the 2 study groups, the t test was applied for normally dis-
tributed variables and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
U test for skewed variables.
The effects of weaning to the casein hydrolysate vs con-
ventional formula were tested using the intention-to-treat
principle including all HLA-eligible participants who were
randomized to a treatment group. Tests of significance
reported herein were 2-tailed. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). No imputation
for missing values was performed; rather, observations with
relevant missing values were excluded from respective
analyses. The analysis of diabetes risk was also performed
according to treatment received (per-protocol analysis). Par-
ticipants were included in this analysis if they had exposure
to the study formula for 60 days or longer and were not
exposed to nonallowed foods. This study was designed such
that given a confidence level of 95%, an estimated cumula-
tive incidence of diabetes of 7.6% by the age of 10 years in
the control group and an expected dropout rate of 20% by
10 years and a frequency of 10% of exclusive breastfeeding
(up to age of 6 months), the study would have 80% power to
detect a 40% change in the end point. As a post hoc analy-
sis, the hazard ratio of the treatment groups was also calcu-
lated after adjusting for the age at which multiple autoanti-
bodies appeared as an exploratory analysis.
Results
Altogether, 2159 newborn infants (1021 female [47.3%]) with
an eligible HLA genotype (41.9% of the genotyped infants)
were randomized to the intervention study. Five hundred
sixteen infants (23.9%) carried the high-risk HLA genotype;
953 (44.1%), moderate-risk genotypes; 668 (31.0%), mild-
risk genotypes; and 22 (1.0%), the rare mild-risk genotype.
The first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes was the
mother in 1052 infants (48.8%), the father in 722 (33.4%),
and a sibling in 308 (14.3%), and 77 participants (3.5%) had
multiple affected relatives. The median follow-up time for
the diagnosis of diabetes was 11.5 years (Q1-Q3, 10.2-12.8
years; mean, 11.0 years). Randomization resulted in 1081
infants in the casein hydrolysate group and 1078 in the con-
trol group. There were no differences in the demographics
or the distribution of HLA genotypes between the 2 groups
(Table 1).
Study Intervention
Eighty percent of infants in the casein hydrolysate group
and 80.9% in the control group were exposed to the study
formula during the intervention period. The mean (SD) ages
of the infants at the time of study formula introduction
were 2.0 (2.3) months in the hydrolysate group and 1.8 (2.2)
months in the control group (difference, 0.2 months [95%
CI, 0-0.42]). The mean (SD) duration of study-formula feed-
ing was 10.2 (9.3) weeks in the casein hydrolysate group and
11.7 (9.7) weeks in the control group (difference, 1.5 weeks
[95% CI, 0.7-2.3]; P < .001). As previously reported, the
analysis of cow’
s milk antibodies confirmed that the fami-
lies adhered well to the dietary intervention, resulting in
conspicuous differences in the antibody levels between the
treatment groups.13
Progression to Diabetes
The median age at initial seroconversion was 1.6 years
(Q1-Q3, 1.0-3.0 years) in the casein hydrolysate group
among those who progressed to clinical diabetes, whereas it
was 1.5 years (Q1-Q3, 1.0-3.0 years; P = .38) among the pro-
gressors in the control group. The mean duration from sero-
conversion to clinical diabetes was 4.1 years (median, 3.5
years [Q1-Q3, 1.4-6.6]) in the casein hydrolysate group and
3.9 years (median, 3.1 years [Q1-Q3, 1.1-6.2]) in the control
group (difference, 0.2 years [95% CI, −0.8 to 1.1]; P = .76).
The number of participants who were positive for each spe-
cific autoantibody during the preclinical period is shown in
Table 1. Five children (5.5%) in the casein hydrolysate group
and 6 (7.3%) in the control group had no detectable autoan-
tibodies before the diagnosis of diabetes (P = .62). At diag-
nosis, the number of autoantibody-negative participants
had dropped to 4 (4.4%) and 5 (6.1%), respectively (differ-
ence, 1.7% [95% CI, −6.4% to 10.4%]).
Diabetes
During follow-up, diabetes developed in 91 children in the
casein hydrolysate group (8.4%) and in 82 in the control

 group (7.6%) (difference, 0.8% [95% CI, −1.6% to 3.2%];
P = .47; Figure 2). The hazard ratio for type 1 diabetes
adjusted for HLA risk group, duration of breastfeeding, dura-
tion of study formula consumption, sex, and region, while
treating study center as a random effect, was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-
1.5; P = .46). There was no significant difference in the
median age at diagnosis between the 2 groups (6.0 years [Q1-
Q3, 3.1-8.9] vs 5.8 years [Q1-Q3, 2.6-9.1]; P = .75; difference,
0.2 years [95% CI, −0.9 to 1.2]). About one-fourth of the cases
in each group were diagnosed without clinical symptoms
(Table 2). Five children (5.5%) in the casein hydrolysate
group and 3 (3.7%) in the control group presented with dia-
betic ketoacidosis (difference, 1.8% [95% CI, −6.3% to 9.8%];
P = .57). Comparisons between the treatment groups within
HLA risk groups, according to the relationship to the affected
family member (father, mother, or sibling with diabetes),
geographic region associated with the clinical site of enroll-
ment, or sex were not statistically significant (Table 3).
The prespecified per-protocol analysis was defined to
include those who were not exposed to any nonallowed
foods containing cow’
s milk and had exposure to study for-
mula for at least 60 days. The hazard ratio for type 1 diabetes

of the treatment groups was estimated after adjusting for the
age at which multiple autoantibodies appeared (median, 3.2
years [Q1-Q3, 1.6-6.3] in the casein hydrolysate group and 3.0
years [Q1-Q3, 1.5-6.1] in the control group; P = .42) with little
effect on the overall results (hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.70-
1.28]; P = .95).

 Adverse Events
The frequency of any infection was 0.90 events/year in the hy-
drolysate group and 0.93 events/year in the control group. The
correspondingfrequenciesofupperrespiratoryinfectionswere
0.48 and 0.50, respectively. The rate of other adverse events
was of the same magnitude in the 2 groups (eTable in
Supplement 2). Similar linear growth and weight gain were ob-
served in both groups.
Discussion
In this international randomized trial in children with an
HLA genotype conferring increased risk for type 1 diabetes
and an affected first-degree relative, weaning to a highly
hydrolyzed formula during infancy did not reduce the inci-
dence of type 1 diabetes compared with cow’
s milk–based
formula. This outcome is consistent with the report of this
trial that showed no difference between the study groups in
the appearance of islet autoantibodies,15 but is not consis-
tent with data from the pilot study,22 which reported that
weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula in infancy
was associated with a decrease in the frequency of disease-
associated autoantibodies by the age of 7.5 years. That study
was conducted in 230 Finnish children, while the current
trial included 2159 high-risk children from 15 different
countries, most participants being from Canada, Finland,
and the United States. The larger number of participants in
this study provides substantially greater statistical power
in a more heterogeneous study population compared with
the pilot study and, therefore, provides a more definitive
answer to whether weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed
formula is protective of diabetes.
Overall, 173 participants (8.0%) progressed to type 1 dia-
betes during the follow-up for 11.5 years. This is close to an
expected rate of 7.5% by the age of 10 years in the control
group, on which the sample size estimate was based. For
unknown reasons, the rate of diabetes was higher, although
not significantly so, among females compared with males in
the casein hydrolysate group. About 49% of the participants
had a mother affected by type 1 diabetes, while only around
35% of those who presented with clinical disease had an
affected mother. This reflects the well-known fact that off-
spring of mothers with type 1 diabetes have a reduced dis-
ease risk compared with offspring of affected fathers.23,24
Additional strengths of the current trial include a very
high retention rate of participants and dietary adherence.
The fact that the study was performed in 15 countries on 3
continents also supports the generalizability of the results.
This study was planned to have 2 end points, namely (1) posi-
tivity for 2 autoantibodies by the age of 6 years and (2) clini-
cal diabetes by the age of 10 years. While the previous report
of this study showed no benefit in terms of a reduction in
seroconversion to autoantibody positivity,15 the follow-up of
the trial participants to 10 to 14 years of age enabled the
study to evaluate the possible effect of the treatment on pro-
gression from autoimmunity to diabetes.
The study was not designed to test the effect of breast-
feeding because random assignment of infants to breastfeed-
ing or formula feeding was not considered ethical. However,

 no effect of exclusive breastfeeding was seen on progression
to seroconversion or diabetes. Some prospective studies
assessing the associations between infant feeding patterns
and the development of β-cell autoimmunity in children who
are at genetic risk for type 1 diabetes have not observed any
associations between the duration of either exclusive or total
breastfeeding and β-cell autoimmunity.11,12 However, a
recently published study involving children from the general
population showed that no breastfeeding was related to an
increased risk of diabetes compared with infants with history
of any breastfeeding.25
The casein-based formula used as the intervention
modality in this study was highly hydrolyzed and did not
contain intact proteins. Less than 0.3% of the peptides had a
molecular weight exceeding 2000 Da. Accordingly, the for-
mula should be free of intact bovine insulin, which is pres-
ent in cow’
s milk.26 Vaarala et al26 showed that infants fed a
conventional cow’
s milk–based formula before the age of 3
months developed a strong immune response to bovine
insulin, which differs from human insulin by 3 amino acids.
Infants developing early signs of β-cell autoimmunity
lacked the capacity to mount oral tolerance to bovine insu-
lin. It has been speculated that sustained bovine insulin
immunity might contribute to prediabetes progression, as
weaning to an insulin-free formula reduced the cumulative
incidence of autoantibodies by more than half in young chil-
dren at genetic risk for type 1 diabetes.27 The current data do
not, however, support the bovine insulin hypothesis.
To our knowledge, this is the first trial to test with
adequate power whether eliminating exposure to foreign
intact protein in the infant diet could prevent type 1 diabe-
tes in a genetically high-risk population. This trial suggests
that cow’
s milk does not play a critical role in the develop-
ment of type 1 diabetes.
Limitations
The results of this study are not directly generalizable to the
background population because participants were selected
based on a positive family history for type 1 diabetes and an
HLA genotype conferring risk for type 1 diabetes. In addi-
tion, the outcome is not necessarily applicable to children
with other HLA genotypes.
Conclusions
Among infants at risk for type 1 diabetes, weaning to a hydro-
lyzed formula compared with a conventional formula did not
reduce the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes after a me-
dian follow-up for 11.5 years. These findings do not support a
need to revise the current dietary recommendations for in-
fants at increased risk for type 1 diabetes.
