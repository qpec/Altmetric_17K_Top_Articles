Between September 2017 and February 2018, influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses (mainly 
B/Yamagata, not included in 2017/18 trivalent vac-
cines) co-circulated in Europe. Interim results from 
five European studies indicate that, in all age groups, 
2017/18 influenza vaccine effectiveness was 25 to 52% 
against any influenza, 55 to 68% against influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09, −42 to 7% against influenza A(H3N2) 
and 36 to 54% against influenza B. 2017/18 influenza 
vaccine should be promoted where influenza still 
circulates.
Most countries in the European Union (EU) recommend 
and fund seasonal influenza vaccine for elderly people 
and individuals at increased risk of severe influenza [1]. 
The United Kingdom (UK) commenced the incremental 
introduction of a universal childhood influenza vacci-
nation programme in 2013/14 using a quadrivalent live 
attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) for healthy chil-
dren and quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV) for at-
risk children for whom LAIV4 is contraindicated [2].
The trivalent influenza vaccines for the 2017/18 
northern hemisphere influenza season include an 
A/Michigan/45/2015 
(H1N1)pdm09-like 
virus, 
an 
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus and a 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like 
virus 
(B/Victoria 
line-
age). The quadrivalent vaccines also contain a B/
Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage) [3].
The early phase of the 2017/18 influenza season in 
Europe was characterised by the co-circulation of influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza 
B, with different patterns of dominant type or subtype 
observed between countries [4]. Up to February 2018, 
most influenza B viruses assigned to a lineage were B/
Yamagata viruses, not included in the 2017/18 trivalent 
vaccine [3,4].
Here we present the interim 2017/18 season influenza 
vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates from three single-
country studies (UK, Denmark (DK) and Spain (ES)) 
and two multi-country studies (primary care (EU-PC) 
and hospital (EU-H) European Influenza - Monitoring 
Vaccine 
Effectiveness 
(I-MOVE/I-MOVE+) networks) 
(Figure 1). 
Study design and estimation of vaccine 
effectiveness 
The methods of these five studies have been described 
in detail elsewhere [5-9]. Study sites included in 
EU-PC (Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) and EU-H 
(France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) 
followed generic protocols for primary care-based or 
hospital-based studies.
All five studies used a test-negative case control design 
(TND) [10]. In short, individuals presenting at partici-
pating healthcare settings with a pre-determined set 
of symptoms (including at least one systemic and one 
respiratory symptom) were swabbed. Samples were 
tested for influenza using RT-PCR. Individuals testing 
positive for influenza were classified as cases (by influ-
enza (sub)type), those testing negative as controls.

The ES, UK and EU-PC studies included patients at pri-
mary care level (henceforth referred to as medically 
attended), the EU-H study included patients at hospital 
level (henceforth referred to as hospitalised), and the 
DK study included results from primary care and hospi-
tal level pooled together. Patients’ inclusion was fore-
seen to be systematic (or exhaustive) in the ES, EU-PC 
and EU-H studies and ad hoc in the DK and UK studies. 
In Spain, 268 of the 833 physicians included in the ES 
study were also included in the EU-PC study.
The study population included all age groups in all 
studies except for EU-H, which was confined to indi-
viduals 65 years and older.
In all studies, we defined patients as vaccinated with 
the 2017/18 influenza vaccine if they had been vacci-
nated at least 14 days (UK) or 15 days (all other studies) 
before symptom onset. Patients were excluded if they 
were vaccinated less than 14 (UK) or 15 days (all other 
studies) before symptom onset or if the date of vacci-
nation was unknown.

In seven EU-PC countries (France, Germany, Ireland, 
the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden), the UK, 
ES and DK, all or a random sample of positive influenza 
specimens were selected for genetic sequencing.
VE was computed by comparing the odds of vaccina-
tion between cases and controls (VE = (1 − OR) × 100). 
All studies used logistic regression to adjust VE for 
measured confounding variables, excluding patients 
with missing data for covariates in the model (complete 
case analysis) (Table 1). We computed VE overall and, 
where possible, by age group and target population 
(as defined locally in the various studies and study 
sites) against any influenza, influenza A(H3N2), influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09, any influenza B and influenza B/
Yamagata.
If the number of events per parameter was lower than 
10, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using penalised 
logistic regression to assess small sample bias [11].
Results 
Between September 2017 and February 2018, the num-
ber of patients included in the VE analysis by study 
was 2,399 (1,452 cases) in the ES, 1,331 (421 cases) 
in the UK, 4,652 (2,103 cases) in the EU-PC, 11,907 
(3,011 cases) in the DK and 931 (385 cases) in the EU-H 
study. Overall, more than two thirds of cases were 
positive for influenza B viruses in all studies except 
UK, where influenza A and B viruses were detected in 
similar proportions (51% (214/423) and 49% (209/423), 
respectively) (Figure 2). Where subtyped, influenza A 
viruses were mainly A(H3N2) in ES (62% (233/375) of 
subtyped influenza A specimens), UK (90% (174/194)) 
and EU-H (74% (68/92)), and mainly A(H1N1)pdm09 in 
DK (56% (145/257)) and EU-PC (67% (469/698)). 
Any influenza
Among all ages, VE against any medically attended 
influenza ranged between 25% (95% confidence inter-
val (CI): −10 to 48) in the UK study and 52% (95% CI: 
29 to 67) in the ES study. In UK, VE of the LAIV4 was 
53% (95% CI: −56 to 86) in children and VE of the inac-
tivated vaccine was 18% (95% CI: −23 to 45) in adults 
(Table 2). Among the target groups for influenza vac-
cination, the VE was 36% (95% CI: 13 to 53) in EU-PC 
and 40% (95% CI: 1 to 63) in the ES study. In EU-H, VE 
against any hospitalised influenza in patients aged 65 
years and older was 35% (95% CI: 13 to 51).
Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
All 76 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses sequenced 
belonged to clade 6B.1 (A/Michigan/45/2015) (Table 2).
VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 68% (95% CI: 
42 to 83) and 55% (95% CI: 23 to 74) among all ages in 
the EU-PC and DK studies, respectively. Among 18–64 
year-olds, it was 63% (95% CI: 12 to 84) and 60% (95% 
CI: 13 to 82) in the EU-PC and DK studies, respectively. 
Among those aged 65 years and older, it was 37% (95% 
CI: −40 to 72) in the DK study (Table 2).
Influenza A(H3N2)
Of the 204 influenza A(H3N2) viruses sequenced, 63% 
(n = 129) belonged to genetic clade 3C.2a, 35% (n = 72) 
to 3C.2a1 and 1% (n = 3) to 3C.3a (Table 3).
Among all ages, VE against influenza A(H3N2) ranged 
from −42% (95% CI: −116 to 7) in the DK and 7% (95% 
CI: −74 to 51) in the ES study. VE against hospitalisation 
for influenza A(H3N2) in patients aged 65 years and 
older was −1% (95% CI: −93 to 47) in EU-H (Table 2).
Influenza B
Of the 596 influenza B viruses sequenced, 94% 
(n = 559) were B/Yamagata (all belonging to clade 3 
influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013) and 6% (n = 37) were 
influenza B/Victoria (25 belonging to clade 1A Δ(K162, 
N163) and 12 belonging to clade 1A) (Table 3).
Among all ages, VE against influenza B ranged between 
36% (95% CI: 27 to 44) in the DK and 54% (95% CI: 
24 to 72) in the UK study. Age group-specific VE was 
lowest at 15% (95% CI: −114 to 66) among those aged 
65 years and older and highest at 83% (95%CI: 54 to 
94) in the 0–14-year age group in the ES study. VE was 
34% (95% CI: 8 to 52) against hospitalised influenza 
B in EU-H and 28% (95% CI: 14 to 39) against medi-
cally attended and hospitalised influenza B in the DK 
study among those aged 65 years and older (Table 2). 
VE against influenza B/Yamagata was 77% (95% CI: 14 
to 94) in the ES study and 49% (95% CI: 19 to 67) in 
EU-PC (Table 2).

Sensitivity analyses
For all of the above analyses, sensitivity analyses for 
small sample size gave similar results (absolute differ-
ence ranging between 1% and 6%).
 
Discussion 
Interim results from five established influenza VE stud-
ies across Europe indicate that 2017/18 VE against 
all influenza ranged between 25 and 52% among all 
ages and between 36 and 40% in the targeted groups. 
VE was moderate to good against influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 among all ages (55 to 68%), poor against influ-
enza A(H3N2) with all point estimates below 8% for 
all ages, and moderate against influenza B, with point 
estimates between 39 and 52% for all ages.
The good VE against medically attended influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 is consistent with historical data [12]. 
However, during the last influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 sea-
son in Europe (2015/16), the EU-PC VE of 33% against 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in all age groups was lower 
than what we report here [13]. In the 2015/16 season, 
the influenza vaccine strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)
pdm09 differed from the circulating strains which 
mainly belonged to the genetic subgroup 6B.1 (rep-
resented by A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09). This 
6B.1 strain was included in the 2017/18 vaccine and was 
identified in all A(H1N1)pdm09 samples sequenced in 
the study sites. The change in vaccine strain may have 
led to a better VE against A(H1N1)pdm09. More precise 
end-of-season estimates and results at the hospital 
level will help investigate this hypothesis.
The influenza A(H3N2) component included in the 
2017/18 northern hemisphere vaccine was the same 
as in the 2016/17 northern hemisphere vaccine [14]. 
As anticipated based on EU-H 2016/17 results [15] and

2017 interim results from Australia [16], and as already 
reported in other published early estimates for the 
northern hemisphere [17], the VE against influenza 
A(H3N2) was low in participating study sites. In our 
studies, 63% of sequenced influenza A(H3N2) viruses 
belonged to the A/HongKong/4801/2014 vaccine strain 
genetic group (3C.2a) and 35% to the A/Singapore/
INFIMH-16–0019/2016 clade (3C.2a1), which is the 
selected strain in the 2018 southern hemisphere and 
2018/19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines [18]. 
Small sample size limited VE estimation by clade and 
subclade, which will be a priority for end-of-season 
analyses. Our results further support the need for 
more effective interventions in older people, in whom 
the burden of influenza A(H3N2) is most notable and 
the VE, including against severe outcome, is the lowest 
[19]. Based upon recent cost-effectiveness work under-
taken by Public Health England, the UK Joint Committee 
on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that 
use of adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV) 
in those aged 65 years and older would be both more 
effective and cost-effective than the non-adjuvanted 
trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines currently in use [20].
The interim VE against medically attended influenza B 
was moderate in the studies included here (36% to 54% 
among all ages), similar to recently published estimates 
from northern hemisphere countries [17,21,22]. It was 
moderate to good against medically attended influenza 
B in children (58% in EU PC and 83% in ES) and poorer 
at 34% against hospitalised outcome among adults 65 
years and older. The vast majority (94%) of sequenced 
influenza B samples were of the B/Yamagata lineage, 
which was not included in the 2017/18 northern hemi-
sphere TIV. VE was 77% and 49% against influenza B/
Yamagata in the ES and EU-PC studies, respectively, 
suggesting important cross-lineage protection.
The UK study was the only one to provide VE estimates 
for the quadrivalent vaccines. Vaccine effectiveness 
against any influenza among children was similar in the 
UK study (53%), where children receive LAIV4, and in 
the EU-PC study (59%), where most vaccinated children 
received TIV. However, it is difficult to compare these 
estimates against any influenza since the relative pro-
portion of circulating (sub)types was different in the 
UK, where there was a higher proportion of circulating 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses, compared with most coun-
tries participating in the EU-PC study. In past seasons 
where circulating and vaccine lineages were different, 
contradictory results were observed [13,23,24]. Partial, 
but not full cross-protection between mismatched influ-
enza B lineages has been suggested by two systematic 
reviews [25,26]. More precise end-of-season estimates 
by lineage, age group and vaccine type would be of 
added value to discuss cross-lineage protection and 
the added protection conferred by quadrivalent vac-
cines. Such information is relevant at a time when QIV 
is available in most European countries [27] and prefer-
entially recommended in some [28].
End-of-season analyses are needed to verify the con-
clusions from these interim season results. A larger 
sample size should allow more precise estimates,

especially in stratified analyses. Recent publica-
tions suggest a potentially strong (boosting or lower-
ing) effect of previous vaccination on VE estimates 
[29,30] and end-of-season analyses should take this 
into account. Although TND is a well-recognised study 
design to measure VE, we cannot rule out bias from 
unmeasured confounding.
These early VE results from five studies were included 
in the Global Influenza VE (GIVE) report to help inform 
the World Health Organization vaccine strain selec-
tion committee meeting on 22 February 2018. For the 
2018/19 northern hemisphere trivalent vaccine, this 
selection committee recommended to include the 
same influenza A(H1N1) component as in the 2017/18 
northern 
hemisphere 
vaccine, 
an 
A/Singapore/
INFIMH-16–0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus and a B/
Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage) 
[18].
In the context of an influenza season with co-circula-
tion of influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 
influenza B viruses mismatched with the trivalent vac-
cine, results from these five EU studies indicate a mod-
erate VE against all influenza. Vaccination continues 
to be the most effective preventive measure against 
influenza and uptake of the 2017/18 trivalent or quad-
rivalent influenza vaccines should still be promoted in 
countries with ongoing virus circulation. In particular in 
settings with evidence of influenza A(H3N2) virus circu-
lation, prophylactic use of antiviral drugs, administered 
according to country-specific guidelines, could help 
prevent severe outcomes [31]. Based on our results and 
in the absence of major antigenic drift, we may expect 
a good protection of the 2018/19 northern hemisphere 
seasonal influenza vaccine against influenza A(H1N1) 
and B viruses. Monitoring the effectiveness of the 2018 
southern influenza vaccine against influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses will be important to prepare for the next influ-
enza season in the northern hemisphere.
