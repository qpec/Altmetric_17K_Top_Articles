Large-scale microscopy approaches are transforming brain imaging, but currently lack effi-
cient multicolor contrast modalities. We introduce chromatic multiphoton serial (ChroMS)
microscopy, a method integrating one‐shot multicolor multiphoton excitation through
wavelength mixing and serial block-face image acquisition. This approach provides organ-
scale micrometric imaging of spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins and label-free nonlinear
signals with constant micrometer-scale resolution and sub-micron channel registration over
the entire imaged volume. We demonstrate tridimensional (3D) multicolor imaging over
several cubic millimeters as well as brain-wide serial 2D multichannel imaging. We illustrate
the strengths of this method through color-based 3D analysis of astrocyte morphology and
contacts in the mouse cerebral cortex, tracing of individual pyramidal neurons within densely
Brainbow-labeled tissue, and multiplexed whole-brain mapping of axonal projections labeled
with spectrally distinct tracers. ChroMS will be an asset for multiscale and system-level
studies in neuroscience and beyond.

ulticolor fluorescence microscopy has become a key
enabling technology in biology by providing the means
to spectrally resolve cells, organelles, or molecules
within tissues and to analyze their interactions. Strategies com-
bining multiple distinct fluorescent labels are increasingly used
to study spatial relationships among cells and molecules and to
encode parameters such as neuronal connectivity1–9, cell line-
age10–15, cycling state16,17, subtype identity18, genotype19,20, or
signaling pathway activation21. Scaling up such approaches at the
whole organ or tissue level would be a major step forward but is
hindered by the lack of suitable large-volume multicolor micro-
scopy methods. In recent years, serial block-face imaging, which
relies on the automated, iterative alternation of imaging and
microtome-based sectioning of a block of tissue, has been suc-
cessfully transposed from electron microscopy to light micro-
scopy22–25. This scheme has emerged as an effective means for
generating data encompassing mm3-to-cm3 volumes of tissue at
subcellular-resolution with either discrete or continuous sam-
pling. One particularly active field of application is neuroscience,
where block-face fluorescence imaging has opened the way to
brain-wide
mesoscale
connectomics23,26
and
single
neuron
reconstruction efforts26–29. However, microtome-assisted micro-
scopy methods developed so far are limited to single- or dual-
color imaging23,24,26,29. This limitation is due to the general
difficulty of exciting a manifold of fluorescent proteins. In addi-
tion, achieving tissue-scale multicolor microscopic imaging
requires addressing chromatic aberrations and channel registra-
tion over large volumes. These obstacles made it so far very
difficult to probe cell interactions or more generally to image
multiplexed
or
combinatorial
fluorescent
signals
with
micrometer-scale precision in samples exceeding a few hundreds
of microns in depth.
Here, we report on a method for volume multicolor and multi-
contrast microscopy with submicrometer registration of the
image channels. Our approach, termed chromatic multiphoton
serial (ChroMS) microscopy, relies on the integration of tri-
chromatic two-photon excitation by wavelength mixing (WM)30
with automated serial tissue sectioning. We show that ChroMS
microscopy delivers multicolor imaging over >mm3 volumes with
constant micron-scale resolution and submicron channel cor-
egistration, which sets new quality standards for large-scale
multicolor microscopy. We demonstrate its performance for tri-
dimensional imaging of mouse brains labeled by transgenic,
electroporation-based or viral multicolor approaches. In addition
to being perfectly suited for applications based on combinatorial
fluorescence labeling, ChroMS microscopy also enables organ-
wide imaging of label-free nonlinear signals such as third har-
monic generation (THG) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scat-
tering (CARS). We illustrate its potential for high information-
content three-dimensional (3D) imaging by demonstrating (i)
analysis of astroglial cell morphology and contacts over several
mm3 of cerebral cortex, (ii) color-assisted tracing of tens of
pyramidal neurons in a densely labeled, mm-thick cortical sam-
ple, and (iii) brain-wide color-based multiplexed mapping of
axonal projection trajectories and interdigitation.
Results
Multicontrast organ-scale imaging with ChroMS microscopy.
In ChroMS microscopy, the sample (whole organ or large piece
of tissue) is crosslinked with an embedding agarose block, and
large-scale imaging is achieved by automatically alternating
simultaneous multimodal acquisitions (four independent chan-
nels in the implementation used for this work), stage-based lateral
mosaicking, and tissue sectioning with a vibrating-blade micro-
tome. Simultaneous two-photon excitation in three distinct
spectral bands is provided by the spatio-temporal overlap of two
synchronized femtosecond infrared pulse trains at separate
wavelengths λ1 and λ2 (Fig. 1a). For example, one can choose λ1
= 850 and λ2 = 1100 nm for optimal two-photon excitation of
blue and red chromophores. Synchronization of the two pulses
then gives access to two-color multiphoton excitation processes
and in particular creates a ‘virtual’ two-photon excitation wave-
length at 2= λ�1
1
þ λ�1
2
�
�
� 950 nm, suitable for excitation of
green and/or yellow chromophores30. Tuning the power of the
two pulses and their time delay enables to control the three
excitation windows in a largely independent manner. This strat-
egy provides efficient simultaneous two-photon excitation of
several fluorescent proteins with emissions spanning the visible
spectrum, as well as access to coherent label-free nonlinear signals
such as third harmonic generation which reveals tissue structural
details31. One specific feature of the WM excitation scheme is that
it also enables CARS32 imaging of a chosen vibrational mode
along with detection of fluorescence and/or harmonic signals. A
typical ChroMS acquisition involves sequential sectioning of the
upper tissue block layer (typically 100 microns) and mosaic-based
imaging of the remaining intact block (Supplementary Movie 1).
The ChroMS setup can be programmed to acquire either 2D
mosaics at discrete axial positions (e.g. every 100 µm) (brain-wide
serial 2D or tomography mode, see Fig. 1a), continuous 3D
volumetric images through the recording of partially overlapping
image stacks (lossless continuous mode, see Fig. 1a), or combi-
nations of both.
Multicolor brain-wide anatomy with submicron resolution. To
establish the ability of ChroMS microscopy to deliver brain-wide
diffraction-limited multicolor images, we recorded serial mosaics
from brains of transgenic Brainbow mice (CAG-Cytbow; Nestin-
Cre). Dense yet mostly mutually exclusive neural expression of
Turquoise2/YFP/tdTomato is observed throughout the entire
brain of these animals. Figure 1b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Movies 2–5 present a multicolor 3D whole-brain
dataset consisting of 92 self-registered three-channel coronal
planes with a lateral sampling of 0.55 µm and a discrete axial
sampling of 100 µm. Each coronal plane, ranging from the
olfactory bulb to the brainstem, constitutes a comprehensive
submicron neuroanatomical map of labeled neurons and glial
cells in which color contrast facilitates individual cell distinction.
As shown in Fig. 1c, the resolution provided by ChroMS imaging
enables to visualize fine neural processes such as Purkinje cell
dendrites and mossy fiber axons in the cerebellum. ChroMS
microscopy thus presents the sensitivity, spatial resolution,
spectral discrimination and robustness necessary for micrometric
multicolor imaging of native transgenic fluorescent labels over
entire mouse brains. In the serial tomography mode illustrated
here, it constitutes an effective approach for comprehensive
anatomical mapping of different color labels with individual cell
resolution at the whole-organ scale.
Submicrometer color channel alignment over millimeter dis-
tances. A unique feature of the ChroMS approach for large-
volume multi-channel imaging is the intrinsic 3D submicron
channel co-registration resulting from the excitation process,
which makes it possible to assess and control chromatic aber-
rations over large volumes (Fig. 2). Indeed, green fluorescence
signals
obtained
through
wavelength
mixing
provide
an
intrinsic quality check: they are observed only if the λ1 and λ2
excitation point spread functions overlap in 3D with submicron
precision, in turn ensuring that all signals originate from the
same diffraction-limited volume. We mitigated chromatic
aberrations as follows. We used second harmonic generation

 (SHG) from nanocrystals to map chromatic shifts across the
field (Fig. 2a, b) and chose an excitation objective best suited for
wavelength mixing as explained in ref 33. We then optimized
our scanning system to correct for lateral chromatic aberrations
over a field of approximately 400 µm (see Methods). We
inserted a telescope in each beam path prior to recombination
in order to minimize their axial mismatch at focus. Overall, we
obtained a color mismatch of less than 0.6 µm in all three
dimensions over a field of view exceeding 350 µm (Fig. 2b).
As illustrated in Fig. 2c, ratiometric imaging of neural tissue

expression.
Moreover,
mosaicking and iterative sectioning preserved the nearly perfect
matching between channels over cubic millimeters of imaged
tissue (Fig. 2d). ChroMS microscopy therefore benefits from the
combination of tissue sectioning and point-scanning two-
photon imaging which ensures homogeneous volumetric reso-
lution and robustness to depth-induced image degradation.
These performances enabled us to visualize submicron struc-
tures such as neurites and astrocyte processes with multicolor
precision (i.e. not affected by chromatic aberrations) at arbi-
trary depths (see Fig. 2d) for the first time. Finally, we point out
that trichromatic single-shot excitation is advantageous in
terms of imaging speed compared to sequential acquisition of
color channels, which is particularly relevant in the context of
large volume acquisitions with point-scanning schemes23,24,26.
Multicolor 3D histology of uncleared neural tissue. We then
used ChroMS imaging to achieve continuous high-resolution 3D
multicolor combinatorial imaging of uncleared brain tissue with
constant resolution and contrast over the entire volume. Figure 3
and Supplementary Movies 6–8 show a 1.2 × 2 × 2 mm3 portion
of the cerebral cortex of an adult mouse brain continuously
sampled with 0.4 × 0.4 × 1.5 µm3 voxel size, labeled in a semi-
dense manner by the MAGIC markers strategy14. This approach
relying on electroporation of genome-integrative transgenes in
embryonic neural progenitors efficiently labels with combinations
of cyan, yellow, and red FPs the descent of these cells: glial cells,
in particular astrocytes, distributed throughout the cortical wall,
as well as pyramidal neurons, here restricted to layers 2–3. Post-
acquisition linear unmixing was used to correct for the limited
spectral bleed-through between channels due to the overlap of
fluorescence emission spectra (Supplementary Fig. 2). In turn,
this enabled colorimetric quantification of the trichromatic
combinatorial labels expressed by the cells (Fig. 2c and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). As discussed in ref. 14 and illustrated here, more
than 20 different color combinations are readily resolved from

 such multichannel data. We finally performed a 3D stitching of
the multi-channel blocks (see Methods) and obtained a con-
tinuous dataset giving access to high-resolution 3D morphology
of labeled cells over the whole imaged cortical volume (Fig. 3). In
particular, thousands of protoplasmic astrocytes were imaged in
the cortical wall with micrometer-scale resolution. The cell bodies
and main cytoplasmic processes of these cells as well as the tri-
dimensional domain of neural tissue occupied by their fine pro-
cesses34 were resolved throughout the entire volume (Fig. 3a, b).
This dataset also demonstrated multicolor imaging of the densely
labeled neurons located in upper cortical layers, enabling to
resolve their neurites (Fig. 3b).
Quantitative 3D cell morphometry of cortical astrocytes.
Astrocytes, the main glial cell type of the brain, form an unin-
terrupted cellular network throughout the neuropil34. Studying
the organization of this network faces two difficulties: singling-
out individual astrocytes from their neighbors and imaging these
cells in their entirety. The multicolor labeling of astrocytes in the
continuous tridimensional data presented above provided a
unique opportunity to study their layout and contacts without
biases introduced by tissue sectioning (Fig. 4).
We first derived a reconstruction of the astroglial network over
a depth of 1 mm from a volume containing 1055 labeled
astrocytes which we all positioned in 3D (Fig. 4a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 4). These astrocytes often formed clusters of
juxtaposed cells expressing an identical color (n = 261, Fig. 3a), as
expected from clonally related cells generated by local prolifera-
tion35. The finely resolved ChroMS images made it possible to
visualize the somata of the cells engulfed within the domain of the
labeled astrocytes (mostly neuronal, negatively contrasted in the
images): we pointed 12,265 such contacting cell bodies (Fig. 4a, b,
Supplementary Fig. 4). By computing the average soma-to-
astrocyte ratio in each cluster, we inferred that each mouse
cortical astrocyte was in contact with an average of 12.8 ± 4.6
(mean ± s.d, n = 248, median = 12.3) cells (Fig. 4c). Interestingly,
we observed that this parameter displayed significant variations
across cortical layers (Fig. 4c): layers 4 and 6 astrocytes contacted
more cells in average than the general distribution, 17.2 ± 3.6
(n = 18, median = 17.8) and 17.1 ± 4.9 (n = 35, median = 16),
respectively. Layer 5a and 5b astrocytes contacted significantly
less cells than the former categories with an average of 8.9 ± 2.7
(n = 20, median = 8.6) and 9.6 ± 2.6 (n = 17, median = 9.5)
contacted cells for layer 5a and 5b astrocytes, respectively.
We then performed 3D morphological analyses of individual
astrocytes, taking advantage of isolated or color-segregated cells
present in the dataset. We could in this manner analyze 130
astrocytes within a single brain. We segmented the domains (a.k.
a. territory) covered by the processes of these astrocytes within

derived from the 3D segmentation an average cortical astrocyte
domain volume of 7.3 × 104 μm3 ± 2.2 × 104 (mean ± s.d, n = 130)
with a median value at 6.8 × 104 μm3, close to that measured
in other studies in vivo (6.4 × 104 μm3 ± 4314 in ref. 36), but
divergent from previous reports based on sucrose37 or CUBIC-
based38 clearing media, known to modify tissue volume. Using
our data, we also investigated the variation of astrocyte territorial
volumes across cortical layers (Fig. 4d). We focused our analysis
on singled-out astrocytes in deep cortical layers (layers 4–6). This
analysis revealed a significant volume difference (adjusted p-value
<0.0001) between layer 4 astrocytes (5.5 × 104 μm3 ± 1.2 × 104,
n = 29,
median = 5.5 ± 104 μm3)
and

layer 4 astrocytes and deep layer 6 astrocytes (8 × 104 μm3 ± 2.2 ×
104, n = 43, median = 7.4 × 104 μm3). We next evaluated at the
single cell level whether this layer-dependent volume variation
was correlated with the soma-to-astrocyte ratio (Fig. 4e), and
found no significant correlation (correlation coefficient r = 0.265,
n = 67). However, the analysis revealed different distribution
patterns according to cortical layers: layer 5a astrocytes occupied

 larger volumes while contacting fewer cells; layer 4 astrocytes
occupied small volumes and contact more cells; layer 6 astrocyte
volume increased with the number of contacted cells (correlation
coefficient r = 0.705, n = 25).
Additionally, color contrasts among labeled astrocytes pro-
vided a unique opportunity to study how their domains partition
the
neuropil.
We
implemented
a
workflow
to
analyze
astrocyte–astrocyte interfaces in 3D on the same dataset, taking
advantage of the color contrast to extract the domain frontiers
between pairs of neighboring astrocytes labeled with distinct FP
combinations (Fig. 4f–h, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). For each
dual-color astrocyte pair (n = 9), we reconstructed in 3D the
surface of contact and analyzed its position and orientation
relative to the cell–cell median plane given by a Voronoi
tessellation based on nuclei positions. This analysis revealed
frequent imbalance in the positioning of the limits of astrocyte
cytoplasmic domains with respect to the median plane (mean bias
parameter 75.2% ± 15.2 [s.d.]), indicating that the tiling of the
cerebral cortex by astroglial cells deviates from an equiparted
Voronoi geometry.
Together, these results show that astrocytes present significant
heterogeneity in the volume of their domains and in their local
partitioning of the neural tissue, suggesting that they develop in a
plastic rather than fixed manner and may adapt to both their local
environment and neighbors during cortical development and
maturation. Our findings illustrate the unique strengths of
continuous multicolor 3D imaging with ChroMS microscopy
for unbiased quantitative 3D analysis of cell morphology and
contacts within large tissue volumes. Specific methodological
advantages of ChroMS for that purpose include the following:
(i) the color contrast increases the throughput of individual cell
analysis for a given sample by alleviating the need to use very
sparse labeling; (ii) it enables one to analyze contacts between
cells labeled with different colors; (iii) the serial multiphoton
approach suppresses the orientation and size artefacts due to
section registration or tissue shrinking/swelling encountered
respectively in histology and clearing techniques.
Color-based neuron tracing over extended volumes. We then
explored the possibilities provided by ChroMS imaging for
multiplex tracing of neuronal processes within a crowded envir-
onment (Fig. 5). While state-of-the-art high-speed serial tomo-
graphy platforms make it possible to trace entire neuronal
morphologies across the brain26,29, the throughput of such
approaches remains limited to a few neurons per brain, labeled in
a highly sparse manner. Brainbow color labels offer a way to
alleviate this limitation, but their use for multiplexed neuron
tracing has so far been limited, essentially because of the difficulty
to generate large-scale chromatically corrected multicolor data-
sets. We here show that ChroMS imaging enables color-based
multiplex neuron tracing within large tissue volumes (Fig. 5a–f,
Supplementary Movies 9 and 10). We imaged a portion of P21
mouse cortex electroporated with a CAG-Cytbow transgene14
at E15, a condition resulting in relatively dense labeling of layer
2/3 pyramidal excitatory neurons (Fig. 5a, c, Supplementary
Movie 9). A 2.6 × 2 × 1.1 mm3 multicolor volume was acquired
using the continuous ChroMS imaging mode with a 0.54 × 0.54 ×
1.5 µm3 voxel size over a depth of 1.1 mm, corresponding to the
assembly of ten acquired 3D blocks. Within this volume, we
traced 50 individual pyramidal neurons (Fig. 5b–d, Supplemen-
tary Movie 10), including crowded ensembles with neighboring

 somas and intermingled dendrites (Fig. 5e). Compact groups of
cells could be unambiguously traced thanks to the high color
contrast provided by the acquisition scheme, enabling to disen-
tangle their dendrites. This confirmed the scalability of ChroMS
imaging for tracing multiple long neurites extending across sli-
cing blocks (Fig. 5f).
Multiplexed brain-wide mapping of neuronal projections.
Interrogating the anatomical convergence and segregation of
axonal projections from different sets of neurons across large
distances is fundamental for gaining insight into the functional
organization of the nervous system. Until now, structural and
functional studies of interacting projections have mostly relied on
registration
of
different
projection
traces
to
a
common
framework24,39. Using distinct color labels can more precisely
inform on the anatomical relationships between different tracts in
the same brain volume5–7,29, but a convenient approach to map
these labels in 3 dimensions has been lacking. Here using
ChroMS microscopy, we achieved one-shot whole-brain tricolor
projection tract imaging on mouse brains injected with three
distinct anterograde AAV tracers (AAV-tdTomato, AAV-EYFP
and AAV-mTurquoise2) in three discrete locations of the sen-
sorimotor cortex (Fig. 6, Supplementary Figs. 7–10, Supplemen-
tary Movies 11–14). We used the whole-brain serial 2D mode of
ChroMS microscopy (Fig. 6a, b), combined with high-resolution
(0.4 µm × 0.4 µm × 1.5 µm) continuous-mode imaging of a 910 ×
1190 × 300 µm3 sub-volume within the striatum (Fig. 6c). This
hybrid acquisition scheme enabled us to obtain both a global map
of the labeled projections and a detailed view of their axonal
components in a given target region. Multicolor imaging of the
three distinctly labeled neuronal populations within the same
brain provided immediate access to the relative arrangement of
their projections, enabling to directly assess their topographic
arrangement and spatial overlap. The dataset presented here
reveals large-scale topography patterns, such as conserved topo-
graphic order within the callosal tract and striatum and a core-
shell topography in the thalamus, which corroborate previous
studies6,7 (Fig. 6a–d). In addition, a unique feature of simulta-
neous multicolor projection mapping is that it enables direct
analysis of the local fine scale interdigitation of axonal projections
from remote sites. For instance, while axons originating from the
three labeled cortical areas followed globally distinct trajectories
in the striatum (Fig. 6b–d), the high resolution multicolor images

 revealed local intermingling at the tens of microns scale (Fig. 6c).
To quantify these observations over the entire dataset, we
developed an image analysis workflow for high-resolution seg-
mentation (derived from ref. 24) and multiplexed analysis of
color-labeled
projections
from
initially
segregated
regions
(Fig. 6e–j, Supplementary Figs. 7–12). This enabled us to generate
quantitative maps of projection strength (Fig. 6h, Supplementary
Fig. 8) which provided an estimate of the number of labeled
axonal branches within a given surface (or super-pixel, set here to
24 µm × 24 µm). By overlapping projection strength maps, we
created interdigitation maps that revealed the respective con-
tribution of the labeled projections in each super-pixel, and in
which strong vs. weak projections could be differentially high-
lighted (Supplementary Fig. 9). Applying this workflow in the
striatum enabled to visualize the relative contribution of the
cortico-striatal projections defined by the three AAV labels and
to quantitatively probe their interdigitation in this target region
(Fig. 6i, j, Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12, Supplementary
Movies 11–14). This analysis confirmed that each of the three
projection components occupied a subdomain of the Caudo-
Putamen (CP) according to the known topography of this
structure, but also indicated that the proportion of the CP
occupied by one, two, or three of the projections remained within
similar values at each rostro-caudal level (Fig. 6i, Supplementary
Fig. 11). We also used the same workflow to quantitatively
characterize the topography of cortical fibers passing throughout
the striatum. While fibers labeled in blue and green, corre-
sponding to the intermediate and most caudal injections, traveled
throughout the striatum in a strictly segregated manner, they
started to interdigitate upon joining the internal capsule (Fig. 6j,
Supplementary Fig. 12). Thus, initially segregated projections
progressively intermix at the fine scale level as they course
through the striatum, implying an alteration of their topographic
arrangement. This analysis illustrates how our method enables
precise interrogation of both anatomical segregation and con-
vergence of color-labeled axon tracts within a brain area. ChroMS
imaging of multiple distinctly labeled neuronal projections
therefore provides an effective means to assess their relative
anatomical relationships at multiple scales within a single brain.
Label-free brain-wide micrometric morphological imaging.
Finally, the ChroMS system can be used to generate label-free
images based on endogenous nonlinear optical signals (Fig. 7).
Coherent contrast modalities such as THG and CARS tuned to
CH2 stretching mode have been shown to reveal morphology
and myelinated fibers in brain tissue40–42 but cannot be used for
organ-scale imaging with standard microscope configurations.
Although both modalities highlight lipidic structures in brain
tissue, they rely on different contrast mechanisms and therefore
can provide complementary information on sample micro-
structure43. Figure 7a, b presents label-free THG-CARS imaging
obtained using mixed 832/1090 nm excitation, recorded here on a
brain-wide scale. Figure 7c, d also illustrates trichromatic fluor-
escence imaging of viral-labeled axonal projections recorded
simultaneously with label-free THG signals channel using 850/
1100 nm excitation. This configuration is particularly informative,
as the THG image complements the color-based projections with
a rich morphological background, highlighting myelinated axons,
fiber tracts, and negatively contrasting cell bodies.
Discussion
We present here a multicolor/multi-contrast tissue-scale micro-
scopy method which bypasses the spectral limitation common to
current large volume imaging techniques, and in particular
expands
the
field
of
applications
of
serial
two-photon
microscopy23,44.
ChroMS microscopy achieves efficient one-shot excitation in
three distinct spectral bands, enabling multicolor imaging of
minimally processed tissue with sub-micron channel alignment
and resolution preserved over cubic millimeter volumes. The
integration of WM-excitation and serial block-face imaging solves
two general problems encountered in tissue imaging: chromatic
aberrations (inherent to all multicolor microscopy approaches)
and inhomogeneous image quality across volumes. ChroMS
microscopy can generate brain-wide atlas-like color datasets
with subcellular resolution as well as continuous 3D datasets of
supra-millimetric size with submicron multicolor precision and
diffraction-limited axial resolution.
Although clearing techniques (e.g. CLARITY45, CUBIC46, or
iDISCO47) combined with light-sheet microscopy have con-
stituted major breakthroughs in large-volume and organ-scale
tissue imaging with single-cell resolution, none of the plane
illumination techniques available thus far have been able to
deliver multicolor images with high contrast in all channels,
together with consistent and homogeneous submicron resolu-
tion across large volumes. Multicolor high-resolution imaging
of genetically labeled samples – especially red/green/blue
combinations – using serial blockface imaging methods also
represented a technical challenge so far. Indeed, previously
reported blockface methods either relied on a single two-
photon excitation wavelength which restricted contrast to dual-
color red/green imaging7,26, or involved tissue processing steps
causing fluorescence quenching/recovery29 which were not
compatible with a large palette of fluorescent proteins. This
bottleneck made it especially difficult to image combinatorically
labeled tissues over depths exceeding a few hundreds of
microns. In particular, the growing toolbox of multicolor
labeling approaches such as Brainbow1, Confetti48, MADM10,
MAGIC markers14, Startrack15, IfgMosaics19, etc., has not yet
fully benefited from large volume microscopy methods actively
developed in recent years. As we have shown, the ChroMS
approach overcomes these limitations. Another advantage of
the minimal tissue processing associated with ChroMS imaging
relative to the above approaches is that it limits the possibility
of introducing tissue distortions. In fact, our astrocyte territory
measurements were close to those formerly obtained in vivo
(6.4 × 104 μm3 ± 4314 in36), but less consistent with two studies
performed on clarified tissue slices (2.4 ± 104 μm3 in ref. 37, >9
± 104 μm3 in ref.
38). Indeed it has been reported that
dehydration-based methods37 induce tissue shrinkage and that
hyperhydration-based
methods38
generally
induce
tissue
expansion. Thus ChroMS imaging appears as a method of
choice for performing morphometric studies with reduced
biases.
We note that one limitation of the ChroMS system described
here is the image acquisition time, as imaging an entire mouse
brain with discrete axial sampling currently takes 2–3 days. This
caveat, however, is neither unbreakable nor truly limiting: ima-
ging speed in a point-scanning approach is essentially limited by
the fluorescence flux, which sets the minimal pixel dwell time. As
shown in the context of monochrome serial two-photon imaging,
acquisition can be significantly accelerated by using a fast scan-
ning scheme in combination with strongly labeled samples such
as AAV-labeled tissues, and automated contour detection26. With
such optimizations, Economo et al reported 7–10 acquisition days
for imaging a mouse brain with continuous micrometer-scale
sampling[26]. Furthermore, there is a most pressing need, com-
mon to all large volume microscopic techniques, to establish
efficient workflows to handle and analyze large datasets, as image
analysis time usually exceeds by far the acquisition time. Despites

 its speed limitation, the current implementation of ChroMS
delivers previously unachievable performance for multicolor
imaging.
Importantly, all applications illustrated here in the brain can
also be envisioned for organ-scale studies in other tissues. The
continuous imaging modality enables high-resolution anatomical
reconstruction and analyses of color labeling patterns over
extended volumes (in essence, 3D histology). Combined with

In the brain-wide tomography mode, ChroMS imaging will
facilitate mesoscale connectomics efforts, using color labels to
resolve subgroups of neurons within neural projections or map
putative convergence from distant brain regions5,7,51,52. Strategies
targeting specific cell-type or projections based on combined
genetic drivers, reporters and viral vectors53,54 further expand the
spectrum of our method’s foreseen applications. In addition,
ChroMS microscopy provides label-free nonlinear contrasts i.e.
microstructural and chemical information40,41 so-far inaccessible
at the organ scale. Multimodal imaging relying on multicolor
fluorescence and harmonics or vibrational signals may be used to
develop novel pathophysiological screening modalities. ChroMS
will therefore be an asset for multiscale and system-level studies
in neuroscience and beyond.
Methods
Multicolor transgenic mice. Mice were housed in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with
free access to food, and animal procedures were carried out in accordance with
institutional guidelines. Animal protocols were approved by the Charles Darwin
animal experimentation ethical board (CEEACD/No 5). We used transgenic mice
broadly expressing a CAG-Cytbow transgene14, modified to achieve random
expression of mTurquoise255, mEYFP56 or tdTomato57 from the broadly active
CAG promoter following Cre recombination. These mice were crossed with Nestin-
Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln) animals58 and their offspring analyzed at P29. This
strategy triggers multicolor labels in Nestin+progenitors and their descendants,
including both neuronal and glial cells.
Labeling of cortical astrocytes and upper layer pyramidal neurons. Cortical
astroglial cells were labeled by targeting their progenitors in the dorsal tele-
ncephalon with the MAGIC markers strategy14. Briefly, a glass micropipette was
used to inject into the lateral ventricle of E15 Swiss embryos 1 µl of DNA mix
containing the three following plasmids: PBCAG-Cytbow (2 µg µl−1), in which
PiggyBac transposition endfeet flanking a CAG-Cytbow cassette enable genomic
integration, CAG-hyPBase (1 µg µl−1), expressing the corresponding transposase59,
and CAG-seCre (0.2 µg µl−1) which expresses a self-excisable Cre recombinase.
Four 35 V pulses of 50 ms were applied with a CUY21EDIT electroporator
(NepaGene) and 3 mm diameter Tweezertrodes (Sonidel Limited) positioned to
target the dorsal wall of the lateral ventricle. Electroporated animals were allowed
to develop until analysis at P65. This procedure efficiently labels with FP combi-
nations the cells originating from the electroporated cortical progenitors, i.e. upper
layer pyramidal neurons and later-born glial cells, mostly astrocytes. Pyramidal
neurons traced in Fig. 5 were labeled by electroporating PBCAG-Cytbow (1 µg µl−1)
and CAG-seCre (0.1 µg µl−1) without transposase in E15 Swiss embryos and brains
were imaged at P21.
Multiplex tract tracing with AAVs. Three topographically distinct areas within
the antero-lateral sensorimotor cortex were injected with AAV2/9 encoding FPs
respectively emitting in the cyan (mTurquoise255 or mCerulean60, yellow
(mEYFP56) or red (tdTomato57 or DsRed-express61 spectral range. Recombinant
AAVs were based on a single-stranded (ss) AAV plasmid backbone with a CMV
early enhancer/chicken β actin (CBA) promoter driving FP expression, except for
DsRed-Express, driven by a CMV promoter. Detailed maps and sequences of the
vectors are available upon request. Apart from the mCerulean vector, obtained
from the Penn Vector Core (AV-9-PV1970), and the DsRed-Express vector gen-
erated as described in Kuhlman et al.62, all recombinant AAVs were produced by
co-transfecting the corresponding vector plasmids along with packaging and helper
plasmids in HEK293T cells. The AAV particles were harvested by centrifugation
and dialyzed. AAV vector titers were then determined using real-time qPCR and
adjusted to 0.5–5×1013 vg ml−1 by dilution in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) prior
to injection. C57Bl6 female mice aged 11 weeks were anesthetized by inhalation of
2% isoflurane delivered with a constant oxygen flow (0.4 l min−1). Dexamethasone
(0.5 mg kg−1) and ketoprofen (5 mg kg−1) were administered subcutaneously for
pre-emptive analgesia prior to the surgery and lidocaine (2-4 mg kg−1) was applied
preemptively intra-incisionally. Mice were mounted in a stereotaxic headframe
(Kopf Instruments, 940 series). Stereotactic coordinates were identified for three
topographically distinct brain areas within the antero-lateral sensorimotor cortex
that were respectively injected with the three AAVs. An incision was made over the
scalp, three small burr holes drilled in the skull and brain surface exposed at each
site. Injections were performed using the following AAVs and coordinates along
the medio-lateral (ML), antero-posterior (AP), and dorso-ventral (DV) axis
(defined relative to Bregma for ML and AP coordinates, and with reference to the
surface of the brain for DV): in the whole brain projection mapping experiment
(Fig. 6), we injected AAV2/9-CBA-tdTomato-WPRE (ML 2.4 mm, right; AP +
2.7 mm; DV 1 mm, α = −30 °), AAV2/9-CBA-mTurq2-WPRE (ML 2.4 mm, right;
AP + 2.2 mm; DV 1 mm, α = 0°) and AAV2/9-CBA-EYFP-WPRE (ML 2.4 mm,
right; AP + 1.9 mm; DV 1 mm, α = −30 °). For the WM and THG imaging
experiment (Fig. 7), we used AAV2/9-CMV-BI-DsRed-Express-WPRE (ML
2.4 mm, right; AP + 2.7 mm; DV 1 mm, α = −30°); AAV2/9-CAG(CB7)-CI-
mCerulean-WPRE-rBG (ML 2.5 mm, right; AP + 2.3 mm; DV 0.7 mm, α = 0°)
and AAV2/9-CBA-EYFP-WPRE (ML 2.7 mm, right; AP + 2.0 mm; DV 1 mm,
α = −30°). A pulled glass pipette tip of 20–30 μm containing the AAV suspension
was lowered into the brain and 300 nl was delivered at a rate of 30 nl min−1 using a
Picospritzer (General Valve Corp) at each of the three sites; following each virus
injection, the pipette was left in its location for 10 min to prevent backflow. After
the injection, the incision was closed with 5/0 nylon suture thread (Ethilon Nylon
Suture, Ethicon Inc. Germany), and animals were kept warm on a heating pad until
complete recovery.
ChroMS setup and image acquisition. Imaging was performed on a lab-built laser
scanning microscope. The excitation source used was a Ti:Sapphire+OPO chain
(Chameleon Ultra2 and MPX, Coherent, CA, USA). The two synchronous output
beams were combined using a dichroic filter (DMSP-1000, Thorlabs) and tempo-
rally synchronized using a long-range motorized delay line (Thorlabs) placed on the
OPO beam path, as described in ref. 30. The power of the TiS and OPO beams were
controlled using motorized waveplates and polarizers. In multicolor experiments,
efficiency of the 2c2P virtual green excitation was independently controlled by
adjusting the motorized delay line30. Scanning was performed with galvanometric
scanners (series 6215, Cambridge Technology, MA, USA). Excitation beams were
focused into the sample using a water immersion objective (25×, 1.05NA,
XLPLN25XWMP2, Olympus, Japan). Beam size at the rear pupil of the excitation
objective and beam divergence were adjusted using two-lens telescopes, one on each
beam path. To prevent photobleaching, an electronically controlled beam shutter
was installed after beam recombination together with an electro-optical modulator
blocking TiS excitation during laser fly-back in unidirectional scan mode.
A vibrating blade microtome (Tissue Vision, USA) was integrated into the
upright microscope setup, together with long-range high-precision XYZ translation
stage (Physik Instrumente, Germany/ Tissue Vision, USA) for mosaic imaging and
serial z-sectioning. Scanning and acquisition were synchronized using lab-written
LabVIEW software and a multichannel I/O board (PCI-6115, National
Instruments, USA). Mosaic acquisition and tissue slicing were controlled by a
custom version of the Orchestrator software (Tissue Vision, USA) synchronized
with the acquisition software through a lab-written LabVIEW module. Signals were
detected in the backward (epi) direction by photomultiplier tubes (SensTech, UK)
and/or GaAsP detectors (H7422P-40, Hamamatsu, Japan) using lab-designed
electronics enabling either counting or analog detection. Fluorescence and coherent
signals were collected using a dichroic mirror (Semrock 751 nm, USA) and directed
towards four independent detectors using dichroic mirrors (Chroma 405 nm,
Semrock 521 and 561 nm). Bandpass filters were used in front of the detectors to
collect blue (Semrock 475/25), green (Semrock 547/22), and red (Semrock 607/70)
light. The latter red bandpass filter was removed for CARS imaging. Third
harmonic generation was collected with a dichroic mirror (Chroma, 405 nm).
Sample mount consisted of a rotating slide holder fixed into an ~2 l plastic tank
installed on the translating stage. The objective and microtome arm were immersed
in the PBS-filled tank during the entire duration of acquisitions (see Supplementary
Fig. 13).
For vibrational imaging, excitation wavelengths were set to 832/1090 nm.
Otherwise, excitation wavelengths were set to 850/1100 nm. To minimize lateral
chromatic aberration and field curvature, the scan system was designed using a
Plössl-lens configuration63, and optics coating were also chosen to minimize
aberrations (see Supplementary Fig. 14). Individual tile size was 300–360 µm ×
300-360 µm in multicolor experiments (Supplementary Fig. 14) and 200 µm × 200
µm in THG-CARS experiments. A 10% lateral overlap was used for mosaic
reconstruction. In the tomography acquisition mode, imaging was typically
performed 40 µm below the surface. In the continuous acquisition mode, 80–130-
µm-thick stacks were acquired after each 60–110-µm-thick tissue section to allow
3D stitching. For robust tissue slicing, the frequency of the microtome vibrating
blade was set to 60 Hz and slicing speed to 0.3-0.5 mm s−1. Axial sampling were set
to 1.8 µm (TiS) and 2.6 µm (OPO) with <0.5 µm of axial mismatch. Metrology and
spatial beam coalignment were done using KTP nanoparticles33. Lateral sampling
in continuous mode acquisitions was set to 0.4 µm pixel−1 and 0.54 µm pixel−1 for

 the ChroMS/astrocytes (Figs. 3 and 4) and ChroMS/neuron tracing (Fig. 5)
experiments, respectively. In tomography mode acquisitions, it was set to 0.55 µm
pixel−1, 0.8 µm pixel−1, and 1.6 µm pixel−1 for the ChroMS/Brainbow (Fig. 1),
ChroMS/Triple AAV (Fig. 6), and ChroMS/Endogenous signals (Fig. 7)
experiments, respectively. Multicolor pixel dwell time was typically 5 µs.
Images pre-processing and stitching. Image processing was done using Fiji64
(NIH,USA) and Matlab (Mathworks, USA), and 3D renderings were generated
using IMARIS (Bitplane, Switzerland). Individual tiles were first batch cropped to
remove scanning edge artifacts. Flat-field correction was then applied to individual
tiles prior to stitching to correct for illumination inhomogeneity in the field of view.
Illumination profiles were computed for each channel by averaging all the tiles
of the channel and applying a large kernel Gaussian blurring. The tiles were then
divided by the normalized (maximum intensity) illumination profiles and merged
into RGB composites. Mosaic stitching was done using the Grid/Collection
Stitching Fiji plugin65. Tile positions were computed using cross-correlation
between tiles. For ChroMS continuous reconstructions, we used a custom version
of the same plugin allowing 3D cross-correlation calculations between blocks.
Of note, the high image quality provided over the entire acquisition depth by two-
photon imaging permitted efficient 3D stitching without the need of a supple-
mentary registration channel.
Linear unmixing. In order to remove spectral bleedthrough, a linear unmixing
procedure was applied as follows (see Supplementary Fig. 2). The colorimetry of
each dataset was first characterized with a pool of representative > 500 regions of
interest (ROIs) selected in color-labeled zones. The representative pool was plotted
in a ternary color diagram and a linear transform was applied to stretch RGB values
over the entire color diagram. Channel intensities were modeled as follow:
Rraw ¼ Rcorr þ aGR:Gcorr þ aBR:Bcorr
Graw ¼ aRG:Rcorr þ Gcorr þ aBG:Gcorr
Braw ¼ aRB:Rcorr þ aGB:Gcorr þ Bcorr

In images of Brainbow mice (Fig. 1) or MAGIC markers (Figs. 2, 3, and 5), the aXX
coefficients were determined using maximum red, green and blue intensity ROIs
Rmax(rr,gr,br), Gmax(rg,gg,bg), Bmax(rb,gb,bb) and by projecting the maximum blue
intensity ROI to the ‘pure blue’ point in the ternary diagram. The stretching
coefficients were then obtained by inverting the system associated matrix. The
same procedure was used for unmixing the AAV-labeled datasets (Fig. 6), using
barycentres of the ROI distributions obtained for each AAV (red, green, and blue)
instead of maxima.
Astroglial network reconstruction and segmentation. Analyses of cortical
protoplasmic astroglial cell distribution and contacts (Fig. 4) were done using Fiji64
and Matlab (Mathworks, USA). A partial rendering of the astroglial network was
obtained by reconstructing 3D color-clusters of astrocytes labeled with MAGIC
markers. A 3D color-cluster was defined as an ensemble of astrocytes expressing a
same color combination and continuously in contact with each other (see Fig. 4a).
Individual astrocytes were considered as color-clusters of size 1. Within each
cluster, the positions of astrocyte somata were pointed, together with the positions
of negatively contrasted contacting cell bodies of 4–6 µm diameter size. Cell bodies
were discriminated from transverse blood vessel sections using adjacent upper and
lower slices within the z-stack. Both cell bodies engulfed within protoplasmic
astrocytic domains and those located at the astrocytes’ periphery were included in
this analysis. The ratio of contacted cells over labeled astrocytes was computed for
all clusters, except pial. For the analysis of astrocyte contacted cell number in
different cortical layers (Fig. 4c), only clusters of size ≤3 which were entirely
comprised within an identified cortical layer were considered. Cortical layers were
identified based on morphological landmarks (see Supplementary Fig. 4b): layer 2/
3 was identified by the neuronal labeling resulting from E15 electroporation66; layer
5a was discriminated using visible projections from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons66;
and layers 5b and 6 were discriminated based on cell density, size and distance to
the corpus callosum. The pial surface was automatically segmented using intensity
thresholding and morphometric boundaries detection. The segmented surface
was then downscaled and fitted with linear interpolation for 3D visualization.
3D segmentation of individual astrocyte domains was done on isolated or color-
segregated cells using IMARIS 8.4v (Bitplane, Switzerland). For each astrocyte,
semi-automatic iso-intensity contours were drawn in all slices of the corresponding
z-stack (see Supplementary Fig. 4a). When the iso-intensity contour tool did not
provide accurate segmentation (low color SNR), manually defined contours were
drawn. Only astrocytes that could be unambiguously attributed to a specific cortical
layer (as defined above) were considered for layer analyses. To analyze the relation
between contacted cells number and astrocyte domain volume (Fig. 4e), only
individual astrocytes and pairs comprised within an identified cortical layer of
which contacting cells had been pointed were considered (the domain volume of
astrocyte belonging to a pair being approximated as half of the total volume
of the pair).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of astrocyte volume distributions in
different cortical layers was performed using GraphPad Prism software.
Sample size being unequal across all the categories and without any assumption
on the distributions, a non-parametric one-way anova test was first
performed (Kruskal-Wallis), followed by a post hoc multiple comparisons test
(Dunn).
Astrocytes tridimensional interface analysis. For each astrocyte pair analyzed,
the interface between the two-color segregated astrocytes (A1, A2) was seg-
mented using Fiji64 resulting in a discrete set of 3D coordinates {xI,yI,zI} in the
XYZ acquisition frame. The 3D positions {xA1,yA1,zA1} and {xA2,yA2,zA2} of A1
and A2 somatas defined the Voronoi axis, A1A2
��
�! being set as axis orientation
vector. The Voronoi plane was defined as the plane perpendicular to the Voronoi
axis and passing through the astrocyte pair midpoint M defined as the center
of the [A1A2] segment. Interface 3D coordinates were then expressed in the
Voronoi frame and fitted with a 2D polynomial function (see Supplementary
Fig. S5). The resulting fitting plane was defined as the interface plane. The angle
between the Voronoi plane and the interface plane was computed (orientation
parameter) together with the ratio of interface points above the Voronoi plane
(bias parameter). The interface plane and a corresponding normal vector were
used to define the interface frame. 3D interface coordinates were in turn
expressed in the interface frame and fitted with a biharmonic surface model.
Interfaces were then semi-automatically detoured and amplitude and gradient
maps were generated. All interface computations were done using Matlab
(Mathworks, USA).
Neuron tracing. Neurite tracing in Fig. 5 was done using the Imaris Filament
Tracer tool, IMARIS v9.2 (Bitplane, Switzerland).
Quantitative topography with triple-AAV projection labeling. A pipeline for
quantifying neuronal projection color maps was adapted from previously
described methods designed for serial two-photon microscopy-based mono-
chrome image analysis23,24,27, as follows. After spectral unmixing, fluorescence
signal was separated from background for each channel. Square root transform
followed by histogram matching was applied to intensity images for contrast
enhancement and standardization prior to segmentation. Florescence signal was
then separated from background using an intensity-based clustering algorithm
(multi-Otsu)67 combined with connected component labeling (see Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8). For each channel, the segmented binary mask was transformed into
a color-exclusive mask by excluding signal pixels shared with other channels.
Color-exclusive projection strength maps were then generated by computing the
ratio of signal pixels over background in 30 × 30 pixel-size non-overlapping
adjacent super-pixels. Finally, red, green and blue projection strength maps were
combined onto RGB interdigitation maps (see Supplementary Fig. 9). Projection
strength maps were generated together with confidence maps to account for
quantification errors due to multi-channel pixel exclusion. Confidence maps
were computed as the ratio of exclusive signal pixels over the total number of
signal pixels in the 30 × 30 pixel-size super-pixels (see Supplementary Fig. 10).
For quantitative analyses of cortical projections in the striatum (Fig. 6i, j), the
striatal area was first manually detoured based on the Allen Brain reference
atlas and associated interdigitation maps were generated (see Supplementary
Movie 14). Within each super-pixel, the relative contribution of red, green, and
blue projection strength was calculated and the distance to seven reference
points in the RGB color space ([1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1], [0.5 0.5 0], [0 0.5 0.5],
[0.5 0 0.5], [0.33 0.33 0.33]) was calculated. Each super-pixel was classified in the
category minimizing the distance in the RGB color space. This enabled to
identify super-pixels containing single, dual and triple projections. For the
analysis of cortical axons arbors in the caudoputamen (Fig. 6i), masks encom-
passing arborizing axons and terminals and excluding fiber tracts and ventral
striatal areas were manually detoured. For the analysis of corticofugal tracts
(Fig. 6j), the complementary masks encompassing passing fibers were used.
Since tracts exhibited systematically high signal levels at their center, this
resulted in residual spectral bleed-through despite the linear unmixing proce-
dure which was manually removed. Non-exclusive interdigitation masks were
considered for this analysis of fiber tract interdigitation, since it probes larger
structures than that of axonal arbors interdigitation. All the analyses were
implemented using custom-written Matlab (Mathworks,USA) scripts and Fiji64
(NIH,USA).
