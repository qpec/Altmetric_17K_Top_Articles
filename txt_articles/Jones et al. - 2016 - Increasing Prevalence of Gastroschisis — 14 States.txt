with all other racial/ethnic groups included in the total). The 
gastroschisis case definition was based on the British Pediatric 
Association Classification of Diseases code (756.71) or the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for gastroschisis 
(756.73, or before 10/1/2009, 756.79, with verification to 
confirm cases of gastroschisis, because the previous code was 
shared with omphalocele). Gastroschisis cases included live 
births, fetal deaths,† and elective terminations.§
Data were pooled at CDC, and gastroschisis prevalence was 
calculated for each year, maternal age group, and race/ethnic-
ity. Prevalence was calculated as number of gastroschisis cases 
among all birth outcomes divided by the total number of live 
births. The denominators of total number of live births in the 
same catchment area as the birth defects surveillance program 
were reported by states or obtained from public use data files. 
Poisson exact methods were used to calculate 95% CIs for 
each prevalence estimate. Prevalence ratios were calculated by 
dividing the prevalence during 2006–2012 by the prevalence 
during 1995–2005, and CIs for the prevalence ratios were 
calculated using Poisson regression.
Because the comparison of prevalence between the two study 
periods involved an artificial breakpoint during the 18-year 
data span and only examined pooled prevalence within those 
periods, joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify sta-
tistically significant changes in the annual prevalence of gastros-
chisis over the course of the entire study period (1995–2012). 
Joinpoint regression initially models annual trend data by 
fitting a straight line (i.e., zero joinpoints). Then, joinpoints 
are added, one at a time, and a Monte Carlo permutation test 
is used to determine the optimal number of joinpoints. Each 
joinpoint in the final model corresponds to a significant change 
in the trend, and an AAPC and its 95% CI are calculated to 
describe how the rate changes within each time interval (3). 
The estimated overall percent change was calculated by first 
converting the AAPC to the projected single year change in 
prevalence and then exponentiating to the number of years 
studied minus one to estimate the total increase throughout 
the 18 years. This gives the magnitude of the increase, which

Gastroschisis is a serious congenital defect in which the 
intestines protrude through an opening in the abdominal wall. 
Gastroschisis requires surgical repair soon after birth and is 
associated with an increased risk for medical complications and 
mortality during infancy. Reports from multiple surveillance 
systems worldwide have documented increasing prevalence 
of gastroschisis since the 1980s, particularly among younger 
mothers (1,2); however, since publication of a multistate U.S. 
report that included data through 2005 (1), it is not known 
whether prevalence has continued to increase. Data on gastros-
chisis from 14 population-based state surveillance programs 
were pooled and analyzed to assess the average annual percent 
change (AAPC) in prevalence and to compare the prevalence 
during 2006–2012 with that during 1995–2005, stratified 
by maternal age and race/ethnicity. The pooled data included 
approximately 29% of U.S. births for the period 1995–2012. 
During 1995–2012, gastroschisis prevalence increased in every 
category of maternal age and race/ethnicity, and the AAPC 
ranged from 3.1% in non-Hispanic white (white) mothers aged 
<20 years to 7.9% in non-Hispanic black (black) mothers aged 
<20 years. These corresponded to overall percentage increases 
during 1995–2012 that ranged from 68% in white mothers 
aged <20 years to 263% in black mothers aged <20 years. 
Gastroschisis prevalence increased 30% between the two peri-
ods, from 3.6 per 10,000 births during 1995–2005 to 4.9 per 
10,000 births during 2006–2012 (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–1.4), with the largest increase 
among black mothers aged <20 years (prevalence ratio = 2.0, 
95% CI: 1.6–2.5). Public health research is urgently needed 
to identify factors contributing to this increase.
To follow up on a study that included gastroschisis prevalence 
data from 15 states and reported a near doubling of gastroschi-
sis prevalence during 1995–2005 (1), CDC requested updated 
data from each of these states for 1995–2012. Fourteen states* 
provided data on gastroschisis cases crosstabulated by maternal 
age groups (<20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, 
and ≥35 years) and race/ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic,

is then converted to a percent increase. For example, an AAPC 
of 5 represents a projected single year change of 1.05, which 
would correspond to a 2.29-fold increase over the entire study 
period (1.05^17 = 2.29). This corresponds to an overall change 
of 129% ([2.29–1] x 100). The Joinpoint Regression Program, 
version 4.2.0 (National Cancer Institute), was used to conduct 
joinpoint regression.
During 1995–2005, 4,369 gastroschisis cases were detected 
among 12,014,244 live births (prevalence = 3.6 per 10,000 
live births, 95% CI: 3.5–3.7), and during 2006–2012, 4,497 
gastroschisis cases were detected among 9,264,540 live births 
(prevalence = 4.9 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 4.7–5.0). 
Comparing the two periods, gastroschisis prevalence increased 
30% (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.3–1.4) during 
2006–2012 compared with 1995–2005. The prevalence of 
gastroschisis increased over the course of the study period in 
each of the five maternal age groups (Figure).
Because fewer cases were detected among older maternal age 
groups, maternal age was collapsed into three groups (<20 years, 
20–24 years, and ≥25 years) to stratify the data simultaneously 
by maternal age and race/ethnicity. A significant increase in 
gastroschisis prevalence occurred in each maternal age group 
from the first period (1995–2005) to the second (2006–2012) 
(Table). Statistically significant increases comparing the two 
periods were seen in eight of the nine categories of maternal 
age and race/ethnicity assessed. Among mothers aged <20 years 
and 20–24 years, significant increases were seen in all racial/
ethnic groups examined. The prevalence of gastroschisis dur-
ing 2006–2012 among mothers aged <20 years was higher 
among white mothers (18.1 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 
16.7–19.7) and Hispanic mothers (16.1 per 10,000 live births, 
95% CI: 14.9–17.3) than among black mothers (10.2 per 
10,000 live births, 95% CI: 8.7–11.9); however, black mothers 
in this age group experienced the largest increase in prevalence,

which doubled between the two study periods (prevalence 
ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6–2.5).
Using Joinpoint regression to assess temporal trends within 
strata of maternal age and race/ethnicity, the AAPC indicated 
a significant increase in prevalence for all nine groups (Table). 
Zero joinpoints were identified for each of the nine strata, 
indicating that a single AAPC estimate was appropriate for the 
entire study period for each group. The two highest AAPCs 
among these strata were in black mothers aged <20 years and 
20–24 years. The AAPCs ranged from a low of 3.1 in white 
mothers aged <20 years to a high of 7.9 in black mothers aged 
<20 years. These corresponded to overall percent increases from 
1995 to 2012 that ranged from 68% in white mothers aged 
<20 years to 263% in black mothers aged <20 years.
Discussion
The prevalence of gastroschisis increased significantly dur-
ing the study period, and prevalence has continued to increase 
beyond 2005, the end of the period included in the previous 
multistate report (1). Gastroschisis is associated with young 
maternal age, with the highest prevalence among mothers aged 
<20 years; however, significant increases in prevalence were seen 
in all age groups during 2006–2012 compared with 1995–2005. 
The greatest increases in prevalence occurred among younger, 
black mothers, but the prevalence in black mothers remains 
lower than in white and Hispanic mothers. Joinpoint analyses 
demonstrated a steady and significant increase in prevalence 
across all assessed categories of maternal age and race/ethnicity.
Increases in gastroschisis prevalence have been reported both 
in the United States and internationally, but the current evidence 
has not led to the identification of the underlying cause or causes 
of these increases (1,2). The association between young maternal 
age and gastroschisis was first reported in the late 1970s, and 
this risk factor has been documented consistently in subsequent 
studies (4–6). However, the increased prevalence of gastroschisis 
is not because of an increase in teen births, which have declined 
in recent years, or to a change in the distribution of births to teen 
mothers, as birth rates have decreased among women of all ages 
<20 years (7). Investigators in Norway reported an independent 
association of young paternal age with gastroschisis, after account-
ing for maternal age (6). In addition, year of delivery, mother’s 
year of birth, and father’s year of birth were each significantly 
associated with increasing gastroschisis prevalence from 1967 to 
1998 (6). Epidemiologic patterns indicate that lifestyle behaviors, 
environmental exposures, or other risk factors disproportionately 
affecting young women might play a role. A 2008 review noted 
that risk factors associated with gastroschisis, after adjusting for 
maternal age, have included lower socioeconomic status, lower 
body mass index and other indicators of poor nutrition (lower 
intake of high quality nutrients and dietary fats), smoking, use of 
illicit drugs, alcohol, or analgesic medications, and genitourinary 
infections (5). Additionally, among multiparous and multigravida 
mothers, a change in paternity since the previous pregnancy has 
been associated with gastroschisis (5). Studies have also indicated 
possible age-specific associations between gastroschisis and prior 
pregnancy loss (8), as well as with certain infections (9).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, because no information on risk factors other than 
maternal age and race/ethnicity was requested from state surveil-
lance programs, potential causes for the increase in prevalence 
could not be examined. Second, not all states were able to pro-
vide data as far back as 1995. However, incomplete data for the 
earlier years of the study is unlikely to affect the results. Because 
data were pooled for 1995–2005, the prevalence estimates for 
that earlier study period are more heavily influenced by the later 
years of that time frame. Previous research has demonstrated 
an increase in prevalence from 1995 to 2005; therefore, the 
missing data from earlier years in this study is likely to result 
in prevalence ratios that are biased slightly and conservatively 
toward the null. Finally, it is possible that the increase in preva-
lence could be due to improved ascertainment of gastroschisis 
cases over time. However, this is unlikely because gastroschisis 
is immediately apparent at birth. Additionally, omphalocele, 
a defect that has a similar presentation at birth and previously 
shared an ICD-9-CM code with gastroschisis, is not increasing 
in prevalence, making it implausible that the increase observed 
is due to any confusion between these defects (10).
These findings have implications for prioritizing public health 
research on gastroschisis to identify factors contributing to the high 
risk associated with young maternal age and factors associated with 
the increasing prevalence over the past 20 years. Gastroschisis is 
unusual among birth defects in that it disproportionately affects 
younger mothers, a vulnerable population. The continued increase 
in age-adjusted prevalence and the pace of the increase suggests 
that unidentified risk factors might be contributing. Identification 
of these risk factors is needed to inform public health interven-
tions and reduce prevalence. Ongoing surveillance is essential to 
monitor any further increases in prevalence.

Summary
What is already known on this topic?
Gastroschisis is strongly associated with young maternal age, 
and a previous U.S. report indicated that the prevalence of 
gastroschisis nearly doubled from 1995 to 2005.
What is added by this report?
Gastroschisis prevalence has increased for all maternal age 
groups. Significant increases as measured by the average 
annual percent change were observed for all assessed catego-
ries of maternal age and race/ethnicity. The largest estimated 
increase over the 18 year period (263% overall percent change) 
was observed for non-Hispanic black mothers aged <20 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The observed increases in gastroschisis prevalence are not 
explained by demographic changes in maternal age or race/
ethnicity. Public health research is urgently needed to identify 
the causal factor(s) contributing to this increase.
