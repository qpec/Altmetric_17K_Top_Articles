Functional MRI of disease progression
in Parkinson disease and atypical
parkinsonian syndromes
ABSTRACT
Objective: To explore longitudinal changes in brain activity in patients with Parkinson disease (PD),
multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) using task-based func-
tional MRI (fMRI).
Methods: A total of 112 individuals were scanned 1 year apart while performing a unimanual grip
force task: 46 PD, 13 MSA, 19 PSP, and 34 healthy controls. The outcome measure was percent
signal change in prespecified regions of interest: putamen, primary motor cortex (M1), supple-
mentary motor area (SMA), and superior motor regions of the cerebellum (lobules V–VI).
Results: Patients with PD showed a decline in functional activity over the course of 1 year in the
putamen and M1 compared to controls. Changes after 1 year in MSA were exclusively extrastria-
tal, and included a reduction in functional activity in M1, SMA, and superior cerebellum. In PSP, all
regions of interest were less active at 1 year compared to baseline. The functional activity of
these regions did not change in the control group.
Conclusions: We provide evidence using task-based fMRI for cortical and striatal functional dete-
rioration in PD over a 1-year period of time. Results also describe more widespread and unique
patterns of functional changes in MSA and PSP compared to PD, suggesting distinct rates of dis-
ease progression in parkinsonian disorders that may assist in future clinical studies testing the
potential efficacy of disease-modifying therapies. Neurology® 2016;87:709–717

Major efforts are focused on treatments that slow the progression of Parkinson disease (PD) and
atypical parkinsonian syndromes.1,2 To facilitate this effort, it is important to gain a better
understanding of the rate of progression of functional brain changes in these disorders. In vivo
radiotracer imaging has been used to study the progression of the nigrostriatal circuit and shown
that the rate of dopaminergic loss in the striatum is greater in patients with PD than in normal
aging, but with time it becomes less prominent.3,4 Furthermore, patients with early-stage hemi-
parkinsonism have a steeper decline in the putamen contralateral to the affected side than in the
putamen contralateral to the unaffected side.5,6 As for atypical parkinsonian syndromes, the
literature is sparse, with one study showing a greater decline in striatal b-CIT binding of atypical
parkinsonian disorders than PD.7 Although these studies provide key insights into progression of
dopaminergic degeneration in parkinsonism, they are focused exclusively on the nigrostriatal
circuit.8 Since the annual loss of cortical D2 receptors in PD was estimated to be up to 3 times
faster than the rate previously reported in putamen,9 objective markers for disease progression
may also be found in the cerebral cortex.

 Motor control studies using functional MRI
(fMRI) engage an extensive task-related net-
work including the basal ganglia, cerebellum,
and motor cortex in healthy individuals, and
abnormal activation of these structures in PD,
multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progres-
sive supranuclear palsy (PSP).10–15 Although
the use of MRI in parkinsonian disorders has
increased in recent years,16–20 there are no lon-
gitudinal studies that monitor and compare the
progression of cortical and subcortical function
between these disorders. The purpose of this
study was to assay functional changes over the
course of 1 year in key regions of the basal
ganglia, cerebellum, and motor cortex in PD,
MSA, and PSP using a unimanual grip force
fMRI protocol.10–15 We hypothesized that the
basal ganglia and motor cortex would have
reduced fMRI signal in PD, MSA, and PSP
when compared with the control group over 1
year, and that both MSA and PSP would have
widespread and more pronounced cortical
changes than PD.
METHODS Participants. Participants in this cohort study
included 46 patients with PD, 13 patients with MSA, 19 patients
with PSP, and 34 controls (table 1). All participants were tested at
baseline and 1 year. Patients were referred from the University of
Florida Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration
and were diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist.21–23 Con-
trol participants were recruited from surrounding communities.
At the time of recruitment, average diagnosis period was stable for
over 3 years, and patients’ diagnoses did not change over the
course of the study. Most patients were taking medication, but
all testing was performed 12–14 hours after overnight withdrawal
of antiparkinsonian medication.24 The total levodopa equivalent
daily dose (LEDD)25 for each group is listed in table 1, and the
treatment regimen for each patient is described in table e-1 on the
Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Florida, and written informed consent
to participate in the study was obtained from all participants.
Clinical assessment. Participants were administered the motor
section of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Dis-
ease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III),26 Purdue Pegboard Test
(PPB),27 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),28 and Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI).29 MDS-UPDRS-III was used to
calculate total motor severity, hemibody motor scores (side-specific
items for limbs only: 3–8, 15–17), total bradykinesia (items 4–8, 14),
and posture and gait (items 9–13) (table 1). Hemibody motor scores
at baseline were contrasted in order to select the hand patients had to
use inside the MRI scanner. The hand corresponding to the side of
the body with a higher motor score was defined as the more affected
hand and was tested at baseline and 1 year.
Force acquisition. Participants produced force against a custom-
designed MRI-compatible fiber optic transducer with a resolution
of 0.025 N (Neuroimaging Solutions, Gainesville, FL). Force
data were sampled at 125 Hz by an SM130 Fiber Optic
Interrogator (Micron Optics, Atlanta, GA), and recorded by
a LabVIEW program (National Instruments, Austin, TX).
Force task. Prior to MRI, participants were trained on the task
and the grip maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was mea-
sured using a Jamar pinch gauge. The target force level was set at
15% of MVC for each visit. Patients were required to produce force
with the more affected hand, while for controls we balanced hand
use (table 1). The protocol consisted of a block design that alter-
nated force and rest blocks: 30 seconds rest, 30 seconds force with
feedback, 12.5 seconds rest, and 30 seconds force without feed-
back.10–15 This sequence was repeated 4 times and there was an
additional 30-second rest period at the end. Throughout the scan, 2
bars were displayed on an LCD monitor that participants could see
through a mirror mounted on the head coil: a target bar and a force
bar. A change in color of the force bar cued participants to either
push or release the force sensor. Green was a go signal for producing
and sustaining force (2 seconds), while red indicated a rest period
(1 seconds). Force was produced in the presence of feedback as well
as in the absence of feedback. In the feedback condition, the target
bar was stationary at 15% MVC, while the force bar moved in the
vertical plane according to the force output. Instructions were to
produce force in order to bring the force bar on top of the target bar
for each 2-second period. In the no-feedback condition, both target
and force bars were stationary. Participants were required to
produce and maintain 15% MVC during each 2-second period
without feedback, and the timing of the force contractions was
controlled by the same green and red bars.
Force analysis. Force was filtered using a 10th-order Butter-
worth filter with a cutoff of 15 Hz.10,14,15 Custom algorithms in
MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) were used to
calculate mean force during the 2-second hold period as %MVC.
MRI acquisition. Data were collected on a 3T Philips system
(Best, the Netherlands) with a 32-channel SENSE head coil. The
protocol included a T2*-weighted, single-shot, echoplanar pulse
sequence (repetition time [TR] 5 2,500 ms, echo time [TE] 5
30 ms, flip angle 5 808, field of view 5 240 mm2, voxel size 5
3 mm isotropic) and an anatomical 3D T1-weighted sequence
(TR 5 8.2 ms, TE 5 3.7 ms, flip angle 5 88, field of view 5
240 mm2, voxel size 5 1 mm isotropic).
MRI analysis. Processing steps were based on previous studies of
grip force in parkinsonian disorders.10–15 The outcome measure was
percent signal change during force production. This was calculated
for a 15-second period (spanning 6 TRs) towards the end of each
force block,10 in the following prespecified regions of interest
(ROIs): contralateral putamen, ispilateral putamen, contralateral
primary motor cortex (M1), contralateral supplementary motor
area (SMA), and ipsilateral superior cerebellum (lobules V-VI),
where contralateral and ipsilateral are defined with respect to the
hand tested. The putamen was extracted from the Basal Ganglia
Human Area Template,30 M1 and SMA from the Human Motor
Area Template,31 and the cerebellum ROI was defined based on
the Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial Template and spanned lobules
V–VI (figure e-1).32
Statistics. First, we examined group differences at baseline. Dif-
ferences in age and sex were assessed using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and Pearson x2. Next, age and sex were
included as covariates in a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)
for continuous data. Pearson x2 was used in the remaining
categorical data. Imaging data were compared among the 4
groups using MANOVA, with age, sex, and MoCA as covariates.

 Longitudinal changes in outcome measures were calculated
by subtracting baseline values from 1-year follow-up values.
One-year changes in clinical and force measures were compared
between groups using ANOVA, while adjusting for sex, baseline
differences in age, and the tested measure. We utilized a similar
approach with imaging data. For each ROI, we ran ANOVA
on the 1-year difference in percent signal change, while account-
ing for differences in sex, and baseline differences in age, MoCA,
and percent signal change in that particular ROI. Group effects
were followed up with post hoc comparisons. Also, a separate uni-
variate analysis was performed on the data from the control
group. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR), and consid-
ered significant whenever pFDR , 0.05.33
RESULTS Baseline clinical and force data. We found
group differences at baseline in age (pFDR 5
0.028) and sex (pFDR 5 0.044). Overall, mean age
of patients with PSP was greater than that of controls
and patients with PD (pFDR , 0.05), but not dif-
ferent from that of patients with MSA (pFDR 5
0.827) (table 1). There were more men than women
in the PD and MSA groups, but more women than
men in the control and PSP groups. The ratios
for handedness, and whether the hand tested was
the left/right hand, or the dominant/nondominant
hand did not differ across groups (pFDR . 0.05).

 No group differences were found between scans
(pFDR 5 0.407).
Of note, upcoming results are adjusted for differ-
ences in age and sex. We found a group effect for
MVC (pFDR 5 0.027), with patients with MSA
and patients with PSP having a lower MVC than
controls (pFDR , 0.05), and no differences in
MVC between patients with PD and controls, or
among the 3 patient groups (pFDR . 0.05). Further
group effects were found for PPB (pFDR 5 0.002),
MoCA (pFDR 5 0.002), and BDI (pFDR 5 0.002).
Post hoc comparisons revealed that all patients placed
fewer pegs than controls (pFDR . 0.05). When com-
paring the 3 groups of patients, results showed that
patients with PD performed better than patients with
MSA and patients with PSP (pFDR , 0.05), with no
difference in performance between MSA and PSP
(pFDR 5 0.400). MoCA scores did not differ between
controls and patients with PD (pFDR 5 0.096), but
were lower in patients with MSA and patients with
PSP as compared to the other 2 groups (pFDR ,
0.05). Scores did not differ between patients with
MSA and patients with PSP (pFDR 5 0.947). BDI
scores were higher in patients as compared to controls
(pFDR , 0.05), and differed across patient groups
such that patients with PD had the lowest scores, pa-
tients with PSP the highest, while patients with MSA
had intermediate scores. The 3 patient groups differed
on the Hoehn & Yahr stage (pFDR 5 0.006) and the
following MDS-UPDRS-III scores: total motor sever-
ity (pFDR 5 0.010), total bradykinesia (pFDR 5
0.003), and posture and gait (pFDR 5 0.003). Specif-
ically, we found that patients with PD were overall less
impaired than patients with patients with MSA and
patients with PSP (pFDR , 0.05), and that there were
no differences in motor symptoms between patients
with MSA and patients with PSP (pFDR . 0.05).
Disease duration, total LEDD, and severity of symp-
toms on the tested side/other side did not differ among
patients with PD, patients with MSA, and patients
with PSP (pFDR . 0.05). Mean force during the
2-second hold period did not differ between groups
(pFDR 5 0.151): controls 5 13.26%MVC, patients
with PD 5 12.15%MVC, patients with MSA 5
16.01%MVC, and patients with PSP 5 13.15%
MVC.
Baseline imaging data. Between-group differences in
percent signal change at baseline adjusted for age,
sex, and MoCA were found in all ROIs: contralateral
putamen (pFDR 5 0.002), ipsilateral putamen
(pFDR 5 0.003), contralateral M1 (pFDR 5
0.002), contralateral SMA (pFDR 5 0.006), and ipsi-
lateral superior cerebellum (pFDR 5 0.002). Patients
with PD had reduced percent signal change compared
to controls in the contralateral putamen, contralateral
M1, and ipsilateral superior cerebellum (pFDR ,
0.05), but not in the ipsilateral putamen and contra-
lateral SMA (pFDR . 0.05) (figure 1). In MSA, we
found reduced percent signal change compared to
controls in the contralateral putamen (pFDR 5
0.042), but not other ROIs (pFDR . 0.05). The
PSP group had reduced percent signal change com-
pared to controls in all ROIs, and reduced percent
signal change compared to patients with PD in the
ipsilateral putamen and contralateral M1 (pFDR ,
0.05). When comparing the 2 forms of atypical par-
kinsonism, patients with PSP had lower percent sig-
nal change than patients with MSA in M1 only
(pFDR 5 0.027).
Longitudinal clinical and force data. The longitudinal
analysis revealed no group differences after 1 year in
the following measures: MVC, MoCA, and mean
force during hold (pFDR . 0.05). Also, we found
no changes in MVC over time in any of the groups
(pFDR . 0.05). The 1-year change in PPB
performance
differed
across
groups
(pFDR
5
0.005). Bimanual coordination deteriorated in all
patient groups as compared to controls, and even
further in patients with MSA and patients with PSP
as compared to patients with PD (pFDR , 0.05).

 PSP was comparable (pFDR 5 0.195). The change in
BDI was different between groups (pFDR 5 0.048).
Overall, patients with PSP had a greater BDI increase
than controls and patients with PD (pFDR , 0.05). We
found between-group differences in MDS-UPDRS-III
(pFDR 5 0.006), severity of symptoms on the other
side (pFDR 5 0.010), total bradykinesia (pFDR 5
0.004), and posture and gait (pFDR 5 0.003). There
was a greater increase in motor severity (all measures) in
PSP as compared to PD (pFDR , 0.05), but no
difference in these measures with respect to the MSA
group (pFDR . 0.05). Patients with MSA had a greater
increase in total motor severity and decline of posture
and gait than patients with PD (pFDR , 0.05). Finally,
changes in the severity of symptoms on the tested side
did not differ between patient groups (pFDR 5 0.059).
Longitudinal imaging data. Table 2 lists mean percent
signal change at baseline and 1 year in all ROIs (unad-
justed for other measures). Table 3 lists p values cor-
responding to group statistics for baseline and
longitudinal imaging data. Figure 2 shows the differ-
ence from baseline to 1 year in percent signal change
for each group and ROI, adjusted for the following
measures at baseline: age, sex, MoCA, and percent
signal change in each ROI. For all ROIs, we found
a group effect on the 1-year change in percent signal
change: contralateral putamen (pFDR 5 0.005),
ipsilateral putamen (pFDR 5 0.005), contralateral
M1 (pFDR 5 0.003), contralateral SMA (pFDR 5
0.003), and ipsilateral superior cerebellum (pFDR 5
0.003).
The
within-group
analysis
in
controls
revealed no change in percent signal change after
1-year in any of the ROIs (pFDR . 0.05). In PD,
patients had a reduction in percent signal change
compared to controls in the contralateral putamen,
ipsilateral putamen, and contralateral M1 (pFDR ,
0.05). Patients with MSA had a decrease in percent
signal change compared to controls in M1, SMA, and
superior cerebellum, whereas patients with PSP had
a decline in functional activity compared to controls
in all 5 ROIs (pFDR\ , 0.05). The decline in M1 was
greater in patients with MSA than in patients with
PD and patients with PSP (pFDR , 0.05), while the
decline in SMA was greater in MSA than in PD
(pFDR 5 0.003), but not PSP (pFDR 5 0.056).
DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that task-
related fMRI signal reflects different patterns of
disease progression in PD, MSA, and PSP. Using
a motor control paradigm,10–15 we found a decline in
fMRI signal over the course of 1 year of putamen and
M1 in patients with PD compared with controls.
Further, when compared with controls, a reduction
in functional activity was observed in M1, SMA, and
superior cerebellum in MSA, and a decline in all ROIs
in PSP. Importantly, functional brain activity in
controls did not change over 1 year. Collectively,
these findings point to disease-specific noninvasive
progression markers of sensorimotor brain regions in
parkinsonian disorders.

 Results in PD demonstrate ongoing functional
deterioration over the course of 1 year in the basal
ganglia, with a bilateral reduction in percent signal
change in the putamen, and a slightly greater effect
in the putamen ipsilateral to the tested side. These
findings are consistent with a previous PET study
in PD with a comparable level of disability, which
identified a greater decline in [18F]-CIT uptake in
the putamen ipsilateral to the more affected side.34
We extend the existing literature on PD by showing
that functional activity of the primary motor cortex,
which has been consistently shown to be reduced in

 these patients,10–15 continues to deteriorate with disease
progression. Thus, it appears that defective basal gan-
glia signaling in PD leads to long-term changes that
propagate along the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical
loop, suggesting modulation of cortical motor output
as an additional biomarker for treatment of PD.35
The progression of functional brain changes in
atypical parkinsonian syndromes has been scarcely
documented. A longitudinal b-CIT SPECT study
found a greater decline in striatal binding over the
course of 2 years in a heterogeneous group of atypical
patients than in patients with PD.7 Here, we extend
existing work, and further characterize MSA and PSP
as having a more symmetric functional loss in the
putamen than PD, which may be linked to the fact
that these patients often present with bilateral symp-
toms of similar severity (table 1).36 In addition, we
show different patterns of functional decline in MSA
and PSP across subcortical and cortical structures (fig-
ure 2). For instance, despite a low functional activity
at baseline in all cortical and subcortical regions in
PSP, this group continued to decline over time. By
contrast, patients with MSA had a steeper decline in
functional activity of M1, SMA, and superior cere-
bellum than patients with PSP, regions where initially
patients with MSA had greater fMRI signal than pa-
tients with PSP. Together, these findings suggest the
motor system is differentially affected with disease
progression in PD, MSA, and PSP. Since both
MSA and PSP involve extensive pathology in extra-
nigral structures including the brainstem and cerebel-
lum,2,37 which is also detected using diffusion MRI,38
the more rapid decline of functional activity in these
disorders may be partly modulated by abnormalities
outside the investigated brain networks. For example,
it could be that the steeper decline in functional activ-
ity in atypical patients is related to progression of
brain atrophy. A previous longitudinal structural
MRI study has shown that 1 year of disease progres-
sion in patients with MSA is associated with increased
brain atrophy in several extrastriatal regions including
the primary sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex,
and cerebellum, and this is more prominent in those
patients with longer disease duration.39 By contrast,
PSP has a different pattern of structural changes at the
level of the rostral midbrain and superior cerebellar
peduncle14,40 that may affect brain networks and
could relate to the current progression findings.
Furthermore, the lack of change in functional activity
in the control group suggests that the pattern of
fMRI changes observed cannot be explained by nor-
mal aging. Although the groups produced a similar
level of force, this does not rule out the possibility
of results being influenced by other factors such as
apathy, which is commonly observed in atypical
parkinsonism.2
Overall, we provide evidence using task-based
fMRI for distinct patterns of motor-related changes
across the basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamo-cortical
loops in PD, MSA, and PSP. These findings could pro-
vide a platform to evaluate therapeutic strategies aimed
at slowing the progression in parkinsonian disorders.
It is essential, however, that future studies expand
current research by further evaluating progression
of clinical subtypes of PD (tremor-dominant/
non-tremor-dominant), or atypical parkinsonian syn-
dromes (MSA-P/MSA-C), which in turn may prompt
the assessment of additional progression markers.
