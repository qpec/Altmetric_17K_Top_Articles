SUMMARY
Cerebral organoids, three-dimensional cultures that
model organogenesis, provide a new platform to
investigatehuman brain development. Highcost, vari-
ability, and tissue heterogeneity limit their broad
applications. Here, we developed a miniaturized spin-
ning bioreactor (SpinU) to generate forebrain-specific
organoids from human iPSCs. These organoids reca-
pitulate key features of human cortical development,
including progenitor zone organization, neurogene-
sis, gene expression, and, notably, a distinct human-
specific outer radial glia cell layer. We also developed
protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic organoids.
Finally, we employed the forebrain organoid platform
to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Quantitative an-
alyses revealed preferential, productive infection of
neural progenitors with either African or Asian ZIKV
strains. ZIKV infection leads to increased cell death
and reduced proliferation, resulting in decreased
neuronal cell-layer volume resembling microcephaly.
Together, our brain-region-specific organoids and
SpinU provide an accessible and versatile platform
for modeling human brain development and disease
and for compound testing, including potential ZIKV
antiviral drugs.
INTRODUCTION
Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can generate
virtually any cell type in the body to model human development
and disease, screen for therapeutic drugs, and develop cell-
replacement therapies. Traditional monolayer cultures allow for
external control of targeted differentiation of human iPSCs to
produce more uniform cell populations; however, these cultures
lack 3D cell assembly properties that define endogenous biolog-
ical systems. Structures resembling whole developing organs,
named organoids, have recently been generated via 3D cultures
and include intestinal, kidney, retinal, and cerebral organoids
(Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Yin et al., 2016). Organoid tech-
nology evolved from embryoid body cultures, which are 3D
aggregates of stem cells that self-organize to develop disparate
tissues in vitro, similar to teratoma formation in vivo. Organoids
provide a unique opportunity to model human organogenesis,
which is not accessible to experimentation. An immediate

 application of organoid technology would be to address the cur-
rent global public health emergency concerning a suspected link
between Zika virus (ZIKV) and microcephaly, a neurodevelop-
mental disorder, by modeling human brain development.
One recent advance in cerebral organoid technology was the
adoption of a spinning bioreactor to facilitate nutrient and oxy-
gen absorption, which enables formation of longer neuroepithe-
lium-like zones and supports growth of large, complex organoids
that more closely resemble the developing human brain than had
been achieved by previous approaches (Lancaster et al., 2013).
Derived from an early NASA-designed rotating wall vessel biore-
actor to simulate microgravity, this technology potentially offers
two additional benefits: (1) low fluid shear stress to promote cell-
cell interactions and induction of differentiation (Goodwin et al.,
1993) and (2) randomized gravitational vectors that affect intra-
cellular signal transduction and gene expression (Jessup et al.,
1993). This and other human cerebral organoid technologies
(Kadoshima et al., 2013; Lancaster et al., 2013; Mariani et al.,
2015; Muguruma et al., 2015; Pas
xca et al., 2015) have generated
much excitement for using organoids to model human brain
development and disorders.
Despite the promise of these pioneering organoid technolo-
gies, there are several major challenges. First, available spinning
bioreactors require a large volume of medium and incubator
space (Figure S1Aa). With frequent media changes over several
months of culturing, the system is cost prohibitive for most lab-
oratories and precludes scalability, use of growth factors, or
chemical screening. It also presents a roadblock for testing
different conditions to optimize protocols. Second, the current
cerebral organoid methodology (‘‘intrinsic protocol’’) is based
on cell self-assembly without external control, and thus each
organoid is typically comprised of diverse cell types found in
forebrain, hindbrain, and retina (Lancaster et al., 2013). Large
sample-to-sample variability associated with current methods
complicates quantitative analyses and limits applicability. Third,
key features of human brain development have yet to be robustly
recapitulated in cerebral organoids. For example, unlike rodents,
the embryonic human cerebral cortex contains an abundant
population of specialized outer radial glia cells (oRGCs) in the
outer subventricular zone (oSVZ), the cellular population consid-
ered pivotal to the evolutionary increase in human cortex size
and complexity (Lui et al., 2011). Current cerebral organoids
contain only sparse progenitors that have morphological charac-
teristics of oRGCs, and none have exhibited a well-developed
oSVZ layer. Taken together, there is a critical need to develop
an organoid platform with reduced cost, higher throughput,
and increased reproducibility and one that better resembles crit-
ical aspects of human cortical development.
To address these challenges, we engineered a miniaturized
spinning bioreactor using 3D design and printing technology
and developed a protocol to generate forebrain-specific organo-
ids from human iPSCs, which recapitulate human embryonic
cortical development in a reproducible and quantifiable manner.
We also developed protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic or-
ganoids. For proof-of-principle applications of our platform, we
performed chemical compound testing and modeled ZIKV expo-
sure. Our versatile, simple-to-use, cost-effective, and reproduc-
ible brain-region-specific organoid platform provides accessible
and affordable technology to a broad scientific community for
modeling human organogenesis and human disorders and for
compound testing.
RESULTS
A Miniaturized Spinning Bioreactor to Optimize
Organoid Cultures
To reduce the cost of generating organoids under different con-
ditions, we attempted to miniaturize the large spinning flask.
Nonlinear fluid dynamics precluded simply scaling down the sys-
tem. Instead, we engineered a multi-well spinning device to fit a
standard 12-well tissue culture plate. Above the cover, spinning
shafts are attached to a set of 13 interconnecting gears, driven
by a single electric motor (Figure 1A). We used computer-aided
design software to design and 3D print each component. We
assembled prototypes to optimize designs that sustain organo-
ids of varying sizes in suspension under moderate spinning
speed and prevent aggregation at the center of each well. After
multiple rounds of systematic optimization of individual compo-
nents, including number, shape, size, and angle of leafs and
diameter, length, and shape of shafts, we arrived at SpinU, a
miniaturized spinning bioreactor unit that requires as little as
2 ml of media per well, a 50-fold reduction in media consump-
tion, and drastically reduced incubator space (Figure S1Ab).
We further designed a modular stackable version with insertable
cassettes driven by one common motor (Figure S1Ac). The mini-
aturized spinning bioreactor permits comparisons of a large
number of conditions in parallel for protocol optimization.
To reduce tissue heterogeneity, we pre-patterned embryoid
bodies to the fate of a specific brain region. We first treated hu-
man iPSCs with dual SMAD inhibitors (dorsomorphin and A-83)
for 7 days and then embedded embryoid bodies in Matrigel for
another 7 days, followed by Matrigel removal and spinning in
SpinU (Figure 1B). Compared to the ‘‘intrinsic protocol,’’ we
could reliably generate organoids from multiple iPSC lines with
reduced heterogeneity in organoid shape and size (Figures
S1B and S1C). However, there was significant cell death within
organoids, as shown by activated caspase-3 (CAS3) immuno-
staining (Figures S1D and S1E and Table S1). We then tested
combinations of different signaling molecules for various dura-
tions. We found that treatment with three factors, GSK-3b inhib-
itor CHIR99021, recombinant WNT3A protein, and SMAD inhib-
itor SB-431542, during the Matrigel stage drastically reduced
the number of CAS3+ cells at day 14 (Figures S1D and S1E).
Later, we determined that the WNT3A contribution was minimal,
likely because WNT3A and CHIR99021 activate the same
downstream signaling pathway (Figures S1D–S1F). At day 14,
well-defined polarized neuroepithelium-like structures resem-
bled neural tubes, with a nearly pure population of NESTIN+
SOX2+ NPCs and expression of adherent junction markers
(b-CATENIN and PKCl) and proliferation marker phospho-
histone H3 (PH3) near the ventricular surface (Figures 1C and
S1F). Notably, individual neuroepithelium-like structures were
consistently much larger than those generated without treatment
of these factors (Figure S1D). Upon spinning in SpinU, organoids
developed into multi-layer stratified structures, composed of
SOX2+ NPCs, TBR2+ intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), and

 CTIP2+ neurons (Figure 1D). With a small volume, it became
affordable to supplement media with growth factors at later
stages (Figure 1B).
In comparison, we maintained organoids in stationary cultures
after day 14. At day 42, there was substantial cell death in the
interior (Figure S1G). Ventricular structures were largely absent;
instead, extensive neurogenesis without defined organization
was observed (Figure S1H). We also cultured forebrain organo-
ids using orbital shakers under a similar rotation speed as spin-
ning in SpinU. At day 42, organoids showed substantial cell
death in the neuronal layer despite retaining defined ventricular
structures (Figure S1I). These results suggest that spinning
cultures enhance cell viability and promote maintenance of the
stem cell niche, at least for forebrain organoids generated using
our protocol. The miniaturized spinning bioreactor platform
opens doors for cost-effective generation of organoids and
provides accessible and affordable organoid technology to a
broader scientific community.
Organoids with a Forebrain Identity and Increased
Homogeneity
We next performed detailed characterizations of early stage
forebrain organoids (Figure 1B). At day 14, immunohistological
analysis showed almost exclusive expression of forebrain-spe-
cific progenitor markers, including PAX6, OTX2, and FOXG1,
with minimal expression of markers for other brain regions tested
(Figures 2A and S2A). We obtained similar results with multiple
iPSC lines and with different clones (Figures 2A, S2A, and

 S2B). Consistent with previous findings, cerebral organoids
generated in large spinning flasks using the ‘‘intrinsic protocol’’
exhibited diverse brain region identities with fewer than 50% of
rosettes expressing PAX6 or OTX2 (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B).
We further assessed the temporal consistency of neuronal dif-
ferentiation by quantifying the relative thickness of SOX2+ ven-
tricular zone-like (VZ) layer and TUJ1+ neuronal layer between
apical and basal surfaces at specific time points (Figure 2B). At
day 14, organoids generated using the ‘‘intrinsic protocol’’ ex-
hibited varying degrees of neurogenesis with mixed cell types,
whereas very few TUJ1+ neurons were detected in forebrain
organoids (Figure S2A). As a result, our protocol produced orga-
noids with nearly all cells organized in the VZ layer at this stage
(Figure 2B). By day 28, we observed a consistent ratio between
SOX2+ progenitor layer and TUJ1+/CTIP2+ neuronal layer in fore-
brain organoids, compared to the large variability using the
‘‘intrinsic protocol’’ (Figures 2C and 2D).
The apparent homogeneity of forebrain organoids, small vol-
ume per condition, and multi-well format of SpinU comprise a
platform that is amenable to chemical compound testing. As
a proof of principle, we tested the effect of Bisphenol A (BPA),
which is commonly found in household plastic products and is
known to affect rodent neural development (Kundakovic et al.,
2013). Treatment of forebrain organoids from days 14 to 28
with BPA led to a dose-dependent decrease in the relative VZ
thickness at day 28 (Figures 2E and 2F). With acute treatment
of higher BPA concentrations for 24 hr and then pulse-labeling
proliferating cells with EdU (Figure S2C), quantitative analysis
showed decreased density of EdU+ or PH3+ NPCs (Figures
S2D and S2E), indicating that reduced NPC proliferation contrib-
utes to decreased relative VZ thickness.
Multiple Progenitor Zones Recapitulating Human
Embryonic Cortical Development
To characterize developmental dynamics, we systematically
performed immunohistochemical analyses of day 28, 56, and
84 organoids. We observed well-defined VZ-like structures
with packed SOX2+ NPCs near the lumen at all three time points
(Figures 3A–3C). At day 28, a layer containing a mixture of TBR2+
IPCs and CTIP2+ neurons formed above the VZ, reminiscent of
the preplate (PP) in human cortical development (Figure 3A).
By day 56, distinct SVZ-like structures containing a mixture
of SOX2+ NPCs, TBR2+ IPCs, and immature neurons formed
above VZ, whereas cortical plate-like (CP) structures containing
pure CTIP2+ neurons formed above VZ and SVZ (Figure 3B).
One hallmark of embryonic human cerebral cortex is the prom-
inence of specialized oRGCs in the oSVZ layer (Lui et al., 2011).
Similar to the developing human cortex, a thin gap appeared to
separate the expanded SVZ in day 84 organoids into an inner
SVZ-like (iSVZ) region that contained densely packed TBR2+
IPCs and an oSVZ-like region (Figure 3C). Recent studies
have identified markers preferentially expressed by oRGCs in
the developing human cortex, including HOPX, FAM107A, and
PTPRZ1 (Pollen et al., 2015; Thomsen et al., 2015). Using anti-
bodies that we validated with gestational week 22 (GW22) hu-
man tissue (Figure S3A), we found a large number of SOX2+
HOPX+ oRGCs in day 84 organoids (Figure 3D). Previous
cerebral organoid protocols generated only sparse NPCs with
apparent oRGC characteristics, which did not organize into a
progenitor layer outside of VZ. In contrast, our forebrain organo-
ids exhibited a distinct SOX2+HOPX+ oSVZ-like layer separated
from the SOX2+HOPX- VZ layer (Figure 3D). We sometimes
observed HOPX+ radially oriented basal processes from these
oRGCs with pial contact but lacking an apical process (Fig-
ure S3B), a hallmark of human oRGCs (Hansen et al., 2010) (Fig-
ure S3A). Two other oRGC markers, FAM107A and PTPRZ1,
were also specifically expressed in oSVZ (Figures 3E and 3G).
Many oSVZ SOX2+ progenitors were Ki67+, indicating active
cell division in this region (Figure 3F).
The presence of a prominent oRGC-like population in day 84
forebrain organoids offers an opportunity to track the time
course of oRGC marker expression during organoid develop-
ment. A recent study showed that oSVZ-exclusive expression
of HOPX, FAM107A, and PTPRZ1 does not occur in the devel-
oping human cortex until gestational weeks 15–20 (Pollen
et al., 2015). Interestingly, very limited HOPX expression was
detected in day 28 organoids, while at day 56 its expression
was prominent in both VZ and SVZ, but not exclusive to SVZ
(Figure S3C).
Together, these results demonstrate that forebrain organoids
exhibit multi-layer progenitor zone organization that recapitu-
lates human cortical development, including a prominent oSVZ
layer with oRGC-exclusive expression of defined molecular
markers. Our system provides a platform to investigate the
origin, properties, and mechanisms that define and regulate
human oRGCs.

 Generation of Diverse Neuronal Subtypes of All Six
Cortical Layers
Next, we performed detailed expression analyses of markers for
different neuronal subtypes (Figure 3H). At day 28, we observed
neurons expressing deep-layer cortical neuron markers CTIP2
and TBR1, as well as neurons expressing the Cajal-Retzius
cell marker REELIN (Figure 3I). At days 56 and 70, the SVZ con-
tained neurons expressing a low amount of CTIP2, a feature of
migrating immature neurons found in this region (Lui et al.,
2011) (Figures 3J and 3K). The CP-like structure hosted a dense
population of neurons expressing CTIP2 and TBR1, as well as a
sparser population of neurons expressing upper-layer cortical
neuron marker SATB2, which were localized close to the pial
surface (Figures 3J and 3K). There was also a cell-sparse layer
visualized by REELIN and DCX expression at the pial surface,
resembling the marginal zone (MZ) that typically becomes
layer I in vivo (Figure S3D). At day 84, late-born SATB2+ neurons
formed a layer partially separated from the early-born CTIP2+
layer, suggesting specification of upper and deep cortical layers
(Figure 3L). Furthermore, neurons expressing layer II/III markers
CUX1 and BRN2 started to appear near the pial surface (Fig-
ure 3L). Quantification revealed CP and SVZ layer expansion
and VZ layer reduction from days 56 to 84 (Figure 3M), resem-
bling the developing human cortex.
Together, these results reveal the developmental time course
of marker expression for neurons of all six cortical layers in fore-
brain organoids. Quantitative analysis of different organoids and
human iPSC lines shows little variability in the relative thickness
of different layers (Figure 3M), again indicating the robustness
and reproducibility of our organoid system.
Molecular Signatures of Developing Forebrain
Organoids
To further compare forebrain organoids to in vivo human brain
development, we performed RNA-seq analyses of global tran-
scriptomes from day 26,40,54,and100organoids.We compared
organoid transcriptional profiles to datasets of 21 different human
fetal organs during the first and second trimester (Roost et al.,
2015). Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that organoids
from all four time points strongly correlated with fetal brains and
spinal cord, with less or no correlation with other fetal somatic
tissues (Figures 4A and S4A). Further comparison with transcrip-
tomes from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples across
six life stages, ranging from fetal development to aged human tis-
sue (Jaffe et al., 2015), showed the highest correlation with fetal
brain tissues, with the best correlation for day 100 organoids (Fig-
ure S4B). Collectively, these results suggest that organoid devel-
opment is reminiscent of fetal human brain development at the
molecular level.
To pinpoint developmental stages and brain subregion identi-
ties of forebrain organoids, we performed large-scale compari-
sons with transcriptome datasets of 16 different human brain
regions at 11 developmental stages (Figure S4C). These ana-
lyses revealed a temporal correlation between organoid and
fetal human brain development, particularly for prefrontal cortex
development (Figure 4B). For example, day 26–54 organoid pro-
files were closely related to several subregions of prefrontal cor-
tex at 8–9 PCW (post-conception week), whereas day 100 orga-
noids were more closely related to 17–24 PCW, or even 35 PCW
for some subregions (Figures 4B and S4C).
We also identified differentially expressed genes during orga-
noid development (Table S2). These genes also displayed similar
trends over the course of in vivo brain development (Figures 4C
and S4D). Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of many
neuronal function pathways among upregulated genes (Fig-
ure 4D) and enrichment of cell-cycle-related pathways among
downregulated genes (Figure S4E). Interestingly, differentially
expressed genes during organoid development and risk genes
for schizophrenia or autistic spectrum disorders showed signifi-
cant overlap (p < 0.001, chi-square test; Figure 4E). Therefore,
the organoid system can be used to study the functional impact
of dynamic expression of these disease risk genes in human
brain development.
Together, our systematic and comprehensive transcriptome
comparisons provide additional validation that forebrain organo-
ids resemble normal human embryonic cortical development.
Functionally Connected Cortical Neurons and
GABAergic Neuronal Subtypes
To assess physiological properties of cells in organoids, we
performed electrophysiological whole-cell recording in slices
acutely sectioned from organoids. Recorded neurons were

 capable of firing trains of TTX-sensitive action potentials (Figures
5A and S5A). Neurons showed rectifying membrane properties,
Na+ and K+ currents in response to voltage ramps (Figure S5B).
Cells with linear membrane properties were also observed, indi-
cating presence of astrocytes (Figure 5B). We observed devel-
opmental changes of intrinsic properties in recorded neurons
across different stages (Figures S5C–S5I).
To visualize morphology of individual neurons, we electro-
porated organoids to sparsely label cells with GFP. At day
85, GFP+ neurons exhibited complex neuronal morphology
with spine-like structures in close association with presynaptic
SV2+ puncta (Figure 5C). About 50% of cells recorded showed
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) that was
sensitive to the glutamate receptor antagonist DNQX (Figure 5D).
Both intrinsic properties and synaptic connectivity were similar
between two iPSC clones (Figures S5J and S5K).
One hallmark of neuronal maturation is the switch from
a depolarizing response to GABA to hyperpolarizing due to

 developmentally regulated changes in intracellular Cl� concen-
tration, mediated by NKCC1 downregulation and KCC2 upregu-
lation (Ben-Ari and Spitzer, 2004). We found that NKCC1 was
expressed at both days 56 and 84, whereas KCC2 was strongly
expressed in the CP at day 84 but minimally at day 56 (Fig-
ure S5L). We further performed a functional assay to monitor
Ca2+ rise in response to GABA-induced depolarization (Fig-
ure 5E). Quantification showed an increase over time in the
percentage of neurons without GABA-induced Ca2+ rise among
all neurons that responded to glutamate (Figure 5F). There-
fore, forebrain organoids exhibit functional features of neuronal
maturation found in vivo.
We also found GABA+VGLUT1- neurons in forebrain organoids
after day 84 (Figure 5G). Electrophysiological recordings in the
presence of DNQX to block all glutamatergic synaptic trans-
mission also showed spontaneous postsynaptic currents with
slower kinetics (Figure 5H). Immunohistological analysis further
revealed the presence of at least three major subtypes of
GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin, nNOS, or somato-
statin (Figure 5I). Consistent with electrophysiological recording
results (Figure 5B), we observed S100b+ and GFAP+ astrocytes
in close association with surrounding neurons (Figures 5J and
5K). Together, these findings demonstrate that forebrain organo-
ids contain a diverse collection of neuronal and other cell types
found in developing human brains.
Generation of Midbrain and Hypothalamic Organoids
We next explored approaches to generate organoids with other
brain region identities. Building upon a 2D differentiation proto-
col for generating midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons (Kriks
et al., 2011), we applied Sonic hedgehog (SHH) agonists (recom-
binant SHH and Purmorphamine), FGF-8, SMAD inhibitors
(SB431542 and LDN193189), and GSK3b inhibitor (CHIR99021)
to induce floor-plate differentiation of human iPSCs, which
were transferred to SpinU at day 14 (Figure 6A). At day 18,
midbrain organoids showed organized neuroepithelium-like
structures expressing NESTIN and floor-plate precursor marker
FOXA2, but not DA neuron marker TH, whereas very few cells
expressed forebrain marker PAX6 or hypothalamus progenitor
marker RAX1 (Figures 6B and S6A). At day 38, we observed
numerous TH+ DA neurons (Figure 6C). At day 56, the majority
of TH+ neurons expressed FOXA2+ and dopamine transporter
(DAT) (Figure S6B). In addition, midbrain organoids contained
TH+ cells that expressed midbrain DA neuron markers NURR1
and PITX3 (Figure S6B). At day 75, PITX3 was robustly ex-
pressed by TH+ cells, suggesting specification of A9 DA neu-
rons (Chung et al., 2005) (Figure 6D). To quantify TH and
FOXA2 expression, we dissociated midbrain organoids at day
65. Upon culturing in monolayer for 5 days, we found that
95% ± 1% of cells were FOXA2+ and 55% ± 4% were TH+ DA
neurons (n = 6; Figure 6E).
We also explored methods to generate hypothalamic organo-
ids from human iPSCs. We first treated human iPSCs with dual
SMAD inhibitors (SB431542 and LDN193189) to pre-pattern
them to the neuroectodermal fate (Figure 6F). After 3 days,
embryoid bodies were treated with WNT3A, SHH, and Pur-
morphamine to induce the hypothalamic lineage. At day 8,
the majority of cells in organoids expressed NKX2.1, NKX2.2,
RAX1, SOX2, NESTIN, and FOXA2, markers that are consis-
tently
expressed
during
early
hypothalamus
development
(Blackshaw et al., 2010) (Figure 6G). At day 40, peptidergic
neuronal markers, including POMC, VIP, OXT, and NPY, were
detected in organoids generated from different iPSC lines (Fig-
ure 6H). At day 40, but not day 8, a subset of cell populations
expressed OTP, a homeobox protein essential for specification
of hypothalamic neuronal lineages (Wang and Lufkin, 2000) (Fig-
ures 6H and S6C). Together, these findings demonstrate the
versatility of SpinU to support growth of organoids of different
types.
Modeling ZIKV Exposure during Cortical Neurogenesis
Our organoid system provides a quantitative platform to model
humandiseases.TheWorldHealthOrganizationrecentlydeclared
ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, due in
part to the uncertainty surrounding increased reports of micro-
cephaly and other neurological disorders coinciding with clusters
of ZIKV outbreaks (Heymann et al., 2016). Recent studies of
human NPCs in 2D and neurosphere cultures showed efficient
infection by ZIKV, leading to increased cell death and attenuated
growth (Tang et al., 2016; Garcez et al., 2016). Without organiza-
tional features unique to 3D brains, such as cortical layers, these
initial studies in 2D cultures do not directly address the potential
link between ZIKV and microcephaly. It also remains unknown
whether ZIKV exhibits specific tropism for different neural cell
types in more complex 3D tissue.
We performed a series of experiments to model transient ZIKV
exposure at different stages of human cortical development by
incubating forebrain organoids with ZIKV in medium for 24 hr
in SpinU. We initially used a prototype ZIKV strain of African line-
age (MR766, termed ZIKVM hereafter) (Haddow et al., 2012).
ZIKVM readily infected SOX2+ NPCs in day 14 forebrain organo-
ids (Figures 7A and S7A). After 18 days, ZIKVM infection resulted
in overall decreased organoid size (Figures S7B and S7C). Quan-
titative analyses showed dramatically reduced VZ thickness and
size (Figures S7D and S7E), likely due to significant cell death
and suppression of NPC proliferation (Figures 7B and 7C). We
also observed a significant increase in lumen size within ventric-
ular structures (Figure S7F), reminiscent of dilated ventricles in a
recently reported clinical case of a fetal brain infected with ZIKV
(Driggers et al., 2016).
Next, we exposed day 28 organoids that contained both
progenitor and neuronal layers to two different doses of ZIKVM
(13 and 0.253; Figure S7G). Most ZIKVM-infected cells were
SOX2+ NPCs, and very few were TBR2+ IPCs or CTIP2+ immature
neurons when quantified 4 days later (Figure 7D), suggesting spe-
cific tropism of ZIKVM toward NPCs in the 3D tissue. After 14
days, we observed a significantly increased number of ZIKVM-
infected cells (Figure S7H), consistent with productive infection
by ZIKV. In addition to overall size reduction (Figure S7I), we
observed a ZIKV dose-dependent decrease of EdU+-proliferating
cells and increased CAS3+ cells (Figures 7E and S7J). Interest-
ingly, many CAS3+ cells were ZIKV�, indicating a non-cell-auton-
omous effect (Figure S7J). As a result, ZIKV infection of early
stage organoids, corresponding to the first trimester of human
fetal development, led to a significant reduction in both VZ and
neuronal layer thickness (Figure 7F), resembling microcephaly.

 We also assessed the effect of ZIKVM on day 80 forebrain or-
ganoids (Figure S7K). After 10 days, we again observed prefer-
ential localization of ZIKVM in SOX2+ NPCs in VZ and oSVZ,
but it was also detected in CTIP2+ neurons and occasionally in
GFAP+ astrocytes (Figures 7G and 7H). The infection appeared
less robust compared to that of earlier stages of organoids,
possibly due to limited ZIKV penetration to the interior of organo-
ids where NPCs reside. After 20 days, we observed an increased
number of ZIKV+ cells (Figure 7I). Quantification showed a higher
percentage of SOX2+ NPCs with ZIKVM than that for CTIP2+
neurons (Figure 7I). The presence of ZIKV+SOX2+HOPX+ cells
indicates infection of oRGCs by ZIKV (Figure 7J).
Two recent studies have shown few differences between
properties of different ZIKV strains in different models (Bayer
et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016). We explored a ZIKV strain of
Asian lineage that exhibits >99% amino acid sequence similarity
to strains currently circulating in Brazil (FSS13025, termed ZIKVC
hereafter) (Haddow et al., 2012). Quantitative analysis showed
similar enrichment of ZIKVC in SOX2+ NPCs, compared to
CTIP2+ immature neurons or TBR2+ IPCs in early stage organo-
ids (Figures S7L and S7M).
Together, our forebrain organoid system allowed quantitative
investigation of consequences of ZIKV exposure, and our re-
sults suggest that ZIKV, upon access to the fetal brain, tar-
gets NPCs and causes microcephalic-like deficits in cortical
development.
DISCUSSION
We have developed a cost-effective, simple-to-use system for
3D organoid cultures by designing a miniaturized multi-well spin-
ning bioreactor, SpinU, which can be used with standard cell-
culture plates. The low cost of the platform allowed us to
optimize protocols to generate forebrain organoids with mini-
mized heterogeneity and variability that enables quantitative an-
alyses and better recapitulation of the developing human cortex.
Specifically, these forebrain organoids exhibit a well-developed
oSVZ-like region containing NPCs that share molecular and
morphological features of human oRGCs, organized neuronal
subtypes found in all six cortical layers, and GABAergic neuronal
subtypes. We further demonstrated SpinU’s versatility by devel-
oping protocols to generate organoids recapitulating character-
istics of other brain regions. Finally, we applied our forebrain
organoid platform for chemical compound testing and modeling
ZIKV infection.
SpinU, a Miniaturized Spinning Bioreactor for Cost-
Effective Organoid Culturing
Several pioneering studies showed that cerebral organoid sys-
tems offer improved growth conditions for 3D tissue, leading
to a more representative model of the developing human brain
(Danjo et al., 2011; Kadoshima et al., 2013; Lancaster et al.,
2013; Mariani et al., 2015; Pas
xca et al., 2015). In particular, the
use of a spinning flask provides a 3D low-shear stress suspen-
sion culture with enhanced diffusion of oxygen and nutrients
that supports formation of larger, continuous cortical struc-
tures (Lancaster et al., 2013). Under our culture conditions,
direct comparison with stationary and orbital shaker cultures
confirmed the beneficial effect of spinning for forebrain organo-
ids. However, maintaining organoids in standard spinning flasks
makes it cost prohibitive to supplement the media with small
molecules and growth factors to promote growth and differenti-
ation of organoids. Our miniaturized spinning bioreactor SpinU
addresses this limitation by dramatically reducing the required
media volume, allowing for systematic and efficient testing of
culture conditions in parallel. Moreover, SpinU’s small footprint
and compact shape reduces the incubator space required, a
feature that is further highlighted by the stackable version (Fig-
ure S1A). Many of the design parameters of SpinU, including
number and size of wells, rotation speed, shaft angle, and shape,
can be customized based on specific needs. Together, the
SpinU system provides better accessibility and higher efficiency
for developing 3D tissue cultures for applications related to the
brain and other organs.
Features of Forebrain Organoids and Areas for
Improvements
Compared to several pioneering cerebral organoid systems, our
forebrain organoids show high reproducibility, which is critical
to realize its promise as a standardized model for human cortical
development. Two rounds of patterning factors effectively
induce forebrain differentiation and significantly reduce both
tissue and temporal development heterogeneity. Our proof-of-
principle study with BPA, although with concentrations likely
currents in response to a ramp protocol (�90 to 110 mV). Shown in (C) is a sample tiling image of a neuron in a day 85 forebrain organoid labeled by GFP upon
electroporation. The insert shows surface rendering of a dendritic spine structure on a GFP+ neuron with the pre-synaptic terminal labeled by SV2 staining in red.

 higher than normal human exposure, demonstrates that many
parameters in these organoids can be reliably quantified; there-
fore, this platform can be broadly used for drug testing, com-
pound screening, and disease modeling.
Forebrain organoids better recapitulate developing human
cortex along multiple dimensions, as compared to previously
reported methods. First, these forebrain organoids contain a
well-defined oSVZ-like region with a prominent oRGC-like
NPC layer, which are distinct features of developing human
cortex that are absent in rodents and previous organoid
models. Time course of SVZ and oSVZ layer formation and pro-
gression also models dynamic changes during human cortical
development. Moreover, oRGCs in forebrain organoids express
three recently identified human oRGC markers. Second, fore-
brain organoids robustly generate organized cortical neurons
expressing markers found in all six layers of human cortex,
including a layer of CUX1+ neurons destined for layer II. The
peak in production of late-born neurons expressing the up-
per-layer neuron marker SATB2 occurred after day 56, coin-
ciding with oSVZ specification and expansion. Because the
peak of oSVZ proliferation coincides in time with formation of
upper cortical layers, which are particularly cell dense in human
cortex, it has been suggested that the abundant oRGC popula-
tion in human oSVZ is responsible for this evolutionary distinc-
tion (Lui et al., 2011). Therefore, the presence of well-developed
oSVZ may be responsible for robust generation of upper-layer
neurons in forebrain organoids. Our electrophysiology and cal-
cium imaging analyses revealed functional neuronal properties,
active synaptic transmission, and recapitulation of neuronal
maturation characteristics similar to those observed in vivo.
We show the presence of GABAergic neuronal subtypes in or-
ganoids. The apparent absence of NKX2.1+ ventral progenitors
during early differentiation suggests a possible dorsal origin of
GABAergic neurons, a distinct feature of primates and humans
(Petanjek et al., 2009; Yu and Zecevic, 2011). Lastly, large-
scale comparisons of global transcriptome analyses confirm
that forebrain organoid development closely correlates with
human cortical development at the molecular level. Forebrain
organoids with a well-developed oSVZ will significantly expand
our ability to study distinct characteristics of human cortical
development that cannot be represented in rodent models.
Compared to studies of postmortem human tissues, fore-
brain organoids offer a model to investigate embryonic human
cortical development as a continuous dynamic process in live
cells and allow pharmacological and genetic manipulations to
investigate underlying mechanisms.
It is likely that continued optimization can further improve the
forebrain organoid system. First, depletion of nutrients and oxy-
gen in the interior of organoids is one factor limiting our ability to
model human brain development beyond the second trimester.
Due to dramatic CP expansion, progenitor zones in forebrain
organoids become gradually depleted after day 100. One poten-
tial solution is to engineer vascularized 3D tissue by endothelial
cell co-cultures or by implementing microfluidic perfusion net-
works. An alternative approach would be to explore culture
conditions that can accelerate forebrain organoid development
to produce features of late-stage cortical development with
smaller overall organoid size. Second, forebrain organoids do
not contain well-defined regions representing the intermediate
zone (IZ) and subplate, which play important roles in neuronal
migration during cortical development. Intriguingly, a previously
reported cortical neuroepithelial system showed formation of
a cell-sparse IZ-like region despite lacking oSVZ (Kadoshima
et al., 2013). Third, although we have identified cortical neurons
expressing markers found in all six human cortical layers, they
display only rudimentary separation. Additional chemical and
physical cues may be required to better regulate neuronal migra-
tion and positioning.
Modeling ZIKV Exposure during Different Stages of
Cortical Neurogenesis
As an application of our organoid platform for disease modeling,
we modeled the impact of ZIKV exposure at different stages of
pregnancy. Recent clinical studies have established that ZIKV
can pass through placenta to gain access to the developing fetal
brain (Calvet et al., 2016; Driggers et al., 2016; Mlakar et al.,
2016). We show that, among different cell types in 3D tissue,
ZIKV exhibits specific tropism toward NPCs, including oRGCs,
although ZIKV could be detected in immature neurons, IPCs,
and astrocytes. Time-course analysis further shows that ZIKV
infection in NPCs is productive, resulting in more infected cells
over time. Therefore, even a very low-dose and transient ZIKV
exposure in utero may have a prolonged and increasingly severe
effect over time. Consistent with clinical findings that first
trimester infections are the most dangerous (Cauchemez et al.,
2016; Faria et al., 2016), exposure of early stage forebrain orga-
noids to ZIKV for only 1 day leads to detrimental effects,
mimicking many features of microcephaly, including decreased
neuronal layer thickness and overall size as well as enlarged
lumen/ventricles. Mechanistically, we show increased cell death
and suppressed proliferation of infected NPCs. The same ZIKV
treatment of day 80 organoids, which are more complex and
resemble the second trimester, also leads to preferential infec-
tion of SOX2+ NPCs, including HOPX+ oRGCs. Together, our re-
sults provide compelling evidence that, upon access to the fetal
brain, productive and preferential infection of NPCs by ZIKV
leads to characteristic features resembling microcephaly. Fore-
brain organoids therefore provide a quantitative experimental
platform for future studies to investigate the impact of ZIKVs,
identify cellular and molecular mechanisms, and screen for
therapeutic interventions, issues that are critical to resolving
the current global health emergency related to ZIKV.

 Additional Future Applications
Brain organoids also provide a renewable source of human neu-
rons and other cell types, such as DA neurons for transplantation
in models of Parkinson’s disease. Organoid growth is coupled
with dramatic expansion in cell numbers. For example, embryoid
bodies of around 300 mm in diameter could expand to organoids
that are up to 3 mm in diameter, achieving a 1,000-fold expan-
sion in cell mass. Just as the cerebral organoid methodology
was inspired by self-organizing tissue organoids developed
for other organs, SpinU has the potential to be broadly applied
to other types of 3D tissue cultures beyond the nervous sys-
tem, where SpinU’s advantages in reduced cost, increased
throughput, enhanced cell survival, and improved factor absorp-
tion would prove beneficial. The modular stackable version of
SpinU allows for consistent culture conditions for multiple plates
simultaneously and potential large-scale 3D tissue cultures and
drug screening.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bioreactor Design and 3D Printing
We used SolidWorks for design and drawings of all components for 3D print-
ing. Modular individual bioreactors were made to fit into a stackable bioreactor
with some modifications. The blueprints for 3D printing of the 12-well version
and the stackable version of the bioreactor are provided in Data S1. Each
folder contains the CAD files for design of each component as well as a PDF
reference file to view the full assembly of the pieces.
Culture of Brain-Region-Specific Organoids, Immunohistology, and
Quantification
All studies were performed with approved protocols of Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity School of Medicine. Human iPSC lines were previously characterized (Wen
et al., 2014). See detailed protocols to generate forebrain (Figure 1B), midbrain
(Figure 7A), and hypothalamic organoids (Figure 7F) in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Whole organoids were processed for immunocytochemistry, as previously
described (Yoon et al., 2014). See the list of antibodies and their information in
Table S1. For cell-fate quantifications of day 14 organoids, neural tube struc-
tures were counted as positive for forebrain markers when >80% of all nuclei
were positive for respective markers. Markers for different brain regions were
quantified by measuring the area stained positive for markers and normalized
to DAPI in ImageJ software. VZ was defined by SOX2 immunoreactivity and
neural-tube morphology, and the outer layer was defined by the area outside
of the VZ to the nearest pial surface. The relative VZ thickness was defined as
the ratio of VZ thickness to VZ plus outer layer thickness. Layer thickness
measurements at days 56 and 84 in forebrain organoids were performed simi-
larly with the addition of SVZ. SVZ was defined by the region within mixed
populations of SOX2+ and CTIP2+ nuclei outside of VZ. CP was defined by
the region from the boundary of SVZ to the pial surface with exclusive
CTIP2+ nuclei. Some sample images shown were from tiling multiple images
of a large area as indicated.
RNA-Seq and Bioinformatics Analyses
Forebrain organoids at days 26, 40, 54, and 100 were processed for RNA-seq
and bioinformatics analyses, as previously described (Tang et al., 2016).
Sequence read counts for 22 different human fetal organs were obtained from
GSE66302. Human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex RNA-seq datasets from six
different life stages were obtained from www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v18/
n1/extref/nn.3898-S9.zip. RNA-seq gene expression for 11 time points of fetal
development and 16 different brain regions were obtained from Allen Brain
Atlas (www.brain-map.org). Schizophrenia-related risk genes were obtained
from http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/SZGR. Autism-related risk genes were
obtained from https://gene.sfari.org/autdb/HG_Home.do. R programming
language was used to perform all data analysis and generate the figures.
Electrophysiology and Calcium Imaging
Organoid slices were prepared by embedding organoids in 4% low melting
point agarose cooled to �32�C. Slices (250 mm) were sectioned and were
immediately ready for recording. Calcium imaging was performed similarly,
as previously described (Kim et al., 2012).
Modeling ZIKV Exposure
ZIKV was prepared and titered as previously described (Tang et al., 2016).
Supernatant from ZIKV-infected mosquito C6/36 cells (ZIKVM) or Vero cells
(ZIKVC) was diluted 1:10 (13) or 1:40 (0.253) and applied directly in SpinU
for 24 hr and then replaced with fresh medium. Forebrain organoids infected
at day 28 were pulsed with 10 mM EdU for 2 hr on day 42 and were fixed for
analysis 24 hr later. Quantitative analyses were conducted on randomly
picked cortical structures. Cell death was quantified by counting CAS3+
nuclei over total nuclei stained by DAPI. Area of VZ and lumen and thick-
ness of VZ and neuronal layers were measured using ImageJ software.
Overall size of organoids was measured under calibrated 43 bright field
microscope.
