AHA SCIENCE ADVISORY
Seafood Long-Chain n-3 Polyunsaturated 
Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease
A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association
Circulation
https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circ
ABSTRACT: Since the 2002 American Heart Association scientific 
statement “Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and 
Cardiovascular Disease,” evidence from observational and experimental 
studies and from randomized controlled trials continues to emerge 
to further substantiate the beneficial effects of seafood long-chain 
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. A recent 
American Heart Association science advisory addressed the specific 
effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical 
cardiovascular events. This American Heart Association science 
advisory extends that review and offers further support to include 
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from seafood consumption. Several 
potential mechanisms have been investigated, including antiarrhythmic, 
anti-inflammatory, hematologic, and endothelial, although for most, 
longer-term dietary trials of seafood are warranted to substantiate the 
benefit of seafood as a replacement for other important sources of 
macronutrients. The present science advisory reviews this evidence and 
makes a suggestion in the context of the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans and in consideration of other constituents of seafood and 
the impact on sustainability. We conclude that 1 to 2 seafood meals per 
week be included to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure, coronary 
heart disease, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death, especially 
when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
I
n 2002, the American Heart Association (AHA) pub-
lished a scientific statement on n-3 fatty acids from 
seafood (including marine and freshwater finfish and 
shellfish) and supplements in relation to cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD).1 This review included a summary of 
observational studies and randomized trials. Also sum-
marized were studies of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid 
(PUFA) intake as assessed with biomarkers in plasma, 
serum, or adipose tissue. Since 2002, more evidence 
has been published about the health benefits and 
risks of consuming seafood and supplements, the ma-
jor sources of n-3 PUFAs. In 2007, these issues were 
addressed by the National Academies of Science, En-
gineering, and Medicine in Seafood Choices: Balanc-
ing Benefits and Risks.2 In 2016, an update of 2004 
reviews3,4 on the topic was released, “Omega-3 Fatty 
Acids and Cardiovascular Disease: An Updated System-
atic Review,”5 conducted under the auspices of the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An AHA 
science advisory on the topic of n-3 PUFA supplements, 
“Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (Fish Oil) Supple-
mentation and the Prevention of Clinical Cardiovascular 
Disease: A Science Advisory From the American Heart 
Association,”6 was recently released. The purpose of 
this AHA science advisory is to summarize the health 
effects of seafood and the effects of dietary n-3 PUFAs 
from seafood on the primary and secondary prevention 
of CVD.
The long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic 
acid (20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3), are 
the LC n-3 PUFAs most closely associated with lower 
CVD risk.7 More recently, some evidence has emerged 
for cardiovascular benefits of circulating or tissue lev-
els of docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n3), another LC n-3 
PUFA present in seafood and influenced more directly 
by metabolism.8 The content of LC n-3 PUFAs is variable 
in seafood. Cold-water oily fish such as salmon, ancho-
vies, herring, mackerel (Atlantic and Pacific), tuna (blue-
fin and albacore), and sardines have the highest levels 
of LC n-3 PUFAs. In contrast, shrimp, lobster, scallops, 
tilapia, and cod have lower levels (Appendix Table A1).9 
Although a growing number of foods such as eggs, 
peanut butter, orange juice, margarine, bread, yogurt, 
and milk are being enriched with LC n-3 PUFAs, sea-
food remains the primary dietary source of these fatty 
acids and is the only class of foods for which there is a 
substantial research base that includes hard clinical end 
points. For this reason, this science advisory is limited 
to seafood.
In 2010, the AHA Goals and Metrics Committee of 
the Strategic Planning Task Force issued 2020 Impact 
Goals to improve the cardiovascular health of all Ameri-
cans by 20% while reducing deaths caused by CVDs 
and stroke by 20%.10 The dietary goals were framed in 
the context of a dietary pattern that is consistent with a 
DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)–type 
eating plan and included a specific recommendation to 
consume at least 1 to 2 fish servings (3.5 oz per serv-
ing), preferably oily fish, per week.
This dietary recommendation is consistent with the 
AHA 2006 Diet and Lifestyle Recommendation.11 In ad-
dition, the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans and the Scientific Report of the 2015 US Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee recommend at least 2 
servings per week to provide an average of 250 mg 
eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid per 
day in place of other animal sources of protein.12,13 The 
2015–2020 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans pro-
vide information about how to incorporate seafood 
into the healthy US-style eating pattern and the healthy 
Mediterranean-style eating pattern.
In 2012, the average seafood intake in the United 
States was ≈1.3 servings per week, a modest increase 
from 1.1 servings per week in 1999 but still well be-
low the current recommendations.14 In 2015, the top 
5 species of seafood consumed in the United States 
were shrimp (4.0 lb per capita per year), salmon (2.9 lb 
per capita per year), canned tuna (2.2 lb per capita per 
year), tilapia (1.4 lb per capita per year), and pollock 
(1.0 lb per capita per year).15 The LC n-3 PUFA con-
tent for commonly consumed seafood species is avail-
able in the US Department of Agriculture–Agricultural 
Research Service National Nutrient Database for Stan-
dard Reference, release 2816 (abstracted from the Di-
etary Guidelines for Americans, 20109 and summarized 
for common species in Appendix Table A1). One fatty 
fish serving per week (4 oz) such as salmon provides 
the recommended daily intake of LC n-3 PUFAs (≈250 
mg/d), whereas multiple servings of lean fish such as 
cod are required to achieve the recommended intake.
In the following sections, we summarize the available 
evidence on the effects of LC n-3 PUFAs from seafood on 
cardiovascular health. We selected those clinical mark-
ers, conditions, and hard clinical outcomes that have 
the greatest CVD health impact in the United States and 
for which LC n-3 PUFAs from seafood could provide the 
greatest opportunity for the prevention of CVD.
SEAFOOD AND PROPOSED 
INTERMEDIATE MARKERS OF CVD RISK
LC n-3 PUFAs are incorporated into the phospholip-
ids of cellular membranes and have a wide range of 
demonstrated physiological effects. Seafood-derived 
LC n-3 PUFAs have electrophysiological effects such as 
favorable changes to cardiac ion channel function, β-
adrenergic and other receptors, cell signaling pathways, 
and gap junction communication, as well as increased 
membrane fluidity.17,18 Greater consumption of seafood 
has also been associated with other electrophysiologi-
cal indexes, including lower heart rate, slower atrioven-

tricular conduction, lower likelihood of abnormal repo-
larization (prolonged QT), and optimal values of several 
heart rate variability components. These effects are as-
sociated with a lower risk of developing ventricular ar-
rhythmias19,20 and sudden cardiac death.21
Increased dietary LC n-3 PUFA intake has been shown 
to enhance arterial elasticity by increasing endothelium-
derived vasodilators,22 including nitric oxide, 3-series 
prostacyclin, and endothelium-dependent hyperpolariz-
ing factor.23 Flow-mediated dilation is a measure of bra-
chial artery after shear stress that induces nitric oxide–
dependent responses and resultant vasodilatation.24 Low 
flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery is predictive 
of endothelial dysfunction in the coronary arteries25 and 
is thought to be an early predictor of the onset of symp-
tomatic coronary heart disease (CHD).26 A recent meta-
analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials concluded that 
LC n-3 PUFA supplementation, mainly in capsule form, 
significantly improved endothelial function. Whether 
similar effects could be achieved at levels of LC n-3 PUFAs 
from dietary sources has yet to be determined,27 although 
observational studies have found concordant associations 
between dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFAs from nonfried 
seafood and biomarkers of endothelial activation and in-
flammation, specifically C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, 
and matrix metalloproteinase.28 LC n-3 PUFAs may exert 
transcriptional control of several endothelial proinflam-
matory genes, including those that code for endothe-
lium adhesion molecules and cytokines.29 Patients with 
diagnosed CHD fed diets high in LC n-3 PUFAs (salmon) 
had increased plasma LC n-3 PUFA levels and decreased 
vascular adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-6, and tumor 
necrosis factor-α markers, as well as serum triglyceride 
concentrations.30 Other novel mediators resulting from 
LC n-3 PUFA supplementation include resolvins and pro-
tectins, and they may provide additional anti-inflammato-
ry actions,31 although evidence is lacking on such effects 
of LC n-3 PUFAs from seafood intake.
Seafood has been reported to have a cardioprotec-
tive effect on platelet-monocyte aggregation, a sensi-
tive marker of platelet activation associated with the 
initiation and progression of atherothrombosis.32 A 
correlation between LC n-3 PUFA intake and lower 
atherosclerotic plaques and arterial stiffness has been 
observed in multiple cohorts, including the ARIC study 
(Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) and the Rotter-
dam Study.33–35
Dietary LC n-3 PUFAs from fish have been shown 
to reduce serum triglyceride concentrations in hypertri-
glyceridemic individuals,36 likely as a result of increased 
clearance and decreased hepatic very low-density lipo-
protein production rates.23 Fatty fish intake has been re-
ported to increase high-density lipoprotein particle size 
in subjects with coronary artery disease.37 These effects 
are consistent with findings of randomized trials of LC 
n-3 PUFAs from supplements.
BLOOD PRESSURE
The biological effects of seafood on blood pressure are 
thought to be the result of the vasodilatory effects of 
prostaglandin metabolites of LC n-3 PUFAs, primar-
ily from fish oil. To date, a large number of trials have 
demonstrated blood pressure–lowering effects of fish oil 
supplements in individuals with and without hyperten-
sion. Fewer trials have examined the blood pressure ef-
fects of seafood or other foods rich in LC n-3 PUFAs. In a 
recent meta-analysis of LC n-3 PUFAs from both supple-
ments and food, Miller and colleagues38 identified 70 tri-
als with 93 intervention contrasts, 11 of which examined 
the short-term (<2 months) effects of foods rich in fish 
oil (seafood and foods enriched with fish oil together). 
None of the 6 trials that tested the effect of seafood sig-
nificantly lowered blood pressure (Table 1),39–43 and the 
overall effect was nonsignificant. 
In sum, the available evidence is consistent with a 
beneficial role of dietary LC n-3 PUFAs on triglycerides, 
cardiac electrophysiology, endothelial function, and 
possibly blood pressure and inflammation, although 
the evidence for each of these end points is more lim-
ited for dietary as opposed to supplement sources. 
Larger well-controlled clinical trials of longer duration 
are warranted.
SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
Diets high in seafood have been more strongly associ-
ated with lower risk of fatal than nonfatal CHD events. 
For example, in the Physicians’ Health Study, there was 
no significant relationship between dietary n-3 intake 
or blood n-3 PUFA levels and nonfatal myocardial in-
farction, despite the strong inverse association with 
sudden cardiac death.44 Similar findings have been seen 
in multiple other prospective cohorts. This observation 
was attributed in part to the antiarrhythmic proper-
ties of the LC n-3 PUFAs. Higher seafood intakes have 
been associated with greater myocyte electric stability,44 
reduced vulnerability to fatal and nonfatal ventricular 
arrhythmias,45,46 lower heart rate, and improved heart 
rate variability, each of which is a risk factor for arrhyth-
mic cardiac death.
In healthy adults from other US-based population 
studies, seafood or LC n-3 PUFA intake was associated 
with lower sudden cardiac death risk.21,47–49 In general, 
there is a dose-response association between very low 
to moderate intake and lower risk of sudden cardiac 
death but not between moderate and much higher 
intake. Consuming ≈1 to 2 fatty fish meals per week 
is associated with a 50% lower risk of sudden cardiac 
death compared with little or no seafood intake after 
adjustment for potentially confounding factors.47,48 In 
most studies, no further reduction was reported with 
higher intake. Like CHD, the benefits of LC n-3 PUFA

intake on sudden cardiac death may depend on the 
choice of seafood and the preparation method. Com-
pared with <1 serving per month, consumption of ≥3 
servings per week of seafood (not breaded or fried) was 
associated with a 68% lower risk of sudden cardiac 
death.1 In contrast, fried fish was not associated with 
a lower risk of sudden cardiac death.50 The excess risk 
in this study may be the result of the consumption of 
commercially prepared seafood breaded and deep-fried 
in partially hydrogenated oils containing trans fat and 
the low content of LC n-3 PUFAs in fried fish (typically 
white fish).
In contrast to studies conducted in the United States, 
higher seafood and LC n-3 PUFA intakes have not been 
associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death 
in Japanese populations.51,52 In Japan, the background 
dietary seafood intake is 3 to 4 times higher than in the 
United States,53 and 95% of adults eat seafood >1 time 
per week.54 Hence, the lowest median quintile of LC 
n-3 PUFA intake is above the median of intake from US-
based studies. Taken together, this evidence suggests 
that for apparently healthy individuals, the association 
between LC n-3 PUFAs from seafood and risk of sudden 
cardiac death is not linear but rather has a threshold 
effect. Modest consumption of seafood (≈1–2 servings 
per week) is associated with lower rates of sudden car-
diac death compared with little or no seafood intake, 
and there is little additional benefit in risk reduction 
with a higher intake.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
Only a few prospective cohort studies have examined 
the association between seafood intake and risk of 
congestive heart failure, with heterogeneity in findings. 
Cardiovascular Health Study investigators reported a 
lower risk of heart failure with higher intakes of dietary 
LC n-3 PUFAs.55 These findings have been confirmed in 
some56,57 but not all cohort studies.58–60 The Rotterdam 
Study58 and the Cohort of Swedish Men56 found no sig-
nificant association between seafood consumption and 
the incidence of congestive heart failure. Four other 
large cohorts55,57,59 reported an association between 
frequent consumption of seafood and a lower risk of 
heart failure (Table 2). Data from the Cardiovascular 
Health Study55 and Women’s Health Initiative59 suggest 
that in contrast to baked or broiled seafood, fried sea-
food is associated with a higher risk of congestive heart 
failure. These data are consistent with the Physicians’ 
Health Study, which showed a positive graded associa-
tion between the frequency of fried food consumption 
and the risk of congestive heart failure.61 If the positive 
association with fried seafood is causal, it suggests that 
the true effect size estimated for total seafood intake 
with congestive heart failure risk might be underesti-
mated in studies that fail to account for preparation 
methods.
Few studies have used biomarkers of LC n-3 PU-
FAs to examine potential relationships with congestive 
heart failure. Although 1 study found no association,60 
2 prospective cohorts62,63 reported a significantly lower 
risk of heart failure in a comparison of the highest and 
lowest categories of serum or phospholipid eicosapen-
taenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.
There have been no randomized clinical trials of 
seafood and incident congestive heart failure, but evi-
dence summarized in a recent AHA advisory report, 
“Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (Fish Oil) Sup-
plementation and the Prevention of Clinical Cardiovas-
cular Disease,” suggests that patients with congestive 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction may benefit 
from LC n-3 PUFA supplementation to lower their risk 
of congestive heart failure–related hospitalizations and 
death.6 No data are available on LC n-3 PUFAs from

CORONARY HEART DISEASE
Individual large prospective studies and several system-

associations between seafood and dietary LC n-3 PU-
FAs and the risk of incident CHD among healthy pop-
ulations.5,64 In a systematic review restricted only to 
those studies in which participants reported seafood 
intake, participants who consumed seafood ≥4 times 
a week had a 22% lower risk of CHD compared with 
participants who consumed seafood less than once a 
month.64 Restricting results to only the highest-quality 
prospective studies did not appreciably change the risk 
estimates. The benefit for seafood consumption (com-
pared with nonconsumption) remained significant at 
levels of 1 to 4 servings per month. In a recent Agency

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
tive observational studies, mixed results were identified 
between individual LC n-3 PUFAs or total LC n-3 PU-
FAs and incident CHD.5 An overall summary estimate 
across a wide range of intake was not significant. When 
a spline knot was added to separate lower and higher 
intake, the inverse dose response was stronger but was 
not significant in the 100- to 400-mg/d range.
Systematic reviews of seafood intake and CHD risk 
have several strengths but also important limitations. 
Most important, they allow the calculation of pooled risk 
estimates with tighter overall confidence intervals across 
a broader range of intake than any 1 individual study es-
timate. In addition, recent efforts have established strict 
guidelines for undertaking these reviews; inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are predefined, and measures of qual-
ity and publication bias are required. Limitations should 
also be noted, especially for meta-analyses of a dietary 
component such as seafood.65 First, meta-analyses usu-
ally rely on published categories of intake that are not 
identical across studies. This error is exacerbated by dif-
ferences in the quality of the dietary assessment tool to 
quantify intake accurately. Furthermore, few studies use 
identical definitions of fatal and nonfatal CHD, which is 
particularly important for seafood because of the sug-
gested benefit for sudden cardiac death and possibly 
congestive heart failure versus other CVD end points. 
Meta-analyses also generally cannot capture the poten-
tial effects of food substitution in the diet.65 An indi-
vidual’s risk of CHD would be substantially lowered if he 
or she increased seafood consumption to 2 meals per 
week by substituting seafood for processed meat, but 
the estimated risk reduction may be substantially less (or 
not at all) if the 2 seafood meals per week were substi-
tuted for healthy vegetarian meals. In a recent analysis 
of 2 large US cohorts, substitution of 3% of total pro-
tein calories in processed meat with 3% of total protein 
calories from seafood was associated with 31% lower 
risk of cardiovascular mortality.66 Future individual stud-
ies and systematic reviews should consider using sub-
stitution models as a more precise method to estimate 
risks and benefits of seafood consumption in relation to 
specific alternatives.
In summary, since the 2002 AHA scientific advisory 
on seafood intake and CHD,1 a growing body of litera-
ture, mostly from prospective cohort studies, supports 
the conclusion that seafood intake or dietary intake of 
LC n-3 PUFAs is associated with a modestly lower risk 
of CHD. The benefit is likely greatest when an individual 
increases intake from 0 seafood meals per week to 1 to 
2 seafood meals a week and could be greater if seafood 
replaces the intake of unhealthy foods.
STROKE
Although initial cohort studies focused on the asso-
ciations between seafood intake and LC n-3 PUFA in-
take and total stroke,67,68 studies since the 2002 AHA 
statement on seafood intake and CVD have examined 
the associations with ischemic stroke and hemorrhag-
ic stroke separately. Results from the Nurses’ Health 
Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study indi-
cate that intake of seafood was associated with a low-
er risk of thrombotic (ischemic) stroke but not with (ei-
ther a lower or higher) risk of hemorrhagic stroke.69,70 
In the Cardiovascular Health Study, consumption of 
tuna or other broiled and baked fish was associated 
with a 40% lower risk of ischemic stroke among older 
adults; however, intake of fried fish or fish sandwiches 
was associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke.50 
Whether the type of fish (lean fish low in n-3 PUFAs) 
or the method of preparation (frying in partially hydro-
genated oils) accounted for this difference could not 
be determined. The association of seafood intake and 
stroke mortality was examined in a combined analy-
sis of 2 large cohort studies of men and women of 
Chinese ancestry. In that analysis, the risk of mortal-
ity from ischemic stroke was lower among those who 
consumed saltwater fish and had a higher intake of 
LC n-3 PUFAs.71
This was further summarized in a recent meta-analy-
sis of cohort studies that suggested that compared with 
no or infrequent consumption of seafood, consump-
tion of 1 serving of seafood a week was associated with 
a 14% lower risk of ischemic stroke with little or no 
association with hemorrhagic stroke.72 Taken together, 
evidence from prospective studies supports the incor-
poration of regular seafood consumption to lower the 
risk of ischemic stroke.
SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CVD
A number of prospective observational studies have 
evaluated how seafood LC n-3 PUFAs, assessed large-
ly with circulating biomarker levels, are associated 
with recurrent events among patients with prevalent 
CHD (Table 3).63,73–80 Clinical end points varied from 
all-cause mortality to cardiac death to major adverse 
cardiovascular events. Most of these studies were 
small, typically with <100 and often <50 events. The 
heterogeneity in the end points evaluated, covariates, 
and methods for categorizing exposure (eg, quartiles, 
tertiles, continuously) makes it difficult to directly 
compare the findings across these studies. Generally, 
all studies suggested a trend for inverse associations 
between total eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexae-
noic acid intake (diet and supplements) and risk of re-
current events, although these relationships were not 
statistically significant.
A randomized trial81,82 evaluated whether advice 
to consume fish reduces CHD in male patients with 
prevalent disease. This was an open-label, dietary ad-
vice trial in the United Kingdom. Men (n=2033) with

Seafood Long-Chain n-3 PUFAs and CVD
recent myocardial infarction (mean, ≈1.5 months) were 
randomized in factorial fashion to advice to eat 2 serv-
ings of fatty fish per week, to reduce total fat to <30% 
calories and increase the ratio of polyunsaturated to 
saturated fat to 1.0, or to increase cereal fiber to 18 
g/d.81 Approximately 20% of the subjects randomized 
to fish advice chose to take fish oil instead (1.5 g/d). 
After 2 years, compared with the control group, no sig-
nificant effects were seen in the dietary fat or cereal 
fiber groups. Patients randomized to fish advice expe-
rienced significantly lower total mortality (relative risk 
[RR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.95) 
and CHD mortality (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–0.91). A 
follow-up 15 years after the trial was completed found 
that participants who were still alive and initially ran-
domized to fish advice reported still eating more fish, 
albeit much less.
DART 2 (Diet and Reinfarction Trial 2) recruited men 
with presumed stable angina based on physician im-
pression and prescription without requiring electrocar-
diographic, stress exercise, imaging, or angiographic 
confirmation.82 This trial likely was composed of a 
mixed population, including some with clinical angina 
and others with angina-like conditions (eg, esopha-
geal spasm, heartburn, musculoskeletal discomfort). 
Patients were randomized in a factorial design to con-
sume ≥2 oily fish servings per week or 4 to 5 servings 
of fruits and nonstarchy vegetables per day, 1 serving of 
orange juice per day, and oats (servings not specified). 
There was also a control group receiving “sensible eat-
ing” advice (details not specified). About one third of 
the subjects randomized to fish advice chose to take 
fish oil instead (3 g/d). After 3 to 9 years, control sub-
jects provided sensible eating advice experienced out-
comes similar to or better than those of either interven-
tion group. In post hoc analyses, subjects who chose 
to take fish oil rather than to eat fish had a higher risk 
of cardiac death and sudden death. Several design and 
implementation limitations (Table 3) make it difficult to 
interpret the findings of this trial.
INTERACTION WITH N-6 PUFA  
AND MERCURY
Interaction With n-6 PUFA
Concerns have been raised that high n-6 PUFA intake 
may attenuate the health benefits of seafood-derived 
LC n-3 PUFAs. Several prospective studies have ad-
dressed this issue and found no significant evidence of 
an interaction between n-3 and n-6 PUFA intake. In the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study, ≥250 mg/d of n-3 
PUFA was associated with a 40% to 50% lower risk of 
sudden cardiac death in men with either low (RR, 0.52; 
95% CI, 0.34–0.79) or high (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39–
0.93) n-6 PUFA intake (P for interaction=0.13).83 In the 
Nurses’ Health Study, women in the highest tertile of 
both dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA intake had a 54% lower 
risk of sudden cardiac death compared with women 
in the lowest tertile of both PUFAs (RR,0.46; 95% CI, 
0.32–0.64; P for interaction=0.82).21
Mercury
Certain species of large predatory fish (shark, sword-
fish, tilefish [golden bass], king mackerel, bigeye tuna, 
marlin, and orange roughy)84 are a significant source 
of methylmercury, which may have neurotoxic effects 
in the fetus85 and reduce cognition in young children.86 
The existing evidence does not support significant ad-
verse effects of mercury on CVD end points. Hair and 
toenail mercury levels are the best long-term integrated 
biological markers for intake of mercury,87,88 whereas 
blood levels are more indicative of recent mercury in-
gestion. In 2 large prospective cohorts, higher con-
centrations of mercury in toenails were not associated 
with a higher risk of hypertension or CVD.89,90 In a Finn-
ish study of 1857 men and 91 sudden cardiac death 
events, a 0.5% increase in blood LC n-3 PUFAs was as-
sociated with a 23% lower risk of sudden cardiac death 
among men with low hair mercury (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.64–0.93) but no significant effect among men with 
high hair mercury (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95–1.09; P for 
interaction=0.01).91 If mercury in fish has an unfavor-
able effect on CVD risk, the available evidence suggests 
that the benefits of 1 to 2 servings a week outweigh the 
risks, especially if a variety of seafood are consumed.
TRIMETHYLAMINE N-OXIDE
Recently, concern has been raised about fish as a source 
of dietary trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) or its pre-
cursors92 with respect to potential paradoxical adverse 
effects on CVD risk. Supporting data come mostly from 
secondary prevention studies that suggest that elevated 
blood levels of TMAO increase CVD risk.93 Similar con-
cerns have been raised about other sources of TMAO 
such as dairy, eggs, and red meat. This is an area that 
should be further explored because the potential for 
diet to affect circulating TMAO is further complicated 
by differences in TMAO levels by species of fish and 
in other foods and the complex role that the composi-
tion of gut bacteria could have on metabolizing dietary 
sources of L-carnitine, choline, and betaine to produce 
TMAO.94,95

tee13) directly addressed environmental sustainability of 
dietary guidelines for greater consumption of LC n-3 
PUFAs from seafood. For some species such as salmon 
or trout, LC n-3 PUFA levels are higher in farm-raised 
species, whereas other low-trophic fish such as catfish 
or crawfish have lower LC n-3 PUFAs.12,13,16 The capture 
of wild-caught species has leveled off worldwide, but 
the productivity of worldwide aquaculture (farmed fish) 
continues to grow.96 This growth in production should 
be monitored to ensure that farming systems are sus-
tainable and environmentally appropriate and that their 
fish have LC n-3 PUFA content similar to that of wild-
caught fish. It is important to note that the AHA recom-
mendations to consume on average 250 mg/d is sus-
tainable and can be met by consuming fish 1 to 2 times 
per week, including farmed fish,13 in place of other ani-
mal protein sources.12 Increased seafood intake can be 
achieved by choosing a wide variety of seafood that 
includes oily fish harvested from diverse geographic 
 
locations.
CONCLUSIONS
A large body of evidence supports the recommenda-
tion to consume nonfried seafood, especially species 
higher in LC n-3 fatty acids, 1 to 2 times per week 
for cardiovascular benefits, including reduced risk of 
cardiac death, CHD, and ischemic stroke. Evidence is 
more limited for congestive heart failure and mixed 
for blood pressure because of limited data. A greater 
seafood intake is generally not associated with either 
further benefit or harm. In addition to the primary CVD 
benefits of LC n-3 PUFA, inclusion of seafood may re-
sult in the displacement of other less healthy foods. 
This summary is consistent with the AHA 2020 Impact 
Goals to include seafood as part of the healthy dietary 
pattern goals97 and the 2015 AHA Diet and Lifestyle 
recommendations.98 In the 2015–2020 Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans12 and the associated 2015 Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee Report,13 8 oz of sea-
food or 2 servings per week can be sustainable and en-
vironmentally friendly and is recommended as a good 
source of protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and LC n-3 
PUFAs. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans include seafood as a component of the healthy 
US diet, the DASH diet, and the Mediterranean diet. 
Others such as the Nordic diet, the Prudent diet, and 
the Alternative Healthy Eating Index also have seafood 
recommendations (or LC n-3 PUFAs), and all have been 
consistently linked to lower risk of CHD. In sum, the 
current scientific evidence strongly supports the rec-
ommendation that seafood be an integral component 
of a heart-healthy dietary pattern.
