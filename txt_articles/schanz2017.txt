This study was supported by the Robert-Bosch
Foundation (Stuttgart, Germany) and Astute
Medical (San Diego, California).
Background: In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI)
is high. Early detection of patients at risk for AKI is important. We tested urinary [TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7], a new US Food and Drug Administration–cleared test to assess AKI risk, in a
cohort of hospitalized ADHF patients.
Hypothesis: In patients with ADHF, urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] is associated with moderate
to severe AKI and related to increased mortality.
Methods: We enrolled 400 patients in the emergency department at Robert-Bosch Hospital,
Stuttgart, Germany. We examined the predictive ability of urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] (units:
[ng/mL]2/1000) for development of AKI stage 2 or 3 within 24 hours of sample collection in
patients with ADHF. Operating characteristics were determined for the validated cutoffs of 0.3
and 2.0.
Results: Forty patients had ADHF upon presentation and sufficient data for AKI staging. 27.5%
developed AKI stage 2–3 within 7 days. Urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] discriminated for AKI
stage 2–3 over the first day with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84 (95% confidence inter-
val: 0.72-0.93) and over 7 days with an AUC of 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.88). For
the first day, sensitivity was 86% at the 0.3 cutoff and specificity was 95% at the 2.0 cutoff for
prediction of AKI stage 2–3. There was a trend (P = 0.08) for higher mortality in patients with
urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] >2.0 and AKI 2–3.
Conclusions: Urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] is a promising marker for AKI risk assessment in
patients with ADHF.

INTRODUCTION
Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common reason for
hospitalization and is associated with a high risk of acute kidney
injury (AKI). The interaction of cardiac and renal dysfunction is well
known as cardiorenal syndrome, and early detection of patients at
risk for this condition is important. Acute kidney injury is a common
syndrome with increased mortality, a heavy burden of illness, and a
high cost in hospitalized patients.1–3 The degree of acute renal dys-
function in patients with ADHF is assessed using the Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria,4 which classify AKI into
3 stages based on increases in serum creatinine (sCr) and decreases
in urine output (UO).
Several biomarkers in plasma and urine have been investigated to
improve risk prediction of AKI in ADHF, but validated cutoffs have
not been established.5 Two novel urinary biomarkers of AKI, tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth
factor–binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), are cell-cycle arrest biomarkers ele-
vated by renal tubule cell stress/damage.6 The combination of these
2 biomarkers, [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7], was found to be superior to other
known biomarkers for AKI in critically ill patients.6,7 Cutoffs for
[TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] were validated,8,9 and a clinical assay for

 [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] was recently cleared by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for risk assessment of AKI.10,11 We assessed for
development of moderate to severe AKI (equivalent to stage 2 and 3)
in accordance to the FDA clearance.10 Our study is the first to report
the performance of these biomarkers in patients with AKI in ADHF.

METHODS
This study is a subgroup analysis of the subset of patients with ADHF
enrolled in our emergency department (ED) study at Robert-Bosch
Hospital in Stuttgart, Germany.12 ADHF was defined as an acute
decompensation of known heart failure or newly diagnosed ADHF.
Diagnosis was made by ED physicians and was based on clinical eval-
uation and results from diagnostic tests. Besides a physical examina-
tion,
a
medical
history,
and
samples
for
routine
laboratory
investigation, each patient received at least a serum N-terminal pro
brain natriuretic peptide measurement (95.0%) or echocardiography
(87.5%). Additionally, a chest x-ray was conducted in 90.0%, a chest
computed tomography scan in 22.5%, and cardiac magnetic reso-
nance imaging in 27.5% of the patients. Adult (age ≥18 years)
patients were enrolled during initial workup in the ED. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria have been described previously.12 Serum creatinine
values and urine output were recorded for AKI staging by KDIGO cri-
teria. Urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] was analyzed in samples collected
at enrollment, after 6 hours, on the morning after enrollment (12–27
hours), and daily thereafter. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the University of Tübingen, Germany and all subjects
provided written informed consent.
Urine samples for AKI biomarker measurements were centrifuged
and supernatants were frozen by standard methods within 0.5 hours
of collection and stored at ≤ −70�C. Samples were shipped on dry ice
and thawed immediately before measurement of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7
using the NephroCheck Test (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA) by
technicians blinded to the clinical data (at Astute Medical).
Status of AKI was classified according to the KDIGO guideline, as
described previously.12 Diuretic response (DR) was assessed as
described by Voors et al13 using the following formula:
“Δweight (kg) from baseline to day 5 / [(total intravenous dose)/
40 mg] + [(total oral dose)/80 mg)] furosemide (or equivalent loop diu-
retic dose) up to day 5”
Daily weight and daily diuretic dose were obtained from the
medical record. If the weight was not available on day 5, the weight
at discharge was used to calculate weight change.
The primary analysis cohort comprised patients with UO data
sufficient for KDIGO classification. A prehospital baseline sCr value
was obtained whenever possible from the primary-care physician. If
a baseline sCr was not available, then the lowest sCr from the hos-
pital stay was used as the reference value for staging.14 The pri-
mary endpoint was stage 2–3 AKI within 24 hours of sample
collection, rather than 12 hours as in previously reported work,6,8,9
because the study data allowed for daily resolution of biomarker
concentrations and AKI stages after the first day. A sensitivity anal-
ysis was performed on samples collected within 24 hours of
enrollment, during which time more frequently collected data were
available, using stage 2–3 AKI within 12 hours of sample collection
as the endpoint.
For statistical analysis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve were calculated to
determine the predictiveness of [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] for develop-
ment of AKI stage 2 or 3. In accordance to previous studies, each
patient could have multiple urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] values cor-
responding to the different sample collection times. Counts of sam-
ples by AKI status and [TIMP-2]×[IGFBP7] levels can be found in the
supporting documents. AKI status was determined within 24 hours of
each sample collection.12 Because there were multiple measures of
[TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] for each subject, bootstrap confidence intervals
(CIs) were reported.
To
assess the
association
of
1-year
survival
with
[TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] and AKI status, we created a categorical variable that
divided patients into 3 subgroups based on their maximum [TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] levels and AKI stage 2–3 status within 7 days. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 1-year survival. Overall
difference among subgroups was assessed with the use of a log-rank
test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs for each subgroup
were estimated with the use of a Cox proportional hazards model. The
“cox.zph” function from the R “survival” package was used to check
the proportional-hazards assumption.15 With the same methods, we
also assessed the association between AKI status and 1-year survival.
Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the
association between the change in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] and the
change in clinical variables, where the variable change was calculated as
the difference in the variable value between 2 consecutive time points.
All changes between consecutive time points (eg, time point 2 −
time point 1, time point 3 − time point 2, etc.) for each patient were
included in the analysis, such that the number of changes per patient
was equal to the number of time points −1, changes could be positive
or negative. Change in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] the day after cardiac
intervention or contrast-media administration was examined because
for both [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] values are not expected to change
until after these potential renal insults occur.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 soft-
ware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 3.0.0 (R Language
and Environment for Statistical Computing, http://www.r-project.
org).16 Two-sided P values <0.05 and 1-sided P values <0.025 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Of 400 patients enrolled, 298 had sufficient UO data for KDIGO clas-
sification, of which 40 patients had ADHF and comprised the analysis
cohort of the substudy (Figure 1). Eleven of the 40 ADHF patients
(27.5%) met the AKI stage 2–3 endpoint within 7 days.
The baseline parameters (Table 1) were not significantly different
between the patients with cardiorenal syndrome vs those without.
The majority of patients were admitted to the floor, some were
admitted to intermediate care units, and very few were admitted to

 the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with AKI stage 2–3 had a sig-
nificantly longer hospital stay than those with no or stage 1 AKI
(P = 0.005). The most common comorbidities were hypertension, dia-
betes mellitus, myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
and a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
[TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] discriminated for risk of AKI stage 2–3 with
an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.93) for samples collected within
24 hours of enrollment. At the 0.3 cutoff for [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7],
the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.57-1.00) and the specificity was
0.73 (95% CI: 0.63-0.82), NPV was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96-1.00), PPV
was 0.19 (95% CI: 0.13-0.28), negative likelihood ratio (LR−) was 0.2
(95% CI: 0-0.58), and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 3.12 (95% CI:
1.91-4.94) for prediction of AKI stage 2–3. At the 2.0 cutoff, the sen-
sitivity was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.14-0.71), the specificity was 0.95 (95%
CI: 0.89-0.99), NPV was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98), PPV was 0.38
(95% CI: 0.11-0.80), LR− was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.29-0.94), and LR+ was
7.8 (95% CI: 1.61-38.68; Table 2). The AUC was lower (0.77, 95% CI:
0.65-0.88) when samples collected over 7 days were analyzed but
still reflected good discrimination for AKI stage 2–3.
Figure 2 shows the urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] values from
samples collected on (A) the first day after enrollment and (B) within
7 days of enrollment by AKI status within 24 hours of sample collec-
tion. For sample collected on the first day, the median of [TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] values was 0.68 for the AKI stage 2–3 group and 0.21
for the no-AKI or AKI stage 1 group. For samples collected within
7 days of enrollment, the medians were 0.44 and 0.13 for the
2 groups, respectively. In both cases, [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] values
were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in patients who reached AKI
stage 2–3 than in patients who did not.
Kaplan-Meier curves showed a trend (P = 0.09) for decreased sur-
vival over 1 year in patients who reached AKI stage 2 or 3 within 7 days
compared with those who did not (Figure 2C). Further stratification of
the ADHF patients by the 2.0 cutoff for [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] revealed
that patients with both AKI stage 2–3 and [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] >2.0
had the lowest survival probability at 1 year (Figure 2D). There was also
a trend for difference in survival among the 3 groups of patients
(P = 0.08). The HR for patients with AKI stage 2–3 and [TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] >2.0 relative to patients with no AKI/stage 1 and [TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] ≤2.0 was 3.9 (95% CI: 0.9-17.3, P = 0.08).
We investigated the correlation between changes in [TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] and changes in several clinical variables relevant to
cardiorenal syndrome (Table 3). In patients who reached AKI stage
2–3 within 7 days, changes in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] were positively
correlated with changes in AKI stage (r = 0.46; P = 0.004) and
changes in weight (r = 0.53; P = 0.02). Decreases in weight or AKI
stage were accompanied by decreases in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7], and
increases in weight or AKI stage were accompanied by increases in
[TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7]. There was a trend toward a positive correlation
between change in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] and contrast administration
in patients who did not reach AKI stage 2–3 (r = 0.25; P = 0.06).
Median DR was −0.21 kg/40 mg furosemide (interquartile range
[IQR], −0.7 to 0.01) for all subjects. For subjects with no AKI or AKI
stage 1, median DR was −0.16 kg/40 mg (IQR, −0.97 to 0.03); for
those with AKI stage 2 or 3, median DR was −0.29 kg/40 mg (IQR,
−0.31 to −0.18). DR was not significantly different between patients
who developed AKI stage 2–3 and those who did not (P = 0.85 for
Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In our analysis, DR was not associated with
poor outcome, nor was DR correlated with [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7]: the
HR for DR (kg/40 mg) to predict 1-year survival was 1.9 (95% CI:
0.62-5.88, P = 0.25, Score test from Cox regression). The Spearman
correlation
coefficient
between
DR
and
maximum
[TIMP-
2] × [IGFBP7] value within 7 days was −0.11 (P = 0.48).

DISCUSSION
This is, to our knowledge, the first study of urinary TIMP-2 and
IGFBP7 to assess risk for AKI in ADHF patients and the first to utilize
FIGURE 1
Design of the study and
number of patients in cohorts. AKI stages
are the maximum KDIGO stage within
1 week from enrollment. The primary
analysis cohort consisted of 40 patients
who had ADHF and documented sCr and
UO data enabling AKI classification by the
full KDIGO criteria and a urine sample for
biomarker analysis. One of the 10 patients
with a maximum AKI stage of 2 did not
have a urine sample for biomarker analysis
collected within 24 hours of reaching AKI
stage 2. Eight patients reached AKI stage
1, 10 reached AKI stage 2, and 1 reached
AKI stage 3 within 1 week of enrollment.

 the complete KDIGO consensus criteria to characterize AKI in a
non-ICU setting. Our finding that 13.4% of hospitalized patients pre-
sented with ADHF (n = 40) and 27.5% of those developed moderate
to severe AKI highlights the importance of evaluation ADHF patients
for risk of AKI.
The incidence of AKI in our ADHF cohort is similar to that
recently reported.17 Mortality rates in patients with cardiorenal syn-
drome are high,1–3,18 suggesting that rapid assessment of ADHF
patients for AKI may be important for improving outcomes in these
patients. However, it is difficult in routine practice to achieve timely
and reliable risk assessment for AKI in patients with ADHF.
Several biomarkers other than TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 have been
studied previously in ADHF patients, but the overall performance
was low.19–22 For example, Legrand et al found no significant AUC
for a number of renal biomarkers, such as plasma neutrophil
gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL), urinary kidney injury molecule

 1 (KIM-1), urinary N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), and urinary
cystatin C.23 Recently, urinary angiotensinogen was reported to be a
stronger predictor of acute cardiorenal syndrome than either urinary
NGAL or urinary albumin/Cr ratio, with a ROC-AUC of 0.84.17 For
urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7], no significant impairment in diagnostic
performance due to comorbidities such as chronic heart failure was
described by Heung et al.24
Our study is the first to investigate the performance of the new,
FDA-cleared renal AKI biomarkers urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 in a
cohort of ADHF patients. We found an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.93)
for initial presentation (within 24 hours) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65-0.88) for
samples collected within 7 days for prediction of AKI stage 2–3.
The test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and AUC) for
[TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] are remarkably similar in our cohort of ADHF
patients in comparison to cohorts of critically ill ICU patients.8,9 We
found a high sensitivity at the lower cutoff of 0.3 and a high specific-
ity at the higher cutoff of 2.0. The high NPV of 0.99 at the 0.3 cutoff
suggests that the test especially would be clinically useful for ruling
out AKI stage 2 and 3. These observations are of special interest
because urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] is the first FDA-cleared renal
biomarker test11 and because the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative
(ADQI) consensus conference proposed inclusion of stress/damage
renal biomarkers in the AKI classification system, but emphasized that
robust cutoffs are needed.5

 Survival analysis showed a trend (P = 0.09) for decreased survival
within 1 year in ADHF patients who developed AKI stage 2–3. Inter-
estingly there was a trend (P = 0.08) for increased mortality in
patients with urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] >2.0 and AKI stage 2–3.
This trend toward higher mortality among patients with elevated
[TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] and AKI is consistent with the results reported
by Koyner et al, in which [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] was associated with
increased risk of death or need for dialysis within 9 months in
patients admitted to the ICU who developed AKI.25
Additionally, changes in [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] were significantly
correlated with weight gain in our study, suggesting an association
between [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] and fluid overload, which is known to
be associated with increased mortality.26 Therefore, biomarkers could
help to find the appropriate ward for initial management in high-risk
patients (eg, for continuous fluid balance monitoring at a monitoring
ward). Hemodynamic management based on biomarker levels is a
subject of current research.27
Poor response to loop diuretics was found to be a predictor of
poor outcome in ADHF patients; therefore, we analyzed the correla-
tion of [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] and DR, as described by Voors et al.13 In
our analysis, DR was not associated with poor outcome, nor was it
correlated with [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7]. However, these results should
not be considered conclusive because our study was not designed to
investigate DR or the outcomes analyzed by Voors et al.
We found in the group with no AKI or stage 1 AKI a trend
toward a positive correlation between contrast-media administration
and urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7]. This correlation could indicate a
tubular stress response to contrast agents as a first sign of contrast-
induced nephropathy.28,29
Comparing hospital length of stay, we found a significant differ-
ence between AKI stage 2–3 and those with no AKI or stage 1 AKI.
As expected, those with moderate to severe AKI had a longer hospi-
tal stay, as described previously.30
The similarities in performance of [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] in our
cohort of hospitalized patients and critically ill patients6,8,9 suggest
that some of the same pathophysiological mechanisms may be active.
TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are involved in cell-cycle arrest,31 a protective
mechanism believed to be initiated during the earliest stages of
tubule cell stress/injury in response to a wide variety of insults,
including inflammation, oxidative stress, drugs, and toxins. These fac-
tors, like inflammation and oxidative stress, are well known in cardior-
enal syndrome.32 In cell-cycle arrest, stressed or injured renal
epithelium may shut down function and arrest the process of cell
division until repair can take place, thus preventing more permanent
damage from cell death or senescence.

| Study limitations
The main limitation of this study is the small sample size. Therefore,
further studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm our results.

CONCLUSION
Urinary [TIMP-2] × [IGFBP7] is a promising marker for AKI risk assess-
ment in patients with ADHF and may be related with higher mortality.
