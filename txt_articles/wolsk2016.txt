Abstract
Background: Siblings have been shown to reduce the risk of childhood asthma
and allergy, but the mechanism driving this association is unknown. The objec-
tive was to study whether siblings affect the airway immune response in
healthy neonates, which could represent an underlying immune modulatory
pathway.
Methods: We measured 20 immune mediators related to the Type 1, Type 2, Type
17, or regulatory immune pathways in the airway mucosa of 571 one-month-old
asymptomatic neonates from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in
Childhood2010 birth cohort (COPSAC2010). The association between airway medi-
ator levels and presence of siblings was investigated using conventional statistics
and principle component analysis (PCA).
Results: Neonates with siblings had an upregulated level of airway immune medi-
ators, with predominance of Type 1- and Type 17-related mediators. This was
supported by the PCA showing a highly significant difference between children
with vs without siblings: P < 10�10, which persisted after adjustment for potential
confounders including pathogenic airway bacteria and viruses: P < 0.0001. The
immune priming effect was inversely associated with time since last childbirth:
P = 0.0015.
Conclusions: Siblings mediate a Type 1/Type 17-related immune-stimulatory effect
in the airways of asymptomatic neonates, also after adjustment for pathogenic
bacteria and viruses, indicating that siblings exert a transferable early immune
modulatory effect. These findings may represent an in utero immune priming
effect of the fetal immune system caused by previous pregnancies as the effect
was attenuated with time since last childbirth, or it could relate to the presence of
unidentified microbes, but further studies are needed to confirm our findings.
The immune system matures in infancy and early childhood.
During this period, the composition of the exposome is
important for the trajectory toward health or disease, such as
asthma and allergic sensitization (1). The presence of siblings
in the household has in previous studies been shown to alter
the disease risk, although the mechanism is unclear (2–4).
The term ‘sibling effect’ was first proposed from the British
Birth Survey showing that exposure to siblings protected
against eczema and hay fever at age 5 (5, 6); furthermore,
‘the hygiene hypothesis’ originally stated that a large house-
hold size protected against development of hay fever (2, 7).
A possible mechanism is that older siblings convey immune
modulation through an increased risk of virus and bacterial
exposure in very early childhood. In this regard, we have
previously shown that the airway immune response is upreg-
ulated in asymptomatic neonates with pathogenic airway bac-
teria and picornaviruses (8, 9). Alternatively or additively,

 the sibling effect may be caused by in utero immune priming
related to events induced by previous pregnancies. This could
be mediated through a decrease in cord blood IgE with
increasing birth order (5) or by decreased anti-inflammatory
T-cell activation in first borns (10).
We hypothesized that siblings were associated with a
skewing of the neonatal immune response in the airways,
as
early
as
1 month
of
age.
Therefore,
we

key immune mediators in vivo in the nasal mucosal lining
fluid in one-month-old neonates from the unselected Copen-
hagen
Prospective
Studies

(COPSAC2010) birth cohort (8, 11) in relation to presence of
siblings while adjusting for coexisting airway viruses and bac-
teria. A possible in utero immune priming effect of siblings
was investigated by studying the association between media-
tor levels and time since last childbirth, for multiparous
women.
Methods
The COPSAC2010 birth cohort
COPSAC2010
is
an
ongoing
population-based
clinical
prospective mother–child cohort with 700 children enrolled
at 1 week of age during 2009-2010, which has previously
been described in details (12). Exclusion criteria for the preg-
nant women were any endocrine, kidney, or cardiovascular
disease. Children with severe congenital abnormality were
excluded. All clinical assessments were performed according
to written standard operating procedures including sampling
of airway mucosal lining fluid (12). Information on exposures
such as siblings was obtained by structured parental inter-
views conducted at the research clinic.
Ethics
The study was conducted in accordance with the guiding
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by
the Ethics Committee for Copenhagen (H-B-2008-093) and
the Danish Data Protection Agency (j.nr. 2015-41-3696).
Prior to enrollment of the child, both parents gave their oral
and written informed consent.
Measurements of airway cytokines and chemokines
Unstimulated airway mucosal lining fluid was sampled when
the neonates visited the COPSAC clinic at 1 month of age as
previously described (8, 11). Strips of filter paper (Accuwik
Ultra,
fibrous
hydroxylated
polyester
sheets,
cat
no.
SPR0730, Pall Life Sciences, Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK)
were inserted bilaterally into the anterior part of the inferior
turbinate of the nasal cavity. After 2 min of absorption, the
filter papers were removed and immediately frozen at �80°C.
The filter papers were thawed and immersed in 300 ll of
assay buffer and subsequently placed in the cup of a tube
filter within an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 5 min in
a cooled centrifuge at 16 000 g.
The mucosal lining fluid samples were analyzed for IL(in-
terleukin)-12p70,
CXCL10
(IP-10),
interferon-gamma
(IFN-c), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), CCL4 (MIP-
1b), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL13 (MCP-4), IL-4, IL-5, IL-13,
CCL11 (eotaxin-1), CCL26 (eotaxin-3), CCL17 (TARC),
CCL22 (MDC), IL-17, IL-1b, CXCL8 (IL-8), transforming
growth factor beta-1 (TGF-b1), IL-10, and IL-2(11, 13) by
MesoScale Discovery multiplexed array system (MesoScale
Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) which is a high-sensitiv-
ity electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA-type assay. The
sensitivities for all cytokines were ≤1 pg/ml and for chemoki-
nes 1–50 pg/ml, as previously described (11).
Selection of the measured cytokines and chemokines was
decided a priori to represent mediators associated with differ-
ent types of immune responses that we grouped into Type 1
(Th1/CD8+/NK cells/innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 1), Type 2
(Th2,
eosinophils,
ILC2),
Type
17
(Th17,
neutrophils,
ILC17), and regulatory type (Treg) responses (11, 14, 15).
This was based on the present understanding of which cell
types mainly produce the given mediators and/or are affected
by the mediators.
Siblings
Information about the presence of siblings in the household
was obtained at the visit to the COPSAC clinic at 1 week of
age. Siblings included biological siblings as well as half-sib-
lings living in the home. Data were analyzed as (i) any sib-
lings (biological and half-siblings), (ii) any biological siblings
(excluding half-siblings), (iii) quantitatively as 0 vs 1 vs >1
sibling, and for multiparous women (iv) time since last child-
birth.

 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (9, 16). Hypopharyn-
geal aspirates for bacterial culturing were collected with a
soft-suction
catheter
passed
through
the
nose
into
the
hypopharynx. The aspirates were analyzed by bacterial cul-
turing, using standard methods (8, 17). The analyses were
adjusted for any presence of pathogenic airway bacteria
including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumonia
and Moraxella catarrhalis, as previously described (8, 9,
17).
Statistics
Differences in baseline characteristics between neonates with
and without siblings were analyzed with chi-squared test or
Fisher’s exact test.
To obtain normally distributed residuals of the mediator
levels, data were log-transformed prior to analyses. For every
immune mediator, a number of reads were below the detec-
tion limit. The samples with a level between zero and detec-
tion limit have not been changed, while the zero values have
been set to half of the minimum of the nonzero values, in
order to be able to perform a log transformation, without
loss of data.
The univariate associations between presence of siblings in
the home and the mediator levels were analyzed using analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) with log-transformed mediator levels
as outcome variables and siblings and possible confounders/
covariates as explanatory variables. Results are reported as
geometric mean ratios (GMR) of the mean mediator levels
for neonates with/without siblings and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI). Comparison with ‘time since last childbirth’ is con-
ducted
by
ANOVA
with
age
as
continuous
explanatory
variable. We explored other representations of this variable,
such as log transformation and polynomial as well as non-
parametric modeling with no differences in the results.
Based on our previous studies, sampling site, season of
sampling, batch of immune mediator analysis, maternal
asthma, allergy or eczema, and maternal consumption of
antibiotics in 3rd trimester were included as covariates in the
models as they all associate with the levels of immune media-
tors (8, 9, 13).
We also applied a principal component analysis (PCA) to
decompose the immune signal from the 20 mediators into a
few
independent
components
that
capture
the
overall
immunological trends in the data.
Analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and the PCA were conducted in
MATLAB R2013a v. 8.1.0.604 (MathWorks Inc, Natick,
MA,

utilizing
the
PLStoolbox
7.8.2
(Eigenvector

model and in-house algorithms for plotting data.
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 571 neonates were included in the main study,
excluding 10 neonates that were enrolled before the method
of airway mucosal lining fluid was established, as well as 19
that did not attend the one-month visit. Furthermore, 44
neonates had an airway infection at the day of sampling, and
56 samples were excluded due to technical reasons (see study
flow chart Fig. S1).
The mean age at the time of sampling airway mucosal lining
fluid was 32 days (standard deviation (SD) = 5.4 days). A
total of 51% (N = 292) were boys, 57% (N = 324) had sib-
lings, whereof 4% (N = 13) were half-siblings, 67% (N = 216)
had one sibling, and 33% (N = 108) had >1 sibling. In Table 1,
baseline characteristics of the study group are depicted along
with a comparison of neonates with and without siblings. Neo-
nates with siblings had mothers with an increased alcohol con-
sumption in the 3rd trimester (7% vs 2%, P = 0.01), higher
household income (17% vs 9%, P = 0.01) and were more often
breastfed at age 1 month (94% vs 90%, P = 0.04). Further-
more, neonates with siblings had increased presence of patho-
genic
airway
bacteria
(40%
vs
13%,
P < 0.0001)
and
picornavirus (15% vs 4%, P < 0.0001).
Baseline characteristics of the 571 included vs the 129
excluded neonates were comparable except for a higher
house-hold income (22% vs 13%, P = 0.02) and a lower age
of gestation (8% vs 3%, P = 0.004) (Table S1).

 number of samples below the detection limit are shown in
Table 2. Neonates with siblings had a significant upregula-
tion of all mediators (all P-values <0.05), except for CCL17,
when compared to neonates with no siblings. This was most
pronounced for specific Type 1 (TNF-a, CCL4)- and Type
17 (IL-17, IL-1b)-associated mediators which were 2- to 3.5-
fold increased (Fig. 1A).
Adjusting the analysis for maternal asthma, allergy and
eczema, sampling site, season of sampling, batch of immune
mediator analyses, maternal smoking in 3rd trimester, breast-
feeding at 1 month of age, high income and alcohol con-
sumption in 3rd trimester did not significantly modify the
results (Fig. 1B). Further adjustment for presence of patho-
genic airway bacteria and picornavirus at time for mucosal
sampling resulted in a slight decrease in the levels of the
immune mediators, but still yielded an overall increased ratio
of the 20 immune mediators (Fig. 1B).
The same upregulation of immune mediators was seen
when
the
analyses
were
restricted
to
neonates
without
pathogenic airway bacteria and/or picornavirus (Fig. S2),
where all mediators are significantly elevated (all P-values
<0.05) except for CCL2 and CCL17 (P > 0.1). When only
the neonates with biological siblings were included (n = 310)
(Fig. S3),
a
significant
upregulation
was
found
in
all
immune mediators (all P-values <0.05) except for CCL17
and TGF-b1 (P > 0.07). Finally, we studied the birth order
effect
of
being
second
born
(N = 216)
vs
first
born
(Fig. S4A and S5) and correspondingly the effect of being
third born (N = 108) vs first born (Fig. S4B and S5) without
finding any additional immune-stimulatory or immune-inhi-
bitory effects.
Multivariate interrelations between siblings and the neonatal
airway immune response
The conventional statistics were supported by a principal
component analysis (PCA) showing a high intercorrelation
between the 20 different immune mediators in the first com-
ponent of the loading plot (Fig. 2A). In the first component
of the score plot (Fig. 2B), a clear distinction was found
between neonates with siblings and those without siblings,
supporting the findings from the conventional approach. By
principal component regression, the difference between the
two groups was found to be highly significant (P < 10�10).
Adjusting for maternal asthma, allergy, or eczema, sampling
clinic, season of sampling, batch of immune mediator analy-
ses, maternal smoking in 3rd trimester, breastfeeding at
1 month of age, high income, alcohol consumption in 3rd tri-
mester, pathogenic airway bacteria, and picornavirus did not
modify the results substantially (P < 2 9 10�7).
To investigate a possible in utero immune priming effect,
time since last childbirth was studied in a PCA model
(Fig. 3), showing an inverse association between time since
last childbirth for the mother and the airway immune
response in the neonate (P = 0.0015, adjusted P = 0.02).
Hence, with increasing time since last childbirth, the immune
response attenuated toward the level found in neonates with
no siblings. No effect of previous miscarriage was found on
the immune mediators (data not shown).
The effect of having no siblings vs one sibling vs more than
one sibling was likewise analyzed by PCA (Fig. S4). Testing
the first three principal components with respect to birth
order revealed no significant effect, underlining that there

Discussion
Principle findings
We found an overall upregulated airway immune response in
healthy neonates with siblings in the home at birth, indepen-
dent of the presence of virus and pathogenic airway bacteria
at time of sampling. This finding questions the common
interpretation that the sibling effect, in relation to risk of
asthma
and
allergy,
is
mediated
solely
via
spread
of
microbes. Our data suggest that the sibling effect may addi-
tionally represent in utero immune priming initiated by events
during previous pregnancies as the immune response attenu-
ated with increasing time since last childbirth. However, we
cannot exclude that the effect is caused by younger siblings
bringing home more pathogens, and further studies are
needed to confirm our findings.

 Strength and limitations
It is a strength of the study that the immune response in the
airway mucosal lining fluid was assessed undisturbed in vivo
by a validated method of collecting and measuring cytokines
and chemokines (11). The assessment of the immune response
was performed in the target organ of airway disease, which is
a major advantage compared to measurements of systemic
mediators in blood. All baseline information was obtained by
interviewing the parents and not from questionnaires.
The data were analyzed with two different statistical meth-
ods, yielding similar results, increasing the validity of our
findings. The comparable results achieved with the data-dri-
ven PCA approach also negates the risk of multiple testing in
the conventional approach.
It is a limitation that we only examined 20 cytokines and
chemokines, although these 20 immune mediators were care-
fully chosen a priori to represent major phenotypical path-
ways of the immune system. Furthermore, information about
the immune response was only obtained at a single time

Siblings and the neonatal airway immune response
 point, limiting our knowledge about the chronicity of our
findings. We only analyzed for the most pathogenic and
prevalent viruses and bacteria in childhood, implicating that
other viruses and bacteria could be or have been present and
represent a residual confounding effect. However, the investi-
gated bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens affecting
the immune response and also those predisposing to later
development of asthma (8, 9, 17, 18).
Interpretation
The neonatal exposome may be a very important determi-
nant of later asthma and allergy development. The ‘hygiene
hypothesis’ originally stated that a large household size pro-
tected against development of hay fever, supposed to be
mediated through increased exposure to infectious agents in
early childhood (2, 7). Further, the term ‘sibling effect’ was
proposed from the British Birth Survey showing that expo-
sure to siblings protected against eczema and hay fever at
age 5 (5, 6), while the results for asthma are ambiguous with
studies both supporting (3, 7, 19–21) and refuting (22) an
inverse association between sibship size and asthma.
In support of the above hypotheses, we have previously
shown that neonates with siblings had a higher prevalence of
carriage of both airway viruses and bacteria than neonates
without siblings (8, 9). Moreover, we have demonstrated that
asymptomatic
presence
of
picornavirus
in
the
neonatal
airway is a potent activator of the immune system in the air-
ways with Type 1 predominance. Independently of this we
found that colonization of the neonatal airways with specific
pathogenic airway bacteria promoted a general activation of
Type 1, Type 2, and Type 17 immune mediators (8, 9). In
this article, we found a significant and marked immune-sti-
mulatory effect from having siblings, independently of airway
pathogens.
Hence,
the
proposed
sibling
effect
may
be
mediated by other mechanisms besides carriage of airway
pathogenic microbes. This could include an in utero program-
ming effect from previous pregnancies, as we observed that
increased time since last pregnancy was associated with
decreased
airway
immune
activation
in
the
offspring.
However, we cannot, with the current data and applied labo-
ratory methodology, exclude that other pathogenic microbes
than the ones we searched for are present and possibly affect-
ing our results. A recent study performed in adults described
that the distribution of pathogens in relation to respiratory
infections, differed according to age (23), which may also
apply for children. Hence, the presence of young older
siblings could bring a higher risk to transmit those infections
to which the neonates are more vulnerable, thereby inducing
a greater immune-stimulatory effect. Such relationship could
also be an explanation for the inverse relationship between
increasing time since last pregnancy and decreasing topical
immune mediator release, as increasing age of older siblings
may decrease the risk of transmitting infections to the
neonate.
We observed that exposure to siblings in the neonatal
period was associated with an upregulated immune profile,
most pronounced for Type 1- and Type 17-related mediators.
Although this effect was unaffected by adjusting for con-
comitant presence of specific pathogenic bacteria and viruses,
the nature of the immune response
still indicates that
enhanced stimulation with environmental microbes may be
the underlying factor for this specific immune signature in
neonates with siblings. Also, though still significant, the effect

In particular, CCL4 was highly elevated, which we attri-
bute to a Type 1-associated immune function involving
responses against intracellular pathogens such as viruses and
some bacteria based on its action as a CCR5 ligand. CCR5
is expressed on monocytes, immature dendritic cells, Th1
cells, and CD4+ effector memory T cells, and CCL4 will
mediate influx of these cell types upon secretion (24).
Our finding of an exaggerated Type 1 and also Type 17
response in the neonates with siblings may have an important
role in shifting the immune response away from Type 2 dom-
inance after birth, thereby supporting the sibling effect and
protecting against later development of asthma and allergy.
However, we also found elevated levels of Type 2 associated
mediators, although not as pronounced as the Type 1 associ-
ated mediators. The univocal upregulation of all types of
immune responses in the neonatal airway suggests that the
immune-stimulatory exposome carried by the siblings convey
a direct activation of the neonatal airway immune response.
Alternatively, our findings could be interpreted in support
of the siblings effect being caused by in utero programming
of the fetal immune system due to events occurring during
previous pregnancies. Priming of the developing immune sys-
tem starts in utero (4, 5, 25), and differences in the immune
activation registered in cord blood mediators and immune
cell distribution have been shown in first-born children com-
pared
to second
or later-born
children
(5, 10).
Kragh
et al.(10) found that first-born infants displayed a reduced
anti-inflammatory profile in T cells at birth, compared to sec-
ond and later born, and Karmaus et al.(5) found that cord
blood IgE level is dependent on birth order. A correlation
between levels of specific cytokines in maternal blood and
cord blood has also been documented, indicating that a
trans-placental regulation is occurring, which may affect later
risk of disease (26). We did not find a ‘dose–response-effect’
from increasing birth order, but we observed an inverse asso-
ciation between the airway immune response and the time
since last childbirth, also when adjusting the analysis for all
confounders including pathogenic airway bacteria and picor-
navirus. This suggests that the immunological effect from sib-
lings may be induced by in utero events gradually declining
over time. The reported effect could also be mediated by
younger siblings having more infections, thereby exposing the
vulnerable neonate to more pathogens. A previous study has
shown that the attack rate and intervals between airway
infections are shorter with younger age (27). Comparing
immune signals between the first born children of mothers
with or without an earlier miscarriage revealed no significant
difference, which also support the hypothesis of pathogenic
microbes transmitted by the siblings, as changes in the
maternal immune system after a miscarriage should endure
similarly to those occurring in a normal pregnancy, unless
the miscarriage would occur extremely early in gestation. It
should, however, be noted that the study power for this
analysis was low.
From our data, an in utero effect cannot be excluded, and
future studies may need a wider approach to understand the
mechanisms in other parts of the early exposome or in
maternal influence from previous pregnancies relating siblings
and disease risk. Independently of the underlying mecha-
nisms, this study shows that presence of siblings is associated
with a clear topical airway immune-stimulatory effect with
predominance of Type 1- and Type 17-related mediators. We
speculate that this may be an important immune program-
ming event in relation to later development of asthma and
allergy.
Conclusion
The presence of siblings at birth associates with an upregula-
tion of the neonatal airway mucosal immune response, which
is not mediated solely through carriage of airway pathogens,
but seems related to in utero immune priming. These findings
indicate that having siblings may exert an early Type 1/Type
17-immune priming effect that may be important for later
development of asthma and allergy.
