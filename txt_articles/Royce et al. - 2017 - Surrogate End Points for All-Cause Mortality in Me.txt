IMPORTANCE Several surrogates for prostate cancer–specific mortality satisfying the Prentice
criteria exist, but whether these are surrogates for all-cause mortality, and how their
performance compares, is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To ascertain and compare the performance of 4 candidate surrogates
(prostate-specific antigen [PSA] failure, PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL, PSA doubling time <9 months,
and interval to PSA failure <30 months) for all-cause mortality using the proportion of
treatment-effect metric.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this randomized clinical trial, 206 men with
unfavorable-risk prostate cancer who were seen at a Harvard-affiliated academic hospital or
an associated community hospital between December 1, 1995, to April 15, 2001, were
identified, randomized to radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy followed by 6 months
of androgen deprivation therapy, and followed for a median 16.62 years. This analysis looks at
the subgroup of 157 men with minimal comorbidities or no comorbidity (median follow-up,
16.49 months).
INTERVENTIONS Patients were previously randomized to receive radiation therapy or
radiation and 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of all-cause mortality.
RESULTS Overall, a cohort of 157 men (median [interquartile range] age, 72.43 [68.75-75.53])
with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer and minimal or no comorbidities were selected for this
study. Three tested metrics met all 4 Prentice criteria for surrogacy for the surrogate
covariate in the adjusted model for all-cause mortality: PSA nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.17-2.52; P = .01), PSA doubling time less than 9
months (aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.29-3.28; P = .003), and interval to PSA failure less than 30
months (aHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.92; P = .03); while PSA failure did not. For the 3 successful
surrogates, the proportion of treatment effect values were 103.86%, 43.09%, and 41.26%,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A PSA nadir value of greater than 0.5 ng/mL following
radiation and androgen deprivation therapy appears to identify men prior to PSA failure who
are at high-risk for death. This could be used to select men for entry at the time of PSA nadir
onto randomized trials evaluating the impact on survival of salvage androgen deprivation
therapy with or without agents shown to prolong survival in men with castrate-resistant
metastatic prostate cancer.

P
rostate cancer (PC) remains the second leading cause
of male cancer death in the United States with
26 000 estimated deaths projected in 2016.1 Of the
180 000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed each year,
roughly 95% will have localized PC. Some of these men with
localized disease will eventually develop metastatic disease
and die; these account for two-thirds of all PC deaths
observed in the United States.1-3 Clearly, there is a need to
expedite improved therapy in patients diagnosed with local-
ized and unfavorable-risk PC.4
Biochemical recurrence (BCR), or an increasing
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive treatment for
localized PC indicates the potential for local recurrence
and/or metastatic PC.5,6 While BCR is often managed with
salvage androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), there are no
randomized studies to our knowledge to show that ADT in
this setting prolongs survival. Also, BCR is associated with
but does not necessarily mean a patient will experience
prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) because many
men will die from competing risks, which are prevalent in
men who are likely to develop prostate cancer.7 Therefore,
surrogate end points for PCSM that occur prior to clinical
recurrence, that are not only prognostic but also predict for
a very high risk of PCSM, can help us identify men earlier
who are candidates for entry on to randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) evaluating the standard of care with or without
novel agents shown to prolong survival in men with more
advanced or metastatic PC.3,8 Moreover, surrogate end
points could shorten the necessary follow-up time of RCTs
before a new treatment regimen could be adopted, thereby
expediting results for patient care and decreasing the
needed resources to run clinical trials.
Several candidate surrogates meeting the Prentice
criteria9 for surrogacy, a well-defined set of 4 requirements
necessary to establish a surrogate end point, for PCSM have
been identified, including PSA greater than 0.5 ng/mL
(to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1.0) 6 months after
randomization10; PSA doubling time (DT) of less than 3
months,11,12 less than 12 months,13 or less than 15 months13;
and time to biochemical failure of less than 1.5 years, less
than 2 years, or less than 2.5 years13 following radical
prostatectomy11,12 or radiation therapy (RT) with or without
6 months of ADT.10,13 However, to our knowledge, none of
these candidate surrogates have been compared for their
ability to predict all-cause mortality (ACM) using a metric
such as the proportion of the treatment effect explained
(PTE) by the surrogate11,14 within the context of a single RCT
that found a survival benefit in the investigational arm as
compared with the conventional randomized treatment
arm. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use data
from such a mature, prospective randomized clinical trial to
ascertain and compare the performance of 4 candidate sur-
rogates (PSA failure, PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL, PSA DT<9
months, and interval to PSA failure <30 months) for ACM
using the PTE metric for potential use as an entrance criteria
in future randomized trials that evaluate the current stan-
dard of care vs the standard of care with agents shown to
prolong survival in metastatic and castrate-resistant PC.
Methods
Patient Population and Treatment
Two hundred and six men with unfavorable-risk PC (PSA>10
but <40 ng/mL or Gleason score ≥7; or endorectal magnetic
resonance imaging evidence of extracapsular extension and/or
seminal vesicle invasion) were randomized to receive 70.2 Gy
(to convert to rad, multiply by 100) in 39 1.8 Gy fractions of
3-dimensional conformal RT alone or the same RT and 6
months of ADT at 3 community hospitals (St Anne’
s Hospital,
MetrowestMedicalCenter,andSuburbanOncologyCenter)and
3 academic-based centers (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Brigham and Women’
s Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center) in Massachusetts between December 1, 1995,
and April 15, 2001.15 All pathology underwent centralized re-
viewbyadedicatedgenitourinarypathologist(A.R.).Giventhat
complete data on patient comorbid conditions was available
for review at randomization, a comorbidity score was as-
signed for each patient by the principal investigator (A.V.D.)
using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 (ACE-27), a 27-
item validated comorbidity index for use in patients with
cancer.16 Of the 206 men, 157 (76%) were categorized as hav-
ing no or minimal comorbidity per ACE-27 and, given that PSA
failure has been shown to be associated with an increased risk
of ACM in men with no or minimal comorbidity,17 and there
was an association with prolonged survival in men random-
ized to RT and ADT compared with RT-alone,15 this popula-
tion defined the study cohort as shown in the CONSORT
diagram (Figure 1).
Follow-up and Determination of the Cause of Death
The day of randomization was defined as time 0 and initiated
the follow-up period. The date the patient was last observed or
the date of death through February 21, 2015, whichever came
first, concluded follow-up. No patients were lost to follow-up.
Men were seen in follow-up every 3 months for 2 years,
every 6 months for the subsequent 3 years, and every year
thereafter. Each follow-up visit included a history and physi-
cal exam with a serum PSA level obtained before the digital
rectal examination. In addition to routine follow-up assess-
ment, a bone scan and computed tomography or magnetic
Key Points
Question How do surrogate end points for death in men treated
with radiation therapy (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) for localized prostate cancer compare?
Findings In this subgroup analysis of data from a randomized
clinical trial comparing effect of RT alone vs RT plus 6 months of
ADT in all-cause mortality in men with localized prostate cancer,
a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir of greater than 0.5 ng/mL
met the Prentice criteria for death and had the highest proportion
of treatment-effect value among surrogates evaluated.
Meaning A PSA nadir value of greater than 0.5 ng/mL following
RT and ADT could be used to select men at high risk for death prior
to PSA recurrence for early entry into randomized trials evaluating
ADT with or without novel agents.

resonance imaging of the pelvis were obtained at the time
of PSA failure. When PSA levels rose to approximately
10 ng/mL, salvage ADT, generally using a luteinizing
hormone–releasing hormone agonist, was recommended.
The oncologist following the patient determined the
cause of death. For PC to be the cause of death the following
criteria had to be met: castrate–resistant metastatic PC, a
rising PSA despite multiple salvage ADT regiments, and usu-
ally chemotherapy before death. Institutional review boards
at St Anne’
s Hospital and the Dana Farber Harvard Cancer
Center approved the informed consent form that was signed
by all participants. For long-term follow-up, a waiver of
consent was obtained.
Statistical Methods
Distribution and Comparison of Clinical Characteristics
and Treatment Stratification
The Table illustrates the distribution of clinical characteris-
tics and treatment among men who did or did not achieve
1 of the 4 candidate surrogates (PSA failure, PSA nadir
>0.5 ng/mL, PSA DT<9 months, and interval to PSA failure
<30 months). The PSA DT was calculated using PSA values fol-
lowing PSA failure (nadir +2) by assuming first-order kinetics
and by using a minimum of 3 PSA measurements, each sepa-
rated by a minimum of 3 months and each with a PSA in-
crease of more than 0.2 ng/mL. The distribution of these char-
acteristics is compared for each candidate surrogate using a
Mantel-Haenszel χ2 test18 for all categorical characteristics in-
cluding the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
T category, highest Gleason score, and randomized treat-
ment arm, whereas the Wilcoxon rank-sum test19 is used for
the continuous clinical factors of age and PSA.
Evaluation and Selection of the Optimal Surrogate
To show that a candidate surrogate satisfies the Prentice
criteria9 there are 4 requirements. First, treatment with RT and
ADT must be significantly associated with a reduction in the
risk of ACM in an unadjusted Cox model.20 Second, the occur-
rence of the surrogate must be significantly less likely in men
randomized to RT and ADT as measured in an unadjusted lo-
gistic regression analysis (Table).18 Third, the candidate sur-
rogate should be significantly associated with an increased risk
of ACM in an unadjusted Cox model, and finally, once the sur-
rogate is included in the adjusted Cox model then treatment
with RT and ADT is no longer significantly associated with a
reduced risk of ACM, whereas the surrogate remains signifi-
cantly associated with an increased risk of ACM. However,
because men were not stratified by comorbidity prior to ran-
domization, we also included age and known PC prognostic
factors—specifically PSA, Gleason score, and T stage—in the
adjusted model because we only evaluated the subset of 157
men with no or minimal comorbidity, given that PSA failure
has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of ACM
only in men with no or minimal comorbidity.17 All candidate
surrogates were treated as time-dependent covariates given
that time 0 was the date of randomization. Each adjusted and
unadjusted hazard ratio is accompanied by a 95% CI and
P value. The additional covariates evaluated include PSA
and age at randomization as continuous covariates, and treat-
ment (RT and ADT vs RT), AJCC clinical T category (T2 vs T1),
and Gleason score (8-10, 7 vs ≤6).
Further assessment of each proposed surrogate end
point was performed by determining the PTE that was
explained by the proposed surrogate end point.11,14 Perfect
evidence to support the Prentice criteria corresponds to a
PTE of 100%, signifying that 100% of the treatment effect
can be explained by the proposed surrogate end point. The
optimal surrogate was defined as that with the correspond-
ing PTE value closest to 100%.
Estimates of All-Cause Mortality
Estimates of ACM (1 minus the Kaplan-Meier estimates of
OS) following randomization stratified by men who were
observed to achieve the candidate surrogate or not were cal-
culated using the extended Kaplan-Meier methodology with
time-dependent covariates21 and adjusting for age.22 These
estimates were compared using a Cox time-dependent
covariates P value.20 A 2-sided P value less than .0125
was considered statistically significant after adjusting for
the analysis evaluating 4 candidate surrogates using a
Bonferroni correction. We used Power Analysis and Sample
Size Software (PASS) 13 (NCSS Statistical Software) to calcu-
late the power to measure a statistically significant differ-
ence (P < .0125 after the Bonferroni correction) in the 8-year
actuarial survival differences observed for men who experi-
enced each of the 4 candidate surrogates or not. The calcu-
lation provided power of 98.51%, 99.99%, 97.25%, and
90.50% for the candidate surrogates of PSA failure, PSA
nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL, PSA DT less than 9 months,
and interval to PSA failure less than 30 months, respec-
tively. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for all statis-
tical analyses except the age-adjusted ACM estimates and
95% CIs with time-dependent covariates, for which R ver-
sion 3.2.3 (R Foundation) was used.

Results
As shown in the Table, men randomized to receive treat-
ment with RT vs RT and ADT were significantly more likely
(P ≤ .02) to have the candidate surrogate observed. The
median PSA was higher for PSA failure (12.20 ng/mL vs
9.95 ng/mL; P = .004), PSA nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL
(11.92 vs 11.00 ng/mL; P = .04), PSA DT less than 9 months
(16.15 ng/mL vs 10.95 ng/mL; P = .002), and interval to PSA
failure less than 30 months (16.50 ng/mL vs 10.85 ng/mL;
P = .001). The distribution of median age and other PC
prognostic factors were not noted to be significantly differ-
ent (P ≥ .25 for median age) among men who were observed
to achieve the candidate surrogate compared with those
who did not (Table).
Afteramedianfollow-upof16.49years,amongthe157men
in the study cohort, 110 died (70%). Among the 4 candidate
surrogates, only 3 (PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL, PSA DT<9 months,
and interval to PSA failure <30 months) met all 4 Prentice
criteria for surrogacy including that the candidate surrogate
remained significant in the adjusted analysis (PSA nadir
>0.5 ng/mL: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.17-
2.52; P = .01; PSA DT <9 months: aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.29-
3.28; P = .003; and interval to PSA failure <30 months: aHR,
1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.92; P = .03) while treatment was no lon-
ger significant (P ≥ .27), whereas PSA failure did not meet this
criteria (aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.93-2.32; P = .10) (eTable in the
Supplement).
For the 3 PSA metrics that met the Prentice criteria for sur-
rogacy,thePTEvalueswere103.86%forPSAnadirgreaterthan
0.5 ng/mL; 43.09% for PSA DT less than 9 months; and 41.26%
for PSA failure less than 30 months. Given that a PSA nadir of
greater than 0.5 ng/mL had the PTE value closest to 100%, it
was selected as the optimal surrogate.
Estimates of age-adjusted all-cause mortality were signifi-
cantly greater among men in whom the candidate surrogates
were observed vs not as shown in Figure 2. Specifically, for PSA
failure, PSA nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL, PSA DT less than 9
months, and interval to PSA failure less than 30 months, the
respective P values were .0083, <.001, <.001, and .0018.
Specifically, 8-year point estimates and 95% CI for all-cause
mortality for each of these respective candidate surrogates in
the setting where the surrogate was observed vs not were
32.5% (21.30%-47.52%) vs 11.83% (7.23%-19.02%); 47.44%
(36.81%-59.39%) vs 13.63% (8.53%-21.41%); 40.70% (27.44%-
57.33%) vs 14.12% (9.30%-21.15%); and 39.43% (25.52%-
57.39%) vs 15.26% (10.31%-22.28%).
Discussion
In this study, we found that a PSA nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL
after radiation with or without 6 months of combined ADT was
a surrogate for ACM using the Prentice criteria.9 When com-
pared with the other candidate surrogates evaluated includ-
ing PSA DT<9 months and interval to PSA failure less than 30
months, PSA nadir greater than 0.5 ng/mL performed better

combined ADT whose PSA nadir does not fall below 0.5 ng/mL
could be considered for entry on to clinical trials at the time
of PSA nadir investigating standard of care (conventional ADT
with an luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone agonist) with
or without novel forms of hormonal therapy (eg, enzalu-
tamide or abiraterone) or cytotoxic chemotherapy (eg,
docetaxel) that have been shown to prolong survival in men
with metastatic and castrate–resistant prostate cancer.23-25 By
enriching the study cohort with men who have achieved a sur-
rogate endpoint for ACM, one can enhance the likelihood that
the study will be able to answer the question of whether sur-
vival is prolonged when novel treatment is added to standard
of care as compared with standard of care and over a shorter
time period.
An additional point of clinical importance is that PSA fail-
ure was not a surrogate, even among men with no or minimal
comorbidity. While this requires external validation, it sug-
gests that, in men with moderate-to-severe comorbidity, PSA
failure is unlikely to translate into a surrogate for ACM and
therefore has potential implications on how such men should
be managed at the time of PSA failure. Specifically, some of
these men with moderate-to-severe comorbidity may be op-
timal candidates for surveillance.26 Therefore a more judi-
cious approach to salvage ADT should be considered in these
men.Particularlygiventheknowncardiometabolicadverseef-
fects of ADT, which can at the very least lessen quality of life
and perhaps quantity of life in such men.27
Limitations
Several points require further discussion. First, classically, to
establish surrogacy, applying the Prentice criteria requires
an adjusted model for the end point of interest (eg, ACM as
in the current study) in which you include the candidate sur-
rogate and treatment in the model using data from a ran-
domized trial, where one treatment has been shown to be
superior to the other with regards to the end point of inter-
est. However, our results are based on a single, small clinical
trial involving a subgroup of 157 men with no or minimal
comorbidity analyzed in a postrandomization fashion and
therefore requires validation. Another potential limitation is
that the doses of RT (70.2 Gy) in the RCT evaluated was low
by today’
s standard; however, if PSA nadir greater than
0.5 ng/mL is a surrogate after 70 Gy and 6 months of ADT, it
would be expected to also be a surrogate after 79.2 Gy (a
higher, more conventional dose of radiation based on phase
3 data28,29). A higher dose of radiation with a poor response
in the PSA nadir value, one would expect that would also
establish surrogacy given it was established when 70.0 Gy
and not 79.2 Gy was delivered. We would expect men
treated to a higher RT dose to achieve a lower median PSA
nadir which was observed in the randomized dose escalation
trial by the American College of Radiology evaluating RT
doses of 79.2 Gy vs 70.2 Gy.29
Conclusions
Despite these considerations, our study provides evidence to
support that, in men undergoing conventional dose RT and 6
months of ADT, a PSA nadir value of greater than 0.5 ng/mL
is a surrogate for ACM. Therefore, PSA nadir greater than
0.5 ng/mL could be considered an entrance criteria at the time
of PSA nadir for prospective RCTs evaluating salvage with
conventional ADT with or without agents found to prolong
survival in men with metastatic castrate–resistant prostate
cancer.3,23-25
