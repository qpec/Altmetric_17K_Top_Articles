ABSTRACT
Objective This systematic review examines the impact
of non-menthol flavours in tobacco products on tobacco
use perceptions and behaviours among youth, young
adults and adults.
Data sources English-language peer-reviewed
publications indexed in 4 databases were searched
through April 2016.
Study selection A search strategy was developed
related to tobacco products and flavours. Of 1688
articles identified, we excluded articles that were not
English-language, were not peer-reviewed, were
qualitative, assessed menthol-flavoured tobacco products
only and did not contain original data on outcomes that
assessed the impact of flavours in tobacco products on
perceptions and use behaviour.
Data extraction Outcome measures were identified
and tabulated. 2 researchers extracted the data
independently and used a validated quality assessment
tool to assess study quality.
Data synthesis 40 studies met the inclusion criteria.
Data showed that tobacco product packaging with
flavour descriptors tended to be rated as more appealing
and as less harmful by tobacco users and non-users.
Many tobacco product users, especially adolescents,
reported experimenting, initiating and continuing to use
flavoured products because of the taste and variety of
the flavours. Users of many flavoured tobacco products
also showed decreased likelihood of intentions to quit
compared with non-flavoured tobacco product users.
Conclusions Flavours in most tobacco products appear
to play a key role in how users and non-users, especially
youth, perceive, initiate, progress and continue using
tobacco products. Banning non-menthol flavours from
tobacco products may ultimately protect public health by
reducing tobacco use, particularly among youth.
INTRODUCTION
In
2010,
WHO
Framework
Convention
on
T
obacco Control guidelines recommended restric-
tions or bans on flavours in tobacco products and
recognised that ‘masking tobacco smoke harshness
with flavours contributes to promoting and sustain-
ing tobacco use’ and that ‘there is no justification
for permitting the use of ingredients, such as fla-
vouring agents, which help make tobacco products
attractive’.1 Jurisdictions (including cities, states/
provinces and countries) around the world have
taken legislative measures to regulate flavours in
tobacco products with different levels of restrictions
to reduce tobacco product attractiveness, especially
among youth.
The 2009
US
Family
Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)
banned cigarettes containing non-menthol flavour-
ings,2 a step that other global entities, including the
European Union (EU), Australia and France, have
also taken. Other countries, such as Canada and
Brazil, have extended, or are in the process of
extending, flavour bans to include other tobacco
products and even menthol flavour.3
The passage of the FSPTCA was influenced by
data
showing
that
candy-flavoured
and
fruit-
flavoured cigarettes may be marketed to selectively
appeal to and attract younger consumers.4–6 An
examination of tobacco industry documents outlines
perceived benefits of flavoured products to consu-
mers, including pleasing aromas and aftertaste,
increased excitement about the flavours and smoking
enjoyment and a ‘high curiosity to try factor’.4
Flavouring was determined as one of the key factors
underlying the growth in smokeless tobacco sales
from 2005 to 2011, accounting for 59.4% of the
total growth in moist snuff sales alone.7 Owing to
the reported rapid rise of novel tobacco products
and the concern over their effects on public health,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fina-
lised a rule in May 2016 to extend its authority over
all tobacco products (also known as the ‘deeming
rule’).8 FDA cited the high prevalence of flavoured
tobacco use among youth and young adults as a
reason for extending their authority over other
tobacco products.8 However, FDA has not banned
flavours in non-cigarette tobacco products in the
final deeming rule but intends to issue a proposed
product standard for prohibiting flavoured cigars,
including cigarillos and little cigars.9
Despite recent bans on flavoured cigarettes in
some countries, the marketing and sale of flavoured
cigarettes still occurs in many countries. Further,
the marketing and sale of exempted flavoured
non-cigarette
tobacco
products
is
still
broadly
allowed, and the tobacco industry continues to
introduce new flavours in non-cigarette products
into the market.10 The use of flavoured non-
cigarette
tobacco
products
remains
high.
For
example, in 2014, ∼12% of US middle and high
school students used flavoured tobacco products in
the past 30 days,11 and a 2012 study found that
19% of US young adults reported past 30-day use
of flavoured tobacco products.12 The prevalence of
flavoured tobacco product use in the last 30 days
among Canadian students in grades 9 through 12 is
also high, at 10% in 2013.13
Understanding
the
impact
of
flavouring
on
tobacco use is a research priority outlined by FDA

tobacco
researchers

worldwide.15
While
FDA
and
its
affiliated
Tobacco
Products
Scientific
Advisory Committee have investigated the effect of menthol
flavouring on public health,16 17 more limited work has investi-
gated the impact of non-menthol flavouring on youth and
adult perceptions, initiation, use and cessation of diverse
tobacco products.
A recent systematic review examined the use of and attitudes
towards non-menthol flavoured tobacco products,18 but its
scope was limited to US studies only, and only studies prior to
September
2013
were
included.18
While
this
review
did
examine the prevalence of flavoured tobacco use and the rela-
tionships between flavoured tobacco use and age, it did not crit-
ically examine the role that non-menthol flavouring plays in
tobacco use behaviours, such as initiation and cessation, and
whether the flavouring in tobacco products specifically affects
these relationships. Given the rapid pace at which the market-
place and research on flavoured tobacco products are evolving,
and the interest of the topic to domestic and international pol-
icymakers, we conducted a systematic review of articles pub-
lished
through
April
2016
to
investigate
the
role
of
non-menthol flavoured tobacco products in attitudes, percep-
tions, intentions, use and cessation of tobacco products in the
USA and globally.
METHODS
Eligibility criteria
Eligibility criteria of participants included populations of any
age, race, sex, ethnicity or country. W
e excluded the following
types of articles: those that were not English-language; were not
peer-reviewed; did not contain original data about flavoured
tobacco products; did not address the impact of flavours on
tobacco product perceptions and use behaviours; were related
to smoking marijuana and limited findings to menthol flavoured
tobacco products only. For this paper, we excluded articles that
used qualitative study designs.
Type of outcome measures and intervention
Our outcome measures included reasons for using flavoured
tobacco products; perceptions about product taste, appeal and
health risks; expectancies and beliefs; intention to try; intention
to quit; use behaviours, including experimentation, initiation,
preference and progression to regular use, dual or poly tobacco
use, and cessation.
Data sources and study selection
One author (HMB) conducted searches of PubMed, Embase,
PsycINFO and CINAHL during March 2015. A general search
strategy was developed using Boolean language to connect var-
iants of words related to tobacco products and use and flavour
for PubMed,i which was translated to match the search string
requirements for other databases. T
o supplement the database
search, two authors (CM and HMB) conducted a manual search
of the reference lists in each of the included articles. In
September 2015, authors conducted a second search using the
same search strings and databases to include articles published
and indexed after the initial search. A total of 2013 articles
resulted from searching the 4 databases during the initial search

 (March 2015) (figure 1). After authors removed duplicates,
1404 articles remained for title and abstract review. The second
search (September 2015) identified 88 additional articles for
title/abstract review after de-duplication. Owing to the rapid
pace of research on flavoured tobacco products, a third search
was conducted in April 2016. This search identified 196 articles
for title/abstract review after removing duplicates. T
wo authors
(CM and HMB) reviewed the full text of articles eligible for
full-text screening. A third author (L-LH) resolved any discrep-
ancies on inclusion decisions. In total, 122 full-text articles from
the databases were assessed for eligibility, along with an add-
itional 16 articles using the same eligibility criteria through the
manual search of references. Eighty articles were excluded
because they did not include original data (n=17), did not have
data on the specified outcomes (n=58), were only on menthol
(n=1) or were duplicates to the previous searches (n=4).
Eighteen articles with a qualitative study design were further
excluded from analysis. A total of 40 articles were included in
the final analysis. The study selection processes, including
reasons for exclusion at the full-text review phase, are illustrated
in figure 1.
Data extraction and synthesis
T
wo authors (CM and L-LH) independently extracted data
using a pilot-tested data extraction sheet, which assessed study
aim, type of flavoured tobacco product, characteristics of study
populations and study design, and main results and findings
related to the impact of flavours in tobacco products. W
e used a
validated quality assessment tool (QATSDD) to examine the
quality of quantitative studies with a diverse range of research
designs.19 Studies were scored on a 4-point scale from 0 (did
not address criteria at all) to 4 (completely addressed criteria),
with specified guidance to inform scorers based on the level of
detail provided by study authors.19 Specific scores were not used
for inclusion/exclusion or used in any analysis. Rather, the tool
was used to provide a valuable overall assessment of the general
quality of included studies from which our conclusions are
based. To ensure agreement in data extraction and quality assess-
ment, two authors (CM and L-LH) reviewed and extracted a
sample of the same five articles and resolved discrepancies
through an iterative approach of discussion. W
e created evidence
tables using pertinent information extracted from each study,
and we grouped the results by outcome measures. Owing to the
heterogeneity in outcomes across studies, a meta-analysis was
not conducted.
RESULTS
Over half of the 40 included studies were conducted in the USA
(table 1), and most studies (90%) were published between 2010
and 2016. The majority of the studies used cross-sectional data,
with one study using a longitudinal design.21 Table 1 lists
product types examined and relevant outcomes for included
studies. Descriptions of study design and main findings are pro-
vided in table 2 (more detailed results of included studies are in
the online supplementary table).
Taste, appeal, risk perceptions
Eleven studies examined taste, appeal and perceived risk for
flavoured tobacco products. Four studies with similar study
designs assessed the impact of cigarette packaging descriptors
with and without flavours among girls and young women in
Brazil,46 Canada,40 the UK42 and the USA.41 Results indicated
that removing
flavour
descriptors
from packs
significantly
reduced measures of taste40–42 46 and appeal.40 42 46 Further,
two of the studies found that packs with flavour descriptors
were more likely to be rated as lower health risk than packs
without descriptors,42 and young girls were significantly more
likely to rate packs with flavour descriptors as less harmful
than young women.46 Similarly, a smokeless tobacco packaging
study of 1000 participants in the USA found that among those
who reported a difference between packaging elements on
their product opinions, more youth and young adults perceived
the pack with flavour descriptors as having better taste and as
more appealing compared with the pack without flavour
descriptors.53 Young adults were also more likely than older
adults to report that packs without flavour descriptors would
deliver more dangerous chemicals than those with flavour
descriptors.53 A longitudinal study with large numbers of parti-
cipants from the USA, Mexico and Australia examined cigarette
brands with flavour capsules and found that, compared with
adult smokers of regular non-flavoured cigarettes, adults who
preferred brands with flavour capsules viewed their variety of
cigarettes as having better taste, as more appealing and less
harmful (except Australian smokers) than other brand var-
ieties.21 A UK study of 1205 adolescents assessed the impact of
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) flavour descriptors on percep-
tions of product harm and also found perceptions of harm dif-
fered
depending
on
the
flavours.28
Tobacco
flavoured
e-cigarettes were perceived as being more harmful, while
cherry
and
candy
floss
flavours
were
perceived
as
less
harmful.28 An online study conducted among 915 Canadians
aged 16 years and older found that flavours accounted for 36%
of consumers’ overall perceptions of reduced harm about
e-cigarettes, as equally influential as health warnings (35%),
while other product attributes such as nicotine content and
price
were
less
influential
in
perceived
reduced
harm.24
Younger
smokers
and
non-smokers
particularly
perceived
cherry-flavoured
or
coffee-flavoured
e-cigarettes
as
less
harmful, while older smokers indicated tobacco flavour as
being less harmful.24 In a UK study of 471 e-cigarette and cig-
arette non-users, aged 11–16 years, flavoured e-cigarette adver-
tisements were more appealing than non-flavoured e-cigarette

 advertisements.37 A study of 689 US adolescents cited flavours
as one of the reasons why they perceived hookah to be safer
or less addictive than cigarettes.52 However, a small US study
of 20 college smokers did not detect an appreciable difference
in harshness or irritation between flavoured and non-flavoured
cigarettes.45
Preference
T
en studies examined preference for flavoured tobacco products.
One US study of 4780 middle and high school students found
that preference for sweet e-cigarette flavours was high, with
most lifetime and current e-cigarette users reporting they pre-
ferred sweet flavours compared with menthol and tobacco fla-
vours when they smoked e-cigarettes.30 A UK study of 1205
adolescents also found that fruit, sweet and coffee flavours in e-
cigarettes were perceived as more likely to be tried by young
never smokers compared with tobacco flavour, and these fla-
vours were perceived as more likely to be used or tried by
young
never
smokers
than
adult
smokers trying
to
quit
smoking.28 Three studies among adult e-cigarette users reported
that the variety of flavour choices was rated as important by the
majority of users (85.4%) and influenced device choice;20 most
users (72%) preferred vaping non-traditional flavours such as
fruity and candy/nuts to traditional flavours (ie, menthol or
tobacco);36 and former cigarette smokers were more likely to
use fruit and sweet flavours.26 Similarly, a US study of 6678 par-
ticipants reported a clear preference among youth, young
adults, female and black cigar smokers for cigar brands that
produce flavoured varieties.47 Many current adult cigarette
smokers (33%) in 27 EU countries, particularly female smokers,
reported specific sweet, menthol or fruity flavours as important
in their cigarette brand preference.38 Preference for flavour
capsule cigarette brands has significantly risen in recent years in
Mexico and Australia, particularly among young adults (though
the majority of the flavour capsule varieties reported refer to
menthol).21 But a US study of 20 college smokers did not find a
relationship between preference and whether the brand of cigar-
ette was flavoured or non-flavoured.45 An online study of 367
US college hookah users found that participants preferred fruit-
flavoured
varieties
to
tobacco
flavour.51
Further,
flavour
accounted for almost two-thirds of the hookah use decision,
compared with price (22%) and nicotine content (13%).51
Expectancies and beliefs
Six studies examined expectancies and beliefs of flavoured
tobacco products that influence consumers’ decisions. An online
study conducted among 915 Canadians found that flavours in
e-cigarettes had a moderate influence (25%) on judgements of
product efficacy in quitting smoking compared with other
product attributes such as nicotine content (10%), price (26%)
and health warnings (39%).24 Another online US study of 765
adult smokers that estimated the value smokers placed on attri-
butes of e-cigarettes found that removing the attribute ‘coming
in flavours’ significantly reduced the price smokers were willing
to pay among e-cigarette-only users.31 Among 424 US college
students, Camel Exotics (flavoured cigarettes) produced greater
positive expectancies than did Camel Lights (non-flavoured
cigarettes), with the strongest difference among susceptible/
experimenters.39 In addition, participants rated Camel Lights
more negatively than Camel Exotics; this relationship held true
across
non-smokers,
susceptible/experimenters
and
regular
smokers. A cigarette packaging study among 253 high school
students in the USA found that flavour descriptors led to more
positive beliefs about the hedonic qualities (eg, enjoyable,

 relaxing, good tasting) of brands than the traditional descrip-
tors, although this interaction was only significant among high
sensation seekers.44 A study of 81 adult e-cigarette users in four
countries found that the most frequently cited positive feature
of e-cigarettes was their taste and variety of flavours (18% of
total open-ended comments).25 A study of 447 young adults in
India that assessed perception of hookah use, 36.8% of hookah
users indicated that hookah ‘contains pleasant flavours’, which
was significantly higher than non-users (24.6%).50
Reasons for use
Seven studies addressed reasons for using flavoured tobacco pro-
ducts. In a US study of 13 651 adolescents, product flavouring
was consistently reported as the most common reason for use
across all product types, including e-cigarettes (81.5%), hookah
(78%), cigars (73.8%), smokeless tobacco (69%) and snus
pouches (67.2%).56 An online study of 1567 adults found that a
majority of e-cigarette users (60%) and one-third of non-users
reported reasons or interest for using e-cigarettes because ‘they
come in appealing flavors’ and ‘I like experimenting with
various flavors’.23 This study also found that flavours were a
common reason for discontinued use of e-cigarettes among
former e-cigarette users because they ‘don’t like the flavor(s)’.23
In an online study of 1095 Canadians, ‘they taste good’ was a
more common reason for using e-cigarettes cited by younger
non-smokers (32.3%) and smokers (18.4%) than by older
smokers (6.5%).35 In a US study of 9301 adults, 55.5% of daily
e-cigarette users, 50.4% of infrequent e-cigarette users (1–
5 days in past 30 days) and 41.9% of intermediate e-cigarette
users (6–29 days in past 30 days) reported the availability of fla-
vours (not including menthol) as a reason to use e-cigarettes,
while cutting down on other tobacco products was the most
common reason cited for e-cigarette use among daily (91%) and
intermediate (84.6%) users.22 In an online US study of 3878
adults, 8% of e-cigarette users reported flavours as a reason for
first trying e-cigarettes compared with 53% of respondents
reporting first using e-cigarettes out of curiosity, and 30%
reporting first using them because they wanted to quit or reduce
smoking.33 In an urban sample of 133 Canadian young adults,
the primary reason reported for smoking cigarillos was because
of the flavour (56%).49 Among a convenience sample of 642
youth in Massachusetts, only 1% reported using bidis instead of
cigarettes because of the flavour, but 23% said bidis tasted
better than cigarettes.55
Intention to try/initiation
T
welve studies assessed intention to try or initiation of flavoured
tobacco products. In a US study of 13 651 adolescents, the
majority of ever users (80.8%) reported that the first product
they had used was flavoured, including hookah (88.7%),
e-cigarettes (81.0%), snus pouches (81.2%), smokeless tobacco
excluding snus (68.9%), any cigar type (65.4%) and cigarettes
(50.1%).56 The majority of past 30-day users (79.8%) also
reported that the products used were flavoured.56 One US study
of 468 adult users reported a majority (60%) of participants’
first smokeless tobacco product used was mint flavoured.54
A study in the EU found that though few ever adult cigarette
smokers (1.4%) reported specific flavours as being important
in their initial smoking, flavours were significantly associated
with initial smoking in younger smokers aged 15–24.38 Among
US adolescents and young adults, flavoured cigarette brands
led to higher trial intentions compared with non-flavoured cig-
arette brands in two different studies.39 44 In an online study
of 915 Canadians aged 16 years and older, flavour accounted
for 24% of consumers’ intentions to try e-cigarettes, showing a
moderate influence compared with other product attributes.24
Younger smokers and non-smokers were particularly interested
in trying cherry-flavoured e-cigarettes, while older smokers indi-
cated greater interest in trying tobacco flavour.24 A US study of
1157 adolescent and young adult ever e-cigarette users found
that the availability of flavours was a primary reason for experi-
mentation with the product, particularly among high school stu-
dents compared with college students.29 An online study of
1095 Canadians showed that younger non-smokers were less
likely to try a flavoured e-cigarette than younger smokers and
older smokers.35 In a UK study of 471 e-cigarette and cigarette
non-users aged 11–16 years, flavoured e-cigarette advertisements
elicited greater interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes than
non-flavoured e-cigarette advertisements, but the appeal of
using e-cigarettes was low for both sets of advertisements.37 A
US study of 228 male adolescents found that their willingness to
try e-cigarettes compared with plain varieties did not differ
based on flavour status, although virtually none of the males
(<1%) had tried e-cigarettes previously.32 An online European
study, financially underwritten by an e-cigarette users advocacy
group, reported that initiating e-cigarette use to enjoy the vari-
ability of flavours was ranked as a 3 on a 5-point scale from 1
(not important) to 5 (most important).27 A US online study,
financially supported by a company that markets e-cigarettes,
reported that non-smoking teens’ interest in trying e-cigarettes
did not vary by flavour, but adult smokers’ interest did.34
Progression to regular use
T
wo studies examined the impact of flavoured tobacco on the
progression from tobacco initiation to regular use of flavoured
products.48 54 A US study that used data from five separate
studies of adult smokeless tobacco users at various stages of
reducing or quitting tobacco found that among smokeless
tobacco users who started using mint-flavoured products, 64.4%
reported current use of flavoured products, whereas 48.7% of
those who started using non-flavoured products continued to
use non-mint-flavoured products.54 A nationally representative
sample of 29 296 high school students from the Canadian
Youth Smoking Survey reported a strong association between
flavoured tobacco use and being a current cigar, cigarillo or
little cigar smoker.48 Respondents who reported ever using fla-
voured tobacco were more likely to currently use cigars, cigaril-
los or little cigars compared with respondents who had never
used flavoured tobacco products.48 It should be noted that the
two studies used cross-sectional data to examine progression to
regular use.
Dual/poly use
Three studies assessed the role of flavours in dual or poly use of
tobacco products. One survey among 24 658 middle and high
school students in the USA assessed the association between
types of use (singular tobacco product vs multiple tobacco pro-
ducts) and found that among current cigarette smokers, the use
of flavoured products was significantly associated with dual and
poly tobacco use.58 Another study found that cigar brands offer-
ing flavoured varieties were preferred more by cigar smokers
who were also current cigarette smokers.47 A Canadian study of
17 396 young never smokers found that those who had ever
tried or tried a flavoured tobacco product in the past 30 days
had significantly higher odds of being susceptible to cigarette
smoking.59

 Quit intention and quitting behaviour
Four studies assessed flavoured tobacco use and intention to
quit. A study of 18 866 US middle and high school students
found that flavoured cigar (59.7%) and cigarette (49.3%) users
had a higher prevalence of not thinking about quitting tobacco
than non-flavoured cigar (18.4%) and cigarette (9.8%) users.57
Similarly, a study in Poland of 2254 adult users reported that
females who smoked flavoured cigarettes were less likely to
intend to quit than females who smoked non-flavoured ciga-
rettes.43 US adult e-cigarette users who reported vaping non-
tobacco and non-menthol flavours were more likely to have quit
smoking than e-cigarette users who vaped traditional flavours.36
One study of adult e-cigarette users, financially underwritten by
an e-cigarette user advocacy group, reported that the variability
of e-cigarette flavours was an important factor in reducing or
quitting smoking and a greater number of flavours regularly
used was associated with smoking abstinence among dedicated
long-term e-cigarette users.26
Risk of bias assessment
Most studies were rated highly in terms of having explicit aims
and objectives, description of research setting and fit between
stated research question and method of data collection (see
QATSDD scores in online supplementary table). However, a
majority of studies did not report an explicit theoretical frame-
work, evidence of sample size consideration and statistical
assessment of reliability and validity of measurement tools.
Several studies failed to adequately address fit between stated
research question and method of data collection (scored at 1 or
below).26 34 54 It is important to note that studies may have
received a low score simply because a certain criteria was not
described in detail in the manuscript, even though the study
authors may have considered it (eg, power calculations for sam-
ple size consideration often not reported due to word count
constraints).

DISCUSSION
This systematic review highlights and extends in important ways
what policymakers and public health practitioners strongly
suspect: flavours play a key role in influencing perceptions and
multiple tobacco use patterns about most tobacco products, par-
ticularly for adolescents. Flavours in tobacco products seem to
have a universal and rather strong appeal to youth and young
adults interested in initiating tobacco use or experimenting with
different products due to the variety and availability of fla-
vours,24 29 37 46 47 53 56 are reported as a reason for using most
tobacco products,22 23 33 49 51 55 56 and appear to play a more
important role in the use of e-cigarettes, hookah, little cigars
and cigarillos among younger people.48 49 56 The availability of
non-menthol flavoured tobacco products and their appeal to
adolescents have the potential to undermine progress gained on
reducing
tobacco
use.8

ceived as less risky or harmful, and these perceptions potentially
interact with age, with younger participants appearing more
likely to believe that flavoured products were less harmful com-
pared with non-flavoured products.21

product users and non-users showed a clear preference for

varieties
over

flavours,20 21 30 36 38 47 51 and flavours give tobacco products
higher positive expectancies and beliefs about hedonic qualities,
product features and values that may influence consumers’ deci-
sions more than non-flavoured tobacco products.24 25 31 39 44 50
Not surprisingly, given the strong impact of flavours in percep-
tions of tobacco products, flavours were associated with pro-
gression to regular use and dual and poly use of tobacco
products. Tobacco users tended to switch to flavoured pro-
ducts and maintain multiple flavoured products.47 48 54 58 59
Finally, results from this review showed that the use of fla-
voured tobacco products, such as cigarettes and cigars, may be
associated with lower quit intentions.43 57 However, two e-
cigarette studies, one funded by a user advocacy group, found
that flavours in e-cigarettes may help adult e-cigarette users in
quitting cigarette smoking.26 36
Our systematic review significantly expands on a recent sys-
tematic review by Feirman et al18 of US studies published
through 2013. Our review includes articles that critically sum-
marised data for the first time on the role of flavours in tobacco
use perceptions as well as tobacco use behaviours. W
e specific-
ally examined flavours as being related to taste, appeal, risk per-
ceptions, preference, reasons for use, intention to try, initiation,
progression to regular use, dual/ploy use, quit intention and
quitting behaviour. Our review also includes 17 non-US studies
and 26 new studies published between 2014 and 2016 alone.
While there did not appear to be any appreciable difference
between the results of US versus non-US studies, it is important
to note that most of the non-US studies were conducted in
highly developed countries with moderate to strong tobacco
regulatory frameworks, such as Canada and the UK.
The relevance of this new systematic review on public policy
in the USA and internationally is significant and immediate.
First, as the majority of countries have no ban on any flavoured
tobacco product, results from this systematic review support the
rationale for global regulations on most non-menthol flavoured
tobacco products in order to positively impact public health out-
comes related to reduced tobacco use. Second, it addresses the
FDA’s need for data on the role of certain flavoured products in
supporting reduction in or abstinence from the use of combust-
ible tobacco products, as well as data on the role of flavoured
products in youth initiation and use, as stated in the final
deeming rule. Third, this research may help inform countries,
such as Brazil, that have banned all tobacco product flavours but
face litigation from the tobacco industry. Fourth, it may
strengthen efforts of local jurisdictions that have enacted more
comprehensive bans on flavoured tobacco products, such as
New York City; such bans led to significant reductions in ever
use of flavoured tobacco products, from 20% in 2010 to 16%
in 2013.60
Finally, this review may help some countries in strengthening
their existing regulations. For instance, the 2010 Canadian Bill
C-32, the Cracking Down on Tobacco Marketing Aimed Youth
Act, prohibited the sale of all flavoured cigarettes, little cigars
and cigarillos, and blunt wraps that weighed <1.4 g, with an
exemption for menthol flavouring.61 The prevalence of fla-
voured tobacco product use among Canadian high school stu-
dents remained high even after the enactment of this legislation,
in part because the tobacco industry reformulated flavoured
cigarillos to circumvent the bill (eg, increased the product’s
weight to more than 1.4 g).61 Bill C-32 also exempted many
categories
of
tobacco
products
from
regulation
(eg,
pipe
tobacco,
smokeless
tobacco
and
cigars).61
In
2015,
two
Canadian provinces extended existing flavour bans on the sale
of flavoured tobacco products to include those with menthol

 flavours, but with exemptions for pipe tobacco and some
cigars.62 This review can be helpful for jurisdictions in formulat-
ing more comprehensive and effective bans.
Our review has several limitations. This review did not
include grey literature or non-English language articles, leading
to the possibility that some relevant results could be missed.
The inclusion of grey literature may have expanded the scope of
the results and provided additional evidence that has not yet
been published. While we assessed the risk of bias in individual
studies using a validated tool, we did not set minimum threshold
for study quality a priori, and we included several e-cigarette
industry or advocacy user funded studies.26
27
34 Caution
should exist in extrapolating results from studies that scored
lower in study quality. There also appeared to be a lack of
homogeneity in the measures used in each study. Measures of
perceptions and use behaviours varied across studies, and estab-
lished reliability and validity measures are lacking. Invalidated
measures may fail to adequately assess what needs to be mea-
sured and/or bias results.
Future research may elucidate specific mechanisms underlying
the role of flavours in tobacco use perceptions and behaviours;
many studies included in this review were not designed to assess
flavours as the major predictor variable (table 2). This resulted
in some studies lacking power to detect differences in measures
between flavoured and non-flavoured conditions (see online
supplementary table), thus causing our systematic review to
likely underestimate the findings of flavours’ impact due to non-
significant results. The majority of studies used cross-sectional
data and did not assess the impact of flavours on behavioural
outcomes, such as continued use and abstinence; longitudinal
research could examine changes over time in use patterns of
tobacco products. Future research is also needed in countries
that are not represented in this review, including those with
weak tobacco regulatory frameworks, to fill the knowledge gap
regarding the role of tobacco flavours in other populations and
cultures, as products may differ greatly across countries because
of sociocultural difference (eg, smokeless tobacco in the USA is
a different product than it is Southeast Asia). As the number of
studies examining e-cigarettes and cigarettes included in this
review far outweighed the number of studies examining other
tobacco products, research examining different products and in
different countries may help to elucidate the role that flavour
plays in each identified behavioural outcome. Finally, our review
did not examine the impact of menthol flavours on outcomes.
A previous report of the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory
Committee found sufficient evidence that menthol flavourings
in cigarettes increased experimentation and regular smoking and
decreased the likelihood of smoking cessation compared with
non-menthol cigarettes,17 findings similar to that of our review
on non-menthol flavourings. Future reviews should examine the
literature on menthol flavourings to determine if the impact of
menthol flavouring is the same as or different from other fla-
vours in diverse tobacco products, particularly given the fact
that menthol flavoured cigarette smokers account for one-third
of all cigarette smokers in the USA, and menthol flavoured cig-
arette use has increased or remained stable, despite significant
decreases in non-menthol cigarette use.63 64
CONCLUSIONS
While further exploration of the impact that flavours have on
tobacco use and perceptions are needed, existing evidence pro-
vides a rationale for banning non-menthol flavouring in most
tobacco products to maximally protect youth from being
enticed by flavours from tobacco use around the world. Further
research examining flavoured tobacco products should include
the specification of the flavours’ impact on tobacco use beha-
viours and perceptions, particularly the impact of flavoured e-
cigarettes on adults cessation patterns with combustible tobacco,
use standardised and validated measures and adopt longitudinal
research designs to measure changes, especially behavioural out-
comes, over time in relation to flavours.

What this paper adds
▸ The study highlights the key role of flavours in tobacco
products in influencing perceptions and multiple tobacco use
patterns about most tobacco products, particularly for
adolescents; thus providing a rationale for banning
non-menthol flavouring in most tobacco products.
▸ Further research on the impact of flavours, particularly given
the increasing appeal and prevalence of flavoured tobacco
products among young populations, should include the
specification of the flavours’ impact on tobacco use
behaviours and perceptions, longitudinal research designs
and reliability and validity of measures.
