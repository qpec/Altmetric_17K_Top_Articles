Background
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of death worldwide. Cardiac arrest can be subdivided into asphyxial and non
asphyxial etiologies. An asphyxia arrest is caused by lack of oxygen in the blood and occurs in drowning and choking victims and in
other circumstances. A non asphyxial arrest is usually a loss of functioning cardiac electrical activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) is a well-established treatment for cardiac arrest. Conventional CPR includes both chest compressions and ‘rescue breathing’
such as mouth-to-mouth breathing. Rescue breathing is delivered between chest compressions using a fixed ratio, such as two breaths
to 30 compressions or can be delivered asynchronously without interrupting chest compression. Studies show that applying continuous
chest compressions is critical for survival and interrupting them for rescue breathing might increase risk of death. Continuous chest
compression CPR may be performed with or without rescue breathing.
Objectives
To assess the effects of continuous chest compression CPR (with or without rescue breathing) versus conventional CPR plus rescue
breathing (interrupted chest compression with pauses for breaths) of non-asphyxial OHCA.
Search methods
We searchedthe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1 2017); MEDLINE (Ovid) (from 1985 to February
2017); Embase (1985 to February 2017); Web of Science (1985 to February 2017). We searched ongoing trials databases including
controlledtrials.com and clinicaltrials.gov. We did not impose any language or publication restrictions.
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi-randomized studies in adults and children suffering non-asphyxial OHCA due to any cause. Studies
compared the effects of continuous chest compression CPR (with or without rescue breathing) with interrupted CPR plus rescue
breathing provided by rescuers (bystanders or professional CPR providers).

 Data collection and analysis
Two authors extracted the data and summarized the effects as risk ratios (RRs), adjusted risk differences (ARDs) or mean differences
(MDs). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.
Main results
We included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one cluster-RCT (with a total of 26,742 participants analysed). We identified
one ongoing study. While predominantly adult patients, one study included children.
Untrained bystander-administered CPR
Three studies assessed CPR provided by untrained bystanders in urban areas of the USA, Sweden and the UK. Bystanders administered
CPR under telephone instruction from emergency services. There was an unclear risk of selection bias in two trials and low risk of
detection, attrition, and reporting bias in all three trials. Survival outcomes were unlikely to be affected by the unblinded design of the
studies.
We found high-quality evidence that continuous chest compression CPR without rescue breathing improved participants’ survival to
hospital discharge compared with interrupted chest compression with pauses for rescue breathing (ratio 15:2) by 2.4% (14% versus
11.6%; RR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.46; 3 studies, 3031 participants).
One trial reported survival to hospital admission, but the number of participants was too low to be certain about the effects of the
different treatment strategies on survival to admission(RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.48; 1 study, 520 participants; moderate-quality
evidence).
There were no data available for survival at one year, quality of life, return of spontaneous circulation or adverse effects.
There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of the different strategies on neurological outcomes at hospital discharge (RR
1.25, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.66; 1 study, 1286 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The proportion of participants categorized as
having good or moderate cerebral performance was 11% following treatment with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing
compared with 10% to 18% for those treated with continuous chest compression CPR without rescue breathing.
CPR administered by a trained professional
Inone trial thatassessedOHCA CPRadministeredbyemergencymedical service professionals(EMS)23,711 participantsreceivedeither
continuous chest compression CPR (100/minute) with asynchronous rescue breathing (10/minute) or interrupted chest compression
with pauses for rescue breathing (ratio 30:2). The study was at low risk of bias overall.
After OHCA, risk of survival to hospital discharge is probably slightly lower for continuous chest compression CPR with asynchronous
rescue breathing compared with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing (9.0% versus 9.7%) with an adjusted risk difference
(ARD) of -0.7%; 95% CI (-1.5% to 0.1%); moderate-quality evidence.
There is high-quality evidence that survival to hospital admission is 1.3% lower with continuous chest compression CPR with asyn-
chronous rescue breathing compared with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing (24.6% versus 25.9%; ARD -1.3%
95% CI (-2.4% to -0.2%)).
Survival at one year and quality of life were not reported.
Return of spontaneous circulation is likely to be slightly lower in people treated with continuous chest compression CPR plus asyn-
chronous rescue breathing (24.2% versus 25.3%; -1.1% (95% CI -2.4 to 0.1)), high-quality evidence.
There is high-quality evidence of little or no difference in neurological outcome at discharge between these two interventions (7.0%
versus 7.7%; ARD -0.6% (95% CI -1.4 to 0.1).
Rates of adverse events were 54.4% in those treated with continuous chest compressions plus asynchronous rescue breathing versus
55.4% in people treated with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing compared with the ARD being -1% (-2.3 to 0.4),
moderate-quality evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
Following OHCA, we have found that bystander-administered chest compression-only CPR, supported by telephone instruction,
increases the proportion of people who survive to hospital discharge compared with conventional interrupted chest compression CPR

 plus rescue breathing. Some uncertainty remains about how well neurological function is preserved in this population and there is no
information available regarding adverse effects.
When CPR was performed by EMS providers, continuous chest compressions plus asynchronous rescue breathing did not result in
higher rates for survival to hospital discharge compared to interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing. The results indicate
slightly lower rates of survival to admission or discharge, favourable neurological outcome and return of spontaneous circulation
observed following continuous chest compression. Adverse effects are probably slightly lower with continuous chest compression.
Increased availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and AED use in CPR need to be examined, and also whether
continuous chest compression CPR is appropriate for paediatric cardiac arrest.

Continuous chest compression versus interrupted chest compression for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of non-asphyxial
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
Background
A cardiac arrest is when the heart stops pumping blood around the body. It is a major cause of death worldwide. A large number of
cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals. Conventional CPR includes both chest compressions and rescue breathing such as mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation. This is known as interrupted chest compression with pauses at a fixed ratio for rescue breathing (e.g. 2 breaths:
30 compressions) .
Rescue breathing can be given by mouth-to-mouth or by ventilation devices used by ambulance services. Some studies suggest that
applying continuous chest compression is critical for an individual’s survival and that interrupting the chest compressions for rescue
breathing might increase the risk of death. Continuous chest compression CPR may be performed with, or without, rescue breathing.
The theory is that chest compression mimics the heart’s action of pumping blood around the body and maintains the supply of oxygen
and nutrients to important organs such as the brain. Trying to give mouth-to-mouth ventilation means interrupting chest compressions
which could weaken the action of pumping blood.
We compared the effects of the two treatments when they were given by bystanders at the scene of a non-asphyxial OHCA and by
ambulance crews who arrive later. (A non-asphyxial arrest does not result from drowning or choking.)
Search date
The evidence is current to February 2017.
Study characteristics
We included four studies; three compared the two approaches to resuscitation when given by untrained bystanders under instruction
by telephone. One study compared the two approaches when given by EMS personnel.
The three studies, comparing the approaches given by untrained bystanders, (3737 participants) were all undertaken in urban areas
and some included both children and adult OHCA. The, bystanders were all untrained and given telephone instructions from the
emergency services.
The fourth study compared approaches given by EMS professionals (23,711 participants); it was undertaken in urban areas and included
only adult OHCA.
Key results
When CPR was performed by bystanders, we found that more people survived until discharge from hospital after chest compression
alone than they did following interrupted chest compression with pauses at a fixed ratio for rescue breathing (15 compressions to 2
breaths) (14% versus 11.6%). For the outcomes of survival to hospital admission and neurological outcomes, we did not have sufficient
data to be certain that either strategy was better. No data was available for adverse effects, quality of life or survival at one-year.
When CPR was performed by EMS professionals, we found that survival to hospital discharge was slightly lower with continuous chest
compressions (100/minute) plus asynchronous rescue breathing (10/minutes) CPR compared with interrupted chest compression plus
rescue breathing. Around 9.7% of people lived when they received interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing compared with
9% of people who received continuous chest compression plus asynchronous rescue breathing.

 The number of people who survived to hospital admission was slightly higher in those treated with interrupted chest compression plus
rescue breathing compared with continuous chest compression plus asynchronous rescue breathing (25.9% versus 24.6%). There was
little or no difference in neurological outcomes. The proportion of people who experienced adverse events was probably similar with
55.4% people treated with interrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing experiencing an adverse event compared with 54.4%
in those treated with continuous chest compression asynchronous rescue breathing.
Quality of evidence
For bystander-provided CPR, the quality of the evidence was high for the outcome of survival to hospital discharge. For survival to
hospital admission, one trial provided results and the evidence was of moderate-quality because of low numbers of people for whom
data were available. This was also the case for neurological outcomes.
In the one EMS professional-provided CPR trial, the quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcome of survival to hospital
discharge because the results do not exclude there being little or no difference between the two approaches, and this is also the case for
adverse events. For survival to hospital admission there was high-quality evidence.
The main limitation of the current evidence is that only a few trials have been undertaken, and for some outcomes, not enough data
have been generated.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: confidence interval; CPR: cardiopulmonary resuscitation; RR: risk ratio.
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High-quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate-quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low-quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low-quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1 Not downgraded for risk of bias. Although the nature of the studies meant that study personnel, including dispatchers and
bystanders would be aware of which mode of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was administered, we do not believe
that this would have affected survival outcomes.
2 We downgraded one level of the evidence due to imprecision because the total number of events was small.

Description of the condition
Cardiac arrest is a condition in which the heart has stopped beating
or is not beating efficiently enough to provide circulation to sus-
tain life. It can be confirmed by the absence of a detectable pulse,
the patient being unresponsive, or an individual stopping breath-
ing, or breathing abnormally (apnoea, agonal or gasping respira-
tions) (Cummins 1991). Cardiac arrest is a major cause of death in
many countries around the world and an important public health
problem. In 1998 in the USA, 456,076 deaths were recorded as re-
sulting from sudden cardiac death (Zheng 2001). Approximately
350,000 people in the USA and Canada per year suffer from a
cardiac arrest in which resuscitation is attempted (Jones-Crawford
2007; Nadkarni 2006; Nichol 2008). In Europe, the incidence
of emergency medical services (EMS) for treating out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest is 38 per 100,000 persons per year (ERC 2010).
Cardiac arrest can be subdivided in asphyxial and non asphyxial
etiologies. An asphyxia arrest is caused by lack of oxygen in the
blood and occurs in drowning and choking victims and in other
circumstances. A non asphyxial arrest is usually a loss of function-
ing cardiac electrical activity.
Description of the intervention
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has long been used to treat
cardiac arrest. Conventional CPR includes both chest compres-
sions and rescue breathing such as mouth-to-mouth breathing;
this is denoted interrupted chest compression with pauses at a fixed
ratio (either 2 breaths:15 compressions or 2 breaths: 30 compres-
sions) for rescue breathing. Chest compression forces blood from
the heart to the arterial system and increases the flow of blood to
the coronary arteries, cardiac muscle and brain. In the release phase
of the compression, the venous blood flows back to the heart under
the force of the negative pressure of the thoracic cavity (Wolcke
2003). Thus, the external compressions lead to the heart ’working
again’ and so chest compressions provide partial circulatory sup-
port. The other important part of CPR is rescue breathing (artifi-
cal ventilation) . Rescue breathing can push air into the lungs and
improve the blood oxygen saturation. The main form of artificial
ventilation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation, but rescue breathing can also be provided by
any kind of airway device, such as a bag-valve mask.
CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can be performed using con-
tinuous chest compression-only, or interrupted chest compression
plus artificial ventilation (conventional CPR). The difference be-
tween continuous chest compression CPR and interrupted (con-
ventional) chest compression CPR, is that in continuous chest
compression CPR, rescuers do not interrupt compressions to per-
form artificial ventilation.
Conventional CPRemphasizesthe equal importance of chestcom-
pressionsandartificial ventilation, whereascompression-onlyCPR
considers continuous chest compression as being most critical for
cardiac arrest victims.
How the intervention might work
CPR provided by bystanders is crucial for cardiac arrest victims,
and substantially improves their chances of survival prior to the ar-
rival of EMS personnel. There has been a series of studies focusing
on CPR instructions for bystanders; the conclusion is that early
initiation of CPR by bystanders leads to better outcomes (AHA
2005; Sayre 2008). But the problem with conventional CPR is
that the majority of bystanders (including health professionals)
are reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, and there-
fore would not initiate CPR because of the perceived requirement
for mouth-to-mouth ventilation (Brenner 1993; Brenner 1994;
Locke 1995).
There are other reasons that individuals in the USA do not initi-
ate bystander CPR besides the requirement of mouth-to-mouth
ventilation (Coons 2009). It has been proved that continuity of
chest compression is critical for the individual’s survival, and inter-
ruption of circulation is negatively related to the prognosis of car-
diac arrest victims (Bobrow 2008). The longer the compressions
are interrupted, the lower the incidence of return of spontaneous
circulation (Paradis 1990), and the less likely the defibrillation
success (Yu 2002). The 2010 American Heart Association (AHA)
guidelines advocate that chest compression is essential for provid-
ing blood flow, and all patients should receive it (AHA 2010).
Artificial ventilation as part of CPR, however, may also have ad-
verse effects such as excessive ventilation and interruption of chest
compression. Although cardiac arrest can result from hypoxaemia,
in patients with circulatory standstill from primary cardiac causes,
blood oxygenation is typically normal until the arrest. In the first
four minutes of CPR without active ventilation, oxygen saturation
was more than 90% in a canine model; even after 10 minutes,
the oxygen saturation was above 70% (Chandra 1994). Noc et
al, investigated a domestic pig model of cardiac arrest and found
that the passive ventilation (precordial compression and sponta-
neous gasping) volume was more than 5 L in the fifth minute of
ventricular fibrillation (Noc 1995). Moreover, about 55% of out-
of-hospital cardiac arrests occur with spontaneous gasping, which
can provide the patient with some ventilation (Clark 1992). So it
appears to be more important to initially restore blood circulation
than push air into the lungs. As a consequence, the key change
of the 2010 AHA guideline is from a conventional airway-breath-
ing-circulation (A-B-C) sequence to circulation-airway-breathing
(C-A-B), and untrained lay rescuers in particular are encouraged
to do compression-only CPR (AHA 2010). These guidelines rec-
ommend initiating chest compressions as being most important
(AHA 2010). Moreover, the effect of ventilation is related to the
skill or training level of the provider. It is difficult and time con-
7

cardiac arrest (Review)

 suming to provide a bystander with instructions to perform ven-
tilation or rescue breaths during CPR. However, it is fairly sim-
ple to provide a bystander with instructions for chest compres-
sion. Some studies conclude that survival with compression-only
CPR initiated by bystanders is similar to, or even better than,
that provided by compression and ventilation CPR. This has been
demonstrated in several studies reporting improved survival or
neurological function outcomes (Bobrow 2010; Hallstrom 2000;
SOS-KANTO Group 2007; Svensson 2010; Tang 1994).
The new CPR guidelines encourage bystanders to provide com-
pression-only CPR before the arrival of emergency medical service
personnel. The American and European guidelines recommend
continuous chest compression-only CPR in telephone advice to
bystanders, especially when the rescuer is either unable or unwill-
ing to perform rescue breaths (AHA 2010; ERC 2010). Contin-
uous chest compression CPR performed by emergency medical
service providers reduce the interruption of compressions, which
is associated with higher rates of survival than interrupted com-
pressions (Bobrow 2008).
Why it is important to do this review
A flawed conclusion frequently encountered is that everybody
should perform continuous chest compression-only CPR, a fact
that is not well supported by the evidence because solid evidence
is available only for a specific situation. Specifically, the effect of
continuous chest compression-only CPR may be different if per-
formed by lay bystanders who obtain telephone advice as com-
pared to professional CPR providers who are well trained and
equipped. For bystanders, the willingness to perform CPR is as-
sociated with fear of acquiring infectious diseases by performing
mouth-to-mouth ventilation (Becker 1997). Less than 30% of all
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests receive bystander CPR (Eckstein
2005), which could be related to an unwillingness to perform
mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Effective instructions for bystanders
by emergency dispatchers that omit instructions for mouth-to-
mouth ventilation are a possible point of action to increase the
rate of bystander CPR. Many studies on telephone instructions
for bystander CPR have recently been published (Bobrow 2010;
Svensson 2010; SOS-KANTO Group 2007). Although there have
been studies supporting the effects of continuous chest compres-
sion-only CPR, others have shown that worse outcomes were ob-
tained by the use of continuous chest compression-only CPR com-
pared to conventional interrupted chest compression with pauses
for breathing CPR (Ogawa 2011; Travers 2010). Differences in
study design and quality make the interpretation challenging.
For professional CPR providers, however, hyperventilation during
CPR was identified as a relevant issue (Aufderheide 2004). Con-
tinuous chest compression-only CPR may accordingly have a very
different meaning here. Moreover, even if continuous chest com-
pression-only CPR proves effective, details on continuous chest
compression-only CPR performance, teaching and communica-
tion remain to be elucidated. And for professional CPR providers,
if they could get an AED nearby, the time of the AED arrival
would directly affect the outcome of the victim.
The first review on continuous chest compression-only CPR
was published in the Lancet (Hüpfl 2010). We consider that a
Cochrane Review will help us to further examine the effectiveness
of continuous chest compression-only CPR versus conventional
interrupted chest compression with pauses for breathing CPR.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included all randomized, quasi-randomized, and cluster-ran-
domized trials that compared the effects of continuous chest com-
pression CPR (with or without rescue breathing)and conventional
CPR plus rescue breathing (interrupted chest compression with
pauses at a fixed ratio provided by rescuers (bystanders or profes-
sional CPR providers) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
We excluded simulation studies on mannequins or other instru-
ments related to this topic.
Types of participants
We included adults and children suffering from out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest due to any cause.
Types of interventions
We considered continuous chest compression CPR (with or with-
out rescue breathing) provided by rescuers to be the intervention
group and conventional CPR plus rescue breathing ( interrupted
chest compression with pauses at a fixed ratio (standard CPR rec-
ommendedbythe guidelines(AHA 2000; AHA 2005; AHA 2010;
Handley 2005) as the control group.
The review question is addressed by two separate comparisons.
1. Bystander-administered continuous chest compression
CPR only versus interrupted chest compression plus artificial
ventilation for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

 2. Emergency service personnel-administered continuous
chest compression with asynchronous ventilation versus
interrupted chest compression plus artificial ventilation
following dispatch to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Survival to hospital discharge.
2. Survival to hospital admission, where a successful hospital
admission was defined as a patient admitted to hospital with
spontaneous circulation and measurable blood pressure, with or
without vasopressors (Cummins 1991).
Secondary outcomes
1. Survival at one year, core data which Utstein Style
recommend, and many studies routinely collect (Cummins
1991).
2. Neurological outcomes at hospital discharge and at one
year, as neurological outcome was a measurement of brain
function, the main vulnerable organ of cardiac arrest, measured
by Cerebral Performance Category and overall performance
category.
3. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), where a
detectable palpable pulse was an indication of ROSC, a useful
outcome in intervention studies (Cummins 1991).
4. Quality of life (also health-related quality of life), measured
with the 136-item self-reporting Sickness Impact Profile, or the
Health Utilities Index Mark 3, or other patient-reported
outcome scales.
5. Any adverse effects of an intervention.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Regis-
terof Controlledtrials(CENTRAL; Issue 12017, see Appendix 1);
MEDLINE (Ovid) (from 1985 to February 2017, see Appendix
2); Embase via Ovid (1985 to February 2017, see Appendix 3);
and Web of Science (1985 to February 2017, see Appendix 4).
We will base the search strategies for all other databases on the
MEDLINE strategy.

We will not impose any language or publication restrictions.
Searching other resources
We searched conference proceedings of important meetings and
abstracts including the American Heart Association (AHA), Eu-
ropean Resuscitation Council (ERC), American College of Car-
diology, European Society of Cardiology, American Academy of
Emergency Medicine, Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,
Society of Critical Care Medicine, and European Society of In-
tensive Care Medicine. We searched the reference lists of Inter-
national Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) evidence
worksheets, and we contacted experts in order to identify unpub-
lished research and trials. The search was completed in January
2016.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two authors (YH and LZ) independently abstracted data from the
results from the search methods above. We independently decided
which articles would be included through assessing the titles and
abstracts. An eligible study should have at least one of the out-
comes defined above. We then read the articles thoroughly and
extracted the necessary information. We recorded the information
in the study selection form (Appendix 5). We resolved disagree-
ments through discussion. If we did not reach a consensus, then
we consulted a third review author (HQ). We also contacted the
author of the relevant article to resolve the disagreement. If sev-
eral articles were associated with one study, we chose one article
which reported adequate data; if they contained mutual data, we
combined the data sets together as one study.
Data extraction and management
We (LZ and YH) independently extracted and collected the data
in a data extraction form (Appendix 6). We were not blinded to
the author, institution, or the publication source of trials. We re-
solved disagreements by discussion. A third review author (QH)
helped to resolve any discrepancies that the screening review au-
thors did not deal with. We approached all corresponding authors
of the included trials for additional information on the review’s
outcome measures and risk of bias components. For more specific
information please see Contributions of authors.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We (LZ and YH) judged the study quality from the risk of bias
using Cochrane’s tool for assessing risk of bias (Higgins 2011)
(Appendix 7). We also assessed the methodological quality of in-
cluded studies from four aspects, as described by Jüni 2001: se-
lection bias, biased allocation to comparison groups; performance
bias, unequal provision of care apart from treatment under evalu-
ation; detection bias, biased assessment of outcome; and attrition

 bias, biased occurrence and handling of deviations from proto-
col and loss to follow-up. We resolved any disagreements through
discussion with a third author (QH). We displayed the results by
creating a ’Risk of bias’ graph and a ’Risk of bias’ summary figure
using Review Manager 5 software, if appropriate (RevMan 2014).
We presented the risk of bias in the results section. We provided
summary assessments of the risk of bias for each outcome, within
and across studies.
We defined:
1. low risk of bias as plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter
the results;
2. unclear risk of bias as plausible bias which raises some
doubts about the results; and
3. high risk of bias as plausible bias that seriously weakens
confidence in the results (Higgins 2011).
Measures of treatment effect
We used the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)
to measure dichotomous outcome data. We used the adjusted risk
difference and adjusted mean difference presented in the trial re-
port for the cluster-RCT (Nichol 2015).
Unit of analysis issues
We included a cluster-RCT. We decided whether the method and
analysis used in cluster-randomized design was appropriate. We
critically appraised whether the authors of the cluster-RCT per-
formedanalysisonanindividual level accounting forclusteredran-
domization. As the data from the cluster-RCT were not combined
with any other study data, we used the adjusted risk difference
presented in the trial report (Nichol 2015). In future updates we
will consider methods for calculating effective sample sizes. None
of the included studies had multiple treatment groups, although
we planned to adopt the recommendations of the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Review of Interventions (Higgins 2011) (either
combine the groups to create a single pair-wise comparison or se-
lect one pair of groups and exclude the other groups).
Dealing with missing data
We contacted the first authors and contacted persons of the trials
with missingdatainordertoretrieve the relevantdata.We inputted
the missing data with replacement values and treated these as if
they were observed. If the authors performed an intention-to-treat
(ITT)analysis, we judgedthe detailedinformation providedbythe
study and decided whether the ITT was correct. If not, we created
an ITT analysis (as far as possible) from information presented in
the text or by obtaining extra information from the study author
or by using imputation.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We addressed clinical heterogeneity through detailed depicting of
the characteristics of the included studies (for example, partici-
pant age, sex, the training level of the rescuers, or the different
emergency medical service systems. Provided that data were ho-
mogeneous enough to be combined, we performed a meta-analy-
sis for all the included studies. We assessed the risk of bias and this
served to detect the methodological heterogeneity. We used the
Chi2 test to evaluate whether heterogeneity exists; P < 0.1 would
be considered as statistically significant. We used the I2 statistic
to quantify the inconsistencies. If the I2 statistic was greater than
40%, we considered the heterogeneity to be important (Higgins
2011).
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to use a funnel plot analysis to examine publication
bias if a minimum number of 10 studies were included in the
review. However, this review only included four trials, and so we
did not include a funnel plot. We planned to use the statistical
methods proposed by Rucker 2008 to test funnel plot asymmetry.
Data synthesis
After assessment of heterogeneity and if appropriate, we used
pooled RRs (dichotomous outcomes) and 95% CIs to perform a
meta-analysis, which was a method to summarize the effects across
studies. We used the I2 statistic to estimate the heterogeneity and
then decided which model we would use. If the I2 statistic was less
than 40%, we considered that the heterogeneity might not be im-
portant and we would choose the fixed-effect model meta-analysis,
which ignored the variability in different studies. The results of
the fixed-effect model represented the best estimate of the contin-
uous chest compression-only CPR compared to the conventional
interrupted chest compression CPR effect, which did not actually
exist in any population. If the I2 statistic was more than 40%, a
random-effects model meta-analysis might be more appropriate.
The pooled estimates in the random-effects model presented the
average effect of continuous chest compression-only CPR com-
pared to conventional interrupted chest compression CPR. We
used Review Manager 5 to perform the analysis (RevMan 2014).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If there were sufficient studies, we planned to split the participants
into adults and children in order to perform subgroups analysis.
We planned to do subgroup analysis according to different ba-
sic aetiologies, different settings (rural and urban) and different
providers’ level of training (untrained layperson, trained layperson
and healthcare provider).

 Sensitivity analysis
To determine whether the findings of the systematic review were
influenced by arbitrary or unclear decisions, we planned to per-
form sensitivity analyses as follows.
1. Exclude studies with large weight.
2. Exclude high risk of bias trials.
3. Use non-ITT data and ITT data in the analyses.
4. Use fixed-effect and random-effects model analyses.
We decided not to exclude studies on the basis of bias since they
were at low risk of bias for the domains of interest and we decided
not to explore the effect of different analysis populations on the
results for the outcomes of interest since this was available for only
one study.
’Summary of findings’ table and GRADE
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the body of
evidence (Guyatt 2008). We presented evidence for the following
outcomes in two ’Summary of findings’ tables.
• Survival to hospital discharge.
• Survival to hospital admission.
• Survival at one year.
• Neurological outcomes at hospital discharge and at one year
(if available).
• Return of spontaneous circulation.
• Adverse effects
• Quality of life
We prepared two ’Summary of findings’ tables to present findings
for the comparison of different CPR types for bystander-continu-
ous chest compression without rescue breathing versus interrupted
compression with fixed ratio rescue breathing (15: 2) Summary
of findings for the main comparison; and for professional-pro-
vided CPR: continuous chest compression (100/min) with asyn-
chronous rescue breathing (10/min) versus interrupted chest com-
pression with fixed ratio rescue breathing (30: 2) Summary of
findings 2
The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of evidence
based on the extent to which one can be confident that an esti-
mate of effect or association reflects the item being assessed. The
quality of a body of evidence considers within study risk of bias,
the directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision
of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias.

 Results of the search
We originally ran the searches in January 2016, we found 7534
records. From those 7534 records, we excluded 1950 duplicates.
We excluded a further 5571 papers by judging the abstract or the
title, as they did not fit our eligibility criteria (randomized, quasi-
randomized and cluster-randomized trials that compared the ef-
fects of continuous chest compression and interrupted compres-
sion plus artificial ventilation in CPR provided by rescuers for
out-of hospital cardiac arrest). We found one ongoing study of
interest (NCT02401633). Thirteen papers remained for closer in-
spection of the full-text. From those 13 papers, we excluded five
observational studies, three review articles, and one mannequin
study. We included three RCTs in our review (Hallstrom 2000;
Rea 2010; Svensson 2010), and one cross-over cluster-random-
ized trial (Nichol 2015). We reran the search in February 2017
and found the following records: CENTRAL 116; Embase 261;
MEDLINE 321 and Web of Science 167; we did not find any
studies of interest.
Included studies
We included three RCTs and one cluster-RCT in our review. A
total of 29,885 participants were included in the four trials, but
only 26,742 participants were included for analysis in our review.
One of the trials was undertaken in the USA (Hallstrom 2000), a
second in Sweden (Svensson 2010),a third in both the USA and
the UK (Rea 2010), and the fourth in both the USA and Canada
(Nichol 2015).
All four trials included out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In three tri-
als CPR was delivered by bystanders (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010;
Svensson 2010), and in one trial CPR was delivered by emergency
medical service providers (Nichol 2015). We excluded participants
who arrested due to non-cardiac reasons, such as drug overdose,
alcohol intoxication or trauma. One trial enrolled adult partici-
pants (Rea 2010), the second enrolled participants who were equal
to, or older than eight years of age (Svensson 2010), and two
trials provided no information regarding the age of the partici-
pants (Hallstrom 2000; Nichol 2015). The mean age (years) of
the continuous chest compression group was 67.9 in Hallstrom
2000, 68 in Svensson 2010, 63.4 in Rea 2010, and 66.4 in Nichol
2015. The mean age (years) of the interrupted chest compression
plus artificial ventilation group was 68.5 in Hallstrom 2000, 67
in Svensson 2010, 63.9 in Rea 2010, and 66.2 in Nichol 2015.
Interventions in the bystander-provided CPR trials
In the three trials (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010),
when the dispatchers received calls about suspected out-of-hos-
pital cardiac arrest recognized by bystanders, they (the dispatch-
ers) ascertained whether the patients met the inclusion criteria by
communicating with the bystanders. In one trial (Rea 2010), a
further postrandomization assessment of eligibility was performed
by the emergency medical service personnel when they arrived.
Participants with signs of irreversible arrest, or those considered
not to be in arrest at this stage, were excluded from the study. This
was because the emergency medical service personnel would not
provide CPR for these participants (Rea 2010).
In all three trials (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010),
when the dispatcher determined the participants’ eligibility, and
that the bystanders were willing to be instructed, the dispatcher
then gave the bystanders instructions via the telephone on either
continuous chest compression-only CPR or conventional (inter-
rupted chest compression with pauses at a fixed rate for rescue
breathing) CPR.
In the intervention group, continuous chest compressions were
performed without rescue breathing. In the control group, inter-
rupted chest compressions plus rescue breathing were performed
in a ratio of 2 to 15 (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010).
In all three trials, CPR was performed by bystanders who had
not been trained (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010).
Other follow-up treatments performed by emergency medical ser-
vice personnel or emergency physicians were not detected in the
three trials (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010).
All three trials reported survival to hospital discharge (Hallstrom
2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010).
Rea 2010 reported a favourable neurologic status at the time of
hospital discharge, defined as a Cerebral Performance Category
of 1 or 2. However, one study site (the author did not provide
information on which site) was unable to assess the participants’
neurologic status at discharge, so for this outcome, the author
restricted presentation of the results to the two sites that were able
to ascertain neurologic status.
Hallstrom 2000 reported admission to hospital. They also re-
ported the neurological status in the survivors, however, they did
not describe whether or not the neurologic status was measured
by the Cerebral Performance Category.
Interventions in the professional-provided CPR trial
In Nichol 2015, the author assessed whether outcomes after con-
tinuous chest compressions with positive-pressure ventilation dif-
feredfrominterruptedcompressionsthatwere interruptedforven-
tilations at a ratio of 30 compressions to two ventilations. In the
intervention group, participants received continuous chest com-
pressions at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, with asyn-
chronous positive-pressure ventilations delivered at a rate of 10
ventilations per minute. In the control group, participants received
compressions that were interrupted for ventilations at a ratio of
30 compressions to two ventilations; ventilations were to be given

 with positive pressure during a pause in compressions of less than
5 seconds in duration (Nichol 2015).
The primary outcome in Nichol 2015 was the rate of survival
to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included survival to
hospital admission, neurologic function at discharge (modified
Rankin scale), return of spontaneous circulation at emergency de-
partment arrival, and adverse events.
Of 23,711 participants included in this study (Nichol 2015),
the author found that in participants with out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest, continuous chest compressions during CPR, with asyn-
chronous rescue breathing, performed by emergency medical ser-
vice providers did not result in significantly higher rates of sur-
vival or favourable neurologic function than did interrupted chest
compressions and fixed ratio rescue breathing, and hospital-free
survival was significantly shorter in the continuous chest compres-
sions group than in the interrupted chest compressions group.

 Allocation
Two trials reported that the randomized number sequence was
generated by a computer (Hallstrom 2000; Svensson 2010). The
third trial did not describe how randomization was generated (Rea
2010). We considered two trials to have adequate allocation con-
cealment (Rea 2010; Svensson 2010). In Rea 2010, a sealed en-
velope containing the CPR instructions was opened by the dis-
patcher after receiving the call and assessing the eligibility. In
Svensson 2010, the type of CPR, with which the caller was in-
structed, was determined on the basis of the next available data
collection sheet for each dispatcher, who removed a paper strip
covering the treatment assignment on the sheet after determining
that the inclusion criteria had been met. In Hallstrom 2000, it was
reported that the allocation was determined by a microcomputer
located at the dispatcher’s console. We considered there to be an
unclear risk of selection bias in Hallstrom 2000, as no further in-
formation was stated.
Nichol 2015, did not describe how randomization was generated,
but allocation was concealed. Clusters of agencies in the trial were
randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio to perform continuous chest
compressions or interrupted chest compressions during all the out-
of-hospital cardiac arrests to which they responded. Twice per
year (Nichol 2015), each cluster was crossed over to the other
intervention.
Blinding
In one trial (Hallstrom 2000), the emergency medical service per-
sonnel and the emergency physicians were blinded. The emer-
gency medical service personnel and other physicians were not
blinded in the other two trials examining bystander CPR (Rea
2010; Svensson 2010). In all three trials the bystanders were not
blinded, but they did not know that they were recruited into the
trial, so we considered that this would not have had an important
effect on the outcomes. As the participants were unconscious and
were not breathing normally, we considered that the blinding of
the participants would not affect the outcomes. Thus, we consid-
ered there to be a low risk of performance bias for Hallstrom 2000
and a high risk of performance bias for the remaining two trials
(Rea 2010; Svensson 2010).
Two trials reported blinded outcome assessment (Hallstrom 2000;
Rea 2010). In one trial (Svensson 2010), data were collected from
emergencymedical service records,andinformationabout survival
status was collected from national registers. Although there was
no description about blinding in the Svensson 2010 trial, 50%
of the data collection forms were double-checked and no relevant
deviations were observed. In addition, the researchers evaluated
100 recorded calls and reviewed the corresponding data collection
forms, finding no deviation of the information in each (Svensson
2010). Thus, we considered the three trials to be at a low risk of
detection bias.
Nichol 2015 was an unblinded trial; the providers of CPR in each
cluster knew that they were recruited in this study, so this might
have performance bias. But in this trial, once a cluster was able
to demonstrate proficiency with the given treatment by meeting
prespecified performance and compliance benchmarks, as deter-
mined by the Study Monitoring Committee, they were progressed
into the Active Enrolment Phase, if one cluster was unable to meet
benchmarks after six months, it was subsequently dropped from
the trial. Since the participants were unconscious and not breath-
ing normally, we considered that the blinding of the participants
would not affect the outcomes. So we considered performance
bias as low, even though the providers of CPR in each cluster were
unblinded.
In Nichol 2015, an interdisciplinary study monitoring committee
periodically reviewed data masked to treatment outcome. This
committee met at least monthly throughout the enrolment period
of the trial, and had authority to require an emergency medical
service agency to improve its study performance, or to place an
agency on probation until performance improved, or to suspend
an agency from ongoing enrolment in the trial. So we considered
the detection bias in this trial as low.
Incomplete outcome data
In Hallstrom 2000, the data of two participants were missing. In
Rea 2010, the missing data in both groups was 1.7%. In Svensson
2010, the percentage of missing data was 6.8%, furthermore the
authors performed a subgroup analysis excluding districts where
more than 18% of the participants were lost to follow-up. No
difference from the main results was found. In Nichol 2015, data
regarding the primary outcome were available for 99.7% of the
intervention group and 99.8% of the control group. Thus, we
considered the four trials as being at a low risk of attrition bias.
Selective reporting
The core outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients rec-
ommended by the Utstein Style were reported in all four trials
(Cummins 1991). So we considered the four trials to be at a low
risk of reporting bias.
Other potential sources of bias
We didnotfindanyotherpotential sourcesof bias(such asconflicts
of interest) in the four included trials.

Primary outcomes
1. Survival to hospital discharge
Bystander-provided CPR
(See: Analysis 1.1; Figure 3; Summary of findings for the main
comparison).
Figure 3.
Forest plot of comparison: Bystander-provided CPR , outcome: 1.1 Survival to hospital discharge.
All three trials in the bystander-provided CPR comparison re-
ported survival to hospital discharge (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010;
Svensson 2010). There were 1500 participants recruited in the
intervention group, and 1531 in the control group. There were
no significant differences between the two groups in the trials.
The pooled result showed better survival for the continuous chest
compression alone group (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.46; Chi² = 0.76, df = 2 (P = 0.68); I² statis-
tic = 0%, 3 trials, 3031 participants, high-quality evidence).
Professional-provided CPR
(See: Table 2; Analysis 2.1; Summary of findings 2).
The one cluster-RCT in the professional-provided CPR (Nichol
2015) reported survival to hospital discharge on 12,613 partici-
pants recruited to the intervention group and 11,035 recruited in
the control group. The difference in survival (9.0% versus 9.7%)
did not achieve statistical, survival in the continuous compression
group being lower with an ARD of -0.7% (95% CI -1.5% to
0.1%; P = 0.07, moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision).
2. Survival to hospital admission
Bystander-provided CPR
(See: Analysis 1.2; Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Only one trial reported this outcome (Hallstrom 2000). The re-
sult showed no significant difference between the two groups (RR
1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.48); 1 trial, 520 participants). We judged
the evidence to be of moderate-quality for this outcome due to
imprecision.
Professional-provided CPR
(See: Analysis 2.2; Summary of findings 2).
This outcome was reported for 12,653 participants to the inter-
vention group and 11,058 to the control group (Nichol 2015).
There was no significant difference (ARD -1.3% (95% CI -2.4%
to -0.2%; P = 0.03, high-quality evidence).
Secondary outcomes
1. Survival at one year
We found no data on this outcome.

 (See: Analysis 1.3; Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Only one trial reported neurological outcomes at hospital dis-
charge (Rea 2010); the results showed no significant differences
between the two groups in the number of patients with a Cerebral
Performance Category classification of 1 (good cerebral perfor-
mance) or 2 (moderate cerebral disability) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94
to 1.66); 1 trial, 1286 participants, moderate-quality evidence due
to imprecision.
Professional-provided CPR
(See: Analysis 2.3; Summary of findings 2).
The Nichol 2015 cluster-RCT measured this outcome using the
modified Rankin scale (score 0 = no symptoms to 6 = death; score
≤ 3 indicates favourable neurological function). This outcome
was reported for 12,560 participants recruited to the intervention
group and 10,995 in the control group. The ARD (Rankin score
≤ 3) showed no significant difference (-0.06% (95% CI 0.0% to
0.08%; P = 0.09, high-quality evidence).
3. Return of spontaneous circulation
Bystander-provided CPR
We found no data for this outcome.
Professional-provided CPR
(See: Summary of findings 2).
The Nichol 2015 cluster-RCT reported this outcome in 12,646
participants recruited to the intervention group and 11,051 in
the control group. Those receiving continuous chest compression
plus asynchronous rescue breathing were less likely to experience
a return to spontaneous circulation (ARD -1.1% (95% CI -2.4%
to 0.1%; P = 0.07, high-quality evidence).
4. Quality of life
We found no data for this outcome.
5. Adverse effects
Bystander-provided CPR
No adverse effects were reported.
Professional-provided CPR
(See: Analysis 2.5; Summary of findings 2).
The Nichol 2015 cluster-RCT reported that there was no signif-
icant difference between the two treatment groups in the rates
of individual adverse events. Rates of adverse events were 54.4%
in those treated with continuous chest compressions plus asyn-
chronous rescue breathing versus 55.4% in people treated with in-
terrupted chest compression plus rescue breathing, with the ARD
being -1% (-2.3 to 0.4, moderate-quality evidence).
Subgroup analysis
We planned to perform a subgroup analysis according to the age
of the victims, and so we contacted the authors of the trials by e-
mail in order to obtain the individual data. However no further
data was forthcoming from the study authors. None of the three
trials were performed in a rural setting, so we did not perform
a subgroup analysis according to rural and urban settings. The
bystanders in all three trials were untrained.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis by using different models; as
would be expected with the low level of statistical heterogeneity
the pooled results for survival to hospital discharge were identical
with the random-effects and the fixed-effect models.
We performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding the trial with a
large weight (Rea 2010). The pooled results were similar when
this trial was excluded (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77).
Publication bias
There were too few trials to enable us to draw inferences from
funnel plots (less than 10), so we did not present them in the
current version of this review.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: confidence interval; CPR: cardiopulmonary resuscitation; ARD: adjusted risk difference.
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High-quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate-quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low-quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low-quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1 Not downgraded for risk of bias. Although the nature of the studies meant that study personnel would be aware of which
mode of CPR was administered, we do not believe that this would have affected survival outcomes.
2 Downgraded one level due to imprecision. The confidence interval of the absolute effect estimate includes little or no
difference between the two interventions.
3 We did not downgrade return to spontaneous rhythm for imprecision because the confidence interval excluded a meaningful
increase in the likelihood of this event with continuous chest compressions.

cardiac arrest (Review)

Summary of main results
We identified four trials which evaluated the effect of continuous
chest compression CPR versus conventional (interrupted chest
compression) CPR for OHCA (Hallstrom 2000; Nichol 2015;
Rea 2010; Svensson 2010). A total of 26,742 participants were
enrolled for analysis in the four trials. Three trials were RCTs,
in which CPR was delivered by bystanders (Hallstrom 2000;
Rea 2010; Svensson 2010), and one trial was a cluster-RCT, in
which CPR was delivered by emergency medical service providers
(Nichol 2015). All trials reported the primary outcomes of survival
to hospital discharge and survival to hospital admission. Loss to
follow-up in all trials was within an acceptable range.
Pooled data from three trials of bystander-initiated CPR showed
an increase in the number of people surviving to hospital discharge
from 11.6% to 14% when continuous chest compression-only
CPR was used compared with interrupted chest compression plus
ventilation (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010). Only
one trial reported the outcome of survival to hospital admission
(Hallstrom 2000), and one trial reported neurological outcomes at
hospital discharge (Rea 2010); we found no significant differences
between the two treatment groups (see: Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3).
Only one trial involved CPR performed by emergency medical ser-
vice providers (Nichol 2015). Nichol 2015 reported that contin-
uous chest compressions plus asynchronous rescue breathing did
not result in significantly higher rates of survival compared to in-
terrupted chest compressions plus ventilation. The result showed
a statistically significant difference between the two groups in sur-
vival to hospital admission (risk difference (RD) -1.3, 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) -2.4% to -0.2%). There were no significant
differences between the two treatment groups in neurological out-
comes at hospital discharge (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.00% to 0.08%)
and the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (RD -1.1, 95%
CI -2.4% to 0.2%). Nichol 2015 also showed that there was no
significant difference between the two treatment groups in the
rates of individual adverse events.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
All four trials included out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but excluded
asphyxial arrests (Hallstrom 2000; Rea 2010; Svensson 2010;
Nichol 2015). Furthermore, the four trials included the common
first cardiac rhythm of the participants who suffered cardiac arrest,
such as ventricular fibrillation, asystole, pulseless electrical activity
and ventricular tachycardia etc. We identified no data on return to
spontaneous rhythm or long-term outcomes following bystander-
initiated CPR (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Limited information was reported on adverse events.
Although the advanced life support methods were performed ac-
cording to different guidelines respectively, we felt that such clin-
ical heterogeneity was negligible because no evidence has been
found to demonstrate that there was any effect of different guide-
lines on the clinical therapy. All four trials in our review were per-
formed in urban settings. The mean intervals from call to emer-
gency medical service arrival varied from 4.0 to 10.3 minutes in
the four trials (Hallstrom 2000; Nichol 2015; Rea 2010; Svensson
2010). Unfortunately, we do not have enough data to perform a
posthoc analysis to assess the association between the time interval
of emergency medical service arrival and outcomes.
Quality of the evidence
We did not downgrade the quality of the evidence due to risk of
bias for survival to hospital discharge because the objective nature
of the outcome means that it is unlikely to be influenced by the
unblinded nature of the interventions for bystander administered
CPR. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to impreci-
sion for two outcomes following bystander administered CPR in
Summary of findings for the main comparison where there were a
low number of events and small sample sizes. Although the lower
limit of the confidence interval for risk ratio for the outcome of
survival to hospital discharge following bystander CPR is close to
1, the high rate of mortality in this population overall means that
our confidence in the result is high. For the comparison of differ-
ent CPR approaches administered by emergency medical staff, we
downgraded the quality of evidence for survival to discharge and
adverse effects due to imprecision. The confidence intervals were
wide enough to justify the decision to adopt either resuscitation
strategy (Summary of findings 2). We did not consider the studies
or outcomes to be indirect and there was no obvious evidence of
publication bias in this review, so we did not downgrade the qual-
ity of the evidence for any outcomes due to these limitations.
Potential biases in the review process
Whilst our searches are comprehensive, there may be completed,
unregistered studies that our searches have not been able to iden-
tify. Our attempts to examine the effect of age on survival out-
comes were unsuccessful, and this remains an uncertainty that
future research should investigate. For most outcomes from the
Nichol 2015 trial, we have used data for the ITT population in
preference to that available for the safety population. Whilst results
obtained with these populations were similar for adverse event
data, the effect on survival attenuated slightly from a difference in
risk of 0.7% to 0.2%.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews

Continuous chest compression versus interrupted chest compression for cardiopulmonary resuscitation of non-asphyxial out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (Review)
Copyright © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 When CPR was performed by bystanders, three observational
studies addressed similar objectives to our review (Bohm 2007;
Crane 2008; Ong 2008). Theobservational studies showed that
there were no significant differences in the outcomes between the
two treatment groups. The lay bystanders made the decision as to
whether to give mouth-to-mouth ventilation or not, and perform
CPR, without the dispatchers’ assistance.
However, in another prospective cohort study conducted in Ari-
zona (Bobrow 2010), there was a CPR training programme called
the Save Hearts in Arizona Registry and Education (SHARE) pro-
gramme. The bystanders in that study, who called emergency med-
ical service when an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest had taken place,
were mostly trained in the continuous CPR technique. The results
of this study show that layperson compression-only CPR is asso-
ciated with an increased survival rate compared with conventional
CPR, which is consistent with our pooled results. The result of this
study (Bobrow 2010),was different to our review when CPR was
performed by emergency medical service providers. The quality
of compression cannot be monitored when CPR was performed
by bystanders, we presume that even the bystanders were trained
in CPR training program, the quality of compression was poorer
than that performed by professional providers. The technique of
COCPR was easer than conventional CPR, so we presume that
when CPR was performed by bystanders which were trained in
CPR program, the quality of compression in COCPR would be
better than that in conventional CPR. But when CPR was per-
formed by professional providers, the quality of compress may be
the same in most time whatever in COCPR or conventional CPR.
This may be the reason that the result of Bobrow 2010 was dif-
ferent from our review when CPR was performed by professional
providers, but the same when CPR was performed by bystanders.
In our review, there were two subgroups: bystander-provided CPR;
and professional-provided CPR. The results of the two subgroups
in our review were different. We suspect that a reason for the dif-
ference was because of differences in the quality of the compres-
sion.
The Hüpfl 2010 review performed a meta-analysis of continu-
ous chest compression-only CPR versus standard CPR for out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest, and included the same three RCTs as our
Cochrane Review. As expected, the pooled data showed similar
findings to our own.

Implications for practice
According to our pooled results, when CPR was performed by
untrained bystanders who were assisted by receiving telephone in-
struction from emergency services, continuous chest compression-
only CPR led to more people surviving to hospital discharge com-
pared with interrupted chest compression plus artificial ventila-
tion CPR for non asphyxial OHCA. The difference in survival
to hospital discharge is about 25 more people per 1000 follow-
ing bystander administered continuous chest compression. When
CPR was performed by professional providers, continuous chest
compressions with asynchronous rescue breathing did not result
in higher rates of survival compared with interrupted chest com-
pressions plus rescue breathing CPR for non asphyxial OHCA.
The results indicate slightly lower rates of survival to admission or
discharge, favourable neurological outcome and return of sponta-
neous circulation observed following continuous chest compres-
sion. Adverse effects were slightly lower with continuous chest
compression.
Implications for research
Our review has identified moderate or high quality evidence for
short-term survival outcomes in bystander-initiated resuscitation,
and high quality evidence for short-term survival outcomes in
professionally provided resuscitation. Future studies should in-
clude evaluations of adverse effects, and of longer-term neuro-
logical outcomes and quality of life. The influence of automated
external defibrillator (AED) availability and AED use on the ef-
fect of continuous chest compression CPR needs to be examined.
Likewise, it remains unclear whether the concept of continuous
chest compression CPR is appropriate for paediatric cardiac arrest.
One ongoing study is addressing the question of feasibility in a
smaller sample size to the studies we have identified in this review
(NCT02401633).

Methods
Randomized controlled trial
Participants
Inclusion criteria:
Participants who were recognized to be unconscious and not breathing normally by
callers who willing to undertake CPR with the dispatcher’s assistance
Exclusion criteria:
Cases in which there was no cardiac arrest; cases of drug overdose, alcohol intoxication,
or carbon monoxide poisoning; cases in which advanced cardiac life support was not
carried out; and cases due to trauma. And the caller was not at the scene, or cardiac arrest
occurred after the call
520 participants were included
Interventions
Intervention group: the bystander was instructed to perform chest compressions alone
Contral group: the bystander was instructed to perform chest compressions plus rescue
breathing, with 2 initial rescue breaths followed by 15 chest compressions and subsequent
cycles continuing the pattern in a ratio of 2 to 15
Outcomes
The primary end point was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary end points included
admission to the hospital and estimated neurologic status in the survivors
Notes
The study started before the guidelines for CPR changed the recommendation from
2 ventilations alternating with 15 compressions to 30 compressions alternating with 2
ventilations.The instructions in this study of 2 ventilations alternating with 15 compres-
sions were maintained

In the study, emergency medical services personnel other
than those in the dispatch office were generally unaware
that an episode might be part of a trial. The paramedics
who completed the field reports typically arrived after the
first responding personnel and thus had limited knowl-
edge of the type or quality of bystander CPR that may
have been performed. Hospitalization data and func-

personnel were unaware of the treatment assignments

Methods
Cluster-randomized trial with cross-over. Eight sites in the USA and Canada. Each cluster
spent six months on the allocated arm before crossing over to the other arm of the study
every six months
Participants
Inclusion criteria:
Adult participants with non-trauma-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received
chest compressions performed by providers from participating EMS agencies who were
dispatched to the scene
Exclusion criteria:
Patients were excluded if they had an EMS-witnessed arrest, a written advance directive
to not resuscitate, a traumatic injury, an asphyxial cause of arrest, uncontrolled bleeding
or exsanguination, known pregnancy, or preexisting tracheostomy; were known to be
prisoners; had initial CPR performed by a nonparticipating EMS provider; were treated
with a mechanical chest-compression device before manual CPR by ROC EMS person-
nel; had advanced airway management before ROC EMS agency arrival; or had, a priori,
opted not to participate in resuscitation research
Interventions
Intervention group: Continuous chest compressions at a rate of 100 compressions/min
with asynchronous positive-pressure ventilations (10/min)
Control group: Interrupted chest compressions plus ventilations at a ratio of 30 com-
pressions to two positive-pressure ventilations (given during < 5 second pause in com-
pressions
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the rate of survival to hospital discharge
Secondary outcomes included survival to hospital admission, neurologic function at
discharge (modified Rankin scale), ROSC at emergency department arrival, adverse

Notes
In this trial, participants with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest received chest compressions
performed by providers from participating EMS agencies who were dispatched to the
scene, not bystanders which was different from the other three trials in this review.

Randomization of clusters was stratified by
site and by blocks of concealed size within

This trial is an unblinded trial, the
providers of CPR in each cluster knew that
they are recruited in this study, so this
may have performance bias. But in this
trial, once a cluster was able to demon-
strate proficiency with the given treatment
by meeting prespecified performance and
compliance benchmarks as determined by
the Study Monitoring Committee, they
were progressed into the Active Enrolment
Phase, if one cluster was unable to meet
benchmarks after 6 months, it was subse-
quently dropped from the trial. So we con-
sidered performance bias to be low even
though the providers of CPR in each clus-

Participants
Eligibility assessing when dispatcher’s received call:
Inclusion criteria:
Participants who were recognized to be unconscious and not breathing normally by
bystander willing to undertake CPR with the dispatcher’s assistance
Exclusion criteria:
Participants with arrest due to trauma, drowning, or asphyxiation (from choking, stran-
gulation, or suffocation), as well as participants who were under 18 years of age; and
those who had ’do-not-resuscitate’ status or were already receiving CPR
Final eligibility determination after randomization:
Participants who were unconscious and not breathing normally but were deemed not
to be in arrest and persons who had a confirmed arrest but were found to have signs of
irreversible death, in which case EMS personnel did not attempt resuscitation
1941 participants were included
Interventions
Intervention group: the bystander was instructed to perform chest compressions alone,
providing 50 consecutive compressions in one cycle
Control group: the bystander was instructed to perform chest compressions plus rescue
breathing, with 2 initial rescue breaths followed by 15 chest compressions and subsequent

cycles continuing the pattern in a ratio of 2 to 15
In both groups, with the dispatcher still on the telephone, the bystander then performed
one cycle of CPR during which the dispatcher asked the bystander to count the chest
compressions out loud. After the first cycle, the dispatcher could inquire about signs of
life and, if warranted, encourage the bystander to continue CPR
Outcomes
Survival to hospital discharge, ROSC at the end of EMS care, neurologic status at the time
of hospital discharge (a favourable neurologic status was defined as a cerebral performance
category of 1 or 2. (There are five Cerebral Performance Categories: category 1 represents
good cerebral performance, 2 moderate cerebral disability, 3 severe cerebral disability, 4
coma or vegetative state, and 5 death)
Notes
The study started before the guidelines for CPR changed the recommendation from
2 ventilations alternating with 15 compressions to 30 compressions alternating with 2
ventilations. The instructions in this study of 2 ventilations alternating with 15 com-

Participants
Inclusion criteria: The collapse had been witnessed (seen or heard), and the participant
was unconscious and was not breathing or not breathing normally
Exclusion criteria:
Cardiac arrest caused by trauma, airway obstruction, drowning, or intoxication; partic-
ipants’s age under 8 years; and difficulty of the dispatcher in communicating with the
caller. Some at the scene had started CPR already before the caller, or the caller already
knew how to perform CPR
1276 participants were included
Interventions
Intervention group: the caller was instructed to perform compression-only CPR
Contral group: the caller was instructed to perform standard CPR (mouth-to-mouth
ventilation plus chest compression, consisting of 2 ventilations alternating with 15 com-
pressions)
Outcomes
The primary end point was 30-day survival. The secondary end points were 1-day
survival, defined as survival until midnight of the day of admission to the hospital, as
well as the first detected cardiac rhythm and survival to discharge from the hospital
Notes
The study started before the guidelines for CPR changed the recommendation from
2 ventilations alternating with 15 compressions to 30 compressions alternating with 2

We made the following changes to the published protocol (Yang 2012).
1. The title was changed. The title of the published protocol was: ’Chest compression alone versus chest compression plus artificial
ventilation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest’ (Yang 2012). The title of the review is: ’Continuous chest compression versus
interrupted chest compression for cardiopulmonary resuscitation of non asphyxial out-of-hospital cardiac arrest’. The changes to the
title have been reflected in other parts of the review, for example the objectives, types of studies and types of interventions sections.
2. The harms of an intervention are as important as the benefits, so we added the outcome ’adverse effects’ to this review.
3. A recently published large trial involving professional-provider CPR (Nichol 2015), compared continuous chest compression
plus ventilation CPR with conventional CPR. This trial was a cluster-RCT trial with cross-over design, so we revised our review and
included the cross-over design study. As the data from the cluster-RCT were not combined with any other study data we used the
adjusted risk difference presented in the trial report.
