Multicontaminant air pollution in Chinese cities
Lijian Han,a Weiqi Zhou,a Steward TA Pickett,b Weifeng Lia & Yuguo Qiana
Introduction
Air pollution in cities is a major concern worldwide, irre-
spective of a country’s level of development. In high-income 
countries, air quality has improved substantially since the 
1970s; however, the adverse health effects of exposure to 
relatively low-level pollution remains a public concern.1 In 
contrast, air quality in some middle- and low-income coun-
tries, such as China and India, has seriously deteriorated.2 
Before the 1920s, the main cause of urban air pollution in 
high-income countries was the rapid spread of coal-fired in-
dustry during the second phase of the Industrial Revolution. 
The major contaminants produced by coal combustion are 
particulate matter and sulfur dioxide (SO2). After the1920s, a 
new source of air pollution emerged with the widespread use 
of the automobile, which emits particulate matter, nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), lead and other contaminants. However in 
some middle- and low-income countries, e.g. China, the de-
velopment of coal-fired industries and increased automobile 
use have overlapped, which has resulted in the emission of a 
complex mix of air contaminants.3,4
Most studies of the health effects of air pollution have 
focused on individual contaminants, such as particulate 
matter, NO2, SO2, ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide, with 
each considered to have an independent impact.5–7 However, 
in reality the urban atmosphere is never confronted with a 
single contaminant but is actually exposed to a complex mix 
of different contaminants at varying times of the day and 
year. Consequently, people are more likely to be exposed to 
a mixture of contaminants than to a single substance, the 
resultant impact on human health can be highly varied.8 For 
instance, some contaminants (e.g. NO2 and O3) affect the 
respiratory system, some (e.g. particulate matter) affect the 
circulatory system and cause heart disease and others (e.g. 
SO2) affect the skin and mucous membranes. Although few 
epidemiological studies have looked at the combined effect of 
several air contaminants, it can be assumed that they will have 
an impact on different parts of human body. For example, 
the combination of NO2 and particulate matter pollution will 
affect both respiratory and cardiovascular systems.5,6 As it 
can lead to these complex conditions, exposure to multicon-
taminant air pollution is important and should be quantified, 
especially in rapidly urbanizing developing countries where 
mixtures of contaminants are common.4,9
Previous research has paid particular attention to un-
derstanding how specific contaminants affect public health 
in developing countries. Although important, this approach 
may underestimate the actual impact of urban air pollution 
on public health. In fact, there have been calls for a shift 
from a single-contaminant to a multicontaminant approach 
to countering the health effects of air pollution.5 The aims of 
this study were: (i) to document the mixture of air contami-
nants in Chinese cities both annually and diurnally; (ii) to 
determine the proportion of the urban population affected 
by multicontaminant air pollution; and (iii) to investigate the 
relationship between the size of the urban population and the 
frequency of occurrence of high levels of multicontaminant 
air pollution.
Methods
We obtained data on air quality for 155 cities (including 
all 31 provincial capitals and 124 major prefectural cities) 
from China’s urban air quality monitoring network, which 
reports concentrations of air contaminants under the newly 
upgraded ambient air quality standard GB3095–2012. For 
this study, we used hourly concentrations of fine particu-
late matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), 
coarse particulate matter with a diameter between 2.5 and 
10 μm (PM10), NO2, SO2 and O3 for the whole of 2014. To 
Objective To investigate multicontaminant air pollution in Chinese cities, to quantify the urban population affected and to explore the 
relationship between air pollution and urban population size.
Methods We obtained data for 155 cities with 276 million inhabitants for 2014 from China’s air quality monitoring network on concentrations of 
fine particulate matter measuring under 2.5 μm (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter measuring 2.5 to 10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur 
dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3). Concentrations were considered as high, if they exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guideline limits.
Findings Overall, 51% (142 million) of the study population was exposed to mean annual multicontaminant concentrations above WHO 
limits – east China and the megacities were worst affected. High daily levels of four-contaminant mixtures of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3 and 
PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 occurred on up to 110 days in 2014 in many cities, mainly in Shandong and Hebei Provinces. High daily levels of 
PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 occurred on over  146 days in 110 cities, mainly in east and central China. High daily levels of mixtures of PM2.5 and PM10, 
PM2.5 and SO2, and PM10 and SO2 occurred on over  146 days in 145 cities, mainly in east China. Surprisingly, multicontaminant air pollution 
was less frequent in cities with populations over 10 million than in smaller cities.
Conclusion Multicontaminant air pollution was common in Chinese cities. A shift from single-contaminant to multicontaminant evaluations 
of the health effects of air pollution is needed. China should implement protective measures during future urbanization.

Multicontaminant air pollution in China
Lijian Han et al.
assess pollution levels and their poten-
tial impact on public health, we used 
guideline values for annual and daily 
ambient air quality provided by the 
World Health Organization (WHO; 
Table 1).10 We averaged hourly con-
centrations to obtain annual means 
for all contaminants, 24-hour means 
for PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 and 8-hour 
means for O3. For the NO2 concentra-
tion, we retained the hourly values. 
Finally, we determined how frequently 
annual and daily multicontaminant air 
pollution due to various combinations 
of three, four and five contaminants 
(Table 2; available at: http://www.who.
int/bulletin/volumes/96/4/17-195560) 
exceeded the values in Table 1 for 
individual substances. We obtained 
the size of the population in each of 
the 155 cities, as reported in the 2010 
census, from the National Bureau of 
Statistics of China.11 In total, these cities 
accounted for 41.2% of China’s urban 
population in 2010.
The main variable of interest in our 
study was exposure to a high level of 
multicontaminant air pollution, which 
was defined as occurring when the con-
centration of a contaminant exceeded 
the relevant WHO value in Table 1. 
Annual exposure to multicontaminant 
air pollution was assessed for combi-
nations of two or three contaminants 
and daily exposure was assessed for 
combinations of two, three, four or five 
contaminants (Table 2). To investigate 
the impact of urbanization on air pol-
lution, we determined whether there 
was a correlation between the size of 
the urban population and the propor-
tion of days in 2014 during which the 
concentration of specific contaminants 
exceeded WHO guideline values. 
For this analysis, cities were divided 
into five groups by population size, 
according to China’s new urban size 
standard:12 (i) less than 0.5 million; 
(ii) 0.5 to less than 1 million; (iii) 1 to 
less than 5 million; (iv) 5 to less than 
10 million; and (v) 10 million or more. 
The correlation between the population 
size and the percentage of days in 2014 
with a high level of multicontaminant 
air pollution was determined using 
nonlinear regression analysis.
Results
In total, 56 of the 155 cities analysed 
(36%) were exposed to mean annual 
concentrations of the contaminants 
PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 above WHO 
guideline values (Fig. 1). These cities 
had a combined population of 142 mil-
lion out of a total study population of 
276 million (i.e. 51%). In addition, all 
155 cities were exposed to high annual 
concentrations of two-contaminant 
mixtures of PM2.5 and PM10 and 56 cit-
ies, with a total population of 142 mil-
lion, were exposed to high annual 
concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 and 
of PM10 and NO2. The cities with high 
annual multicontaminant exposure 
to either (i) PM2.5, PM10 and NO2; 
(ii) PM2.5 and NO2; or (iii) PM10 and 
NO2 were mainly located in east China, 
specifically in Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, 
Shandong and Zhejiang Provinces and 
in the megacities of Beijing, Guang-
zhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin (Fig. 2).
Daily multicontaminant exposure
Only two cities, Dongying and Linyi 
in Shandong Province, had mean daily 
concentrations of all five contaminants 
(i.e. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and NO2) 
above WHO guideline values for 11–15 
days (3–4%) in 2014 (Fig. 3). Weifang 
and Zibo in Shandong Province were 
exposed to high daily concentrations 
of the five contaminants for 8–11 days 
(2–3%) in the year. Jining in Shandong 
Province, Wuhan in Hubei Province 
and Jiayuguan and Jinchang in Gansu 
Province were exposed to high daily 
concentrations for 4–8 days (1–2%; 
Fig. 4). Other cities had less than 4 days 
(1%) with high concentrations of all 
five contaminants.
Exposure to high mean daily con-
centrations of four contaminants was 
more common. In some locations, daily 
concentrations exceeded WHO guide-
line values for 73–110 days (20–30%)

in 2014 for PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3 
(Fig. 5) and for PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and 
SO2. The cities with the highest fre-
quencies of exposure to high daily 
concentrations of the four contaminants 
PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3 were located 
in Shandong Province (Fig. 6; available 
at: http://www.who.int/bulletin/vol-
umes/96/4/17-195560), whereas those 
with the highest frequencies of exposure 
to high daily concentrations of the four 
contaminants PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and 
SO2 were mainly located in Hebei and 
Shandong Provinces. High daily concen-
trations of other four-contaminant mix-
tures were rare: high daily concentrations 
of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 (Fig. 7 and 
Fig. 8; both available at: http://www.who.
int/bulletin/volumes/96/4/17-195560), 
of PM2.5, O3, NO2 and SO2 and of PM10, 
O3, NO2 and SO2 were observed on less 
than 18 days (5%) in 2014 in most major 
Chinese cities.
Exposure to high mean daily con-
centrations of the three contaminants 
PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 was even more 
common: 110 cities with a total popu-
lation of 173 million were exposed to 
this level of air pollution for more than 
146 days (40%) in 2014 (Fig. 9). Those 
cities were mainly located in east and 
central China, particularly in Hebei, 
Henan, Shandong and Shanxi Provinces 
(Fig. 10). In addition, exposure to high 
daily concentrations of mixtures of the 
following three-contaminant combina-
tions were observed on 18–146 days

Population size
In general, daily multicontaminant air 
pollution was less frequent in cities 
with a population greater than 10 mil-
lion than in smaller cities in our study. 
For example, the proportion of days 
in 2014 during which the mean daily 
concentrations of all five contaminants 
exceeded WHO guideline values was 
not significantly affected by population 
size in cities with fewer than 10 million 
inhabitants but the portion was sub-
stantially lower in cities with a popula-
tion greater than 10 million (Fig. 17). 
Similarly, the frequency of exposure to 
high mean daily concentrations of four 
contaminants was comparable among 
cities with populations ranging from 
0.5 to 10 million but was lower in cities 
with a population less than 0.5 million 
or greater than 10 million (Fig. 18). 
This variation was also observed for 
high mean daily concentrations of 
three contaminants: the frequency was 
similar in cities with populations rang-
ing from 0.5 to 10 million but lower 
in those with a population less than 
0.5 million or greater than 10 million 
(Fig. 19). For exposure to high daily

there was no substantial variation in 
frequency among cities with a popula-
tion less than 10 million, whereas the 
frequency was markedly lower in cities 
with a population greater than 10 mil-
lion (Fig. 20). There was a significant 
inverse U-shaped relationship between 
the size of the urban population and the 
observed frequency of high mean daily 
concentrations of four contaminants 
(Fig. 18). In addition, there were in-
verse U-shaped relationships between 
population size and the frequency of 
high mean daily concentrations of three 
and two contaminants but the relation-
ships were weaker (Fig. 19 and Fig. 20).
Discussion
Although our study was based on data 
for only one year, it provides a snapshot 
of air pollution in major Chinese cities 
and demonstrates that multicontami-
nant air pollution was very common 
in 2014. These findings underscore the 
need to assess multiple air contaminant 
concentrations at the same time to ob-
tain a more realistic picture of urban air 
quality and its potential impact on pub-
lic health. Consequently, a change in air 
quality guidelines is required, with the 
establishment of guidelines on multi-
contaminant mixtures. The globally 
recognized, ambient air quality guide-
lines produced by WHO were designed 
to help reduce the health effects of air 
pollution in 1987. They were based on 
a review of the scientific evidence and 
its implications. The guidelines, which 
were updated in 1997 and 2005, now 
specify daily and annual limits for five 
major ambient air contaminants. In 
addition, some regions and countries 
have established their own air quality 
standards. For instance, the European 
Union, Japan and the United States of 
America were quick to update their 
air quality guidelines, whereas some

Multicontaminant air pollution in China
Lijian Han et al.
middle- and low-income countries, 
e.g. China, established their own 
standards in response to high levels of 
pollution. However, all these guidelines 
and standards treat each contaminant 
in isolation or choose a single major 
contaminant as an indicator of air 
quality. For example, China uses an air 
quality index based on the maximum 
value of each individual contaminant’s 
concentration to indicate air quality.13
Multicontaminant ambient air 
pollution is also important for public 
health research at both the urban and 
regional level. In the past, very little at-
tention has been paid to multicontami-
nant exposure and research efforts have 
primarily focused on the health effects 
of individual contaminants. Initially, 
the reason for this focus was the dif-
ficulty of evaluating the medical effects 
of exposure to several contaminants. In 
addition, there was little understand-
ing that multicontaminant ambient air 
pollution is common.5 However, with-
out detailed research into the medical 
consequences of multicontaminant 
exposure, the disease burden will be 
underestimated. The influential Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2013 consid-
ered both ambient and household air 
pollution.14 Still, the only ambient air 
contaminants included were particulate 
matter and ozone, no consideration 
was given to other contaminants. We 
recommend that research into air pol-
lution and its health effects should pay 
more attention to multicontaminant 
ambient air pollution, especially in 
middle- and low-income counties 
where current pollution levels are often 
higher than in high-income countries. 
In particular, by devoting attention to 
multicontaminant mixtures, research-
ers could raise public awareness of the 
complex nature of ambient air quality 
and stimulate greater interest in air 
pollution prevention.
As a result of rapid urbanization 
during the last century, more than half 
of the world’s population now lives in 
cities.15 This rise in the urban popula-
tion and the associated intensification 
of social and economic activity have 
had a substantial impact on urban air 
quality. Thus, urbanization and its ef-
fect on air quality are among the most 
important issues for achieving sustain-
able urban and regional development. 
Researchers have studied the relation-
ship between urbanization and typical 
air contaminants in both developed and 
developing countries.9,16 For example, 
the concentration of the traditional air 
contaminant NO2 has been observed to 
increase exponentially with population 
size, though the value of the exponent 
varies between locations.16 In contrast, 
for PM2.5, the relationship between its

concentration and urban population 
size is much more variable across con-
tinents and countries.9 In our study, we 
found an inverse U-shaped relationship 
between urban population size and 
the frequency of high daily concentra-
tions of three contaminants, whereas 
other researchers have demonstrated 
no clear relationship. Furthermore, 
we discovered that a high level of mul-
ticontaminant air pollution was less 
common in cities with a population of 
more than 10 million than in smaller 
cities, which is contrary to general 
expectations that larger cities would be 
more polluted. The likely explanation 
is that large cities have implemented 
extensive environmental protection 
measures and that many polluting in-
dustries have been relocated to smaller 
cities.3 This observation casts new light 
on multicontaminant air pollution and 
its relationship to urbanization. We 
suggest that future research should 
pay more attention to the process of 
urbanization and its impact on mul-
ticontaminant ambient air pollution, 
particularly in middle- and low-income 
countries. Our findings highlight the 
varied pattern of multicontaminant air 
pollution in Chinese cities and confirm 
the view that pollution in developing 
countries should be expected to vary 
greatly across both time and space. 
Consequently, the results of this re-
search should be relevant not only to 
China but also to other middle- and 
low-income countries facing similar 
challenges with multicontaminant air 
pollution. ■

Résumé
Pollution de l’air par plusieurs contaminants dans les villes chinoises
Objectif Étudier la pollution de l’air par plusieurs contaminants dans 
les villes chinoises, quantifier la population urbaine touchée, et analyser 
la relation entre la pollution de l’air et la taille de la population urbaine.
Méthodes Nous avons recueilli des données auprès du réseau de 
surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Chine sur les concentrations 
de matières particulaires fines mesurant moins de 2,5 μm (PM2.5), 
de matières particulaires grossières mesurant de 2,5 à 10 μm (PM10), 
de dioxyde d’azote (NO2), de dioxyde de soufre (SO2) et d’ozone (O3) 
dans 155 villes comptant un total de 276 millions d’habitants pour 
l’année 2014. Les concentrations étaient considérées comme élevées 
lorsqu’elles dépassaient les limites indicatives fixées par l’Organisation 
mondiale de la Santé.
Résultats En tout, 51% (142 millions) de la population étudiée a 
été exposée à des concentrations annuelles moyennes de plusieurs 
contaminants supérieures aux limites définies par l’OMS, l’est de la Chine 
et les mégalopoles étant les plus touchés. En 2014, des concentrations 
quotidiennes élevées de mélanges de quatre contaminants – PM2.5, 
PM10, SO2 et O3, et PM2.5, PM10, SO2 et NO2 – ont été mesurées pendant 
110 jours dans de nombreuses villes principalement situées dans les 
provinces du Shandong et du Hebei. Des concentrations quotidiennes 
élevées de PM2.5, PM10 et SO2 ont été mesurées pendant 146 jours dans 
110 villes principalement situées à l’est et au centre de la Chine. Des 
concentrations quotidiennes élevées de mélanges de PM2.5 et PM10, 
PM2.5 et SO2, et PM10 et SO2 ont été mesurées pendant 146 jours dans 
145 villes principalement situées à l’est de la Chine. Étonnamment, la 
pollution de l’air par plusieurs contaminants était moins fréquente dans 
les villes comptant plus de 10 millions d’habitants que dans les villes 
de plus petite taille.
Conclusion La pollution de l’air par plusieurs contaminants s’est 
révélée courante dans les villes chinoises. Les évaluations des effets de 
la pollution de l’air sur la santé ne doivent plus tenir compte d’un seul 
contaminant, mais de plusieurs contaminants. Il est essentiel que la 
Chine mette en application des mesures de protection dans le cadre 
de l’urbanisation à venir.
Резюме
Многокомпонентное загрязнение воздуха в городах Китая
Цель Изучить многокомпонентное загрязнение воздуха в 
городах Китая, дать количественную оценку доли городского 
населения, находящегося под воздействием загрязненного 
воздуха, и изучить взаимосвязь между загрязнением воздуха и 
численностью городского населения.
Методы Мы получили данные 155 городов с 276 миллионами 
жителей за 2014 год из сети мониторинга качества воздуха в 
Китае по концентрациям тонкодисперсных частиц размером 
менее 2,5 μм (ТЧ2,5), крупнодисперсных частиц размером от 2,5 до 
10 μм (ТЧ10), двуокиси азота (NO2), диоксида серы (SO2) и озона (O3). 
Концентрации считались высокими, если они превышали 
предельные величины, рекомендуемые Всемирной организацией 
здравоохранения (ВОЗ).
Результаты В целом 51% исследуемой популяции (142 миллиона 
человек) подвергался воздействию среднегодовых концентраций 
многокомпонентных загрязнений, которые превышали

рекомендуемые ВОЗ пределы, — в наибольшей степени такому 
воздействию подверглись Восточный Китай и мегаполисы. В 
2014 году во многих городах, главным образом в провинциях 
Шаньдун и Хэбэй, до 110 дней наблюдались высокие 
среднесуточные уровни четырехкомпонентных смесей ТЧ2,5, 
ТЧ10, SO2 и O3 и ТЧ2,5, ТЧ10, SO2 и NO2. Высокий среднесуточный 
уровень ТЧ2,5, ТЧ10 и SO2 наблюдался в течение 146 дней в 
110 городах, главным образом в Восточном и Центральном 
Китае. Высокие среднесуточные уровни смесей ТЧ2,5 и ТЧ10, ТЧ2,5 
и SО2, ТЧ10 и SО2 наблюдались в течение 146 дней в 145 городах, 
главным образом в Восточном Китае. Неожиданным было то, что 
многокомпонентное загрязнение воздуха встречалось реже 
в городах с населением более 10 миллионов человек, чем в 
небольших городах.
Вывод Многокомпонентное загрязнение воздуха было 
распространено в городах Китая. При оценке воздействия 
загрязнения воздуха на здоровье необходим переход от 
однокомпонентного к многокомпонентному загрязнению. Китай 
должен принять защитные меры во время будущей урбанизации.
Resumen
Contaminación del aire con múltiples contaminantes en las ciudades chinas
Objetivo Investigar la contaminación atmosférica con múltiples 
contaminantes en las ciudades chinas, cuantificar la población urbana 
afectada y explorar la relación entre la contaminación del aire y el tamaño 
de la población urbana.
Métodos Se obtuvieron datos de 155 ciudades con 276 millones de 
habitantes de 2014 de la red de seguimiento de la calidad del aire de 
China sobre las concentraciones de partículas finas que miden menos 
de 2,5 μm (PM2,5), partículas gruesas que miden 2,5 a 10 μm (PM10), 
dióxido de nitrógeno (NO2), dióxido de azufre (SO2) y ozono (O3). Las 
concentraciones se consideraron altas si superaban los límites de las 
directrices de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).
Resultados En general, el 51% (142 millones) de la población del estudio 
estuvo expuesta a unas concentraciones de múltiples contaminantes 
medias anuales por encima de los límites de la OMS: el este de China y las 
megaciudades se vieron más afectadas. Hasta en 110 días en 2014, hubo 
altos niveles diarios de mezclas de cuatro contaminantes de PM2,5, PM10, 
SO2 y O3, y PM2,5, PM10, SO2 y NO2 en muchas ciudades, principalmente en 
las provincias de Shandong y Hebei. Hubo altos niveles diarios de PM2,5, 
PM10 y SO2 durante más de 146 días en 110 ciudades, principalmente 
en el este y el centro de China. Hubo altos niveles diarios de mezclas 
de PM2,5 y PM10, PM2,5 y SO2, y PM10 y SO2 durante más de 146 días en 
145 ciudades, principalmente en el este de China. Sorprendentemente, 
la contaminación del aire con múltiples contaminantes fué menos 
frecuente en las ciudades con poblaciones de más de 10 millones que 
en las ciudades más pequeñas.
Conclusión La contaminación del aire con múltiples contaminantes 
es habitual en las ciudades chinas. Se necesita un cambio en las 
evaluaciones de los efectos de la contaminación del aire en la salud 
de un solo contaminante a múltiples contaminantes. China debería 
implementar medidas de protección en futuras urbanizaciones.
