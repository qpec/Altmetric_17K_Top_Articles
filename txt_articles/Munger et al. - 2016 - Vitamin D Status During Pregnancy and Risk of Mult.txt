IMPORTANCE Vitamin D has been associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS)
in adulthood; however, some, but not all, previous studies have suggested that in utero
vitamin D exposure may be a risk factor for MS later in life.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in early
pregnancy are associated with risk of MS in offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, nested case-control study in the Finnish
Maternity Cohort conducted in May 2011. We identified 193 individuals with a diagnosis of MS
before December 31, 2009, whose mothers are in the Finnish Maternity Cohort and had an
available serum sample from the pregnancy with the affected child. We matched 176 cases
with 326 controls on region of birth in Finland, date of maternal serum sample collection,
date of mother’
s birth, and date of child’
s birth.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Maternal serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using a
chemiluminescence assay. The risk of MS among offspring and association with maternal
25(OH)D levels were the main outcomes. Conditional logistic regression was used and further
adjusted for sex of the child, gestational age at the time of sample collection, and season of
sample collection to estimate the relative risks and 95% CIs.
RESULTS Of the 193 cases in the study, 163 were female. Of the 331 controls in the study,
218 were female. Seventy percent of serum samples were collected during the first trimester
of pregnancy. The mean (SD) maternal vitamin D levels were in the insufficient vitamin D
range, but higher in maternal control than case samples (15.02 [6.41] ng/mL vs 13.86 [5.49]
ng/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496]). Maternal vitamin D deficiency
(25[OH]D levels <12.02 ng/mL) during early pregnancy was associated with a nearly 2-fold
increased risk of MS in the offspring (relative risk, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.20-3.01; P = .006)
compared with women who did not have deficient 25(OH)D levels. There was no statistically
significant association between the risk of MS and increasing serum 25(OH)D levels (P = .12).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Insufficient maternal 25(OH)D during pregnancy may
increase the risk of MS in offspring.

I
nadequate vitamin D nutrition has been identified as a risk
factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS),1 a progres-
sive, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous sys-
tem. Two previous prospective studies have found that el-
evated serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), a
marker of vitamin D nutrition, in healthy adults are associ-
ated with a decreased risk of MS,2,3 and another prospective
study among adult women4 found that higher dietary intake
of vitamin D was associated with lower MS risk. Whether this
inverse association extends to vitamin D exposure in early life
is not clear. Two Swedish prospective studies, one measuring
maternal25(OH)Dlevelsduringpregnancy3andtheothermea-
suring 25(OH)D levels in dried blood spots collected from
newborns,5 found no association with future MS risk in the
child, while a study of gestational dietary vitamin D intake in
US women found that higher intake was associated with a de-
creased risk of MS in the child.6 Additionally, the higher num-
ber of spring births observed among patients with MS7,8 has
been attributed to exposure to lower vitamin D in utero, al-
though other immune effects of sun exposure, seasonal in-
fections, or statistical artifact1,9 cannot be ruled out. Thus,
whether adequate maternal vitamin D levels during preg-
nancy are associated with risk of MS in the offspring remains
unclear.
We conducted a case-control study nested in the Finnish
Maternity Cohort (FMC) to examine whether maternal levels
of 25(OH)D during early pregnancy are associated with the risk
of MS in the offspring.
Methods
Study Population
TheFMCwasestablishedin1983andiscomposedofmorethan
800 000 women and more than 1.5 million serum samples10
that were collected during their pregnancies at approximately
10to14weeks’gestationforroutineprenataltests.Thesamples
were collected at municipal maternity care units and shipped
totheFinnishNationalInstituteforHealthandWelfareinOulu,
Finland, where they were processed and stored at −25°C.11 The
FMC includes samples from approximately 98% of all preg-
nancies in Finland since 1983. This study was approved by the
data protection authorities at the National Institute for Health
and Welfare, the Regional Ethics Committee of the Northern
Ostrobothnia Hospital District, and the Office of Human Re-
search Administration at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Pub-
lic Health. Since 2002, informed written consent has been ob-
tained from the mothers to store the samples for research
purposes; use of samples collected prior to 2002 for research
purposes is allowed under Finnish law.
MS Case Identification and Control Selection
We identified cases of MS occurring among children born to
women in the FMC between January 1, 1983, and December
31, 1991 (children who would be 18-27 years old by December
31, 2009), by searching the Finnish Hospital Discharge Regis-
ter for the diagnostic codes for MS and related diseases (Inter-
national Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
codes G35, G36, and H46, and International Statistical Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statisti-
cal Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision codes 340, 341,
367, and 377). This search was conducted in May 2011. The
FinnishHospitalDischargeRegisterincludesbothinpatientand
outpatient neurological visits. We also searched the registry
of the Social Insurance Institution to identify cases not in the
Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. The Social Insurance In-
stitution tracks medication reimbursement for disease-
modifyingtherapyandothertreatmentsforMS,includingglati-
ramer acetate, interferon β-1a, and interferon β-1b. Medical
records of the children with MS were reviewed when avail-
able and the diagnosis confirmed by the study neurologists
(M.S.-H., J.Å., K.H.). For cases that were identified through the
Social Insurance Institution, an abstract of the medical rec-
ord was obtained.
To identify the mothers of the individuals confirmed as
having MS, an overgeneration linkage step was done via the
Population Census Register. The mothers were then linked by
their personal identification number to the FMC database and
thepregnancywiththeaffectedchildwasidentified.Thechild/
mother pair was included if there was a serum sample avail-
able from this pregnancy.
Multiple sclerosis was confirmed, and a maternal preg-
nancy serum sample was available for 193 children (138 cases
of MS were confirmed by review of the medical record and 55
based on prescription of/reimbursement for MS disease-
modifying therapy). We were able to individually match 176
of these cases to 326 controls on region of birth in Finland
(south, southwest, southeast, middle, and north); date of ma-
ternal sample collection (±60 days); date of mother’
s birth
(±6 months); and date of child’
s birth (±2 months). There were
17 cases for whom an appropriate matched control could not
be found and an additional 5 controls that were selected, but
ultimately not matched.
Serum 25(OH)D Measurement
Maternal 25(OH)D levels were measured in the prenatal se-
rum sample taken from the mother during her pregnancy with
the affected child or matched control child using a chemilu-
minescence microparticle immunoassay and an Architect
i2000SR automatic analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics). Maternal 25
(OH)D levels exhibited the expected seasonal variation: sum-
mer, 17.67 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply
Key Points
Question: Is maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy
associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis in the offspring?
Findings: In this prospective, nested case-control study within the
Finnish Maternity Cohort, multiple sclerosis risk was 90% higher in
offspring of vitamin D–deficient mothers (25-hydroxyvitamin
D <12.02 ng/mL) compared with offspring of mothers who were
not vitamin D deficient, a statistically significant difference.
Meaning: This result supports a role of prenatal vitamin D in
determining multiple sclerosis risk and suggests that correction of
vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may reduce the risk of MS
in the offspring.

by 2.496); winter, 11.58 ng/mL; and spring/fall, 13.22 ng/mL,
with the latter seasons being statistically significantly lower
than summer levels (P < .001 for both). Coefficients of varia-
tion derived from repeated quality-control samples included
intheassaywiththestudysampleswerecalculated.Insamples
with high 25(OH)D levels (> 40.06 ng/mL), the coefficient of
variation was 3.5%; medium 25(OH)D levels (approxi-
mately 32.05ng/mL),1.8%;andlow25(OH)Dlevels(<16.03ng/
mL), 3.0%. In blinded quality-control pairs where 25(OH)D lev-
els were not known, the coefficient of variation was 1.1%.
Statistical Analysis
The 25(OH)D levels were modeled in 3 ways: (1) as a continu-
ous variable, (2) as quintiles based on the distribution of ma-
ternal 25(OH)D levels in the controls, and (3) as a priori cat-
egories consistent with deficient (<12.02ng/mL), insufficient
(12.02 to <20.03ng/mL), and sufficient (≥20.03 ng/mL) levels
per the Institute of Medicine’
s guidelines.12 To account for the
matched, nested, case-control design of the study, condi-
tional logistic regression was used in the main analysis to es-
timate the rate ratios and 95% CIs and included the 176 cases
with 326 matched controls. In addition to the matching fac-
tors, these analyses were further adjusted for sex of the child,
gestational age (in days, continuous) at sample collection, and
season (summer, winter, or spring/fall) of sample collection.
In secondary analyses, we also performed an unconditional lo-
gistic regression adjusting for all the matching factors in ad-
dition to those listed previously in all 193 cases and 331 con-
trols and stratified by sex of the child (female: 163 cases and
218 controls; male: 30 cases and 113 controls). A P value less
than .05 was considered statistically significant, and all analy-
ses were done using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Cases with MS and controls were similar with regard to moth-
er’
sage,gestationalage,andseasonatthetimeofserumsample
collection (Table). The young average age at MS diagnosis re-
flects the fact that the source population comprises only in-
dividuals born after 1983. Seventy percent of serum samples
were collected at or before 12 weeks’gestation and 99% prior
to 28 weeks. There were more women in the case group and
the mean (SD) age at MS diagnosis was 19.8 (3.2) years (Table).
Maternal 25(OH)D levels ranged from 3.50 ng/mL to 64.30 ng/
mL, with the average levels in the insufficient range of 25
(OH)D and slightly lower in case mothers than in mothers of
controls (Table). Only 2 cases with MS and 8 controls had ma-
ternal 25(OH)D levels of more than 30.05 ng/mL, and no MS
cases and only 1 control had maternal 25(OH)D levels of more
than 40.06 ng/mL. Mean 25(OH)D levels did not differ by tri-
mester of serum collection (first trimester, 14.66 ng/mL and
second trimester, 14.50 ng/mL). No cases and 2 controls had
a mother with an MS diagnosis.
In the matched analysis adjusted for sex, gestational age,
and season at time of sample collection, a 20.03-ng/mL in-
crease in maternal 25(OH)D level was associated with a non-
statistically significant 48% reduced risk of MS in the off-
spring (relative risk [RR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.22-1.19; P = .12).
Children of mothers with deficient levels of 25(OH)D during
their pregnancy had an increased risk of developing MS com-
pared with children born to mothers with nondeficient levels.
Specifically, maternal 25(OH)D levels of less than 12.62 ng/mL
(quintiles 1 and 2) were associated with a 20% to 90% in-
creased risk of MS among the offspring compared with mater-
nal 25(OH)D levels in the top quintile (median 25[OH]D, 22.52
ng/mL;Ptrend = .09)(Figure1).Similarly,inmultivariateanaly-
ses using a priori categories of 25(OH)D levels, clearly defi-
cient maternal 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy were associ-
atedwithanearly2-foldincreasedriskofMSinthechild(<12.02
ng/mL vs 12.02 to <20.03 ng/mL: RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.20-3.01;
P = .04) (Figure 2).
Similar, although slightly attenuated, results were ob-
tained in the unmatched analysis, with a 43% reduced risk of
MS associated with every 4.01-ng/mL increase in maternal 25

among male children was small.
Discussion
Inthislarge,prospective,nestedcase-controlstudyintheFMC,
childrenofwomenwhowerevitaminDdeficient(25[OH]Dlev-
els <12.02 ng/mL) early in their pregnancy had a 90% in-
creased risk of developing MS as an adult. Two prior studies
examining the association between 25(OH)D levels in preg-
nancy/early life did not find an association with future MS risk
in the offspring.3,5 However, there are important differences
and limitations to these studies that need to be considered. In
the Northern Sweden Maternity Cohort, Salzer et al3 con-
ducted a nested case-control study of primarily first trimes-
ter maternal 25(OH)D levels and risk of MS among the off-
spring; however, there were only 37 cases of MS among the
offspring and the association between maternal 25(OH)D level
and MS risk was fairly unstable, as evidenced by wide confi-
dence intervals of the risk estimate (RR of MS in 25[OH]D
≥30.05 ng/mL vs <30.05 ng/mL, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.53-5.8), mak-
ing interpretation, including conclusion of a true null associa-
tion, difficult. In a 2014 Swedish case-control study, Ueda et
al5 measured 25(OH)D levels in dried blood spots collected for
phenylketonuria screening from 459 cases with MS and 663
controls when they were newborns in 1975 or later. Overall,
there was no association between neonatal 25(OH)D levels and
risk of MS (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.90-1.06). However, there
was evidence of 25(OH)D degradation in the older dried blood
spot samples, which may have contributed to the null find-
ings, although no associations were seen when restricting to
morerecentsamplesinwhich25(OH)Ddegradationdidnotap-
peartooccur.Anotherimportantconcernisthatwithlowover-
all control participation in the study (44% of those eligible), it
is possible that the control participants did not provide an ac-
curate representation of the 25(OH)D exposure distribution in
the general population of newborns. Further, the levels of neo-
natal 25(OH)D in the Ueda et al5 study were primarily in the
deficientrange(median, 10.26ng/mL;interquartilerange,6.81-
15.38 ng/mL) making it difficult to detect any association with
25(OH)D deficiency and MS risk.13
The strengths of our study included the population-
based nature of the FMC (approximately 98% of pregnancies
inFinlandsince1983arecaptured).Thus,selectionbiasismini-
mized, given the extensive national coverage of the Finnish
Hospital Discharge Register and the Social Insurance Institu-
tion for MS case identification.
There are a few limitations of our study to consider. Ma-
ternal 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy are not a direct mea-
sure of the 25(OH)D levels that the developing fetus is ex-
posed to. However, several studies have shown that the levels
of serum 25(OH)D in neonates directly correlate with mater-
nal 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy or postpartum,14-16 with
strongercorrelationsforthelatter.Furthermore,studiesofbone
growth and development in the fetus17,18 find that maternal
vitaminDdeficiencyduringpregnancyisassociatedwithpoorer
bonehealthmarkersinthefetus.Collectively,thesestudiessug-
gest that the maternal 25(OH)D levels are an adequate proxy
for the 25(OH)D levels to which the fetus is exposed. Another
consideration is that most of the samples from the FMC (>70%)
were collected in the first trimester of pregnancy. Whether the
associationbetweenmaternalvitaminDdeficiencyandMSrisk
in the offspring is confined to the first trimester or whether
similar associations would be seen with maternal vitamin D
deficiency during the second or third trimesters cannot be di-
rectly assessed in our study, but it seems unlikely that many
deficient women became sufficient later in pregnancy be-
cause even 25(OH)D levels collected during summer months
were on average in the insufficient range (17.63 ng/mL). The av-
erage age at MS diagnosis was 19.8 years and the oldest age at
diagnosis was 27 years. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibil-
ity that the association between maternal 25(OH)D levels dur-
ing pregnancy and MS incidence decreases at older ages. We
also did not have information on other MS risk factors the off-
spring may have had, such as Epstein-Barr virus infection, high
body mass index in childhood/adolescence, cigarette smok-
ing, vitamin D status, or human leukocyte antigen DRB1*1501
status, and cannot rule out confounding by these factors. Fi-
nally, the increased MS risk among individuals born to vita-
min D–deficient mothers could be explained if these individu-
als had low circulating 25(OH)D levels during their childhood
andearlyadultlife.Apositivecorrelationbetweenmaternalvi-
tamin D status and the vitamin D status in her children would
be expected because of probable similarities in behavior (eg,
use of vitamin D supplements or sun protection) and shared
genes. Although it has been demonstrated in a mendelian ran-
domization study19 that individuals carrying alleles associ-
ated with lower 25(OH)D levels have an increased MS risk, a
result that supports a causal role of vitamin D in MS, the
genetic contribution in our study is likely to be small because

genetically determined variations in 25(OH)D level are mod-
est and only 50% of the maternal alleles are transmitted to the
offspring. On the other hand, behavioral factors are more dif-
ficult to quantify, and we cannot estimate to what extent the
effects of in utero exposure to vitamin D deficiency could be
mediated by 25(OH)D levels later in life.
While the range of maternal 25(OH)D spanned levels of de-
ficient to sufficiency, most women in our study had deficient
or insufficient levels (<20.03 ng/mL), and only 10 mothers had
levelsabove30.05ng/mL,1ofwhomhad25(OH)Dlevelsabove
40.06 ng/mL. Thus, while our results suggest that vitamin D
deficiency during pregnancy increases MS risk in the off-
spring, our study does not provide any information as to
whether there is a dose-response effect with increasing lev-
els of 25(OH)D sufficiency. Similar studies in populations with
a wider distribution of 25(OH)D are needed.
Conclusions
Correcting maternal vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy
may have a beneficial effect on risk of MS in the offspring.
