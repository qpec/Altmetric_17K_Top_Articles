Background. Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of deaths among children <5 years of age. Studies have sug-
gested that group B Streptococcus (GBS) maternal rectovaginal colonization during pregnancy may be a risk factor for preterm 
delivery. This article is the fifth of 11 in a series. We aimed to assess the association between GBS maternal colonization and preterm 
birth in order to inform estimates of the burden of GBS.
Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health 
Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpub-
lished data from investigator groups on the association of preterm birth (<37 weeks’ gestation) and maternal GBS colonization (GBS 
isolation from vaginal, cervical, and/or rectal swabs; with separate subanalysis on GBS bacteriuria). We did meta-analyses to derive 
pooled estimates of the risk and odds ratios (according to study design), with sensitivity analyses to investigate potential biases.
Results. We identified 45 studies for inclusion. We estimated the risk ratio (RR) for preterm birth with maternal GBS coloniza-
tion to be 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], .99–1.48; P = .061) in cohort and cross-sectional studies, and the odds ratio to be 1.85 
(95% CI, 1.24–2.77; P = .003) in case-control studies. Preterm birth was associated with GBS bacteriuria in cohort studies (RR, 1.98 
[95% CI, 1.45–2.69]; P < .001).
Conclusions. From this review, there is evidence to suggest that preterm birth is associated with maternal GBS colonization, 
especially where there is evidence of ascending infection (bacteriuria). Several biases reduce the chance of detecting an effect. Equally, 
however, results, including evidence for the association, may be due to confounding, which is rarely addressed in studies. Assessment 
of any effect on preterm delivery should be included in future maternal GBS vaccine trials.

There are approximately 15 million preterm (<37 weeks’ gesta-
tion) births worldwide in a year; an estimated 11% of all live births 
[1]. Complications of preterm birth are the most common direct 
cause of death in children <5 years of age, accounting for 15% of 
all child deaths and 35% of all neonatal deaths worldwide [2–4]. 
Preterm birth is also an indirect contributor in approximately 
half of all neonatal deaths, through interaction with other direct 
causes such as neonatal infection [1]. Beyond this, preterm birth 
can result in long-term disability among survivors, including 
neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders, visual and hearing 
impairment, motor disorders, risk of severe infections, and long-
term metabolic, cardiovascular, and mental health disorders [5].
Preterm birth is a risk factor for invasive bacterial disease, 
including group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) 
infections in the newborn [6–8]. However, evidence for the 
association between maternal colonization or infection and pre-
term birth, with bacteria such as GBS, is unclear [9, 10]. A pre-
vious systematic review investigating the association between

maternal GBS colonization and preterm birth demonstrated 
conflicting findings [11]. Associations were detected between 
maternal GBS colonization and preterm birth in cross-sectional 
and case-control studies, when cultures were performed at 
delivery, but not in longitudinal cohort studies, when cultures 
were performed earlier in pregnancy.
The putative mechanism for preterm birth from colonization 
and/or infection relates to specific changes in bacterial flora in 
the vagina and, in some cases, overgrowth that may increase the 
risk of ascending infection through the cervix, resulting in bacte-
rial infection of fetal membranes and decidua causing: (1) secre-
tion of proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix within the 
fetal membranes, and/or (2) a host inflammatory response with 
cytokine production, and stimulation of prostaglandin and pro-
tease synthesis, which increases uterine contractility and results 
in preterm delivery [9, 12, 13]. This is supported by recent work 
in animal models which shows that GBS produces extracellular 
membrane vesicles that, through certain virulence factors and 
toxins, lead to extraplacental membrane weakening, degradation 
of collagen, and preterm birth [14]. The authors also demon-
strated that the association with preterm birth was independent 
of having culture of GBS present in the amniotic fluid; that is, the 
extracellular membrane vesicles led to a “sterile intra-amniotic 
inflammation” that induced preterm birth [14].
This article assesses the risk of preterm birth associated with 
maternal GBS colonization (Figure 1) and is part of a supplement 
estimating the burden of GBS disease in pregnant women, still-
births, and infants, which is important in terms of public health 
policy, particularly vaccine development [15]. The supplement 
includes systematic reviews and meta-analyses on GBS coloni-
zation, and adverse outcomes associated with GBS around birth 
[16–23], which form input parameters used for estimates of the 
burden of GBS, partly through a compartmental model [24].
The specific objectives of this article are as follows:
1. To undertake a comprehensive and systematic literature 
review and meta-analyses to assess (i) the association 
between maternal GBS colonization and preterm birth, and 
(ii) the association between GBS isolated from urine or cho-
rioamnion cultures and preterm birth;
2. To assess these data to inform estimates (if appropriate) for 
the contribution of preterm birth to the total burden of GBS 
in pregnancy for women, stillbirths, and infants;
3. To evaluate the gaps in the data and recommend how to 
improve the data on the association between maternal GBS 
colonization and preterm birth.
METHODS
This article is part of a wider study protocol entitled “Systematic 
estimates of the burden of GBS worldwide in pregnant women, 
stillbirths and infants.” It was submitted for ethical approval to 
the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (reference 
citation 11966) and approved on 30 November 2016.
Definitions
Preterm delivery is defined as delivery prior to completion of 37 
weeks’ of gestation (measured by ultrasound, fundal height, or 
date of last menstrual period [LMP]). Preterm labor is defined 
as the occurrence of frequent uterine contractions (a specific 
number in a specific time period, eg, 1 every 5–8 minutes) plus 
cervical dilatation >1 cm and cervical effacement (≥50%) before 
37 weeks’ gestation (details of study characteristics are shown in 
Supplementary Materials).
Maternal GBS colonization was defined as GBS isolated from 
vaginal, cervical, and/or rectal swabs from pregnant women. 
Studies reporting maternal GBS isolation from urine or chorio-
amnion cultures were analyzed separately.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
We identified data through systematic review of the published 
literature and from an investigator group of clinicians, research-
ers, and relevant professional institutions worldwide. For this 
paper, we did systematic literature searches in Medline, Embase, 
Scopus, the World Health Organization Library Information 
System (WHOLIS), and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin 
America and the Caribbean (LILACS) from 20 to 25 October 
2016, and updated these on 6 February 2017. The search terms for 
preterm delivery were consistent with those used for estimating 
the burden of preterm birth [25], including variants of the terms 
“preterm birth,” “premature,” and “preterm labor,” and were com-
bined with search terms for “GBS” or “Streptococcus agalactiae.” 
Medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were used where possi-
ble. The full list of search terms is presented in Supplementary 
Table 1. The search was limited to humans and there were no lan-
guage or date restrictions. Case reports, case series, and reviews 
were excluded, as well as studies without an appropriate com-
parison group (studies that measured preterm delivery within a 
group of women in preterm labor) (Supplementary Table 2). We 
used snowball searches of article reference lists including reviews 
to identify additional studies.
One investigator performed the database search, screened 
for duplicates and screened titles for eligibility, and selected 
abstracts to assess their eligibility for inclusion. Two inde-
pendent investigators (F. B. J. and M. K. L.) assessed the 
full-length articles previously selected to determine their 
inclusion and extracted data. Where there was discrepancy 
between 2 reviewers, a third investigator (A. S.) made the 
final decision.
Studies were assessed for bias using specific criteria (study 
site, sampling and laboratory methods for GBS detection, and 
measurement of gestational age), and the effects of these criteria 
were investigated in sensitivity analyses.

Meta-analyses and Sensitivity Analyses
Data from each study were extracted into standard Excel forms 
and imported to Stata 14 software (StataCorp) for meta-anal-
yses. We used random-effects meta-analyses to estimate risk 
ratios and odds ratios using the DerSimonian and Laird method 
[26]. Meta-analyses were done for each study design (case-con-
trol, cross-sectional, and cohort). For cohort and cross-sectional 
studies, a pooled risk ratio was calculated, and for case-control 
studies a pooled odds ratio was calculated.
We did sensitivity analyses to see if there was misclassifica-
tion in the exposure or outcome resulting in bias. These were:
1. Exposure classification: reducing misclassification through 
increasing sensitivity of detection through sample site and labora-
tory method (rectovaginal sampling and broth enrichment) [16];
2. Exposure classification: to evaluate effect of using nonse-
lective laboratory methods and cervical and upper vaginal 
sampling, which could reflect detection of more heavily colo-
nized women;
3. Exposure classification: reducing misclassification through 
including only studies where mothers were reported to have 
not used antibiotics during pregnancy or at least 1 week 
before the culture sample was taken;
4. Exposure classification: timing of sample-taking, comparing 
samples which were taken in antenatal visits or at delivery;
5. Outcome classification: reducing misclassification by including 
only studies that described how gestational age (GA) was measured 
and if methods used were LMP
, fundal height, and/or ultrasound;
6. Outcome classification: reducing overestimation of effect if 
relationship is nonlinear by excluding different thresholds for 
the definition of preterm (or if definition not specified).
RESULTS
Study Selection
We identified 3617 records from databases of published lit-
erature; 1 unpublished dataset and 9 records were identified 
through snowball searches. After the selection process, 45 stud-
ies were included in this systematic review (Figure 2) (LeDoare, 
unpublished data) [27–70].
Study Characteristics
Most studies (33/45) were from developed countries, including 
8 from the United States, and 22 from Europe. There were fewer 
studies from low- and middle-income contexts (12/45), includ-
ing Africa (2), Middle-Eastern Asia (5), South-Eastern Asia 
(1), East Asia (3), and Latin America (1) (Figure 3) (LeDoare, 
unpublished data) [27, 31, 35, 41, 46, 48, 61–64, 68]. Of all 
studies, there were 11 case-control studies, 31 cohort studies 
(8 of which were retrospective cohorts), and 6 cross-sectional

studies. Sometimes studies included >1 study design and we 
included the results for each in the appropriate meta-analysis 
[36, 46]. From these, 2 case-control studies and 9 cohort studies 
were included in the separate subanalysis on GBS bacteriuria.
In terms of the exposure, the prevalence of maternal 
GBS colonization reported in studies ranged from 1.4% to 
48.4% (median, 12.5%), and the prevalence of preterm birth 
 
ranged from 1.8% to 46.7% (median, 9.1%). Further details of 
the included studies are shown in Supplementary Table 3.
Meta-analyses and Sensitivity Analyses
There was some evidence of an association between maternal GBS col-
onization and preterm birth in cohort and cross-sectional studies (risk 
ratio [RR], 1.21 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .99–1.48]; P = .061)

and in case-control studies (odds ratio [OR], 1.85 [95% CI, 1.24–2.77]; 
P = .003) (Figure 4). For the studies that used urine samples or other 
sources to identify patients as GBS carriers, there was strong evidence 
that maternal GBS bacteriuria was associated with preterm birth 
(RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.45–2.69], P < .001, n = 9; and OR, 1.97 [95% CI, 
.65–5.98], P = .232, n = 2, for cohort studies compared with case-con-
trol studies, respectively) (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).
The results for all sensitivity analyses are detailed in Table 1 
and summarized below.
1. Exposure classification (sampling and laboratory fac-
tors): lower point estimate for cohort and cross-sectional 
studies using rectovaginal sampling and nonselective 
media excluded. For case-control studies, no evidence 
of an association was found, in contrast to the initial 
analysis. However, as only 3 studies were included in 
this analysis, this result may be due to reduced power to 
detect the association (Table 1; Supplementary Figures 3 
and 4).

2. Exposure classification (women with heavy colonization): 
Cohort studies using nonselective medium and sampling 
from the cervix or upper vagina (only to detect more heavily 
colonized women) showed a strong association with preterm 
delivery. Likewise, there was a strong evidence of association in 
case-control studies (Table 1; Supplementary Figures 5 and 6).
3. Exposure classification (prior antibiotic use): higher point 
estimate in both cohort and case-control studies, but no evi-
dence of association in cohort studies that excluded women 
using antibiotics. Only 4 cohort studies were included in 
sensitivity analysis, reducing the power to detect the associa-
tion (Table 1; Supplementary Figures 7 and 8).
4. Exposure classification (sample timing): The point estimate 
was higher when samples were taken during delivery/labor 
(RR, 1.43 [95% CI, .97– 2.11]), than when taken in ante-
natal visits (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, .85–1.68]), but confidence 
intervals were overlapping for both estimates (Table 1 and 
Figure 4).
5. Outcome classification (GA): Point estimates were simi-
lar to initial analysis, in studies that measured GA by LMP,

ultrasound, and/or fundal height. In case-control studies, 
where there might be recruitment bias toward more preterm 
babies included in the studies, there was still evidence of an 
association (OR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.15–2.99]; P = .011) (Table 1; 
Supplementary Figures 9 and 10).
6. Outcome classification (preterm definition): No changes in the 
association were observed when studies with different thresh-
olds for the definition of preterm were excluded in the sensitiv-
ity analysis (Table 1; Supplementary Figures 11 and 12).
DISCUSSION
There is some evidence, from this comprehensive review, that GBS 
is associated with preterm birth. There is a consistent increase in 
risk of preterm birth in women with maternal GBS colonization, 
which is stronger in case-control studies compared to cohort or 
cross-sectional studies. In addition, where there is evidence of 
ascending infection with maternal GBS bacteriuria, the associ-
ation with preterm birth is stronger, which is biologically plau-
sible. Our findings are potentially important, and we have made 
extensive attempts to consider study design and address specific 
biases, learning from challenges in previous reviews. However, 
considerable limitations remain, and these results could still be 
affected by bias or confounding, as discussed below.
In terms of the data included, we are limited in terms of geo-
graphical distribution, with most data from high-income con-
texts, and the potential sources of bias we were able to assess 
based on reported sampling strategies, microbiological meth-
ods, and gestational age measurement.
Our sensitivity analyses are specifically aimed to address 
misclassification, but the reduction in power through exclusion 
of studies likely limited the ability to detect true association. 
Interestingly, however, in terms of sensitivity of exposure, it 
may actually be easier to detect an association when less sen-
sitive sampling methods are used. Rectovaginal sampling and 
broth enrichment increase sensitivity of detection [71] in 40% 
and 90%, respectively [16], but excluding less sensitive methods 
did not identify an association. Conversely, using nonselective 
medium and sampling from the cervix or upper vagina (less 
sensitive methods that would detect more heavily colonized 
women), showed a strong association with preterm delivery 
(RR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.03–2.64]) for cohort and cross-sectional 
studies. This is consistent with studies reporting associations 
in women considered heavily colonized [60] and the associa-
tion we identified between maternal bacteriuria (which reflects 
denser colonization) and ascending infection, which was more 
strongly associated with preterm birth.
Our sensitivity analysis suggested that antibiotic use near or 
at delivery may also affect findings, and could bias the results 
toward the null if women with complications are given anti-
biotics and GBS is thus not detected. In future studies it will 
be important to take into account the receipt and timing of 
antibiotics in pregnancy. In terms of the timing of the sample, 
earlier sampling may increase misclassification due to reac-
quisition of bacteria, so repeated sampling through pregnancy 
could be important to test the association.
In terms of outcome measurement, uncertainty in gesta-
tional age dating will increase misclassification. This may be 
nondifferential in cohort and cross-sectional studies, which 
would bias findings toward the null, but may be differential 
in case-control studies, with recruitment bias toward more 
preterm babies included in the study and thus overestimation 
of the effect. This may account for the differences in findings 
and some uncertainty in both. Another study found no differ-
ences in the effect estimates for GBS colonization and prema-
ture delivery when measured by ultrasound or by date of LMP 
[37], but due to the small number of studies here we could not 
compare results according to the method used for gestational 
age dating. We note that the inconsistencies in GA assessment 
would be even more marked in data from middle-income and 
especially low-income contexts, where GA measurement is 
challenging; usually using fundal height and sometimes LMP. 
Given that three-quarters of preterm births are in sub-Saharan 
Africa and South Asia, more data, with consistent GA, are cru-
cial for future studies [72].
The results presented here may, however, be subject to con-
founding (due to factors associated with both maternal GBS 
colonization and preterm birth). This could change the effect 
in either direction. Adjustment for confounding factors has 
increased the effect size in several studies [27, 29, 35, 36, 62], 
but this may be context specific [16]. It is important that con-
founding factors are considered, including known risk factors 
for preterm birth such as low socioeconomic status, black race, 
low body mass index, previous preterm birth, multiple gesta-
tion, short interpregnancy interval, and the use of tobacco or 
illicit drugs [9], and risk factors for GBS colonization such as 
age at pregnancy, interpregnancy interval, previous abortions, 
and level of education [73, 74]. These should be incorporated 
into multivariable modeling strategies.
To better answer this important research question, more 
data are needed with optimized and standardized methodol-
ogies reported systematically, particularly from low- and mid-
dle-income contexts [75]. The optimal study design would be 
a large, longitudinal prospective study including multiple sites, 
with accurate exposure and outcome measurement, and repeat 
sampling at intervals in pregnancy. This should include meas-
urement of gestational age, preferably based on first-trimester 
ultrasound, samples taken from rectovaginal swabs and isolated 
in selective enrichment broth (ideally with quantification of 
GBS colonization), adjustment for use of antibiotics (including 
timing of receipt of antibiotics during pregnancy), and meas-
urement and adjustment of known risk factors for both preterm 
delivery and GBS colonization. However, this is challenging to 
achieve in health systems in low- and middle-income contexts

where resources are limited. An alternative approach would be 
an intervention vaccine-probe study, which would overcome 
the problems of bias and confounding and could be done as part 
of a maternal GBS vaccine study.
CONCLUSIONS
We found some evidence of an association between mater-
nal GBS colonization and preterm birth. Misclassification is 
likely to reduce the effect size of risk and/or odds ratios, so this 
may be underestimated. However, results may also be subject 
to confounding, which could influence the findings in either 
direction. Current prevention strategies (based on intrapartum 
antibiotic prophylaxis) are too late to prevent preterm birth 
associated with GBS colonization. A future maternal GBS vac-
cine targeted against maternal GBS colonization or the mech-
anism downstream of colonization leading to preterm birth, 
and administered during the appropriate timing of pregnancy, 
could be useful and should be included in any maternal GBS 
vaccine trial (Table 2).

Notes
Author contributions. The concept of the estimates and the technical 
oversight of the series were led by J. E. L. and A. C. S.; F. B. J. performed the 
database searches, removed duplicates, and screened titles and abstracts for 
eligibility; M. K. L. and F. B. J. read the full texts, confirmed suitability for 
inclusion, and extracted data; data analyses were undertaken by F. B. J. and 
A. C. S.; the first draft of the manuscript and reviews were undertaken by 
F. B. J., A. C. S., J. E. L., and C. E. R; K. L. D. provided input data for the anal-
yses. The GBS Estimates Expert Advisory Group (C. J. B., L. B., C. C., M. G. 
G., P. T. H., M. I., K. L. D., S. A. M., S. K. S., S. S., A. S.-t. M., J. V.) contributed 
to the conceptual process throughout, notably on the disease schema and 
data inputs. All the authors reviewed and provided input to the manuscript.

Table 2. Key Findings and Implications
What’s new about this?
• This systematic review is the most comprehensive review to date evaluating the association between GBS maternal colonization and preterm delivery, and 
includes results from 45 studies, split by study design, and 6 sensitivity analyses to assess biases.
What was the main finding?
• There is some evidence to suggest that GBS maternal colonization is associated with preterm birth, with cohort/cross-sectional studies suggesting a 20% 
increased risk and case-control studies an 80% increased risk. Evidence of ascending infection (bacteriuria) carries a higher risk of preterm delivery.
How can the data be improved?
• Most of the biases assessed (such as detection of maternal GBS colonization), are likely to bias to the null. However, some biases (eg, recruitment bias for 
case-control studies), may bias results and overestimate the effect size. Confounding could increase or decrease the effect size, and this may vary in differ-
ent contexts. Large longitudinal prospective studies that address these biases, confounding, and with accurate exposure and outcome measurement are 
needed, especially in low- and middle-income contexts.
What does it mean for policy and programs?
• Maternal GBS vaccine could reduce preterm birth if associated with maternal GBS colonization, and a vaccine probe study could provide a more definitive 
answer to this research question.
