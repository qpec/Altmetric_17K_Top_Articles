Background: Although music therapy (MT) is considered an effective intervention for young people with mental health
needs, its efficacy in clinical settings is unclear. We therefore examined the efficacy of MT in clinical practice. Methods:
Two hundred and fifty-one child (8–16 years, with social, emotional, behavioural and developmental difficulties) and
parent dyads from six Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service community care facilities in Northern Ireland were
randomised to 12 weekly sessions of MT plus usual care [n = 123; 76 in final analyses] or usual care alone [n = 128; 105
in final analyses]. Follow-up occurred at 13 weeks and 26 weeks postrandomisation. Primary outcome was
improvement in communication (Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales) (SSIS) at 13 weeks. Secondary
outcomes included social functioning, self-esteem, depression and family functioning. Results: There was no
significant difference for the child SSIS at week 13 (adjusted difference in mean 2.4; 95% CI �1.2 to 6.1; p = .19) or
for the guardian SSIS (0.5; 95% CI �2.9 to 3.8; p = .78). However, for participants aged 13 and over in the intervention
group, the child SSIS communication was significantly improved (6.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.5; p = .007) but not the guardian
SSIS (1.1; 95% CI �2.9 to 5.2; p = .59). Overall, self-esteem was significantly improved and depression scores were
significantly lower at week 13. There was no significant difference in family or social functioning at week 13.
Conclusions: While the findings provide some evidence for the integration of music therapy into clinical practice,
differences relating to subgroups and secondary outcomes indicate the need for further study. ISRCTN Register;

Introduction
Mental ill health affects up to 20% of children and
adolescents worldwide (World Health Organization,
2001). The range of mental disorders affecting our
children and adolescents encompasses social, emo-
tional, cognitive and behaviour problems (Gold,
Voracek, & Wigram, 2004), with many presenting
comorbid disorders. These difficulties can impair
young people and their families on a daily basis, and
have significant effects well into adulthood. However,
despite these negative consequences, there remains
a gap between the mental health needs of young
people and the available resources to treat them
(Belfer, 2008). Moreover, the evidence base for effec-
tive treatments is incomplete and inconsistent (Het-
rick, McKenzie, Cox, Simmons, & Merry, 2012). One
of the main difficulties in addressing these issues is
the complexity and heterogeneity of mental disor-
ders.
Current figures suggest that 2.6% of young people
worldwide suffer from depression; often associated
with impaired social functioning and education
attainment (Polanczyk, Salum, Sugaya, & Rohde,
2015). US figures estimate that 20% adolescents will
experience
a
depressive
episode
by
the
age
of
18 years, whereas in Australia, up to 25% are
reported to have experienced a clinically significant
depressive episode by the same age (Corrieri et al.,
2013).
Adolescent depression and anxiety frequently co-
occur (Angold, Costello, & Erkanli, 1999). Adoles-
cents may be particularly vulnerable to developing
anxiety-related disorders (Angold et al., 1999), given
the
significant
physiological,
psychological
and
social changes and transitions they go through
(Higgins et al., 2012). Anxiety disorders are esti-
mated to affect up to 20% (Costello, Egger, & Angold,
2005). Effects often extend into adulthood and can
impair social, familial and academic functioning
(Ginsburg, Drake, Tein, Teetsel, & Riddle, 2015).
Despite what is known about the prevalence and
effects of mental health problems in adolescence and
the far reaching implications for adulthood, the
evidence base for effective interventions is relatively
weak. Currently, the most common approaches to
treatment are medication and psychotherapy, both
of which have an insufficient evidence base for use
with children and adolescents (Hazell, O’Connell,
Heathcote, & Henry, 2002). Studies have shown

 positive effects for psychotherapy in general but have
not established which type is most effective (NICE,
2005). Additionally, much of the research focuses on
an adult population, presenting difficulties when
extrapolating to young people (Hetrick et al., 2012).
There is also conflicting evidence around the use of
antidepressants for this population, in particular
concerns about the risks of adverse effects (Karanges
& McGregor, 2011). Given the high prevalence rates
of these conditions, and their lasting impact on
social functioning and educational achievement, the
development
of
cost-effective
interventions
is
urgently indicated.
One intervention which is becoming increasingly
recognised is music therapy (MT) (NICE, 2013). In
MT, the therapist uses musical experiences and the
patient/therapist
relationship
to
achieve
health
goals for the patient (Bruscia, 1998). Current evi-
dence suggests that MT has a medium to large effect
on
behaviour
and
general
development
(Gold,
Wigram, & Voracek, 2007); however, authors have
questioned whether this effect can be attained in
everyday clinical practice (Gold et al., 2007). Results
also suggest that MT employing improvisational
techniques is more successful than other less speci-
fic techniques (Gold et al., 2007).
Reviews of the evidence suggest that MT may
improve mental health in children and adolescents
and communication in children with autistic spec-
trum disorder (Gold et al., 2004; Whipple, 2004).
However, the evidence base is weak, consisting
mainly of small, methodologically problematic stud-
ies (Porter et al., 2012). Because of the lack of
unequivocal evidence, there is an urgent need for
methodologically robust clinical trials to evaluate MT
in diverse settings with a representative population
presenting with complex and comorbid disorders.
Methods
Design and participants
This was a multicentre single-blind randomised controlled
trial. When randomised, data collection took place at baseline,
1 week after the final MT session (week 13), and at 13 weeks
after the final MT session and end of trial (week 26). A total of
251 young people were recruited and randomised from six
community care Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services
(CAMHS) within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust in
Northern Ireland. Participant age ranged from 8 years to
16 years old. A higher proportion of young people were aged
over 13 (59%) and female (56%), and the overall population was
primarily White (97%). The sample was representative of the
population of children and adolescents that routinely present
to clinical services. Thus, there was a diverse range of
diagnoses to include social, emotional, behavioural and devel-
opmental disorders, with participants included if they had a
working diagnosis within the ambit of ICD-10 of Mental and
Behavioural Disorders (F00-F99), as assessed by the CAMHS
professional in charge of their care: 53% had a diagnosis which
included anxiety [agoraphobia, social phobias, specific (iso-
lated) phobias, other phobic anxiety disorders, phobic anxiety
disorder, unspecified], 37% had a diagnosis which included
depression (depressive reaction, psychogenic depression and
reactive
depression),
while
19%
had
a
diagnosis
which
included autism (childhood autism, atypical autism, Rett
syndrome, other childhood disintegrative disorder, overactive
disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped
movements, Asperger syndrome, other pervasive developmen-
tal disorders, pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified).
Young people who had chronic and severe substance abuse,
psychosis, repeated suicidal behaviour, or who were unable to
complete self-administered questionnaires with assistance, or
to attend MT sessions were excluded from the study. The
sample was also economically diverse with 31% of participants
being from most deprived and 26% from least deprived areas
(Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure). About 41% of
participants were from single parent families, and 32% were
from families where neither parent was employed. In accor-
dance with CONSORT guidelines (Schulz, Altman, & Moher,
2010), Figure 1 shows the progression of participants through
the trial.
Procedure
Full details of this study can be found in the published protocol
(Porter et al., 2012). After obtaining informed consent, data
were collected at the participants’ home by an independent
researcher. Appropriate randomisation and blinding protocols
were adhered to. The Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit
(NICTU) randomised participants; the randomisation list was
computer-generated with random variable block lengths and
stratified by recruiting centre. Due of the nature of the
intervention, both the music therapist and the research
participants involved were aware of whether or not the inter-
vention had been administered. However, the participants and
the professionals involved in their care were asked not to
disclose this to the researcher/outcome assessor.
Intervention
Participants assigned to the control group received usual care
only, which consisted of psychiatric counselling and/or med-
ication, the dose and frequency of which was as deemed
appropriate by the prescribing CAMHS professional. In addi-
tion to usual care, patients assigned to the experimental group
received the Alvin model of ‘Free Improvisation’ (Bruscia,
1987). Improvisation encourages the patient to create music
and sound freely through voice, instrument or movement,
while receiving support and encouragement tailored to suit
their needs as assessed by their therapist. This technique is
deemed particularly useful to those who struggle with com-
munication and interpersonal skills, as these are the basic
requirements for improvisation (Wigram, 2004). Instruments
such as the guitar, xylophone, keyboard and drums were used,
and patients had the opportunity to make personalised CDs.
Sessions were delivered individually, face-to-face in a pri-
vate room provided by the CAMHS. A total of 12 weekly
sessions, lasting 30 min were offered. In line with the inten-
tion-to-treat principle, patients who attended fewer sessions
were not excluded from data analysis. Each participant
received three assessment sessions before treatment aims
were discussed and established with the music therapist. All
MT sessions were led by the participant who was invited to
choose an instrument to express how they were feeling that day
and the previous week. All sessions ended with a verbal or
musical reflection on the session and a plan made for the
following week.

 delivered the intervention to all participants. While this may be
considered a limitation, it can also ensure consistency of
delivery. The therapist had over 5 years postgraduate experi-
ence working with a wide and varied client group including
children and young people with social, emotional and beha-
vioural difficulties.
All of the MT sessions were unique and client led, using the
Alvin model of MT (Bruscia, 1987) to guide the delivery of the
intervention. Ongoing monitoring and supervision by the
Clinical Services Director ensured adherence to the model
manual and theoretical fidelity (Borelli, 2011). Additional
supervision included peer supervision and external supervi-
sion by a Professor of MT; all of which are particularly useful
when ensuring treatment fidelity (Borelli, 2011) and quality of
delivery (Carroll et al., 2007). For ethical reasons, it was
deemed inappropriate to directly observe the delivery of
sessions; however, these were regularly videotaped and mon-
itored by the Clinical Services Director to ensure adherence to
the model.
Measures
The primary outcome was communicative and interactional
skills, as measured by parental and self-reporting of the Social
Skills Improvement System Rating Scales (SSIS, Gresham &
Elliott, 2008) at week 13. The secondary outcomes included
communicative and interactional skills at week 26, self-esteem
(measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Rosenberg,
1965) and depressive symptoms [measured using the Centre
for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children
(CES-DC, Weissman, Orvaschel, & Padian, 1980)] completed
by the young person, social functioning measured using the
Child Behaviour Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), and
family functioning assessed using the Family Assessment
Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983), completed by a
parent.
Ethics approval was granted by the Office of Research Ethics
in Northern Ireland (10/NIR01/52). This study is registered in
the ISRCTN Register, ISRCTN96352204, http://isrctn.org.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 99 patients completing the trial in each group
was estimated to have an 80% power to detect a mean
difference of 0.4 SDs in the two groups at the 5% significance
level for the primary outcome, as previously outlined in the
study protocol (Porter et al., 2012). To allow for a dropout rate
of 20%, 251 children and young people were recruited to the
study. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat
basis. Hence, all participants with outcome data were included
in the analysis irrespective of compliance. All statistical tests
were at the two-sided p-value of .05.
The difference in mean SSIS at week 13 was compared
between the intervention and control group while adjusting for
baseline SSIS using analysis of covariance (Vickers & Altman,
2001). Specifically, a multiple linear regression model was
applied with SSIS at week 13 as the dependent variable, and
SSIS at baseline and a group variable (denoting intervention or
control group) as explanatory variables. The adjusted differ-
ence in mean between groups (95% CIs) and two-sided p-value
was derived from this model. An adjusted analysis was also
conducted including in the regression model potential con-
founders such as social deprivation score, age at randomisa-
tion and study site. An effect size was calculated by dividing
the adjusted difference in mean by the standard deviation of
the outcome at baseline in the usual care group. Social
deprivation was measured using the Northern Ireland Multiple
Deprivation Measure, developed by the Northern Ireland
Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA, 2010). This is a
measure of deprivation based on an individual’s Super Output
Area level, as derived from the postcode, which uses a
combination of domains to determine a weighted single score.
The domains relate to income, employment, health and
disability, education, skills and training, proximity to services,
living environment and crime and disorder. Scores can then be
divided into quintiles of 1–5, with 1 representing the most
deprived quintile (NISRA, 2010).
A secondary analysis was conducted repeating this analysis
at week 26. Similar analyses were conducted for secondary
outcomes including measures of self-esteem, social function-
ing, family functioning and depression. Residuals from regres-
sion models were checked against assumptions of multiple
linear regression models. Prespecified subgroup analyses for
the primary endpoints were carried out according to: age at
randomisation (<13, ≥13), a diagnosis which included autism,
and a diagnosis which included anxiety and/or depression.
Baseline characteristics were compared between patients
who were included in the main analysis and those who had
missing values. For the primary outcome (SSIS), two additional
sensitivity analyses were conducted to adjust for missing data
at week 13. First, as recommended for missing outcome data
when a baseline is available (Groenwold, Donders, Roes,
Harrell, & Moons, 2012), a covariate adjusted complete case
analysis was conducted with variables included in the model
(specifically baseline score, age, gender, study site, ethnicity,
social deprivation score, single parent family, employment
status of mother/father, autism, anxiety or depression), which
could be associated with outcome or probability of missingness.
Second, a multiple imputation was conducted. A regression
model was used to impute SSIS at week 13 with explanatory
variables including baseline score, age, gender, study site,
ethnicity, social deprivation score, single parent family, employ-
ment status of mother/father, autism, anxiety or depression
and stratified by treatment group (a separate model adjusting
for treatment group gave similar results, not shown). Ten
imputations were conducted and results were combined using
Rubin’s rules (implemented in STATA using the mi command).
Results
Three hundred and forty-two children and young
people were referred by health care practitioners to
the trial team for screening. Two hundred and fifty one
were recruited and randomised to the trial between
March 2011 and May 2014. Table S1 shows the trial
profile. Loss to follow-up for the MT group was 47/123
(38%) and 25/128 (18%) in the usual care group, with
76 and 105 participants included in the final analysis
from the MT and usual care groups respectively. In
line with the intention-to-treat principle, all partici-
pants with primary outcome data were included in the
final analysis regardless of compliance. At week 26,
loss to follow-up for the MT group was 9/76 (12%) and
15/105 (14%) in the usual care group (including
seven with baseline and week 13 data only), with 68
and 96 participants included in the final analysis from
the MT and usual care groups respectively. Of the 123
participants assigned to the MT group, 12% (15) did
not
attend
their
first
appointment,
88%
(108)
attended 10–12 sessions, with all of these attending
their final session, 44% (54) attended all 12 sessions,
14% (17) attended 11 sessions, and 30% (37) attended
10 sessions (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics for the study population
were similar in both the control and intervention
group demonstrating a robust randomisation process.

 Baseline results from measurement tools are also
highlighted in Table S1, detailing mean scores for all
participants randomised. One hundred and eighty one
children and young people of the 251 randomised were
included in the final analysis based on the availability
of primary outcome data.
Table 1 shows the results of the primary outcome.
Although an improvement in communication and
interaction skills was observed for the intervention
group, this did not reach statistical significance for
the child SSIS (adjusted difference in mean 2.4; 95%
CI �1.2 to 6.1; p = .19) or for the guardian SSIS
(difference in mean 0.5; �2.9 to 3.8; p = .78).
Baseline characteristics were compared between
patients who were randomised and included in the
main analysis of child SSIS and those not included
due to missing values, see Table S2. In general,
characteristics of included patients were similar to
those not included. In particular, the mean baseline
child SSIS was similar in those included and not
included in both the intervention (90.0 vs. 87.1
respectively; p = .48) and control groups (89.9 vs.
85.6 respectively; p = .17). However, there was evi-
dence of a greater proportion of missing values in
males in the intervention group (36% of included
patients were male vs. 60% of those not included;
p = .01) and a lower proportion of missing values in
patients with depression in the usual care group
(40% of included patients had depression vs. 17% of
those not included; p = .04).
The main finding for the child SSIS (adjusted
difference in mean 2.4, 95% CI �1.2, 6.1) was little
altered in sensitivity analysis adjusting for missing
data based upon covariate adjusted complete case
analysis (2.5, 95% CI �1.3, 6.3) or multiple imputa-
tion (2.8, 95% CI �1.6, 7.2). The main finding for the
parent SSIS (adjusted difference in mean 0.5, 95% CI
�2.9, 3.8) was little altered in sensitivity analysis
adjusting for missing data based upon covariate
adjusted complete case analysis (0.3, 95% CI �3.1,
3.8) or multiple imputation (1.1, 95% CI �3.1, 5.2).
Table 2 shows results for the primary outcome

A small but clinically significant effect was noted
for improved communication and interaction skills
for those young people aged 13 and over in the
intervention group, as compared to the control group
(adjusted difference in mean 6.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.5;
p = .007). No significant difference was noted for
those children aged under 13 between the groups.

and

tively). A slight difference was noted in the magni-
tude of the effect for depression after removal of a
large outlier; adjusted difference in mean �4.6 (95%
CI �7.9 to 1.3; p = .006). There was no significant
difference in social functioning or family functioning
between the treatment groups.
Table S4 shows results for participants at week 26.
Overall, there was little evidence of a difference in
communication and interaction skills for the child
SSIS (adjusted difference in mean 3.9; 95% CI �0.6
to 8.4; p = .09) or the guardian SSIS. Social func-
tioning was significantly improved in the interven-
tion group when compared to the usual care group
(adjusted difference in mean �7.4 (95% CI �14.4 to
�0.4; p = .04). However, after removal of a large
outlier, the adjusted difference in mean for Social
Functioning attenuated to �6.3 (95% CI �12.9 to
�0.3; p = .06). There was no significant difference in
family functioning between the treatment groups,
and significant improvements in self-esteem and
depression were not sustained for the intervention
group at week 26.
Discussion
In terms of the primary outcome of this study, MT
was not shown to improve the communication and
interaction skills of all respondents, as determined
by self-report and by parental report 1 week follow-
ing intervention. However, an improvement in self-
reported communication and interaction skills was
observed for those aged over 13, a predefined sub-
group, indicative of a small but clinically significant
effect of MT among this subgroup. This improvement
is notable in the light of the previous dearth of strong
evidence of improved communication among adoles-
cents receiving MT (Geretsegger, Elefant, Mossler, &
Gold, 2014). Taking into account the important
socioeconomic and interpersonal implications of
improvement in communication skills during this
pivotal
period
of
personal
development
(James,
2007), this finding provides a promising indication
of the potential of MT for troubled adolescents, and
indicates the merit of further evaluation focussed on
the effectiveness of MT in improving the interactive
skills of this age-group. Global concerns about the
lack of effective interventions to improve the mental
health of adolescents (Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, &
McGorry, 2007) make this recommendation all the
more pressing.
In terms of secondary outcomes, the self-reported
improvement
in
communication
and
interactive
skills in adolescents was not shown to be sustained
in the longer term, indicating that further research
into the optimal duration of MT is required to shed
light on long-term benefits. There was a small but
significant improvement in self-esteem and depres-
sion for all children and young people receiving MT
compared to the control group on completion of
therapy, but once again, this was not sustained at
week 26. Notwithstanding this apparent wash out of
effect over time, the modest short-term improve-
ments should be regarded in the light of the signif-
icant impact that low self-esteem has on levels of

 depression irrespective of gender and age (Frieder-
ike-Sowislo & Ulrich, 2013). Our findings suggest
MT’s effectiveness in increasing self-esteem and thus
potentially reducing depression among this popula-
tion in the short term warrants further exploration to
ascertain whether alternative modularities of MT
have the potential for increasing the duration of
effect.
Conversely, while MT had no effect on social
functioning in the short term, we did observe a small
effect in the long term, but this was attenuated after
the removal of a marked outlier. No improvement in
family functioning was observed at either time point.
However, a smaller number of parents completed the
measure in comparison to the others, probably as
the result of order effects; as this measure was
presented last.
Limitations
While recruitment targets were met (Porter et al.,
2014), the higher dropout rate of 38% in the
intervention group compared to the rate of 18% in
the control group raises questions in relation to the
acceptability of MT as a treatment option for this
population. However, given that 32 young people
attended 10–12 sessions but did not attend primary
outcome data collection sessions, despite consider-
able efforts to improve attendance at study visits
without
coercion
(Porter
et al.,
2014),
suggests
apathy to the research rather than low adherence
to therapy. One possible explanation is substantive
anecdotal
parental
reports
of
improvements
in
some children and young people who attended
MT, and as a consequence parents not wanting to
subject them to further questionnaires relating to
mental health issues. Furthermore, MT appears to
have been well received when viewed in comparison
to other interventions where the DNA (Did Not
Attend) rate was high (The Regulation and Quality
Improvement Authority, 2011). High attrition rates
have been also been reported as problematic in
RCTs of other therapies such as Cognitive Beha-
vioural
Therapy
and
Psychodynamic
Therapies
(Fonagy et al., 2015). The high attrition rate in the
treatment arm of this trial may have led to an
underestimation of the effectiveness of MT for those
who received it but did not consent to follow-up
assessment.
Second, we cannot rule out that the beneficial
effects observed were at least partially caused by the
care and attention given by the therapist, and not
exclusively the result of factors specific to MT.
However, because therapeutic intervention is an
active component of MT, the inclusion of a nonmu-
sical interactive control would have been inappro-
priate (Bruscia, 1998).
Third, the inclusion criterion of children with
mental
and
behavioural
disorders
categorised
between F00 and F99 of the ICD-10 classification
was wide, and meant that the study was unable to
ascertain the effectiveness of MT in treating children
with specific diagnoses within that range. The wide
inclusion criterion reflected the pragmatic design of
the trial, which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of
MT on the population likely to present itself to
clinicians providing specialist services, who rou-
tinely prescribe treatment on the basis of a working,
rather than definitive diagnosis. However, the results
indicate that there is a need for further studies
targeted at specific disorders.
Fourthly, outcome measures were all based solely
on parent and patient report. Given that parents and
patients were not blind to study condition, some
other form of outcome (behavioural observations by
a clinician) would have helped strengthen the study,
and we strongly recommend this be considered for
future research. Finally, the high rate of missing
data at week 26 introduces a weakness and we
caution the interpretation of the analysis at this later
time point.
Notwithstanding these issues, this study is the
largest completed randomised controlled trial to date
to test the effectiveness of MT on the communicative
skills of children and adolescents with social, emo-
tional and behavioural difficulties. There have been
several systematic reviews investigating the evidence
of the efficacy of MT for young people who are
experiencing social, emotional and behavioural dif-
ficulties relating to pervasive developmental disor-
ders such as autistic spectrum disorder.
The most recent Cochrane Collaboration review
(Geretsegger et al., 2014) suggested MT may improve
communication in children with autistic spectrum
disorder. This study does not add significant evi-
dence in relation to autistic spectrum disorder
because the number of participants suffering from
autism was not great enough to enable sufficiently
powered statistical analysis.
Our sample was made up of around 40% of single
parents. This suggests that social, emotional and
behavioural problems may be more prevalent among
this population; an assumption which is supported
by the research literature (Murphy & Fonagy, 2012).
Furthermore, interventions aimed solely at young
people may be limited. It has been suggested that
interventions provided simultaneously for both child
and parent are ultimately the best idea given the
environmental/wider influences on young people’s
mental health (Green, McGinnity, Meltzer, Ford, &
Goodman, 2005). Further MT research addressing
this ‘at risk’ group and involving parents is war-
ranted.
An earlier meta-analysis on the effects of MT on
children
and
adolescents
with
psychopathology
(Gold et al., 2004) showed a highly significant,
medium to large effect on clinically relevant out-
comes. However, it did not measure effectiveness in
routine clinical practice. A subsequent quasi-experi-
mental study conducted with a similar age range of

 participants to our study, using a similar type of MT
intervention in clinical settings only indicated effec-
tiveness for patients without comorbid conditions
(Gold et al., 2007). Our findings provide modest
evidence that MT may also be effective with children
suffering from comorbid conditions in routine clin-
ical settings.
Conclusion
Two of four major objectives set out in the current
WHO Mental Health Action Plan are the implemen-
tation of strategies for promoting mental health in
young people, and the need for research to provide a
stronger evidence base (World Health Organization,
2013). The plan promotes the provision of early,
community-based interventions such as psychoso-
cial and nonpharmacological approaches to avoid
medicalisation and institutionalisation.
This
study,
through
its
identification
of
an
improved clinical effect in self-reported communica-
tive and interactive skills of adolescents, and an
improvement for both children and adolescents in
levels of depression and self-esteem in the short
term, provides evidence of the potential of MT to
contribute to these strategies. However, because the
improvements identified tended to be modest and
short-lasting, recommendations for the inclusion of
MT in the clinical armamentarium for the treatment
of children with behavioural, developmental and
emotional disorders can only be suggestive, rather
than definitive. Nonetheless, the results of this
pragmatic trial strongly indicate the need for further
research to ascertain what type and dosage of MT is
most effective, and also for whom, and in what
circumstances.

Key points
• Research suggests music therapy (MT) may improve mental health disorders in children and adolescents but
the studies have been small and methodologically weak.
• At this early stage of building up an evidence base for the use of MT as an adjunct to CAMHS interventions for
young people and their families, results of our study suggest that MT may improve self-reported

 communicative and interactive skills of adolescents, and improve levels of depression and self-esteem for both
children and adolescents in the short term.
• Definitive answers as to the effectiveness of MT may have been hindered by high attrition to follow-up
assessment. Future research into how to overcome high attrition rates in studies of the effectiveness of
therapies for young people with mental health problems is warranted.
• Poor treatment compliance has been reported for young people with mental health problems. However, MT
appeared to be a highly acceptable adjunct treatment to usual care indicating it is a clinically attractive
treatment option.
