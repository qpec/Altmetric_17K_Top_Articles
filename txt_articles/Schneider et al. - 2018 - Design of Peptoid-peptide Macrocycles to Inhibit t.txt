New chemical inhibitors of protein–protein interactions are needed to propel advances in
molecular pharmacology. Peptoids are peptidomimetic oligomers with the capability to inhibit
protein-protein interactions by mimicking protein secondary structure motifs. Here we report
the in silico design of a macrocycle primarily composed of peptoid subunits that targets the
β-catenin:TCF interaction. The β-catenin:TCF interaction plays a critical role in the Wnt
signaling pathway which is over-activated in multiple cancers, including prostate cancer.
Using the Rosetta suite of protein design algorithms, we evaluate how different macrocycle
structures can bind a pocket on β-catenin that associates with TCF. The in silico designed
macrocycles are screened in vitro using luciferase reporters to identify promising compounds.
The most active macrocycle inhibits both Wnt and AR-signaling in prostate cancer cell lines,
and markedly diminishes their proliferation. In vivo potential is demonstrated through a
zebrafish model, in which Wnt signaling is potently inhibited.

 P
rotein–protein interactions (PPIs) provide the structural
and functional basis for many critical biological processes.
Extensive efforts have been made to identify small mole-
cules or peptides capable of inhibiting particular PPIs that play a
role in the pathogenesis of disease1–3. Despite these important
advances, additional design strategies are urgently needed. Small
molecules
may
lack
sufficient
surface
area
to
abrogate
protein–protein binding effectively, as these interfaces are typi-
cally broad and flat2. In addition, peptides often lack desirable
pharmacological characteristics and are readily susceptible to
degradation in vivo. These shortcomings can potentially be
addressed by development of peptidomimetic oligomers that
exhibit steric and chemical complementarity with protein sur-
faces4–6. Such molecules may populate an attractive middle
ground between small molecules and biomacromolecular ther-
apeutics. Crafting peptidomimetics suitable for targeting PPIs is a
formidable and intriguing challenge. However, specific binding
will require conformationally ordered oligomers that present
diverse chemical groups in a predictable orientation.
Foldamers are sequence-specific oligomers that can mimic a
range of biomolecular secondary structure motifs7. One particu-
larly promising class of foldamers is peptoids, which are com-
posed of sequences of N-substituted glycine monomer units.
Although peptoids are oligo-amides, like native peptides, the side
chains are presented from the backbone amide nitrogens instead
of the α-carbons. This backbone modification confers peptoids
with a broad resistance to proteolytic cleavage8,9. Peptoid
synthesis efficiently employs the use of myriad primary amines as
submonomer reagents, leading to rapid solid-phase generation of
oligomers that exhibit extraordinary chemical diversity and tun-
able physicochemical properties10,11. These synthetic and struc-
tural features endow peptoids with the capability to satisfy the
physicochemical
requirements
for
a
variety
of
biomedical
applications.
Initially, attempts to establish conformational order for pep-
toids proved challenging, due to the lack of backbone hydrogen
bonding, along with facile isomerization about the peptide
backbone amide ω dihedral angle12,13. Strategies have now been
identified to direct the organization of linear peptoid secondary
structures, such as inclusion of bulky branched residue types14–16.
Head-to-tail macro-cyclization can further rigidify peptoids in a
β-hairpin conformation and can enhance biological activity17–19.
Additional structural motifs can be attained in hybrid oligomer
systems upon incorporation of α-amino acid residues20. This
study evaluates the potential for peptoid-containing macrocycles
to address outstanding challenges in molecular pharmacology,
including targets that are currently considered undruggable.
The ability to employ computational design algorithms that
can reliably identify particular foldamer sequences capable of
binding a specific protein surface would provide a significant
advance in targeting PPIs relevant to a wide array of disease
states. Computational and experimental studies have demon-
strated that there are discrete low energy conformations for cyclic
peptides which are highly amenable to computational predic-
tion21–23. Recent advances have elaborated protein design tools,
such as the Rosetta molecular design suite to allow the modeling,
docking, and sequence optimization of both peptide and pepti-
domimetic macrocyclic systems19,23.
Among men, prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of
cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related
death24. While patients with localized disease have a positive
prognosis, those with metastatic disease have a 5 year survival rate
of 30%. The main therapeutic target in prostate cancer is the
androgen receptor (AR). Unfortunately, most patients treated
with anti-androgens will develop resistance and continued disease
progression, a state known as metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC). Second generation anti-androgens,
including Enzalutamide and Abiraterone, have been developed
but extend life expectancy on average less than 6 months, as
resistance can continue to develop25,26. There are multiple
mechanisms of resistance, such as gene amplification or alter-
native splicing of the AR27. Additionally, the activation of aux-
iliary
pathways
can
be
oncogenic
and/or
upregulate
AR
signaling28. For instance, the AR gene is under transcriptional
control of the Wnt signaling pathway29,30. The central Wnt
regulator, β-catenin, can also interact with the AR and act as a co-
activator30,31.
Recent genome-wide sequencing studies found the Wnt sig-
naling pathway to be mutated in upwards of 20% of tumors from
patients with mCRPC, making it one of the most mutated
pathways after AR, P53, and PTEN32,33. The most common Wnt
mutations found were in APC or the phosphorylation domain of
β-catenin, both of which cause the constitutive stabilization of β-
catenin34,35. Following its stabilization, β-catenin translocates to
the nucleus where it binds the T-cell factor (TCF) family of
transcription factors. This causes a conformational change in TCF
that activates transcription of a set of genes involved in cell
proliferation and differentiation. β-catenin interacts with most of
its binding partners including TCF, APC, Axin, E-cadherin, and
the AR through its alpha-helical armadillo domain31,36. While the
protein contacts partially overlap, there are distinct differences
that can potentially enable specific inhibition of one PPI without
affecting others. For example, a co-crystal structure of β-catenin
and TCF shows there is a unique β-hairpin loop motif in TCF
that binds to a cleft in the β-catenin armadillo domain37.
Previously
efforts
have
targeted
the
β-catenin:TCF
interaction38,39. High-throughput screening has identified mul-
tiple classes of small-molecule β-catenin:TCF inhibitors40–43.
These screens use either cell based luciferase assays or assays that
monitor
β-catenin:TCF
interactions.
Small-molecule
virtual
screening has also been used to identify inhibitors44,45. Some
rational design techniques have been implemented that focused
on modifying large peptide fragments associated with TCF’s β-
catenin binding domain in order to enhance their stability46–48.
Nevertheless, there is still a need to establish a robust rational
design strategy for discovery of β-catenin:TCF interaction inhi-
bitors with promising pharmacological properties that can be
advanced beyond pre-clinical testing.
In this study we apply computational protein design protocols
to design macrocyclic peptoid–peptide hybrids to target the N-
terminal TCF β-hairpin binding pocket of β-catenin and
demonstrate its potential for use as a therapeutic in prostate
cancer models. Using the Rosetta suite of computational tools, we
first generate a small library of peptoid–peptide macrocycles
designed in silico that are predicted to bind β-catenin. We use cell
culture based luciferase assays to test the oligomers and select a
promising compound. We show that the compound potently
inhibits binding between β-catenin and TCF proteins. It also
inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells with nano-molar
IC50 values in both 2D and 3D cell culture models. In addition,
we demonstrate that the peptoid macrocycle inhibits Wnt sig-
naling in vivo through a zebrafish model.
Results
Design of oligomer macrocycles to bind β-catenin. We identi-
fied a cleft on the surface of β-catenin created by armadillo
repeats 8, 9, and 10 (Fig. 1) which was suitable for targeting with a
cyclic oligomer. This region includes the binding site between β-
catenin and the N-terminal sequence of Xenopus laevis TCF3,
which forms a β-hairpin structure at the site of interaction in the
X-ray structure (PDBid: 1G3J)37. The β-catenin binding domain

 of xTCF3 aligns very closely with the sequence of human TCF4
(Supplementary Fig. 1). This cleft is also adjacent to the
G13ANDE17 region of the hTCF4 β-catenin binding sequence
which had been mimicked in previous attempts to inhibit the β-
catenin:TCF4 interaction48,49.
We applied rational design techniques to target the xTCF3 β-
hairpin binding pocket of β-catenin. In order to identify suitable
oligomer
scaffolds,
we
evaluated
high-resolution
structures

amino
acid

macrocyclic
structures17,50.
One
cyclic
hexamer peptoid-α-amino acid hybrid (18-atom macrocycle
Compound 1, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1)
was observed to provide a favorable steric complement to the
targeted β-catenin cleft after modeling with the Rosetta molecular
design suite51. The in silico ΔGbinding values were evaluated after
several iterations of guided (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System, Schrödinger, LLC) and automated docking protocols
utilizing Rosetta’s InterfaceAnalyzer52,53.
Inspection of the X-ray structure of 1 suggested that the D-
Alanine and “N-Smpe” residues played a critical role in directing
the overall fold of the oligomer. We hypothesize these bulky
α-chiral peptoid side chains and a D-amino acid confer a unique
structure to the oligomer backbone (Fig. 2a, positions colored
green and black, respectively). In contrast, positions R1, R2, and
R3 appeared relatively amenable for substitution to optimize
complementarity to the protein surface. After thorough analysis
of 1 docked into the β-catenin X-ray structure (Supplementary
Fig. 3), we selected a set of side chain types at each of the

 designable positions based on a combination of visual inspection,
modeling, aqueous solubility, and synthetic feasibility, as well as
properties considered favorable for cell-permeability. A table of
the shape complementarity and in silico ΔGbinding for each of the
designs is provided in Supplementary Table 2.
Compound testing and identification of a promising com-
pound. Using a TOP-Flash Wnt luciferase reporter, we tested the
12 oligomers identified from in silico modeling for inhibitory
activity (Fig. 2b). At 10 µM concentration, all compounds had
some level of Wnt inhibitory activity, with varying degrees of
efficacy. We also employed a 3 × -Androgen Response Element
(ARE) luciferase reporter to measure the effect on AR activity.
Only a few of the compounds were effective at inhibiting AR
signaling, the best of which were also the most effective at
inhibiting Wnt signaling. Based on the inhibitory data from other
compounds containing similar side chain types, we reasoned that
if we generated a macrocycle with the “N-ipp” side chain in
position R3 and the “N-mpp” side chain in position R1 (Fig. 2a),
we could create a more potent compound. An optimal sequence
composed of these monomer types resulted in compound 13.
This compound was in fact more effective at inhibiting both the
Wnt and AR luciferase reporters. A comparison of the luciferase
activity inhibition and the calculated ΔGbinding values for each
compound yielded a correlation R2 of 0.68 (Supplementary
Fig. 4). As additional controls, we obtained previously developed,
commercially available Wnt inhibitors and tested them in the
Wnt luciferase assay (Supplementary Fig. 5). Inhibitors upstream
of β-catenin (porcupine and tankyrase) had no effect, while those
targeting β-catenin/TCF (iCRT3, LF3) or β-catenin/CBP (PRI-
724) did inhibit the luciferase reporter although with a weaker
potency than compound 13.
Macrocycle 13 inhibits Wnt and AR signaling. We next char-
acterized the dose response curves for compound 13 in the Wnt
and AR luciferase reporters. The linear version of 13 (linear 13:
NH2-|N-mpp, N-dmp, N-ipp, N-Smpe, N-Smpe, D-Ala|-OH) was
used as a control compound. It incorporates the identical che-
mical moieties as its cyclic counterpart, but is likely not con-
strained in an optimal binding conformation and was therefore
anticipated to demonstrate weaker affinity. Indeed, as observed in
luciferase assays (Fig. 2c), the IC50 for Wnt luciferase inhibition
was 0.105 µM ± 0.040 (±standard deviation of three replicates) for
13 compared to 3.27 µM ± 0.99 for the linear oligomer. Com-
pound 13 also showed better inhibition of the AR luciferase
reporter (IC50 of 1.02 µM ± 0.20) compared to linear 13 (IC50 of
7.63 µM ± 1.22). While these values may suggest that the com-
pounds inhibit Wnt signaling with increased potency relative to
the AR pathway, the experimental conditions used with each
reporter, including siRNA knockdown of APC to activate the
Wnt reporter and DHT treatment to activate AR signaling,
confound direct comparison of the values. To confirm that 13
does inhibit the β-catenin:TCF protein interaction, we developed
a sandwich ELISA that detected recombinant β-catenin binding
to a GST fusion protein containing the TCF4 N-terminal
β-catenin binding domain (Fig. 3a). In this assay, 13 inhibited
binding with an IC50 of 5.44 µM±0.82 (Fig. 3b). To test direct
binding, we pre-formed dynamic light scattering (DLS) with
β-catenin in the presence of vehicle, compound 13, and
α-cyclodextrin. A significant shift in the measured hydrodynamic
radius was detected with the addition of compound 13, indicative
of a conformational change associated with a binding event
(Fig. 3c). Addition of a similarly sized macrocyclic compound, α-
cyclodextrin, was evaluated as a negative control and did not
cause the same shift (additional DLS data presented in Supple-
mental Table 3). Inhibition of the β-catenin:TCF4 protein

 interaction was also confirmed in cell culture. HEK293 cells
were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing full
length, myc-tagged TCF4. After 48 h treatment with either vehicle
(DMSO) or 10 µM 13, cells were lysed and myc-TCF4 protein
was immunoprecipitated. Western blotting was performed,
revealing that endogenous β-catenin was co-immunoprecipitated.
The β-catenin:TCF association was decreased in cells treated with
13 compared to vehicle treated cells (Fig. 3d).
Macrocycle 13 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth. To test the
effect of 13 in a model of prostate cancer, we used the LNCaP-abl
and LNCaP-95 cell lines. These cell lines were derived from
androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, and passaged in androgen-
deprived media to mimic the development of castration resistance
in patient tumors54,55. We first isolated mRNA from LNCaP-abl
and LNCaP-95 cells treated with vehicle, 10 µM 13 and linear 13
for 24 h to check the expression of endogenous Wnt and AR
target genes (Fig. 4a). The mRNA of Wnt target genes cMYC,
Cyclin D1, and the AR were all decreased. Transcription of
E-cadherin, which has been found to be repressed by Wnt sig-
naling, increased following treatment by 13. AR target genes
PSA and FKBP5 mRNA were also decreased. In addition, the
transcription of an AR splice variant, AR-V7, which lacks the
ligand binding domain and as a consequence is constitutively
active, was also decreased. AR-V7 is particularly challenging to
target as most AR antagonists target the ligand binding domain.
Similar to experiments discussed above, 13 again showed
increased potency in transcriptional modulation compared to its
linear analog. To check if the changes in Wnt and AR target gene
expression translated into effects on growth, the viability of
LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-95 cells was determined after 5 days of
treatment (Fig. 4b). Compound 13 inhibited proliferation with an
IC50 of 195 nM ± 52 (LNCaP-abl) and 782 nM ± 34 (LNCaP-95).
We also tested compound 13 in non-prostate cell lines that have
been shown to be Wnt independent (Fig. 4c)46,47. Compound 13
had no effect on the proliferation of U2OS (osteosarcoma) and
A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) cells.
Growth of prostate cancer spheroids slowed by macrocycle 13.
To evaluate the impact of the compounds under 3D cell culture
conditions thought to be more representative of tumors, we
grew LNCaP-abl cells in low attachment plates. The effects on
spheroid formation and growth were evaluated following treat-
ment with vehicle, 13, or linear 13 administered at the time of
seeding at low cell density in a 384-well plate. In a separate
experiment, to test the impact on pre-formed spheroids, cells
were treated 5 days after initial seeding. Spheroids from both
experiments were grown for 22 days, with compound refreshed
on days 5, 9, 13, 16, and 20. Figure 5a shows representative
images of cells treated with vehicle, 2 µM 13, or 2 µM linear 13
at 20 days. PrestoBlue was used to measure cell viability on
day 22 (Fig. 5b). Compound 13 reduced spheroid proliferation
with an IC50 of 0.694 µM ± 0.037 when added in the initial
seeding (Day 0). It also reduced spheroid proliferation when

 added on day 5, with somewhat lower potency and efficacy and
an IC50 of 1.34 µM ± 0.11. Figure 5c–f depicts spheroid area over
time based on size measurements from the images taken
throughout the experiment. Higher concentrations of 13 (20 µM,
10 µM, 5 µM, 2 µM, and 1 µM) prevented spheroid formation
when added on day 0 with seeding and 0.5 µM 13 also slowed
growth (Fig. 5c). Concentrations of 13 between 0.001 µM and 0.1
µM had little effect. In the case of compound addition to pre-
viously formed spheroids (treatment started at day 5), con-
centrations of 13 at or above 2 µM stalled the growth of pre-
formed spheroids but caused less of a decrease in spheroid area
(Fig. 5e) than addition at day 0. Linear 13 had similar effects with
significantly reduced potency (Fig. 5d, f).

embryos. To evaluate the efficacy of 13 in vivo, we utilized a
Danio rerio (zebrafish) model. The relevance of the model for our
studies is that zebrafish embryos with Wnt activating mutations
in Axin1, a component of the β-catenin destruction complex, fail
to develop eyes and a forebrain56. The phenotype can be reca-
pitulated by treatment with an inhibitor (termed BIO) for
another β-catenin destruction complex member, GSK3, in
embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf)57. It would then be
anticipated that 13 could inhibit the chemically overactivated
Wnt signal, and potentially rescue eye and forebrain develop-
ment. To test this, BIO was added to zebrafish embryos at 6 hpf
with and without 13 as described in Fig. 6a. Indeed, 13 inhibited
Wnt signaling as anticipated, as only one of the eight fish treated
with GSK3 inhibitor BIO alone developed eyes, while all the fish
treated with both BIO and 13 developed eyes (Fig. 6b–d). This
result was reproduced in 2 additional independent experiments
each showing that 0/8 BIO treated fish developed eyes while 8/8
BIO plus 13 treated fish developed eyes. In addition, linear 13
was tested and in each replicate 6/8 fish developed eyes although
most of the eyes appeared smaller and less developed (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6a). This result is consistent with cell culture
experiments showing cyclic 13 is more potent than linear 13
(Figs. 4, 5). Images of replicate experiments are shown in Sup-
plementary Fig. 6b.

 Discussion
The Wnt pathway remains a tantalizing but elusive target for
drug discovery38. Chemical inhibition of Wnt signaling has been
achieved through multiple strategies. For example, Wnt secretion
and function necessitates the post-translational addition of a
palmitoyl group, catalyzed by the acyltransferase porcupine.
Enzymatic inhibitors of porcupine have been developed and
shown to inhibit the secretion of Wnts58,59. In addition, anti-
bodies against frizzled receptors have also been developed to
inhibit Wnt signaling at the cell surface60. Both of these methods
have therapeutic potential for tumors bearing mutations in R-
spondin or the ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43, which cause
amplification of Wnt signals. Clinical trials for such Wnt inhi-
bitory agents have been initiated. Nevertheless, the majority of
activating Wnt mutations occur in the APC gene or the phos-
phorylation domain of β-catenin, downstream of both porcupine
and frizzled. Thus, it is desirable to identify inhibitors down-
stream of these mutations. Multiple interactions have been
described between β-catenin and components of the Wnt
enhanceosome on promotors of Wnt target genes61. The central
interaction between β-catenin and TCF is critical to its Wnt
activation and represents an attractive target for the general
inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling.
In this study, we demonstrate how computational tools can
facilitate the design of oligomers that target β-catenin and disrupt
its interaction with TCF. We evaluate peptoid–peptide hybrid
macrocycles designed to fold into structures complementary to a
region on the β-catenin surface that interacts with TCF. We
demonstrate that an oligomeric macrocycle exhibits potent anti-
proliferative effects on prostate cancer cell lines in both 2D and
3D models. In vivo efficacy of this compound (13) is established
in a zebrafish model of Wnt signaling. The hypothesis that the
conformational constraint imposed on the macrocyclic oligomer
enforces steric and chemical complementarity for the β-catenin
surface is strongly supported by comparisons to a linear analog,
which exhibits markedly diminished activities in vitro and
in vivo.
In our proposed mechanism of action, the oligomer macrocycle
inhibits canonical Wnt target gene expression via inhibiting the
interaction between β-catenin and TCF. We also observe
decreased AR pathway target gene expression, which could result
either from direct inhibition of the β-catenin:AR interaction or
indirectly through the decrease in AR gene transcript levels upon
Wnt signal inhibition. It remains to be shown which pathway
when inhibited, Wnt or AR, plays a critical role in the anti-
proliferative phenotype. There may be a synergistic effect of
inhibiting both pathways concurrently.
The β-catenin:TCF PPI has been targeted previously38,46,47.
However, there does not appear to be rapid clinical imple-
mentation of this pharmacological approach38. An example of
possible difficulties is exemplified by iCRT3 whereby the com-
pound was not systemically stable, requiring direct tumor injec-
tion in order to attain growth inhibition in mouse xenograft
experiments62. In contrast, peptoids have been shown to be
stable to proteolytic cleavage8,9. Additionally, peptoids have
been shown to exhibit generally improved membrane perme-
ability
compared
to
the
analogous
peptide
sequences63,64.
Favorable permeability profiles were shown to be consistent and
tolerant to variations in oligomer side chain type65. Recently,
another hexameric peptoid-peptide macrocycle, designed as a
CXCR7 modulator, was demonstrated to exhibit both membrane
permeability and oral bioavailability in rats66. In addition
to pharmacokinetic issues, there is the potential that targeting
β-catenin will lead to on-target toxicity67. It remains to be
seen whether it is possible to achieve a therapeutic window where
the inhibitor lowers overactivated Wnt signaling, such as in β-
catenin and APC mutated tumors, but does not negatively affect
basal Wnt signaling levels in systems such as the intestine and
bone that require it for general maintenance. The potential for
achieving this balance is supported by our zebrafish experiment,
in which compound 13 successfully inhibits the artificially over-
activated Wnt signaling pathway but does not otherwise harm
embryo development. Additional β-catenin nuclear interactions
have also been targeted, such as with BCL9 and CBP68,69. The
β-catenin/CBP inhibitor PRI-724 has reached the clinic, under-
going trials for colon cancer, AML, and pancreatic adenocarci-
noma70. Because PRI-724 binds to CBP (and not β-catenin),
it may have a different therapeutic profile than a drug targeting

 β-catenin:TCF and there may be opportunities for combination
therapy with compound 13.
Future testing with 13 in mouse xenograft models of prostate
cancer will be important to determine its therapeutic potential, as
demonstrated for other bioactive peptoid oligomers71. The ability
to introduce a broad range of alternative oligomer side chains
should facilitate further improvements of activity along with
enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties
towards the identification of an optimized lead compound. In
addition to promising activity versus prostate cancer, macrocycles
targeting β-catenin:TCF could also be of therapeutic benefit in
other forms of cancer for which Wnt signaling is similarly pro-
tumorigenic, such as colon and breast cancers. More generally,
this study portends further computer-assisted discovery of
increasingly complex folded oligomers to address the vast number
of different PPI relevant to human disease.
Methods
Synthesis of compounds 1–13. 2-chlorotrityl resin (Anaspec) was incubated with
Fmoc-D-Alanine (Sigma) for 1.5 h followed by washing 5× with DMF. Depro-
tection was carried out with 20% piperidine in DMF. Peptoid residues were then
added with iterative steps of 1.2 M bromoacetic acid + DIC for 20 min and 1 M
amine for 1 h. Compound 13 used the following amines: S-(-)-4-methoxy-α-
methylbenzylamine (Sigma), 3-isopropoxypropylamine (Sigma), 3,5-dimethox-
yaniline (Sigma, overnight incubation), and 2-phenoxyphenethylamine (Sigma).
The resin was cleaved with 8:1:1 DCM:Acetic acid:HFIP for 1 h. The DCM was
removed via rotary evaporation and the remaining solid was dissolved in 50:50
water:ACN and lyophilized overnight. Reverse phase HPLC was used to purify the
linear product. Cyclization was carried out using 25 mg of linear compound with
5X PyBOP and 10X DIEA in dry DCM with less than 1 mg/ml compound over-
night under argon. The DCM was removed via rotary evaporation and the
remaining solid was dissolved in 50:50 water:ACN and lyophilized overnight. The
final product was purified to > 95% by reverse phase HPLC and verified by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent LCMSD Trap XCT). Mass spectro-
metry peak identified for compound 13 (m/z): [M + Na]+ calcd. for
C59H72N6O12Na 1079.5; found, 1078.346. A key for chemical abbreviations is
supplied in Supplementary Table 4.
Cell culture. LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-95 cells were cultured in indicator free RPMI
1640 media (Life) supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped FBS, 1% pennicillin/
streptomycin, and 1% L-Glutamine. HEK-293 Cells were cultured in DMEM media
(Life) supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% pennicillin/streptomycin. A549 and
U2OS cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Life) and McCoy’s 5 A modified
media (Life), respectively, both supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% pennicillin/
streptomycin. LNCaP-abl, and LNCaP-95 cell lines were generous gifts from Z.
Culig (Innsbruck Medical University, Austria) and J. Isaacs (Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, Baltimore, MD), respectively. Cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling
(Genetica Cell Line Testing; Burlington, NC). A549 and U2OS were purchased
from ATCC (product numbers CCL-185 and HTB-96). Cell lines were routinely
screened for mycoplasma. Luciferase assays were conducted using stably trans-
fected TOP-flash and 3xARE LNCaP-abl cell lines. For the Wnt pathway, TOP-
Flash LNCaP-abl cells were treated with 1 nM siAPC (a 1:1:1 mix of Ambion
Silencer Silect siAPC RNA, ID#s s1433, s1434, s1435) for 24 h and seeded into 384-
well plates at 5000 cells/well, followed by 24 h of treatment with compound. For the
AR-pathway, 3xARE LNCaP-abl cells were seeded into 384-well plates at 5000 cells
per well, treated for 48 h with compound, with the addition of R1881 for the final 8
h. Both were measured using the ONE-Glo detection kit (Promega) and data is
standardized to CellTiter-Fluor (Promega) viability readings to account for
potential variations in well to well cell number. Control Wnt inhibitors were
purchased from Sigma with the exception of PRI-724 which was purchased from
Selleckchem. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using HEK293 cells trans-
fected with either myc-TCF (addgene #32738) or myc-TCF dominant negative
(addgene #32739) followed by 48 h of treatment with compound. Cells were lysed
using Triton lysis buffer and 1 mg total protein was incubated overnight at 4 C with
40 µl anti-cMyc magnetic beads (Thermo). Total protein concentration in cell
lysates were determined using Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo).
The beads were washed 3× with lysis buffer then boiled in 2X sample loading dye.
SDS-PAGE and western blotting were performed using anti-Myc (CST 2276) and
anti-β-catenin (CST 8480). Both antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer 1:1000
and incubated overnight at 4 C with the membrane. Full blots from IP (Fig. 3d) are
depicted in Supplementary Figure 7. RT-qPCR was performed using RNA isolated
with the RNEasy kit (Qiagen) from LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-95 cells after 24 h
treatment with 10 µM compound. The Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo) with 1
µg total RNA was used to generate cDNA. RNA concentration was determined
using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. RT-qPCR data was
collected using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix on a QuantiStudio 6 Flex (Life
Technologies). RT-qPCR data are presented as averages relative to RPL19 Ct values
(Δ#1) and DMSO control samples(Δ#2) as relative quantitation (2-ΔΔCt) in tri-
plicate of biological replicates. RT-qPCR primers are given in Supplementary
Table 5. 2D proliferation assays were conducted using 384-well plates seeded with
1000 cells/well for LNCaP-abl or LNCaP-95 cells and 1000 cells/well for A549
or U2OS cells. After 5 days of treatment the cell viability was measured with
the CellTiter-Fluor Cell Viability Assay (Promega) and data is standardized to
vehicle control.
Recombinant proteins and ELISA. The ELISA was conducted using recombinant
GST-tagged catenin binding domain (CBD) of hTCF4, AA8-54, and His6-β-catenin
armadillo domain, AA134-668. Both proteins were expressed in BL21 DL3 (NEB)
bacteria grown to OD600 0.6 and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (Sigma) for β-catenin
and 0.1 mM IPTG for TCF. The cells were then shaken for 8 h at 30 C. The bacteria
were then pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and lysed with a bacterial FRENCH
pressure cell press (Thermo). The lysates were incubated overnight with Ni-NTA or
glutathione affixed resin (Thermo), washed with TBS, and eluted using 250 mM
imidazole or 20 mM glutathione in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 200 mM NaCl. The
imidazole or glutathione were removed by dialysis into a buffer containing 20 mM
Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were then aliquoted and
frozen at −80 °C. The ELISA was initiated with adsorption of 5 µg/ml GST-TCF
CBD into a 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plate (Fisher) overnight at 4 °C. BSA was
adsorbed to control wells. The wells were washed, blocked with 5% milk for 1 h,
washed, incubated with 5 nM His6-β-catenin with varying concentrations of com-
pound in washing buffer for 1 h, washed, incubated with anti-His6 (Thermo MA1-
135) diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed, incubated with anti-mouse-
HRP (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:15000 in blocked buffer for 1 h, washed, and then
developed using 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo). His6-β-catenin was pre-
incubated with compound for 30 min prior to its addition to the plate.
Dynamic light scattering. Dynamic light scattering was measured with a Wyatt
DynaPro NanoStar. Aliquots of recombinant frozen His6-β-catenin were thawed
fresh for each experiment and centrifuged at high speed for 10 min. Compound 13 or
α-cyclodextrin (Sigma) were added to a concentration of 10 μM and compared with
the addition of 1% DMSO (vehicle). Ten readings were measured per experiment,
each with an integration time of 5 s. Three experiments were performed per condi-
tion. Data was collected and analyzed using DYNAMICS software (Wyatt).
Spheroid 3D cell culture. LNCaP-abl cells were seeded into 384-well ultra-low
attachment plates (Corning), 1000 cells/well. Varying concentrations of compound
were added either on the same day as seeding or on day 5. Media was changed
every 3–4 days using a Biotek automated media exchanger. Images were taken
using an ArraySca VTI (Cellomics) on days 5, 9, 13, 16, 20, and 22. Images were
analyzed for spheroid area with the HCS Studio Cellomics Scan Version 6.6.0
(Thermo) software. A final viability measurement was taken on day 22 using
PrestoBlue reagent (Thermo).
Zebrafish experiments. The zebrafish phenotypic assay was conducted using
wild-type zebrafish embryos seeded into a 96-well round bottom plate at 4 hpf in
50 µl of Fish Water (60 mg/l sea salt, Instant Ocean, Blacksburg, VA, USA) sup-
plemented with 1 mg per L Methylene Blue (Sigma-Aldrich). The embryos were
not dechorionated. At 50% epiboly, roughly 5.5 hpf, 50 µl of 30 µM 13 or Linear 13
was added. About 30 min later at shield stage, 50 µl of 6 nM (3×) BIO was added.
The embryos were then visualized for the presence of eyes and imaged at 30 hpf.
Zebrafish embryos were randomly assigned to non-blinded treatment groups, none
were excluded. Sample size was determined with a power calculation to achieve
statistical significance (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2) if only 60% of the fish had
developed eyes. Zebrafish experiments were approved by the NYULMC Animal
Care & Use Program under IACUC Protocol Number: 170105-02. All ethical
regulations were complied with.
