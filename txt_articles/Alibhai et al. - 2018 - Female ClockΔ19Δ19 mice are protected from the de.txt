Aims
Circadian rhythms are important for healthy cardiovascular physiology and they are regulated by the molecular cir-
cadian mechanism. Previously, we showed that disruption of the circadian mechanism factor CLOCK in male
ClockD19/D19 mice led to development of age-dependent cardiomyopathy. Here, we investigate the role of biolo-
gical sex in protecting against heart disease in aging female ClockD19/D19 mice.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
results
Female ClockD19/D19 mice are protected from the development of cardiomyopathy with age, as heart structure and
function are similar to 18 months of age vs. female WT mice. We show that female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain nor-
mal glucose tolerance as compared with female WT. Tissue metabolic profiling revealed that aging female
ClockD19/D19 mice maintain normal cardiac glucose uptake, whereas the male ClockD19/D19 mice have increased car-
diac glucose uptake consistent with pathological remodelling. Shotgun lipidomics revealed differences in phospho-
lipids that were sex and genotype specific, including cardiolipin CL76:11 that was increased and CL72:8 that was
decreased in male ClockD19/D19 mice. Additionally, female ClockD19/D19 mice show increased activation of AKT sig-
nalling and preserved cytochrome c oxidase activity compared with male ClockD19/D19 mice, which can help to ex-
plain why they are protected from heart disease. To determine how this protection occurs in females even with
the Clock mutation, we examined the effects of ovarian hormones. We show that ovarian hormones protect fe-
male ClockD19/D19 mice from heart disease as ovariectomized female ClockD19/D19 mice develop cardiac dilation,
glucose intolerance and reduced cardiac cytochrome c oxidase; this phenotype is consistent with the age-
dependent decline observed in male ClockD19/D19 mice.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
These data demonstrate that ovarian hormones protect female ClockD19/D19 mice from the development of age-
dependent cardiomyopathy even though Clock function is disturbed. Understanding the interaction of biological sex
and the circadian mechanism in cardiac growth, renewal and remodelling opens new doors for understanding and
treating heart disease.

1. Introduction
There is daily cyclic variation in our behaviour and physiology as humans
have adapted to be awake during the day and sleep at night. This is espe-
cially relevant to our cardiovascular system, e.g. heart rate1 and blood
pressure2 which peak in the day when we are active and reach a nadir at
night when we are resting. Molecular circadian clocks in all cells, including
cardiomyocytes, allow us to entrain to the external 24-h day/night cycle,
and prepare for the differing physiologic demands of daily events.3–7
The circadian clock mechanism at its most basic level consists of an
auto-regulatory transcription and translation feedback loop which co-
ordinates cellular function over the 24-h day/night cycle. Briefly, the posi-
tive limb consists of two transcription factors termed CLOCK and
BMAL1 which heterodimerize and bind to E-box enhancer elements
within the promoter region of circadian output genes such as Period
(Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry).8,9 This drives transcription of the negative
limb proteins PER and CRY. PER and CRY accumulate and in turn inhibit
CLOCK: BMAL1 mediated transcription, thus repressing their own

transcription.8–10 A number of excellent reviews on the circadian clock
mechanism have been previously published in.11–13
The circadian mechanism is important for healthy cardiovascular
physiology as disruption is associated with adverse consequences for the
cardiovascular system.14–16 Epidemiologic studies in humans suggest that
disturbing rhythms is associated with increased risk of heart disease and
worse outcome.3,4,7,17,18 Moreover, we and others previously showed
experimentally disturbing circadian rhythms in rodent models is an etio-
logical cause of heart disease, and that rhythm disruption with pre-
existing heart disease leads to worse outcomes.19–22 However, the ma-
jority of these studies are done in males, and very little is known about
the effect of biological sex on circadian rhythms and heart disease with
age. This is important as the prevalence of cardiovascular disease remains
lower in females until �75 years of age at which point it is similar be-
tween males and females.23
Here, we examined the role of CLOCK, a core component of the cir-
cadian mechanism,24 and a key regulator of cardiac gene and protein
rhythms,25,26 in cardiac aging in females. We previously showed that
ClockD19/D19 male mice develop profound cardiomyopathy with aging,
showing that an intact circadian mechanism is crucial for cardiac aging.19
Remarkably we show here that female ClockD19/D19 mice are protected
from the development of age-dependent heart disease, despite disrup-
tion of CLOCK function. We show that female biological sex and ovar-
ian hormones play a role in mitigating the development of heart disease,
even when there is a disturbed circadian mechanism. Conversely, loss of
ovarian hormones in female ClockD19/D19 mice recapitulates the male car-
diac phenotype of exacerbated cardiac aging. These findings are import-
ant as they show, for the first time, how ovarian hormones and the
circadian mechanism interact to influence healthy cardiac aging.
2. Methods
2.1 Animals
All studies were approved by the University of Guelph Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the guidelines
of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Female and male homozygote
ClockD19/D19 heterozygote ClockD19/þ, and wild type (WT) littermates on
a C57Bl/6J background used for this study were obtained from our
breeding colony at the University of Guelph, and genotyped as described
previously in.20,25 Mice were housed on a 12-h light: 12-h dark (12:12
LD) cycle with food and water provided ad libitum throughout the study.
All animals were sacrificed by isoflurane and cervical dislocation. Hearts
for histopathology were perfused with 1 M KCl and fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin. For all molecular experiments hearts were collected,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 �C until use. For deter-
mination of wheel running circadian period, individually housed mice
were entrained to a diurnal 12:12 LD cycle for 2 weeks, followed by
transfer to constant darkness (DD) for 3 weeks. Data were analysed
using ClockLab (ActiMetrics).
2.2 Ovariectomy surgery
Bilateral ovariectomy was performed using the method of Clipperton-
Allen AE et al.27 Briefly, 6-week-old mice were administered carprofen
(20 mg/kg; Rimadyl, Pfizer) 1 h prior to the procedure for analgesia. Mice
were anesthetized at 4% isoflurane and maintained at 2.5% using a nose-
cone. A small vertical midline dorsal incision of 2 cm was made in the
lower back followed by two smaller bilateral lumbar incisions (<1 cm)
through the muscles overlying the ovaries. The fallopian tubes and
ovarian arteries were clamped and the ovaries excised. The central inci-
sion in the skin was closed with 1–2 MikRon Autoclip 9 mm wound clips
(MikRon Precision Inc). Mice received a post-operative saline bolus
(0.5ml, subcutaneous) and recovered.
2.3 Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 21months of age
using a GE Vivid 7 Dimension ultrasound machine (GE Medical Systems)
with the i13L 14MHz linear-array transducer, as described in.19,20
Animals were maintained under light anesthesia (1.5% isoflurane) and
body temperature maintained at 37 �C during image acquisition. Data
analyses were performed on an offline system using EchoPAC (GE
Medical Systems).
2.4 In vivo haemodynamics
The homozygote ClockD19/D19 heterozygote ClockD19/þ and WT mice at
4 and 21 months of age were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane, intubated,
and haemodynamic measurements were taken as previously described.19
LV contractile performance and blood pressure were measured using a
1.4 Fr pressure catheter (Transonic) via the right carotid artery. Body
temperature was continuously monitored and maintained at 37 �C. Data
were analyzed using Lab Chart 7 (Colorado Creeks, US). 30 mice were
used, n = 4–6 mice/group at 4 and 21 months of age.
2.5 Histology
For histological analyses, formalin fixed hearts from 21-month-old mice
were collected, paraffin embedded, and 5 mm sections were taken at the
mid papillary level. Sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome for
analysis of myocyte cross sectional area (MCSA), or picrosirius red for
quantification of cardiac fibrosis. At least 100 myocytes were measured
per heart, over at least three sections, with n = 4 hearts/group, using
Image J v1.48 (NIH).
2.6 Comprehensive lab animal monitoring
system
The comprehensive lab animal monitoring system (CLAMS) was used to
examine daily rhythms in metabolism and physical activity of 12-month-
old female ClockD19/D19 and WT mice, using the methods described pre-
viously in.20 Animals were acclimatized to the chambers for 48h after
which metabolic parameters were measured for 24h. Data were
analysed using the Oxymax software (Columbus Instruments). A total
of 14 mice were used, n = 8 for female ClockD19/D19 mice, and n = 6 for
female WT.
2.7 Glucose tolerance test
At 12months of age glucose tolerance tests were performed in mice
fasted for 14 h. At either ZT02 or ZT14 glucose was injected at 2 g/kg
body weight (BW) (i.p.). Blood glucose concentrations following glucose
challenge were determined by tail vein sampling at baseline, 15, 30, 45,
60, 90, and 120min post-injection using a hand-held glucometer
(Freestyle Lite, Abbot). A total of 24 mice were used, n = 6 for female
ClockD19/D19 and n ¼ 6 for female WT, n = 6 for OVX female ClockD19/D19
and n = 6 OVX female WT. In addition, the day/night rhythm in ad lib
glucose levels was determined at ZT02 and ZT14 by drawing blood
from the saphenous vein and testing on the hand-held glucometer
(Freestyle Lite, Abbot). n = 10 female ClockD19/D19 mice and n = 9 female
WT mice were used.

2.8. Protein isolation and immunoblotting
Animals were sacrificed at ZT06 by isoflurane and cervical dislocation,
and hearts were collected. Protein was isolated using the CelLytic MT
Cell Lysis reagent (Sigma) supplemented with cOmplete protease and
PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche), using methods pre-
viously described by our laboratory.25,26,28 Total protein concentration
was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were sub-
jected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) at
100 V for 2 h. Following transfer, membranes were blocked using 5%
milk in tris-buffered saline with tween-20 (TBS-T) then incubated with
the primary antibodies overnight at 4 �C. Primary antibodies used were
phospho-AKT (Ser473) (4060; 1:1000), or AKT (4691; 1:1000), or phos-
pho-GSK-3b (Ser9) (9323; 1:1000), or GSK-3b (9315; 1:1000).
Membranes were then washed in TBS-T and incubated with a goat anti-
rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature.
All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signalling. Membranes were
then washed and proteins visualized by enhanced chemi-luminescence
on a ChemiDoc MP (BioRad) using the SignalFire Elite ECL reagent
(12757, Cell Signalling). Loading was normalized to total protein using
the Mem-code PVDF kit (Thermo Scientific). Images were analyzed using
ImageLab (BioRad). A total of 14 mice were used, n = 7 female WT,
n = 7 female ClockD19/D19.
2.9 2-Deoxyglucose and 2-bromopalmitate
uptake
To assess glucose and fatty acid uptake in tissues in vivo, 12-month old
mice were fasted for 14h, then anesthetized at ZT06 with isoflurane,
and injected retro-orbitally with 5 mCi 2-deoxyglucose in phosphate buf-
fered saline (PBS) and 1.5 mCi 2-bromo[C14]palmitate complexed to bo-
vine serum albumin in PBS. Hearts were collected 1 h after injection,
homogenized in PBS, and radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation
counting (Tri-Carb 2900TR; Packard Instruments). Radioactivity in tissue
homogenates was normalized to the counts per minute (cpm) present in
10 ml of serum collected 5 min following injection. A total of 19 mice
were used, n = 5 male ClockD19/D19 n = 5 male WT, n = 4 female
ClockD19/D19 and n = 5 female WT.
2.10 Lipidomics
Cardiac lipids were extracted from hearts collected at ZT06 according
the Bligh and Dyer method,29 followed by shotgun lipidomics performed
by the Analytical Facility for Bioactive Molecules, Hospital for Sick
Children, Toronto, Canada. To do this, lipid extracts were reconstituted
in 900 ml of 1:1 Chloroform: Methanol containing 10 mM ammonium
acetate, followed by direct infusion-tandem mass spectrometry (DI-MS/
MS) on a Sciex 6600 Triple time-of-flight (TOF) machine (ABSciex:
Framingham, MA, USA). The MS/MSAll acquisition method was used in
both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes. Each sample
was individually infused for 7.5 min in each ionization mode at a flow rate
of 15 ml/min. Quadrupole precursor ions were selected in the mass
range of 200–2000 m/z and product ions at a TOF mass range of 100–
2000 m/z. Qualitative data analyses were performed using LipidView
Software v1.3 beta (ABSciex: Framingham, MA, USA). MS/MS data were
matched to the LipidView database and the corresponding TOF MS
mass peak areas integrated in order to generate compositional lipid pro-
files. Quantification is based on the peak area and expressed as a % of
each lipid species count/total lipid class count. A total of 24 mice were
used, n = 6 hearts/group.
2.11 Cytochrome c activity assay
Animals were sacrificed at ZT06 by isoflurane and cervical dislocation,
and hearts were collected. Mitochondria were isolated using the
Mitochondrial Isolation Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Sigma; MITOISO1). Total mitochondrial protein was determined using
the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Cytochrome c Oxidase activity was deter-
mined using the CYTOCOX1 Assay kit (Sigma) according the manufac-
turer’s instructions. The change in absorbance at 550nm was measured
in 1 ml cuvettes using a Helios Delta spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific). A total of 40 mice were used, n = 7 male ClockD19/D19 n = 7
male WT, n = 7 female ClockD19/D19 n = 7 female WT, n = 6 OVX female
ClockD19/D19 and n = 6 OVX female WT.
2.12 Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. All data were tested for normal
distribution and homogenous of variance. Statistical comparisons were
done using an unpaired Student’s t-test, or two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc for multiple comparisons as ap-
plicable. Analyses were done using SigmaPlot 12 (Systat Software Inc.)
and Prism 5 (Graph Pad). Values of *P < 0.05 are considered statistically
significant.
3. Results
3.1 Female ClockD19/D19 mice are protected
from cardiac aging
The female ClockD19/D19 mice have a disrupted circadian mechanism, yet
remarkably, they are protected against heart disease with aging. In order
to first characterize the disrupted circadian mechanism, we used the clas-
sical wheel running actigraphy methods. We show the day/night pheno-
types of the homozygote ClockD19/D19 heterozygote ClockD19/þ and the
WT mice. All animals entrain to the LD cycle under normal 12:12 LD
conditions, as anticipated (Figure 1A). Moreover, under circadian condi-
tions of constant darkness, where the animals receive their cues from
the endogenous circadian mechanism instead of the light: dark cycle, the
effect of the Clock mutation is clearly evident in the female mice. The
Clock mutation leads to a significant increase in wheel running period in
homozygote ClockD19/D19 mice (27.10 h ± 0.07) compared with hetero-
zygote (24.27 h ± 0.05), and WT mice (23.83h ± 0.03). This is very simi-
lar to the phenotype that has been previously well established in the
male Clock mice, by our group and others.19,24 Moreover, we found that
the onset of activity in homozygous ClockD19/D19 mice was more variable
compared with the other genotypes, but there were no difference in the
total amount of running wheel activity (see Supplementary material on
line, Figure S1A and B). Collectively these data show that the Clock muta-
tion is functional in the female mice.
To carefully evaluate cardiac structure and function in the aging female
ClockD19/D19 ClockD19/þ, and WT mice, we used serial echocardiography
at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 21 months of age. Figure 1 and Table 1 show that fe-
male ClockD19/D19 hearts are healthy to 18 months of age, as LV internal
dimensions at diastole (LVIDd) (Figure 1B) and systole (LVIDs) (Figure
1C), % ejection fraction (EF) (Figure 1D), and % fractional shortening (FS)
(Figure 1E) are similar to heterozygotes and WTs. This is in contrast to
the male ClockD19/D19 mice which exhibit increased cardiac remodelling
starting at 12months of age.19 Comparison of female cardiac morphom-
etry at 12 months of age confirms that female mice show protection
from the adverse cardiovascular effects of CLOCK disruption, as female
Biological sex influences heart disease in Clock mice

ClockD19/D19 mice exhibit no difference in HW or HW/ tibia length (TL)
compared with female WT littermates (see Supplementary material on
line, Figures S1C and D). In contrast, at 12months the male ClockD19/D19
mice show a significant increase in heart weight (HW) and HW/TL vs.
male WT littermates (see Supplementary material online, Figures S1C
and D). Thus biological sex appears to protect against heart disease in
aging female ClockD19/D19 mice.
3.2 Cardiac aging in female ClockD19/D19
mice, by in vivo haemodynamics
The female ClockD19/D19 are protected from heart disease for almost their
entire normal 2year lifespan, and only at 21months of age do they exhibit
any changes in cardiac function by echocardiography (Figure 1B–E). Only
with extreme age, at 21months of age, do the female ClockD19/D19 mice
begin to develop impaired heart function. These aged female ClockD19/D19
mice have decreased LV end systolic pressure (LVESP), decreased mean
arterial pressure (MAP), and reduced dp/dtmax and dp/dtmin values by
in vivo haemodynamics (Table 2). That is, the aged female ClockD19/D19
mice exhibit hypotension (reduced afterload) and a decrease in myocar-
dial contractility indices. Thus these data show that the female ClockD19/D19
mice are protected from adverse changes in cardiac structure and func-
tion for most of their lifespan, in contrast to the male ClockD19/D19
mice,19 and only begin to decompensate with old age.
3.3 Cardiac aging in female ClockD19/D19
mice, by histopathology
We also examined additional cardiovascular parameters in the female
ClockD19/D19 mice at 4 and 21months of age. The aging female mice ex-
hibited no difference in HW, as compared with littermates (Figure 1F)
suggesting that the hearts do not have increased hypertrophy with age.
The HW:BW ratio was increased, but only because of the lower BW in
these aged animals (Figure 1G and Table 1). There was also no difference
in MSCA, consistent with the lack of cardiac hypertrophy with age
(Figure 1H). Histologically, however we did find greater cardiac fibrosis in
the female ClockD19/D19 mice by 21 months, consistent with the onset of
contractile dysfunction at 21 months (Figure 1I). Thus the female
ClockD19/D19 mice do not develop the same classic cardiomyopathy as
observed previously with the male ClockD19/D19 mice,19 but they do
show signs of cardiac aging towards the end of their lifespan as compared
with their littermates.
3.4 Diurnal metabolism in female
ClockD19/D19 mice
Since female ClockD19/D19 mice show protection from the adverse effects
of CLOCK disruption on the heart by 12 months we further examined
differences between male and female ClockD19/D19 and WT mice at this
age. We investigated diurnal metabolic parameters in the female
ClockD19/D19 vs. WT mice. Overall, the animals are nocturnal with
increased activity in the dark phase, as anticipated (Figure 2A). All animals
consume the majority of their food in the dark (active) phase; however,
female ClockD19/D19 mice also consume significantly more food during the
light (rest) phase than the female WTs (Figure 2B). Examination of whole
body substrate utilization in female ClockD19/D19 mice reveals significantly
greater respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the light phase as com-
pared with WTs (Figure 2C). There is no difference in oxygen consumption
(Figure 2D), however energy expenditure is also significantly increased in
ClockD19/D19 mice during the light phase as compared with WTs (Figure
2E). Collectively these data suggest that the female ClockD19/D19 mice are

taking in more food, using more carbohydrates, but also expending more
energy, as compared with their WT littermates. This is in contrast to male
ClockD19/D19 mice which have been previously shown to exhibit increased
food intake and reduced energy expenditure.30
3.5 Diurnal glucose metabolism in female
ClockD19/D19 mice
Despite the altered metabolic profiles in the female ClockD19/D19 mice,
glucose tolerance remains the same as their female WT littermates.
Specifically, glucose tolerance testing at either ZT02 (rest phase) (Figure
2F) or ZT14 (wake phase) (Figure 2G) revealed peak glucose levels at
15min post-glucose injection, followed by similar rates of glucose clear-
ance to 2 h after injection in female ClockD19/D19 and WT mice.
Consistent with normal glucose clearance, the area under the curve
(AUC) is similar in female ClockD19/D19 and WT mice at ZT02 or ZT14
(Figure 2H). Moreover, examination of blood glucose levels under ad lib-
itum conditions demonstrated that both groups have normal diurnal
blood glucose levels, as measured at ZT02 and ZT14 (Figure 2I). These
findings are significant because the female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain
normal blood glucose responses and are protected from heart dis-
ease, which is in contrast, to previous work which showed that male
ClockD19/D19 mice have abnormal glucose handling with aging.31
3.6 Substrate uptake in female ClockD19/D19
vs. male ClockD19/D19 mice
Since the studies above indicated that the female ClockD19/D19 mice have
differences in energy and glucose profiles as compared with the male
ClockD19/D19 mice, and since this might help to explain why the females
are protected from heart disease, we next investigated tissue substrate
uptake by radiolabelled glucose and palmitate assays. In the heart,
we found that female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain normal cardiac
3 H-deoxyglucose and 14C-palmitate uptake with aging, similar to female
WT mice (Figure 3A). In contrast, male ClockD19/D19 mice have signifi-
cantly increased cardiac glucose uptake compared with male WT mice
(Figure 3A). In the liver, we found that female ClockD19/D19 mice also main-
tain normal cardiac 3 H-deoxyglucose and 14C-palmitate uptake with
aging, similar to female WT mice (Figure 3B). However, the male
ClockD19/D19 mice have significantly increased liver substrate uptake com-
pared with male WT mice (Figure 3B). Last, in skeletal muscle, we found
that female ClockD19/D19 mice handle glucose the same, but have signifi-
cantly reduced skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, as compared with fe-
male WT mice (Figure 3C). The males again are different; male ClockD19/D19
mice had no change in fatty acid skeletal muscle uptake compared
with male WT mice (Figure 3C). Collectively, these data demonstrate
that female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain normal substrate uptake with
aging, which may help to protect them from heart disease, whereas
the male ClockD19/D19 mice have altered glucose and fatty acid uptake
compared with male WTs that could play a role in the pathogenesis of
age-dependent heart disease.
3.7 Cardiac lipidomics
Previously we found a role for cardiac lipids in mediating sex-differences
in cardiac remodelling with aging in a different study which focused on
lipid metabolism; however, we did not investigate the circadian system at
that time.32 The lipid composition of cells is influenced by ovarian hor-
mones33,34 and ovarian hormones can protect against heart disease.35–37
In light of those observations, we next investigated the lipid composition
of the hearts of the female and male ClockD19/D19 mice and controls. We
performed shotgun lipidomics (DI-MS/MS) to investigate the cardiac lipi-
dome in aged mice. We were specifically interested in lipid profiles that
were common to the female WTs, female ClockD19/D19 and male WTs,
but altered in the male ClockD19/D19 animals with age-dependent cardio-
myopathy. Total lipid content was extracted from the hearts, followed by

mass spectrometry. Lipid View bioinformatics was used to compile the
results into the following groupings: phospholipids, triacylgylceride fatty
acids, phospholipid fatty acids, and cardiolipins. We found general differ-
ences in lipid content between male and female mice, as anticipated32
(see Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2). We also found dif-
ferences in cardiolipin composition consistent with our hypothesis that
lipid content varies with cardiovascular remodelling in heart disease.
Specifically, we found that the primary cardiolipin CL72:8 was lowest in
male ClockD19/D19 hearts (Figure 4A) compared with all other groups.
Moreover, we found a shift in composition of the less abundant cardioli-
pins. These changes include cardiolipin CL76:11 which were increased in
male ClockD19/D19 mice vs. all other groups (Figure 4B). In addition, cardioli-
pin CL82:9 was increased and cardiolipin CL74:9 was decreased in male
ClockD19/D19 mice with heart disease as compared with healthy male WT
mice (Figures 4C and D). Collectively, these data show remodelling of lipid
profiles which correlate with increased cardiac remodelling in male
ClockD19/D19 mice.
3.8 Activation of cardiac hypertrophy
pathways
A mechanism by which disrupting CLOCK can promote cardiac aging is
through the AKT and GSK-3 b signalling pathway; indeed we previously
reported this in the male ClockD19/D19 mice.19 Thus we next investigated
these pathways in the female ClockD19/D19 mice as differential activation
might help to explain why the females are protected from age-
dependent cardiac remodelling. Interestingly, we found that female
ClockD19/D19 mice exhibit a significant increase in AKT activation com-
pared with female WT mice (Figure 4E), suggesting that CLOCK disrup-
tion affects AKT activation regardless of sex. Moreover, GSK-3b
phosphorylation was also significantly increased in female ClockD19/D19
hearts, consistent with increased AKT activation in these mice (Figure
4E). Interestingly, despite differences in the AKT/GSK phosphorylation
pathways, the female ClockD19/D19 mice maintained cytochrome c oxi-
dase activity similar to female WT littermates (Figure 4F). This is in con-
trast male ClockD19/D19 hearts, which have reduced cytochrome c
oxidase activity compared with male WT littermates (Figure 4F). Taken
together, these results show that female ClockD19/D19 mice have activa-
tion of AKT/GSK pathways consistent with the presence of the Clock
mutation, however this does not lead to changes in cytochrome c oxi-
dase activity as was found in the development of age-dependent cardio-
myopathy in male ClockD19/D19 mice (Figure 4G). Consistent with this
finding, they also show no changes in cardiac glucose uptake and mito-
chondrial function (Figure 4G), which may help to explain the cardio-
protection despite the Clock mutation.
3.9 OVX female ClockD19/D19 mice exhibit
age-dependent cardiac remodelling
We next hypothesized that ovarian hormones play a protective role and
that ovariectomy of female ClockD19/D19 mice should remove the pro-
tective effect and lead to the development age-dependent cardiac re-
modelling.
To
examine
this,
female
ClockD19/D19
mice
were
ovariectomized (OVX) at 6 weeks of age, and their cardiac structure and
function were evaluated as these animals aged and were compared with
WT OVX mice. We found that OVX female ClockD19/D19 mice by
8 months of age develop significantly increased left ventricular dilation
evidenced by increased LVIDd (Figure 5A) and LVIDs (Figure 5B), as com-
pared with OVX WT littermates. The hearts continued to dilate by
12months of age (Figures 5A and B), and HW is significantly increased
(Figure 5C). In addition, the female OVX ClockD19/D19 mice no longer
maintain normal blood glucose responses as intact females had, but in-
stead show abnormal glucose handling. That is, at ZT02 (lights on, animal
rest time), OVX ClockD19/D19 mice had increased blood glucose levels
post-injection, as compared with OVX WT mice (Figure 5D). Moreover,
at ZT14 (lights off, animal wake time), OVX ClockD19/D19 mice also had
increased blood glucose levels post-injection as compared with OVX
WT mice (Figure 5E). Consistent with glucose intolerance in the OVX
ClockD19/D19 mice, AUC was significantly increased at ZT02 and ZT14,
as compared with OVX WT mice (Figure 5F). Last, we examined cyto-
chrome c oxidase activity and found that the OVX ClockD19/D19 mice
have reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity compared with OVX
WT mice (Figure 5G). Thus the loss of ovarian hormones in female
ClockD19/D19 mice recapitulates the heart disease phenotype, and meta-
bolic dysregulation observed in male ClockD19/D19 mice, and is consistent
with a role of Clock in cardiac remodelling with age.
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that female ClockD19/D19 mice are pro-
tected from the development of age-dependent heart disease, despite
the presence of the Clock mutation. Female ClockD19/D19 hearts appear

in vivo haemodynamics analysis. We also found no difference in HW, and
myocyte cross-sectional area as compared with female WT littermates.
Investigation of diurnal metabolic parameters revealed that female
ClockD19/D19 mice have increased activity, food intake, carbohydrate
oxidation, and energy expenditure during the rest period. However, des-
pite altered metabolic profiles the female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain nor-
mal glucose tolerance and cardiac glucose uptake, similar to the female
WT mice. Thus the female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain normal substrate
profiles, which may help protect against underlying genetic dysfunction.

In contrast to the male ClockD19/D19 mice which have altered metabolic
profiles and develop heart disease with age. AKT and GSK signalling
were increased in female ClockD19/D19 hearts, similar to the male
ClockD19/D19 hearts. However, the female ClockD19/D19 hearts also had
preserved cytochrome c oxidase activity, and differences in cardiolipin
composition, concurrent with the healthier cardiovascular profiles.
These benefits were due in part to ovarian hormones, as ovariectomy of
the female ClockD19/D19 mice recapitulated the heart disease phenotype
in male mice. OVX female ClockD19/D19 mice developed increased LV
dilation, increased HW, glucose intolerance and reduced cytochrome c
oxidase activity. Thus removal of ovarian hormones leads to cardiac
remodelling in female ClockD19/D19 mice that was consistent with the
male ClockD19/D19 mice, and supports a role of Clock in age-dependent
cardiomyopathy.
One of the interesting findings of this study is that the adverse effects
of the circadian Clock mutation on the heart can be mitigated by female
biological sex and ovarian hormones. Several recent circadian studies
using genetic or environmental models provide further support for a
role of biological sex in mediating the effects of circadian rhythm disrup-
tion, consistent with our findings. For example, human females exhibit
greater impairment in cognitive performance following circadian dysyn-
chrony, as compared with males in similar environments.38 In experi-
mental animal models, survivorship after myocardial infarction is greater
in female mice as compared with male mice,39 and more specifically fe-
males infarcted at sleep time have the greatest survivorship.40 It has also
been shown that female ClockD19/D19 mice exhibit lower survival follow-
ing whole body irradiation compared with female WT mice while male
ClockD19/D19 mice do not show changes in survival as compared with
male WT mice.41 Last, circadian disorganization caused by shifted light
dark cycles leads to reduced survival of male rats but not female rats fol-
lowing middle cerebral artery occlusion.42 Thus Clock disruption may
interact with factors associated with biological sex to modulate the
pathologic effects of heart disease.
This is the first study to show a role for biological sex in mitigating the
effects of the Clock mutation on cardiac remodelling. However, the no-
tion that females are protected from cardiovascular disease in general is
well established.23,43,44 For example females are protected from heart
disease as compared with males, with reduced cardiac remodelling in
aging female rats45 and also less hypertrophy in pressure overload-
induced cardiac hypertrophy in female mice.46 Metabolism also plays a
role in male-female differences in heart disease.47 These can be driven in
part by differences in glucose handling,48,49 cardiac glucose uptake,50 and
fatty acid oxidation profiles.51 In terms of our study, altered substrate
utilization/cardiac lipid profiles and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activ-
ity were associated with the development of age-dependent cardiomy-
opathy in male ClockD19/D19 mice, whereas female ClockD19/D19 mice do
not exhibit these metabolic changes and are protected from the devel-
opment of heart disease with age. One key aspect we found is that there
were differences in the remodelling of cardiolipin profiles in a sex and
genotype manner.
Cardiolipins are a key component of the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane important for mitochondrial bioenergetics,52 and composition is
altered in heart disease.53 Our female ClockD19/D19 mice maintain normal
cardiolipin profiles and lack heart disease. In contrast, we observed
changes in cardiolipin profiles in the male ClockD19/D19 mice. Cardiolipin
profiles in the male ClockD19/D19 mice are consistent with those reported
in heart disease, as reduced 72:8 and increased 76:11 cardiolipin are
associated with heart failure in humans, and experimental heart failure in
rats.53 Moreover, reduced 72:8 content is associated with reduced
cytochrome c oxidase activity.53 Collectively these studies suggest that
remodelling of cardiolipins leads to impaired mitochondrial function in
male ClockD19/D19 mice. Conversely, female ClockD19/D19 mice are pro-
tected from age-dependent heart disease, mediated in part by preserved
cardiolipin content and cytochrome c oxidase activity. We postulate
that the ovarian hormones protect against the decline in mitochondrial
function, reducing age-dependent cardiac remodelling. In terms of future
directions, it will be interesting to investigate serum lipid profiles as well
as the cardiac metabolome in female verses male ClockD19/D19 mice to
further understand how female mice are metabolically protected from
the Clock mutation.
It is interesting to note that there are differences in the ability of the
skeletal muscle to utilize fatty acids compared with the heart in ClockD19/
D19 mice. Assuming that increase in whole body RER is reflecting a reduc-
tion in skeletal muscle metabolism of fatty acids, there is no compensa-
tory increase in glucose metabolism. One possible explanation for this
differential regulation is that these changes in substrate profiles are the
result of an interaction between tissue specific circadian regulation and
cardiac specific changes associated with disease progression. In support
of this Zhang et al. have shown that rhythmic gene expression is regu-
lated in a tissue specific manner, including genes critical for glucose and
fatty acid metabolism.54 Moreover, the circadian clock has been shown
to regulate genes crucial for substrate utilization in the heart55 and skel-
etal muscle56 which likely contributes to tissue specific regulation. Last,
there are changes in cardiac metabolism associated with heart disease
including increased glucose utilization, as observed in male ClockD19/D19
mice.57,58 Collectively, these factors can help to explain why there is dif-
ferential regulation of glucose and fatty acids between the heart and skel-
etal muscle. Moreover, ovarian hormone regulation of circadian gene
expression and cardiac remodelling may explain why females are pro-
tected against the metabolic derangement and cardiomyopathy with
aging.
Although the female ClockD19/D19 mice are protected from heart dis-
ease, OVX ClockD19/D19 mice develop age-dependent cardiac re-
modelling, consistent with a role for Clock in this disease process. This is
consistent with the notion that ovarian hormones protect against heart
disease. For example, estrogen mitigates mechanisms of cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy, as demonstrated
in
rat
cardiomyocytes
in
vitro.36
Moreover, estrogen replacement limits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in
vitro, and preserves LV function and contractility in mice with pressure
overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.37 Estrogens can interact
with the intrinsic circadian clock, and prevent abnormal metabolic pro-
files caused by circadian disruption59 which helps to explain why our fe-
male mice with a Clock mutation were protected. However, it’s
important to note that OVX leads to a loss of a variety of hormones.
Although beyond the scope of this study, it would be interesting in fu-
ture studies to examine how the different hormones interact with
Clock, and other components of the circadian mechanism to provide
cardio-protection with aging. For example, future studies using estro-
gen supplementation as well as estrogen receptor specific agonists in
OVX ClockD19/D19 mice will help delineate the pathways responsible
for cardio-protection. Interestingly, we have recently shown that fe-
male mice are less susceptible to adverse remodelling after myocardial
infarction (LAD ligation model) as compared with male mice.40 Given
that increased AKT activation in the heart is associated with circadian
clock disruption in male19,60 and female mice, it could be interesting to
determine sex-dependent differences in disease pathophysiology in this
model as well in trans-aortic constriction, where AKT signalling is also
crucial.

Although female biological sex confers some protection against the
circadian Clock mutation and heart disease in female mice, the males are
not protected. This has important clinical implications, particularly as cir-
cadian rhythm disruption (e.g. in shift work, sleep disorders) is associated
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and worse outcomes, espe-
cially in males.3,4,7,15,16 In addition, circadian timing of drug treatment
(chronotherapy) benefits the efficacy of some cardiovascular therapies
such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and Aspirin.54,61–64
However, there are important sex differences that should be con-
sidered, as the benefits of chronotherapy differ between male and female
patients.65,66 Moreover, circadian mechanism modulators are currently
under development67,68 and hold therapeutic promise for reducing the
progression of heart disease; therapeutic benefits and potential side ef-
fects should be investigated in both sexes. Therefore future investigation
of how biological sex and the circadian mechanism interact to influence
cardiac remodelling is critical for understanding the pathophysiology of
heart disease and for clinical benefit in males and females.
5. Conclusion
In summary, we show the first time that female ClockD19/D19 mice are
protected from the adverse effects of the Clock mutation and the devel-
opment of age-dependent heart disease. Furthermore, we show that
ovarian hormones play a key role in mediating the protective effects in
female ClockD19/D19 mice, as ovariectomy of ClockD19/D19 mice recapitu-
lates the phenotype of metabolic dysfunction and adverse cardiac re-
modelling with age. These data demonstrate a previously unrecognized
link between biological sex and Clock in the development and protection
against heart disease with aging.
