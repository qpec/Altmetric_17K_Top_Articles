Chronic pain is a major global public health issue causing a severe impact on both the quality of life for sufferers and the wider
economy. Despite the significant clinical burden, little progress has been made in terms of therapeutic development. A unique
approach to identifying new human-validated analgesic drug targets is to study rare families with inherited pain insensitivity. Here
we have analysed an otherwise normal family where six affected individuals display a pain insensitive phenotype that is char-
acterized by hyposensitivity to noxious heat and painless bone fractures. This autosomal dominant disorder is found in three
generations and is not associated with a peripheral neuropathy. A novel point mutation in ZFHX2, encoding a putative transcrip-
tion factor expressed in small diameter sensory neurons, was identified by whole exome sequencing that segregates with the pain
insensitivity. The mutation is predicted to change an evolutionarily highly conserved arginine residue 1913 to a lysine within a
homeodomain. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice bearing the orthologous murine p.R1907K mutation, as well
as Zfhx2 null mutant mice, have significant deficits in pain sensitivity. Gene expression analyses in dorsal root ganglia from mutant
and wild-type mice show altered expression of genes implicated in peripheral pain mechanisms. The ZFHX2 variant and down-
stream regulated genes associated with a human pain-insensitive phenotype are therefore potential novel targets for the develop-
ment of new analgesic drugs.

Introduction
Congenital hypoalgesia, in which patients are born with a
reduced capacity to detect tissue-damage causing stimuli, is a
rare inherited phenotype. In the most extreme forms, patients
can suffer from a complete inability to perceive noxious sti-
muli which leads to dangerous, but painless, injuries such as
biting off of fingertips, lips and the tongue, and frequent bone
fractures (Nahorski et al., 2015). Recessive loss of function
mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN9A,
which encodes Nav1.7, are a major cause of this form of pain
insensitivity (OMIM 243000) (Cox et al., 2006; Habib et al.,
2015). A second, less frequent cause, are dominant gain of
function mutations in the Nav1.9 channel, which to date have
been reported in only four families worldwide (OMIM
615548)
(Leipold
et
al.,
2013;
Woods
et
al.,
2015;
Phatarakijnirund et al., 2016). In both of these channelopathy
disorders there is an absence of an associated peripheral neur-
opathy with the phenotype related to dysfunction of voltage-
gated sodium channels within the intact sensory neurons. In
the case of Nav1.7, this dysfunction has been shown to result
in
an
upregulation
of
endogenous
opioids,
with
the
painlessness capable of being partially reversed in both
humans and mice through a systemic infusion of naloxone,
an opioid receptor antagonist (Minett et al., 2015).
Inherited pain insensitivity can also arise through congenital
absence or a progressive degeneration of sensory and auto-
nomic neurons, the so-called hereditary sensory and autonomic
neuropathies (HSANs) (Rotthier et al., 2012). This heteroge-
neous group of disorders differ in their age of onset (juvenile or
adult) and degree of motor, sensory and autonomic disturb-
ances, which correlates largely with the subtypes of neurons
that are affected. In the case of HSAN IV (OMIM 256800)
and HSAN V (OMIM 608654), in which there are recessive
loss of function mutations in the genes encoding the nerve
growth factor (NGF) receptor (TRK-A) and NGF, respectively,
there is a congenital absence of damage- and temperature sen-
sing neurons and a deficient innervation of sweat glands that
can lead to anhidrosis (Indo et al., 1996; Einarsdottir et al.,
2004; Carvalho et al., 2011). The functions of HSAN genes
are diverse, ranging from neurotrophic functions (NTRK1/
TRK-A and NGF), sphingolipid metabolism (SPTLC1 and
SPTLC2), structural integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ATL1) and Golgi apparatus (RETREG1/FAM134B) and ves-
icular trafficking (RAB7A and KIF1A) (Rotthier et al., 2012).
Recently, several HSAN mutations were also reported in
PRDM12,
an
epigenetic
regulator
that
is
expressed
in
nociceptors and their progenitors (OMIM 616488). Loss of
function of PRDM12 leads to a severe congenital peripheral
neuropathy, with a lack of nerve fibres crossing the dermal-
epidermal border as assessed by staining of a skin biopsy, and
a consequent pain-insensitive phenotype (Chen et al., 2015).
Here, we have studied a family where congenital hypoal-
gesia is present in six affected individuals across three
generations. Through a combination of whole exome
sequencing and mouse model analyses we have shown
that the genetic defect resides in ZFHX2 (Zinc finger
homeobox 2), a nociceptor-expressed transcriptional regu-
lator. Gene expression analyses show that the missense
mutation in ZFHX2 causes significant gene deregulation
within dorsal root ganglia (DRG), helping to explain the
observed pain insensitive phenotype.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
The family was identified in Italy and was previously reported
(Spinsanti et al., 2008), although the full extent of the pheno-
type was only elucidated following publication. The family con-
sists of a mother (aged 78), her two daughters (aged 52 and 50)
and their children (two boys and one girl, aged 24, 21 and 16,
respectively). In different severity and forms, these subjects pre-
sented a low ability to sense pain, to experience temperature
and to sweat. Indeed, the members suffered unnoticed bone
fractures in, for example, the arms and legs (Supplementary
Table 1) and cutaneous injuries, but occasionally suffered
from headaches and visceral pains. In addition, members mani-
fested a low sensitivity to capsaicin (chilli pepper) and a normal
or high sensitivity to odours. Sometimes the intense sensations
were accompanied by autonomic reactions such as vomiting and
fainting. Episodes of unexplained hyperthermia occasionally
occurred. Cognitive ability and motor performances were
normal or high. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants and the study was approved by the ethics com-
mittee at University College London, UK, with sensory pheno-
type assessments at the University of Siena, Italy.

 0–10 kg); the point was considered positive if the subject re-
ported pain with a pressure lower than 4 kg. The pressure was
applied once to 18 tender points (9 + 9) and 10 control points
(5 + 5) (Wolfe et al., 1990). The pressure gauge was advanced
at a rate of �1 kg/s and stopped when the subject declared that
the pressure pain level had been reached.
Thermal detection pain threshold
Superficial cold and heat pain thresholds were determined with
a thermal stimulator (Medical Instruments Facilities). Four
cold and four heat stimuli were delivered on the thenar emi-
nence of the dominant hand at 1.5�C/s starting from 32�C and
passing to �10�C or 50�C, respectively, and the thresholds
were expressed as the mean values of the four responses.
The subject was asked to press a button to interrupt the stimu-
lus when the thermal sensation became a nociceptive sensation.
Cold pressor test
Tonic cold pain was elicited by the cold pressor test (Wolf and
Hardy, 1941) and pain onset and pain tolerance latencies
(in seconds) were determined. Subjects kept their non-domin-
ant hand fully immersed in a plastic box containing water at
37�C for 1 min, then immersed the same hand in another box
containing cold water (0–1�C) and ice grains, and kept it there
as long as possible (pain tolerance latency). During hand im-
mersion, the subjects reported when the sensation became
painful (pain threshold latency).
Mechanical threshold detection
A standard set of von Frey filaments, round tip �0.5 mm
(evaluator size 1.65–6.65; target force 0.008–300 g, Touch
Test Sensory Evaluators), were administered in ascending
and descending order five times (randomly) on the volar
surface of the non-dominant forearm in an area along the
midline, approximately midway from the wrist crease to
elbow crease. The subject was asked to communicate when a
touch sensation was perceived.
Mechanical pain threshold detection
A series of modified von Frey filaments with a sharp tip
(0.25 mm, target force 4.56–6.45 i.e. 4–180 g) able to activate
the cutaneous nociceptors (Rolke et al., 2006), were applied
till bending, in ascending and descending order five times
(randomly) on the volar part of the arm with a contact of
1 s. The subject was asked to quantify the intensity of the
painful/pleasurable sensation (VAS 0-100).
Capsaicin test
The volar surface of the non-dominant forearm in an area
along the midline, approximately midway from the wrist to
the elbow crease, an area of �4 cm2, was chosen for testing.
From the centre of this area, radial spokes were traced out
towards the periphery for �6 cm. The proband was invited
to fix her eyes on a precise point of the wall during each
test when requested.
Basal responsiveness in the area was measured first. For
touch evoked sensation, cotton wool was gently swept at a
rate of 1 cm/s along each radial spoke starting at the point
nearest to the elbow and moving to the centre point. The
proband was asked to report if the stimulus was nothing, tact-
ile,
unpleasant,
painful
or
other.
For
mechanical
pain
detection, the von Frey filament (6.45) was applied along
each radial spoke 1 cm apart (5 min after the cotton wool test).
Ten minutes later, a solution of capsaicin (0.250 mg capsaicin
in 250 ml saline) was injected intradermally (25 ml) into the
centre point of the map using a 0.5 ml insulin syringe using
a 28-gauge needle.
The subject was asked to report the onset of whichever sen-
sation and if painful to rate its intensity (VAS 0-100) and its
unpleasantness (VAS 0-100) and all changes across time in
order to build up the temporal profile. Cotton wool and von
Frey filaments were used as described above following capsa-
icin injection.
Skin biopsy
A punch skin biopsy was taken from 10 cm above the lateral
malleolus of the leg of the proband and fixed overnight with
2% periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde and preserved in sucrose
before blocked and processed into 50 mM sections. Nerve fibres
were stained using rabbit anti-PGP (protein gene product) 9.5
antibody (1:2000; Ultraclone Ltd) and Cy3 anti-rabbit (1:500;
Jackson Immunoresearch). By means of a Zeiss LSM 710 con-
focal microscope, z-stacks (2-mm intervals), maximum intensity
projections were generated with a Plan-Apochromat objective at
�20 magnification (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). Analysis
was performed as per published guidelines (Lauria et al., 2010).
PGP9.5-positive nerve fibres crossing the dermal-epidermal
junction were counted and intraepidermal nerve fibre density
counts are given in number of fibres per millimetre of skin.
Whole exome sequencing
For enrichment of exons and flanking intronic sequences we
used the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit and Exome
Enrichment Kit (Individuals III-1 and III-2) and the Agilent
Human SureSelect V4 kit (Individuals I-2, II-2, II-4 and
III-3). We performed 100 bp paired-end runs on a Genome
Analyzer HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina) generating sequences
of 2 (Individual III-1), 2.3 (Individual III-2), 6.0 (Individual
I-2),
7.4
(Individual
II-2),
6.9
(Individual
II-4) and
7.0
(Individual III-3) Gb. This amount of data resulted in the fol-
lowing percentages of targets being covered at 510�: 83.3
(Individual III-1), 83.1 (Individual III-2), 93.4 (Individual I-2),
98.3
(Individual
II-2),
98.1
(Individual
II-4)
and
98.5
(Individual III-3). Sequence alignment and variant calling was
performed against the reference human genome assembly
(hg19)
by
using
the
Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner
(Li
and
Durbin, 2009) and the Genome Analysis Toolkit (McKenna
et al., 2010; DePristo et al., 2011). Format conversion and
indexing were performed with the Picard software. Single nu-
cleotide variants and small insertions and deletions were
checked against established databases (1000 Genomes Project
and dbSNP v.142). Variants were further checked using the
ExAC browser, dbSNP v.147 and in our in-house database of
sequencing data for other diseases (n 4 2000). The protein
coding
effects
of
variants
was
predicted
using
SIFT,
PolyPhen-2 and M-CAP. Splicing changes were analysed
using the NNSPLICE Splice Site Predictor. Novel variants
were verified by Sanger sequencing and checked to see if
they segregated in all six affected individuals (primers available
on request).

 Animal behaviour tests
All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 with prior approval
under a Home Office project licence (PPL 70/7382). Mice were
kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided with food and
water ad libitum. Global Zfhx2 knockout mice were previ-
ously generated (Komine et al., 2012) and imported to the
UK from the RIKEN Bio Resource Center (BRC No. 02262:
B6.129S-Zfhx25tm3Ymri4). Zfhx2 p.R1907K BAC (bacter-
ial artificial chromosome) transgenic mice were generated by
Cyagen Biosciences Inc (further details in the Supplementary
material). Experiments were conducted using both male and
female wild-type littermate and knockout/transgenic mice, all
of which were at least 7 weeks old when tested. Observers
who performed behavioural experiments were blind to the
genotype of the animals. Mechanical nociceptive thresholds
were measured using a modified version of the Randall
Selitto test that applies pressure to the tail via a 3 mm2 blunt
conical probe with a 500-g cut-off (Randall and Selitto, 1957;
Minett et al., 2011). Touch perception was measured using the
up-down method for obtaining the 50% threshold using von
Frey hairs, as previously described (Chaplan et al., 1994;
Minett et al., 2011). Thermal nociceptive thresholds were
determined by measuring paw-withdrawal latency using the
Hargreaves’
apparatus
(Hargreaves
et
al.,
1988;
Minett
et al., 2011) with a ramp of 1.5�C/s and a 30-s cut-off and
also by use of the 50�C hot-plate test (Eddy and Leimbach,
1953). The response to mild cooling was measured using the
acetone evaporation test (Minett et al., 2011) and the response
to noxious cold measured using the cold plantar assay
(Brenner et al., 2012). The rotarod test was performed as
described in Stirling et al. (2005).
In vivo electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recordings were performed by an experi-
menter blind to genotype. Mice were anaesthetized with iso-
flurane (4%; 66% N2O and 33% O2) and secured in a
stereotaxic frame. Anaesthesia was reduced and maintained
at 1.5% isoflurane for the remaining duration of the experi-
ment. A laminectomy was performed to expose L3–L5 seg-
ments of the spinal cord and extracellular recordings were
made from wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the deep
dorsal horn (lamina III–V, 200–600 mm) using parylene-coated
tungsten electrodes (A-M Systems) in Zfhx2 knockout mice
and littermate controls. Mechanical stimuli were applied to
the peripheral receptive field of spinal neurons on the hindpaw
glabrous skin and the evoked activity of neurons was visua-
lized on an oscilloscope and discriminated on a spike ampli-
tude and waveform basis using a CED 1401 interface coupled
to Spike 2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK).
Mechanical stimuli (innocuous brush stroke and noxious
prods, 100 g/cm2 and 150 g/cm2) were applied in ascending
order of intensity to receptive fields for 10 s and the total
number of evoked spikes recorded.
Microarrays
Following euthanization by inhalation of CO2 and cervical dis-
location, lumbar DRGs (L1–L6) were isolated from five mice
bearing four genomic copies of the mutant Zfhx2 gene and
from seven wild-type controls. Total RNA was isolated using
the PureLink
TM RNA Micro Kit (Invitrogen) and run on the
GeneChip
Mouse
Transcriptome
Array
1.0
(Affymetrix).
Expression
data
were
analysed
using
the
Expression
and
Transcriptome Analysis Consoles (Affymetrix). Microarray data
have been deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus Array Express
for public use with reference number E-MTAB-5650.
Calcium imaging
Mouse DRG neurons were extracted and dissociated as previ-
ously described (Emery et al., 2016), and plated on poly-L-lysine
and laminin coated glass coverslips (13mm; size 0) and cultured
in
standard
cell
medium
(Dulbecco’s
modified
Eagle
medium + GlutaMAX
TM, Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% foetal bovine serum and nerve growth factor (50ng/ml).
For calcium imaging experiments, neurons were preincubated
with 5 mM fluo-4 AM (Life Technologies) in standard extracellu-
lar solution (in mM: 124 NaCl, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2
CaCl2, 5 glucose) for 30min at 37�C. After the preincubation,
neurons were washed in warmed standard extracellular solution
and placed into a laminar flow imaging chamber (Warner
Instruments). A gravity-fed perfusion system was used to continu-
ously perfuse the neurons throughout the experiment. Image ac-
quisition was performed using a confocal microscope (Leica SP8).
For fluo-4 AM excitation, a laser wavelength of 488nm was
used, and the images were acquired at a bidirectional scan
speed of 800Hz. Image analysis was performed using LAS-X
software (Leica).
Results
Clinical description
We studied a previously described family with a hypoalge-
sic phenotype in which six affected individuals have a his-
tory of painless injuries from childhood (Fig. 1A) (Spinsanti
et al., 2008). Bone fractures of the arms and legs are asso-
ciated with an absence of pain, or pain present only for a
few
seconds
and
sometimes
accompanied
by
fainting
(Supplementary Table 1). Notably, broken limbs can be
used without any painful sensations. The subjects did not
record the occurrence of these events immediately and for
this reason it is not clear if the time of healing was altered.
Burning stimuli are also frequently reported to be not pain-
ful, with consequent lesions noticed only by sight. All in-
dividuals have severe corneal hyporeflexia but without
corneal
scarring
and
with
normal
tear
production.
Sweating is scarce or absent in all affected individuals
and sensation of warm and cool temperatures is also re-
ported to be altered in five of six subjects, with occasional
episodes of hyperthermia (Spinsanti et al., 2008). While
cutaneous injuries and bone fractures are often neglected,
the pain insensitive phenotype is not global with, for ex-
ample, lower back pain and occasional headaches promptly
and fully perceived. Painful sensations were also noted
during childbirth. Sensory phenotype assessments showed
that
innocuous
light touch
stimuli could be
detected

 normally (Supplementary Table 1). Heat pain thresholds
were variable between tested individuals, with one individ-
ual particularly showing extreme insensitivity to noxious
heat (Supplementary Table 1). Cold pain thresholds are
also variable between individuals, ranging from hyperalge-
sia in one individual to a very high cold pain threshold and
tolerance in another (Supplementary Table 1). The proband
(Individual II-4 in Fig. 1A) reported no pain in the mech-
anical pain threshold detection tests and, interestingly, at
high
forces
a
sensation
of
pleasure
was
reported
(Supplementary Table 1). This is consistent with intense
deep pressure from massage being pleasurable, as also
noted
in
a
second
affected
member
in
the
family
(Individual III-3 in Fig. 1A). All affected individuals have
a low sensitivity to capsaicin as shown by their ability to
eat a large amount of hot pepper without any discomfort.
In the capsaicin test, carried out on the forearm, the pro-
band reported an immediate and very intense pain follow-
ing capsaicin injection that, unusually, abruptly (50–60 s)
disappeared (Supplementary Table 1). All patients self-
report of being able to perceive odours (SCN9A-associated
pain insensitive individuals are anosmic) although some
report a higher than normal sense of smell that is asso-
ciated with nausea and vomiting. All individuals have
normal cognitive abilities, display no evidence of distal
weakness nor joint abnormalities and exercise regularly.
A skin punch biopsy of the distal leg in the proband
followed by measurement of the intraepidermal nerve
fibre density showed normal fibre counts for age and
gender
(11.3
fibres/mm
using
immunofluorescence)
(Provitera et al., 2016), excluding the likelihood of a
small fibre neuropathy in the proband (Fig. 1B).
Whole exome sequencing
The phenotype segregated amongst the six affected individ-
uals within the family in a manner consistent with auto-
somal dominant inheritance (Fig. 1A). Exome sequencing
was performed for all six affected members to identify
the pathogenic variant. Following filtering and verification
by Sanger sequencing, two novel coding variants were
confirmed to co-segregate with the pain-insensitive pheno-
type:
SUPT3H
(NM_003599:c.G409A:p.A137T)
and
ZFHX2 (NM_033400:c.G5738A:p.R1913K). The variant
in SUPT3H is annotated as benign by both the M-CAP
and PolyPhen-2 (HumVar) tools and is also predicted to
not alter splicing (NNSPLICE). In contrast, the point mu-
tation in ZFHX2 (Fig. 1C) was indicated to be deleterious
(M-CAP, PolyPhen-2 and SIFT), was absent from public
SNP databases (1000 Genomes and dbSNP147) and the
ExAC and Institutional (UCL) exome datasets, and so
was prioritized for further analysis. ZFHX2 encodes a
large protein of 2572 amino acids (NP_207646) that com-
prises 17 zinc finger motifs, two of which are adjacent to
either side of the central PRDM9-like domain, and three
homeodomains
(Fig.
1D
and

 features common to transcriptional regulators (Komine
et al., 2006). The predicted PRDM9-like fold domain has
no common active site tyrosines essential for methyl trans-
ferase activity (Wu et al., 2013) but may still exhibit nu-
cleosome
binding
properties.
The
p.R1913K
mutation
identified in the pain-insensitive individuals maps within
the second homeodomain (Fig. 1D) and to a residue that
is invariant across all known orthologous Tetrapoda Zfhx2
genes (HomoloGene 52657) (Fig. 1E).
Zfhx2 knockout mice have altered
pain thresholds
Zfhx2 was cloned in 2006 and a global knockout mouse
was
reported
in
2012,
showing
several
behavioural
abnormalities, namely, hyperactivity, enhanced depression-
like behaviours, and an aberrantly altered anxiety-like
phenotype
(Komine
et
al.,
2006,
2012).
Zfhx2
was
shown to be highly expressed in the developing brain,
including the thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain and pon-
tine areas, with expression persisting in adult brain. Using
RT-PCR in adult wild-type mice, we found that Zfhx2 ex-
pression is enriched within DRGs (Fig. 2A) and immuno-
cytochemical analyses showed nuclear staining of ZFHX2
within peripherin-positive small diameter neurons (Fig. 2B).
We investigated whether Zfhx2 global knockout mice dis-
play an acute pain behavioural phenotype using a battery
of assays designed to test thermal and mechanical acute
pain
thresholds
(see
‘Materials
and
methods’
section,
Fig. 3A, B and Supplementary Fig. 2A–D). These showed
that the global knockout mice, compared to their wild-type
littermates, were significantly hyposensitive to noxious
mechanical stimuli applied to the tail but with normal sen-
sitivity to innocuous touch (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig.
2B). These data are supported by deep dorsal horn WDR
neuron recordings in Zfhx2 knockouts, which showed a
significant deficit in noxious mechanical coding compared
to littermate controls but no differences in response to dy-
namic low threshold stimuli (brush) (Fig. 3C). Interestingly,
in the hot-plate test the Zfhx2 knockout animals were
significantly hypersensitive to noxious heat (Fig. 3B), high-
lighting the importance of the nociceptor-expressed Zfhx2
gene in regulating both mechanical and thermal acute pain
thresholds.
ZFHX2 p.R1907K transgenic mice
are hyposensitive to noxious heat
To investigate the effects of the p.R1913K ZFHX2 mis-
sense mutation we cloned the full-length coding sequence
of the human gene (GenBank KY781180) and expressed
the wild-type (R1913) and the mutant (K1913) versions
in AD293 cells (Supplementary material). Both the wild-
type and mutant ZFHX2 proteins localized to the nucleus
in transiently transfected cells, indicating that the pheno-
type was unlikely to be caused by a subcellular trafficking
defect (Supplementary Fig. 3). Next, a BAC transgenic
mouse model was generated in which arginine-1907, the

nificantly higher in mice with the highest genomic BAC
copy number (four to five genomic copies) (Fig. 4B and
D). Furthermore, calcium imaging experiments conducted
on cultured DRG neurons from these mice showed that
they had a reduced response to capsaicin (1 mM) compared
to wild-type neurons (Fig. 4E–G). Immunohistochemical
analysis of lumbar (L4) DRGs isolated from adult BAC
transgenic mice showed no significant differences in the
number of peripherin-positive neurons compared to wild-
type controls, indicating that overexpression of mutant
ZFHX2 was not associated with a loss of small diameter
nociceptive neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Significant gene expression deregula-
tion in dorsal root ganglion neurons
from mutant mice
ZFHX2 is a putative transcriptional regulator and so we
studied the effects of the p.R1907K mutation on gene ex-
pression profiles in mice bearing four genomic copies of the
mutant Zfhx2 gene. Lumbar DRGs (L1–L6) were isolated
from mutant and wild-type controls and RNA analysed
using microarrays (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2).
Using
an
ANOVA

six
genes were upregulated more than 1.7-fold in mutant
DRGs versus controls. Sixteen genes were downregulated
more
than 1.7-fold
in
mutant
DRGs
versus
controls
(Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly a number of genes
in this list such as Gal, Sst, Gfra3, Ptgir and others are
known for their connection to pain signalling. To explore
whether the genes deregulated in DRGs as a result of
mutant Zfhx2 expression share any DNA sequence motifs
in common we performed a phylogenetic shadowing-based
approach (Bailey and Elkan, 1994) using promoter region
sequences from genes which showed at least a 1.2-fold

with

(Supplementary

Analysis of these genes yielded four common AG-rich

motifs are present in ZFHX2 DNA-binding regions we
used

(Supplementary

were Gfra3, Gal and Ptgir (Fig. 5B). One AG-rich motif

cation channel activity (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table
4). Interestingly, the motif was also present in genes
engaged in regulation of olfactory receptor activity and
sensory perception of smell. The differentially expressed
genes highlighted here, either alone or in combination,
potentially contribute to the pain insensitive phenotype.
Discussion
Chronic pain remains a severe clinical problem affecting
billions of people worldwide and despite the intense efforts
of the pharmaceutical industry, it is still poorly treated in
a significant number of patients (Nahin, 2015). The study
of families with monogenic pain insensitivity disorders
remains a powerful route to identify novel analgesic drug
targets (Goldberg et al., 2012). For example, since the dis-
covery of the first SCN9A loss of function mutations in
2006, significant progress has been made to help under-
stand why loss of function of Nav1.7 leads to complete
analgesia (Minett et al., 2015). This work is informing
drug development strategies on how to better reproduce
this phenotype pharmacologically, such as through the
combination of Nav1.7 channel blockers with low dose
opioids or enkephalinase inhibitors (Minett et al., 2015;
Deuis et al., 2017). NGF and TRK-A, previously shown
to be essential for the development of nociceptors, have
also since been realized to be useful analgesic targets with
anti-NGF drugs already showing great promise in clinical
trials (Holmes, 2012). The analgesic action of anti-NGFs is
related to the post-developmental importance of NGF in

 sensitizing nociceptors and thereby increasing the response
to noxious stimuli (Hirose et al., 2016).
Here we have studied a family with six members affected
with a pain insensitive phenotype, characterized by multiple
painless bone fractures and frequent painless lesions caused
by burning stimuli. Notwithstanding these injuries, all sub-
jects carried out a normal life and only occasionally had the
faint perception that something was different. It was called
Marsili syndrome, from the name of the family. Using
exome sequencing, we identified a novel coding mutation
in the ZFHX2 gene, which alters a strictly conserved argin-
ine to a lysine residue within the second homeodomain. The
full-length ZFHX2 protein contains three homeodomains,
DNA-binding regions typically 60 amino acids long, in add-
ition to 17 zinc-finger motifs and a PRDM9-like domain,
which is probably involved in nucleosome/histone binding,
indicating that ZFHX2 is likely to be a potent transcrip-
tional regulator. The mutated arginine is located at position
57 within the homeodomain. In the consensus homeodo-
main sequence, lysine-57 contacts with the DNA backbone
(Gehring et al., 1994; D’Elia et al., 2001). Although position
57 is often interchangeable between arginine and lysine in
different homeodomain-containing proteins, arginine-1913
in ZFHX2 is evolutionarily conserved in every sequenced
orthologue on the UCSC genome browser, highlighting the
likely functional importance of this residue. How this muta-
tion alters the function of ZFHX2 is still to be clarified, but
potentially it alters DNA binding affinity and/or transcrip-
tional specificity of mutant ZFHX2, which could involve a
post-translational modification at the mutation site and/or
altered protein-protein interactions with transcriptional part-
ners (Bobola and Merabet, 2017).
We have shown that the missense mutation in ZFHX2
causes a pain insensitive phenotype in humans and in the
BAC transgenic mouse model, with both displaying deficits
in responses to acute noxious heat. Furthermore, the af-
fected
family
members
are
hyposensitive
to
capsaicin
(Supplementary Table 1), which is consistent with the
reduced responses recorded by calcium imaging in DRG
neurons isolated from BAC transgenic mice (Fig. 4E–G).
Interestingly, the Zfhx2 null mouse is hypersensitive to
noxious heat and shows a deficit in the Randall-Selitto
test for noxious mechanical pain, linking the expression
of the transcription factor in sensory neurons with altered
nociceptive
processing.
However,
the

upstream regions (as indicated in right column) as analysed by ChIP-seq analysis.

 recapitulated by this particular mouse model. Furthermore,
the human individuals have additional symptoms that we
have yet to confirm in the transgenic mutant mice, such as
painless bone fractures, reduced sweating and pleasure
upon intense mechanical pressure. The differences in the
human and mouse phenotypes could be related to man–
mouse differences in ZFHX2 functions. Another explan-
ation is that in the transgenic mouse, two wild-type alleles
still exist that could be reducing the effect of expressing the
mutant ZFHX2 protein. This is a likely possibility since we
observed
that
the
heat-insensitive
phenotype
in
the
Hargreaves’ and hot-plate tests is enhanced in animals
with more genomic copies of the mutant gene (Fig. 4B
and D). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that
the observed phenotype in the BAC transgenic line is due to
overexpression of ZFHX2. Generation and analysis of a
ZFHX2 p.R1907K knockin mouse model and further be-
haviour tests should help to clarify the full extent of the
mouse
phenotype.
This
will
include
understanding
the variability in severity of symptoms, a feature noted in
the human family and which is not uncommon in other
dominantly inherited disorders.
ZFHX2 has enriched expression within DRGs, particu-
larly within the peripherin positive population of neurons,
and so we investigated if the pain insensitive phenotype was
due to a peripheral neuropathy. However, the intraepider-
mal nerve fibre density in a punch skin biopsy from the
proband and DRG cell counts in the BAC transgenic mice
were within normal ranges. Given the role of ZFHX2 as a
putative transcriptional regulator, we therefore assessed the
gene expression profiles in whole dorsal root ganglia of BAC
transgenic and wild-type animals to see if critical genes
within nociceptive neurons were affected by the mutation.
Several genes previously implicated in peripheral pain mech-
anisms
were
differentially
expressed
(Fig.
5
and
Supplementary Table 2). For example, somatostatin, which
is upregulated 42-fold in the DRGs from the mutant mice,
has proven anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in
experimental animals and can relieve pain in humans
(Mollenholt et al., 1994; Carlton et al., 2001; Helyes
et al., 2004; Pinter et al., 2006). Likewise, prostacyclin is
an important mediator of inflammation and pain (Bley et al.,
1998) and the mutant Zfhx2 mice have a 2.4-fold down-
regulation of the prostacyclin receptor, PTGIR. Antagonism
of this receptor and work in PTGIR-deficient mice have
shown reduced pain and inflammation in various rodent
models of acute and inflammatory pain (Murata et al.,
1997; Pulichino et al., 2006). Another gene significantly
downregulated in mutant DRG is Gfra3 (GDNF receptor
alpha 3), a gene that when knocked out in mice, results in
hyposensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli in the Hargreaves’
and tail-flick tests (Murota et al., 2012). Galanin (Gal), the
gene most downregulated in mutant DRGs, plays a complex
role in pain signalling, with both facilitatory and inhibitory
effects on nociceptive processing (Holmes et al., 2003).
Which of the above genes or any of the other less character-
ized DRG-expressed genes (e.g. Fam89a) are principally
responsible for the pain-insensitive phenotype remains to
be determined. As the microarrays reflect an average snap-
shot of multiple types of neurons within DRG, some genes
may be deregulated more significantly in specific types of
neurons. Thus, although we see strong changes for a
group of genes we cannot exclude that some other interest-
ing and important genes also contribute to the phenotype
despite low fold changes in the current analysis of the whole
DRG. Gene expression analyses in whole DRG and specific
neuron populations within the DRG, and perhaps in brain
regions such as the thalamus, in a knockin mouse model
should help us focus on potential downstream analgesic
drug targets. It remains possible that the pain insensitivity
results from a combined effect of deregulating several genes,
and in this scenario the mutant ZFHX2 gene itself, perhaps
via intrathecal AAV delivery, could offer a potential route
for providing pain relief.
The microarray analyses were complemented by ChIP-seq
experiments in human neuroblastoma cells stably express-
ing the mutant ZFHX2 protein. These experiments identi-
fied a likely consensus genomic binding motif for ZFHX2
that was present upstream of several of the deregulated
genes identified in the DRG microarray (including Ptgir,
Gal and Gfra3). Interestingly, gene ontology searches
showed this AG-rich motif was present in gene families
functionally engaged in neuropeptide signalling. Similarly,
a dominant point mutation in the homologous Zfhx3 gene
was also shown to alter neuropeptide gene expression, in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in a mouse model with accel-
erated circadian locomotor rhythms (Parsons et al., 2015).
Furthermore, the gene ontology searches for the ZFHX2
AG-rich motif also identified genes engaged in regulation
of olfactory receptor activity and sensory perception of
smell. Given this and the known expression of Zfhx2 in
the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2A and Allen Brain Atlas), together
with the heightened sense of smell reported in some mem-
bers of the human family, it is likely that mutant ZFHX2
may be important for olfaction as well as nociceptive pro-
cessing. An analogy here is Nav1.7, which has a critical role
in nociceptive and olfactory signalling with recessive loss of
function mutations causing pain insensitivity and anosmia
(Cox et al., 2006; Weiss et al., 2011). Importantly, there is
no apparent link between other genes implicated in herit-
able loss of pain such as NTRK1/TRK-A, NGF or SCN9A
and the deregulated genes found in the ZFHX2 microarray
analysis. This suggests an entirely novel mechanism is
involved in conferring a pain-insensitive phenotype in the
family studied here.
In summary, genetic analysis of a human family with
Marsili syndrome, a rare and perhaps unique inherited
pain insensitive phenotype, and mouse modelling have
shown ZFHX2 as a critical gene for normal pain percep-
tion. Further work will resolve how the deregulated DRG-
expressed genes contribute to the hypoalgesic phenotype
and will help to determine which ones are feasible analgesic
drug targets that could lead to better treatments for chronic
pain.
