FDA regulations require safety testing of constituent ingredients in drugs (21 CFR 610.15). With the exception of
extraneous proteins, no component safety testing is required for vaccines or vaccine schedules. The dosing of
aluminum in vaccines is based on the production of antibody titers, not safety science. Here we estimate a
Pediatric Dose Limit that considers body weight. We identify several serious historical missteps in past analyses
of provisional safe levels of aluminum in vaccines, and provide updates relevant to infant aluminum exposure in
the pediatric schedule considering pediatric body weight. When aluminum doses are estimated from Federal
Regulatory Code given body weight, exposure from the current vaccine schedule are found to exceed our esti-
mate of a weight-corrected Pediatric Dose Limit. Our calculations show that the levels of aluminum suggested by
the currently used limits place infants at risk of acute, repeated, and possibly chronic exposures of toxic levels of
aluminum in modern vaccine schedules. Individual adult exposures are on par with Provisional Tolerable
Weekly Intake “limits”, but some individuals may be aluminum intolerant due to genetics or previous exposures.
Vaccination in neonates and low birth-weight infants must be re-assessed; other implications for the use of
aluminum-containing vaccines, and additional limitations in our understanding of neurotoxicity and safety le-
vels of aluminum in biologics are discussed.
1. Introduction
Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in vaccines licensed by the US
Food and Drug Administration [1–7] to enhance the immunogenicity of
the vaccine in various forms (e.g., aluminum oxyhydroxide and alu-
minum hydroxyphosphate) [9,10] (Fig. 1). The Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (CBER) sets the amount of aluminum per dose
in biological products, including vaccines, to 850 μg aluminum if
measured by assay. Two additional levels are specified by the regula-
tions (1140 and 1250 μg respectively), depending on how the level is
measured [8].
The 850 μg of aluminum per vaccine FDA amount was derived from
data that demonstrated that this amount of aluminum per dose en-
hanced the antigenicity and effectiveness of the vaccine [9,10], but
does not include safety considerations. Current amounts of aluminum
are not adjusted to body weight of an infant. To avoid toxicity asso-
ciated with variation in body weight between adults and children re-
lated to aluminum in vaccines, standard of care dose levels convert mg
to mg/kg for the weight range being considered [28,39]. At the current
time, there are no known or published studies specifically defining le-
vels of Al in any vaccine product based on safety studies of Al.
Safety for aluminum from all sources is based on the No Observed
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), Minimal Risk Level (MRL), and the
Lowest Observed Affect Level (LOAEL) [15–20]. The Joint Expert
Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) established a Provisional
Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) for aluminum to be 7000 μg/kg
body weight per week in 1989, which applies to all aluminum
compounds in food, including additives. That level remained in effect
until 2011 when the PTWI was revised to 2000 μg Al/kg per week
[12,13]. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) had used an MRL of 1000 μg Al/kg per day (7000 μg/
kg per week) [24–27].
We found two important errors in the provenance and derivation of
provisional aluminum intake levels from World Health Organization
(WHO; Supplementary Material) which, unfortunately, led to over-
estimation of safe exposure levels.
Here we consider adjusted child equivalent aluminum doses (CED)
in vaccines by body weight, to determine putative pediatric dose limits

T
 (PDLs) of aluminum estimated by Clark’s Rule for the pediatric popu-
lation, to investigate further the effect those discrepancies that exist
between the JECFA and ATSDR may have regarding the MRL of alu-
minum in biologics, and to compare relative dosing from dietary and
injected sources in the pediatric population.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. FDA dose amounts of aluminum adjusted by body weight in infants and
adults
FDA regulations require that proteins in vaccines be tested for
safety. Aluminum is a known neurotoxin and it is unfortunate that
additives in vaccines are not required to be subjected to animal safety
studies prior to use on human subjects. Several known methods exist for
pediatric dosing by weight. In Clark’s Rule [28–39] of pediatric dose
calculations, for example, the adult body weight reference is usually (as
published) considered to be 150 bs. (68 kg) with the calculated dose
being converted to mg/kg.
Aluminum toxicity studies use 60 kg as the reference adult body
weight to calculate the MRL and LOAEL [16–18]. For that reason, we
used 60 kg as the adult body weight reference rather than the more
commonly used 68 kg adult body weight reference in Clark’s Rule of
pediatric calculations. Our calculations are thus consistent with past
aluminum toxicity studies [16–18], and more comparable to the toxi-
cities at the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) and Lowest
Observed Adverse Effects Level (LOAEL).
Each of the established FDA-approved doses of 850 μg, 1140 μg, and
1250 μg were converted to the equivalent dose expressed in mg/kg
using Clark’s Rule [28,39]:

×
Child s Dose
Adult Dose

The body weights for infants from birth through 24 months used in
the Clark’s Rule calculation were obtained using calculated monthly
growth velocities obtained from Weight for Age standards in males and
females from the 5th to the 95th percentile [40,41]. The resulting pe-
diatric doses were compared to the same doses in an adult also adjusted
by the body weight of 60 kg.
2.2. Minimal risk level of aluminum in children
Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) are usually derived for hazardous
substances using the NOAEL/uncertainty factor approach [16,17] to
avoid toxicities [21]. The resulting exposures using the adjusted body
weight calculations are presented by plotting the calculated MRL in
children against the FDA doses of 850 μg adjusted by body weight at the
50th percentile in children birth through 24 months.
We estimated the human equivalent dose (HED) [11,20,21] in a
child first obtaining the adult HED using the equation
HED = Animal dose NOAEL (mg/kg) × [Animal weight (kg)/Human
Fig. 1. Pediatric Vaccine Schedule 2016–2017.
The CDC schedule reflects the expected timing of administration of vaccines containing aluminum (shaded light yellow) as adjuvant at birth, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 months. The total amount
of aluminum per vaccine visit (green shaded box below each scheduled interval) is reported from birth through 24 months.

 weight (kg)](1−BSA exponent 0.67)
The HED of the NOAEL/MRL may be calculated using a Km ratio or
Rule of Exponents equation [21] with a provisional additional safety
factor of 10 applied. The results of these two calculations differ sig-
nificantly. The anatomic compartment from which exogenous alu-
minum is absorbed also needs to be taken into consideration (intestinal
vs. intramuscular).
The animal dose reference used by the ATSDR is 260 μg/kg and the
reference animal weight of the mouse is 0.02 kg [15]. The adult human
body weight reference used was 60 kg to be consistent with the pre-
vious ATSDR calculations of MRL [16,17]. A safety factor of 10 is ap-
plied to the final calculation of the adult HED to obtain the Minimal
Risk Level (MRL) for an adult human [21].
To obtain the Child Equivalent Dose (CED) of the adult MRL, we
multiplied the MRL(adult) by the body weight ratio between child and
adult:
CED (mg/kg) = HED(adult) mg/kg × BW(child) (kg)/BW(adult) (kg)
Additionally, we calculated the pediatric equivalent of the daily
provisional tolerable intake using the JECFA adult reference of 286 μg
(2 μg/kg per week JECFA provisional tolerable weekly intake divided
by 7 days converted to micrograms) to establish a revised and corrected
provisional tolerable daily intake from the weekly intake adjusted by
the BW of the child at the 5th through the 95th percentile from birth to
24 months. It should be recalled that animal levels (ATSDR and JECFA
MRL) contributing to these revised estimated levels were based on
enteral (dietary) exposures, and in adult animals.
The only available safety dosing reference point for for large—and
small—volume parenteral exposures of aluminum is from CFR/FDA
21CFR201.323 from intravenous exposure. That safety limit is placed at
4–5 μg/kg/day, without reference to duration of treatment and applies
to individuals with renal dysfunction, a condition that is very common
among premature infants.
3. Results
3.1. FDA doses adjusted by body weight in infants and adults
Each of the FDA doses for aluminum (850 μg, 1100 μg, and 1250 μg)
were divided by the daily body weights per percentile weight class by
age from birth to 2 years and expressed as μg/kg. Similarly, these same
dose limits were divided by the adult body weights of 60 kg for com-
parison (μg/kg).
3.2. FDA 850 μg dose adjusted by body weight in infants and adults
If infants were given 850 μg of aluminum (injected), the exposure
would vastly exceed the only available CFR/FDA 4–5 μg/kg/day safety
limit (Fig. 2). Compared to an adult whose body weight is 60 kg, a male
child at birth receives 254 μg/kg, 152.7 μg/kg at 2 months, 121.4 μg/kg
at 4 months, 107.1 μg/kg at 6 months, 92.8 μg/kg at 1 year, and
69.9 μg/kg at 2 years as compared to 12.5-14.2 μg/kg in an adult. A
female child whose body weight is generally less than the male receives
a slightly higher burden of aluminum comparatively. At the 50th per-
centile body weight, a male child at birth receives 1800% more alu-
minum per body weight as compared to a 60-kg adult male, 1074.6% at
2 months, 954.9% at 4 months, 754.2% at 6 months, 876% at 1 year,
and 493% at 2 years of age more aluminum per body weight as com-
pared to a 60-kg adult (Table 1, Fig. 2).
3.3. FDA 1140 μg dose adjusted by body weight in infants and adults
Compared to an adult whose body weight is 60 kg, a male child at
birth receives 340.7 μg/kg, 204.8 μg/kg at 2 months, 162.8 μg/kg at 4
months, 143.7 μg/kg at 6 months, 124.4 μg/kg at 1 year, and 93.8 μg/
kg at 2 years as compared to 16.8-19.0 μg/kg in an adult. Similarly, a
female child whose body weight is generally less than the male receives
a slightly higher burden of aluminum comparatively.
3.4. FDA 1250 μg dose adjusted by body weight in infants and adults
Compared to an adult whose body weight is 60 kg, a male child at
birth receives 373.5 μg/kg, 224.5 μg/kg at 2 months, 178.5 μg/kg at 4
months, 157.5 μg/kg at 6 months, 136.4 μg/kg at 1 year, and 102.9 μg/
kg at 2 years as compared to 18.4-20.8 μg/kg in an adult. Similarly, a
female child whose body weight is generally less than the male receives
a slightly higher burden of aluminum comparatively.
3.5. Comparison of FDA dose adjusted by body weight between infants and
adults
To define an appropriate modification in the amount of aluminum
per dose in a pediatric vaccine, and separate from the previous HED
based upon the MRL, we applied Clark's Rule at both 68 kg and 60 kg to
the 850 μg FDA dose by assay (0.85 mg per dose by assay). The calcu-
lated 850 μg per dose at the 50th percentile is lower when converting
the adult body weight reference to 60 kg, the adult body weight typi-
cally used in toxicity studies (Fig. 3).
At birth, and in consideration of Clark’s Rule in pediatric dosing
(Adult BW = 68 kg), these calculations, based on assumptions, suggest
that a child at the 50th percentile BW should receive no more than
44 μg/kg. That modification in the actual amount of aluminum per dose
of a pediatric vaccine (or vaccines per day) should be at or below the
current adult-based, diet-based MRL. Unfortunately, that would exceed
the calculated MRL of 10.31 μg/kg at birth, and 37.48 μg/kg at 2 years
of age.
3.6. Aluminum daily minimal risk level (MRL) in children, all sources with
applied safety factor
In an adult weighing 60 kg whereby the human Km is 37 and mouse
Km is 3 (Km ratio = 0.081), the Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 26 mg Al/
kg mouse dose (26) would be 26 × 0.081 = 2.11 mg/kg/day. Applying
the safety factor of 10 would correct the MRL to 0.21 mg/kg/day, not
1 mg/kg/day. The application of an additional safety factor of 10 is the
accepted final step prior to establishing first dose during trial dosing
12,13,15-20].
The Km in an 8-year-old child weighing 20 kg is 25 [15]. The cal-
culated pediatric HED of the Minimal Risk Level (MRL)/NOAEL using
the Km ratio formula would be 26 mg/kg times 0.12 (Km ratio = 3/25)
divided by the safety factor of 10 would result in an HED of 3.12 mg Al/
kg before a safety factor of 10 is applied using the Km ratio. With the
safety factor of 10, the estimated MRL would be 312 μg Al/kg/day in an
8-year-old child weighing 20 kg. That would effectively lower the
ATSDR MRL estimate from 1000 μg Al/kg day to 312 μg Al/kg/day by a
factor of 3.2 with the safety factor applied.
Without a provisional safety factor, the MRL would be greater than
the ATSDR provisional tolerable daily intake of 1 mg Al/kg per day, but
less than the JECFA provisional tolerable daily intake of 290 μg Al/kg
which is a concern. With the safety factor of 10, the estimated MRL in
the pediatric population (< 8 years of age) is less than the 500 μg/kg
body weight from all sources including additives range 100–350 μg/day
identified in the JECFA report regarding children 2 years of age.
3.7. MRL based upon rule of Exponents/Safety factor of 10
In consideration that the HED calculated by the Km ratio may not be
appropriate for use in intramuscular exposures [22,23], we used the
Rule of Exponents equation [21]
HED = Animal dose NOAEL (mg/kg) × [Animal weight (kg)/Human

69
 weight (kg)](1−BSA exponent 0.67)
In an adult weighing 60 kg, the calculated HED using the above
equation would be 1850 μg/kg without a safety factor of 10. Applying
the safety factor of 10 would result in the HED (MRL) of 185 μg/kg,
significantly lower than the current ATSDR MRL/NOAEL of 1000 μg Al/
kg/day. This approximates the corrected 2007 JECFA calculation of
140 μg/kg/day (PTWI of 1000 μg Al/kg per week).
We do not mean to imply this level exposure is safe for pediatric
injection. The corresponding HED in a child should take into con-
sideration
the
ratio
of
the
BW(child)/BW(adult),
such
that
MRL(child) = Adult MRL(mg/kg) X BW(child)/BW(adult).
At birth, for 50th percentile body weight males the daily MRL would
be 16.01 μg/kg/day (0.01601 mg/kg/day) and 58.12 μg/kg/day at 2
years (See Supplemental Files). As expected, a female child would have
a corrected value of 15.46 μg/kg/day at birth and 54.9 μg/kg/day at 24
months. In a child, that recalculated MRL would be less than the 1989
JECFA provisional tolerable daily intake from dietary and additive
exposures of 140 μg/kg/day and current provisional tolerable daily
intake of 290 μg/kg/day per day both before and after the safety factor
of 10 is applied (Fig. 3).
As an example, using a specific vaccine, the weight-adjusted MRLs
and aluminum exposures from DTaP vaccine (with 625 μg aluminum
per dose) show exposures in children at 2 months that vastly exceed the
dietary adult mouse-derived MRL considering body weight (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
Aluminum in various forms is commonly used as an adjuvant in
many vaccines licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration
[1–7]. In 2002, the scheduled childhood vaccines that included
aluminum as an adjuvant were limited to Diphtheria-Pertussis-Te-
tanus (DPT) and Hepatitis B (HepB). The amount of aluminum per
vaccine dose ranged from 250 μg/dose (HepB) to 625 μg/dose (DPT).
In 2016, however, the number of individual pediatric vaccines con-
taining aluminum as adjuvant from birth to 36 months has increased
significantly and ranges from 250 to 625 μg/dose [3–6] (Table 1;
Fig. 1). Those vaccines, which contain aluminum as an adjuvant to
increase antigenicity [33,34] include Hepatitis B (HepB)[2], Diph-
theria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis (DTaP) [3], Haemophilus influ-
enza B (HiB) [4], Hepatitis A (HepA) [5], and pneumococcal con-
jugate (PCV13) [6]. Here, we further discuss the background and
provenance of the derivation of aluminum doses, issues that may be
currently causing unanticipated dose-related toxicity.
The FDA referenced doses of 850 μg, 1140 μg, and 1250 μg have not
been estimated considering body weight of the pediatric population,
nor do they necessarily directly reflect established non-toxic doses in
that population prior to this report. The current aluminum amounts in
vaccines are not sufficiently characterized: the doses of aluminum used
in vaccines, and the per day exposure that results from the CDC vaccine
schedule, are not determined based on animal dose escalation safety
(NOAEL) studies. They are also determined considering neither injected
dose-related toxicity, nor mass differences between adults and infants.
This issue must be addressed.
Our results demonstrate that the aluminum exposure from vaccines
would exceed the calculated Pediatric Dose Limit, or PDL 850 μg alu-
minum/dose by assay, when corrected to 44 μg by Clark’s Rule esti-
mated from the FDA adult dose of 850 μg/dose (850 μg x BW(child) 3.35/
BW(Adult) 68 kg) at birth, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 months. It must be empha-
sized that at birth, only the aluminum content in the HepB vaccine is
under consideration. Only at 6.5 months does the combined aluminum
Fig. 2. FDA Doses and exposures adjusted by body weight: Comparison between Infants and an Adult.
In a male child from birth through 36 months at the 50th percentile body weight, the FDA dose of 850 μg adjusted by body weight demonstrates that an adult weighing 60 kg receives
significantly less aluminum per injection per kg compared to a child, particularly those children with lower body weights.

 level fall below the 1140 and 1250 μg/kg calculated dose level at the
50th percentile body weight. This is a clearly significant concern for the
current vaccine schedule, especially in the context of the recommended
(and increasingly strongly enforced) time intervals at birth, 2, 4, and 6
months.
All individual doses are at or below the FDA dose of 850 μg/dose by
assay.
However,
when
administered
simultaneously
at
the
re-
commended CDC schedule, the “limit” is significantly exceeded if not
modified in accordance with standard pediatric dose calculations.
These doses are given regardless of body weight. The product data sheet
for DTaP states, for example:
“Each 0.5-mL dose contains aluminum salts as adjuvant not more
than 0.85 mg (850 μg) aluminum by assay”
When adjusted to body weight (μg/kg) and compared to a 60–68 kg
adult, the aluminum load is significantly higher in the birth through 24-
month age cohort.
The scheduled pediatric vaccinations in 2016 have significantly
expanded since 2002, and the amount of aluminum per vaccine dose,
particularly the use of TDaP, has changed. The combined doses of
aluminum at 2, 4, and 6 months are 1225 μg, 975 μg, and 1225 μg re-
spectively (Table 2), and are not determined considering infant and
Fig. 3. MRL Males and Females, Birth-24 years (5th-95th Percentile Body Weight).
The most recent daily JECFA MRL of 287 μg/kg/day in a child from birth through 24 months (729 days) was calculated by multiplying the daily Child BW/Adult BW ratio using a
referenced adult body weight of 60 kg and the daily child body weight at the 5th-95th percentile. The final calculation is expressed in μg/kg/day (Y-axis). The 50th percentile body weight
daily calculation is demonstrated with the orange line (see Legend at bottom of graph).

When

body
weight
(BW(child)) obtained from the CDC growth data sheets, the individual
aluminum levels (μg/kg) in the HepB, DTaP, Hib, and PCV vaccines
remain below the limits of 850 μg/kg, 1440 μg/kg, and 1225 μg/kg at
birth. However, at 2.5 months, 4.5 months, and 6.5 months, the com-
bined aluminum levels (μg/kg) in the scheduled DTaP, HiB, and PCV
vaccines exceed the FDA 850 μg limit by a factor of 1.15.
4.1. The PTWI propagated error
In our review of the provenance of information on Al limits, we
discovered an unfortunate but serious error in the calculation in the
MRL. The JECFA established a PTWI for aluminum to be 7000 μg/kg
body weight per week in 1989. The PTWI applied to all aluminum
compounds in food, including additives which remained in effect until
2011. The provisional tolerable daily intake (all sources) would there-
fore have been around 1000 μg/kg/day.
From 1989 to 2011, the MRL was reported to be 1000 μg/kg/day
from all sources. That number was withdrawn in 2011, therefore the
total provisional tolerable daily intake should be currently 0.29 mg Al/
kg per day, based upon the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI)
of 2 mg Al/kg week as expressed by the Joint Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization
(FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2011.
In 1996, the Committee on Nutrition in their article on aluminum
neurotoxicity in children reported the 1989 JECFA provisional tolerable
weekly intake of 1000 μg/kg [12] as a provisional daily intake [14]. Un-
fortunately, that error overestimates the provisional tolerable daily intake
of aluminum from all sources in adults by a factor of at least 2. As the
1000 μg/kg/week PTWI was in fact replaced with a PTWI of 2000 μg/kg/
week in 2011, the daily provisional tolerable intake should be around
286 μg/kg per day, and in consideration that the highest mean intake of a
child at 2 years is 500 μg/kg per day [15]. The value 1000 μ/kg/day
would seem to bring the 850 μg per dose into range, but it is off by a factor
of at least 2 and perhaps seven. The role of the reliance on the incorrect
PTWI on public health may be significant, especially for infants, especially
for low-birthweight infants and those born prematurely.
By our calculations, and in consideration of the route of exposure
using the Rule of Exponents to calculate the HED, the correct daily (all
sources, all doses) MRL in the pediatric population should have been
determined to be no more than 10.31-16.01 μg/kg per day at birth to
58.12 μg/kg per day at 2 years of age. Current exposures from pediatric
vaccines exceed these levels; for a median weight (US) 3.3 kg male,
HepB vaccine with 250 μg leads to 75.75 μg/kg/day. The two-month
vaccination visit repeats the excess. Excess exposures in low birth-
weight and neonatal infants is obviously even more problematic. The
use of HepB vaccine in a 2-kg infant (FDA’s unofficial cut-off for vac-
cination in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NICU) leads to 150 μg/kg/
day. Vaccination practices in the NICU must be revisited.
Our results demonstrate that the aluminum load from vaccines
would exceed the estimated PDL 850 μg aluminum/dose by assay, when
corrected to 47.4 μg by Clark’s Rule estimated from the Federal adult
dose limit of 850 μg/dose (850 μg x BW(child)3.35 kg/BW(Adult) 68 kg) at
birth to 24 months. The adjusted dose limits would still be higher than
the calculated MRL per day.
The NOAEL and LOAEL have been established to reduce the in-
cidence of known harmful neurotoxic effects and are based on studies of
adult mice using poorly-absorbed, ingested aluminum not highly-ab-
sorbed injected aluminum. The entire paradigm to aluminum dosing in
vaccines has not been determined considering body weight, based on
NOAEL (not the LOAEL), which is more in line with the universal
standard medical practices during pediatric dosing [28,39]. These
should be calculated per child given their body weight prior to vacci-
nation, and daily limits placed on total aluminum injected considering
all doses and all sources. However, even when the appropriate and
necessary adjustments are made, our results predict an increased risk of
neurotoxicity from birth through 36 months particularly when the ac-
cumulating body burden is taken into consideration at every scheduled
vaccine interval. Although not considered in this current analysis, we
are aware that the accumulated aluminum body burden at each vac-
cination interval will be higher than an individual aluminum level in a
single vaccine. This is because there will be a retained body burden
fraction of aluminum resulting from the previous dosing intervals
considering body weight (in progress) that needs to be considered,
particularly in consideration of potential toxicities.
Mitkus et al. [32]'s calculations were based on the day/week pro-
pagated error. Mitkus et al. [32] published their study in 2011 when the
PTWI was still at 1 mg/kg, further propagating the day/week error.
Thus, current assessments of aluminum accumulation from vaccination
and dietary exposures are not correct. Some dietary sources contain
unacceptably high levels of aluminum, such as certain brands of anta-
cids. Concerned individuals can exercise consumer choice and avoid
food products that include aluminum.
While the effect of our proposed reduction on the final antigenicity
of the vaccine is unknown, the full effects of the high injected doses of
aluminum on the developing brain are also unknown. Indications of
accumulation of aluminum associated with autism were recently pub-
lished [42] in which the majority of tissue samples from post-mortem
brains of patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were
found to contain high concentrations of aluminum. Many samples
contained extremely high concentrations, and the study also localized
aluminum in glial cells in the brain, consistent with aluminum-induced
gliosis models of neurodevelopmental disorders.

The study and publication costs were funded by public donations to
The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a pure public charity
registered Not-For-Profit research organization.
Conflict of interest
RR has no real or potential conflict of interest. JLW has a potential
conflict of interest as he has consulted on two vaccine injury cases on
behalf of complainants.
