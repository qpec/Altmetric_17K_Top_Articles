We aimed to investigate whether health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is associated with retinal 
vascular caliber, an indicator of subclinical cardiovascular disease risk. 1600 students aged between 
11–19 years (821 girls and 779 boys) were examined during 2009–2011. Retinal vessel caliber was 
measured from digital retinal images. HRQoL was assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
(PedsQL). In the overall cohort, each 1-unit increase in PedsQL total score and the psychosocial 
summary score was associated with ~0.05 μ
m narrowing in retinal arteriolar caliber (multivariable-
adjusted p-value = 0.01). Participants in the lowest versus highest tertile of PedsQL total score, 
psychosocial summary, social and school item scores had significantly wider retinal arteriolar caliber: 
161.7 μ
m versus 160.2 μ
m (p = 0.02); 161.6 μ
m versus 160.0 μ
m (p = 0.02); 161.6 μ
m versus 159.9 μ
m 
(p = 0.002); and 161.6 μ
m versus 159.9 μ
m (p = 0.01), respectively. Significant interactions (p < 0.05) 
were observed between gender and PedsQL total score with retinal arteriolar calibre. In boys, inverse 
associations were observed between PedsQL total score (p = 0.01), psychosocial summary (p = 0.01), 
and social scores (p = 0.01) and retinal arteriolar caliber. No significant associations were observed 
between PedsQL scores and retinal vessel caliber in girls. Diminished HRQoL in adolescents was 
independently associated with structural retinal microvascular changes.
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) refers to the subset of quality of life directly related to an individual’s 
health1, which as defined by the World Health Organization includes physical, mental, and social well-being2,3. 
Recent studies have shown a significant influence of HRQoL on long-term outcomes. For instance, poor HRQoL 
has been shown to be a marker of morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease, even after 
controlling for traditional vascular risk factors4–6. Moreover, HRQoL has also been reported to be associated with 
several cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity7,8, diabetes9 and smoking10.
Microvascular abnormality may underlie the association between subsets of HRQoL, particularly mental well-
being, and vascular disease11–13. The retina offers a readily accessible site to non-invasively evaluate the microcir-
culation and is a recognized marker of early subclinical vascular disease14. Reliable methods of quantifying retinal 
microvascular changes from retinal photographs have been developed15, and subtle changes in the retinal vas-
culature may mirror pre-clinical structural changes in both the cerebral16 and coronary microcirculations17, and 
thus, could have prognostic information useful for predicting clinical cardiovascular events18. Further, structural 
retinal microvascular changes have shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors, including 
obesity and hypertension19,20.
While studies in adults and adolescents have shown that depression and anxiety symptoms are associated 
with measurable signs in the retinal microvasculature11–13; there have been no population-based studies that 
have examined the associations between overall HRQoL and retinal vessel caliber in either adults or children. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess the cross-sectional relationship between HRQoL (exposure) and retinal vessel 
caliber (study outcome) using a large cohort of adolescents. We hypothesize that lower HRQol scores is inde-
pendently associated with modest structural retinal microvascular changes in adolescents. Hence, the epidemio-
logical data from this study will help elucidate whether microvasculature structural alterations might be involved 
in the early mechanisms leading to cardiovascular disease and impaired HRQoL in later life.

Participants and Methods
Study Population. 
The Sydney Childhood Eye Study is a population-based survey of eye conditions in 
school children living within the Sydney Metropolitan Area, Australia. It was approved by the Human Research 
Ethics Committee, University of Sydney, the Department of Education and Training, and Catholic Education 
Office, New South Wales, Australia21. We obtained informed written consent from at least one parent of each 
child, as well as verbal assent from each child before the examinations. Study methods have been previously 
described21. All methods in this study were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. 
Briefly, Year 1 students from a stratified random cluster sample of 34 primary schools across Sydney (6–7 years of 
age) were eligible to participate. Data for the 6-year-old cohort (n = 1740) were collected during 2003–2004; and 
of these 1125 (64.7%) were followed up 5 years later i.e. aged 11–12 years. Also, students in Year 7 (12–13 years 
of age) in a stratified random cluster sample of 21 high schools across Sydney were eligible to participate. Data 
for this 12-year-old cohort (n = 2353) were collected during 2004–2005. Of the baseline participants 12 years of 
age, 1217 (51.7%) were resurveyed 5 years later (during 2009–2011), and includes children 16–19 years of age. 
Additional participants (n = 475) aged 17–18 years were recruited when we visited the same schools as in the 
baseline survey. Therefore, the total number of participants surveyed at the 5-year follow-up was 2817; compris-
ing 1125 participants aged 11–12 and 1692 participants aged 16–19 years. Information on retinal vessel caliber 
was collected at baseline and follow-up surveys; however, health-related HRQoL was collected only at the 5-year 
examination. Therefore, the current study reports on cross-sectional data obtained from the 5-year survey only.
Assessment of HRQoL. 
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 was used to assess HRQoL 
in preadolescents and adolescents and was only administered at the 5-year follow-up. The PedsQL is a validated 
23-item questionnaire for children aged 2 to 18 years22, which takes students approximately 5–7 minutes to com-
plete. The self-reported version of PedsQL was used in this study. Students reported how much of a problem they 
are experiencing in each of the PedsQL items in the past one month and mean scores were calculated based on 
a 5-point response scale for each item: (i) 0 - if it is never a problem; (ii) 1 - if it is almost never a problem; (iii) 
2 - if it is sometimes a problem; (iv) 3 – if it is often a problem; and (v) 4 – if it is almost always a problem. Mean 
scores are then transformed to a 0 to 100 scale with a higher score representing better HRQoL. The PedQL yields 
3 summary scores: a total scale score, a physical health summary score and a psychosocial health summary score. 
There are 4 sub-scale scores: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school func-
tioning. The total score is comprised of the average of all items in the questionnaire. The psychosocial summary is 
an average of the items in the emotional, social and school functioning scales. The physical health summary score 
comprises the average of items in the physical functioning scale22.
Retinal Photography and Analysis. 
Children had dilated, digital photographs taken of the optic disk and 
macula of both eyes using a Canon 60UVID10 fundus camera (Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). For this study, retinal 
vascular caliber measurements for the right eye of each child were used. Left eye measurements were used when, 
occasionally, the photographs of the right eye were not gradable. One grader, masked to participant identity and 
characteristics, measured retinal vessel width using a computer-assisted program (Retinal Analysis, University 
of Wisconsin) with high reproducibility15,23. The six largest arteriolar and venular diameters measured for each 
eye, were then summarized as central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) or central retinal venular equivalent 
(CRVE), respectively, using a formula developed by Knudtson-Hubbard24.
Assessment of Covariates. 
Parents were asked to complete a comprehensive 193-item questionnaire (at 
baseline and follow-up), from which socio-demographic information including ethnicity, and highest level of 
parental education was collected. Data were collected during a pre-organized visit to each school. Anthropometric 
measures were obtained by a trained medical officer. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with shoes off 
using a freestanding SECA height rod (Model 220, Hamburg, Germany). Weight in kilograms was measured to 
the nearest 0.1 kg using a standard portable weighing machine, after removing any heavy clothing. BMI was cal-
culated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). After 5 minutes resting, blood pressure (BP) was measured 
in a seated position using an automated sphygmomanometer (HEM 907; Omron Healthcare Inc) with appropri-
ate cuff size. Three separate BP measurements were taken, and averaged for analysis. Mean arterial BP (MABP) 
was calculated as one-third of the systolic plus two thirds of the diastolic BP.
A Canon autorefractor (Model RK-F1, Canon Inc., New York, U.S.A.) was used to perform cycloplegic autore-
fraction and keratometry. Children also had a comprehensive eye examination, which included mydriatic digital 
retinal photography. Axial length was measured before cycloplegia with an optical biometer (IOLMaster; Carl 
Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany), using dual-beam partial coherence interferometry25. The average of 5 
measurements was used for analysis.
Statistical Analyses. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (v9.2, SAS Institute, NC) includ-
ing t-tests, χ
2-tests and linear regression. Linear regression models were constructed to examine possible 
cross-sectional associations between HRQoL (independent variable) with retinal vascular caliber (dependent var-
iable). PedsQL item scores were included in the analyses as continuous (each 1-unit increase) or as categorical var-
iables (tertiles). Covariates that were previously found to be significantly associated with retinal vessel caliber26,27 
were included in the final multivariable models i.e. age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, mean arterial BP, and axial length. 
Subsequently, analysis of covariance was used to calculate differences in mean retinal vascular caliber adjusted 
for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, mean arterial BP, and axial length. After multivariable adjustment, linear regression 
analyses indicated interactions between sex and the associations of PedsQL total score (Pinteraction = 0.02); psycho-
social summary (Pinteraction = 0.02); social item (Pintera ction = 0.001); and school item (Pinteraction = 0.02) with retinal 
arteriolar caliber. Therefore, analyses of PedsQL and retinal vascular caliber were also stratified by sex.

Results
Of the 2817 participants re-examined 5 years later, 1600 participants had complete information on retinal vessel 
caliber and PedsQL scores. Participants compared to non-participants were likely to be older and Caucasian, and 
to have higher BMI and systolic BP (Table 1). Table 2 shows the study characteristics of the 1600 participants 
stratified by gender. Significant differences were observed between boys and girls in regards to ethnic distribution, 
systolic and diastolic BP, axial length and in PedsQL total score, physical summary, emotional and social domain 
scores. For instance, boys compared to girls were more likely to be Caucasian, have higher systolic BP, axial length 
and PedsQL total scores (Table 2).
In the overall cohort, each 1-unit increase in PedsQL total score and the psychosocial summary score were 
significantly associated with ~0.05 μ
m narrowing in retinal arteriolar caliber (Table 3). After multivariable adjust-
ment for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, mean arterial blood pressure, and axial length, a significant narrow-
ing of retinal arteriolar caliber was also observed with each 1-unit increase in the PedsQL emotional (p = 0.04), 
social (p = 0.01) and school subscale scores (p = 0.04). Each 1-unit increase in the PedsQL social item score was 
significantly associated with ~0.07 μ
m widening of retinal venular caliber, no other significant associations were 
observed with retinal venules (Table 3). In boys, similar inverse associations were observed between PedsQL total 
score (p = 0.01), psychosocial summary (p = 0.01), and social scores (p = 0.01) and retinal arteriolar caliber after 
multivariable adjustment (Table 4). Also, each 1-unit increase in the PedsQL social item score was associated with 
~0.09 μ
m widening of retinal venular caliber (multivariable-adjusted p-value = 0.01). No significant associations 
were observed between PedsQL item scores and retinal vascular caliber measures in girls (data not shown).
Table 5 shows that in the overall cohort, those in the lowest tertile compared to those in the highest tertile of 
PedsQL total score, psychosocial summary, social and school item scores had significantly wider retinal arteriolar 
caliber: 161.7μ
m versus 160.2 μ
m (p = 0.02); 161.6 μ
m versus 160.0 μ
m (p = 0.02); 161.6 μ
m versus 159.9 μ
m 
(p = 0.002); and 161.6 μ
m versus 159.9 μ
m (p = 0.01), respectively. Similar significant associations were observed 
in boys after multivariable adjustment (Table 5). No significant associations were observed between tertiles of 
PedsQL item scores and retinal arteriolar caliber in girls (data not shown).
Participants in the lowest tertile compared to the highest tertile of social scores had significantly narrower 
retinal venules: 235.1 versus 236.9 μ
m; multivariable-adjusted p = 0.03. Similarly, boys in the lowest tertile com-
pared to the highest tertile of social scores had significantly narrower retinal venules: 234.7 versus 238.1 μ
m; 
multivariable-adjusted p = 0.04. No significant associations between PedsQL scores and retinal venular caliber 
were observed in girls (data not shown).
Discussion
This is the first epidemiological study to demonstrate an independent association between HRQoL and structural 
retinal microvascular changes in a young population. Specifically, we show a modest cross-sectional association 
between lower HRQoL scores with wider retinal arteriolar caliber and narrower retinal venular caliber in a cohort 
of adolescents. In particular, the psychosocial aspects of HRQoL in adolescents showed a significant association 
with retinal vessel caliber changes. Further, observed associations were more marked in boys compared to girls.
There are few other cohort studies with which to compare our findings with. The most relevant studies are 
those showing significant associations between depression and anxiety and wider retinal arteriolar caliber in

adolescents11 and adults12,13. This is in agreement with our data which showed that lower PedsQL psychosocial 
health summary scores (i.e. average of the items in the emotional, social and school functioning scales) were 
associated with retinal arteriolar dilatation. The specific pathophysiological mechanisms underlying wider ret-
inal arteriolar caliber are unclear, but one speculated pathway is endothelial dysfunction (impairment of nitric 
oxide-mediated vasodilation)11. Wider retinal arteriolar caliber is a sign of impaired autoregulation28 and is asso-
ciated with reduced flicker-induced vasodilatation11,29. Reduced endothelial function was associated with worse 
HRQoL in a prior study involving adolescents and young adults30, and endothelial dysfunction has also been 
observed in individuals with depression and anxiety31,32. In the present study, however, we were not able to assess 
endothelial function; hence, we are not able to confirm whether endothelial dysfunction is a potential mechanism

underlying the link between HRQoL and retinal arteriolar dilatation. Additional studies would be needed to 
answer this question.
Another potential underlying mechanism is inflammation. There is research evidence to suggest that inflam-
matory biomarkers are meaningful correlates of HRQoL and robust inverse associations have been demonstrated 
between C-reactive protein (an inflammatory marker) and HRQoL33. Moreover, several studies reported that 
psychosocial factors were predictors of chronic inflammation and poor health34. The influence of psychological 
well-being on C-reactive protein may be supported by studies that reported an association between psychological 
stress and the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis involved in inflammation35. Given that 
changes to retinal vascular calibers are related to systemic inflammation36, this could be a possible pathway by 
which HRQoL is independently associated with retinal microvascular signs in adolescents. Future prospective 
studies with adequate study power are warranted to focus on mechanisms to help explain these structural changes 
in retinal vessels in relation to poorer HRQoL.
We observed a sex-specific difference in the associations between PedsQL scores and retinal microvascular 
signs. These data align with the existing research evidence showing differences in the association of vascular dis-
ease risk factors with HRQoL between men and women e.g., for obesity7,8 and smoking37. Furthermore, Gijsberts 
et al.38 showed significant interactions of gender with diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, 
the association of these vascular risk factors with lower HRQoL was stronger in men than in women. The authors 
speculated that HRQoL in girls is not so much determined by CVD risk factors, a history of CVD or other general 
patient characteristics but more by other factors such as hormonal status and psychosocial factors that were not 
measured in their study38. We hypothesize that this is also likely to be applicable in our cohort study. Finally, our 
findings support data from a longitudinal study which found that the associations between mental stress with 
adverse changes to the vascular function and vascular response were more pronounced in boys rather than girls39. 
Together these epidemiological data, suggest that boys are likely to have changes in vascular health earlier than 
age-matched girls39.

Strengths of this study include its random cluster sample of a relatively large number of representative school-
children; satisfactory response rate; use of standardized retinal vessel caliber measurement protocols and a 
validated pediatric HRQoL instrument. Moreover, these young children were largely free of known systemic 
cardiovascular diseases, and thus, our findings are not likely to be subject to confounding effects CVD risk fac-
tors26. A study limitation is the cross-sectional design as PedsQL was not administered at the baseline survey, 
which does not permit causal inference from the observed associations. Second, we did not collect blood samples 
in our study; therefore, there is no data on biomarkers of chronic disease e.g. blood lipid and glucose levels, and 
measures of inflammatory markers. Third, given that participants versus non-participants differed significantly in 
e.g. age, ethnicity and BMI, we cannot disregard the potential for selection bias influencing observed associations. 
Finally, while we adjusted for a number of important confounders, we cannot discount the possibility that other 
unmeasured factors such as parental well-being and societal factors could have influenced HRQoL in adolescents.
In summary, our community-based study has made an original contribution by showing an independent asso-
ciation between poorer HRQoL scores and retinal microvascular abnormalities in adolescents. As these subtle 
structural retinal microvascular changes have shown to be markers of future vascular disease risk, the presence of 
this risk factor in schoolchildren could support the need for clinicians and researchers to incorporate assessments 
of HRQoL when evaluating the cardiovascular health of adolescents.
