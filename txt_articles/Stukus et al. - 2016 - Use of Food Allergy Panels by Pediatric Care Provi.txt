abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Immunoglobullin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies affect 5% to 
8% of children. Serum IgE levels assist in diagnosing food allergies but have low positive 
predictive value. This can lead to misinterpretation, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary 
dietary elimination. Use of IgE food allergen panels has been associated with increased cost 
and burden. The scale of use of these panels has not been reported in the medical literature.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a commercial laboratory database 
associated with a tertiary care pediatric academic medical center for food IgE tests ordered 
by all provider types during 2013.
RESULTS: A total of 10 794 single-food IgE tests and 3065 allergen panels were ordered. 
Allergists ordered the majority of single-food IgE tests (58.2%) whereas 78.8% of food 
allergen panels were ordered by primary care providers (PCPs) (P < .001). Of all IgE tests 
ordered by PCPs, 45.1% were panels compared with 1.2% of orders placed by allergists 
(P < .001). PCPs in practice for >15 years ordered a higher number of food allergen panels 
(P < .05) compared with PCPs with less experience. Compared with allergists, PCPs ordered 
more tests for unlikely causes of food allergies (P < .001). Total cost of IgE testing and cost 
per patient were higher for PCPs compared with allergists.
CONCLUSIONS: Review of food allergen IgE testing through a high volume outpatient laboratory 
revealed PCPs order significantly more food allergen panels, tests for uncommon causes of 
food allergy, and generate higher cost per patient compared with allergists. These results 
suggest a need for increased education of PCPs regarding proper use of food IgE tests.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Indiscriminate 
use of food immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing without 
consideration of clinical history is discouraged 
by guidelines because of poor positive predictive 
values. Commercial laboratories offer panels 
containing several foods, which are subject to 
misinterpretation and overdiagnosis.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study identifi
 es 
greater use of IgE panels by primary care 
pediatricians compared with allergists. Physicians 
with longer duration of practice order more IgE 
panels. The use of specifi
 c IgE panels is associated 
with higher cost per patient.

Food allergies affect ∼5% to 8% of 
children, with increasing prevalence 
during the past 2 decades. 
1, 
 
2 There 
are a variety of immune-mediated 
food hypersensitivity disorders, 
but only immunoglobulin E (IgE)-
mediated food allergy presents with 
immediate-onset and reproducible 
reactions that can cause a range of 
symptoms, including anaphylaxis 
and, in rare cases, death. 
3 Accurate 
diagnosis of IgE-mediated food 
allergy is critical for effective self-
management, which entails strict 
avoidance of the offending food in 
addition to immediate access to self-
injectable epinephrine for patients 
with a history of systemic reactions, 
in case of accidental exposure. 
4, 
5
Oral food challenges are considered 
the gold standard to confirm a 
diagnosis of IgE-mediated food 
allergy. 
6 However, this is not always 
feasible or warranted, particularly 
when there is risk of anaphylaxis. 
Other widely available methods 
to assist in the diagnosis of IgE-
mediated food allergy include 
percutaneous skin prick testing and 
laboratory assays to measure levels 
of serum food-specific IgE (sIgE). 
7, 
 
8 
Many commercial laboratories offer 
panels containing multiple inhalant 
and/or food sIgE levels, touting 
convenience and cost effectiveness.
Current clinical guidelines strongly 
discourage indiscriminate use of skin 
prick and food sIgE testing, which are 
both associated with poor sensitivity 
and high rates of falsely elevated and 
clinically insignificant results. 
6, 
 
9 Many 
more children will be sensitized 
to foods than will experience 
allergic reactions on exposure. 
10 
Interpretation of food sIgE results 
without consideration of the clinical 
history can lead to overdiagnosis 
of food allergy, increased cost of 
evaluation, unnecessary dietary 
elimination, and the potential for 
adverse consequences for the 
patient and their family, including 
decreased quality of life and potential 
nutritional deficiencies. 
10– 
12 To our 
knowledge, there are no published 
studies that have quantified the use 
of sIgE panels by clinicians. The aim 
of our study was to characterize and 
quantify the use of food sIgE panels 
by primary care providers (PCPs) 
and allergists.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective 
review of the electronic database 
of a high-volume outpatient 
laboratory in the Department of 
Pathology and Laboratory Medicine 
at Nationwide Children’s Hospital 
(NCH; Columbus, OH) for all food 
sIgE tests ordered between January 
1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. The 
NCH laboratory has a large referral 
base throughout the state of Ohio 
and processed 2 637 438 billable 
laboratory tests in 2013. Data were 
analyzed for number and type of 
individual food sIgEs and all panels 
containing at least 1 food allergen. 
Laboratory testing for single sIgE 
toward aeroallergens, medications, 
hymenoptera, and latex were 
excluded from analysis.
Serum IgE testing was performed by 
using ImmunoCAP Allergen specific 
assays on the Phadia Immunoassay 
Analyzer (ThermoScientific, Portage, 
MI) in the NCH laboratory for both 
aeroallergens and food allergens, 
with some select testing sent to 
outside reference laboratories. 
Serum IgE testing can be ordered 
for individual allergens, or several 
different allergen panels, within 
which multiple sIgE tests are 
bundled together. In 2013, the 
NCH laboratory offered 6 allergen 
panels that contained at least 1 food 
(Supplemental Information). Orders 
to the laboratory can be placed from 
within the NCH system of providers, 
as well as from clinicians in the 
surrounding community.
For the purposes of this study, 
ordering clinicians (physicians, nurse 
practitioners [NPs], and physician 
assistants [PAs]) were classified 
according to their primary area of 
clinical expertise and divided into 
categories, including: allergy and 
immunology (A/I), PCP (including 
pediatricians, family medicine, 
and internal medicine), and 
gastroenterology (GI). All remaining 
subspecialties were labeled and 
grouped as “other” because of the 
relatively small number of tests 
ordered and providers. The time 
since completion of residency or 
specialty fellowship training was 
determined for each clinician through 
review of their licensure, medical 
staff privileges, or both. Clinician 
data were extracted to a database 
(Microsoft Excel, 2010) for analysis 
and de-identified. Categorical 
variables from within each group 
and between 2 groups were analyzed 
by χ2. Continuous variables were 
compared with the Mann–Whitney 
test. Mean values among multiple 
groups were compared by using 
one-way analysis of variance. For 
statistical comparisons, P < .05 was 
considered statistically significant. 
Because no patient-identifying 
information was included in any data 
collection, the institutional review 
board at NCH deemed this study 
exempt from formal review.
RESULTS
During our 1-year study time period, 
10 794 single-food sIgE tests and 
3065 allergen panels containing at 
least 1 food sIgE were ordered by 447 
individual clinicians, encompassing 
16 medical and surgical specialties 
( 
Table 1). Among PCPs, 247 (88.8%) 
of physicians were pediatricians 
and the remaining physicians were 
identified as either family practice 
(n = 28, 10.2%) or internal medicine 
(n = 3, 1.1%). Family practice and 
internal medicine physicians ordered 
only 2.4% of all sIgE tests among 
PCPs. Pediatricians ordered the 
most single-food sIgEs among PCPs, 
comprising 97.9% of the single-food 
sIgE tests ordered by PCPs (P < .001).

Overall, allergists ordered the 
majority of single-food sIgE tests 
(58.2%), compared with 23.1% 
obtained by PCPs (P < .001). Of 
7059 single-food sIgEs ordered 
by subspecialist physicians, A/I 
ordered 88.9%, GI ordered 9.2%, 
and the remaining subspecialties 
accounted for 1.8% (P < .001;  
Table 1). 
Among the 3065 allergen panels 
containing foods that were ordered, 
78.8% were obtained by PCPs (P < 
.001), with 14.4% ordered by GI and 
4.1% ordered by A/I. The combined 
remaining subspecialists accounted 
for <3% of allergen panel orders 
( 
Table 1).
NPs and PAs from primary care 
(n = 47), allergy (n = 5), and other 
specialties (n = 11) ordered 1660 
food-containing sIgE tests during 
our study period, which accounted 
for 12% of all orders ( 
Table 1). The 
percentage of panels containing 
food allergens ordered was similar 
between PCPs and primary care 
NP/PAs (45.1% vs 41.4%; P = .05). 
Within A/I, NP/PAs ordered food 
allergen sIgE panels more frequently 
than allergists (6.4% vs 1.2%; 
P < .001).
Allergists ordered significantly 
more total sIgE tests per physician 
compared with PCPs (mean, 154.98 ± 
247.01 vs 16.35 ± 60.52) ( 
Table 2). 
However, 45.1% of all sIgE tests 
ordered by PCPs were panels, 
compared with only 1.2% of orders 
placed by allergists. Overall, allergists 
ordered more sIgE tests per patient 
(7.11 ± 5.38 vs 2.33 ± 3.33; P < .001) 
compared with PCPs, but less panels 
(1.01 ± 0.11 vs 1.33 ± 0.77; P < .001). 
The mean age of patients being 
evaluated for food allergies was 
similar between both PCPs (5.92 ± 
4.86 years; range, 1 month to 18 
years) and A/I (5.99 ± 4.08 years; 
range 3 months to 18 years) ( 
Table 2).
During the study period, 73% (n = 
205) of PCPs had been in practice for 
≥10 years (mean, 16.42 ± 9.69 years; 
range, 0–45 years). The duration of 
practice among allergists was similar, 
with 70.7% (n = 29) in practice for 
≥10 years (mean = 18.1 ± 12.18; 
range, 1–46 years).  
Table 3 compares 
sIgE tests ordered by PCPs according 
to their duration of practice. PCPs in 
practice for ≤15 years ordered ∼50% 
fewer sIgE panels compared with 
PCPs in practice for ≥16 years.
Regarding single-food sIgE, allergists 
were much more likely to order 
testing for one of the 8 most common 
food allergens (cow’s milk, egg, 
wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, fish, 
and shellfish, which account for 
>90% of all IgE-mediated food 
allergies 
13) compared with PCPs

(78.3% of all single sIgE tests 
compared with 65.9%; P < .001). 
Compared with allergists, PCPs 
ordered significantly more sIgE 
tests for foods associated with a low 
prevalence of IgE-mediated food 
allergy, such as strawberry, beef, 
corn, and tomato ( 
Fig 1).
The most frequently ordered food-
containing allergen panel was the 
Food Allergy Profile (81.4%, n = 
2496), which included 11 foods: 
clam, cod, corn, egg, milk, peanut, 
scallop, shrimp, soy, walnut, and 
wheat. The Food Allergy Profile was 
ordered most frequently by PCPs 
(75%), followed by GI (11%) and A/I 
(4%). The second most frequently 
ordered profile was the Childhood 
Allergy Profile (14.7%, n = 450), 
which included 6 food sIgEs (cod, 
milk, egg, peanut, soy, and wheat) 
combined with 5 inhalant allergen 
sIgEs (cat dander, cockroach, dog 
dander, dust mite, and alternaria) 
(Supplemental Information). This test 
was also most frequently ordered by 
PCPs (87%), with GI and pulmonary 
physicians ordering 2% and 4%, 
respectively. The Childhood Allergy 
Profile was infrequently ordered by 
A/I physicians, who accounted for 
<0.01% of the orders for this profile.
During the study time period, 
the average laboratory charge 
reported by the CodeMap 2013 
Medicare Reimbursement Manual 
for Laboratory and Pathology 
Services for each individual sIgE 
was $26.92. To generate the cost 
of each panel, the individual cost 
of each sIgE was multiplied by the 
number of allergens contained 
within the panel. The cost of each 
panel ranged from $134.60 for the 
Seafood Allergy Profile containing 
5 food allergens to $619.16 for the 
Childhood/Respiratory Allergy 
Profile, which contains 23 food and 
inhalant allergens. The total cost of 
all sIgE tests ordered per patient was 
approximately twice as expensive 
for PCPs, ($399.10 compared with 
$192.22 for allergists;  
Table 4). The 
majority of this discrepancy was 
relevant to ordering sIgE panels, 
which cost on average $402.34 
per patient when ordered by PCPs 
compared with $244.41 per patient 
when ordered by allergists.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to quantify and characterize 
the use of food allergen sIgE tests 
by PCPs. Our findings demonstrate 
significant discrepancies in the 
quantity and cost associated with 
ordering food allergen panels by 
PCPs compared with allergists. In 
addition, PCPs were more likely to 
order single-food sIgE tests for foods 
that are infrequent causes of allergy 
in children, such as strawberry, beef, 
and tomato. PCPs further removed 
from residency training ordered 
more sIgE tests overall, especially 
panels, which suggests a possible 
lack of understanding or slow 
adoption of up-to-date food allergy 
clinical guidelines. 
6 Collectively, 
these findings reflect a need for 
additional education to ensure the 
most appropriate ordering and 
interpretation of sIgE tests for the 
evaluation of food allergy.
The discrepancy in use of sIgE panels 
was most apparent in orders for the 
Childhood Allergy Profile, which 
was only ordered 2 times during the 
study period by allergists, compared 
with 383 orders from PCPs. This 
profile contains 5 aeroallergens 
(cat, dog, dust mite, cockroach, and 
alternaria) that rarely cause clinical 
symptoms in infants <12 months of 
age who may be suspected of having 
food allergies. Understanding of the 
components of each panel as well 
as clinical relevance is important in

both ordering the proper test and 
interpretation of results.
The clinical history is the most 
important factor when determining 
whether a food allergy may be 
present. 
9 Historical elements of 
importance include the type of 
food reported to cause symptoms, 
timing of symptom onset, types 
of symptoms, and recurrence of 
symptoms with subsequent ingestion 
of the food in question. 
3, 
 
6 In 
children, egg, cow’s milk, and peanut 
allergies are most common, 
 
2, 
14, 
 
15 
whereas peanut, tree nuts, and 
seafood allergies are more common 
in adults. 
16 Knowledge of the 
important historical elements, 
spectrum of food-related adverse 
reactions, and common causes of 
IgE-mediated food allergy is 
important to determine which 
foods may warrant testing and also 
to avoid unnecessary testing. 
17

In 2012, the American Board of 
Internal Medicine and American 
Academy of Allergy, Asthma and 
Immunology published their first 
Choosing Wisely series, which 
highlights 10 areas of unnecessary 
testing. 
23 Number 7 on this list 
states: “Don’t perform food IgE 
testing without a history consistent 
with potential IgE-mediated food 
allergy.” There is also no indication 
to remove food from someone’s 
diet based solely on a “positive” 
sIgE result. Many patients may be 
sensitized with a detectable sIgE 
to foods but not experience any 
reactions with exposure. 
11 Both 
skin prick and serum-specific IgE 
testing for foods have high rates of 
falsely elevated results. 
24 This can 
result in misinterpretation, improper 
diagnosis, and unnecessary dietary 
elimination. In addition, the 95% 
positive predictive values have 
only been established for egg, milk, 
and peanut. 
25 Positive predictive 
values for other common allergenic 
foods, such as fish and tree nuts, 
are not as well established.5 Thus, 
interpretation of sIgE levels to any 
other foods is based on clinical 
history and experience of the 
ordering physician.
In a recent study, Bird et al 
10 
demonstrated the unnecessary 
clinical and economic burden 
associated with use and 
misinterpretation of food sIgE 
panels by PCPs. Among 797 children 
referred to their A/I practice over 
18 months, 35% had previous food 
allergy panel testing. The authors 
determined the positive predictive 
value of panel testing for food allergy 
to be 2.2%. They also found that only 
32.8% had a clinical history that 
warranted food allergy evaluation 
and there was an avoidable cost 
of ∼$79 000 associated with these 
evaluations.
We previously identified knowledge 
gaps surrounding food allergies 
among internal medicine and 
pediatric residents and attending 
physicians at 2 large academic 
medical centers. 
26 In this study, 408 
physicians answered a 9-question 
survey, including 6 questions 
related to food allergy diagnosis, 
testing, or management. Only 22% 
of respondents correctly answered 
a question regarding sIgE testing 
for food allergies and only 27% 
correctly identified the most common 
childhood food allergens. Overall, 
physicians with previous A/I 
elective experience or who recently 
completed residency training had the 
highest number of correct answers.
A survey published in 2007 identified 
significant differences in the 
understanding of prevalence, causes, 
and presentation of food allergies 
among nonallergists compared 
with allergists. 
27 Nonallergists 
were more likely to misidentify 
common causes of food allergy, 
order nonvalidated diagnostic 
tests, and recommend broader 
elimination diets when compared 
with allergists. 
28 A similar survey by 
Gupta et al 
29 was published in 2010. 
In this survey of 407 pediatricians 
and family practitioners, 68% of 
PCPs responded that a positive sIgE 
is sufficient to diagnose food allergy 
and only 28% felt comfortable 
interpreting laboratory tests to 
diagnose food allergy. 
29
Lack of understanding of food 
allergies and testing by PCPs is 
multifactorial but likely related 
to demands on their time and 
challenges in keeping up with an 
ever-growing body of evolving 
scientific evidence and changing 
clinical guidelines. Limited access 
to board-certified A/I consultants 
for patient referrals or A/I training 
programs for residency elective 
rotations may contribute as well.
In our study, specialists in other 
fields, NPs, and PAs ordered 21.3% 
of all sIgE tests. Similar to PCPs, 
this group of clinicians collectively 
ordered food allergen panels (31.7%) 
more frequently than allergists. Given 
the widespread availability of sIgE 
testing, which can be ordered by any 
provider, educational efforts should 
not only be directed at PCPs, but 
other specialists and NP/PAs as well.
Strengths of our study include the 
large number of laboratory orders 
and physicians included in the 
database, details regarding types of 
food allergen sIgE orders placed, and 
inclusion of the duration of practice 
for each physician. Major limitations 
include an inability to assess the 
clinical history of any patients 
who had testing performed or the 
interpretation and management of 
the test results. In addition, the cost 
analysis does not take into account 
any other charges, such as office 
visits, follow-up skin prick testing, 
oral food challenges, or provision of 
epinephrine auto-injectors. However, 
given the findings from Bird et al, 
 
10 it 
is reasonable to extrapolate that the 
sheer volume of sIgE panels ordered 
by providers in our study would lead 
to considerable additional cost and 
likely unnecessary dietary elimination.
The availability of serum IgE testing 
for PCPs is extremely important for

STUKUS et al 
their ability to evaluate patients with 
potential food allergy, particularly 
if access to allergists and/or skin 
prick testing is limited. However, to 
avoid unnecessary cost and potential 
misinterpretation, PCPs should refrain 
from ordering any sIgE panel tests 
containing foods, particularly if the 
clinical history is not suggestive for 
IgE-mediated food allergy. In support 
of this, the first recommendation from 
the Choosing Wisely list states: “Don’t 
perform unproven diagnostic tests, 
such as immunoglobulin G testing or 
an indiscriminate battery of IgE tests, 
in the evaluation of allergy 
23.” Instead, 
PCPs should evaluate concern for 
food allergy by ordering individual 
sIgE tests only to foods for which 
there is a clinical history consistent 
with IgE-mediated food allergy. 
Ideally, commercial laboratories 
would consider removing sIgE panels 
containing foods from their available 
tests to prevent unnecessary cost 
expenditures.
Medical societies, clinical guidelines, 
and allergists can all serve as 
potential resources for educational 
efforts to help increase the 
knowledge and understanding 
of PCPs in regard to the ordering 
and interpretation of food sIgE 
testing. Future research should 
include confirmation of our findings 
in other geographic locations and 
patient populations as well as 
evaluation of trends over time. In 
addition, large scale studies with 
inclusion of clinical outcomes 
would offer broader insight into the 
potential impact from use of food 
allergy sIgE panels.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, PCPs ordered the 
majority of commercially available 
food allergen IgE panels, which has 
been associated with overdiagnosis 
of food allergy, unnecessary dietary 
elimination, and increased cost. 
Ideally, laboratories should limit food 
allergen panels from available testing 
options. In addition, both laboratories 
and allergists should educate health 
care providers regarding the ability 
to order single-food sIgE tests when 
clinically indicated. Dissemination 
of evidence-based clinical practice 
guidelines and ongoing research 
regarding the impact of food allergy 
IgE testing will ideally assist PCPs in 
the ordering and interpretation of 
these tests.
