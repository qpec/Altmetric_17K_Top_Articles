ABSTRACT
Background Frailty is an important clinical syndrome
that is consistently associated with adverse outcomes in
older people. The relevance of frailty to chronic
respiratory disease and its management is unknown.
Objectives To determine the prevalence of frailty
among patients with stable COPD and examine whether
frailty affects completion and outcomes of pulmonary
rehabilitation.
Methods 816 outpatients with COPD (mean (SD) age
70 (10) years, FEV1% predicted 48.9 (21.0)) were
recruited between November 2011 and January 2015.
Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria (weight loss,
exhaustion, low physical activity, slowness and
weakness) before and after pulmonary rehabilitation.
Predictors of programme non-completion were identified
using multivariate logistic regression, and outcomes were
compared using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age
and sex.
Results 209/816 patients (25.6%, 95% CI 22.7 to
28.7) were frail. Prevalence of frailty increased with age,
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) stage, Medical Research Council (MRC) score
and age-adjusted comorbidity burden (all p≤0.01).
Patients who were frail had double the odds of
programme non-completion (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI
1.39 to 3.46, p=0.001), often due to exacerbation and/
or hospital admission. However, rehabilitation outcomes
favoured frail completers, with consistently better
responses in MRC score, exercise performance, physical
activity level and health status (all p<0.001). After
rehabilitation, 71/115 (61.3%) previously frail patients
no longer met case criteria for frailty.
Conclusions Frailty affects one in four patients with
COPD referred for pulmonary rehabilitation and is an
independent predictor of programme non-completion.
However, patients who are frail respond favourably to
rehabilitation and their frailty can be reversed in the
short term.
INTRODUCTION
Frailty describes a clinical syndrome characterised
by multisystem decline that leads to reduced func-
tional
reserve
and
increased
vulnerability
to
dependency or mortality following minor stressor
events.1 It affects an estimated 1 in every 10 people
aged over 65 years2 and is consistently associated
with increased risk of falls, disability, hospitalisation
and death.3 Although frailty is conventionally con-
sidered secondary to age-related decline, chronic
disease(s) can accelerate the rate of decline and
precipitate a frail state. In COPD, extrapulmonary
manifestations include physical inactivity, muscle
weakness, anorexia, osteoporosis and fatigue.4 Each
of these systemic impacts of the disease is fre-
quently observed in physical frailty.
The relevance of frailty to chronic respiratory
disease has not been fully dissected. In retrospective
cohort
studies,
self-reported
frailty
is
more
common in older people with COPD than without
it, and markers of frailty have identified those at
increased risk of subsequent hospital admission or
death.5 6 Few studies have examined the prevalence
of frailty in respiratory disease using validated defi-
nitions. One notable exception is a report restricted
to lung transplant candidates, among whom frailty
was associated with increased risk of delisting or
death.7 Identifying frailty earlier in the course of
disease is important, as interventions may then be
introduced to prevent functional decline, hospital
admissions and/or death in those at high risk.
Frailty may prove a valuable way of stratifying
patients with COPD for future management as it
accounts for multiple deficits that influence disease
prognosis, for example, muscle weakness or phys-
ical inactivity,8 including deficits not considered by
other syndromes or comorbidity indices.9 10
Another important but unstudied topic is the
interplay between frailty and pulmonary rehabilita-
tion. Pulmonary rehabilitation is highly effective at
improving symptom burden, physical function and
Key questions
What is the key question?
▸ What is the prevalence of frailty in stable
COPD, and does frailty affect the completion
and outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Frailty affects one in every four patients with
COPD entering pulmonary rehabilitation, is
associated with favourable outcomes, but is
also strong risk factor for non-completion.
Why read on?
▸ This is the first characterisation of the frailty
phenotype in stable COPD and demonstrates
that physical frailty is amenable to treatment
with pulmonary rehabilitation.

 health status, although patient response is heterogeneous.11 12
Conceptually, pulmonary rehabilitation targets many compo-
nents of frailty, including slowness,13 fatigue,14 weakness15 and
physical inactivity,11 and provides a holistic approach to encour-
age self-management, disease education and behaviours to
improve overall health. Pulmonary rehabilitation also targets
dyspnoea, which may be a contributing factor to the develop-
ment of frailty in people with chronic respiratory disease.
Finally, some programmes incorporate falls prevention strat-
egies, through balance training and education,16 again focusing
on a frailty-related outcome. However, in the same way that
frailty affects planned surgical management,7 the syndrome may
prevent patients from engaging in pulmonary rehabilitation—a
mainstay of disease management.11 The factors for heteroge-
neous
adherence
to
pulmonary
rehabilitation
are
widely
debated,17 18 but physical frailty is a plausible candidate given
the close relationship with adverse outcomes in COPD6 7 and
other long-term conditions.3 If frailty does hinder completion
of pulmonary rehabilitation, this would suggest a need to
support patients who are frail with alternative or supplementary
rehabilitation strategies.
Study objectives were to determine the prevalence of frailty
among
patients
with
stable
COPD,
describe
the
clinical
characteristics of the COPD frailty phenotype and examine
whether frailty affects completion and clinical outcomes of pul-
monary rehabilitation. W
e hypothesised that frailty would inde-
pendently predict non-completion of pulmonary rehabilitation.
METHODS
Participants and design
Participants were recruited to this prospective cohort study from
respiratory outpatient and pulmonary rehabilitation clinics at
Harefield Hospital (Middlesex, UK) between November 2011
and January 2015. Eligible patients were aged 35 years or
above, with a physician diagnosis of COPD consistent with the
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
criteria19 and appropriate for a pulmonary rehabilitation refer-
ral. Exclusion criteria were an exacerbation in the previous 4
weeks that required a change in medication, a condition that
might make moderate-intensity exercise unsafe, for example,
unstable cardiac disease or a predominant neurological disability.
Treating clinicians identified potentially eligible patients and
offered a written information sheet. Referral criteria for pul-
monary rehabilitation were able to walk at least 5 m, any degree
of functional impairment secondary to dyspnoea (typically
Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score 2 or more),
no previous supervised pulmonary rehabilitation in previous
12 months and without unstable cardiovascular disease, in line
with British Thoracic Society Quality Standards.20 Data for
some participants (528/816, 64.7%) relating to sarcopenia, but
not frailty, have been reported previously.15 All participants gave
written informed consent in accordance with the principles of
Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and the
study was approved by the W
est London (11/H0707/2) and
London Camberwell St Giles (11/LO/1780) Research Ethics
Committees.
Frailty assessment
Frailty was defined using the Fried phenotype model,9 which is
well established and validated in large epidemiological studies.3
This model comprises five characteristics that reduce physio-
logical reserve and precipitate a vulnerable state; shrinking
(unintentional weight loss), exhaustion, low physical activity,
slowness and weakness.9 Characteristics were assessed by weight
loss history, two questions from the Center for Epidemiological
Studies-Depression
(CES-D)
questionnaire
(exhaustion),21
weekly self-reported energy expenditure using the modified
Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (low
physical activity),22 4-m gait speed (4MGS, slowness)23 and
handgrip
dynamometry
(weakness).
Standardised
criteria,
derived from the original reference cohort,9 were used to define
each characteristic as either present or absent for each patient
(see online supplementary table S1), providing an ordinal score
ranging 0–5. Patients with no criteria present were considered
not-frail/robust, those meeting 1–2 criteria were considered
prefrail and those with ≥3 criteria present were considered frail.
Additional assessments
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Quadscan 4000, Bodystat, Isle
of Man, UK) was used to estimate skeletal muscle mass index
(SMI).24 The presence of sarcopenia was defined according to
the consensus European W
orking Group on Sarcopenia in Older
People criteria.25 Quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction
(QMVC) was measured using a fixed strain gauge,26 with weak-
ness diagnosed according to healthy predicted values27 and sex-
specific functionally relevant cut-points.28 Exercise performance
was assessed using the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT).29
Further measurements included evaluation of respiratory disabil-
ity by MRC dyspnoea score, comorbidity burden using the
age-adjusted Charlson Index,30 help with activities of daily care
using the Katz Index,31 composite disease severity by the age,
dyspnoea, and airflow obstruction (ADO) index,32 Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and health status using
the self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ)33
and COPD Assessment T
est (CAT).34
Pulmonary rehabilitation
Pulmonary rehabilitation was an 8-week outpatient exercise and
multidisciplinary education programme, comprising two super-
vised and at least one additional home-based session each week
and organised according to the British Thoracic Society Quality
Standards for Pulmonary Rehabilitation.20 Supervised sessions
comprised 1 hour of exercise and 45 min of education. Exercise
training was individualised and progressive. Initial walking
speed prescription was at 80% of predicted peak oxygen con-
sumption based on ISWT performance,35 while initial endur-
ance cycling was set at a workload with the aim of patients
completing 10 min of continuous training. Lower limb resist-
ance training comprised 2 sets of 10 seated leg press repetitions,
performed with an initial training load of 60% one-repetition
maximum, as well as sit-to-stand, knee extension, hip flexion
and hip abduction exercises with ankle weights. Upper limb
resistance training comprised biceps curls, shoulder press and
upright row with free weights. Education was delivered by a
multidisciplinary team. Topics were chosen to develop patients’
understanding and holistic management of their disease and
included physical activity and exercise, medication use, diet,
smoking cessation, coping strategies, as well as managing infec-
tions through early recognition, rescue medication and appro-
priate general practice/hospital presentation.
Statistical analysis
Our sample size was based on the precision to which the overall
prevalence of frailty could be estimated. Assuming it was within
the range 10%–60%, prevalence could be estimated to within
±3.5% using 800 participants with a large sample normal
approximation (nQuery Advisor V
.6.0). Analyses were per-
formed using SPSS (V
.22, IBM, New York, USA) and graphs

 produced using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
California, USA). Data were presented as proportions (95% CIs)
or mean (SD).
The prevalence of frailty was determined overall and then
compared across groups according to age, GOLD spirometry
stage,
MRC
dyspnoea
score
and
age-adjusted
Charlson
comorbidity score using χ2 for trend. Baseline characteristics as
well as pulmonary rehabilitation uptake, attendance and com-
pletion rates were compared across groups (not frail/robust,
pre-frail, frail) using one-way analysis of variance or χ2 for
trend with a Bonferroni correction applied to post hoc pairwise
comparisons. Uptake was defined as the proportion of assessed
patients who attended the first supervised session, adherence
was assessed using the number of supervised sessions attended
and completion was defined as the proportion of patients who
had documented attendance at a minimum of eight supervised
sessions, representing 50% attendance.36
Univariate logistic regression was used to assess the relation-
ships between non-completion, frailty status (not or prefrail/
frail) and candidate explanatory variables informed from exist-
ing literature and clinical judgement.17 18 Variables associated
with non-completion (p<0.15) were considered in a multivari-
ate model. After checking for collinearity (r<0.75), we used a
backwards conditional approach to retain variables in the model
(p<0.10). Outcomes of rehabilitation were summarised as
change pre-to-post rehabilitation for patients who completed as
per the above definition. Outcomes were then compared across
groups using analysis of covariance adjusting for age and sex.
To control for T
ype I errors in view of multiple testing, we
applied a Bonferroni correction to a significance level of 0.05
when comparing baseline patient characteristics and rehabilita-
tion outcomes.
RESULTS
Prevalence of frailty
Eight-hundred and sixteen patients took part (484 men, mean
(SD) age 70 (10) years, FEV1 48.9 (21.0) % predicted, MRC
score 3.3 (1.0)) (table 1). The overall prevalence of frailty was
25.6% (95% CI 22.7% to 28.7%), while 10.0% (95% CI 8.2%
to 12.3%) of patients did not meet any of the frailty criteria and
were considered robust (figure 1). Of the frailty characteristics,
the exhaustion criterion was met by the largest proportion of
patients (65.3%) followed by weakness, low physical activity
and slowness. The unintentional weight loss criterion was met
by fewest patients (14.2%) (table 1). Frailty tended to be more
common among women than men (29.7% vs 22.8%, p=0.08).
Prevalence increased statistically with increasing age (p<0.001),
GOLD stage (p=0.01), MRC score (p<0.001) and comorbidity
burden (p=0.004). There was a twofold increase in frailty
prevalence among patients with GOLD stage IV as compared
with stage I disease (34.7% vs 17.9%, p<0.001) and a threefold
increase among patients with an MRC score of 5 as compared
with a score of 3 (62.1% vs 21.0%, p<0.001; figure 2).
The COPD frailty phenotype
Patients who were frail with COPD had significantly reduced
SMI but not body mass index as compared with prefrail or
robust patients (table 1). Reduced physical function was evident
beyond the characteristics used to define frailty, with reduced
QMVC and ISWT performance, and a greater prevalence of sar-
copenia (23.9% vs 9.5% in the prefrail group and 1.2% in the
robust group, p<0.001). Patients who were frail reported a
worse health status across all instruments and domains, and
higher levels of anxiety and depression as compared with
patients who were not-frail and prefrail (table 1). Among
patients with QMVC measurements (n=707), almost three-
quarters (73.1%) of patients who were frail had concurrent
quadriceps weakness,20 while only 25.0% had concurrent sarco-
penia. Similar proportions of patients who were frail had both
(14.4%) or neither (16.3%) of these phenotypes.
Engagement in pulmonary rehabilitation
Overall rates of programme uptake and completion for the
cohort were 84.7% (95% CI 82.0% to 87.0%) and 70.3%
(95% CI 67.1% to 73.4%), respectively, and mean (SD) attend-
ance was 11.4 (4.2) of 16 supervised sessions (table 1). Rates
were lowest in the frail group such that 55.0% of candidates
completed rehabilitation, as compared with 74.5% of prefrail
and 84.1% of not frail/robust candidates (p<0.001). In the uni-
variate regression age, MRC score, FEV1% predicted, Charlson
Index, ISWT
, QMVC, ADO, CAT score, HADS anxiety and
depression,
and
frailty
status
were
associated
with
non-
completion. Each of the frailty characteristics was individually
associated with non-completion though the relationship was
strongest when frailty status was considered overall (table 2).
In the multivariate regression, frailty status, age, ISWT and CAT
score were retained in the final model. Frailty was a strong inde-
pendent predictor and being frail was associated with double
the odds of non-completion; adjusted OR 2.20 (95% CI 1.39%
to 3.46%), p=0.001 (table 2). When examining reasons for not
taking up or completing a programme, proportionally more frail
patients experienced deterioration in their condition or were
admitted to hospital (figure 1). Among patients who were frail,
baseline MRC score was higher in non-completers as compared
with completers (4.3 vs 3.9, p=0.001) and there was weak evi-
dence of additional functional impairment in non-completers
(see online supplementary table S2).
Outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation
Following completion of rehabilitation, significant improve-
ments were observed across all groups for SMI, QMVC, CRQ
dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional and mastery domains, and physical
activity (table 3) and in prefrail and frail groups for MRC score,
handgrip strength, ISWT
, CAT score and HADS domains
(table 3). Adjusting for age and sex, a gradient of treatment
response in favour of patients who were frail was evident for
MRC score, handgrip strength, ISWT
, CRQ fatigue, emotional
and mastery domains, CAT score and HADS scores (table 3).
Outcomes related to frailty characteristics (handgrip strength,
4MGS and physical activity) and responses to CES-D exhaustion
questions also improved, such that postrehabilitation, fewer
patients met case criteria for frailty (figure 3). Among the 115
completers who were frail prior to pulmonary rehabilitation, 71
(61.7%) were prefrail (64, 55.6%) or robust (7, 6.1%) following
it. A small minority of completers, 13/390 (3.3%), had moved
from a prefrail to a frail state (figure 3).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort study, we identified that one-quarter
(25.6%) of patients with stable COPD referred for pulmonary
rehabilitation were frail according to the Fried phenotype cri-
teria. Patients who were frail demonstrated high levels of impair-
ment
as
compared
with
prefrail
or
robust
patients,
one
consequence of which was more difficulty engaging in pulmon-
ary rehabilitation as a mainstay of their disease management.
Adjusting for all known confounders, being frail was associated
with over double the odds of programme non-completion.
Nonetheless, in those who completed rehabilitation there was a

 gradient of treatment response, in favour of patients who were
frail, for outcomes relating to symptom burden, exercise per-
formance and health status. Furthermore, in a large proportion
of those who completed pulmonary rehabilitation, the frailty
phenotype was reversed, at least in the short term.
Our point prevalence estimate for frailty is within the range
previously reported in COPD (10.2% to 28.0%),5 7 37 and over
twice the 9.9% (95% CI 9.6% to 10.2%) observed among older
people living in the community.2 Prevalence in our cohort, with a
mean age of 70 years, is similar to that found among those aged
85 and above in the general population.2 The only estimate to
suggest frailty prevalence is not increased in respiratory disease
arose from a retrospective analysis of an older-persons cohort
and included patients with very mild spirometric disease (mean
FEV1 79.6 (25.2) % predicted) and minimal evidence of func-
tional impairment (only 2.5% of patients with COPD had a slow
gait speed).5 While frailty was more common in patients with
spirometrically advanced disease, prevalence among patients in
the GOLD I category was almost 20% emphasising the import-
ance of multidimensional assessment, even in early disease.
The detailed phenotypic data highlight the extent to which
frailty
adversely
impacts
patients
with
chronic
respiratory
disease. Others have associated frailty with poor exercise cap-
acity and physical disability.7 38 W

 demonstrating that frailty relates to reduced physical function
(lower limb muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical activity),
dyspnoea, dependency, increased anxiety and depression, and
worse emotional distress and health status. These deficits have
also been linked to sarcopenia,15 which is considered a compo-
nent of frailty.39 Frailty is more multifaceted and can occur
without skeletal muscle dysfunction, for example, due to
ventilatory impairment, as confirmed by the only partial overlap
we observed between these two syndromes.40
Irrespective of cause, frailty denotes an increased state of risk
related to falls, disability, hospitalisation and mortality.3 The
prognostic utility of frailty in chronic respiratory disease for
mortality
and
hospitalisation
is
supported
by
earlier
studies,5 7 41 and its adverse impact on the clinical management

 of patients is emerging.7 Here, we highlight a new example of
frailty altering COPD management in that it prevented patients
from fully engaging in pulmonary rehabilitation, an internation-
ally recommended standard of care.11 Patients who were frail
experienced
frequent
episodes
of
clinical
deterioration
and/or hospitalisation, which restricted their participation in
rehabilitation. Although previous studies have identified risk
factors
for

non-completion,
for
example, smoking status, breathlessness or low mood,17
18
frailty was comparatively a far stronger independent predictor
in our cohort.
The impressive outcomes seen following programme comple-
tion provide strong grounds to explore how better to support
patients who are frail through rehabilitation, potentially through
organisation changes or by supplementing supervised exercise
with novel strategies, for example, neuromuscular electrical

 stimulation.42 Improvements across physical, psychological and
global health were observed after rehabilitation, often with an
apparent gradient of treatment response in favour of patients
who were frail (table 2). The magnitude of effect among
patients who were frail is noteworthy and many improvements
far exceeded minimum important differences (MID); mean
change (95% CI) ISWT 146 m (109 to 183)/MID 47.5 m43 and
CAT score −7.3 (−9.7 to −4.8) MID −2.0.34 This was reflected
in the shift away from frailty after rehabilitation shown in figure
3. In part, this reflects the working of the Fried phenotype
model, which uses cut-points to define frailty, therefore in some
patients a subtle improvement would ‘declassify’ their frail state.
Nonetheless, our data validate the contemporary view of frailty
as a condition that is amenable to treatment.3 39 Treatments
with evidence of efficacy in frailty management include exercise,
nutritional support, self-management strategies and reduction of
polypharmacy.39 Many of these components have already been
operationalised to be delivered as pulmonary rehabilitation,
which raises the idea the model could be adapted to support
frail people outside of the respiratory specialty. Indeed, tailored
frailty programmes for older adults are being piloted within
geriatric medicine—the aims, structure and content of which are
similar to pulmonary rehabilitation.44 W
e believe there is an
opportunity to share learning, skills and component interven-
tions to benefit patients across settings.
There are limitations to consider. W
e purposefully selected
the Fried model which mainly reflects physical frailty and incor-
porates measures that are effort dependant or rely on patient
recall. However, the model has proven construct and predictive
validity and is the most established criterion measure of
frailty.3 7 9 Other frailty assessments may capture the broader
experience of the syndrome, for example, cognitive, social or
environmental.2 W
e only enrolled patients who attended for
pulmonary rehabilitation assessment, and there will likely be
patients with ‘hidden’ frailty who were referred but unable to
attend due to poor mobility or cognition. Our prevalence esti-
mate does not take this subgroup into account, but this may be
counterbalanced by the omission of asymptomatic patients with
COPD, who may not have been referred to hospital outpatient
or pulmonary rehabilitation clinics. W
e did not obtain outcomes
on participants declining or dropping out of rehabilitation;
therefore, our findings concerning clinical response to rehabili-
tation should not be generalised beyond those completing a pro-
gramme. As patients who were frail had the greatest levels of
impairment at baseline, regression to the mean may partially
accounts for the preferential response. However, this bias is
likely to be small and withholding rehabilitation from a control
group could be considered unethical. The differences in some
outcomes between patients who were frail and not-frail were, in
part, a product of the poor response for the 10% of the cohort
considered robust. This was most notable for exercise capacity
and health-related quality of life, which may reflect that this
fitter group had better preserved exercise capacity and health
status at enrolment, and therefore had alternative targets for
pulmonary rehabilitation. An example might be behavioural out-
comes such as daily physical activity, which increased signifi-
cantly in this group and to a greater extent to the prefrail and
frail groups. Finally, outcomes were obtained immediately fol-
lowing rehabilitation and may reflect a transient change in
frailty status. The value of these changes in COPD with respect
to long-term outcomes, for example, admissions and mortality,
will emerge in due course.
In conclusion, frailty affects one-quarter of patients with
stable COPD assessed for pulmonary rehabilitation. Frailty is an
independent risk factor for programme non-completion but
appears to result in favourable rehabilitation outcomes. Future
research should identify how best to support patients who are
frail through pulmonary rehabilitation.
