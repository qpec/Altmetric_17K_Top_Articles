Abstract
Rationale: Rates of adolescent electronic (e-) cigarette use are
increasing, but there has been little study of the chronic effects of use.
Components of e-cigarette aerosol have known pulmonary toxicity.
Objectives: To investigate the associations of e-cigarette use with
chronic bronchitis symptoms and wheeze in an adolescent
population.
Methods: Associations of self-reported use of e-cigarettes with
chronic bronchitic symptoms (chronic cough, phlegm, or bronchitis)
and of wheeze in the previous 12 months were examined in 2,086
SouthernCalifornia Children’s HealthStudy participants completing
questionnaires in 11th and 12th grade in 2014.
Measurements and Main Results: Ever e-cigarette use was
reported by 502 (24.0%), of whom 201 (9.6%) used e-cigarettes
during the last 30 days (current users). Risk of bronchitic symptoms
was increased by almost twofold among past users (odds ratio [OR],
1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37–2.49), compared with
never-users, and by 2.02-fold (95% CI, 1.42–2.88) among current
users. Risk increased with frequency of current use (OR, 1.66;
95% CI, 1.02–2.68) for 1–2 days and 2.52 (95% CI, 1.56–4.08)
for 3 or more days in past 30 days compared with never-users.
Associations were attenuated by adjustment for lifetime number
of cigarettes smoked and secondhand smoke exposure.
However, risk of bronchitic symptoms among past e-cigarette
users remained elevated after adjustment for relevant potential
confounders and was also observed among never–cigarette
users (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.11–2.59). There were no statistically
significant associations of e-cigarette use with wheeze after
adjustment for cigarette use.
Conclusions: Adolescent e-cigarette users had increased rates of
chronic bronchitic symptoms. Further investigation is needed to
determine the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on respiratory health.

Use of electronic (e-) cigarettes, including
vape pens, e-hookah, e-cigars, or other
electronic nicotine delivery systems has
increased rapidly worldwide in recent years.
In the United States, prevalence of
e-cigarette use in the previous 30 days among
high school students (ninth to 12th grade) in
the U.S. National Youth Tobacco Survey
increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 16.0% in
2015 (1) and in 2014 was estimated to be a
$2 billion (and rapidly growing) market (2).
The diversity of e-cigarette products, in
particular of products with flavorings, is also
increasing at a rapid rate. As of January
2014, there were 466 distinct brands of
electronic nicotine products and at least
7,764 unique flavors (2).
There has been little study of the chronic
health effects of e-cigarettes (3, 4). However, e-
cigarettes produce exposures with known
toxicity to the lung. These include flavorings,
volatile aldehydes, and oxidant metals present
in e-cigarette aerosol (5–8). In in vitro study
of human airway epithelial cells and in mouse
lungs, e-cigarette vapor produced oxidative
stress and inflammatory effects, and decreased
cell viability (9). Moreover, e-cigarettes deliver
an aerosol of ultrafine particles to the distal
airways and alveoli (10). Therefore, the lung
is a likely target organ for health effects of

 e-cigarettes. Two recent cross-sectional studies
of children found an association of e-cigarette
use with increased prevalence of bronchitic
symptoms (11) and asthma (12).
Detailed prospective information has
been collected on respiratory symptoms in
the Southern California Children’s Health
Study (CHS) (13), a cohort with low rates
of cigarette smoking and rapidly increasing
use of e-cigarettes. We evaluated the
associations of e-cigarette use with wheeze
and chronic bronchitic symptoms, which
are both common and account for
substantial morbidity in children (14).
These symptoms have been shown in the
CHS and other studies to be associated with
smoking and exposure to secondhand
tobacco smoke (SHS), ambient air
pollution, and other respiratory irritants
(14–19). The results of this study were
reported at the Society for Research on
Nicotine and Tobacco (Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, February 27, 2015).
Methods
Population
Participants were initially recruited into the
CHS cohort in 2002–2003, when they were
in kindergarten or first grade, from entire
classrooms in schools in 12 communities
in southern California (see the online
supplement) (13). The cohort was followed
annually through 2008, then every 2 years
through 2014. We now report findings from
the 2014 survey, when students were in 11th
and 12th grade (n = 2,097; 87% of 2,412
members of the cohort attending schools in
the study communities). Of these, 2,086
provided information on e-cigarette use and
either wheeze or bronchitic symptoms.
Mean age of this sample was 17.3 years
(SD, 0.6). Participants completed self-
administered questionnaires at school with
study staff supervision.
The study was approved by the
University of Southern California institutional
review board. Written informed consent was
obtained before data collection.
Outcomes
A child was considered to have had chronic
bronchitic symptoms during the previous
year, based on the report of a daily cough for
3 months in a row, congestion, or phlegm
other than when accompanied by a cold, or
bronchitis in the previous 12 months, as
previously described (15). Wheeze was
assessed based on a report of wheezing or
whistling in the chest during the previous
12 months. Information on wheeze severity
in the past 12 months was collected, based on
any attacks of wheeze, sleep disturbance
caused by wheeze, or wheezing severe enough
to limit speech to only one or two words at a
time between breaths (20). Analyses were
based on subjects with complete information
on e-cigarette use, including 1,922 subjects
also not missing information and not
reporting “don’t know” regarding bronchitic
symptoms, and 2,083 subjects not missing
wheeze information. Information on these
conditions was collected at each visit during
the prior prospective follow-up of the cohort,
as previously described (21).
Tobacco Product Use
The 2014 questionnaire assessed use of
tobacco products, including cigarette, cigar,
pipe, hookah, and e-cigarettes, based on
questions modified from the National Youth
Tobacco Survey (22). Students were asked the
age at which they had first tried cigarettes
or e-cigarettes and the number of days they
had used the product in the past 30 days.
Participants who had “never tried” a product
were classified as “never-users.” Those who
had used a product, but not in the last
30 days, were classified as “past users.”
Participants who had used a product on at
least 1 of the past 30 days were classified as
“current users” of that product. Frequency
of current e-cigarette use was categorized as
1–2 days or 3 or more days. In addition,
participants reported number of cigarettes
smoked in the previous month and the
lifetime number of cigarettes smoked.
Lifetime number of cigarettes smoked was
categorized as 0 (never-smokers), greater than
0–10, 11–99, and greater than 99 cigarettes.
Covariate Information
Asthma was based on participant’s self-report
of ever having had asthma (20). A parent-
completed questionnaire at study entry
assessed sociodemographic characteristics,
including child’s date of birth, sex, ethnicity
(Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, other),
parental education (highest level of education
of either parent, categorized as ,12th grade,
high school diploma or GED, some college,
college degree, or some graduate school or
higher), and acculturation based on language
of questionnaire (Spanish or English)
completed. Information on housing
conditions (including a history of mildew or
mold or of water damage or flooding in the
home while the child lived there, of a gas
stove, cockroaches, or carpeting in the
home), and ownership of a dog or cat, was
collected and updated periodically over the
course of follow-up by parent- or child-
completed questionnaire.
Information on SHS exposure inside
the home of the child was collected in each
questionnaire over the course of follow-up.
In 2014, perception of harm of e-cigarette
use was assessed by asking whether the
participant thought it would be bad for his
or her health, and was classified based on
whether the participant strongly agreed,
agreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed.
Statistical Analysis
Logistic regression was used to evaluate the
association of bronchitic symptoms and
current wheeze with e-cigarette use. Dummy
variables were created to assess effects of past
and current use, compared with never use,
and of frequency of use among current users.
The linear trend in effects of frequency of
current e-cigarette use was assessed across three
categories of use (never-users, 1–2, and 3 or
more d in the previous 30 d). Confounding
was assessed by including relevant covariates
in the model to see if the estimated e-cigarette
effect changed by more than 10%. The
estimate of e-cigarette associations with the
outcomes examined changed more after
adjustment for lifetime number of cigarettes
smoked than adjustment for other smoking
variables (categories of never, past, and current
smoking and number of cigarettes smoked in
past 30 d). Therefore, models were adjusted
for lifetime number of cigarettes. In
sensitivity analyses, associations of e-

 cigarettes with bronchitic symptoms and
wheeze were adjusted for these same
conditions in 2010 (before there was
widespread use of e-cigarettes) and were
restricted to children without symptoms in
2010. Based on previous epidemiologic
literature on associations of respiratory
irritants with bronchitic symptoms in
children (23), interaction terms of e-cigarette
use with a dog or cat at home were examined
for this outcome. For each outcome, the
interactions of sex, ethnicity (Hispanic and
non-Hispanic white), and asthma (in separate
models) with e-cigarette use were also
evaluated by calculating a likelihood ratio test
for models with and without the interaction
across categories of e-cigarette use. In all
models, missing data were assumed to occur
at random (see online supplement for
additional analytical details).
All analyses assumed a two-sided
alternative hypothesis at 0.05 level of
significance and were conducted using
STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp LLC,
College Station, TX).
Results
There were 502 participants (24.0%) who
had ever used e-cigarettes; 301 (14.4%) were
past and 201 (9.6%) current users. Among
current users, 107 (53.3%) used e-cigarettes
on 1–2 days monthly and 94 (46.8%) on
3 or more days. Among past and current
e-cigarette users, 132 (44.2%) and 81 (40.5%),
respectively, were never–cigarette users.
Compared with Hispanic white
participants, non-Hispanic white youth were
more likely to have bronchitic symptoms or
wheeze (Table 1). Parental education greater
than high school was associated with greater
risk of both outcomes. SHS exposure in the
home was associated with increased risk of
bronchitic symptoms but not of wheeze.
Current and noncurrent use of cigarettes was
associated with greater risk of each outcome.
A report of bronchitic symptoms or
wheeze on the 2010 questionnaire (before
e-cigarettes were widely available to this
cohort) was each associated with both
outcomes on the current (2014)
questionnaire (see Table E1 in the online
supplement). Other covariates positively
associated with both bronchitic symptoms
and wheeze included ever asthma (in 2014);
hookah, cigar, and pipe use; having a pet cat;
and a history of water damage or flooding in
the home. Effect estimates for current use of
each combustible tobacco product were
consistently larger than for past use. Parental
completion of the enrollment questionnaire
in Spanish was inversely associated with
both outcomes. A pet dog in the home was
associated only with bronchitic symptoms,
and mold or mildew in the home was
associated only with wheeze.
Bronchitic symptoms were associated
with both past (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.37–2.49) and
current use of e-cigarettes (OR, 2.02; 95%
CI, 1.42–2.88). These estimated effects were
robust to adjustment for sociodemographic
characteristics (Figure 1). They were
attenuated by additional adjustment for
lifetime number of cigarettes smoked and
SHS exposure in the home (OR, 1.71;
95% CI, 1.20–2.43 for past use) (OR, 1.41;
95% CI, 0.92–2.17 for current use). Further
adjustment for other tobacco product use,
other sociodemographic characteristics,
and housing conditions listed in Table E1
did not appreciably change the estimated
effect size and the association with past
e-cigarette use remained significant (results
not shown). We examined interactions of
e-cigarette use with sex, ethnicity (Hispanic
and non-Hispanic white), and asthma and
with a dog or cat in the home, none of
which was statistically significant.
The risk of bronchitic symptoms
increased with number of days used in the
previous 30 days (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.02–2.68
for 1–2 d) (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.56–4.08 for
>3 d), compared with never–e-cigarette
users (Figure 2) (P for trend ,0.001). This

 association with e-cigarette use frequency
was not confounded by demographic
characteristics, but was attenuated by
additional adjustment for SHS exposure and
lifetime number of cigarettes smoked (OR,
1.37; 95% CI, 0.79–2.37 for 1–2 d of use)
(OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.88–3.05 for >3 d of
use) and the trend was no longer significant
(P for trend 0.09).
In sensitivity analyses restricted to
never–cigarette smokers, the risks of
bronchitic symptoms associated with past
and current e-cigarette use were not as large
as observed in the unadjusted analysis of all
study participants but were unchanged by
adjustment for demographic characteristics
and SHS exposure (OR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.11–2.59 for past e-cigarette use after
adjustment) (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.89–2.61
for current e-cigarette use after adjustment)
(Figure 3). Effect estimates were similar in
magnitude to those observed in models of
the entire population adjusted for lifetime
smoking history shown in Figure 1. In
additional sensitivity analyses the pattern
of effect estimates for the association of
bronchitic symptoms with e-cigarette use
was similar after adjustment for
bronchitic symptoms in 2010 and in
analyses restricted to adolescents with no
bronchitic symptoms in 2010 (results not
shown).
Wheeze was associated with current
(OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.28–2.71) but not with
past use of e-cigarettes (OR, 1.02; 95% CI,
0.70–1.49) (Figure 4, left). The effect of
current e-cigarette use was not confounded
by sociodemographic characteristics but was
markedly attenuated by adjustment for SHS
exposure and lifetime number of cigarettes
smoked (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.78–1.98), and
after adjustment the association of past use
of e-cigarettes with wheeze became negative
(OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.45–1.10). The
magnitude of effect estimates for e-cigarette
exposure in analyses restricted to never-
smokers was similar to those found in the
entire population after adjustment for
sociodemographic characteristics, smoking
history, and SHS exposure (Figure 4, right).
The frequency of current use of e-cigarettes
was not associated with wheeze in either
unadjusted or adjusted models (results not
shown). In additional sensitivity analyses, we
examined associations of e-cigarette use with
more severe wheeze in the past year, based
on attacks of wheeze, sleep disturbance, or
shortness of breath caused by wheeze; the
pattern of associations was similar to that
observed with any wheeze in the previous
year (results not shown).
Discussion
Bronchitic symptoms were associated with
use of e-cigarettes among adolescents.
Associations with past, but not current,
use remained statistically significant
after adjustment for use of cigarettes and
other combustible tobacco products,
sociodemographic characteristics, and
respiratory risk factors in the home, including
SHS exposure. Bronchitic symptoms were
also associated with frequency of current use,
based on number of days of e-cigarette use in
the past month, but these effect estimates
were markedly attenuated and not statistically
significant after adjustment for lifetime
number of cigarettes smoked and SHS
exposure. There were no significant
associations of wheeze, a marker of allergic
airway disease, with use of e-cigarettes.
These findings contribute data to the
ongoing debate about the health effects of
e-cigarettes that has largely occurred in the
absence of evidence either of safety or of
harm, and the results are potentially
informative for clinicians asked to advise
patients and parents about the hazards of
e-cigarette use.
Bronchitis and chronic bronchitic
symptoms are common and have been
associated with substantial clinical
morbidity and economic cost (14, 24–26).
Bronchitis or questionnaire-based report of
persistent cough and phlegm are relatively
imprecise outcomes and likely represent a
heterogeneous complex of conditions,
including chronic, indolent respiratory
illness, asthma exacerbation, or chronic
airway inflammation. These outcomes
might also reflect repeated acute
exacerbations, including acute bronchitis
that has been reported to persist for several

 weeks and to have a marked impact on
quality of life, in adults and in children
(14, 27). Bronchitis and bronchitic
symptoms have shown robust
associations with diverse respiratory
hazards in previous epidemiologic
studies (15, 17–19), including with
childhood smoking and exposure to SHS
(17, 18). The magnitude of estimated
effect we observed was only a little
smaller than that previously reported to
occur as a result of occasional smoking in
an adolescent population (28). Therefore,
if causal, the observed association
between bronchitic symptoms and
e-cigarettes could have clinical, public
health, economic, and policy
implications.
Results were consistent with those
of a cross-sectional study of Chinese
adolescents, among whom a greater than
twofold increased risk of bronchitic
symptoms associated with e-cigarette
use was observed among never-smokers
(11). These associations are plausible
based on the known pulmonary toxicity
of e-cigarette aerosol composition,
including glycerol vapor, nicotine, and
other irritants that have been associated
with bronchitic and other respiratory
symptoms (3, 6–8, 29–33). Flavorings,
including diacetyl and related diketone
compounds that have a sweet or buttery
flavor, have caused bronchiolitis
obliterans, an obstructive lung disease,
in exposed workers and in animal
models (5). These diketone flavoring
compounds have been measured in
e-cigarette liquids at concentrations of
public health concern (34, 35). E-cigarette
solutions produced cytotoxicity and
proinflammatory effects that varied
markedly across brands and solutions,
depending at least in part on flavoring,
in in vitro models using cells relevant to
the lung (36, 37). A case report of
lipoid pneumonia was attributed to
recurrent exposure to glycerin-based
oils found in e-cigarette nicotine
vapor (38).
A previous study of Korean high
school students found increased risk of
asthma and more severe asthma in the
previous year to be associated with
e-cigarette use (12). E-cigarette aerosol
exposure also increased allergen-
induced airway inflammation and
hyperresponsiveness in an experimental
study in mice (39). In addition, acute
effects of e-cigarette vapor inhalation on
fractional excretion of nitric oxide, a
marker of airway inflammation, have been
observed (although the direction of effect
has not been consistent) (10, 40).
However, we found no association of
e-cigarette use with wheeze or wheeze
severity, markers of asthma activity. It is
possible that youth with asthma were
more likely to self-select not to use
e-cigarettes because of their disease.
However, history of asthma neither
confounded nor modified the association
of e-cigarette use with bronchitic
symptoms, which might be expected to be
subject to similar self-selection.

 The study has several strengths, including
well-characterized covariates of respiratory
symptoms in a large ethnically diverse sample
of adolescents. Limitations to the inference of a
causal relationship between past e-cigarette
use and bronchitic symptoms include the
possibility that residual confounding by
smoking could have explained the
association with past use, if cigarette
smoking were not accurately measured,
because associations of bronchitic
symptoms with e-cigarette use were
attenuated by adjustment for smoking
history. However, low rates of smoking in
this cohort and substantial numbers of
e-cigarette users who were never-smokers
made it possible to disentangle the
independent associations of each
exposure. It is unlikely that cigarette
use explained the results, because an
association of bronchitic symptoms with
past use of e-cigarettes was also observed
among never-smokers and was similar in
magnitude to the estimated effects of past
e-cigarette use adjusted for cigarette use in
the entire population sample. Effects were
also robust to additional adjustment for a
large number of sociodemographic
factors, other combustible tobacco
product use, asthma, and other housing
characteristics (listed in Tables 1 and E1).
Although the adjusted association of
bronchitic symptoms with current
e-cigarette use was not statistically
significant, the strength of the association
was only modestly weaker than with past
users and the difference in estimates for
past and current use was not statistically
significant. It is also possible that those
adolescents who experienced symptoms
after trying e-cigarettes chose to stop,
becoming past users.
It is possible that study participants
with preexisting symptoms and an interest
in using tobacco products might have used
e-cigarettes because of a perception that they
were less toxic than cigarettes. However,
adjustment for perception of e-cigarette
harm did not confound the association
of past e-cigarette use with bronchitic
symptoms.
Only the 2014 questionnaire asked
about use of e-cigarettes and tobacco
products other than cigarettes. However,
information on bronchitic symptoms
collected in 2010 tracked over time
(see Table E1), so adjusting the observed
cross-sectional associations for bronchitic
symptoms in previous years provided an
opportunity to account for unmeasured
determinants of symptoms. Because there
was little adolescent e-cigarette use in the
United States in 2010 and likely little use
of other tobacco products (at cohort
average age 13), by adjusting for 2010
symptoms it was possible to assess
prospectively the change in symptoms
associated with e-cigarette use. It is,
therefore, more likely that the observed
(2014) relationship of bronchitic
symptoms with e-cigarette use was causal,
because the e-cigarette effect estimates
were unchanged after adjustment for
2010 symptoms and after restriction to
adolescents with no bronchitic symptoms
in 2010. However, the prevalence of 2010
bronchitic symptoms was also associated
with (subsequent) e-cigarette use.
Therefore, the possibility that the 2014
cross-sectional associations could be
explained by unmeasured confounders
associated with e-cigarette use cannot be
excluded. Further longitudinal follow-up
of this and other cohort studies of
respiratory health in children, and
complementary experimental studies,
are needed to elucidate these
relationships.
Several public health and research
organizations, including the Forum of
International Respiratory Societies, the
American Association for Cancer
Research, and the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (41), have proposed
regulation to restrict or ban e-cigarettes
until there is more evidence of the safety
of e-cigarette use (42). The Food and
Drug Administration recently finalized a
rule to extend its authority over all tobacco
products, including e-cigarettes (43).
This rule will prohibit the sale of
e-cigarette products to persons
younger than age 18 years and will
prohibit sale of e-cigarettes in vending
machines and the distribution of free
samples. Our results suggest that reducing
e-cigarette use in youth may reduce
morbidity. However, because e-cigarette use
is still new, there has been little study of its
chronic effects. Additional epidemiologic
and toxicologic investigation of effects of
chronic e-cigarette exposure is urgently
needed. n
