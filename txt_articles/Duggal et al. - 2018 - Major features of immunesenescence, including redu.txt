Summary
It is widely accepted that aging is accompanied by remodelling of the immune sys-
tem including thymic atrophy and increased frequency of senescent T cells, leading
to immune compromise. However, physical activity, which influences immunity but
declines dramatically with age, is not considered in this literature. We assessed
immune profiles in 125 adults (55–79 years) who had maintained a high level of
physical activity (cycling) for much of their adult lives, 75 age-matched older adults
and 55 young adults not involved in regular exercise. The frequency of na€
ıve T cells
and recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were both higher in cyclists compared with inac-
tive elders, and RTE frequency in cyclists was no different to young adults. Com-
pared with their less active counterparts, the cyclists had significantly higher serum
levels of the thymoprotective cytokine IL-7 and lower IL-6, which promotes thymic
atrophy. Cyclists also showed additional evidence of reduced immunesenescence,
namely lower Th17 polarization and higher B regulatory cell frequency than inactive
elders. Physical activity did not protect against all aspects of immunesenescence:
CD28�veCD57+ve senescent CD8 T-cell frequency did not differ between cyclists
and inactive elders. We conclude that many features of immunesenescence may be
driven by reduced physical activity with age.

INTRODUCTION
Aging is accompanied by a decline in immune competence, termed
immunesenescence, which is characterized by an increased risk of
infections and chronic inflammatory diseases, poor vaccine efficacy,
failure to maintain immunity to latent infections such as Varicella
Zoster and increased autoimmunity (DiCarlo, Fuldner, Kaminski &
Hodes,
2009;
Montecino-Rodriguez,
Berent-Maoz
&
Dorshkind,
2013). The mechanisms underlying this compromised immunity
include involution of the thymus, which begins in early adulthood in
humans and accelerates rapidly after 40 years of age (Mitchell, Lang
& Aspinall, 2010). Thymic atrophy involves a decrease in both stro-
mal and thymocyte cellularity with infiltration of adipocytes, loss of
tissue organization with the net outcome being a reduced na€
ıve T-
cell output (Palmer, 2013). In humans, but not mice, maintenance of
na€
ıve T-cell numbers into adulthood occurs through homeostatic

 proliferation and retention in secondary lymphoid tissues (Thome
et al., 2016). Other hallmarks of T-cell immunesenescence include
the following: accumulation of CD28�ve CD57+ve T cells with short-
ened telomeres and reduced proliferative capacity (Di Mitri et al.,
2011), which also acquire NK cell receptors such as KLRG1 (Weng,
Akbar
&
Goronzy,
2009)
increasing
the
risk
of
autoimmune
responses, skewing of T-cell responses towards Th17 cell differentia-
tion (Ouyang et al., 2011). Although less well evidenced, some stud-
ies also suggest altered regulatory capacity with age with older
adults showing increased Treg frequency (reviewed in Jagger, Shimo-
jima, Goronzy & Weyand, 2014) but lower frequency and IL-10 pro-
duction by CD19+ve CD24hi CD38hi suppressive B cells (Duggal,
Upton, Phillips, Sapey & Lord, 2013). Another feature of human
aging is an increase in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytoki-
nes (IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa,) termed Inflammaging, which several popula-
tion-level studies have associated with increased risk of age-related
disease and mortality (Franceschi et al., 2007).
What confounds these human studies is that physical activity is
not taken into account in either cross-sectional or longitudinal stud-
ies of immune aging. The majority of older adults are largely seden-
tary and fail to meet the recommended guidelines for physical
activity of 150 min of aerobic exercise per week. Regular physical
activity in older adults has been associated with lower levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFa (Gleeson et al., 2011),
improved neutrophil chemotaxis (Bartlett et al., 2016) and NK cell
cytotoxicity
(Woods
et al.,
1999),
increased
T-cell
proliferation
(Woods et al., 1999) and improved vaccination responses (Kohut
et al., 2005). Thus, the current literature on immunesenescence is
not able to determine which aspects of age-related immune change
are driven by extrinsic factors and which may be the consequence
of a constitutive aging programme.
Here, we studied several aspects of the adaptive immune system
in highly physically active, nonelite older individuals (master cyclists)
in which we have shown the maintenance of a range of physiological
functions previously reported to decline with age (Pollock et al.,
2015). We show that compared with more sedentary older adults,
the cyclists show reduced evidence of a decline in thymic output,
inflammaging and increased Th17 cell responses, although accumula-
tion of senescent T cells still occurred. We reveal high serum levels
of IL-7 and IL-15 and low IL-6, which would together provide a thy-
moprotective environment (Lynch et al., 2009) and also help to
maintain na€
ıve T cells in the periphery (Wallace et al., 2006). We
conclude that maintained physical activity into middle and old age
protects against many aspects of immune aging which are in large
part lifestyle driven.

RESULTS
Immune cell phenotype was determined in peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMC). The sample size in each analysis varies slightly
due to cell availability varying between donors and does not reflect
the removal of any outlier data.

The effect of long-term physical activity on
T-cell subset distribution
On comparing total T-cell frequency in the PBMC fraction between
healthy young donors, healthy old sedentary donors and old master
cyclists, significant differences were observed, F(2, 244) = 11.64,
p < .001, b = .08. CD3+ve, T-cell frequency was lower in healthy old
sedentary adults compared with young donors, p < .005. This decline
was not seen in the master cyclists as their T-cell frequency was
higher than the inactive elders, p = .0003 (Figure 1a) and not differ-
ent from the young adults.
The frequency of na€
ıve and memory CD8 T cells between the
three groups also differed. For na€
ıve CD8 T cells, F(2, 244) = 91.48,
p = .0002, b = .42, we found a lower frequency in healthy old
sedentary adults compared with young donors (p = .0001) indicative
of the well-documented reduction in thymic output with age (Mitch-
ell et al., 2010; Palmer, 2013). However, na€
ıve CD8 T cell frequency
did not decline to the same extent in master cyclists being signifi-
cantly higher than healthy old sedentary adults (p = .001), but lower
than that seen in young adults, p = .001 (Figure 1b). The frequency
of memory CD8 T cells was also different between the groups F(2,
244) = 90.65, p < .001, b = .42, due to a higher frequency in healthy
old sedentary adults in comparison with young adults, p < .0001 and
master cyclists, p = .0002 (Figure 1c). However, the cyclists did have
a higher frequency of these cells than young subjects, p < .0001,
suggesting that maintained physical activity did not entirely prevent
the expansion of memory cells.
We similarly compared the distribution of na€
ıve and memory
CD4 T cells and memory cell subsets between the groups, and here,
the differences were more marked than for CD8 cells. The frequency
of na€
ıve CD4 T cells varied across the groups, F(2, 244) = 16.43,
p < .0001, b = .11, with lower values in healthy old sedentary adults
in comparison with young donors, p = .0001. This did not occur in
the cyclists who had a higher frequency of na€
ıve cells than the
sedentary older adults, p = .01, but a lower frequency than young
subjects, p = .005 (Figure 1d). There was a higher frequency of
memory CD4 T cells across the groups, F(2, 244) = 15.69, p < .0001,
b = .11, with frequency higher in old sedentary adults compared
with young donors, p = .0001 (Figure 1e). The cyclists had a higher
frequency of CD4 memory T cells than the young subjects, p < .05,
but the frequency was lower than for the sedentary older adults,
p = .003.
Further analysis of the distribution of memory T-cell phenotypes
revealed that central memory CD8 T cells were at a higher fre-
quency
in
old
sedentary
adults
compared
with
young
adults,
p = .0001 only, with no significant differences with the master
cyclists, p = .29. The frequency in the cyclists was also higher than
the young adults, p < .001 (Figure 2a). For effector memory CD8 T
cells, there was a significant increase in frequency in both old seden-
tary adults and cyclists in comparison with young donors, p = .0001
and
p = .0001,
respectively
(Figure 2b).
The
differences

 young donors, p = .0001 and master cyclists p = .0001, although
EMRA frequency was raised in cyclists compared with young sub-
jects, p < .05 (Figure 2c). There were no differences in the CD4
effector (Figure 2d) and central memory (Figure 2e) subsets between
the groups although CD4 EMRA cells were raised in the sedentary
old group compared with young adults, p < .001 and the cyclists,
p < .005 (Figure 2f).

Physical activity and senescent T cells
Despite expressing telomerase to stem telomere attrition and sup-
port extensive proliferation during antigen challenge, T cells have a
finite replicative potential and repeated cell division results in
shortened telomeres and cell senescence (Fletcher et al., 2005).
We
therefore
determined whether a
physically active lifestyle
could modify the accumulation of senescent T cells with age.
CD28 and CD57 are among the cell surface markers that used to
identify senescent T cells in humans (Onyema et al., 2012). On
examining CD28�ve CD57+ve CD4 T cells, a significantly higher fre-
quency was observed in
old sedentary adults compared with
young adults, p = .01, although cyclists did not show a raised level
of these cells, p = .47 (Figure 2g). A much higher frequency of
CD28�ve CD57+ve CD8 T cells was observed compared to senes-
cent CD4 cells overall, and in both old sedentary adults and mas-
ter cyclists, the frequency of senescent cells was higher compared
with young adults and master cyclists, p = .005 and p = .0001,
respectively (Figure 2h).

The effect of long-term physical activity on
B-cell subset distribution
B cells can be divided into four subsets on the basis of CD27 and
IgD expression (Figure 3a): na€
ıve (CD27�ve IgD+ve); switched mem-
ory (CD27+ve IgD�ve) and unswitched memory (CD27+ve IgD+ve) B
cells (Shi, Agematsu, Ochs & Sugane, 2003). The CD27�ve IgD�ve
subset is also a memory cell population (Wei et al., 2007), although
much less is known of its functional significance. Comparing the
peripheral B-cell frequency between these groups, significant differ-
ences were observed, F(2, 238) = 12.48, p = .0001, b = .09, driven
by a lower frequency in old sedentary adults, p = .0001 in compar-
ison with young donors, with cyclists not different from the seden-
tary elders and showing a lower frequency than young subjects,

 p = .0001 (Figure 3b). In contrast to the na€
ıve T-cell data, we found
a lower frequency of naive B cells in both old sedentary adults,
p = .0001 and the master cyclists, p = .005 in comparison with
young donors, although master cyclists had a higher frequency of
na€
ıve B cells than old sedentary adults, p = .003 (Figure 3c). Further,
for switched memory B cells, we observed a higher frequency in old
sedentary adults, p = .0001 and master cyclists, p = .0001 compared
with young subjects, although frequency was lower in the cyclists
than the more sedentary older adults, p < .05 (Figure 3d). For
unswitched memory B cells, there was a higher frequency in healthy
old sedentary adults in comparison with young donors, p = .0001
and master cyclists, p = .0001, with no difference between master
cyclists and young adults, p = .89 (Figure 3e). Finally, the CD27�ve
IgD�ve subset also differed slightly between our groups with lower
frequency in the sedentary old subjects compared to both young
adults, p = .01 and the master cyclists, p = .01 (Figure 3f).
In summary, the data confirm the extensive literature showing
that the frequency of naive T and B cells is reduced with age, but

Maintained physical activity in adulthood and
thymic output
The higher frequency of naive T cells in the master cyclists suggests
that thymic output may be better preserved in these adults than their
less physically active peers. PTK7 has been identified as a marker of
recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), comprising CD4 T cell populations
with high levels of TRECs (Haines et al., 2009). The frequency of
PTK7+ve CD45RA+ve CD4 T cells differed between the groups, F(2,
242) = 24.81, p = .0001, b = .18, with a significantly higher frequency
in master cyclists compared with old sedentary adults, p = .0001, but
with no difference to that seen in young adults (Figure 4a).
Within the CD8 pool, CD103+ve na€
ıve cells display high TREC
levels and have been identified as a population of RTEs (McFarland,

 Douek, Koup & Picker, 2000). The frequency of CD103+ve na€
ıve
CD8
T
cells
differed
between
our
groups,
F(2,
240) = 18.55,
p = .0001, b = .15, with a higher frequency in master cyclists in
comparison with old sedentary adults, p = .0001, but lower than
young adults, p = .0017 (Figure 4b).
We next wanted to determine whether the positive effects of
maintained physical activity on thymic output were due to an effect
on progenitor cells entering the thymus. CD3�ve CD19�ve CD14�ve
CD34+ve CD10+ve cells have been identified as thymic immigrants
(Bender et al., 1991), and their frequency differed between our
groups, F(2, 235) = 5.25, p = .006, b = .04. This difference was dri-
ven by a higher frequency in master cyclists compared with old
sedentary adults, p = .01, although the frequency in cyclists was
lower than in young subjects, p = .01 (Figure 4c).
These data suggest a beneficial effect of long-term physical activ-
ity on thymic output. We thus explored factors that might be con-
tributing towards a maintained thymic output in the cyclist cohort. On
measuring serum levels of a thymosuppressive cytokine IL-6 (Sem-
powski et al., 2000), significant differences were seen between the
three groups, F(2, 224) = 12.24, p = .0001, b = .09, with higher IL-6
levels in old sedentary adults compared with both young donors,
p = .0001 and old cyclists, p = .0001. IL-6 levels in the cyclists were
only slightly higher than in young subjects, p = .04 (Figure 5a). Cortisol
also affects thymic cellularity negatively (Roggero et al., 2006). Analy-
sis of serum cortisol levels in the three groups revealed significant dif-
ferences F(2, 241) = 12.79, p = .0001, b = .09, driven by higher levels
in sedentary older adults in comparison with young donors, p = .002.
However, the master cyclists also had higher cortisol levels than the
young adults, p = .0001 (Figure 5b).
IL-7 is a critical growth factor in early T-cell development and is
thymoprotective (Plum, DeSmedt, Leclercq, Verhasselt & Vanderker-
ckhove, 1996). Significant differences were observed for serum IL-7
between the three groups, F(2, 244) = 9.83, p = .0001, b = .07, with
the cyclists having significantly higher levels compared to both old
sedentary adults, p < .0001 and young subjects, p < .01 (Figure 5c).
Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is another protein important in
thymus organogenesis and maintenance, and KGF administration in
aged mice increases thymic size and thymocyte production (Alpdo-
gan et al., 2006). No significant differences were seen in serum KGF
levels between the groups, F(2, 244) = .80, p = .44, b = .007; (Fig-
ure 5d).
Another possible explanation of maintained na€
ıve T-cell popula-
tions in the cyclists is their expansion and retention in the periphery.
IL-15 contributes to the maintenance of na€
ıve T-cell populations by
promoting survival and expansion of na€
ıve T cells in the periphery,
without leading to telomere shortening (Wallace et al., 2006). Serum
IL-15
levels
in
the
three
groups
differed
significantly,
F(2,
236) = 3.30, p = .03, b = .03, and the master cyclists had higher
levels than old sedentary adults, p = .001 and young adults, p = .01
(Figure 5e). We also found a modest positive correlation between
serum IL-15 levels and the frequency of na€
ıve CD4 T cells R2 = .02,
p = .02, b = .15 (Figure 5f).

Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells in physically active
older adults
Effector CD4 T cells have been classified into several subsets includ-
ing Th1, Th2 and Th17 on the basis of their cytokine production. On
measuring the frequency of IFNc+ve CD4 T cells (Th1) poststimula-
tion with PMA and ionomycin, we found a lower frequency in both
old sedentary adults, p = .0001 and master cyclists, p = .0001 com-
pared to young adults (Figure 6a). Comparing the IL-4+ve CD4 T cells
(Th2) poststimulation, significant differences were again seen with a
higher frequency in old sedentary adults compared to young,
p = .02, but the master cyclists had a lower frequency of Th2 cells
compared to both the old sedentary adults, p = .006 and young
adults,
p = .007
(Figure 6b).
Consequently
the
Th1/Th2
ratio
between the groups differed, F(2, 216) = 7.34, p = .001, b = .06,
with a lower ratio in old sedentary adults, p = .0009 and master
cyclists, p = .008 compared to young adults (Figure 6c). The fre-
quency of IL-17+ve CD4 T cells (Th17) poststimulation was higher in
old sedentary adults compared to young subjects, p = .008 and
cyclists, p = .0001, with no difference between the cyclists and
young adults (Figure 6d).

Regulatory T and B cells
Foxp3-expressing CD25+veCD4 T cells have been classified as regu-
latory T cells, Tregs (Hori & Sakaguchi, 2003). The frequency of these
cells differed between the three groups F(2, 241) = 11.93, p < .001,
b = .09, with higher frequency in old sedentary adults in comparison
with young adults, p = .0001 and the cyclists, p = .0001, with no dif-
ference between the young adults and cyclists (Figure 7a). We also
measured IL-10 production by CD4 T cells poststimulation with
PMA and ionomycin as a measure of regulatory potential and found
differences between the three groups F(2, 204) = 5.25, p = .006,
b = .05, with a higher frequency in old sedentary adults compared
to young donors, p = .02 and old cyclists, p = .0001 (Figure 7b).

DISCUSSION
Remodelling of the immune system with age in humans has been
assumed to be an inherent process characterized by immunodefi-
ciency, low-grade chronic systemic inflammation and increased risk
of autoimmunity. However, the studies that have generated this
assumption are confounded by not considering the impact of
physical inactivity, which influences immunity and increases dra-
matically with age in humans. Even studies in animal models such
as mice will be influenced, unless the mice are provided with the
option to exercise, as laboratory-housed animals are likely more
sedentary than in the wild. This study aimed at determining to
what extent the phenomenon of immunesenescence may be a
consequence of our modern sedentary lifestyles and is an extrinsi-
cally driven process rather than an endogenous developmental
programme.
We show here that the effect of maintained high-level physical
activity on T-cell subset distribution is profound. One of the most
striking and unexpected findings was the high frequency of CD4 and
CD8 RTEs in the master cyclists, being higher than in the healthy
but more sedentary older adults who had not been involved in a
high level of physical activity in adulthood and equivalent to that
seen in our young cohort in the case of CD4 RTEs. The thymus has
been shown to be responsive to acute exercise interventions previ-
ously, with acute exercise inducing an increase in the na€
ıve: memory
T-cell ratio in both aged mice (Woods, Ceddia, Zack, Lowder & Lu,
2003) and humans (Simpson, 2011). However, these studies did not
consider RTEs and it is possible that these changes, at least in the
humans, were driven by a reduction in lymphocyte margination.
Here, the subjects had not exercised in the previous 24 hr, and thus,
we were assessing a stable effect. The thymoprotective effect of
maintained physical activity is important as reduced thymic output
following thymic involution is a key element of immunesenescence
affecting the ability to respond to vaccinations and novel pathogens
in the environment. Moreover, the degree of reduction in thymic
output has been proposed as a determinant of mortality in older
adults (Ferrando-Mart�
ınez et al., 2013).
The thymic microenvironment undergoes architectural and phe-
notypic changes with age including loss of stromal epithelial niches,
reduced numbers of thymic epithelial cells, replacement of lymphoid
tissue with adipose tissue reducing active areas of thymopoiesis
(Chinn, Blackburn, Manley & Sempowski, 2012; Dixit, 2010). We
have investigated the potential mechanisms by which regular exer-
cise through adulthood exerts a positive effect on thymic output.

 as IL-7, have been reported in mice (Andrew & Aspinall, 2001), and
IL-7 administration in older mice (Pido-Lopez, Imami, Andrew & Aspi-
nall, 2002) and rhesus macaques (Aspinall et al., 2007) has been
shown to enhance thymopoiesis and increase export of RTEs. Impor-
tantly, recent studies have shown that IL-7 is produced by human
skeletal muscle (Haugen et al., 2010), providing a possible explana-
tion for raised levels in the cyclists who did not lose muscle mass
with age (Pollock et al., 2015). Thymosuppressive factors, such as
leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M and IL-6, have been
reported to be elevated in the aged thymus (Sempowski et al.,
2000). Here, we found raised levels of serum IL-7 and lower levels
of IL-6 in our cyclists, which would all support thymic maintenance.
Furthermore, IL-15 plays a role in regulating immune homeostasis,
acting as a lymphocyte survival factor especially for na€
ıve T cells
(Wallace et al., 2006) and is also an exercise responsive hormone
(Pedersen & Febbraio, 2012). Our cohort of cyclists had higher IL-15
levels than sedentary old participants and young adults, and we
observed a significant although modest positive correlation between
serum IL-15 and peripheral na€
ıve CD4 T cells, suggesting that IL-15
is another contributing factor towards the maintenance of the na€
ıve
cell pool in the cyclists.
Hematopoietic stem cells show an age-associated skewed differ-
entiation towards myeloid progenitors (Chambers, 2007) and studies
in aged mice have reported fewer numbers of thymocyte progenitor
cells compared to young mice (Min, Montecino-Rodriguez & Dor-
shkind, 2004). Although not as well defined as in mice a population
of potential thymic progenitors has been identified in humans
(Bender et al., 1991), and we show here an age-associated reduction
in their frequency in the circulation, which can also be prevented
with long-term physical activity. The high level of RTEs in our
cyclists is thus likely to be a result of both an increased number of
thymocyte progenitor cells entering the thymus as well as an
improved thymic microenvironment to promote their development
and release.
Aging is also accompanied by an increase in the frequency of
memory T cells and accumulation of senescent CD28�veCD57+ve T
cells, with the effects most marked in the CD8 pool (Fletcher et al.,
2005). In our study, long-term physical activity in adulthood, with
accompanying maintained thymic output, was not able to prevent
the increase in the frequency of CD8 memory cells, although the
increase was lower than for sedentary adults, or the accumulation of
senescent CD28�ve, CD57+ve T cells which was the same in the
master cyclists and inactive elders. One cross-sectional study has
reported lower senescent T cells in physically active elders, but in
that study, 52- to 61-year-olds were considered as old (Spielmann
et al., 2011) which might partially explain the difference in our find-
ings. As the accumulation of memory cells and differentiation of T
cells towards the CD28�ve CD57+ve cells are driven largely by anti-
gen exposure, including to latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus
(Fletcher et al., 2005), it is perhaps not surprising that these immune
cell changes were not counteracted by the active lifestyle of the
cyclists. Indeed, analysis of CMV seropositivity in our cyclists found
that 51% were CMV-positive, which is only slightly lower than the
incidence reported for adults in this age range in the United

 Kingdom (Vyse, Hesketh & Pebody, 2009). The analysis of the mem-
ory cell subsets revealed that the large increase in CD8 EMRA cell
frequency seen in the sedentary older adults was less marked in the
cyclists, despite CD28�ve CD57+ve cells being a component of this
subset. Further analysis will be required to identify other elements
of the EMRA subset which are increased in the sedentary elders but
not the cyclists.
Aging is also associated with an increased potential to differenti-
ate to a Th17 phenotype (Ouyang et al., 2011), but little is known of
the effects of physical activity on Th17 cell differentiation. We
found a significant decline in Th17 cells in the master cyclists and as
IL-6 plays an important role in inducing Th17 cells (Weaver, Hatton,
Mangan & Harrington, 2007), the reduced serum IL-6 in these adults
may underlie the reduced Th17 skewing. Regulatory T cells play a
central role in maintaining the delicate balance between pathogenic
and protective immune responses. IL-10 secretion is one mechanism
used by Tregs to mediate immune suppression. An age-associated
increase in numbers of Tregs has been reported previously (Gregg
et al., 2005) and was observed here in the sedentary elders, but was
ameliorated in the cyclists. Wilson et al. have reported an increase in
circulating Tregs after an acute bout of intense exercise in athletes
(Wilson, Zaldivar, Schwindt, Wang-Rodriguez & Cooper, 2009); how-
ever, this could have been mediated by reduced margination in
response to adrenaline. It has been proposed that the increased
number of Tregs with age will favour development of Th17 responses
because regulatory T cells consume IL-2 that inhibits Th17 develop-
ment (O’Garra & Vieira, 2004). In our master cyclists, we saw lower
peripheral Tregs that might in turn contribute towards the reduced
Th17 polarization. The accumulation of senescent T cells, Th17
polarization,
elevated
levels
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
and
impairments in Bregs have all been identified as factors that might be
contributing towards the age-associated increase in risk of inflamma-
tory autoimmune disease (Duggal et al., 2013; Goronzy & Weyand,
2012), we would thus predict reduced risk of such conditions with
habitual physical activity.
The study has some limitations. The immune phenotyping data
are for cell frequency only, and as lymphocyte numbers fall with
age, it is possible that some of the differences between the young
subjects and cyclists may be less marked for cell numbers. How-
ever, total T-cell frequency did not decline in the cyclists suggest-
ing this shift away from lymphoid cell generation with age is also
ameliorated by physical activity. If lymphocyte numbers overall did
decline in both older subject groups, this would not affect the dif-
ferences between the cyclists and their inactive peers and these
differences could be even more marked. Also, we do not have
detailed historical physical activity data for the inactive older
cohort to complement the cyclists data (Pollock et al., 2015), but
we do know that they have not been involved in a high level of
sports such as cycling through their adult lives and thus are a valid
comparator group.
In conclusion, aging is a complex process involving the interac-
tion of a number of factors, including genetics, environment and life-
style. Our findings highlight that physical inactivity with age may be
a profound driver of several aspects of immunesenescence, most
notably reduced thymic output, changes to regulatory cell frequency
and function and T-cell polarization. Our future studies in this cohort
will aim to test immune function, notably the response to vaccina-
tion, as a clinical proof of the beneficial impact of physical activity
on adaptive immune function in old age.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
4.1
|
Participant characteristics and study design
A total of 125 amateur nonelite cyclists aged 55–79 years (84 males,
41 females) were recruited. The inclusion criteria for males were the
ability to cycle 100 km in under 6.5 hr while females had to cycle
60 km in under 5.5 hr, which subjects were required to have under-
taken at least twice in the 3 weeks prior to testing. This cohort has
been described in depth previously and had maintained their cycling
activity for much of their adult lives (Pollock et al., 2015). For com-
parison, we also recruited adults who did not partake in regular
physical activity: 75 clinically healthy older individuals aged 57–
80 years (43 males, 31 females) and 55 healthy young individuals
aged 20–36 years (30 males, 25 females) who were not involved in
regular intense exercise. A fasting venous blood sample was taken
from each subject between the hours of 08:00–10:00 after obtaining
written informed consent. At the time of blood sampling, none of
the subjects had an acute infection, or were taking any medication
known to alter immune function, and none had any chronic illness
including the older subjects. All subjects were instructed to refrain
from vigorous exercise 24 hr prior to blood sampling. Serum was
collected and frozen at �80°C for later hormone and cytokine analy-
sis. Blood samples collected in vacutainers with anticoagulants were
immediately processed to isolate mononuclear cells. The study was
approved by the Wandsworth Research Ethics Committee (reference
number 12/LO/0457) and the Black Country Research Ethics Com-
mittee (10/H1202/77).

Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density
centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque
TM PLUS (GE Healthcare, Sweden) as
described previously (Duggal, Upton, Phillips, Hampson & Lord,
2014). Isolated PBMCs were frozen down by resuspending cells in
freezing medium consisting of 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) in
heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (Biosera, UK), and the frozen cells
were then stored at �80°C for later phenotypic and functional anal-
ysis.

Immunostaining to identify T- and B-cell
subsets
Frozen PBMCs were thawed at 37°C and washed in RPMI 1640
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Postwashing, pelleted cells were resuspended in

DUGGAL ET AL.
 PBS (1 9 106 cells/ml) and stained with combinations of antibodies:
anti-human CD3-PEcy7 (eBiosciences, clone UCHT1); with either
anti-human CD4 Violet (eBiosciences, clone RPA-T4) or anti-human
CD8 PE (Immunotools, clone UCHT4) was used to identify the CD4
and CD8 T cells. T cells can be classified into four distinct subsets
on the basis of expression of cell surface markers, CCR7 and
CD45RA; na€
ıve (CD45RA+ve CCR7+ve), central memory (CD45RA�ve
CCR7
+ve), effector memory (CD45RA�ve CCR7�ve) and effector
memory RA (CD45RA+ve CCR7–ve) using anti-human CCR7 FITC (R
and D systems, clone 150503), anti-human CD45RA APC (Biolegend,
clone HI-100). Further phenotypes such as highly differentiated
senescent T cells and recent thymic emigrants, as described in the
results section or figure legends, were detected using the following
antibodies: anti-human CD28 APC (BD Biosciences, clone CD28.2),
anti-human CD57 FITC (eBiosciences, clone HCD57), anti-human
KLRG1 FITC (Biolegend, clone 2F1/KLRG1), anti-human HLADR
FITC (eBiosciences, clone H1.2F3), anti-human CD69 FITC (eBio-
sciences, clone FN50), anti-human CD25 (eBiosciences, clone BC96),
anti-human PTK7 (Miltenyi Biotech, clone׃188 B), anti-human CD103
(Miltenyi Biotech, clone Ber-ACT8), anti-human CD31 FITC (Biole-
gend, clone WM59), anti-human CD34 FITC (eBiosciences, clone
4H11) and anti-human CD10 APC (eBiosciences, clone CB-CALLA)
at 4°C for 20 min. For identification of B-cell subsets, PBMCs were
stained with combinations of antibodies including CD19-PE (eBio-
sciences, clone׃ HIB19), CD27-APC (eBiosciences, clone׃O323), IgD-
FITC (eBiosciences; clone׃ IA6-2) CD24-FITC (eBiosciences, clone׃
eBioSN3) and CD38-PEcy7 (eBiosciences, clone HIT2). Following
incubation, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS for flow cyto-
metric analysis using a Cyan
TM ADP flow cytometer (Dako). The gat-
ing strategy used to identify T-cell subsets (Duggal et al., 2014) and
Bregs (Duggal et al., 2013) has been reported previously. Data analy-
sis was carried out using SUMMIT software. Spectral overlap when
using more than one colour was corrected via compensation. Appro-
priate isotype controls were used for setting gates.

Serum cytokine and hormone-level assays
A Bio-plex cytokine assay for IL-6 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich,
Germany) was used for cytokine analysis using Luminex technology
and performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Data acqui-
sition and analysis were carried out using BIO-PLEX MANAGER software
version 6.0. Serum IL-7, KGF and IL-15 levels were measured by
Duo Set ELISA (R and D Systems, UK) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Serum cortisol levels were measured by ELISA using a
commercial kit (IBL International, Germany) and according to manu-
facturer’s instructions.

Stimulation of PBMCs to induce cytokine
production by CD4 T cells
PBMCs were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (both from Sigma-
Aldrich) in the presence of brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for
4 hr to determine the frequency of Th1 IFNc+ve, Th2 IL-4+ve and
Th17 IL-17+ve CD4 T cells as described previously (Duggal et al.,
2014).
4.6
|
CD3 stimulation of PBMCs to induce IL-10
production by CD19+veCD24hiCD38hi B cells
PBMCs were cultured in anti-CD3-coated wells for 72 hr and IL-10
expression measured by immunostaining of CD19+veCD24hiCD38hi B
cells as described previously (Duggal et al., 2013).
4.7
|
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS STATISTICS 20 soft-
ware (IBM software, UK). Univariate ANOVA with least significant
difference post hoc tests was used to assess differences between
the three groups. A Bonferroni correction was performed to adjust
for multiple comparisons. For normally distributed data, a Student’s t
test analysis was performed to assess differences between two con-
ditions. Statistical significance was determined at p < .05.
