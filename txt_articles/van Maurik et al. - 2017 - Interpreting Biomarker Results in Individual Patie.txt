IMPORTANCE Biomarkers do not determine conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) perfectly,
and criteria do not specify how to take patient characteristics into account. Consequently,
biomarker use may be challenging for clinicians, especially in patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE To construct biomarker-based prognostic models that enable determination of
future AD dementia in patients with MCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study is part of the Alzheimer’s Biomarkers in Daily
Practice (ABIDE) project. A total of 525 patients with MCI from the Amsterdam Dementia
Cohort (longitudinal cohort, tertiary referral center) were studied. All patients had their
baseline visit to a memory clinic from September 1, 1997, through August 31, 2014. Prognostic
models were constructed by Cox proportional hazards regression with patient characteristics
(age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score), magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) biomarkers (hippocampal volume, normalized whole-brain volume), cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) biomarkers (amyloid-β1-42, tau), and combined biomarkers. Data were analyzed from
November 1, 2015, to October 1, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical end points were AD dementia and any type of
dementia after 1 and 3 years.
RESULTS Of the 525 patients, 210 (40.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was
67.3 (8.4) years. On the basis of age, sex, and MMSE score only, the 3-year progression risk to
AD dementia ranged from 26% (95% CI, 19%-34%) in younger men with MMSE scores of 29
to 76% (95% CI, 65%-84%) in older women with MMSE scores of 24 (1-year risk: 6% [95%
CI, 4%-9%] to 24% [95% CI, 18%-32%]). Three- and 1-year progression risks were 86% (95%
CI, 71%-95%) and 27% (95% CI, 17%-41%) when MRI results were abnormal, 82% (95% CI,
73%-89%) and 26% (95% CI, 20%-33%) when CSF test results were abnormal, and 89%
(95% CI, 79%-95%) and 26% (95% CI, 18%-36%) when the results of both tests were
abnormal. Conversely, 3- and 1-year progression risks were 18% (95% CI, 13%-27%) and 3%
(95% CI, 2%-5%) after normal MRI results, 6% (95% CI, 3%-9%) and 1% (95% CI, 0.5%-2%)
after normal CSF test results, and 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%) and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-1%) after
combined normal MRI and CSF test results. The prognostic value of models determining any
type of dementia were in the same order of magnitude although somewhat lower. External
validation in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 showed that our models were
highly robust.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides biomarker-based prognostic models that
may help determine AD dementia and any type of dementia in patients with MCI at the
individual level. This finding supports clinical decision making and application of biomarkers
in daily practice.

 A
lzheimer disease (AD) has a long predementia phase
that is often referred to as mild cognitive impairment
(MCI). The cumulative progression incidence from
MCI to dementia is approximately 50% over 3 years.1,2 This
finding simultaneously implies that the other half of patients
with MCI will remain clinically stable or return to a normal
state. Therefore, there is an urgent need for individualized risk
assessments in patients with MCI.3

Methods
Participants
This study is part of the Alzheimer’s Biomarkers in Daily Prac-
tice (ABIDE) project.14 We included 525 patients with MCI from
theAmsterdamDementiaCohort(eFigure1intheSupplement).
InclusioncriteriawerebaselinediagnosisofMCI,availabilityof
Mini-MentalStateExamination(MMSE)scores,MRIand/orCSF
data, and at least 6 months of follow-up. All patients had their
baseline visit in our memory clinic from September 1, 1997,
throughAugust31,2014.DatawereanalyzedfromNovember1,
2015,toOctober1,2016.Weobtainedwritteninformedconsent
from all patients. The study was approved by the Medical Eth-
ics Review Committee of the VU University Medical Center,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All data were deidentified.
Diagnosticworkupconsistedofastandardized,1-daybase-
line assessment. Clinical diagnosis was made by consensus in
a multidisciplinary meeting.15 Until early 2012, the diagnosis
of MCI was based on the Petersen criteria.11 From 2012 on-
ward, we used the core clinical criteria of the NIA-AA for MCI.3

MRI Acquisition
Magneticresonanceimaging(availablein456patients[86.9%])
before2008wasperformedwitha1.5-TMRIscanner(Magnetom
Avanto, Vision, Impact, and Sonata, Siemens; Signa HDXT, GE
Healthcare).From2008onward,MRIofthebrainwasperformed
on a 3-T MRI scanner (MR750, GE Medical Systems; Ingenuity
TF PET/MR, Philips Medical Systems; and Titan, Toshiba
MedicalSystems).Allimagesweretakenaccordingtoastandard-
ized protocol,22 of which we only used sagittal 3-dimensional
T1-weighted images with coronal reformats in this study.
All images were reviewed by experienced neuroradiolo-
gists. Visual rating of MRIs was performed according to
established, validated semiquantitative visual rating scales
(medial temporal lobe atrophy scores, 0-4; global cortical at-
rophy scores, 0-3).23,24
Left and right hippocampal volumes (HCVs) were quanti-
fied using FSL FIRST (the integrated registration and segmen-
tationtooloftheOxfordCentreforFunctionalMRIoftheBrain)
and summed for analysis.25 Normalized whole-brain volumes
(NWBVs) were estimated with Structural Image Evaluation
using Normalization of Atrophy Cross-sectional (SIENAX).26
Volumetric data were available for 394 patients (75.0%).
CSF Analysis
The CSF samples (available in 417 patients [79.4%]) were
obtained by lumbar puncture, collected in polypropylene
tubes (Sarstedt), and processed according to international
guidelines.27-29 The CSF biomarkers Aβ1-42 and total tau were
measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays on a routine basis (Innotest, Fujirebio).9
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata 14SE software (StataCorp) for statistical analy-
ses. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to
construct prognostic models (determinants as continuous
measures; CSF biomarkers were log transformed). The mod-
els were based on complete cases only; therefore, the num-
ber of patients varied across models (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). The primary clinical end point was probable AD
dementia.12,16Patientswhoprogressedtodementianotcaused
Key Points
Question Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid
measures are associated with an increased risk of progression to
Alzheimer disease dementia, but how can we interpret biomarker
findings in individual patients with mild cognitive impairment?
Findings This cohort modelling study constructed
biomarker-based prognostic models (cerebrospinal fluid model,
magnetic resonance imaging model, and a combined model) that
can be applied in individual patients with mild cognitive
impairment, taking into account patient characteristics (age, sex,
and Mini-Mental State Examination score). The models show
particularly high negative predictive values, and external validation
showed that our models were highly robust.
Meaning These practical models could support clinical decision
making and facilitate application of magnetic resonance imaging
and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in daily practice.

andcensoredatthetimeofdiagnosisofnon-ADdementia.Sub-
sequently,werepeatedtheanalysiswithconversiontoanytype
of dementia as the clinical end point.
We first constructed a prognostic model based on the pa-
tient characteristics of age, sex, and MMSE score (demo-
graphic model; for comparison). We expanded this model with
MRI(HCVandNWBV)orCSF(Aβ1-42andtau).Finally,wecom-
bined the previous 2 models into 1 prognostic model contain-
ing CSF biomarkers (Aβ1-42 and tau) and MRI biomarkers (HCV
and NWBV) to allow a clinician to appreciate the combined
value of both modalities. We focused our report on the volu-
metric measures and provide a model for visual measure-
ments in the Supplement. In addition, we corrected the volu-
metricMRImodelsforfieldstrength.Interactioneffectsamong
biomarkers and between biomarker and patient characteris-
tics were included using backward selection. Effects were in-
cluded in the model if P ≤ .10. The prognostic accuracy of the
model was estimated by the Harrell C statistic.30 Three-year
and corresponding 1-year cumulative progression probabili-
ties with 95% CIs were calculated using the Stata survci
command.31 Because of variation in clinical follow-up visit
times, cutoffs were set at 3.5 years for 3-year follow-up and 1.5
years for 1-year follow-up. Specific probabilities of progres-
sion with accompanying CIs were read from the survival func-
tion for specific patients using the established models. As an
example, we determined probabilities of progression for men
and women, patients with a younger (60 years) and older (75
years) age, and those with an MMSE score of 29 and 24. We
selected the 20th percentile as abnormal and the 80th per-
centile as normal for each biomarker (for tau, 80th percentile
as abnormal and 20th percentile as normal) (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). When these models are used, any value can be
entered for the variables, resulting in a personalized value and
CI for each patient.
We internally validated the models by 5-fold cross-
validation. External validation was performed on the Alzhei-
mer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI-2) cohort (eAp-
pendix and eTable 1 in the Supplement). We fitted the
established models to z score–converted biomarker values and
calculated the Harrell C statistic.
Results
Of the 525 patients, 210 (40.0%) were female, and the mean
(SD) age was 67.3 (8.4) years. During a mean (SD) of 2.4 (1.0)
years of follow-up, 201 (38.3%) patients progressed to AD de-
mentia, 52 (9.9%) developed another type of dementia, and
272 (51.8%) remained stable (Table 1).32
We constructed models to determine AD-type dementia.
Thevariablesincludedineachmodel(demographicmodel,CSF
model,MRImodel,andcombinedmodel)andtheircorrespond-
ing regression coefficients are presented in Table 2. Risk esti-
mates in the models that included a single biomarker are pro-
vided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Inclusion of field strength
only slightly affected the models (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
To enable translation of findings to clinical practice, we used
the models to determine the risk of progression after a 3-year
follow-up,withacorresponding1-yearprogressionrisk.Cumu-
lative progression to AD dementia after 3 years occurred in 162
patients (30.9%) (58 [11.0%] after 1 year). Subsequently, as an
example, we estimated risk of progression for men and women
withayounger(60years)andolder(75years)ageandanMMSE
score of 29 and 24. The model based on sex, age, and MMSE
score only identified the highest risk of AD dementia for older
women with lower MMSE scores. The 3-year progression risk
ranged from 26% (95% CI, 19%-34%) in younger men with an
MMSE score of 29 to 76% (95% CI, 65%-84%) in older women
with an MMSE score of 24, and the corresponding 1-year pro-
gression risk ranged from 6% (95% CI, 4%-9%) in younger men
with an MMSE score of 29 to 24% (95% CI, 18%-32%) in older
women with an MMSE score of 24 (Table 3).
Next, we added biomarker values. For illustrative pur-
poses, we entered the 20th percentile of each biomarker as ab-
normal and the 80th percentile as normal. With these mod-
els, any value can be entered for the continuous variables,
resultinginindividualizedvalues.ThemodelthatincludedMRI
biomarkers showed that the main effects of HCV, NWBV, age,
and MMSE score were associated with AD dementia at
follow-up (Table 2). In the MRI model, age modified the prog-
nostic value of MRI measures (NWBV × age: β = 0.003,
SE = 0.002, P = .04). As an example, lower NWBV (20th per-
centile) increased the 3-year progression risk to 47% (95% CI,
33%-64%; 1 year: 10% [95% CI, 6%-16%]) in younger patients
with an MMSE score of 29 but not in older patients (35% [95%
CI, 25%-48%]; 1 year: 7% [95% CI, 4%-11%]). By contrast, ab-
sence of atrophy (80th percentile) decreased 3-year progres-
sion to 18% (95% CI, 13%-27%; 1 year: 3% [95% CI, 2%-5%]) in
younger patients with an MMSE score of 29 and to 24% (95%

forms similarly.
Subsequently,weconstructedaprognosticmodelwithCSF
biomarkers(containingAβ1-42andtau).Aβ1-42,tau,andMMSE
score were related to AD dementia at follow-up, whereas the
effect of age was excluded from the model (Table 2). Having
abnormal tau values was a stronger determinant of AD de-
mentia in patients with normal Aβ1-42 values (Aβ1-42 × tau:
β = 10.4365,SE = 2.8548,P < .001).TheCSFmodelshowedthat
abnormal biomarkers (Aβ1-42 and tau) increased 3-year pro-
gression risk to 82% (95% CI, 73%-89%) from a 1-year risk of
26% (95% CI, 20%-33%) in patients with an MMSE score of 24
and to 64% (95% CI, 53%-74%) in patients with an MMSE score
of 29 from a 1-year risk of 16% (95% CI, 11%-23%). By contrast,
the models showed a strong negative predictive value of CSF
biomarkers, with normal biomarkers (Aβ1-42 and tau) decreas-
ing 3-year progression risk to 6% (95% CI, 3%-9%) from a 1-year
risk of 1% (95% CI, 0.5%-2%) in patients with an MMSE score
of 29 and to 9% (95% CI, 5%-17%) from a 1-year risk of 2% (95%
CI, 1%-4%) in patients with a MMSE score of 24. The corre-
sponding C statistic of model performance was 0.75.
Finally, we combined both MRI measures and CSF bio-
markers in 1 model. In this model, the effect of HCV was not
significant(Table2).TheinteractioneffectbetweenAβ1-42and
tau remained significant (Aβ1-42 × tau: β = 10.4364;
SE = 2.8548; P < .001). The Figure shows isographs based on
the combined model and the probability of progression within
1 and 3 years by Aβ1-42 and tau, stratified for NWBV. Three-
year progression risk ranged from 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%) in pa-
tientswithanMMSEscoreof29andnormalbiomarkersto89%
(95% CI, 79%-95%) in patients with an MMSE score of 24 and
all abnormal biomarker results, and their corresponding 1-year
progression risk ranged from 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-1%) to 26%
(95% CI, 18%-36%) (Table 4). The corresponding C statistic of
model performance was 0.77.
Subsequently, we repeated the analyses with dementia as
the clinical end point, resulting in selection of the same vari-
ablesforthedemographicmodel(HarrellC = 0.59),MRImodel
(Harrell C = 0.67), and CSF model (Harrell C = 0.66) (eTable 5
in the Supplement). For the combined model, the interaction
between tau and Aβ1-42 was not included in the final model
via backward selection. The final model existed of tau, Aβ1-42,
NWBV, age, MMSE score, and an interaction between Aβ1-42
and age (Harrell C = 0.70).
Internal validation confirmed prognostic discrimination
in all 3 models (eTable 6 in the Supplement). External valida-
tion showed robustness of the models in the ADNI-2 (Harrell
C = 0.63 in the demographic model, 0.64 in the MRI model,
0.76 in the CSF model, and 0.73 in the combined model) (eFig-
ure 3 in the Supplement).
The models provide risk estimates for any given value of
each biomarker, taking full advantage of their continuous na-
ture.Onrequest,wecanprovideaspreadsheetcalculator,which

Discussion
In the present study, we constructed prognostic models that
provide a framework for a precision medicine approach by al-
lowingpersonalizedidentificationofclinicalprogressioninpa-
tients with MCI using an equation based on patient character-
istics and continuous biomarker values.
Clinicians show great variation in how they use and inter-
pret biomarkers related to MCI. This variation is partly attrib-
utable to the imperfection of these markers. In addition, bor-
derline (abnormal) or conflicting results are especially difficult
to interpret. Furthermore, the meaning of biomarkers de-
pends on the context as defined by the specific characteris-
tics of a patient. Therefore, many clinicians are reluctant to dis-
close biomarker results to patients with MCI.
The clinical relevance of biomarker results in terms of their
prognosticvalueforanindividualisnotclear.Althoughstudies
have repeatedly demonstrated the prognostic value of CSF and
MRI biomarkers, these studies almost invariably showed prog-
nosticvalueongrouplevel(highlysignificant),precludingdirect
translationtotheindividualpatient.Theinnovativeaspectofour
studyisthatourmodelsallowneurologiststointerpretindividual
patient data. We provide a calculator to translate hazard ratios
toprobabilities,whichareeasiertointerpretfromaclinicalper-
spective. Finally, we provide CIs around each individually esti-
mated probability. This process allows the clinician to appreci-
ate the imperfectness of each biomarker and, for example, can
helptheidentificationofbest-andworst-casescenarios.Assuch,
we believe that our models can support clinicians in interpret-
ingtestresultsandprovidethemwithatooltodetermineADde-
mentia risk for an individual patient, thereby enabling them to
start treatment or provide more accurate patient management.
Ofnote,themodelsmayhaveparticularvalueinthecaseofnor-
mal biomarkers because the models revealed the negative pre-
dictive value of the MRI and CSF biomarkers.33,34
The model with both MRI and CSF measures provided the
best prognostic value, which reveals the complementary value
of both types of diagnostic tests and matches observations in
earlier studies.6,35,36 When evaluating individual modalities,

 explored an optimal set of variables of progression from MCI to
ADdementia,nottakingintoaccounttheriskdifferencesrelated
to specific patient characteristics available without further di-
agnostic workup. We deliberately determined interactions be-
tweenbiomarkersandpatientcharacteristicstosecureoptimal
interpretationofbiomarkerresultsforADdementiariskinindi-
vidual patients. In agreement with an earlier study,40 we found
that MRI markers, particularly low NWBV, were more accurate
indeterminingADdementiariskinyoungercomparedwitholder
patients.Thisfindingmaybeexplainedbythefactthatatanolder
age, brain atrophy occurs in general and is not always related to
underlyingneurodegenerativedisease.Severalstudies41,42found
that CSF AD biomarker performance also varies as a function of
age because amyloid pathologic findings increase with age. In
ourstudy,wefoundnosuchageeffectwhendeterminingtherisk
ofADdementia.Bycontrast,whenexaminingtheriskofanytype
of dementia, the prognostic value of amyloid was stronger in
youngerpatients.Thisfindingmightfitwiththenotionthatwith
increasing age, dementia is more often attributable to multiple
pathologic findings and less often attributable to AD.
We used volumetric MRI measurements, which tend to be
better determinants of AD dementia in patients with MCI than
a qualitative rating or the assessment MRIs.43 To account for
changes in measurements attributable to scanner differ-
ences, we included field strength as an additional determi-
nant in the models. Of note, this factor did not improve the
prognostic performance, a finding that shows the robustness
of our models for scanner differences. Volumetric measures
arenotyetapplicableindailypractice.However,softwaretools
are in development to enable quantitative analysis of MRI in
daily practice.44-46 Because qualitative rating is used more fre-
quently by clinicians, we also constructed prognostic models
for medial temporal lobe atrophy and global cortical atrophy
visual rating with broadly similar performance. These mod-
els can be found in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Limitations
A potential limitation of this study is the mean (SD) follow-up
period of 2.4 (1.0) years, which was short and varied among pa-
tients. Therefore, we did not have sufficient power to deter-
mine a 5-year outcome. In addition, we cannot completely rule
outcircularityindiagnosticreasoningbecauseinformationfrom
MRIandCSFbiomarkerswasavailablefortheclinicianatfollow-
up. To reduce the effect of this risk of circularity, we included
anytypeofdementiaasanadditionalclinicalendpoint.Thesyn-
drome diagnosis of dementia is not influenced by knowledge
of biomarkers because this diagnosis is a reflection of clinical
functioning only. Furthermore, the outcome of any type of de-
mentia may be considered to have more clinical relevance than
that of AD dementia as long as there are no disease-modifying
therapiesavailable.Themodelsforbothoutcomeswerelargely
comparable, although the prognostic performance of the mod-
els for any type of dementia was slightly lower. This outcome
was expected because we primarily evaluated AD biomarkers.
An alternative approach would be the use of continuous out-
come measures, such as the MMSE or Clinical Dementia Rat-
ing Scale–Sum of Boxes, which are not accounted for in the cur-
rent study because we deliberately attempted to identify a
clinical, dichotomous outcome measure.
Another potential limitation is the drift of Aβ1-42 levels
over time, which might confound results and reduce statisti-
cal power.47-49 We did not include biomarker drift in our

 models because the models are intended for use in future
patients, and we cannot identify how drift will develop in
coming years. Furthermore, the effect of drift on overall prog-
nostic performance is probably low. Finally, both CSF concen-
trations and volumetric MRI measurements vary consider-
ably across different methods. The generalizability of the
models is restricted to the use of identical methods. We vali-
dated our models in ADNI-2 using a z score approach, and we
demonstrated that the prognostic models performed well de-
spite differences in samples and methods.
Conclusions
The prognostic models described in our study could be easily
implementedindailypractice,contributingtopersonalizeddi-
agnostic care and harmonization of clinical practice. In this ar-
ticle, we present a framework for a precision medicine ap-
proach. Worldwide translation of these models remains
challenging and requires particular attention to generalizabil-
ity across samples and measurement methods. Furthermore,
models will further improve when longer-term follow-up
becomes available. Nonetheless, our models show how bio-
marker research can be translated into clinical practice in a
tractable manner.
Our models may aid the clinician in interpreting bio-
marker values and providing individually tailored prognostic
information, and the models also allow the appreciation of the
incremental value of additional testing. After further valida-
tion, we intend these models to serve as input for a web-
based tool (application) to support clinicians in integrating bio-
markers in their daily diagnostic practice.
