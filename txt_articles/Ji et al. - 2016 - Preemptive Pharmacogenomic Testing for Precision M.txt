Significant barriers, such as lack of professional guidelines, specialized training for interpretation
of pharmacogenomics (PGx) data, and insufficient evidence to support clinical utility, prevent
preemptive PGx testing from being widely clinically implemented. The current study, as a pilot
project for the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right TimeeUsing Genomic Data to Individualize Treatment
Protocol, was designed to evaluate the impact of preemptive PGx and to optimize the workflow in
the clinic setting. We used an 84-gene next-generation sequencing panel that included SLCO1B1,
CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and VKORC1 together with a custom-designed CYP2D6 testing cascade to genotype
the 1013 subjects in laboratories approved by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. Actionable
PGx variants were placed in patient’s electronic medical records where integrated clinical decision
support rules alert providers when a relevant medication is ordered. The fraction of this cohort
carrying actionable PGx variant(s) in individual genes ranged from 30% (SLCO1B1) to 79% (CYP2D6).
When considering all five genes together, 99% of the subjects carried an actionable PGx variant(s)
in at least one gene. Our study provides evidence in favor of preemptive PGx testing by identifying
the risk of a variant being present in the population we studied. (J Mol Diagn 2016, 18: 438e445;
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2016.01.003)
The dosing recommendation for a medication is typically
designed and optimized from an average drug response for the
general population during clinical trials. In reality, there is a
large individual variation in response to medications that
varies from lack of efficacy to undesirable or sometimes life-
threatening adverse drug response events (ADEs). Nearly 7
million emergency department visits are related to ADEs per
year nationwide, which the CDC has estimated cost the United
States a total of approximately $3.5 billion annually (Adults
and Older Adult Adverse Drug Events. CDC, http://www.cdc.
gov/MedicationSafety/Adult_AdverseDrugEvents.html, last

 heavy burden for the US health care system with a greatly
increased incidence of ADEs in the aging population. Genetics
is among the factors that contribute to the large interindividual
variation in response to drugs and pharmacogenomics
(PGx)dthe study to identify and define the role of inheritance
in such variable drug response phenotypes.1 The ultimate
clinical goals of PGx are to use genomics to guide therapy,
that is, to avoid ADEs, maximize drug efficacy, and select
responsive patients, all of which, if achieved, will reduce the
burden for both the patients and the health care system.
Evidence is increasing to support the need to implement
clinical PGx testing. Currently, >100 US Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs contain PGx biomarker in-
formation in their drug labels, which includes US Food and
Drug Administration-recommended actions related to the
detection of these biomarkers.2 Despite these recommen-
dations, the pace of clinical PGx implementation has been
slow. Barriers to preemptive PGx genotyping adoption
include the lack of professional clinical guidelines for PGx
phenotyping and reporting, the ability to return results to
electronic medical records (EMRs), and linking clinical
decision support (CDS) tools to assist clinicians in under-
standing, interpreting, and using PGx information.3,4 The
slow adoption of PGx testing also arises from limited
expertise among health care providers because of a lack of
training in clinical pharmacology and clinical molecular
genetics. Therefore, accurate interpretation and reporting of
PGx variants represent challenges for clinical diagnostics
laboratories implementing PGx testing. Finally, preemptive
PGx testing is still subject to ongoing debate on its clinical
validity and clinical utility.
The

Genomic Data to Individualize Treatment (RIGHT) Proto-
col was designed as a proof-of-concept study for clinical
implementation of preemptive PGx testing, including the
use of CDS tools to assist clinicians by providing infor-
mation related to actionable PGx variants at the point of
care.5 Subjects were selected for RIGHT Protocol according
to their likelihood of needing PGx information within a
3-year window, and 1013 patients were preemptively
genotyped
for
CYP2C19,
CYP2C9,
VKORC1,
and
SLCO1B1 with the use of an 84-gene targeted next-generation
sequencing (NGS) panel. The NGS panel makes it possible to
identify novel sequence alterations and to perform future
studies on the clinical utility of the other 80 candidate PGx gene
targets not reported to the EMR during this study. In addition,
because of difficulties in accurately interrogating the highly
homologous CYP2D6 locus on chromosome 22 with the use of
NGS technology, CYP2D6 was genotyped with a custom
genotyping method. These PGx genes have well-established
drugegene
interaction
information
such
as
clopidogrel
(CYP2C19); warfarin (CYP2C9 and VKORC1); simvastatin
(SLCO1B1); and codeine, tramadol, and tamoxifen (CYP2D6).
Clinical NGS and genotyping pipelines have been built and
validated for testing, phenotyping, and reporting for these five
genes, followed by placing actionable PGx variants into the
EMR which trigger CDS rules at the time when a prescription is
entered. In addition to optimizing the clinical PGx pipeline for
practice, the current study may provide evidence to support the
value of preemptive PGx genotyping.
Materials and Methods
Study Subjects
All subjects enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Biobank who were
at increased risk of initiating a statin drug within the next 3
years as predicted by a Cox proportional hazards model were
eligible for the RIGHT Protocol.5 The multivariate predictive
model included patient demographic characteristics (age, sex,
and race/ethnicity) and six Clinical Classification Software
codes, including lipid concentrations, diabetes, peripheral
atherosclerosis, disease of blood-forming organs, coronary
atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other coronary heart dis-
ease, as risk factors. Two thousand Mayo Biobank partici-
pants were identified and invited to participate; 1013
consented and provided a blood sample (Figure 1). The
design and development of the RIGHT Protocol has been
described in detail previously.5 The study was reviewed and
approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.

 Mayo Clinic Department of Laboratory Medicine and
Pathology’s clinical validation standard operating pro-
cedures. The NGS method used the PGRN-Seq capture
reagent5 designed and developed from a joint effort of the
three Deep Sequencing Resources groups (University of
Washington, the Genome Institute at Washington Univer-
sity, and the Human Genome Sequencing at Baylor College
of Medicine) which are part of the nationwide Pharmaco-
genomics Research Network (PGRN; http://www.pgrn.org,
last accessed December 24, 2015). The reagent captured 84
genes associated with PGx phenotypes, covering 968 kb of
sequence that include 2 kb upstream and downstream of the
coding region of these genes. KAPA HTP Library Prepa-
ration Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wilmington, MA) and
Bioo Scientific NEXTflex barcode adapters (Bioo Scientific
Corporation, Austin, TX) were used for library preparation
and precapture pooling, respectively. Genomic DNA sam-
ples of the 1013 RIGHT participants were randomly
assigned to 14 96-well plates. One Coriell DNA sample
(sample ID M04) was included in each pool of 48 samples
as a positive control for comparison across the runs. The
expected genotypes for this control DNA sample were as
followed: CYP2C19 *2/*4, CYP2C9 *1/*2, heterozygous
for VKORC1 C.1639G>A, and homozygous wild-type for
SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (*5). One negative control sample
with no DNA content is set up with each batch of 96 as a
negative control. Two pools of 48 samples from each batch
of 96 samples were loaded into two flow cells and were
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 Sequencing System
in the rapid run mode by using the TruSeq Rapid SBS Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the 200-cycle and 2 � 101
pair-end reads capability. A complete list of the 84 genes
included on the PGRN-Seq capture panel was also reported
previously.5
CYP2D6 was genotyped separately with the use of a
custom-designed testing cascade, beginning with the Lumi-
nex Tag-It Mutation Detection Kit for Cytochrome P450 2D6
(CYP2D6 ASPE Kit v3) (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX)
and when needed, followed by a laboratory-developed copy
number variation assay and/or sequencing assays.6 In addi-
tion, specific regions around the known CYP2C9 and
CYP2C19 alleles (Table 1) were examined in the current
study. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm variants in
CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and VKORC1. A TaqMan Qualitative
Assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to
confirm SLCO1B1 variants. Variants were each confirmed up
to a maximum of 10 times.
The
NGS
bioinformatics
methods
enabled
high-
throughput variant interpretation, including an algorithm
designed for PGx star (*) allele calling and delivery of
clinical actionable variants to the EMR. Briefly, raw
FASTQ sequence reads were generated by CASAVA
(Illumina), aligned to the hg19 human reference sequence
with the use of CLC Bio’s Server software, version 4.1
(CLC Bio, Boston, MA), with single-nucleotide variants,
small
insertions
and
deletions
called
by
CLC’s
Neighborhood Quality calling method. FASTQC was used
to assess raw read quality. All results were loaded into the
Mayo Clinic NGS interpretative environment, the NGS
Workbench, for review of quality metrics and manual
annotation of novel or ambiguous sequence alterations by
laboratory technical staff and directors. The minimum tar-
geted per-base read coverage for each region was 100 with
regions containing <80 reads subject to confirmatory
testing. The target variant frequency was 35% to 65% for
heterozygous variants and >85% for homozygous variants.
Variants with frequencies outside these ranges were subject
to separate confirmatory testing. Consistency of variant calls
between positive control samples that were included in each
batch across all of the 14 sequencing runs was also calcu-
lated. Only variants meeting the NGS bioinformatics pipe-
line quality score cutoff were exported to the Oracle’s
Translational Research Platform database (Oracle, Redwood
City, CA) and linked to the EMR for clinical use.
PGx Phenotype Derivation and Categorization
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, SLCO1B1, VKORC1, and CYP2D6
were approved for this study, for deposition into the EMR.
The genotyping data were used to assign PGx phenotypes
based on current understanding of the roles of these gene
products in drug metabolizing and/or pharmacologic action
and knowledge of the functional consequences of the
identified sequence alterations. Specifically, star allele as-
signments and genotype-to-phenotype correlation (Table 1)
for
variants
identified
in
CYP2C19,
CYP2C9,
and
CYP2D6 were adapted from information available at the

summarized in Table 2.
To calculate the total proportion of RIGHT participants
carrying actionable PGx variants, we considered as
normal (and consequently not actionable) only individuals
with the extensive metabolizer (EM) status, based on our
CYP
phenotyping
algorithms
(Table
2).
Individuals
assigned as ultrarapid metabolizer (UM), intermediate
metabolizer (IM), poor metabolizer (PM), or any other
drug metabolizer status in between (ie, other than EM),
were classified as carrying an actionable PGx variant(s).
Table 2 has also included intermediate phenotype cate-
gories, for example, EM to UM, IM to EM, and PM to IM,
with slight variation in definition among the three CYP
enzymes.
For SLCO1B1, only the well-studied *5 allele (c.521T>C,
p.Val174Ala or rs4149056) was investigated and reported.
Individuals carrying both heterozygous (TC) and homozy-
gous (CC) genotypes are considered to have an actionable
PGx variant in this gene.10 For VKORC1, although the end
point phenotype (ie, warfarin sensitivity) is determined by
combined genotypes with the CYP2C9 *allele, the PGx
actionable variants are determined according to the CPIC
guideline for warfarin dosing.8 Specifically, individuals with
either heterozygous GA or homozygous AA genotypes for
VKORC1 rs9923231 (c.-1639G>A) are categorized as
having an actionable PGx variant.
Delivery of PGx Information with EMR and CDS Rules
All sequence-verified and reportable variants for the five
PGx genes interpreted in this study were transferred into
Soft Biochemistry (SCC Soft Computer, Clearwater, FL)
which links laboratory results to the EMR. CDS rules have
been built for the five PGx genes and alerts are triggered

 when a clinician enters prescription(s) that encounters any
of the actionable PGx variants for the individual patient. The
alert contains recommendations and information for the
ordering clinician to consider possible dose adjustment or to
switch to alternative medication(s). The results can also be
accessed directly by the patients through their Mayo Clinic
online patient services accounts.
Functional and technical specifications of the PGx CDS
rules were developed by a multidisciplinary team that
consisted of clinical experts, clinical pharmacists and phar-
macologists, informaticians, and information technology
analysts. The specifications comprise all of the necessary in-
formation to develop, test, implement, and maintain the CDS
rules, including knowledge translation, workflow analysis,
data mapping, and log specifications. PGx alerts are integrated
in the computerized physician order entry applications for
inpatient and outpatient settings. The alerts are designed to
deliver the necessary information and to facilitate further
actions, including a link to additional related educational
resources. In the design, alert fatigue is considered, and
exclusion criteria are included in the rules to avoid unnec-
essary repetitive alerts. Transactional data associated with the
alerts are collected to assess performance and clinical impact
of the rules.
Results
Study Subjects
The baseline characteristics of the 1013 RIGHT patients
were described in detail previously.5 Briefly, the majority of
the 1013 subjects were non-Hispanic whites (86%) with
slightly higher proportion of women (53%). The prescrip-
tion history for these 1013 subjects showed many subjects
had already been prescribed at least one medication refer-
enced by the US Food and Drug Administration’s list of
PGx Biomarkers in Drug Labeling2 within the past 10 years.
For example, approximately 75% of the RIGHT patients
have had a prescription for tramadol and/or codeine.5
PGx NGS and Genotyping
Preemptive genotyping was completed for all 1013 partici-
pants in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act-approved
and College of American Pathologists-accredited clinical
laboratories at the Mayo Clinic. For the NGS, expected
genotype calls were 100% consistent between the duplicated
positive control samples within runs and across the 14
sequencing batches. More than 96.3% of the samples met
the minimum coverage cutoff quality control criteria. NGS
on 37 samples were repeated from library preparation
because of low sequencing quality (for all genes). One
hundred twenty-four confirmation tests were performed on
81 samples with 54% of the confirmations because of either
poor coverage or variant frequencies out of range in the
regions of interest. The remaining samples (46% of the 81
samples) were subject to confirmation testing to verify
variants observed by NGS.
Phenotyping and Proportion of Patients Carrying PGx
Variant(s)
The percentage of patients in each metabolizer category
among the total 1013 RIGHT subjects for each of the three
CYP genes, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, is summa-
rized in Figure 2, AeC. Note that 21%, 64%, and 40%
of subjects are EM or normal metabolizer status for
CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, respectively, leaving the
remainder of the population predicted to carry altered drug
metabolizer status. The distribution of patients carrying
different genotypes for SLCO1B1*5 and VKORC1 rs9923231
among the RIGHT participants is described in Figure 2D.

 When CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are considered
together for warfarin sensitivity, 37% of the RIGHT partici-
pants were predicted to have altered warfarin sensitivity,
which might require the adjustment of the initial dose of
warfarin.9
The proportion of the RIGHT patients who carry
actionable PGx variant(s) in the five genes studied is sum-
marized in Figure 3. Of the 1013 RIGHT patients, 99%
carry at least one actionable variant. Furthermore, 3% of
participants carry actionable PGx variants in all of the five
genes.
In addition to genomic variants linked to PGx pheno-
types, multiple novel sequence alterations were also
detected. There were a total of seven novel variants
identified in CYP2C9, including six missense variants of
uncertain significance (VUSs) and one frame shift muta-
tion. The frame shift resulted from one base pair deletion
that may cause a truncated CYP2C9 protein due to a
subsequent early stop codon. There were nine VUSs
detected in CYP2C19 of which seven were missense
alterations and two were intronic alterations adjacent to
the canonical splicing sites. VUS information was not
available for SLCO1B1 and VKORC1 because sequence
analysis for these two genes was targeted to a single
variant position.
Six specific PGx CDS rules (drugegene interaction)
were
developed
and
implemented
in
clinical
practice:
codeineeCYP2D6, tramadoleCYP2D6, tamoxifeneCYP2D6,
simvastatineSLCO1B1,
clopidogreleCYP2C19,
and
warfarineCYP2C9/VKORC1. The alerts were designed to
display specific recommendations for each drugegene
interaction. The alerts can display multiple interactions,
including one gene with several drugs or several genes
with several drugs. Hypothetical examples are shown for
one drug-one gene (Figure 4A), two drugs-one gene
(Figure 4B), and two genes-three drugs (Figure 4C).
Specific PGx-CDS recommendations for each of the PGx
variants tested in this study are summarized in Table 3.
Discussion
The field of PGx has been established for more than half a
century and has described several variations in individual
genetic makeup that cause a change in drug response
phenotypes.11 The ultimate clinical goal of PGx testing is to
optimize treatment and to eliminate ADEs by treating the
patient with the right drug, the right dose, at the right
time. Considering the potential medical and financial ben-
efits, preemptive PGx genotyping represents a promising
component of precision medicine in the postgenomic era.
Despite barriers that affect the pace of PGx clinical
implementation,
significant
progress
has
been
made.

 challenges of clinical implementation through the PGRN-
Translational Pharmacogenomics Program4 and developing
drugegene specific guidelines for PGx clinical imple-
mentation through the PGRN CPIC working groups and
PharmGKB.8,9 Currently, most PGx tests are ordered when
a prescription is placed by a clinician (or even after the
patient has been on the drug for several days) and are rarely
performed preemptively. In some cases, the clinician may
need to delay initiation of therapy until PGx results are
returned or may go ahead and place the patient on the
therapy in the absence of PGx results, which may lead to
ADEs. The lack of data from large prospective clinical trials
is partially responsible for the hesitance of clinical labora-
tories to implement preemptive PGx testing. The complexity
of
PGx
interpretation
and
reporting,
the
clinician’s
engagement, and reimbursement policies from payers are
also concerns.
At Mayo Clinic, an integrated local network, the PGx
Task Force, consisting of leaders of the Mayo Clinic PGRN,
the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine, the
Mayo Clinic Biobank, and the Personalized Genomics
Laboratory was formed to initiate a preemptive PGx
sequencing/genotyping project. We observed that among
the 1013 RIGHT subjects tested for five well-characterized
PGx genes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, SLCO1B1, CYP2C9, and
VKORC1), only 1% of subjects (10/1013) did not carry an
actionable PGx variant. In other words, these 10 subjects
were phenotyped as normal or EM for the three CYP genes
and wild-type for the SLCO1B1*5 and VKORC1 rs9923231
variants (Figure 2). However, approximately 99% of
RIGHT participants carry an actionable PGx variant(s) in at
least one of the five studied genes. Although not all of the
variants detected in these five genes would result in an
ADE-related emergency department visit and there might be
other PGx variants that exist but are outside the scope of the
current study, our study provided additional evidence to
support the need of preemptive PGx genotyping. Another
preemptive PGx genotyping study performed by the Van-
derbilt University also examined five currently implemented
drugegene interactions (clopidogreleCYP2C19, simvastatine
SLCO1B1, warfarineCYP2C9/VKORC1, thiopurineseTMPT,
and tacrolimuseCYP3A5) and similarly showed the percent-
age of the study population carrying one or more actionable
variants was 91%.12 The slight discrepancy between the
numbers from the two preemptive PGx studies might have
been due to the difference in the prevalence of actionable
variants in CYP2D6 for our study, that is, approximately 79%
of subjects carrying CYP2D6 variants, and less variable PGx
genes (7% actionable variant carriers in TMPT and 24% for
CYP3A5*1) included in the Vanderbilt study.
Although the PGRN-seq NGS panel was designed to
capture the coding regions and a 2-kb sequence upstream
and downstream of 84 PGx genes, subject phenotyping
was only based on the genotypes of five genes with

 well-established PGx associations. As a result, one limita-
tion of the current study is the possible overestimated
prevalence of EM individuals predicted to have normal
enzyme activity due to the lack of sequence information in
other gene regions not captured and genes not analyzed on
the NGS panel. Nevertheless, the use of NGS deep
sequencing has made it possible for us to expand the mu-
tation detection spectrum and to discover novel and rare
sequence alterations.
Functional genomics studies are currently in progress to
characterize the effect of VUSs identified in this study. The
discovery-enabled capability of NGS-based PGx testing
highlights one advantage over traditional single nucleotide
polymorphism-based genotyping methods. As whole exome
and whole genome sequencing, both of which are offered
clinically, become more routine, further discovery of PGx
actionable variants is likely. However, this increased discovery
will come with new challenges associated with the inter-
pretations of these novel variants identified in PGx genes.
In summary, we have demonstrated that 99% of this study
population carries at least one actionable PGx variant,
suggesting a high prevalence of actionable variants in the
general population. Given this, preemptive PGx genotyping
may benefit most individuals, with particular value in
individuals taking multiple medications. As these study
subjects are followed prospectively, additional data to define
the utility of preemptive PGx testing will be gathered, as we
track the number of CDS alerts triggered.
