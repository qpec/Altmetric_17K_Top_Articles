ABSTRACT
The differential diagnosis between pleural malignant mesothelioma (MM) 
and lung cancer is often challenging. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains used to 
distinguish these malignancies include markers that are most often positive in MM and 
less frequently positive in carcinomas, and vice versa. However, in about 10–20% of 
the cases, the IHC results can be confusing and inconclusive, and novel markers are 
sought to increase the diagnostic accuracy.
We stained 45 non-small cell lung cancer samples (32 adenocarcinomas and 13 
squamous cell carcinomas) with a monoclonal antibody for BRCA1-associated protein 
1 (BAP1) and also with an IHC panel we routinely use to help differentiate MM from 
carcinomas, which include, calretinin, Wilms Tumor 1, cytokeratin 5, podoplanin D2-
40, pankeratin CAM5.2, thyroid transcription factor 1, Napsin-A, and p63. Nuclear 
BAP1 expression was also analyzed in 35 MM biopsies. All 45 non-small cell lung 
cancer biopsies stained positive for nuclear BAP1, whereas 22/35 (63%) MM biopsies 
lacked nuclear BAP1 staining, consistent with previous data. Lack of BAP1 nuclear 
staining was associated with MM (two-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test, P = 5.4 x 10-11). 
Focal BAP1 staining was observed in a subset of samples, suggesting polyclonality. 
Diagnostic accuracy of other classical IHC markers was in agreement with previous 
studies. Our study indicated that absence of nuclear BAP1 stain helps differentiate 
MM from lung carcinomas. We suggest that BAP1 staining should be added to the IHC 
panel that is currently used to distinguish these malignancies.
INTRODUCTION
The incidence of malignant mesothelioma (MM) 
has increased exponentially in the US since the early ‘60s, 
reaching 3,200 cases per year at the beginning of this 
century, and has remained stable since then [1]. Similarly, 
the incidence of lung cancer has increased exponentially 
during the past century, with currently over 200,000 
cases of lung cancer diagnosed per year in the US [2]. 
Comparable trends have been observed since World War 
II in most countries, as a consequence of the increased 
use of asbestos, the most common cause of MM, and 
of cigarette smoking, the most common cause of lung 
cancer [3]. Moreover, asbestos and smoking synergize in 
causing lung cancer, and co-factors may increase asbestos 
carcinogenicity and MM [4-6]. Also, exposure to asbestos 
and other carcinogenic fibers present in the environment 
can cause MM and probably lung cancer [7-9].
MM and lung cancer patients are treated differently 
and have different prognosis, thus it is very important to 
properly diagnose these malignancies. This differential 
diagnosis is difficult, because MMs, in particular the 
epithelial subtype –which comprises about 70% of all 
MMs– can show a morphology similar to that of non-
small cell lung carcinomas, and lung carcinosarcomas 
and spindle cell carcinomas can have a morphology 
similar to biphasic and sarcomatoid MMs. A set of 
immunohistochemical (IHC) stains helps distinguish these 
malignancies [10, 11]: more than 80% of epithelial MMs 
show nuclear stain for Wilms tumor protein (WT1) and 
                   Research Paper

calretinin, and show membranous stain for cytokeratin 
5 (CK5). Lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) stain 
positive for CK5, and also for p63 (nuclear), and p40 
(nuclear), the latter two markers are negative in MMs. 
Moreover, about 40% of SCC can also be positive for 
calretinin and show membranous stain for podoplanin 
(D2-40). Lung adenocarcinomas are instead positive 
for nuclear thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and 
Napsin-A and for other cytoplasmic epithelial markers, 
such as the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the 
Epithelial Related Antigen (MOC31), EpCam (BEREP4), 
etc., and rarely for calretinin and podoplanin (D2-40). 
Pankeratin CAM5.2 stains the membranes and the 
cytoplasm of the cells in both MMs and lung carcinomas.
When the results of the IHC stains fit the 
expectations, the diagnosis is usually straightforward. In 
about 10–20% of the cases, however, these malignancies 
can produce conflicting IHC results, with both MM and 
lung carcinoma markers being either positive or negative 
in the same tumor, or showing only a fraction of tumor 
cells being positive. Accordingly, there are still a large 
number of MMs that are misdiagnosed. In a large follow-
up study that covered 25% of the French population, 
Goldberg et al. reported that the initial diagnosis of MM 
was confirmed only in 67% of cases [12]. Most recently, 
a review of Chinese MM confirmed the initial diagnosis, 
which was made with the support of a panel of IHC stains, 
in only 56% of cases [9]. In our experience, 10% or more 
of MMs, in the US, are misdiagnosed: these cases are often 
from hospitals and pathologists that rarely see patients 
with these types of tumors. Thus, too many patients 
worldwide continue to be misdiagnosed and consequently 
do not receive proper treatment for their malignancy.
Following studies of an epidemic of MM in 
Cappadocia that we linked to gene-environment interaction 
[13, 14], we discovered that germline truncating mutations 
in the BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene caused a 
very high incidence of MM, in some families in the US and 
abroad, in the absence of occupational exposure to asbestos 
[15, 16]. Moreover, using a BAP1+/- mouse model, we 
demonstrated that mice, carrying germline BAP1 mutations, 
develop MM following exposure to very low doses of 
asbestos that rarely caused MM in wild-type mice [17]. 
Our data, confirmed and expanded by others, showed that 
germline BAP1 mutations are also associated with uveal 
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and other malignancies, 
causing a condition that we named “BAP1 cancer syndrome” 
[18]. BAP1 is a member of the ubiquitin C-terminal 
hydrolase subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes and is 
found associated with multi-protein complexes that regulate 
cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, gluconeogenesis, and 
the DNA damage response [18, 19].
Somatic BAP1 mutations were also detected in 
sporadic (i.e., non familiar) MM [15, 20-22]. Using 
multidimensional genetic analyses, and IHC we 
demonstrated BAP1 inactivation in >60% of sporadic 
MMs [23], making BAP1 the most commonly mutated 
gene in MM, a finding confirmed by others [24-26]. These 
findings underscore the pivotal role of BAP1 in MM. 
Recently, several studies reported that lack of nuclear 
BAP1 immunostaining helps differentiating benign 
reactive pleural effusion and pleurisy, which are BAP1 
positive, from MMs, which are frequently BAP1 negative 
[27-30]. Other malignancies instead express normal levels 
of BAP1: for example BAP1 is expressed and detected 
by IHC in most pancreatic carcinomas [31], and in most 
peritoneal and gynecologic serous adenocarcinomas [32]. 
In 2012, Fan et al. detected BAP1 by Western blot studies 
in 103 non-small cell lung cancers, and correlated high 
expression with a good prognosis [33].
Here, we tested the hypothesis that BAP1 
immunostain might help improve the accuracy of the 
differential diagnosis between MM, which often shows 
no BAP1 nuclear staining, and lung cancer, which we 
predicted to be BAP1 positive.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
All 45 non-small cell lung cancer samples analyzed 
–32 adenocarcinomas and 13 SCC– stained positive for 
nuclear BAP1 (Table 1, Figure 1). Strong nuclear staining 
was detected in ~100% of the tumor cells in all these tumors, 
except for 2 adenocarcinomas, in which some tumor areas 
contained cells showing BAP1 nuclear staining and some 
areas contained tumor nodules that were BAP1 negative. 
These cases are possibly due to presence of tumor sub-
clones that had lost BAP1 expression, underscoring the 
risk of possible sample error if only minute needle biopsies, 
or tumor-arrays (slides with multiple minute fragments of 
different tumors) were to be examined [34].
In parallel, we stained 35 new MM samples for 
BAP1. Overall, BAP1 expression was entirely lost in 
22/35 (63%) of all MM samples. (Table 1, Figure 2). 
Focal BAP1 staining, suggestive of polyclonality [35], 
was observed in 6/20 (30%) of epithelial MMs and 3/8 
(37%) of biphasic MMs. These results are consistent with 
our previous study in which, using integrated genetic 
approaches, coupled with IHC, we found that 66% of 92 
MM studied displayed a lack of nuclear BAP1 staining 
[23]. A re-analysis of these cases revealed that, among the 
60/92 MMs that were of the epithelial-type, only 14 (23%) 
were BAP1 positive and 1 additional MM showed focal 
nuclear positivity. Among the 32/92 non-epithelial MMs 
(i.e., biphasic and sarcomatoid), 11 (30%) were BAP1 
positive, and 5 (15%) showed focal positivity.
In addition, we compared a panel of “classical” IHC 
stains used to distinguish MM and lung cancer in these 
45 non-small cell lung cancer samples and in 10 MM 
samples (Table 2). MM cells were mostly positive for 
WT1 (nuclear), calretinin (nuclear and cytoplasmic), D2-
40, CK5, and CAM5.2, and the same cells were negative 
for TTF-1, p63, and Napsin-A. Lung adenocarcinoma

cells were always positive for TTF-1, Napsin-A, and 
CAM5.2; and negative for nuclear WT1 and D2-40 and 
6% of them stained for calretinin (nuclear and cytoplasmic 
focal staining). Tumor cells in SCC were almost uniformly 
positive for CK5, CAM5.2 and p63, and negative for 
WT1, TTF-1 and Napsin-A; Calretinin and D2-40 were 
focally positive respectively in 23% and 77% of them 
(Table 2, Figures 1-2). These findings are in agreement 
with previous studies [10, 11] indicating that WT1 nuclear 
positivity is the most specific positive marker for MM, 
while TTF-1 and Napsin-A are most specific for lung 
adenocarcinoma, and p63 and p40 are specific markers 
for lung SCC. We found that calretinin, a marker often 
used in support of the diagnosis of MM, is certainly a 
very sensitive MM marker, but because it stains also a 
large proportion of SCC and some adenocarcinomas it is 
insufficient, per se, to establish the diagnosis. It has been 
our experience that, at times, misdiagnoses of MM were 
based on an incomplete, limited, set of IHC stains showing 
positivity for calretinin. The more specific marker WT-1 
stains about 80% of the epitelioid MM, and about 50% of 
sarcomatoid MMs. We found that D2-40 stains MM but

also lung carcinomas and therefore, although sensitivity is 
high, as most MMs stain for D2-40, the specificity is low.
In summary, we found that lack of BAP1 nuclear 
staining was preferentially associated with MM (two-
tailed Fisher’s Exact Test, P = 5.4 x 10-11) and that instead 
lack of nuclear staining is not found in lung carcinomas, 
or at least is quite rare, since in our study 45/45 lung 
cancers stained for nuclear BAP1. In support of our 
findings, genomic data from the TCGA collaboration on 
lung cancer showed that mutations of BAP1 are extremely 
rare in non-small cell lung cancer: frame-shift mutations 
and deletions that would result in loss of BAP1 nuclear 
staining were present in less than 1% of more than 400 
lung adenocarcinomas [36-38] and 178 SCC studied [39]. 
Moreover, this June 2016, after our paper was submitted 
for publication, Andrici J et al., reported that out of 155 
lung adenocarcinomas and 72 lung SCC, only one had lost 
BAP1 expression [40]. These Authors, quoting previous 
literature, noted: “this finding increases the specificity 
of loss of expression for BAP1 for the diagnosis of 
mesothelioma” [40]. Although the paper by Andrici et 
al. did not include a parallel analysis of MM biopsies, 
their IHC results independently support our findings and 
conclusions. Together, these findings, justify including 
BAP1 in the panel of antibodies used to differentiate lung 
cancer from MM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All investigations described in this study have been 
performed in accordance with the principles embodied in 
the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was 
received from all patients. Collection and use of patient 
information and samples were approved by the IRB of 
the University of Hawaii (IRB no. 14406). We studied 
32 primary lung adenocarcinomas, 13 primary lung SCC 
and 10 MM biopsies, which were diagnosed at the Queens 
Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii. We also analysed 25 
MM biopsies from the New York University New York, 
New York, (all calretinin and WT1 positive and negative 
for epithelial markers) for a total of 35 MM biopsies. Of 
these, 20 were of the epithelial type, 8 were biphasic and 
7 were sarcomatoid.
IHC was performed on formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded tissue sections, using the avidin-biotin-
peroxidase complex method in a DAKO-autostainer 
(Carpinteria, CA, USA). The primary antibodies used 
in this study were: BAP1 (Clone C-4, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology); p63 (clone 4A4, Biocare); Napsin A 
(clone BC15, Biocare); TTF1 (clone SPT24, Leica); 
CK5 (clone XM26, Leica); WT1 (clone WT49, Leica); 
Calretinin (clone CAL6, Leica); D2-40, clone D2-40, 
DAKO); Cam5.2 (clone Cam 5.2, BD Biosciences).
All diagnoses were made on hematoxylin-eosin 
stained sections combined with immunohistochemical and 
clinical features. Expert pathologists in pleural pathology, 
independently evaluated the biopsies (M.C., D.S and 
H.I.P.).
IHC of BAP1 protein expression was performed as 
described [15, 23, 41], using a mouse monoclonal anti-
BAP1antibody (C-4: Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX). 
This antibody recognizes the epitope between a.a. 430 
and 739; therefore, it detects BAP1 wild-type and mutant 
forms that retain the nuclear localization signal (NLS).
