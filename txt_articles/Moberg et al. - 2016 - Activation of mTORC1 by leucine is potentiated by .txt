strand E. Activation of mTORC1 by leucine is potentiated by branched-
chain amino acids and even more so by essential amino acids following
resistance exercise. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 310: C874–C884, 2016. First
published April 6, 2016; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00374.2015.—Protein synthe-
sis is stimulated by resistance exercise and intake of amino acids, in
particular leucine. Moreover, activation of mammalian target of rapa-
mycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling by leucine is potentiated by
the presence of other essential amino acids (EAA). However, the
contribution of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to this effect
is yet unknown. Here we compare the stimulatory role of leucine,
BCAA, and EAA ingestion on anabolic signaling following exercise.
Accordingly, eight trained volunteers completed four sessions of
resistance exercise during which they ingested either placebo, leucine,
BCAA, or EAA (including the BCAA) in random order. Muscle
biopsies were taken at rest, immediately after exercise, and following
90 and 180 min of recovery. Following 90 min of recovery the activity
of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) was greater than at rest in all four trials
(Placebo�Leucine�BCAA�EAA; P � 0.05 time � supplement),
with a ninefold increase in the EAA trial. At this same time point,
phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-
binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) at Thr37/46 was unaffected by supplemen-
tation, while that of Thr46 alone exhibited a pattern similar to that of
S6K1, being 18% higher with EAA than BCAA. However, after 180
min of recovery this difference between EAA and BCAA had disap-
peared, although with both these supplements the increases were still
higher than with leucine (40%, P � 0.05) and placebo (100%, P �
0.05). In summary, EAA ingestion appears to stimulate translation
initiation more effectively than the other supplements, although the
results also suggest that this effect is primarily attributable to the
BCAA.
4E-BP1; S6K1; BCAA; skeletal muscle
TO GAIN SKELETAL MUSCLE MASS, the rate of muscle protein
synthesis must exceed the rate of breakdown. Protein synthesis
can be stimulated by resistance exercise in combination with
amino acids, and both factors mediate this effect by activation
of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
signaling pathway (35). The activation of mTORC1 leads to
phosphorylation of well-characterized downstream targets and
subsequent enhancement of the capacity for mRNA translation
(13). If mTORC1 signaling is inhibited in vivo by rapamycin,
stimulation of protein synthesis by amino acids in both animal
(2, 47) and human skeletal muscle (18) is attenuated, highlight-
ing the important role of mTORC1 in this context.
The current view is that stimulation of protein synthesis by
a mixture of amino acids is due to the essential amino acids
(EAA) present (12, 48), primarily leucine (38). To date, several
lines of evidence indicate that leucine alone can potently
stimulate mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis in vivo,
both in animal (16, 19) and human skeletal muscle (28, 45, 51).
Although leucine does have distinctive anabolic properties,
there are data to suggest that, by itself, this amino acid cannot
account for the entire anabolic stimulus by a mixture of amino
acids. For example, we have recently shown that, in connection
with resistance exercise, intake of EAA stimulates the activity
of 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in human
skeletal muscle to a greater extent than leucine alone (4).
Early findings on isolated cells indicate that the stimulation
of S6K1 by a complete mixture of amino acids is mediated
largely by the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in the
mixture (41). Moreover, oral supplementation with the three
BCAA potently stimulates mTORC1 signaling in human skel-
etal muscle following resistance exercise (3, 34). In addition,
isoleucine alone enhances the phosphorylation of both S6K1
and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-
binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in rat skeletal muscle (2), with the
former effect shown to involve sensing of isoleucine by leucyl-
tRNA synthetase (30). Despite these observations, overall
experimental support for the individual potency of isoleucine
and valine in this context is limited, and it therefore seems
plausible that these amino acids act synergistically with leu-
cine. Preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that oral
ingestion of BCAA results in more pronounced activation of
mTORC1 by resistance exercise than leucine alone.
Accordingly, our objective here was to determine whether a
mixture of BCAA stimulates mTORC1 signaling and protein
synthesis to a greater extent than leucine alone. To this end,
protein phosphorylation of components in the mTORC1 path-
way, S6K1 kinase activity, the interaction between 4E-BP1 and
eIF4E, and muscle protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR) were
examined in trained subjects supplied with either EAA, the
three BCAA, or leucine alone in connection with resistance
exercise. Our hypothesis was that the BCAA and EAA would

METHODS
Subjects. Eight healthy male volunteers participated in the study.
To meet the set criteria for enrollment, they had a resistance training
experience of at least a year and they were able to lift at least four
times their body weight in leg press. The subjects’ characteristics were
as follows; the mean (�SE) age 27 � 2 yr, body weight 84 � 3 kg,
height 181 � 3 cm, and maximal leg strength 430 � 13 kg. After
being fully informed of the purpose of the study and associated risks,
all subjects provided written consent to participate. The study protocol
was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm
and performed in accordance with the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Pretests. Prior to initiation of the experimental protocol, each
subject participated in four preliminary test sessions. On the first
occasion, each subject performed a bilateral one-repetition maximum
(1RM) test in the leg press machine (243 Leg Press 45°, Gymleco,
Stockholm, Sweden). Thus, following warmup with leg presses at low
load, the 1RM was assessed by gradually increasing the load until the
subject could no longer perform a single repetition (90–180° knee
angle). All attempts were separated by at least 5 min of rest. To
minimize training effects during the actual experiments, the subse-
quent three pretests involved familiarization in the form of perfor-
mance of the entire protocol by each subject (see below). These
pretests were scheduled 1 wk apart with the final test being performed
7–10 days prior to the first trial.
Experimental trials. The subjects were instructed to refrain from
any type of vigorous physical activity for 2 days prior to each trial and
to document their food intake for the 2 days prior to the first trial and
then repeated that same intake prior to each of the remaining trials. On
trial days, subjects reported to the laboratory at 06:00 AM after fasting
since 09:00 PM the evening before. Upon arrival, subjects were
instructed to take a supine position and had a 17G Teflon catheter
inserted into the antecubital vein of each arm, one to be used for
repeated blood sampling and the other for infusion of the stable
isotope. After a baseline blood sample was collected, a primed
constant infusion of L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine (prime 2 �mol/kg;
0.05 �mol·kg�1·min�1, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Danvers,
MA) was initiated and continued thereafter for the duration of the
experiment (�6 h). The subjects then rested for 2 h under isotope
infusion to enable tracer equilibration and quantification of muscle
protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR) at rest based on baseline
enrichment of plasma protein (33) and a single biopsy. After 2 h an
initial baseline biopsy was taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of
one leg with a Weil-Blakesley conchotome (AB Wisex, Mölndal,
Sweden) under local anesthesia (32). In addition, during these initial
2 h of rest and tracer infusion, a blood sample was collected into
EDTA-tubes once every 30 min.
After completion of this baseline sampling, the subjects were
seated in the leg press machine and started the exercise protocol. The
first three warmup sets consisted of 10 repetitions at 0, 30, and 60%
of their individual 1RM. Thereafter, the subjects performed 10 sets of
heavy resistance exercise to fatigue, starting at 85% of their 1RM and
gradually reducing the load so that they could perform at least 8, but
no more than 12 repetitions to fatigue. All sets were separated by 3
min of rest while seated in the leg press. The first trial set the criteria
for the following trials so that the subjects would perform the same
individual number of repetitions and workload with matching time
under tension during resistance exercise in the subsequent trials.
Immediately following completion of the final set, subjects re-
turned to a supine position and a second muscle biopsy was taken,
with additional biopsies following 90 and 180 min of recovery. The
biopsies were taken from alternating legs (i.e., 1st; right, 2nd; left, 3rd;
right, 4th; left) all from a new incision �2 cm proximal to the
previous one. In the subsequent trial the leg for the initial biopsy was
alternated and the biopsies were all collected 2 cm medial to the
previous ones. In the third and fourth trials, the biopsies were
collected in the same manner but 2 cm proximal to the previous ones.
These tissue samples were immediately blotted free of blood and
frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at �80°C until analysis. Blood
samples were collected immediately prior to and after the warmup sets
and after completion of the fourth, seventh, and tenth sets, as well as
15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after completion of exercise and
maintained on ice for 1 min. Following centrifugation at 10,000 g for
3 min, the plasma obtained was transferred to new Eppendorf tubes
and placed in liquid nitrogen for storage at �80°C until analysis.
In a double-blind and counterbalanced order, each subject con-
sumed one of four drinks containing flavored water (Placebo), leucine
alone (Leucine), all three branch-chained amino acids (BCAA), or
essential amino acids including the BCAA (EAA) during each trial.
The EAA supplementation (290 mg/kg) consisted of eight essential
amino acids (Ajinomoto, Kanagawa, Japan); 13.6% L-histidine, 9.5%
L-isoleucine, 17.1% L-leucine, 17.8% L-lysine, 2.9% L-methionine,
14.3% L-phenylalanine, 13.6% L-threonine, and 11.4% L-valine. The
BCAA supplement (110 mg/kg) contained 25% L-isoleucine, 45%
L-leucine, and 30% L-valine. Leucine alone was given at a dose of 50
mg/kg, so that the amount of leucine in all of the amino acid
supplements was identical. In addition to amino acids, all drinks
contained salts and artificial sweetener and were lemon-flavored.
These drinks (150 ml each) were consumed immediately before and
after the warmup sets and following the fourth and eighth sets and
after 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min of recovery, giving a total volume
of 1.35 liters. A schematic overview of the experimental protocol is
presented in Fig. 1.

 homogenous sample free of contaminating tissue. Subsequent analy-
ses were performed on aliquots of this sample preparation.
Plasma analysis. The plasma level of glucose was determined with
a Biosen C Line (EKF Diagnostics, Cardiff, UK) and lactate was
assayed spectrophotometrically as described by Bergmeyer (7).
Plasma insulin levels were measured using an ELISA kit (Mercodia,
Uppsala, Sweden) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Muscle levels of glycogen and free amino acids. The content of
muscle glycogen was determined in 2 mg of lyophilized muscle
according to the procedure of Leighton and coworkers (37). Levels of
free amino acids in the muscle samples were determined using
LC-MS/MS as described by Bornø and van Hall (11).
Homogenization of muscle tissue. To assess protein signaling,
enzyme activities, protein-protein interactions and myofibrillar protein
FSR muscle samples (�10 mg) were homogenized in ice-cold buffer
(100 �l/mg dry wt) consisting of 2 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM
EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM �-glycerophosphate,
1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1% phospha-
tase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P-2850) and 1% (vol/vol) Halt Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) utilizing a Bul-
letBlender (NextAdvance, Averill Park, NY) with 0.5 mm ZrO beads.
The homogenates obtained were rotated for 30 min at 4°C and
subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting
supernatant was collected for immunoblotting and immunoprecipita-
tion and the pellet was further processed for myofibrillar protein
isotope enrichment (see below). The protein concentration in an
aliquot of the supernatant (diluted 1:10 in distilled water) was deter-
mined using the Pierce 660 nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific), and
the remaining supernatant was stored at �80°C until further analysis.
Immunoblotting. Muscle homogenates were diluted with 4 �
Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and homogenizing
buffer to obtain a final protein concentration of 1.33 �g/�l. The
diluted samples were then heated at 95°C for 5 min to denature the
proteins present and samples were then stored at �20°C until being
subjected to SDS-PAGE. For this purpose, 20 �g of protein from each
sample was loaded onto 26-well Criterion TGX gradient gels (4–20%
acrylamide; Bio-Rad) and electrophoresis was performed at 300V for
30 min on ice. Next, the gel was equilibrated in transfer buffer (25
mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, and 10% methanol) for 30 min at 4°C
after which proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride mem-
branes (Bio-Rad) at a constant current of 300 mA for 3 h at 4°C. To
confirm equal loading and transfer, the membranes were stained with
MemCode Reversible Protein Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific) (1). For
each target protein, all samples from each subject were loaded onto
the same gel and all gels were run simultaneously.
After destaining, the membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris base, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 5%
nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the mem-
branes were incubated overnight with commercially available primary
antibodies diluted in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 con-
taining 2.5% nonfat dry milk (TBS-TM). Following primary antibody
incubation, membranes were washed with TBS-TM and incubated
with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for
1 h at room temperature. Next, the membranes were washed with
TBS-TM (2 � 1 min, 3 � 10 min) and then subjected to four
additional 5-min washes with TBS. Finally, the target proteins were
visualized by applying Super Signal West Femto Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Scientific) to the membranes, followed by detec-
tion on a Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system and quantification
of the resulting bands with the contour tool in the Quantity One
software (version 4.6.3; Bio-Rad). Prior to blocking, the membranes
originating from each gel were cut into strips containing each target
protein and then assembled so that membranes for the entire sample
set were exposed to the same blotting conditions. Following visual-
ization, the membranes were stripped of the phosphospecific antibod-
ies utilizing Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scien-
tific) for 30 min at 37°C and thereafter washed and reprobed with
primary antibodies that detected the total amount of each protein, as
described above. In the case of Akt and 4E-BP1, total protein had to
be analyzed on separate blots. The levels of all phosphoproteins were
normalized to the total level of the corresponding protein.
Immunoprecipitation. To measure the kinase activity of S6K1 and
the interaction between 4E-BP1 and eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E), S6K1 and 4E-BP1 were first immunoprecipitated (IP) from
muscle homogenates containing 500 and 350 �g of protein, respec-
tively. For this purpose, the homogenates were incubated with either
5 �g rabbit anti-S6K1 antibody or 4 �g mouse anti-eIF4E antibody
and an additional 500 �l of homogenization buffer (see above). The
resulting protein-antibody complex was incubated overnight with 10
�l protein-G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) or
15 �l protein-G magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific), respectively, at
4°C on a rotating platform.
Following this incubation, the beads with the immune-complexes
were either spun down or trapped using a magnetic rack and washed
twice in a high-salt (0.5 M NaCl) variant of the homogenization
buffer. In the case of S6K1, the beads were subjected to a final wash
in kinase-specific assay buffer prior to the assay (see below). The
magnetic beads to which eIF4E was bound were suspended in 100 �l
1 � Laemmli sample buffer with 100 �M DTT and heated for 10 min
at 70°C and then immunoblotted for eIF4E and 4E-BP1 as described
above.
Kinase assay. After the wash in kinase-specific assay buffer (50
mM Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 0.03% BrijL23, 0.1% �-mercaptoethanol), the
beads from each sample were suspended in 60 �l of this buffer and
then divided into three 20-�l aliquots. Kinase-specific substrate was
added to two of these and the third served as a blank without substrate.
The assays were initiated by addition of 30 �l radiolabeled kinase-
specific reaction mix once every 20 s and terminated at 20-s intervals
by addition of 50 �l phosphoric acid (1% vol/vol) to each assay. The
final reaction mix (50 �l) contained 100 �M ATP, 10 mM MgCl2,
32�-ATP (specific activity: � 2.6 � 106 cpm/nmol) and 30 �M
synthetic S6K1 substrate (KRRRLASLR) and incubation was carried
out for 60 min at 30°C. After termination, the reaction mixtures were
spotted onto squares of p81 Whatman filter paper (GE Healthcare),
washed four times in phosphoric acid and once in acetone, allowed to
dry, and finally immersed in scintillation fluid (FilterSafe, Zinsser
Analytic, Frankfurt, Germany) and counted on a liquid scintillation
counter (Beckman Coulter, Bromma, Sweden). The average values
from the duplicate assays with substrate were corrected for back-
ground by subtraction of the blank (no substrate) and the values thus
obtained expressed in pmol·min-1·mg-1.
Antibodies. For immunoblotting, primary antibodies against Akt
(Ser473, no. 9271), mTOR (Ser2448, no. 2971; total, no. 2983), S6K1
(Thr389, no. 9234; total no. 2708), 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46, no. 2855; Ser65,
no. 9451; total, no. 9644) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)
(Thr56, no. 2331; total, no. 2332), were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Antibodies recognizing 4E-BP1
Thr46 (no. sc-18090R) and total Akt (no. sc-1619) were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany).
All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 prior to use, except for
antibodies against phospho-eEF2, total-4E-BP1, and 4E-BP1 Thr46,
which were diluted 1:2,000, 1:2,000, and 1:200, respectively. Second-
ary anti-rabbit (no. 7074) antibody (1:10,000) was purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology and secondary anti-goat (no. ab7132;
1:10,000) antibody was purchased from Abcam.
For immunoprecipitation, antibodies against S6K1 (no. sc-230) and
eIF4E (no. sc-271480) were purchased from Santa Cruz.
4EBP1 antibody validation. Evaluation of antibody specificity for
phospho-4EBP1 (Thr46; no. sc-18090R) was performed using block-
ing peptides for the Thr37 (no. sc-18080P) and Thr46 residues (no.
sc-18090P) purchased from Santa Cruz. Each blocking peptide was
combined with equal amounts of antibody and incubated overnight
prior to dilution (1:1,000) in TBS-TM. The combined antibody and
peptide solutions were then incubated with immunoblotted samples as

 described above, and compared with an antibody solution (1:1,000)
without peptides.
Incubation of the Thr46 antibody with the Thr46 peptide blocked the
signal by close to 100% compared with antibody with no peptide.
When incubated with the Thr37 peptide, the signal was blocked by
�40%. Thus, the specificity of the Thr46 antibody was determined to
be �60%.
Stable isotope enrichment. Enrichment of L-[ring-13C6]-phenylala-
nine was analyzed in both mixed muscle tissue and in the myofibrillar
protein pool. The protein pellet obtained from extraction of the 10 mg of
lyophilized muscle (see above) was washed once with 500 �l purified H2O,
dissolved in 1 ml homogenization buffer (see above), and then centrifuged at
1,600 g for 20 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the
pellet containing myofibrillar protein was lyophilized and stored at �80°C
until further analysis. Immunoblotting confirmed that this pellet contained
�97% myofibrillar proteins (myosin/actin), �1% sarcoplasmic proteins
(GAPDH), and �2% mitochondrial proteins (COX). To determine enrich-
ment in mixed muscle protein, 5 mg dry muscle tissue was used.
The mixed muscle and the dried myofibrillar pellet were each
combined with 100 �l of an internal standard (L-[ring-13C9]-phenyl-
alanine, 5 �mol/l) and 100 �l of a standard solution of all amino acids
after which the samples were pelleted and extracted twice with 500 �l
2% perchloric acid. To determine intracellular enrichment of free
phenylalanine, the two extracts from the mixed muscle samples were
combined and analyzed further using LC-MS/MS as described by
Bornø and van Hall (11). The remaining pellet was washed twice with
70% ethanol, hydrolyzed overnight in 1 ml 6 M HCl at 110°C,
dissolved in 500 �l of acetic acid (50%), and then passed through a
cation exchange column. To determine enrichment of protein-bound
phenylalanine, amino acids derived from the purified pellet were
converted to their N-acetyl-n-propyl esters and analyzed by gas
chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-
IRMS, Hewlett Packard 5890-Finnigan GC combustion III-Finnigan
Deltaplus; Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) as described previ-
ously (10).
Calculations for muscle fractional synthetic rate. Mixed muscle
and myofibrillar protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR) were calcu-
lated employing the standard precursor-product method:
FSR � �Ep phe ⁄ (Eic phe � t) � 100
where �Ep phe is the difference in protein-bound phenylalanine en-
richment between biopsies taken immediately after exercise and after
180 min of recovery or between the preinfusion plasma sample (33)
and the first biopsy for calculation of FSR at rest; Eic phe is the
intracellular phenylalanine enrichment in the biopsy collected 2 h
after infusion for the calculation at rest and the average in the case of

which unless otherwise indicated are presented in the text (means �
SE). Fold changes were calculated relative to the average value at rest
for all four trials. A two-way (time � supplement) repeated-measures
ANOVA was applied to compare changes in intracellular signaling,
kinase activity, protein-protein interactions, and levels of glycogen
and amino acids. To evaluate changes in FSR and area under the curve
(AUC), a one-way ANOVA was employed. Whenever a significant
main or interaction effect was observed, a Fisher’s LSD post hoc test
was performed. All statistical analyses were performed with STATIS-
TICA software (version 12.0; StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). P � 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Exercise performance. Seven subjects performed the exact
same number of repetitions at the same load in all four trials (a
total of 103 � 6 reps for 10 sets), whereas one subject
performed one additional repetition in total in two of the trials.
In addition, there were no interindividual differences in time
under tension (a total of 343 � 32 s). The heavy load was
initiated at 85 � 1% of each subject’s 1RM, and the final set
was performed at 65 � 3% of each subject’s 1RM.
Plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, and lactate. The
average preexercise insulin concentration for all four trials was
4.5 � 0.5 mU/l, and the peak concentrations were attained
15–30 min after exercise in all trials (Placebo: 14 � 2 mU/l,
Leucine: 13 � 2 mU/l, BCAA: 16 � 2 mU/l, and EAA; 16 �
mU/l) with no significant differences between trials. However,
the area under the curve (AUC) for insulin concentration was
greater with EAA than Placebo or Leucine (P � 0.05).
As expected, the exercise resulted in a pronounced elevation
in the level of lactate (P � 0.05) peaking at 10.6–12.1 mmol/l
immediately following exercise in all trials, with no differences
in the AUC between the interventions. The plasma glucose
concentration fluctuated nonsignificantly between 4.0 and 5.6
mmol/l throughout the trials, and the AUC did not differ
between trials.
Muscle glycogen. The baseline levels of muscle glycogen
(averaging of 536 mmol/kg dry muscle) were similar in all
trials. Following exercise, muscle glycogen content was low-

 ered significantly by 22–30%, again with no differences be-
tween interventions. During recovery, a minor, but statistically
significant resynthesis of glycogen occurred (�7%) to a similar
extent in all four trials.
Muscle concentrations of amino acids. The levels of leucine
in muscle biopsies taken immediately after exercise were
elevated in comparison to the value at pre-exercise (Pre) to a
similar extent in all trials involving supplementation with
amino acids (40–51%; P � 0.05 vs. Pre and Placebo, Fig. 2A),
and these levels remained significantly higher throughout the
entire recovery period. In the Placebo trial, the level of leucine
90 min after exercise was 25% lower than baseline (P � 0.05)
and was still significantly lower at the end of the recovery
period. In the BCAA and EAA trials, levels of isoleucine were
elevated by 44–45% immediately and 90 min after exercise
(P � 0.05 vs. Pre, Placebo and Leucine trials, Fig. 2B),
returning to the baseline value by the end of recovery.
A pronounced reduction in isoleucine concentration was
detected in the Placebo trial following 90 and 180 min of
recovery (31% and 39%, respectively; P � 0.05 time �
supplement), and even more so in the Leucine trial (55% and
78%, respectively; P � 0.05 time � supplement). Muscle
levels of valine increased immediately after exercise in the
BCAA and EAA trials (31% and 26%, respectively), and
remained at a similar elevated level throughout recovery (P �
0.05 vs. Pre, Fig. 2C). Similar to what was observed for
isoleucine, valine levels fell during recovery in the Placebo
trial, and significantly more so in the Leucine trial, with an
average reduction during recovery by 21% and 42%, respec-
tively (P � 0.05 time � supplement). Muscle levels of the sum
of EAA were increased to a similar extent immediately after
exercise in the BCAA and EAA trials (P � 0.05 vs. Pre, Fig.
2D). With EAA supplementation these levels were maintained
elevated the entire recovery period, whereas the levels were
reduced to baseline values in the BCAA trial. The sum of EAA
was unchanged at all time points in the Placebo trial, while
being reduced by 15 and 23% after 90 and 180 min of
recovery, respectively, in the Leucine trial. Muscle levels of
the individual EAAs and tyrosine are documented in Table 1.

 Intracellular signaling and kinase activity. Following 90
min of recovery from exercise, the degree of phosphorylation
of Akt at Ser473 was elevated to a similar extent in all four trials
(31–73%; P � 0.05 vs. Pre, Fig. 3A), returning to baseline after
180 min of recovery. In addition, phosphorylation of mTOR at
Ser2448 was enhanced by 58–78% (P � 0.05 vs. Pre, Fig. 3B)
in all four trials immediately after exercise. Following 90 min
of recovery, this phosphorylation remained elevated in the
Placebo trial but had increased to a significantly higher level in
the other trials (Leucine 37%, BCAA 57%, and EAA 71% vs.
Placebo). In the final biopsy, mTOR phosphorylation was still
significantly higher than the baseline value, more so in the
BCAA and EAA trials than the Placebo and Leucine trials
(P � 0.05). A pronounced elevation in the phosphorylation of
eEF2 at Thr56 above the resting value (78–150%, P � 0.05)
was observed immediately after exercise in all four trials. In
contrast, after 90 min of recovery, Thr56 was hypophosphory-
lated in all four trials (reductions by: Placebo 33%, Leucine
33%, BCAA 51%, and EAA 52%, P � 0.05 vs. Pre, Fig. 3C),
with no difference between supplements, and it was still
hypophosphorylated to a similar extent at the end of recovery
in all four trials.
The mean activity of S6K1 before exercise was 0.17
pmol·min�1·mg�1 protein for all trials. After 90 min of recov-
ery, the activity was increased compared with that at baseline
in all four trials (P � 0.05, Fig. 4) (Placebo: 0.40, Leucine:
0.74, BCAA: 0.94, and EAA: 1.47 pmol·min-1·mg-1; P � 0.05
time � supplement). Following 180 min of recovery, the
activity was similar in the Placebo and Leucine trials (3-fold
vs. Pre; P � 0.05), and 60–95% higher with BCAA and EAA
than with the former two (P � 0.05). Lastly, S6K1 activity was
well reflected by the S6K1 phosphorylation at the Thr389
residue (data not shown) as illustrated by the significant cor-
relation between the two (r � 0.70; P � 0.05).
Immediately after exercise, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at
residue Thr37/46 and Thr46 was reduced by 35–61% in all trials
(P � 0.05 vs. Pre, Fig. 5, A and B). These levels returned to
baseline after 90 min of recovery in the Placebo and Leucine
trials, while being significantly elevated in the BCAA and
EAA trial in the case of Thr46 only (BCAA 28%, EAA 52%;
P � 0.05 time � supplement). At the end of the recovery
period this increase in the two latter trials remained, with no
difference between them. Phosphorylation of the Ser65 residue
of 4E-BP1 exhibited a pattern quite similar to that of Thr46, but
with no reduction immediately after exercise. After 90 min of
recovery the increase above rest was 127% with BCAA sup-
plementation and 214% with EAA (P � 0.05 time � supple-
ment, Fig. 5C). At 180 min postexercise in these two trials, the
extent of this phosphorylation was still higher than at rest and
higher than with Placebo and Leucine (P � 0.05), but there
was no longer any difference between BCAA and EAA.
eIF4E:4E-BP1 protein interaction. The amount of 4E-BP1
that immunoprecipitated together with eIF4E was elevated
17–31% immediately after exercise in all four trials (P � 0.05
vs. Pre, Fig. 5D). Following 90 min of recovery this amount
was 25–33% less with Leucine, BCAA, and EAA than at
baseline (P � 0.05 vs. Pre), but unaltered in the case of the
Placebo. At the end of recovery, this amount was reduced
relative to baseline in all four trials (Placebo: 19%, Leucine
22%, BCAA: 26%, and EAA: 37%; P � 0.05) and to a
significantly greater extent in the EAA trial than in the Placebo
and Leucine trials.
Fractional synthetic rate. The FSR values calculated varied
widely from �0.065 to 0.157% per hour (Fig. 6). The myofi-
brillar protein enrichment displayed the same degree of varia-
tion and correlated well with mixed muscle protein enrichment
(r � 0.78; P � 0.05). At rest during the first trial the FSR was
0.030 � 0.007% per hour utilizing preinfusion plasma protein
enrichment as a baseline. This value increased to 0.059 �
0.005% per hour during the 3 h recovery in the first experiment
for each subject (P � 0.05).
DISCUSSION
The novel finding of the current investigation was that
ingestion of a mixture of EAA resulted in a greater activation
of S6K1 kinase activity than ingestion of the BCAA, with the
effect of leucine alone being less potent than either of these.
Moreover, there was a more pronounced phosphorylation of
4E-BP1 in combination with a more extensive reduction of its
interaction with eIF4E in the EAA trial. A secondary observa-
tion was that ingestion of amino acids appears to only enhance
the exercise-induced phosphorylation of the Thr46 residue of
4EBP1, and not the commonly assessed combined Thr37/46
residues.
We recently found that ingestion of a mixture of EAA
stimulates S6K1 phosphorylation and activity to a greater
extent than leucine alone after resistance exercise (4). We have
also found that supplementation with all three BCAA potently
activates mTORC1 signaling (3, 9, 34). Partially on the basis of
those findings, we hypothesized here that the superior effect of
EAA in our previous study (4) was mediated by the BCAA. In
contrast to our hypothesis, ingestion of EAA stimulated S6K1
activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation to a greater extent than
that of only BCAA, which albeit in line with our idea, were
more potent than leucine alone. However, at the end of the
recovery period there was no difference between the BCAA
and EAA trials with regard to S6K1 activity and 4E-BP1
phosphorylation, although these levels were still higher than
with leucine and placebo. The explanation for this is not

 readily apparent since muscle levels of EAA were maintained
throughout recovery when these amino acids were supplied and
there was no change in the level of BCAA from 90 to 180 min
after exercise in the two trials. This indicates that the difference
between leucine and BCAA in overall stimulation of mTORC1
is greater than between BCAA and EAA.
Importantly, the differences between the supplements with
respect to stimulation of mTORC1 signaling were not due to
differences in exercise performance or muscle level of leucine,
which was similar at all time points during the Leucine,
BCAA, and EAA trials. There are, however, a few potential
explanations for these findings. These differences might reflect
direct effects on mTORC1 signaling caused by EAA other than
leucine, or a synergistic effect of these in combination with
leucine. In addition, these could be indirect effects of the
elevated levels of insulin caused by the supplementation.
Concerning the first of these potential mechanisms, some
studies have shown that in cell cultures and animal muscle, the
BCAA isoleucine and valine alone exert a low to modest
impact on S6K1 phosphorylation and activity (2, 30, 31, 44), as
well as enhancing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (53), whereas oth-
ers point to their inability in this regard (6, 20, 23). In this
context, it is also interesting that Patti and coworkers (41)
found that the BCAA as a group stimulates S6K1 activity to the
same extent as a complete mixture of amino acids. Collec-
tively, these data are in support of our finding that BCAA are
superior to leucine alone in activating mTORC1.
With reference to the other EAA, a number of investigations
in cell cultures show that individual EAA are capable of
stimulating mTORC1 signaling (6, 31, 44, 53), although their
individual effect is substantially less than that of leucine. While
Fox and colleagues (23) concluded that individual EAA other
than leucine are weak stimulators of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation,
they exhibit clear synergistic effects in combination with leu-
cine. No one has yet assessed the influence of individual EAA
on mTORC1 signaling in human skeletal muscle, although
Smith and coworkers (46) did demonstrate that a flooding dose
of phenylalanine or threonine stimulates the rate of muscle

INFLUENCE OF AMINO ACIDS ON mTORC1 SIGNALING AFTER EXERCISE

 protein synthesis. Hence, it seems likely that some of the other
EAA act in synergy with leucine and potentiate the effect of
leucine on mTORC1 signaling.
With regard to the role of insulin in our observations here,
Dennis et al. (17) reported that the activation of mTORC1
signaling in Rat2 fibroblasts carrying a constitutively active
Rag-complex, which mimics maximal stimulation by amino
acids, was further enhanced by insulin acting via the TSC-
Rheb axis, a parallel signal to that of amino acids. This
suggests that higher levels of insulin can mediate additional
effects on mTORC1 under maximal amino acid stimulation. In
the case of human muscle, elevating insulin levels from about
15 to 50 mU/l after EAA ingestion by adding carbohydrate to
the supplement gave no additional stimulation of mTORC1
signaling (26). In contrast, Greenhaff and coworkers (27)
demonstrated that in resting muscle under amino acid infusion,
S6K1 phosphorylation responds to elevated insulin in the range
of 5 to 167 mU/l, although this was not reflected in changes in
muscle FSR. In the present study, the peak insulin concentra-
tion was similar in all trials (13 to 15 mU/l). These low levels
of insulin and the comparable effects on Akt phosphorylation
indicate that the potentiated mTORC1 signaling is not medi-
ated by insulin, although it cannot be conclusively ruled out.
This conclusion is in line with our previous observation that
EAA stimulates S6K1 activity more potently than EAA with-
out leucine, despite no differences in the levels of insulin or
Akt phosphorylation (4).
Stimulation of protein synthesis by amino acids is dependent
on mTORC1 signaling (2, 18) and enhanced S6K1 phosphor-
ylation is associated with increases in protein synthesis (5, 36).
Accordingly, the potent stimulation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in the
EAA trial following exercise, which is indicative of a major
stimulation of the rate limiting step in translation, would be
expected to be reflected in increased rate of protein synthesis.
Unfortunately, we were not able to accurately assess protein
synthesis, as evidenced by the very large variations in FSR
values in all four trials (Fig. 6). The reason for this is not
readily apparent but is likely due to our use of multiple isotope
infusions.
Nevertheless, while our findings provide support for the idea
that EAA have the most potent effect on the protein synthetic
machinery, we also provide new insights into the role of the
various phosphorylation sites of the mTORC1 target 4EBP1.
Of the seven phosphorylation sites identified on 4E-BP1, the
ones considered most important for its function are Thr37,
Thr46, Thr70, and Ser65, which are phosphorylated in that
hierarchical order (25), where Thr37 and Thr46 phosphorylation
appear to be permissive for the latter to occur (8, 29). The
precise mechanism responsible for these different phosphory-
lations and their contribution to the release of eIF4E seems to
be rather complex. While mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1 di-
rectly at Thr37 and Thr46 in vitro (13, 24), it has not yet been
shown that mTOR itself phosphorylates Thr70 and Ser65, even
though these latter sites are clearly mTOR-dependent (8, 39,
50). Furthermore, it has been proposed that all three Thr
residues are more or less important for resolving the interaction
with eIF4E, while Ser65 is dispensable for this event (22, 25,
40) but is suggested to play a role in preventing reassociation
(43). Our present data do not resolve this matter but are in
general agreement with the latter model. First, the pattern of
Thr46 phosphorylation is more closely associated with the
interaction with eIF4E than that of Ser65, e.g., the reduction in
Thr46 immediately after exercise paralleled an enhanced inter-
action, which was not the case for Ser65. Interestingly, the more
pronounced phosphorylation of Ser65 in the EAA trial could
explain the greater decrease in interaction at the end of recov-
ery if this prevents rebinding of eIF4E. Surprisingly, our
observations indicate that upon amino acid stimulation,
mTORC1 appears to primarily phosphorylate the Thr46 residue
of 4EBP1. This notion is supported by the finding that during
recovery, Thr46 phosphorylation was elevated in a pattern
which closely resembled that of S6K1 activity, with the largest
increases seen in the BCAA and EAA trials. In contrast, there
were no significant differences between trials with regard to the
commonly assessed Thr37/46 at any time point following exer-
cise. This was unexpected, since in cells these two sites
respond in a similar manner to mTORC1 stimulation (13, 21),
but to our knowledge, the individual effect of feeding or
exercise on these two sites has not been evaluated in human
skeletal muscle. However, the results presented here should be
interpreted with some caution, as the specificity of the Thr46
antibody was incomplete for this residue.
Muscle levels of leucine were similar in all trials with amino
acid supplementation. While others have shown and argued
that after amino acid ingestion, isoleucine and valine antago-
nize the uptake of leucine by the muscle (14, 15), our data do
not support this notion. These differences could, however,
relate to the pattern of administration, as Churchward-Venne
and coworkers (14, 15) gave their BCAA- and leucine-en-
riched protein supplements as large boluses, while we admin-
istered our supplements, which were comparable in the amount
of leucine but higher in BCAA content, as nine separate
ingestions over the course of 170 min. Moreover, levels of
isoleucine and valine decreased substantially during recovery
in muscle in the Leucine trial. It would appear likely that this
reflects an improved net balance of muscle protein and/or
stimulation of BCAA metabolism by leucine ingestion (42,
49). The finding that muscle levels of valine and isoleucine
were reduced to merely 48 and 22% of the resting level in the
Leucine trial, respectively, might negatively influence the rate
of protein synthesis over time due to substrate depletion (19,
52). Since muscle levels of the remaining EAA only were
reduced by 16% during recovery, supplementation with the

 BCAA would be of particular importance, since their levels
were reduced by far the most and thus would be the most likely
to become limiting.
In summary, oral supplementation with BCAA following
resistance exercise stimulates mTORC1 signaling more po-
tently than ingestion of leucine alone, but not as effectively as
EAA. The more pronounced activation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1
following 90 min of recovery, together with the more sustained
reduction in 4E-BP1:eIF4E interaction with EAA supplemen-
tation, indicate that a mixture of EAA stimulates translation
initiation to a greater extent than BCAA. However, when
considering a 180 min recovery period, the difference between
the two supplements is reduced. In addition, the data we
document here suggest that phosphorylation of the Thr46, but
not the Thr37 residue of 4E-BP1, is enhanced by amino acid
stimulation. Furthermore, the former phosphorylation is more
reflective of the 4E-BP1:eIF4E interaction than phosphoryla-
tion of Ser65, which might instead be involved in preventing
reassociation of these two proteins. The upstream mechanism
underlying the potentiating effects of BCAA and, in particular,
EAA on leucine-induced mTORC1 signaling requires further
investigation to test the likelihood that the other EAA are
directly involved.
