Diabetes mellitus as a compelling indication for use of renin 
angiotensin system blockers: systematic review and meta-analysis 
of randomized trials
Sripal Bangalore,1 Robert Fakheri,1 Bora Toklu,2 Franz H Messerli3 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate the outcomes with use of renin 
angiotensin system (RAS) blockers compared with 
other antihypertensive agents in people with diabetes.
Design
Meta-analysis.
Data sOurCes anD stuDy seleCtiOn
PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of 
controlled trials databases for randomized trials of RAS 
blockers versus other antihypertensive agents in 
people with diabetes mellitus. Outcomes were death, 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, angina, 
stroke, heart failure, revascularization, and end stage 
renal disease.
results
The search yielded 19 randomized controlled trials that 
enrolled 25 414 participants with diabetes for a total of 
95 910 patient years of follow-up. When compared with 
other antihypertensive agents, RAS blockers were 
associated with a similar risk of death (relative risk 0.99, 
95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.05), cardiovascular 
death (1.02, 0.83 to 1.24), myocardial infarction (0.87
, 
0.64 to 1.18), angina pectoris (0.80, 0.58 to 1.11), stroke 
(1.04, 0.92 to 1.17), heart failure (0.90, 0.76 to 1.07), and 
revascularization (0.97
, 0.77 to 1.22). There was also no 
difference in the hard renal outcome of end stage renal 
disease (0.99, 0.78 to 1.28) (power of 94% to show a 
23% reduction in end stage renal disease).
COnClusiOns
In people with diabetes, RAS blockers are not superior 
to other antihypertensive drug classes such as 
thiazides, calcium channel blockers, and β blockers at 
reducing the risk of hard cardiovascular and renal 
endpoints. These findings support the 
recommendations of the guidelines of the European 
Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension 
and eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, 
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood 
Pressure to also use other antihypertensive agents in 
people with diabetes but without kidney disease.
Introduction
People with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovas-
cular and renal events.1  Early placebo controlled trials 
(such as the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation and 
European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events With 
Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease) have 
shown significant benefits from use of renin angioten-
sin system (RAS) blockers on cardiovascular and renal 
events in people with diabetes, benefits touted to be 
independent of the drugs blood pressure lowering effi-
cacy. As such, the 2015 American Diabetes Association 
guidelines recommend RAS blockers (angiotensin con-
verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs)) as first line treatment for people with 
diabetes and hypertension.2  Similarly, the 2013 Ameri-
can Society of Hypertension/International Society of 
Hypertension guidelines favor RAS blockers as a first 
line treatment in people with diabetes.3  The National 
Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality 
Initiative clinical practice guidelines state in its execu-
tive summary that “Hypertensive people with diabetes 
and chronic kidney disease stages 1-4 should be treated 
with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, usually in combina-
tion with a diuretic.”4  In contrast, the 2013 European 
Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hyperten-
sion guidelines5  and the 2014 evidence based guide-
lines from the panel members of the eighth Joint 
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure6 recom-
mend any class of antihypertensive agents in people 
with diabetes, with a preference for RAS blockers only 
in the presence of proteinuria or microalbuminuria. 
This seemingly discordant set of recommendations 
begs the questions about the evidence base to support 
superior cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of 
RAS blockers in people with diabetes.
We explored whether RAS blockers are superior to 
other antihypertensive agents for the prevention of hard 
cardiovascular and renal events in people with diabetes.
Methods
eligibility criteria
We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane central 
register of controlled trials until December 2015 (week 1) 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Various guidelines recommend renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers as first line 
treatment for people with diabetes, predominantly based on placebo controlled 
trials done 20 years ago
However, other guidelines recommend RAS blockers on a par with other 
antihypertensives based on more recent trials comparing RAS blockers versus 
active comparators
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Our study suggests that in people with diabetes, RAS blockers are similar to other 
antihypertensives at reducing the risk of hard cardiovascular and renal endpoints
These findings support the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of 
Hypertension and eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guideline recommendations
Those guidelines recommend using any antihypertensives in people with diabetes 
but without kidney disease

for randomized controlled trials of RAS blockers (ACE 
inhibitor or ARB) (see supplementary table S1 for MeSH 
terms) in people with diabetes or impaired fasting glu-
cose. There were no language restrictions for the search. 
In addition, we searched the bibliography of identified 
original trials, meta-analyses, and review articles to find 
other eligible trials (“snowball search”). Weekly remind-
ers from PubMed kept the search up to date.
Eligible trials had to fulfill two criteria: randomized 
controlled trials comparing RAS blockers with other 
antihypertensive agents in participants with diabetes or 
impaired fasting glucose, and a sample size of at least 
100 participants with diabetes with follow-up of at least 
one year (to minimize small study effect). We excluded 
studies conducted in cohorts with heart failure given 
the known efficacy of RAS blockers in this patient 
group. In addition, we excluded studies that had been 
redacted for any reason, compared ACE inhibitors with 
ARBs, RAS blockers with placebo, or randomized par-
ticipants to an ACE inhibitor plus ARB.
trial selection and bias assessment
Three authors (RF, BT, SB) independently assessed trial 
eligibility, trial bias risk, and data extraction, with dis-
agreements resolved by consensus. The bias risk of tri-
als was assessed using the components for randomized 
trials recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration7: 
allocation sequence generation, allocation conceal-
ment, and blinding of outcome assessors. For each 
component, we categorized trials as being at low, high, 
or unclear risk of bias. We considered trials with high or 
unclear risk of bias for any one of the above compo-
nents as trials with high risk of bias.
Outcomes
Outcomes were death, cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction, angina, stroke, heart failure, revasculariza-
tion, end stage renal disease, major adverse cardiovascu-
lar events, and drug withdrawal owing to adverse events.
statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using an intention 
to treat approach and in line with recommendations 
from the Cochrane Collaboration and the preferred 
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analy-
ses statement.7 8  We carried out analyses to compare 
RAS blockers (ACE inhibitor or ARB) with other agents. 
Subgroup analyses compared RAS blockers with each 
class of comparative agent (calcium channel blockers, 
diuretics, and β blockers). The meta-analytic summary 
estimates (relative risk) were calculated using the fixed 
effect model and the random-effects model of DerSimo-
nian and Laird.9 Continuity correction was used for tri-
als with zero events. We used the I2 statistic to assess 
heterogeneity—the proportion of total variation 
observed between the trials attributable to differences 
between trials rather than to sampling error (chance),10 
with an I2 value less than 25% considered low and more 
than 75% high. We assessed small study effect using the 
Begg’s and the Egger’s test and by visual evaluation of 
the funnel plots for asymmetry.
A metaregression analysis was performed to evaluate 
the relation of percent of participants with nephropathy 
at baseline on the outcomes. We used a residual maxi-
mum likelihood to estimate the additive (between 
study) component of variance τ2 for the metaregression 
analysis. Bootstrap analyses were performed using a 
Monte Carlo permutation test for metaregression, using 
10 000 random permutations.11  Sensitivity analyses 
were done after excluding trials that included partici-
pants with impaired fasting glucose. Analyses were per-
formed using standard statistical software (Stata 12.1, 
Stata, TX),12 with P<0.05 used to denote statistical 
 
significance.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
study selection and baseline characteristics
Our search yielded 19 randomized controlled trials (see 
supplementary figure S1), enrolling 25 414 people with 
diabetes. The participants were followed for a mean of 
3.8 years, totalling 95 910 patient years of follow-up. Fif-
teen trials compared RAS blockers with a calcium chan-
nel blocker, three with a thiazide diuretic, and two with a 
β blocker. In 14 trials the RAS blockers were an ACE 
inhibitor and in six an ARB. All trials enrolled people 
with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the majority of the trials 
(n=17) enrolled people with diabetes and hypertension.
Table 1 outlines the baseline characteristics of the 
included trials. In the studies that reported race/eth-
nicity, black people were a minority of the enrolled 
patients. The primary endpoint for the trials was het-
erogeneous (see supplementary table S2). Only three 
trials enrolled patients with microalbuminuria or 
proteinuria.
Outcomes
RAS blockers versus other antihypertensives
When compared with other antihypertensive agents, 
RAS blockers were associated with a similar risk of 
death (relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 
1.05, fig 1 ), cardiovascular death (1.02, 0.83 to 1.24, fig 
2 ), myocardial infarction (0.87, 0.64 to 1.18, fig 3 ), 
angina pectoris (0.80, 0.58 to 1.11, fig 4 ), stroke (1.04, 
0.92 to 1.17
, fig 5 ), heart failure (0.90, 0.76 to 1.07
, fig 6 ), 
and revascularization (0.97
, 0.77 to 1.22, fig 7 ). The out-
come of major adverse cardiovascular events (0.97
, 0.89 
to 1.06) did not differ between the two groups. In addi-
tion, there was no difference in end stage renal disease 
(0.99, 0.78 to 1.28, fig 8 ) or drug withdrawal owing to 
adverse effects (fig 9 ). The results were consistent when 
using a fixed effect model (figs 1-9). Heterogeneity was 
low to moderate, with no evidence of small study effect/
publication bias (see supplementary figures S2-S10).

RAS blockers versus calcium channel blockers
When compared with calcium channel blockers, RAS 
blockers were associated with a similar risk of death 
(1.01, 0.92 to 1.10, fig 1 ), cardiovascular death (1.17
, 0.90 to 
1.50, fig 2 ), myocardial infarction (0.84, 0.54 to 1.30, 
fig 3 ), angina pectoris (0.69, 0.33 to 1.42, fig 4 ), stroke 
(1.08, 0.90 to 1.28, fig 5 ), and revascularization (1.01, 0.74 
to 1.39, figs 7 and 10 ). However, RAS blockers were asso-
ciated with a significant reduction in the risk of heart 
failure compared with calcium channel blockers (0.78, 
0.70 to 0.88, figs 6 and 10 ). There was no difference in 
drug withdrawal owing to adverse effects (fig 9 ) or end 
stage renal disease (figs 8 and 10 ). Heterogeneity was low 
to moderate (fig 10), with no evidence of small study 
effect/publication bias (see supplementary figures S2-10).
RAS blockers versus thiazide diuretics
Compared with thiazide diuretics, RAS blockers were 
associated with a similar risk of death (0.99, 0.90 to 
1.08, fig 1 ), cardiovascular death (0.50, 0.05 to 5.46, 
fig 2 ), and other outcomes (figs 3-9 and 11 ). Only three 
trials compared RAS blockers with diuretics and hence 
the confidence interval for most outcomes was wide. 
Heterogeneity was low to moderate (fig 11), with no evi-
dence of small study effect/publication bias (see sup-
plementary figures S2-10).
RAS blockers versus β blockers
Compared with β blockers, RAS blockers were associ-
ated with a similar risk of death (0.84, 0.47 to 1.51, fig 1 ), 
cardiovascular death (0.87
, 0.47 to 1.60, fig 2 ), and other 
outcomes tested (figs 3-9 and 12 ). Only two trials com-
pared RAS blockers with β blockers and hence the con-
fidence interval for most outcomes was wide. 
Heterogeneity was high for the outcome of death but 
low to moderate for other outcomes (fig 12), with no evi-
dence of small study effect/publication bias (see sup-
plementary figures S2-10).
influence of nephropathy
Metaregression analysis, aimed to assess the relation of 
percent of patients with nephropathy at baseline on the 
outcomes, showed no significant relation (P>0.05) for 
all outcomes.

sensitivity analysis
Results were largely similar in sensitivity analysis 
excluding trials of participants with impaired fasting 
glucose (see supplementary table S3).
discussion
This analysis of patients with diabetes (largely without 
microalbuminuria or proteinuria) with 95 910 patient 
years of follow-up from randomized trials failed to show 
a superiority of renin angiotensin system (RAS) block-
ade over other antihypertensive agents for reduction of 
cardiovascular and renal outcomes. More importantly, 
compared with other agents RAS blockers showed no 
benefit in reducing the risk of death or myocardial 
infarction and end stage renal disease. The results were 
consistent in comparisons of RAS blockers with all con-
trols and with individual antihypertensive agents.
ras blockers for diabetes
People with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of 
hypertension, and the concomitant presence of diabe-
tes and hypertension is associated with an exponential 
increase in the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, 
and renal events.45  Previous trials have shown that 
blood pressure reduction in such patients leads to a 
significant reduction in cardiovascular events, empha-
sizing the need for aggressive management of hyper-
tension in this cohort.46  However, whether one 
antihypertensive drug class is superior to the other is 
controversial. Early studies of RAS blockade in patients 
with diabetes and microalbuminuria showed a signifi-
cant “renoprotective” effect (mainly by slowing pro-
gression to clinical proteinuria) compared with 
placebo,47  leading to the recommendation of RAS 
blockers for this indication. This recommendation was 
later extended to all people with diabetes. In addition, 
small head to head comparison trials of RAS blockers 
(fosinopril) versus calcium channel blockers (amlodip-
ine) such as the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardio-
vascular Events Randomized Trial (380 participants) 
showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular 
events (secondary endpoint of combined outcome of 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospital admission for 
angina) with RAS blockers compared with calcium 
channel blockers.24  However, hard endpoints of death 
or myocardial infarction did not differ in this trial.

Subsequent guidelines, including the seventh report of 
the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure pro-
moted diabetes as a compelling indication for RAS 
blockade. The American Diabetic Association guidelines 
states “In people with diabetes, inhibitors of the 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may have unique advan-
tages for initial or early treatment of  
hypertension.” 
However, more recent trials have failed to show superi-
ority of RAS blockers compared with other antihyper-
tensive agents for hard cardiovascular outcomes.35  In 
addition, studies with larger sample size (for exam-
ple, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treat-
ment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) with 
13 101 patients with diabetes) also failed to show the 
superiority of RAS blockers compared with other 
RAS blockers v calcium channel blockers

antihypertensive agents for cardiovascular outcomes.18 
 
Indeed, two decades ago one author stated about the 
progression of chronic kidney disease that “despite 
some discrepancies in experimental studies, recent 
controlled clinical trials show a similar slowing of pro-
gression with either ACEi [ACE inhibitor] or CCB 
 
[calcium channel blocker].”48 Consequently opinion 
now diverges among various guidelines about the role 
of RAS blockade in people with diabetes, with some 
guidelines still recommending RAS blockers as pre-
ferred drugs and some relegating them to be on a par 
with other antihypertensive drug classes.

Given the controversy and the discordance in vari-
ous guideline recommendations about the role of RAS 
blockers in people with diabetes we evaluated the 
comparative effectiveness of RAS blockers compared 
with other antihypertensive agents in people with dia-
betes, excluding cohorts where RAS blockers are 
shown to provide benefit (that is, heart failure). We 
also excluded placebo controlled trials since placebo 
is not the standard of care in such patients. The results 
of this study with over 95 000 patient years of fol-
low-up from head to head randomized trials of RAS 
blockers versus other antihypertensive agents failed to

show a superiority of RAS blockers over other antihy-
pertensive agents for the prevention of hard 
 
cardiovascular or renal outcomes. The notable excep-
tion in our analysis was that the RAS blockers were 
superior to calcium channel blockers for the preven-
tion of heart failure. This outcome (heart failure) was 
mainly driven by the ALLHAT trial, the findings of 
which have been criticized.49  Our findings of similar 
outcomes with RAS blockers compared with other 
antihypertensive agents therefore supports both the 
2013 Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hyper-
tension guidelines5  and the 2014 eighth Joint National 
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure6 recommendation 
that any class of antihypertensive agents can be used 
in people with diabetes.
Diabetes with proteinuria or microalbuminuria
Both the 2013 Society of Cardiology/European Society 
of Hypertension guidelines5  and the 2014 eighth Joint 
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalu-
ation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure6  recom-
mend RAS blockers in the presence of proteinuria or 
microalbuminuria. The guideline recommendations 
favoring RAS blockers in those with diabetes and 
chronic kidney disease are driven mainly by placebo 
controlled trials of RAS blockers where there was a 
reduction in doubling of serum creatinine concentra-
tion (the Microalbuminuria, Cardiovascular, and 
Renal Outcomes substudy of the Heart Outcomes Pre-
vention Evaluation study (MICRO-HOPE) and the 
Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angioten-
sin II Antagonist Losartan study (RENAAL) and end 
stage renal disease (RENAAL) compared with pla-
cebo.50 51  Casas and colleagues showed a greater ben-
efit of RAS blockers on renal outcomes in placebo 
controlled trials than active comparison trials and 
concluded that the benefits of RAS blockers on renal 
outcomes probably results from a blood pressure low-
ering effect.52  Palmer and colleagues, in a meta-anal-
ysis of trials enrolling patients with diabetes and 
kidney disease, found that no drug regimen was more 
effective than placebo for reducing all cause mortal-
ity.53  However, end stage renal disease and a doubling 
of creatinine concentration was less likely and regres-
sion of albuminuria was more likely with ACE inhibi-
tors or ARBs compared with placebo.53 Limited trials 
have shown this superiority in active comparator tri-
als. In the Irbesartan Type II Diabetic Nephropathy 
Trial (1715 patients with diabetic nephropathy) the 
RAS blocker irbesartan compared with the calcium 
channel blocker amlodipine was associated with a 
significant reduction in the risk of the primary com-
posite end point (32.6%v 41.1%; P=0.006) of a dou-
bling of serum creatinine concentration, the 
development of end stage renal disease, or death from 
any cause, driven by differences in doubling of serum 
creatinine concentration (16.9%v 25.4%; P<0.001), 
with numerically lower end stage renal disease 
(14.2%v 18.3%; P=0.07) but with no difference in 
death (15.0%v 14.6%; P>0.05).28  Finally, Wu and 
 
colleagues in a meta-analysis of RAS blockers in 
patients with diabetes showed no statistically signifi-
cant difference among treatments for the hard end-
point of end stage renal disease even in the placebo 
comparisons.54  However, an ACE inhibitor reduced 
the risk of doubling of serum creatinine compared 
with placebo.54 Our study excluded placebo con-
trolled trials and failed to show a benefit for the out-
come of end stage renal disease with RAS blockers 
compared with other antihypertensive agents. Our 
analysis with 17 626 patients (for the outcome of end 
stage renal disease) had a power of 94% to show a 
23% reduction in end stage renal disease with RAS 
blockers compared with controls and is thus suffi-
ciently powered to show a difference if one existed.
limitations of this study
We used trial level data only for the analyses and hence 
were unable to control for differences between trials. 
Although a separate analysis in the cohort of patients 
with nephropathy is desirable, trials did not report out-
comes separately for this cohort. Moreover, the defini-
tion of nephropathy was variable. In addition, most of 
the studies in patients with diabetes and nephropathy 
were placebo controlled trials and excluded in the cur-
rent analysis. There were only a few trials for the RAS 
blocker compared with diuretics and RAS blockers 
compared with β blocker, and the analyses are likely 
underpowered. For the renal outcomes, we only evalu-
ated end stage renal disease as an outcome as this is 
considered a “hard” renal endpoint. While one can 
argue that a doubling of serum creatinine concentra-
tion is a stringent renal endpoint, only one trial 
reported this outcome. Most patients with diabetes and 
hypertension require on an average two antihyperten-
sive agents and thus which agent should be first may 
not be critical. The results were partly driven by the 
ALLHAT trial, given the sample size. However, this trial 
did not monitor urine protein.
Conclusions
This analysis of head to head comparison trials of RAS 
blockers versus other antihypertensive agents in peo-
ple with diabetes (and largely without microalbumin-
uria or proteinuria) failed to show a superiority of 
RAS blockers compared with other antihypertensive 
agents for the prevention of hard outcomes. The 
results support the recommendation of both the 2013 
European Society of Cardiology/European Society of 
Hypertension guidelines5  and the 2014 eighth report 
of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detec-
tion, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-
sure6 that any class of antihypertensive agents can be 
used in people with diabetes especially in those with-
out renal impairment.
