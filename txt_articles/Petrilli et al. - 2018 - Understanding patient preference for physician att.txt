Objective Several large studies have shown that 
improving the patient experience is associated with 
higher reported patient satisfaction, increased adherence 
to treatment and clinical outcomes. Whether physician 
attire can affect the patient experience—and how this 
influences satisfaction—is unknown. Therefore, we 
performed a national, cross-sectional study to examine 
patient perceptions, expectations and preferences 
regarding physicians dress.
setting 10 academic hospitals in the USA.
Participants Convenience sample of 4062 patients 
recruited from 1 June 2015 to 31 October 2016.
Primary and secondary outcomes measures We 
conducted a questionnaire-based study of patients 
across 10 academic hospitals in the USA. The 
questionnaire included photographs of a male and 
female physician dressed in seven different forms of 
attire. Patients were asked to rate the provider pictured 
in various clinical settings. Preference for attire was 
calculated as the composite of responses across 
five domains (knowledgeable, trustworthy, caring, 
approachable and comfortable) via a standardised 
instrument. Secondary outcome measures included 
variation in preferences by respondent characteristics 
(eg, gender), context of care (eg, inpatient vs outpatient) 
and geographical region.
results Of 4062 patient responses, 53% indicated that 
physician attire was important to them during care. Over 
one-third agreed that it influenced their satisfaction with 
care. Compared with all other forms of attire, formal attire 
with a white coat was most highly rated (p=0.001 vs 
scrubs with white coat; p<0.001 all other comparisons). 
Important differences in preferences for attire by clinical 
context and respondent characteristics were noted. For 
example, respondents≥65 years preferred formal attire 
with white coats (p<0.001) while scrubs were most 
preferred for surgeons.
Conclusions Patients have important expectations 
and perceptions for physician dress that vary by 
context and region. Nuanced policies addressing 
physician dress code to improve patient satisfaction 
appear important.
IntrOduCtIOn 
At its core, the practice of medicine hinges 
on the patient–physician relationship. From 
initial introductions, physicians work to build 
rapport to foster a partnership to provide 
patient-centred care, defined as that which is: 
‘respectful of, and responsive to, individual 
patient preferences, needs and values’.1 Not 
surprisingly, medical school curricula often 
include courses aimed at improving the 
patient experience.2 Similarly, since 2007, 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid has 
required hospitals to collect, submit and 
publicly report the results of the Hospital 
Consumer 
Assessment 
of 
Healthcare 
Providers and Systems survey or risk finan-
cial penalties.3 These data are also important 
because they have been linked to clinical 
outcomes. For example, a positive correla-
tion between patient satisfaction, improved 
mortality and reduced 30-day readmissions 
has been reported.4–8 
Although improving the patient experi-
ence, and consequently satisfaction, is an 
important target for many hospitals, how best 
to do this is unclear. One approach is to under-
stand how physician attire influences the 
patient experience and develops guidelines 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This is the largest study to date that examines pa-
tient preferences for physician attire.
 
► The study design and survey instrument were care-
fully designed to limit biases associated with physi-
cian images.
 
► The providers pictured in our survey instrument 
were young, slender and Caucasian, which may limit 
generalisability of findings.
 
► While soliciting patient responses while hospitalised 
helps generate validity, it is possible that reported 
impressions may not reflect actual preferences.

based on patients’ preferences. Indeed, some health-
care systems across the country have adopted stringent 
dress codes. In a recently published article, we contacted 
human resource professionals and administrators at top 
US News and World Report Hospitals,9 and found that 
five had written guidelines endorsing formal and profes-
sional attire. Yet patient preferences for physician attire 
are not straightforward. In a systematic review, we found 
that while patients preferred formal attire and white coats 
overall, attire such as scrubs or casual dress were preferred 
in specific settings.9 These findings make intuitive sense: 
patients often have notions of how a ‘professional’ should 
dress and are more likely to respond positively to those 
that meet these stereotypes. Strategies targeting physician 
dress may therefore enhance trust and satisfaction.
To date, no studies have examined expressed prefer-
ences to physician attire, association to satisfaction and 
influencing contextual factors. Therefore, we performed 
a cross-sectional survey of patients receiving care across 
the USA using a standardised questionnaire to better 
understand patients’ perceived preferences of physician 
attire across different clinical settings (eg, hospitalised vs 
ambulatory clinic visits). In addition, we aimed to analyse 
a larger sample of patients from multiple health systems 
than has been previously reported in the literature.
MethOds
study design and population
Between 1 June 2015 and 31 October 2016, a total of 6280 
surveys were provided to 10 academic medical centres 
in the USA of which 4062 surveys were filled and avail-
able for analyses (response rate=65%). The participating 
sites spanned four main geographical regions of the 
USA. The questionnaire consisted of 22 questions and 
included photographs of a male and a female physi-
cian in various forms of attire. The questionnaire was 
administered to adult patients who were receiving care 
in clinics (outpatients) or admitted to the hospital (inpa-
tients). Outpatients were approached in waiting rooms 
of general medicine and medical subspecialty clinics, 
while inpatients were approached in their hospital rooms 
when admitted to non-surgical units. At all sites, the ques-
tionnaire was administered by research staff using paper 
instruments. The surveys were administered during 
normal business hours at times convenient to each sites’ 
research staff. Respondents were allowed to request help 
filling out the form from any visitor accompanying them. 
The research staff delivered the paper instrument and 
returned approximately 5–10 min later to pick up the 
completed form. Respondents provided verbal consent. 
No identifying information was collected from those that 
completed the study.
sample size calculation
It was assumed that responses between two attire forms 
would be normally distributed on the 1–10 scale between 
attire types. An estimated SD of 2.2 was used. If our study 
included at least 816 patients, (assuming a two-sided alpha 
error of 0.05), we expected to have 90% power to detect 
differences for effect sizes of 0.50 on the 1–10 scale. Fewer 
subjects would be needed if the SDs were smaller.
Patient and public involvement
The study was designed to understand patient experience 
and preferences. However, patients were not included

in the design of the survey instrument, recruitment or 
conduct of the study. Patients who participated did so 
anonymously, and therefore the study team will be unable 
to disseminate the results to study participants.
study design and data collection
The questionnaire was developed from a systematic 
review that examined the role of physician attire on 
patient preferences and satisfaction.9 A multidisciplinary 
team of psychometricians, research scientists, choice 
architects, survey experts and bioethicists developed 
the study instrument. Each question sought to elicit 
preferences regarding various forms of physician attire, 
including: casual, casual with white coat, scrubs, scrubs 
with white coat, formal, formal with white coat and busi-
ness suit (figure 1). Photographs of the same Caucasian 
male and female physician donning such attire were 
taken by a professional photographer (Scott Soderberg, 
Michigan Photography, University of Michigan) with 
strict attention to facial expressions, pose, lighting and 
other non-verbal cues as these may influence prefer-
ence or likability. The male and female physician models 
were volunteer members of the research team, and each 
provided expressed written consent to allow the publica-
tion of their photographs.
To avoid bias, 14 different versions of the study instru-
ment were created, and distribution of the questionnaires 
was randomised to participants. In each version, the 
gender and attire of the first physician model varied to 
prevent ordering, priming or anchoring effects (online 
supplementary file 1). The questionnaire had four 
sections: in the first section, respondents were asked to 
rate the physician depicted across five domains including 
knowledge, trust, care, approachability and comfort. 
In the second section, respondents were presented 
with seven photographs of the same physician wearing 
different attire and asked to select their preference in 
various clinical settings. The third and fourth sections 
sought respondents’ general opinions regarding physi-
cian attire, demographic data and frequency of interac-
tions with physicians.
Before administration, the survey instrument was 
pilot tested with a convenience sample of patients at the 
lead site to ensure photographs, questions, ratings and 
randomly generated order of the 14 surveys at each site 
would function as desired.
Measurements
Ratings regarding how knowledgeable, trustworthy, 
caring and approachable each physician appeared, as well 
as how comfortable the physician made the respondent 
feel, were measured using a 1–10 scale, where 1 indicated 
‘somewhat preferred’ versus 10 ‘extremely preferred.’ 
Preference of attire within specific care settings (eg, 
primary care, emergency room, hospital, surgery and 
overall) was assessed using photos for each of the seven 
attire categories. Respondent opinions regarding impor-
tance of dress and white coats were collected using a 1–5 
Likert scale, where 1 indicated ‘strongly disagree’ and 5 
indicated ‘strongly agree.’ We assessed patient satisfaction 
based on agreement with two questions: ‘How my doctor 
dresses is important to me,’ and ‘How my doctor dresses 
influences how happy I am with the care received.’ 
For analyses, responses were trichotomised as follows: 
agreement=strongly agree and agree; neither agree 
nor disagree and disagreement=disagree or strongly 
disagree. Demographics including age, gender, educa-
tion level, race and number of physician encounters were 
collected. Preferences for attire and demographics were 
dichotomised for bivariate comparison. Questions that

were unanswered or where more than one response was 
entered were excluded.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest—preference for attire—
was calculated as the composite average of the five indi-
vidual rating domains (knowledgeable, trustworthy, 
caring, approachable and comfortable). Additionally, 
variation in preferences for physician attire by respon-
dent characteristics (eg, gender, age), context of care (eg, 
inpatient vs outpatient) and geographical region (eg, 
Northeast, Midwest, South and West) were also assessed.
statistical analyses
Data from paper questionnaires were entered inde-
pendently and in duplicate. Since respondents were 
not required to answer all questions, the denominator 
for individual questions (and associated response rate) 
varied. Descriptive statistics (means, percentage) and SD 
were initially used to tabulate results. Differences in the 
mean composite rating scores from the physician ratings 
section were assessed using one-way analysis of variance. 
To reduce the potential for type I error, postestimation 
pairwise comparisons were performed using the Tukey-
Kramer method.2 Differences in proportions for cate-
gorical data were compared using the Z-test. Bivariate 
comparisons between respondent age, gender and level 
of education and corresponding respondent preferences 
for attire were assessed using X2 tests. A two-sided p value 
of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
All analyses were performed using Stata V.14 MP/SE 
(StataCorp).
results 
A total of 4062 questionnaires were completed by patients 
across 10 academic medical centres in the USA. Respon-
dents represented all parts of the USA including the 
Northeast, Midwest, South and West. Most patients were 
surveyed while admitted to the hospital (n=2616 (64%)); 
however, a substantial proportion of outpatients were also 
included (n=1446 (36%)). Respondents were most often 
white (71%) and male (65%). The plurality of patients 
was 65 years of age or older (36%). Seventy per cent of 
those surveyed indicated having attended some college or 
having college degrees. With respect to interactions with 
the health system, 38% of respondents reported having 
seen six or more physicians in the past year (table 1).
ratings of physician attire
Respondents rated formal attire with white coat for 
both male and female physician models as the most 
preferred form of dress compared with other forms of 
attire with a mean composite score of 8.1 (SD 1.8) (all 
pairwise comparisons p<0.001). Cronbach’s alpha for

the five items included in the composite score was 0.96. 
Ratings for formal attire with white coat were greatest 
across all domains including how knowledgeable, trust-
worthy, caring and approachable the physician appeared 
as well as how comfortable the physician made the respon-
dent feel. Moreover, these findings were significant in the 
domains of trustworthiness, caring and how comfortable 
the physician made the respondent feel in all pairwise 
comparison testing to other forms of attire (p<0.05). For 
the rating of approachability, formal attire with a white 
coat was not statistically different from scrubs with a white 
coat or formal without a white coat in pairwise compar-
ison. Scrubs with white coat ranked second overall, with a 
mean composite score of 7.6 (SD=1.9) followed by formal 
attire without a white coat with a mean composite score of 
7.5 (SD=2.0) (figure 2).
Preferences for physician attire by care settings
When examining preferences for physician attire by care 
setting, important differences emerged. Formal attire with 
white coat was preferred by respondents for their primary 
care (44%) and hospital physician (39%). Conversely, 
scrubs were rated highest for emergency room physicians 
(40%) and surgeons (42%). In both emergency and 
surgery settings, scrubs alone were followed in preference 
by scrubs with white coats (34% and 23%, respectively). 
When asked, ‘Overall, which clothes do you feel that your 
doctor should wear?’ most respondents preferred formal 
attire with white coat (44%) followed by scrubs with white 
coat (26%) (table 2). Excluding surgeons, respondents 
universally preferred physicians in white coats over no 
white coats. When evaluating surgeons, respondents indi-
cated no preference for a white coat on female physicians 
(p=0.85), but preferred male physicians without white 
coats (p<0.001). No differences in preference by physi-
cian gender in other clinical care settings were noted 
(figure 3).
Perceived influence on satisfaction, importance and 
appropriateness of physician attire
More than half (53%) of the patients surveyed agreed with 
the statement that how their doctor dresses was important 
to them, while 36% of respondents agreed with the state-
ment that physician attire influenced how happy they 
were with the care they received. Views regarding appro-
priateness of casual attire when physicians see patients 
on the weekends were mixed: 44% of respondents stated 
this was appropriate while 56% were either neutral or 
disagreed with the practice.
Specific questions regarding when physicians should 
don a white coat elicited various preferences. Most 
respondents (55%) indicated that they agreed or strongly 
agreed with the statement that doctors should wear a 
white coat when seeing patients in the office. In the emer-
gency room, however, 44% agreed with the statement that 
physicians should wear a white coat when seeing patients 
versus 56% that indicated either no preference (38%) 
or disagreement (18%). When asked whether doctors

should wear a white coat when seeing patients in the 
hospital, the majority of respondents (62%) agreed or 
strongly agreed with this statement (table 3).
Variations in patient preferences of physician attire
Important variations in patient preferences for attire 
were noted. For example, female respondents more often 
preferred scrubs with white coats in emergency room 
and hospital settings than males (41% vs 31% (p<0.001) 
and 32% vs 27% (p=0.001), respectively). However, both 
genders indicated formal attire with white coat was overall 
most preferred (43% and 44%, respectively). In hospital 
settings, respondents 65 years of age or older frequently 
preferred formal attire with white coats than younger 
patients (44% vs 36%, p<0.001). Conversely, younger 
patients more often preferred scrubs and white coats than 
formal attire overall (28% vs 21%, p<0.001). Some differ-
ences in preferences regarding physician dress based on 
respondent education level were also noted. Specifically, 
respondents with a college degree preferred formal and 
white coat for their primary care provider more often than 
those without a college degree (48% vs 42%, p<0.001).
No differences in preferences between those with three 
or more physician visits in the preceding year versus those 
with less frequent visits were noted. Similarly, preferences 
for attire did not vary by setting in which respondents 
were polled, although respondents in the outpatient 
setting more often preferred doctors in the hospital 
to wear scrubs and a white coat compared with hospi-
talised respondents (32% vs 27%, p=0.002). However, 
preferences for attire did vary by geographical region. 
For example, while formal attire and white coats were 
preferred across all regions, 50% of respondents in the 
West and 51% in the South selected this as their preferred 
option compared with 38% and 40% in the Northeast and 
Midwest, respectively. Conversely, over half of all respon-
dents in the Northeast selected scrubs as their preferred 
attire for surgeons compared with a quarter of respon-
dents in the South (54% vs 25%, p<0.001).
dIsCussIOn
This study of over 4000 patients receiving medical care in 
diverse academic medical centres is the largest to report 
preferences regarding physician attire in the USA. Over 
half of the participants indicated that how a physician 
dresses was important to them, with over one in three 
stating that this influenced how happy they were with 
care received. Overall, respondents indicated that formal 
attire with white coats was the most preferred form of 
physician dress. However, in settings such as surgery or 
emergency rooms, scrubs with white coats were most 
preferred. Although variation in preferences by respon-
dent age, gender, education and geography were noted, 
these findings indicate that most patients have expecta-
tions regarding doctor attire, and that a ‘professional’ 
look matters most. Given the size, methodological rigour 
and representativeness of these data, policies addressing 
physician attire should be considered to improve patient 
satisfaction.
Previous studies have shown that patients harbour 
conscious and unconscious biases when it comes to 
provider dress.10 11 Thus, our finding that patients have 
specific preferences regarding physician attire was not 
surprising. What this study highlights, however, is the 
potential importance of physician attire to the physician–
patient relationship. Indeed, specific clinical and contex-
tual aspects appear to influence a patient’s preconceived 
notion of ‘professional attire’. For instance, we found

that the locale where care is delivered (eg, hospital vs 
clinic) as well as context of care (eg, emergency room or 
surgery) affected preferences. Similarly, we observed that 
certain respondent characteristics such as age, gender 
and education also influenced their preferences. These 
findings can potentially be used to improve the patient 
experience. For instance, providers engaged in care of 
elderly patients (eg, geriatric clinics, hospital settings or 
extended-care facilities) may consider donning formal 
attire more so than surgeons or emergency room physi-
cians where scrubs may be more important. Similarly, 
hospitals in Southern regions of the USA may wish to 
endorse formal attire and white coats as their preferred 
policy. For providers in the emergency room and surgical 
arenas, such attire may in fact be viewed as out of place—
and thus different rules might be necessary. These exam-
ples illustrate how policies for specific doctors, settings 
or patients can be leveraged to focus on patient-centred 
care.
How should one interpret these findings given concerns 
for infection transmission associated with physician dress? 
Previous studies have shown that bacteria and pathogens 
can be isolated from white coats, neckties and sleeves 
of medical providers.12–20 These studies are one of the 
reasons why a ‘bare below the elbows’ (BBE) policy exists 
in some countries. While we did not specifically ask respon-
dents to consider this risk when choosing attire prefer-
ences, three aspects deserve discussion. First, despite the 
abundance of literature on infection prevention, we are 
unaware of any study that links physician dress to source 
or transmission of infection. Rather, one study randomly 
sampled physicians’ fingertips and reported no associa-
tion between BBE-compliant versus non-compliant attire 
and presence of bacterial colony-forming units or clini-
cally significant organisms.21 Second, evidence suggests 
that other practices (eg, hand hygiene) may be more 
relevant than physician dress in preventing infection. In 
an institution-wide study at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center, direct observation combined with financial incen-
tives for appropriate hand hygiene increased compliance 
with hand hygiene policies and decreased device-associ-
ated standardised infection ratios.22 Conversely, wearing 
a white coat has been associated with increased selec-
tive and sustained attentiveness to tasks.23 These find-
ings suggest that clothing may influence the wearer’s 
own psychological processes, a phenomenon coined 
‘enclothed cognition’.24 Therefore, attentiveness to hand 
hygiene may, in fact, be increased when physicians wear 
white coats or formal attire—improving patient care and 
satisfaction.25 26 Third, we add to the growing body of 
evidence that suggests patients have important prefer-
ences regarding attire.9 10 27–47 As further demonstrated 
by a recent study, these preferences may evolve over time, 
as demonstrated by variation in preferences by respon-
dent age.48 Physician attire may offer an important modi-
fiable variable in the doctor–patient relationship that 
could improve patient experience and satisfaction and 
ultimately produce better outcomes.49–51
Our study has limitations. First, as with other studies 
of physician attire, we showed respondents pictures of 
providers and elicited preferences via a paper question-
naire. Our providers were young, slender, Caucasian and 
all cared for in academic settings, which may have intro-
duced bias into responses. Similarly, we did not record 
information for patients who refused to participate in 
the study, also potentially introducing bias. Second, while 
approaching patients as they were receiving care helps 
generate validity, it is possible that reported impressions 
may not reflect actual preferences on attire but rather

current feelings related to their care. Prior studies have 
shown that the potential impact of attire on patient 
satisfaction has to be considered in the context of the 
behaviours and attitude of the physician during the 
encounter. The survey did not have questions to capture 
the other dynamics of the doctor–patient relationship, 
which may help further explicate responses.9 Third, we 
asked patients to report preferences via Likert scales and 
predefined categories. Although this allows for a range of 
answers (including a neither agree nor disagree option), 
such categorisations may force respondents to answer in 
ways that do not capture their true feelings. Fourth, while 
the proportion of Caucasian respondents were similar 
to 2010 Census data estimates, a lower than expected 
number of Hispanic respondents (5% compared with 
16% estimated by the Census data) participated.52 
Thus, whether our findings will hold true across race or 
ethnicity is not known. Finally, we did not include ques-
tions regarding infection transmission given the lack of 
evidence supporting the notion that white coats or attire 
is associated with infections.
Our study also has important strengths. First, this is the 
largest study to examine patient preferences for physician 
attire. Given methodological strengths including rando-
misation of instrument sequence, as well as inclusion of 
diverse regions and patient populations, our findings 
clarify possible dress codes in various healthcare settings. 
Second, in contrast to other studies, we specifically 
designed our study and survey instrument to avoid biases 
associated with images. For example, we hired a profes-
sional photographer and studio to ensure photographs 
of physicians were otherwise identical. Similarly, we also 
used models of the same race (Caucasian) with identical 
postures and facial expressions so as to limit confounding 
associated with models of different backgrounds or 
appearance as has occurred in previous studies.29 36 37 39 45 
Additionally, we implemented strategies during survey 
collection such as randomising order of delivery and 
images to minimise bias. These approaches help to lend a 
high degree of internal validity to our findings. Third, our 
findings have policy implications: namely, patients appear 
to care about attire and may expect to see their doctor in 
certain ways. Hospitals, clinics, emergency departments 
and ambulatory surgical centres should consider using 
these data to set dress codes for physicians providing care 
in these settings.
In summary, while physician attire cannot replace 
excellent clinical care, our data suggest that it may 
influence how patients perceive care and perhaps 
how willing they are to trust their doctors. In an era of 
patient centredness and patient satisfaction, physician 
attire may be an important, modifiable component of 
patient care. As perceptions and expectations regarding 
physician dress by patients, context and region exist, 
nuanced policies that target such factors appear rele-
vant. Future studies implementing such policies in both 
hospital, clinic and emergency room settings appear 
necessary.
