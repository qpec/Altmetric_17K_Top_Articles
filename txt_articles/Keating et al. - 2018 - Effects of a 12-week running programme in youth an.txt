What are the new findings?
 
► A group-based running programme provided ther-
apeutic benefit to youth and adults with complex 
mood disorders, characterised by comorbid diag-
noses, ongoing cognitive and social impairment and 
high relapse rates.
 
► The therapeutic benefits of a structured group exer-
cise programme may be impacted by higher atten-
dance, social support and younger participant age.
 
► Clinical features of mental illness, such as age 
at onset of illness, may also impact programme 
outcomes.
AbsTrACT
Objective Although numerous studies suggest a salutary 
effect of exercise on mood, few studies have explored the 
effect of exercise in patients with complex mental illness. 
Accordingly, we evaluated the impact of running on stress, 
anxiety and depression in youth and adults with complex 
mood disorders including comorbid diagnoses, cognitive 
and social impairment and high relapse rates.
Methods Participants were members of a running 
group at St Joseph Healthcare Hamilton’s Mood Disorders 
Program, designed for clients with complex mood 
disorders. On a weekly basis, participants completed 
Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale, Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) questionnaires, 
providing an opportunity to evaluate the effect of running 
in this population.
results Data collected for 46 participants from April 
2012 to July 2015 indicated a significant decrease in 
depression (p<0.0001), anxiety (p<0.0001) and stress 
(p=0.01) scores. Whereas younger participant age, 
younger age at onset of illness and higher perceived levels 
of friendship with other running group members (ps≤0.04) 
were associated with lower end-of-study depression, 
anxiety and stress scores, higher attendance was 
associated with decreasing BDI and BAI (ps≤0.01) scores 
over time. 
Conclusions Aerobic exercise in a supportive group 
setting may improve mood symptoms in youth and adults 
with complex mood disorders, and perceived social 
support may be an important factor in programme’s 
success. Further research is required to identify specifically 
the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits 
associated with exercise-based therapy programmes.
bACkgrOund
Mood disorders are a prevalent and costly 
social and health issue affecting 350 million 
people worldwide.1 In keeping with estab-
lished guidelines, antidepressants, mood 
stabilisers and psychotherapy are considered 
first-line agents in the treatment of depression 
and bipolar disorder (BD).2 3 The response 
rate to first-line treatment for major depres-
sive disorder (MDD), however, is only about 
50%–65% and is associated with significant 
relapse.4 Moreover, although approximately 
33% of persons are expected to recover fully 
following first-line treatment,5 remission is 
often characterised by residual symptoms 
including depressed mood, decreased concen-
tration and hopelessness in MDD6 and in BD7 
and higher rates of mortality across all-cause 
mortality.8 9 Medication adherence in patients 
with mood disorders remains low, ranging 
from 30% to 70% for antidepressants and 
from 18% to 52% for mood stabilisers.10 11 
Antidepressant treatment costs represent an 
additional mental health burden in Canada, 
having ballooned from $31.4 million in 198112 
to an estimated $1.2 billion in 2005.13 These 
figures suggest that more effective treatment 
options are  needed urgently for the manage-
ment of mood disorders.
Aerobic exercise as a possible therapeutic 
intervention for complex mood disorders 
is supported by several lines of evidence. 
In animal models, as depressive symp-
toms increase, physical function decreases; 
conversely, decreased physical function is 
associated with increased depressive-like 
behaviour.14 In humans, some studies have 
reported a positive improvement in depres-
sive symptoms after the adoption of exercise 
across youth15 and adults16–19 with MDD; other 
studies have reported no significant effects 
in MDD symptoms compared with non-exer-
cising20 or placebo (stretching)21 groups. A

recent meta-analysis of 15 randomised trials evaluating 
the effect of exercise on MDD found a significant effect of 
exercise across a variety of measures of depression, with 
a mean effect size of 0.77 for all studies and of 0.43 for 
studies that met higher methodological criteria.22 Meth-
odological variability may partly underlie the discrepancy 
of results, including exercise duration and type (aerobic 
vs non-aerobic) and level of social interaction (e.g., 
minimal,21 23 supervised16 19 21 23 or group-based).15 24 25 
Critically, there also remains little information about the 
potential therapeutic benefits of exercise on complex 
mood disorders, including those that are treatment resis-
tant, as most randomised controlled trials exclude 
individuals with previous poor treatment response.16 23 26 
Moreover, studies that have included participants with 
treatment-resistant mood disorders did not evaluate 
the impact of clinical history (e.g., illness duration and 
comorbid diagnoses) on treatment response.18 27
To address the above gaps in the literature, we inves-
tigated the impact of exercise in youth and adults with 
complex clinical histories and treatment-resistant mood 
disorders, as these patients are rarely included in clinical 
trials. Since April 2012, a multidisciplinary clinical team 
in the Mood Disorders Program, St Joseph’s Healthcare 
Hamilton (Hamilton, Ontario) has offered a 12-week 
group-based recreational running programme aimed at 
enhancing clinical outcomes in youth and adults with 
mood and anxiety disorders. As part of the programme 
evaluation, the team collected weekly self-report measures 
of stress, anxiety and depression and perceived social 
support, which provided an opportunity to evaluate the 
impact of running in youth and adults in a sample that 
included complex mood disorders. The primary goal 
of the current study was to assess the impact of a struc-
tured aerobic exercise programme on measures of stress, 
anxiety and depression over 12 weeks in youth and adults 
with complex mood disorder histories. The secondary 
objectives were to explore the impact of demographic 
and clinical factors including: (1) participant age; (2) 
attendance; (3) clinical history; and (4) perceived social 
support on outcome measures of stress, anxiety and 
depression.
MeThOds
The current study is a retrospective chart review analysing 
data that were collected as part of the ongoing evaluation 
of the Team Unbreakable running group programme. 
Data were available for participants from August 2012 to 
July 2015, which spanned 11 running group sessions (see 
table 1).
Participants
Participants were 46 running group members at St 
Joseph Healthcare Hamilton’s Mood Disorders Program, 
organised as part of a novel treatment programme for 
clients with mood disorders in the Hamilton commu-
nity. Participants were allocated to a youth (n=29; 16–25 
years) or adult (n=17; >25 years) group based on their 
age. Recruitment methods included flyers in and around 
the hospital and distributing information to local clinics. 
Referral criteria included: history of BD, MDD or anxiety 
disorder, including those not in full remission and/or 
with comorbid diagnoses, and the ability to participate in 
a 12-week running programme, confirmed by the Phys-
ical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q & You).28 
The primary clinical diagnosis of mood disorder was 
confirmed from review of the patient medical record. A 
total of 10 participants were excluded from the analyses 
due to missing diagnostic information in the medical 
chart (n=8) and the absence of a primary diagnosis of a 
mood disorder (n=2; one had general anxiety disorder 
and one had schizoaffective disorder).
Clinical assessments
Beck Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II; Psych-
Corp)29: a 21-item self-report questionnaire used to assess 
depressive symptoms.
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; PsychCorp)30: a 21-item 
self-report questionnaire used to assess symptoms of 
anxiety.
Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)31: a 10-item 
self-report questionnaire measuring the degree to which 
situations are perceived as stressful.
36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)32 33: a 36-item 
self-report assessment that measures health-related 
quality of life. The survey generates a score that can be 
subdivided into eight subscales: limitations in physical 
activities, limitations in social activities due to physical 
health, limitations in usual activities due to physical 
health, bodily pain, general mental health, limitations in 
usual activities due to emotional problems, vitality and 
general health perceptions.
Running log assessments 
Before and after every run, participants rated their mood, 
energy level, enthusiasm, stress and feelings of friendship 
with other group members on a scale of 0–10. This survey

included a question asking participants to rate their level 
of connection with the group, which provided an esti-
mate of perceived social support.
Running protocol
Participants met twice per week and progressed from 
mostly walking to mostly running. In the 13th week, 
participants completed a local 5 km run as a group. 
Weekly sessions included motivational talks across a 
range of topics such as mental illness, running strategies, 
nutrition and mindfulness. The sessions also provided an 
opportunity for participants to interact with each other, 
the clinical leads (recreation therapist (JW) and social 
worker (KM)), and volunteers comprised of hospital 
staff, faculty and graduate students. The programme 
was flexible to meet the needs of the participants but 
started out as a 1-km session of 30 s running and 2 min 
walking. Each week, the participants went a little farther 
and increased the time spent running by 30–60 s. The 
goal was to work up to mostly running for 5 km by week 
12.
statistical analyses
The primary objective was evaluated using: (1) a mixed-
model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
to evaluate BDI, BAI and PSS score changes over time 
and (2) assessment of remission and response of BDI 
scores. Due to variable attendance of participants, there 
were large amounts of missing data at random time 
points, resulting in varying sample sizes across analyses. A 
mixed-model approach was chosen as it is more effective 
at handling missing data than the general linear model,34 
provided the time points of the missing data are random,35 
and does not assume that repeated observations over time 
are independent.34 Remission and response were defined 
as follows: total BDI <12 to define remission of depressive 
symptoms and a decrease of 50% from baseline to end 
of study in BDI score to define response.36 The Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel χ2 was used to assess movement across 
the BDI ranges (absent, low, moderate and high) from 
baseline to end of study.37
Secondary objectives were assessed using autoregres-
sion analyses to identify predictors of BDI, BAI and PSS 
score changes over time. Factors assessed included age, 
gender, attendance, age of illness diagnosis (the age the 
participant first received counselling or medication), 
comorbid diagnoses and perceived social support. Clin-
ical history was obtained through medical record review. 
We explored the impact of perceived social support using 
the responses to the question ‘Level of friendship with 
other group members’, which the participants scored on 
a scale of 1–10 in the Running Log tool. The Running 
Log social support question was validated by comparing 
results with the social subscale of the SF-36, which was 
available for a subset of participants. Finally, we evalu-
ated single item responses of the BDI and the BAI using 
the mixed-models method to investigate the effect of the 
running therapy programme on single items of possible 
clinical significance. All analyses were performed using 
SAS V.9.4 for Windows.
resulTs
There were fewer male (11; 23.9%) than female (35; 
76.1%) participants; χ2=12.5, df=1, p=0.0004. The average 
(±SD) age of the adult group was 45.2 (±12.9) years, and 
the average age of the youth group was 22.1 (±5.8) years. 
All patients had a primary diagnosis of a mood disorder. 
Clinical and demographic data were available for 46 
participants and are summarised in table 1. The primary 
diagnoses for the current sample were major depressive 
disorder (n=29), BD (n=13), major depressive disorder 
and dysthymia (n=3) and dysthymia (n=1). In addition, 
10 participants had current suicidal ideation, 6 had a 
history of psychotic symptoms and 25 of the participants 
had one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.
Mixed-model repeated measures analysis: depression, 
anxiety and stress scales over time
A mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA of BDI scores 
revealed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms 
from baseline to end of study (F=4.5, df=11, 201, p<0001), 
observable for the youth (F=2.1, df 11, 118, p=0.02) and 
adult groups (F=4.3, df 11, 72; p<0.0001). Results were 
similar for BAI (F=4.8, df=11, 186, p<0.0001) and PSS 
(F=2.3, df=11, 186, p=0.01) scores; results held when 
adults and youth were analysed separately (see figure 1).
Remission: BDI scores were categorised by levels of 
depression as absent (<12); low (13–19); moderate 
(20–28) and high (>29).29 BAI scores were classified 
as absent (≤9), low (10–18), moderate (19–29) and 
high (≥30).38 From baseline to end of running session, 
there was a decline in the number of participants with 
moderate or severe BDI scores, with corresponding 
increases of participants in the low and absent categories. 
A similar pattern of results was identified for BAI scores 
(see table 2).
response to treatment
In adults, baseline compared with end of study BDI scores 
were 30.8 (±14.5; range 10–58; sample size n=12) versus 
18.8 (±12.6; range 11–41; sample size n=5), an overall 
decrease of approximately 39%. In youth, baseline 
compared with end-of-study BDI scores were 26.9 (±13.0; 
range 2–48; sample size n=23) versus 19.5 (±15.5; range 
0–59; sample size n=15), an approximately 27% decrease. 
Nineteen participants had both baseline and end-of-study 
data available; of these, five participants (26.3%) showed 
a decrease of 50% or more in their post-BDI score.
secondary objectives
Autoregression analyses were used to explore the impact 
of participant age, age at diagnosis, number of comorbid 
diagnoses and perceived social support (level of friend-
ship with the group) on stress, anxiety and depression. 
Perceived social support was estimated by the postrun-
ning ‘Level of friendship’ item in the Running Log. In

order to validate this variable, we assessed the correlation 
between the end-of-study postrunning level of friendship 
score and relevant subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire 
available for a subset of participants (n=18) and identified 
correlations between level of friendship and SF-36 mental 
health subscales of social func tioning (r=0.41, p=0.001), 
role of emotions in functioning (r=0.37, p=0.003), vitality 
(r=0.45, p=0.0002) and mental health (r=0.46, p=0.0002). 
Perceived level of friendship with the group after running 
was predictive of BDI (t=−4.0 p<0.0001), PSS (t=−2.1, 
p=0.04) and BAI scores (t=−3.6, p=0.0003), where higher 
levels of perceived friendship were associated with lower 
scores on all measures from week 1 to week 12. Atten-
dance was also a significant predictor of mood scores, 
where higher attendance predicted lower BDI (t=−2.5 
p=0.01) and BAI (−3.4, p=0.007) scores, with a trend 
for lower stress scores (t=−1.7, p=0.084). Age at onset of 
illness significantly predicted BDI (t=9.4, p<0.0001), BAI 
(t=6.2, p<0.0001) and PSS (t=6.3, p<0.0001) scores; an 
earlier age of illness onset was associated with decreased 
depression, anxiety and stress scores from baseline 
to end of study. Age was a significant predictor of BDI 
(t=5.9, p<0.0001), BAI (t=3.3, p=0.001) and PSS (t=6.6, 
p<0.0001) scores; younger age was associated with lower 
mood scores over time.
Programme compliance
The attendance rate was 49.2% (±27.5); not signifi-
cantly higher for adults (55.0% (±24.6)) compared with 
youth (44.8% (±28.6); t=1,2, df=44; p=0.2). We split the 
group into high (attended more than 50% of running 
sessions, n=23) and low (attended 50% or less running 
sessions, n=23) attenders and observed a non-signifi-
cant difference in end-of-programme BDI scores, with 
those that attended more frequently having lower scores 
(16.2±14.7) compared with those that attended less 
frequently (28.8±9.7; t=−1.8, df=23, p=0.092). However, 
as illustrated in figure 2, this result may be influenced by 
high variability of the low attendance group.
Additional analyses for this study can be reviewed in 
the online supplementary data.
disCussiOn
The results from the present study suggest that adults 
and youth with complex mood disorders can benefit 
from a running therapy programme that is supervised 
by clinical professionals in a group setting that offers 
social support. Interventions such as exercise are being 
promoted as having therapeutic benefits to youth and 
adults with mood disorders.22 However, most research

the impact of exercise in terms of clinical outcomes, 
nor is there research on exercise type, intensity, the 
role of social support and/or the impact of exercise on 
functional outcomes.40 In the current study, we found 
engagement in a group running programme improved 
mood symptoms including depression, anxiety and 
stress in participants with complex mood disorders, 
over a period of 12 weeks. This finding held for both

time. Multiple subitems within the depression inventory 
also improved over time, including energy, irritability,

self-worth and pessimism (refer to online supplemen-
tary data). These findings are consistent with previous 
reports of increased energy and self-esteem levels in 
adults,22 even after as little as one running session.41 
Improved mood scores were predicted by younger 
age, earlier age at onset of mood disorder, as well as 
higher attendance to the running programme. We 
also observed a positive impact of the running therapy 
programme on perceived social support, as reflected by 
the relationship between increased feelings of friend-
ship and decreased mood scores, suggesting that the 
opportunity to connect with peers through the running 
group may positively impact mood outcomes. Given 
that social dysfunction is a core symptom of mood 
disorders, the perceived social support in a structured 
running programme may help improve psychosocial 
outcomes in this population.42
There is abundant research on the positive impact 
of aerobic15 16 18 21 25 and non-aerobic (stretching and 
yoga)16 27 43 exercise on symptoms of depression, and 
results have been shown across varying methodologies, 
samples, exercise programme and assessment strat-
egies. However, most studies exclude complex and/
or treatment-resistant populations and do not investi-
gate the impact of other contributing factors such as 
programme adherence or perceived social support in 
group or supervised settings. Accordingly, there are 
knowledge gaps on exercise as a potential therapeutic 
option for individuals with mood disorders, especially 
complex forms with comorbid diagnoses and poor 
response to treatment.
Although the results reported here are encouraging, 
they should be considered a starting point for further 
investigation. The large amounts of missing data were 
a limiting factor for data analyses and interpretation 
of results. The social support finding, although inter-
esting, was based on an informal tool. Therefore, 
further research is warranted, using validated ques-
tionnaires, to explore the role of perceived social 
support in structured exercise programme. It is note-
worthy that, despite methodological limitations, we 
identified several positive findings that could result in 
short-term and long-term clinical and functional bene-
fits to patients with complex mood disorders. As such, 
the findings reported here should be a starting point 
for future randomised control trials designed to better 
understand the potential therapeutic benefits of exer-
cise across the spectrum of mood disorder diagnoses 
symptoms.
In spite of limited data on clinically relevant variables 
such as age at onset of illness and comorbid diagnoses, 
these results also suggest that clinical history may influ-
ence outcomes of running for youth and adults with 
complex mood disorders. Somewhat counterintuitively, 
we found that both earlier age at onset of illness as well 
as younger age were associated with lower BDI scores 
over time. It is possible that the adult group represents 
a more treatment-resistant form of mood disorder in 
the current study; future research is recommended to 
further explore this finding.
COnClusiOns
In a sample of youth and adults with complex mood 
disorders, we demonstrated a positive impact of aerobic 
exercise on symptoms of depression in a supportive group 
setting over a 3-month period. The results indicate a need 
for future research of the long-term effects of aerobic 
exercise in youth and adults with chronic, recurrent and/
or treatment-resistant mood disorders to better under-
stand possible therapeutic effects of a structured exercise 
programme. Moreover, the impact of clinical factors such 
as age at onset of mood disorder, duration of illness and 
comorbid diagnoses as well as perceived social support 
should be explored to determine how these factors 
impact outcomes. Future randomised trials are warranted 
to identify when exercise may be useful as a therapeutic 
option for patients with chronic and/or treatment-resis-
tant mood disorders, and what clinical and improvements 
can reasonably be expected in this population.
