Integrated genomic characterization of 
oesophageal carcinoma

*Lists of participants and their affiliations appear in the online version of the paper.  
Fresh-frozen tumour samples from patients who were not previ-
ously treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy were obtained 
from multiple countries with informed consent and local Institutional 
Review Board approval. Germline DNA was collected from blood or 
nonmalignant oesophageal mucosa. Genetic material was subjected 
to whole-exome sequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
array profiling to evaluate somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs), 
DNA methylation profiling and mRNA and microRNA sequencing. 
DNA from 51 oesophageal cancers was subjected to low-pass (6–8× 
 
coverage) whole-genome sequencing. Reverse-phase protein array pro-
teomic analysis was performed on 113 tumours.
Molecular separation of ESCC and EAC
We evaluated the 164 oesophageal carcinomas using integrated clus-
tering of SCNA, DNA methylation, mRNA and microRNA expres-
sion data using iCluster10. Both independent and integrated analyses 
from each molecular platform revealed separation between squamous 
 
cancers and adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 1 a–e). Gene 
expression analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2) revealed that EACs showed 
increased E-cadherin (CDH1) signalling and upregulation of ARF6 
and FOXA pathways, which regulate E-cadherin11. By contrast, ESCCs 
exhibited upregulation of Wnt, syndecan and p63 pathways, the latter 
being essential for squamous epithelial cell differentiation12. These data 
suggest the presence of lineage-specific alterations that drive progres-
sion in EACs and ESCCs.
Somatic genomic alterations in oesophageal cancer
We evaluated somatic genomic alterations separately in ESCC and 
EAC using MutSig13 to search for genes with significantly recurring 
mutations (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). In ESCC, we identified signifi-
cantly mutated genes, TP53, NFE2L2, MLL2, ZNF750, NOTCH1 and 
TGFBR2, consistent with previous studies14–20. In EAC, we identi-
fied significant mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, ARID1A, SMAD4 and 
ERBB2, as reported previously21. These findings are consistent with the 
prominence of CDKN2A and TP53 mutations in dysplastic Barrett’s 
oesophagus, a precursor to EAC. Similarly, we analysed SCNA data 
Oesophageal cancers have 5-year survival rates of 12–20% in Western 
populations1,2 and cause the deaths of over 400,000 people worldwide 
annually3. Oesophageal cancer is classified by histology as adenocarci-
noma (EAC) or squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)4. EAC incidence has 
increased several fold in Western countries in recent decades5, occurs 
predominantly in the lower oesophagus near the gastric junction, and 
is associated with obesity, gastric reflux and a precursor state termed 
Barrett’s oesophagus. Rising EAC rates are paralleled by increasing 
incidences of proximal stomach cancer6. ESCCs predominate in the 
upper and mid-oesophagus and are associated with smoking and alco-
hol exposure in Western populations. In non-Western countries, risk 
factors for ESCCs are less established.
The appropriate demarcation between gastric and oesophageal 
adeno 
carcinomas and the classification of adenocarcinomas spanning 
the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) remain unresolved7–9, and there 
is debate regarding the utility of histological distinctions4. To improve 
oesophageal cancer classification, we performed a comprehensive 
 
molecular analysis of 164 oesophageal tumours, 359 gastric adeno-
carcinomas and 36 additional adenocarcinomas at the GEJ. We evaluated 
 
approaches for categorizing oesophageal tumours and identified mole-
cular features and candidate pathways that define molecular subgroups 
and offer potential therapeutic targets.
Sample collection and molecular characterization
We addressed the challenge of clinically distinguishing oesophageal and 
gastric adenocarcinomas through review of adenocarcinomas originat-
ing near the GEJ, using anatomic data and histopathologic criteria, to 
categorize tumours by oesophageal, gastric or indeterminate origins 
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1.1). We iden-
tified 90 ESCCs, 72 EACs (61 definite oesophageal and 11 probable 
oesophageal), 36 GEJ carcinomas of indeterminate origin, 63 gastric 
GEJ carcinomas (15 definite gastric and 48 probable gastric), 140 gas-
tric carcinomas of the fundus or body, and 143 gastric antral or pyloric 
carcinomas. We were unable to localize 13 gastric adenocarcinomas 
more narrowly within the stomach, and 2 oesophageal tumours were 
undifferentiated carcinomas.
Oesophageal cancers are prominent worldwide; however, there are few targeted therapies and survival rates for these 
cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus 
derived from Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic distinctions, 
molecular features differentiated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. 
Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas resembled squamous carcinomas of other organs more than they did oesophageal 
adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but none 
showed evidence for an aetiological role of human papillomavirus. Squamous cell carcinomas showed frequent genomic 
amplifications of CCND1 and SOX2 and/or TP63, whereas ERBB2, VEGFA and GATA4 and GATA6 were more commonly 
amplified in adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant 
of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a single disease entity. However, some 
molecular features, including DNA hypermethylation, occurred disproportionally in oesophageal adenocarcinomas. These 
data provide a framework to facilitate more rational categorization of these tumours and a foundation for new therapies.

with GISTIC22 to define recurrently amplified and deleted regions 
(Extended Data Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 2). Although EAC and 
ESCC shared some recurring SCNAs, we confirmed substantial differ-
ences in patterns of alterations between the diseases19,23. SCNAs that 
were recurrent in EAC (but absent in ESCC) included amplifications 
containing VEGFA (6p21.1), ERBB2 (17p12), GATA6 (18q11.2) and 
CCNE1 (19q12), and deletion of SMAD4 (18q21.2). Recurring focal 
SCNAs in ESCC included amplifications of SOX2 (3q26.33), TERT 
(5p15.33), FGFR1 (8p11.23), MDM2 (12q14.3), NKX2-1 (14q13.2) and 
deletion of RB1 (13q14.2). We found novel focal deletions at 3p25.2 
in ESCC, encompassing the negative regulator of the Hippo pathway 
VGLL4 and autophagy factor ATG7.
Combined mutation and SCNA data revealed frequent alterations 
in cell cycle regulators (Fig. 2). Inactivation of CDKN2A and amplifi-
cation of CCND1 were present in 76% and 57% of squamous tumours, 
respectively; and additional ESCCs had amplification of CDK6 or loss 
of RB1. Patterns of cell-cycle dysregulation differed in EACs, where 
CCND1 was amplified in only 15% of tumours, but we observed more 
common amplification of CCNE1. CDKN2A was inactivated in 76% of 
EACs by mutation, deletion or epigenetic silencing. These data reveal a 
potential role for inhibitors of cell cycle kinases for treatment, especially 
 
in ESCC.
We found frequent alterations of receptor tyrosine kinases and 
downstream signalling mediators, particularly in EAC. In ESCCs, 
we identified amplification or mutation of EGFR in 19% of tumours 
and alterations of PIK3CA, PTEN or PIK3R1, all of which are believed 
to activate the PI3K pathway, in 24% of tumours. EACs had a wider 
range of potentially oncogenic amplifications, most commonly of 
ERBB2, which was altered in 32% of EACs, but in only 3% of ESCCs. 
Although clinical trials that led to approval by the US Food and Drug 
Administration of the ERBB2-directed antibody trastuzumab were 
limited to gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas24, ERBB2-positive EACs 
are routinely treated off-label with trastuzumab. Notably, we found 
mutations of ERBB2 in four tumours lacking ERBB2 amplification, 
suggesting that more patients may benefit from ERBB2-directed ther-
apy. Transcriptome data identified six cases with ERBB2 amplification 
that expressed a fusion transcript in which exon 12 of ERBB2 was fused 
to the 3′ untranslated region of neighbouring gene JUP (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 3.1; Supplementary Table 3). Because this fusion transcript omits 
the ERBB2 transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains, its potential 
functionality is unclear. Other EACs showed amplification of KRAS, 
EGFR, IGF1R or VEGFA.
Additional analysis identified dysregulation of the TGF-β pathway 
and less frequent CTNNB1 (β-catenin) activation, both more common 
in EAC than ESCC. We found that 6% of ESCCs (but no EACs) had 
inactivating alterations of PTCH1, as previously described15, suggesting 
activated hedgehog signalling. ESCC tumours, like other squamous 
cancers, had amplifications of chromosome 3q, focused on the SOX2 
locus25. Genes that encode SOX2 or squamous transcription factor p63, 
also on chromosome 3p, were amplified in 48% of ESCCs. Moreover, 
mutations in ZNF750 and NOTCH1 in ESCCs may similarly modulate 
squamous cell maturation15–20. In EACs, however, we found frequent 
amplifications of genes that encode GATA4 and GATA6 developmental 
factors, as described in gastric adenocarcinomas26,27 and (for GATA6), 
experimentally validated in EAC28.
Both EAC and ESCCs showed alterations of chromatin-modifying 
enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 3.2). Alterations affecting SWI/SNF-
encoding genes ARID1A, SMARCA4 and PBRM1 were more common 
in adenocarcinomas, whereas ESCCs contained more frequent altera-
tions in histone-modifying factors KDM6A (UTX), KMT2D (MLL2) 
and KMT2C (MLL3). Therefore, although many of the same path-
ways were somatically altered in EACs and ESCCs, the specific genes 
affected were dissimilar, probably reflecting distinct pathophysiology 
and suggesting different therapeutic approaches. These data caution 
against performing clinical trials in mixed populations of EACs and 
ESCCs.
Molecular subtypes of oesophageal SCC
Integrative clustering of ESCC data using iCluster revealed two classes, 
denoted iCluster 1 and iCluster 2 (Fig. 3a). Within iCluster 2, we iden-
tified a group of tumours with shared features including mutations 
in SMARCA4 (encoding the SWI/SNF factor BRG1), increased DNA 
methylation (Fig. 3a, rightmost samples) and relatively unaltered SCNA 
profiles (Fig. 3b). We designated the distinct set of tumours with these 
features as subtype ESCC3, thus dividing ESCCs into three molecular 
subtypes: ESCC1 (n = 50), ESCC2 (n = 36) and ESCC3 (n = 4).
ESCC1 was characterized by alterations in the NRF2 pathway, which 
regulates adaptation to oxidative stressors including some carcinogens 
and some chemotherapy agents. Mutations in NFE2L2 (NRF2), are 
associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemoradiotherapy29. 
 
Alterations were seen in NFE2L2, in genes encoding proteins 
 
that degrade NRF2 (KEAP1 and CUL3), and in ATG7, encoding an 
NRF2 pathway autophagy factor30,31 (Fig. 3c). ESCC1 had a higher 
frequency of SOX2 and/or TP63 amplification (Fig. 3c, Extended 
Data Fig. 5). ESCC1 gene expression resembled the classical subtype 
described in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies of lung SCC32 
and head and neck SCC (HNSCC)33 (Extended Data Fig. 6), which 
possess similar somatic alterations. ESCC1 showed higher rates of

YAP1 (11q22.1) amplification and VGLL4/ATG7 deletion, suggesting 
activation of Hippo.
ESCC2 showed higher rates of mutation of NOTCH1 or ZNF750 
(Extended Data Fig. 5), more frequent inactivating alterations of 
KDM6A and KDM2D, CDK6 amplification, and inactivation of 
PTEN or PIK3R1. We found greater leukocyte infiltration of ESCC2 
tumours and higher levels of cleaved Caspase-7 protein (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 7), the latter implying enhanced potential for XIAP-directed 
agents to facilitate apoptosis34. The gene with the lowest P value for the 
methylation difference between ESCC1 and ESCC2 was the immuno-
modulatory molecule BST2 (ref. 35) (P = 3 × 10−4, Fisher’s exact test; 
Supplementary Table 4), which showed less methylation and higher 
expression in ESCC2 (Extended Data Fig. 7), suggesting potential for 
BST2 inhibition.
ESCC3 tumours showed no evidence for genetic deregulation of the 
cell cycle and had TP53 mutations in only one of four samples. All 
samples in ESCC3, however, sustained alterations predicted to activate 
 
the PI3K pathway (Extended Data Fig. 5), and three of four possessed 
somatic alterations of KMT2D/MLL2 in addition to SMARCA4. 
Analysis of the TCGA HNSCC data set revealed no tumours with 
 
profiles analogous to ESCC3, suggesting this class of squamous 
tumours may be confined to ESCC.
ESCC subtypes showed trends for geographic associations: tumours 
from Vietnamese patients, the only Asian population studied, tended to 
be ESCC1 (27 out of 41 = 66%; P = 0.09, Fisher’s exact test), and more 
tumours derived from Eastern European and South American patients 
were ESCC2 (P = 0.118, Fisher’s exact test). All four ESCC3 tumours 
were derived from patients from the USA and Canada (P = 0.001, 
Fisher’s exact test). Tumours from Vietnamese patients were enriched 
in NFE2L2 mutations (Fig. 3c); 24% in the Vietnamese cohort (10 out 
of 41) versus 6% in other patients (3 out of 49; P = 0.017, Fisher’s exact 
test). This association of NFE2L2 mutations with Vietnamese patients 
suggests a common oxidative stressor or genetic predisposition. 
Patients from East Asia have common variants in alcohol-metabolism 
genes ALDH2 and ADH1B36, which are associated with ESCC risk36, 
but we could not investigate their association with NFE2L2 mutations 
as all Vietnamese patients had such variants (Supplementary Fig. 3.3).
In comparison to EAC, ESCCs showed enrichment of C>A substitu-
tions and APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic 
polypeptide-like) signatures (P = 7 × 10−7 and 5 × 10−5, respectively, 
by Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The C>A mutational signature is associ-
ated with smoking and chewing tobacco37, but did not correlate with 
ESCC subgroups or clinical variables in our sample set. However, when 
we restricted the analysis to lifelong nonsmokers, the C>A signature 
was significantly higher in our Vietnamese population (P = 0.013, 
Wilcoxon), suggesting a role for tobacco chewing. The APOBEC 
signature was overrepresented in ESCC2 (Fig. 3d, P = 0.03, Kruskal–
Wallis test) and enriched in patients from Ukraine and Russia (P = 0.01, 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test). ESCC tumours lacked the predilection for 
A>C transversions at AA dinucleotides seen in EAC (Supplementary 
Table 5).
We evaluated whether the human papilloma virus (HPV), which 
has a pathogenic role in cervical SCC and HNSCC, also contributes to 
ESCC, as has been reported38. Comparison of ESCC mRNA sequencing 
data to TCGA HNSCC data found that ESCC HPV transcript levels 
resembled HPV-negative HNSCC tumours (Fig. 3e). These data do not 
support an aetiologic role for HPV in ESCC.
EAC in relation to gastric cancer
Given the uncertainty regarding appropriate demarcations of EAC 
relative to both gastric cancer and ESCC, we analysed both EAC and 
ESCC relative to the cancer types that occur nearest to the oesopha-
gus, HNSCC and gastric adenocarcinoma. Analysis of mRNA expres-
sion, DNA methylation and SCNA data demonstrated that ESCC had 
a stronger resemblance to HNSCC than to EAC (Fig. 4a). Similarly, 
EACs more closely resembled gastric cancer than they did ESCC. In 
our previous TCGA study27, we classified gastric tumours into four 
subtypes on the basis of having (1) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infec-
tion, (2) microsatellite instability (MSI), (3) chromosomal instability 
(CIN) and (4) genomic stability (GS), a group largely comprised of the 
diffuse histologic type. When we evaluated EACs jointly with gastric 
cancers, we observed that EACs and CIN gastric cancers jointly formed 
a group distinct from EBV
, MSI or GS tumours (Extended Data Fig. 8). 
Evaluating all gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEAs), we found 
increasing prevalence of CIN moving proximally with 71 of 72 EACs 
classified as CIN (Fig. 4b). No EACs were positive for MSI or EBV. 
 
However, among GEJ adenocarcinomas that were not clearly of oesopha-
geal origin, we identified MSI-positive and EBV-positive tumours.

The enrichment of CIN in EAC suggested that comparisons of EAC 
with gastric cancers would be confounded by non-CIN tumours nearly 
exclusively in the stomach. We therefore sought to find features that 
could differentiate EAC from CIN gastric cancers by analysis of the 
288 CIN GEAs (GEA-CIN; Fig. 1a). We found clear similarity between 
chromosomal aberrations in gastric CIN tumours and EAC (Fig. 4c), 
with stronger similarity between EAC and CIN gastric cancers than 
between those of EAC and ESCC. Clustering of GEA-CIN data from 
individual platforms (Extended Data Fig. 9) and by integrative cluster-
ing revealed no consistent separation of EACs and CIN gastric cancers, 
thus arguing against classifying these as distinct diseases (Extended 
Data Fig. 10). As misannotation of tumours near the GEJ could enhance 
the apparent similarity of EACs and CIN gastric tumours, we repeated 
our analysis after excluding equivocal GEJ cases, but saw no definitive 
separation of EAC and CIN gastric adenocarcinomas (Supplementary 
Fig. 7.1).
However, clustering of DNA methylation data revealed a progres-
sion of DNA methylation features from proximal to distal GEA-CIN 
tumours (Fig. 5a). Samples in cluster 1, those with the most frequent 
 
hypermethylation, were enriched in the oesophagus or proximal 
stomach/GEJ (Fig. 5b). The proportion of cancers showing more 
 
frequent DNA hypermethylation (that is, clusters 1 or 2) was signifi-
cantly higher among EACs than among gastric CIN cancers (70% versus 
 
30%, respectively; P = 1.0 × 10−8, Fisher’s exact test). By contrast, 
cluster 4, with the lowest rates of hypermethylation, included more 
distal stomach cancers (Fig. 5b). Unlike hypermethylated gastric CpG 
island methylator phenotype tumours, no GEA-CIN tumours exhi-
bited epigenetic silencing of MLH1, consistent with their MSI-negative 
status, but they showed a higher propensity for epigenetic silencing of 
CDKN2A, (Supplementary Table 6, Fig. 5c). Additional genes silenced 
in cluster 1 included MGMT and CHFR, for which methylation has 
been associated with responses to alkylating agents and microtubule 
inhibitors, respectively39,40.
We evaluated the GEA-CIN tumours for somatic features that 
could differentiate EACs from gastric CIN tumours (Fig. 5c). EACs 
had higher rates of mutation of SMARCA4 and deletion of tumour 
suppressor RUNX1, but lower APC mutation rates relative to gastric 
tumours, suggesting a less prominent role for Wnt/β-catenin in EAC. 
Copy-number analysis revealed higher rates of deletions of putative 
fragile site genes FHIT or WWOX, suggestive of differences in the 
underlying genomic instability between distal and proximal GEA-
CIN tumours. Analysis of oncogenes identified subtle distinctions, 
with VEGFA and MYC amplifications being more common in EACs. 
Although additional samples will be required to refine understanding 
of the progressive gradations of features from the distal stomach to 
the oesophagus, these data indicate that gastric and oesophageal CIN 
tumours lack absolute dichotomizing features and do not appear to be 
distinct tumour types.
Discussion
These analyses call into question the premise of envisioning oesoph-
ageal carcinoma as a single entity. These molecular data show that 
histo 
logical subtypes of EAC and ESCC are distinct in their molecular 
charac 
teristics across all platforms tested. ESCC emerges as a disease 
more reminiscent of other SCCs than of EAC, which itself bears striking 
 
resemblance to CIN gastric cancer. Our analyses therefore argue against 
approaches that combine EAC and ESCC for clinical trials of neoadju-
vant, adjuvant or systemic therapies (Supplementary Fig. 3.4).
These data also inform longstanding debates regarding appropriate 
demarcations of EAC from gastric cancer. We found that GEAs show a 
progressive gradation of subtypes (Fig. 6), with increasing prevalence 
of the CIN phenotype proximally, to the point that EACs appear to 
represent a disease of chromosomal instability. This CIN gradient is 
analogous to colorectal carcinomas, whereby CIN prevalence increases 
distally towards the rectum41. EAC has been considered separate from 
gastric cancer according to a model whereby EAC originates from 
Barrett’s oesophagus and thus is not of gastric origin. Although the 
origin of Barrett’s oesophagus remains controversial, recent mouse 
models suggest that Barrett’s oesophagus and EAC might originate 
from proximal gastric cells or embryonic remnant cell populations at 
the GEJ42,43. The notable molecular similarity between EACs and CIN 
gastric cancers provides indirect support for gastric origin of Barrett’s 
oesophagus and EAC and indicates that we may view GEA as a singu-
lar entity, analogously to colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, these 
similarities between EAC and CIN gastric cancers do not indicate 
that all CIN GEAs are indistinguishable. Indeed, differences in more 
proximal GEAs should be expected, given their distinct epidemiol-
ogy, rapid increase in Western countries, and inverse association with 
Helicobacter pylori. Continued exploration of the molecular charac-
teristics of EAC might not absolutely differentiate them from CIN

METHODS
Data reporting. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. 
The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to 
allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Specimen collection and staging. Tissue source sites (TSS) are listed in 
Supplementary Information S1.1. Oesophageal tumours were collected and 
shipped to a central Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) between 1 December 2011 
and 23 December 2013. Samples were obtained from patients who had received 
no previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for their disease. Each frozen primary 
tumour specimen had a companion normal tissue specimen (blood or blood com-
ponents, including DNA extracted at the TSS). Adjacent nontumourous oesopha-
geal tissue was also submitted for a subset of patients.
Cases were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th 
edition staging system44. Pathology quality control was performed on each tumour 
and adjacent normal tissue specimen (if available) from a frozen section slide to 
confirm that the tumour specimen was histologically consistent with oesophageal 
cancer and that the adjacent tissue specimen contained no tumour cells. Tumour 
samples with ≥ 60% tumour nuclei and ≤ 20% necrosis were submitted for nucleic 
acid extraction.
Nucleic acid processing and qualification. DNA and RNA were co-isolated, and 
quality was assessed at the central BCR as described previously (supplementary 
S1.1 in ref. 27). A custom Sequenom SNP panel or the AmpFISTR Identifiler 
(Applied Biosystems) was used to verify that tumour DNA and germline DNA 
representing a case were derived from the same patient. RNA was analysed through 
the RNA6000 Nano assay (Agilent) to determine an RNA Integrity Number, and 
only analytes with an integrity number ≥ 
7.0 were included. Only cases yielding a 
minimum of 6.9 μg of tumour DNA, 5.15 μg of RNA and 4.9 μg of germline DNA 
were included.
The BCR received tumour samples with germline controls from a total of 322 
oesophageal cancer cases, of which 185 qualified, on the basis of BCR pathology 
review and molecular characteristics. Distribution and quality control of cases is 
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.1. Of the 185 cases that qualified, 171 cases were 
used for genomic analysis, as 14 cases were excluded after independent pathology 
review (described in ‘Expert pathology review’
, below) or discovery of clinical or 
molecular disqualifiers.
Of the 171 qualifying cases, matched nontumourous oesophageal tissue was 
available for 58 cases. Samples with residual tumour tissue after extraction of 
nucleic acids were considered for proteomics analysis. When available, a 10- to 
20-mg piece of snap-frozen tumour adjacent to the piece used for molecular 
sequencing and characterization was submitted for reverse-phase protein array 
analysis. We compared these 171 oesophageal adenocarcinomas to 388 similarly 
characterized gastric adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Fig. 1.1).
Microsatellite instability assay. Microsatellite instability (MSI) in qualified 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma tumour-derived DNA samples was evaluated by 
the BCR at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA. MSI-mono-
dinucleotide assay was performed to test a panel of four mononucleotide repeat 
loci (polyadenine tracts BAT25, BAT26, BAT40 and transforming growth factor 
receptor type II) and three dinucleotide repeat loci (CA repeats in D2S123, D5S346 
and D17S250) as previously described27.
Expert pathology review. All cancers included in this study were secondarily 
reviewed by an Expert Pathologists’ Committee that consisted of seven experi-
enced gastrointestinal pathologists (R.O., S.McC., Z.Z., J.K., L.T., M.B.P. and J.W.). 
A centralized virtual pathology review system was constructed using an Aperio 
slide scanner housed at the BCR at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Typically, two 
frozen sections flanking the tumour tissue from which all material was extracted 
for this study and one additional high-quality formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
tissue section were scanned and reviewed. Two committee members reviewed all 
cases before inclusion into the study. For cases with discrepant results, a tiebreaker 
reviewer was assigned.
All oesophageal cancers were categorized as squamous or adenocarcinoma, 
according to the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of the 
Digestive System, 4th edition45. Nine cases were excluded on the basis of patho-
logy review, including four cases where quality control identified inadequate 
material for analysis, two cases where only noninvasive neoplasm was observed, 
and two cases where the neoplasm was unclassifiable on the basis of the material 
 
available for review. As part of this review, an additional 77 gastric adeno-
carcinomas that had not undergone pathology review as part of this group’s 
original published analysis were also subject to pathology re-review as performed 
previously27.
Clinical staging was assessed44 by two reviewers according to criteria for each 
tumour type (ESCC or EAC). T, N and M status and tumour grade (0, 1, 2 or 3) 
were based on pathology reports from the TSS.
Anatomic subclassification of adenocarcinomas involving the GEJ. All adeno-
carcinomas (oesophageal or gastric) from the TCGA collections that had a potential 
 
origin near the GEJ were further reviewed to refine their anatomic location. 
Pathology reports were obtained from the TSSs with the original gross pathology 
description of the tumour at resection or endoscopic biopsy. Two independent 
clinical reviewers reviewed each TSS pathology report. Tumours were classified 
as oesophageal, probable oesophageal, indeterminate, probable gastric or gastric, 
according to criteria outlined in Supplementary Information S1.2. For downstream 
analyses, the oesophageal and probable oesophageal were grouped together, as were 
the gastric and probable gastric.
Somatic copy-number analysis. Analysis of SCNAs was performed on the basis 
of DNA profiling of each tumour or germline sample on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 at 
the Genome Analysis Platform of the Broad Institute as previously described46. 
As part of this process of copy-number assessment and segmentation, regions 
corresponding to germline copy-number alterations were removed by apply-
ing filters generated from either the TCGA germline samples from our ovarian 
cancer analysis or from samples in this collection. Analysis of recurrent broad 
and focal SCNAs was performed with the GISTIC 2.0 algorithm22 with clus-
tering performed in R, on the basis of Euclidean distance using thresholded 
copy number at recurring alteration peaks from GISTIC analysis using Ward’s 
method, both as previously reported27. Allelic copy number and purity and 
ploidy estimates were calculated using the ABSOLUTE algorithm47. Tumours 
were classified as having high chromosomal instability, SCNA-high, if they pos-
sessed at least one arm-level loss (apart from that of 18p, 18q or 21, which were 
recurrent in tumours of both low and high copy-number events) and otherwise 
as SCNA-low. Chromosomal arms were considered altered if at least 80% of 
the arm was lost or gained with a relative log2 copy ratio change of at least 0.15 
(Shih et al., unpublished observations). This method of classifying copy num-
ber instability has 93% concordance with previously described copy-number 
 
clustering27.
DNA methylation. Genomic DNA (1 μg per sample) was bisulfite-modified, sub-
jected to quality control, and analysed using the Illumina Infinium DNA methyla-
tion platform, HumanMethylation450, as detailed in Supplementary Information 
S2. Data files generated are listed in Supplementary Information S2.3.
CDKN2A epigenetic silencing calls. CDKN2A (also known as p16INK4) 
 
epigenetic silencing calls were made using both DNA methylation and RNA-
seq data. CDKN2A DNA methylation status was assessed in each sample 
based on the probe (cg13601799) located in the p16INK4 promoter CpG 
island. p16INK4 expression was determined by the log2(RPKM+1) level of its 
first exon (chr9: 21974403–21975132). The epigenetic silencing calls for each 
sample were made by evaluating a scatterplot showing an inverse association 
between DNA methylation and expression as described in Supplementary 
Information S2.
DNA sequence analysis. Exome and full-coverage whole-genome sequencing was 
split between two sequencing centres. Samples that were submitted to TCGA as 
stomach adenocarcinomas (that is, STAD, as labelled by the TSS) were sent for 
sequencing at the Broad Institute. Samples labelled as oesophageal cancers (that is, 
ESCA) were sequenced at Washington University. Each centre was responsible for 
generating BAM files from both tumour and normal DNA samples with additional 
filtering to remove likely artefacts of the sequencing process. From these BAM files, 
four different TCGA analysis sites performed distinct mutation and insertion/
deletion detection procedures. The results of these distinct mutation-calling efforts 
were integrated to generate a common mutation annotation file for subsequent 
analysis. See Supplementary Section S3.1.
Broad Institute sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing of 0.5 to 3 μg of DNA 
from tumour and normal blood samples was performed as previously described32 
using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V5 kit, followed by 2 × 76-bp 
paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. For whole-genome 
sequencing, 2 × 101-bp reads were sequenced on the same platform. Read 
alignment and processing were performed using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner 
(BWA) and Picard at the Broad Institute (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) 
as previously published27. Alignments were first subjected to quality control using 
 
ContEst48 to avoid misannotation of tumour and germline DNA samples, or 
cross-contamination between tumour samples. Only samples with less than 5% 
estimated cross-contamination were analysed further.
Washington University sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing and whole- 
genome Illumina libraries were constructed as described previously49 using 
Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v3.0 combined with additional 
120-mer IDT custom probes, targeting DNA from cancer-related viruses 
 
(for example, HPV, EBV) and sequenced in multiple lanes of Illumina HiSeq 
2000 flow cells to achieve a minimum coverage of 20× across 80% of coding 
target exons. Each lane or sub-lane of data was aligned using BWA v0.5.9. to

GRCh37-lite_WUGSC_variant_2/).
Identification of somatic mutations and insertion/deletions. The BAM files 
(for exome sequencing) were used for mutation calling at four different analy-
sis centres: Broad Institute, Washington University, University of California at 
Santa Cruz and British Columbia Cancer Agency (as detailed in Supplementary 
Methods S3.1).
Filtered calls from each analysis centre as described above were merged, 
and germline SNP sites reported by the 1000 Genomes project were filtered 
and removed. In addition, for the normal germline BAM, putative variants 
with less than 8× coverage of the reference allele or greater than one somatic 
 
variant-supporting read or 1% somatic variant allele fraction were removed. 
For the tumour BAM, two supporting reads and a variant allele fraction of 5% 
were required as a minimum. Filtering of putatively spurious mutation calls 
due to 8-oxoguanine artefacts was performed to remove candidate mutations 
attributed to these sequencing artefacts. Further filtering removed candidate 
mutations that had been identified through sequencing of cohorts of non- 
neoplastic DNA samples to remove alternative artefacts or unfiltered germline 
calls. Read counts were generated for all remaining novel putative variants, and 
these variants were incorporated into the final mutation annotation file if they 
met the same minimum coverage, maximum coverage, and variant allele fraction 
requirements described above.
Mutation annotation and significance analysis. Functional annotation of muta-
tions was performed with Oncotator (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/ 
cga/oncotator) using Gencode V18. Significantly recurrently mutated genes were 
identified using the MutSigCV2.0 algorithm13.
Mutation signature analysis. Mutation signature discovery was performed using 
Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization algorithm for mutation signature 
 
analysis as described in Supplementary Information S3.2.
Low-pass whole-genome sequencing for rearrangement identification. 
Genomic DNA (500–700 ng per sample) was sheared into 250-bp fragments using 
a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator, then converted to a paired-end Illumina library 
using KAPA Bio kits with Caliper (PerkinElmer) robotic NGS Suite (Partek 
Genomics) according to manufacturers’ protocols. All libraries were sequenced on 
a HiSeq2000 using one sample per lane, with a paired-end 2 × 51-bp read length. 
Tumour DNA and its matching normal DNA were usually loaded on the same 
flow cell. Raw data were converted to the FASTQ format, and BWA alignment 
 
(to hg19) was used to generate BAM files as previously described (supplementary 
S3.6 in ref. 27). Detection of structural rearrangements was performed using two 
algorithms, BreakDancer50 and Meerkat51. The set of structural variant calls from 
 
each tumour sample was filtered by the calls from its matched normal DNA 
 
to remove germline variants. Data were then re-examined using the Meerkat 
 
algorithm, which necessitated the identification of at least two discordant read 
pairs, with one read covering the actual breakpoint junction. Alterations found 
in simple or satellite repeats were also excluded. (Candidate fusion genes from 
this analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 3 with more detailed listing of 
structural alterations in Supplementary Table 7.)
mRNA sequencing and analysis methods. mRNA sequence data were generated 
as described previously (supplementary S5.1 in ref. 27). For combined clustering 
analysis of oesophageal, gastric and head and neck tumours, the University of 
North Carolina Genome Characterization Center reprocessed the stomach ade-
nocarcinoma and oesophageal cancer data with their MapSplice/RSEM pipeline32. 
We generated candidate fusion events from mRNA sequence data as described 
previously (supplementary S5.4 in ref. 27), except that we used TransABySS v1.4.8 
(http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/trans-abyss/releases/1.4.8).
To identify subtypes within our various cohorts, we used hierarchical clustering 
with pheatmap v1.0.2 in R. The input in each case was a reads per kilobase of exon 
per million reads mapped to the transcriptome (RPKM) data matrix for the top 
25% most variable genes with mean greater than 10 RPKM. We transformed each 
row of the matrix by log10(RPKM+1), then used pheatmap to scale the rows. We 
used ward.D2 for the clustering method and correlation and Euclidean distance 
measures for clustering the columns and rows, respectively. We identified genes 
that were differentially expressed, using unpaired two-class significance analysis 
of microarrays (samr v2.0), with an RPKM input matrix and a false discovery rate 
threshold of 0.05.
To compare oesophageal cancer subtypes with established subtypes of HNSCC52 
and lung squamous cell (LUSC) tumours53, centroid gene expression profiles were 
used to categorize the 90 oesophageal squamous tumours into atypical, basal, clas-
sical and mesenchymal by the HNSCC classification; and basal, classical, primitive 
and secretory by the LUSC classification. Of the 839 genes used for the HNSCC 
centroids, 809 overlapped with genes in the ESCC data set. Additionally, of the 
209 genes used for the LUSC predictor centroids, 202 overlapped with genes in 
the ESCC data set. We then generated an RPKM matrix of the 90 ESCC tumour 
samples for each of these gene sets. These matrices were log2 transformed and 
median-centred. Finally, we computed the Pearson correlations between each col-
umn in the matrix and the HNSCC and LUSC centroids.
To evaluate oesophageal mRNA expression relative to other tumour types, 
we combined RNA sequencing by expectation maximization RSEM-normalized 
expression data from the STAD, ESCA and HNSC cohorts. Samples were ordered 
first by organ, then by histology (adenocarcinoma or squamous), then by gastric 
cancer classification (EBV, MSI, GS or CIN categories) and finally by HPV status. 
We selected the top 25% most variable genes (by coefficient of variation) within the 
oesophageal carcinoma sample set with mean expression greater than 1,000 RSEM-
normalized counts. We transformed each row of the matrix by log10(RSEM+1), 
then used pheatmap to scale and cluster the rows.
microRNA sequencing and analysis. We generated microRNA sequence data as 
described previously (supplementary S6.1 in ref. 27). To identify subtypes within 
our various cohorts, we used hierarchical clustering with pheatmap v1.0.2 in R. The 
input in each case was a reads-per-million (RPM) data matrix for the 303 miRBase 
v16 5p or 3p mature strands that had the largest variances across each cohort. We 
transformed each row of the matrix by log10(RPM+1), then used pheatmap to 
scale the rows. We used ward.D2 for the clustering method and correlation and 
Euclidean distance measures for clustering the columns and rows, respectively. For 
analyses comparing oesophageal with gastric and head and neck cancers, we used 
the top 25% (~300) most variable 5p or 3p mature strand microRNAs54 within 
the oesophageal carcinoma sample set. We transformed each row of the matrix by 
log10(RPM+1), then used pheatmap to scale the rows. For clustering the rows, we 
used ward.D2 and a Euclidean distance measure.
Reverse-phase protein array. Proteins isolated from tumours were used to prepare 
reverse-phase protein arrays with 187 validated primary antibodies by methods 
described previously (supplementary S7 in ref. 27). Data were normalized, and 
clustering analysis was performed as detailed in Supplementary Section S4.
Pathogen analysis. We used two tools to examine whole-exome and RNA sequence 
data for the presence of microbial sequences: BBT (BioBloomTools, v1.2.4.b1) 
and PathSeq. Details of these analyses are provided in Supplementary section S5. 
MicroRNA data were analysed using an in-house pipeline as previously described 
(supplementary S9.2 in ref. 27).
Pathway analysis of mRNA. We performed pathway-level analysis of gene expres-
sion to compare EAC and ESCC samples. Pathways, as gene-sets, were obtained 
from the National Cancer Institute’s pathway interaction database (NCI-PID)55. 
A P value, comparing EAC with ESCC using Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis 
of variance by ranks, was obtained for each gene. For each of the 224 pathways, 
the gene-level p values were log-transformed and summed by using an approach 
based on Fisher’s combined statistic to yield a pathway-level composite score. The 
statistical significance of this score was then estimated empirically by similarly 
scoring 10,000 randomly generated pathways for each NCI-PID pathway, with 
matched pathway size.
Integrative clustering. To discover which tumour samples shared molecular sig-
natures across platforms, the following four integrative clustering approaches were 
used: iCluster, Multiple Kernel Learning k-means (MKL k-means), SuperCluster, 
and Clustering of Cluster Assignments (COCA). In the iCluster method10,56,57, 
subgroups were discovered through their representation as latent variables in 
joint multivariate regression. MKL k-means combines the k-means clustering 
algorithm with the use of kernels that encode the similarity between the samples, 
to define features for classifying the tumours. SuperCluster and COCA both use 
clusters derived from individual molecular platforms to form an overall categorical 
 
description of each sample, but they differ in details, such as the metric used to 
compare those samples. SuperCluster performs a variance adjustment such that 
each molecular platform receives equal weight, whereas the implementation of 
COCA employed here and previously (supplementary S10.2 in ref. 27) uses a 
weighting method that takes into account the granularity of the divisions within 
each platform-specific category. Further details on these methods are given in 
Supplementary Section S7.
