ow back pain (LBP) is a worldwide problem and the leading cause of dis-
ability.1 International clinical guidelines differ on the usefulness of spinal 
manipulation in managing LBP in primary care.2 The early management path-
way of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence3 and the joint clinical 
practice guidelines of the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society4 
both recommend spinal manipulation for persistent or chronic LBP. Nevertheless, a 
 
Cochrane Review5 concluded that spinal manipulation is no more effective than sham 
Targeting Patient Subgroups With Chronic Low

Context: Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is often used to treat patients 
with low back pain (LBP). 
Objective: To identify subgroups of patients with chronic LBP who achieve medium 
to large treatment effects with OMT based on responder analyses involving pain and 
functioning outcomes from the OSTEOPAThic Health outcomes In Chronic low back 
pain (OSTEOPATHIC) Trial.
Methods: This randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial involving 455 pa-
tients in Dallas-Fort Worth was conducted from 2006 to 2011. A 100-mm visual ana-
log scale (VAS) for LBP intensity and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(RMDQ) for back-specific functioning were used to assess primary and secondary 
outcomes, respectively. Substantial improvement was defined as 50% or greater 
reduction at week 12 compared with baseline. Cumulative distribution functions for 
the RR and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) were used to assess response.
Results: Medium treatment effects for LBP intensity were observed overall 
 
(RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.76; P=.002; NNT, 6.9; 95% CI, 4.3-18.6). However, large 
treatment effects were observed in patients with baseline VAS scores of  35 mm or 
 
greater. Although OMT was not associated with overall substantial improvement 
in back-specific functioning, patients with baseline RMDQ scores of 7 or greater 
experienced medium effects, and patients with baseline scores 16 or greater expe-
rienced large effects that were significant. The OMT effects for LBP intensity and 
back-specific functioning were independent of baseline patient demographic charac-
teristics, comorbid medical conditions, and medication use for LBP during the trial. 
Conclusions: Subgrouping according to baseline levels of chronic LBP inten-
sity and back-specific functioning appears to be a simple strategy for identifying 
 
sizeable numbers of patients who achieve substantial improvement with OMT 
 
and may thereby be less likely to use more costly and invasive interventions.

Methods
Study Design
The design and results of the OSTEOPATHIC Trial 
have been previously published.10-12 This double-
blind, sham-controlled trial of OMT for nonspecific 
chronic LBP was conducted at The Osteopathic Re-
search Center at the University of North Texas Health 
Science Center in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex 
from August 2006 through January 2011. A total of 
455 men and women aged 21 to 69 years were re-
cruited from primary care settings and randomly al-
located to OMT or sham OMT within a 2×2 factorial 
design. Ultrasound therapy, which was the second 
factor studied, was found to be nonefficacious and to 
have no statistical interaction with OMT. Six treat-
ment sessions were provided at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 
8. The OMT package was delivered during 15-minute 
treatment sessions and included soft tissue, articula-
tory, and high-velocity, low-amplitude techniques. 
These 3 techniques were agreed to by the osteopathy, 
chiropractic, and physiotherapy professional associa-
tions in the UK Back pain Exercise And Manipulation 
(UK BEAM) trial.13 Additionally, our protocol in-
cluded myofascial release, counterstrain, and muscle 
energy techniques, as well as other optional tech-
niques if time permitted.10 Sham OMT involved hand 
contact, active and passive range of motion, and tech-
niques that simulated OMT but used such maneuvers 
as light touch, improper patient positioning, purposely 
misdirected movements, and diminished provider 
force.10 This approach has achieved a robust placebo 
response14 compared with other placebo treatments for 
pain15 and has been adopted elsewhere.16 The study 
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at the University of North Texas Health Science 
Center, and all patients provided written informed 
consent. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials 
.gov (NCT00315120).
spinal manipulation in providing short-term LBP re-
lief. However, the latter was based on very low-quality 
evidence, including small sample sizes, high risk of 
bias, and heterogeneity of research design in many 
included studies.5
 
There has been growing interest in targeting sub-
groups of patients with LBP to identify those most 
likely to improve with intervention. A clinical predic-
tion rule for spinal manipulation that included 5 pa-
tient-reported or practitioner-based measurements 
showed promising results over 4 weeks in patients with 
LBP of varying duration.6 The Keele University Sub-
groups for Targeted Treatment (STarT) Back Screening 
Tool was subsequently validated as a brief instrument 
for assessing risk of persistence and disability to be 
used in a stratified approach to managing LBP in pri-
mary care.7 There are no corresponding strategies, 
however, for exclusively targeting patients with 
chronic LBP for spinal manipulation. Moreover, re-
sponder analyses that may inform such strategies have 
been infrequently and inconsistently reported in ran-
domized controlled trials.8 The National Institutes of 
Health Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic 
Low Back Pain has identified the reporting of cumula-
tive distribution functions of responses for treatment 
and control groups as an attractive aspect of responder 
analysis because of the lack of consensus and data on 
response thresholds.9 
 
The OSTEOPAThic Health outcomes In Chronic 
low back pain (OSTEOPATHIC) Trial was conducted 
in the United States to assess the short-term efficacy of 
osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in patients 
with chronic LBP. Its findings of clinically relevant 
LBP improvement with OMT10-12 bring into question 
previous Cochrane Review conclusions.5 Herein, to 
further guide the use of OMT in subgroups of patients 
with chronic LBP, we report the results of responder 
analyses from the OSTEOPATHIC Trial that describe 
the effects of OMT on patients’ LBP intensity and back-
specific functioning.

VAS scores ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm. This ap-
proach was reversed in the highest-to-lowest (HTL) 
strategy wherein outcomes were determined by cumula-
tive baseline scores ranging from 100 mm to 0 mm. For 
back-specific functioning, the analyses and plots were 
based on cumulative baseline RMDQ scores ranging 
from 0 to 24 (LTH strategy) and from 24 to 0 (HTL 
strategy). Substantial improvement in back-specific 
functioning was also defined as a 50% or greater reduc-
tion in the RMDQ score vs baseline because this re-
sponse threshold has been used in multiple trials8 and 
was consistent with our threshold for LBP intensity. 
Using both relative (RR) and absolute (NNT) outcome 
metrics provided a robust assessment of OMT response. 
Additionally, the current study focused both on improve-
ments in LBP and related functioning that are important 
to individual patients and on treatment effects at the 
population level that are important to policy makers 
 
and stakeholders.
Statistical Analysis
Data were summarized as median (interquartile range 
[IQR]) for continuous variables and as number (%) for 
categorical variables. Risk ratios and 95% CIs were 
computed using contingency table methods. The NNTs 
were computed as the reciprocal of the absolute differ-
ence in proportion of substantial improvement with 
OMT relative to sham OMT and 95% CIs were com-
puted using the Wilson score method.20 Areas under the 
curve (down to 0 for percentage of responders and RR, 
and down to 1 for NNT) and 95% CIs were computed 
in all analyses. Undefined values of RR or NNT 
 
(attributable to small cell sizes and division by 0) were 
assigned RR=1 (no effect) or NNT=100 (minimal 
 
effect). Number-needed-to-treat outcomes greater 
 
than 100 or less than 0 were also assigned a score of 
100 in computing areas under the curve. The RR and 
NNT plots comparing the LTH and HTL strategies 
 
excluded patients with baseline scores of 10 mm or 
less or greater than 90 mm on the VAS and with 2 or 
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure in the OSTEOPATHIC 
Trial was a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) for 
 
LBP intensity. Substantial LBP improvement at week 
 
12 (≥50% pain reduction vs baseline)10-12 was assessed 
based on recommendations of the Initiative on Methods, 
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials.17 
Back-specific functioning was measured with the 
 
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ),18 
a legacy measure of limitations in physical functioning 
attributable to LBP.9 
Analysis for Cumulative Percentage  
of Responders to Treatment
We used cumulative percentage of responders analysis19 
to measure and plot treatment response to OMT and 
sham OMT over the range of outcomes from 0-mm to 
100-mm reductions on the VAS and from 0- to 24-point 
reductions on the RMDQ at week 12. Corresponding 
analyses were performed and plots constructed for treat-
ment response based on percentage reductions in VAS 
and RMDQ scores ranging from 0% to 100%. Presenting 
outcomes in these 4 responder analyses in this manner, 
without a priori criteria for therapeutic success, has the 
advantage of comparing treatment groups at responder 
levels that may be most valid for—and applicable to—
differing patient care populations.19
Estimation of Cumulative Distribution 
Functions for Substantial Response  
to Treatment 
We estimated cumulative distribution functions in an-
other 4 responder analyses for the efficacy of OMT based 
on RRs and numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) for sub-
stantial improvement in LBP intensity and back-specific 
functioning. Herein, 2 strategies for targeting patient 
subgroups for OMT according to baseline VAS and 
RMDQ scores were compared. The lowest-to-highest 
(LTH) strategy was assessed by computing and plotting 
RRs and NNTs according to cumulative baseline

less or greater than 21 on the RMDQ to avoid extreme 
or undefined summary measures attributable to small 
sample size. These plots were smoothed by using the 
moving average of cumulative response over succes-
sive 10-mm intervals of baseline VAS scores and 
3-point intervals of baseline RMDQ scores. In each 
graph, a treatment or patient subgrouping strategy was 
considered to dominate the alternative if superior out-
comes were observed for all plotted data points. 
 
The number at risk of substantial improvement was 
determined for patient subgroups that demonstrated 
medium or large treatment effects.
 
The clinical relevance of RR outcomes was assessed 
using guidelines established by the Cochrane Back Re-
view Group21: RR<1, negative effect or harm; 
1≤RR<1.25, small effect; 1.25≤RR≤2, medium effect; 
and RR>2, large effect. There are no commonly accepted 
guidelines for interpreting clinical relevance of NNT 
outcomes because they are sensitive to the level of effi-
cacy of the control group and depend on various study 
design features, including the outcome measure and how 
it is dichotomized.22 Consequently, assessment of the 
clinical relevance of NNTs was guided by a systematic 
review of clinical trials wherein oral analgesics were 
compared with placebo controls using 50% or greater 
pain reduction as the measure of short-term treatment 
success.23 The following guidelines were thus estab-
lished: NNT≥10, small effect; 5≤NNT<10, medium ef-
fect; and 1≤NNT<5, large effect (NNT<0 represents a 
negative effect or harm). This NNT classification scheme 
is compatible with the interpretation of RMDQ outcomes 
in the UK BEAM trial.24 
 
Finally, multiple logistic regression was used to com-
pute ORs and 95% CIs for substantial improvements in 
LBP intensity and back-specific functioning with OMT 
while simultaneously controlling for patient demo-
graphic characteristics, comorbid medical conditions, 
LBP co-treatments during the trial, and reported adverse 
events. All analyses were based on intention-to-treat, 
with missing data imputed using the last-observation-
carried-forward method. A sensitivity analysis was per-
formed by repeating all analyses using moderate 
improvement in LBP intensity and back-specific func-
tioning (≥30% reduction in VAS and RMDQ scores vs 
baseline) as the threshold for a minimally important 
change.25 Hypotheses were tested at the .05 level of sta-
tistical significance. Data were managed and analyzed 
with SPSS software (version 21; IBM), and Microsoft 
Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation) was used to plot 
cumulative distribution functions.
Results
Patient Characteristics  
and Overall Study Results
The baseline patient characteristics of the treatment 
 
groups were comparable (Table 1). The overall study 
 
outcomes demonstrated that OMT was efficacious in 
yielding moderate and substantial improvements in LBP 
intensity but not in back-specific functioning. Patients 
who received OMT also reported marginally less frequent 
use of prescription medications for LBP during the trial.
Cumulative Percentage of Responders
The cumulative percentage of responders analysis dem-
onstrated that OMT dominated sham OMT in achieving 
percentage improvements in VAS scores for LBP inten-
sity (Figure 1). This was further corroborated by signifi-
cant differences between treatment groups in the 
corresponding areas under the curve (0.46, 95% CI, 0.42-
0.50 for OMT vs 0.34, 95% CI, 0.31-0.38 for sham 
OMT; P<.001). There were also statistical trends fa-
voring OMT for absolute improvement in LBP intensity 
and percentage improvement in back-specific func-
tioning. These were manifested by greater probability of 
response with OMT at all VAS absolute reduction thresh-
olds less than 70 mm and at all RMDQ percentage reduc-
tion thresholds greater than 22%. Response to OMT was 
virtually indistinguishable from sham OMT for absolute 
improvement in back-specific functioning.

455 patients (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13-1.76; P=.002). A 
large effect size was seen in 186 patients (41%) with 
VAS scores of 50 mm or greater. The LTH strategy 
yielded RRs near the threshold for small to medium 
treatment effects in reducing VAS scores for LBP inten-
sity. Medium effect sizes for back-specific functioning 
were observed with the HTL strategy in the subgroup of 
177 patients (39%) with cumulative baseline RMDQ 
scores of 7 or greater; however, large OMT effect sizes 
were observed in 24 patients (5%) with cumulative base-
line RMDQ scores of 17 or greater. The LTH strategy 
yielded RRs near the threshold for very small or negative 
OMT effect sizes over the entire spectrum of cumulative 
RMDQ scores.
 
Similar outcomes for patient subgrouping were ob-
served in the cumulative distribution functions for NNT 
(Figure 3). The HTL strategy yielded substantially better 
OMT outcomes for LBP intensity and back-specific 
functioning, including dominance in both plots. Medium 
effect sizes for LBP intensity were observed in the 
overall group of 455 patients (NNT, 6.9; 95% CI, 4.3-
18.6). Large effect sizes were seen in 294 patients (65%) 
with cumulative VAS scores of 35 or greater. The LTH 
strategy yielded OMT effect sizes in the small to mod-
erate range. Medium effect sizes for back-specific func-
tioning were observed with the HTL strategy in 177 
patients (39%) with RMDQ scores of 7 or greater. Large 
OMT effect sizes were seen in 36 patients (8%) with 
RMDQ scores of 16 or greater. The LTH strategy consis-

Cumulative distribution functions for the RR for substantial improvement with osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).  
The data are plotted as the RR for alternate strategies for targeting subgroups of patients for treatment according to cumulative 
baseline severity of symptoms (lowest-to-highest [LTH] vs highest-to-lowest [HTL]). The LTH strategy involved computing 
and plotting the RR for 101 discrete points representing cumulative baseline visual analog scale (VAS) scores from 0 mm to 
100 mm, whereas the HTL strategy was based on scores from 100 mm to 0 mm. For back-specific functioning, the analyses 
and plots were based on 25 discrete points representing cumulative baseline Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) 
scores from 0 to 24 and from 24 to 0 for the respective strategies. The cumulative number of patients at risk is presented below 
the x-axis for the corresponding strategy. The RR and 95% CI reported in each plot represent the overall results when the 2 
strategies converge to include all 455 patients. Patients with baseline scores 10 mm or less or greater than 90 mm on the VAS, 
or with 2 or less or greater than 21 on the RMDQ, were not included in the plots to avoid extreme or undefined RRs attributable 
to small sample size. The plots were smoothed by using the moving average of RRs over successive 10-mm intervals of 
baseline VAS scores and 3-point intervals of baseline RMDQ scores (this smoothing obscured the large treatment effect 
observed in 186 patients with baseline VAS scores 50 mm or greater). Abbreviations: LBP, low back pain; NAR, number at risk.

tently yielded NNTs representing small or negative OMT 
effect sizes for back-specific functioning. 
 
A comparison of the cumulative distribution func-
tions for the strategies for targeting patient subgroups for 
OMT shows that the HTL strategy was clearly superior 
to LTH (Table 2). Using the HTL strategy and our criteria 
for treatment effect, the NNT cumulative distribution 
function identified more patients with large treatment 
effects for LBP intensity (n=294 [65%]) than did the RR 
cumulative distribution function based on the Cochrane 
Back Review Group criteria (n=186 [41%]). 
Multivariate Analyses
Osteopathic manipulative treatment was the strongest 
multivariate factor associated with substantial improve-
ment in LBP intensity (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.24-2.72; 
P=.002) (Table 3). However, OMT was not associated 
with substantial improvement in back-specific func-
tioning. Patients who were current cigarette smokers and 
those aged 50 to 69 years were less likely to experience 
substantial improvements in LBP intensity and back-
specific functioning, respectively. None of the comorbid 
medical conditions studied, and neither prescription nor 
nonprescription medication use, was associated with sub-
stantial improvements in LBP intensity or back-specific 
functioning. There was no significant interaction between 
OMT and any of the categorical variables included in the 
multiple logistic regression model. The results observed 
in our sensitivity analysis for moderate improvement 
 
Figure 3. 
Cumulative distribution functions for the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for substantial improvement with osteopathic manipulative 
treatment (OMT). The data are plotted as the NNT for alternate strategies for targeting subgroups of patients for treatment according  
to cumulative baseline severity of symptoms (lowest-to-highest [LTH] vs highest-to-lowest [HTL]). The LTH strategy involved  
computing and plotting the NNT for 101 discrete points representing cumulative baseline visual analog scale (VAS) scores from  
0 mm to 100 mm whereas the HTL strategy was based on scores from 100 mm to 0 mm. For back-specific functioning, the analyses 
and plots were based on 25 discrete points representing cumulative baseline Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores 
from 0 to 24 and from 24 to 0 for the respective strategies. The cumulative number of patients at risk is presented below the x-axis  
for the corresponding strategy. The NNT and 95% CI reported in each plot represent the overall results when the 2 strategies converge 
to include all 455 patients. The first and second confidence limits represent the range of best to worst NNT, respectively, with negative 
values indicating harm. Patients with baseline scores 10 mm or less or greater than 90 mm on the VAS, or with 2 or less or greater 
than 21 on the RMDQ, were not included in the plots to avoid extreme or undefined NNTs attributable to small sample size. The plots 
were smoothed by using the moving average of NNTs over successive 10-mm intervals of baseline VAS scores and 3-point intervals  
of baseline RMDQ scores. Abbreviations: LBP, low back pain; NAR, number at risk.

sity that meet the criteria for both substantial improve-
ment and minimally important change.10 The present 
responder analysis now indicates that patient subgroups 
may be targeted for response to OMT according to their 
baseline levels of LBP intensity and back-specific func-
tioning. Extrapolating to the general population of pa-
tients with chronic LBP, our results suggest that sizeable 
subgroups of patients, perhaps as many as two-thirds, 
may be targeted for large treatment effects in substan-
tially reducing LBP intensity. Correspondingly, about 
(ie, minimally important change), including the cumula-
tive distribution functions for RR and NNT and the mul-
tivariate analyses for improvement in LBP intensity and 
back-specific functioning, were generally comparable to 
those reported herein for substantial improvement.
Discussion
The OSTEOPATHIC Trial has previously shown that 
OMT is efficacious in achieving reductions in LBP inten-

tions for the RR and NNT as summary measures of 
efficacy with which to target patients with chronic LBP 
for a short course of OMT. The NNT emerged as a 
metric that may be used to supplement the more com-
monly used summary measures of efficacy. It may serve 
as a sensitive indicator of patient subgroups likely to 
experience reductions in LBP intensity with OMT as 
more standardized criteria for NNT interpretation in 
pain trials emerge. The use of the VAS and RMDQ and 
widely accepted thresholds of 30% and 50% reduction 
four-tenths of patients may be targeted for medium treat-
ment effects in substantially improving back-specific 
functioning with OMT.
 
To our knowledge, the OSTEOPATHIC Trial is the 
first major trial that has implemented the recommenda-
tion of the National Institutes of Health Task Force on 
Research Standards for Chronic Low Back Pain to re-
port cumulative distribution functions of responses in 
treatment and control groups.9 The present study demon-
strates the feasibility of cumulative distribution func-

Conclusion
The increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging, 
opioid prescribing, epidural steroidal injections, and 
spinal surgery has not improved outcomes or disability 
rates in patients with chronic LBP.29 Our results indicate 
that OMT is more efficacious in treating chronic LBP 
than previously reported in the latest Cochrane review of 
spinal manipulation,5 particularly in patient subgroups 
that may be easily identified by their baseline levels of 
LBP intensity. Thus, it appears reasonable to target the 
patient subgroups identified herein for a short course of 
OMT before proceeding to such other interventions. Pa-
tients with greater LBP intensity may represent an ideal 
population to target for OMT because they are most 
likely to accept the risks and costs of more invasive pro-
cedures such as lumbar surgery.30 Additional research 
may also be warranted to explore how the subgroup find-
ings reported herein may be combined with other sub-
grouping approaches to more effectively target patients 
with chronic LBP for treatment.

for moderate and substantial improvement, respectively, 
facilitates corroboration of our findings and implemen-
tation in clinical practice. 
 
The OSTEOPATHIC Trial is the largest single-site 
efficacy trial of spinal manipulation for chronic LBP 
based on a comparison with 26 trials reported in the 
Cochrane Review, including chiropractic and physical 
therapy studies.5 Although focusing on efficacy facili-
tated tighter control of experimental design, our trial 
exhibited several pragmatic features that enhance the 
generalizability of its findings. These included limited 
exclusion criteria (eg, no thresholds for LBP intensity 
or back-specific functioning), clinically meaningful 
outcomes for patients, and intention-to-treat analysis.26 
Moreover, the OMT protocol included the 3 techniques 
commonly used by chiropractors, foreign-trained 
 
osteopaths, and physiotherapists, as agreed to in the 
UK BEAM trial.13 The multivariate results and absence 
of interaction effects further suggest that OMT efficacy 
may not vary significantly according to such factors as 
patient demographic characteristics, LBP features, co-
morbid medical conditions, and use of prescription or 
nonprescription medication for LBP. 
 
There are several potential limitations of our study. 
First, responder analysis was not planned when our trial 
was initially developed over 10 years ago. These a poste-
riori subgroup analyses were based on patient character-
istics established before randomization. Hence, they are 
less vulnerable to biases than analyses based on variables 
derived after randomization. Nevertheless, it is possible 
that confounding variables may no longer have been 
distributed at random in the subgroups,27 particularly in 
those with smaller numbers of patients at risk. Second, 
we used the last-observation-carried-forward to impute 
missing data. While other methods for data imputation 
have been used in the OSTEOPATHIC Trial, they have 
not yielded materially different results.10,28 Third, the 
NNT is not widely used and reported as a measure of 
efficacy and, unlike the RR, there are no established 
guidelines for its interpretation in LBP research.21
