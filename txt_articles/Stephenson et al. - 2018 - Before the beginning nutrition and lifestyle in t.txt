Abstract (312 words) 
 
A woman who is healthy at the time of conception is more likely to have a successful pregnancy and 
a healthy child.  We reviewed published evidence and present new data from high, low and middle 
income countries on the timing and importance of preconception health for subsequent maternal 
and child health.  We describe the extent to which pregnancy is planned, and whether planning is 
linked to preconception health behaviours.  
 
Observational studies show strong links between health before pregnancy and maternal and child 
health outcomes, with consequences that can extend across generations, but awareness of these 
links is not widespread.  Poor nutrition and obesity are rife among women of reproductive age, and 
differences between high and lower income countries have become less distinct, with typical diets 
falling far short of nutritional recommendations in both settings and especially among adolescents. 
 
Numerous studies show that micronutrient supplementation starting in pregnancy can correct 
important maternal nutrient deficiencies, but effects on child health outcomes are disappointing.  
Other interventions to improve diet during pregnancy have had little impact on maternal and 
newborn health outcomes.  There have been comparatively few attempts at preconception diet 
and lifestyle intervention.  Improvements in the measurement of pregnancy planning have 
quantified the degree of pregnancy planning and suggest that this is more common than previously 
recognised.  Planning for pregnancy is associated with a mixed pattern of health behaviours before 
conception.   
 
We propose novel definitions of the preconception period relating to embryo development and to 
action at individual or population level.  A sharper focus on intervention before conception is 
needed to improve maternal and child health and reduce the growing burden of non-
communicable disease.  Alongside continued efforts to reduce smoking, alcohol and obesity in the 
population, we call for heightened awareness of preconception health, particularly regarding diet 
and nutrition.  Importantly health professionals should be alerted to ways of identifying women 
who are planning a pregnancy.

Key messages  
Health before conception is strongly linked to the outcome of pregnancy;  life course research 
pin-points the preconception period as critical for health across generations.   
The preconception period should be redefined according to: a) the biological perspective - days  
to weeks before embryo development b) the individual perspective - a conscious intention to 
conceive, typically weeks to months before pregnancy occurs c) the public health perspective -  
longer periods of months or years to address preconception risk factors such as diet and obesity  
Many women of reproductive age, in HIC as well as LMIC, will not be prepared nutritionally for 
pregnancy.  
Micronutrient supplementation starting in pregnancy can correct important maternal nutrient 
deficiencies and dietary interventions in pregnancy can limit weight gain, but they are ���� ������� 
��� ����� to fundamentally improve child health and pregnancy outcomes respectively. 
The preconception period presents a period of special opportunity for intervention; the rationale 
is based on life course epidemiology, developmental (embryo) programming around the time of 
conception, maternal motivation and disappointment with interventions starting in pregnancy.  
Better measurement shows that pregnancy planning is more common than previously 
recognised, in both LMIC and HIC.  
Identifying people contemplating pregnancy provides a window of opportunity to improve health 
before conception, while population-level initiatives to reduce the determinants of 
preconception risks, such as obesity and smoking, irrespective of pregnancy planning, are 
essential to improve outcomes.

Introduction  (text 4512 words) 
 
Health around the time of conception, once a neglected topic, is now a focus of increasing interest, 
reflected in numerous recent reports from national [1, 2] and international health agencies, [3, 4].  
Three linked articles in this issue make the case for preconception health as a key determinant of 
pregnancy success and next generation health, drawing on evidence across clinical, biological and 
social/policy fields. In this paper, we follow three lines of enquiry.  First we review the evidence 
linking preconception health, particularly nutritional status, to pregnancy and birth outcomes,  
including analysis of the few cohort studies in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC)  and high-
income countries (HIC) to have recruited women before pregnancy(web appendix) [5] [6, 7] [8] and 
survey data on the nutrition of a nationally representative sample of women in a HIC [[9]. Using 
these data, we assess how well women are prepared, in health terms, for pregnancy.  Second, since 
preconception care is largely neglected, we assess the extent to which intervention during 
pregnancy can mitigate the impact of preconception risk behaviours by reviewing systematic 
reviews of dietary and lifestyle interventions that started in pregnancy (web appendix).  Third, efforts to 
improve preconception health can be aimed at a population level, irrespective of any pregnancy 
planning, and / or targeted more specifically at women who are planning for pregnancy.  We 
therefore review what is known about the extent of planning for pregnancy, including new data 
from a low income country on how to measure pregnancy planning[10].   A host of social, medical 
and environmental conditions can influence pregnancy outcomes, including genetic disorders, pre-
existing physical and mental health conditions, teratogenic agents and domestic abuse to name a 
few.  We recognise their importance, but review of these conditions is outside the scope of this 
paper. The importance of ��� �������� preconception health is addressed in the second paper in this 
series and targeting of intervention strategies to improve preconception health is considered in a 
third paper . 
 
 
Preconception risk factors in perspective 
 
Life course epidemiology provides a useful perspective for examining preconception factors and 
their effects on maternal, fetal, and child health by considering the timing and duration of 
exposures and their potential long term or latent impacts [11].  The relationship of exposures to 
outcomes can be considered in terms of critical periods, sensitive periods, and cumulative effects.  
For example, the period around conception (two to three months before and after) is a critical 
period for optimising gamete function, and early placental development.  In this period, folic acid 
supplementation, for example, can reduce the risk of neural tube defects by as much as 70% [12, 
13].  Other benefits of folic acid supplementation during periconception may include decreased risk 
of pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, low birth weight, small for gestational age, stillbirth, neonatal death 
and autism in children [14-16]. The consequences of materno-fetal iron deficiency also fit a critical 
period model in which repletion after an undetermined time-point fails to rectify structural 
impairments to developing brain structures. In experimental animal models, dietary restriction of 
  
6 
iron from the beginning of gestation can induce a 40�50% decrease in brain iron 10 days after birth 
[17] and preconception zinc deficiency compromises fetal and placental growth and neural tube 
closure [18]. Adolescence may represent a particularly sensitive period as unhealthy lifestyle 
behaviours - such as smoking, poor diet and eating disorders - often originate in the teenage years.  
These preconception risk factors can set patterns that have a cumulative effect on health into 
adulthood and for future generations, as shown by mounting evidence of the long-term impact of 
poor maternal nutrition and obesity for the child [19]. 
 
Maternal Body Composition, Nutrition and Lifestyle factors 
 
i. Body mass index (BMI). Both maternal underweight and overweight are associated with 
substantial risks for maternal and child health.  An analysis of adult BMI in 200 countries from 1975 
to 2014 with over 19 million participants found that the age-standardised global prevalence of 
underweight in women (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) decreased from 15% to 10%; South Asia had the highest 
rates with an estimated 24% of women underweight in 2014 [20].  While underweight has 
decreased, the global prevalence of obesity (BMI �30 kg/m2) has risen from 6% to 15% in women 
[20]; in many HIC and LMIC, up to 50% are overweight or obese when they become pregnant [21, 
22].  Obesity is associated with increased risk of most major adverse maternal and perinatal 
outcomes, from inability to conceive to complications of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia, gestational 
diabetes) and delivery (macrosomia), congenital anomalies, stillbirth, and low birth weight, 
unsuccessful breastfeeding and even maternal death [22-25]. The global increase in obesity among 
men, from 3% to 11% between 1975 and 2014[20] is not irrelevant; paternal obesity has been 
linked to impaired fertility by affecting sperm quality and quantity [26] and is associated with 
increased chronic disease risk in offspring [27].  The cumulative effect of both maternal and 
paternal obesity on the risk of obesity in future generations has been proposed by numerous 
studies [28] and causal pathways involving interaction between genetic, epigenetic and 
environmental factors are emerging (paper 2). 
 
Although the benefits of preconception weight loss remain to be established through clinical trials, 
observational studies indicate the likely effects of preconception weight loss on pregnancy 
outcomes. In a population-based study in Canada with 226,958 singleton pregnancies, a 
preconception weight loss of 10% was associated with clinically meaningful risk reduction in pre-
eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and stillbirth [29].  Women 
undergoing bariatric surgery at least two years before conception had considerably lower risk or 
odds of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders and large-for-gestational age neonates 
compared with women of similar BMI who had no bariatric surgery, although this was partially 
offset by more small-for-gestational-age births [30-32].  Higher levels of preconception physical 
activity were associated with lower risk of gestational diabetes (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28, 0.75 in seven 
cohorts, 34,929 pregnancies) [33] and pre-eclampsia (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47, 0.89, in five studies, 
10,317 pregnancies) [34].  Walking at a brisk pace for four hours or more per week before 
pregnancy was also associated with lower risk of gestational diabetes [35].  The recent success of a 
  
7 
lifestyle intervention in reducing weight retention post-partum [[36] shows that preparation for 
health in the next pregnancy can begin straight after the last pregnancy. 
 
ii. Preconception diet and nutrition. Diet and nutrition before pregnancy may modify maternal and 
perinatal outcomes via effects on BMI (as above) or other nutritional factors, including 
micronutrient deficiencies.  WHO estimates that around two billion people are deficient in 
micronutrients, with women being at particular risk because of menstruation and the high 
metabolic demands of pregnancy [37].  Globally, maternal undernutrition and its consequences, 
including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, vitamin A and/or zinc deficiency, together with 
sub-optimal breastfeeding, is estimated to account for 3.1 million child deaths annually, or 45% of 
all child deaths in 2011 [38].  A recent comprehensive review of nutrition among adolescent girls 
and women of reproductive age in LMIC concluded that, despite the reduction in prevalence of 
underweight, dietary deficiencies, including iron, vitamin A, iodine, zinc, and calcium remain 
prevalent [39]. A typical diet in HIC, characterised by high intake of red meat, refined grains, refined 
sugars, and high fat dairy, is also lacking in several important nutrients including magnesium, 
iodine, calcium and vitamin D [40, 41].   
 
Our analysis in the UK shows that many women of reproductive age will not be nutritionally 
prepared for pregnancy, even at lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI) levels; this applies especially 
to young women and mineral intake (Table 1).  Seventy-seven percent of women aged 18-25 years 
had dietary intakes below RNI daily recommendations for iodine and 96% of women of 
reproductive age had intakes below iron and folate recommendations for pregnancy (data not 
shown).  Achieving adequate folate levels in pregnancy (red blood cell folate concentration above 
906 nmol/L) for prevention of neural tube defects may be hard to achieve through diet alone[42].  
Folic acid supplements or fortified foods are effective alternatives. In a cohort of over 1.5 million 
women in China, folic acid supplementation three months before pregnancy was associated with 
significantly lower risk of low birthweight (OR 0·74, 95% CI 0·71-0·78), miscarriage (OR 0·53, 0·52-
0·54), stillbirth (OR 0·70, 0·64-0·77), and neonatal mortality (OR 0·70, 0·63-0·78) compared to 
women who did not take folic acid before pregnancy[16].  In several countries (Canada, Chile, 
Oman, South Africa, USA), a decrease in neural tube defects has been observed following folic acid 
fortification ([13].  A mild degree of iodine deficiency in pregnancy has been linked to lower 
intelligence quotients in offspring [40], although the balance of benefit and risk from iodine 
supplementation before or during pregnancy remains unclear [43].  
 
Cohort studies have suggested that dietary patterns up to three years before pregnancy, 
characterised by high intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and fish and low intake of red and 
processed meat, are associated with reduced risk of gestational diabetes [44-47], hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy [48-50] and preterm birth [51]. Since few people will plan a pregnancy three 
years in advance, this highlights the need for population-level interventions.  In the UK and 
Australia, more than 9 out of 10 women aged 18-25 years reported consuming fewer than five fruit 
  
8 
and vegetable portions daily (Table 1).  As the diet of the young child is determined largely by the 
mother, this has important implications for future child health. 
 
iii. Smoking, alcohol and caffeine. Evidence for the impact of maternal smoking on health 
outcomes, (including pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight) comes 
largely from studies initiated during, rather than before, pregnancy [52, 53].  While there are no 
published trials showing that reducing smoking before conception improves these outcomes, 
indirect evidence of impact at population level comes from introduction of smoke-free legislation in 
different countries which has been associated with substantial reductions in preterm births (-
10.4%, 95% CI -18.8, -2.0; from four cohort studies with 1,366,862 pregnancies) [54].  Maternal 
alcohol consumption can result in a range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders resulting in physical, 
behavioural and learning difficulties. [55] W���� ���������� �� ��� ����� ������ �� ������� �� 
controversial, there is considerable public awareness that avoidance of both smoking and alcohol 
during pregnancy is important for health. Caffeine consumption during pregnancy has been 
associated with a reduction in birth weight of a similar size to that caused by alcohol, and a 
significant trend for greater reduction in birth weight with higher caffeine intake [56]].  This 
relationship was consistent across all three trimesters, suggesting that cutting back on caffeine 
before conception could be beneficial. However, as with all preconception risk factors, the scope 
for action at individual level is limited by unplanned pregnancy; this in turn highlights the 
importance of cost-effective public health action (e.g. minimum pricing of alcohol and smoke-free 
legislation) to reduce risk behaviours in the whole population, with additional benefit for those 
whose pregnancies are unplanned.   
 
 
i.v. Lifestyle interventions and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy. Since women are 
more likely to engage with health services once they are pregnant than beforehand, we considered 
whether birth outcomes can be improved by intervening in pregnancy to redress poor dietary 
patterns that were present before conception.  In HIC, the obesity epidemic has dominated efforts 
to improve pregnancy outcomes.  Our overview identified 20 systematic reviews of antenatal 
interventions with a dietary component, six confined to overweight or obese women (Figure 2, 
detail in web appendix).  These reviews, mainly of trials from HIC, provide high quality consistent 
evidence that diet (with or without exercise) during pregnancy can reduce gestational weight gain, 
although a recent individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of 36 randomised controlled trials 
with 12,526 women of mixed BMI  found an average reduction in gestational weight gain of only 
0.7kg (95% CI -0.92 to -0.48) [57].   Some reviews also reported that dietary intervention during 
pregnancy led to reduction in dietary fat and energy intake, with increased consumption of fibre, 
protein, fruit and vegetables [58-60].   High quality trials published after these systematic reviews 
show similar effects on dietary behaviours. The LIMIT trial in Australia showed increased 
consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, fibre, and micronutrients, and a reduction in energy 
from saturated fat sources among overweight or obese women [61]. The UPBEAT trial in the UK 
also showed a reduction in consumption of processed foods and snack foods among obese women 
  
9 
[62]. Both trials showed dietary behaviour change at 28 and 36 weeks gestation and UPBEAT 
reported reduced infant adiposity 6 months postpartum [63].  While improved health behaviours 
and weight gain restriction should not be ignored as there may be longer term benefits, these 
interventions have had no significant impact on common adverse pregnancy outcomes, including 
gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, large-for-gestational-age or preterm births in women of mixed 
BMI or in obese women (Figure 2), although the IPD meta-analysis reported a 9% reduction in 
caesarean section in women of all BMIs (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99) [57].  As attempts to improve 
outcomes in obese women with insulin sensitising drugs have also failed [64, 65] attention is 
increasingly focused on improving diet and preventing or reversing obesity in the preconception 
period.  Given the substantial time needed to reach a healthy weight, early intervention at a 
population level is vital to reduce obesity related outcomes in pregnancy.  
 
In LMIC, antenatal dietary interventions have generally focused on the problem of calorific and 
nutrient deprivation.  A single trial in Mumbai found that a daily snack containing leafy green 
vegetables, fruit and milk before and during pregnancy reduced the prevalence of gestational 
diabetes (to 7.3% in the intervention group compared with 12.4% in the control group) [[66]].  
Numerous studies have examined the impact of antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation 
on a range of health outcomes in high-risk populations in LMIC [67, 68] but the findings are 
disappointing. Systematic reviews of trials of multiple micronutrient supplementation during 
pregnancy, including over 88,000 women, have consistently shown modest effects on increasing 
birthweight, but no improvement in childhood survival, growth, body composition, blood pressure, 
respiratory or cognitive outcomes, compared with control groups receiving iron and folic acid 
supplementation only[69, 70]. 
 
Distinctions between HIC and LMIC have become blurred as many LMIC experience a demographic 
and obstetric transition [71] coupled with �western� lifestyles that foster obesity, while HIC 
populations already dominated by obesity commonly have poor nutrition and specific 
micronutrient deficiencies that go unrecognized until pregnancy.  Iron deficiency anaemia is a case 
in point: it is the most common deficiency globally affecting around 2 billion people and 30-50% of 
pregnant women [72], including young women in HIC [73].  Although iron supplementation in 
pregnancy reduces iron deficiency anaemia and improves haemoglobin levels at term, other 
benefits seem limited to a reduction in low birthweight [74].  Vitamin D deficiency, increasingly 
common among pregnant women in HIC, can lead to bone mineral deficiency in the developing 
child, and has been implicated, but with less certainty, in gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, low 
birthweight and preterm birth [75].  A subsequent trial of vitamin D supplementation during 
pregnancy showed that most women became vitamin D replete, but infant bone mineral content 
was not increased overall [76].  Further studies, such as the SPRING trial of vitamin D 
supplementation during pregnancy [77], are awaited.  
 
In summary, interventions to improve diet in pregnancy lead to modest reduction in gestational 
weight gain, but, with few exceptions [63], have not improved important maternal or newborn 
  
10 
health outcomes.  Micronutrient supplementation starting in pregnancy can correct important 
maternal nutrient deficiencies with modest effects on increasing birthweight, but no subsequent  
improvement in child health outcomes. Likely explanations include starting after early critical 
periods of fetal programming, and / or inadequate implementation, dose or adherence within this 
time frame to achieve significant biological influence.  In keeping with this hypothesis, one of the 
few supplementation trials starting before conception found no effect on birth weight unless 
provided at least 3 months before conception and to women who were not underweight ([78]).  To 
explore adherence to preconception supplementation, we analysed data from the Pune Rural 
Intervention in Young Adolescents (PRIYA) [8] study.  PRIYA is a randomised community-based trial 
of vitamin B12 supplementation before pregnancy in young women and men.  Adherence, assessed 
by pill counts, in this non-pregnant trial population was consistently high at around 80%.  While 
every effort should be made to correct micronutrient deficiencies in a women once pregnant, there 
is a growing consensus that the greatest gain will be achieved through a lifecourse approach or 
continuum of improved nutrition in children, adolescents and young women contemplating 
pregnancy (paper 3).  
 
Defining the preconception period  
 
The preconception period is often defined as the three months before conception, possibly because 
this is the average time to conception for fertile couples [79, 80] .  However, a time period before 
conception can only be identified after a woman has become pregnant.  Some definitions avoid this 
�������� ��� �������� �� ������� �� ��� ���� ����� �� ��� ����iation of any unprotected sexual 
����������� ���� ����� �������� ������ �� � ���������� [81], but they lack practical application.   
 
We therefore propose three new definitions or perspectives that relate to embryo development or 
point to action at an individual or population level.  From a biological perspective, there is a critical 
period spanning the weeks around conception when gametes mature, fertilisation occurs and the 
developing embryo forms. These are the events most sensitive to environmental factors such as the 
availability of macro- and micronutrients or exposure to smoking, alcohol, drugs or other 
teratogens (Paper 2).  For prevention of neural tube defects, a minimum of 4-6 weeks folic acid 
supplementation is required to reach adequate levels before neurulation begins three weeks after 
conception[13].   
  
In relation to individual action, the preconception period starts whenever a woman or couple 
decides they want to have a baby, as the time to conception is unknown.  Since about a third of 
fertile couples having regular sex without contraception will conceive within one month, [79, 80] 
optimising nutrition, including folic acid supplementation, should coincide with the decision to 
become pregnant. The preconception period may reflect the time required by individuals to 
achieve desired health outcomes in preparation for pregnancy, such as six or more months to attain 
a healthy BMI.  Maternal motivation to improve health at this stage can be strong.  In a recent pilot 
study, 54% of obese women attending a family planning clinic to have their contraceptive implant 
  
11 
or uterine device removed in order to become pregnant were willing to improve their 
preconception health by deferring removal of contraception for 6 months while they followed an 
intensive weight loss plan (Stephenson, unpublished data).  From a public health perspective, the 
preconception period can relate to a sensitive phase in the life course, such as adolescence, when 
health behaviours affecting diet, exercise and obesity, along with smoking and drinking, become 
established before the first pregnancy(paper 3).   
 
These perspectives can be combined into a conceptual framework of the preconception period 
(figure 1).  Benefits that can be achieved fairly rapidly, such as adequate folate levels, are indicated 
at 3 months before conception or whenever an individual first intends to become pregnant.  By 
contrast, substantial weight loss takes months or years to achieve, while the length of time to 
establish new dietary patterns is highly variable.  Together these findings point to the scale of the 
challenge in improving preconception health with vast room for improvement, particularly in 
nutritional status, and the need for intervention strategies at the population level to support action 
at the individual level. (figure 1).  
 
Pregnancy planning for preconception health  
 
Compelling evidence for early developmental programming (paper 2) and disappointment with 
micronutrient supplements and dietary interventions in pregnancy are shifting attention to the 
challenge of intervening before conception.  Awareness of the importance of health before 
pregnancy, some level of pregnancy planning and uptake of interventions before conception are 
distinct but related requirements for improving preconception health.  Qualitative research has 
identified three groups: women with high levels of pregnancy planning who take up interventions, 
women who plan but describe themselves as having poor awareness of preconception actions, and 
women for whom the preconception period has little meaning [82]. Different preconception care 
approaches are likely to be needed for each group (paper 3).  
 
Our analysis of new data from two preconception cohort studies shows mixed health behaviours 
reported in relation to pregnancy planning.  W���� ������� ��� ���������� were less likely to report 
smoking or drinking alcohol, and reported lower levels of caffeine consumption, but had a higher 
BMI, and reported lower levels of physical activity, and similar fruit and vegetable intake compared 
with women who were using contraception or not planning to become pregnant within the next 
year (table 2).  These associations were robust to adjustment for maternal level of educational 
attainment, age and parity.  In the Southampton Womens Study, education had a significant impact 
on the association between pregnancy status and fruit and vegetable intake before pregnancy.  
Women educated beyond the age of 16 years with an intended pregnancy were more likely to 
report eating five portions of fruit and vegetables than those who did not become pregnant and 
were not planning to (65% vs 57%); whereas no differences between these pregnancy intention 
groups were seen in women only educated to 16 years of age (46% vs 46%).  This suggests that 
more educated women may improve their diet once a decision has been made for pregnancy, but 
  
12 
less educated women do not� ������������� ��� ������ �� ������������ �� ������� ������� �� 
change their behaviours. 
 
Although numerous studies suggest that awareness of preconception health and care is low [83, 
84], �pregnancy planning� appears relatively common, indicating a missed and unexploited 
opportunity for intervention. [85, 86] Pregnancy planning has usually been estimated in surveys,

probe (variously) intentions, reactions to pregnancy, timing of pregnancy and family size desires.  
The most influential survey, the US National Survey of Family Growth[85] categorises pregnancy as 
intended, mistimed or unwanted, terms now widely adopted and included in the worldwide 
Demographic and Health Surveys[87]. A combination of all survey information has estimated that 
60% of the 213million pregnancies worldwide in 2012 were intended [86].  
 
In the last 20 years, the growing complexity of family formation patterns worldwide, awareness of 
��� ���� �� ����������� ������� ������������ ��� ��� ������������ �� ������������ 
methodology to measurement development have indicated the need for a more sophisticated 
measurement of pregnancy planning.  The London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) has 
been widely used[88], with nine validated language versions across seven countries, and more in 
progress [89-95]. Six questions produce a score 0-12, with higher scores indicating a more planned 
pregnancy. Use of the LMUP has shown that pregnancy planning, at various levels of intensity, is 
globally common, particularly among pregnancies leading to birth[10, 83, 89-94, 96, 97]  In 
providing a finer gradation of pregnancy planning, the LMUP is more reliable than previous tools, 
opening the door to improved prediction of health outcomes associated with pregnancy intention.  
Despite this, the global standard used in LMIC remains the single Demographic and Health Survey

become pregnant then, did you want to wait until later, or did you not want to have any (more) 
�������� �� ����� ���� ��������s categoris��� ������������� �� ����������� ���������� ��� 
���������� ���������� 
 
In a cohort study of pregnant women in Malawi [10], we compared the LMUP reported during 
pregnancy with the DHS question up to 16 months afterwards. Forty-five percent of women scored 
10 or more on the LMUP antenatally, showing that pregnancy planning is a relevant concept in a 
rural, low-income setting. The estimated prevalence of intended pregnancies was higher using the 
postnatal DHS question (69%, 95%CI 65% to 73%) than the antenatal LMUP (40%, 95%CI 36% to 
44%) in the same group of 623 women followed up at one year (Figure 3).  Previous studies have 
found higher reported intention over time for births[98] but these are the first data to document 
that this shift occurs within the first year postnatally.  This suggests a need for antenatal 
surveillance of pregnancy intention which would improve accuracy in assessing the scale of 
unplanned pregnancies and provide an opportunity to act antenatally to mitigate the adverse 
effects for the mother and child.  A measure such as the LMUP would also be sensitive enough to 
monitor changes in the rate of unplanned pregnancy over time and across population sub-groups.  
  
13 
Most initiatives to reduce unplanned pregnancy, such as Family Planning 2020 [99], rely on uptake 
of contraception as a proxy measure of impact, whereas the LMUP could provide a direct measure 
of the desired outcome.  
 
The frequency of pregnancy planning identified by the LMUP in both HIC and LMIC suggests 
considerable scope for intervention before pregnancy; the challenge is to identify women who are 
�������� � ���������� S����� ������ ����� �� ������������ ��� �Do you plan to have any (more) 
child��� �� ��� ���� �� ���� �������� is being promoted [100], but is likely to lack predictive validity; 
more nuanced measures that capture ambivalent intentions are required e.g. ��� �Desire to Avoid 
Pregnancy� (DAP) Scale, currently in development [101].  Robust measures such as the LMUP and 
DAP are opening up a largely unexplored area of research into how people plan and prepare for 
pregnancy, the associated health impacts and how health professionals can identify individuals  
planning a pregnancy.   
 
Summary  
 
A consistent picture is emerging of the importance of maternal health before conception and the 
key risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, one that blurs previous distinctions between HIC and 
LMIC.  A lifecourse model of critical periods, sensitive periods and cumulative effects fits well with 
current data linking preconception exposures to birth outcomes and risk of disease in later life.  The 
adverse consequences of poor nutrition combined with obesity, rife in women of reproductive age, 
extend across generations.  Dietary interventions starting in pregnancy can reduce weight gain and 
adiposity in obese women, but with little impact on pregnancy outcomes, while multiple 
micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy appears ���� ������� ��� ����� to fundamentally improve 
child health outcomes.  
 
Novel definitions of the preconception period that relate to embryo development (paper 2) or to 
opportunities for intervention may be useful.  Action to improve conditions around the critical time 
of conception requires a more systematic approach to identify women planning a pregnancy; 
efforts to do this are underway.  A healthy weight can take longer to achieve than dietary changes 
and should ideally become established during the sensitive period of adolescence when most 
women will not be planning pregnancy; this requires a population-level approach.  In general, 
though, a degree of pregnancy planning is common, in both LMIC and HIC, offering considerable 
scope for intervention before pregnancy.  Currently, pregnancy planning is associated with an 
inconsistent pattern of reported health behaviours; low awareness of the importance of health 
before pregnancy and possible actions to take may contribute to this.  To make a significant impact 
on preconception health, we need a dual strategy that improves nutritional status across the 
lifecourse and particularly during reproductive ages, while targeting all women who are thinking of 
conceiving.  How this might be achieved is considered in the third paper of the series.
