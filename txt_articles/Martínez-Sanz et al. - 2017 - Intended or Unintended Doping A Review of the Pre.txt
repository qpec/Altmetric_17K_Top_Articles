Abstract: Introduction: The use of dietary supplements is increasing among athletes, year after
year. Related to the high rates of use, unintentional doping occurs. Unintentional doping refers to
positive anti-doping tests due to the use of any supplement containing unlisted substances banned
by anti-doping regulations and organizations, such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The objective of this review is to summarize the presence of unlabeled doping substances in dietary
supplements that are used in sports. Methodology: A review of substances/metabolites/markers
banned by WADA in ergonutritional supplements was completed using PubMed. The inclusion
criteria were studies published up until September 2017, which analyzed the content of substances,
metabolites and markers banned by WADA. Results: 446 studies were identified, 23 of which fulfilled
all the inclusion criteria. In most of the studies, the purpose was to identify doping substances
in dietary supplements. Discussion: Substances prohibited by WADA were found in most of the
supplements analyzed in this review. Some of them were prohormones and/or stimulants. With
rates of contamination between 12 and 58%, non-intentional doping is a point to take into account
before establishing a supplementation program. Athletes and coaches must be aware of the problems
related to the use of any contaminated supplement and should pay special attention before choosing
a supplement, informing themselves fully and confirming the guarantees offered by the supplement.

1. Introduction
According to European Parliament Directive (2002/46/EC), a food supplement is defined as a
product intended to supplement the normal diet, consisting of a concentrated source of a nutrient
or of other substances that have a nutritional or physiological effect, in a simple or combined form,
commercialized in dosed formulas, capsules, tablets, pills and other similar forms, bags of powder,
vials of liquid, dropper bottles and other similar forms of liquids and powders, which is taken in
small, quantified amounts [1]. In sport—understood as a set of motor situations codified in the

form of competition, and institutionalized—athletes use ergogenic aids (any nutritional, physical,
mechanical, psychological, or pharmacological maneuver or method) in order to increase their ability
to perform physical work and improve performance [2]. In sport, dietary supplements (also known as
ergonutritional aids) have been used since the first Olympic Games, although recently there has been a
notable increase in their consumption by certain population groups [3–5]. Athletes consume a wide
variety of dietary supplements and are the main target of the industry that produces them [6]. The
“Sports Nutrition and Weight Loss Report”, published by the Nutrition Business Journal, showed that
sales of sports nutrition and weight loss products have increased year-on-year in the North American
market, with nutritional supplements being in second place in the sales ranking [7].
This indicates that the sale and consumption of supplements have increased both in the general
population and in the sports population. In a study of 3168 British Royal Army soldiers, a rate
of supplement use of 38% at the time of the study was reported, reaching 54% when the use of
supplements referred to the 12 months prior to the study [8]. In order of prevalence, the most used
supplements were: protein powders/bars (66%), isotonic sports drinks (49%), creatine (38%), recovery
drinks (35%), multivitamins (31%), and Vitamin C (25%). The work of Tscholl et al. was performed on
3887 athletes, and found a total consumption of 6523 supplements (1.7 per athlete) [9].
Some athletes have been reported to have tested positive for doping due to the intake of dietary
supplements, which had either poor labeling or product contamination [5,10]. This poses a threat to the
athlete�s career or also to his or her health depending on the dose, as the World Anti-Doping Agency
(WADA) states that it is the athlete�s responsibility to ensure no prohibited substance or its metabolite
or marker are in the samples [11]. An example of the presence of doping substances in supplements
can be seen in the study published in 2003 by Geyer et al., where 94 of the 634 supplements analyzed
(14.8%) had prohormones that were not mentioned on the label [12]. More current is the study by
Judkins et al. in which, of the 58 supplements analyzed, 25% contained low levels of contaminating
steroids and 11% were contaminated with stimulants [13]. These data have led to the investigation of
contamination in different food supplements; in most of them, small quantities of banned substances
have been found, due to cross-contamination during manufacturing, processing, or packaging [14–17].
In some cases, this contamination was not intentional and was due to poor quality control, but in
others the adulteration of the substance was intentional [10]. In the United States (US), the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), broadly speaking, regulates quality, and the Federal Trade Commission
supervises the marketing and advertising of dietary supplements [18]. However, according to the
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), dietary supplements, including nutritional
ergogenic aids, that are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, currently do not
need to be evaluated by the FDA prior to their commercialization [19].
Despite the proposed legislation and the pressure exerted by governments [20,21] and various
organizations, such as the WADA, through the list of prohibited substances and methods, or the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), with the acceptance of the World Anti-Doping Code [22,23],
positive tests continue to occur in anti-doping checks due to products containing prohibited substances
that are not listed in their labeling. One example is 19-norandrosterone, a substance found alongside
stimulants, such as caffeine and epinephrine, in certain dietary supplements [24]. In 2003, after
observing a series of repeated cases, a study was performed to determine the extent of the problem
of unidentified prohormones in dietary supplements, giving positive results for 19-norandrosterone
with the intake of only one capsule of product, while the proposed dose is four capsules, three times a
day [25]. More recently, in a review of 24 different types of protein supplement, carried out in 2010 by
ConsumerLab, 31% of products did not pass the proposed safety test, leaving in question the supposed
safety that these products offer the consumer [26].
Therefore, the objective of the present work is to describe the presence of doping substances
prohibited by the WADA in dietary supplements, used in the context of sport and published in research
articles, thereby highlighting the problem of plausible positive tests in anti-doping checks and the
health problems that could be generated by their unintended consumption.

2. Materials and Methods
This is a descriptive study, consisting of a bibliographic review of the presence of
substances/metabolites/markers prohibited by the WADA in dietary supplements used in the sporting
context. Contamination is understood as introduction into a medium of substances that cause it to
be unsafe or unfit for use; in our case, the incorporation and non-declaration in the labeling of
substances/metabolites/markers prohibited by WADA into ergonutritional supplements used by
athletes. A data collection protocol was established for the research that met the inclusion criteria. The
screening of the articles was performed by two researchers, independently.
A structured restrictive search was performed in the PubMed, Tripdatabase, and Epistemonikos
databases using controlled and natural vocabulary descriptors related to “doping agents” and
“Dietary supplements” concepts. The full electronic search strategy for PubMed was: (“prohibited
substance” [tiab (title/abstract)] or “banned substance” [tiab] or “banned substances” [tiab] or
“Doping in Sports” [Mesh] or “Doping in Sports” [tiab] or Doping [tiab] or “doping agent” [tiab]
or “doping agents” [tiab]) AND (“Dietary Supplements” [Mesh] or “Dietary Supplements” [tiab] or
“Dietary Supplement” [tiab] or Nutraceuticals [tiab] or Nutraceutical [tiab] or Nutriceutical [tiab] or
Nutriceuticals [tiab] or Neutraceutical [tiab] or Neutraceuticals [tiab] or “Food Supplementations”
[tiab] or “Food Supplementation” [tiab] or “Ergogenic aids” [tiab] or “Ergogenic aid” [tiab] or “dietary
supplement, SPORT” [Supplementary Concept] or “nutritional supplement” [tiab] or “nutritional
supplements” [tiab]). Also, relevant references related to the topic of the selected articles were searched
for manually, using a snow-ball method. No additional filters were applied, and the last search was
performed on 17 September 2017.
The eligibility criteria to select articles was:
•
Evaluation of marketed dietary supplements for intended use in sports
•
Evaluation of any type of prohibited substance, as defined by WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency.
2017 List of prohibited substances and methods. 2017 [22].)
•
Only primary research was allowed, but secondary research was screened (by bibliography)
•
No limits were set according language, years considered, or publication status or availability.
Two independent researchers screened titles and abstracts to pre-select studies from the list of
articles retrieved by the search strategy. One researcher screened the pre-selected articles, by full-text
reading, to apply eligibility criteria and a second researcher reviewed the selections, to ensure that all
studies should be included. One researcher performed the data extraction without piloted forms, but a
second researcher reviewed the extracted data to avoid extraction mistakes or missing information.
From selected studies, the extracted data set was composed of the following variables:
•
Author/year: authors and year of publication.
•
Country: geographical area from which the results obtained in the study come.
•
Aim of the study: results that were intended to be achieved with the study.
•
Sample: number and type of supplements analyzed.
•
Methodology for the analysis of banned substances/metabolites/markers.
•
Selected markers:
tested substances/metabolites/markers that give positive results in
anti-doping controls.
•
Main results: final outcomes of the study, in which it is shown whether the proposed objectives
have been achieved, and the main results obtained are listed.
•
Conclusions: arguments and statements concerning the data obtained in the studies.
No risk of bias analysis in the included studies was performed and data was summarized through
table summaries. No additional analysis was performed.

3. Results
The search strategy retrieved 446 articles (PubMed n = 378; Tripdatabase n = 67; Epistemonikos
n = 0; 1 added manually from a review screening), which resulted in 423 unique articles after duplicate
removal. After title and abstract screening, 54 titles were pre-selected, from which 23 were finally
included, after full-text reading and eligibility criteria was applied.
Table 1 shows the study variables of the bibliographic review. The articles that met the inclusion
requirements were published between 2000 and 2017. In regard to the countries of origin, six articles
came from Germany, three from the USA, two from Switzerland, United Kingdom and Poland, while
Belgium, Canada, Italy, Australia, Serbia, Czech Republic and South Africa contributed one article
each (column 1 of Table 1). Column 2 shows that the goal of most of the studies was to identify doping
substances (substances/metabolites/markers) in dietary supplements. Six studies determined whether
the intake of contaminated dietary supplements could result in a positive test in anti-doping controls.
The characteristics of the sample of supplements or study subjects are shown in column 3. Column 4
identifies the tested substances/metabolites/markers that give positive results in anti-doping controls.
Column 5 refers to the main results, and column 6 to the conclusions of the studies included in
the review.
Regarding the number of samples selected, more than 100 supplements were analyzed, when
considering all the articles incorporated in this review. In five of the studies included, it was the
subjects who had taken the substances of interest that were analyzed. In 13 of the 23 articles, more than
two contaminating substances were studied, while in three articles, two contaminants were studied
and in seven articles there was only a single substance under study. The contamination rate found in
studies where more than two ergonutritional supplements were analyzed, ranged from 12% to 58%.
While nine of the 10 studies that analyzed one or two supplements had rates of contamination of 100%,
in the study by Goel et al. [27], where a single supplement was analyzed, the results obtained showed
no contamination. In one of the 23 studies, the metabolic effects, produced two hours after the ingestion
of an ergonomic supplement, contaminated by 19-nor-4-androstenedione and 4-androsten-3,17-dione,
were identified after the collection of urine samples, for a total of five individuals. In five of the
23 studies, banned substances were sought in three specific supplements, by analyzing urine samples.
The most commonly used methodology for the detection of any unidentified substance or one
prohibited in ergonomic supplementation by any of the official bodies was gas chromatography
coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (n = 10), followed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) (n = 3), combined GC-MS + LC-MS (n = 2), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
(n = 2), HPLC-DAD (n = 1), UHPL-MS/MS (n = 1) and the modified Geyer method (n = 1).

Authors found that 11 of 12 brands
tested did not meet the labeling

contained 10 mg of testosterone, a
controlled steroid, another
contained 77% more than the label
stated, and 11 of 12 contained less
than the amount stated on the
label.
The current study validates the
concerns of physicians and
sporting organizations that the
labeling of some sports
nutritional supplements does
not accurately reflect what is
contained in the product. This
information may be helpful in
deterring athletes from using
substances that have
unsubstantiated efficacy and
unknown adverse effects.

In 7 out of 17 prohormones,
different substances than indicated
on the labels were found. This
corresponds to 41% of the products
in this class of supplements and 9%
of all analyzed supplements. In
two other products (“mental
enhancers”), caffeine and
ephedrine were found. Both
compounds were either not, or not
clearly declared, on the labels (e.g.,
declaration of the plant Ma Huang
that contains ephedrine). The
concentration of ephedrine in
product 56 was so high that an
athlete would test positive for
doping if only one capsule was
consumed just before competition.
It is recommended that athletes
use only supplements that are
registered in Switzerland (and
even these supplements may
not be entirely free of
contaminates). In light of the
easy availability of medicines
and nutritional supplements
through the Internet, we
should strive to inform and
educate users (especially
adolescents) about nutritional
supplements, and support
international standards for
accurate product labeling.

The approach is advantageous
as it minimizes sample

A total of 24 products
were purchased from
two fitness equipment

Anabolic steroids
Of the 24 products tested,
23 contained steroids,
including known anabolic
agents; sixteen of these
contained steroids that were
different to those indicated on
the packaging and one product
contained no steroids at all.
Overall, 13 different steroids
were identified; 12 of these are
controlled in the UK under the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
Several of the products
contained steroids that may be
considered to have
considerable pharmacological
activity, based on their
chemical structures and the
amounts present. This could
unwittingly expose users to a
significant risk to their health,
which is of particular concern
for naïve users.
The analytical methods used
can play an essential role in the
public health response to these
drugs by providing
methodologies to identify and
quantify the active substance(s)
present. This helps develop our
understanding of this market,
as well as allowing us to
monitor the composition of
supplements sold and the
hazards that they may pose.
When considered with other
data, such as prevalence of use,
these types of study play a
central role n assessing and
quantifying the risks to
individual and public health.

All 112 products did not
declare an androgen on the

Our findings show that 6/112
supplements had strong
androgenic bioactivity in the
yeast cell bioassay, indicating
products spiked or
contaminated with androgens.
The mammalian cell bioassay
confirmed the strong
androgenic bioactivity of 5/6
positive supplements.
Supplement 6 was metabolized
to weaker androgenic
bioactivity in the mammalian
cells. Further to this,
supplement 6 showed a
positive result in a yeast cell
progestin bioassay.
These findings highlight that
nutritional supplements, taken
without medical supervision,
could expose or predispose
users to the adverse
consequences of androgen
abuse. The findings reinforce
the need to increase the
awareness of the dangers of
nutritional supplements and
highlight the challenges that
clinicians face in the
fast-growing market of
nutritional supplements.

4. Discussion
Among the main findings of the present review is the presence of doping substances in studied
dietary supplements or aids, which are not substances identified in the nutritional composition
declared on the labeling, or whose amounts stated therein differ from their actual content. Among the
substances found, but not listed, on the label are prohormones, anabolic steroids, mental enhancers,
and 1,3-dimethylamylamine. All of these are substances that are prohibited by the WADA, which
would give a positive doping test result for the athletes who have consumed these supplements or
ergonutritional aids. Some of the studies analyzed the presence of contaminants in human subjects
after the consumption of contaminated supplements or ergonutritional aids; in other studies, the
products themselves were analyzed.
4.1. Consumption and Contamination of Ergonutritional Supplements
The consumption of ergonutritional supplements is one of the most common practices in the
sports world; advertisements for such products claim that their use will prevent injuries or enhance
performance [27]. They can be used by as many as 90% of participants, depending on the sport [28].
Linked to these high frequencies of consumption, we have found that one of the most serious and
increasingly frequent problems regarding the intake of dietary supplements is unintentional doping.
The consumption of these supplements forms part of the daily routine of most athletes, who must be
completely sure of the efficacy and safety of any type of dietary supplement before its consumption, as
well as of its detailed composition. The data reported by some studies are noteworthy; for instance,
the rate of contamination in ergonutritional supplements varied from 12% to 58% in samples analyzed
between 2002 and 2005, and in 216 cases, hormones were found in dietary supplements that should not
have contained them [17,29,30]. To avoid this, the controls and legislative strategies related to these
supplements need to be improved, to guarantee the safety of products that are freely available to the
general population and athletes.
Specifically, in the present review, all the papers included showed the presence of substances
that are prohibited by the WADA in some of the dietary supplements analyzed. The most frequently
encountered components in these products were anabolic steroids (banned by the IOC since 1974
after the positives detected at the Commonwealth Games held in New Zealand), although other
prohibited substances were also present—such as certain stimulants (ephedrine, nor-pseudoephedrine,
sibutramine) [11,31,32]. In addition to the serious effects that the consumption of these contaminated
substances can have on health—such as hepatotoxicity, cardiac and hormonal problems, carcinogenesis,
and even death in some cases [4,31]—the following can be added: social damage, related to
moral damage, loss of sponsors, and penalties (among others), deriving from possible detection
in doping tests.
The presence of substances not listed on labeling and banned by the WADA is not the only
problem derived from the consumption of supplements. The lack of precision in the labeling of these
products, in terms of quantity, is another of the problems associated with the consumption of such
substances, according to various studies [17,29,33–35].
This review of the literature indicated that the consumption of supplements occurs in a high
percentage of athletes, mainly driven by coaches, relatives, and other athletes, with the aim of achieving
better results. One of the most important studies regarding the consumption of supplements is the
one made by Tscholl et al. in 2010 [9], in which the data of 3887 questionnaires were collected during
the world championship of the International Association of Athletics Federations. This study showed
the consumption of 6523 supplements (1.7 per athlete); the consumption was greatest in adults and
in participants in outdoor competitions. A study of 567 Canadian athletes between the ages of 11
and 25 found daily intake of supplements by 28% of them, with the main goal being to improve the
consumption of vitamins and minerals and to improve performance [36]. Another study, involving 292
Portuguese athletes, from 13 different federations, showed a consumption rate of 66%, with an average
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1093
17 of 22
of four supplements per athlete, with acceleration of recovery (63%) and improvement of performance
(62%) being the main reasons for consumption [45].
It was from the year 2000 when the problems caused by unintentional doping began to take on
importance, and the first studies on the quality of nutritional supplements were carried out [17,46]. The
contamination rate due to errors in labeling, either by omission of substances present in the product,
or by errors in the quantification of the concentrations, is relatively high, according to the various
studies carried out [4,10,12,46–48]. One of the most relevant studies, due to the number of supplements
analyzed, which laid the groundwork for the determination of the contamination of nutritional
supplements, is that performed by Geyer et al., in 2001, in Germany, where 634 non-hormonal
supplements were analyzed in the search for testosterone and its prohormones, nandrolone and its
prohormones, and boldenone [12]. The results showed that 15% of the samples contained hormones or
prohormones that were not identified in the labeling. A similar study was conducted by Kamber et al.,
in 2001, in which the objective was the detection of anabolic steroids or stimulants, not indicated, or
poorly described, on the label [17]. The study analyzed 75 products, of which 17 were prohormonal
supplements, and all contained substances not described in the labeling. In 2004, a study was published,
in which 103 supplements, purchased online, and divided into four categories (creatine, prohormones,
mental enhancers, and branched-chain amino acids), were analyzed. In this case, the most common
contaminant was testosterone and the products with the highest contamination rate were prohormones.
The labeling error rate was 18%, whereas 20% of the products contained metabolites of different
hormones not allowed by the WADA [49].
Many of the studies involving contamination in supplements are aimed at validating a precise
method of analysis for the detection of compounds banned by entities, such as the World Anti-Doping
Association. An example of this is the study by Martello et al., in which gas chromatography
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) was used as a screening system to detect certain
androgenic steroids and ephedrine in dietary supplements. Thus, 64 nutritional supplements, obtained
from stores and by judicial procedures (and classified as four vitamins/mineral supplements, seven
glutamine/creatine, nine amino acids, 12 protein, eight prohibited substances, 12 herbal extracts and
four others) were analyzed. Through this method, anabolic steroids and ephedrine were detected in
12.5% of the analyzed samples [34].
Finally, the online expansion of the advertising and marketing of ergonutritional supplements
for sportsmen and women on the Internet has begun to constitute a public health problem. This
is due to the free sale of these products without the health authorities carrying out the necessary
inspections of the distribution and marketing. A study published by Van Poucke in 2006 analyzed 19
dietary supplements obtained via the internet. Fifteen of these claimed, on the labeling, the presence
of between one and five prohormones, but 11 supplements were suspected of containing at least one
anabolic steroid. Liquid chromatography showed that all the suspect substances contained at least
one anabolic steroid, with testosterone and b-boldenone being the banned substances with the highest
rates of use [31].
As for the factors causing this contamination, there are two main causes: (1) cross-contamination
and (2) intentional contamination. Cross-contamination occurs unintentionally, as described by Hon
and Coumans, because the prohormone concentration is low, which would not produce a potentiating
effect of the supplement [16]. This occurs mainly because the manufacturers of prohormones (sold
legally as supplements in the United States until 2004) also make other nutritional supplements.
Cross-contamination could be due to the lack of cleaning of the vitamin containers, since the same
production line is used without sufficient cleaning of the machinery [4,10]. The consumption of
supplements affected by cross-contamination, despite the low concentration of contaminants, can lead
to cases of unintentional doping [17]. Intentional contamination occurs when high concentrations
of prohormones are added to the supplement by the manufacturer, with the aim of enhancing its
effects [46].
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1093
18 of 22
Geyer et al. analyzed the number of nutritional supplements subject to cross-contamination with
prohormones in different countries, between 2001 and 2002. The United States and Germany were the
countries with the highest production of supplements, although The Netherlands and Austria had the
highest contamination rates in their products [48].
4.2. Anti-Doping Organizations
Because of this, mechanisms of action have been put in place to combat contamination in
supplements. The purpose is to produce a reliable source of information in which the athlete can
check the safety of the supplement to be consumed [50]. The WADA, one of the main bodies that
deals with the detection and prevention of doping in athletes, has established a strict liability policy,
which states that unintentional doping is the responsibility of the athlete. Therefore, even if the athlete
had no intention of improving his/her performance through the use of prohibited substances, if a
doping control proves positive due to the use of contaminated ergonutritional supplements, it is the
athlete, not the manufacturer or the seller, on whom the established sanction would fall. To avoid this
type of situation, the WADA publishes—via the internet—the novelties and adverse findings for the
supplements analyzed by its accredited laboratories. Other entities, such as the Court of Arbitration for
Sport (TAS) [51], make athletes aware of registered doping cases and provide information regarding
the possible source of the prohibited substance. Contributions are also made by National Anti-Doping
Organizations (NADOs), such as that of Australia (ASADA) [52]—which offers an online search tool
(Global DRO) to athletes and support personnel, to find out whether the most commonly prescribed
and over-the-counter medicines in Australia are permitted or prohibited in their sport. Two other
organizations pursuing similar strategies are the UK Anti-Doping Authority (UKAD) [53] and the
US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) [54]. In addition, there are other ways to check the safety of
ergonutritional supplements, unofficially and without being endorsed by the WADA or the respective
NADO—such as the Anti-Doping Authority the Netherlands (NZVT) project in Holland [55], the
Cologne List in Germany [56], Informed Sports in the UK [57], the NSF Certified for Sports program of
the Canadian Center for Sports Ethics [58], the Drug-free Sport NZ application of the New Zealand
Anti-Doping Agency [59], the Supplement 411 program of USADA [60], or the “Alerts” section of the
website of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of Health in Sport (AEPSAD) [61].
4.3. Limitations
Some limitations of this review, inherent in the use of electronic searches and retrieval of
documents, should be pointed out. One of the most important limitations is that not all papers
included analyzed the same prohibited compounds neither the same kind of samples, so several
prohibited substances not analyzed could be also present in those products.
5. Conclusions
The safety issue regarding dietary supplements is real and therefore an improvement of the
current legislation regulating the market for dietary supplements is needed to ensure the safety,
efficacy, potency, and legality of the available ergonutritional supplements. Hence, the awareness of
both athletes and coaches of the possible consequences of the use of ergonutritional supplements is
especially important, as are discussions of the advantages and disadvantages and the provision of
information related to the safety, provenance, and effectiveness of any type of supplement, before its
consumption. The use of supplements without a specific need, illness, or deficiency—in addition to
not being recommended—is unnecessary, when the athlete is following a balanced and adapted diet.
Despite the strategies implemented by different governmental agencies to avoid doping in athletes,
some positive doping results might be non-intentional and caused by the consumption of dietary
supplements contaminated with doping substances.
Likewise, the fact that, in these products, information is often omitted from the labeling is a reason
for sanctioning the companies that manufacture these food substances—since they are providing
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1093
19 of 22
inaccurate or incomplete data—in accordance with Spanish Law 28/2015, for the defense of food
quality [62]. This shows non-compliance with food labeling legislation, intended to protect the quality,
the regulator of which is the government.
Although our work shows the existence of several dietary supplements on sale containing
prohibited substances, more comprehensive studies are needed to know the extent and the prevalence
of this problem.
Therefore, the previously described factors that affect food quality could be considered as an
avoidable public health problem that indicates the need for governments to establish control strategies
for procedures throughout the food chain, to generate a high level of confidence in dietary supplements
which are habitually consumed by athletes. Likewise, compliance with the general principle of veracity
and demonstration of the information contained in the labeling of ergonutritional products, must
be guaranteed.
