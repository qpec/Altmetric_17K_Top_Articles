Powassan virus (POWV) lineage II is an emerging tick-
borne flavivirus with an unknown seroprevalence in hu-
mans. In a Lyme disease–endemic area, we examined the 
seroreactivity to POWV in 2 patient cohorts and described 
the clinical features of the POWV-seroreactive patients. 
POWV disease might be less neuroinvasive than previ-
ously thought.
P
owassan virus (POWV) lineage II, also known as 
deer tick virus, is an emerging tickborne flavivirus (1) 
transmitted by Ixodes scapularis ticks, which are also the 
primary vector for Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease 
pathogen). In POWV-endemic regions, up to 7% of ticks 
carry the virus, and seroprevalence among small mamma-
lian hosts can exceed 90% (2,3). Because the territory of I. 
scapularis is expanding and the prevalence of POWV in 
ticks and mammals is increasing, POWV poses an increas-
ing threat (2–5). The seroprevalence of POWV in humans 
in some regions of North America is known (range 0.5%–
3.3%), but because the geographic distribution is quite ex-
tensive, the seroprevalence of most at-risk populations is 
uncertain (6). 
POWV is typically detected with an IgM antibody 
capture ELISA or an IgM immunofluorescence antibody 
(IFA) assay. Cases are confirmed by >90% or >50% 
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90 or PRNT50), 
detection of virus-specific nucleic acids, isolation in cul-
ture, or a >4-fold increase in antibody titers from paired 
acute and convalescent sera (7–9). Using these assays, in-
vestigators have identified ≈100 cases of POWV encepha-
litis; however, the actual incidence is likely higher (1,6). 
Although nonneuroinvasive disease has been described 
for other arboviral illnesses, our knowledge of POWV 
has been limited to patients with neuroinvasive disease 
(1,8,10,11). In this study, we evaluated the seroreactivity 
for POWV in US Midwest patients, many of whom did 
not have neuroinvasive disease.
The Study
We selected patients with suspected tickborne disease 
(TBD; n = 95) and patients undergoing routine chemical 
screening (n = 50) who sought treatment during July–Au-
gust 2015 at the Marshfield Clinic in northern Wisconsin, 
a TBD-endemic area. Patients were considered to have 
suspected TBD if a serologic test for B. burgdorferi was 
ordered. The chemical screening cohort included patients 
who had a complete metabolic or lipid panel ordered as 
part of their clinical care. We evaluated POWV seroreac-
tivity of specimens from these patient cohorts and, of the 
patients with serologic evidence of POWV infection and 
available clinical data, described the clinical features of 
their disease. All human subject research protocols were 
approved by the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute In-
stitutional Review Board.
We performed screening assays on all specimens for 
tick-borne encephalitis virus complex (TBEV-C) and B. 
burgdorferi and performed POWV serology on TBEV-
C–positive specimens (Figure; detailed methods in on-
line Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/23/8/16-1971-Techapp1.pdf). To evaluate heter-
ologous flavivirus cross-reactivity, we performed the West 
Nile virus (WNV) enzyme immunoassay (EUROIMMU, 
Mountain Lakes, NJ, USA) with TBEV-C–positive sam-
ples. We also performed the Flavivirus Mosaic Panel (EU-
ROIMMUN), an IgG IFA assay panel including tests for 
TBEV, WNV, yellow fever virus, dengue viruses 1–4, and 
Japanese encephalitis virus, on samples positive for POWV 
IgG by the IFA assay. Patient vaccination status and travel 
history were also considered.
Clinical data were available for 51 (53.7%) TBD 
patients and 50 (100%) patients with routine chemistry 
screening completed. For those with clinical data avail-
able, we classified their cases as probable or confirmed by 
using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case

¶Cross-reactivity on POWV IgG IFA assay is consistent with a history of West Nile virus infection. 
 
  Powassan Virus Infection and Lyme Disease
antibodies are often not present during early infection (12). 
The 2 patients screened by chemical methods who were pos-
itive for POWV IgG failed to show neutralization by PRNT; 
however, rather than PRNT50, we used POWV PRNT90, 
which has greater specificity but lower sensitivity. In addi-
tion, our PRNT was based on POWV lineage I; thus, our 
test was potentially less sensitive at detecting POWV lineage 
II–specific antibodies and thus less capable of detecting pre-
vious POWV lineage II infection.
Similar to other flavivirus serologic assays, consider-
able cross-reactivity occurred with the Flavivirus Mosaic 
IgG IFA assay (online Technical Appendix Table) (13). 
The fluorescence intensity was stronger for TBEV than it 
was for other flaviviruses in all TBD patients except for 
1 patient with prior confirmed WNV infection. Both pa-
tients with routine chemistry screening completed who were 
POWV IgG–positive were TBEV IgM–positive. Neither 
had a history of yellow fever or dengue virus exposure or 
vaccination, although the panel showed cross-reactivity 
with these viruses.
Evidence of current or prior B. burgdorferi infection 
was present in 63 (66.3%) TBD patients and 4 (8%) patients 
with routine chemistry screening completed (p<0.0001). Of 
the 41 (43.2%) TBD patients with evidence of B. burgdor-
feri infection, 7 (17.1%) had serologic evidence of acute 
POWV infection and 3 (7.3%) had laboratory-confirmed 
POWV infection. When controlling for differences in sero-
prevalence rates of B. burgdorferi, no statistical differences 
were evident for POWV seroprevalence (p = 1.0) or con-
firmed infections (p = 1.0) between patients with routine 
chemistry screening completed and TBD patients, although 
the study was underpowered in this regard.
B. burgdorferi IgM was detected in 6 (85.7%) of the 
7 patients with serologic evidence of acute POWV infec-
tion, suggesting concurrent infection, which is consis-
tent with surveillance data indicating that POWV and B. 
burgdorferi co-infect I. scapularis ticks (2,3). The rate 
of concurrent antibodies we report is higher than that 
described for regions of Europe endemic for TBE and 
Lyme disease (14).
Clinical data were available for 7 of the patients with 
serologic evidence of POWV infection (Table 2). Infection 
probably occurred in 3 patients. A laboratory-confirmed 
nonacute infection was found in a patient (patient no. 2) 
who did not meet Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion criteria. Patient symptoms could not be attributed spe-
cifically to POWV because all TBD patients with clinical 
data available were positive for B. burgdorferi antibodies, 
and testing for the possibility of infection with additional 
endemic tick pathogens was performed for only 2 patients.
Consistent with previous studies showing increased 
susceptibility of children to arboviral diseases, 3 patients 
 
who might have had POWV infection were children 
 
(Table 2) (15). Fever was present in all patients with evi-
dence of POWV acute infection; other common symp-
toms were fatigue, malaise, fussiness, listlessness, and 
headache. Complete blood cell count and C-reactive 
protein did not indicate severe infection. Consistent with 
other arboviral diseases, urticarial or maculopapular 
rash was documented in 3 patients (15). No patients had 
neuroinvasive disease.
This study had limitations. Similar to other serolog-
ic studies, cross-reactivity and prior exposure to POWV 
cannot be completely excluded in serologically positive 
cases. Analysis for other flaviviruses, prior yellow fe-
ver virus vaccination, and history of travel to dengue-
endemic regions, as well as PRNT, were completed to 
address this concern. The study population was limited 
to persons in the US upper Midwest, although POWV is 
likely an increasing problem throughout the territory I. 
scapularis ticks occupy. Our study results might not be 
applicable to these other regions.
Conclusions
In a Lyme disease–endemic area, POWV seroreactiv-
ity and confirmed POWV infection were present. The 
spectrum of disease is broader than previously realized, 
with most patients having minimally symptomatic infec-
tion (1,10,11). Further studies are needed to character-
ize clinical disease of POWV monoinfection, document 
POWV seroprevalence in humans, and monitor epide-
miologic trends.
