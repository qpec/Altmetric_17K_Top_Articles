Summary
Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30–40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury.
It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively
trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal sur-
gery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney
disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute
kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modi-
fiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and
appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal
complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate
analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on
the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney
injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

Introduction
Some of the earliest observations of the effects of
anaesthesia on renal function were made over a cen-
tury ago [1, 2]. Initial reports described the effects of
ether anaesthesia where, following induction, a marked
increase in both urine output and non-protein nitro-
gen excretion was noted. However, after 90 min of
anaesthesia, both parameters had decreased to just
3.6% and 2.2% of baseline, respectively. At 24 h post-
operatively, recovery to 43% and 84% of baseline was
observed, with earlier recovery of secretory rather than
nitrogenous excretory function. The authors concluded
that “We cannot but think that in cases of prolonged
ether anaesthesia, this inhibition of renal activity must
exercise a most injurious effect on the general metabo-
lism and condition of the patient” [2]. Although both
anaesthetic agents and techniques have evolved since
1905, the potentially deleterious effects of anaesthesia
on renal function remain. Historically, the comparison
of studies investigating kidney impairment, particularly
in the acute setting, was complicated by the hetero-
geneity in defining ‘acute renal failure’, but this prob-
lem
was
addressed
with
the
introduction
of
the
concept
of
acute
kidney
injury
(AKI)
[3].

 development of AKI, as defined by observed changes
in serum creatinine (SCr) and/or urine output, is now
known to be a significant cause of both morbidity and
mortality, and when severe enough to require renal
replacement therapy (RRT), the observed mortality
approaches 46% [4, 5]. The subsequent definitions of
AKI proposed by the Kidney Disease Improving Glo-
bal
Outcomes
(KDIGO)
group
in
2011
provided
greater clarity, and are now generally accepted as the
standard definitions of AKI (Table 1) [6].
Acute kidney injury may complicate up to 20% of
all hospital admissions and is recognised as a major
complication of surgery, with approximately 30–40% of
cases of hospital-acquired AKI occurring in the peri-
operative setting [7, 8]. Moreover, the development of
AKI in the peri-operative period is associated with
increased risks of sepsis, coagulopathy and prolonged
mechanical ventilation [9]. The incidence of AKI post-
operatively depends in part on the surgery, but in a large
US study, postoperative AKI occurred in 11.8% of
161,185 patients who underwent major surgery [10]. Of
these, 76% were AKI stage 1, 15% stage 2 and 9% stage
3, of whom approximately 35% required RRT. As well
as being a relatively common occurrence, the develop-
ment of postoperative AKI translates into a significant
mortality risk. For example, Kheterpal et al. described
an eight-fold increase in mortality in patients with peri-
operative AKI [11]. Furthermore, a recent systematic
review, describing AKI outcomes in 82,514 patients
undergoing abdominal surgery, found a pooled inci-
dence of AKI of 13.4% (95%CI 10.9–16.4%), with a
12.6-fold relative risk of death in the presence of postop-
erative AKI (95%CI 6.8–23.4) [12]. Non-renal postoper-
ative complications were also more frequent, and
lengths of stay longer in patients with AKI. Not only is
mortality higher in patients with peri-operative AKI, but
even after apparent complete renal recovery, patients
who developed AKI are at increased risk of developing
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal dis-
ease (ESRD) [13].
Who is at risk of renal complications?
Many factors influence the potential development of
renal
complications
in
the
peri-operative
period.
Despite the heterogeneity in terms of potential patho-
physiology, there is a degree of consistency across sur-
gical specialties with regard to risk factors for AKI, as
outlined in Table 2. Common risk factors include the
presence of vascular disease, CKD, hypertension, car-
diac failure and diabetes, all of which are strongly
associated with postoperative AKI [14]. However, the
incidence of AKI is also procedurally related. Cardio-
vascular surgery, for example, has been extensively
studied with regard to postoperative AKI, and inci-
dence rates as high as 30% have been reported [9].
Cardiopulmonary bypass is a particular contributor
and is associated with many potentially injurious
insults to the kidney, including ischaemia–reperfusion
injury, micro-embolic phenomena, decreased renal per-
fusion pressure and haemodilution [15]. In aortic sur-
gery, mechanical obstruction to blood flow can occur
during arterial cross-clamping, though more transient
obstruction to venous or arterial flow may be seen
with
other
abdominal
surgeries.
Non-renal
organ
transplant surgery also carries a significant risk of
postoperative AKI. In orthotopic liver transplantation,
for example, AKI rates of 25–60% have been observed,
and in a single-centre study, AKI occurred in 50% of
patients, and was associated with a reduction in 90-
day survival of nearly 9% [16]. Intraperitoneal surgery
in general, and particularly small bowel resection, is
also associated with increased risk of postoperative

 AKI [11, 17]. Although laparoscopic techniques in
general are associated with a lower risk of postopera-
tive AKI, pneumoperitoneum still carries a risk of
renal injury, with high insufflation pressures associated
with oliguria, and with anuria being induced at around
30 mmHg. This is not only because of the effects on
central venous vasculature, but also due to renal
parenchymal compression [18]. The timing of surgery
also plays a role, with emergent surgery carrying the
greatest risk of postoperative AKI [11, 17]. The degree
of intra-operative blood loss has also been associated
with increased postoperative AKI, as has red cell trans-
fusion [19]. Moreover, patients who are bleeding may
have been exposed to potential nephrotoxins such as
intravascular contrast agents, which may also con-
tribute to the development of AKI; however, the risk
of contrast-associated AKI should not delay diagnostic
imaging [20].
Minimising the risk of renal
complications of anaesthesia
Much is published about the anaesthetic management
of patients with existing renal impairment, and a thor-
ough pre-operative assessment should alert the anaes-
thetist to the presence of CKD, or indeed the presence
of AKI. Subsequent measures should be taken to
minimise risks or potential complications resulting
from the patients’ altered pharmacodynamics, potential
for drug interaction(s) and comorbidities. The patho-
physiology of postoperative AKI is diverse, with con-
siderable interactions; less commonly discussed are
renal complications relating directly or indirectly to
anaesthesia. This may be related to a single cause but
is more likely to be multifactorial in nature (Fig. 1).
The potential to ameliorate renal injury will depend
on the nature of the insult, together with the potential
risk factors, which may either be fixed or modifiable.
Non-modifiable risk factors
Some risk factors are fixed and offer little in terms of
modifiable actions, particularly acutely; these include
age, the presence of CKD, cardiovascular comorbidities
and obesity. As discussed, the incidence of postopera-
tive AKI varies considerably depending on the type of
surgery, and there are increasing data available regard-
ing AKI in non-cardiac surgery settings [21]. A retro-
spective analysis of over 160,000 patients in the United
States with AKI defined by KDIGO criteria demon-
strated unadjusted incidences of AKI ranging from
4.1% for ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery to 18.7%
for cardiac surgery [10]. Relative risks (RR) for the
development of AKI using general surgical patients as

 a reference were cardiac surgery (RR 1.22; 95%CI
1.17–1.27); thoracic surgery (RR 0.92; 95%CI 0.87–
0.98); orthopaedic surgery (RR 0.70; 95%CI 0.67–0.73);
vascular surgery (RR 0.68; 95%CI 0.64–0.71); urology
(RR 0.65; 95%CI 0.61–0.69); and ENT surgery (RR
0.32; 95%CI 0.28–0.37). This is in keeping with other
previously reported studies [8, 11]. Although risk scor-
ing systems have been devised to aid in identifying
surgical patients at highest risk, outside of cardiac sur-
gery these perform poorly, as risk stratification has
been hampered by variable definitions of AKI and
inconsistent outcomes [14]. A recent systematic review
of risk prediction models following non-cardiac sur-
gery found currently available models lacked external
validation and robust impact analyses, and recom-
mended that further data were needed before clinical
use could be recommended [22].
Modifiable risk factors
Although the treatment of established AKI is, at pre-
sent, principally supportive in nature, there are several
strategies that may be adopted which have the poten-
tial to minimise renal complications [20]. These are
summarised in Fig. 2.
The pre-operative approach
The pre-operative visit offers the anaesthetist a chance
to intervene to mitigate the risk of developing postop-
erative AKI. Minimising fasting is known to be benefi-
cial, as fasting induces metabolic stress, and impairs
mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity, the con-
sequences of which may increase the risk of postopera-
tive AKI [23]. Pre-operative volume resuscitation may
be necessary to avoid hypovolaemia-associated kidney
injury, and nephrotoxic medications should be stopped
where possible. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
contribute to intra-operative hypotension and reduce
glomerular
perfusion
pressure,
and
consideration
should be given to stopping these on the day of sur-
gery, and their administration should be reviewed reg-
ularly postoperatively. However, evidence is lacking for
this approach, and the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines sug-
gest continuing ACE-I peri-operatively. Patients taking
b-blockers may be at risk of intra-operative hypoten-
sion and bradycardia, and in those with rate-depen-
dent
cardiac
outputs
or
other
risk
factors,
consideration may be given to suspending these [24].

 should be balanced against the potential for AKI and
the presence of other risk factors, as there is, for exam-
ple, evidence for an increased incidence of AKI in
patients
undergoing
hip
arthroplasty
where
these
agents are used to provide analgesia [25].
The intra-operative approach
Cardiovascular
Avoiding intra-operative hypotension is paramount, as
hypotension is an independent risk factor for postop-
erative AKI through renal hypoperfusion and subse-
quent
reduction
in
medullary
blood
flow.
Most
patients with postoperative AKI have had an episode
of peri-operative haemodynamic instability at some
stage
[26].
A
retrospective
study
of
over
33,000
patients
examining
the
association
between
intra-
operative mean arterial pressure (MAP), postoperative
AKI and myocardial injury, found an incidence of
postoperative AKI of 7.4%. The cut-off MAP for
increasing risk of postoperative AKI and myocardial
injury was 55 mmHg. Unsurprisingly, the AKI risk
increased with the duration of MAP < 55 mmHg, with
a period of hypotension of over 20 min having a
relative
risk
of
1.51
(95%CI
1.24–1.84)
[27–29].
Increased mortality was demonstrated with ≥ 20 min
of MAP less than 55 mmHg, but no interaction with
the pre-operative MAP was noted, suggesting that
absolute, not relative, MAP values could be used. In
addition, prolonged periods of MAP ≤ 65 mmHg may
increase
postoperative
AKI
risk.
The
association
between AKI and intra-operative hypotension appears
to be a consistent finding [28, 29]. While the MAP is
important, low diastolic arterial perfusion pressures
that activate the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
and increase anti-diuretic hormone levels are also
related to the progression of AKI in cardiac surgery
patients [30].
In
addition
to
minimising
anaesthesia-related
hypotension through appropriate anaesthetic agent use,
therapeutic options for the treatment of hypotension
continue to be either fluids or vasopressors or ino-
tropes. Goal-directed fluid therapy should probably be
considered in patients at high risk of developing post-
operative AKI and in patients undergoing high-risk
surgery, although the literature is not clear. A meta-
analysis of haemodynamic optimisation found both

 AKI and mortality were reduced when using fluid
optimisation with inotropes [31]. However, a recent
post-hoc analysis of the POM-O randomised con-
trolled trial found that the use of intra-operative nora-
drenaline and persistent lactataemia were associated
with postoperative creatinine rises, whereas goal-direc-
ted therapy did not prevent AKI [32]. One advantage
of goal-directed fluid therapy is the avoidance of vol-
ume overload, as this is associated with both increased
AKI and mortality, while more appropriately timed
fluid is associated with reduced AKI and use of inotro-
pic agents [33]. Given the impact of hypotension on
postoperative AKI, the judicious use of vasopressors to
counteract intra-operative hypotension is appropriate.
Noradrenaline has been shown to improve renal blood
flow, glomerular filtration rate and urine output. Vaso-
pressin may have some potential benefit over nora-
drenaline, but definitive outcome benefits have not
been shown. Low-dose dopamine is no longer consid-
ered to be reno-protective and is not recommended
for the treatment of AKI [20].
Respiratory
Reduction in renal function with ‘pressure-breathing’
in healthy volunteers was noted 70 years ago, with
reduced function continuing for several hours follow-
ing cessation of ventilation [34]. More recently, the
multifactorial nature of the effects of mechanical venti-
lation
of
the
lungs
on
renal
function
has
been
described, with the detrimental effects of hypercap-
noea, hypoxia and cardiac output noted. Indeed, a
recent systematic review found that mechanical venti-
lation was associated with a three-fold increase in the
odds of developing AKI. However, there was a high
degree of heterogeneity in the included trials, and fur-
ther work is necessary to elucidate specific strategies to
minimise the postoperative AKI risk from ventilation
[35]. In animal models, the impact of ventilation
appeared greatest in the presence of generalised sepsis,
and protective ventilation may be helpful even in the
absence of any acute lung injury (ALI) [36]. A prag-
matic approach in high-risk surgical patients would be
to adopt low tidal volume ventilation settings of 5–
7 ml.kg�1, using optimal PEEP settings as determined
by oxygenation and compliance, together with the
avoidance of hypoxia and hypercarbia.
Vascular
Although not a direct result of anaesthesia, cholesterol
embolisation syndrome is an under-recognised cause
of AKI. Embolisation may occur spontaneously, but is
more common during interventions that disrupt the
plaque surface, such as arteriography and vascular sur-
gery, and results in ischaemic end-organ damage
through a combination of mechanical plugging and
inflammation in the target arteries. Risk factors are
similar to AKI and include male sex, hypertension,
smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes and aortic
aneurysm [37]. Classically characterised by a triad of
renal failure, livedo reticularis and eosinophilia, it can
also present atypically with fever, myalgia and multi-
organ derangement [38]. Estimates of the incidence of
cholesterol embolisation syndrome resulting from vas-
cular procedures have ranged from 0.15% in clinical
studies to 25–30% in autopsy series [39]. This probably
means that cholesterol embolisation syndrome occurs
in a subtle form following intravascular procedures
more often than is picked up by clinical presentation
[40]. There is no specific treatment for cholesterol
embolisation
syndrome,
with
supportive
measures
including modifications of risk factors, statins and
antiplatelet agents together with utilisation of surgical
and endovascular techniques to reduce sources of
cholesterol emboli.
Anaesthetic technique
There are limited data comparing regional (RA) and
general anaesthesia (GA) in terms of renal protection.
In a retrospective study of open abdominal aortic sur-
gery patients, those given intrathecal morphine devel-
oped less AKI than those given systemic analgesia or
those treated with thoracic epidurals, although con-
founding factors included disparity in volume and
pressor usage [41]. Subsequent studies in endovascular
aneurysm repair did not replicate any beneficial effect
of RA over GA for preventing postoperative AKI [17].
The largest study to date is a matched analysis of over
260,000 GA cases and over 64,000 RA cases on the
National
Surgical
Quality
Improvement
Program
(NSQIP) database [42]. No beneficial effect of one

 of other peri-operative complications. Interestingly, the
first non-flammable halogenated volatile anaesthetic,
methoxyflurane,
was
associated
with
significant
nephrotoxicity through inorganic fluoride formation
[43]. However, it is now accepted that not only is
sevoflurane clinically not nephrotoxic, volatile anaes-
thetics exhibit multi-organ protective effects following
ischaemic or inflammatory injury in the peri-operative
period. Moreover, pre-treatment with volatile agents
appears to be protective through so-called anaesthetic
preconditioning [44]. In terms of biological plausibility,
volatile anaesthetics are known to activate several
pathways involved in production of cytoprotective and
anti-inflammatory signalling molecules, which may
reduce renal ischaemia–reperfusion injury seen in sur-
gical procedures such as organ transplant, cardiac and
vascular surgery [45]. To date, the evidence that vola-
tile anaesthetics provide renal protection is somewhat
mixed. A recent systematic review of patients undergo-
ing cardiac surgery suggested benefit, but the studies
were confounded by a lack of homogeneity in AKI
reporting; although a positive effect on postoperative
serum creatinine was observed, there was no effect on
hard end points such as RRT [46].
Glycaemic control
Although the use of intensive insulin therapy to
achieve tight control of glucose levels has fallen from
favour given safety concerns, there is certainly evidence
that hyperglycaemia may increase the risk of postoper-
ative AKI [47]. Increasingly, evidence seems to suggest
that glycaemic variability is an independent variable
for both AKI and mortality in a variety of clinical set-
tings, including cardiac surgery [48]. Given these data,
it would seem prudent to avoid sustained hypergly-
caemia and avoid rapid alterations in blood sugar
through regular monitoring in high-risk groups.
Musculoskeletal
Muscle injury leading to AKI through rhabdomyolysis
classically results from trauma such as following crush
injury, but may also complicate prolonged immobilisa-
tion or compartment syndrome [49]. Other causes
include both prescribed and illicit drugs, and rarer
causes such as malignant hyperpyrexia and congenital
susceptibilities.
The
breakdown
of
striated
muscle
ultimately progressing to myocyte necrosis causes AKI
in approaching 50% of patients with rhabdomyolysis
through renal vasoconstriction, intraluminal cast for-
mation and direct cytotoxicity, induced by haem pro-
tein [50]. Anaesthesia masks the pain and paraesthesia
of prolonged muscle compression that would alert the
conscious
patient,
and
rhabdomyolysis
has
been
reported in patients undergoing surgical procedures in
whom pressure necrosis of muscle occurs from posi-
tioning. Lengthy procedures (> 4 h) and high BMI,
together with hypotensive anaesthesia, are significant
risk factors, and tourniquet use has also been associ-
ated with rhabdomyolysis. Prompt detection and man-
agement may reduce the severity of the insult, but
require a high index of suspicion; prompt volume
resuscitation is the mainstay of treatment, along with
identification and reversal of the underlying cause of
muscle injury. This may include: stopping potentially
harmful drugs; patient temperature control; and treat-
ment of infection. Various intravenous fluids have
been used to treat rhabdomyolysis, but no randomised
controlled trials have demonstrated superiority of one
regime over another. Although RRT is used to treat
established AKI secondary to rhabdomyolysis, there is
scant evidence to suggest improved outcomes in pre-
venting rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI over and above
conventional treatment. In part, this reflects the poor
methodological quality of reported studies and lack of
data relating to clinically important outcomes [51].
The postoperative approach
The immediate postoperative management of patients
at significant risk of postoperative AKI follows the
same principles as outlined above, namely preservation
of renal perfusion pressure, appropriate volume resus-
citation and avoidance of potential nephrotoxins. Con-
sideration should be given to utilising level-1 or -2
postoperative care facilities where appropriate, as close
monitoring and early treatment may help prevent pro-
gression of AKI, given that several postoperative com-
plications are associated with renal dysfunction [52].
The effects of postoperative haemorrhage, sepsis, and
acute cardiac dysfunction should be mitigated through
prompt diagnosis and management, and recognition of
rhabdomyolysis and intra-abdominal hypertension will
improve outcomes. Renal tract imaging should be

 considered for those in whom obstruction may be a
contributing factor to AKI. Where severe AKI devel-
ops, then management should be targeted towards
minimising the acute sequelae, such as metabolic aci-
dosis, symptomatic uraemia and hyperkalaemia, and
where necessary, this may require RRT. Given that
AKI is defined through changes in serum creatinine
and urine output, it must also be remembered that
postoperative oliguria may be a normal physiological
response and may be due to salt and water retention
reflecting a degree of hypovolaemia. However, similar
neuroendocrine responses following pain, trauma and
surgery may result in oliguria in the absence of
haemodynamic
compromise.
Under
such
circum-
stances,

harmful [14].
Future considerations
Identification of the peri-operative patient at risk of
AKI is relatively straightforward, given the established
risk factors that have been identified. However, defin-
ing AKI can be difficult if a premorbid serum crea-
tinine is unavailable, as may be the case in emergency
situations, and may be recognised late after the peri-
operative insult. Both serum creatinine concentration
and urine output are functional markers of renal sta-
tus, not direct markers of kidney injury. Indeed, serum
creatinine is a delayed and insensitive biomarker of
changes in kidney function and is affected by many
factors [53]. Patients with reduced muscle mass, for
example, may not have a robust rise in serum crea-
tinine, despite substantial kidney injury, and in indi-
viduals with normal premorbid renal function, the
serum creatinine may never rise to levels considered
pathological. This ‘subclinical AKI’ also carries signifi-
cant short- and long-term risks. However, over the last
few years, much effort has been directed at discovering
candidate molecules which can improve the early
detection of AKI, as well as potentially assist in differ-
ential diagnosis and enhanced patient management
[54]. These new biomarkers of AKI have the ability to
identify injury to the tubular system, and as a conse-
quence identify patients who are going to develop AKI
[55]. A number of novel potential biomarkers that are
measurable in the urine or plasma of patients with
AKI
have
been
identified,
including
neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule
1 (KIM-1), interleukin 18, liver-type fatty acid-binding
protein (L-FABP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
2 (TlMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding pro-
tein
7
[56].
Although
clinical
adoption
of
such
biomarkers of AKI is somewhat slow, one may envis-
age a scenario where biomarker risk stratification
becomes an integral part of postoperative care in
patients at risk of AKI. This does not help in the oper-
ative period, where diagnostic technologies for assess-
ing renal function are limited. However, there are
recent
advances
in
the
development
of
real-time
glomerular filtration rate monitoring using fluorescent
tracers that may provide minute-to-minute assessment
of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and as such pro-
vide new insights into the effects of anaesthesia on
renal function [57].
Conclusions
Peri-operative AKI is an important complication with
high associated morbidity and mortality. Given that
AKI definitions are now standardised, this allows for
consistency in both diagnosis and reporting of AKI
rates. There are many risk factors for postoperative
AKI, some of which are fixed, including the nature
and urgency of surgery, age and patient comorbidities.
A personalised and multidisciplinary approach to the
care of each patient in the peri-operative setting may
help to minimise the risk of developing renal compli-
cations related to anaesthesia. This may include modi-
fying
peri-operative
management
such
as
the
avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs and hypotension, use
of a guided fluid management plan, use of vasopres-
sors or inotropes where required, avoiding high tidal
volume ventilation, and avoiding hyperglycaemia or
high variability in plasma blood glucose.
