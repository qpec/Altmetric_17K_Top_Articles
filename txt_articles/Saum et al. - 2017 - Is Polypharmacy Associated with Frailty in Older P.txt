OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between
polypharmacy and frailty.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational cohort study.
SETTING: Saarland, Germany.
PARTICIPANTS: 3,058 community-dwelling adults aged
between 57 and 84 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was assessed according to the
frailty phenotype, described by Fried et al. Polypharmacy
and hyperpolypharmacy were defined as the concomitant
use of five or more and 10 or more drugs, respectively. We
assessed associations between polypharmacy and prevalent
and incident frailty within 3 years of follow-up by logistic
regression models controlled for multiple potential con-
founders including comorbidity. Additionally, cubic splines
were used to assess dose–response associations.
RESULTS: Polypharmacy
was
reported
in
39.1%
(n = 1,194), and hyperpolypharmacy in 8.9% (n = 273) of
participants. Prevalent frailty was present in 271 (8.9%)
participants; 186 (9.3%) of 1,998 non-frail participants
with follow-up data became frail within 3 years. After
adjustment, polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy were
associated with prevalent frailty with adjusted odds ratios
(95% confidence interval) of 2.30 (1.60–3.31) and 4.97
(2.97–8.32), respectively. Polypharmacy (odds ratio (OR)
1.51
(1.05–2.16))
and
hyperpolypharmacy
(OR
1.90
(1.10–3.28)) were also independent predictors of incident
frailty. Furthermore, there was a moderate exposure–re-
sponse relationship between the number of medicines and
prevalent as well as incident frailty.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that polypharmacy is
associated with frailty. Further research should address the
potential benefit of reducing of inappropriate polyphar-
macy and better pharmacotherapeutic management for
preventing medication-associated frailty. J Am Geriatr Soc

W
ith increasing age, people more often develop multi-
ple chronic diseases. Management guidelines for
these conditions result in an increase in the number of
medicines prescribed.1 Polypharmacy, defined as taking at
least five drugs,2 may increase the risk for inappropriate
drug use and adverse drug reactions (ADRs)3,4 if pharma-
cotherapy is not adjusted to individual and age-dependent
characteristics. Age-related changes in drug pharmacoki-
netics and pharmacodynamics and the presence of multiple
comorbidities make prescribing a difficult task, especially
in frail elderly.5
Frailty can be characterized by diminished strength,
endurance, and reduced physiologic function and reserve,
with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including falls,
disability, and death.6,7 Higher risks for ADRs in frail
elderly have been reported.8 Additionally, polypharmacy
may be associated with frailty through plausible medica-
tion-related
mechanisms
influencing
functional
impair-
ment.9,10
Cross-sectional
associations
of
increased
medication use and frailty were previously reported from
studies in disabled older women, cancer patients, and gen-
eral population samples.11–15 Furthermore, a higher risk
for incident frailty was reported for community-dwelling
and hospitalized men exposed to polypharmacy.16–18
Because
recent
studies
were
mostly
restricted
to
specific groups of people and not representative for a
general older population, the aim of this study was to
further investigate the relationship between polypharmacy
and prevalent as well as incident frailty in a representa-
tive
sample
of
community-dwelling
older
men
and
women.

 METHODS
Study Design
This analysis was performed on data of the 8-year and 11-
year follow-up from the ESTHER cohort study conducted
in Saarland, Germany. Detailed information on the study
design and the study population has been reported else-
where.19 Briefly, initial assessment was conducted between
July 2000 and December 2002 and included 9,949 partici-
pants recruited by their general practitioners. Inclusion cri-
teria were age between 50 and 75 years, as well as good
knowledge of the German language. During the 8-year and
11-year follow-up, conducted between July 2008 and
December 2010 and between July 2011 and December
2013, respectively, the participants were offered to partici-
pate in a geriatric assessment by trained study physicians
in
the
participants’
homes
or
in
a
study
center
in
Saarbr€
ucken, Germany.
The study was approved by the responsible Ethics
Committees of the Medical Faculty of the University of
Heidelberg and of the Medical Association of the federal
state of Saarland. The study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from each participant.
Study Sample
In the cross-sectional analysis 3,058 participants of the 8-
year follow-up were included. For measurement of frailty
incidence, data from the 8-year and 11-year follow-up
were used. The longitudinal analyses included 1,998 par-
ticipants. A detailed flow chart on the selection of the
study population is shown in Figure S1.
Variables and Their Measurement
Operationalization of Frailty
Questionnaires and physical performance measures needed
for frailty operationalization were obtained during the
geriatric assessments of the 8-year and 11-year follow-up.
Frailty criteria were assessed according to the frailty phe-
notype, which was first described by Fried et al.6, includ-
ing
weight
loss,
exhaustion,
low
physical
activity,
slowness, and weakness. For operationalization of the
frailty criteria, we used a modified version of the Fried
frailty phenotype with population-independent cut-points
for the physical performance measures (gait speed ≤0.8;
grip strength for men ≤30 kg and women ≤20 kg, respec-
tively; physical activity ≤9.4 total score).20 Frailty was
defined
by
the
number
of
positive
frailty
criteria:
≥3 = frail, 1–2 = pre-frail, and 0 = non-frail.
Operationalization of Polypharmacy
During the geriatric assessment of the 8-year follow-up,
the participants’ drugs (including prescription and over-
the-counter
medicines)
were
comprehensively
assessed
using the “brown bag” review method.21 These data were
used to assess the total number of concomitantly taken
drugs. We categorized these drugs into three categories:
non-polypharmacy (0–4 drugs), polypharmacy (5–9 drugs),
and hyperpolypharmacy (10 or more drugs).2
The definition of polypharmacy and hyperpolyphar-
macy was modified by excluding drugs without relevant
propensity of causing ADRs or drug-drug interactions,
which were therefore considered irrelevant for adverse
health outcomes. According to this rationale, we excluded
food
supplements,
homeopathic
or
anthroposophical
drugs, and non-systemically acting drugs if they have no
known ADRs other than local reactions or if they are for
short-term use only (up to 2 weeks). Two pharmacists
individually evaluated the anatomical therapeutical class
(ATC) codes of all drugs taken in ESTHER according to
these exclusion criteria. Divergent opinions were resolved
in consensus and the final ATC exclusion list is shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Besides that, we counted combi-
nation drugs with the number of active substances (see
Table S2).
Covariates
Age, sex, and education originate from the participant’s
questionnaire of the ESTHER recruitment. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated by objectively measured height
and weight during the geriatric assessment. Current smok-
ing status and current medical conditions were obtained
from the participant questionnaire at the 8-year follow-up.
Additionally, medical conditions were validated by infor-
mation derived from the GP questionnaire. However, we
included the Total Morbidity Index (TMI) of the Cumula-
tive Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics22 (CIRS-G) as an
integrative measure of comorbidity as covariate in all
regression analyses.
Statistical Analysis
In order not to exclude participants with missing values of
covariates, we employed a multiple imputation procedure.
Five data sets were created with SAS procedure PROC MI.
The maximum number of iterations for imputed values
was set to 200. Age, sex, education, BMI, smoking status,
frailty status at the 8-year follow-up (baseline for this
analysis), number of drugs, and the scores for the 14 organ
systems of the CIRS-G were included in the imputation
procedure. All further analyses were performed in the five
imputed data sets and results of the individual data sets
were combined by SAS procedure PROC MIANALYZE.23
Standard descriptive methods were used to describe
characteristics of the study sample at baseline, stratified by
polypharmacy
status.
Differences
were
assessed
using
ANOVA or chi2-test.
We calculated (un)adjusted odds ratios (OR) with
95%-confidence intervals (CI) to quantify associations
between polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy and preva-
lent and incident frailty, respectively. Covariates used in
adjusted models were age, sex, BMI, education, smoking,
and TMI. We also assessed the influence of the number of
drugs as a continuous independent variable in dose–re-
sponse associations with prevalent and incident frailty,
respectively. Cubic spline functions were used as the fitting
procedure in corresponding relationships. Here, the expo-
sure–response curve represents the relationship between

 the number of drugs taken and the risk of being or becom-
ing frail, respectively.
An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statisti-
cal significance in 2-sided testing. Analyses were performed
using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The characteristics of the 3,058 participants at baseline are
shown in Table 1. The mean age was higher in partici-
pants
with
hyperpolypharmacy
(71.5 � 6.2 years)
and
polypharmacy (71.0 � 6.2) compared to participants with-
out polypharmacy (68.3 � 6.1). Sexes were equally dis-
tributed in each polypharmacy group. Frail participants
were more present in the hyperpolypharmacy (24.9%) and
polypharmacy group (12.1%) when compared to partici-
pants without polypharmacy (3.7%). TMI scores increased
with higher number of medicines from 5.2 (�4.2) points
in the non-polypharmacy group to 10.8 (�6.6) points in
the hyperpolypharmacy group. Individual comorbidities
were likewise more common in participants with polyphar-
macy and hyperpolypharmacy compared to participants
without polypharmacy.
Results of cross-sectional logistic regression models
are shown in Table 2. In unadjusted analysis, polyphar-
macy and hyperpolypharmacy were statistically signifi-
cantly
associated
with
pre-frailty
and
frailty.
After
comprehensive
adjustment,
these
associations
were
strongly attenuated but were still statistically significant.
Compared to participants taking ≤4 drugs, those with
polypharmacy were more likely to be pre-frail and frail
with ORs 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00–1.44) and 2.30 (95% CI:
1.60–3.31),
respectively.
Also
participants
with
hyperpolypharmacy were more likely to be pre-frail (OR:
1.48, 95% CI: 1.03–2.14) or frail (OR: 4.97, 95% CI:
2.97–8.32) compared to the reference group. Other vari-
ables statistically significantly associated with increased
odds for being pre-frail or frail were female sex, higher
age, higher BMI, current smoking, low education, and
higher TMI score.
Of the non-frail and pre-frail participants with frailty
follow-up, 186 (9.3%) developed frailty during follow-up
(see Table S3). Of participants using 0–4, 5–9, and 10+
drugs, 5.8%, 13.0% and 19.3% developed frailty during
follow-up, respectively. Frailty incidence was higher in
older age groups, ranging from 6.2% in participants aged
≤64 years to 18.7% in participants aged ≥75 years. Even
within age groups, incident frailty showed a clear upward
trend with increasing number of drugs. Frailty more often
occurred in participants with polypharmacy and hyper-
polypharmacy compared to participants without polyphar-
macy.
Table 3 shows results of longitudinal logistic regres-
sion models. Both polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy
were statistically significantly associated with higher odds
of becoming frail within 3 years. These effects were still
statistically
significant
after
comprehensive
adjustment.
Other variables statistically significantly associated with
higher odds for becoming frail were female sex, higher
age, higher BMI, current smoking, low education, higher
TMI score, and pre-frail baseline status.
The fully adjusted restricted cubic splines regressions
suggest
monotonic
exposure-response
associations
between the number of drugs taken per day and the odds
of
being
frail
and
becoming
frail,
respectively
(see
Figure S2).

 DISCUSSION
In this large cohort of 3,058 community-dwelling older
adults, we found that pre-frail and frail participants were
more likely to be exposed to polypharmacy or hyper-
polypharmacy than non-frail participants. Moreover, par-
ticipants with polypharmacy or hyperpolypharmacy were
at statistically significantly higher risk for incident frailty

 within three years. Our results of high daily medication
intake
associated
with
prevalent
and
incident
frailty
remained statistically significant even after comprehensive
adjustment including the comorbidity scale CIRS-G.
Polypharmacy might contribute to the development of
frailty independent of the number and severity of comor-
bidities through a negative influence on factors associated
with frailty or factors included in frailty definitions. It is
already known that there is a relationship between number
of drugs taken and markers of frailty or factors associated
with frailty criteria.9,10 ADRs could become more severe
and frequent in the elderly due to age-dependent pharma-
codynamic and pharmacokinetic changes promoting drug-
drug
or
drug-disease
interactions.
These
ADRs
could
directly (or indirectly) facilitate the development of frailty,
worsen the frailty state or have negative impact on frailty
criteria.5,24 This might lead into a vicious cycle if ADRs
are not identified as such and are being treated with fur-
ther added drugs (prescribing cascades).
A simple conclusion could be stopping or discontinu-
ing certain drugs (“deprescribing”).25 But it has to be kept
in mind, that due to a pragmatic polypharmacy definition
(taking ≥5 medicines) also participants who are necessarily
treated with ≥5 drugs because of their multiple comorbidi-
ties are (wrongly) included in this target group. Therefore,
it is necessary to evaluate the medication regimen for each
individual with polypharmacy carefully because the benefi-
cial effect of “deprescribing” has not been studied in RCTs
yet. This is a difficult task which could be facilitated if not
only the GP but also a pharmacist and a geriatrician will
contribute to tailor the best practicable medication regi-
men for the individual patient.26
In general, our results are in line with findings from
other studies. For prevalent frailty, studies in disabled
older women,11 hospitalized cancer patients and older
men12,16 as well as in community-dwelling older men and
women reported an association between increasing number
of drugs and frailty.13–15 Only two studies in community-
dwelling older men and hospitalized men reported an
increased
risk
of
becoming
frail
when
exposed
to
polypharmacy.16,17 We contribute to the current body of
knowledge about polypharmacy and frailty by (1) confirm-
ing the cross-sectional association between polypharmacy
and prevalent frailty, and (2) adding additional informa-
tion about the longitudinal association between polyphar-
macy and incident frailty from a general population
sample including men and women. Moreover, we included
the comprehensive multimorbidity score CIRS-G in our
final regression models to adjust for potential confounding
by number of comorbidities and also severity of illnesses.
Strengths of this study are the standardized, compre-
hensive assessment of all medications and of the Fried
frailty criteria, as well as the comprehensive assessment of
comorbidity and illness severity by the CIRS-G, which is
crucial to minimize overestimation of the association by
confounding. A further strength is the longitudinal design
with comprehensive standardized geriatric assessments.
Moreover, the study included a representative sample of
both men and women in a community-dwelling setting. A
limitation is the possible underestimation of frailty inci-
dence due to participation bias: those who participated in
both geriatric assessments had better general health and less
comorbidity at baseline than those who died or were unable
or not willing to participate in the follow-up, which may
reduce the generalizability of our results. Due to simple def-
inition of polypharmacy, we did not take typical pharmaco-
logical characteristics of the drugs (type of drug, dosage,
and cumulative exposure), as well as adherence of the par-
ticipants into account. Additionally, only the medication at
the
8-year
follow-up
was
considered
and
subsequent
changes in the number of drugs within the follow-up were
not included in this analysis. Moreover, adverse outcomes
as intercurrent events possibly leading to frailty during fol-
low-up were not considered. Also residual confounding due
to unmeasured or not included factors in our analysis as
well as confounding by indication cannot be excluded.
In conclusion, our study showed that polypharmacy is
associated with frailty. Participants exposed to polyphar-
macy and hyperpolypharmacy had a 1.5- and 2-fold higher
risk, respectively, for developing frailty within 3 years,
independently of the number of comorbidities and their
severity. Whether the reduction of avoidable polypharmacy
might be a promising approach to decrease the incidence
of frailty should now be addressed in well-controlled
prospective trials. Randomized controlled trials might be
warranted to assess potential positive effects of “depre-
scribing” in the elderly.
