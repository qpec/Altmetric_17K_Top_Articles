ABSTRACT Virulence is a microbial property that is realized only in susceptible
hosts. There is no absolute measurement for virulence, and consequently it is always
measured relative to a standard, usually another microbe or host. This article intro-
duces the concept of pathogenic potential, which provides a new approach to mea-
suring the capacity of microbes for virulence. The pathogenic potential is propor-
tional to the fraction of individuals who become symptomatic after infection with a
defined inoculum and can include such attributes as mortality, communicability, and
the time from infection to disease. The calculation of the pathogenic potential has
significant advantages over the use of the lethal dose that kills 50% of infected indi-
viduals (LD50) and allows direct comparisons between individual microbes. An analy-
sis of the pathogenic potential of several microbes for mice reveals a continuum,
which in turn supports the view that there is no dividing line between pathogenic
and nonpathogenic microbes.
KEYWORDS formula, pathogenesis, virulence
T
he germ theory of disease posited that certain microbes caused specific diseases
(e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis caused tuberculosis). Furthermore, it was rapidly
apparent that there were differences in virulence within a microbial species (1).
Virulence is the relative capacity of a microbe to cause damage, with the term “relative”
being a necessary component of the definition since there are no absolute measures of
virulence (2). Virulence is always measured relative to a standard, such as another
microbe or host. Today, most comparisons of virulence are done within a microbial
species, with investigators comparing the virulence of the wild type to that of an
experimentally modified strain, such as one with a gene deletion or mutation. Virulence
is expressed only in a susceptible host, and its measurement is critically dependent on
the host system used (3).
Historically, the measurement of virulence has relied on some quantifiable outcome
on the host, such as mortality. The most commonly used measurement of virulence is
the lethal dose required to kill 50% of infected hosts, referred to as the LD50. The LD50
measurement has the advantage that it allows comparisons across microbes, and the
use of host death provides a nonequivocal endpoint. However, the LD50 has the
considerable limitation that it is a coarse measure that is not applicable to those
host-microbe interactions where host death does not occur or is a very rare outcome.
Another limitation of the LD50 is that it is focused on mortality and thus misses other
outcomes of infection, such as chronicity and latency. However, perhaps the greatest
limitation of LD50 studies is lack of discriminatory power such that 10-fold differences
in the size of the inoculum can lead to the same LD50 value (for an example, see
reference 4).
Given the limitations of the LD50, some investigators have developed approaches for
measuring virulence that are not dependent on mortality. Beynen et al. developed a
symptomatic assessment scale that relied on measuring a variety of parameters in mice
with gallstones (5). Soothill et al. used hypothermia as a reliable early indicator of
mortality in mice and developed the HID50, or 50% hypothermia-inducing dose (6).

 These formulations, like the LD50, are useful for the specific situations for which they
were developed but lack global applicability for comparison across microbes and
potential hosts.
The pathogenic potential of a microbe. The goal of this effort was to find a
mathematical relationship that allows a quantitative measure of the capacity of a
certain microbe for pathogenicity. To accomplish this, I propose the concept of the
pathogenic potential (PP). In this phraseology, the word “pathogenic” retains the
meaning proposed earlier (2) as the capacity of a microbe to cause damage in a host
and the word “potential” acknowledges that no microbe can be pathogenic in the
absence of a host. In considering the factors that contributed to the pathogenic
potential, it was important to account for the fact that the damage incurred by a host
during a host-microbe interaction was variable. Clinical symptoms manifest themselves
only when the host-microbe interaction results in sufficient host damage to disrupt
homeostasis, and death ensues when the damage is so overwhelming that it precludes
repair and a return to homeostasis.
The pathogenic potential (PP) of a microbe is proposed to be proportional to the
ratio of the fraction symptomatic (Fs) and the infecting inoculum (I): PP � Fs/I.
Since symptomatology can range from a passing malaise to death, this formu-
lation does not capture the severe impact of host-microbe interactions associated
with host mortality. To include host-microbe interactions that result in death, the
ratio is modified by multiplying it by the 10th power of the mortality fraction: PP �
(Fs/I)(10M).
In this formulation, the Fs/I term includes the microbial pathogenicity and host
susceptibility factors essential for microbial pathogenesis, while the 10M factor is an
amplifier to account for host mortality, an extreme outcome of the host-microbe
interaction. The Fs/I term is identical to that used previously in developing a formula for
the weapon potential of a microbe (7). As will be illustrated below, when actual
calculations are done, the I parameter to be used should be the smallest that produces
symptoms/death, since progressively larger inocula associated with symptoms/death
for all animals will result in a smaller PP. For the mortality amplification, the 10th power
was used to allow for the possibility of host-microbe interactions with no mortality, in
which case M � 0.0, which reduces 10M to 1.0. For host-microbe interactions with 100%
mortality, M � 1.0, which contributes 10. For example, a microbe that caused symp-
toms in 100% (Fs � 1.0) of those infected with one microbe (I � 1.0) and killed every
infected host (M � 1.0) would have a PP of 10. On the other hand, for host-microbe
interactions where there are no symptoms (Fs � 0.0), which de facto implies M � 0.0,
the PP reduces to 0.0. For host-microbe interactions that produce no symptoms but
result in lesions to the host, such as granulomas, one can replace the Fs for the fraction
of individuals affected. The proposed PP essentially reduces to the inverse of the
infecting inoculum when comparing infections with microbes when all hosts become
symptomatic, consistent with the definition of virulence as the inverse of inoculum,
which was used in the early days of the germ theory (8).
Pathogenic potential and communicability (or transmissibility). The PP formu-
lation proposed above does not include the element of communicability. The reason
for this omission was to develop a formulation that could be used to compare the
pathogenic potentials of microbes independently of their communicability potential
and also allow for the comparison of the effects of microbes on individual hosts
independently of their effects on the entire population of susceptible hosts. The
relationship between communicability and virulence can very complex (9), and it is
relevant for some pathogenic microbes and not others. For M. tuberculosis, the capacity
for communicability is dependent on its ability to cause lung damage and consequent
dissemination through aerosolization of infective bacteria. However, the virulence of
Bacillus anthracis is not dependent on communicability, and anthrax is not a transmis-
sible disease. For other microbes, such as BK virus, communicability is common, but
disease is extremely rare, unless the host is immune suppressed. Hence, the relationship

 between pathogenic potential and communicability is microbe specific, with virulence
and communicability being dependent variables for some host-microbe relationships
and not others.
The element of communicability is also relevant to have an impact on the host
species, where it functions as an amplifier of threat. Given that communicability (C) is
an amplifier, it can be added to the pathogenic potential as a multiplier term. Hence,
a formulation for PP that includes the contribution of transmissibility (PPC) can be
PPC � (Fs/I)(10M)C.
Since there are no absolute values for C, it can be assigned a value ranging from 1
(not communicable) to 100 (every case leads to one or more new cases) based on
epidemiological data. Separating PP from C allows these properties to be considered
separately when comparing the outcome of host-microbe interactions in individuals
and populations.
The element of time. Neither PP nor PPC includes time to disease. The element of
time is often a central determinant of how the pathogenic potential of a microbial
species is perceived. When the words “fulminant” and “aggressive” are used in the
context of infectious diseases, they usually connote an element of rapidity or shortness
of time between infection and disease. Cryptococcosis, HIV infection, and disseminated
anthrax have in common close to 100% mortality in affected individuals if untreated,
but these diseases are often viewed differently with respect to their relative virulence
because the times to death differ greatly. Diseases that kill a host in a short time after
infection create a much greater impression than those where there is a long time
interval between infection and demise. For example, anyone who has witnessed a case
of meningococcal meningitis and/or sepsis cannot but be impressed with how fulmi-
nant that disease can be, which can progress from a mild condition to death in a matter
of hours. For those who want to consider the element of time, this can be easily
included in either the PP or PPC formulations by multiplying these calculated param-
eters by 1/T, where T is time. Consequently, infectious diseases where the times to
symptoms are shorter will yield a higher PP or PPC than those that take a long time from
infection to disease.
The exceptionality of certain toxin-mediated diseases. Toxin-mediated diseases
are different from other infectious diseases in that they can trigger symptoms irrespec-
tive of the immune system function (2), and for some diseases, the connection between
microbe and host can be both temporally and/or spatially separate. Furthermore, these
are a diverse set of diseases for which the PP is applicable to some but not others. For
example, the proposed PP formulation works for tetanus, where skin infection with
an inoculum of Clostridium tetani results in certain fraction of infected individuals
developing tetanus. In contrast, for botulism and staphylococcal food poisoning,
the disease results from the ingestion of a preformed toxin whose production is
temporally and spatially separate from introduction into the host, and the PP
formulation proposed above is not applicable, since there is no relevant inoculum.
However, the PP formulation can be modified to substitute the inoculum for the
toxin dose ingested to yield PPD. Hence, for toxin-mediated diseases where the
toxin in produced within the host as a consequence of infection, the PP applies,
while PPD can be used for microbial diseases resulting from the ingestion or
inoculation of preformed toxin. Like PP, the PPD can be modified to take into
account the element of time but when these diseases are not communicable and
C can be assigned the value of 1.0.
Calculations using the pathogenic potential formulation. Using the PP formu-
lation with experimental data demonstrates advantages as well as some caveats in its
application. The first example will use published data on the virulence of Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium strains differing in lipopolysaccharide side chains (4).
Table 1 lists the original data found in Table 2 of reference 4 and the calculated PP. One
immediate advantage is that the PP calculation remains useful for making comparisons
between strains when there is difference between the assumed inocula and the actual

 inocula as revealed by postinfection plating or plaque assays. Another advantage is that
the PP calculation discriminates between conditions where 10-fold differences in
inoculum yielded the same LD50. For example, for strain 2201, there is 50% mortality
with bacterial inocula of both 105 and 104 producing identical LD50 values, but the PP

aThe original data were published in Table 2 in reference 4. There was no specific reason for selecting this study apart from that it included sufficient data to make
the point that PP can discriminate in situations where the LD50 does not discriminate, as is evident for strain 2201, where 50% mortality was obtained with inocula
that differed by 10-fold.
bM stands for mortality, and the numbers given are the fractional mortality data for 10 mice. In calculating the PP, the Fs was assumed to be 1.0 under all conditions
where there was at least one death and 0.0 when no death was observed.

aThe PP calculation used literature information on the mortality of mice infected with these microbes. For the
calculation, Fs was assumed to 1.0 in all instances, which means that the PP reduces to the inverse of the
inoculum modified by the mortality parameter. In those studies where there were multiple microbial strains and
different mouse strains, the values used are those that had the largest effects. The PP calculations in this table
are for illustrative purposes only, and the reader is cautioned that the studies listed above used different mouse
strains and infection routes. Hence, comparisons among the listed microbes should be done cautiously, and the
major goal of this listing is to show that these lie on a continuum with regard to their pathogenicity for mice.
bMixing the inoculum with mucin reduces the dose needed to cause mortality as the mucin presumably
interferes with host defense mechanisms.

 shows a 10-fold difference between these conditions because it includes the inoculum
in the denominator. Furthermore, the calculation of PP allows much finer discrimination
for virulence differences than is apparent in simple inoculum versus mortality compar-
isons. In this regard, it is clear that when comparing strains, the PP can differ depending
on the inoculum. For example, strain 2201 appears to be most virulent at the lowest
inoculum that causes any mortality, but comparison of the calculated PP of this strain
and that of strain 2203 reveals the latter to have a greater PP with the larger inocula.
On the other hand, the inclusion of the Fs term in the PP formulation results in
major caveats that must be taken into account to avoid calculation foibles. In
calculating the PP for mice, the first issue encountered is that in a mortality study,
the Fs is not known, and even if the experimenters had set out to measure this
parameter, it is difficult to detect minor symptoms in mice. Hence, for inocula where
some mice died, in the sample calculations shown in Table 1 the Fs was set at 1.0
based on the assumption that if the experimental infection was sufficient to kill
some mice, then there was a high likelihood that some symptoms were experienced
by all survivors. However, setting Fs � 1 clearly does not work when the inoculum
is too low to result in any deaths since that would have the effect of producing a
very high PP even if all the mice were only transiently ill. Hence, when using the PP
formulation, one must be to be careful to consider the type of symptoms measured
and to use judgment on the input values.
Implications for microbial pathogenesis. The PPs of several microbes for mice
were calculated using information from the literature (Table 2). The listing of the PP for
these microbes reveals a continuum in the ability of microbes to disease in mice
(Table 2), and it can vary depending on mouse genetics (Table 3). This in turn argues
against a fundamental qualitative difference between so-called “pathogenic” and
“nonpathogenic” microbes, since one can always increase the inoculum to create

 conditions under which some fraction of infected hosts are symptomatic. Thus, sapro-
phytic microbes and those that exist in a commensal state in an immunocompetent
host can cause disease if the inoculum is high enough. This was demonstrated in a
famous self-experiment when an investigator ingested 1012 CFU of Candida albicans
and developed a transient illness with fever, shivering, and severe headache that was
accompanied by the presence of yeast in blood and urine, indicating rapid dissemina-
tion from the intestine (10). Consequently, classifications of microbes into pathogenic
and nonpathogenic sets can be futile exercises since such categorizations apply only for
defined inocula in certain hosts. On the other hand, microbes can be stratified accord-
ing to their pathogenic potential, provided that information is available on the Fs per
a given inoculum. Incidentally, the PP formulation is applicable in those situations
where the microbe in question changes its relationship with a host from commensal to
disease, as a result of a change in the host. Continuing with the example of C. albicans,
this microbe exists in a commensal state in most human hosts, but when these hosts
are given antimicrobial drugs that affect the indigenous microbiota, the fungal burden
can increase tremendously and can lead to disseminated candidiasis. The C. albicans
burden in the gut of individuals treated with antimicrobial drugs can reach 109/ml, a
number that approaches the ingestion dose of Krause when the entire gut volume is
taken into account (11).
In summary, the proposed formulation for the PP of a microbe takes into account
the contributions of both the host and the microbe to microbial pathogenesis. The
infective inoculum is a function of both the intrinsic virulence of a microbe and host
susceptibility. Microorganisms endowed with the capacity to disrupt host defenses
(virulence factors) tend to require smaller inocula to cause disease in nonimmune
hosts. PP provides a new means to rank microbes with regard to their relative
virulence. The continuity in PP implies the absence of a clear defining line between
so-called “pathogens” and “nonpathogens,” which highlights the futility of asking
questions, such as “What is a pathogen?” (12). In that light, the PP calculation
reinforces the suggestion to focus on the outcome of the host-microbe interaction
rather than the participants (12).
