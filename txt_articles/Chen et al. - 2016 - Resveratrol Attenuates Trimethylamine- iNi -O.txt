ABSTRACT
The gut microbiota is found to be strongly associated with atherosclerosis (AS). Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phy-
toalexin with anti-AS effects; however, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the
anti-AS effects of RSV were related to changes in the gut microbiota. We found that RSV attenuated trimethylamine-N-oxide
(TMAO)-induced AS in ApoE�/� mice. Meanwhile, RSV decreased TMAO levels by inhibiting commensal microbial trimethyl-
amine (TMA) production via gut microbiota remodeling in mice. Moreover, RSV increased levels of the genera Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium, which increased the bile salt hydrolase activity, thereby enhancing bile acid (BA) deconjugation and fecal excre-
tion in C57BL/6J and ApoE�/� mice. This was associated with a decrease in ileal BA content, repression of the enterohepatic
farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) axis, and increased cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) ex-
pression and hepatic BA neosynthesis. An FXR antagonist had the same effect on FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression as RSV, while
an FXR agonist abolished RSV-induced alterations in FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression. In mice treated with antibiotics, RSV nei-
ther decreased TMAO levels nor increased hepatic BA synthesis. Additionally, RSV-induced inhibition of TMAO-caused AS was
also markedly abolished by antibiotics. In conclusion, RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels and in-
creasing hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling, and the BA neosynthesis was partially mediated through the
enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis.
IMPORTANCE
Recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has been identified as a novel and independent risk factor for pro-
moting atherosclerosis (AS) partially through inhibiting hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis. The gut microbiota plays a key role in
the pathophysiology of TMAO-induced AS. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phytoalexin with prebiotic benefits. A growing body of
evidence supports the hypothesis that phenolic phytochemicals with poor bioavailability are possibly acting primarily through
remodeling of the gut microbiota. The current study showed that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels
and increasing hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling. And RSV-induced hepatic BA neosynthesis was partially
mediated through downregulating the enterohepatic farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 15 axis. These results offer
new insights into the mechanisms responsible for RSV’s anti-AS effects and indicate that the gut microbiota may become an in-
teresting target for pharmacological or dietary interventions to decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

T
he incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as ath-
erosclerosis (AS), is increasing globally and has become an
expensive public health issue (1). A recent metabolomics ap-
proach identified that plasma trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO),
a choline metabolite, is a novel and independent risk factor for
promoting AS (2, 3). TMAO generation is dependent on the gut
microbiota, which first metabolizes dietary choline to trimethyl-
amine (TMA). Thereafter, the TMA is metabolized to TMAO by
enzymes of the flavin monooxygenase (FMO) family in the liver
(4). Thus, the gut microbiota has been put forward as a key player
in the pathogenesis of TMAO-induced AS, which might be a new
potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of
CVD. It was found that antibiotics (Abs) could attenuate TMAO-
caused AS by reducing TMAO synthesis via blocking the pathway
of L-carnitine to TMA governed by the gut microbiota (4). How-
ever, the side effects and resistance potential of Abs limit their
utility. Therefore, the identification of natural products with ex-
cellent antimicrobial effects to inhibit gut microbial TMA produc-
tion might be useful for the prevention and treatment of TMAO-
induced AS.
TMAO has been shown to induce AS by affecting cholesterol
metabolism through inhibiting hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis
(2–4). Recently, the gut microbiota has been found to play an
important role in hepatic BA synthesis (5). Primary BAs are syn-
thesized from cholesterol in the liver and further metabolized by
the gut microbiota into secondary BAs via deconjugation, dehy-
drogenation, and dehydroxylation in the gut (6). This process is
controlled by a negative-feedback loop through the activation of

 the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the ileum and liver (7,
8). Furthermore, many studies have shown that the gut microbi-
ota regulates secondary BA metabolism and BA synthesis in the
liver by alleviating the enterohepatic FXR-fibroblast growth factor
15 (FGF15) axis (6, 9). VSL#3 probiotics can induce hepatic BA
neosynthesis via downregulation of the gut-liver FXR-FGF15 axis
(10). Sayin et al. found that the gut microbiota can reduce the
levels of tauro-beta-muricholic acid (T-�MCA), a naturally oc-
curring FXR antagonist. This subsequently inhibits cholesterol 7a-
hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in BA synthesis,
by activating FXR-FGF15 signaling and ultimately regulating BA
metabolism in the liver (5, 11). Additionally, tempol, an antioxi-
dant and protective agent against radiation, can alter the gut mi-
crobiome, leading to the accumulation of intestinal T-�MCA,
thereby inhibiting intestinal FXR signaling and decreasing obesity
(12). These results indicate that microbiota-targeted therapies
could be effective in preventing gut-related diseases, including AS,
by regulating BA metabolism via the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15
axis.
Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenol that mainly occurs
in grapes, berries, and other dietary constituents and is beneficial
for treatment of many metabolic diseases, including AS (13). Pre-
vious investigations have shown that the physiological effects of
dietary RSV are in striking contrast to its poor bioavailability,
which is a major concern for the development of this class of
compounds into therapeutic agents (14, 15). However, a growing
body of evidence supports the hypothesis that phenolic phyto-
chemicals with poor bioavailability are possibly acting primarily
through remodeling the gut microbiota. Researchers have con-
firmed that a polyphenol-rich cranberry extract and metformin
attenuate diet-induced metabolic syndrome in mice in a gut
microbiota-dependent manner (16, 17). Moreover, it has been
found that RSV consumption can significantly modulate the
growth of certain gut microbiota in vivo, including increasing the
Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratios, and the growth of Bacteroides,
Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium (18–22). These results sug-
gested that RSV could be a good candidate for prebiotics and
could be used to promote the growth of beneficial commensals
and thus to confer health benefits to the host.
Given the close association among TMAO levels, gut microbi-
ota, BA metabolism, and AS, we hypothesized that RSV could
attenuate TMAO-induced AS by regulating TMAO synthesis and
BA metabolism via the modulation of the gut microbiota. To ver-
ify this hypothesis, we examined the effects of RSV on TMAO-
induced AS, gut microbiota, TMAO synthesis, and BA metabo-
lism in C57BL/6J and ApoE�/� mice. Furthermore, the potential
involvement of the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis was also inves-
tigated. We showed, for the first time, that RSV attenuated
TMAO-induced AS by decreasing TMAO levels and increasing
hepatic BA neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodeling and that
RSV-induced BA neosynthesis was partially mediated through the
enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis.
RESULTS
RSV inhibited TMAO synthesis in C57BL/6J mice. In order to
investigate the effect of RSV on TMAO synthesis in C57BL/6J
mice, TMA and TMAO contents in serum were measured at 0, 1,
2, 4, 6 and 8 h after administration of a single dose of choline
(400 mg/kg of body weight) or TMA (40 mg/kg) in mice by intra-
gastric gavage. Via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC/MS), we found that peak concentrations of TMA
and TMAO occurred 4 h after choline administration and 1 h after
TMA administration (Fig. 1A and B). Thus, in subsequent exper-
iments we used serum samples taken at 4 h or 1 h after the admin-
istration of choline or TMA, respectively. Serum TMA and TMAO
levels were much lower in RSV-treated mice given a single dose of
choline than in those in the control group (Fig. 1C). For RSV-
treated mice given TMA, TMAO levels were higher and TMA
levels were lower than those in the control group (Fig. 1D), indi-
cating that RSV may induce the metabolism of TMA to TMAO in
the liver. Moreover, the addition of 1% choline over 30 days sig-
nificantly increased the levels of TMA and TMAO in mice; how-
ever, this was reversed by RSV administration (Fig. 1E). Addition-
ally, plasma RSV content was higher in mice fed RSV than in mice
fed a standard diet (Fig. 1F). Our results suggested that RSV re-
duced TMAO synthesis levels in C57BL/6J mice.
RSV inhibited TMAO synthesis by decreasing TMA genera-
tion via remodeling microbiota. TMAO generation is dependent
on the gut microbiota, which can metabolize dietary choline to
TMA. The TMA is then metabolized by enzymes of the FMO
family in the liver, among which flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)
is the most active (23). Thus, we first examined the effects of RSV
on FMO3 expression and activity in the liver. Treatment with RSV
resulted in a significant increase in protein and mRNA levels of
FMO3 (Fig. 2A and B). RSV also markedly increased FMO activity
in the liver (Fig. 2C). These findings corresponded with our earlier
results showing that RSV could increase TMAO levels in mice
treated with a single dose of TMA (Fig. 1D). These results indi-
cated that the RSV-induced decrease in TMAO levels was not due
to its regulation of FMO3 in the liver.
To determine the role of the gut microbiota in the RSV-
induced decrease of TMAO levels, we explored bacterial popula-
tions in the gut at the phylum and genus levels. Analysis at the
phylum level revealed that the bacterial population of vehicle-
treated mice was dominated by Bacteroidetes (35.1%) and Firmi-
cutes (50.3%), with a low level of Proteobacteria (11.2%) (Fig. 2D).
The proportion of sequences assigned to Bacteroidetes was signif-
icantly increased in metagenomes of RSV-fed animals at the ex-
pense of Firmicutes (Fig. 2D). Genus-level analysis showed that
RSV induced an increase in the relative abundances of Bacteroides,
Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia in mice (Fig. 2E
and F). RSV administration resulted in a decrease in the relative
abundances of Prevotella, uncultured Ruminococcaceae (Rumino-
coccaceae_uncultured), Anaerotruncus, Alistipes, Helicobacter, and
uncultured Peptococcaceae (Peptococcaceae_uncultured) (Fig. 2E
and F). Using Pearson’s correlation tests, we found that, in gen-
eral, taxa that were present at a relatively high proportion coinci-
dent with high plasma TMA concentrations also tended to be
present at a relatively high proportion coincident with high
plasma TMAO concentrations. Species of several bacterial taxa
(Ruminococcaceae_uncultured, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Akkerman-
sia, and Lactobacillus) remained significantly associated with
plasma TMA and/or TMAO levels after false discovery rate (FDR)
adjustment for multiple comparisons (Fig. 2G). Via a direct ex
vivo assay, we found that the production of TMA from choline was
lower in cecal content from RSV-treated mice and that the con-
centration of RSV in the cecal content was much higher than that
in the plasma (Fig. 2H and I). Moreover, we found that the same
mice fed with RSV could show markedly decreased TMA and
TMAO levels after choline treatment; however, after washout with

 a chow diet for 1 month, they failed to reduce TMA and TMAO
contents after choline administration (Fig. 2J). Additionally, real-
time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of suspected cecal mi-
crobes from mice treated with RSV for 2 months revealed that
changes in the gut flora caused by RSV were similar to those ob-
served in mice fed with RSV for 1 month (see Fig. S2A and B in the
supplemental material). These results indicated that RSV remod-
eled the gut microbiome in mice, which might contribute to de-
creased gut microbial TMA production, thereby inhibiting
TMAO synthesis.
RSV enhanced BA deconjugation and fecal excretion
through microbiota modulation. The gut microbiota plays an
important role in BA metabolism, by mediating deconjugation
and 7-�-dehydroxylation of primary BAs (24). To assess the ex-
tent of BA biotransformation upon prebiotic colonization, we
measured the effects of RSV on fecal BA excretion and composi-
tion. RSV significantly enhanced fecal BA loss, which was inhib-
ited by Abs (Fig. 3A). It has been demonstrated that major second-
ary BAs are deoxycholic acid (DCA) and murideoxy cholic acid
(MDCA), which are the 7-�-dehydroxylation products of cholic
acid (CA) and beta-muricholic acid (�-MCA), respectively (25).
Here, we found that the fecal CA/DCA ratio was unchanged by
RSV administration, indicating that RSV had no effect on 7-�-
dehydroxylation activity in the gut (Fig. 3B; see also Table S4 in the
supplemental material). In contrast, there was a significant de-
crease in the fecal conjugated/unconjugated BA ratio, along with
an increase in bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzyme activity, in the
feces of RSV-treated mice (Fig. 3C and D; see also Table S4).
Moreover, we found that RSV treatment resulted in an increase in
the proportions of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that were

 present in the gut (Fig. 2E and F), likely contributing to its effects
on BSH activity. Of note, administration of RSV resulted in a
significant reduction in small-intestine (SI) BA content, including
taurocholic acid (TCA), T�MCA, CA, chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA), and DCA, in which the decrease in levels of TCA, CA,
CDCA, and DCA might explain nearly 90% of the lower SI BA
content (see Fig. S2C and Table S4). It has been demonstrated that
the apical sodium bile acid transporter (ASBT) is responsible for
ileal BA uptake, with a preference for conjugated over unconju-
gated BAs (26). We assessed mRNA and protein levels of ASBT

 and found that RSV had no significant influence on ASBT mRNA
or protein levels (see Fig. S2D and E), suggesting that the RSV-
mediated increase in fecal BA loss was independent of the presence
of ASBT. Finally, we observed a reduction in the mRNA levels of
the BA transporters organic solute transporter alpha (OST�) and
beta (OST�) in RSV-treated mice, which might contribute to the
RSV-induced decrease in ileal BA content (see Fig. S2F). These
results suggested that RSV-induced modulation of the gut micro-
biome contributed to increased BSH activity and subsequently
promoted the generation of unconjugated BAs from conjugated
BAs, thereby enhancing fecal BA loss.
RSV induced hepatic BA synthesis in C57BL/6J mice. It was
reported previously that enhanced fecal BA loss is accompanied by
enhanced hepatic BA neosynthesis (27, 28). We found that RSV
significantly decreased the liver cholesterol level and increased the
BA pool size and the gallbladder and SI luminal BA content; these
effects were reversed by treatment with Abs (Fig. 4A to D). No
differences were observed with respect to serum and hepatic BA
content (Fig. 4E and F). In addition, the expression of CYP7A1
mRNA and protein, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic
BA synthesis, was also investigated (29). As shown in Fig. 4G to I
and in Table S4 in the supplemental material, RSV increased the
bile TCA/T�MCA ratio and induced CYP7A1 mRNA and protein
expression and the effects were inhibited by Abs treatment. These
results suggested that RSV possibly increased hepatic BA synthesis
by inducing CYP7A1 expression in a gut microbiota-dependent
manner.
The enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis played a key role in RSV-
induced BA synthesis. The feedback suppression of CYP7A1 gene
transcription by FXR is one of the most important mechanisms in
the maintenance of BA homeostasis (30). Previous studies have
shown that FXR activation is a major mechanism in the suppres-
sion of BA synthesis and induces small heterodimer partner (SHP)
and FGF15, which work together to suppress CYP7A1 (31, 32).
Thus, we sought to determine the possible roles of the gut-liver
FXR signaling in RSV-induced BA synthesis. RSV treatment re-
sulted in a significant decrease in ileal FGF15 mRNA and protein
levels; however, ileal FXR mRNA and protein levels were un-
changed (Fig. 5A and B). These observations suggested that RSV
downregulated FXR transcriptional activity, as demonstrated by
the reduction in mRNA levels of its target genes. In the liver, RSV
treatment appeared to have no significant effect on the mRNA
level of the SHP gene and the mRNA and protein levels of FXR (see
Fig. S3A and B in the supplemental material). These findings high-
lighted that RSV downregulated the ileal FXR-FGF15 axis, which
might result from RSV-induced significant reduction in FXR ago-
nists (TCA, DCA, CA, and CDCA) in SI tissues (see Table S4).
Furthermore, we used Z-Guggulsterone (Z-Gug), a natural antag-
onist of FXR, to suppress FXR in mice as outlined previously (33).
Treatment with Z-Gug markedly inhibited the expression of
FGF15, thereby inducing CYP7A1 expression in mice (Fig. 5C and
D). Additionally, similar results were seen in mice cotreated with
RSV and Z-Gug (Fig. 5C and D). The presence of synthetic FXR
agonist GW4064 was able to reverse RSV-induced alterations in
the expression of FGF15 and CYP7A1 in mice (Fig. 5E and F).
Taken together, these observations indicated that the gut-liver
FXR-FGF15 axis played a key role in RSV-induced BA synthesis.
RSV protected ApoE�/� mice from TMAO-induced AS in a
gut microbiota-dependent manner. Plasma TMAO is strongly
associated with AS (2). Therefore, we investigated whether
changes in TMAO induced by RSV through microbiota remodel-
ing were associated with AS regression in ApoE�/� mice. The
atherosclerotic lesion area and the cholesterol content in the
whole aorta, as indexes of AS severity, were much higher in mice

 fed with choline than in chow-fed mice, and the effects were mark-
edly reversed by RSV or Abs administration (Fig. 6). Moreover,
when the gut microbiota was suppressed by Abs, RSV-induced
inhibition of TMAO-caused AS was significantly abolished
(Fig. 6). Additionally, RSV single treatment could also attenuate
the pathogenesis of AS in ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 6). These results
suggested that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS in a gut
microbiota-dependent manner.
RSV reduced TMAO levels by decreasing TMA generation

to D, RSV administration markedly decreased TMA and TMAO
contents and increased the expression levels of liver FMO3 and
FMO activity. These results were consistent with our findings in
C57BL/6J mice, suggesting the important role of the gut microbi-
ota in the RSV-induced decrease of TMAO levels.
The composition of the gut microbiota in cecal content was
then determined. Via qPCR and sequencing 16S rRNA assays, we
found that choline administration markedly increased the bacte-
rial concentrations of Bacteroidetes phyla and decreased the con-
centrations of Firmicutes phyla compared to the control group
(see Fig. S4A in the supplemental material). The Proteobacteria
and Actinobacteria phyla showed no significant changes after cho-
line treatment in ApoE�/� mice (see Fig. S4A). Moreover, com-
pared to chow-fed ApoE�/� mice, choline significantly increased
the number of Prevotella and decreased the concentrations of Bac-
teroides, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium (see Fig. S4B). These
results indicated that chronic choline supplementation might al-
ter cecal microbial composition, thereby enhancing the synthesis
of TMA and TMAO and ultimately increasing AS. As expected,
treatment with RSV resulted in an increase in Bacteroidetes abun-
dance (from 20.6 to 34.0%) at the expense of Firmicutes (from 60.1
to 50.1%) in choline-treated ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 7E). RSV also

 increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bi-
fidobacterium, and Akkermansia and decreased the relative abun-
dances of Prevotella, Ruminococcaceae_unclassified, and Biophila
in choline-fed ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 7F and G). After FDR adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons, the abundance of genera Pre-
votella and Bacteroides was still significantly associated with
TMAO and TMA levels in choline-treated ApoE�/� mice
(Fig. 7H). Additionally, via a direct ex vivo assay, we found that the
production of TMA from choline was higher in cecal content from
choline-treated mice and that the effect was reversed by RSV ad-
ministration (Fig. 7I). Combined with the results seen in
C57BL/6J mice, we postulated that RSV attenuated TMAO-
induced AS by reducing TMAO synthesis via inhibition of the gut
microbial TMA production.
RSV induced hepatic BA synthesis in choline-treated
ApoE�/� mice. TMAO appears to contribute to the development
of AS, in part by affecting cholesterol metabolism through the
regulation of the BA synthesis pathway (4). Therefore, the influ-
ence of RSV on BA synthesis was investigated in choline-treated
ApoE�/� mice. We found that the presence of choline signifi-
cantly increased serum total cholesterol (TC) and liver cholesterol
levels and decreased BA pool size and gallbladder and SI luminal
BA content in ApoE�/� mice; these effects were reversed by treat-
ment with RSV (Fig. 8A to E). And there were no significant dif-
ferences in liver BA content among the groups (Fig. 8F). Mean-
while, RSV also increased the bile TCA/T�MCA ratio (see Fig. S5A
and Table S4 in the supplemental material) and reversed the
choline-induced decrease of CYP7A1 mRNA and protein expres-
sion in ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 8G and H). However, when the gut
microbiota was suppressed by Abs, RSV-induced hepatic BA syn-
thesis was significantly inhibited in choline-fed ApoE�/� mice
(Fig. 8). Additionally, RSV single treatment could also induce he-
patic BA synthesis in ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 8). These results sug-
gested that RSV induced hepatic BA synthesis in a gut microbiota-
dependent manner in choline-treated ApoE�/� mice.
RSV downregulated the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis in
choline-treated ApoE�/� mice. Finally, the effects of RSV on gut-
liver FXR signaling were determined in choline-treated ApoE�/�
mice. The mRNA level of the SHP gene and the mRNA and pro-
tein levels of FXR in the liver were unchanged by RSV (Fig. 9A and
B). The ileal FGF15 mRNA and protein levels were markedly re-
duced by RSV; however, ileal FXR mRNA and protein levels were
unchanged in choline-fed ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 9C and D). In ad-
dition, RSV had no effect on ASBT expression but still decreased
the SI BA content, including TCA, CDCA, and T�MCA, in
choline-fed ApoE�/� mice (Fig. 9D and E; see also Table S4 in the
supplemental material). RSV also increased fecal BA loss and fecal
conjugated/unconjugated BA levels and increased BSH activity,
with fecal CA/DCA ratios unchanged in choline-fed ApoE�/�
mice (Fig. 9F; see also Fig. S5B to D and Table S4). These results
were similar to those found in C57BL/6J mice. Overall, we came to
the conclusion that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS, partially
by regulating BA synthesis through the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15
axis in a gut microbiota-dependent manner.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, the role of the gut microbiota in the protec-
tive effects of RSV against AS was determined in mice. We found

 that RSV reduced TMAO levels by inhibiting gut microbial TMA
formation via remodeling gut microbiota, thereby attenuating
TMAO-induced AS. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to demonstrate the role of the gut microbiota in RSV-induced
protection against AS. Dietary choline is metabolized by the intes-
tinal microbiota to TMA, which is further metabolized by FMO
enzymes, in particular, FMO3, to produce TMAO in the liver (23).
Recently, plasma TMAO was identified as a metabolite strongly
associated with AS (2–4). Researchers confirmed that feeding AS-
prone mice diets enriched in either choline or TMAO enhanced
the development of AS. Enhanced AS, as observed by dietary cho-
line supplementation, is entirely dependent on the gut microbi-
ota. Treatment with Abs, or germ-free conditions, abolished di-
etary choline-driven TMAO generation and the development of
AS (2, 4). We observed that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS
and reduced TMA and TMAO levels in mice. Moreover, RSV in-
creased the expression and activity of FMO3 in the liver, corre-
sponding with previously published results (34). It has been dem-
onstrated that the gene encoding FMO3 is a direct FXR target
gene, and FXR has been found to be a target of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in
metabolic regulation (23, 34, 35). Moreover, RSV is a well-known
activator of SIRT1 and our previous study also found that RSV
improved hepatic steatosis partially by inducing autophagy via the
SIRT1 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo (36–38). Therefore,
RSV might increase liver FMO3 expression and activity via regu-
lation of the SIRT1-FXR signaling pathway. However, the exact
underlying mechanisms need to be further elucidated. Our find-
ings suggested that RSV-induced TMAO reduction was not due to
its regulation of FMO3 in the liver.
Previous results suggested possible prebiotic benefits associ-

 file of gut bacteria but acted at the intestinal level, altering the
mRNA expression of tight-junction proteins and inflammation-
associated genes in high-fat sucrose diet-fed rats. Here, we found
that RSV inhibited TMAO synthesis by decreasing gut microbial
TMA production through gut microbiota modulation, which
subsequently attenuated TMAO-induced AS. Meanwhile, a recent
report showed that 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol can reduce TMAO
levels by inhibiting the formation of TMA from microbes in mice,
thereby attenuating choline diet-enhanced AS (39). These results
indicated that targeting gut microbial production of TMA specif-
ically and of nonlethal microbial inhibitors in general may serve as
a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of CVD. In
addition, the physiological effects of dietary RSV appeared to be in
striking contrast to its poor bioavailability, which has been a major
concern in the development of this class of compounds into ther-
apeutic agents (14, 15). Our findings suggested that RSV likely
exerted its primary effects by remodeling gut microbiota. This
might explain the paradox that RSV has low bioavailability in
humans while exerting noticeable bioactivities. These findings
provide a new insight into the potential mechanisms responsible
for the cardiovascular protective effects of RSV and indicate that
the gut microbiota may play an important role.
Furthermore, it has been found that Abs could attenuate
TMAO-caused AS by reducing TMAO synthesis via blocking the
pathway of choline to TMA governed by the gut microbiota (4).
Our results indicated that Abs treatment could markedly inhibit
the RSV-induced decrease of AS in choline-fed ApoE�/� mice,
which suggests that RSV’s protective effects on the proatherogenic
phenotype might depend on other factors of the microbiota beside
reducing gut microbial TMA production. Current evidence sug-
gests that TMAO appears to contribute to the development of AS,
in part by regulating cholesterol elimination and BA synthesis (2,
4). BAs are synthesized from cholesterol by CYP7A1 in the liver
and play a central role in cholesterol homoeostasis (8). The gut

 microbiota is important for BA metabolism, as it mediates pri-
mary BA deconjugation and subsequent conversion to secondary
BAs, which are responsible for BA synthesis in the liver (5). The
gut microbiome produces potent ligands corresponding to BA
receptors; probiotics or prebiotics could act as therapeutics of BA
dysmetabolism, indicating that microbiota-targeted therapies
could be effective in preventing and/or treating gut-related dis-
eases, including AS (40). We observed that RSV significantly in-
creased the expression of CYP7A1, subsequently inducing BA syn-
thesis in the liver. RSV also increased the proportions of
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which are considered BSH-
active bacteria (41). Bacterial BSH activity affects systemic meta-
bolic processes and adiposity in the host. It also represents a key
mechanistic target for the control of obesity and hypercholester-
olemia, acting by deconjugating BAs to generate unconjugated
BAs (42). For the first time, we found that RSV induced hepatic
BA synthesis by remodeling the gut microbiome. Dietary RSV has
been shown to increase the expression of hepatic CYP7A1 and to
ameliorate hypercholesterolemia in high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice
(43). Our findings were the first to indicate the crucial role of the
gut microbiota in RSV-induced cholesterol metabolism in the
liver, indicating that RSV could attenuate TMAO-caused AS, par-
tially by inducing BA synthesis in a gut microbiota-dependent
manner. These findings offer new insights into the protective ef-
fects of RSV against AS.
We also investigated the potential involvement of ASBT and
the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis in RSV-mediated BA synthe-
sis. Recently, it was found that ASBT plays a key role in the entero-
hepatic recycling of BAs and indirectly contributes to cholesterol
homoeostasis (26). RSV promotes the degradation of ASBT in
vitro, which might have some clinical relevance with regard to the
observed cholesterol-lowering effects of RSV (44). We found that
RSV reduced ileal BA levels, with no effect on ASBT expression.
Our results contradict those previously published, possibly be-
cause we were experimenting in vivo, which is a more complex
environment than that in vitro. Moreover, we observed a reduc-
tion in the mRNA levels of the BA transporters encoded by the
OST� and OST� genes in RSV-treated mice; that reduction might
contribute to the RSV-induced decrease in ileal BA content.
Meanwhile, we found that RSV increased BSH activity, thereby
enhancing BA deconjugation. This might also result in the de-
crease in ileal BA content, because the ileal BA transporters prefer
conjugated BAs to unconjugated BAs (26). Interestingly, the SI
lumenal BA content was higher upon RSV treatment, which was
presumably a result of increased biliary output. However, the ex-
act underlying mechanisms need to be further clarified. It has been
reported that enhanced fecal BA loss, either driven by ASBT ge-
netic deletion or induced by BA sequestrant administration, is
accompanied by enhanced hepatic BA neosynthesis (27, 28). We
showed that RSV induced BA synthesis in the liver, contributing
to its protective effect on AS caused by TMAO. These findings
provide new insights into the cardiovascular benefits of RSV.
FXR is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, where it
functions as an intracellular sensor of BAs. FXR is required for the
negative-feedback regulation of BA biosynthesis and the entero-
hepatic cycle (30). Previous studies have shown that FXR activa-
tion induces SHP and FGF15, thereby suppressing CYP7A1 ex-
pression and ultimately inhibiting BA synthesis (31, 32). BA

 synthesis and modulation of the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis
are seen in germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated animals
(5). Results from a recent study demonstrate that probiotic VSL#3
affects hepatic BA synthesis by downregulating the gut-liver FXR-
FGF15 axis. This suggests that microbiota-targeted therapies af-
fect cholesterol metabolism by inducing hepatic BA synthesis via
the regulation of the gut-liver FXR-FGF15 axis (10). We also
found that RSV decreased the activity of ileal FXR and the expres-
sion of FGF15 by decreasing the levels of FXR agonists (TCA and
CDCA) in SI tissues (45, 46). When Z-Gug, a natural antagonist of
FXR, was administered, RSV failed to reduce FGF15 expression
and to induce the expression of CYP7A1 in mice. Additionally, the
presence of GW4064, a synthetic FXR agonist, reversed RSV-
induced alterations in FGF15 and CYP7A1 expression. These ob-
servations indicated that the gut-liver FXR-FGF15 axis was re-
quired for RSV to induce hepatic BA synthesis.
Finally, it is not known whether TMAO interacts directly with
a specific receptor or whether it acts to alter signaling pathways
indirectly by altering the protein conformation (that is, via allo-
steric effects), whereas TMA has been reported to influence signal
transduction by direct interaction with a family of G protein-
coupled receptors (47). TMAO, a small quaternary amine with an
aliphatic character, is reportedly capable of directly inducing con-
formational changes in proteins and of stabilizing protein folding
and acting as a small-molecule protein chaperone (48, 49). It is
thus conceivable that TMAO may alter many signaling pathways
without directly acting at a “TMAO receptor.” However, the exact
mechanisms by which circulating TMAO promotes AS and
whether RSV could also reverse TMAO-caused changes in other
signaling pathways are still largely unknown and need to be fur-
ther elucidated.
To the best of our knowledge, we have demonstrated for the
first time that RSV attenuated TMAO-induced AS by regulating
the synthesis of TMAO and BAs via remodeling of the gut micro-
biota and that RSV-mediated hepatic BA neosynthesis was par-
tially modulated by downregulation of the gut-liver FXR-FGF15
axis (Fig. 10). Hence, these results open a new avenue of research
regarding the potential cardiovascular protective effects of RSV
and indicate that the gut microbiota may become an interesting
target for pharmacological or dietary interventions to decrease the
risk of developing CVD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and treatments. Female C57BL/6J mice and ApoE�/� mice with
a C57BL/6 genetic background were purchased from Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals were maintained at a controlled tem-
perature (22 � 2°C), with a 12-h light/dark period. For all the experi-
ments, mice were housed individually in cages and had ad libitum access
to water. Mice of the control group were fed a standard chow diet (NIH31
modified mouse/rat diet; Harlan Teklad). Animal experiments were car-
ried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Insti-
tutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee of the Third Military Medical University (Chongqing, China; Ap-
proval SYXC-2014-00112). Pentobarbital sodium anesthesia (50 mg/kg of
body weight) was administered prior to surgical procedures, with maxi-
mal effort exerted to minimize suffering. At the end of the experiments,
mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation.
Statistical analyses. Quantitative data are presented as means � stan-
dard deviations (SD) of results from three independent experiments. Sta-
tistical analysis was conducted with either Student’s t test or one-way
analysis of variance using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A P value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and the Tukey-Kramer
post hoc test was applied if the P value was less than 0.05. Correlations
between host parameters and bacterial populations were assessed by Pear-
son’s correlation tests using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). FDR in the multiple comparisons were estimated
for each taxon based on the P values that resulted from correlation esti-
mates in R statistical software.

FIG 10 A model depicting use of RSV to attenuate AS by targeting gut microbiota. Dietary RSV can alter the composition of gut flora. On the one hand, this
can result in reduced levels of gut microbial TMA production, subsequently leading to decreased TMAO synthesis in the liver and, ultimately, to inhibition of AS.
On the other hand, RSV increases BSH activity by gut microbiota remodeling, which promotes the generation of unconjugated BAs from conjugated BAs and
enhances fecal BA loss. RSV-induced fecal BA loss leads to a decrease in ileal BA content, thereby inhibiting the ileal FXR-FGF15 axis, and then increases the
expression levels of CYP7A1 in the liver, subsequently inducing hepatic BA neosynthesis which contributes to cholesterol homeostasis, finally attenuating AS. Red
