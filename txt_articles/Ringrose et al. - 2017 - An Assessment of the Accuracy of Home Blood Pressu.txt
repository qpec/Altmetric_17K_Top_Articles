Accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential 
to the optimal diagnosis and management of hypertensive 
individuals.1 Home BP monitoring is widely used to diag-
nose and monitor patients with or at risk for hypertension.2 
Advantages of home BP monitoring over conventional office 
BP measurements include patient convenience, detection of 
white coat and masked phenomena, superior risk prediction, 
and enhancement of patient self-management and thera-
peutic adherence through self-monitoring.3,4 Consequently, 
hypertension guidelines strongly endorse use of home BP 
monitoring in hypertensive patients.5,6
Home BP monitors measure BP primarily using the 
oscillometric technique, in which BP is estimated using an 
algorithm applied to the envelope of oscillometric wave-
forms generated during cuff inflation and/or deflation.7 
Many home BP devices are sold without formal validation 
of accuracy.8 Even when BP monitors are determined to be 
valid according to contemporary standards, it is difficult 
to predict if the study results are generalizable to an indi-
vidual patient. Patients purchasing and using these devices 
are likely to be older and to have cardiovascular comorbidi-
ties. These are predisposing factors for arterial stiffness and 
widened pulse pressure, which are thought to detrimentally 
affect the accuracy of oscillometry.9 Despite these potential 
limitations, the accuracy of a given home BP device to meas-
ure BP in the patient who uses that device is almost never 
verified and this has been identified as a key limitation of 
current validation standards.10,11
The objective of this study was to compare measurements 
taken using an individual patient’s home BP monitor to a 
simultaneous, 2-observer, auscultatory mercury sphyg-
momanometer reference standard. The primary intent was

OBJECTIVE
To examine the accuracy of home blood pressure (BP) devices, 
on their owners, compared to auscultatory reference standard BP 
measurements.
METHODS
Eighty-five consecutive consenting subjects ≥18 years of age, who 
owned an oscillometric home BP device (wrist or upper-arm device), 
with BP levels between 80–220/50–120 mm Hg, and with arm circum-
ferences between 25–43 cm were studied. Pregnancy and atrial fibrilla-
tion were exclusion criteria. Device measurements from each subject’s 
home BP device were compared to simultaneous 2-observer auscul-
tation using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Between-group mean 
comparisons were conducted using paired t-tests. The proportion of 
patients with device-to-auscultatory differences of ≥5, 10, and 15 mm 
Hg were tabulated and predictors of systolic and diastolic BP differ-
ences were identified using linear regression.
RESULTS
Mean age was 66.4 ± 11.0 years, mean arm circumference was 
32.7 ± 3.7 cm, 54% were female and 78% had hypertension. Mean 
BPs were 125.7 ± 14.0/73.9 ± 10.4 mm Hg for home BP devices vs. 
129.0 ± 14.7/72.9 ± 9.3 for auscultation (difference of −3.3 ± 7.3/0.9 ± 6.1; 
P values <0.0001 for systolic and 0.17 for diastolic). The proportion of 
devices with systolic or diastolic BP differences from auscultation of ≥5, 
10, and 15 mm Hg was 69%, 29%, and 7%, respectively. Increasing arm 
circumference was a statistically significant predictor of higher systolic 
(parameter estimate 0.61 per cm increase; P value 0.004) and diastolic 
(0.38; 0.03) BP.
CONCLUSIONS
Although mean differences from 2-observer auscultation were accept-
able, when tested on their owners, most home BP devices were not 
accurate to within 5 mm Hg. Ensuring acceptable accuracy of the 
device-owner pairing should be prioritized.

to identify the mean difference in systolic and diastolic BP 
between these 2 techniques, the variability, the proportion 
of patients in whom accuracy was suboptimal (defined as 
a device-to-reference standard difference of ≥5, 10, and 
15 mm Hg), and identify predictors of inaccuracy.
METHODS
Study Population
The University of Alberta Research Ethics Board approved 
the protocol and informed consent was obtained from all 
participants. A convenience sample of 85 consecutive, con-
senting adults aged ≥18 years that owned and used an oscil-
lometric home BP monitor (wrist or upper-arm device) were 
enrolled. Subjects were recruited using posters, newspaper 
advertisements, and in person at local farmer’s markets and 
seniors’ fairs. The study poster stated, “We plan to study how 
the accuracy of your home blood pressure monitor compares 
to standard blood pressure measurements.” Subjects were 
required to have baseline BP levels between 80–220/50–
120 mm Hg and upper-arm circumferences 25–43 cm. 
Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and atrial fibrillation.
Baseline Data Collection
Baseline data collection included age, sex, race, height, 
weight, and self-reported history of hypertension, coronary 
artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascu-
lar disease, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and dyslipi-
demia. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height 
was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm. Body mass index was 
calculated by dividing weight by the square of height. Arm 
circumference was measured by first marking the midpoint 
(to the nearest 0.1 cm) between the acromion and olecranon 
processes while standing with the arm bent at 90 degrees. 
The arm was then straightened at the subject’s side and the 
circumference measured at the marked midpoint with the 
measuring tape parallel to the floor. Baseline office BP and 
heart rate were measured once in the seated position using 
the BpTru (Coquitlam, Canada) automated oscillometric 
device and the appropriate cuff size to ensure participants 
met the BP inclusion criteria. A rhythm strip was obtained to 
assess for atrial fibrillation (Schiller, Doral, FL, USA).
Home cuffs were classified by brand category (Omron vs. 
Miscellaneous), site (upper arm vs. wrist), validation sta-
tus (listed as valid according to the Canadian Hypertension 
Education Program [hypertension.ca], dabl Educational Trust 
[dableducational.org] or Medaval [medaval.ie], and by type of 
cuff design (soft material vs. hard shell)). All wrist cuffs were 
of rigid design and were included in the hard shell category. 
Subject-estimated device age in years was also recorded.
DATA COLLECTION
Prior to study initiation, all study personnel attended 
a workshop on BP measurement taught by an expert in 
hypertension and BP measurement. Study procedures were 
based primarily upon the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO 81060–2:2013) standards.12 However, 
recommended sex, BP variability, and BP distribution 
requirements were not observed as the study was not con-
ducted to validate a new device.
BP Measurements
Six trained study observers performed the auscultatory 
measurements, with 3 observers performing 71% of the BP 
measurements. An expert in hypertension and BP measure-
ment acted as the supervisor, monitoring agreement between 
observers, and changing between the cuff used to perform 
auscultatory measurements and the participant’s home cuff.
All BP measurements were performed according to rec-
ommended guidelines after a 5-minute rest period with the 
participant in the seated position, back supported, and the 
arm resting on a table at heart level.6 Thirty to sixty sec-
onds were observed between measurements. Both observers 
measured BP simultaneously with a double-headed stetho-
scope (3M Littman; St Paul, MN, USA) according to the 
recommended technique. Observers were blinded to each 
other’s results. Subjects were blinded to all readings.
A Baumanometer mercury sphygmomanometer (0250NL; 
Copiague, NY, USA) with mercury column intact and the 
meniscus centered at 0 mm Hg was used. Baum cuffs were 
used for all auscultatory measurements (large cuff bladder 
size 33.5 × 16.5 cm; regular cuff bladder size 22.5 × 12.5 cm). 
Cuff size was selected according to arm circumference (for 
arms 25.0–33.0 cm, a regular adult cuff was used, for arms 
33.1–43.0 cm, a large cuff was used).
Nine Pairs of BP Measurements Were Performed 
Sequentially in Each Subject
Measurement 1 was taken using the appropriately sized 
Baum cuff and mercury sphygmomanometer to introduce the 
subject to the procedure and familiarize the observers with the 
subject’s Korotkoff sounds. For measurement 2, the subject’s 
home BP monitor and cuff were used. Measurements 1 and 
2 were not used in the analysis. For Measurements 3–9, we 
alternated between the Baum cuff/mercury sphygmomanom-
eter (measurements 3, 5, 7, and 9) and the participant’s home 
BP cuff/monitor (measurements 4, 6, and 8). BP results with a 
between-observer difference of more than 4 mm Hg were dis-
carded and the measurement was repeated. The mean of the 
reference (Baum cuff/mercury sphygmomanometer) readings 
was used as the overall estimate of the reference measurement. 
The mean of the home BP cuff/monitor was similarly used as 
the overall estimate of the home BP measurement.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Auscultatory readings were used as the reference standard. 
Descriptive analyses were first performed, including calcula-
tion of means, medians, and proportions. Mean differences 
in systolic and diastolic BP between the auscultatory and 
home BP measurements and corresponding SD were calcu-
lated. In categorical analyses, the proportion of patients with 
device-to-auscultatory differences in systolic or diastolic BP 
of ≥5, 10, and 15 mm Hg were tabulated.

Accuracy of Home BP Devices in Use
Exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted by 
cuff site (upper arm vs. wrist), device brand (Omron vs. 
Miscellaneous), validation status (validated vs. nonvalidated), 
and cuff design (soft vs. hard). Linear regression models were 
constructed to identify statistically significant predictors of 
change in systolic and diastolic BP. Model covariates included 
age, sex, race, arm circumference, medical comorbidi-
ties, cuff site, cuff design, validation status, device age, and 
device brand. Age, sex, hypertensive status, and cuff site were 
included in each model. Additional covariates with P values 
<0.20 on univariable analysis were then included.
Two-tailed paired t-tests were used to compute P values 
for comparisons between home devices and auscultation. P 
values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. SAS 9.3 
(Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses.
RESULTS
Of 87 subjects, one was excluded because of exces-
sively high diastolic BP (>120 mm Hg) and one because 
between-observer auscultatory measurements were not 
within 4 mm Hg and this was not identified at the time of 
measurement, leaving 85 subjects in the final study sample. 
Mean auscultatory measurements taken by observer 1 were 
128.9 ± 14.7/72.5 ± 9.3 mm Hg and corresponding values 
for observer 2 were 129.1 ± 14.7/73.5 ± 9.4, with between-
observer mean differences of −0.2 ± 0.9/−1.0 ± 1.4.
Baseline Characteristics
Mean age was 66.4 ± 11.0 years, mean arm circumference 
was 32.7 ± 3.7 cm, 54% were female, and 78% had a past his-
tory of hypertension or were on antihypertensive medica-
tions; 59 (66%) devices were validated. Omron devices were 
used in 46 (54%) subjects. Thirteen other device brands com-
prised the “Miscellaneous” category, with Life Source and 
Life Brand being most common, collectively used in 20 (24%) 
subjects. Soft cuffs were more common (57%) than hard ones 
(44%) and the mean device age was 6.1 years. Seventy-nine 
devices used upper arm cuffs and 6 used wrist cuffs. Other 
baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Mean BP Comparisons
Mean BP levels were 125.7 ± 14.0/73.9 ± 10.4 mm Hg for 
the home BP device group and 129.0 ± 14.7/72.9 ± 9.3 mm 
Hg for auscultation, with a between-method difference of 
−3.3 ± 7.3/0.9 ± 6.1 mm Hg (P values <0.0001 for systolic BP 
and 0.17 for diastolic BP; Table 2).
Subgroup analyses are summarized in Table 2. In general, 
larger mean differences between methods were observed for 
wrist cuffs (vs. upper arm), Omron devices (vs. “Miscellaneous”), 
and hard cuffs (vs. soft). Validated devices exhibited slightly 
higher mean differences but less variability in this difference.
Categorical Analyses
The number of subjects with systolic or diastolic BP differ-
ences between the 2 methods of ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 mm Hg are 
summarized in Table 3. Categorical analyses by systolic and 
diastolic BP and by subgroup are also summarized in Table 3. 
The results of the categorical analyses by subgroup were 
consistent with the mean differences by subgroup analyses 
described above. The percentage of subjects with systolic or 
diastolic differences of ≥5 mm Hg was greater for wrist cuffs 
(vs. upper arm), nonvalidated devices (vs. validated), Omron 
devices (vs. “Miscellaneous”), and hard cuffs (vs. soft).
Regression Models
Results of the regression models are summarized in 
Table 4. Male sex (parameter estimate 3.22; P value 0.04) and 
increasing arm circumference (0.61; 0.004) were significant

predictors of a systolic BP difference. Increasing age (0.16; 
0.01), increasing arm circumference (0.38; 0.03), hard cuff
 
design (3.81; 0.002), and increasing device age (−0.24; 0.03) 
were significant predictors of a diastolic BP difference.
DISCUSSION
In summary, although the mean BP differences between 
home BP monitors and auscultation were within 5 mm Hg, 
over two-thirds of devices tested exhibited a systolic or dias-
tolic BP difference of ≥5 mm Hg, a degree of BP difference 
considered to be clinically important.11,13 Several prior stud-
ies have examined the accuracy of individual patient’s home 
BP monitors.14–20 Of these, one study employed 2-observer 
auscultation with a mercury sphygmomanometer but the 
mean of the observer’s readings was not used (rather, the 
closest reading to that of the device was used) and accuracy 
was defined as an absolute device-to-reference standard dif-
ference of ≤4 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP (rather 
than ≤5 mm Hg).16 This study reported that 72% of the 
554 devices tested (171 upper arm and 383 wrist) were not 
accurate, findings very similar to those of the present study. 
In another study, single-observer mercury-based ausculta-
tion was used and 5 measurements were taken (3 with the 
home device and 2 with the mercury sphygmomanometer).20 
Nearly 15% of devices were inaccurate (5 mm Hg difference 
from mercury-based auscultation). The proportion of home 
devices considered inaccurate was greater for nonvalidated 
devices (19%) compared to validated ones (7%).20
Statistically significant predictors of either a systolic 
or diastolic BP difference between measurement meth-
ods included older subject age, male sex, increasing arm 
circumference, a hard cuff design, and increasing device 
age. Most of these factors are known or suspected to affect 
oscillometric device measurement accuracy by prevent-
ing optimal limb-appropriate cuff fit, altering pulse pres-
sure, and/or causing vascular stiffness.9,20–22 Indeed, in an 
analysis of 5,070 oscillometric office device measurements 
taken in 755 patients, pulse pressure and arm circumference 
were the most consistent predictors of unreliable measure-
ments, defined as a difference from single-observer same-
arm simultaneous mercury-based sphygmomanometry of

Accuracy of Home BP Devices in Use
>10 mm Hg.21 Regarding device age, we speculate that this 
association may result from variations in device algorithms 
over time. Interestingly, our finding was not explained by 
deterioration of device accuracy over time because older 
devices appeared more accurate. After dichotomizing device 
age above and below the mean of 6.1 years, mean differences 
from auscultation were −1.1 ± 7.6/−0.01 ± 5.9 for older 
devices compared to −4.4 ± 7.0/1.4 ± 6.2 for newer ones.
In aggregate, the findings of the present study and past 
research indicate the importance of confirming that a given 
oscillometric device is accurate when used to measure BP 
in its owner. While abbreviated versions of BP validation 
standard protocols have been proposed as a compromisory 
and pragmatic solution to enable clinicians to more easily 
and rapidly assess device accuracy in the clinic, this proposal 
is unlikely to be implemented in a busy clinical setting.18 
A separate, stand-alone service to verify accuracy is a poten-
tial alternative solution, but feasibility and economic viabil-
ity are unproven. An additional question raised by these 
findings is whether the acceptable margin of error of oscillo-
metric devices is, in general, considered too lax and whether 
tightening this margin would lead to greater accuracy in 
individual patients. The proprietary nature of the algorithms 
used to determine BP from oscillometric measurements 
and the lack of open display of the oscillometric waveforms 
and waveform envelopes has hampered progress by aca-
demic institutions and in the public domain. Indeed, even 
fundamental discoveries, such as conclusively establishing

Ringrose et al.
an oscillometric “marker” for systolic and diastolic BP have 
yet to take place. Given these challenges, further research 
into the oscillometric technique and the factors accounting 
for discrepancies against reference quality auscultation is 
required.23 This would enable development of more accurate 
oscillometric devices.
In the present analysis, mean differences from the refer-
ence standard were slightly lower for unvalidated devices 
compared to validated ones; however, the variability around 
this difference was higher for unvalidated devices. Still, 
the overall results for unvalidated and validated devices 
were relatively similar, indicating that prior validation did 
not ensure more accurate results. This contrasts with the 
results of prior studies, which found that previously vali-
dated devices were more accurate than unvalidated ones.16,20 
However, in the largest of these 2 studies, the proportion of 
inaccurate validated devices was still relatively high at 32%.16 
It is possible, given these findings, that current validation 
standards are too lax in terms of their requirements for accu-
racy. Furthermore, performance of a validation study may 
not guarantee accuracy if the validation study is not con-
ducted rigorously. Indeed, validation study procedures and 
data may not be made available for public review (there is 
no requirement in any current standard to even list the con-
tact information of the principle investigator or test center 
that performed the validation study) and, to our knowledge, 
no certification of validation study test centers is required to 
ensure that studies are being performed properly. We suspect 
that there is little appreciation or awareness of these issues 
amongst consumers and clinicians. Indeed, even hyperten-
sion societies that “endorse” products based on the avail-
ability of validation data, as indicated by listing in an online 
registry for example, likely do not review the data directly 
and may not be aware of these potential limitations of some 
validation studies.
Strengths of this study include use of 2-observer auscul-
tation with a mercury sphygmomanometer as the reference 
standard and assessment of device accuracy under “real 
world” conditions, whereby devices were tested on their 
owners. Limitations include the underpowered subgroup 
analyses, which were exploratory in nature, and the relative 
dearth of study subjects with advanced age, severe obesity, 
vascular disease, and other comorbidities (limiting general-
izability). Regarding the latter, we expect that accuracy may 
be compromised to a greater extent in these patient popu-
lations because of arterial stiffness and/or widened pulse 
pressure. Further study to confirm or refute this hypothesis 
is clearly warranted. One final potential limitation is selec-
tion bias. Participants who volunteered for this study may 
have had suspicions regarding the inaccuracy of their home 
machines.
In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that home BP 
monitors are not acceptably accurate to within 5 mm Hg 
in nearly 70% of patients and that arm circumference is a 
consistent and important predictor of BP differences. These 
findings indicate the need to assess and optimize the device-
subject pairing, but operationalizing this objective will be 
difficult. Further, improving the accuracy of these commonly 
used, guideline-endorsed devices should be urgently prior-
itized. A more individualized approach to the derivation of 
BP from the oscillometric data is needed.23 The lack of accu-
racy is not widely appreciated or understood by the clinicians 
recommending or the patients using these devices. Greater 
collaboration between industry and academia would be an 
important first step towards optimizing oscillometric device 
accuracy in individual patients.
