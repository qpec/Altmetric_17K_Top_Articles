Sigmoidoscopy Screening randomised controlled trial

Summary
Background Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. Previous analyses have only reported 
follow-up after flexible sigmoidoscopy for a maximum of 12 years. We aimed to examine colorectal cancer incidence 
and mortality after a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screening and 17 years of follow-up. 
Methods In this multicentre randomised trial (UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial), done between 
Nov 14, 1994, and March 30, 1999, 170 432 eligible men and women, who had indicated on a previous questionnaire 
that they would probably attend screening if invited, were randomly assigned (1:2) to an intervention group (offered 
flexible sigmoidoscopy screening) or a control group (not contacted). Randomisation was done centrally in blocks 
of 12, and stratified by trial centre, general practice, and household type. The nature of the intervention did not allow 
the staff to be masked to arm of the trial; however, randomisation was done in batches so that the control group and 
participants not yet randomised were unaware of their allocation status. The primary outcomes were incidence and 
mortality of colorectal cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were 
estimated for intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 28352761.
Findings Our cohort analysis included 170 034 people: 112 936 in the control group and 57 098 in the intervention 
group, 40 621 (71%) of whom were screened and 16 477 (29%) were not screened. During screening and a median of 
17·1 years’ follow-up, colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 1230 individuals in the intervention group and 3253 in the 
control group, and 353 individuals in the intervention group versus 996 individuals in the control group died from 
colorectal cancer. In intention-to-treat analyses, colorectal cancer incidence was reduced by 26% (HR 0·74 [95% CI 
0·70–0·80]; p<0·0001) in the intervention group versus the control group and colorectal cancer mortality was reduced 
by 30% (0·70 [0·62–0·79]; p<0·0001) in the intervention group versus the control group. In per-protocol analyses, 
adjusted for non-compliance, colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were 35% (HR 0·65 [95% CI 0·59–0·71]) and 
41% (0·59 [0·49–0·70]) lower in the screened group.
Interpretation A single flexible sigmoidoscopy continues to provide substantial protection from colorectal cancer 
diagnosis and death, with protection lasting at least 17 years.

Introduction
The UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial (UKFSST) 
is examining the magnitude and duration of effect of a 
single flexible sigmoidoscopy screening, between ages 
55 years and 64 years, on colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality. We previously reported results from the trial, 
which showed that as well as being safe and well accepted, 
flexible sigmoidoscopy produces a substantial and 
sustained reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality that lasts for at least 11 years.1,2 Among those 
individuals attending screening in the UKFSST, colorectal 
cancer incidence was reduced by 33%, distal colorectal 
cancer incidence by 50%, and colorectal cancer mortality 
by 43%. Similar findings have since been reported by 
two further trials examining the effectiveness of a single 
flexible sigmoidoscopy at 55 years to 64 years, in Italy and 
Norway, with 11 years of follow-up.3,4
On the basis of an independent economic analysis using 
the UKFSST results, the UK National Screening 
Committee approved the addition of a single flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screen at age 55 years to the English Bowel 
Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) in 2011.5 The BCSP 
already included two-yearly guaiac faecal occult blood 
testing (gFOBT) offered from ages 60 years to 74 years. 
Roll out of the flexible sigmoidoscopy programme started 
in 2013. The aim is for full population coverage to be 
achieved in 2021; at the time of writing, flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screening was being offered by 62 (97%) of 
the 64 BCSP screening centres (National Health 
Service Bowel Cancer Screening programme, personal 
communication). 
However, 
flexible 
sigmoidoscopy 
screening is resource intensive and needs to have long-
term efficacy in preventing colorectal cancer diagnoses 
and deaths to be cost-effective. Furthermore, in view of

longer life expectancies, higher incidence of colorectal 
cancer with increasing age, and worse outcomes in older 
individuals,6 it is desirable that a single flexible 
sigmoidoscopy retains its efficacy into old age.
We aimed to examine the efficacy of a single flexible 
sigmoidoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer incidence 
and mortality rates after a median of 17 years’ follow-up 
overall as well as by sex and age group. We also examine 
the potential contaminating effect of exposure to gFOBT 
in the BCSP on outcomes.
Methods
Study design and participants
The trial rationale and methodology are described 
elsewhere.1,2,7,8 Briefly, between Nov 14, 1994 and March 
30, 1999, participants were recruited from general practices 
serving 14 UK hospitals. Men and women aged 55 years to 
64 years were eligible to take part unless they had a history 
of colorectal cancer, adenomas, or inflammatory bowel 
disease; a life expectancy of less than 5 years; received a 
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy within the previous 
3 years; or were unable to provide informed consent. 
Eligible patients were sent a questionnaire to assess their 
interest in having a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen.
Ethical approval was obtained from local research 
ethics committees, and all participants undergoing 
screening provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Those individuals who expressed interest in having a 
single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen were randomly 
assigned to the control group or intervention group (2:1), 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
To date, three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested 
our hypothesis, published in The Lancet in 1993, that a single 
flexible sigmoidoscopy examination at around age 60 years is 
an effective strategy to prevent colorectal cancer; these are the 
UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial (UKFSST), the Italian 
SCORE (Screening for COlon REctum) trial, and the Norwegian 
Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial (NORCCAP). Following 
recruitment and screening of people aged between 55 years 
and 64 years, all three trials reported that the test was safe and 
well accepted and did not cause any increase in anxiety. 
In 2010, we published the major outcomes of the UKFSST study 
after a median follow-up of 11 years. We reported that a single 
flexible sigmoidoscopy examination reduced colorectal cancer 
incidence by 33% and colorectal cancer mortality by 43%. 
Subsequently, SCORE and NORCCAP published similar results, 
confirming the efficacy of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy after 
a median follow-up of 11 years. As yet, there is no published 
evidence on how long the protective effect of a single flexible 
sigmoidoscopy lasts beyond 11 years of follow-up.
Added value of this study
In this study we present the outcomes of the UKFSST after a 
median follow-up of 17 years. The UKFSST is the largest trial 
examining the effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy in 
reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates 
(n=170 432) and has a sufficient sample size to examine the 
effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in men and women 
separately. Long-term follow-up is crucial to our understanding 
of whether the efficacy of once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening is sustained into older, higher colorectal cancer 
incidence age groups, and for determining cost-effectiveness.
Data from this large trial, where the cohort is now aged 
between 72 years and 81 years, shows that once-only flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screening continues to provide substantial 
protection from colorectal cancer diagnosis and death, in both 
men and women, with little attenuation of effect during 
prolonged follow-up. As a result of the continuing effectiveness 
of the test into older age, estimates of the number of people 
who need to be screened to prevent one colorectal cancer 
diagnosis have halved, from almost 200 (after 11 years of 
follow-up), to less than 100 (after 17 years of follow-up).
Implications of all the available evidence
The three RCTs have shown that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy 
is a safe, well accepted, and effective screening strategy for the 
prevention of colorectal cancer. Together, the trials provide 
important data to inform national colorectal cancer screening 
policy in high incidence countries. In 2010, following 
publication of the results of the UKFSST, the UK National 
Screening Committee approved the addition of a single flexible 
sigmoidoscopy at age 55 years to the existing NHS Bowel 
Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP). The BCSP already offered 
two yearly guaiac faecal occult blood testing between ages 
60 years and 74 years.
New screening tests are always under consideration and it is 
essential to generate high-quality data to compare 
cost-effectiveness. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is an expensive 
and invasive test, but it has three distinct advantages over 
blood and stool tests. First, it is highly sensitive for small lesions 
and so neoplasia is detectable at a very early stage. Second, 
most lesions can be removed at the time of screening, so the 
screening in most cases is both diagnostic and therapeutic. 
Last, results from this study suggest that the test might not 
need to be repeated.
This new evidence, showing the longevity of effect of a single 
flexible sigmoidoscopy and the profound reduction over the 
past 6 years of follow-up in the number of people who need to 
be screened to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis, 
provides crucial data to help to inform health economic models 
commissioned by the UK National Screening Committee on the 
continued use of flexible sigmoidoscopy as part of the national 
BCSP in England.

unless they had reported meeting any of the exclusion 
criteria in the questionnaire, or if the required number of 
participants for the trial had been reached. Sequentially 
numbered randomisation was done centrally in blocks 
of 12, with stratification by trial centre, general practice, 
and household type. Due to the nature of the procedure 
masking of care staff and the intervention group was not 
possible. However, randomisation was done in batches 
so that the control group and participants not yet 
randomised were unaware of their allocation status. To 
avoid confusion within households if eligible members 
of the same household were allocated to different arms of 
the trial, potentially resulting in the wrong person 
attending screening, randomisation was at the household 
level rather than individual level.
Procedures
The intervention group was offered flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening followed by colonoscopy if high-risk polyps 
were found (defined as ≥1 cm; ≥3 adenomas; tubulovillous 
or villous histology; severe dysplasia or malignant disease; 
or ≥20 hyperplastic polyps above the distal rectum). The 
control group was not contacted.
Data for cancer registrations, date of death, cause of 
death, and emigrations were provided by national sources 
(English, Welsh and Scottish cancer registries, National 
Health Service [NHS] Digital, NHS National Services 
Scotland [NSS], the NHS Central Register [NHSCR] and 
the Office for National Statistics [ONS]). The cohort was 
matched with the NHS BCSP database and data for 
involvement with the programme was collected; data for 
invitations and completion of gFOBT kits was used for 
this analysis. Previous events that had not been accounted 
for at the time of randomisation were identified from the 
cancer, death, and emigration data received from national 
sources during follow-up, and analysis of the recent data 
showed changes that affected the eligibility of some 
participants. Where necessary, further exclusions were 
applied in the current analytical cohort (appendix p 1).
Colorectal cancer sites were defined by the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), and 
included codes C18–C20. Distal cancer was defined as 
C18.7, C19, and C20 (rectum and sigmoid colon) and 
proximal cancer as C18.0–C18.6 (descending colon to the 
caecum). Morphology of colorectal cancer was coded 
with ICD-02 codes. We included all codes relating to 
invasive adenocarcinomas (8140/3 8144/3, 8210/3, 
8213/3, 8260/3, 8261/3, 8262/3, 8263/3, 8480/3, 8481/3, 
8490/3, 8574/3), and carcinoma not otherwise specified 
(8000/3, 8010/3, 8020/3) for colorectal cancers that were 
diagnosed on clinical grounds only.
Deaths in patients with an incident colorectal cancer 
during follow-up were included as an endpoint in the 
analysis of cause-specific mortality if colorectal cancer 
was certified by ONS coding as the underlying cause. As 
certified underlying causes of deaths are still not 
completely accurate, with the potential for differential 
misattribution by trial arm,9 a second analysis was done 
after verification of assignment of colorectal cancer as 
the underlying cause of death for deaths that had not 
been certified as such by ONS. The verification was 
undertaken blindly by an independent expert coder 
(DMP) according to rules described in the appendix (p 1) 
to the trial results previously reported in 2010.2
Outcomes
This analysis included follow-up through to Dec 31, 2014. 
The primary outcomes were colorectal cancer incidence 
and mortality, and secondary outcomes were distal 
colorectal cancer (rectum and sigmoid) and proximal colon 
cancer incidence and mortality, all-cause and non-colorectal 
cancer mortality, and the number needed to screen (NNS) 
to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis or death. In the 
estimation of incidence outcomes, only one colorectal 
cancer per patient was counted: the earliest colorectal cancer 
diagnosed for the incidence of all-site colorectal cancer and 
the earliest colorectal cancer in that site category for site-
specific incidence. All time-to-event data were censored at 
emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Time to colorectal 
cancer and death was shown using one minus the Kaplan-
Meier estimator of the survival function.
Statistical analysis
Assuming an attendance rate at screening of 55%, 
two-sided significance level of α=0·05, and a Poisson 
distribution for the number of events, the original 
sample size of the trial was calculated to give 79% or 
more power in those aged 55–59 years and 90% or more 
power in those aged 60–64 years to detect a 20% difference 
between the intervention group and control group in 
colorectal cancer incidence at 10 years and mortality at 
15 years since randomisation. Because screening 
attendance rates were greater than predicted, revised 
estimates indicated sufficient mortality endpoints would 
be acquired at 11 years.10
Intention-to-treat 
analyses, 
which 
examined 
the 
effectiveness of an invitation for screening, were 
undertaken using univariable Cox proportional hazards 
models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Per-
protocol analyses, which examined the effectiveness of 
having the flexible sigmoidoscopy screening, used the 
method developed by Cuzick and colleagues11 to estimate 
HRs and 95% CIs adjusted for non-compliance. 
Annual incidence rate ratios (IRR) by years of follow-up 
since randomisation for all-site and distal colorectal cancer 
comparing intervention and control groups were 
estimated with exact 95% CIs for the first 16 years of 
follow-up, after which we had incomplete data. Per-
protocol annual IRRs were estimated with adjustment for 
non-compliance.11 The NNS to prevent one colorectal 
cancer or one death due to colorectal cancer, with 95% CIs, 
were calculated using the method by Tabar and 
colleagues,12 which estimates the NNS by dividing the 
number attending screening by the total events prevented

in the invited to screening group. Subgroup analyses were 
done by sex and age group (55–59 years and 60–64 years) 
and differences were examined using tests for interaction.
In sensitivity analyses that were not prespecified as part 
of the trial protocol, we examined the potential effect of 
contamination by gFOBT screening within the English 
BCSP. We identified all members of the UKFSST cohort 
who were screened with gFOBT as part of the BCSP and 
examined the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy with and 
without gFOBT screening by including an indicator for 
gFOBT screening participation as a time varying covariate 
in the Cox model and performing tests of interaction. 
People could contribute to both not-participated and 
participated follow-up time, but after participation, a 
person was considered to remain exposed.
We also did sensitivity analyses for the outcome of distal 
colorectal cancer incidence where the descending colon 
(ICD-10 code C18.6) was included as distal. Due to the 
violation of the proportionality assumption for the 
outcomes of all-site and distal colorectal cancer incidence, 
we did sensitivity analyses in which we fitted exponential 
regression models incorporating a time threshold at 
2 years, approximately where the hazard rate in the 
intervention group changed, and estimated the average 
relative rate adjusted for this. In addition, we did sensitivity 
analyses where the block randomisation structure was 
accounted for in the Cox regression models. A stratum was 
created for each combination of trial centre, general 
practice, and household type and models were fitted 
allowing for separate baseline hazards for each stratum as 
well as with standard errors adjusted for within strata 
correlation. Our main analyses assumed that persons 
within a household were independent; however, as the unit 
of randomisation was household and not individual, we did 
sensitivity analyses that accounted for the clustering by 
household and allowed for potentially complete dependence 
within households. Cox regression analyses were 
performed and the follow-up time of any other members of 
a household were censored at the date of first event within 
a household. No allowance for multiplicity was made in the 
analyses. All data were analysed with Stata 13.1.
The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 28352761.

Results
375 744 men and women aged 55–64 years were originally 
identified from 506 general practices of whom 7602 were 
excluded by their general practitioner (appendix p 1). The 
remaining 368 142 people were sent a questionnaire to 
assess their interest in having flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening. Of the 194 726 (53%) expressing interest, a 
further 8280 were found to be ineligible and 16 014 were 
not required because the 40 000 participants for which 
the trial was funded had been reached. The remaining 
170 432 were randomly assigned; 113 195 to the control 
group and 57 237 to the intervention group.
In both the intervention group and the control group, 
the mean age at randomisation was 60 years (SD 2·9) and 
29 103 (51%) in the intervention group and 57 597 (51%) in 
the control group were women. Details of the baseline 
findings at screening, adverse outcomes, and satisfaction 
of the study participants can be found in a previous 
publication.1
Of 40 674 (71%) participants in the intervention group 
who underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy screening with 
polypectomy for small polyps, 18 were referred to surgery 
without colonoscopy, 2131 (5%) were referred for 
colonoscopy with high-risk polyps, and 38 525 (95%) 
were discharged with low-risk polyps or no polyps found.1
After the cohort was matched with the most recent data 
provided by national sources, 160 people were found to 
have died, 224 had colorectal cancer diagnosed and two had 
emigrated, all before the date of randomisation and were 
excluded from the analysis (appendix p 1). An additional 
person, outside of the age range, attended screening and 
was also excluded. Finally, 11 individuals had been 
randomly assigned twice (duplicate study numbers) so the 
second randomisation was invalidated (appendix p 1).
Our cohort analysis included 170 034 people: 112 936 in 
the control group and 57 098 in the intervention group, 
40 621 (71%) of whom were screened and 16 477 (29%) 
were not screened. The median follow-up time from 
randomisation to death, emigration, loss to follow-up, or 
Dec 31, 2014, was 17·1 years (IQR 16·4–17·8; table 1).
During 
screening 
and 
subsequent 
follow-up, 
4483 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer 
(3253 in the control group and 1230 in the intervention 
group). Distal colorectal cancers were diagnosed in 
1987 people in the control group and 592 in the 
intervention group, of which 126 were detected at 
screening. Proximal colon cancers were diagnosed in 
1255 people in the control group and 612 in the 
intervention group, with 14 detected at screening (table 2).
In an intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of all-site 
colorectal cancer was reduced by 26% (HR 0·74 [95% CI 
0·70–0·80] p<0·0001; table 2, figure 1A) and distal 
colorectal cancer incidence was reduced by 41% 
(0·59 [0·54–0·64]; p<0·0001; table 2, figure 1C) in those 
invited to screening. No significant effect on proximal 
colon cancer incidence was noted (HR 0·96 [95% CI 
0·87–1·06]; p=0·436; table 2; figure 1E).

In a per-protocol analysis, which examined effectiveness 
in those individuals having flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening, colorectal cancer incidence was reduced by 35% 
for all-site colorectal cancer (HR 0·65 [96% CI 0·59–0·71]) 
and by 56% for distal colorectal cancer (0·44 [0·38–0·50]); 
no significant effect on proximal colon cancer incidence 
was noted (0·95 [0·83–1·09]; table 3; figure 1B, 1D, 1F).
During the first 4 years after screening, cumulative 
incidence rates for all-site and distal colorectal cancers 
were higher in the intervention group than in the control 
group because of the detection of prevalent cancers at 
flexible sigmoidoscopy screening. Thereafter, the curves 
began to diverge as symptomatic cancers were diagnosed 
more frequently in the control group than in the 
intervention group (figure 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D). Proximal 
colon cancer incidence did not differ significantly 
between the control group and the intervention group at 
any time during follow-up (figure 1E, 1F).
Annual IRRs for all-site and distal colorectal cancers 
were below 1 throughout follow-up, except for an initial 
peak in the first year representing the detection of 
prevalent cancers at screening (figure 2). In per-protocol 
analyses, the average annual IRR for all-site colorectal 
cancer was 0·48 over years 6–10 and 0·61 over years 11–16 
(figure 2B) and for distal colorectal cancer was 0·26 
and 0·31, respectively (figure 2D).
The estimated NNS to prevent a single colorectal 
cancer diagnosis over a median of 17 years was 98 (95% CI 
81–125; table 4). This compares with 191 (95% CI 145–277) 
after 11 years, previously published.2
The effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy in reducing distal 
colorectal cancer incidence did not differ between men 
and women in either intention-to-treat (42% vs 40%, 
respectively) or per-protocol analysis (56% for both men 
and women; table 5). Flexible sigmoidoscopy had no 
significant effect on proximal colon cancer incidence in 
either men or women, whereas the reduction in all-site 
colorectal cancer incidence was less in women than in 
men in both intention-to-treat (19% vs 30%, p=0·0467) 
and per-protocol analysis (27% vs 40%, p=0·0480; table 5). 
No significant interaction was noted between flexible 
sigmoidoscopy and sex in effect on incidence of distal or 
proximal cancers, either in intention-to-treat or per-
protocol analyses, but a substantial proportion of the 
heterogeneity by sex in the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy 
on all-site colorectal cancer was due to the higher

proportion of proximal cancers in women than men 
(45·1% vs 34·4%; table 5).
The NNS to prevent a colorectal cancer diagnosis was 
more than twice as high for women as for men 
(165 [95% 113–308) vs 70 [57–91]). The main contributors to 
this were the lower incidence of colorectal cancer in the 
control group in women than in men (22·1 vs 35·8 per 1000; 
table 4) and the weaker effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy on 
all-site colorectal cancer in women than in men.
Examination of the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy by 
age at randomisation showed similar findings for those 
aged 55–59 years and those aged 60–64 years for 
incidence of all colorectal cancers and by subsite in both 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, with no 
evidence for an interaction by age (table 5). For example, 
in intention-to-treat analyses, risk for all-site colorectal 
cancer was 26% lower in those offered screening aged 
55–59 years compared with 25% lower in those aged 
60–64 years (p=0·840); for distal cancer, the risks were 
44% lower in the younger age group and 39% lower in 
the older age group (p=0·344). The NNS to prevent a 
colorectal cancer diagnosis was 111 (95% CI 85–161) in 
the those aged 55–59 years and 87 (68–122) in those aged 
60–64 years (table 4).
The effect of age was also examined within each 
sex; although no significant heterogeneity was noted 
(appendix pp 2–3). In intention-to-treat analyses, the 
incidence of distal colorectal cancer was reduced by 47% in 
men aged 55–59 years and 37% in men aged 60–64 years; 
for women, the risks were reduced by 39% and 42% in 
each of the age groups, respectively. In per-protocol 
analyses, a similar pattern was noted; among men, the 
risk for distal colorectal cancer was 61% and 52% lower in 
the younger and older age groups, respectively, and among 
women, the risks were 53% and 59% lower, respectively.
During follow-up, 39 688 (23%) people died: 26 409 (23%) 
in the control group and 13 279 (23%) in the intervention 
group. 693 deaths were attributed to distal colorectal 
cancer and 588 to proximal colon cancer (544 and 149 to 
distal colorectal cancer and 403 and 185 to proximal colon 
cancer in the control and intervention groups, respectively; 
table 2). In an intention-to-treat analysis of certified deaths, 
all-site colorectal cancer mortality was reduced by 30% 
(HR 0·70 [95% CI 0·62–0·79]; p<0·0001); distal colorectal

cancer mortality by 46% (0·54 [0·45–0·65]; p<0·0001) and 
proximal colon cancer mortality by a non-significant 9% 
(0·91 [0·76–1·08]; 0·262; table 2). An additional 255 deaths 
were attributed to colorectal cancer after verification by the 
independent coder (192 in the control group and 63 in the 
intervention group) but the reduction in all-site colorectal 
cancer mortality remained unchanged (HR 0·69 
[0·62–0·77]; appendix p 4).
In the per-protocol analysis, the reduction in colorectal 
cancer mortality in the screened group was 41% (HR 0·59 
[95% CI 0·49–0·70]; table 3). Distal colorectal cancer 
mortality was reduced by 66% (HR 0·34 [95% CI 
0·26–0·46]), and proximal colon cancer mortality was 
reduced by 12%, although it did not reach statistical 
significance (0·88 [0·70–1·10]; table 3).
The estimated NNS to prevent one death from certified 
colorectal cancer over a median of 17 years was 
270 (95% CI 204–397; table 4). The NNS to prevent one 
verified colorectal cancer death was 220 (95% CI 171–307). 
This compares with 489 (95% CI 343–852) and 
402 (291–647), respectively, at 11 years.2
Interactions between flexible sigmoidoscopy and sex on 
all site and distal colorectal cancer mortality were not 
significant. All-site colorectal cancer mortality was reduced 
by 33% and 26% in men and women in intention-to-treat 
analysis, and by 45% and 35% in per-protocol analysis, 
whereas distal colorectal cancer mortality was reduced by 
49% and 39% in intention-to-treat analysis and by 68% and 
61% in per-protocol analysis, respectively (table 5). 
However, the NNS to prevent a colorectal cancer death was 
nearly twice as high for women as for men (402 [249– 1039] 
vs 204 [149–323]). This finding was due to lower colorectal 
cancer mortality rates in the control group in women than 
in the men (6·8 per 1000 vs 11·0 per 1000; table 4).
The effects of flexible sigmoidoscopy on colorectal 
cancer mortality were similar in the two categories of 
age at randomisation examined. For all-site colorectal 
cancer mortality, the risk reduction in those invited to 
screening was 33% in the younger age group 
(55–59 years)  and 28% in the older age group 
(60–64 years); for distal cancer mortality, the risk 
reduction was 49% and 44% in each of the age groups, 
respectively (table 5). The NNS to prevent a colorectal 
cancer death was 288 (95% CI 201–507) in the those 
aged 55–59 years and 252 (172–470) in those aged 
60–64 years (table 4).
The effect of age within each sex did not show any 
significant differences (appendix pp 2–3). In intention-
to-treat analyses, the risk of distal colorectal cancer 
mortality was 51% lower in men aged 55–59 years and 
48% lower in men aged 60–64 years; for women, the risks 
were 46% and 34% lower in each of the age groups, 
respectively. In per-protocol analyses, the risk for distal 
colorectal cancer mortality in men was 73% and 
64% lower in the 55–59 year age group and 60–64 year 
age groups, respectively, and among women, the risks 
were 74% and 51% lower, respectively.

In a sensitivity analysis, we investigated the effect of 
contamination by the BCSP, by examining the effect of 
flexible sigmoidoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality with and without participation in gFOBT 
screening. About 30% of the control and intervention 
groups were screened using gFOBT at least once: 
34 237 (30·3%) people in the control group and 
16 834 (29·5%) people in the intervention group. A median 
of 11·3 years (IQR 10·2–12·8) had elapsed between 
randomisation and first screen by gFOBT, and 1577 (1·4%) 
people in the control group and 688 (1·2%) in the 
intervention group tested positive at least once. The effect 
of flexible sigmoidoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence 
and mortality did not differ significantly with and without 
gFOBT screening in the BCSP (appendix p 5); the 
reduction in all-site colorectal cancer incidence was 
27% and 25% with and without participation, respectively 
(pheterogeneity=0·80), and 48% and 40%, respectively, for distal 
colorectal cancer (p heterogeneity=0·35; appendix p 5).
The effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy on distal colorectal 
cancer incidence and mortality was very slightly 
weakened when the definition of distal was expanded to 
also include descending colon cancers. In intention-to-
treat analyses, distal colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality was 39% (HR 0·61 [95% CI 0·56–0·67]) and 
44% (0·56 [0·47–0·66]) lower, respectively, in the 
screened versus the control group (appendix p 6).
The use of models that allowed for non-proportional 
hazards for the analysis of the outcomes of all-site and 
distal colorectal cancer incidence did not provide materially 
different results from those generated from the Cox 
proportional hazards models. Additionally, the results 
generated from models that accounted for the block 
randomisation structure were similar to those from 
models that did not account for this. Analyses that 
accounted for the clustering by household provided results 
very similar to those presented in table 2 (appendix p 7).
Discussion
Results of three randomised trials, including our UK 
study, have reported that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy 
examination between 55 years and 64 years of age confers 
a substantial reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality that lasts at least 11 years.2–4 We now present the 
first randomised trial evidence that protection from a 
single flexible sigmoidoscopy remains substantial with 
even longer follow-up.
The median follow-up time in this analysis was 17 years 
during which incidence of colorectal cancer at all sites in 
screened patients was reduced by 35%, and distal cancer 
incidence was reduced by 56%. This compares with 
reductions of 33% and 50%, respectively, after a median 
of 11 years we reported in 2010.2 Consistent with this 
finding, the NNS to prevent one colorectal cancer 
diagnosis had almost halved since the last report, from 
191 after 11 years of follow-up to 98 after 17 years. These 
results suggest that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screen continues to provide long-lasting protection 
against colorectal cancer diagnosis.
The estimated reductions in incidence in the screened 
group include prevalent screen-detected cancers, which 
clearly could not be prevented by screening, and the 
protective effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on 
cumulative incidence rates became apparent only after 
5 years. When distal colorectal cancer incidence was 
analysed from five years, incidence was estimated to be 
reduced by 68% over the remainder of follow-up among 
the screened group. Evidence of the long-term efficacy of 
flexible sigmoidoscopy in reducing distal colorectal cancer 
incidence after screening is apparent from the annual 
IRRs which estimated an average reduction of 74% 
between years 6 and 10, and 69% between years 11 and 16.
Proximal colon cancer incidence and mortality was 
reduced by a non-significant 5% and 12%, respectively. 
This small effect was expected since referral for a 
colonoscopy following flexible sigmoidoscopy screening 
was restricted to those with high-risk polyps, and as a 
result only 5% of the screened group had a colonoscopy. 
Other trials had looser criteria for colonoscopy after flexible 
sigmoidoscopy resulting in higher rates of colonoscopy 
and a greater impact on proximal colon cancer.3,13
For all-site colorectal cancers, the average incidence 
reduction 
after 
flexible 
sigmoidoscopy 
screening 
decreased from 52% over 6–10 years of follow-up, to 
39% over 11–16 years. As a corresponding weakening in 
effect was not noted for distal colorectal cancer incidence, 
the attenuation seen for all-site colorectal cancer was 
probably due to the increasing proportion of cancers 
being proximally located as participants aged. Analysis of 
English colorectal cancer incidence statistics for 2014 
showed that from age 55 years, the proportion of cancers 
located proximally increased from 29% at age 55–59 years 
to 48% at age 80–84 years.14 As our cohort was screened 
by flexible sigmoidoscopy at ages 55–64 years and the age 
of the participants after 17 years’ follow-up ranged from 
72–81 years, the proportion of proximal cancers would be 
expected to have increased over the years of follow-up.
We found that the reduction in distal colorectal cancer 
incidence after a single flexible sigmoidoscopy was the 
same in men and women at 56%. Since flexible 
sigmoidoscopy acts mainly on the distal colon this is 
reassuring and indicates that women are likely to benefit 
to the same extent as men in terms of preventing cancer 
of the rectum and sigmoid colon. However, we observed 
that the effect on all-site colorectal cancer incidence was 
weaker in women as have the US and the Norwegian 
trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening.4,13 This is not 
surprising because rates of proximal colon cancer as a 
proportion of all colorectal cancers is higher in women 
than men particularly at older ages. For example, in 
England in 2014, proximal colon cancers constituted 27·5% 
of colon cancers in men compared with 34% in women at 
age 55 years, whereas at age 80 years the proportions rose 
to 39% and 52%, respectively.14

The increase in proximal cancers with age emphasises 
the importance of screening measures to target cancers in 
the proximal colon, such as colonoscopy. In a large 
observational study of 88 902 individuals over 22 years, 
colonoscopy was associated with a 27% reduction in 
proximal cancer incidence (multivariate HR 0·73 [95% CI 
0·57–0·92).15 Additionally, proximal cancer incidence rates 
in the US decreased by 2·3–2·6% per year between 2000 
and 2008, coinciding with the increased colonoscopy use 
since 2000 (distal colorectal cancer incidence also 
decreased by 2·9–3·5% per year).16 However, in the UK 
and many European countries, population screening by 
colonoscopy is not feasible because of competing demands 
on the use of colonoscopy for investigation of symptomatic 
patients and for surveillance of higher-risk groups. Other 
approved screening tests for colorectal cancer include stool 
occult blood tests, a stool-based multitarget DNA test, and 
methylated Septin9, a blood-based test.17–19 Although these 
tests detect cancers and some precursor lesions in the 
proximal colon,17,18 there is very little data for the effect of 
these tests on proximal colon cancer incidence.
Examining our data by age at randomisation showed 
consistent, and significant reductions for all-site and 
distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in both 
the younger and older age categories when men and 
women were combined and within each sex. By contrast, 
a recent publication of a pooled analysis of three other 
trials reported that flexible sigmoidoscopy was not 
effective in women older than 60 years.20 In addition to 
the heterogeneity between studies, the findings in this 
recent publication were restricted to a median follow-up 
time between 10·5 years and 12·1 years and slightly 
fewer incident colorectal cancers (n=4157) than our trial 
(n=4483). Despite the differences in findings between the 
recent pooled analysis and our trial, the clinical relevance 
of the effect of giving a single flexible sigmoidoscopy 
procedure to an individual older than 60 years is 
restricted because it is unlikely that any screening 
programme would advocate the use of a single flexible 
sigmoidoscopy as late as aged 60 years when it is clearly 
effective when done at a younger age.
Incidence of colorectal cancer increases with age with 
60% of colorectal cancers diagnosed after 70 years. 
Without cancer a person older than 70 years old is likely 
to live at least another decade.6 Older people with 
colorectal cancer are more likely to be diagnosed as an 
emergency and are less likely to be offered curative 
treatment than are younger people. Even if offered 
surgery older people are more likely to die both in the 
short and longer term.6 Our findings that an early, once-
only flexible sigmoidoscopy screen reduces the chance of 
a colorectal cancer diagnosis in the UKFSST cohort, now 
aged between 72 years and 81 years, suggests that this is a 
promising strategy to reduce colorectal cancer and the 
associated health-care burden in older people.
Importantly, we have shown that flexible sigmoidoscopy 
is safe, with rare adverse events, which mostly occur as a 
result of polyp removal.1 Additionally, we reported in 2010 
that all-cause mortality was slightly but not significantly 
reduced in the screened arm of the trial (HR 0·97 
[95% CI 0·94–1·00]; p=0·0519), with no increase in non-
colorectal cancer mortality.2
Our trial has several strengths. We have estimated the 
effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen over a long 
follow-up period of an average of 17 years and are the first 
to publish findings over such a long period. Our large 
sample size and the fact that 75% of the cohort was still 
living after a median of 17 years of follow-up since 
screening, provided an opportunity to look at efficacy of 
the test into participants’ old age. We used national 
datasets for ascertainment of cancers, mortality, and 
participation in the BCSP and, as a result, have very little 
loss to follow-up as we could continue to follow 
participants even if they migrated within the UK. The 
BCSP provided data, which allowed us to investigate 
contamination with gFOBT screening and to examine the 
effect of participation in the programme on outcomes in 
the trial. In 2006, the BCSP began rollout of a programme 
of biennial gFOBT, with rollout complete by 2010. The 
programme ultimately aimed to offer screening to all men 
and women aged between 60 years and 74 years registered 
with a general practitioner. Because the BCSP roll-out was 
staggered by geographical area and age, a proportion of 
the UKFSST cohort was over age by the time they came 
under coverage. As a result, less than a third of the 
UKFSST cohort had gFOBT screening, with a similar rate 
of participation in the control group and the intervention 
group and less than 1·5% ever testing positive. Moreover, 
we found very little difference in the effect of flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence or mortality 
with and without gFOBT screening (appendix p 5).
One limitation of the trial is that the cohort was selected 
based on their interest in attending screening. The 
uptake rate was therefore higher than would be expected 
in a population-based programme. However, the 
incidence of colorectal cancer in the English participants 
in our control group in the first 10 years of follow-up (ie, 
before roll-out of the BCSP) was no different to that 
expected in the general population (standardised 
incidence ratio of 1·02 [95% CI 0·97–1·09])14 suggesting 
that our trial cohort is representative in terms of risk of 
colorectal cancer. Finally, improvements have been made 
in endoscopy standards over the past decade, so the 
benefit of flexible sigmoidoscopy in the future could be 
even greater than we estimate from our data.
We will continue to follow-up the trial cohort enabling 
us to monitor the long-term effects of flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screening on colorectal cancer incidence 
and mortality, and to further examine the longevity of 
effect. In conclusion, our results show that a single 
flexible sigmoidoscopy examination in people aged 
between 55 years and 64 years confers a substantial 
protection from colorectal cancer diagnosis and death 
lasting at least 17 years.
