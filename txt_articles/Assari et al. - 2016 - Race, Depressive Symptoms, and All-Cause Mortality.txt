Purpose: Despite the well-established association between baseline depressive symp-
toms and risk of all cause-mortality, limited information exists on racial differences in the 
residual effects of baseline depressive symptoms above and beyond socioeconomic
status (SES) and physical health on this link. The current study compared Blacks and 
Whites for the residual effects of depressive symptoms over SES and health on risk of 
long-term all-cause mortality in the U.S.
Methods: Data were obtained from the Americans’ Changing Lives Study, a nationally
representative longitudinal cohort of U.S. adults with up to 25 years of follow-up. The study 
followed 3,361 Blacks and Whites for all-cause mortality between 1986 and 2011. The
main predictor of interest was baseline depressive symptoms measured at 1986 using an 
11-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Covariates included baseline 
demographics (age and gender), SES (education and income), and health [chronic medical 
conditions (CMCs), self-rated health (SRH), and body mass index (BMI)] measured at 1986. 
Race (Black versus White) was the focal moderator. We ran a series of Cox proportional 
hazard models in the pooled sample and also stratified by race.
results: In the pooled sample, higher depressive symptoms at baseline were asso-
ciated with higher risk of all-cause mortality except when the CMC, SRH, and BMI
were added to the model. In this later model, race interacted with baseline depressive 
symptoms, suggesting a larger effect of depressive symptoms on mortality among
Whites compared to Blacks. Among Whites, depressive symptoms were associated
with increased risk of mortality, after controlling for SES but not after controlling for health 
(CMC, SRH, and BMI). Among Blacks, depressive symptoms were not associated with 
mortality before health was introduced to the model. After controlling for health, baseline 
depressive symptoms showed an inverse association with all-cause mortality among
Blacks. Although the effect of baseline depressive symptoms on mortality disappeared 
after controlling for health among Whites, SRH did not interfere (confound) with the effect 
of depressive symptoms on mortality among Blacks.
conclusion: The effect of depressive symptoms on increased risk of all-cause mortality, 
which existed among Whites, could not be found for Blacks. In addition, race may modify 
the roles that SES and health play regarding the link between depressive symptoms and 
mortality over a long period of time.

Race, Depressive Symptoms, and Mortality
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org
inTrODUcTiOn
A considerable body of literature has shown that baseline depres-
sion and depressive symptoms predict increased risk of subse-
quent mortality due to all- or specific-causes (1–6). Growing 
evidence suggests that psychosocial and medical correlates of 
depression depend on race and ethnicity (7–16). Similar to racial 
differences in the predictive role of depressive symptoms on 
long-term mortality (17–21), Blacks and Whites may also differ 
in the role of baseline depressive symptoms on mortality. In 2015, 
a study by Assari and Burgard showed that the predictive role of 
depressive symptoms on renal disease mortality may be limited 
to Whites and was not found among Blacks (6).
There is a need to study the residual effect of depression or 
depressive symptoms above and beyond demographics, socio-
economic status (SES), and overall and health indicators such 
as self-rated health (SRH), chronic medical conditions (CMCs), 
and body mass index (BMI) (1, 2). As CMC (6, 9, 22–25), SRH 
 
(7, 17, 26–28), and BMI (8, 29–34) are all correlated with depres-
sion and mortality (6, 9), these health variables potentially 
confound, mediate, or suppress the predictive role of baseline 
depressive symptoms on risk of subsequent mortality. However, 
very few studies have specifically investigated how depressive 
symptoms operate in conjunction with SES and health status in 
predicting the long-term risk of mortality.
Race and ethnicity alter the complex associations between 
SES, depression, and health (7, 8, 17, 26–28, 32–36). Previous 
research has shown that race and ethnicity alter the pattern of 
depression and SRH (10) as well as the comorbidity between 
depression and obesity (7, 8, 32, 33), and depression and CMC 
(11, 12). Race and ethnicity may also modify the residual effects 
of SES over health on mortality (18, 20, 28). The race-specific 
role of depressive symptoms and SRH may be a consequence of 
racial differences in joint distribution of the risk and protective 
factors, racial differences in patterns of associations between 
demographics, SES, physical health, and mental health, or 
race and ethnic differences in vulnerabilities to the effect of 
risk and protective factors (6, 17–19). In addition, contextual 
factors such as race and ethnicity shape the additive effects of 
SES, depression, and physical health (9, 14, 32, 37–39) even 
when their separate effects are similar (10, 32, 36, 39). Finally, 
some of the health indicators may not reflect the same aspects 
of health across populations (17, 36). Thus, Blacks and Whites 
may differ in mediating, confounding, or suppressor effects of 
SES and health (e.g., CMC, SRH, and BMI) on the depressive 
symptoms – mortality link.
We conducted this study to compare Blacks and Whites for 
effects of depressive symptoms over SES and health (e.g., CMC, 
SRH, and BMI) in predicting long-term risk of all-cause mortality 
in a nationally representative cohort of American adults.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Design and setting
Data were obtained from Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) 
study (29). The ACL is a nationally representative longitudinal 
cohort of U.S. adults, who are 25 years or older, followed from 
1986 to 2011. More detailed methodology of the study has been 
previously described (40, 41).
sampling and Participants
Stratified multistage probability sampling was applied in the ACL 
study. At baseline, the study population consisted of 3,617 adults 
older than 24 years old. Non-institutionalized continental U.S. 
residents were included in the study. Wave 1 represented 70% 
of sampled households and 68% of sampled individuals. Blacks 
and older adults (age >60 years) were oversampled in ACL. We 
focused on Whites and Blacks in our analysis (total N = 3,361, 
Whites = 2,205, and Blacks = 1,156).
Process and Measures
Face-to-face interviews were used to collect baseline data at wave 1.
Mortality
The death certificates or the National Death Index (NDI) was 
used to extract the all-cause mortality data, including the date of 
death and the cause of death. Death certificates are filled out by 
physicians after a person’s death in the U.S., and it is used as the 
source of the NDI. (6, 17)
Depressive Symptoms
We used the 11-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-
Depression scale (CES-D) (41, 42). In this shortened version of 
the CES-D, a score of 1–3 is given to each item. We used the mean 
item score as the total score, ranging from 1 to 3. The abbreviated 
CES-D has been used in other studies and has shown acceptable 
reliability and validity (43–45). A cut point (17.84) of mean + SD 
(14.03 + 3.81) was used to determine the high depressive symp-
toms at baseline.
Chronic Medical Condition
Participants were asked whether they had been informed by a 
health care provider about having any of the seven focal condi-
tions of interest, including hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung 
disease, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and arthritis. Answers to 
each condition were scored as 0 or 1, resulting in a scale of 0–7 
for total CMC (9, 41).
Self-rated Health
Self-rated health was a single-item scale on subjective overall 
health, with five categories: poor, fair, good, very good, and 
excellent. SRH was treated as a dichotomous measure, where 
the original five categories were collapsed to the poor/fair versus 
good/very good/excellent categories. SRH has shown acceptable 
test–retest reliability and validity (26, 45–49).
Demographic Factors
Data were collected at baseline on gender (male considered the 
reference category) and age (in years).
Socioeconomic Status
Data were collected at baseline on education (years of schooling) 
and household income (in continuous scale).

Race
Participant’s race was based on self-reported race and ethnicity, 
collected at baseline in 1986 with several survey items. Participants 
responded open-endedly to the question, “In addition to being 
American, what do you think of as your ethnic background or 
origins?” Respondents were then asked a multiple-choice ques-
tion, “
Are you white, black, American Indian, Asian, or another 
race?” and allowed to answer with multiple categories. This 
analysis only included non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic 
Black respondents. All Hispanic individuals were dropped from 
the analysis.
ethics
Informed consent was obtained from all participants of the ACL 
study. Our study was approved by the University of Michigan 
institutional review board in accordance with The Code of Ethics 
of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki, 
Edinburgh 2000 revision).
statistical analysis
Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used to 
account for the complex sample design of the ACL study by 
applying sampling and non-response weights. Taylor series 
linearization was applied for the estimation of standard errors 
in a subsample analysis framework. Hazard ratios (95% confi-
dence interval) were reported. A P-value <0.05 was considered 
significant.
The only main predictor of interest was baseline depressive 
symptoms measured at 1986. Covariates included baseline SES 
(education and income), SRH, CMC, and BMI all measured at 
1986. Outcome was time to all-cause mortality from 1986 to 
2011. Time to all-cause mortality was calculated in months as the 
timeframe between baseline and death. Time to censoring was 
calculated in months as the timeframe between baseline and loss 
to follow-up or baseline and 2011.
A series of Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
assess the residual effect of baseline depressive symptoms on all-
cause mortality over demographics, SES, and health. First, we ran 
four models in the pooled sample. Model 1 only included high 
depressive symptoms at baseline (CES-D > mean) and demo-
graphic variables. Model 3 was the full model as it controlled for 
CMC, SRH, and BMI as well as other variables. Model 4 included 
the interaction term between race and high depressive symptoms 
(CES-D > mean) at baseline. In the next step, we ran four models 
for Whites and four models for Blacks in a step-by-step fashion. 
Model 1 only included depressive symptoms and demograph-
ics. Model 2 included socioeconomic variables as well. Model 4 
accounted for all the variables.
We used estat concordance command in Stata to calculate the 
C statistics for our Cox regression models in the pooled sample 
based on race. Harrell’s C [(E + T/2)/P] was 0.82, 0.84, and 0.79 
in the pooled sample, Whites, and Blacks, respectively. Somers’ D 
statistics were 0.64, 0.67, and 0.59 for the pooled sample, Whites, 
and Blacks, respectively. Thus, performance of the model was 
only slightly lower among Blacks compared to Whites. Despite 
reporting C statistics, we did not aim to measure overall adequacy 
of our models, as we did not aim to find risk prediction models. 
Instead, our aim was to test one association of interest among 
Blacks and Whites (50–53).
resUlTs
The total number of deceased and surviving individuals, includ-
ing both Blacks and Whites, were 1,737 and 1,624, respectively, 
at the time of our study. Table 1 represents detailed descriptive 
statistics on all variables included in our study. Whites and Blacks 
did not differ in age and gender. However, compared to Whites, 
Blacks had significantly lower SES (education and income), 
higher depressive symptoms, and poorer health (CMC, BMI, and 
SRH) at baseline.
Table 2 presents the results of five Cox proportional hazards 
models for the pooled sample. High CES-D score at baseline 
was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in Model 1 
(HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.23–1.83). Similar findings were found 
in Model 2 (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.07–1.60). In Model 3, higher 
CES-D at baseline did not predict all-cause mortality (HR = 1.12, 
95% CI = 0.91–1.37). In the last model, we found an interaction 
between race and baseline depressive symptoms on all-cause 
mortality (HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.19–2.31), suggesting a stronger 
effect of baseline depressive symptoms on long-term risk of all-
cause mortality among Whites compared to Blacks.
Table 3 presents the results of Cox proportional hazards 
models specific to race groups. Among Whites, in Models 1 
and 2, baseline CES-D was a predictor of all-cause mortality. 
In Model 3, baseline CES-D did not remain as a predictor of 
all-cause mortality. Among Blacks, in Model 1, there was no 
significant association between high depressive symptoms 
at baseline and risk of all-cause mortality. In Model 2, the 
association between high depressive symptoms at baseline and 
mortality became marginally significant. In Model 3, higher 
CES-D at baseline was associated with a lower risk of subse-
quent mortality after controlling for all covariates, including 
CMC, BMI, and SRH.
DiscUssiOn
The current study had three main findings: first, race and baseline 
depressive symptoms interacted on  all-cause mortality, suggest-
ing a stronger effect for Whites compared to Blacks. Second, the 
stronger effect of baseline depressive symptoms on subsequent 
risk of all-cause mortality among Whites was not due to racial 
disparities in SES or health (i.e., CMC, SRH, and BMI). Third, 
health has different roles on the link between baseline depressive 
symptoms and long-term risk of all-cause mortality among Whites 
and Blacks. Although CMC suppresses the effects of depressive 
symptoms on mortality among Blacks, SRH explains (confounds) 
the same link among Whites.
Our first findings on the stronger predictive role of baseline 
depressive symptoms on all-cause mortality for Whites compared 
to Blacks are in line with a growing body of evidence, suggesting 
that depressive symptoms, SRH, and hostility may have a weaker

predictive role for long-term mortality of Blacks compared to 
Whites (6, 18–21). The same findings have been shown for dif-
ferent predictors, different populations, and different causes of 
mortality (18–21). We still do not know whether these racial 
differences in the predictive role of baseline characteristics on 
long-term risk of mortality are due to different validity or meas-
urement errors of predictors at baseline or the unpredictability 
or competing risks of long-term mortality among Blacks. There 
is also some evidence suggesting that race and ethnicity may 
interfere with the exact meaning of health/reflection of SRH and 
depressive symptoms and other health indicators (9, 17).
A recent study found that baseline depressive symptoms 
predict subsequent risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) 
15 years later among Whites but not Blacks, suggesting a weaker 
effect of depressive symptoms on subsequent all-cause mortal-
ity among Blacks (54). This finding is also supported by the 
Black–White paradox, defined as less frequent depression despite 
higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions among Blacks 
compared to Whites in the U.S. (10, 11). Based on this paradox, 
we expect weaker correlations between depression and physical 
health (e.g., mortality) among Blacks than Whites (9, 15).
The unexpected protective residual effect of depressive symp-
toms on all-cause mortality over SES and health for Blacks is not 
easy to explain. Nesse has discussed an evolutionary explanatory 
model of depression. In this model, depression and lack of moti-
vation may be a healthy reaction and may increase an organism’s 
ability to cope with the adaptive challenges characteristic of 
unpropitious situations (55). Some benefits of depression may 
be secondary to the role of depression such as communicating 
a need for help, signaling yielding in a hierarchy conflict, or 
fostering disengagement for commitments to unreachable goals 
(56). In this view, depression may promote escape and avoidance

Race, Depressive Symptoms, and Mortality
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org
of discriminatory and racist situations in a life full of economic 
and other structural barriers (55). As Beck argued, depression 
may have an adaptive role in conserving resources in a resource-
limited environment (57). Depression may be a communication 
tool designed to manipulate others into providing emotional 
and tangible support and resources (58, 59). As Lewis suggested, 
depression in adults is a plea for help from their close social 
network (60). Wolpert suggested that not clinical depression but 
subclinical levels are adaptive (61).
Our study showed suppressor effects of health status on the 
association between depressive symptoms and mortality among 
Blacks, which means controlling for CMC, BMI, and SRH is 
required if we want to study variability of mortality in Blacks due 
to depressive symptoms. Results suggest that researchers should 
decompose variance of mortality of Blacks attributable to health-
related variables (i.e., CMC) from what might be explained by 
depressive symptoms (46). Other examples of suppressor effects 
exist in the literature (10, 47). However, in Whites the mortality 
risk associated with depressive symptoms was explained by health 
status.
Race and ethnicity alter the additive effects of depression/
depressive symptoms and CMC on mortality (6, 9, 13, 14). 
Literature has shown some mixed results considering Black–
White differences in the depression – CMC link. The mechanism 
behind lower rates of depression despite higher rates of CMC in 
Blacks compared to Whites remains unexplained (9, 15). Recently, 
a longitudinal study showed that baseline depressive symptoms 
predict an increase in CMC among Whites but not Blacks (9). 
Racial differences in the effects of CMCs (e.g., diabetes) on mor-
tality have also been shown (37). Lower mortality rates of Blacks 
with diabetes compared to Whites with diabetes are very difficult 
to explain, particularly considering lower access of Blacks to 
treatment, SES, and disease management and higher comorbidi-
ties among Blacks who suffer CMC compared to Whites (37).
We found that in the pooled sample and also among Whites 
but not Blacks, CMC and SRH explained the association between 
baseline depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality. Houle 
showed that CMC may mediate the effect of depressive symptoms 
to all-cause mortality (5). Among Blacks, we found that CMC 
may suppress (not mediate) the effect of depressive symptoms on 
all-cause mortality (46). We showed that the role of CMC on the 
abovementioned link may vary based on race; however, Houle 
applied his models in the pooled sample and did not explore 
group differences (5).
We also found that baseline SRH explained (confounding) 
the effect of depressive symptoms on mortality for Whites but 
not Blacks. Although SRH may reflect different aspects of health 
across populations, the SRH-depression link may also vary 
based on race and ethnicity. It is also shown that race modifies 
the relationship between SRH and mortality (17–19, 48, 49, 
62, 63). Although McGee et al. showed that SRH is associated 
with increased risk of mortality for all racial/ethnic groups (48), 
another study showed that SES alters the association between 
SRH and mortality (64).
There have been some studies investigating the predictive role 
of depressive symptoms on subsequent mortality. Houle, Atlantis 
et al., and White et al. showed a mediating effect of CMC on 
CES-D to all-cause mortality (5, 22, 65). However, none of these 
studies explored the role of race as a possible effect modifier. Lewis 
et al. explored the role of race on the link between depressive 
symptoms and specific cause mortality in the Chicago Health and 
Aging Project study (13) and found that CES-D levels predicted

cardiovascular disease mortality and stroke mortality in Blacks 
but not Whites (13). However, Capistrant et al. could not replicate 
findings reported by Lewis et al. using data of the Health and 
Retirement study (14).
Our findings have implications for racial health disparities 
in the U.S., which have existed for several decades, particularly 
a lower life expectancy for Blacks (66–68). The differences in 
depression and the effects of health on mortality in Whites and 
Blacks suggest that SES, CMC, SRH, and depressive symptoms 
may be differently important for life expectancy of Whites and 
Blacks in the U.S., which should be taken into account by the 
health policy makers. Further scrutiny is warranted to determine 
the exact burden of the issue.
As our study is subject to a number of limitations, the results 
should be interpreted with caution. First, we used the baseline 
depressive symptoms, CMC, SRH, and BMI; however, all these 
conditions are dynamic and subject to change over time. Second, 
we did not control for the effect of baseline MDD diagnosed 
by a clinician. Third, we could not control for the use of anti-
depressants by the participants. Fourth, we did not control for 
other potential covariates, including daily activity or access to 
medical care. We also did not check for a potential interaction of 
depressive symptoms with gender and age, considering that older 
adults were oversampled in ACL study and depressive symptoms 
are more prevalent in women than men. Fifth, we used a self-
reported measure of CMC. Although high validity of self-rated 
medical conditions is known (69, 70), future research will benefit 
from using medical record information. Finally, our sample size 
of Blacks with high depressive symptoms was small. Most of 
the mentioned limitations have existed in the previous studies 
investigating depressive symptoms and mortality (5, 13, 14, 22). 
Despite these limitations, according to our knowledge, this is one 
of the first studies to investigate the moderating role of race on 
the residual effect of depressive symptoms on all-cause mortality, 
over SES, and health. One strength of our study is that our results 
are generalizable to the U.S. population because we used 25 year 
follow up data of more than 3,000 Americans representative of the 
U.S. population. Using race stratified models to further explore 
the direction and magnitude of the interaction in the pooled 
sample and using a hierarchical approach for data analysis that 
provides a comprehensive understanding about race differences 
in the associations is also a strength.
Overall, our findings are suggestive of a moderating effect of 
race on residual effects of baseline depressive symptoms over 
SES and health on subsequent risk of all-cause mortality over a 
25-year follow-up period in the U.S. Further research is needed 
to better understand the exact mechanisms behind Black–White 
differences in the complex links between SES, physical health, 
and mental health on all-cause mortality in the U.S.
