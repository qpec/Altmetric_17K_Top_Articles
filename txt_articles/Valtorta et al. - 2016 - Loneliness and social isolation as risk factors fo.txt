ABSTRACT
Background The influence of social relationships on
morbidity is widely accepted, but the size of the risk to
cardiovascular health is unclear.
Objective We undertook a systematic review and
meta-analysis to investigate the association between
loneliness or social isolation and incident coronary heart
disease (CHD) and stroke.
Methods Sixteen electronic databases were
systematically searched for longitudinal studies set in
high-income countries and published up until May 2015.
Two independent reviewers screened studies for inclusion
and extracted data. We assessed quality using a
component approach and pooled data for analysis using
random effects models.
Results Of the 35 925 records retrieved, 23 papers
met inclusion criteria for the narrative review. They
reported data from 16 longitudinal datasets, for a total
of 4628 CHD and 3002 stroke events recorded over
follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 21 years. Reports of
11 CHD studies and 8 stroke studies provided data
suitable for meta-analysis. Poor social relationships were
associated with a 29% increase in risk of incident CHD
(pooled relative risk: 1.29, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.59) and a
32% increase in risk of stroke (pooled relative risk: 1.32,
95% CI 1.04 to 1.68). Subgroup analyses did not
identify any differences by gender.
Conclusions Our findings suggest that deficiencies in
social relationships are associated with an increased risk
of developing CHD and stroke. Future studies are needed
to investigate whether interventions targeting loneliness
and social isolation can help to prevent two of the
leading causes of death and disability in high-income
countries.
Study registration number CRD42014010225.
INTRODUCTION
Adults who have few social contacts (ie, who are
socially isolated) or feel unhappy about their social
relationships (ie, who are lonely) are at increased
risk of premature mortality.1 The influence of social
relationships on mortality is comparable with well-
established risk factors, including physical activity
and obesity.2 Yet, compared with our understanding
of these risk factors, we know much less about the
implications of loneliness and social isolation for
disease aetiology.
Researchers have identified three main pathways
through
which
social
relationships
may
affect
health:
behavioural,
psychological
and
physio-
logical mechanisms.3 4 Health-risk behaviours asso-
ciated with loneliness and social isolation include
physical inactivity and smoking.5 Loneliness is
linked to lower self-esteem and limited use of
active coping methods,6 while social isolation pre-
dicts decline in self-efficacy.7 Feeling lonely or
being socially isolated is associated with defective
immune functioning and higher blood pressure.8 9
This evidence suggests that loneliness and social
isolation may be important risk factors for develop-
ing disease, and that addressing them would benefit
public health and well-being.
The aim of this study was to investigate the size
of the association between deficiencies in social
relationships and incident coronary heart disease
(CHD) or stroke, the two greatest causes of burden
of disease in high-income countries.10 W
e con-
ducted a systematic review to answer the following
primary question: are deficiencies in social relation-
ships associated with developing CHD and stroke
in high-income countries? Our secondary objectives
included investigating whether loneliness or social
isolation was differentially associated with incident
heart disease and stroke, and whether the associ-
ation between social relationships and disease inci-
dence varied according to age, gender, marital
status,
socioeconomic
position,
ethnicity
and
health.
METHODS
This study followed the Centre for Reviews and
Dissemination’s Guidance for undertaking reviews in
healthcare.11 A protocol was registered with the
International
Prospective
Register
of
Systematic
Reviews (registration number: CRD42014010225).12
Study eligibility criteria
To meet inclusion criteria, studies had to investigate
new CHD and/or stroke diagnosis at the individual
level as a function of loneliness and/or social isola-
tion. W
e defined CHD as encompassing the diagno-
ses listed under codes l20–l25 of the 10th revision
of the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10),
and stroke as ICD-10 codes I60–69. W
e excluded
studies where CHD or stroke diagnosis was not the
first
instance
of
diagnosis
among
participants,
except
where
analyses
controlled
for
previous
events. W
e applied no other exclusion criteria

 regarding study population. Measures of social relationships met
inclusion criteria for loneliness if they were consistent with its
definition as a subjective negative feeling associated with some-
one’s perception that their relationships with others are defi-
cient.13 Measures of social isolation had to be consistent with its
definition as a more objective measure of the absence of rela-
tionships, ties or contact with others.14 W
e focused on longitu-
dinal studies in order to investigate the temporal relationships
between loneliness or isolation and subsequent disease. Our
purpose was to clarify the public health challenge posed by defi-
ciencies in social relationships in high-income countries,15 so we
excluded all other settings. W
e applied no language, publication
type or date restrictions to inclusion.
Search strategy and selection criteria
W
e searched 16 electronic databases for published and grey lit-
erature published up until May 2015: MEDLINE, EMBASE,

Excellence (NICE). Thesaurus and free text terms (eg, loneli-
ness, social isolation, social relationships, social support, social
network) were combined with filters for observational study
designs and tailored to each database. The search strategy
included no health terms, as it aimed to capture all disease out-
comes, rather than focus on CHD and stroke. For the full elec-
tronic

supplementary appendix 1.
To complement the electronic search, we screened reference
lists, searched for citations in Scopus (the largest database of
abstracts and citations) and contacted topic experts identified
through the UK Campaign to End Loneliness’ Research Hub.
After removing duplicates, two researchers independently
screened titles and abstracts before assessing full records using a
standardised screening sheet. Additional information was sought
from authors when necessary (3 (60%) responded). When
authors did not reply, we searched for information from related
publications to inform our decision.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted into a standardised form by one researcher,
and checked by a second. Study authors were contacted to
obtain missing data.
Based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
framework and taxonomy of threats to validity and precision,16
we selected the following domains as relevant for assessing
studies: sampling bias, non-response bias, missing data, differen-
tial loss to follow-up, information error with regard to exposure
and outcome measure, detection bias, confounding and study
size. W
e identified age, gender and socioeconomic status as
potential confounders (ie, factors correlated with exposure, pre-
dictive of outcome and not on the causal pathway).17 18 No
studies were excluded due to quality; instead, subgroup and sen-
sitivity analyses were performed, to test the stability of findings
according to internal validity.
Quantitative synthesis
W
e hypothesised that social relationships were associated with
disease incidence, and that this association may differ according
to the dimension of relationships measured, and individual-level
and contextual-level factors. A preliminary synthesis was devel-
oped by grouping study characteristics and results according to
their measure of relationships. The majority of papers reported
relative hazards of new diagnosis, comparing people with higher
versus lower levels of loneliness or social isolation. Since inci-
dence of disease was low (<10%) in the three studies reporting
ORs, these estimates were approximated to relative risks.19
Where the lonely or isolated group was used as the reference,
results were transformed to allow comparison across studies.
Patterns identified in the preliminary synthesis were formally
investigated. Only papers for which an effect estimate and SE or
CI were available (reported in the paper or provided by con-
tacted authors), or could be calculated, contributed to this stage
of the analysis. Where several papers reported results from the
same cohort, we privileged the findings with the longest
follow-up time. If a study included multiple measures of expos-
ure and/or outcome, we selected the result relating to the most
comprehensive measure. Where a study used statistical controls
to calculate an effect size, we extracted data from the most
complex model to minimise risk of confounding. All effect sizes
were transformed to the natural log for analyses. Using Revman

Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, 2014), CHD and
stroke effect estimates were plotted in separate forest plots, and
heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the I2 statistic.
Potential sources of variation were explored with prespecified
subgroup analyses. Since heterogeneity could not be explained
and removed based on these analyses, but we deemed studies
sufficiently similar to warrant aggregation, we combined results
using random effects models. This approach allows for between-
study variation, and is consistent with our assumption that the
effects estimated in the different studies were not identical,
since they investigated different dimensions of social relation-
ships and derived from different populations.
Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed to test whether
our overall results were affected by internal study validity and
small-study effects. Contour-enhanced funnel plots for asym-
metry were drawn using STATA V
.12 (Stata Statistical Software:
Release 12 [program]. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP
,
2011). The limited number and the heterogeneity of studies did
not support the use of tests for funnel plot asymmetry.20
RESULTS
A total of 23 studies based on 16 cohorts were identified for
inclusion in the review, after a two-stage process. See figure 1
for a flow diagram of the study selection process. Eleven studies
on CHD and eight studies on stroke met inclusion criteria for
the quantitative syntheses (ie, studies based on independent
samples reporting data from which the natural log of the esti-
mate and its SE could derived).
Table 1 summarises the descriptive characteristics of the evi-
dence included in our review (see online supplementary appen-
dix 2 for individual study characteristics).
Assessment of loneliness and social isolation
Prevalence of loneliness or social isolation ranged from 2.8%40
to 77.2%.31 Three papers measured loneliness,21 30 42 18 mea-
sured social isolation22–43 and two papers used a measure com-
bining both dimensions.34 35 The three papers on loneliness
used different tools: a direct question asking about loneliness
feelings during the day,30 a question on feelings of loneliness in
the past week42 and a 13-item tool encompassing the perceived
availability, adequacy or accessibility of social relationships.21
Across the 18 studies on social isolation, 11 tools were used: six
studies used the Berkman–Syme Social Network Index,44 two
studies used the 10-item Lubben Social Network Scale45 and
the remainder used nine different tools on the availability and/

 or frequency of contacts. One cohort study used a measure
combining social isolation and loneliness, the 11-item Duke
Social Support Index, which asks about frequency of interaction
and satisfaction with relationships.46
Loneliness and social isolation were predominantly treated as
a categorical variable; two studies analysed them as continuous
variables.29 42 Only one study reported results based on measur-
ing social relationships more than once.42
Ascertainment of CHD and stroke
A total of 4628 CHD and 3002 stroke events were recorded
across the 23 papers. Eighteen studies measured incident CHD
and 10 measured stroke (five studies reported on both out-
comes). Diagnosis was ascertained from medical records, death
certificates or national registers in all but four studies. Others
used self-report,34 35 or telephone interviews with a nurse or
physician.33 T
wo studies verified self-reported events against
medical records.29 36 38 The majority of studies with a measure
of CHD focused on myocardial infarction and/or CHD death
(11/18). Four studies included angina pectoris within their
measure of CHD and two presented results for angina separ-
ately. The remit of the CHD measure was unclear in one
study.43

 criteria). For many of the instruments assessing social relation-
ships, information on reliability and validity was limited (online
supplementary appendix 4 displays detailed information on the
validity and reliability of tools). Four cohorts (six articles) relied
on subjects reporting new diagnosis for all or part of the out-
comes measured, and were judged to be at greater risk of mis-
classification (see online supplementary appendix 2 for details
of outcome assessment). Limited information on attrition and
blinding of outcome assessment meant that susceptibility to dif-
ferential loss to follow-up and detection bias was unclear. W
e
note that the multiplicity of risk factors investigated and the dif-
ferential length of follow-up suggest that outcome assessment is
unlikely to have been influenced by knowledge of baseline infor-
mation on social relationships.
The results reported in 12 papers were at lower risk of confound-
ing, that is, analyses controlled or accounted for age, gender and
socioeconomic status.21 22 27 28 30 33 36 37 39 40 42 43 Four studies
presented results from univariate analyses,31 34 35 41 with a further
study adjusting for age only
.26 The remaining eight reports did not
control for socioeconomic status, although in the case of the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study the relative socioeconomic homogen-
eity of the sample may limit the impact of this omission.22 24
Loneliness, social isolation and CHD
Across 11 studies (3794 events; one study did not report
numbers) based on independent samples, the average relative
risk of new CHD when comparing high versus low loneliness or
social isolation was 1.29 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.59; see figure 3).
W
e found evidence of heterogeneity within this comparison
(I2=66%, χ2=29.16, df=10, p=0.001) and explored whether
this could be explained by social relationship domain (loneliness
vs social isolation), gender, risk of confounding and higher risk
of bias due to exposure measurement error. W
e found no evi-
dence that effects differed according to each subgroup (see
online supplementary appendix 5). W
e were not able to explore
other potential sources of heterogeneity due to limited informa-
tion and study numbers.
Social isolation and stroke
Across nine independent study samples (2577 events; one study
did not report numbers), the average relative risk of stroke inci-
dence was 1.32 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.68; see figure 4). Following
confirmation
of
heterogeneity
(I2=53%,
χ2=17.07,
df=8,
P=0.03) we performed subgroup analyses according to risk of
confounding and risk of bias due to outcome measurement error

 (there were too few studies to perform any other analyses). There
was no evidence of effects differing according to subgroup (see
online supplementary appendix 6); we had insufficient informa-
tion to explore other potential sources of heterogeneity.
Risk of bias across studies
To test whether our findings were sensitive to internal study val-
idity, we compared results with and without studies at greater
risk of bias. W
e found no evidence of a difference in the ratio of
the relative risks for CHD and stroke according to study validity
(see table 2).
Visual assessment of contour-enhanced funnel plots suggested
that studies might be missing in areas of statistical significance
(see figure 5A, B). Comparing fixed-effects and random-effects
estimates, we found the random-effects estimate to be more
beneficial (CHD: relative risk (RR) random-effects: 1.29, 95%
CI 1.04 to 1.59, compared with RR fixed-effects: 1.18, 95% CI
1.06 to 1.31; stroke: RR, random-effects: 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to
1.68, compared with RR fixed-effects: 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to
1.36). This suggests the presence of small-study effects, which
could be due to reporting bias. Although we found no evidence
that study quality and true heterogeneity explained small-study

 effects in our review, these, along with chance, remain possible
explanations.
Additional studies
Seven papers with a measure of social isolation were excluded
from quantitative synthesis since they either did not report data
in a format suitable for pooling and/or shared data with other
studies.23 25–27 29 38 41 Of the four papers that did not duplicate
data from other studies, two reported results based on the
Honolulu Heart Program: social isolation appeared to predict
CHD but not stroke, in analyses adjusted for age, though the
association disappeared in multivariate analysis.26 27 In a uni-
variate analysis of data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities Study (USA) the Lubben Social Network score
was not significantly associated with incident CHD among
people with prehypertension.41 A further study found no
evidence of an association between social isolation and CHD
among men in France and Northern Ireland,29 although we
note that this study controlled for depression, one of the pos-
sible pathways through which social isolation might lead to
disease.
DISCUSSION
Summary of findings and comparison with other work
Our review found that poor social relationships were associated
with a 29% increase in risk of incident CHD and a 32%
increase in risk of stroke. This is the first systematic review to
focus on the prospective association between loneliness or social
isolation and first occurrence of CHD or stroke.
Earlier reviews reported that cardiovascular disease (CVD)
prognosis is worse among people with poorer social relation-
ships.1 2 Narrative reviews on social support and CHD have
described an association with prognosis as well as incidence, but
the strength of evidence was low.47 48 A recent review of seven
papers linked loneliness and social isolation to occurrence of
CHD,49 but the effect on prognosis and incidence could not be
disentangled.
W
e found an association between poor social relationships
and incident CVD comparable in size to other recognised psy-
chosocial risk factors, such as anxiety50 and job strain.51 Our
findings indicate that efforts to reduce the risk of CHD and
stroke could benefit from taking both loneliness and social isola-
tion into account, as we found no evidence to suggest that one
was more strongly related to disease incidence than the other.
This is in line with other research linking subjective and object-
ive isolation to hypertension, a risk factor for both stroke and
CHD.8 9
Strengths and limitations
Our focus on longitudinal studies allowed us to comment on
the direction of the relationship between social relationships
and health, and avoid the problem of reverse causation. Pooling
results from studies of CHD that measured loneliness and isola-
tion allowed us to answer the broader question of whether defi-
ciencies in social relationships are associated with disease
incidence. W
e anticipated and explored heterogeneity where
possible but found no statistical evidence that components of
internal validity were associated with effect estimates.
Subgroup analyses specified a priori showed no difference
between the association of loneliness or social isolation with
CHD incidence, and we found no evidence across studies of dif-
ferences between men and women. W
e found insufficient data
to explore the relative effects of the quantity and quality of rela-
tionships, or study effect modifiers in depth. Seven of the esti-
mates included in our meta-analyses (five CHD, two stroke)
were extracted from studies where participants were of higher
socioeconomic status and in better health than the target

 population. The role of deficiencies in social relationships may
be greater among individuals under stress,52 and our results may
underestimate the health-damaging implications of loneliness
and social isolation among disadvantaged groups. Our review
included some data collected from 1965; more recent strategies
for CHD prevention may have modified the influence of loneli-
ness and social isolation on disease incidence.
In common with other reviews of observational studies, we
cannot infer causality from our findings, nor can we exclude
confounding by unmeasured common causes, or reverse caus-
ation if deficiencies in social relationships are the result of sub-
clinical disease. Publication bias is a concern in every review,
and may lead us to overestimate the ‘true’ effect of poor social
relationships. Conversely, our pooled effects could be a conser-
vative estimate: most of the studies in this review statistically
adjusted for factors that are likely to be on the causal pathway,
such as depression or health-related behaviour.
Implications
The main finding of our review, that isolated individuals are at
increased risk of developing CHD and stroke, supports public
health concerns over the implications of social relationships for
health and well-being. Our work suggests that addressing loneli-
ness and social isolation may have an important role in the pre-
vention
of
two
of
the
leading
causes
of
morbidity
in
high-income countries.
Avariety of interventions directed at loneliness and social isola-
tion have been developed, ranging from group initiatives such as
educational programmes and social activities, to one-to-one
approaches
including
befriending
and
cognitive-behavioural
therapy. These have primarily focused on secondary prevention,
targeting people identified as isolated or lonely, but their effect-
iveness is unclear. Evaluative research is needed to investigate
their impact on a range of health outcomes. Addressing health-
damaging behaviours is also likely to be important, with lonely
and isolated people more likely to smoke and be physically
inactive, for example5 primary prevention strategies, such as pro-
moting social networks or developing resilience, have received
limited attention to date. Risk factors for loneliness and social
isolation such as gender, socioeconomic position, bereavement
and health status are well established14 18 and hold the key to
identifying people who may benefit from intervention.
Our findings suggest that tackling loneliness and isolation
may be a valuable addition to CHD and stroke prevention strat-
egies. Health practitioners have an important role to play in
acknowledging the importance of social relations to their
patients.53 54

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
People with poorer social relationships are at increased risk of
premature death. The implications of social relationships for
disease onset are unclear.
What might this study add?
This systematic review of prospective longitudinal studies found
that deficiencies in social relationships are associated with an
increased risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke
of around 30%. This association is comparable in size to other
recognised psychosocial risk factors, such as anxiety and job
strain.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Efforts to reduce cardiovascular disease incidence need to
consider loneliness and social isolation.
