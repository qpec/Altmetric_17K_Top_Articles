Background: Fish oil supplementation has been shown to delay spontaneous delivery, but the levels and clinical
significance remain uncertain. We examined the association between plasma fatty acids quantified in pregnancy
and subsequent risk of early preterm birth.
Methods: In a case-control design nested in the Danish National Birth Cohort, we identified 376 early preterm
cases (<34 gestational weeks, excluding preeclampsia cases) and 348 random controls. Plasma eicosapentaenoic
acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA% of total fatty acids), were measured twice in pregnancy, at gestation
weeks 9 and 25 (medians). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI's) for associations between EPA+DHA
and early preterm risk were estimated by logistic regression, adjusted for the woman's age, height, pre-preg-
nancy BMI, parity, smoking, and socioeconomic factors. Hypotheses and analytical plan were defined and ar-
chived a priori.
Findings: Analysis using restricted cubic splines of the mean of 1st and 2nd sample measurements showed a
strong and significant non-linear association (p < 0.0001) in which the risk of early preterm birth steeply in-
creased when EPA+DHA concentrations were lower than 2% and flattened out at higher levels. Women in the
lowest quintile (EPA+DHA < 1.6%) had 10.27 times (95% confidence interval 6.80–15.79, p < 0.0001) increased
risk, and women in the second lowest quintile had 2.86 (95% CI 1.79–4.59, p < 0.0001) times increased risk,
when compared to women in the three aggregated highest quintiles (EPA+DHA ≥ 1.8%).
Interpretation: Low plasma concentration of EPA and DHA during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for subsequent
early preterm birth in Danish women.

 Research in Context
Evidence Before This Study
Preterm birth, i.e. birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation, has been
estimated to affect one in nine infants worldwide and is a leading
cause of neonatal and childhood mortality. Although the majority
of preterm births occur in the late preterm period, those born ear-
lier experience disproportionately higher rates of prematurity-re-
lated complications. Despite vast research efforts, the aetiology
of early delivery remains a conundrum. Several meta-analyses of
published RCTs have concluded that intake of long chain n-3 fatty
acids in pregnancy are associated with longer mean gestational
length, a hypothesis which was first published in The Lancet.
Added Value of This Study
This is the first study to examine if a low plasma concentration of
long chain n-3 fatty acids in early and mid-pregnancy is associated
with increased risk of subsequent early preterm birth, i.e. birth
prior to 34 weeks of gestation. This was possible because the
large Danish National Birth Cohort has stored plasma samples
from around 100,000 pregnancies drawn in gestation weeks 9
and 25, and because the diagnosis of early preterm cases occur-
ring in the cohort has been validated and confirmed against hospi-
tal records. In a case-control design nested in the cohort, we
identified 376 early spontaneous preterm cases (<34 gestational
weeks, excluding preeclampsia cases) and 348 random controls.
Concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic
acid (EPA+DHA), expressed as % of total fatty acids, were mea-
sured in both plasma samples for all case and control women.
When taking the average of 1st and 2nd sample measurements,
women in the lowest quintile of the EPA+DHA distribution had
a 10 times (95% confidence interval 6.8 to 16, p < 0.0001) in-
creased risk, and women in the second lowest quintile had a 2.9
(95% CI 1.8 to 4.6, p < 0.0001) times increased risk of early pre-
term birth, when compared to women in the three aggregated
highest quintiles (EPA+DHA > 1.8%). Spline curves showed a
highly significant bending, with a threshold effect at EPA+DHA
concentrations somewhere between 2.0% and 2.5 % and with in-
creases in risk at low levels, which then flattens out at higher
levels. Hypotheses and analytical plan of our study were defined
and archived a priori.
Implications of All Available Evidence
Our findings of a relatively strong association between plasma
concentrations of total EPA and DHA in pregnancy and risk of
early spontaneous preterm birth may suggest that that body levels
of these fatty acids are causally implicated in the physiologic pro-
cesses leading up to premature labour and delivery. These findings
also suggest that plasma measurements of EPA and DHA in preg-
nancy may be used to identify women at risk of early preterm
birth. Because our study was undertaken in Denmark, where rates
of preterm birth are low, population-based studies should be con-
ducted elsewhere to determine if the associations observed can be
replicated in other populations. A further note of caution is that
variation in genes might explain some of the observed association
between EPA+DHA and early preterm risk and research is needed
to understand the relative contributions of dietary versus genetic
factors.
1. Introduction
Preterm birth, defined as birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation, has
been estimated to affect one in nine infants worldwide [1]. It is a
leading cause of neonatal and childhood mortality and surviving chil-
dren may suffer cognitive deficiencies and be at increased risk of car-
dio-metabolic and pulmonary diseases in adult life. Although the
majority of preterm births occur in the late preterm period (34 0/7
to 36 6/7 gestation weeks), those born before 34 weeks of gestation
experience disproportionately higher rates of prematurity-related
complications [2].
Despite vast research efforts, the aetiology of early delivery remains
a conundrum. Observations of high birth weights and long gestations
[3, 4] in the fish eating community of the Faroe Islands led to the hy-
pothesis, published three decades ago in The Lancet [5], that a high in-
take of the long chain n-3 fatty acids in pregnancy can delay timing of
spontaneous delivery. Although not all intervention [6, 7]or observa-
tional [8, 9] studies have supported the hypothesis, at least one observa-
tional [10, 11] and five intervention [12–16] studies have; and several
[17–19] meta-analyses of published RCTs have consistently concluded
that intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids in pregnancy is associated
with a few days longer mean gestational length.
The clinical relevance of this modest effect size has been questioned.
While supplementation trials remain the principal gold standard for ex-
amining such associations, large prospective pregnancy cohorts can
play an important role in answering questions about the relationship
between magnitude of deficiency at different time points in pregnancy
and risk of adverse outcomes, particularly if the outcomes studied are
rare and if bio-samples are available for exposure assessment [20].
One such cohort is the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) [21],
where 101,042 women recruited in their early pregnancies gave blood
samples in the 1st and 2nd trimester, and for whom pregnancy compli-
cations – including the early preterm diagnosis – have been verified by
review of hospital records [22].
Several biomarker studies have been conducted in this field. Two
early studies found gestation length to be associated with the concen-
tration of long chain n-3 fatty acids assessed in erythrocytes sampled
in gestation week 37 [23] or at delivery [24], respectively, and we
know of one study that has related fatty acid concentrations in erythro-
cytes sampled in mid-pregnancy to later risk of preterm birth [25].
However, it seems that no-one has been able to examine the association
between n-3 fatty acids quantified in blood samples obtained in early
and mid-pregnancy and the woman's subsequent risk of early preterm
birth, i.e. birth prior to 34 weeks of gestation.
The objective of the present study was to examine, in the Danish Na-
tional Birth Cohort, if a low plasma concentration of long chain n-3 fatty
acids in early and mid-pregnancy is associated with increased risk of
subsequent early preterm birth. Understanding threshold effects of po-
tential non-linear associations was a particularly important research
priority given that some prior intake studies had suggested the exis-
tence of a ‘saturation’ threshold above which no further effect of intake
seemed achievable [10, 12, 26].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
We conducted a case-control study nested in the Danish National
Birth Cohort (DNBC), a nationwide prospective population-based
study in Denmark [21]. For the majority of enrolled women, recruitment
took place in 1st trimester at the woman's first antenatal visit to her
general practitioner (GP) at which time a blood sample (‘1st sample’
in the present study) was taken for the project; a second blood sample,
‘2nd sample’ was taken for the cohort at a routine GP visit in 2nd trimes-
ter. Approximately one third of all pregnancies during the recruitment
period (1996–2002) were enrolled and women gave consent for long
326
S.F. Olsen et al. / EBioMedicine 35 (2018) 325–333
 term follow up for themselves and their children, resulting in a total of
101,042 pregnancies in 91,661 women. Data for the core DNBC database
were derived from national registry extractions, questionnaires, and
telephone interviews with the women [21]. The present study was ap-
proved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee of Capital Region
of Denmark (H-2-2013-108).
2.2. Study Sample and Identification of Early Preterm Birth
Only singleton pregnancies resulting in a live born child were in-
cluded, and if a woman had multiple pregnancies in the DNBC, only
the first pregnancy was included.
Random controls were drawn from the entire DNBC using a com-
puted random process in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), exclud-
ing those with early preterm birth.
2.3. Exposure Assessment
Blood was collected in EDTA vials that were sent by mail to the na-
tional biobank at Statens Serum Institut, separated into plasma and
buffy coat, and frozen and stored at −30 °C for later analysis. Fatty
acid samples were analyzed in the Nutritional Biomarker Lab at the Har-
vard TH Chan School of Public Health from January through November
2015 and vitamin D samples were analysed at the Statens Serum Institut
(a laboratory certified in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment
Scheme) from July through October 2015. Fatty acids were determined
as previously described by Baylin et al. [27]. At both labs, samples were
processed in a random order and technicians were blinded to the case
status of the samples.
To represent exposure to long chain n-3 fatty acids, we used the ag-
gregated fatty acids, EPA and DHA, expressed as % of total plasma fatty
acids (later referred to as ‘EPA+DHA’). Fatty acids were determined as
previously described by Baylin et al. [27]. Briefly, they were extracted
and trans-methylated with methanol and sulfuric acid as described by
Zock P et al.; Zock P et al., [28, 29]. After esterification the fatty acid
methyl esters were re-dissolved in isooctane and quantitated by gas-liq-
uid chromatography as follows: fused silica capillary cis/trans column
SP2560, 100 m × 250 micrometers internal diameters × 0.20 microme-
ters film (Supelco, Belefonte, PA); splitless injection port at 240 °C; hy-
drogen carrier gas at 1.3 mL/min, constant flow; Hewlett-Packard
Model (now Agilent) GC 6890 FID gas chromatograph with 7673
Autosampler injector (Palo Alto, CA); 1 microliter of sample injected;
temperature program of 90 to 170 °C at 10 °C/min, 170 °C for 5 min,
170 to 175 °C at 5 °C/min, 175 to 185 °C at 2 °C/min, 185 to 190 °C at
1 °C/min, 190 to 210 at 5 °C/min, 210 °C for 5 min, 210 to 250 °C at 5 °
C/min, 250 °C for 10 min. Peak retention times were identified by
injecting known standards of purity above 99% (NuCheck Prep, Elysium,
MN), using Agilent Technologies ChemStation A.08.03 software for
analysis. Sample processing and freezing did not affect the fatty acid
measurements, as determined by comparison of 2 pools of frozen and
fresh samples and short vs. long term freezing. CVs for all the fatty
acids studied were monitored continuously by analysis of a pooled con-
trol sample (indistinguishable from other study samples) run with each
extraction and analysis batch. The mean CVs for EPA and DHA in the 36
pairs of controls were 1.8% and 1.9% respectively. In general, peaks that
are near the sensitivity limit (1 to 10% of the total area) had larger CVs.
Quality control was maintained by external validation through partici-
pation in programs offered by both the American Oil Chemists Society
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
25-OH-vitamin D3 and 25-OH-vitamin D2 in plasma were deter-
mined as previously described [30], using liquid chromatography–tan-
dem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using Perkin Elmer's MSMS vitamin
D kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham MA), and were aggregated (25-OH-vita-
min D) for the purpose of the present analyses.
2.4. Statistical Methods
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP, please see Supplementary
Materials) was prepared prior to conducting the analysis and filed by
Dr. Nils Axelsen, MD, DMSci, Office of Research Integrity, Statens
Serum Institut (email address NA@ssi.dk). The analysis protocol was
strictly adhered to. Logistic regression was used to model early preterm
birth risk, which in a case-control study estimates odds ratios as an ap-
proximation for the relative risks in the whole cohort. Likelihood Ratio
confidence intervals and tests were used throughout. When not stated
otherwise, we used a significance level of 0.05.
For the main analyses we applied a sequential hierarchical testing
procedure specified in the SAP as follows. In brief, we first fitted the
mean of the 1st and 2nd measurements of EPA+DHA with a re-
stricted cubic spline with 5 predefined knots at the 5th, 27.5th,
50th, 72.5th, and 95th percentiles (Test A1 in SAP). If significant,
we proceeded to two Bonferroni corrected tests (significance level
0.025) for alternative descriptions of the data: a test for linearity
(Test A2a), and a test comparing the 1st quintile of EPA+DHA with
a reference group consisting of the 3rd to 5th quintiles (Test A2b).
If the 1st quintile was significantly different from the 3rd to 5th, we
further compared the 2nd quintile to the reference group (Test A3
in SAP). The same procedure was used including only the women
with concordant quintiles of 1st and 2nd EPA+DHA measurements
(Tests B1-B3). The overall effect tests in the spline models with all
women and only those with concordant quintiles, respectively, was
Bonferroni corrected for each other giving a significance level of
0.025. In extra analyses (E2 in SAP), we made the same analyses for
1st and 2nd sample, respectively.
Potential confounders were chosen a priori using a theory based ap-
proach. Maternal age at birth, maternal height, and maternal pre-preg-
nancy BMI were in all analyses modelled as restricted cubic splines with
3 knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, whereas parity, socio-
economic status (SES), cohabitation, residence, and smoking were cate-
gorized as in Table 1. As a sensitivity analysis, we also adjusted for 25-
OH-vitamin plasma concentrations (S2); this was because fish, in addi-
tion to containing EPA and DHA, is also an important dietary source of
vitamin D, and vitamin D could therefore in principle act as a con-
founder for the association between EPA+DHA plasma concentrations
and early preterm risk.
Missing data for confounders was imputed with mode/mean impu-
tation. The full SAP can be shared on request.

3. Results
Gestational age at delivery ranged between 171 and 237 (mean
219.8) days in early preterm cases (n = 376) and between 238 and
307 (mean 280.8) days in controls (n = 348); mean gestational age at
1st blood sampling was 59.7 (SD 17.4) days in cases and 60.1 (SD
16.0) days in controls, and for 2nd sample it was 175.7 (SD 11.8) days
in cases and 177.3 (SD 13.0) days in controls (Supplementary Table
1). Early preterm risk varied with age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, and
daily smoking, and these factors also tended to be associated with EPA
+DHA concentrations in both 1st and 2nd sample (Table 1). In cases,
mean plasma concentration of EPA+DHA was 1.57% (SEM 0.03) in the
1st and 1.41% (SEM 0.03) in the 2nd sample, which was about 25%
lower compared to what was observed among controls where the cor-
responding numbers were 2.06% (SEM 0.04) in the 1st and 1.99%
(SEM 0.04) in the 2nd sample (Supplementary Table 1).

 3.1. Tests of Primary Hypotheses Relating Plasma EPA+DHA to Early Pre-
term Risk (SAP pages 2 and 5 (please see Supplementary Materials))
The primary hypothesis specified using the mean values from 1st
and 2nd sample EPA+DHA measurements in the spline model. There
was a strongly significant association (p < 0.0001), which was non-lin-
ear (p < 0.0001) (Table 2C and Fig. 2). Inspection of the spline curves in-
dicated an inflection point located between EPA+DHA concentrations
of 2.0% and 2.5%, below which early preterm risk increased steeply
and above which curves became flat. Women in the lowest quintile
(Q1) had 10.27 times (95% confidence interval 6.80 to 15.79, p <
0.0001) increased odds of early preterm birth, whereas women in the
second to the lowest quintile (Q2) had 2.86 (95% CI 1.79 to 4.59, p <
0.0001) times increased odds, compared to women in the aggregated
highest three quintiles (Q3 + Q4 + Q5). When limiting the study pop-
ulation to concordant quintiles, being in the lowest quintile at both oc-
casions was associated with 48.3 (95% CI 20.2 to 129.0) times increased
risk of early preterm birth, whereas women in the second to the lowest
quintile (Q2) had a 6.4 (95% CI 2.4; 18.4) times increase risk, compared
to being in one of the highest three quintiles (Table 2D and Fig. 2).

 3.2. Other Results (SAP pages 6–7)
When 1st and 2nd sample were examined separately, similar pat-
terns were seen, with highly significant effects and non-linearity (all
p < 0.0001) (Table 2A and B and Fig. 2). EPA+DHA concentrations mea-
sured in the 2nd sample tended to be more strongly associated with
early preterm risk than those in the 1st sample. Thus, for the 1st sample,
Q1 women had 5.47 (95% CI 3.72 to 8.14) increased odds of early pre-
term birth compared to Q3 + Q4 + Q5 women, whereas Q2 women
had 1.90 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.95) times increased odds of early preterm
birth compared to Q3 + Q4 + Q5 women (Table 2A). For 2nd sample,
Q1 women had 9.61 times (95% CI 6.46 to 14.50) and Q2 women had
2.71 (95% CI 1.72 to 4.29) increased odds of early preterm birth com-
pared to Q3 + Q4 + Q5 women (Table 2B). When 1st and 2nd sample
EPA+DHA values were adjusted for one another by including them in
the same model, the associations of each of the measurements with
early preterm birth were slightly attenuated, but each remained highly
significant (Table 2A and B, right column) Fig. 2.
Adjustments of the a priori elected covariates had in general no im-
pact on the estimated measures of association between EPA+DHA con-
centrations and early preterm risk; this was true for the factors listed in
Table 1 and also (Supplementary Fig. 1) for 25-OH-vitamin D plasma
concentrations measured in the same plasma samples as EPA+DHA.
3.3. Post-hoc Analyses
During the review process we discovered that samples had been
stored at different temperatures during the last 2 years before they
were taken out of the freezers for analysis. However, adjusting for stor-
age temperature did not affect the association markedly. Thus, for the
first sample, after adjustment for freezer temperature, women in the
lowest quintile (Q1) had 5.54 times (95% confidence interval 3.86 to
8.02, p < 0.0001) increased odds of early preterm birth, whereas
women in the second to the lowest quintile (Q2) had 2.05 (95% CI
1.36 to 3.09, p < 0.0006) times increased odds, compared to women in
the aggregated highest three quintiles (Q3 + Q4 + Q5) (the ORs before
these adjustments were made can be seen in Table 2). For the second
sample, the corresponding ORs after temperature adjustment were
also near-identical to the unadjusted (shown in Table 2), i.e. 9.61 (6.42
to 13.7, p < 0.0001) times increased odds in Q1 v. Q3 + Q4 + Q5 and
2.71 (1.78 to 4.20, p < 0.0001) times increased odds in Q2 v. Q3 + Q4
+ Q5. In additional analyses we investigated mean levels according to
storage temperature, see Supplementary Table 2.
During the process we also made adjustments for certain other fatty
acids measured in the plasma samples, several of which were closely
correlated with EPA+DHA (correlation matrix for 2nd samples of con-
trols are shown in Supplementary Table 3 (similar patterns were seen

 for 1st samples, and for cases)). For the first sample, after simultaneous
adjustment for linoleic acid (LA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), arachidonic
acid (AA), the aggregated monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and
the aggregated saturated fatty acids (SFAs), (each of these five variables
were modelled with splines) women in the lowest EPA+DHA quintile
(Q1) had 1.52 times (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.83) increased
odds of early preterm birth, whereas women in the second to the lowest
EPA+DHA quintile (Q2) had 1.09 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.86) times increased
odds, compared to women in the aggregated highest three EPA+DHA
quintiles (Q3 + Q4 + Q5) (the associations for 1st sample, before this
adjustment, were 5.47 (3.72; 8.14) and 1.90 (1.23; 2.95), respectively;
see Table 2). For the second sample, the corresponding ORs after simul-
taneous adjustment for LA, ALA, AA, MUFAs and SFAs, were 4.08 times
(95% confidence interval 2.13 to 7.87) increased odds in EPA+DHA Q1

justment, were 9.61 (6.46; 14.50) and 2.71 (1.72; 4.29), respectively
(Table 2)).
4. Discussion
This is the first study to examine if a low plasma concentration of
long chain n-3 fatty acids in early and mid-pregnancy is associated
with increased risk of subsequent early preterm birth. When taking
the average of 1st and 2nd trimester measurements, women in the low-
est quintile of the EPA+DHA distribution had a 10 times greater risk of
early preterm birth compared to women in the three highest quintiles.
When limiting the study population to only those women who were
consistently classified into the same quintile in both 1st and 2nd trimes-
ter, being in the lowest EPA+DHA quintile at both occasions was asso-
ciated with 48 times increased risk of early preterm birth, compared to
being in one of the highest three quintiles. Spline curves showed a
threshold effect at EPA+DHA concentrations somewhere between
2.0% and 2.5%, with sharp increase in risk at low levels which then flat-
tens rapidly out at higher levels.
Earlier studies exploring the relationship between intake of long
chain n-3 fatty acids and preterm birth have shown inconsistent results.
Several intervention [6, 7] and observational [8, 9] studies have not been
able to detect an association between intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids
on the one hand and timing of delivery or preterm risk on the other,
possibly because these studies were unable to define a group for refer-
ence with zero or very low intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids through-
out. However, the present study is in agreement with our own early
trials [12, 13] and some more recent trials by others [14–16], that
showed beneficial effects on preterm risk or related parameters.
A smaller observational prospective study in Danish women [10, 11],
which used an analytic strategy that was similar to that used here but
with exposure based on dietary instead of biomarker information, is
noteworthy because of its findings' similarity to those of the present
study. Compared to women who in both early and mid-pregnancy con-
sistently reported eating fish at least once a week, women who on both
occasions reported never to consume fish had 19.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 165)
times greater odds of preterm birth (Table 3 in [11]), an effect size com-
parable to those observed in the present study. We know of one other
biomarker study, where erythrocyte fatty acid levels assessed in mid-
pregnancy was related to subsequent risk of preterm birth. This study,
by Klebanoff and colleagues [25], was undertaken within the frame-
work of a clinical trial in high risk women with a history of previous pre-
term birth, who were treated with weekly injections of 17 alpha-
hydroxyprogesterone Caproate, and half of whom were randomized to
receive a supplement with EPA and DHA. The trial could detect no effect
of the supplement on preterm risk. However, after adjustment for
randomization group, women who at baseline belonged to the lowest
quartile of erythrocyte EPA+DHA in mid-pregnancy tended to have
lower risk of subsequent preterm birth, as compared to women in the
upper three quartiles.
Our study had many strengths. It was based on a large national birth
cohort [21] enabling adjustment for many potential confounders in-
cluding smoking, parity, vitamin D status, and BMI. All early preterm
cases were verified by review of the actual clinical records [22]. Our
comprehensive statistical analyses of the relationship between the
EPA+DHA and preterm risk strictly followed a detailed Statistical Anal-
ysis Plan that had been defined a priori. Because many statistical tests
were foreseen, we were careful to prioritize and define a priori a small
core set of primary hypotheses, which all tested highly significant. A po-
tential weakness of the study was its observational design and the po-
tential for unmeasured confounding. However, given the strength of
the observed associations and the prospective design–with exposure
assessment many weeks prior to the studied event–confounding or re-
verse causation would seem unlikely to fully explain away the results.
Our findings may help increase our understanding of the underlying
biology of preterm birth, and how to prevent it and its related complica-
tions. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain an effect of
dietary long chain fatty acids on preterm birth. They may impact the
production of eicosanoids involved in the parturition process [5], the
electrical activity of the myometrium [31, 32], the regulation of oxytocin
signalling [33] and inflammatory pathways by an increase in resolvin R3
production [34]. The strong inverse associations observed between
plasma concentrations of EPA+DHA and subsequent early preterm
birth suggest that body levels of essential fatty acids (or their close cor-
relates) are causally implicated in the physiologic processes leading up
to premature labour and delivery.

 These observations may support the utility of an intervention fo-
cused on changing diet or supplementation based on circulating levels.
Extending pregnancy even by a few days could be of significant clinical
value in foetuses in danger of being delivered prior to 34 weeks [1, 2].
A cautious interpretation of the observations reported here is war-
ranted, however. Firstly, our study was undertaken in Denmark,
wherein the rates of preterm birth are historically very low. How sup-
plementation would work in populations with high rates of co-morbid-
ities with other conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or infection, is a
question that needs to be explored. Population-based observational
studies should also be conducted elsewhere to determine if the ob-
served associations here can be replicated.
Secondly, it is possible that non-dietary factors could, partially or
fully, explain the associations observed; in other words, that the pat-
terns we see might mechanistically be non-dietary in nature. Plasma
concentrations of EPA+DHA at any point during pregnancy is
influenced not only by a woman's intake of fatty acids [20] before and
during pregnancy but also by placental transfer of essential fatty acids
from the mother to the growing foetus, as well as by her own genetically
determined capacity to metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids [35]. A
recent study demonstrated that gestation duration is associated with
fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene variants known to affect polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid metabolism [36]. In principle, it is therefore possible that
variation in FADS genes could underlie the observed association be-
tween EPA+DHA and early preterm risk, and even underlie the ob-
served weakening of this association after adjustment for other fatty
acids if these are also controlled by FADS genes. Research is needed to
understand the relative contributions of dietary versus genetic factors
in influencing the associations between n-3 fatty acid status and risk
of early preterm delivery. Irrespective of which mechanisms may be un-
derlying the associations we observed, plasma measurements of EPA
and DHA in pregnancy may be used to identify women at risk in clinical
Fig. 2. Odds Ratios with 95% CI for early preterm birth given measurements of EPA+DHA modelled as restricted cubic splines with 5 knots. Above the x-axes is shown the density of EPA
+DHA measurements estimated in controls. The graphs (but not the spline fitting) was restricted to EPA+DHA measurements between the 1 to 99 percentiles. P-values are for tests of no
association in the spline model.

 practice. This, together with the suggestion that the observed inverse
relationship between the plasma concentration of EPA+DHA and
early preterm risk is dose-dependent – strongest at low and absent at
high concentrations – may turn out to be the main implications of the
present study.
In conclusion, we found that low plasma concentrations of total EPA
and DHA in pregnancy is a strong risk factor for subsequent early pre-
term birth in Danish women.
