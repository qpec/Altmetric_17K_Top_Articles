The number of arthroplasties being performed increases each year. Patients undergoing an 
arthroplasty are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and appropriate prophylaxis has 
been recommended. However, the optimal protocol and the best agent to minimise VTE 
under these circumstances are not known. Although many agents may be used, there is a 
difference in their efficacy and the risk of bleeding. Thus, the selection of a particular agent 
relies on the balance between the desire to minimise VTE and the attempt to reduce the risk 
of bleeding, with its undesirable, and occasionally fatal, consequences.
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an agent for VTE prophylaxis following arthroplasty. Many 
studies have shown its efficacy in minimising VTE under these circumstances. It is 
inexpensive and well-tolerated, and its use does not require routine blood tests. It is also a 
‘milder’ agent and unlikely to result in haematoma formation, which may increase both the 
risk of infection and the need for further surgery. Aspirin is also unlikely to result in 
persistent wound drainage, which has been shown to be associated with the use of agents 
such as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and other more aggressive agents.
The main objective of this review was to summarise the current evidence relating to the 
efficacy of aspirin as a VTE prophylaxis following arthroplasty, and to address some of the 
common questions about its use. 
There is convincing evidence that, taking all factors into account, aspirin is an effective, 
inexpensive, and safe form of VTE following arthroplasty in patients without a major risk 
factor for VTE, such as previous VTE.

The number of arthroplasties increases each
year.1 Patients undergoing an arthroplasty are
at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
pulmonary embolism (PE).2 In the absence of
prophylaxis, VTE may occur in more than
35% of patients undergoing an arthroplasty.
However, most are asymptomatic.2-6 Because
of the relatively high incidence of VTE, proph-
ylaxis has been recommended after arthro-
plasty.7 The best agents and optimum
protocols to minimise VTE under these cir-
cumstances are not known. The most recently
revised guidelines from the American College
of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and associated
guidance from the American Academy of
Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) offer valuable
recommendations. Both accept mechanical
and chemical prophylaxis.2,8 Although there
are many chemical agents for VTE prophy-
laxis, there is a difference in their efficacy and
the risk of bleeding. The choice of agent there-
fore relies on a balance between the desire to
minimise VTE and the attempt to reduce the
risk of bleeding, with its undesirable and occa-
sionally fatal consequences.9-14
Acetylsalicylic acid, which is generally
known as aspirin, is an agent for the prevention
of VTE following arthroplasty.9,10,15-21 Many
studies have reported its efficacy in minimising
VTE following arthroplasty.9,10,15-36 In recent
years, there has been a dramatic shift, at least in
North America, towards the use of aspirin as
the main modality for VTE prophylaxis follow-
ing arthroplasty.9,12,16,20,27,37-43 A recent poll of
> 1200 attendees of the annual meeting of the
American Association of Hip and Knee Sur-
geons, in 2016, revealed that > 80% use aspirin
as the main prophylaxis in their patients under-
going arthroplasty of the hip or knee.
There are various reasons for the popularity
of aspirin as a prophylactic agent. Besides the
proven efficacy, it is inexpensive and well-
tolerated, and its use does not require routine
blood monitoring.4,7,12,18,21,23,44,45 It is also a
‘milder’ agent that is unlikely to result in hae-
matoma formation, which may require further
surgery, and which increases the risk of

infection.27 Aspirin is also less likely to be associated with
persistent wound drainage, with all its undesirable conse-
quences, than agents such as low-molecular-weight heparin
(LMWH) or other more aggressive agents.4,14,23,46-51 
There are other reasons why there has been a recent
increasing use of aspirin as VTE prophylaxis in North
America. One may relate to the advances in anaesthesia and
surgical techniques that have changed the nature of arthro-
plasty.10,17,20,21,25,32,52 The use of regional anaesthesia, mul-
timodal pain management with less reliance on opioids,
and the effective conservation of blood allows most
patients to walk within hours of their surgery, unlike in the
recent past, when patients would be unable to walk for sev-
eral days after the operation. Many centres around the
world now undertake arthroplasty as an outpatient proce-
dure.26,52-59 The increasing use of pre-operative training
and exercise classes allows faster mobilisation after sur-
gery.60,61 The fact that an arthroplasty is a more routine
and predictable procedure means that patients present ear-
lier for surgery and are therefore more mobile pre-opera-
tively. The reduction in waiting lists for surgery in some
countries has also probably improved the pre-operative fit-
ness of patients and thus facilitated their post-operative
mobilisation.62 Another reason for the move towards aspi-
rin may relate to the economics of arthroplasty. For reasons
of cost containment, healthcare providers may have to bear
the costs of complications and re-admissions, which
encourages strategies that minimise wound-related prob-
lems that may require treatment, including further sur-
gery.63,64 The association between haematoma formation,
persistent wound drainage and periprosthetic infection has
also sensitised the orthopaedic community towards the use
of less aggressive VTE prophylaxes, such as aspirin, that
minimise the risk of these complications.27,47,50,65,66 There
is also an increasing concern about infection with multiply
resistant organisms, which are difficult to manage.67,68 This
problem means that the balance of risk and cost is now rel-
atively more in favour of techniques that reduce infection.
Despite the popularity of aspirin in the United States,
some European countries have refrained from adopting
aspirin as VTE prophylaxis following arthroplasty. Some
European guidelines, such as the Scottish Intercollegiate
Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE), dispute its effi-
cacy.69,70 The committees that guide the formation of
guidelines may receive evidence from experts in haematol-
ogy, internal medicine and other subspecialties, who ques-
tion the efficacy of aspirin as an antithrombotic agent.
These committees work with controlled trial data and
ignore registry data, which provide the evidence of the out-
comes of orthopaedic procedures.
The main objective of this review is to summarise the
current evidence relating to the efficacy of aspirin as VTE
prophylaxis following arthroplasty, and to address some of
the common questions that are asked by orthopaedic sur-
geons and other interested colleagues.
What is the mode of action of aspirin?
Aspirin is an extensively studied antithrombotic agent that
irreversibly inhibits the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)
in platelets.71-74 COX-1 and 2 isoenzymes catalyse the con-
version of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2 and
the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and PGI2.
TXA2 induces vasoconstriction, whereas PGI2 induces
vasodilatation and inhibits the aggregation of platelets.75
Aspirin exerts its activity by inhibiting COX-1, which in
turn inhibits the production of TXA2. Aspirin can prevent
the subendothelial deposition of platelets and the aggrega-
tion of new platelets.76-78
The Virchow triad, consisting of a combination of
endothelial damage, venous stasis and hypercoagulability,
can trigger the development of thrombosis.79 All three com-
ponents are relevant in lower limb arthroplasty. The devel-
opment of a venous thrombus often starts in the region of a
valve where the pattern of blood flow becomes abnormal,
resulting in endothelial dysfunction.72,79 Stagnant blood in
a linear section of the blood vessel leads to hypoxia,80
which in turn initiates thrombogenesis and the aggregation
of platelets.75
Is aspirin effective in the prevention of VTE 
following arthroplasty and other orthopaedic 
procedures?
To our knowledge, a study by Salzman et al81 is the first
report in the English literature that demonstrated the effi-
cacy of aspirin in reducing VTE after total hip arthroplasty
(THA). There have been many subsequent studies further
showing the efficacy and safety of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis
following arthroplasty.9,10,14-16,18-23,25,27-30,32,33,39,41,44,46,51,81-97
One of the most important and commonly cited studies is
the Pulmonary Embolism Prevention (PEP) Trial.15 This
multinational and prospective study, involving more than
24 000 patients, confirmed the efficacy of aspirin in the pre-
vention of VTE for patients undergoing arthroplasty and
for those with a fracture of the hip.15 The use of aspirin
reduced the incidence of PE and DVT post-operatively by at
least a third. The study concluded that “there is now good
evidence for considering aspirin routinely in a wide range of
surgical and medical groups at high risk of VTE”.15 The
publication of many further studies showing the same thing
resulted in the ACCP endorsing aspirin with the highest
grade of recommendation, and for the AAOS to accept
aspirin as prophylaxis for patients undergoing arthro-
plasty.13,18,19,22,23,25,29,31,34,65,98,99
Does aspirin work on the venous circulation (black 
clot) or is its action limited to the arterial 
circulation (red clot)?
The action of aspirin is not limited to the arterial circula-
tion. As mentioned above, it inhibits platelet aggregation,75
an important instigator of venous thrombosis.76,78,100
Besides COX-1 inhibition, several mechanisms of action
have been proposed for the antithrombotic effects of

aspirin in VTE prophylaxis. It suppresses the activation and
aggregation of platelets via non-cyclooxygenase-1 path-
ways.101 It also attenuates the generation of thrombin by
the acetylation of antithrombin III102 and prothrombin,103
decreasing tissue factor expression on monocytes and
macrophages104 and impairing the formation of prothrom-
binase on platelets with reduced activation of factor V.100
Aspirin acetylates fibrinogen and fibrin105 and inhibits the
activation of thrombin-mediated factor XIII,106 resulting in
the formation of looser networks of fibrin with increased
lysability. There is some evidence that platelet activation in
association with neutrophil recruitment is involved in the
initiation and propagation of a DVT.107 Neutrophil extra-
cellular traps (NETs) are produced to allow neutrophils to
trap and disarm microbes in the extracellular environ-
ment.108 They stimulate the formation and deposition of
fibrin which joins NETs in thrombi.109 NETs stimulate
both the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways.110
Aspirin may reduce the phosphorylation of nuclear factor
kappa B111 to impair the formation of NETs.
It has been shown that aspirin reduces the risk of recur-
rent DVTs.112,113 The randomised, multicentre, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Aspirin for the Prevention of
Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism Warfarin and Aspi-
rin (WARFASA) trial showed that in patients with an initial
unprovoked VTE (n = 403) who had completed six to 18
months of treatment with vitamin K antagonists and then
were assigned to aspirin (100 mg/day) for two years, VTE
recurred in 6.6% of those receiving aspirin compared with
11.2% of those receiving a placebo (p = 0.02).112 Many
other studies have further shown the efficacy of aspirin in
minimising VTE following arthroplasty, all recording its
action on the venous (black clot) circulation.9,15,16,18-
20,22,23,25,28,29,31,32,38-41,43,46,84,114
Does aspirin prevent all VTEs or just DVTs?
The efficacy of aspirin in the prevention of VTE includes its
ability to reduce the incidence of both proximal and distal
DVTs, and non-fatal and fatal PEs.6,14,15,18-21,23,28,32,33,35,39-
41,44,84,87,88,90-92,94,95,99,115-118 The PEP trial showed the effi-
cacy of aspirin in preventing PE.15
What dose of aspirin should be given to patients 
undergoing an arthroplasty?
The initial AAOS guidelines on VTE prevention advised the
use of aspirin 325 mg twice daily with a 1C grade for the
recommendation, acknowledging the lack of sufficient studies
on the optimal dose.114 The reason for using this dose is that
325 mgs is the equivalent of five grains, which was the original
dose. A meta-analysis in the cardiology literature showed that
high doses of aspirin (500 to 1500 mg/day) were no more
effective than medium doses (160 to 325 mg/day) or low doses
(75 to 150 mg/day).119 Further studies have also shown that
high doses of aspirin were associated with more gastrointesti-
nal side effects.11,42,43,79,120 Many studies have shown that a
dose of 325 mg twice daily is effective for the prevention of
symptomatic 
VTE.8,10,18-22,25,27,34,44,85-87,89,94,105,117,121-125
There are equally many other studies showing the efficacy of
low dose aspirin in minimising VTE, and a lower incidence of
gastrointestinal bleeding than with the higher doses.15,77,126-
130 The PEP trial evaluated the efficacy of low dose aspirin
(160 mg/day).15 The relevant literature includes studies evalu-
ating a wide range of doses of aspirin as VTE prophylaxis with
doses of 75 mg,13 81 mg,92 100 mg,17,51,98,131 150 mg,41,47,99
160 mg,15,132 162 mg,9,42,43 250 mg,133 300 mg,130 325 mg,95
600 mg,24 650 mg,9,27,42,43 1200 mg,82,84,115,129,130 1300
mg,31,33,35,93,134,135 and 3600 mg.129,130 One unresolved issue
in relation to the dose is the variation in the sensitivity to aspi-
rin among patients.136 There is no routine screening test that
predicts this sensitivity. It has been shown that aspirin at doses
of between 30 mg and 150 mg is sufficient to inhibit platelet
COX-1 function.72,73,77 A recent cross-over study at the Roth-
man Institute43 showed that low dose aspirin (81 mg twice a
day) was as effective as a higher dose (325 mg twice a day),
with the lower dose being associated with fewer gastrointesti-
nal side effects. The recommendation of that study was that
low dose aspirin should be used for the prevention of VTE fol-
lowing arthroplasty.43
How long should aspirin be used for after an 
arthroplasty?
The initial AAOS guidelines on the prevention of VTE,
published in 2007, recommended that aspirin prophylaxis
should continue for six weeks after an arthroplasty.114 The
recent ACCP guidelines, on the other hand, recommended
that aspirin prophylaxis should only be continued for ten to
14 days after arthroplasty, with the recommendation hav-
ing strong evidence (Grade 1B), but also suggesting
extended prophylaxis for 30 to 35 days with weak evidence
(Grade 2C).2 Other protocols advocate using aspirin until
discharge from hospital,31-33,115 or for seven days,133 14
days,17,51,98 21 days,82,135 28 days,9,24,25,34,95,105,121 or six
weeks.16,18,20-22,99
A recent study showed that most symptomatic VTEs
(94%) occur within two weeks of an arthroplasty, with
89% occurring within the first week.137 Based on this study
and the recommendations of the ACACP, it is plausible that
the administration of aspirin for two weeks following an
arthroplasty may usually be sufficient. Since some studies
have shown that the risk of VTE remains higher than the
general population for much longer after an arthroplasty113
and bearing in mind the low toxicity of aspirin, the use of
extended prophylaxis, particularly in high-risk patients
who are less mobile, may also be reasonable. In view of the
complexity of the data on the length of prophylaxis and
variation of a patient’s response to aspirin, further studies
examining the duration of prophylaxis using aspirin, or
other agents, are needed.
Does aspirin have any adverse effects?
It appears that aspirin is safe and causes fewer complications
than other chemical agents available for VTE prophylaxis.
 ASPIRIN AND THE PREVENTION OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM FOLLOWING TOTAL JOINT ARTHROPLASTY
1423
VOL. 99-B, No. 11, NOVEMBER 2017
Based on our institutional experience and evaluation of the lit-
erature, adverse events are rare with the use of aspi-
rin.9,16,20,27,42,43 It can, especially at higher doses, cause
dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux, and an increased risk of
upper gastrointestinal bleeding.11,42,119 Aspirin can induce small
and large bowel pathology (enteropathy); this was not well rec-
ognised previously.9-13 It is not known what percentage of
patients develop these adverse effects but gastrointestinal bleed-
ing, if untreated, can be fatal.42,43 Patients developing adverse
events related to the administration of aspirin, should discon-
tinue its use.42
Any prophylaxis given to patients for the prevention of VTE
carries potential for unintended effects. Many studies have
shown that LMWH increases the risk of minor and major
bleeding and wound-related complications.4,14,23,25,46,48-50
Bloch et al47 recorded that dabigatran caused a significant
increase in leakage from the wound (p < 0.001), an increase
in the length of stay in hospital (p = 0.04) and higher rates
of VTE (p = 0.047) when compared with the use of a mul-
timodal prophylaxis protocol (LMWH inpatient and
extended use of aspirin). Zou at al51 compared oral rivar-
oxaban, LMWH and aspirin to prevent VTE in patients
undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). They found that
rivaroxaban caused significantly greater hidden blood loss
and more wound complications compared with LWMH
and aspirin.51 It is also believed that warfarin, because of its
ability to inhibit proteins C and S, both of which have anti-
coagulant properties, can result in a temporary hypercoag-
ulable state in the immediate post-operative period. In a
study by Raphael et al,20 patients receiving warfarin for
VTE prophylaxis after arthroplasty had a six times higher
incidence of PE compared with those receiving aspirin.
Does aspirin have any unintended beneficial 
effects?
The administration of aspirin as VTE prophylaxis may also
carry some unintended beneficial events. It has recently
been shown that the incidence of mortality after arthro-
plasty is lower in patients using aspirin than in those using
warfarin,9,14,20 LMWH, ximelagatran, fondaparinux, or
rivaroxaban.14,138 Hunt et al139 showed that mechanical
and chemical thromboprophylaxis with heparin with or
without aspirin were associated with a decreased 90-day
mortality in 409 096 patients undergoing primary THA.
They also reported140 that the 45-day mortality with aspi-
rin after TKA was slightly lower than the mortality with
heparin, although this did not reach statistical significance.
The latter is not surprising as myocardial infarction and not
PE is the main cause of mortality following arthroplasty.141
PE is responsible for between 11.7% and 17.1% of 90-day
mortality,138,141,142 while a myocardial infarction is respon-
sible for 25.9%.141 The true cause of death in many
patients who do not have an autopsy remains unknown. It
is likely that some cases recorded as PE occur as a result of
cement or marrow embolisation and are not a true VTE.143
The incidence of cardiac events leading to death following
arthroplasty may be underestimated. In a study by Blom et
al,142 ischaemic heart disease was found to be responsible
for 41.2% of deaths after THA.
The anti-platelet effects of aspirin are well-established
for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.119
Aspirin also reduces cardiac-related peri-operative mortal-
ity.144 Although this unintended benefit of aspirin in
patients undergoing an arthroplasty has received little
attention, one notable study by Parry et al13 reported that
death from all cardiovascular causes decreased from 0.75%
(13 of 1727 patients) to zero after switching from no
prophylaxis to that involving 75 mg aspirin after THA. The
beneficial effect of aspirin relates to its ability to prevent
arterial thrombosis that is the cause of myocardial infarc-
tion and stroke.145-147 It has recently been shown that
major non-cardiac operations are also associated with a
temporarily increased risk of arterial thrombosis, encom-
passing myocardial infarction and stroke.145,146,148-150 A
study based on the Danish national registry, which included
patients undergoing a primary THA or TKA (n = 95 227),
who were matched to controls, showed that the incidence
of myocardial infarction was significantly increased in the
first two weeks after THA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR),
25.5; 95% CI, 17.1 to 37.9) and TKA (adjusted HR, 30.9;
95% CI, 11.1 to 85.5) compared with controls.149
THA or TKA may be complicated by a stroke.148,150
Mortazavi et al150 reported that the incidence of stroke
following arthroplasty was 0.2% (36 of 18 745). Of the 36
strokes, two were haemorrhagic and 34 were ischaemic.
They found that 25% of patients developing a stroke died
within the first post-operative year.150 Although it is rare
following arthroplasty, the consequences of a stroke can be
devastating, particularly in elderly patients.148,150 A recent
systematic review found that aspirin was superior to other
anticoagulants in the prevention of arterial thrombosis
after THA and TKA.151 Future studies with larger samples
may better delineate the role of aspirin in preventing stroke
after arthroplasty.
Aspirin may have another beneficial effect, in that it may
reduce the incidence of heterotopic ossification following
THA.152,153 The anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin may
also contribute to better control of pain and the decreased
use of opioids.26
Is aspirin cost-effective?
Aspirin is inexpensive and reduces the direct and indirect
costs associated with VTE prophylaxis.20,23,27,37,132,154-156
Gutowski at al154 reported that the use of aspirin compared
with warfarin following arthroplasty reduced the costs related
to VTE by shortening the length of hospital stay and lowering
the incidence of PE and of all complications related to VTE
prophylaxis (p < 0.001 for all). They did not take into account
the cost of monitoring treatment with warfarin, which is time-
consuming, invasive, and expensive.4,20,66
Many other studies have shown that the use of aspirin
after arthroplasty results in a shorter hospital stay than
 1424
I. AZBOY, R. BARRACK, A. M. THOMAS, F. S. HADDAD, J. PARVIZI
THE BONE & JOINT JOURNAL
when using other agents.20,23,27,154 There are various rea-
sons for this finding. The use of aspirin does not require
blood tests (like warfarin) that can delay discharge from
hospital until target therapeutic levels are obtained. Aspirin
has anti-inflammatory properties that may aid rehabilita-
tion and the return of function. Keyas et al155 compared the
effect of aspirin and LMWH on the early return of move-
ment of the knee after TKA and found that movement
returned faster in the aspirin group (p < 0.001). The early
return in function reduces the incidence of complications
and the costs associated with rehabilitation. An early dis-
charge from hospital for patients on aspirin may relate to
the lower incidence of wound-related complications 9,20,22
and of further surgery.16
The cost-effectiveness of aspirin versus other agents has
also been studied. Jameson et al157 reported that the annual
cost of VTE prophylaxis with potent anticoagulants in
patients undergoing arthroplasty in the United Kingdom
and Wales was about £13 million, compared with about
£110 000 if aspirin was used. Schousboe et al132 compared
aspirin and LMWH and showed that, using quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs), the use of aspirin was cost-
effective for patients with no history of VTE after THA and
for those who are aged > 80 years after TKA. They were
uncertain about the most cost-effective method of VTE
prophylaxis for those undergoing TKA who are aged < 80
years. A recent cost-effectiveness analysis, comparing the
use of aspirin and warfarin after arthroplasty,156 clearly
showed that aspirin was cost-effective and saved more
QALYs than warfarin in all age groups.156 The realistic
costs of administering potent anticoagulants are even
higher when one takes into account the increased rate of
wound-related problems, haematoma formation, and sub-
sequent deep infection.20,27,50,65
Can aspirin be administered with other nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-II 
inhibitors?
NSAIDs and aspirin are often prescribed together to
address pain and for VTE prophylaxis after arthroplasty.
NSAIDs can be conventional non-selective agents, or COX-
II selective or COX-IV selective. The antiplatelet effect of
aspirin is almost entirely COX-I dependent. Conventional
non-selective NSAIDs and aspirin inhibit the same COX
enzymes, and therefore may interact. Meek et al158 investi-
gated the interaction between aspirin and different selective
(meloxicam and etoricoxib) and non-selective (ibuprofen
and naproxen) NSAIDs on thrombocyic function. Meloxi-
cam and etoricoxib caused no significant change in aspirin’s
thrombocyic inhibition, which, in contrast, was prevented
by ibuprofen and naproxen. Aspirin cannot bind to COX-I
if the binding site is already occupied by a NSAID. The
effect of this is that the administration of non-selective
NSAIDs a few hours before aspirin may impede the
antithrombocyte effect. When NSAIDs bind to COX-I, it is
reversible.159 Hence, the timing of the administration of the
non-selective NSAID and aspirin should be taken into con-
sideration regarding the time interval for their potential for
interaction. Ibuprofen and naproxen reduce the antithrom-
bocytic effect of aspirin when single dosages of NSAID are
administered two hours before aspirin, but not if the same
NSAID is used two hours after aspirin.160,161 On the other
hand, many studies have shown that aspirin can be admin-
istered with selective COX-II inhibitors (celecoxib)26,59 and
COX-III inhibitors (paracetamol)26 without interfering
with its antithrombocytic effect.
Is there a difference between the efficacy, adverse 
events, and cost of the enteric- and
non-enteric- coated formulations?
Aspirin is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms,
which can result in damage to the gastric mucosa by the
suppression of the mucosal synthesis of prostaglandin and
its topical irritant effects on the epithelium.11,72,162,163 Aspi-
rin thus reduces mucosal defences, including epithelial cell
turnover and repair, blood flow, and the secretion of mucus
and bicarbonate.73,79,164 Enteric-coated aspirin is covered
with a combination of cellulose, silicon and other inactive
ingredients. This allows it to dissolve in the duodenum
rather than the stomach.165 Several authors have reported
that enteric-coated aspirin causes significantly less mucosal
damage than uncoated aspirin,162,165,166 with others refut-
ing this claim.17,18 With the conflicting reports in the liter-
ature, it is not currently known whether enteric-coated
aspirin is superior to non-enteric-coated aspirin with regard
to VTE prophylaxis or the incidence of adverse effects. A
recent study showed that the rate of gastrointestinal upset
and nausea in patients receiving 325 mg of aspirin was
higher (9 of 282, 3.2%) than those who received 81 mg
(3 of 361, 0.8%; p = 0.04). However, gastrointestinal
bleeding was 0.7% in the 325 mg group and 1.1% in the 81
mg group (p = 0.70).167 According to the British National
Formulary, the cost of 28 aspirin (75 mg) tablets is 84 pence
and the cost for the same number of enteric-coated tablets
is 87 pence. 
Is the use of aspirin for the prevention of VTE 
accepted by any regulatory body or guidelines?
The fourth and eighth editions of the ACCP evidence-based
clinical practice guidelines, published in 2004 and 2008,
respectively, recommended against the use of aspirin for
VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing arthroplasty.3,5
The guidelines were based mainly on studies that assessed
the efficacy of agents for the prevention of mostly asympto-
matic distal DVT rather than PE. Little evidence about the
efficacy of chemical prophylaxis in reducing all-cause mor-
tality was available. There are few studies that deal with the
use of aspirin for the prevention of early post-operative
DVT.34,168 Studies evaluating the incidence of DVT, includ-
ing asymptomatic DVT, in the early post-operative period
use DVT as a surrogate endpoint for PE. These studies are
mostly conducted by pharmaceutical companies in their

effort to gain regulatory approval for the agents.169 The
previous guidelines have raised concerns among orthopae-
dic surgeons, particularly because they did not consider all-
cause mortality and there was a need to establish a balance
between VTE prophylaxis and post-operative bleeding.
The ACCP guidelines were extensively quoted in the
United Kingdom in a House of Commons Health Select
Committee report on VTE.3,5 The Committee also took evi-
dence from organisations such as charities and individuals
who were not required to declare their interests.170 After
guidance was produced by NICE, which recommended
chemical prophylaxis using LMWHs rather than aspirin,
an all-party Parliamentary Thrombosis Group was estab-
lished to raise awareness of the issue by writing to hospital
trusts on parliamentary notepaper. The parliamentary
group was supported by a consultancy group that was
partly funded by pharmaceutical companies.171 Recently,
the workings of this type of group have been considerably
tightened by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner to
prevent the misuse of Parliamentary logos and insignias.172
In 2007, the AAOS issued a guideline focused on the pre-
vention of symptomatic rather than asymptomatic
VTE.8,114 This recommended aspirin 325 mg twice daily for
six weeks for patients at standard risk of PE and major
bleeding, those with a standard risk of PE and elevated risk
of major bleeding, and those with an elevated risk of PE
and major bleeding groups separately.
In the United Kingdom, NICE produced guidelines in
2010 that were similar to the eighth edition of the ACCP
guidelines. These recommended against the use of aspirin
for VTE prophylaxis.69 Other important orthopaedic
organisations in the United Kingdom, such as the British
Hip Society, accept the use of aspirin for VTE prophy-
laxis.173 Despite the NICE guidelines, some surgeons in the
United Kingdom continue to use aspirin, with many centres
reporting their encouraging experience.13,28,29,41,47,174 In a
similar way to the change in the ACCP guidelines, it may be
that NICE will change its evidence base and endpoints for
the evaluation of the efficacy of aspirin used in this way.
The ninth edition of the ACCP guidelines, published in
2012, used different endpoints for the prevention of all
VTEs, the risk for serious bleeding and mortality related to
VTE and antithrombotic therapy. These strongly recom-
mend (Grade 1B) the use of aspirin as an agent for VTE
prophylaxis.2 The inclusion of experts with relevant finan-
cial conflicts in the previous panels of the ACCP committee
had been criticised.175 Following this, the committee of the
ninth edition made a major change and only approved
members with minimal to no financial conflict of interest.
Of the 150 initial candidates, 13 were rejected because of a
conflict of interest and 18 were included with an agreement
for active management of their conflict of interest that
removed their right to give an opinion on the final recom-
mendations.
The Health and Medicine Division (HMD) of the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medi-
cine (the Academies) in the United States applies a meticu-
lous research process, aimed at providing straightforward
objective answers to difficult questions of national impor-
tance. The HMD was previously the Institute of Medicine
(IOM), which produced eight standards for developing rig-
orous, trustworthy clinical practice guidelines (CPG).176
The CPGs of the AAOS meet all the IOM standards. The
AAOS addresses bias beginning with the selection of CPG
group members. Applicants with financial conflicts of
interest related to the CPG topic cannot participate if the
conflict occurred within one year of the start date of the
CPG’s development or if an immediate family member has,
or has had, a financial conflict. Additionally, all CPG devel-
opment group members sign a form agreeing to remain free
of financial conflicts for one year following the publication
of the CPG.177
NICE also has a requirement that members of guideline
committees declare their interests. Colleges and profes-
sional organisations may be asked to nominate individuals
to give evidence to public bodies but they may not have a
formal process for taking declarations of interest from the
individual. The guidelines for witnesses to Parliamentary
committees do not include a requirement to declare inter-
ests. Committees have the power to require evidence to be
given under oath, but this is rarely used. Witnesses to com-
mittees enjoy absolute privilege in respect of the evidence
that they give, enshrined in Article 9 of the Bill of Rights
1689. They are thus immune from both civil and criminal
proceedings arising from the evidence that they give.178
Should aspirin be given to all patients undergoing 
an arthroplasty as VTE prophylaxis?
The risk for VTE following an arthroplasty is not the same
for all patients. Many risk factors for VTE have been identi-
fied. A few recent studies, including one from the United
Kingdom, recommended that VTE prophylaxis following
arthroplasty should be individualised, based on the risk fac-
tors.41,99,179 A few studies in the United States have also eval-
uated the impact of various risk factors on the incidence of
VTE following arthroplasty and developed an algorithmic
approach.180-183 A recent study using the National Inpatient
Sample data identified 1 721 806 patients undergoing
arthroplasty, among whom 15 775 (0.9%) developed VTE
post-operatively. All known risk factors for VTE were
assessed. Relative weights of all independent predictors of
VTE after arthroplasty were determined. Hypercoagulabil-
ity, metastatic cancer, stroke, sepsis, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease had some of the highest scores. Patients
with any of these conditions had a risk of post-operative
VTE of > 3%. The authors used this model, and developed
an iOS (iPhone operating system, Apple, Inc., Cupertino,
California) application (VTEstimator, MedApp LLC, Wilm-
ington, Delaware) that could be used to assign patients into
low or high risk for VTE after arthroplasty.183 Thus,
although aspirin is an effective agent for VTE prophylaxis,
the use of more potent agents such as LMWH, newly intro-
 1426

THE BONE & JOINT JOURNAL
duced oral agents or warfarin should be considered in
patients at a much higher risk in whom the added risk of
bleeding with the use of potent agents may be justified. It is
possible that individual risk assessment can be improved by
the use of tests such as rotational thromboelastometry, which
may be used either pre-operatively or potentially during sur-
gery to assess individual patients.184 Further studies would
be needed, but this technique might identify some high risk
patients in whom LMWH should be used, other medium risk
patients who should be treated with aspirin and some low
risk patients who do not need prophylaxis. Although there is
currently no evidence that genetic testing for Factor V Leiden
and genetic variants of prothrombin is beneficial,185 the
future development of genetic testing remains a possibility.
Taking all factors into account, there is convincing evi-
dence that aspirin is one of the most effective, inexpensive
and safest methods for VTE prophylaxis following arthro-
plasty, including those with a fracture of the hip. The use of
aspirin is associated with a much lower incidence of compli-
cations and carries additional benefits, such as a reduction in
the incidence of myocardial infarction. Although the optimal
dose and length of prophylaxis remains unknown, the evi-
dence is that low dose aspirin (between 70 mg and 100 mg
twice a day) for a few weeks may be sufficient for most
patients. VTE prophylaxis following arthroplasty should be
individualised, perhaps using decision-making tools such as
algorithmic-based iOS apps. Further research is required into
the role of thromboelastometry and the measurement of the
response to treatment using low-dose aspirin. The use of
more potent agents, such as the newly introduced oral agents
and LMWH, which are associated with a higher incidence of
bleeding and wound-related complications, may be justified
in patients at higher risk of VTE. 
Take home message:
- The main objective of this review was to summarise the cur-
rent evidence relating to the efficacy of aspirin as a VTE proph-
ylaxis following total joint arthroplasty, and to address some of the
common questions about its use that are asked by orthopaedic surgeons
and other interested colleagues.
- There is convincing evidence that, taking all factors into account, aspirin
is an effective, inexpensive, and safe form of VTE prophylaxis following
total joint arthroplasty in patients without a major risk factor for VTE, such
as previous VTE.
