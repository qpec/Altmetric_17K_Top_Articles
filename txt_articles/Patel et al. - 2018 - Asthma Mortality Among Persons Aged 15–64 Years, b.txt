Asthma Mortality Among Persons Aged 15–64 Years, by Industry and 
Occupation — United States, 1999–2016
Opal Patel, MPH1,2; Girija Syamlal, MBBS2; John Wood, MS2; Katelynn E. Dodd, MPH2; Jacek M. Mazurek, MD, PhD2
In 2015, an estimated 18.4 million U.S. adults had current 
asthma, and 3,396 adult asthma deaths were reported (1). An 
estimated 11%–21% of asthma deaths might be attributable to 
occupational exposures (2). To describe asthma mortality among 
persons aged 15–64 years,* CDC analyzed multiple cause-of-death 
data† for 1999–2016 and industry and occupation information 
collected from 26 states§ for the years 1999, 2003, 2004, and 2007–
2012. Proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs)¶ for asthma among 
persons aged 15–64 years were calculated. During 1999–2016, a 
total of 14,296 (42.9%) asthma deaths occurred among males and 
19,011 (57.1%) occurred among females. Based on an estimate 
that 11%–21% of asthma deaths might be related to occupational 
exposures, during this 18-year period, 1,573–3,002 asthma deaths 
in males and 2,091–3,992 deaths in females might have resulted 
from occupational exposures. Some of these deaths might have 
been averted by instituting measures to prevent potential workplace 
exposures. The annual age-adjusted asthma death rate** per 1 mil-
lion persons aged 15–64 years declined from 13.59 in 1999 to 9.34 
in 2016 (p<0.001) among females, and from 9.14 (1999) to 7.78 
(2016) (p<0.05) among males. The highest significantly elevated 
asthma PMRs for males were for those in the food, beverage, and 
tobacco products manufacturing industry (1.82) and for females 
were for those in the social assistance industry (1.35) and those in 
community and social services occupations (1.46). Elevated asthma 
mortality among workers in certain industries and occupations 
underscores the importance of optimal asthma management and 
identification and prevention of potential workplace exposures.
National Vital Statistics System’s multiple cause-of-death data 
for 1999–2016 were analyzed to examine asthma mortality among

 ¶ PMR was defined as the observed number of deaths from asthma in a specified 
industry/occupation, divided by the expected number of deaths from asthma. 
The expected number of deaths was the total number of deaths in industry 
or occupation of interest multiplied by a proportion defined as the number 
of asthma deaths in all industries and/or occupations, divided by the total 
number of deaths in all industries/occupations. The asthma PMRs for each 
sex were internally adjusted by 5-year age groups and race.

persons aged 15–64 years. Asthma deaths were identified from 
death certificates using International Classification of Diseases, 
10th Revision underlying cause-of-death codes J45 (asthma) and 
J46 (status asthmaticus). Death rates per 1 million persons aged 
15–64 years by sex, race, ethnicity, and year were age-adjusted 
using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population. Time trends 
were assessed using a first-order autoregressive linear regression 
model to account for the serial correlation. Industry and occupa-
tion information available from 26 states for the years 1999, 2003, 
2004, and 2007–2012†† was coded§§ using the U.S. Census 2000 
Industry and Occupation Classification System. PMRs, adjusted 
by 5-year age groups and race, were generated by industry and 
occupation for males and females. In addition, 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming Poisson distribution of 
the data. Retired, unemployed, and nonpaid workers and those 
with information that was unknown or not reported for industry 
or occupation were excluded from PMR analyses.
During 1999–2016, a total of 33,307 U.S. decedents aged 
15–64 years had asthma or status asthmaticus assigned as the 
underlying cause of death (Table 1) for an overall death rate of 8.89 
per 1 million persons. The highest asthma death rates were among 
adults aged 55–64 years (16.32 per 1 million persons), females 
(9.95 per 1 million persons), persons who were not Hispanic or 
Latino (9.39 per 1 million), and blacks or African Americans 
(25.60 per 1 million persons). The age-adjusted asthma death 
rate per 1 million persons aged 15–64 years decreased 24.6% 
from 11.41 in 1999 to 8.60 in 2016 (p<0.01). The age-adjusted 
asthma death rates among females aged 15–64 years decreased 
from 13.59 per 1 million in 1999 to 9.34 in 2016 (p<0.001), and 
among males decreased from 9.14 (1999) to 7.78 (2016) (p<0.05). 
By state, annualized age-adjusted asthma death rates ranged from 
4.59 per 1 million in Maine to 14.72 in the District of Columbia 
for males and from 6.70 per 1 million in North Dakota to 15.30 
in Mississippi for females (Figure).

Discussion
The annual number of asthma deaths among persons aged 
15–64 years has declined significantly from 1999 through 
2016, most likely reflecting improvements in asthma manage-
ment and effectiveness of prevention efforts (3,4). For example, 
replacing powdered latex gloves with powder-free natural rub-
ber latex or nonlatex gloves reduced latex allergen exposure and 
substantially reduced work-related asthma*** among health 
care workers (4). Differences in asthma mortality by age, sex, 
and race/ethnicity have been previously reported (5). Based on 
an estimate that 11%–21% of asthma deaths might be attribut-
able to occupational exposures (2), an estimated 3,664–6,994 
asthma deaths during 1999–2016 (1,573–3,002 among males 
and 2,091–3,992 among females) might have been job-related, 
and therefore potentially preventable.
Female workers in the health care industry and male work-
ers in the construction industry accounted for the highest 
industry-related numbers of asthma deaths. The PMRs were 
significantly elevated among males in the food, beverage, and 
tobacco products manufacturing, other retail trade, and miscel-
laneous manufacturing industries; and among females in the 
social assistance industry and in the community and social ser-
vices occupations. A higher proportion of females with current 
asthma and a high frequency of exposures associated with work-
related respiratory diseases have been observed in the health 
care and social assistance industries (6,7). National survey data 
indicate that approximately 9.1% (1.3 million) of 13.9 million 
female workers in the health care and social assistance indus-
tries, and 4.2% (394,000) of 9.4 million male workers in the 
construction industry, have current asthma.††† Approximately 
13.4% of health care and social assistance workers, 51.1% of 
construction workers, 31.8% of food manufacturing workers, 
36.1% of beverage and tobacco product manufacturing work-
ers, 40.0% of miscellaneous manufacturing workers, 21.5% of 
retail trade workers, and 3.7% of community and social services 
workers are frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes 
in the workplace (6). Workplace exposures to asthma-causing 
agents,§§§ such as cleaners, disinfectants, antibiotics, natural 
rubber latex among health care workers, and welding fumes 
and isocyanates (e.g., paints) among construction workers¶¶¶ 
have been associated with work-related asthma (8,9). Higher

caused by factors related to work) and work-exacerbated asthma (i.e., 
preexisting or concurrent asthma worsened by factors related to work).

PMRs in certain groups might also be explained in part by 
workers leaving employment in industries and occupations 
with workplace exposures that exacerbate their asthma and 
moving to jobs with fewer workplace exposures (10). Likewise, 
retired, unemployed, and nonpaid workers might have left the 
workforce because of workplace exposures.
Differences in asthma mortality by industry and occupa-
tion underscore the need for identifying workplace exposures, 
early diagnosis, and treatment and management of asthma 
cases, especially among industries and occupations with 
higher mortality. Pharmaceutical treatment of asthma related 
to occupational exposures is similar to that for asthma that 
is not work-related (3). Early identification and elimination 
of exposures is the preferred means of primary prevention to 
reduce asthma related to occupational exposures; however, 
reduction of exposure might be considered when elimination 
of exposures is not possible (4). Establishing an accurate diag-
nosis and recommending appropriate management for workers 
with asthma related to occupational exposures is necessary to 
improve outcomes and could prevent asthma deaths (4).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, asthma and status asthmaticus diagnoses could 
not be validated. It is possible that some decedents were 
misdiagnosed. However, given the potential impact of asthma 
diagnosis and status asthmaticus on patients’ lives, it seems 
likely that asthma would be accurately recorded on death 
certificates. Second, no information was available to assess 
whether workplace exposures triggered asthma attacks that 
led directly to death. Some attacks might have been triggered 
by exposures outside of the work environment. Third, to the 
extent that asthma attacks were triggered by workplace expo-
sures, industry and occupation information reported on death 
certificates might not be the industry and occupation in which 
workplace exposures actually occurred because guidelines for 
reporting industry and occupation on death certificates**** 
instruct recorders to report decedent’s “usual” industry and 
occupation (i.e., “the type of job the individual was engaged in 
for most of his or her working life”). Fourth, no work history 
was available to assess changes in employment. Retired and

 * Decedents who had the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes J45 (asthma) or J46 (status asthmaticus) assigned as the underlying cause of 
death (i.e., the disease or injury that initiated the chain of morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced 
the fatal injury).

death took place.
 § PMR is defined as the observed number of deaths from asthma in a specified industry/occupation, divided by the expected number of deaths from asthma. The 
expected number of deaths is the total number of deaths in industry or occupation of interest multiplied by a proportion defined as the number of asthma deaths 
in all industries or occupations, divided by the total number of deaths in all industries/occupations. The asthma PMRs were internally adjusted by 5-year age groups 
and race. CIs were calculated assuming Poisson distribution of the data.
 ¶ Retired, unemployed, and unpaid (229 males and 687 females) and unknown or not reported (90 males and 78 females) workers in industries, and retired, students, 
volunteers, homemakers and unemployed (233 males and 688 females) and unknown or not reported (78 males and 68 females) occupations were excluded from 
PMR analyses.
 ** Statistically significant elevated PMR
unemployed persons might have left the workforce because 
of severe asthma in relation to work. Finally, information on 
industry and occupation might not be nationally representative 
because only selected states provided information on industry 
and occupation, and only for certain years.
Effective asthma management tools are available from CDC 
at https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/tools_for_control.htm, and 
information on the evaluation and treatment of asthma is 
available from the American Thoracic Society at https://www.
thoracic.org/statements/allergy-asthma.php. Additional guid-
ance for diagnosing work-related asthma is available from the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration at https://
www.osha.gov/SLTC/occupationalasthma/. The elevated 
asthma mortality among workers in certain industries and 
occupations underscores the importance of optimal asthma 
management, and identification and elimination or reduction 
of potential workplace exposures (3,4,9).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2015, a total of 3,396 asthma deaths were reported among 
adults aged ≥18 years in the United States. An estimated 
11%–21% of asthma deaths might be attributable to occupa-
tional exposures. Asthma deaths are preventable with proper 
asthma management and rapid response to asthma attacks.
What is added by this report?
Among U.S. adults aged 15–64 years, 33,307 deaths from 
asthma occurred during 1999–2016, including an estimated 
3,664–6,994 (approximately 204–389 annually) that could be 
attributable to occupational exposures and were therefore 
potentially preventable. The highest asthma death rates were 
among adults aged 55–64 years, females, persons who were not 
Hispanic or Latino, and blacks or African Americans. By industry, 
asthma mortality was significantly elevated among males in 
food, beverage, and tobacco products manufacturing, other 
retail trade, and miscellaneous manufacturing, and among 
females in social assistance. By occupation, asthma mortality 
was significantly elevated among females in community and 
social services.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Elevated asthma mortality among male and female workers in 
certain industries and occupations highlights the importance of 
optimal asthma management, and identification and preven-
tion of workplace exposures.
