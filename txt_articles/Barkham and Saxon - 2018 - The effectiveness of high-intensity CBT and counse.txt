The effectiveness of high-intensity CBT and
counselling alone and following low-
intensity CBT: a reanalysis of the 2nd UK
National Audit of Psychological Therapies
data
Michael Barkham*
and David Saxon
Abstract
Background: A previously published article in this journal reported the service effects from 103 services within the UK
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative and the comparative effectiveness of CBT and Counselling
provision. All patients received High-intensity CBT or High-intensity Counselling, but some also received Low-intensity
CBT before being stepped-up to High intensity treatments. The report did not distinguish between patients who
received low-intensity CBT before being stepped-up. This article clarifies the basis for collapsing low- and high-intensity
interventions by analysing the four treatment conditions separately.
Method: Data from 33,243 patients included in the second round of the National Audit of Psychological Therapies
(NAPT) were re-analysed as four separate conditions: High-intensity CBT only (n = 5975); High-intensity Counselling only
(n = 3003); Low-intensity CBT plus High-intensity CBT (n = 17,620); and Low-intensity CBT plus High-intensity Counselling
(n = 6645). Analyses considered levels of pre-post therapy effect sizes (ESs), reliable improvement (RI) and reliable and
clinically significant improvement (RCSI). Multilevel modelling was used to model predictors of outcome, namely patient
pre-post change on PHQ-9 scores at last therapy session.
Results: Significant differences obtained on various outcome indices but were so small they carried no clinical
significance. Including the four treatment groups in a multilevel model comprising patient intake severity, patient
ethnicity and number of sessions attended showed no significant differences between the four treatment groups.
Comparisons between the two high-intensity interventions only (N = 8978) indicated Counselling showed more
improvement than CBT by 0.3 of a point on PHQ-9 for the mean number of sessions attended. However, this result
was moderated by the number of sessions and for 12 or more sessions, the advantage went to CBT.
Conclusions: This re-analysis showed no evidence of clinically meaningful differences between the four treatment
conditions using standard indices of patient outcomes. However, a differential advantage to high-intensity Counselling
for fewer than average sessions attended and high-intensity CBT for more than average sessions attended has
important service implications. The finding of equivalent outcomes between high-intensity CBT and Counselling for
more severe patients also has important policy implications. Empirically-informed procedures (e.g., predictive
modelling) for assigning patients to interventions need to be considered to improve patient outcomes.

 Recently, this journal reported the outcomes of the 2nd
National Audit of Psychological Therapies [1]. The re-
port focused on the data drawn from services within the
UK government's Improving Access to Psychological
Therapies (IAPT) initiative. IAPT services use a stepped
care model where a majority of patients are initially
treated at step 2 with low-intensity (Li) CBT-based inter-
ventions. Patients with depression who do not respond
are stepped-up to a high-intensity (Hi) step 3 therapy,
predominantly CBT or Counselling. Patients deemed to
be more severe may be stepped-up directly to a step 3
therapy. Hence, for patients who receive a high-intensity
intervention, there are 4 possible options: Low-intensity
CBT + High-intensity
CBT,
(Li-CBT/Hi-CBT),
Low-
intensity
CBT + High-intensity
Counselling
(Li-CBT/
Hi-Counselling), High-intensity CBT only (Hi-CBT), and
High-intensity Counselling only (Hi-Counselling).
The previous report [1] focused on service-level effects
from 103 services and, in order to maximise the power
of treatment comparisons, defined the two therapies ac-
cording to the high-intensity format as all patients re-
ceived this form either immediately or following a
low-intensity CBT intervention. Not reported in the ori-
ginal publication were the percentages of patients receiv-
ing step 2 followed by step 3 therapy, and those
receiving only step 3 (i.e., high-intensity) therapy. For
CBT the percentages were 74.7% for Li-CBT/Hi-CBT
(step 2 and 3) and 25.3% for Hi-CBT (step 3 only); and for
Counselling the percentages were 68.9% for Li-CBT/
Hi-Counselling
(step
2
and
3)
and
31.1%
for
Hi-Counselling (step 3 only). We found no meaningful
differences between the four interventions. However, that
analysis and explication was not included in the original
report.
The primary aim of this report was to present a more
refined analyses comparing CBT and Counselling out-
comes in terms of the four types of treatment episodes
as opposed to collapsing low and high-intensity deliver-
ies of each modality of therapy as in the previous report.
Method
The study sample, 33,243 patients treated at 103 IAPT
sites, was the same as that used in the original article. It
comprised a subsample of the data collected from 220
services as part of the second audit of all NHS-funded
psychological therapy services for adults in primary and
secondary care in England and Wales [2].
As reported above, the majory of patients were initially
allocated to low-intensity CBT. Patients were allocated
to high-intensity therapy through standard routine prac-
tice procedures either directly, based on need, or via step-
ping up from low-intensity CBT. Such decision rules vary
across services but will include availability of a practitioner
regardless of their theoretical orientation, assignment by a
step 2 practitioner in terms of the issues identified by the
patient (e.g., relationship issues being assigned to counsel-
ling and specific problems being assigned to CBT), or pa-
tient stated preferences.
Outcome was change in PHQ-9 [3] scores from the
start of treatment episode to the last treatment session
of the high-intensity therapy. As in the original analysis,
multilevel modelling (MLM) and Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) procedures were used to model the
nested structure of patients within services and to con-
trol other variables. Variable coefficients were consid-
ered significant if they were more than 1.96 times their
standard errors [4, 5]. Further analysis considered levels
of reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI)
for the four treatments conditions [6, 7].
Results
Table 1 presents the four treatment conditions in terms
of the severity of patients at intake and their outcomes,
the number of sessions attended, and effect sizes. There
were small but statistically significant differences be-
tween the four conditions for intake severity in terms of
pre-therapy PHQ-9 score (ANOVA: F (3, 33,239) =
14.38. p < 0.001) and the proportion of clinical patients
at intake assessment (χ2 = 53.31, p < 0.001). Pairwise
comparisons
in
ANOVA
showed
patients
receiving
Hi-Counselling to be less severe than the three other
conditions (all p-values < 0.001), but also that patients
were more severe at the start of Li-CBT/Hi-Counselling
than at the start of Li-CBT/Hi-CBT (p = 0.020).
Pre-post change
Comparing pre-post change on the PHQ-9, controlling
for intake PHQ-9 scores, an ANCOVA indicated a sig-
nificant difference between treatment groups overall (F
(3, 33,238) = 3.43, p = 0.016). In comparing the four
groups, the only significant differences were between
Li-CBT/Hi-CBT and
both
Hi-CBT
(p = 0.032)
and
Hi-Counselling (p = 0.006). However, the differences in
pre-post change in all comparisons were small; 0.20 and
0.34 of a PHQ-9 point respectively. There were no sig-
nificant differences in other comparisons (all p-values
between 0.084 and 0.355). Comparing effect sizes with
95% CIs showed no significant differences between CBT
and Counselling when preceded by Li-CBT, and both
groups had a larger effect than Hi-Counselling, while
Li-CBT/Hi-Counselling also had a larger effect than
Hi-CBT. There was no significant difference between
Hi-CBT and Hi-Counselling.
The RCSI rates also showed significant differences (χ2
= 16.06, p = 0.001). However, the 95% CIs of the rates
overlapped apart from the comparison between Li-CBT/
Hi-CBT and both Hi-Counselling and Hi-CBT, with
Li-CBT/Hi-CBT having a significantly better RCSI rate.

 Change per session
Hi-Counselling had significantly fewer treatment ses-
sions than the other three treatment groups (M-W U: p
< 0.001 in each comparison). Li-CBT/Hi-Counselling
also had fewer sessions than Li-CBT/Hi-CBT (M-W U: p
< 0.001). As a result, the mean patient change per session
was greater for the two groups with a Hi-Counselling
component. The difference in change per session between
the four groups was significant (K-W: p < 0.001), with
pairwise comparisons indicating significant differences be-
tween each Counselling group and both the Li-CBT/
Hi-CBT and the Hi-CBT groups (M-W U: p < 0.001 in all
four comparisons) and a significant difference between
the two CBT groups (M-W U: p = 0.002). However, there
was no significant difference in change per session be-
tween the Li-CBT/Hi-Counselling and the Hi-Counselling
groups (M-W U: p = 0.203).
Comparisons between the four groups
Including the four treatment groups in a multilevel
model (see Additional file 1) that comprised patient in-
take severity, in terms of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, pa-
tient ethnicity and number of sessions attended indicated
no significant differences between the outcomes for
Hi-Counselling (the reference group in the model) com-
pared to the other three treatment groups. However, the
interaction between treatment group and sessions indi-
cated a significant difference between Hi-Counselling and
Hi-CBT in how the number of sessions attended moder-
ated the treatment effect. More sessions generally improved
outcomes, but for each session above the average number
(i.e., > 9 sessions), Hi-CBT improved outcomes by 0.106 of
a point on PHQ-9 more than Hi-Counselling. For each ses-
sion less than average (i.e., < 9 sessions), Hi-Counselling
was more effective by the same amount. A similar result
obtained between Hi-Counselling and Li-CBT/Hi-CBT, al-
though the difference was less (0.075 of a point on PHQ-9
for each session).
High-intensity comparisons
Replicating the multilevel model with only those patients
receiving a high-intensity intervention (N = 8978) indi-
cated that Hi-Counselling was more effective than
Hi-CBT when controlling for intake severity on PHQ-9
and GAD-7, ethnicity, and number of sessions attended.
Overall, Hi-Counselling showed more improvement than
Hi-CBT by 0.3 of a point on PHQ-9 for the average
number of sessions attended (8 sessions in this sample).
However, this was moderated by the number of sessions
attended with each session below average increasing this
difference by 0.1 of a point and each session above aver-
age reducing the difference by the same amount such
that at 12 or more sessions, CBT was more effective.
Comparisons for moderate-severe and severe patients
A greater proportion of Hi-CBT patients were severe at
intake (PHQ-9 > 20), 31.7% compared with 26.7% (χ2 =
28.95,
p < 0.001)
but
the
rates
were
similar
for
moderate-severe patients (PHQ-9: 15–19): 26.9% com-
pared with 26.8% respectively. In terms of outcomes, there
were no significant differences between Hi-CBT and
Hi-Counselling in pre-post change for severe (ANCOVA:
F
(1,
2693) = 0.33,
p = 0.566)
or
moderate-severe
(ANCOVA: F (1, 2409) = 0.103, p = 0.749) patients. Simi-
larly, there were no significant differences between the
treatments in terms of the percentage of severe or
moderate-severe patients obtaining threshold for reliable
improvement and the more stringent RCSI index. For ex-
ample, for severe patients, reliable improvement rates
(with
95%
CIs)
were:
Hi-CBT,
61.4%
(59.2,
63.6);
Hi-Counselling, 61.5% (58.0, 64.9).
Discussion
The findings from this 4-way analysis are consistent with
the earlier reported results in showing broad equivalence in
outcomes between patients who received CBT-based and
Counselling-based interventions. However, Hi-Counselling
was slightly more effective with shorter term treatment
while Hi-CBT was slightly more effective with longer term
treatment. The current results showed that this was the
case whether or not patients had low-intensity CBT prior
to either Hi-CBT or Hi-Counselling. This finding raises
questions about why and how patients are stepped up at
different services and how this stepping up procedure could
be more ‘evidence-based’ and consistent in order to im-
prove outcomes for both step 3 therapies. In this respect,
results from studies applying predictive modelling to out-
comes from comparative trials [8] and IAPT services [9] ap-
pear to be a promising way forward in terms of moving
towards personalised treatments and the possibility of rais-
ing the improvement rates for patients rather than privil-
eging one therapy model over another.
A Li-CBT intervention prior to Hi-Counselling ap-
peared to add little to the outcomes of Counselling
whereas when followed by Hi-CBT, outcomes were im-
proved. However, clinical differences were small between
treatments, amounting to fractions of a single point on
the PHQ-9. Indeed, this was an overall observation from
this 4-way reanalysis, namely that such differences that
did occur were of doubtful clinical significance.
It was a limitation in the dataset that the number of ses-
sions for step 2 and step 3 phases separately were not
known. However, our analysis on a restricted sample of pa-
tients who only received a step 3 high-intensity treatment
indicated that CBT and counselling outcomes did not differ,
a finding consistently reported in the literature [10].
Overall, the findings reported in this article extend
findings from the previous report [1] in showing that
Barkham and Saxon BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:321 
Page 4 of 5
 differences between the four treatments were small and
varied as a function of which index was used. However,
for high-intensity treatments only, Counselling showed a
small advantage over CBT but only for treatment dura-
tions up to 11 sessions. Where treatment duration was
12 sessions or more, CBT showed a small advantage.
Such a result should be of interest to service providers
and commissioners where cost implications are a factor.
It also adds to the previous report in showing that
high-intensity Counselling is equally as effective as CBT
in treating more severe depression. Such a finding chal-
lenges the current NICE guideline for the management
of severe depression in which Hi-Counselling is not
recommended for patients presenting with severe de-
pression [11].
