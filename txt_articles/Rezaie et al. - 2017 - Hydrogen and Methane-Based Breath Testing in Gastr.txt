INTRODUCTION
 
Breath test (BT) is performed to aid in the diagnosis of many 
common gastroenterological conditions including small intes-
tinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS)-like symptoms, carbohydrate maldigestion and dysfunction 
or alterations in oro-cecal transit. Presently in clinical practice, BT 
is being performed with various substrates (e.g., glucose, lactulose, 
fructose, 
sorbitol, 
sucrose 
and 
inulin) 
using 
variable 
doses

OBJECTIVES: 
 
Breath tests (BTs) are important for the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, standardization is lacking regarding indications for 
testing, test methodology and interpretation of results. A consensus meeting of experts was convened 
to develop guidelines for clinicians and research.
 
METHODS: 
 
Pre-meeting survey questions encompassing fi
 ve domains; indications, preparation, performance, 
interpretation of results, and knowledge gaps, were sent to 17 clinician-scientists, and 10 attended 
a live meeting. Using an evidence-based approach, 28 statements were fi
 nalized and voted on 
anonymously by a working group of specialists.
 
RESULTS: 
 
Consensus was reached on 26 statements encompassing all fi
 ve domains. Consensus doses for 
lactulose, glucose, fructose and lactose BT were 10, 75, 25 and 25 
g, respectively. Glucose and 
lactulose BTs remain the least invasive alternatives to diagnose SIBO. BT is useful in the diagnosis of 
carbohydrate maldigestion, methane-associated constipation, and evaluation of bloating/gas but not 
in the assessment of oro-cecal transit. A rise in hydrogen of ≥20 
p.p.m. by 90 
min during glucose or 
lactulose BT for SIBO was considered positive. Methane levels ≥10 
p.p.m. was considered methane-
positive. SIBO should be excluded prior to BT for carbohydrate malabsorption to avoid false positives. 
A rise in hydrogen of ≥20 
p.p.m. from baseline during BT was considered positive for maldigestion.
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
BT is a useful, inexpensive, simple and safe diagnostic test in the evaluation of common 
gastroenterology problems. These consensus statements should help to standardize the indications, 
preparation, performance and interpretation of BT in clinical practice and research.

of established and unestablished indications (e.g., SIBO, orocecal-
transit time assessment and carbohydrate maldigestion) ( 
1 
).
Th
 e number of BTs being ordered by health care professionals 
is rising (including the use of mail order breath tests), but the 
lack of standardization regarding the indications, preparation 
and performance and interpretation of BT has led to consider-
able heterogeneity between diff
 erent centers and practitioners. In 
addition, research gaps are widening due to inter-study variability 
in methodology. A systematic review ( 
2 
) found 13 case-control 
studies ( 
3–15 
) that used breath testing to diagnose SIBO. Detailed 
examination of these studies reveals that they used 13 diff
 erent 
methodologies to conduct the breath test or interpret the results.
 
BT relies on measurement of gases produced in the intestine 
which diff
 use into the systemic circulation and are expired through 
the lungs. Th
 ere are 4 main sources for intestinal gases: swallowed 
air and air mixed with food, chemical reactions in the gut, diff
 u-
sion of gases from the blood stream, and microbial metabolism 
( 
16 
). Healthy subjects have an average of about 100 ml of intestinal 
gas (ranging from 30 to 200 ml), principally composed of hydro-
gen (H 
2 
), carbon dioxide (CO 
2 
) and methane (CH 
4 
), with lesser 
amounts of oxygen (O 
2 
), nitrogen (N 
2 
), hydrogen sulfi
 de (H 
2 
S), 
indole, skatole and ammonia (NH 
3 
) ( 
17 
). Of these, H 
2 and CH 
4 are 
exclusively produced via microbial fermentation in the gut, which 
is the principle behind clinical breath testing ( 
17 
). Gut microbes 
readily digest carbohydrates, resulting in production of these 
gases, which then diff
 use into the abdominal venous circulation 
and are transported to the lungs, where they can be detected in the 
exhaled breath ( 
17 
).
 
To conduct a BT, fasted subject ingests a carbohydrate substrate 
and breath samples are procured for the measurement of H 
2 and 
CH 
4 levels at set intervals over the next several hours. Currently, 
there are two consensus documents available regarding breath 
testing published by the Italian H 
2 
-breath Testing Consensus 
Conference Working Group ( 
1 
) and the German Society of Neu-
rogastromotility ( 
18 
) in 2009 and 2005, respectively. Since then 
the body of evidence, especially in the fi
 eld of the microbiome, 
has evolved exponentially. For instance, these statements do not 
provide guidance on measurement and interpretation of methane 
gas levels, false-positivity of carbohydrate malabsorption testing 
in the setting of SIBO, and the eff
 ects of anti-acids on BT. Th
 ere 
is no North American consensus document, despite more data 
emerging on the utility of BT in the North American population. 
Th
 erefore, a consensus meeting was convened with the goals of 
providing easy-to-follow guidelines for physicians performing BT 
and to lay the foundation for future consensus guidelines, as well 
as identifying gaps of knowledge in breath testing and to direct 
future research initiatives.
 
METHODS
 
Consensus development process
 
Th
 e process for the development of the consensus statements 
is outlined in  
Figure 1 
. Specifi
 c topics for discussion including 
indications for breath testing, the preparation and performance 
of the test, and the interpretation of the results were identifi
 ed 
on the basis of literature reviews. Pre-meeting survey questions 
( 
Supplementary Information S1 online) were designed to fur-
ther delineate the current knowledge gaps in breath testing and 
were sent to the consensus group members. Th
 e survey results 
were collated and summarized prior to the consensus meeting.
 
Selection of the physician-scientists for this meeting were 
based on a number of criteria. First, was to be sure that attendees 
represented those with active and recent research in the area of 
breath testing research. Th
 is involved a literature search to under-
stand those in North America with active publications in the area. 
Many of these included physicians from major academic motility 
programs. Th
 e second was to also have representation from clini-
cian scientists from high volume breath testing referral centers to 
ensure those with a vast experience in the use and interpretation 
of breath tests. Th
 e third was to ensure representation from vari-
ous regions in the US as well as Mexico and Canada. An email 
was sent to those meeting these criteria. A total of 17 clinician 
scientists from North America were invited to participate in the 
survey and attend the consensus meeting, of whom 10 were able 
to attend the meeting in person. Th
 e half day meeting was held on 
16 May 2015 in Washington, DC. At the consensus group meet-
ing, results of the survey and comprehensive literature review 
were presented for discussion among the group members.
 
Distinct topics of discussion included indications, preparation, 
performance, interpretations of results, and future directions in 
breath testing. Based on the results of these discussions, a series of 
draft
  consensus statements was compiled and sent to committee

members for online voting using SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, 
Palo Alto, CA) with revision as necessary. Using a modifi
 ed 
Delphi process ( 
19,20 
), group members anonymously voted on 
their level of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1–3 (dis-
agree, uncertain and agree, respectively). A statement was accepted 
if >70% of participants voted 3 (agree), and it was rejected if >50% 
of participants voted 1 (disagree). If neither of these criteria were 
reached, it was stated that “
a fi
 rm position statement could not be 
reached due to lack of conclusive data”
. Th
 e strength of recommen-
dation for each statement was assigned by the consensus group 
as either strong (“we recommend...”) or weak (“we suggest...”). 
Th
 e strength of each statement was based on resource and cost 
benefi
 t, patients’
 values, risk/benefi
 t balance and quality of evi-
dence. Th
 e quality of evidence for each consensus statement was 
classifi
 ed as high (����), moderate (����), low (����), 
or very low (����) based on Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system ( 
21 
). 
Th
 e manuscript was circulated to all group members for review, 
revisions and approval.

We recommend that physical activity should be limited dur-

.  
 
We suggest that it is not necessary to stop proton pump

With regards to preparation for breath testing, the use of anti-
biotics has been clearly shown to alter the H 
2 and CH 
4 compo-
sition of the exhaled breath ( 
22,23 
) and although no clear data 
exist, a 4-week gap between the cessation of antibiotic therapy 
and performance of the test is generally recommended ( 
1 
). 
While the eff
 ect of antibiotics on hydrogen and methane pro-
duction is well known ( 
24,25 
), the extent of this eff
 ect based on 
bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics is not well 
understood. Th
 is timeline between breath testing and antibiotic 
use may depend on the purpose for which the test is being per-
formed; for example, breath tests may be performed shortly aft
 er 
cessation of antibiotic therapy to confi
 rm eradication.
 
 
Although probiotics have been shown to aff
 ect H 
2 
 levels on 
breath test ( 
26,27 
), a fi
 rm position statement could not be reached 
due to lack of conclusive data on stopping or continuing probiotics 
or prebiotics prior to breath testing.
 
 
Prokinetic drugs such as tegaserod and other laxatives such as 
magnesium compounds can also aff
 ect the composition of the 
breath gases ( 
28 
). Faster transit time caused by promotility drugs 
will lead to an earlier delivery of the substrate to colon and will 
increase the chance of a false positive result. Again, no clear data 
exist, but a 4-week gap between cessation of prokinetics and breath 
testing has previously been recommended ( 
1 
). However, a 4-week 
gap may not be practical in patients with constipation or gastro-
paresis; hence, we propose discontinuing laxatives and promotility 
agents for a week and only if tolerated by patients.
 
A low fasting level of breath H 
2 is essential for interpreting the 
breath test results, as these are directly aff
 ected by consumption 
of fermentable complex carbohydrates ( 
29,30 
). As a result, avoid-
ance of complex carbohydrates and dairy products the evening or 
day before a breath test (meat and rice do not appear to aff
 ect the 
breath test ( 
31 
)) and overnight fasting is also recommended ( 
1 
), 
although the precise duration requires to be determined in future 
studies.
 
Smoking aff
 ects breath test results by increasing exhaled H 
2 and 
CO 
2 
 content of the exhaled breath ( 
32,33 
) and should be avoided 
on the day of the test. Smoking also increases gastric transit time 
( 
34 
). As hyperventilation inversely aff
 ects H 
2 levels ( 
35 
), exces-
sive physical activity should be avoided during the breath test. 
Confl
 icting results exist in the literature in regards to the eff
 ect of 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on breath test results ( 
36,37 
). Stop-
ping PPIs may not lead to more accurate measurements of exhaled

North American Breath Testing Consensus
of glucose and lactulose breath testing in diagnosing SIBO is 
diffi
  cult to achieve, due to the variability between studies in inter-
pretation of small bowel bacterial concentration as the gold stand-
ard test and lack of uniformity in defi
 ning a positive breath test ( 
2 
). 
In fact, such variability was one of the main motivations for the 
current consensus document. In a systematic review, Khoshini 
 
et al. 
 ( 
2 
) found 11 studies that have attempted to validate the accu-
racy of breath testing in diagnosis of SIBO. Th
 e sensitivity of glu-
cose breath testing varied from 20 to 93% and specifi
 city from 30 
to 86%. Th
 e sensitivity of lactulose breath testing ranged from 31 
to 68% and specifi
 city ranged from 44 to 100%. Th
 ere were strik-
ing diff
 erences in methodology in the included studies ( 
2 
). In a 
recent comparative study, duodenal culture was positive in 62/139 
(45%) patients with unexplained gas, bloating and diarrhea and 
negative endoscopy, whereas GBT was positive in 38/139 (27%) 
patients. Th
 e sensitivity and specifi
 city of GBT were 42% and 84%, 
respectively ( 
41 
).
 
A recent retrospective study of subjects undergoing concurrent 
glucose breath testing with scintigraphy concluded that glucose 
breath testing has a high false positive rate due to arrival of the 
scintigraphy in the cecum prior to a rise in hydrogen or methane 
on testing ( 
46 
). Th
 is is similar to conclusions previously published 
pertaining to lactulose breath testing ( 
47 
). However, both of these 
studies rely on the arrival of technetium to the cecum as a deter-
minant of oro-cecal transit—either 5% arrival of technetium in the 
cecum ( 
47 
), or the “head of the labeled bolus” ( 
46 
). If 5% of the 
lactulose or “the head of the bolus” is in the cecum, the rest of the 
medium is still in the small intestine; hence, the rise of breath gases 
is not necessarily due fermentation in the cecum ( 
48 
). Moreover, 
the lag time between colonic fl
 ora exposure to sugar and peak of 
bacterial fermentation was not taken into account in these studies 
( 
48 
), and as such, they do not yet provide a clear answer on the 
validity of these breath tests.
 
Methane gas has been shown to inhibit intestinal transit in dogs 
by 59% ( 
ref. 49 
) and in human subjects CH 
4 
 positivity on breath 
test has been associated with constipation ( 
50–53 
). Patients with 
CH 
4 
-predominant bacterial overgrowth usually present with 
bloating and abdominal distention. However, they are 5 times 
more likely to have constipation as opposed to H 
2 
-predominant 
overgrowth ( 
53 
). Moreover, the severity of constipation directly 
correlated with the methane level ( 
50 
) and the choice of antibiotics 
for the treatment of SIBO diff
 ers between these two groups as the 
predominant methanogen in the human gut,  
Methanobrevibacter 
smithii 
, is resistant to many antibiotics ( 
22,38,54 
).
 
Lactulose and inulin breath testing have been used to assess 
oro-cecal transit time (i.e., gastric emptying time plus small bowel 
transit time). Variable criteria have been used to estimate the tran-
sit time including time to the second peak of hydrogen or rise of 
5–10 p.p.m., and diff
 erent substrates, including a liquid meal con-
taining lactulose, or a solid meal containing fermentable food such 
as baked beans±lactulose ( 
55,56 
). However, lactulose has been 
shown to shorten oro-cecal transit time ( 
57 
), and the test has been 
shown to have poor reproducibility with wide variation among 
healthy subjects ( 
1 
). Inulin is less osmotically active and has been 
proposed as an alternative substrate to lactulose ( 
58 
). Until further 
breath gas levels and recurrence of refl
 ux symptoms may not be 
tolerable to all patients. Currently, stopping anti-acid medications 
prior to breath testing is not necessary.
 
Indications for breath testing
 
 
1 
 
.  
 
Current small bowel culture techniques are  
not satisfactory 
for the assessment of SIBO. 
 
2 
.  
If culture is considered for diagnosis of SIBO, based on the 
current evidence, we suggest the threshold of >10 
3 c.f.u./ml 
for the defi
 nition of SIBO. 
 
 
3 
.  
 
We suggest breath testing in the diagnosis of small intestinal 
bacterial overgrowth. 
 
4 
.  
Until a true gold standard is established, we suggest breath 
testing in assessing the presence of antibiotic-responsive 
microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. 
 
5 
.  
We suggest to evaluate for excessive methane excretion on 
breath test in association with clinical constipation and slow-
ing of gastrointestinal transit. 
 
 
6 
.  
 
We suggest that breath testing should not be used for assess-
ment of orocecal transit time. 
 
7 
.  
We suggest breath testing for the diagnosis of carbohydrate 
maldigestion syndromes. 
 
 
8 
 
.  
 
We suggest breath testing in the assessment of conditions 
associated with bloating. 
 
SIBO is a condition in which the small bowel is colonized by 
excessive numbers of aerobic and anaerobic microbes that are 
normally found in the large intestine ( 
38 
). Aspiration of small 
bowel fl
 uid, followed by culture and bacterial count is consid-
ered to be the current gold standard for diagnosis of SIBO ( 
39 
). 
Unlike breath testing, small bowel aspiration is invasive, time-
consuming and costly. In addition, small bowel aspiration has 
multiple shortcomings. Mid and distal segments of small bowel 
are beyond the reach of regular endoscopes; therefore, proximal 
small bowel aspirates may be falsely negative ( 
40 
). Although 
aseptic techniques for small bowel aspirates have been described 
( 
41 
), contamination with oral and esophageal fl
 ora may lead to 
a signifi
 cant number of false positive results ( 
42 
). Quantitative 
PCR studies have been used to diagnose SIBO with promising 
results ( 
43,44 
); however, such techniques are not readily available 
for clinical practice.
 
Historically, a bacterial concentration ≥10 
5 colony forming units 
(c.f.u.)/ml has been used for identifi
 cation of any infection in the 
small bowel including SIBO. However, this cut-off
  is not well-val-
idated and has been a point of controversy. A systematic review of 
literature on the diagnosis of SIBO observed that healthy controls 
have a bacterial concentration of ≤10 
3 c.f.u./ml while concentra-
tions ≥10 
5 c.f.u. are mostly seen in patients with blind loop syn-
drome such as patients with Billroth II procedure ( 
2 
). Currently 
a bacterial concentration of >10 
3 
 c.f.u./ml is generally considered 
signifi
 cant ( 
41,42,44,45 
).

data is available, use of breath testing to assess oro-cecal transit 
time is not recommended.
 
Breath tests are also used in the diagnosis of a variety of carbo-
hydrate maldigestion syndromes. Th
 e lactose breath test is per-
formed to diagnose lactose maldigestion/intolerance, which may 
result from lactase defi
 ciency. Lactose, which is exclusively found 
in dairy products, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and 
glucose, and the brush border enzyme lactase phlorizin hydrolase 
is required for its digestion. Lactase defi
 ciency can be primary 
or secondary (i.e., acquired lactase defi
 ciency due to damage to, 
or absence, of the brush border). Th
 ere is no gold standard test 
to diagnose lactose maldigestion and large scale data are lack-
ing to compare the degree of agreement of the currently avail-
able tests ( 
59 
). Jejunal biopsies followed by a lactase activity 
assay is invasive and unreliable due to patchy lactase distribution 
in the brush border ( 
60 
). Genetic testing only detects primary 
lactase defi
 ciency ( 
61 
), and tests of blood glucose levels follow-
ing lactose ingestion depend on glucose metabolism and are not 
reliable ( 
61,62 
). One other limitation of the lactose breath test 
is false negative results in individuals with fi
 xed hydrogen and 
non-methane production; however, these only constitute 3.4% of 
breath tests ( 
63 
). As mentioned above, false positive results can 
also occur ( 
64,65 
).
 
Th
 e fructose breath test is performed to diagnose fructose mal-
digestion/intolerance. In fructose intolerant subjects, unabsorbed 
fructose is fermented by the colonic bacteria causing IBS-like 
symptoms ( 
66 
). A well-conducted study has shown that ingest-
ing 25 g of fructose is the appropriate dose for fructose breath 
testing and symptom correlation ( 
67 
). Again, limitations of the 
test include false negatives, which can occur in individuals who 
are fi
 xed hydrogen non-methane producers; and false positives, 
which can occur in individuals with SIBO. Nucera  
et al. ( 
64 
) 
showed that the number of positive fructose breath tests in IBS 
patients with positive lactulose tests dropped from 62 to 3% aft
 er 
1 week of antibiotic treatment ( 
64 
). Further studies are need to 
clarify the role of breath testing in sorbitol ( 
68 
) and fructan ( 
66 
) 
intolerance.
 
IBS-like symptoms are commonly seen in patients with SIBO 
and carbohydrate maldigestion ( 
38,69 
). However, symptom pro-
fi
 les of these patients are non-specifi
 c and clinical history alone 
cannot diff
 erentiate the underlying cause. In assessment of 144 
subjects with IBS-like symptoms, Jacobs  
et al. 
 ( 
42 
) found no dif-
ference in the intensity, frequency and duration of abdominal 
pain, bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea and gas among patients with or without SIBO proven 
by aerobic/anaerobic/fungal small bowel cultures. Meta-analyses 
( 
70,71 
) have documented a wide variety of types of breath tests 
(i.e., diff
 erent substrates) as well as considerable variability in 
the performance and interpretation of these breath tests in IBS 
patients vs. controls, but found that overall, IBS patients were 3 
times more likely (odds ratio=3.3; 95% confi
 dence interval 2.4–
4.6) to have an abnormal breath test than controls. Breath test-
ing remains a useful diagnostic tool for patients with unexplained 
IBS-like symptoms including gas and bloating, as well as diarrhea 
or constipation ( 
70 
).
 
Performance of breath tests
 
1 
.  
We suggest that the correct dose of lactulose for breath test-
ing is 10 g with or followed by one cup of water. 
 
2 
.  
We suggest that the correct dose of glucose for breath testing 
is 75 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water. 
 
3 
.  
We suggest that the correct dose of lactose for breath testing 
is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water. 
 
4 
.  
We suggest that the correct dose of fructose for breath testing 
is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water. 
 
 
5 
 
.  
 
 
We suggest that fructose and lactose breath testing should be 
performed for at least 3 h. 
 
6 
.  
We suggest that the presence of bacterial overgrowth should 
be ruled out before performing lactose or fructose breath 
testing. 
 
7 
.  
We recommend that hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide 
should all be measured simultaneously during breath 
testing. 
 
When performing lactulose breath tests for the determina-
tion of SIBO, the majority of studies have used a dose of 10 g 
( 
11,12,72 
). Higher doses incur the risk of speeding intestinal tran-
sit time, which could aff
 ect test data ( 
57 
).
 
 
With regards to the glucose breath testing, variable doses of 50 g 
( 
10,73,74 
) and 75–100 g ( 
11,15,41,75 
) have been used. Compara-
tive studies using 50 g, 75 g or 100 g have not been performed. A 
75 g dose is used for oral glucose testing in diabetics, as recom-
mended by the World Health Organization ( 
76 
); hence, from the 
practical standpoint stocking 75 g doses is less-expensive, easier 
to obtain for breath test centers and could provide an adequate 
amount of carbohydrate substrate.
 
 
In subjects with lactose and fructose intolerance, unabsorbed 
substrate is fermented by the colonic bacteria ( 
62 
) leading to 
symptoms such as gas, bloating and abdominal pain. Symptoms of 
lactose malabsorption generally occur aft
 er ingestion of 6–12 g lac-
tose (120–240 ml of milk) ( 
77–79 
). Although high doses of lactose 
(≥50 g) have been used for lactose breath test ( 
80 
), 25 g (equivalent 
of 500 ml of milk) is within the normal range of consumption and 
is the recommended dose.
 
While absorption of lactose is dependent on the lactase enzyme, 
fructose is absorbed via facilitative diff
 usion mediated by the 
glucose/fructose transporter member 5 (GLUT-5) transporter 
( 
81,82 
). However, this passive absorptive system can be easily 
overwhelmed by excess amount of fructose. Rao  
et al. ( 
67 
) have 
shown that healthy individuals have the capacity to absorb up to 
25 g of fructose while 80% of these subjects had evidence of fruc-
tose malabsorption without symptoms when tested using 50 g of 
fructose. Th
 erefore, the recommended dose for fructose breath 
testing is 25 g.
 
Signifi
 cant variation exists in the literature in terms of 
the required length of study for assessment of carbohydrate 
malabsorption, ranging from 2 to 5 h ( 
83 
). As the principle 
behind breath testing in carbohydrate malabsorption is fermen-
tation of unabsorbed substrate by the colonic bacterial fl
 ora, 
it is crucial to allow enough time for the substrate to reach

test ( 
1 
). Th
 e test should be performed for at least 3 h to ensure the 
presence of colonic fermentation. We suggest the same criteria for 
interpretation of fructose breath testing based on the results of the 
study by Rao  
et al. ( 
67 
) which showed that rise of hydrogen always 
occurs within 3 h of testing. Th
 e value of development of symp-
toms during fructose breath testing is unclear and needs further 
evaluation ( 
67,90 
).
 
Erdogan  
et al. ( 
91 
) assessed the optimal cut-off
  of glucose breath 
testing (75 g glucose) for detection of SIBO and correlated this with 
duodenal aspirates and culture (both at ≥10 
3 and ≥10 
5 c.f.u./ml) 
in 150 patients. Sensitivity of breath test was lower at 20 p.p.m. vs. 
12  p.p.m. rise of H 
2 
, at both ≥10 
3 
 (32 vs. 42%) and ≥10 
5 c.f.u./ml 
(48 vs. 64%) culture growth levels. Specifi
 city was higher at 
both ≥10 
3 (90 vs. 81%) and ≥10 
5 c.f.u./ml (86% vs. 78%) culture 
growth. George  
et al. ( 
92 
) compared the utility of hydrogen rise 
of 20  p.p.m. above baseline by 90 min aft
 er ingestion of lactulose 
vs. dual hydrogen peaks (fi
 rst peak of 10 p.p.m. above baseline 
before second peak of 20 p.p.m.) in 740 patients with gastropa-
resis. Only the hydrogen rise of 20 p.p.m. above baseline was cor-
related with severity of bloating, postprandial fullness and early 
satiety. Recently, assessment of over 15,000 lactulose breath tests 
shows that median and mean gas production levels do not elicit 
a double peak ( 
93 
). We suggest using a rise of ≥20  p.p.m. from 
baseline in hydrogen to diagnose SIBO. On the basis of current 
evidence, a double peak should not be used to diagnose SIBO and 
has no validity.
 
Th
 e interpretation of breath tests with elevated baseline H 
2 
>20 p.p.m. is not clear. Further studies are needed to clarify 
whether this is the result of lack of adherence to diet and fast-
ing or in fact representative of a SIBO variant. Th
 e interpreta-
tion of breath tests with no CH 
4 and low fi
 xed H 
2 production 
remains unclear. Such breath tests have been suggested to be 
due to abundance of H 
2 
S-producing bacteria, which cannot be 
detected using currently available gas chromatography devices 
( 
94 
). Further studies are needed to clarify the signifi
 cance of 
such a pattern.
 
Th
 e optimal criterion to defi
 ne excessive methane produc-
tion is not clear. Th
 e production pattern of methane and hydro-
gen are diff
 erent on breath testing. Unlike hydrogen, subjects 
with excessive methane production elicit an elevated methane 
level at baseline and the rise of methane during breath testing 
is not as sharp as hydrogen gas ( 
63,93 
). Hence, using the same 
cutoff
  as hydrogen for methane is not advised. Recently it has 
been shown a fasting level of ≥5 and ≥10 p.p.m. can respec-
tively predict excessive methane production with specifi
 city of 
99.7 and 100% while sensitivity was of 96.1% and 86.4% ( 
63 
). 
Th
 e sensitivity threshold of many commercially available gas 
chromatography instruments is 3 p.p.m., and as such this is 
the lowest value that could be considered positive ( 
95 
). Using 
a combination of rise in hydrogen >20 p.p.m. and >5 p.p.m. of 
methane, the sensitivity of breath test was lower at ≥10 
3 (42%) 
compared to ≥10 
5 c.f.u./ml (56%) whereas specifi
 city was higher 
at ≥10 
3 (85%) compared to ≥10 
5 c.f.u./ml (78%) ( 
91 
). Until fur-
ther data is available we suggest using a cut of ≥10 p.p.m. for 
methane positivity.
the colon and be metabolized. Rao  
et al. ( 
67 
) reported that 
the average time for reaching the gas peak concentration was 
77 min (range=30–180 min) for an abnormal fructose breath 
test, thus suggesting that 180 min is suffi
  cient to detect colonic 
fermentation. Length of glucose and lactulose breath testing 
for assessment of SIBO can be limited to two hours, therefore 
the committee considered a rise of ≥20 p.p.m. of hydrogen by 
90 min as the ideal criterion for a positive test to  
suggest the 
presence of SIBO.
 
It should be noted that in the presence of SIBO, fructose and lac-
tose are prematurely exposed to excessive small intestinal bacterial 
composition that will lead to early fermentation and elevation of 
exhaled gases ( 
36,64,84,85 
). Th
 erefore, performance of a lactulose 
or glucose breath test to rule-out SIBO should be considered prior 
to carbohydrate malabsorption breath testing to minimize false 
positive results.
 
 
All breath testing should incorporate measurement of CO 
2 
(or O 
2 
) to adjust the breath sample for non-alveolar dilution 
of exhaled air ( 
86 
). Concomitant measurement of CH 
4 
 is also 
required. Th
 e majority of the methanogenic archaea in the 
human gut (including  
M. smithii 
) utilize H 
2 in the generation of 
CH 
4 
, potentially impacting H 
2 measurements ( 
87 
). Hydrogeno-
trophic methanogens in the gut (including  
M. smithii 
) utilize 4 
mol of H 
2 
 and 1 mol of CO 
2 to produce each mol of CH 
4 ( 
refs 
88,89 
). It has been suggested that by scavenging H 
2 produced 
by neighboring microbes in this manner (the “sink eff
 ect”) 
( 
88 
),  
M. smithii 
 and other hydrogen-utilizing methanogens 
allow increased polysaccharide fermentation by neighboring 
microbes. Detection rate of an early rise in H 
2 
 production sig-
nifi
 cantly deceases in excess methane producers ( 
87 
). Overall, 
given the importance of methane in association with GI symp-
toms and the interaction of methane with hydrogen production, 
measurement of methane should be integrated in all breath tests. 
It should be noted that measurement of CH 
4 could increase the 
cost of breath testing, as portable gas chromatographs do not 
measure CH 
4 
.
 
Interpretation of breath testing results

.  
 
We suggest that a rise of ≥20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydro-
gen during the test should be considered positive for fructose 
and lactose breath testing. 
 
2 
.  
We suggest that until better data are available, for clinical 
and research purposes, a rise of ≥20 p.p.m. from baseline in 
hydrogen by 90 min should be considered a positive test for 
SIBO.

We suggest that two peaks on breath test are not required for 
the diagnosis of SIBO.

Until further data is available, we suggest that a level of

test.

based on the current evidence, we suggest using a cutoff

DISCUSSION
 
Breath testing remains a useful, inexpensive, simple, and 
safe diagnostic tool in gastroenterology. Using an evidence-
based approach, consensus was reached on 26 statements 
providing practical guidance regarding the indications, prepa-
ration, performance and interpretation of BT in clinical prac-
tice and research. Furthermore, current gaps of knowledge 
are identifi
 ed for future research directives. As compared to 
previous guidelines, these consensus statements are updated 
based on the most recent literature and provide detailed 
recommendations and clarity on drug regimens prior to BT, 
dose of substrates, established indications, limitations and 
interpretation of the results based on both hydrogen and 
methane gases.
 
 
While unanswered questions remain and there are challenges 
that need further clarifi
 cation, it is hoped that these consensus 
statements create uniformity in the use of BT and thus improve 
and optimize patient care.

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
 
Breath testing represents an important, simple and safe 
test to diagnose carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and 
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SBIO). 
 
✓ 
 
 
There is signifi
 cant heterogeneity in test performance/
preparation, the indications for breath testing and the 
interpretation of results. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
 
Consensus doses for lactulose, glucose, fructose and 
lactose breath tests are 10, 75, 25 and 25 
g, respectively. 
 
✓ 
 
 
Breath testing is useful in the diagnosis of carbohydrate 
maldigestion, methane-associated constipation but not in 
the assessment of oro-cecal transit. 
 
✓ 
 
For glucose or lactulose breath tests for SIBO, a ≥20 
p.p.m. 
rise in hydrogen by 90 
min is considered positive. 
 
✓ 
 
Methane levels ≥10 
p.p.m. are considered methane-positive. 
 
✓ 
 
 
For assessment of carbohydrate maldigestion, a rise in 
hydrogen of ≥20 
p.p.m. above baseline during breath 
testing is considered positive.
