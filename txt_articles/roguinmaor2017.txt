IMPORTANCE Magnesium supplements are widely marketed for prophylaxis of nocturnal leg
cramps (NLC) despite no evidence of significant benefit.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether magnesium oxide is better than placebo for NLC prophylaxis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial of 2 weeks eligibility screening followed by 4 weeks of treatment was conducted in
northern Israel, from February to October 2013. An intention-to-treat data analysis was
performed from March 22, 2014, to April 17, 2016. We used a volunteer sample of
community-dwelling individuals experiencing NLC, 21 years or older, with 4 or more
documented episodes of NLC during 2 weeks of screening.
INTERVENTIONS Capsules containing either magnesium oxide or a similar-looking placebo to
be taken orally, once daily at bedtime for a period of 4 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the difference in the mean
number of NLC per week between the screening and treatment phases. Secondary outcomes
included severity and duration of NLC, quality of life, and quality of sleep.
RESULTS Of the 166 volunteers, 72 (43%) were excluded, of whom 15 declined to participate
and 57 did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 94 individuals (39% male; mean [SD] age,
64.9 [11.1] years) randomly assigned to magnesium oxide (48) or placebo (46), 6 did not
complete the study protocol (3 in each group). Mean (SD) change of NLC was −3.41 (4.05)
(from 7.84 [5.68] to 4.44 [5.66]) and −3.03 (4.53) (from 8.51 [5.20] to 5.48 [4.93]) per week in
the magnesium oxide and placebo groups, respectively, a difference between groups of 0.38
(0.48) NLC per week (P = .67 in an intention-to-treat analysis). There were no between-group
differences in the severity and duration of NLC, quality of life, or quality of sleep.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Oral magnesium oxide was not superior to placebo for older
adults experiencing NLC. The decrease in the mean number of NLC per week, from the
screening to the treatment phase in both groups, is probably a placebo effect that may
explain the wide use of magnesium for NLC.

N
octurnallegcramps(NLC)arepainful,involuntarycon-
tractions of muscles occurring at rest, mostly at night,
and causing a palpable knot in the muscle.1 Up to 60%
of adults report having NLC.2 In a survey of 490 veterans who
were asked about leg symptoms, 276 (56%) reported experi-
encing NLC, among them 67 (24%) having cramps 1 to 4 times
a week.3 Frequent NLC may cause significant distress and
nighttime disturbance.4,5 Most NLC occurring in adults seem
to be idiopathic. Potential predisposing factors include hemo-
dialysis, electrolyte imbalance, and neurologic, endocrine,
metabolic, vascular, medication-related, toxic, and congeni-
tal conditions.4 Quinine is the only treatment with moderate-
quality evidence of significantly reducing the frequency and
intensity of muscle cramps.6 However, the US Food and Drug
Administration issued a warning in 2010 against the use of qui-
nine for treating NLC due to the risk of serious and life-
threatening reactions and its unfavorable risk-to-benefit
ratio.7,8
Magnesium is a commonly used remediation for NLC,
particularly in Latin America and Europe.4 Its effectiveness
in treating NLC was first demonstrated in a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled study of pregnant women.9
Subsequent trials—2 crossover studies10,11 and a placebo-
controlled trial of magnesium infusion12—did not show sig-
nificant benefit by magnesium citrate supplements for NLC
in older adults.13 However, none of the published studies
investigated oral magnesium oxide. Magnesium is an intra-
cellular cation, and its serum concentrations (only about 1%
of total body magnesium) may not accurately mirror magne-
sium status.14 A recent study investigated the effect of
supplemental oral magnesium oxide, vs magnesium citrate,
on intracellular magnesium levels in healthy subjects.15 Oral
magnesium oxide significantly increased intracellular mag-
nesium levels compared with magnesium citrate. On the
basis of this observation, we initiated a prospective clinical
trial to test the hypothesis that magnesium oxide supple-
mentation may reduce the frequency and severity of NLC
and subsequently improve quality of life and quality of sleep
of older adults.
Methods
Design Overview
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in-
vestigated the effect of magnesium oxide supplementation on
NLC. Initially, participants underwent 2 weeks of eligibility
screening without treatment, during which they docu-
mented all episodes of NLC, followed by 4 weeks of treat-
ment. The primary end point was the effect of magnesium
oxide supplementation on the frequency of NLC. Secondary
objectives were severity and duration of NLC, quality of sleep,
and quality of life.
Setting and Participants
The study took place at community clinics of Clalit Health Ser-
vices (CHS) in northern Israel, from February to October 2013.
We used advertisements in CHS clinics, the local media, and
pharmacies to invite individuals suffering from NLC to par-
ticipate in the trial. Initially, study stuff interviewed inter-
ested patients who had called to determine their eligibility. We
informed respondents who were currently taking magne-
sium supplements and expressed interest in participating that
they could enroll if they agreed to stop taking the supple-
ments at least 10 days before enrollment. Thereafter, at an in-
person, baseline evaluation visit we provided a comprehen-
sive description of the study rationale and process. After
confirming that each candidate experienced NLC, described
as a painful, involuntary contraction of muscles occurring at
rest,mostlyatnight,andcausingapalpableknotinthemuscle,
the participant signed an informed consent.
Inclusion criteria were community-dwelling individuals,
ageolderthan21years,4ormoredocumentedepisodesofNLC
during the 2-week screening phase, and insurance with CHS.
Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, current treatment with qui-
nine,concurrentintakeofamagnesiumsupplement,renalfail-
ure (defined as serum creatinine level >2 mg/dL [to convert to
micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and major neurologi-
caldiseasessuchasamyotrophiclateralsclerosis,multiplescle-
rosis, paraplegia, or quadriplegia.
Randomization and Intervention
We randomly allocated participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive
either magnesium oxide (inorganic granular magnesium com-
plex, composed of magnesium oxide and magnesium oxide
monohydrate865mg,providing520mgoffreeelementalMg2+
[magnesium]) or a similar-looking placebo to be taken orally,
once daily at bedtime for a period of 4 weeks.
Identical-looking capsules, containing either magnesium
oxide or placebo, were prepacked in identical bottles and con-
secutively numbered prior to the study initiation. We gener-
ated a randomization schedule, derived from a computer-
generated randomization procedure of numbers from 1 to
220, in blocks of 10. The randomization scheme was gener-
ated by using the website Randomization.com (http://www
.randomization.com). We assigned eligible participants
sequential numbers according to the randomization schedule,
and they received the corresponding numbered bottle of
capsules. Both patients and researchers were blind to the
treatment allocation. The manufacturer provided the study
participants reimbursement of travel expenses (of up to the
equivalentof$50)thatwasgiventoeachparticipantatthefinal
meeting after retrieving the medication bottle.
Key Points
Question Is magnesium oxide significantly more effective than
placebo in reducing the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 94 adults,
the mean number of nocturnal leg cramps per week decreased
significantly in both the magnesium oxide and placebo groups,
with no significant difference between the groups.
Meaning This trial suggests that magnesium oxide is not
significantly better than placebo for alleviating nocturnal leg
cramps.

Outcomes and Follow-up
Theprimaryoutcomewasthemeandifferenceineffectofmag-
nesium oxide, compared with placebo, on the frequency of
NLC. Secondary objectives were severity and duration of NLC,
quality of sleep, and quality of life.
We measured the primary outcome by comparing the
change in the mean number of episodes of NLC per week, dur-
ingthe2-weekscreeningandthe4-weektreatmentphases,be-
tween the magnesium oxide and placebo groups. Secondary
outcomes were changes in the severity and duration of NLC,
in quality of life, and in quality of sleep. We collected pa-
tients’demographic and clinical characteristics at their base-
line visit through self-report questionnaires.
Outcome Measurement Tools
We measured the number, severity, and duration of NLC as re-
corded daily by the study participants in a designated, struc-
tured sleep diary. The Nocturnal Cramps Sleep Diary (NCSD)
(eAppendix in Supplement 1) is a combined adaptation of the
“assessment, Espie diary form,”16 which is based mainly on
Espie’
s book,17(p17) and the Two Week Sleep Diary,18 designed
for the purpose of the present study. Throughout this 6-week
period, participating individuals documented daily all epi-
sodes of NLC in the NCSD. They reported every morning in the
diary the frequency (ie, the absolute number), duration, and
severity of NLC. The severity of pain experienced during NLC
wasrecordedinthediaryonanumberedscaleof0to10(0 = no
pain, 10 = intolerable pain). Participant assessed and re-
ported the duration of each cramp in minutes.
The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) measured qual-
ity of life.19 This 36-question survey yields an 8-scale profile
of functional health and well-being, as well as psychometri-
callybasedphysicalandmentalhealthsummarymeasuresand
a preference-based health utility index. This generic measure
has demonstrated effectiveness in surveys of general and spe-
cific populations, in comparing the relative burden of dis-
eases and in differentiating the health benefits produced by a
wide range of different treatments.20 It has been validated in
Hebrew.21
We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to mea-
sure quality of sleep.22 The PSQI is a standardized self-
administered questionnaire that assesses subjective sleep
quality over the previous month. The PSQI comprises 19 self-
rated questions grouped into 7 component scores. Each score
weighs equally on a 0 to 3 point scale. The 7 component
scores are totaled to provide a global PSQI score. The global
score ranges from 0 to 21. A global score of 5 or more indicates
poor sleep quality: the higher the score, the worse the quality
of sleep. The PSQI has been validated in Hebrew.23 We mea-
sured quality of life and quality of sleep twice: at enrollment
and within 1 week after the end of the treatment period of
each participant.
Outcomes and Adherence Ascertainment
During the screening and treatment phases of the study (2 and
4weeks,respectively),thestudyparticipantsfilledintheNCSD
daily, at home. To increase adherence and proper monitoring
and documentation of sleep and NLC events, a daily text mes-
sage reminder was delivered every morning to each partici-
pant (all of them had a mobile telephone). Additionally, twice
a week we made a telephone call to each study participant in-
quiring about possible adverse events and encouraging them
to take the study treatment and to fill in the diary every eve-
ning and morning.
We intentionally placed 32 capsules in each medication
bottle, 4 more than the needed 28 capsules for the 4 weeks of
the intervention. On the final visit, we asked all participants
to bring the study medication bottles, with the remaining cap-
sules,andcountedthem.Weinstructedallparticipantstoavoid
consumption of vitamin and mineral supplements during the
study.
Interim Analysis and Guidelines for Study Termination
The study protocol (Supplement 2) included a preplanned
blinded interim analysis of efficacy or futility when outcome
results were available for approximately half of the antici-
pated number of participants. We submitted this analysis to
anappointedindependentdatareviewingandmonitoringcom-
mittee that reviewed the interim results. The committee’
s role
was to monitor the primary outcome, ensure the safety of pa-
tients, make recommendations to continue or alter the study
design, and determine the necessity of early termination of the
trial due to efficacy, harm, or futility.
Ethical Issues
The study medication is a freely available, over-the-counter
food supplement. We also recruited individuals who were
taking magnesium supplements before enrollment if they
wanted to participate and freely agreed to stop taking them.
This was possible because they stopped taking the supple-
ment at least 10 days before enrollment. The Community
Independent Review Board of CHS approved the study. All
participants provided written informed consent prior to any
study procedure.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that 110 participants would be needed in each
group to achieve 80% power to detect a treatment difference
at a 2-sided .05 significance level if the true difference be-
tweentreatmentsis1(differenceinmeanchangebetweentreat-
ment groups) NLC per week. This was based on the assump-
tion, and the results reported by Roffe et al,11 that the standard
deviation of the mean number of NLC per week is 3.24
We performed all data analyses according to the intention-
to-treat principle, and the analysis, data collection, and pro-
cessing were blinded with respect to treatment group assign-
ment. Randomized participants who did not complete the
study were included in their assigned study groups for the pri-
mary analysis. We used multiple imputations from the screen-
ing values of each participating individual to replace missing
values during the treatment phase. Treatment effects for pri-
mary and secondary outcome variables in the study were
evaluated using a repeated-measure analysis, comparing the
individual differences between treatment groups by treat-
ment phase (interaction effect). Thus, we defined the trial
outcome as the difference in the mean change from the

screening to the treatment phase in the number of NLC
between the treatment groups, that is, magnesium oxide vs
placebo. We performed a similar comparison with the data
on severity and duration of NLC. We measured quality of life
and quality of sleep twice: at enrollment and within 1 week
after the end of the treatment period of each participant.
We used the Bonferroni approach25 as an adjustment for
multiple comparisons for the SF-36 subscale measures, result-
ing in a critical P value of .006 (according to the formula of de-
sired P value [.05] divided by the number of comparisons [8]).
Additionally, we conducted a 2-way (group over time) trend
analysisfortheprimaryoutcome,examiningforpossibletrends
in treatment effects across time.
We compared baseline characteristics between the groups
using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the t test for con-
tinuous variables. Models evaluating possible modification ef-
fects of baseline characteristics on outcomes were conducted
by including terms of interactions between the 2 groups and
by examining the effect of each of these variables on the study
outcomes using 2-way analysis of covariance.
We conducted all analyses using SPSS software, version 21
(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows). Both patients and research-
erswereblindtothetreatmentallocationthroughoutthestudy
until the decision on early termination.
Results
From February through October 2013, 166 individuals re-
sponded to the advertisements and were screened for eligi-
bility for the study. Of these 166 candidates, 94 (56.6%) indi-
viduals fulfilled the study’
s inclusion criteria and underwent
randomization. The study protocol was completed fully by 88
(93.6%)oftherandomizedindividuals(Figure1).Baselinechar-
acteristics of the participating individuals were similar be-
tween the treatment groups (Table 1). The characteristics of
those who completed the study protocol did not differ signifi-
cantly from the characteristics of those who did not.
The mean numbers of NLC per week during the 2-week
screening period were similar between the groups (Table 2).
The mean (SD) number of NLC per week decreased signifi-
cantly from the screening to the treatment phase, by 48.4%
(41.2%) and 29.5% (64.8%) for the magnesium oxide and pla-
cebo groups, respectively (P < .001 for the change within each
group). However, there was no statistically significant differ-
ence in the primary outcome of change in mean (SD) NLC fre-
quency per week between the magnesium oxide and placebo
groups: −3.41 (4.05) and −3.03 (4.53), respectively, a differ-
ence between the groups of −0.38 (0.48) NLC per week
(P = .67). A sensitivity analysis to assess the possible effect of
missing data yielded results that were essentially identical to
those presented in Table 2. We observed similar results in the
analysis of the secondary outcomes, as presented in Table 2.
The effect on severity and duration of NLC was also not sig-
nificant(P = .38andP = .30,respectively).Furthermore,nosta-
tistically significant differences were observed between the
treatment groups in the changes in scores from enrollment to
the end of the treatment period, in the total SF-36 score, the
scores of any of its components, and in the PSQI global score
(Table 2). Additionally, to allow the combination of our re-
sults in the meta-analysis, we calculated the minimum clini-
cally important difference (ie, the number of people obtain-
ing 25% reduction in NLC) and obtained 75% (n = 36) and 63%
(n = 29) in the magnesium oxide and placebo groups, respec-
tively, a nonsignificant difference (P = .21).
We tested for interaction terms and found no interaction
effect between any of the baseline characteristics of the par-
ticipants examined and any of the outcomes. Additionally, we
conducted a repeated-measures analysis of variance for trend
analysis with specific contrasts that compared the differ-
ences in mean values of outcome variables during the screen-
ing and treatment periods (5 points of time). The analysis ex-
amines the trend of change over time for the entire sample and
within each group, while controlling the cumulative statisti-
calerrorofcorrelatedcomparisons(P = .86fortrend)(Figure2).
We conducted a pill count in the 88 participants who com-
pleted the study protocol fully. The number of capsules in the
retrieved bottles ranged from 2 to 6 (mean of 4.1 per partici-
pant) and was explained by the participants to be due to for-
getfulness (twice in 4 cases and once in 3) and continuation
for an additional 2 days (1 participant).
Adverse Events

mostlygastrointestinal,occurredin14and13participantsinthe
magnesium oxide and placebo groups, respectively.
Study Termination
On April 1, 2014, we submitted the results of 94 participants
(43% of the 220 planned) for a blinded interim analysis. The
resultsshowedthatmagnesiumforthetreatmentofNLCissafe
but probably not more effective than placebo. With 43% of the
study population recruited, the chances that the differences
between the groups in the outcomes assessed would change
and become significant were low; thus, at this stage the com-
mittee recommended that the study be discontinued due to
lack of efficacy.
Discussion
This randomized clinical trial did not confirm our hypothesis
that magnesium oxide supplementation is more effective than
placebo in reducing NLC in community-dwelling individuals.
To our knowledge, this is the first study in which magnesium
oxide, rather than magnesium citrate, was tested as prophy-
laxis for NLC. Despite the recent evidence of improved intra-
cellular absorption,15 magnesium oxide supplementation was
not significantly better than placebo. There was no evidence
that the effect of treatment was dependent on demographic
or clinical characteristics of the participants, including the use
of magnesium supplements before enrollment.

Magnesium plays an important role in hundreds of meta-
bolic reactions and in muscle function.26
Magnesium deficiency can result from various etiolo-
gies, and elderly people are particularly at risk because of the
combination of chronic diseases, poor nutrition, decreased ab-
sorptionofmagnesium,andincreasedrenalexertion.27Asmag-
nesium deficiency is associated with neuronal excitability and
enhances neuromuscular transmission,4,28,29 and because its
substitution has been shown to be effective in eclampsia-
related seizures,30,31 a number of researchers have suggested
a possible beneficial role of magnesium supplementation in
NLC. Some effectiveness was indeed demonstrated in a study
of pregnant women.9 However, subsequent trials in nonpreg-
nant individuals did not demonstrate effectiveness of mag-
nesium supplementation as prophylaxis for NLC in the gen-
eral population.13,32
The present study is based on self-reported outcomes.
The prospective nature and the conduct of a 2-week screen-
ing period, during which individuals were instructed to rec-
ord data daily, in a diary, helped mitigate recall bias and
screened for participants who would not adhere to the
study protocol. Telephone calls and text messages during
the screening and treatment phases presumably contributed
to the adherence to the study protocol and the consumption
of the study medication, as was reflected in the pill count
and the low dropout rate.
Limitations
Limitations of the study include the modest number of partici-
pants, who were mostly elderly individuals, and the interven-
tion period of only 4 weeks. Participants were self-selected in-
dividuals who volunteered to participate, introducing certain
selection bias. However, all reported trials were smaller or of
similarsizeandduration.Giventheintensivefollow-upandme-
ticulous event adjudication, coupled with the patient-
centered approach, it seems unlikely that a significant benefi-
cialeffectwasmissed.Thisledtheindependentdatareviewing
and monitoring committee to recommend early termination of
the study after 94 participants due to lack of efficacy.
Conclusions
Previous research shows inconclusive results concerning the
efficacy of magnesium therapy in the treatment of NLC in gen-
eralpopulationsduetotherelativelylowmethodologicalquali-
ties of the trials.32 Nevertheless, magnesium supplements are
widely marketed, and purchased, worldwide as a preventive
treatment for muscle cramps. The statistically significant de-
crease in the frequency of NLC following treatment with both
magnesium and placebo may explain the perceived benefit ex-
perienced by magnesium users. However, this randomized
clinical trial suggests that magnesium oxide supplementa-
tion is no better than placebo for NLC. It appears unlikely that
older adults with NLC will significantly benefit from magne-
sium supplementation.
