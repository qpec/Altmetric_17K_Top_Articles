ABSTRACT
Background Knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction is
common and increases the risk of osteoarthritis. There is
sparse evidence to guide return to sport (RTS) decisions
in this population.
Objectives To assess the relationship between knee
reinjury after ACL reconstruction and (1) return to level
I sports, (2) timing of RTS and (3) knee function prior to
return.
Methods 106 patients who participated in pivoting
sports participated in this prospective 2-year cohort
study. Sports participation and knee reinjury were
recorded monthly. Knee function was assessed with the
Knee Outcome Survey—Activities of Daily Living Scale,
global rating scale of function, and quadriceps strength
and hop test symmetry. Pass RTS criteria were defined as
scores >90 on all tests, failure as failing any.
Results Patients who returned to level I sports had a
4.32 (p=0.048) times higher reinjury rate than those
who did not. The reinjury rate was significantly reduced
by 51% for each month RTS was delayed until 9 months
after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was
observed. 38.2% of those who failed RTS criteria
suffered reinjuries versus 5.6% of those who passed (HR
0.16, p=0.075). More symmetrical quadriceps strength
prior to return significantly reduced the knee reinjury
rate.
Conclusions Returning to level I sports after ACL
reconstruction leads to a more than 4-fold increase in
reinjury rates over 2 years. RTS 9 months or later after
surgery and more symmetrical quadriceps strength prior
to return substantially reduce the reinjury rate.
INTRODUCTION
In total, 250 000 ACL injuries are estimated to
occur annually in the USA.1 The short-term and
long-term consequences include muscle weakness,
functional
deficits,
lower
sports
participation,
increased risk of knee reinjury and knee osteoarth-
ritis (OA).2–5 Up to 30% of young active patients
who undergo reconstruction suffer a second ACL
rupture in the first few years after surgery,3
6
leading to poorer health-related quality of life.7
The most devastating outcome, however, is the sig-
nificantly increased rate of knee OA in those
ACL-injured individuals who also sustain a menis-
cus injury. Within 5 years, 50% of patients may
undergo meniscus surgery,8 increasing their prog-
nosis of post-traumatic knee OA from 0–13% to
21–48%.4 W
e can reduce this high rate of knee OA
through prevention of secondary meniscus injuries.
In the USA alone, halving the OA rate after ACL
injury could lead to $1.1 billion in cost savings
annually.9
Intent to return to level I ( jumping, pivoting and
hard cutting) sports10–12 is the main reason why a
patient with an ACL rupture undergoes ACL recon-
struction.5 Younger age and participation in pivot-
ing
sports
are
also
unfortunately
consistent
predictors of another ACL rupture after ACL recon-
struction.13–17 Activity restrictions based on post-
surgical time (a surrogate for biological healing) and
functional status (assessed with test batteries) have
been advocated to enable the safest possible return
to sport (RTS).18 19 There is currently no clear evi-
dence to guide whether participation in level I
sports should be delayed or what level of function
the patient should achieve prior to returning to
level I sports.20
The aims of this study were therefore to assess if
the 2-year risk of a knee reinjury after ACL recon-
struction was associated with (1) return to level I
sports, (2) timing of return to level I sports and (3)
knee function prior to return to level I sport.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants
This cohort consists of the ACL-injured patients in
the Norwegian arm (n=150) of the Delaware-Oslo
ACL Cohort Study (n=300) who underwent ACL
reconstruction (n=106).5 Patients were consecu-
tively screened for inclusion at the Norwegian
Sports Medicine Clinic between 2007 and 2011.
W
e included patients who had sustained a unilateral
ACL rupture within 3 months of enrolment (veri-
fied by MRI and ≥3 mm side-to-side difference in
anterior laxity measured by KT-100021). Other
inclusion criteria were age between 13 and 60 years
and preinjury participation in level I or II sports10
at least twice weekly. Patients were excluded if
they had current or previous injury to the contralat-
eral knee, previous knee injury on the index knee,
or concomitant grade III knee ligament injury,
fracture or full-thickness cartilage defects. Patients
with meniscus injuries were excluded only if they
had pain or effusion during plyometric activities
that
had
not
resolved
3 months
from
injury.
Approval from the Regional Committee for Medical
Research Ethics was obtained, and written informed
consent was acquired, prior to inclusion.

 decided after this 5-week programme. The ACL reconstruction
was performed in one of seven different hospitals, using bone-
patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or a hamstrings autograft. The post-
operative rehabilitation was individually tailored on the basis of
concomitant surgery, graft choice and function. Rehabilitation
consisted of three phases: the acute phase where the aims were
to eliminate effusion and range of motion (ROM) deficits and
minimise muscle atrophy. The rehabilitation phase where the
aims were to regain neuromuscular control of terminal knee
extension in weight-bearing positions and to regain ≥80%
muscle strength and hop performance. The last phase, the RTS
phase, aimed at regaining ≥90% muscle strength and hop per-
formance, while transitioning to sport through sport-specific
drills and gradual participation. Patients were advised against
full participation in level I sports if they had not regained
>90% quadriceps and hamstring strength and hopping per-
formance compared with the uninjured leg.
Data collection
Starting the first month after ACL reconstruction, sports partici-
pation data were collected monthly using an online activity
survey.11 Patients reported which sports they participated in by
ticking a box for the respective sport. Each month, one
reminder was automatically sent out to patients who had not
responded after 1 week. The online activity survey has excellent
test–retest reliability (κ=0.92 for level I sports participation).11
Knee reinjuries with an acute onset were recorded through the
online survey and at clinical follow-ups at 6 months, 1 year and
2 years after reconstruction. The injuries were diagnosed accord-
ing to the standard practice at our clinic. Of 24 reinjured
patients, 2 were diagnosed after clinical examination, 10 after
clinical examination and MRI, 5 after clinical examination and
arthroscopic surgery, and 7 after clinical examination, MRI and
arthroscopic surgery.
The comprehensive RTS test battery19 23 24 investigated in
this study consisted of isokinetic quadriceps strength testing,
four single-legged hop tests and two self-report outcomes.23 24
These data were collected at baseline (mean 2.1±0.6 months
after injury) and at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Isokinetic
concentric quadriceps strength was measured at 60°/s with an
electromechanical dynamometer (Biodex6000, Biodex Medical
Systems, Shirley, New York, USA). Four submaximal practice
trials were followed by 1 min rest before five maximum effort
repetitions were recorded. After strength testing, four hop tests
were performed in the following order: single hop for distance,
crossover hop for distance, triple hop for distance and 6 m
timed hop.25 26 All patients performed one practice trial hop
and then two hops were recorded. The uninvolved leg was
always tested first. After the hop testing, patients completed the
Knee
Outcome
Survey—Activities
of
Daily
Living
Scale
(KOS-ADLS)27 and a global rating scale (GRS) of perceived func-
tion.23 The KOS-ADLS is a 14-item self-reported assessment of
symptoms and function in activities of daily living, scored from
0 (worst) to 100 (best). The GRS asks the patient to rate current
knee function on a scale from 0 (not able to perform any activ-
ity) to 100 (level of function prior to the knee injury).
Data management and statistical analysis
Return to level I sport was defined as any reported participation
in handball, football, basketball or floorball, regardless of train-
ing/match participation or level of competition. The first
recorded participation in level I sports was reported in months
after surgery.
W
e extracted data on knee function from the 6-month
follow-up for those who returned to level I sports 5–11 months
after surgery (n=49) and from the 12-month follow-up for
those who returned 12–23 months after surgery (n=20). The
limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) of the peak quadriceps torque
(highest achieved value) and hop test distance/time were calcu-
lated by involved/uninvolved×100, except for the 6 m timed
hop test which was calculated by uninvolved/involved×100.
Patients were classified as having passed RTS criteria if they
scored >90 on all seven variables. Patients who returned to
level I sport <5 months after surgery (n=4) were a priori classi-
fied as not having passed RTS criteria.23 24
A Cox proportional hazards regression model with months
after surgery as the time variable was used to assess the reinjury
rate in patients who participated in level I sports after surgery
versus those who did not. Cox regression models were also used
to assess the association between knee reinjury and time of
return, and knee function prior to return to level I sports. Time 0
was defined as the first month of level I sports participation to
limit bias from more sports exposure in patients who returned
early to level I sports. The independent variables were months
from surgery to RTS, passing/failing RTS criteria and continuous
LSIs of the individual RTS variables. Separate results were
reported for those who returned before and after 9 months after
surgery, as the assumption of proportionality was violated in the
analysis of time of return. All analyses were adjusted for age.
T
wo-sided p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
From the original 106 patients who underwent ACL reconstruc-
tion, 100 (94.3%) had data on sports participation and knee
reinjuries (1 withdrew from the study, 5 did not respond to the
online activity survey). The monthly data on sports participation
and reinjuries were 92.9% complete for the 100 patients (2230
reports in total). Descriptive characteristics of the cohort can be
seen in table 1.
In total, 74 of the 83 patients who previously participated in
level I sports returned to level I sports within 2 years of ACL
reconstruction. None of the 17 who did not participate in level
I sport before injury participated in level I sports after surgery.
The mean number of months participating in level I sports was
8.1±5.7 over the two postoperative years. The time of return to
level I sports varied from 3 to 23 months after surgery, with a
median of 8 months after surgery.
In total, 69 of the 74 (93.2%) patients who participated in
level I sports underwent functional testing prior to RTS. One
patient did not attend any of the follow-ups. Four patients
returned to sport fewer than 5 months after surgery. All four of
these patients suffered a knee reinjury within 2 months of return.
The mean time from functional testing to return to level I sport
was 2.3±2.4 months. Of the 49 patients who returned to level I
sports 5–11 months after surgery, 7 (14.3%) had passed the RTS
criteria at the 6-month follow-up test. Eleven of the 20 patients
(55.0%) who returned to level I sport 12–23 months after
surgery had passed the RTS criteria at the 12-month follow-up.
In total, 18 of the 74 patients (24.3%) were classified as having
passed the functional RTS criteria prior to RTS.
T
wenty-four (24.0%) patients sustained 28 knee reinjuries,
including 8 ACL graft ruptures and 8 medial meniscus injuries
(table 2). The reinjuries occurred from the 3rd to the 22nd post-
operative month, with a median of 13 months after surgery. The
time between returning to level I sports and sustaining a knee
reinjury varied from <1 month to 16 months, with 45.5% of
the reinjuries sustained within 2 months of RTS. In the 26

 patients who did not return to level I sports, two reported a
knee reinjury (7.7%). The 2-year reinjury risk in patients who
returned to level I sports after surgery was 29.7% (22 of 74).
After adjusting for age, patients who participated in level I
sports after ACL reconstruction had a 4.32 (95% CI 1.01 to
18.40, p=0.048) times higher reinjury rate than those who par-
ticipated in lower level sports (figure 1).
During the first 9 months after surgery, a later RTS was sig-
nificantly associated with a lower reinjury rate. For every
1 month delay in RTS, the reinjury rate was reduced by 51%
(table 3). In patients who returned between 9 and 23 months
after surgery, time to return was not significantly associated with
knee reinjury. Patients who participated in level I sports earlier
than 9 months after surgery sustained 39.5% reinjuries (15 of
38), compared with 19.4% knee reinjuries (7 of 36) in those
who returned to level I sports later than 9 months after surgery.
Of the 55 patients who failed RTS criteria, 21 (38.2%) suf-
fered knee reinjuries (figure 2). Only 1 of the 18 patients
(5.6%) who passed RTS criteria suffered a knee reinjury.
Patients who passed the RTS criteria showed a not statistically
significant 84% lower reinjury rate (HR 0.16 (95% CI 0.02 to
1.20, p=0.075)). Of the individual components in the RTS
test battery, quadriceps strength deficit prior to return to level
I sport was a significant predictor of a knee reinjury, with a 3%
reduced reinjury rate for every one percentage point increase
in strength symmetry (table 3). Fifteen of the 45 patients
(33.3%) who returned to level I sport with quadriceps
LSI<90% suffered reinjuries, versus three (12.5%) reinjuries
in the 24 patients who had quadriceps LSI>90% prior to
return.
DISCUSSION
This 2-year prospective study showed that the knee reinjury rate
was over four times higher in ACL reconstructed patients who
returned to level I sports after surgery. Furthermore, returning
to sport earlier after surgery and having asymmetrical quadri-
ceps strength prior to return increased the risk of knee reinjury.
Our study is the first to evaluate the risk of all acute knee
reinjuries in those who return to high level pivoting sports.
Meniscus injury was the most frequent knee reinjury, a signifi-
cant factor for development of OA.28 Reducing the risk of sec-
ondary injuries is therefore of uttermost importance. The age
and sex distribution of our patient sample is similar to patients
in the Scandinavian ACL registries,29 and the ACL reinjury rate
seems to be generally consistent with previous studies in young,
active adults,30 31 yet lower than that of high school athletes.3
Previous studies on time to sports return and the risk of
contralateral ACL rupture or ACL graft rupture have shown
conflicting evidence.3

 demands on the knee, and our finding of an increased risk with
earlier sports return may be specific to athletes who return to
level I sports. The increased risk could be due to insufficient
biological healing (eg, graft incorporation and remodelling),
incomplete rehabilitation or both. Our results suggest that time
to return is associated with reinjury, and the effect is larger in
the early months after surgery. Of note, all patients who
returned to sport before 5 months suffered a knee reinjury.
Beyond 9 months after surgery, we did not find a statistically
significant reduction in the risk for knee reinjury. Still, 19.4% of
these patients also suffered knee reinjuries. Time alone is there-
fore not sufficient for determining readiness for level I sports
participation.
Our findings support the use of both time-based and func-
tional RTS criteria. There was an estimated 84% lower knee
reinjury rate in patients who passed RTS criteria, a magnitude
of high clinical relevance. This finding was not statistically sig-
nificant (p=0.075), most likely due to the low statistical power,
as only one of the 18 patients who passed the criteria and
returned to sport suffered a knee reinjury. The low proportion
of patients who passed RTS criteria is not surprising as the
investigated RTS battery was not used to determine when
patients were cleared to RTS in our study. Further, patients were
tested 2.3±2.4 months prior to return, and a higher number of
patients might have passed had they undergone testing immedi-
ately prior to RTS. W
e have previously reported similar rates of
passing RTS criteria at 6 months for the entire Delaware-Oslo
ACL Cohort.23 The rate of passing RTS criteria was 52.5% at
1 year after surgery,23 and only 66% had quadriceps strength
symmetry ≥90% 2 years after surgery.5 These outcomes exist in
a cohort that has shown superior patient-reported outcomes
compared with the general ACL reconstructed population,32
suggesting that even larger functional deficits might persist after
usual care.
While we still do not know the optimal content of an RTS
test battery,19 our results show that quadriceps strength testing
should be included. Asymmetrical quadriceps strength at the
time of RTS is associated with asymmetrical knee biomechanics
during hopping,33 which in turn has been found to predict a
second ACL injury.34 Quadriceps weakness is also a risk factor
for knee OA,35 further highlighting the importance of thorough
rehabilitation
and
quadriceps
strength
assessment.
Postural
control deficits and altered neuromuscular control of the hip
and knee have also been found to predispose an athlete to a
second ACL injury.34 So far, modifiable risk factors for reinjury
after ACL reconstruction have only been identified using sophis-
ticated testing equipment
(isokinetic dynamometry and 3-
dimensional motion analysis), and a future focus should be to
validate more clinically accessible tests.
The main strength of this study is the frequent follow-up and
high follow-up rate of ACL reconstructed patients who were con-
secutively screened for inclusion at one sports medicine clinic. A
main limitation is the lack of exact athlete exposure time. RTS
was defined as their first participation in a level I sport, and not
necessarily full participation including match play. W
e were
unable to control for the exact time spent in sports, full or
limited participation, and training/match exposure.

 CONCLUSION
Athletes who undergo ACL reconstruction should be informed
that postoperative participation in level I sports increases the
2-year knee reinjury rate more than four times. A later return to
level I sports and more symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to
return decreases this rate significantly. A combination of strict
time-based and functional RTS criteria therefore has great
potential to improve long-term function, substantially decrease
the prevalence of post-traumatic knee OA in these patients, and
reduce downstream healthcare costs.
What are the findings?
▸ In the first 2 years after ACL reconstruction, 30% of people
who returned to level I sports sustained a reinjury compared
with 8% of those who participated in lower level sports.
▸ For every month that return to sport was delayed, until
9 months after ACL reconstruction, the rate of knee reinjury
was reduced by 51%.
▸ More symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return to
sport significantly reduced the knee reinjury rate.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Clinicians should inform patients of the increased risk of
knee reinjury if they decide to return to level I sport.
▸ Strict time-based and functional return to sport criteria
should be implemented.
▸ Return to level I sport should be delayed until at least
9 months have passed from surgery and the patient has
regained quadriceps strength comparable to the uninjured
side.
