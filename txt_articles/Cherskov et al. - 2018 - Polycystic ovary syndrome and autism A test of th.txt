Polycystic ovary syndrome and autism: A
test of the prenatal sex steroid theory
Adriana Cherskov1, Alexa Pohl1, Carrie Allison1, Heping Zhang2, Rupert A. Payne3,4 and Simon Baron-Cohen1,5
Abstract
Elevated levels of prenatal testosterone may increase the risk for autism spectrum conditions (autism). Given that
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is also associated with elevated prenatal testosterone and its precursor sex steroids,
a hypothesis from the prenatal sex steroid theory is that women with PCOS should have elevated autistic traits and a
higher rate of autism among their children. Using electronic health records obtained from the Clinical Practice
Research Datalink (CPRD) in the UK between 1990 and 2014, we conducted three matched case-control studies.
Studies 1 and 2 examined the risk of PCOS in women with autism (n = 971) and the risk of autism in women with
PCOS (n = 26,263), respectively, compared with matched controls. Study 3 examined the odds ratio (OR) of autism in
first-born children of women with PCOS (n = 8588), matched to 41,127 controls. In Studies 1 and 2 we found increased
prevalence of PCOS in women with autism (2.3% vs. 1.1%; unadjusted OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22–3.30) and elevated rates of
autism in women with PCOS (0.17% vs. 0.09%, unadjusted OR: 1.94 CI: 1.37–2.76). In Study 3 we found the odds of
having a child with autism were significantly increased, even after adjustment for maternal psychiatric diagnoses,
obstetric complications, and maternal metabolic conditions (unadjusted OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.28–2.00; adjusted OR: 1.35,
95% CI: 1.06–1.73). These studies provide further evidence that women with PCOS and their children have a greater
risk of autism.
Introduction
Autism spectrum conditions (henceforth autism) are
characterised by impairments in communication and
social interaction, alongside unusually narrow interests
and repetitive behaviours. The prenatal sex steroid
theory of autism posits that among the many players
likely implicated in autism are steroid sex hormones and
androgens in particular. Autism is disproportionately
observed in males, with up to four times as many males
diagnosed with the condition1,2. In addition, the hall-
marks of autism suggest an exaggeration of systemising
and down-regulation of empathy1,3. Since these psy-
chological characteristics are associated with prenatal
testosterone4,5, elevated exposure to prenatal testoster-
one during a critical stage of neurological sex differ-
entiation may also be contributing to the male bias of
autism.
Elevated levels of amniotic steroid hormones, including
androgens, progesterone, 17a-hydroxy-progesterone, and
cortisol, have been associated with autism in both male
and female children6. Furthermore, prenatal testosterone
levels in amniotic fluid in the second trimester, within the
hypothesised critical period for neural sexual differentia-
tion (8–24 weeks of gestation)7,8, positively correlated with
attention to detail9, interest in systems4, narrow inter-
ests10, and other specific autistic traits11,12. Lombardo et al.
have shown that variation in foetal testosterone predicts
grey matter volume in three sexually dimorphic brain
regions (planum temporale, a language area, superior
temporal
sulcus,
involved
in
face-processing,
and
temporo-parietal junction, involved in theory-of-mind), all
of which are atypical in structure and/or function in

 autism13. Together, these findings have come to define the
prenatal sex steroid theory of autism.
An increased prevalence of androgen-related condi-
tions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has also
been reported in women with autism14–16. One of the
most common endocrine disorders, PCOS occurs in
7–10% of women of reproductive age17. PCOS is defined
by hyperandrogenism with ovulatory dysfunction and/or
ovarian cysts (polycystic ovaries or PCO). The indepen-
dent association of prenatal androgens with PCOS sug-
gests predictions from the prenatal sex steroid theory of
autism: women with PCOS should have a higher rate of
autistic traits and a higher rate of autism among their
children.
Studies investigating the relationship between autism
and PCOS have fallen into two categories: those that
investigated steroidogenic traits in women with autism,
and those that investigated autistic traits in women with
PCOS. In the first category, self-report of reproductive
and sex-steroid-related symptoms suggests an increase of
these symptoms in women with autism15,16. Women with
autism also have increased levels of androstenedione (an
adrenal androgen)18, elevated levels of luteinizing hor-
mone (LH), and an increased free androgen index (FAI)
compared to typical controls19. In the second category,
women with PCOS score higher on measures of autistic
traits20, as do their daughters, but not their sons21. A
recent population study in Sweden found a significantly
increased risk of autism in children of mothers with
PCOS, which was exacerbated by comorbid maternal
metabolic syndrome22. Here, we contribute to both
approaches, presenting a comprehensive picture of autism
and PCOS association in women and their children using
the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) electronic
health record database.
Methods
Data source
Anonymized electronic medical records were obtained
from the UK-based primary care CPRD database, which
has been collecting anonymized patient data from the
NHS since 198823. These records contain detailed clinical
diagnoses for over 15 million patients in the UK, entered
and updated by each patient’s general practitioner (GP)
using the Read code system. Virtually all UK residents
have a registered GP, who serves not only as their primary
care physician but as a gatekeeper to National Health
Service (NHS) specialist care. As a result, GP records
provide a comprehensive clinical summary even when
diagnoses are made by specialists, and the CPRD dataset is
generally representative of the UK population. CPRD also
provides a Mother–Baby Link to match mothers and
children, which has been previously validated24,25. Ethical
approval was granted by the CPRD Independent Scientific
Advisory Committee (Protocol 14_224R).
Study design and population
Three separate matched case-control studies were
conducted. In Study 1, we examined the risk of PCOS in
women with autism compared to those without autism. In
Study 2, we examined the risk of autism in women with
PCOS compared to those without PCOS. In Study 3, we
examined the risk of autism in first-born children of
mothers with PCOS compared to first-born children of
mothers without PCOS; mothers of cases were drawn
from the cohort defined for Study 2.
The population was restricted to females registered in
the CPRD between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st,
2014, with at least 3 months CPRD medical history prior
to PCOS or autism diagnosis (to maximise data quality)
and aged 21 years or older at the end of the study period.
These characteristics, in addition to diagnoses of inclu-
sion, were specified to extract our case and control
populations for each study from the database. n = 971
women diagnosed with autism were included in Study 1.
n = 26,263 women with PCOS phenotype (discussed
below in section “Exposure, outcomes, and covariates”)
were included in Study 2. For Study 3, the CPRD
Mother–Baby Link was used to identify first-born chil-
dren from mothers included in the Study 2 PCOS popu-
lation (Fig. 1). The Study 3 population included n = 8,588
children of women with the PCOS phenotype in Study 2
who had first-born children linked in the database.
For Studies 1 and 2, we identified all matched controls
for each case based on year of birth and GP practice and
then randomly drew up to five or included all if fewer than
five were available (Fig. 1). Study 1 included 4,855 controls
and Study 2 included 130,717 controls. The same meth-
ods applied in Study 3, only controls were selected from

 children of mothers without a diagnosis of PCOS, and
were matched on gender, GP practice, and birth year
within 2 years of cases. Study 3 included 41,127 children
and their mothers (n = 41,127) as controls. We adjusted
for maternal age at childbirth in subsequent statistical
modelling.
Exposure, outcomes, and covariates
UK general practice records coded diagnostic informa-
tion using the Read code clinical system. PCOS was
defined by Read codes for polycystic ovarian syndrome
and Stein–Leventhal syndrome. We also included women
with codes consistent with the Rotterdam definition of
PCOS, despite absence of a formal PCOS diagnosis. This
PCOS phenotype thus included women with PCOS Read
codes, as well as women with a clinical code for PCO and
code for either hyperandrogenemia or menstrual irregu-
larities. Because test results are not always consistently
reported in the CPRD, we included any women with any
record of having a test of hyperandrogenemia, whether or
not it was abnormal. Patients with diagnoses of Cushing
syndrome, adrenogenital disorders, or congenital adrenal
hyperplasia were excluded. As secondary analyses, we
considered the three key diagnostic components of PCOS
(ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, PCO) sepa-
rately, and as part of the NIH diagnostic criteria (hyper-
androgenism plus ovulatory dysfunction), and Rotterdam
criteria (two out of three components) with the exclusion
of the
aforementioned
endocrine disorders.
In our
examination of these diagnostic components, our criteria
of hyperandrogenemia (and thus inclusion in NIH or
Rotterdam criteria) includes only women with abnormal
test results (see Supplementary materials).
Diagnosis of autism in both women and children was
based on revised Read code lists previously defined by
Smeeth et al.26. Previous studies have confirmed the
validity of CPRD autism diagnoses (where diagnosis of a
pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), was confirmed
in 92.5% of cases), and thus Read codes have good positive
predictive value for diagnosis26.
Diagnostic sub-categories of autism according to his-
torical diagnostic methods (e.g. Asperger’s syndrome,
PDD) were examined for Studies 1 and 2. The lifetime
rates and risk of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia-like
mental illness, diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2), obesity, as
well as PCOS characteristics, such as menstrual irregula-
rities, hyperandrogenemia, and PCO until the end of the
study period were also examined. In Study 3, the afore-
mentioned covariates, in addition to diagnoses of inferti-
lity, pre-eclampsia, and complications in childbirth for the
included child, and maternal gestational diabetes for the
included child were compared between mothers of cases
and controls. All covariates included were based on Read
code lists defined for this study (Supplementary materials).
Statistical analysis
Differences in case-control sample characteristic data
were tested with two-tailed independent sample t-test for
continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical
variables. The association of PCOS, autism, and covariates
was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals by conditional logistic regression. An
adjusted conditional regression model in Studies 1 and 2
included comorbid psychiatric conditions (lifetime history
of depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia-related illness).
In Study 3, two models were used in conditional logistic
regression analysis. Model 1 included adjustment for
maternal age at childbirth, depression, anxiety, and
schizophrenia-related illness. Model 2 additionally adjus-
ted for maternal lifetime diagnosis of obesity, diabetes,
complications during childbirth for the included child,
and gestational diabetes for the included child. G*Power
3.1 was used to determine covariate number to ascertain
power with our population size27. All statistical analyses
were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA) and RStudio Version 3.2.0 using the survival
package28,29.
Results
Study 1
A significantly higher percentage of women with autism
were diagnosed with PCOS than controls (Table 1).
Women with autism were also more likely to have any of
the three core clinical signs/symptoms of PCOS (Table 1).
Diabetes was more prevalent in the autism group com-
pared with controls, as were depression, anxiety, and
schizophrenia-related conditions (Supplementary Table
1). Adjustment for comorbid psychiatric conditions pre-
served the trend for increased odds of PCOS in women
with autism, although this was not significant in the PCOS
Read code population (Table 1).
Study 2
Autism was almost two times more prevalent in PCOS
cases (n = 26,263) than in controls (n = 130,717). Com-
pared with controls, PCOS cases also had an increased
prevalence of diabetes and obesity (Table 2). PCOS cases
were also more likely to have depression, anxiety, and
schizophrenia-related conditions, which persisted with
adjustment for comorbid psychiatric conditions (Table 2).
Adjustment for these psychiatric conditions in the model
attenuated the increased odds for autism in PCOS cases,
although the trend was still present.
10,201 of the cases had a diagnostic code for PCOS, and
rates of autism were significantly higher than for cases
with a PCOS phenotype (Supplementary Table 3). Rates
of ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism were
greater in cases with a PCOS phenotype than PCOS
diagnosis, although the age of diagnosis was significantly

 lower for PCOS cases (Supplementary Table 3). Although
no controls had a coded diagnosis of PCOS, a small
percentage of controls may have undiagnosed PCOS
(2.8–3% according to retrospective NIH and Rotterdam
criteria, Supplementary Table 4). Prevalence of diabetes
and the aforementioned psychiatric diagnoses were not
significantly different between those cases with and
without a diagnostic code for PCOS, although rates of
obesity were significantly lower (Supplementary Table 3).
Study 3
Of the 26,263 cases with a PCOS phenotype in the
Study 2 population, 8,588 mothers had first-born children
registered in the CPRD database that were included for
analysis. The prevalence of metabolic conditions, preg-
nancy complications, and psychiatric conditions used as
covariates in further models for analysis differed sig-
nificantly between cases and controls (Table 3). Mothers
with PCOS also had a significant increase in obesity and

 gestational diabetes compared to mothers with the PCOS
phenotype (Supplementary Table 5).
In the unadjusted model, mothers with PCOS had
higher odds of having a child with autism than did con-
trols (Table 4). Although the effect size was attenuated,
the association persisted when adjustment was made for
maternal age at childbirth, history of maternal depression
and anxiety, and in Model 2, additionally for endocrine-
related disorders including obesity, gestational diabetes,
and infertility. Finally, stratification into male and female
children did not reveal a significant difference in autism
risk (Table 4).
Discussion
This is the first study to our knowledge in the UK
examining the association of PCOS and autism, as well as
the first population-based study examining the prevalence
of PCOS in women with autism. We showed that in the
UK, women with autism have an approximately two-fold
increase in risk for PCOS, and women with PCOS also
had a two-fold increase in rates of autism. Finally, women
with PCOS had 35% increased odds of having a first-born
child with autism, after adjusting for comorbid maternal
psychiatric diagnosis, metabolic conditions, and compli-
cations in childbirth.
This study independently confirms a recent population
study in Sweden that found women with PCOS had 56%
increased odds of having a child with autism22. A previous
study by Palomba et al. found that autistic traits are
increased in children of women with PCOS and are sig-
nificant (p < 0.05) among daughters but not sons30.
However, like Kosidou et al., we also did not observe
increased risk in females, though our small sample size of
female cases warrants further study. Additional research
will be important, as gender difference in risk may inform
the aetiological model. Our study also confirms the results
of Cesta et al., who recently found increased odds
(unadjusted OR: 2.09 CI: 1.79–2.44, OR adjusted for
comorbid psychiatric conditions: 1.55 CI: 1.32–1.81) of
having autism in women with PCOS, although our
adjusted model did not achieve significance due to the
smaller sample size31.
Our findings indicate a common process may be con-
tributing to the development of autism and PCOS.
Increased steroidogenic activity is one key common
denominator.
The
association
with
prenatal
ster-
oidopathies and autism was discussed earlier as the
foundation of the prenatal sex steroid hypothesis. These
findings can be linked to biological mechanisms, as
structural influences of prenatal androgens and other
steroid hormones are extensive in the mammalian pre-
natal brain and several morphological differences have
been correlated with prenatal sex steroid influences32–34.
At the cellular level, sex steroids act on a variety of
developmental processes including selective cell death35,
synaptogenesis
and
synaptic
recruitment36,
axon
growth37, neurogenesis, and the pruning of synaptic
spines38. Prenatal steroid hormones also have extensive
epigenetic effects on a wide range of genes that may lead
to the long-lasting organisational effects of prenatal sex
steroids39.
Foetal exposure to high levels of androgens in utero is
also sufficient to trigger the epigenetic, developmental,
and physiological hallmarks of PCOS in animal mod-
els40,41. In humans, both foetal and maternal androgen
excess has been implicated in PCOS42–44, and daughters
of women with PCOS have significantly increased pre-
pubertal hyperinsulinemia and biochemical hyperan-
drogenism in late puberty45. Women with PCOS also had
even
greater
hyperandrogenemia
during
pregnancy,
especially in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters46–48. Placentas of
women
with PCOS showed increased
steroidogenic
activity and decreased p450 aromatase activity, which is
responsible for the breakdown of androgens, suggesting a
mechanism of androgen accumulation47. Thus, women
with PCOS may have higher levels of androgens in
pregnancy, and prenatal androgens are implicated in the
development of PCOS.
Steroid dysregulation leading to hyperandrogenism in
both disorders is likely due to genetic, epigenetic, and

 environmental causes acting in concert. A genetic com-
ponent may underlie our observed association between
autism and PCOS. However, this genetic component
likely still involves steroidogenesis, as several overlapping
genes associated with both PCOS and autism have been
associated with steroid synthesis. CYP19A, for instance,
involved in aromatising testosterone to estradiol has been
associated with PCOS pathogenesis49 and risk50,51; it has
also been associated with autism52. A similar enzyme,
CYP17A, involved in key catalytic steps in androstene-
dione synthesis has been consistently implicated in theca
cell androgen overproduction, a key feature of PCOS and
has been associated with autism risk52.
Hyperinsulinemia is a factor closely related to increased
steroidogenic activity. Our work shows 3.5-fold and 3.9-
fold increased odds of developing diabetes mellitus (type 1
and 2) in women with autism and PCOS, respectively,
suggesting a close association of both with insulin and
insulin resistance. Insulin plays a significant role in the
pathogenesis
of
PCOS,
maintenance
of
hyperan-
drogenemia, and abnormal placental and foetal ster-
oidogenesis50. Chronic foetal exposure to elevated glucose
will result in hyperinsulinemia and downstream hormonal
effects including foetal hyperandrogenemia53,54. The pla-
cental aromatase-deficiency in PCOS described earlier
may also be further exacerbated by gestational diabetes
and hyperinsulinemia55, which are more common in
women with PCOS56,57. If placental aromatase is com-
promised, maternal testosterone may be able to cross the
placenta55. Examining the association of maternal gesta-
tional diabetes and autism is an important target for
future research.
We also demonstrated an association between obesity
and both autism and PCOS. Obesity has been linked to
PCOS outcomes, and overweight and obese women have
greater rates of hyperandrogenemia, likely resulting from
obesity-induced
hyperinsulinemia58.
Hyperinsulinemia
stimulates ovarian androgen production and decreases
sex-hormone-binding globulin. Obesity may also specifi-
cally exacerbate sex-steroid dysregulation during preg-
nancy in women with PCOS. High triglycerides and low
adiponectin have been associated with hyperinsulinemia
during pregnancy59. Another study found significantly
increased odds of obese mothers having a child with
autism49, while Kosidou et al. demonstrated an increasing
trend in autism risk with severity of maternal metabolic
condition and obesity22. Although it is particularly diffi-
cult to tease apart obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyper-
androgenemia, given they are so intricately intertwined,
the association of all three with both autism and PCOS
increases the likelihood of a related mechanism.
Our findings may indicate that severity of PCOS is also
associated with greater risk for autism in women. We
found a significant increase in prevalence and decreasing
trend for age of autism diagnosis in our PCOS case group
defined uniquely by PCOS Read codes, compared to the
PCOS phenotype group that included cases additionally
diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria. We observed a sig-
nificantly
decreased
age
of
diagnosis
of
hyperan-
drogenemia, menstrual irregularities, and obesity, all of
which contribute to PCOS severity. Furthermore, women
who do not seek treatment for PCOS may not receive a
diagnosis and be documented in the CPRD. As a result,
symptom severity may contribute to increased risk of
autism. Future research should examine the correlation
between risk of autism and the severity of hyperan-
drogenemia in women with PCOS.
In conclusion, here, we explain our results in light of the
hypothesis that prenatal hyperandrogenism and steroid
dysregulation are key players in the development of both
autism and PCOS. Since the symptoms of PCOS include
hyperandrogenemia in pregnancy, PCOS itself is sufficient
to trigger pathways involved in the development of aut-
ism. According to this hypothesis then, we also observe
PCOS and steroidopathies in women with autism, because
PCOS and metabolic dysregulation are related to prenatal
steroid excess. The cause of this prenatal steroid excess
may be genetic or may involve a positive feedback loop
with maternal hyperinsulinemia or hyperandrogenemia.
Future studies examining the quantitative association
between
biochemical
hyperandrogenism,
hyper-
insulinemia, and autism, and whether hyperandrogenism
is foetal, maternal, or placental, will be important avenues
for future research.
This study also found that women with both autism and
PCOS were at risk for a range of other psychiatric con-
ditions. It has been shown that 70% of children with
autism were diagnosed with another psychiatric disorder,
including depression and anxiety disorders60,61. Our study
confirms these findings, as we find significantly increased
odds of anxiety, depression, as well as schizophrenia-
related mental illness in women with autism.
Women with PCOS were also at risk for other psy-
chiatric conditions. Rates of depression and anxiety were
elevated in women with PCOS (33.1% and 21.4%, vs.
17.0% and 10.6% in controls, respectively). Other studies
have found similar associations between PCOS and
depression and anxiety62–65, and report that 40% of
women with PCOS experienced clinical depression64, and
34% of women with PCOS were diagnosed with anxiety62.
Our observed prevalence was higher than that found in
the Swedish population (16.4% vs. 11.1% in PCOS cases
vs. controls)31. This difference may be due to different
medical code lists and definitions, as we included, for
instance, bipolar and unipolar depression in one category.
Interestingly, they associated increased prevalence of
psychiatric
conditions
with
hyperandrogenemia,

 unaffected siblings, suggesting the association may not
only be caused by the stresses of having PCOS31. Never-
theless, the role of androgens in depression remains
controversial, and several other studies have failed to find
an association beyond a psychological one66,67. The
underlying mechanisms for prevalence of mood disorders
in women with PCOS has yet to be elucidated.
Although we present a comprehensive association
between PCOS and autism diagnoses in women and their
children, we acknowledge limitations of this study. Only
first-born children of women with PCOS were included to
ascertain independence. As studies have shown decreased
prevalence of autism in first-born children68, this may be
one reason we underestimate the rates of autism in chil-
dren in the general population. As a result of missing
information recorded in the CPRD, we did not control for
marital status, alcohol-use, specific hormone or infertility
treatments, and socioeconomic background (i.e. income,
education, occupation). Furthermore, the Mother–Baby
Link lacked information regarding possible paternal
influences, including age or psychiatric history. Finally,
the Mother–Baby Link requires continuous registration
with GPs, which may limit how many children are avail-
able for follow-up for autism diagnosis and may bias
results towards earlier diagnoses.
The relatively low proportion of women diagnosed with
PCOS in our study is also surprising, considering pre-
valence of PCOS has been estimated at 6–10% according
to NIH criteria, and almost 20% according to Rotterdam
criteria69. As discussed previously, this may be due to
reporting based on symptom severity but may also be due
to underreporting in primary care centres. Previous stu-
dies in the UK CPRD population have found comparable
rates of PCOS as we do for our PCOS-phenotype, though
our prevalence of PCOS alone is lower, most likely
because these studies include PCO alone in their diag-
nostic criteria for PCOS70,71. Cesta et al. also report the
mean age at first PCOS diagnosis in Sweden is around
28.0 ± 6.8 years, which is comparable to our own obser-
vation (Table 2, 27.6 ± 7.5 years)31. In addition, the pre-
valence of autism in our control female population
(0.09%) was lower than that documented in the UK
(0.20%)72. Again, this may be due to decreased recording
of psychiatric conditions by primary care physicians, since
these conditions are usually diagnosed by specialists.
Another explanation may be that the majority of the
women in our population were born before improved
diagnostic criteria and screening for autism of the last 20
years, as well as before Asperger’s syndrome was included
in the DSM in 1994, which allowed diagnoses to include
milder cases of autism (Supplementary Figure 1, Supple-
mentary Table 2). Before the 1980s, the prevalence of
autism was 3.3 out of 10,00073, and only began to sig-
nificantly increase in the 1990s. This may also explain the
increased age of autism diagnosis in women in our study
population, as GPs may now diagnose women who may
not have met past diagnostic criteria (Supplementary
Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, girls also
tend to be clinically identified later than boys, even with
current diagnostic standards74. Finally, although none of
our controls had a formal PCOS diagnosis, 2.8–3.0%
positively qualified for PCOS under NIH or Rotterdam
criteria, which also supports the presence of an undiag-
nosed PCOS population. These false negatives, while
potentially attenuating the associations we observe, also
increase the likelihood that the statistically significant
associations we do find are real.
Conclusion
This study finds an association between PCOS and
autism, which raises the question of whether early treat-
ments or surveillance might be considered for one con-
dition
given
the
presence
of
the
other.
Metabolic
conditions associated with PCOS can be reversed if
caught early, and the social deficits in autism can be
reduced
with
early
psychological
intervention
pro-
grammes75. Using elevated androgens as well as increased
markers of hyperinsulinemia or metabolic disturbances in
women with PCOS could, for example, lead to improved
screening tools and increased awareness to help identify
children with autism earlier. Likewise, assessing risks for
metabolic conditions in women with autism may also
prevent the development of adverse metabolic outcomes,
such as obesity, diabetes, and other complications of
PCOS. Of course, the risks of discussing autism associated
with PCOS should be carefully weighed to prevent addi-
tional stress. We would also underline that our study
suggests that autism in children of women with PCOS is
still very rare, so the chance of having a child with autism
should not be overstated. The association of PCOS and
autism therefore may inform new clinical interventions
for both disorders.
