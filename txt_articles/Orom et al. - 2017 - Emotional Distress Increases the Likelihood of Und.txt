Abstract
Purpose—To determine if, among men with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa), and in 
particular, men with low risk disease, greater emotional distress increases the likelihood of 
receiving surgery over radiation or active surveillance.
Materials and Methods—Participants were 1531 patients recruited from 2 academic and 3 
community facilities (83% non-Hispanic white, 11% non-Hispanic black, 6% Hispanic; 36% low 
risk, 49% intermediate risk, 15% high risk; 24% chose active surveillance, 27% chose radiation, 
48% chose surgery). Emotional distress was assessed shortly after diagnosis and after men made 
the treatment decision with the Distress Thermometer. We used multinomial logistic regression 
with robust standard errors to test if emotional distress at either time point predicted treatment 
choice in the sample as a whole and after stratifying by D’Amico risk score.
Results and Conclusions—In the sample as a whole, participants who were more emotionally 
distressed at diagnosis were more likely to choose surgery over active surveillance (RRR=1.07, 
95% CI=1.01, 1.14, p=.02). Men who were more distressed close to the time they made their 
treatment choice were more likely to have chosen surgery over active surveillance (RRR = 1.16, 
95% CI = 1.09, 1.24, p<.001) or surgery over radiation (RRR=1.12, 95% CI=1.05, 1.19, p=.001). 
This pattern was also found among men with low risk disease. Emotional distress may motivate 
men with low risk PCa to choose more aggressive treatment. Addressing emotional distress prior 
to, and during treatment decision-making may reduce a barrier to uptake of active surveillance.

 Introduction
Overtreatment of prostate cancer (PCa), has become a significant concern in PCa care. 
Estimates of the magnitude of overtreatment vary widely, but nearly all studies point to some 
degree of unnecessary treatment,1 in particular, among men with low risk disease which has 
a very low mortality risk.2 For men with low risk disease, active surveillance or periodic 
monitoring for cancer progression with the potential for conversion to definitive therapy 
such as surgery or radiation is often a viable course of management.2,3 Research on the 
under-utilization of active surveillance has focused on patients’ clinical characteristics such 
as age and comorbid disease4 and to some degree their beliefs and preferences.5,6 However, 
it is well established that emotions also drive patient decision-making, including cancer-
related decision-making.7 Understanding the role of emotion in PCa treatment decision 
making has the potential to reveal new approaches to helping men make treatment decisions 
that are informed by an understanding of treatment options, outcomes, and side-effects, and 
their preferences and values. The goal of the present work is to examine whether PCa 
patients who are more emotionally distressed after diagnosis choose surgery over radiation 
or active surveillance.
A number of patient beliefs are associated with choosing more aggressive treatment. Men 
who are concerned about cancer progression and give importance to tumor removal are more 
likely to choose surgery8,9 and more likely to convert to definitive therapy if on active 
surveillance.10 A desire to take action in the face of the cancer threat may also motivate 
choosing definitive therapy.11 Among definitive therapies, surgery may be viewed as the 
most aggressive by many patients who reason that radiation offers adequate cancer control 
with fewer side effects.8
We know that many men, by most estimates a quarter to a third of men, experience 
significant distress when diagnosed with PCa.12–14 As there are effective interventions for 
emotional distress in cancer patients,15 there is considerable utility in testing whether patient 
distress is partially driving overtreatment of low risk PCa. In one study, distress during 
decision-making was associated with having chosen surgery over radiation or active 
surveillance;9 however, we do not know whether emotional distress at diagnosis predicts 
choosing surgery. This study addresses this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that 
emotional distress at diagnosis and emotional distress soon after treatment decision making 
would be associated with higher likelihood of choosing surgery over radiation or active 
surveillance. We tested these hypotheses both in the sample as a whole, and, of particular 
interest, in men with low risk disease. If early emotional distress influences treatment 
choice, it might be possible to intervene shortly after diagnosis and improve the quality of 
the treatment-decision making process as well as patients’ quality of life.
Methods
Procedure
Data were from the Live Well Live Long! study of PCa treatment decision making and 
survivorship.16 Participants with newly diagnosed clinically localized PCa were approached 
at two comprehensive cancer centers and three community facilities between July 2010 and 
Orom et al.

 August 2014. Of the 3337 patients approached to participate, 2,476 were consented; 2,008 
completed the first survey. Data for the present analyses were from this first survey 
completed upon consent, a second survey completed after participants had made their 
treatment decision but prior to treatment, and were abstracted from participants’ medical 
records. In total, 1631 completed both surveys and had medical record data. Twenty-three 
participants who reported a race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic 
white, and Hispanic were not included due to the small size of this group. Data were also 
excluded for participants (n = 77) who had missing observations for any of the model 
covariates (D’Amico risk, comorbidities, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, 
employment status, age at diagnosis, recruiting site), yielding a final sample of 1531. Study 
procedures were institutional review board-approved and participants completed a written 
informed consent.
Measures
We measured emotional distress with the Distress Thermometer, an 11-point single-item 
visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress) shortly after consent 
(baseline) and again as soon as participants had made their treatment decision. The Distress 
Thermometer has been validated and is a recommended distress screening tool for use in 
PCa patients,17–20 with good specificity and sensitivity for detecting cancer-specific 
distress.18
We stratified participants’ disease risk by D’Amico risk score, a widely used system for 
categorizing PCa disease risk.21 To calculate the scores we abstracted clinical stage, pre-
treatment biopsy Gleason score, and pre-treatment PSA from participants’ medical records. 
Low-risk PCa was defined as PSA ≤10 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤6, and American Joint 
Commission of Cancer Staging (AJCC) less than cT2b.22 Intermediate-risk PCa was defined 
as PSA >10 and ≤20 ng/mL or Gleason 7 disease or AJCC cT2b. High-risk disease was 
defined as PSA >20 ng/mL or Gleason 8–10 disease or AJCC cT2c or higher.22
We assessed several potential comorbidities. Whether participants had diagnoses of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, congestive 
heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease), diabetes, or hypertension 
was abstracted from patients’ medical histories. For 122 participants, whether they had 
coronary artery disease was not abstracted. These cases were coded as having coronary 
artery disease if they self-reported the condition at baseline.
We assessed self-reported years of education, household income, race/ethnicity, marital 
status, employment status (employed vs. not employed), and date of birth, from which age at 
diagnosis was calculated. Recruiting site was recorded by participant recruiters. All 
assessments were made at baseline.
We assessed men’s confidence in cancer control or beliefs that their cancer would not 
progress with the cancer control subscale of Clark and colleagues’ 23 multidimensional PCa 
quality of life scale. Two items were slightly adapted to be more appropriate for patients 
who have not yet been treated. Participants responded to five statements using a 5-point 
Likert-type response format (1=strongly agree, 5=strongly disagree) (α=0.75). Example

 items included, ‘I am confident that the cancer will be brought under control,’ and, ‘I worry 
about the cancer spreading’.
Data Analyses
We used multinomial logistic regression to test whether distress at diagnosis or after having 
made the treatment decision was associated with greater likelihood of choosing surgery over 
radiation or active surveillance. We tested models for both baseline and treatment decision-
making distress in both the full sample and after stratifying by disease risk (D’Amico score). 
We controlled for disease risk except when it was a stratification variable. We also controlled 
for comorbidities that can contraindicate surgery (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
hypertension), as well as for demographic variables potentially associated with differences 
in type of treatment received (education, race/ethnicity, employment status, marital status, 
and age). We controlled for recruiting site, although this variable is not included in the tables 
as the choice of referent site is arbitrary. We also repeated all analyses after adding a 
measure of confidence in cancer control to verify that associations between distress and type 
of treatment received were not due solely to concern about the cancer progressing. Shared 
recruiting site introduced non-independence into the data; therefore, we used robust standard 
errors in all models so that if the correlation structure was not correctly specified, the 
standard errors would still be valid.
Results
Participant characteristics
Most participants had low risk (35.7%) or intermediate (49.1%), rather than high risk disease 
(15.2%). They were most likely to have been treated with surgery (48.4%), followed by 
radiation (27.4%) and active surveillance (24.2%). Men’s mean emotional distress at 
baseline was 4.37 (SD = 2.56) out of 10 and was somewhat reduced after they had made 
their treatment decision (M = 4.10, SD = 2.58) (t(1462) = 5.36 p< .001). Distress and 
confidence in cancer control were negatively associated both at baseline (r = −0.38, p< .001) 
and soon after having made the treatment decision (r = −0.34, p< .001). Participant 
characteristics are described in detail in Table 1.
Multivariable analyses
The overall pattern of associations between distress and treatment choice were similar for 
distress shortly after diagnosis and after treatment decision making, although associations 
were stronger for the latter. Distress shortly after diagnosis predicted choosing surgery over 
active surveillance (RRR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.14, p= .021) (Table 2). Distress shortly 
after the treatment decision was associated with having chosen surgery over active 
surveillance (RRR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.24, p< .001) and surgery over radiation (RRR = 
1.12, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.19, p= .001) (Table 3). In the group of primary interest, men with 
low risk disease, distress shortly after diagnosis was associated with choosing surgery over 
active surveillance (RRR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.22, p= .019) (Table 1, Supplemental 
Material). Distress at treatment decision was associated with choosing surgery over active 
surveillance (RRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.34, p< .001) and surgery over radiation (RRR = 
1.25, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.45, p= .002) (Table 2, Supplemental Material). In men with

 intermediate risk disease, distress at decision-making but not distress shortly after diagnosis 
was associated with greater likelihood of choosing surgery over active surveillance (RRR = 
1.15, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.28, p= .014) and surgery over radiation (RRR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.00, 
1.19, p= .05) (not shown in tables). In men with high risk disease, distress was not 
associated with treatment choice (not shown in tables). Findings were also replicated, and in 
fact strengthened when we controlled for confidence in cancer control (Tables 3 and 4, 
Supplemental Materials).
Other determinants of treatment choice
The pattern of associations between covariates and treatment choice were nearly identical 
for models that included distress at baseline (Table 2) or distress just after decision-making 
(Table 3). Having higher risk disease was associated with choosing surgery or radiation over 
active surveillance and having CVD with lower likelihood of choosing surgery over active 
surveillance or radiation and higher likelihood of choosing radiation over active surveillance. 
Being more educated was associated with lower likelihood of choosing surgery or radiation 
over active surveillance. Being Black, compared to white, was associated with higher 
likelihood of choosing radiation over active surveillance or surgery. Being married was 
associated with higher likelihood of choosing surgery over active surveillance and in the 
distress at decision-making model, greater likelihood of choosing surgery over radiation. 
Being older was associated with lower likelihood of choosing surgery over active 
surveillance or radiation.
Discussion
Men’s level of emotional distress shortly after diagnosis predicted greater likelihood of 
choosing surgery over active surveillance. Importantly, this was true among men with low 
risk disease, for whom active surveillance may be a clinically viable option and side-effects 
of surgery or radiation might be unnecessary. Distress was slightly lower after men had 
made their treatment decision, but it remained a predictor of having chosen surgery over 
active surveillance and surgery over radiation in the sample as a whole and in men with low 
risk disease. A number of studies have shown that emotional distress is relatively high 
among newly diagnosed men,12,16,24 but our study is novel as it demonstrates both 
prospectively and cross-sectionally that emotional distress motivates PCa patients to choose 
more aggressive treatment.
It is well-established that key reasons men choose surgery is believing that PCa is a serious 
disease9 and surgery is their best option for cancer control.8,9,25 Fear of cancer progression 
and death is likely one source of distress among PCa patients, and may partially account for 
the relationship between distress and choosing surgery over other treatment modalities. 
Indeed, in our sample, confidence in cancer control was inversely associated with emotional 
distress, and was uniquely associated with choosing surgery over active surveillance and 
radiation; it seems that the men considering or who chose surgery were more confident that 
their cancer would be cured. It is also true that distress predicted choosing surgery even 
when controlling for confidence in cancer control. We previously reported that low self-
efficacy for decision-making, low confidence in cancer control, and masculine identity threat

 are also associated with distress at diagnosis, and dispositional optimism and resilience 
protected against distress.16 Intervening in any of these determinants of early distress might 
therefore have the additional benefit of reducing overtreatment.
Patterns of associations between demographic characteristics and treatment choice were 
consistent with other reports in the literature. For example, younger PCa patients (i.e., longer 
life expectancy) are more likely to receive aggressive treatment than older patients.4,8 
Married men also choose more aggressive treatment.26,27 Family roles and partners’ social 
influence may lead partnered men to choose a treatment that they believe will maximize 
their chance of cure and longevity.28 In contrast, some unmarried men may place relatively 
greater value on sexual function and avoid surgery because they believe it poses the greatest 
threat of erectile dysfunction. In our sample and nationally, Blacks are disproportionately 
more likely to receive radiation; however, unlike in national samples, participants did not 
receive surgery at a lower rate compared to whites.29 As CVD can be a contra-indication for 
surgery it is not surprising that it was associated with lower likelihood of choosing surgery. 
However, in our sample, having CVD was counterintuitively associated with greater 
likelihood of choosing radiation over active surveillance. One would have expected 
significant comorbidity to be associated with lower projected life expectancy and lower 
likelihood of receiving definitive therapy..
Our study had a number of limitations; our sample is not nationally representative of all men 
diagnosed with clinically localized disease and had relatively high mean socioeconomic 
status. We may have underestimated the effect of distress on choosing aggressive treatment 
if men who were more emotionally distressed were less likely to participate. The Distress 
Thermometer is a widely used screening tool for psychological distress; however, it is a 
single item with associated potential for measurement error. Future research might replicate 
this study using a multidimensional scale such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS). We might also test whether knowing patients’ history of affective disorders could 
help screen for individuals who will choose aggressive therapy due to emotional distress. 
Future work might also examine if partners’ distress motivates uptake of aggressive 
treatment.
Conclusions
Emotional distress prior to treatment decision-making is not only a concern with respect to 
patients’ psychosocial well-being; it may impact the treatment decision-making process, 
motivating men to choose surgery over other treatments. Significantly, we found this pattern 
to be true among men with low risk disease who might be good candidates for active 
surveillance. Effects may be direct through men’s preferences (i.e., more distressed men 
prefer the best chance of cure), or indirect if physicians recommend more aggressive 
treatment to men who are more anxious about cancer control.30 In both instances, early 
interventions to reduce distress (e.g., additional explanation about PCa prognosis, decision 
aids, brief cognitive behavioral therapy, use of relaxation or mindfulness apps) may benefit 
both the treatment decision-making process and patients’ psychosocial well-being. Our 
findings support recent trends in promoting screening for emotional distress, but highlight 
the value of doing so early on, prior to men making their treatment decisions. Early work on

 treatment choice primarily focused on cognitive determinants such as physician 
recommendations, beliefs, preferences, and the influence of anecdotal information.8,9,25 Our 
study, and recently work on the role of fear of treatment and side-effects indicates the 
importance of emotional processes in men’s PCa treatment decisions.
