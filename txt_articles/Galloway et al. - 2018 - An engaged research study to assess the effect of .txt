AbstrACt
Objective Bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with 
adverse human health outcomes and exposure to this 
compound is near-ubiquitous in the Western world. 
We aimed to examine whether self-moderation of BPA 
exposure is possible by altering diet in a real-world setting.
Design An Engaged Research dietary intervention study 
designed, implemented and analysed by healthy teenagers 
from six schools and undertaken in their own homes.
Participants A total of 94 students aged between 17 
and 19 years from schools in the South West of the UK 
provided diet diaries and urine samples for analysis.
Intervention Researcher participants designed a set of 
literature-informed guidelines for the reduction of dietary 
BPA to be followed for 7 days.
Main outcome measures Creatinine-adjusted urinary 
BPA levels were taken before and after the intervention. 
Information on packaging and food/drink ingested 
was used to calculate a BPA risk score for anticipated 
exposure. A qualitative analysis was carried out to identify 
themes addressing long-term sustainability of the diet.
results BPA was detected in urine of 86% of participants 
at baseline at a median value of 1.22 ng/mL (IQR 1.99). No 
effect of the intervention diet on BPA levels was identified 
overall (P=0.25), but there was a positive association 
in those participants who showed a drop in urinary BPA 
concentration postintervention and their initial BPA level 
(P=0.003). Qualitative analysis identified themes around 
feelings of lifestyle restriction and the inadequacy of 
current labelling practices.
Conclusions We found no evidence in this self-
administered intervention study that it was possible to 
moderate BPA exposure by diet in a real-world setting. 
Furthermore, our study participants indicated that they 
would be unlikely to sustain such a diet long term, due to 
the difficulty in identifying BPA-free foods.
IntrODuCtIOn 
Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the world’s 
highest production volume chemicals. It is 
used in the manufacture of polycarbonate 
and other plastic consumer products, in 
heat-resistant papers, dental sealants and in 
the epoxy resin-based lining of food and drink 
containers.1 BPA can be found above the 
detection limit in the urine of the majority of 
people worldwide.2 Concern has been raised 
for public health, since BPA is classified as an 
endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) which 
has been linked with several disorders in cell 
and animal models.3–5 Several epidemiolog-
ical studies have also linked outcomes such as 
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity 
and abnormalities of sex hormone levels with 
BPA levels in human populations6–10 Epide-
miological data in humans has historically 
been more contentious, however, due to rela-
tively small sample sizes and issues around 
causality.11 The Endocrine Society concluded 
in 2015 that current evidence suggests that 
BPA and other EDCs may have effects on 
several reproductive, cardiovascular and 
metabolic traits in humans.12 The current 
opinion of food regulatory bodies such as the 
European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) 
is that sufficient uncertainty remains to be 
able to exclude effects on the reproductive, 
immune, nervous, metabolic and cardiovas-
cular systems and on cancer development,3 
while the European Chemicals Agency has 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This study represents the largest assessment to date 
of the potential for moderating one’s own bisphenol 
A (BPA) exposure through diet.
 
► The study was carried out in a ‘real-world’ setting 
rather than a regulated, controlled environment.
 
► The study was carried out in teenagers, the 
demographic with among the highest exposure.
 
► Qualitative analysis reveals challenges with 
sustaining such a diet.
 
► Calculation of a risk score is challenging due to the 
pervasive nature of BPA contamination.

recently reclassified BPA as a chemical of very high 
concern due to its endocrine-disrupting properties.13 
There has been wide interest in the sources of BPA and 
the potential for individuals to reduce their own expo-
sure. Human exposure has been reported from inhala-
tion of dust, uptake across the skin from thermal papers 
and till receipts and release from dental sealants. The 
main source is the ingestion of food and drink contam-
inated with BPA leached from packaging materials.1 14 
BPA is rapidly metabolised in the gut wall and liver and 
removed from the blood by the kidneys, with a terminal 
half-life of 6 hours after oral ingestion.15 BPA has been 
detected in food samples packaged in glass, plastic, 
paper and paperboard cartons, with an average concen-
tration of 0.46 ng/g, rising to over 700 ng/g for certain 
canned foods. Conversely, in a dietary intervention study 
in which 22 volunteers consumed a 3-day fresh food diet 
which excluded canned or packaged foods, there was a 
66% reduction in urinary BPA excretion compared with 
concentrations before the intervention.16 This latter 
study involved full dietary replacement of foodstuffs, an 
approach which is impractical for the population at large. 
A follow-up study found that households who followed 
written recommendations produced by healthcare 
professionals showed no significant change in their BPA 
exposure.17
We present an alternative, citizen science-based 
approach, where 108 student volunteers designed and 
undertook their own intervention diet, following provi-
sion of educational materials. We questioned whether 
adherence to a self-designed and self-administered ‘real-
world’ diet over 7 days would lead to significant reduc-
tions in excreted urinary BPA, and if so, whether such a 
diet was likely to be sustainable in the long term.
MethODs
Participant group
We chose adolescents because it has been shown that they 
have higher concentrations of BPA than adults (aggre-
gated exposure of 1.449 µg/kg body weight per day).3 18 A 
total of 108 students aged 17–19 from local schools were 
initially invited to participate in this engaged research 
project. Six schools participated in this project (Clyst Vale 
Community College—14 students; Exeter School—12 
students; South Dartmoor Community College—13 
students; Honiton Community College—11 students; 
Exeter College—29 students and Exeter Mathematics 
School—29 students). Information and samples were 
available from 94 individuals at both visit 1 and visit 2 
and comprise the complete dataset. This represents the 
largest intervention study in the population demographic 
with the one of the highest BPA exposures to date.18 The 
number of students invited to participate was based on 
anticipated effect sizes from previous work of this nature,16 
and we allowed for a 10% dropout rate. Students designed 
all of the materials required for completion of the study 
(study protocols, food diaries, lifestyle questionnaires, 
patient information sheets and consent forms (see online 
supplementary information files 1–6).
Intervention diet
Students designed a ‘real-world’ diet designed to reduce 
consumption of BPA by avoidance of processed foods 
and foods packaged in known sources of BPA1 14; online 
supplementary information file 1. The study was designed 
at the University of Exeter as a collaboration between 
academic staff and participating students and was devel-
oped at a series of interactive workshops attended by all 
parties.
Students were asked to minimise their intake of known 
sources of BPA according to a set of guidelines that had 
been codesigned with them based on the known litera-
ture. We requested that calorific intake was maintained 
as near to their usual diet as possible and recorded 
details of their daily diet including all food and drink, 
and its associated packaging, in a self-reported food diary 
(online supplementary information file 2). Adherence 
was assessed using a ‘BPA risk score’; each individual 
dietary item potentially containing BPA was given a score 
of 1. Heavily processed items were also scored 1 per item. 
These scores were collated at the end of the 7-day trial to 
give a final risk score. An example of scores for a single 
participant on a single day is given in online supplemen-
tary information file 3. Given the short half-life of BPA, 
we also carried out a secondary analysis considering 
only the BPA risk score from the 24 hours immediately 
preceding the second sample. Information on lifestyle 
factors including sex, body mass index (BMI) and time of 
urine collection was also collected (online supplementary 
information file 4). We recognised that there may be a 
temptation for students to change their diets before the 
trial based on their new learning. To avoid this, students 
were also specifically asked not alter their diet before the 
intervention.
sample collection and measurement of urinary bPA
Urine samples were collected into BPA-free bottles 
(Vacutest Kima, Italy) immediately before and after the 
intervention, and were frozen at −20°C within 4 hours. 
Each participant was sampled two times, once at visit 
1 before the intervention and once at visit 2 after the 
intervention. Sample collections were staggered to allow 
for the large number of participants passing through 
the facility, but students were sampled during the same 
time slot at both visits to account for circadian variation 
in BPA metabolism. The initial samples were collected 
during the early part of the day just prior to the students 
commencing the trial. The second samples were taken 
over the same time period 7 days later, just prior to the 
students recommencing their usual diet. Samples were 
transported on dry ice to a commercial laboratory (Roval-
tain Research Company, Aixain, France) where analysis 
of total BPA was assessed by gas chromatography–tandem 
mass spectrometry. Experimental methods were validated 
for linearity, detection limit and accuracy and specificity

of quantification based on the Standard NF T 90–201 for 
determination of xenobiotics. A quality control check of 
known standards injected every six samples at two levels of 
concentration (0.5 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL) was quantified 
with each batch of unknown samples. Water-only samples 
were included as negative controls. Urinary creatinine was 
measured at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital using 
the Jaffe method on the Roche P800 platform (Roche, 
Mannheim, Germany), to allow correction for urine 
dilution. Results were expressed as a BPA to creatinine 
ratio. Samples where BPA was detected but quantifying at 
or around the limits of quantification (LoQ) of 0.1 ng/
mL were scored as LoQ/√2 according to the method of 
Hornung and Reed.19
statistical analysis
The difference between urinary BPA adjusted for creati-
nine between samples taken at visits 1 and 2 was assessed 
to generate a ΔBPA continuous variable. BPA risk scores 
were calculated as a continuous variable. The relation-
ship between urinary BPA levels before and after the 
7-day intervention was assessed using a repeated-measure 
analysis of variance, adjusted for sex, time of sampling 
and BMI, with and without correction for creatinine. The 
relationship between urinary BPA at visit 1 and whether 
or not the participants had lower BPA at visit 2 was also 
examined by binary logistic regression, adjusted for sex, 
time of sampling and BMI. Here, samples showing small 
changes <0.5 ng/mL in either direction were omitted to 
avoid natural stoichiometric variation around zero. The 
relationship between change in BPA (ΔBPA) and BPA risk 
score was assessed by linear regression, adjusted for sex, 
time of sampling and BMI both with and without adjust-
ment for creatinine. Statistical analysis was carried out 
using SPSS V.22.
Impact of following reduced bPA diet on lifestyle
We carried out quantitative and qualitative analysis to 
address long-term sustainability of the diet. Data on the 
impact of following the diet on feelings of dietary restric-
tion, time spent sourcing or preparing meals, calorific 
intake and long-term sustainability were collected via a 
questionnaire (see online supplementary information file 
4). The questionnaire also included a freeform section 
where participants could write about their experiences 
following the diet in a non-prescribed fashion for quali-
tative analysis. Qualitative data were assessed for thematic 
content by two experienced qualitative researchers. Key 
themes were independently identified and coded until 
agreement was reached.

Participant characteristics
There were 108 volunteer participants invited to partici-
pate in this engaged research study. A small number were 
absent or unable to produce a urine sample at both visits. 
A complete dataset was thus received from 94 students. 
Information on the characteristics of the study cohort is 
given in table 1.
BPA was detected in the urine of 86% of subjects at visit 
1 prior to the intervention. Missing samples were due 
to non-attendance of participants or non-provision of a 
suitable sample. Samples below the LoQ were scored as 
0.07 ng/mL (LoQ/√2).
Creatine-adjusted urinary bPA concentrations did not change 
significantly after following the intervention diet
The median change in creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA 
between visits (ΔBPA) was 0.05 ng/mL with an IQR of 
2.94 ng/mL. We identified no changes in urinary BPA 
between visits (P=0.25; figure 1A). Three outliers with 
very high urinary BPA readings at visit 2 were excluded 
from the analysis, since these samples lay outside the 
linear range of analysis, so confidence in quantification 
was poor. No confounding factors included in the analysis 
were associated with change in BPA (P=0.78, 0.43 and 0.36 
for sex, time of sample collection and BMI, respectively). 
We also identified no change in BPA levels between visits 
using data uncorrected for creatinine (P=0.20). We also 
assessed whether participants from different schools 
showed variable BPA levels at either visit 1 or change in 
BPA, but no such effects were noted.
Similarly, no relationship between change in urinary 
BPA (ΔBPA) and BPA risk score was identified (beta coef-
ficient 0.08, SE 0.07, P=0.55; figure 1B). No associations 
were noted between change in urinary BPA and BPA risk 
score in data not adjusted for creatinine (P=0.27). We 
found no association between ΔBPA and BPA risk score 
when considering only the exposure on the day prior 
to testing, taking into account the short half-life of BPA 
(P=0.16 and P=0.33 for adjusted and unadjusted data, 
respectively).
Participants with highest starting urinary bPA were more 
likely to demonstrate lower bPA at visit 2
We found an inverse relationship between initial 
BPA  concentrations and whether a participant had 
reduced BPA concentrations at visit 2 (P=0.003). These 
data indicate that the participants in the cohort with the 
highest creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA concentrations 
at visit 1 were more likely to demonstrate a drop in their 
urinary BPA at visit 2 (figure 2).
Following the intervention diet has significant effects on 
participant lifestyle
Participants indicated that following the diet had no 
significant cost implications on family finances, with 50% 
of participants reporting that it had cost more, and 50% 
reporting that costs had decreased or remained the same. 
Although participants did not spend longer preparing 
their food, 78% of participants reported that their shop-
ping took longer. Calorific intake was not affected for the 
majority of participants (58%) of participants. A large 
percentage of the cohort (91%) reported that they felt at 
least slightly restricted in their food choices and 27% of

participants reported that they felt very restricted. Finally, 
66% of participants stated that they would find it hard or 
very hard to follow the diet long term.
Qualitative analysis of the effect of following the diet on 
lifestyle
We identified five over-riding themes in our qualitative 
analysis of the effect of following the diet on lifestyle. 
These were (1) the widespread use of plastics possibly 
containing BPA in food packaging (“almost everything 
is packaged in plastic”—participant 70, “Literally every-
thing involved plastic”—participant 28). (2) Lack of 
clarity in labelling of products and packaging potentially 
containing BPA (“I found it really hard to know what 
foods I could eat … there is never a guarantee it is BPA 
free”—participant 43, “The biggest problem was that 
a lot of packaging doesn’t state what type of plastic it is 
or whether it contains BPA”—participant 74). (3) The 
perceived restrictions of being on the ‘real-world’ BPA 
avoidance diet (“Difficulty eating out, hard to find foods 
in college or ‘out’ that hadn’t touched BPA. My family 
had a takeaway on Saturday night and I couldn’t eat it”—
participant 56, “Sometimes I can’t eat/drink what I want 
because of the recycling number”—participant 112). (4) 
The impact of eating ‘BPA free’ was the only positive 
theme emerging (“I feel I have eaten much more healthily 
this week … I didn’t eat so much junk food”—participant 
74, “I ate more vegetables and less chocolate”—partici-
pant 83). (5) The impact on shopping habits (“You can’t 
get it all from supermarkets”— Participant 37; “Had to go 
to more individual food shops”—participant 103).
DIsCussIOn
Exposure to the EDC BPA is ubiquitous,2 with growing 
evidence that it may be associated with adverse health 
outcomes.4 Here, 94 researcher participants aged 17–19 
years designed and undertook a quantitative and quali-
tative engaged research project designed to assess the 
potential for reduction of personal exposure to BPA 
through moderation of diet, which would have utility in a 
‘real-world’ setting. We conclude that the ‘real-world’ diet 
designed to reduce BPA exposure had no effect on creat-
inine-adjusted urinary BPA concentrations in our cohort 
over a period of 7 days in our dataset.
Although concentrations of urinary BPA in our study 
cohort were slightly lower at the outset of the study than in 
others,18 measurable concentrations were present in the 
vast majority of our participants. Participants were unable 
to achieve a reduction in their urinary BPA over the 7-day 
trial period, despite good compliance to supplied guide-
lines. Avoidance of BPA was not easily achieved on an 
individual level in our study population, with qualitative 
analysis indicating that participants experienced feelings 
of restriction and difficulties in sourcing BPA-free food

due to inadequate labelling of foods and food packaging. 
This suggests that the intervention would be difficult to 
sustain in the longer term.
This work represents the largest group of unrelated 
participants in a high exposure demographic to date, 
since previous work has focused on families and related 
individuals,16 17 who may share common sources of BPA. 
Although other population demographics such as young 
children may have higher concentrations of BPA than 
our chosen study population,18 it would not have been 
possible to do the sort of engaged research project that 
we envisaged in this group. Our intervention is a ‘real-
world’ diet, designed to a set of guidelines (such as reduc-
tion in the usage of tinned foods or foods with high levels 
of processing), rather than the strict, prescribed diets that 
have been used in other studies,16 which suggested that 
it was possible for participants to reduce their urinary 
BPA excretion by approximately 60% in a period of just 
3 days.16 In our self-designed, self-administered study 
this was unachievable. This may reflect the difficulty in 
identifying and sourcing foods free of BPA in the current 
commercial environment. Finally, the qualitative thematic 
analysis has given an indication that adherence to even 
a ‘real-world’ BPA reduction diet with fewer restrictions 
and more choice over the longer term was unlikely in our 
study population due to difficulties in identifying food-
stuffs likely to contain less BPA.
BPA has a terminal half-life of 6 hours.15 Spot samples 
may therefore not be as accurate as continuous sampling 
strategies (24 hours urine collection). However, recent 
studies suggest that despite its short half-life, measur-
able BPA remains present for up to 43 hours postfasting, 
indicating non-food exposures or accumulation in body 
tissues such as fat.20 We identified no impact of time of 
sample collection on BPA concentrations in our sample 
set, in either creatinine-adjusted or unadjusted data, 
indicating that our measurements were not influenced 
by time since the last meal. Spot sampling as used here 
may therefore represent an acceptable compromise and 
remains a practical option in the community setting. 
The large variability in urinary BPA within an individual 
sampled at different times may also have reduced our 
ability to observe an effect. This could be facilitated by 
the use of multiple sampling or pools of multiple urines, 
but was not feasible within the confines of our study.
Calculating an accurate BPA risk score is chal-
lenging. Data were self-reported, and foodstuffs are 
not labelled for BPA content. It is difficult to gener-
alise across food types and large variations in BPA 
concentrations occur between different products of 
the same food type or even different lots of the same 
product.1 Foods that were free of BPA-containing 
packaging (as far as it was possible to tell) may have 
been highly processed or contain food items from a 
variety of sources. Highly processed and ‘fast’ food has 
previously been demonstrated to be a source of BPA.21 
A study of the temporal trends seen in composite food 
samples found no change in the overall BPA content of 
the food, despite large reduction in the BPA content 
of some individual food items, illustrating the difficul-
ties in effectively excluding BPA from a varied diet.22 
Participants may therefore have changed BPA-con-
taining foods for other, perceived healthier choices, 
which may still contain BPA by virtue of processing.
BPA enters foodstuffs by leaching from polycarbonate 
or epoxy resin after manufacture, or by hydrolysis of the 
polymer itself.23 The migration rate of BPA increases 
with higher temperatures,24 and with time and use, for 
example, repeated use of polycarbonate water bottles.25 
Exposure to BPA can also occur through routes other 
than food, including dust ingestion and dermal absorp-
tion26 and this was not taken into account in our study. 
A study of volunteers who purposefully handled thermal 
receipts showed an increase in urinary BPA excretion of 
up to 84%, and their BPA levels took longer to return 
to pre exposure levels, suggesting a difference in the 
bioavailability of BPA through skin and oral routes.27 
It is also possible that some manufacturers may have 
voluntarily reduced the amount of BPA-containing food 
packaging compared with their previous usage, given 
the attention that EDCs have received in the media. 
However, measurable levels of BPA were still detected in 
the majority of participants in our study, which suggests 
that there may be other, non-dietary, sources of BPA, 
and that exposure to BPA remains an issue. We may also 
have been underpowered to detect subtle changes in 
urinary BPA, given the heterogeneity in food choice; 
detection of such effects may need thousands of partic-
ipants. Finally, our study, like other studies of its type, 
does not take account of interindividual differences 
in the metabolism and excretion of BPA arising from 
differences in genetic background between people. BPA 
is metabolised primarily by uridine 5′-diphospho-glucu-
ronosyltransferases, and altered activity polymorphisms 
of these enzymes have been reported.28
Emerging evidence suggests that that BPA may 
be linked to several chronic human health condi-
tions,6–9 29 suggesting that continued study of the human 
health effects of BPA exposure is justified. The opinion of 
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), is that while 
uncertainty over the human health effects of BPA exists, 
caution should be exercised in ingestion of BPA.3 Our 
data suggest that in our study population, it is unlikely 
that participants could moderate their own BPA exposure 
in the long term by self-directed modification of diet in a 
‘real-world’ setting, and furthermore, participants would 
have been reluctant to adopt such a lifestyle change in 
the longer term due to the restrictions in dietary choice 
and the effects on day-to-day life. Most of these barriers 
appear to arise from the pervasiveness of BPA in our food 
chain, and inadequate labelling of foods packaged in 
BPA-containing substances. We propose that until a defin-
itive assessment of the health risks of BPA is available, 
informed choice over whether or not to consume BPA 
and similar chemicals in foodstuffs should be facilitated 
by better labelling.
