As comprehensive medical databases are constructed to include 
hundreds of thousands of participants, Internet-based tech-
nologies are increasingly being used for participant recruitment 
and retention in medical research studies. In an effort to recruit 
1 million US participants from diverse racial and socioeconomic 
backgrounds, the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Working 
Group recommended the design of a centralized, bidirectional 
“participant portal” that can be used by participants to provide 
data and to access results of studies.1,2 Furthermore, they sug-
gested using e-mail and text messages to remind participants 
of their value to the PMI cohort, strategies consistent with par-
ticipant-centric initiatives.2–4 However, it is not known whether 
these Internet-based approaches will engage the underrepre-
sented groups that the PMI Working Group seeks to enroll.
Interest in medical research is high across demographic 
groups. The PMI Working Group reported high interest in 
participation among a sample of 2,601 potential participants 
that included a large number of underrepresented cohorts.2 
Similarly, a University of Maryland survey of 169 outpatients 
found that willingness to join a biobank was not associated with 
gender, race, or socioeconomic factors.5 By contrast, clinical 
studies have found that study engagement and retention are low 
among underserved populations, including African Americans 
and individuals without a high school education.6,7
Because 84% of American adults use the Internet8 and 68% 
own a smartphone,9 it is thought that leveraging digital tech-
nologies will be an effective method for engagement of all par-
ticipants, including those who are typically underrepresented 
in research studies. In this study we measured participant 
engagement by tracking online viewing of ancestry results and 
evaluated how engagement varies across demographic and 
socioeconomic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants were enrolled in a genetic study of smoking, which 
was approved by the institutional review board at Washington 
University in St. Louis. All participants gave informed con-
sent. Participants were recruited in 2014 from the St. Louis 
metropolitan area; 89% were recruited via flyers or word of 
mouth, 6% were recruited from the research participant regis-
try at Washington University (https://vfh.wustl.edu), 3% were 
recruited from Craigslist, and 2% were recruited from Facebook. 
All participants were current smokers, as demonstrated by a 
minimum exhaled carbon monoxide level of 5 parts per mil-
lion, and they had to be able to consent to study participation in 
English. After the informed-consent process, participants were 
given a brief (30-min) semistructured, computer-assisted inter-
view to assess baseline demographics, substance-use history,

Purpose: Internet-based technologies are increasingly being used for 
research studies. However, it is not known whether Internet-based 
approaches will effectively engage participants from diverse racial 
and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Methods: A total of 967 participants were recruited and offered 
genetic ancestry results. We evaluated viewing Internet-based genetic 
ancestry results among participants who expressed high interest in 
obtaining the results.
Results: Of the participants, 64% stated that they were very or 
extremely interested in their genetic ancestry results. Among inter-
ested participants, individuals with a high school diploma (n = 473) 
viewed their results 19% of the time relative to 4% of the 145 partici-
pants without a diploma (P < 0.0001). Similarly, 22% of participants 
with household income above the federal poverty level (n = 286) 
viewed their results relative to 10% of the 314 participants living 
below the federal poverty level (P < 0.0001). Among interested par-
ticipants both with a high school degree and living above the poverty 
level, self-identified Caucasians were more likely to view results than 
self-identified African Americans (P < 0.0001), and females were 
more likely to view results than males (P = 0.0007).
Conclusion: In an underserved population, engagement in 
 
Internet-based research was low despite high reported interest. This 
suggests that explicit strategies should be developed to increase 
 
diversity in Internet-based research.

and health-care literacy as measured by the Rapid Estimate of 
Adult Literacy in Medicine–Revised.10
Genetic analysis was performed by 23andMe (https://
www.23andMe.com). As an incentive for participation in the 
smoking study, participants were offered access to their genetic 
ancestry results through the 23andMe website. As part of the 
informed-consent process, participants were told that they 
would receive their genetic ancestry results and were shown 
an example of the results. Both the Internet and paper flyers 
advertised that the participants would receive genetic ancestry 
results. The interview included the question “How interested 
are you in seeing your genetic ancestry results?” Response 
options were “not at all interested,” “slightly interested,” “mod-
erately interested,” “very interested,” and “extremely interested.” 
After the assessment was complete, participants donated a 
saliva sample. Participants were assisted by the research staff
 
in creating a personal account on the 23andMe website, which 
required an e-mail address; 83% of participants had an estab-
lished e-mail address. Those who did not were assisted in creat-
ing an e-mail account. Participants were given a sheet on which 
to record their user names and passwords for future reference.
Four to 6 weeks following participation in the study, partici-
pants were informed that their ancestry results were ready and 
given instructions on how to access them. To view the results, 
participants had to log into their established 23andMe account. 
23andMe has an easily navigable, user-friendly website and 
mobile interface.
The investigative team tracked how many participants viewed 
their genetic ancestry results, as measured by whether a partici-
pant logged into 23andMe after their genetic results were avail-
able. Neither the length of time spent on the 23andMe website 
nor the number of logins was recorded. To ensure that partici-
pants were informed about the availability of their results, those 
who did not log into their 23andMe account after their ancestry 
results were available were contacted a minimum of four times 
using a variety of methods. If participants had still had not picked 
up their results after being contacted via e-mail and telephone, 
they were sent a letter by first-class mail. Participants were given 
at least 6 months to pick up their ancestry results before being 
classified as having not reviewed their genetic results.
Data analysis included chi-squared testing and logistic regres-
sion and was completed using SAS version 9.4 for Windows 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
RESULTS
23andMe results were obtained for 967 participants. A total of 
114 participants (12%) viewed their genetic ancestry results 
(Table 1). Demographics are given in Table 1. Consistent with 
2014 St. Louis Census data,11 participants without a high school 
degree (or general equivalency diploma) were less likely to be 
European-American (P = 0.0002) and more likely to live in a 
household with a total income below the federal poverty level 
(P < 0.0001).
A majority of participants expressed strong interest in receiv-
ing genetic ancestry results: 64% said they were “very” or 
“extremely” interested (Table 1). Participants with a high school 
education were more likely to have a higher level of interest in 
receiving genetic ancestry results than participants without a 
high school education (P = 0.01). Gender, race, and income did 
not statistically influence whether the participants were inter-
ested in the results.
Few participants (4%) who said they were “not at all inter-
ested,” “slightly interested,” or “moderately interested” in their 
genetic ancestry results actually viewed their results, which we 
deemed to be in line with their stated interest. We therefore 
focused on further examining the group of participants who 
said they were “very” or “extremely” interested in receiving 
their genetic ancestry results. Surprisingly, even of these par-
ticipants who expressed high interest, only 16% actually viewed 
their results.
We then investigated sociodemographic factors associated 
with viewing ancestry results among this highly interested 
group (Figure 1). Regardless of gender or race, interested par-
ticipants rarely viewed results if they did not complete high 
school (P < 0.0001) or had a household income below the fed-
eral poverty level (P < 0.0001; Figure 1a). Among participants 
who both completed high school and had a household income 
above the federal poverty level, men were less likely than 
women to view results (P = 0.0001), and African Americans 
were less likely than European Americans to view results (P < 
0.0001; Figure 1b). There was no statistical interaction on view-
ing results between gender and race.

DISCUSSION
Participant engagement is a core feature of the PMI. This study 
examined participant engagement in Internet-based research 
by tracking whether participants viewed genetic ancestry 
results online. Despite high levels of initial expressed inter-
est in their genetic ancestry results, we observed challenges 
with engaging participants from typically underrepresented 
groups, including individuals without a high school degree, 
individuals living below the federal poverty level, and African 
Americans. In addition, it is important to note that, even after 
adjusting for education and living below the poverty level, 
African Americans were less likely to engage in our study than 
European Americans.
Because of the long-standing underrepresentation of African 
Americans and individuals with low socioeconomic status in 
medical studies, a stated mission of the PMI Working Group is 
that it will “ensure that people historically underrepresented in 
biomedical research are included in sufficient numbers to allow 
robust inferences in these groups.”2 The proposed method for 
recruitment of the PMI cohort is partnership with health-care 
provider organizations combined with direct volunteers, which 
may not adequately reach historically underrepresented groups. 
Although 90% of the general population has health insurance, 
only 69% of individuals without a high school education and 
83% of individuals living below the poverty level have health 
insurance.12 Because of lower rates of health insurance among 
these underserved populations, recruitment of these individu-
als to the PMI cohort will be more difficult than recruiting 
from the general population. Our findings indicate that, even 
if underrepresented groups are successfully recruited into and 
express interest in the PMI cohort, the use of Internet-based 
technologies may pose an additional challenge to engagement 
among underrepresented groups.
In this study, participants were given at least 6 months to 
view their genetic ancestry results, and they were contacted 
multiple times in different ways to inform and remind them 
of the availability of their results. Using this approach, we were 
able to engage 45% of the European American participants 
with a high school education who were living above the poverty 
level. By contrast, we were able to engage only 18% of African 
American participants with a high school education who were 
living above the poverty level, 4% of participants without a high 
school education, and 10% of participants living in poverty. 
These results highlight the challenges of maintaining engage-
ment of underrepresented groups using Internet-based meth-
ods. Previous studies suggest that personal contact, incentives, 
and community engagement have proven effective in recruiting 
and retaining minority populations.13,14 Adapting these strate-
gies to include digital technologies is important for creating a 
cohort representative of all Americans.
This study is limited by the fact that our specific definition of 
“engagement” which limits the generalizability of our findings. 
However, aspects of this study, including e-mail-based login 
and website navigation, are common among Internet-based 
medical studies. A second limitation of the study is that par-
ticipant interest was measured via a face-to-face interview and 
may be artificially inflated by participants’ responses based on 
their perceptions of what was desired by the interviewer.
Nonetheless, the results of this study have strong implica-
tions as we move forward with Internet-based approaches in 
Figure 1  Education, poverty, gender and race impact participant engagement. (a) Viewing genetic ancestry results by participants who reported 
being “extremely” or “very” interested in viewing results varies by education and income. (b) Viewing genetic ancestry differs across gender and race among 
interested participants who completed high school and have a household income above the federal poverty level. Error bars represent 95% confidence 
intervals; P values are from logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and race.
