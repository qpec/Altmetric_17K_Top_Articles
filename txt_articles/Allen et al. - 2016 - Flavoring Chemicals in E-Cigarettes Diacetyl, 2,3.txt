Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) 
reports that $3 billion was spent on elec-
tronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in 2013 in 
the United States alone, with sales expected 
to increase 17-fold in 15 years. The CDC 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) 
estimates that 1.78 million children tried 
e-cigarettes as of 2012, with 160,000 of 
them reporting that they had not used 
tobacco cigarettes (CDC 2013). E-cigarettes 
are not currently regulated; the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), which 
has the authority to regulate certain tobacco 
and nicotine-containing products under the 
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco 
Control Act (2009) has issued a proposed 
rule to include e-cigarettes under this Act 
(FDA 2014). Although the popularity and 
use of e-cigarettes continues to increase, data 
are lacking on the exposures and potential 
human health effects of the use of e-cigarettes.
Concerns regarding e-cigarettes primarily 
focus on nicotine exposure, secondhand 
expo 
sure, the potential for e-cigarettes to be a 
gateway to cigarette use, and renormalization/
social acceptance of smoking (Bell and Keane 
2014; Coleman et al. 2014; Goniewicz et al. 
2014a; Long 2014; McMillen et al. 2015; 
Trehy et al. 2011). Other recent investigations 
have focused on the chemical content of the 
e-cigarettes beyond nicotine, with researchers 
finding that users of e-cigarettes are exposed 
to carbonyl compounds, aldehydes, fine 
particulate matter, metals, propylene glycol, 
glycerol, formaldehyde, VOCs, and other 
additives (Bekki et al. 2014; Callahan-Lyon 
2014; Cheng 2014; Goniewicz et al. 2014b; 
Hutzler et al. 2014; Jensen et al. 2015; Orr 
2014; Pellegrino et al. 2012; Uchiyama 
et al. 2013; Williams et al. 2013). However, 
despite > 7,000 flavors of e-cigarettes currently 
marketed (Zhu et al. 2014), only three 
papers have been published that focus on 
exposure to flavoring chemicals specifically 
(Farsalinos et al. 2015; Hutzler et al. 2014; 
Behar et al. 2014), and one opinion piece in 
JAMA that highlights the potential respiratory 
health effects from using flavored e-cigarettes 
(Barrington-Trimis et al. 2014).
The use of flavorings in food products 
gained public attention in the early 2000s 
because of reports of serious lung disease in 
microwave popcorn workers (Hilts 2001). 
The flavoring chemicals involved were on 
the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) 
list that applies only to ingestion, but expo-
sures were occurring via inhalation and very 
little was known about potential inhala-
tion hazards of these chemicals at that time 
(FDA 2015). In May 2000, eight persons 
who had previously worked at a microwave 
popcorn–processing plant were reported to 
have severe bronchiolitis obliterans (Kreiss 
et al. 2002), an irreversible loss of pulmonary 
function that can become so severe that the 
only treatment option may be a lung trans-
plant (OSHA 2007). Researchers from the 
National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) Division of Respiratory 
Disease Studies conducted an investigation 
at the facility where the affected workers 
were employed. The NIOSH investigation 
included medical testing (including pulmo-
nary function testing, medical question-
naires and work history documentation) 
and industrial hygiene exposure measure-
ments (including grab samples, use of direct 
reading instruments, and full shift samples). 
NIOSH determined that workers at this 
plant had > 2 times the expected rates of 
chronic cough, shortness of breath, asthma, 
and chronic bronchitis, and nonsmokers 
had > 10 times the expected prevalence of 
airway obstruction (CDC 2007; Kreiss 
et al. 2002). A strong association was found 
between this excess of lung disease, including 
bronchiolitis obliterans, and airborne expo-
sures to butter-flavoring chemicals in the 
facility. Diacetyl was the most prominent 
chemical in the butter flavorings. Two other 
flavoring compounds of interest, acetoin and 
2,3-pentanedione, were present in signifi-
cant amounts or not sampled, respectively. 
Workers in the area where diacetyl-containing 
butter flavoring was added into heated mixing 
vats were exposed to volatilized flavor chemi-
cals, and a significant, positive dose response 
relationship was identified (CDC 2007; Kreiss 
et al. 2002). A follow-up investigation at six 
other microwave popcorn manufacturing 
facilities found that, in five of six plants, 
mixers of butter flavoring and packaging-area

Background: There are > 7,000 e-cigarette flavors currently marketed. Flavoring chemicals gained 
notoriety in the early 2000s when inhalation exposure of the flavoring chemical diacetyl was found 
to be associated with a disease that became known as “popcorn lung.” There has been limited 
research on flavoring chemicals in e-cigarettes.
oBjective: We aimed to determine if the flavoring chemical diacetyl and two other high-priority 
flavoring chemicals, 2,3-pentanedione and acetoin, are present in a convenience sample of flavored 
e-cigarettes.
Methods: We selected 51 types of flavored e-cigarettes sold by leading e-cigarette brands and 
flavors we deemed were appealing to youth. E-cigarette contents were fully discharged and the 
air stream was captured and analyzed for total mass of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and acetoin, 
according to OSHA method 1012.
results: At least one flavoring chemical was detected in 47 of 51 unique flavors tested. Diacetyl 
was detected above the laboratory limit of detection in 39 of the 51 flavors tested, ranging from 
below the limit of quantification to 239 μg/e-cigarette. 2,3-Pentanedione and acetoin were detected 
in 23 and 46 of the 51 flavors tested at concentrations up to 64 and 529 μg/e-cigarette, respectively.
conclusion: Because of the associations between diacetyl and bronchiolitis obliterans and other 
severe respiratory diseases observed in workers, urgent action is recommended to further evaluate 
this potentially widespread exposure via flavored e-cigarettes.

employees working near tanks of heated oil, 
with exposure to diacteyl as low as 0.2 ppm, 
had fixed airway obstruction consistent with 
bronchiolitis obliterans (Kanwal et al. 2006). 
Based on its occurrence in microwave popcorn 
manufacturing plants, bronchiolitis oblit-
erans (and some related respiratory diseases 
of the small airways) became commonly 
known as “popcorn lung.” The findings of 
adverse health effects in workers at microwave 
popcorn plants prompted additional investiga-
tions. The CDC identified seven additional 
cases of bronchiolitis obliterans in workers 
at a flavoring manufacturing company 
(CDC 2007).
Diacetyl is contained in a variety of 
flavors in addition to butter flavor (Table 1) 
(OSHA 2010), and its use is not limited to 
microwave popcorn facilities or food flavoring 
production facilities. Diacetyl, 2,3-pentane-
dione (a structurally related replacement 
for diacetyl), and acetoin are used in the 
manufacture of many other foods for a wide 
range of flavors beyond butter flavorings 
(e.g., caramel, butterscotch, pina colada, 
strawberry). Many of these same flavors are 
common in e-cigarette flavor cartridges, and 
are often sold with names that we consider 
to be potentially appealing to children, 
teenagers, and young adults: Cupcake, Fruit 
Squirts, Waikiki Watermelon, Cotton Candy, 
Tutti Frutti, Double Apple Hookah, Blue 
Water Punch, Oatmeal Cookie, and Alien 
Blood. Further, e-cigarettes use a battery-
driven nicotine delivery system in which an 
atomizer produces an aerosol (and vapors of 
evaporated liquids) through the heating of 
e-cigarette liquids contained in replaceable 
cartridges or re-fillable wells (Burstyn 2014; 
Jensen et al. 2015).
The heating, vaporization, and subsequent 
inhalation of these flavoring chemicals in 
e-cigarettes makes an exposure pathway for 
these flavorings that has significant similari-
ties to those of the workers at the microwave 
popcorn facilities. In microwave popcorn 
manufacturing, flavorings, salt, and colorants 
are added to heated soybean oil (57–60°C). 
Kullman et al. (2005) reported that aerosols 
and flavoring ingredient vapors were found 
in these mixing rooms. The aerosol found to 
have a combustible fraction that ranged from 
70% to 85% by weight (average 79%) and a 
noncombustible fraction of 21%. The aerosol 
was identified as salt particles and oil-coated 
salt particles, and much of the aerosol was of 
respirable size. The mixing rooms were where 
the highest air concentration of flavorings was 
found (Kullman et al. 2005).
Given the widespread use of these 
food flavors across many industries and 
the knowledge that specific chemicals/
artificial flavors were developed to mimic 
certain natural flavors commonly used 
in e-cigarettes, we hypothe 
sized that these 
compounds are likely used in the manufac-
turing of flavored e-cigarettes. We sought to 
expand the state of knowledge on flavoring 
chemicals in e-cigarettes with a particular 
focus on e-cigarettes sold by the largest ciga-
rette companies and also those flavors that 
we deem would be appealing to children, 
 
teenagers, and young adults.
Methods
E-Cigarette Selection
A convenience sample of 51 e-cigarette flavors 
was selected for use in this study. Electronic 
cigarette cartridges, liquids, and their associ-
ated devices and batteries were purchased 
online and in retail locations. We evaluated 
51 flavors, including all available flavors from 
three large cigarette companies (Brands A, B, 
and C, with 2, 2, and 7 flavors, respectively); 
5 flavors from a large independent e-cigarette 
company (Brand D); and 24 additional 
flavors from three e-cigarette distributors 
(Brands E, F, and G; 10, 8, and 6 flavors, 
respectively) that we selected based on their 
potential appeal to children, teenagers, and 
young adults (Table 2). In addition, we 
evaluated 11 e-liquid flavors that are inserted 
into a cartomizer (disposable cartridge and 
atomizer system) (Brands H and I; 6 and 
5 flavors, respectively).
The emissions from the e-cigarette are 
composed of an aerosol and flavor/solvent 
vapors. The aerosol and vapors are released 
after contact of the flavoring solution with 
the heater coil in the atomizer/cartomizer. In 
this study we used OSHA method 1012 for 
sampling of three flavoring chemicals (OSHA 
2008). The sampling media consists of a glass 
wool plug and glass fiber filter (GFF) in front 
of a dried silica bed. During the development 
of OSHA method 1012, the effectiveness 
of the silica gel tubes for capturing diacetyl 
and acetoin was examined. In part of that 
assessment, samples were taken with a PVC 
(polyvinyl chloride) filter with a powder on 
its surface that contained a known amount of 
the flavoring chemicals. The PVC filter was 
placed in series (before the silica gel tubes) 
and samples were taken. Both the filter and 
silica gel tubes were analyzed for the flavoring 
chemicals. OSHA reported that between 
94.4% and 99.7% of the flavorings that were 
present in the powder were recovered from 
the silica gel tubes, not the filter—the majority 
of the flavoring chemicals were stripped away 
and captured on the silica gel (OSHA 2008).
Sampling Protocol
The goal of the sampling protocol was 
to estimate the total mass of diacetyl, 
2,3-pentanedione, and acetoin emitted 
from each cartridge. Each e-cigarette was 
inserted into a sealed chamber attached to a 
 
laboratory- 
built device that drew air through 
the e-cigarette for 8 sec at a time, with a 
resting period of 15 or 30 sec between each 
draw (Figure 1). Eight seconds was chosen 
to make certain that each draw had adequate 
time for the entire contents to be forced 
out of the smoking device and through the 
sampling media. The draws were automated 
using a Pneucleus Technologies LLC MediFlo 
Mass Flow Controller. Air from the chamber 
was split into high and low flows to meet the 
lower-flow sampling requirements for OSHA 
method 1012 (OSHA 2008). The low flow 
(target, 200 mL/min) was optimized to carry 
the emissions of the e-cigarette through the 
sampling media (two SKC silica gel sorbent 
tubes containing 600 mg of specially washed 
and baked silica gel connected in series). The 
higher flow path was filtered and discharged. 
The total flow was set to the minimum 
needed to initiate a draw from the automatic 
e-cigarette and was measured at the beginning 
and end of each sample to determine the ratio 
between the high and low flows. The samples 
were collected until the e-cigarette cartridges 
or cartomizers were exhausted, determined by 
the lack of visible emissions in the chamber.
The samples from the lower flow portion 
of the sampling system were analyzed for 
diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and acetoin using 
OSHA method 1012 (OSHA 2008). To 
determine the total concentration emitted, 
the reported values from the laboratory 
were adjusted using the corresponding ratio 
of low flow to total flow for each sample. 
For example, if the volume of air passing 
through the sampling media was 10% of total 
flow, the mass reported by the laboratory 
was multiplied by 10 to estimate the total 
chemical mass emitted from the e-cigarette 
cartridge. For the first batch of samples, the

0.12-L volume chamber was passively purged 
for approximately 10 min between sampling 
different e-cigarettes by opening the chamber. 
For the second batch of samples, we included 
a 10-min active purge of the chamber where 
the pumps were turned on and fresh air was 
drawn into the chamber. Quality assurance/
quality control samples were collected for 
each batch.
Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Seven blank samples (> 10% of total sample 
size) were collected using the same procedure 
outlined in the previous section but without 
an e-cigarette in the chamber. The same ratio 
adjustment process was conducted using the 
ratio of the low and high flow rates to obtain 
the total chemical mass of chemical in the 
blanks, if any. Values for all three chemicals 
were < LOD (limit of detection) in four 
of the seven field blanks, one had detect-
able levels of diacetyl and acetoin (1.2 and 
10.7 μg/e-cigarette, respectively), one had 
detectable levels of 2,3-pentanedione and 
acetoin (0.4 and 9.2 μg/e-cigarette, respec-
tively), and one had detectable acetoin only 
(1 μg/e-cigarette). Once the blanks were 
adjusted for flow, we performed a blank 
correction by batch according to the following 
procedure. Blank samples were averaged by 
batch before blank correction, and values 
below the laboratory LOD were imputed with 
a value of one-half the detection limit before 
averaging. We calculated a limit of quantifica-
tion (LOQ) for our procedure that was higher 
than the laboratory-reported LOD (0.05 μg/
sample) using three times the standard devia-
tion of the field blank samples. After blank 
correction, primary samples were compared 
to this LOQ by batch 1 and batch 2 (diacetyl: 
2.3 μg, 0.19 μg; 2,3-pentanedione: 0.07 μg, 
0.38 μg; acetoin: 1.08 μg, 3.2 μg). If the 
blank-corrected mass was above the LOQ, the 
chemical was labeled “detected” and the value 
reported, and if the blank-corrected mass was 
not above the LOQ but still detected, we 
reported the value as “< LOQ.” If the sample 
was reported as not detected by the lab, we 
report the value as “< LOD.” We re-sampled 
several of the same flavors from the same 
package (ie, testing two e-cigarette cartridges 
from the same pack). These replicate samples 
were collected for six flavors: Brand C Pina 
Colada (3 replicates), Brand C Cherry Crush, 
Brand D Pomegranate, Brand E Iced Berry, 
Brand F Watermelon, and Brand A Classic. 
The root mean square error (RMSE) for repli-
cate samples ranged from 2.9 μg/e-cigarette to 
98.4 μg/e-cigarette.
All samples were analyzed by ALS 
Laboratories in Salt Lake City, Utah, a labo-
ratory accredited by the AIHA (American 
Industrial Hygiene Association) Laboratory 
Accreditation Program for Industrial 
Hygiene. To check the integrity of the cali-
bration curve, a separate initial calibration 
verification (ICV) standard was introduced 
at the mid-range level of the curve. A separate 
stock solution was used to generate a liquid 
calibration standard (LCS; 89.9% recovery) 
and liquid calibration standard duplicate 
(LSCD; 89.9% recovery) as an overall 
accuracy and precision check. A reagent 
blank was prepared and run along with the

samples to ensure that the laboratory did not 
introduce any contamination that would 
affect the analyte of interest recovery. For the 
three analytes in this study, the reagent blanks 
reported levels were all less than the  
laboratory 
reporting limit of 0.05 μg per sample.
Statistical Analysis
We grouped the samples using the product 
names and descriptions on the distributors’ 
websites into the following flavoring catego-
ries based on OSHA’s categories (Table 1): 
dairy, brown, fruit, and cocktail. Additional 
categories were created for tobacco-flavored 
e-cigarettes and flavors that fell into any other 
categories. Distributions of the mass of each of 
the three chemicals were compared according 
to flavor type using two sample t-tests and 
boxplots (R version 3.0.0; R Core Team 
2015). When summarizing distributions, we 
substituted one half the value of the LOD as 
the mass for samples < LOD or < LOQ.
Results
The total mass per e-cigarette (micrograms per 
e-cigarette) of the flavoring chemicals diacetyl, 
2,3-pentanedione, and acetoin are presented 
in Table 2. Diacetyl was above the LOD in 39 
of the 51 flavors tested, ranging from < LOQ 
to 239 μg/e-cigarette. 2,3-Pentanedione and 
acetoin were detected in 23 and 46 of the 51 
flavors tested at concentrations up to 64 and 
529 μg/e-cigarette, respectively.
At least one of the flavoring chemicals 
was detected in 47 of the 51 unique flavors 
tested (92%). This includes several e-cigarette 
flavors that are not candy or fruit flavored, 
such as “classic” and “menthol.” Diacetyl 
and 2,3-pentanedione were detected simul-
taneously in 21 unique flavors, suggesting 
that 2,3-pentanedione may not be only a 
replacement for diacetyl but is often used 
in conjunction with diacetyl in e-cigarettes. 
Similarly, 2,3-pentanedione and acetoin 
were also detected simultaneously in 22 
flavors. Diacetyl and acetoin were simultane-
ously detected in an even greater number of 
flavors (n = 38).
Figure 2 depicts the distributions of the 
chemical masses of the e-cigarette samples, 
including replicates, according to flavor 
type. The three compounds were detected 
in all flavor types, except for 2,3-pentane-
dione in dairy-flavored e-cigarettes, which 
only had two samples. The median masses 
of the flavor types did not have a consistent 
ranking from one chemical to the next. For 
example, tobacco flavors had the second to 
lowest median mass for diacetyl compared 
with the fourth lowest for acetoin. The 
cocktail-flavored e-cigarettes had the highest 
median masses and largest range for all three 
compounds, but none of the differences in

Discussion
Diacetyl—a flavoring compound associated 
with the development of “popcorn lung” 
in workers after inhalation exposure—was 
detected in 39 of the 51 flavored e-cigarettes 
tested in this study, including flavors that 
have particular appeal to children, teenagers, 
and young adults. Forty-seven of the 51 
flavors tested in our study had at least one 
of the three flavoring compounds detected 
(diacetyl, 2,3-pentandedione, acetoin). These 
compounds were ubiquitous among flavor 
types: “tobacco” and “menthol” flavored 
e-cigarettes contained diacetyl despite not 
being listed on OSHA’s list of flavors that 
likely contain diacetyl (Table 1).
The health concerns related to inhaling 
diacetyl and other flavoring chemicals are now 
well recognized by OSHA and the flavoring 
industry. OSHA established a National 
Emphasis Program (NEP) in 2007 focused 
on respiratory disease in workers at micro-
wave popcorn–processing facilities, and a 
NEP in 2009 focused on “Facilities that 
Manufacture Food Flavorings Containing 
Diacetyl” (OSHA 2007, 2009). The Flavoring 
and Extract Manufacturers Association of the 
United States released a report in April 2012 
on respiratory health and safety in the food-
manufacturing workplace that highlighted 
the potential risks associated with inhaling 
diacetyl and a long list of other food flavoring 
chemicals (FEMA 2012). FEMA recommends 
the following warning for “Any compounded 
flavors (liquid, dry or powdered) containing 
any flavoring substances listed in Table 1 in 
any concentrations if the compounded flavor 
or any of its individual flavoring substances 
will be heated during processing.” [The 
Table 1 referenced is specific to diacetyl.]
WARNING–This flavor may pose an inhalation 
hazard if improperly handled. Please contact 
your workplace safety officer before opening and 
handling, and read the MSDS. Handling of this 
flavor that results in inhalation of fumes, especially 
if the flavor is heated, may cause severe adverse 
health effects.
Unlike these efforts by OSHA and the 
flavor industry to raise awareness of the 
hazards associated with inhaling flavoring 
chemicals, our review of the websites and 
packaging for the flavored e-cigarette brands 
in our study did not identify any similar

notifications regarding diacetyl specifically or 
flavorings generally. Two companies explic-
itly stated that their products do not contain 
diacetyl in written communication, yet in our 
testing we did find diacetyl in their product.
Rules for labeling do not currently exist 
for e-cigarettes, because—unlike tobacco 
products, which are regulated by the FDA 
under authority of the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009), 
a statute that authorizes the FDA to require 
warning labels on packages and advertisements 
and bans flavored  
cigarettes—e-cigarettes are 
not currently regulated. However, this may 
be changing. In 2014, the FDA issued a 
proposed rule that seeks to expand the legal 
definition of tobacco products to include 
e-cigarettes and other nicotine-containing 
products (FDA 2014). If finalized, the rule 
may include minimum age and identifica-
tion requirements and proposed addictiveness 
warnings. Specifically related to the research 
presented here, and our opinion that many 
flavors are appealing to youth, the FDA 
(2014) states that “some tobacco products, 
such as e-cigarettes and certain cigars, are 
being marketed with characterizing flavors, 
and that these flavors can be especially attrac-
tive to youth.” The FDA then acknowledges 
that the existing Family Smoking Prevention 
and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 prohib-
iting flavors currently applies only to ciga-
rettes, not e-cigarettes, and they are seeking 
additional information regarding the effects 
e-cigarettes have on public health. The data 
presented in this manuscript on the presence 
of flavoring chemicals in e-cigarettes that 
have been previously associated with severe 
respiratory disease are a step toward addressing 
this information gap.
As a result of the toxicological and 
epidemiological studies by NIOSH, inhala-
tion exposure limits for adult workers have 
been established for several food-flavoring 
compounds, including diacetyl and its struc-
turally similar replacement, 2,3-pentanedione 
(Table 3). However, there are no health-based 
standards for diacetyl inhalation for the 
general public, and no standards for children. 
We agree with a recent response to an article 
by NIOSH investigators (Hubbs et al. 2015) 
and an advisory released by FEMA (2015) 
that there are important considerations in 
interpreting analyses that use occupational 
health limits for estimating risk for e-cigarette 
smokers. First, these occupational health 
limits are set for healthy workers, not the 
general population, and e-cigarette users 
are not exclusively workers. Second, the 
U.S. regulatory agencies accept greater risk 
for workers than for the general population. 
For example, “acceptable” risk for workers is 
generally 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 risk of an 
adverse event (Hubbs et al. 2015), whereas 
the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection 
Agency) uses 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 
as “acceptable” for the general population 
(Castorina and Woodruff 2003). By applying 
occupational health limits to the general 
population of flavored e-cigarette smokers, 
we would thus be accepting a higher risk than 
typical. Third, the occupational limits are 
based on an 8-hr period, 5 days per week, 
and come with the assumption that a worker 
will have 16 hr of recovery time between 
shifts, and 2-day recovery on the weekend, 
which is not applicable to e-cigarette users. 
Fourth, these exposure limits are for adults, 
not children, who on average have a smaller 
body weight compared with typical adult 
workers, resulting in a greater overall dose per 
e-cigarette for children and adolescents. Fifth, 
we do not know whether the dose–response 
relationships observed for workers would be 
similar for children, who can be more suscep-
tible to some environmental exposures. Last, 
the occupational exposure limits are not 
“bright lines”; values below the limit should

not automatically be interpreted as “safe.” 
In fact, there is guidance for interpreting 
values below the occupational health limits. 
The AIHA first uses the upper confidence 
limit of the 95th percentile exposure value 
when comparing exposure measurements 
to an occupational limit, not just a point 
estimate or mean. They then use a “control 
banding” to establish where the exposure fits 
within five AIHA exposure control categories 
(Ignacio and Bullock 2006). Even when the 
95th percentile exposure estimate is 10% of 
the occupational limit, at a minimum hazard 
communication is a typical control response 
to the exposure (Hewett et al. 2006). At 50% 
of the occupational limit, additional controls 
are also typical, including exposure surveil-
lance, medical surveillance, and work practice 
evaluation (Hewett et al. 2006).
Strengths and Limitations
One major goal of our study was to deter-
mine whether diacetyl and other flavoring 
compounds were present in the vapors 
released from flavored e-cigarettes. Because 
of the vast number of flavored e-cigarettes 
currently on the market, our convenience 
sample of 51 flavors means that the extent 
to which are results are generalizable to the 
entire population of e-cigarette flavors is 
simply unknown; we did, however, detect 
at least one flavoring compound in 47 of 
the 51 flavors tested, suggesting the need to 
rapidly determine whether this high preva-
lence found in our study is consistent across 
the many thousands of flavors being sold. 
Our method for determining when the 
e-cigarette was fully spent relied on a visual 
determination of emissions of the e-cigarette 
in the chamber. It is possible that our samples 
did not fully reflect the total chemical content 
in the e-cigarettes if liquid remained in the 
e-cigarette at the time our sampler was turned 
off, causing an underestimate of chemical 
content. This method may explain the vari-
ability in replicate samples, as well as variable 
chemical doses in e-cigarettes of the same 
type. Another approach to determine total 
content would be to directly analyze the 
chemical content in the liquid contained in 
flavored e-cigarettes, but this does not permit 
analysis of the vapor. Also, our blank correc-
tion procedure used an imputed value for 
blank samples that were less than the limit 
of detection. Typically, blank correction 
would not be performed when blank samples 
do not have detectable levels of a chemical. 
However, to be consistent in how we handled 
blanks that did have detectable levels across 
the different batches, we decided to uniformly 
blank-correct, including the incorporation 
of nondetected blank samples (imputed, as 
previously described). This also would lead to 
an underestimate of chemical concentrations 
in the vapor. Last, our samples also showed 
within-flavor variability, as evidenced by 
the RMSE for replicate samples. This vari-
ability could be attributable to our method 
or variability in chemical content in flavored 
e-cigarettes; Cheng (2014) reported a high 
degree of variability in nicotine content 
within e-cigarettes of the same brand. Given 
these limitations, we urge caution in inter-
preting samples with values below the limit 
of quantification but above the limit of 
 
detection as being “diacetyl-free.”
Strengths of our approach include 
measuring actual concentrations of these three 
flavoring chemicals in the vapor of e-cigarettes 
using repeatable and validated sampling and 
analytical methods, and methodological deci-
sions that gave us confidence in reporting the 
presence of diacetyl in e-cigarettes. Future 
studies should refine these and other methods 
to further quantify the amount of flavoring 
chemicals in e-cigarettes, and the prevalence 
of diacetyl and alternative flavoring chemicals 
in a wider range of samples. Last, studies need 
to be performed to assess potential differences 
between the particulate and vapor contribu-
tion to exposure and test other environmental 
conditions, including variability in humidity, 
differences in smoker draw time/pressures, and 
different designs of the vaporization systems. 
For example, Zhang et al. (2013) showed 
that puffs generated smaller peak particle sizes 
than did drawing at a constant rate, which 
has implications for where inhaled particles 
will penetrate in the lungs. A standardized 
protocol for evaluating emissions (particulate 
and vapors) of e-cigarettes would facilitate 
interpretation of study results.
Conclusion
Our findings confirm the presence of diacetyl 
and other flavoring chemicals in flavored 
e-cigarettes. Because of the associations 
between diacetyl and bronchiolitis obliterans 
and other severe respiratory diseases among 
workers inhaling heated vapors containing 
diacetyl, urgent action is recommended 
to further evaluate the extent of this new 
exposure to diacetyl and related flavoring 
compounds in e-cigarettes.
