Abstract
Background: As global initiatives increase patient access to surgical treatments, there remains a need to understand the
adverse effects of surgery and define appropriate levels of perioperative care.
Methods: We designed a prospective international 7-day cohort study of outcomes following elective adult inpatient surgery
in 27 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital complications. Secondary outcomes were death following a complica-
tion (failure to rescue) and death in hospital. Process measures were admission to critical care immediately after surgery or
to treat a complication and duration of hospital stay. A single definition of critical care was used for all countries.
Results: A total of 474 hospitals in 19 high-, 7 middle- and 1 low-income country were included in the primary analysis. Data
included 44 814 patients with a median hospital stay of 4 (range 2–7) days. A total of 7508 patients (16.8%) developed one or more
postoperative complication and 207 died (0.5%). The overall mortality among patients who developed complications was 2.8%.
Mortality following complications ranged from 2.4% for pulmonary embolism to 43.9% for cardiac arrest. A total of 4360 (9.7%)
patients were admitted to a critical care unit as routine immediately after surgery, of whom 2198 (50.4%) developed a complication,
with 105 (2.4%) deaths. A total of 1233 patients (16.4%) were admitted to a critical care unit to treat complications, with 119 (9.7%)
deaths. Despite lower baseline risk, outcomes were similar in low- and middle-income compared with high-income countries.
Conclusions: Poor patient outcomes are common after inpatient surgery. Global initiatives to increase access to surgical
treatments should also address the need for safe perioperative care.

About 310 million patients undergo surgery worldwide each
year, with more procedures taking place in high-income coun-
tries.1 2 Findings from epidemiological studies suggest that 4.8
billion people are unable to access safe surgical treatments,3
and that at least 143 million additional procedures are required
each year, primarily in low- and middle-income countries.4 5
However, as health care systems develop to improve access to
surgical treatments, the number of patients who suffer postop-
erative complications will also increase.3 4
Postoperative complications increase treatment costs6 and
reduce both life expectancy and quality of life.7 8 Nonetheless,
our global understanding of outcomes after surgery remains
limited. Estimates from high-income countries suggest postop-
erative complications occur in up to 20% of patients,9 10 and

Clinical Practice
 short-term mortality varies from 1 to 4%.11–18 While effective
perioperative care is considered essential to the safe provision
of surgical treatments,8 the optimal level of such care has not
been defined. Admission to a critical care unit is often consid-
ered necessary to prevent or treat life-threatening complica-
tions. However, this level of patient care is very expensive and
there is little or no evidence to confirm the critical care resource
provision needed for a safe surgical service.
As we seek to ensure the global availability of surgical treat-
ments to all patients, we need to understand how often patients
develop complications after surgery, the severity of harm that
results, and how hospital systems should be configured to
safely
respond.
We
performed
the
International
Surgical
Outcomes Study (ISOS) to evaluate the global incidence and risk
factors for complications and death after inpatient elective sur-
gery and to describe current standards of postoperative care.
Methods
Project organisation
ISOS was a 7-day international cohort study. Regulatory require-
ments differed between countries, with some requiring research
ethics approval and some requiring only data governance
approval. In the UK, the study was approved by the Yorkshire &
Humber Research Ethics Committee (reference: 13/YH/0371).
The inclusion criteria were all adult patients (age �18 years)
undergoing elective surgery with a planned overnight stay in
the hospital. Each participating country selected a single data
collection week between April and August 2014. Patients under-
going emergency surgery, day-case surgery or radiological
procedures were excluded. Patient data included only that
recorded as part of routine care. In some countries, patient
consent was sought to allow the collection of supplementary
data for prespecified substudies. In each country we approached
individuals to act as national coordinators using contacts in
national and international specialist societies in surgery and
anaesthesia. Individual participating hospitals were then identi-
fied through a global online recruitment campaign led by the
study management group and through the direct approach of
the national coordinators. Nominations for participation were
then confirmed as appropriate through discussion with national
coordinators. The study website provided all study documenta-
tion and guidance on study procedures (www.isos.org.uk/docu
ments). ISOS was registered prospectively with an international
trial registry (ISRCTN51817007).
Data collection
Data describing perioperative care facilities were collected for
each hospital at the beginning of the study. Data describing con-
secutive patients were collected until hospital discharge on
paper case record forms (Supplementary file). Complications
were assessed according to predefined criteria and graded as
mild, moderate, or severe.19 Data were censored at 30 days fol-
lowing surgery for patients who remained in the hospital. Data
were anonymised before entry onto a secure Internet-based
electronic case record form designed specifically for ISOS, which
incorporated automated checks for plausibility, consistency and
completeness.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was in-hospital postoperative
complications. Secondary outcomes were death following a
postoperative complication (failure to rescue) and in-hospital
mortality. Process measures were admission directly to critical
care after surgery, admission to critical care for treatment of a
postoperative complication, and duration of hospital stay. A sin-
gle prospective definition of critical care was used for all coun-
tries (a facility routinely capable of admitting patients who
require invasive ventilation overnight).
Statistical analysis
We aimed to recruit as many hospitals and countries as possible
and asked investigators in those hospitals to enrol all eligible
patients. No formal sample size calculation was performed.
Only hospitals returning valid data describing �10 patients and
countries with �10 participating hospitals were included in the
primary analysis.
Association between surgical procedure category and
patient outcomes
We assessed the association between surgical procedure cate-
gory and complications or mortality both before and after
adjustment for potential confounding factors. The unadjusted
analysis was performed using a logistic regression model with
the surgical procedure category included as a fixed factor. The
adjusted analysis was performed using a three-level mixed-
effects logistic regression model. Patients were entered at the
first level, hospitals at the second level, and countries at the
third level. This model accounted for correlation between
patients in the same hospital or country. The following varia-
bles were included as fixed factors in the model: age, current
smoker, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical
status score, severity of surgery, surgical procedure category,
and presence of ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes
mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, cir-
rhosis, stroke, or other comorbid diseases. Factors were selected
for biological plausibility, scientific rationale, and a low rate of
missing data. We used restricted cubic splines to account for a
potential non-linear association between age and outcome.20 To
assess the effect of predefined exclusions on our findings, we
repeated our analyses for all patients in the database. For both
the unadjusted and adjusted analyses, Hosmer–Lemeshow
goodness-of-fit statistics were used to test model calibration
and multicollinearity was assessed using the variance inflation
factor. The ability of the model to discriminate cases from non-
cases was assessed using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC). Data are presented as mean (SD)

 and median [interquartile range (IQR)] for continuous data,
number (%) for binary data, or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs). Analyses were performed using Stata 14
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Data describing 44 814 patients were collected from 474 hospi-
tals in the following countries and regions: Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, The Netherlands,
New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uganda, UK, and USA (Fig. 1). Fewer
than 10 hospitals participated in India, Iraq, and Mexico, and in
accordance
with
the
prospective
statistical
analysis
plan,
patients recruited in these countries were excluded from the
primary analysis (Fig. 2). Seven countries were classed as middle
income and one as low income, with 134 participating hospitals
between them.21 Hospitals had a median of 550 (range 329–850)
ward beds and 21 (range 10–38) critical care beds. The median
critical care capacity (ratio of critical care beds to total hospital
beds) was 4% (IQR 2–6). A total of 310 hospitals (66%) were affili-
ated with a university. Seventy-seven percent of hospitals pro-
vided only government funded health care, 3% only privately
funded health care, and 21% were funded by both sources.
Baseline patient data are presented in Table 1.
Data validation
There was high concordance in a random 1% data sample
selected for duplicate entry (95% for categorical variables, 92%
for continuous variables), with very high concordance for clini-
cal outcomes (99.7%). Investigators were granted immediate
access to their uncleaned data once this was locked following
entry and were encouraged to review it for accuracy and com-
pleteness. All national coordinators confirmed the face validity
of the baseline and crude outcome data for their countries. Only
a small proportion of patients [451/44 814 (1%)] were missing
data for at least one of the factors included in the model. Due to
the low proportion of missing data, we performed a complete
case analysis where patients with missing data were excluded
from the analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Hosmer–Lemeshow
goodness-of-fit statistics indicated that the models were well
calibrated, with a good match between observed and expected
outcomes. Discrimination of the model was good, with an
AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.80–0.81). Residuals showed that the
assumptions for regression analyses were met. All variables had
a variance inflation factor of <5.
Clinical outcomes
A total of 7508 (16.8%) patients developed complications in
the hospital and 207 died before hospital discharge (0.5%),
indicating an overall mortality among patients who devel-
oped complications (failure to rescue) of 2.8%. A total of 5254
(11.7%) patients developed a single postoperative complica-
tion, while another 2254 (5.0%) patients developed two or
more complications. The breakdown of complications is pre-
sented in Table 2. Infectious complications were the most fre-
quent, in particular superficial surgical site infections. A total
of
2925
patients
developed
an
unspecified
complication
(‘other’
category).
There
were
significant
variations
in
complications and mortality across surgical procedure cate-
gories and countries (Fig. 3, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
Outcomes for patients according to planned admission to crit-
ical care immediately after surgery are presented in Table 3. A
total of 1233 patients (16.4%) were admitted to a critical care
unit to treat complications, of whom 119 (9.7%) died. Fifty-
eight (28.0%) patients who died were not admitted to critical
care at any stage during their admission, either immediately
after surgery or for treatment of a complication. The clinical
outcomes for all patients included in the database are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table 4.
Process measures
The median stay in a post-anaesthetic care unit was 1 (IQR 0–2)
h. A total of 4360 (9.7%) patients were admitted to a critical care
unit as routine immediately after surgery. The median length of
time spent in critical care for those with a planned admission
directly after surgery was 1 (IQR 1–3) day. Of these patients, 2198
(50.4%) developed a complication, with 105 (2.4%) deaths. A total
of 1233 (4.9%) patients were admitted to a critical care unit to
treat complications, of whom 119 (9.7%) died. The median
length of time spent in critical care for patients admitted to treat
a complication was 3 (IQR 1–6) days. The median overall hospi-
tal stay was 4 (IQR 2–7) days, increasing to 8 (IQR 5–14) days
among those patients who developed complications.

 Outcomes in low-, middle-, and high-income countries
Patient outcomes and process measures according to low- and
middle- or high-income country status are presented in Table 4.
One country in the low- and middle-income groups, which
returned a large patient sample, experienced much lower com-
plication rates than other participating nations. Patients in low-
and middle-income countries tended to be younger with lower
ASA scores. Crude complication rates were lower, but mortality
rates overall, and for patients developing complications, were
similar to those in high-income countries, suggesting care for
patients who develop complications may be less effective.
There was a much lower rate of planned admission to critical
care immediately after surgery in low- and middle-income
countries.
Discussion
This
international
prospective
cohort
study
has
provided
detailed outcome data on a population of >44 000 consecutive
patients undergoing elective inpatient surgery in 27 low-, mid-
dle-, and high-income countries worldwide. The principal
finding was that 1 in 6 patients experienced a complication
before hospital discharge and 1 in 35 patients who experienced
a complication subsequently died without leaving the hospital.
The mortality among patients who developed complications
(failure to rescue) of 2.8% indicates the continued need for a
more effective treatment response for patients who develop
postoperative complications. Despite lower baseline risk, crude
patient outcomes were broadly similar in low- and middle-
income compared with high-income countries.

International Surgical Outcomes Study group
 There are few large datasets of complication rates after sur-
gery, and none we are aware of which provide data at an inter-
national level, although the findings of a recent study of almost
11 000 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in 58
low-, middle-, and high-income countries indicate high mortal-
ity following such procedures.22 Caution should be exercised
when comparing between country-level datasets because of
international differences in patterns of surgical disease and
genetic backgrounds, as well as in health care systems. A varia-
ble degree of selection bias is also likely to result in important
differences between reports that are few in number. While over-
all complication rates in the current data were slightly lower
than those previously reported in the USA,9 23 this might simply
be due to differences in patient risk factors and the surgical
procedures included. In particular, ISOS only included patients
undergoing elective surgery. Previous mortality estimates for
unselected patient populations undergoing inpatient surgery
vary between 1 and 4%.15–18 A recent study of postoperative
mortality in Europe suggested in-hospital mortality of 3% for
elective inpatient surgery,11 similar to overall mortality rates in
reports from the USA.9 16 23
These data provide detailed insights into patterns of critical
care admission after surgery. This is an expensive resource, and
rates of admission in low- and middle-income countries appear
to be much lower than in high-income countries. The value of
routine admission of high-risk patients to a critical care unit
after surgery remains uncertain and allocation of this resource
appears inconsistent. For example, admission to critical care
after cardiac surgery is routine in most countries, while high-
risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery may not be pro-
vided with this level of care despite a much higher mortality
rate.12–14 The findings of two recent health care registry studies
in the UK suggest that provision of critical care can improve sur-
vival for surgical patients, although the effect may be subtle.24 25
Meanwhile, a study of Medicare registry data in the USA failed
to
identify
any
benefit
of
critical
care
admission.26

Global patient outcomes after elective surgery
|
605
 Comparison of failure to rescue (rate of death after postopera-
tive complications) between hospitals and health care systems
could help us to understand the impact of postoperative critical
care on patient outcomes. While it seems unlikely that we could
ever reduce mortality from postoperative complications to zero,
failure to rescue has provided a useful metric of the quality of
postoperative care for surgical patients in high-income coun-
tries.9 28–31 We could argue that in a well-resourced system, very
few patients should die after elective surgery without being
admitted to a critical care unit. The current data confirm there
is an important rate of failure to rescue at a global level, which
is placed in context by the rates of use of critical care facilities.
Global strategies to improve access to surgical treatments
should take account of the increased demand for perioperative
care services, in particular critical care, for patients who develop
complications.3 4 While the surgical population is very large,
few countries have any reliable system to monitor the volume
of activity and clinical outcomes. Understanding the safety and
effectiveness of surgical treatments is therefore limited and the
need remains for robust audit and public reporting of outcomes
after all surgery worldwide.8 Data-driven improvement in the
quality of perioperative care might be possible even in resource-
limited environments.32
A strengths of this study is the large number of consecutive
patients enrolled worldwide. Importantly, critical care beds
were classified according to a standard definition in participat-
ing
hospitals.
We
also
distinguished
between
planned
admission to critical care immediately after surgery as a part of
routine postoperative management and unplanned admission
to critical care to treat a life-threatening complication. By devel-
oping a very simple dataset consisting primarily of categorical
variables, we were able to minimise the amount of missing
data. Patient-level variables were selected on the basis that they
were objective, routinely collected for clinical reasons, could be
transcribed with a high level of accuracy, subject to a low rate of
missing data, and relevant to a risk adjustment model that
included a wide variety of surgical procedures. The online data
entry system was designed specifically for ISOS and included a
variety of internal error checks while avoiding the redundant
functionality of generic software designed for complex trials.
The study also has a number of weaknesses. Despite the large
sample size, we cannot consider this study as representative of
current practice in all countries. ISOS was a pragmatic study and
only a small proportion of hospitals took part in a small number
of countries. While we are pleased to have recruited hospitals in
30 countries, only 27 of these reached the predefined number of
participating hospitals. We discussed participation with poten-
tial investigators in a number of countries who did not feel they
had adequate resources to take part. This affected the participa-
tion of low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Many patients
were enrolled in university hospitals while smaller, low-volume
centres are underrepresented. This effect was greater in the low-
and middle-income countries that took part. The risk adjust-
ment methods used might not fully account for high mortality

International Surgical Outcomes Study group
 rates in hospitals specialising in more complex surgery. After
risk adjustment there were differences in postoperative out-
comes between countries, but there are likely to be differences in
case mix that are not fully represented in our baseline data.12 We
note that crude complication and mortality rates were lower in
one high-volume country, reducing the overall event rate. Given
the pragmatic nature of this study, it was only possible to follow
patients until hospital discharge. In countries where the avail-
ability of hospital beds is more limited, early hospital discharge
of patients could have resulted in a lower measured complica-
tion rate. Although we planned to enrol every eligible patient
undergoing surgery during the study period, we cannot be sure
of the exact proportion of eligible patients included. Despite
these limitations, assuming the volume of surgery during the
cohort week is typical of the participating hospitals, these
centres perform >3 million inpatient surgical procedures each
year, �1% of the estimated volume of surgery taking place
worldwide.12
Conclusions
The findings of this international cohort study indicate that a
large number of patients develop complications after elective
inpatient surgery. Global strategies to improve access to surgical
treatments should take account of the increased demand placed
on perioperative care services.
Table 2. Postoperative complications and mortality for 44 814 patients undergoing elective surgery. Data presented as n (%). ARDS, acute
respiratory distress syndrome; N/A, category not applicable for this complication. Some patients may have developed more than one
complication and consequently, in some cases, the denominator is the number of complications while in the left-most column the
denominator is the number of patients. The cell at the bottom of the far right column represents the number of deaths divided by the
number of patients with at least one complication
