ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a crucial period for bone development, and exercise can enhance bone acquisition during this period of life. However,
it is not known how the different loading sports practiced can affect bone acquisition in adolescent male athletes. Therefore, the
purpose of the present study was to determine the 1-year longitudinal bone acquisition among adolescent males involved in
osteogenic (football) and non-osteogenic (swimming and cycling) sports and to compare with active controls. A total of 116
adolescent males aged 12 to 14 years at baseline were followed for 1 year: 37 swimmers, 37 footballers, 28 cyclists, and 14 active
controls. Bone mineral content (BMC) was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); cross-sectional area (CSA), cross-
sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), and section modulus (Z) at the femoral neck was assessed using hip structural analysis (HSA); and
bone texture of the lumbar spine was assessed using trabecular bone score (TBS). Serum N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I
(PINP), isomer of the Carboxi-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-I), total serum calcium, and 25 hydroxyvitamin
D [25(OH)D] were analyzed. Footballers had significantly higher adjusted BMC at the lumbar spine (7.0%) and femoral neck (5.0%)
compared with cyclists, and significantly greater BMC at the lumbar spine (6.9%) compared with swimmers. Footballers presented
significantly greater TBS (4.3%) compared with swimmers, and greater CSMI (10.2%), CSA (7.1%), Z (8.9%) and TBS (4.2%) compared
with cyclists. No differences were noted between cyclists and swimmers, both groups had similar bone acquisition compared with
controls. PINP was significantly higher in footballers and controls compared with cyclists and swimmers (3.3% to 6.0%), and 25(OH)D
was significantly higher in footballers and cyclists compared with swimmers and controls (9.9% to 13.1%). These findings suggest
that bone acquisition is higher in adolescent male footballers compared with swimmers and cyclists at the femoral neck and lumbar
spine sites of the skeleton. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
P
uberty is a period of life associated with a rapid increase in
bone mass.(1,2) Low bone mass during adolescence is
associated with increased fracture risk and osteoporosis later in
life.(3–5) The increasing prevalence of fractures for boys is
expected to increase by 24%,(6) and the economic burden of
fractures will cost £5465 (s6723) million per year by 2025.(7) The
childhood and adolescent years are critical for bone acquisition
with up to 43% of peak bone mass (PBM) acquired during the
5-year period surrounding the peak height velocity.(8,9) The
factors affecting PBM during growth include non-modifiable
factors, such as genetics,(10) and modifiable factors, such as
nutrition (eg, calcium and vitamin D)(11,12) and physical
activity.(13–15) Exercise and sports participation can enhance
bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD)
during youth,(16,17) and the benefits can be maintained into
adulthood.(18,19) However, not all types of exercise and sports are
beneficial for bone development. Participation in football can
augment BMC at the loaded sites of the skeleton,(20,21) whereas
participation in swimming and cycling may have a negative or
no impact on bone outcomes,(22,23) which may predispose to a
suboptimal PBM.
With football, cycling, and swimming being among the most
popular sports globally,(24) there is limited evidence comparing
the impact of these sports on bone development.(25) To date,

 only cross-sectional studies have evaluated the impact of these
“osteogenic” and “non-osteogenic” sports on bone outcomes
compared with controls in adolescent males,(25–27) showing
higher bone outcomes in those participating in osteogenic
sports. However, despite controlling for important confounders,
the cross-sectional design precludes any determination of
casual relationship between the differences observed between
the groups.(28) Therefore, longitudinal studies that can identify
sport-specific bone development patterns may be appropriate
but are not available to date. Previous longitudinal studies
comparing bone acquisition between sports focused only on
females and include sports other than football, cycling, and
swimming.(17,29–31) A 1-year longitudinal study in adolescent
female athletes found that the osteogenic effect of rhythmic
gymnastics induced greater bone mass gain at loaded sites of
the skeleton compared with swimming participation.(17) The
investigation of females and specific weight-bearing sports
cannot allow generalization of the bone acquisition in adoles-
cent males or in other sports because of the fact that bone mass
gain depends on specific mechanical stimuli that differs
between the type of sports practiced during adolescence(32)
and because of the hormonal and body composition differences
between sexes.(33) In addition, there are no longitudinal studies
using a comprehensive analysis of important confounders, such
as lean mass and objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA),(34) comparing the effect of swimming,
football, and cycling participation on bone outcomes in
adolescent male athletes.
Most studies have used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) to evaluate BMC, areal BMD, and bone area(16,20) because
of its low cost, radiation, and availability.(35) However, there are
few studies using techniques such as hip structural analysis
(HSA) to assess bone geometry estimates at the clinically
relevant site of the femoral neck in adolescents.(21,36) Previously,
8 months of football participation induced greater acquisition in
cross-sectional area (CSA), cross-sectional moment of inertia
(CSMI), section modulus, and subperiosteal width compared
with swimming participation in adolescent female athletes.(37)
However, there are no longitudinal studies available in
adolescent males. Moreover, there are no studies in adolescent
athletes using the recently developed trabecular bone score
(TBS), which can predict fracture risk(38) and fragility of the
lumbar spine.(39,40) Furthermore, there are no longitudinal
studies on the effects of sport participation on bone turnover
and nutrition markers, such as N-terminal propeptide of
procollagen type I (PINP), isomer of the Carboxi-terminal
telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-I), total serum calcium,
and 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which can further explain
bone formation and resorption in relation to the sports
practiced.(41–43)
Therefore, the scope of the present investigation was to
determine the longitudinal (1-year) differences on clinically
relevant DXA-measured BMC sites, hip geometry estimates, TBS,
and bone turnover and nutritional markers in adolescent male
athletes engaged in football, swimming, and cycling and active
controls aged 12 to 14 years at baseline.
Participants and Methods
Cohort and study design
The present study shows a 12-month longitudinal analysis of
sport participation as part of the longitudinal PRO-BONE (effect
of a PROgram of short bouts of exercise on BONE health in
adolescents
involved
in
different
sports)
study,
whose
purpose, methodology, and inclusion/exclusion criteria have
been described elsewhere.(44) For the present study, the
measurements completed at baseline (T0) in autumn/winter
2014–15 and 1 year later (T1) in autumn/winter 2015–16
(mean
difference
of
visits ¼ 1
year
and
7
days).
Five
participants were excluded in the present study because
they did not complete the second visit (n ¼ 3) or they had
missing data in any of the variables included (n ¼ 2). Therefore,
116 adolescent males (13.1 years � 1.0 at T0 and 14.1
years � 1.0 at T1) were included: 37 swimmers, 37 footballers,
and 28 cyclists engaged in these sports more than 3 hours per
week the last 3 or more years and 14 active controls not
engaged in these sports more than 3 hours per week the last 3
or more years.
Outcome measures: DXA, HSA, TBS, and biochemical
analyses
A DXA scanner (GE Lunar Prodigy Healthcare Inc, Wisconsin,
USA) was used to measure BMC (g), fat mass (g), and lean mass
(g). The lumbar spine (LS, L1 to L4) and bilateral proximal femora
scans were used to assess BMC. All DXA scans and subsequent
in-software analyses were completed by the same researcher,
using the same DXA scanner and the enCORE software version
14.10.022
(GE Healthcare Inc, Wisconsin, USA) following
previous guidelines.(35) The coefficient of variation was not
determined in the present study. Previous pediatric studies have
shown that the DXA percentage coefficient of variation (CV) was
between 1.0% and 2.9% depending on the region.(45)
The hip geometry estimates of the femoral neck were
obtained and the following variables used: 1) the CSA (mm2),
which is the total bone surface area of the hip, excluding the soft
tissue area and the trabecular bone; 2) the CSMI (mm4), which is
an index of structural rigidity and reflects the distribution of
mass in the center of a structural element; and 3) section
modulus (Z, mm3), which is an indicator of maximum bending
strength in a cross section. The CVs of these variables were
previously found to be between 7.9% and 11.7%.(46)
TBS is a DXA-based technological tool that provides an
indirect textural index of trabecular microarchitecture in the
lumbar spine and has been shown to significantly predict
fracture risk independently of BMC.(38) TBS assesses DXA images
of the lumbar spine scans using a gray-level analysis as the slope
at the origin of the log-log representation of the experimental
variogram.(47) All TBS analyses were performed by the same
trained researcher using the TBS iNsight Software (Medimaps,
research version 3.0, Pessac, France). The calculation was
performed at the lumbar spine region of interest as in the
BMC measurement. The CVs of TBS in relation to BMC has been
reported to be from 1.1% to 1.9%.(40)
Capillary blood samples were collected at a non-training
weekend day in the morning in heparin fluoride–coated
microvettes (CB 300 tubes, Sarstedt Ltd, Leicester, UK) and
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. Serum samples
were stored at –80°C until analysis in a single session. Total
serum levels of PINP, CTX-I, 25(OH)D, and total calcium were
analyzed following guidelines.(48) ELISA kits (Abbexa Ltd,
Cambridge, UK) for PINP (test range, 6 to 400 pg � mL�1;
sensitivity, 1.2 pg � mL�1; inter- and intra-assay CVs, 3.1% and
8.2%, respectively), CTX-I (test range, 0.1 to 7.0 ng � mL�1;
sensitivity, 0.03 ng � mL�1; inter- and intra-assay CVs, 4.9% and
2270

 6.8%, respectively), and 25(OH)D (test range, 3 to 80 ng � mL�1;
sensitivity, 1.2 ng � mL�1; inter- and intra-assay CVs, 6.1% and
8.6%, respectively) were used. Total calcium serum was
measured using direct colorimetric assay (Cayman Chemical
Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and had a sensitivity of
0.25 mg � dL�1 and the absorbance was read at 570 to 590 nm
(inter- and intra-assay CVs, 5.1% and 7.3%, respectively).
Other measures
Stature (cm) and body mass (kg) were measured by using a
stadiometer (Harpenden, Holtain Ltd, Crymych, UK) and an
electronic scale (Seca 877, Seca Ltd, Birmingham, UK), respec-
tively. Sexual maturation was self-reported using adapted
drawingsofthefivestages(Tanner)ofpubichairdevelopment.(49)
Daily habitual physical activity was measured for 7 consecu-
tive days at T0 and T1 using wrist accelerometers (GENEA,
Cambridgeshire,
UK).
The
validity
and
reliability
of
the
accelerometer has been established previously in children and
adolescents.(50) Data were collected at 100 Hz and analyzed at 1-
second epoch intervals to establish time spent in MVPA using a
cut-off point of �1140 counts per minute previously validated in
youth.(50) Weekly training hours were obtained by face-to-face
interviews at T0 at T1.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS IBM statistics
(version 21.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). Data were checked
for normality using Shapiro-Wilk’s test, skewness and kurtosis
values, and presented as mean and standard deviation. Data
analysis was completed in two stages: 1) unadjusted data using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc
comparisons and chi-square tests used to detect between-
group differences on bone outcomes (DXA and HSA, TBS) and
biochemical markers, and 2) adjusted data using one-way
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc to
detect the differences between the groups at T1 using age,
height, lean mass, MVPA, and the bone outcomes at T0 as
covariates.(14,34,51) Preliminary analyses showed that bone
outcome results did not change when maturation stage was
used as a confounder instead of age. Thus maturation was not
included in the model. Percentages of differences between
groups for all variables were calculated. Significance was set at
p < 0.05 and p < 0.01.
Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive characteristics of the partic-
ipants at T0 and T1. At T1, swimmers were older, taller, heavier,
and had more lean mass than the footballers. Swimmers were
more mature than footballers and controls. Swimmers trained
more hours and years than cyclists. Footballers spent more time
doing MVPA than swimmers and controls. In addition, foot-
ballers trained more hours and years than cyclists and
swimmers. Cyclists were older than controls. Cyclists spent
more time doing MVPA compared with swimmers and controls.
Controls had more body fat percentage than all the sport
groups. From T0 to T1, all the descriptive characteristics for all
groups increased significantly except body fat percentage,
which reduced significantly in the sport groups, and MVPA,
which decreased significantly in all groups. Results of unad-
justed bone outcomes are presented in Supplemental Table S1.
Longitudinal adjusted differences in BMC acquisition
between groups
BMC-adjusted results for lumbar spine and femoral neck are
presented at Fig. 1 and Table 2. At T1, footballers presented
significantly greater BMC at the lumbar spine (7.0%) and femoral
neck (5.0%) compared with cyclists. Also, footballers had
significantly greater BMC at the lumbar spine (6.9%) and a
similar BMC at the femoral neck (2.3%) compared with
swimmers. Footballers had higher but not significant BMC at
the lumbar spine (6.0%) and femoral neck (2.7%) compared with
controls at T1. Cyclists had similar BMC at the lumbar spine
(–1.0%) and femoral neck (–2.3%) compared with controls.
Swimmers had similar BMC at the lumbar spine (–0.8%) and
femoral neck (0.4%) compared with controls. In addition,
swimmers had similar BMC at the lumbar spine (0.2%) and
femoral neck (2.7%) compared with cyclists.
Longitudinal adjusted differences in HSA and TBS
acquisition between groups
Results of adjusted bone geometry acquisition are presented at
Fig. 2 and Table 2. At T1, footballers presented significantly
greater TBS (4.3%) compared with swimmers, greater CSMI
(10.2%), CSA (7.1%), Z (8.9%), and TBS (4.2%) compared with
cyclists, and similar CSMI, CSA, Z, and TBS compared with
controls (2.6% to 7.8%). In addition, swimmers had similar CSMI,
CSA, and Z (1.0% to 4.2%) and similar TBS (–0.1%) compared with
cyclists. Swimmers had similar CSMI, CSA, and Z (–0.1% to 0.7%)
and non-similar TBS (–1.6%) compared with controls. Finally,
cyclists had similar CSMI, CSA, Z, and TBS (–0.3% to –4.0%)
compared with controls.
Longitudinal bone turnover and nutrition marker
between groups
The biochemical markers are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3. At T0,
there were no significant differences between the groups in any
of the biochemical markers. After 1 year of sport participation
(T1), bone formation (PINP) was significantly higher in foot-
ballers than swimmers (3.3%) and cyclists (6.0%). In addition,
footballers had significantly higher 25(OH)D compared with
swimmers (12.9%) and controls (13.1%). Cyclists had signifi-
cantly lower PINP than controls (5.1%), but they had significantly
higher 25(OH)D compared with swimmers (9.9%) and controls
(11.1%).
CTX-I (14.8%) and 25(OH)D (4.7%) significantly increased from
T0 to T1 in footballers, whereas PINP did not change compared
with the other groups. In swimmers, there was a significant
decrease in PINP (5.8%) and a significant increase in CTX-I (9.8%)
from T0 to T1. Similarly, in cyclists, PINP significantly decreased
(7.2%) and CTX-I non-significantly increased (4.3%) from T0 to
T1.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study
that has evaluated bone acquisition in adolescent male athletes
and used comprehensive methodology to assess bone status by
combining DXA, HSA, TBS, and biochemical markers. The main
findings of the present study show that: 1) the osteogenic
responses of football participation over 1 year induced
significantly greater bone acquisition in BMC, hip geometry

 estimates, and TBS compared with that of swimming and cycling
after accounting for relevant confounders; 2) participation in
cycling and swimming did not induce significant gains in any
bone outcomes and cyclists had similar bone acquisition
compared with controls; 3) footballers had significantly higher
PINP than both non-osteogenic sports and significantly higher
25(OH)D concentration compared with swimmers and controls
at T1, and PINP significantly decreased over time both in cyclists
and

 Longitudinal BMC acquisition between groups
In the present study, footballers gained significantly higher BMC
at the lumbar spine compared with cyclists and swimmers and
also gained significantly higher femoral neck BMC compared
with cyclists. Also, footballers gained similar BMC than controls
at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Previous evidence in
female footballers and swimmers aged 15.9 to 16.2 years
compared BMD gains after 8 months of training and found that
BMD at lumbar spine and hip was significantly increased in
footballers but not in swimmers,(37) which is in line with the
findings of the present study. The differences observed in BMC
acquisition among the sports groups in the present longitudinal
study might be explained by the loading patterns, such as
plyometric exercises, included in the football training that can
induce higher impact and bone adaptations in adolescent
athletes.(52) A different study in male footballers aged 12.9 years
showed that 1 year of football training induced significantly
higher gains in BMC at lumbar spine and total hip compared
with active controls aged 12.5 years,(20) which is similar with the
unadjusted findings of the present investigation. The similar
BMC between the non-osteogenic groups (swimmers and
cyclists) in the current study might be explained by the low
repeated loading applied in the skeleton during participation in
these sports, which might not be enough to produce positive
bone adaptations.(21)
Longitudinal HSA and TBS acquisition between groups
The present findings show that football participation for
1 year induced significantly greater acquisition in bone
geometry
estimates
compared
with
cyclists
and
that
participation
in
non-osteogenic
sports
induced
similar
acquisition in bone geometry estimates compared with
controls. Previous findings in adolescent female footballers
and swimmers showed that 8 months of training in their
respective sports induced a significant increase in CSA of the
narrow neck in footballers compared with swimmers.(37) The
geometrical differences between footballers and cyclists in
the present study indicate that the continuous unloading
environment of cycling may delay the corticalization of the
bone structure despite the fewer hours of training in cyclists
compared with footballers (5.6 versus 9.4 hours). In swimmers,
the continuous unloading environment is present, but the
forces applied to the wall in every change of direction during
swimming may induce small adaptations to the femoral neck
site of the skeleton,(53) which might explain the non-
significant difference between footballers and swimmers at
the hip bone geometry estimates.
The present study also includes novel longitudinal findings
using TBS in adolescent athletes, showing that adolescent
footballers had significantly higher improvement in TBS score
compared with cyclists and swimmers. A recent cross-sectional
evaluation in adults showed that participation in repeated
moderate-impact loading sports may result in lower TBS score
and increased fracture risk compared with high-impact loading
sports.(54) The present study indicates that bone texture
acquisition at the lumbar spine may be affected from the
external loading environment after controlling for potential
confounders that have been shown to influence TBS.(39) It can be
speculated that the high-intensity loading impact during
football participation can result in better trabecular structure
at the lumbar spine because of the loading applied both in
vertical and horizontal directions.

 Longitudinal changes in biochemical markers between
and within groups
PINP at T1 was significantly higher in footballers compared with
swimmers and cyclists, whereas the concentrations of PINP
significantly decreased in the non-osteogenic sports from T0 to
T1. In addition, CTX-I significantly increased in footballers and
swimmersfromT0toT1.ThelongitudinalchangesinPINPandCTX-
I suggest an increased bone turnover in footballers and increased
bone resorption in swimmers, which reflect the differences in bone
acquisition between the groups and indicate a contribution of
bone turnover on bone adaptations.(55) A previous longitudinal
study in females showed that gymnasts had significantly higher
bone formation (osteocalcin) levels than swimmers after 1 year of
participation and that the osteocalcin levels decreased in
swimmers but not in gymnasts.(17) The bone resorption findings
of the present study are in line with a previous longitudinal study in
peripubertal girls that did not find significant differences in bone
resorptionbetween gymnasts,runners,andcontrolsafter 1year.(28)
Also, it has been previously shown that bone remodeling might be
increasedbecauseofparticipationinhigh-intensityweight-bearing
activities during puberty,(56,57) which might explain the increased
bone remodeling in footballers.
Regarding the serum calcium and 25(OH)D, there were no
differencesbetweenorwithingroupsinserumcalcium,whereas25
(OH)D levels were significantly higher in footballers and cyclists
compared with swimmers and controls at T1. In addition, 25(OH)D
significantly increased in footballers from T0 to T1, which may
partially contribute to the findings that bone resorption was not
affectedinthisgroupasitwasin theswimmers.Allparticipantshad
insufficient 25(OH)D levels, which agrees with low 25(OH)D levels
previously reported in a European adolescent population.(58) The
higher25(OH)Dlevelsinfootballersandcyclistsmightbeexplained
by the higher exposure to sunlight during training in these sports,
although other parameters such as dietary intake and the sampling
period have been reported to affect 25(OH)D levels.(29)
Strengths and limitations
The present study includes the 1-year longitudinal evaluation of
bone acquisition in adolescent male athletes and a control
group that have never been compared before. In addition, the
combination of three different methods (DXA, HSA, and TBS) to
assess bone development adds novel findings to the literature
by showing for the first time that acquisition in HSA and TBS
parameters differs between adolescent male athletes in

 osteogenic and non-osteogenic sports. Moreover, the serum
bone turnover markers used in this study have been previously
used in a pediatric population(42,55) and are recommended by
the International Osteoporosis Foundation and the International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC)(48) in order to provide
additional information regarding the bone metabolism changes
due to the sports practiced. A limitation of the present study
might be the fewer hours of training in cyclists compared with
footballers and swimmers. However, the study has strong
internal validity because of the comprehensive inclusion criteria
and the objective control of potential confounders, such as
baseline bone values, lean mass, and MVPA measured by
accelerometers. The findings of the present study strongly
suggest that the type of exercise practiced during adolescence
can induce different bone acquisition on clinical relevant sites of
the skeleton, suggesting that weight-bearing activities should
be incorporated during adolescence to optimize peak bone
mass and reduce low bone status later in life.
Conclusions
This longitudinal study demonstrated for first time that bone
acquisition at clinically relevant sites, assessed by BMC, HSA
parameters and TBS, is higher in adolescent male footballers
compared with swimmers and cyclists. There was no difference
between the swimmers and cyclists, and cyclists had similar
bone acquisition compared with controls. Bone formation was
higher in footballers compared with swimmers and cyclists, and
vitamin D levels were higher in footballers and cyclists
compared with swimmers and controls. Bone formation
decreased over time in cyclists and swimmers but not in
footballers or controls, whereas bone resorption increased in
swimmers and footballers. These findings suggest that the
osteogenic 1 year of football participation is beneficial for bone
acquisition and that participation in non-osteogenic sports is
not enough to induce positive bone adaptations. Therefore,
programs to improve bone outcomes of non-osteogenic
athletes during adolescence are required. Further research
with longer follow-up needs to address whether the observed
changes in this study translate into better bone health in
footballers compared with swimmers and cyclists, which could
have important training implications for non-osteogenic sports.
