Combination therapy of bacterial infections with synergistic drug partners offers distinct advantages over monotherapy. Among
these advantages are (i) a reduction of the drug dose required for efficacy, (ii) a reduced potential for drug-induced toxicity, and
(iii) a reduced potential for the emergence of resistance. Here, we describe the synergistic actions of the third-generation oral
cephalosporin cefdinir and TXA709, a new, FtsZ-targeting prodrug that we have developed with improved pharmacokinetics
and enhanced in vivo efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) relative to earlier agents. We show
that the active product of TXA709 (TXA707) acts synergistically with cefdinir in vitro against clinical isolates of MRSA, vanco-
mycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and linezolid-resistant S. aureus (LRSA). In addi-
tion, relative to TXA707 alone, the combination of TXA707 and cefdinir significantly reduces or eliminates the detectable emer-
gence of resistance. We also demonstrate synergy in vivo with oral administration of the prodrug TXA709 and cefdinir in mouse
models of both systemic and tissue (thigh) infections with MRSA. This synergy reduces the dose of TXA709 required for efficacy
3-fold. Viewed as a whole, our results highlight the potential of TXA709 and cefdinir as a promising combination for the treat-
ment of drug-resistant staphylococcal infections.
T
he clinical utility of an antibiotic against its target bacterial
pathogens can become compromised over time by the
emergence of resistant bacteria upon exposure to the antibiotic
(1, 2). One strategy to restrict the emergence of bacterial resis-
tance is to treat infections with combinations of synergistic
antibiotics rather than individual agents (3, 4). Synergistic
combination therapies not only limit the potential for the
emergence of resistance but also reduce the dose of each drug
required for efficacy, thereby providing an added benefit of
reduced potential for toxicity (5, 6). The benefits of synergistic
combination therapies provided us with the impetus to develop
a combination therapeutic approach for treatment with
TXA709, a new, orally bioavailable prodrug that we recently
reported to be associated with improved pharmacokinetics and
enhanced in vivo efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphy-
lococcus aureus (MRSA) in mouse models of both systemic and
tissue infections relative to those of earlier agents (7). The pro-
drug TXA709 can be easily formulated in aqueous acidic vehi-
cles and is rapidly converted to the active benzamide product
TXA707 in the presence of serum (7) (see Fig. S1 in the supple-
mental material for the structures of both compounds).
The biological target of TXA707 is the bacterial protein FtsZ
(7), which forms a ring-like structure (termed the Z-ring) at mid-
cell during cell division (8–10). The Z-ring plays a key role in
constriction of the bacterial cell membrane prior to cytokinesis
and serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of other critical com-
ponents of the cell division machinery (the divisome) (11–13).
Included in these important cell division components are the pen-
icillin binding proteins (PBPs), which catalyze peptidoglycan bio-
synthesis at the septum (8–10, 12, 14, 15). Given the involvement
of FtsZ and the PBPs in a common pathway leading to septum
formation and cell division, we hypothesized that the FtsZ-target-
ing compound TXA707 may act synergistically with drugs that
target the PBPs. In this connection, Tan and coworkers have
shown that the carbapenem imipenem acts synergistically with
an early FtsZ-targeting benzamide PC190723 (15). Here, we
investigate the third-generation oral cephalosporin cefdinir as
a potential synergistic partner for TXA707. We present results
that demonstrate in vitro synergy between TXA707 and cefdinir
against clinical isolates of MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S.
aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and li-
nezolid-resistant S. aureus (LRSA). We also demonstrate in vivo
synergy between the prodrug TXA709 and cefdinir in mouse
models of both systemic and tissue (thigh) infections with
MRSA. The observed synergy translates to a 3-fold reduction in
the oral dose of TXA709 required for efficacy. In addition,
relative to TXA707 alone, the combination of TXA707 and
cefdinir significantly reduces or eliminates the detectable fre-
quency of resistance (FOR) in MRSA, VISA, VRSA, and LRSA
isolates. Thus, combination with cefdinir not only confers the
benefits of synergy but also addresses any issues relating to a
suboptimal FOR that may be associated with FtsZ-targeting
benzamides.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains. MRSA clinical isolates MPW011 to MPW020 and me-
thicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates MPW001 and MPW004 were
provided by Melvin P. Weinstein (Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical
School, New Brunswick, NJ). These strains were isolated from the blood
of patients admitted to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in
New Brunswick, NJ. MRSA strains R2527 and COL were provided by
David R. Andes (University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public
Health, Madison, WI) and Alex G. Therien (Merck & Co., Rahway, NJ),
respectively. MRSA strain ATCC 33591 and MSSA strain ATCC 29213
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Ma-
nassas, VA). VISA isolate Mu3 was provided by George M. Eliopoulos
(Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). All of the other
VISA isolates, as well as all of the VRSA and LRSA isolates, were provided
by the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus
(NARSA) for distribution by BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. The NARSA
website (http://www.narsa.net) describes the location of origin of each
isolate.
Compounds and comparator antibiotics. TXA707 and TXA709 were
synthesized as previously described (7). Vancomycin HCl and oxacillin
(sodium salt) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cef-
dinir and linezolid were obtained from TOKU-E (Bellingham, WA) and
LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN), respectively.
MIC assays. MIC assays were conducted in duplicate according to
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (16). Mi-
crodilution assays with cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton (CAMH) broth
(Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used to determine the MICs
of all agents, with the MIC being defined as the lowest compound or drug
concentration at which no growth is visible after 16 to 24 h of incubation
at 37°C.
Checkerboard titration assay for the detection of synergy in vitro.
The checkerboard titration method was used to evaluate synergy between
TXA707 and cefdinir against MRSA, VISA, VRSA, LRSA, and MSSA iso-
lates. In this assay (performed with 96-well microtiter plates), TXA707
was serially diluted 2-fold in CAMH broth along the rows of the microtiter
plate, while cefdinir was diluted along the columns. The final volume in
each well was 0.1 ml. After the compounds were added, each well was
inoculated with 5 � 105 CFU of log-phase bacteria. The microtiter
plates were incubated aerobically for 16 to 24 h at 37°C, at which point
bacterial growth was visualized. Fractional inhibitory concentrations
(FICs) of the agents in each well that did not exhibit visible growth
compared to agent-free control wells were calculated with the follow-
ing two relationships: (i) FICTXA707 � MIC of TXA707 in combination
with cefdinir/MIC of TXA707 alone; (ii) FICcefdinir � MIC of cefdinir
in combination with TXA707/MIC of cefdinir alone. These FICs allow
the determination of the FIC index (FICI) with the following relation-
ship: FICI � FICTXA707 � FICcefdinir. An FICI of �0.5 indicates syn-
ergy between the two agents, while an FICI between 0.5 and 2.0 indi-
cates additivity.

 Time-kill assays. Exponentially growing MRSA MPW014, VISA
Mu3, VRSA VRS5, and LRSA NRS127 isolates were diluted in CAMH
broth to a final count of �106 CFU/ml. The colony count at time zero
was verified by plating serial dilutions of the culture in duplicate on
tryptic soy agar (TSA; Becton-Dickinson) plates. The initial culture
was aliquoted into tubes containing either 0.5 �g/ml TXA707 (0.5�
MIC), 4 �g/ml cefdinir (�0.06� MIC), or both agents combined. An
equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the
vehicle control tube. The cultures were then incubated at 37°C with
shaking. The number of CFU per milliliter in each culture was deter-
mined over time by withdrawing samples at time points ranging from
3 to 24 h and plating appropriate serial dilutions onto TSA plates. All
TSA plates were incubated at 37°C, and the number of CFU per milliliter
at each time point was determined by counting colonies after 24 h.
Assay for FOR and identification of resistant ftsZ mutations. The
FOR of MRSA, VISA, VRSA, and LRSA isolates to TXA707 alone or in
combination with cefdinir was assayed by using a large-inoculum ap-
proach described elsewhere (17). In these studies, TSA plates were
prepared containing 4 �g/ml TXA707 (4� to 8� MIC) alone or in
combination with cefdinir at concentrations in the range of 1 to 8
�g/ml (�0.5� MIC). All plates were incubated at 37°C and examined
after 48 h. The ftsZ genes of selected resistant mutants were sequenced
as previously described (18).
In vivo synergy studies. Synergy between TXA709 and cefdinir
against MRSA was assessed in vivo by using both a mouse peritonitis
model of systemic infection and a mouse tissue (thigh) model of infection.
For experimental details associated with the in vivo synergy studies, see the
supplemental material.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
TXA707 acts synergistically with cefdinir against clinical iso-
latesofMRSA,VISA,VRSA,andLRSA.Wesoughttoevaluatethe
combination of TXA707 and cefdinir for synergistic activity
against a panel of clinical S. aureus isolates that included MRSA,
VISA, VRSA, and LRSA strains. To this end, we selected 13 MRSA,
4 VISA, 4 VRSA, and 4 LRSA isolates. Note that vancomycin and
linezolid are considered first-line antibiotics for the treatment of
MRSA infections, and thus, VRSA and LRSA infections are of
serious concern in the clinic because of limited therapeutic op-
tions. Significantly, TXA707 exhibits potent activity against all
four types of isolates, with MICs ranging from 0.5 to 1 �g/ml
(Table 1). In contrast, cefdinir is associated with poor activity
against the four isolate types, with MICs ranging from 8 to 1,024
�g/ml (Table 1). Oxacillin, vancomycin, and linezolid (included
as comparator antibiotics) exhibited the expected MIC ranges ver-
sus the four types of isolates tested (see Table S1 in the supplemen-
tal material).
We assayed for synergy between TXA707 and cefdinir by using
a checkerboard titration approach in which bacterial growth inhi-
bition is monitored at differing concentration ratios of the two
agents. These checkerboard assays enabled us to determine FICs at
each combination of agents (as described in Materials and Meth-
ods). Synergy is indicated when the FIC of each agent is �0.25.

function of the FICs of cefdinir for four representative isolates,

 one each of MRSA (MPW014), VISA (Mu3), VRSA (VRS5), and
LRSA (NRS127). Note the presence of combination FICs in the
lower left quadrant of each isobologram (to the left of the dashed
line), an observation demonstrating synergy between TXA707
and cefdinir against each of the four isolates. We obtained similar
results with the other 21 clinical isolates examined (data not
shown).
Another indication of synergy is provided by the FICI,
which is defined as the sum of the FICs of the two agents. An
FICI of �0.5 therefore indicates synergy. Significantly, all of
the FICIs determined from the results of our checkerboard
analyses were �0.375 (Table 1), confirming synergy between
TXA707 and cefdinir against all 25 isolates examined. Compar-
ative studies with three different MSSA isolates (MPW001,
MPW004, and ATCC 29213) revealed additivity between
TXA707 and cefdinir, with the FICI for each MSSA strain being
0.75. Thus, the manifestation of synergy between TXA707 and
cefdinir appears to be associated only with the �-lactam-resis-
tant S. aureus (MRSA, VISA, VRSA, LRSA) isolates. Tan and
coworkers observed similar behavior in their studies combin-
ing imipenem and PC190723 (15).
The synergy between TXA707 and cefdinir against MRSA,
VISA, VRSA, and LRSA is bactericidal in nature. While the
checkerboard titration method assesses inhibitory antibacte-
rial effects, it does not examine bactericidal activity. We there-
fore further characterized the synergistic interaction between
TXA707 and cefdinir by using a time-kill approach. In these
assays, bacterial death was monitored in the presence of
TXA707 alone at 0.5 �g/ml (0.5� MIC), cefdinir alone at 4
�g/ml (0.004� to 0.06� MIC, depending on the isolate), or
TXA707 in combination with cefdinir. Figure 2 shows the re-
sulting kill curves for MRSA MPW014, VISA Mu3, VRSA
VRS5, and LRSA NRS127, the same representative isolates
whose isobolograms are depicted in Fig. 1. In the presence of
subinhibitory concentrations of TXA707 or cefdinir alone, lit-
tle or no killing is evident, with various degrees of bacterial
growth being observed instead. In striking contrast, the com-
bination of TXA707 and cefdinir results in �4-log killing over
24 h, with at least 75% of that killing occurring within 9 h.
These results not only corroborate the synergistic interaction
between TXA707 and cefdinir but also indicate that the syner-
gistic interaction is bactericidal in nature.
In addition to exhibiting synergistic bactericidal activity,
the combination of TXA707 and cefdinir also reduces the
FOR in MRSA, VISA, VRSA, and LRSA isolates. We also ex-
plored how the combination of TXA707 and cefdinir impacts
the potential for the emergence of resistance in MRSA, VISA,
VRSA, and LRSA isolates. In this connection, we used a large-
inoculum approach to assess the FOR associated with 4 �g/ml
TXA707 (4� to 8� MIC) alone and in combination with cef-
dinir at concentrations in the range of 1 to 8 �g/ml (�0.5�
MIC) in 20 of the 25 clinical isolates investigated above (13
MRSA, 3 VISA, 2 VRSA, and 2 LRSA isolates). The FOR of
TXA707 alone was on the order of 10�8 in all 20 isolates exam-
FIG 2 Time-kill curves for clinical isolates MRSA MPW014 (A), VISA Mu3 (B), VRSA VRS5 (C), and LRSA NRS127 (D). Bacteria were treated with DMSO
vehicle (black diamonds), 4 �g/ml (�0.06� MIC) cefdinir alone (red triangles), 0.5 �g/ml (0.5� MIC) TXA707 alone (purple circles), or a combination of 0.5
�g/ml TXA707 and 4 �g/ml cefdinir (blue squares).

 ined (Table 2). Sequencing analysis demonstrates that this FOR
is the result of specific mutations in the ftsZ gene (see Table S2
in the supplemental material) (7). Significantly, the combina-
tion of TXA707 and cefdinir reduced the FOR below detectable
levels (�10�9 to �10�10) in 19 of the 20 isolates tested, while
reducing the FOR by an order of magnitude in the other isolate
(Table 2). Thus, combining TXA707 and cefdinir not only en-
hances antibacterial potency through synergistic interaction
but also reduces the FOR.
The bactericidal synergy observed in vitro is also observed in
vivo in a mouse systemic (peritonitis) model of infection with
MRSA or VISA. We next sought to determine whether the synergy
between TXA707 and cefdinir demonstrated in vitro is also ob-
servable in vivo by using a mouse systemic (peritonitis) model of S.
aureus infection. In all of our in vivo studies, TXA707 was admin-
istered in the form of its readily formulatable prodrug (TXA709),
which we have previously shown rapidly converts to TXA707 in
the presence of mouse serum (with a conversion half-life of
approximately 3 min) (7). Prior to combination studies with
TXA709 and cefdinir, we first determined the minimal efficacious
dose of orally administered TXA709 alone against a lethal infec-
tion with either MRSA MPW014 or VISA Mu3. A dose of TXA709
that results in �50% survival (i.e., �4 out of 6 mice) is viewed as
an efficacious dose. As revealed in Fig. 3A, the minimal efficacious
oral dose of TXA709 against MRSA MPW014 was 96 mg/kg,
which yielded 67% survival (4 out of 6 mice). The corresponding
minimal efficacious oral dose of TXA709 against VISA Mu3 was
144 mg/kg (Fig. 3B), which resulted in 100% survival (6 out of 6
mice).
Armed with the efficacious doses of TXA709 alone versus the
MRSA and VISA isolates, we then examined the impact of com-
bining TXA709 and cefdinir on the oral doses required for efficacy
against the same two isolates. In these studies, TXA709 was ad-
ministered at a dose 3-fold lower than its efficacious dose. As
expected, these low doses of TXA709 (32 mg/kg for MRSA
MPW014 infection and 48 mg/kg for VISA Mu3 infection)
were associated with no survival when the compound was ad-
ministered by itself (Fig. 3C and D). However, when these low
doses of TXA709 were administered in combination with cef-
dinir (at doses of 48 mg/kg for MRSA MPW014 infection and
80 mg/kg for VISA Mu3 infection), we observed an efficacious
response against both infections, with 83% survival in each case
(5 out of 6 mice) (Fig. 3C and D). Note that there were no
survivors when cefdinir was administered alone at the doses
used in the combination treatments (Fig. 3C and D). Thus, the
oral combination of TXA709 and cefdinir is synergistic against
both the MRSA and VISA infections. Importantly, this synergy
lowers the dose of TXA709 required for efficacy 3-fold (from 96
to 32 mg/kg against the MRSA infection and from 144 to 48
mg/kg against the VISA infection).
TXA709 is also synergistic with cefdinir in a mouse tissue
(thigh) model of infection with MRSA. As staphylococcal in-
fections frequently occur in soft tissue, it is of interest to assess
synergistic activity in a tissue model of infection. To this end,
we probed for the synergistic actions of orally administered
TXA709 and cefdinir in a mouse tissue (thigh) model of infec-
tion with MRSA ATCC 33591. An oral dose of TXA709 alone at
40 mg/kg was not associated with an efficacious response, and

 an oral dose of cefdinir alone at 200 mg/kg yielded only a 1-log
reduction in the bacterial CFU count relative to that associated
with vehicle treatment (Fig. 4). In contrast, the combination of
40 mg/kg TXA709 and 200 mg/kg cefdinir was associated with
a robust efficacious response, yielding a 4-log reduction in the
bacterial CFU count relative to that associated with vehicle
treatment. We have previously shown that orally administered
TXA709 alone is efficacious in this infection model at a dose of
120 mg/kg (7). Thus, as observed in the mouse peritonitis
model, synergistic combination with cefdinir lowers the oral
dose of TXA709 required for efficacy in the thigh infection
model 3-fold (from 120 to 40 mg/kg). Additional thigh infec-
tion model studies with VRSA VRS2 also revealed synergistic
activity with the oral combination of TXA709 and cefdinir (see
Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).
Concluding remarks. For two drugs to be useful in combi-
nation therapy, they must be efficacious at doses and dosage
frequencies that are clinically achievable and safe. With regard
to cefdinir, the maximal recommended daily dose in adults and
children is 14 mg/kg (19). The recommended allometric scal-
ing for conversion of a mouse dose to its human-equivalent
dose is to divide the mouse dose by 12.3 (20). Applying this
allometric scaling to the cefdinir doses used in our four mouse
synergy studies yields human-equivalent cefdinir doses of 3.9,
6.5, 8.1, and 16.2 mg/kg. Three of these human-equivalent cef-
dinir doses fall well below the maximal recommended dose for
both adults and children, the fourth being only slightly above
the maximal recommended dose. Thus, the doses of cefdinir
that synergize with TXA709 in our mouse infection models
translate to human-equivalent doses that match recommended
human dosage regimens well. With regard to TXA709, phase I
toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles in humans represent im-
portant assessments that remain to be made. Nevertheless,
TXA709 and cefdinir are eliminated with similar pharmacoki-
netics in animals, with the oral bioavailability of TXA709 being
greater than that of cefdinir (7, 21). TXA709 and cefdinir may
therefore be administrable to humans at similar dosage fre-
quencies. These collective considerations highlight the promise
of the combination of TXA709 and cefdinir for the treatment of
drug-resistant staphylococcal infections.
