Abstract
Family and friends are the predominant providers of end-of-life care (EOL). Yet knowledge of the 
caregiving experience at the EOL has been constrained by a narrow focus on specific diseases or 
the “primary” caregiver and methodological limitations due to reliance on convenience samples, or 
recall biases associated with mortality follow-back study design. Using prospective, linked 
nationally representative datasets of Medicare beneficiaries and their caregivers, we found that in 
2011 900,000 older adults at the EOL received support from 2.3 million paid and unpaid 
caregivers. Nearly 9 in 10 of these caregivers were family members or unpaid. EOL caregivers 
provided more extensive care and reported more care-related challenges (e.g., physical difficulty) 
than non-EOL caregivers. EOL challenges were especially prevalent among caregiving spouses. 
To meet the needs of older adults at the EOL, families and unpaid caregivers must be better 
recognized and integrated in care delivery and supportive services must be expanded and made 
more widely available.
BACKGROUND
Caregivers play a vital role in the care of older adults with disabilities and serious illness, 
including those at the end-of-life (EOL).1, 2 Caregivers may assume new and potentially 
challenging tasks as the EOL approaches, including symptom management, engaging in 
difficult decisions about transitioning to long-term care or hospice, serving as a surrogate in 
medical decisions, and hiring paid caregivers.3,4 Furthermore, many older adults experience 
complex transitions between health care settings at the EOL,3 or may incur multiple 
hospitalizations, ICU admissions,5 or receive life-sustaining treatments.6 Service use may 
lead to high out-of-pocket spending for families7 as well as fragmented care, which further 
burden older adults and their caregivers.

 Existing evidence suggests EOL caregiving demands are significant,8, 9 and that certain 
tasks, such as decision-making, are extremely stressful.10 Watching a family member in pain 
or suffering is difficult.11 Not surprisingly, EOL caregivers have been found to experience 
high levels of depression and anxiety.12 Of particular concern is the consistent finding that 
EOL caregivers have high unmet needs themselves and that despite the high level of care 
they provide, use of supportive services (e.g., assistance with personal care or housework, 
use of respite care and support groups) is limited.13,14 Only 47% of bereaved family 
members report that their loved ones received “excellent” EOL care between 2011–2013, a 
decline from 57% in 2000.15
Our current knowledge of the scope and experience of EOL caregiving has been constrained 
by research limitations. Most studies that have reported on the experiences of EOL 
caregivers have relied on small convenience samples.4,16 Large-scale surveys on caregiving 
do not exclusively focus on EOL caregiving. Therefore, knowledge of EOL caregiving has 
generally been limited to specific disease groups or care settings,12,17,18 or to selected 
subpopulations identified as actively dying.19,20 Moreover, reliance on reports of caregiving 
experiences obtained after the assisted person’s death has made many studies subject to 
recall bias.21,22 Finally, most studies have been limited to assessing the experience of just 
one “primary” caregiver, failing to capture the full range of caregiving that occurs at the 
EOL.13,23
Changes in care delivery and payment have expanded possibilities to better meet the needs 
of individuals with serious illness and support caregivers. There has been continued steady 
growth in the use of hospice,24 including enrollment increases among individuals without 
cancer. Although not universally accessible, palliative care programs that focus on 
improving quality of life for patients and their families are increasingly available within 
large hospitals,25 and are expanding to long-term care26 and community-based settings.27 A 
better understanding of the nature and intensity of EOL caregiving could prove useful to 
ongoing efforts to monitor and improve access and quality of hospice and palliative care.
Therefore, we draw on two nationally representative surveys that afford the ability to 
prospectively study the caregiving experience of older adults at the EOL. Specifically, we 
characterized the nature and intensity of help provided by family and other unpaid caregivers 
assisting with EOL care as well as their caregiving experiences, contrasting EOL caregivers 
with other caregivers providing ongoing care. Finally, because of known differences in 
caregiver outcomes based on caregiver relationship type28 and the EOL trajectory,29 we 
compared experiences for spousal versus non-spousal caregivers, and for caregivers to older 
adults with three highly prevalent conditions associated with late-life mortality.
METHODS
Sample
Data are drawn from the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study(NHATS) and its 
linked National Study of Caregiving(NSOC). NHATS,30 a population-based survey of late-
life disability trends and trajectories, drew a random sample of individuals ages 65 years and 
older living in the contiguous U.S. from the Medicare enrollment file on September 30, 2010

 with oversampling of those over age 90 and non-Hispanic blacks. The enrollment file 
represents 96% of all older adults in the United States. In-person interviews were completed 
between May and November 2011 and yielded a sample of 8,245 persons, a 71% response 
rate; among these, 7609 were community-dwelling. Study participants were asked whether 
and how they performed daily activities in the month before the interview. Among older 
adults who received assistance for health and function, a detailed helper roster listed the 
relationship and specific activities for each person providing assistance.
NSOC31 is a nationally representative survey of family members and other unpaid caregivers 
who assist older persons with disabilities. NSOC participants were identified from the 
NHATS helper roster on the basis of being a family member or an unpaid helper who 
provided assistance with mobility, personal care, household activities, transportation, or 
medically oriented tasks. Up to 5 caregivers per older adult were interviewed. For older 
adults with more than 5 eligible caregivers, 5 caregivers were selected at random, and the 
remaining caregivers were considered ineligible.
The NHATS sample for our analysis consisted of 2423 community-dwelling older adults 
who received help with personal care, mobility or household activities from a family 
member or other unpaid helper. Older adults were classified as being at the EOL if they died 
within 12 months of completing the NHATS interview based on dates of death from the 
Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary file. Additionally, older adults who were identified 
as deceased within 12 months via the NHATS exit survey and who did not subsequently 
incur Medicare-reimbursed services were classified as being at the EOL(n=14). In total, 264 
older adults were characterized as ‘end of life’ and 2159 older adults were characterized as 
‘non-end of life’. At least 1 NSOC interview was completed with caregivers of 1369 eligible 
older adults resulting in a sample of 2007 family and unpaid caregivers who provided 
assistance (235 EOL and 1772 non-EOL)(Appendix).32
Measures
Older adults’ demographic characteristics included age, gender, race, education, marital 
status, income, and living arrangements. Disease status was based on self-reports of whether 
a doctor had ever told study participants they had individual health conditions. Dementia 
status was based on report of clinical diagnosis, proxy responses to the Ascertain Dementia 
8(AD8), and cognitive testing.33 Depression status was determined by a score >=3 on the 
two-item Patient Health Questionnaire.34 Receipt of help refers to older adults’ reports of 
assistance in the last month for personal care and mobility (bathing, dressing, eating, 
toileting, getting out of bed, getting around inside) and household activities (doing laundry, 
preparing meals, shopping, paying bills or handling medications) for health or function. 
Older adults reported whether anyone helped with these activities, whether help was paid or 
unpaid, source of payment if paid care, hours of care received, and each helper’s relationship 
to the respondent. Individuals who assisted older adults who died within 12 months were 
considered EOL caregivers.
Family and unpaid caregivers participating in NSOC reported on their socio-demographic 
and health characteristics, the nature and intensity of assistance they provided, and their 
experience of caregiving. Information regarding the nature and intensity of care provision

 included duration of caregiving, intensity of help (hours of care in the previous week), and 
assistance with specific tasks in domains of disability-related activities, health system 
logistics, and health management tasks. Negative caregiving-related effects were also 
examined including depression and financial, emotional, and physical difficulty.
Analysis
We first present analyses in which the characteristics, nature, and experiences of helping 
networks and caregivers’ experiences are examined by the survival status of the older adults 
they assisted. We describe national estimates and characteristics of all caregivers who assist 
older adults as well as the nature and intensity of care provided by family and unpaid 
caregivers. We next evaluate negative caregiving-related effects by older adults’ survival for 
all family and unpaid caregivers, and for caregivers serving recipients with dementia, cancer, 
and heart disease. Finally, we examine differences in the characteristics of, nature of 
assistance provided by, and caregiving-related experiences of spousal versus non-spousal 
EOL caregivers. Observations from the NHATS and NSOC were weighted to produce 
nationally representative estimates.32 All analyses incorporated the use of survey design 
variables and analytic survey weights to account for differential nonresponse and the 
complex sampling design. Analyses of older adults use the NHATS weights.35 When the 
unit of analysis was the caregiver, we used the NSOC weights31 which adjusts for 
differential probabilities of selection at both the NHATS sample person and caregiver levels. 
We compared differences between each group using t-tests and chi-square analyses. All 
analyses were completed using Stata version 13(College Station, Texas).
Limitations
Our care-recipient sample was limited to Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older, so this 
study does not capture the experiences of EOL caregivers to younger individuals or to older 
adults not enrolled in the Medicare program. Although reports of help received and provided 
are subject to recall bias, the one-month recall period and prospective design limits this 
possibility. Furthermore, we only captured caregiving experience at the time of study 
interview (mean= 5 months before death), which may change as death approaches. Our 
study focused on individuals who lived in the community within the 12 months before death, 
including those living in assisted living facilities. We were not, however, able to include 
information on caregivers of individuals living in nursing homes before death, who were not 
surveyed in NSOC. Finally, we chose a previously defined13 cut-off of 12 months to define 
the EOL period. Depending on the individual’s disease trajectory, it may not adequately 
capture the full range of EOL decision making and experiences.
RESULTS
The 264 (11%) community-dwelling older adults receiving help for health or function who 
died within one year of study enrollment represented an estimated 905,000 individuals 
nationwide. Individuals at the EOL were older, less likely to be female, in worse health, had 
more impaired function, and were more likely to have been hospitalized within the past year 
as compared with their counterparts who were not at the EOL (Exhibit 1). Consistent with

 their greater severity of disability, older adults at the EOL were more likely to receive help 
with basic activities e.g., eating, bathing, and toileting than those who were not at the EOL.
Older adults at the EOL were more likely than those not at the EOL to be assisted by paid 
caregivers (20% vs. 14%). Just 9% of older adults at EOL received any caregiving support 
that was funded by government, state or private insurance, a percentage that was not 
significantly higher than those not at the EOL.
An estimated 2.3 million caregivers nationwide assisted older adults at the EOL (Exhibit 2). 
As compared with those who were not at the EOL, older adults at the EOL had greater 
numbers of caregivers (mean 2.5 vs. 2.2) and received almost twice as many hours of help 
per week (mean 61.3 vs. 35.3) from both paid and unpaid caregivers. While the vast majority 
of caregivers were unpaid family or friends regardless of survival, a greater percentage of 
total EOL caregivers were paid (11% vs. 8%) representing an estimated 260,000 paid 
individuals assisting older adults at the EOL. Almost half (125,000) of these paid caregivers 
were paid directly by older adults and/or their families.32
An examination of help by disease type indicated that total number of caregivers, hours of 
help and receipt of any paid help was higher at the EOL than non-EOL for individuals with 
cancer, dementia and heart disease. Older adults at the EOL with heart disease were the most 
likely to receive any paid help regardless of payment source (33% for heart disease; 22% for 
cancer; 25% for dementia). While individuals at the EOL with cancer and heart disease were 
more than twice as likely as individuals with these diseases who were not at the EOL to 
receive help paid through government or other insurance, there was no significant difference 
by survival status among individuals with dementia (9% vs. 12%).32
Among the estimated 2 million EOL caregivers who were unpaid family or friends, nearly 
half (46%) lived in the same household as the older adult (Exhibit 2). Although nearly one in 
three EOL caregivers(30%) were themselves age 65 and over, only 14% were spouses, a 
smaller percentage than caregivers of older adults who were not at the EOL(22%). More 
than one in ten EOL caregivers(14%) reported their own health to be poor or fair. Nearly one 
in four EOL caregivers(23%), an estimated 477,000 people nationwide, reported that they 
provided help without support of family or friends.
EOL caregivers provided help with a broader range of activities and with greater intensity 
than caregivers of older adults who survived (Exhibit 3). EOL caregivers spent significantly 
more time helping (22.9 vs. 16.1 hours per week) and were significantly more likely to 
provide help with mobility, personal care, transportation, making the home safer, obtaining 
mobility devices, and finding a paid helper than non-EOL caregivers. There were no 
significant differences in the proportion providing help with healthcare or health 
management activities based on older adults’ survival status.
EOL caregivers were more likely to report caregiving-related physical difficulty (35% vs. 
21%) and that they had no time for themselves (51% vs. 40%) compared to non-EOL 
caregivers (Exhibit 4). No significant differences were detected in depression, anxiety, and 
emotional or financial difficulty by survival status among all caregivers. Physical difficulty 
at EOL was especially pronounced among dementia caregivers (43%). Increased financial

 difficulties at the EOL were only evident among cancer caregivers (30% vs. 19%) who also 
experienced the most substantial differences in emotional difficulties (41% non-EOL vs. 
66% EOL). Dementia caregivers reported similarly high emotional difficulty regardless of 
older adults’ survival status and no differences in negative aspects of caregiving were 
observed among caregivers of individuals with heart disease by older adults’ survival status.
EOL caregivers who were spouses, an estimated 302,000, had been providing care for more 
years (mean=10.0) and for more hours per week (mean=44.1) than non-spousal EOL 
caregivers.32 They also were far less likely than other EOL caregivers to report that other 
family/friends provide help (38% vs. 84%). They were more likely to report caregiving to be 
physically difficult (66% vs. 30%) and were more than twice as likely to have depression 
compared to other EOL caregivers.
DISCUSSION
This nationally representative, prospective study finds that approximately 900,000 older 
adults in the last year of life were assisted by 2.3 million caregivers nationwide in 2011. We 
find that caregiving needs increase and caregiving networks expand as older adults approach 
the EOL. Families and unpaid caregivers provide the overwhelming majority of care. 
Although older adults receive more paid care towards the EOL, the vast majority do not 
receive paid help.
While EOL caregivers reported more negative aspects of caregiving than non-EOL 
caregivers, this was not consistently true across all domains. We did not observe differences 
in reports of financial difficulties, depression, anxiety, or that the caregiving role was more 
than EOL caregivers could handle. Our findings are consistent with previous literature 
indicating that the caregiving experience is generally stable and that coping style may be 
more important than disease severity in advanced illness.23 The design of this study affords a 
more rigorous understanding of EOL caregiving in that the study is not constrained narrowly 
to a “primary” EOL caregiver, which may lead to over-reporting negative consequences.13 
Moreover, by relying on a prospective design, this study is not subject to selection biases due 
to the enrollment of less-burdened families or recall biases due to reappraisal of the 
caregiving experience.36
Our use of a nationally representative sample, as opposed to a disease-specific subgroup, 
allowed us to examine nuanced differences in the EOL caregiver experience for three 
common age-related conditions. Dementia caregivers reported a striking degree of physical 
difficulty regardless of older adults’ survival status, which corresponds with extraordinarily 
high care needs of advanced dementia37 and the physical toll associated with sleep 
interruptions, managing burdensome symptoms, and complete assistance with self-care 
activities.38 The finding that financial difficulty was significantly higher among EOL cancer 
caregivers is notable in light of growing recognition and concern regarding the high costs of 
cancer care,39 which may extend beyond patients to their families.
This work expands knowledge of the scope of EOL caregiving and its related challenges by 
examining all caregivers - both paid and unpaid – who are involved in the care of older

 adults. While our work confirms the vital role of family and unpaid caregivers before and 
during the EOL period, we find that paid caregiving support is significantly higher at the 
EOL. However, just half of the paid support received at the EOL was funded by government, 
state or private insurance. Although individuals with cancer and heart disease received more 
government or insurance support for paid care at the EOL (vs. non-EOL), there was no 
significant increase in government-supported care for people at the EOL overall, including 
those with dementia. Together, these findings underscore the mismatch between older 
adults’ care needs and current Medicare benefits. Specifically, Medicare’s lack of long-term 
services and supports leaves many older adults and their families at risk for significant 
financial burden or impoverishment.7
Although they represented a small minority(14%) of EOL caregivers nationwide, spouses 
were disproportionately affected by the EOL caregiving trajectory. Spousal EOL caregivers 
experienced the most extensive care-related challenges including increased depression, and 
perhaps not surprisingly because of their older age, more exhaustion and physical difficulty. 
The negative experience of spousal EOL caregivers may in part be due to their increased 
likelihood of providing assistance alone, a finding previously reported.40 Nearly 2/3, or an 
estimated 188,000 spousal caregivers nationwide, reported that they do not receive support 
from family or friends.
The lack of consistent differences in caregiving-related challenges by older adults’ survival 
status speaks to the heterogeneity of family caregiving, and the necessity of understanding 
individual circumstances targeting effective interventions. This will require caregiver 
assessment,41 a systematic process of gathering information about a caregiving situation in 
order to tailor services, including direct assistance or respite care, and provide needed 
training and information. Furthermore, advancing policies that expand family leave and 
flexible workplaces are key strategies that will better enable caregivers to compensate for 
work-related impacts associated with caregiving demands.1,3
The extensive health service interactions that were managed by all caregivers (EOL and non-
EOL) reinforces recent recommendations by the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine for greater attention to identification and support of caregivers in 
care delivery,1 and suggests the benefit of doing so earlier in the illness trajectory. Current 
policies which prioritize the privacy and security of individual patients’ personal health 
information may impose barriers on families’ ability to access information that is 
appropriate and beneficial when they are involved in overseeing, managing, or coordinating 
care for older adults without the capacity to do so themselves.42 Although engaging family 
members through health information technology holds promise as a strategy to respect 
patients’ preferences for involving family and facilitating communication, awareness and 
uptake of such strategies remain low.43
Palliative care provides an added layer of support for patients and families in the setting of 
serious illness, and is available at any point in one’s illness. Hospice care, in contrast, is 
limited to the last months of life only and may arrive too late to fully benefit caregivers who 
have already experienced tremendous caring-related strain. Continued expansion of access to 
high quality hospice and palliative care programs, which have demonstrated effective

 support for patients and their caregivers, 44 will be a critical tool to support EOL caregivers. 
The Medicare Care Choices Model demonstration project45 is testing the effects of 
extending hospice support to individuals who may be ineligible or unwilling to use 
traditional hospice services. If successful, this strategy could facilitate delivery of supportive 
services to family caregivers earlier in the disease trajectory. Newly available billing codes 
that enable Medicare payment for voluntary advance care planning conversations, as well as 
transitional care and chronic care management services, including non-face-to-face 
conversations with family members1 may also promote more proactive and meaningful 
support of families throughout the serious illness process.
CONCLUSIONS
Results from this study confirm the significant and enduring involvement of caregivers in 
meeting the needs of older adults at the EOL. Supporting the growing population of family 
and other unpaid caregivers is an urgent public health issue. Our findings indicate the need 
for adequate support is especially pressing when older patients and the loved ones who assist 
them are at their most vulnerable, at the EOL.
