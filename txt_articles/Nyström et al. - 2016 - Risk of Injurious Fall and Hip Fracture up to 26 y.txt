Abstract
Background
Low muscle strength has been found in late adolescence in individuals diagnosed with Par-
kinson disease (PD) 30 y later. This study investigated whether this lower muscle strength
also may translate into increased risks of falling and fracture before the diagnosis of PD.
Methods and Findings
Among all Swedish citizens aged �50 y in 2005, two nested case–control cohorts were
compiled. In cohort I, individuals diagnosed with PD during 1988–2012 (n = 24,412) were
matched with up to ten controls (n = 243,363), and the risk of fall-related injuries before diag-
nosis of PD was evaluated. In cohort II, individuals with an injurious fall in need of emer-
gency care during 1988–2012 (n = 622,333) were matched with one control (n = 622,333),
and the risk of PD after the injurious fall was evaluated. In cohort I, 18.0% of cases and
11.5% of controls had at least one injurious fall (p < 0.001) prior to PD diagnosis in the case.
Assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for comorbid diagnoses and
education level, PD was associated with increased risks of injurious fall up to 10 y before
diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.08–1.31; 7 to <10 y before diagnosis) and hip
fracture �15 y before diagnosis (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.10–1.69; 15–26 y before diagnosis). In
cohort II, 0.7% of individuals with an injurious fall and 0.5% of controls were diagnosed with
PD during follow-up (p < 0.001). The risk of PD was increased for up to 10 y after an injuri-
ous fall (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02–1.37; 7 to <10 y after diagnosis). An important limitation is
that the diagnoses were obtained from registers and could not be clinically confirmed for the
study.

 Conclusions
The increased risks of falling and hip fracture prior to the diagnosis of PD may suggest the
presence of clinically relevant neurodegenerative impairment many years before the diag-
nosis of this disease.
Introduction
Fall-related injuries are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population [1].
The risk of falling is increased in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) [2,3], and the incidence
of hip fracture is particularly high [4], possibly due to dysfunctional balance reactions and
impaired ability to protect the hip when falling [5].
PD has an insidious onset; the cardinal motor symptoms are preceded by substantial neurode-
generation [6,7], the timing of which remains uncertain [8,9]. Several studies have reported
increased occurrence of nonspecific symptoms years or decades before the diagnosis of PD [8,9].
These prodromal signs reported typically do not involve motor function. Balance impairment
has been considered to be a late-stage symptom in PD; it defines the transition to stage 3 on the
Hoehn and Yahr scale [10]. However, this staging relies on the clinical evaluation of balance.
Quantitative measurements of postural stability have detected abnormalities also in the early
stages of PD [11,12], and recent findings suggest that balance can be impaired in the prodromal
phase of the disease [13–15]. Whether such subclinical deficits increase the risk of falling remains
unclear, but a high incidence of accidental injuries in the years preceding PD diagnosis has been
reported [13]. In a recent investigation of the Swedish male population, we found lower muscle
strength 30 y before the diagnosis of PD [16]. The effect size of the relation between muscle
strength and PD was small, but an association between similarly subtle strength deficits and an
increased risk of low-energy fractures has previously been reported [17]. We hypothesized that
the reduced muscle strength found in our previous study might be a marker of neuromuscular
dysfunction that could translate into an increased risk of falling and fractures a long time before
PD diagnosis. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk of injurious falls prior to
the clinical onset of PD from a long-term perspective. In a nationwide cohort consisting of all
individuals aged �50 y, we identified those diagnosed with PD between 1988 and 2012. Using a
nested case—control (NCC) design with attention to temporal perspectives, we investigated
whether PD diagnosis was preceded by injurious falls in general, and by hip fracture in particular.
Methods
Study Population
Permission for the present study was granted by the local ethics committee of Umeå University.
The assignment of a unique personal identification number to every Swedish citizen ensures
that nationwide registers and databases are highly reliable. The National Patient Register (NPR)
provides records of all public inpatient healthcare since 1987, and outpatient consultations in
specialist clinics since 2001 [18]. Diagnoses are coded according to the Swedish versions of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 in 1987–1997, ICD-10 since 1998), and the rec-
ords have shown a high degree of validity, with positive predictive values of 85%–97% [19]. All
residents of Sweden aged �50 y on December 31, 2005 (n = 3,329,400), were considered for
inclusion in the present study. Personal identification numbers were used to link data from the
NPR with those from other nationwide registers before encoding and depersonalization.

 Diagnoses and Matched Cohort Definition
Within the cohort, we traced diagnoses of PD (ICD-9 code 332A, ICD-10 code G20.9)
recorded in the NPR between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2012. For the same period,
we traced medical consultations and hospitalizations due to falls (ICD-9 code E885, ICD-10
codes W00 and W01). In these fall-related care events, we also captured diagnoses of the most
common fractures (hip [ICD-9 code 820, ICD-10 codes S72.0–S72.2], wrist [ICD-9 code 813,
ICD-10 code S52], lower leg [ICD-9 code 824, ICD-10 code S82], and humerus [ICD-9 code
812, ICD-10 codes S42.2–S42.4]) and head injuries (ICD-9 codes 800–804 and 850–853; ICD-
10 codes I62, S02, and S06). Mortality data were obtained from the National Cause of Death
Register.
Based on the information obtained, we compiled two NCC cohorts (Fig 1). Cohort I was
compiled with the aim of analyzing the risk of falls and fractures prior to PD diagnosis com-
pared with matched controls, with a retrospective design allowing capture of recurrent events.
For this, each case of PD was matched by sex and year of birth to ten population-based con-
trols, drawn from all residents of Sweden aged �50 y on December 31, 2005. The index date
for each matched group was defined by the earliest recorded PD diagnosis. Controls deceased
before the index date were excluded and were replaced when a new matching control who was
alive on the index date could be found within three additional matching attempts. All individu-
als with index dates before January 1, 1988, were excluded from analyses, to provide a mini-
mum retrospective study time of 1 y and to allow 1 y to capture diagnoses of PD in individuals
with disease onset before data collection began.

 The second NCC cohort (cohort II) was compiled with the aim of prospectively evaluating
the risk of PD after an injurious fall. Again, all residents of Sweden �50 y of age by the end of
2005 were considered for inclusion; each individual with a record of injurious fall not preceded
by a PD diagnosis in the NPR was matched by sex and year of birth to one control with no
record of fall-related injury, drawn from the same population. The index date for each matched
pair was defined by the first recorded injurious fall, and pairs containing a control diagnosed
with PD before the index date were excluded. Controls deceased before the index date were
replaced when possible. Individuals with an injurious fall for whom no matching control alive
on the index date could be found within three additional matching attempts were excluded. To
allow for 1 y to capture diagnoses of PD, individuals with an index date for injurious fall before
January 1, 1988, were excluded from analysis.
Additional Covariates
Other diagnoses that might confound the associations studied were selected as covariates based
on previous known associations with falls [20,21] and were acquired from the NPR, including
dementia (ICD-9 codes 290, 291, and 294B; ICD-10 codes F00, F01, F03.9, G30, G31, and
E51.2), stroke (ICD-9 codes 431 and 434, ICD-10 codes I61–I64), myocardial infarction (ICD-
9 code 410, ICD-10 codes I21 and I22), diabetes mellitus (ICD-9 code 250, ICD-10 codes E10
and E11), depression (ICD-9 code 311, ICD-10 codes F32 and F33), alcohol dependency or
abuse (ICD-9 codes 303 and 305A, ICD-10 code F10), and drug dependency or abuse (ICD-9
codes 304 and 305X, ICD-10 codes F11–F19). As a proxy for socioeconomic situation, infor-
mation about individuals’ education level (low, vocational school or �9 y of primary school;
high, university or �3 y of secondary school) was obtained from the Statistics Sweden database;
this information was available for 98.8% of individuals in cohort I and 97.8% of individuals in
cohort II.
Statistical Analyses
Stata (version 13.1 for Windows; StataCorp) and SPSS (version 22.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc.)
software packages were used for statistical analyses. Data are presented as valid percentages
and medians with ranges, unless otherwise indicated. Chi-squared tests and Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests were used for univariate analyses. p-Values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.
In the PD-matched cohort (cohort I), the study time was calculated backward from the
index date to January 1, 1987, and incidences of injurious fall and hip fracture were investigated
in separate time intervals before the index date: 0 to <3 mo, 3 to <12 mo, 1 to <2 y, 2 to <3 y,
3 to <4 y, 4 to <5 y, 5 to <7 y, 7 to <10 y, 10 to <15 y, and 15 to <26 y before the index date
(Fig 2). Medical consultations with aftercare diagnoses (ICD-9 codes V53, V54, and V58; ICD-
10 codes Z09.4, Z47, Z48, Z50.8, and Z50.9) were excluded. Odds ratios (ORs) according to PD
were calculated separately for each time interval and for each of the outcomes (injurious fall
and hip fracture), using conditional logistic regression models adjusted for education level and
comorbid diagnoses (and sex and year of birth by the statistical model).
In the fall-matched cohort (cohort II), the follow-up time was calculated from the index
date to the date of PD, death, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first. We evaluated the
proportional hazards assumption using a Cox model with Schoenfeld residuals and found that
the association between injurious fall and subsequent PD did not meet the criteria for propor-
tional hazards (χ2 = 156.2 at one degree of freedom; p < 0.001). Thus, we further analyzed this
association using a flexible parametric Royston—Parmar model [22], allowing the relationship
between the exposure and the outcome to vary over time. Individuals with a follow-up time of

 <3 mo were excluded. To test the consistency of the results, we assessed the ORs for PD in dif-
ferent time intervals using a conditional logistic regression model, as described above. The time
intervals for this prospective analysis were 0 to <3 mo, 3 to <12 mo, 1 to <2 y, 2 to <3 y, 3 to
<4 y, 4 to <5 y, 5 to <7 y, 7 to <10 y, 10 to <15 y, and 15 to 25 y after the index date. To assess
potential confounding by the competing risk of death, we also performed the same analyses
separately in a sub-cohort (cohort IIb) where all matched pairs in which either individual died
during follow-up were excluded. All models were adjusted for sex and year of birth, education
level, and comorbidities diagnosed before the index date.
Results
Descriptive data for the two NCC cohorts are presented in Table 1. Cohort I comprised 24,412
individuals with PD and 243,363 controls (47.1% women), with a median age of 75.4 y (range
32.0‒103.7) on the index date. During a median study period of 19.9 y (range 1.0–25.0) before
the index date, 18.0% of individuals with PD and 11.5% of controls had at least one injurious
fall (p < 0.001), resulting in at least one fracture in 10.7% of individuals with PD and 6.9% of
controls (p < 0.001). The incidence of hip fracture prior to the index date was 7.1% and 3.2%,
respectively, among individuals with PD and controls (p < 0.001; Table 1).
In the multivariable adjusted analyses of cohort I (Table 2), an elevated risk of falls appeared
in the decade before PD diagnosis (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08–1.31; 7 to <10 y before diagnosis, for
cases versus controls), and the association was further accentuated closer to the index date (OR
1.94, 95% CI 1.79–2.11; 3 to <12 mo before diagnosis). The association between PD and hip
fracture was even stronger, with an approximately 2-fold increased risk in all intervals between

 3 mo and <4 y prior to PD diagnosis, and this association was significant �15 y before diagno-
sis (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.10–1.69; 15 to 26 y before PD diagnosis). In the last 3 mo before PD
diagnosis, the ORs for injurious fall and for hip fracture increased distinctly, to 5.83 (95% CI
5.30–6.42) for falls and 7.49 (95% CI 6.52–8.61) for hip fracture, for individuals with PD versus
controls.
Results of the prospective sensitivity analyses of risk of PD after injurious fall in cohort II
are presented in Fig 3 (Royston—Parmar model) and Table 3 (conditional logistic regression).
Cohort II consisted of 622,333 individuals with an injurious fall and 622,333 individuals with-
out an injurious fall (65.4% women) with a median age of 70.4 y (range 32.1‒106.8) at the time
of the first registered injurious fall. The most common fall-related injuries were fractures of
the hip (15.9%), wrist (15.0%), lower leg (11.9%), and humerus (7.0%). During the follow-up
period (median 5.8 y, range 0–25.0), 7,501 (0.6%) individuals in this cohort were diagnosed
with PD (4,299 [0.7%] individuals with an injurious fall, 3,202 [0.5%] controls; p < 0.001;

 Assessed by the Royston—Parmar model, the risk of PD was elevated among individuals
with an injurious fall during the first ~10 y of study enrollment and then appeared to decrease
significantly compared with controls at follow-up times �15 y (Fig 3). Regression analyses con-
firmed these findings, with ORs declining from 1.98 (95% CI 1.70–2.32) at 3 to <12 mo after
the first fall to 0.79 (95% CI 0.65–0.95) at �15 y after the first fall (Table 3). However, in the
sub-cohort excluding all pairs censored by death (S1 Table), no inverse relationship between
falling and PD was observed (S2 Table; S1 Fig).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first long-term investigation of fall risk prior to the clinical
onset of PD. In general, we found that the risk of injurious falls was elevated a decade before
the diagnosis of PD, and the risk of hip fracture was increased �15 y before the diagnosis of
PD. The strength of these associations between injurious falls, hip fracture, and PD increased
distinctly up to the diagnosis of PD. The time-dependent patterns indicate a direct link between
injurious falls and subsequent PD, and may be explained by subtle neurodegenerative
impairment many years before the diagnosis of this disease.

Risk of Injurious Fall and Hip Fracture before Parkinson's Disease

 In the present study, diagnoses of dementia, depression, and diabetes were more common
in PD cases than in controls, which may have contributed to the higher risk of falls before the
index date [20,21]. Irrespectively of this, a recent study from the UK revealed that balance
impairment was more common up to 5 y prior to diagnosis in individuals diagnosed with PD
compared to controls [14]. This finding is particularly noteworthy, as postural imbalance is
not expected to be clinically overt until the later stages of PD [11,23]. Moreover, given that sub-
clinical deficits in postural stability have been noted in early PD [11,12], similar findings of
increased postural sway in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may indi-
cate balance impairments in prodromal PD, as more than half of these patients are expected to
eventually develop parkinsonism (PD, multiple system atrophy, or Lewy body dementia) [15].
Such subtle deficits could conceivably translate into increased risks of falling and consequent
injury in prodromal PD, but, to our knowledge, only one previous study [13] has addressed
this question. The authors reported an increased incidence of accidental injury prior to PD but

 included data from only the last 3 y of the prodromal phase [13], whereas our results indicate
an association with hip fracture decades before diagnosis.
The results of the present study are supported by previous findings of low hand-grip and
elbow-flexion strength three decades before the diagnosis of PD [16]. The involvement of the
upper extremity is of particular interest in relation to the increased risk of hip fracture in the
present study, as dysfunctional arm movements when falling are thought to play an important
role in the high incidence of hip fracture in patients with PD [2]. Thus, taken together, our
present and previous [16] findings may indicate that such deficits arise long before the cardinal
signs of PD become overt.
Some limitations of the present study should be noted. First, data were obtained from regis-
ters, and diagnoses could not be clinically confirmed for the present study, although all diagno-
ses were recorded in the context of specialist healthcare. Compared to residents of urban areas,
individuals with PD in rural parts of Sweden may be less likely to be diagnosed in specialist
health care, and therefore less likely to be included as cases of PD in the present study. A simi-
lar effect could be expected for fall-related injuries; less severe injuries that do not demand sur-
gery are less likely to be diagnosed in specialist care. Thus, the accuracy for hip fractures can be
expected to be higher than for fall-related injuries in general [24]. Any incorrect or missed
diagnosis would contribute to regression dilution bias, causing wider standard errors and
attenuation of the associations found between PD and injurious falls toward zero [25]. Second,
the observational nature of this study did not permit exploration of the mechanisms underlying
the observed associations or documentation of a causal link between injurious falls and PD,
although the time-dependent associations found strongly suggest such a relationship. Third,
we lacked information about smoking status. This would have been of interest since smoking is
associated with a reduced risk for PD [26]. Having a higher education level is known to be asso-
ciated with less smoking [27,28], and smoking status may therefore explain the association
between higher education and PD in the present study. The main strengths of the present
study include the large body of prospectively recorded data covering a long period, which

 provided superior statistical power for the performance of reliable analyses from a long-term
perspective and which was not subject to recall bias. The main results of the present study were
also evaluated in cohort II, and the findings were consistent. Thus, the sensitivity analysis sup-
ported the validity of the main findings, and because the individuals were drawn from a nation-
wide cohort, the external validity of the results is likely high.
In conclusion, we found that the risk of injurious falls in general, and especially those result-
ing in hip fracture, was increased decades before the diagnosis of PD. These findings suggest
that clinically relevant neurodegenerative impairment could be present many years before the
clinical onset of the disease. It would be of value if our results identifying markers of PD more
than a decade before diagnosis, from the present and previous studies [16,29], could be con-
firmed in other settings and in other countries.

 Editors' Summary
Background
Parkinson disease (PD) is a common, progressive neurological disease. The disease is
caused by the gradual loss of the nerve cells that usually produce dopamine, a neurotrans-
mitter that regulates the body’s movements (motor functions). The symptoms of PD,
which develop slowly, include tremor (involuntary trembling of the hands, legs, arm, jaw,
and face), slow movement, impaired balance and coordination, and rigidity (muscle stiff-
ness). As these symptoms worsen, affected individuals may have trouble walking, speak-
ing, and swallowing, and they may fall frequently, fracturing bones. No drugs are available
to halt the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells, but medications that replace or mimic
the lost dopamine can reduce the severity of these motor symptoms. PD does not directly
kill people, and many people with PD have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. How-
ever, PD puts a great strain on the body, which makes affected individuals vulnerable to
life-threatening infection such as pneumonia.
Why Was This Study Done?
The motor symptoms of PD do not usually develop until people are around 60 years old.
However, nonspecific “prodromal” signs (for example, changes in smell perception) can
occur many years earlier. Indeed, a recent study reported low muscle strength in late ado-
lescence in patients diagnosed with PD decades later. Could reduced muscular strength be
a marker of neuromuscular dysfunction (problems with the nerves that control move-
ment), and could this dysfunction translate into an increased risk of falls and fractures
years before PD diagnosis? Here, researchers investigate these questions by undertaking a
nested case—control study in a nationwide cohort. A nested case—control study identifies
all the individuals in a group (here, everyone living in Sweden who was 50 years old or
older at the end of 2005) who have a specific condition (here, PD), identifies several
matched individuals (people who are similar to the cases in terms of age, gender, and cer-
tain other characteristics) in the same cohort who do not have the condition, and asks
whether the cases and controls differ in terms of a specific characteristic (here, falls and
fall-related injuries up to 26 years before the diagnosis of PD).
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
The researchers identified 24,412 Swedish citizens who were diagnosed with PD between
1988 and 2012 by examining the Swedish National Patient Register and matched each case
with up to ten controls to form a nested case—control cohort. During an average study
period of 20 years prior to a PD diagnosis, 18.0% of cases and 11.5% of controls had at
least one fall that caused an injury requiring emergency care. After adjusting for other fac-
tors that might affect an individual’s risk of a fall, PD was associated with an increased risk
of injurious falls up to ten years before diagnosis (an odds ratio [OR] of 1.19; an OR repre-
sents the chance that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure compared to the
chance of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure) and with an increased
risk of hip fracture more than 15 years before diagnosis (OR 1.36; hip fractures are particu-
larly common among people with PD). The strength of these associations was increased
closer to PD diagnosis. Finally, in a second nested case—control cohort in which individu-
als with a record of injurious falls were matched with individuals with no history of falls,
Risk of Injurious Fall and Hip Fracture before Parkinson's Disease

 the risk of PD was higher among individuals with an injurious fall than among those with-
out during the first ten years after the first recorded fall.
What Do These Findings Mean?
The use of diagnoses obtained from registers that could not be clinically confirmed may
limit the accuracy of these findings. Moreover, these findings cannot prove that there is a
shared causal link between injurious falls and PD (although the time-dependent changes
in the strength of the associations and the results from the second nested case—control
cohort strongly suggest a direct link between injurious falls and subsequent PD). However,
the finding that the risk of injurious falls—particularly the risk of falls resulting in hip frac-
ture—is increased decades prior to the diagnosis of PD suggests that clinically relevant but
subtle neurodegenerative impairment could be present many years before the clinical
onset of PD. These findings, which identify potential markers of PD more than a decade
before diagnosis, need to be confirmed in other settings but provide new insights into the
earliest, hitherto unrecognized, stages of PD.
