Introduction
Glaucoma is a group of heterogeneous diseases that is character-
ized by a chronic degenerative optic neuropathy, affecting more 
than 60 million people worldwide (1–3). Primary congenital glau-
coma (PCG) (OMIM 231300) is a severe form of the disease with 
unclear etiology and is characterized by infant/early-childhood 
ocular hypertension, enlarged eye globes (buphthalmos), and optic 
neuropathy, which can result in vision loss and blindness — often 
despite treatment (4–6). Indeed, PCG accounts for 18% of children 
enrolled in institutions for the blind worldwide (7). PCG occurs 
in all ethnic groups, but the disease incidence varies according to 
ethnic background, ranging from 1:1,250 in inbred populations to 
1:30,000 in populations with heterogeneous ethnicity (6, 8–12). 
Families can exhibit autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance, 
although the majority of cases appear to be sporadic (5, 6, 10–14).
The molecular etiology of PCG is only partially understood, 
as only a few genes responsible for PCG have been identified (6, 
10–14). Mutations in CYP1B1, which encodes a cytochrome P450 
enzyme, is the most common cause of autosomal recessive PCG 
worldwide, accounting for up to 87% of familial cases in some 
inbred populations but only 25%–27% in populations with hetero-
geneous ethnicity (5, 9, 15–18). With CYP1B1 mutations account-
Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a devastating eye disease and an important cause of childhood blindness worldwide. 
In PCG, defects in the anterior chamber aqueous humor outflow structures of the eye result in elevated intraocular 
pressure (IOP); however, the genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of these defects have not been 
fully characterized. Previously, we observed PCG-like phenotypes in transgenic mice that lack functional angiopoietin-TEK 
signaling. Herein, we identified rare TEK variants in 10 of 189 unrelated PCG families and demonstrated that each mutation 
results in haploinsufficiency due to protein loss of function. Multiple cellular mechanisms were responsible for the loss 
of protein function resulting from individual TEK variants, including an absence of normal protein production, protein 
aggregate formation, enhanced proteasomal degradation, altered subcellular localization, and reduced responsiveness to 
ligand stimulation. Further, in mice, hemizygosity for Tek led to the formation of severely hypomorphic Schlemm’s canal 
and trabecular meshwork, as well as elevated IOP
, demonstrating that anterior chamber vascular development is sensitive 
to Tek gene dosage and the resulting decrease in angiopoietin-TEK signaling. Collectively, these results identify TEK 
mutations in patients with PCG that likely underlie disease and are transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with 
variable expressivity.

It is well recognized that elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is 
the key risk factor contributing to glaucoma, including PCG (1–3, 
6, 19, 20). The elevated pressure in PCG is believed to result from 
defects in the aqueous humor outflow (AHO) pathway, rather than 
ing for PCG in less than a third of patients with heterogeneous 
ethnicity, alternate mechanisms must underlie the majority of 
these other cases. Furthermore, the mechanism of PCG due to 
mutations in CYP1B1 is not clearly understood.

TEK variants as disease-causing mutations and assessed their 
effects on TEK function. We also determined in mice whether 
haploinsufficiency for Tek is sufficient to result in abnormal SC 
development and elevation of IOP. In addition to the identification 
of a pathway for human glaucoma, we assign key functional roles 
to specific domains of the TEK receptor.
Results
TEK mutations are identified in PCG families with unknown etiology. 
To identify novel PCG causative genes, we applied whole exome 
sequencing to a multiethnic cohort of PCG families with unknown 
molecular etiology. We performed an initial exome sequencing anal-
ysis on 21 affected individuals from 20 families including 2 affected 
individuals in family 1 (Figure 1A) and 19 sporadic cases. Under a 
monogenic recessive inheritance model, filtering for novel nonsyn-
onymous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous variants in a 
single gene identified no candidate genes. An analysis of 2 complete 
family trios also excluded the possibility of de novo mutations being 
causative for the phenotype in these 2 families. We initially focused 
our analysis on a family demonstrating direct parent-to-child trans-
mission of the disease (family 1, Figure 1A), looking for novel shared 
heterozygous variants, and identified heterozygosity for 3 nonsense 
and 15 missense variants in common. One of the nonsense variants, 
p.Y307*, was present in TEK (Figure 1A and Table 1).
We reasoned that loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in TEK 
could be involved in the etiology of PCG, given our findings of 
a PCG-like phenotype in Angpt1/Angpt2 and Tek cKO mice (31). 
Therefore, we sought additional novel/rare TEK variants in a 
collaborative multi-ethnic cohort totaling 209 individuals in 189 
families. In family 2 (Figure 1A), we screened for TEK variants by 
Sanger sequencing and identified an inconsistency in father-to-
son transmission for a known SNP (see Sanger sequencing traces 
in Figure 1B) that suggested the presence of a deletion. Copy num-
ber variation analysis was performed on the family trio using Affy-
an increase in aqueous humor (AH) production (5, 6, 14). Ocular 
anterior chamber fluid (AH) is produced by the ciliary body and 
drained mainly through Schlemm’s canal (SC) and uveoscleral 
pathways (21, 22). An imbalance in fluid homeostasis results in 
elevated IOP. In humans, 80% of fluid drainage is conducted 
through the conventional, or trabecular, AHO pathway (23). AH 
first passes through the trabecular meshwork (TM) before enter-
ing the lymphatic-like SC for drainage (22, 24, 25). The remain-
ing 20% of fluid egresses via the unconventional uveoscleral tract 
pathway, which includes the extracellular spaces within the iris, 
ciliary muscle, and sclera (21).
The angiopoietin receptor TEK (tunica interna endothelial cell 
kinase, also known as Tie2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase and reg-
ulates vascular homeostasis through its auto- and transphospho-
rylation (26–29). The primary ligand, angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), 
is expressed by pericytes and other vascular supporting cells, and 
exerts its proangiogenic and vascular stabilizing effects through 
activating TEK. A second ligand, ANGPT2, is secreted by the 
endothelium and acts as a context-dependent partial agonist of 
TEK (26, 27, 29, 30).
In the eye, the TEK receptor is highly expressed in the SC 
endothelium (24, 25). Recently, we discovered that angiopoiet-
in-TEK signaling is required for SC development in mice (31). 
Deletion of TEK or both major angiopoietin ligands after embry-
onic day 16.5 circumvents embryonic lethality and results in devel-
opmental loss of SC, extremely elevated IOP, rapid and complete 
retinal ganglion loss, and glaucoma (31). Despite the critical role of 
this signaling pathway for SC development in mice, the relevance 
of this pathway in human disease has not, to our knowledge, been 
previously reported.
Here, we describe human mutations in TEK identified in 
a PCG cohort of 189 families that do not carry mutations in the 
known disease-causing genes CYP1B1 (16–18), LTBP2 (32), FOXC1 
(33), and MYOC (13). We identified 10 heterozygous novel/rare

Four mutations (p.E150*, p.Y307*, p.K745fs, and p.G984*) are 
predicted to be null alleles likely to result in mRNA degradation 
via nonsense-mediated decay or truncated proteins (see predicted 
truncated proteins in Supplemental Figure 2A; EnzymeX [http:/
/
nucleobytes.com/enzymex/] was used for predictions). Further-
more, the in silico predictive tool Human Splicing Finder (HSF 
3.0, http:/
/www.umd.be/HSF3/HSF.html) indicated that the two 
invariant splice donor mutations (c.760+2T>C and c.3300+2delT) 
affect splicing and result in functionally null proteins (Table 2 and 
Supplemental Figure 3). The strong enrichment for LoF mutations 
in our PCG cohort (6 of 189) compared with those observed in the 
ExAC database (2 of 60,706 individuals; P = 2.3 × 10–14; odds ratio 
= 995.2 [95% confidence interval = 199.5–4,963.0]; see Methods 
for details), supports a role for TEK mutations in PCG pathogen-
esis. Additionally, according to analysis of evolutionary conser-
vation and in silico predictive tools (Polymorphism Phenotyping 
v2 [PolyPhen-2, http:/
/genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/]; Sorting 
Intolerant from Tolerant [SIFT, http:/
/sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/]; and 
FoldX [http:/
/foldx.crg.es/, http:/
/foldxyasara.switchlab.org/]), 
2 of the 3 missense mutations are also expected to affect protein 
function (Table 3 and Supplemental Figures 4–6).
TEK mutations identified in PCG patients exhibit LoF. We 
experimentally tested the functional impact of PCG-associated 
TEK variants in cell-based assays to determine their effect on 
TEK protein production, phosphorylation, and trafficking within 
the cell. As mutations were identified sequentially, we performed 
analysis of the first 5 mutations discovered in our primary cohort. 
In our system, WT TEK protein underwent normal baseline auto-
phosphorylation when expressed in HEK293 cells (Figure 2A). As 
predicted, the p.Y307* mutant cDNA (identified in family 1) did 
not produce a full-length intact protein with C-terminal FLAG 
tag, as the introduced stop codon is upstream of the tag (Figure 
2A and Supplemental Figure 7). To test the possibility that the 
predicted p.Y307 mutant protein is produced and secreted into 
the medium, we generated a TEK306-Fc–expressing vector. 
TEK306-Fc protein, which contains the Ig1, Ig2, EGF1, and EGF2 
domains, was detected in the medium (Supplemental Figure 2B 
and Supplemental Figure 7).
The p.T19_R210del (ΔT_R, family 2) and p.C233Y (family 3) 
mutations resulted in distinctly reduced protein levels accom-
panied by negligible autophosphorylation, making them func-
tional null alleles (Figure 2A). Interestingly, the p.K294N (fam-
metrix SNP 6.0 arrays, which identified a 56-kb deletion encom-
passing TEK exons 2–4 (p.T19_R210del) that was passed from the 
father (unknown affection status) to the unilaterally affected son 
(Figure 1B). In total in our cohort, whole exome and direct Sanger 
sequencing identified 10 novel/rare heterozygous TEK variants 
(Figure 1, A–C, and Table 1). Nine of these 10 mutations (p.Y307*, 
p.T19_R210del, p.C233Y, p.Y611C, p.E150*, p.K745fs, p.G984*, 
c.760+2T>C, and c.3300+2delT) were absent from publicly avail-
able exome databases (Exome Sequencing Project [NHLBI-ESP, 
http:/
/evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/], 6,500 exome sequences; 
Exome Aggregation Consortium [ExAC, http:/
/exac.broadins-
titute.org], 60,706 exome sequences) and 203 in-house control 
exomes (Table 1). The highest allele frequency observed for the 
rare variant (p.K294N) was 0.0003 in Latino populations (ExAC) 
(data not shown). In all 7 of these families for which we had whole 
exome data, the possibility of TEK gene copy number variants 
(CNVs) accounting for a second mutant allele was assessed using 
exome read depth coverage comparisons. Read depth data for each 
of the 23 TEK exons was extracted from the 7 PCG exomes and 
compared with the average read depth obtained from a number of 
unrelated same-batch exome-sequenced samples. In all cases, no 
evidence for additional exon-spanning duplications or deletions 
could be found (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI85830DS1).

investigate this possibility, we generated a p.C224S mutant and 
found that mutation of this paired cysteine led to a similar reduc-
tion in protein abundance (Figure 2B, right panels), confirming the 
critical importance of the disulfide bond for proper folding and 
subsequent expression.
Receptor tyrosine kinases mediate their specific signals 
through distinct tyrosine residues (28), and for TEK-mediated sig-
naling the cytoplasmic C-terminal Tyr1102 and Tyr1108 residues 
play a central role (27, 35, 36). To investigate phosphorylation at 
individual tyrosine residues, we used mass spectrometry together 
with stable isotope labeling in cell culture (SILAC; Figure 2C and 
Supplemental Figure 8). While global phosphorylation of the 
p.K294N mutant was normal, SILAC revealed a 10-fold reduction 
in Tyr1102 phosphorylation (Figure 2, C–E). This site is known to 
mediate signaling through p85-PI3K (35, 36), suggesting that the 
p.K294N mutation results in reduced p85-PI3K signaling activity. 
Based on the critical importance of this site for TEK function (35), 
we propose that p.K294N is a LoF allele. In contrast, no effect on 
basal phosphorylation (i.e., ligand-independent phosphorylation) 
was observed in the p.Y611C mutant (Figure 2C).
ily 4) and p.Y611C (family 5) mutations did not result in reduced 
protein expression or basal global autophosphorylation in this 
system (Figure 2A).
Deletion of exons 2–4 (p.T19_R210del, ΔT_R) results in loss of 
the terminal 4 aa of the signal peptide sequence (MDSLASLVLCG-
VSLLLSGTVEG) and the entire Ig1 and Ig2 domains. To determine 
whether the loss of 4 aa from the signal peptide and/or loss of the Ig1 
domain alone is sufficient to cause receptor degradation, we tested 
a natural splice variant (ENST00000519097) that lacks exon 2 — 
encoding the terminal 5 aa of the signal peptide as well as the first 
Ig domain (Ig1). This splice variant (IgI del) was expressed and phos-
phorylated at normal levels (Figure 2B). Conversely, a form of TEK 
mutant carrying an in-frame somatic deletion of exon 3 and part 
of exon 4 (aa 122–165 of the Ig2 domain [IgII del]) (34) was poorly 
expressed and phosphorylated, indicating that the Ig2 domain is 
important for TEK stability and function (Figure 2B, left panels).
As Cys233 forms a disulfide bridge with Cys224 in the EGF1 
domain (Supplemental Figures 4 and 5), we hypothesized that 
the p.C233Y variant may cause misfolding of the protein, due to 
the disruption of the disulfide bond, followed by degradation. To 
Figure 2. TEK variants lead to reduced autophosphorylation. (A) Western blotting of WT and variant TEK expressed in HEK293 cells, following immu-

were not identified in PCG cohorts. All blotting data are representative of more than 3 biological replicates.

binding (37, 38), subsequent multimerization (38), and subcellu-
lar localization (39–41), we predicted that the mutations in these 
regions could weaken or abolish ligand-mediated activation and 
signal transduction through the intracellular catalytic domain. 
Anticipating that TEK ectodomain mutations may affect ligand-
mediated signaling, we expressed TEK variants in HUVECs and 
examined their subcellular localization after ligand stimulation. 
WT TEK was diffusely expressed on the membrane of resting cells 
(Figure 3A, control WT). When treated with ANGPT1, a major TEK 
agonist, WT TEK localized to cell-cell junctions and subsequently 
became internalized (Figure 3A and Supplemental Figure 9), as 
previously reported (39, 40). The p.K294N mutant also followed 
this dynamic receptor translocation. However, other mutants 
were unable to respond to ANGPT1 stimulus. p.T19_R210del 
formed intracellular aggregates, and p.C233Y was not found at the 
cell membrane (Figure 3A).
WT protein is typically detected within the soluble fraction 
of a cell lysate (Figure 3B), whereas mutant proteins can form 
aggregates inside cells and are found within the insoluble fraction. 
Consistent with subcellular localization studies, p.T19_R210del 
was found in the insoluble fraction (Figure 3B, ΔT_R). Our results 
clearly demonstrate that the deletion of Ig1 and Ig2 domains in 
ΔT_R reduces protein solubility, leading to protein aggregate 
formation, making this allele functionally null. The IgII deletion 
mutant was found in both fractions, and the p.C233Y mutant, 
although not insoluble, was less abundant, suggesting that solu-
bility was not the cause of poor expression (Figure 3B). Other vari-
ants were largely found in the soluble fraction (Figure 3B).
To determine whether proteasomal degradation underlies 
the reduced levels of protein, we treated cells expressing the 
p.T19_R210del or p.C233Y mutant with the proteasomal inhibitor 
MG132. The inhibitor slightly increased WT protein expression 
in the soluble fraction. More prominently for WT and p.C233Y, 
there was a marked increase in insoluble protein following MG132 
treatment (Figure 3C). These data suggest that TEK abundance is 
tightly regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation and that 
structural defects, such as p.C233Y, lead to enhanced protein deg-
radation through this mechanism.
Interestingly, while the p.Y611C mutant is properly localized 
to the plasma membrane in resting cells, upon ANGPT1 stimu-
lation it did not follow the normal course of dynamic clustering, 
junctional localization, and internalization, suggesting that this 
variant is unable to respond to ligand (Figure 3A, Y611C). In order 
to measure changes in ligand-mediated TEK phosphorylation, 
we cotransfected cells with protein tyrosine phosphatase recep-

tor type B (PTPRB) to reduce baseline phosphorylation of coex-
pressed TEK (42). ANGPT1 stimulated the phosphorylation of WT 
TEK but not p.Y611C, further suggesting a defect in ligand-medi-
ated activation (Supplemental Figure 10).
We also experimentally tested the functional impact of the 
two splice donor site mutations, c.760+2T>C (family 7) and 
c.3300+2delT (family 8), in cell-based exon trapping splicing 
assays to determine their effect on mRNA splicing (Figure 4). 
In this system, the c.760+2T>C mutation eliminated the normal 
5′ splice donor site of exon 5, which led to a cryptic splice site 
21 bp into intron 5 (Figure 4, A and C). As the additional 21 bp 
sequence incorporated an in-frame termination codon into exon 
5, it was expected to result in mRNA transcript destruction by 
the nonsense-mediated decay pathway or a severely truncated 
protein product (p.A254Gfs*3). In contrast, the c.3300+2delT 
splice donor site mutation resulted in complete skipping of exon 
22, effectively removing 100 bp from the mRNA transcript and 
changing the codon reading frame by which the last exon would 
be translated (Figure 4, B and C). As a result, exon 23 would 
encode 2 different amino acid residues (Pro-Thr), followed by a 
termination codon instead of the normal 57 C-terminal residues 
(p.Y1068Pfs*3). Consequently, the mRNA would likely escape 
destruction by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, and a 
protein lacking residues 1068–1124, which includes the C-ter-
minal tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr1102 and Tyr1108), 
would be produced. As these two tyrosine residues are critical 
for TEK receptor signaling function (35, 36), we propose that the 
c.3300+2delT mutation represents a LoF allele.
Collectively, our results have demonstrated that 7 of 10 TEK 
mutations identified in our PCG cohort lead to loss of func-
tional protein by multiple cellular mechanisms — absence of 
intact protein production (p.Y307*, p.T19_R210del, c.760+2T>C 
[p.A254Gfs*3], and c.3300+2delT [p.Y1068Pfs*3]), enhanced 
proteasomal degradation (p.C233Y), impaired phosphorylation 
of key tyrosine residue (p.K249N), altered subcellular localiza-
tion and reduced ligand responsiveness (p.Y611C), and protein 
aggregate formation (p.T19_R210del). We reason that the p.G984* 
(family 6), p.K745fs (family 9), and p.E150* (family 10) mutations 
are also likely LoF alleles, as their mRNA transcripts will either be 
destroyed by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway or encode 
proteins lacking at least a functional intracellular domain (See 
Supplemental Figure 2).
TEK haploinsufficiency results in abnormal AHO structure and 
elevated IOP. After proving that the heterozygous TEK mutations 
resulted in nonfunctional proteins, we hypothesized that TEK hap-
loinsufficiency is sufficient to cause impaired SC development and 
ocular hypertension in mice. Using mice harboring a conditional 
by inversion allele (TekCOIN mice) (43), we analyzed AHO drainage 
pathways in Tek hemizygous and conditional knockout mice. Con-
focal microscopy revealed that Tek-haploinsufficient mice devel-
oped a severely hypomorphic canal with convolutions and focal 
narrowing, while SC was normal in control mice (Figures 5–7). SC

mmHg, Tek+/– 15.4 mmHg, P = 0.0046; Figure 5C and Sup-
plemental Figure 11). The IOP levels were modestly cor-
related with the degree of SC hypomorphism (r = 0.3703, 
P < 0.01). These results demonstrate that reduced TEK sig-
naling causes developmental defects of the AHO structure, 
a key feature of PCG, and correlates with elevated IOP.
Discussion
Ocular hypertension has been identified as the most impor-
tant risk factor in human glaucoma, and current glaucoma 
therapy is focused on lowering IOP using pharmacologi-
cal or surgical approaches (1–3, 20, 44, 45). While IOP is 
influenced by both production and drainage of the AH, 
defects in anterior chamber outflow have been identified 
as the source of ocular hypertension in glaucoma patients, 
including PCG patients (5, 46). Despite evidence that 
vascular growth factors are essential for SC development 
and AH outflow (25, 31, 47), links between these pathways 
and human glaucoma have not been identified. Herein, 
we describe 10 heterozygous novel/rare protein-altering 
mutations in TEK as a cause for PCG. Furthermore, our 
findings provide evidence that TEK gene dosage is critical 
for the proper development of AHO pathways, and ~50% 
reduced TEK signaling is sufficient to lead to defective SC 
development and compromised AH drainage in mice as 
well as in patients (Figure 8).
While PCG has clear genetic links, identification of 
causative alleles is complicated by variable disease pen-
etrance and expressivity (5, 9, 12). Families identified in 
our patient cohort were no exception. TEK variants were 
heterozygous in all affected individuals, and the hete-
rozygous disease allele was vertically transmitted from 
the affected parent to the affected child in two families 
(families 1 and 10), clearly indicating dominant transmis-
sion of the disease. Interestingly, the development of glau-
coma in later decades in two mutation carriers in family 
10 (one inferred) and the frequent unilateral involvement 
observed in mutation carriers (6 of 12 in our cohort with a 
TEK mutation versus 34 of 209 in our whole cohort) sug-
gest that TEK-related disease can exhibit variable severity 
and age of onset (Figure 1 and Table 1). This highly vari-
able expressivity may explain the high frequency of carri-
ers without a typical early-onset PCG phenotype in family 
members. It was not possible to carefully examine many 
of the parents of the affected probands with PCG for evidence of 
glaucoma or raised IOP, and given the geographic and historical 
nature of some of the samples, it is not currently possible to gather 
this information. With the limited availability of human data, it is 
difficult to clearly distinguish variable expressivity from reduced 
penetrance. However, the biological plausibility is underscored by 
the mouse data clearly showing that haploinsufficiency for Tek is 
sufficient to lead to functional defects of the AHO pathway with 
variable expressivity. Therefore, we propose an autosomal domi-
nant model with variable expressivity, consistent with other ocular 
disorders of developmental origin, such as those caused by muta-
tions in FOXC1, MYOC, PAX6, and OPA1 (6, 10, 48–52). Variable 
expressivity may be explained by stochastic developmental events 
was completely absent in Tek-knockout mice, clearly demonstrat-
ing the absolute requirement and gene dosage sensitivity for TEK 
during canal development (Figure 5, A and B). Interestingly, quan-
titative analysis identified the variable degree of hypomorphism in 
Tek-hemizygous mice (Figure 6). We further analyzed the iridocor-
neal region using serial histologic sections. Whereas the control WT 
eyes showed well-developed SC and TM, eyes of Tek-hemizygous 
mice showed hypoplastic SC and TM, indicating that reduced TEK 
signaling is detrimental for formation of AHO structures (Figure 7).
To analyze the functional consequence of dysmorphic SC 
development and hypomorphic TM, we analyzed IOP levels by 
rebound tonometry. Measurement of IOP confirmed that haplo-
insufficient mice exhibited a 25% elevation in IOP (control 12.3

gain-of-function (GoF) TEK mutations that 
have been linked with hereditary and sporadic 
venous malformations (VMs) (34, 53, 54). 
These VM mutations are located solely in the 
intracellular domain and result in enhanced 
kinase activity. Furthermore, our cell-based 
assays have identified new functional roles 
for various domains. The Ig2 domain, which 
functions as a ligand-binding domain (37, 38), 
is also critical for stable protein expression, 
as loss of this Ig domain in p.T19_R210del 
and IgII del leads to reduced protein levels. 
The mutation in the EGF1 domain highlights 
the critical role of cysteine residues, which 
are needed to disulfide cross-link the protein 
for stability (38, 55). Notably, the mutation 
in the membrane-proximal fibronectin type 
III (FN3) domain, which appears in ~40% of 
all receptor tyrosine kinases (ref. 28 and the 
Human Protein Reference Database [HPRD], 
http:/
/www.hprd.org), sheds light on its novel 
role in ligand-mediated TEK receptor acti-
vation. The FN3 domain in the Eph family 
tyrosine kinase receptors directly stimulates 
intermolecular interactions to cluster the 
receptor into higher-order multimers at the 
plasma membrane (56). These Eph clusters 
act as efficient signaling centers to trigger 
cell responses and propagate phosphoty-
rosine signals. Although the TEK FN3 crystal 
structure is currently unavailable, the lack of 
membrane response following ANGPT1 stim-
ulation as observed in HUVECs (Figure 3A) is 
likely due to impaired signaling activities.
GoF mutations in patients with VMs 
exhibit variable expressivity and led to the 
hypothesis that tight regulation of TEK 
activity is needed for vascular development 
(34, 54). Our findings that hemizygosity for 
Tek is sufficient to cause disease in mice and that heterozygosity 
for LoF mutations is associated with PCG of varying severity in 
patients suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, that there 
exists a dosage sensitivity for reduced activity of the receptor. 
It is reported that the conventional outflow path for AH drain-
age (i.e., SC) plays a less important role in mice than in humans, 
underscoring the significance of finding elevated IOP in the 
hemizygous mouse model and suggesting similar structural 
defects in SC would cause more severe disease in patients (57–
59). Finally, our data indicate that TEK “dose” might be particu-
larly important for proper development of the vasculature of the 
anterior chamber of the eye, suggesting that regulation of TEK 
signal strength may be a therapeutic option.
In summary, we have identified TEK mutations in patients 
with PCG that follow a dominant inheritance pattern with variable 
expressivity. Our experimental results further demonstrate that 
defects in the AHO pathway caused by reduced TEK signaling 
constitute a new mechanism of PCG disease in humans. It is likely 
in SC formation (25) or oligo-/digenic inheritance. Although we 
have screened 19 “candidate genes,” including the signaling com-
ponents of the ANGPT-TEK pathway (TEK, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, 
TIE1, ANGPT4, and PTPRB), genes expressed during SC devel-
opment (PROX1, FLT4/VEGFR3, and VEGFC), and genes linked 
to various developmental glaucomas (FOXC2, CYP1B1, MYOC, 
FOXC1, OPTN, ASB10, TBK1, WDR36, OPA1, and NTF4), we did 
not identify possible pathogenic variants as a second allele for 
digenic inheritance. Our results also suggest that ascertaining 
future PCG subjects for genetic studies should incorporate thor-
ough, longitudinal ophthalmic examinations of reportedly normal 
parents of affected probands, as they may have subclinical indica-
tors of PCG/glaucoma.
The analysis of PCG mutations in TEK advances our under-
standing of structure-function relationships within the receptor. 
Interestingly, all the deletion and missense mutations identified in 
our PCG cohort were located in the ectodomain and are LoF. The 
location of PCG mutations is strikingly different from that of the

formed using a Nimblegen EZ v3 capture kit (Roche) and 2 × 100 
bp paired-end sequencing on a HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina). All 
exome variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. The TEK gene 
was Sanger sequencing screened in an additional 55 families in the 
primary cohort. An additional 114 families were also screened in a sec-
ondary international cohort (details are provided in the Supplemental 
Material). In total, 189 families containing 209 individuals affected by 
PCG participated in this study.
LoF gene-burden test. A LoF gene-burden test was performed by 
considering only the predicted LoF variants (i.e., stop gain, essential 
splice donor/acceptor, and frameshift insertion/deletion). While 7 
of the 189 PCG probands carried heterozygous predicted LoF vari-
ants in TEK (p.E150*, p.Y307*, p.T19_R210del, p.K745fs, p.G984*, 
c.760+2T>C, and c.3300+2delT), only 2 heterozygous LoF TEK vari-
ants were present in 60,706 subjects in the ExAC cohort. Since large 
deletions (e.g., p.T19_R210del in family 2) would not have been called 
that investigating additional genes involved in the formation and 
maintenance of the AHO pathways will provide further insights to 
our understanding of this devastating eye disease and aid in the 
development of new therapeutic strategies for glaucoma.
Methods
Human study participants. PCG was defined by the following character-
istics: (a) age at onset less than 3 years, (b) increased corneal diameter 
greater than 10 mm accompanied by corneal edema and/or Haab striae, 
and (c) IOP greater than 21 mmHg and/or optic nerve cupping greater 
than 0.4. Any patient with other ocular abnormalities or systemic con-
ditions, other than iris stromal hypoplasia, was excluded from the study. 
Our studies adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and were 
compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Whole exome sequencing. Exome sequencing of the initial PCG 
cohort of 20 families with at least one affected proband was per-

Figure 8. Model for ANGPT-TEK signal strength and human disease. 
Schematic model shows the importance of ANGPT-TEK signal 
strength as a critical determinant of ocular and nonocular vascular 
phenotypes. In the complete absence of ANGPT-TEK signaling after 
embryonic day 17.5, SC is not formed and conditional null mice exhibit 
a severe PCG-like phenotype (31). 50% reduction of the signal leads 
to severely hypomorphic SC formation with elevated IOP in mice, and 
PCG in humans with variable expressivity. In human patients, GoF 
mutations in TEK result in VMs in nonocular tissues (34, 53, 54). A 
frontal view of SC is illustrated in this figure.

konradjk/loftee), we excluded this variant from our LoF gene-bur-
den analysis. Thereby, we compared 6 of 189 PCG families with 2 of 
60,706 individuals in ExAC.
In silico functional studies. PolyPhen-2 (60, 61) and SIFT (version 
5.2.2) (62) were used to predict any functional effects that TEK mis-
sense variants may have on protein function. To analyze the effect 
of missense variants on protein structure, FoldX (63) analyses were 
performed using known crystal structures when available. For the 
two splice donor variants (c.760+2T>C, c.3300+2delT), we used HSF 
version 3.0 (64) and Automatic Analysis of SNP sites (AASsites) (65) 
to analyze whether the variants can cause changes in splice sites. 
Detailed protocols are available in the Supplemental Material.
Tissue culture and proteomics. TEK expression constructs were 
created by cloning full-length TEK cDNA and incorporating a 3′ 
Flag-tag sequence into the pcDNA3.1 vector. Site-directed mutagen-
esis and synthesized DNAs were used to generate variant TEK-Flag 
expression vectors. Total TEK phosphorylation was determined by 
Western blotting following immunoprecipitation. TEK solubility 
was analyzed by separating cell lysates into soluble and insoluble 
fractions. Protein localization studies were performed by transfect-
ing HUVECs with the TEK-Flag vectors and immunostaining using 
standard protocols. For SILAC analysis, WT TEK-Flag was trans-
fected into light isotope–labeled cells and PCG variants into heavy 
isotope–labeled cells. The heavy/light ratio of phosphorylated pep-
tides identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was calculated by quantification node, 
and the ratio was normalized by protein abundance. Detailed proto-
cols are available in the Supplemental Material.
Exon trapping splicing assay. Genomic DNA fragments containing 
TEK exons 5–6 and exon 22 from affected individuals and a control sub-
ject were cloned into the exon trapping vector pSPL3. Total RNA from 
exon trapping construct–transfected Cos-7 cells were reverse-tran-
scribed and PCR-amplified. The resulting RT-PCR products from WT 
and mutant minigenes were visualized by gel electrophoresis, and their 
sequence composition was determined by Sanger sequencing. Detailed 
protocols are provided in the Supplemental Material.
Mice and breeding. Tek WT (Tek+/+), hemizygous (Tek+/–), and 
homozygous knockout (Tek cKO) mice were generated by crossing 
TekCOIN mice with ROSA-rtTA;tetO-Cre mice (Supplemental Figure 12). 
These mouse lines were described previously (30, 31). Doxycycline 
was added to the drinking water of pregnant dams from embryonic 
day 17.5 to induce Tek deletion. IOP was measured using a TONOLAB 
rebound tonometer (iCare). TEK expression in lung lysates was ana-
lyzed by standard blotting procedures. SC imaging was performed as 
previously described (31). Mice were maintained on a mixed back-
ground, and littermate controls were used for all analyses. Detailed 
protocols are available in the Supplemental Material.
Statistics. Comparisons of IOP between Tek+/– and WT mice were 
analyzed by unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test using GraphPad Prism 
software. The LoF gene-burden test was performed using JMP Pro 
11 software, and a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for testing 
the statistical significance. A P value less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
