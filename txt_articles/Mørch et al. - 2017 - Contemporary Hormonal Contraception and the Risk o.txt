BACKGROUND
Little is known about whether contemporary hormonal contraception is associated 
with an increased risk of breast cancer.
METHODS
We assessed associations between the use of hormonal contraception and the risk 
of invasive breast cancer in a nationwide prospective cohort study involving all 
women in Denmark between 15 and 49 years of age who had not had cancer or 
venous thromboembolism and who had not received treatment for infertility. 
Nationwide registries provided individually updated information about the use of 
hormonal contraception, breast-cancer diagnoses, and potential confounders.
RESULTS
Among 1.8 million women who were followed on average for 10.9 years (a total of 
19.6 million person-years), 11,517 cases of breast cancer occurred. As compared 
with women who had never used hormonal contraception, the relative risk of 
breast cancer among all current and recent users of hormonal contraception was 
1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.26). This risk increased from 1.09 
(95% CI, 0.96 to 1.23) with less than 1 year of use to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.51) 
with more than 10 years of use (P 
= 
0.002). After discontinuation of hormonal 
contraception, the risk of breast cancer was still higher among the women who 
had used hormonal contraceptives for 5 years or more than among women who 
had not used hormonal contraceptives. Risk estimates associated with current or 
recent use of various oral combination (estrogen–progestin) contraceptives varied 
between 1.0 and 1.6. Women who currently or recently used the progestin-only 
intrauterine system also had a higher risk of breast cancer than women who had 
never used hormonal contraceptives (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33). The 
overall absolute increase in breast cancers diagnosed among current and recent 
users of any hormonal contraceptive was 13 (95% CI, 10 to 16) per 100,000 person-
years, or approximately 1 extra breast cancer for every 7690 women using hormonal 
contraception for 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS
The risk of breast cancer was higher among women who currently or recently used 
contemporary hormonal contraceptives than among women who had never used 
hormonal contraceptives, and this risk increased with longer durations of use; 
however, absolute increases in risk were small. (Funded by the Novo Nordisk 
Foundation.)

Hormonal Contraception and Breast-Cancer Risk
A
n estimated 140 million women 
worldwide use hormonal contraception; 
this number accounts for approximately 
13% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 
years.1 In Denmark, this percentage increased 
from 24% in 1995 to 39% in 2012.2,3
Estrogen promotes the development of breast 
cancer, the leading cancer in women worldwide, 
whereas the role of progestin is more complex.4 
Uncertainties remain regarding the association 
between the use of hormonal contraception and 
the risk of breast cancer. Previous, mainly case–
control, studies that showed positive associations 
between the use of oral contraceptives and 
breast-cancer risk were generally conducted when 
the estrogen dose in combined (estrogen–pro-
gestin) hormonal contraceptives was higher than 
it is today and before the availability of products 
with new progestins and new routes of delivery.5 
New methods such as the levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system, contraceptive patches, vaginal 
rings, progestin-only implants, and injections now 
account for almost one third of all hormonal 
contraceptives used in many countries, includ-
ing Denmark.3 Concern regarding the progestin 
content of hormonal contraceptives has arisen 
because studies have indicated that the addition 
of progestin appears to increase the risk of breast 
cancer among postmenopausal women who re-
ceive hormone therapy.6-11
Studies of breast-cancer risk among women 
who receive hormonal contraceptives show in-
consistent findings — from no elevation in risk 
to a 20 to 30% increase in risk.12-29 Most studies 
have assessed women according to whether they 
were current, recent, or past users of oral con-
traceptives or whether they had ever used oral 
contraceptives. Few studies have examined spe-
cific combined oral contraceptives containing 
various progestins,13,16,17,25,27,29 particularly newer 
products containing desogestrel, gestodene, or 
drospirenone, and none have been large enough 
to provide robust risk estimates for specific com-
binations. Little is known about breast-cancer 
risk with the use of progestin-only contraception 
or nonoral hormonal contraception. Also, most 
of the collective evidence relates to postmeno-
pausal women, although limited information 
suggests that use at a young age may confer a 
higher risk than initiation of use later.5,30,31 We 
report on a nationwide epidemiologic analysis of 
breast-cancer risk among women of reproductive 
age who were using currently available hormonal 
contraception.
Methods
Study Oversight
The Danish Data Protection Agency and the 
Danish Health Data Board approved the study. 
In Denmark, ethics approval is not required for 
registry-based studies. The study was supported 
by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, which had no 
role in the study design, data analysis or inter-
pretation, writing of the manuscript, or the deci-
sion to publish the manuscript. The first and 
last authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and analyses.
Study Population
The Danish Sex Hormone Register Study, which 
was established to assess the influence of hor-
mone use on the risks of cardiovascular disease 
and cancer, follows a national cohort of Danish 
women between 15 and 79 years of age. The 
personal identification number in the Danish 
Civil Registration System was used to merge 
data from several nationwide registries (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The 
study has been described in detail previously.32,33 
Since data from the National Register of Me-
dicinal Product Statistics are complete from 
January 1, 1995, this was the study start date.
All women living in Denmark who were be-
tween 15 and 49 years of age on January 1, 1995, 
and those who subsequently were 15 years of age 
before December 31, 2012 (a total of 1,837,297 
women) were eligible unless they immigrated 
to Denmark after 1995. After the exclusion of 
women who had cancer (except nonmelanoma 
skin cancer) or venous thromboembolism and 
women who had received treatment for infertil-
ity (defined as a filled prescription for ovarian-
stimulation drugs before study entry), a total of 
1,797,932 women were included in the study 
population.
Hormonal Contraception
The National Register of Medicinal Product Sta-
tistics provided information on filled prescrip-
tions (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Use of hormonal contraception was updated 
throughout the follow-up period, and the status 
of women changed when they discontinued or 
changed the type of hormonal contraception 
used. All durations of prescriptions were extend-
ed by up to 28 days to account for delays in initi-
ating use after the contraceptive was purchased.34 
This extension was also made if no further 
contraceptive was purchased. Use of hormonal 
contraceptives was categorized as current use or 
recent use (discontinuation within the previous 
6 months) or previous use (discontinuation more 
than 6 months previously). Start of use was the 
date that the prescription was purchased. The 
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was 
assumed to be used for 4 years, unless the 
woman became pregnant or another hormonal 
contraceptive was prescribed before the end of 
the 4-year period.
Breast Cancer
The Danish Cancer Registry was used to identify 
primary invasive breast cancers. Cancer diagno-
ses were classified according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code C50.
Confounding Factors
Information about potential confounders (speci-
fied below) was ascertained from other nation-
wide registries (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). A bias analysis assessed potential 
influences from unmeasured confounders.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed according to Poisson regres-
sion with the use of SAS software, version 9.1 
(SAS Institute), to calculate incidence-rate ratios 
(referred to as relative risks) and 95% confidence 
intervals. Five-year age bands were used as a time 
scale in the Poisson regression. The study popu-
lation was followed until the first diagnosis of 
breast cancer, death, registry-recorded emigra-
tion, age of 50 years, or the end of follow-up on 
December 31, 2012. Data on women were cen-
sored permanently at the time of a diagnosis of 
cancer or venous thromboembolism or the use of 
treatment of infertility, and they were censored 
temporarily during pregnancy and for 6 months 
after every delivery (i.e., after a pregnancy of >22 
weeks of gestation).
Simple adjusted models included time-depen-
dent information on use of hormonal contracep-
tion, age, and calendar year. In addition, fully 
adjusted models included the following: level of 
education, parity, the polycystic ovary syndrome, 
endometriosis, and family history of breast or 
ovarian cancer. Adjustment for body-mass index, 
smoking status, and age of the woman at first 
delivery was made when this information was 
recorded for parous women, and these data were 
assessed as complete-case analyses. Subgroup 
analyses were conducted (Table S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The reference group was 
women who had never used hormonal contra-
ception at a given time during follow-up.
Tests for the effects of duration were per-
formed as likelihood ratio tests comparing risk 
models with no history of use, previous use, and 
durations of use (or time since use) with the cor-
responding model in which duration categories 
were collapsed into one category. Exploratory 
analyses were used to test differences between 
relative risks associated with various preparations 
with the use of chi-square tests. Bonferroni cor-
rection was made for multiple comparisons in 
analyses comparing specific preparations with 
one another. We did not adjust for multiple com-
parisons in other analyses.
We calculated age-standardized incidence 
rates per 100,000 person-years using the age 
distribution of the cohort as the standard. Age-
standardized absolute risk differences (incidence 
ratesexposed 
− 
incidence ratesunexposed) and the num-
ber needed to harm (1/[incidence ratesexposed 
− 
 
incidence ratesunexposed]) were also calculated.
Results
From 1995 through 2012, with a mean (±SD) 
follow-up of 10.9±5.8 years, a total of 19.6 mil-
lion person-years and 11,517 incident breast 
cancers had accumulated in 1,797,932 women 
between the ages of 15 and 49 years. Before the 
first switch to another hormonal contraceptive, 
14.0 million person-years and 9101 incident 
breast cancers had accumulated in the cohort. 
Characteristics of the study population are listed 
in Table 1, and in Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
As compared with women who had never used 
hormonal contraceptives, the relative risk of 
breast cancer among all current or recent users of 
any hormonal contraception was 1.20 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.26) (Table 2). The

Hormonal Contraception and Breast-Cancer Risk
risk of breast cancer increased with the duration 
of use, from 1.09 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.23) with less 
than 1 year of use to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.26 to 1.51) 
after more than 10 years of use (P 
= 
0.002) (Ta-
ble 2). As compared with women who had never 
used hormonal contraception, an increased risk 
of breast cancer was observed among woman 
who had previously used hormonal contraception 
for long periods of time (i.e., ≥5 years). Among 
these women, the risk appeared to remain in-
creased for at least 5 years after discontinuation 
(Table 3). No increased risk was found among 
women who had previously used hormonal con-
traception for less than 5 years.
There was little evidence of major differences 
among women who used various combined oral 
contraceptives (Table 4). Few significant differ-
ences were detected when various preparations 
were compared, and the differences were no longer 
significant after adjustment for multiple testing.
The relative risks of breast cancer associated 
with triphasic and monophasic preparations con-
taining levonorgestrel were similar (1.21 [95% 
CI, 1.04 to 1.41] and 1.45 [95% CI, 1.26 to 1.67], 
respectively; P 
= 
0.07). Risk estimates for com-
bined pills containing norethisterone or levo-
norgestrel and 50 μg of estrogen were similar to 
combinations with the same progestins com-
bined with 20 to 40 μg of estrogen (Table 4). 
When analyses were adjusted for the estrogen dose 
in each product, the overall relative risk of breast 
cancer associated with current or recent use was 
attenuated; the relative risk associated with ges-
todene products remained significantly elevated 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). For 
each oral contraceptive containing 20 to 40 μg 
of estrogen, the risk of breast cancer appeared to 
depend on the duration of use, although the ef-
fect of duration was significant only for prod-
ucts containing gestodene (P 
= 
0.003) (Table 5).
Among women who used the levonorgestrel-
releasing intrauterine system, the relative risk of 
breast cancer was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33), 
which did not differ significantly from the risk 
with products containing oral levonorgestrel alone 
(Table 4). There were few breast-cancer events 
among users of the progestin-only implant and 
depot medroxyprogesterone acetate.
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses
Each subgroup analysis had less precise risk esti-
mates than the main analyses. Even so, broadly 
similar risk patterns were observed among 
women who had used hormonal contraceptives 
for at least 5 years before inclusion in the analy-
sis (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Risk estimates among women who were younger 
than 35 years of age showed limited evidence of 
major differences among the products, apart from 
a suggestion of larger risk estimates for levo-
norgestrel products (Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Results among nulliparous women 
were generally similar to those of the main 
analyses (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). There was a suggestion that initiation of 
use of hormonal contraceptives before 20 years 
of age may be associated with enhanced risks of 
breast cancer, especially with long durations of 
use, although the risk estimates were imprecise 
(Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). Re-
sults among women who were followed until the 
first change from one type of hormonal contra-
ception to another were similar to those in the 
main analyses. Details are provided in Table S10 
through S12 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Sensitivity analyses with adjustment for age 
according to 1-year age groups did not materi-
ally change the main estimates. Simple and fully 
adjusted results were similar. Additional adjust-
ment for body-mass index, smoking, and age at 
first birth in parous women did not materially 
change estimates. A quantitative bias analysis

Hormonal Contraception and Breast-Cancer Risk
showed that a hypothetical unmeasured con-
founder would need to have a 50% prevalence in 
the population, increase the risk of breast cancer 
by a factor of 3, and increase the chance of using 
hormonal contraception by 2.5 times in order to 
eliminate the observed relative risk with current 
or recent use of hormonal contraception (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
The age-standardized incidence rates for breast 
cancer and absolute risk differences per 100,000 
person-years are shown in Tables 2, 4, and 5. 
The difference in the risk of breast cancer be-
tween women who had never used hormonal 
contraception and current and recent users of 
any type of hormonal contraception was 13 (95% 
CI, 10 to 16) per 100,000 person-years; approxi-
mately one extra breast cancer was diagnosed for 
every 7690 women using hormonal contraception 
for 1 year.
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study, the current or 
recent use of hormonal contraception was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of breast cancer than 
the risk among women who had never used 
hormonal contraceptives, with little evidence of 
major differences between specific combined 
oral contraceptives. The risk increased with the 
duration of use.
The collaborative reanalysis of data from in-
dividual women5 showed that among the women 
who were currently using combined oral contra-
ceptives, the relative risk of breast cancer was 
1.24 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.33), which is close to our 
estimate of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.26) for all 
combined oral products. In line with our data, 
other studies have not shown consistent differ-
ences among women who used older combined 
oral contraceptives (from the 1970s and 1980s) 
that had a different progestin content.13,15,16,18,25,29
Our data showed a higher risk of breast can-
cer with a longer duration of use of combined 
products with various progestins, although the 
effect of duration was only significant for the 
largest product group containing gestodene. A 
duration-of-use relationship has not been shown 
in most studies assessing long-term contraceptive 
use,5,21 possibly because many included a large 
proportion of postmenopausal women whose 
past use of oral contraceptives before menopause 
was unlikely to influence the breast-cancer risk 
estimates greatly.5,13,27 Studies that have strati-
fied data according to menopausal status have also 
shown a higher risk of breast cancer among pre-
menopausal woman who have used hormonal 
contraceptives for long periods of time than 
among those who have used them for short peri-
ods of time.22,24,25
Our results suggest the rapid disappearance 
of excess risk of breast cancer after discontinua-
tion of use among women who have used hor-
monal contraceptives for short periods, where-
as the risk among women who have used these 
contraceptives for longer periods may persist for 
at least 5 years after discontinuation. In the col-
laborative reanalysis, the slightly higher risk 
among former users of combined oral contra-
ceptives disappeared within 5 years.5 Other stud-
ies have shown no evidence of persisting risk 
several years after the discontinuation of oral 
contraception.22,24,25 Study differences may be due 
to variations in the mean duration of use. Since 
our data mostly comprised women who used 
hormonal contraception for less than 5 years, 
our overall results indicated only a slightly higher 
risk of breast cancer among past users than 
among women who had never used hormonal 
contraception.
Few studies have assessed progestin-only con-
traception and breast-cancer risk. In a cohort 
of 93,843 women who used the levonorgestrel-
releasing intrauterine system, a relative risk of 
breast cancer of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.25) was 
found, as compared with the general incidence 
rate among Finnish women younger than 55 years 
of age35; we found a similar risk estimate. The 
absence of an association between the duration 
of use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine 
system and breast-cancer risk might be explained 
by the system providing a decreasing dose of 
progestin released according to the time since 
insertion. Studies suggest a considerable systemic 
uptake of levonorgestrel in women who use the 
intrauterine system, with plasma concentrations 
in some women that are similar to those in 
women who use levonorgestrel-only pills.36-38
Our nationwide prospective study involving 
1.8 million Danish women who were followed 
for almost 11 years adds substantively to the 
sparse evidence base about contemporary hor-
monal contraception. The linkage of cancer and 
pharmacy records allowed us to incorporate time-
varying exposure information about changes in

contraceptives used and discontinuation of use. 
The large number of events allowed for assess-
ment of recently marketed combined prepara-
tions, various durations of use, progestin-only 
products, and various routes of administration, 
including the intrauterine system.
This study had some limitations. We were not 
able to adjust for age at menarche, breast-feeding, 
alcohol consumption, or physical activity, and we 
had information on body-mass index only for 
parous women. Although some of these vari-
ables may be correlated with both breast-cancer 
risk and hormonal contraception, they would be 
expected to continue to influence a woman’s 
risk after discontinuation of hormonal contra-
ceptives; in contrast, we found that risks among 
women who used hormonal contraception for 
less than 5 years rapidly decreased after discon-
tinuation of hormonal contraception.
Furthermore, we would not expect differences 
in the levels of these potential confounding fac-
tors with various durations of hormonal contra-
ceptive use. Information about some of the poten-
tial confounders that we included in our models 
was not available for the oldest women, because 
the Danish National Health Register started in 
1976. Analyses that were restricted to women 
younger than 35 years of age showed larger risk 
estimates for combined products with levonor-
gestrel and for the levonorgestrel-releasing intra-
uterine system, suggesting that missing infor-
mation about potential confounders in older 
women is unlikely to have led to overestimation 
of overall risk estimates for these products. Re-
sidual confounding is also possible; for example, 
information about the polycystic ovary syndrome 
and endometriosis was available only for women 
who had been hospitalized with these condi-
tions, and we adjusted only for a family history 
of premenopausal breast or ovarian cancer. 
Women with any family history of breast cancer 
might be less likely to use hormonal contracep-
tion, which might underestimate the risk esti-
mate.4,6-11 Quantitative bias analysis, however, 
suggests that to explain the main finding, a 
confounder would need to be highly prevalent in 
the population (50%) and strongly associated 
with breast cancer (by a factor of 3) and use of 
hormonal contraception (an odds ratio of 2.5) 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix); such 
an unknown confounder appears to be unlikely.
Information was not available about exposure 
to hormonal contraceptives before study entry. 
Some women who did not purchase a hormonal 
contraceptive during the study period (and so 
were classified as never having used hormonal 
contraception) may have used hormonal contra-
ception beforehand. Such misclassification (left 
censor bias) would underestimate breast-cancer 
risk among women who used hormonal contra-
ceptives. Analyses that were restricted to women 
with at least 5 years of contraceptive history 
before inclusion in the analysis generally pro-
duced results that were similar to those of the 
main analysis. Some women might have stopped 
taking hormonal contraception even though their 
prescription length indicated that they were still 
users; such misclassification would also be ex-
pected to lead to underestimates of the risk of 
breast cancer among women who use hormonal 
contraception.
If women who were currently using hormonal 
contraception were screened for breast cancer 
more often than those who were not, we would 
expect to see a decreased breast-cancer risk 
among former users because of a reduced detec-
tion rate after the more intensive screening 
while the women were current users. This was 
not apparent in our data. Finally, we did not 
adjust for multiple statistical testing in the main 
analyses, and this might explain some of the 
associations observed. However, the findings 
were consistent across many analyses including 
various types of hormonal contraception.
The estimated number of additional breast 
cancers that were associated with hormonal 
contraception did not include extra cases diag-
nosed after the discontinuation of long-term use. 
Even so, the estimated number of additional 
breast cancers among premenopausal women 
that were attributable to hormonal contraception 
is likely to be low. This risk should be weighed 
against important benefits of hormonal contra-
ceptives such as good contraceptive efficacy and 
reduced risks of ovarian, endometrial, and per-
haps colorectal cancer (at least for combined 
oral contraceptives that were commonly used in 
the 1970s and 1980s).39
