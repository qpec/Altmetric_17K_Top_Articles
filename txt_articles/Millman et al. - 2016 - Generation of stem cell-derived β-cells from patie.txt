We recently reported the scalable in vitro production of functional stem cell-derived b-cells
(SC-b cells). Here we extend this approach to generate the first SC-b cells from type 1
diabetic patients (T1D). b-cells are destroyed during T1D disease progression, making it
difficult to extensively study them in the past. These T1D SC-b cells express b-cell markers,
respond to glucose both in vitro and in vivo, prevent alloxan-induced diabetes in mice and
respond to anti-diabetic drugs. Furthermore, we use an in vitro disease model to demonstrate
the cells respond to different forms of b-cell stress. Using these assays, we find no major
differences in T1D SC-b cells compared with SC-b cells derived from non-diabetic patients.
These results show that T1D SC-b cells could potentially be used for the treatment of
diabetes, drug screening and the study of b-cell biology.

atient-derived
human
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(hiPSCs),
differentiated
to
disease-relevant
cells,
are
becoming quite important due to their potential for cell
replacement therapy and drug screening, as well as improving our
understanding of the pathophysiology of disease. Type 1 diabetes
(T1D) occurs by autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic
b-cells, and genome-wide association studies have revealed that
most genetic loci associated with T1D are affiliated with the
immune system. However, several loci and related networks are
expressed in the b-cells or are otherwise non-immune1–3.
The role intrinsic defects in b-cells from patients, such as
reduced mass and function or susceptibility and response to
stress, may play in initiating the disease remains unclear1–7.
Furthermore, what T1D patient-specific barriers, if there are any,
may impede the use of autologous hiPSC technology for cell
replacement therapy are unknown. As b-cells are destroyed
during disease progression, procurement of b-cells from T1D
patients that have not undergone disease-related environmental
stress for study has not been possible.
Transplantation of exogenous b-cells to replace dead or
dysfunctional endogenous b-cells is a potential strategy for
controlling blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. Allogeneic
transplantation of cadaveric islets has already been performed on
patients with positive clinical results, but this approach suffers
from a limited islet supply and the requirement that patients
remain on immunosupressants8. Human pluripotent stem cells9,
including both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)10–13 and
hiPSC13–16, provide the basis for potentially unlimited numbers
of replacement cells. Several groups have detailed the generation
of early and intermediate cell types from human pluripotent stem
cells, such as definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitors10–
13. Cells that express low levels of insulin, but few other b-cell
markers, have been generated from T1D hiPSC previously.
However, these cells have been of limited utility, as they do not
resemble bona fide b-cells, lack function in vitro and in vivo, mis-
express b-cell and other islet genes, and lack correct granular
ultrastructure15,16. In recent times, we reported the generation
of SC-b cells from both hESC- and hiPSC-derived from
non-diabetic (ND) donors that have many of the defining
features of b-cells, including its function both in vitro and in vivo,
b-cell marker expression and the ability to control glucose levels
in diabetic mice17,18. Other groups have reported similar
protocols and findings19,20.
Here we use this novel technology to generate SC-b cells from
T1D hiPSC for the first time. These cells, referred to as T1D SC-b
cells,
express
markers
found
in
b-cells,
are
functionally
indistinguishable from ND SC-b cells in vitro and in vivo, and
prevent alloxan-induced diabetes in mice. Insulin secretion is
increased in these T1D SC-b cells in response to several categories
of anti-diabetic drugs. Furthermore, we show that these cells
respond to different types of chemically induced stress, develop
an in vitro disease model of T1D SC-b cell stress and demonstrate
a partial rescue of this stress phenotype with treatment of a small
molecule (an Alk5 inhibitor). T1D SC-b cells can be used to
better study diabetes and as a potential autologous source for cell
replacement therapy.
Results
Derivation and in vitro assessment of T1D SC-b cells. To
generate T1D and ND SC-b cells, we derived and characterized
hiPSC from skin fibroblasts of patient donors (Fig. 1a,b).
As described previously15, we found both T1D and ND hiPSC
to
express
pluripotent
stem
cell
markers,
differentiate
to
express markers of all three germ layers and, after undergoing
planar
differentiation
to
pancreatic
progenitors,
produce
PDX1 þ /NKX6-1 þ cells that can be transplanted into mice
to spontaneously generate glucose-responsive cells in vivo
(Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).
After T1D and ND hiPSC derivation and characterization, we
adapted the cells to suspension culture to undergo differentiation
to produce SC-b cells (Fig. 1c)17. We generated numerous batches
of cells from all six cell lines. A batch of cells is a single flask of
cells that has undergone the entire differentiation protocol and is
considered a single biological replicate. Both T1D and ND hiPSC
are capable of differentiating to SC-b cells that co-express
C-peptide þ /NKX6-1 þ
and C-peptide þ /PDX1 þ , with few
cells expressing the a-cell hormone glucagon (Fig. 1d). When
quantified by flow cytometry, we found on average 24±2% and
27±2% of cells co-expressed C-peptide þ /NKX6-1 þ for T1D
and ND cells, respectively (Fig. 1e), similar to what we previously
reported with hESCs and ND hiPSCs17. Furthermore, when
analysed with electron microscopy, both T1D and ND SC-b cells
contained developing and mature insulin granules that are similar
to b-cell granules (Supplementary Fig. 3)17.
T1D SC-b cells function and respond to anti-diabetic drugs.
We next tested the cells with an in vitro glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion assay, to assess their function. We found that
both T1D and ND SC-b cells can respond to sequential
glucose challenges (Supplementary Fig. 4). On average for 18
biological batches (9 for T1D and 9 for ND), T1D and ND SC-b
cells secrete 2.0±0.4 and 1.9±0.3 mIU of human insulin per 103
cells in response to 20 mM glucose and have stimulation indexes
(ratio of insulin released at 20–2 mM glucose) of 1.9 and 2.2,
respectively (Fig. 1f). On average, T1D and ND cells responded to
88% and 78% of the challenges, respectively. Insulin content was
similar between the two groups, 210±40 mIU per 103 cells and
220±20 mIU per 103 for T1D (n ¼ 3 batches, 1 from each donor)
and ND (n ¼ 3 batches, 1 from each donor), respectively. Overall,
these T1D SC-b cells function similar to ND SC-b cells generated
in this study and to our previous report of SC-b cells and adult
primary islets17.
As a proof-of-concept for their possible use in drug screening,
a subset of T1D and ND SC-b cell lines were treated with three
anti-diabetic compounds that affect insulin secretion by different
mechanisms:
Sulfonylurea
(tolbutamide),
GLP-1R
agonist
(Liraglutide)
and
GCK
activator
(LY2608204)
(Fig.
1g).
Treatment with each of the three compounds increases insulin
release at both low- and high-glucose challenges compared with
control by a factor of 2.0 on average.
T1D SC-b cells function after transplantation. To evaluate their
potential use in cell replacement therapy and in vivo physiological
tests and further confirm their identity as SC-b cells, T1D and
ND SC-b cells were transplanted underneath the kidney capsule
of ND immunocompromised mice (Fig. 2a). After 2 weeks, graft
function was evaluated by measuring serum human insulin before
and
30 min
after
an
injection
of
glucose
(Fig.
2b
and
Supplementary Table 1). At this early time point, human insulin
is detected and the grafts were glucose responsive in most, but not
all, mice. Overall, 81% (26/32) and 77% (37/48) secreted more
human insulin after glucose injection, for T1D and ND SC-b
cells, respectively. The ratio of insulin secretion after glucose
challenge compared with before challenge averaged 1.4 and 1.5,
for T1D and ND SC-b cells, respectively. Again, no major
differences between these T1D and ND SC-b cells were
observed17. Immunostaining of recovered grafts revealed clusters
of C-peptide þ cells with some glucagon þ cells (Fig. 2c).

 continuing to respond to glucose injections and high amounts of
human insulin being detected in the serum (Fig. 2d,e). After
3–4 months, a subset of mice were treated with alloxan to
selectively kill mouse but not human b-cells21, to evaluate the
ability of T1D and ND SC-b cells to maintain euglycemia
(Fig. 2a,c). Destruction of endogenous mouse b-cells was
confirmed by demonstrating the absence of serum mouse
C-peptide. Mice that did not receive a SC-b cell graft but were
treated with alloxan died within 29 days of alloxan treatment.
Mice were observed for up to 80 days after alloxan treatment, for

 a total of 164–192 days since SC-b cell transplantation, with mice
that received either T1D or ND SC-b cells maintaining on
average o200 mg dl � 1 fasting blood glucose (Fig. 2f), secreting
human insulin in response to a glucose injection (Fig. 2g) and
rapidly clearing glucose after a glucose injection (Fig. 2h,i).
This data shows that grafts continue to function for 45 months
in vivo.
Development of a disease model of T1D SC-b cell stress. The
results summarized above support the conclusion that T1D
SC-b cell function is similar to that of ND SC-b cells both in vitro
and in vivo. To further compare the two types of SC-b cells,
we focused on a subset of cell lines and employed a method
we recently reported to analyse global gene expression from fixed,
immunostained
and

populations.

 Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data 1)17,22. There is
little, if any, major difference between these T1D and ND SC-b
cells as indicated by the clustering of the samples. Furthermore,
these cells clustered with our previously reported hESC SC-b cells
and adult cadaveric b-cells, but are distinct from fetal b-cells and
from T1D and ND hiPSC that had undergone a control planar
protocol that produces dysfunctional insulin-expressing cells.
Increased cellular susceptibility to exogenous stress has been
reported in patient-derived hiPSC from some diseases, including
ALS and Wolfram syndrome23,24. Similarly, b-cells are known to
be susceptible to stress, which may play a role in initiating
diabetes3–5,25,26. To study this in T1D, the in vitro-derived SC-b
cells were acutely subjected to several chemical stressors and the
persistence of SC-b cells was evaluated through assessment of the
co-expression of b-cell markers C-peptide þ /NKX6-1 þ (Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Fig. 6). Many of the stress treatments reduced
the fraction of cells co-expressing C-peptideþ /NKX6-1þ , with the
cytokine stress cocktail (a combination of interleukin-1b (IL),
tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF) and interferon-g (IFN)) resulting
in the largest reduction.
Given the role that cytokines and inflammation are thought to
play in T1D25, we chose to further investigate the effects of
interleukin-1b, tumour necrosis factor-a and interferon-g on T1D
and ND SC-b cells. Cytokine treatment results in the rapid loss of
not only C-peptide þ cells that co-express NKX6-1 þ but also
cells that co-express MAFAþ
(Supplementary Fig. 7) and
PDX1þ . The reduction of MAFA and NKX6-1 precedes PDX1,
as has been reported for primary human b-cells27 (Fig. 3c).
We hypothesized that the T1D SC-b cells would be more sensitive
to cytokine-induced stress than ND SC-b cells, as has been
reported in other patient hiPSC disease systems23,24. However, no
detectable difference in the T1D and ND SC-b response to
cytokine-induced stress was observed (Fig. 3d).
The stress conditions identified in Fig. 3 provide the potential
basis for a human disease model drug-discovery platform. To
demonstrate its utility for drug screening, cells in this cytokine
stress assay were treated with Alk5 inhibitor type II (Alk5i), a
compound that was previously identified to prevent stress-induced
phenotypic loss in mouse b-cells28. With human SC-b cells,
treatment with Alk5i partially blocks loss of C-peptide þ /NKX6-
1 þ cells, improving retention by 32% (Fig. 3e,f).
Discussion
In summary, we demonstrate that functional SC-b cells can be
generated from hiPSC derived from T1D patients in vitro
(Fig. 1a–c). These cells are very similar to those we previously
reported for hESC and ND hiPSC SC-b cell and are similar but
not identical to adult b-cells17. T1D SC-b cells express markers
found in b-cells, including NKX6-1 and PDX1, and have global
gene expression patterns similar to adult b-cells (Figs 1d,e
and 3a). T1D SC-b cells are functional in vitro and in vivo,
responding to glucose challenges by increasing their human
insulin release and controlling glucose levels in diabetic mice after
transplantation (Fig. 2). After exposure to chemical-induced
stress, T1D SC-b cells lose expression of b-cell markers
(Fig. 3b,e). These cells also respond to cytokine stress, which
can be partially prevented by treatment with Alk5i (Fig. 3b–f)28.
Finally, these cells also respond to known anti-diabetic drugs that
cause increased insulin secretion (Fig. 1g).
These experimental approaches could directly be used for
discovery of novel compounds that increase function and prevent
stress and death in b-cells. The usefulness of these cells could be
further enhanced by a combination with recently reported genetic
modification strategies, for example, by the use of TALEN or
CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce or correct known diabetes-associated
mutations29,30 or engineering reporter constructs to improve
functional readout31.
Overall, we do not observe major differences in SC-b cells
derived from T1D and ND patients with the assays and cell lines
used in this report. It is important to note that this does not mean
differences do not exist in T1D b-cells compared with ND b-cells.
One possibility is that defects or differences would appear after
extended culture or many years after transplantation. Diabetes
generally develops over a long period, and we did not test for the
effects of ageing. In addition, investigating how T1D SC-b cells
interact with the immune system would be quite informative.
Indeed, the gene with the largest differential expression in T1D
and ND SC-b cells is TAP1, a peptide transporter associated with
the major histocompatibility complex that has been implicated in
with T1D32. In addition, it is important to note that the three
T1D donors used in this study do not represent the whole T1D
population; differences among patients are likely to exist.
The lack of observable gross deficiencies in T1D SC-b cells
combined with their functional phenotype indicates the potential
utility of these autologous cells in cell replacement therapy for
diabetes for at least a proportion of the T1D population. We
caution that additional studies need to be conducted with a larger
number of patient-specific cell lines before clinical use. In
combination
with
a
strategy
to
prevent
autoimmune
destruction33, these cells may provide an alternative to current
approaches in transplantation that have to address the additional
hurdle of allo- or xenogeneic rejection.

mouse fibroblasts (Life Technologies; A1378001). Cell lines were characterized by
karyotype analysis, expression of pluripotency genes and differentiation genes in a
spontaneous differentiation assay. G-banded karyotype analysis was performed by
Cell Line Genetics (Madison, WI). In brief for the other assays, colonies were
stained with antibodies for TRA-1-60 (Millipore; MAB4360), SSEA-3 (Millipore;
MAB4303), SSEA-4 (Millipore; MAB4304), NANOG (Abcam; ab21624) and OCT4
(Abcam; ab19857). Colonies were also stained for alkaline phosphatase (Millipore;

NANOG, OCT4, REX1 and SOX2. Differentiation was assessed by a spontaneous
embryoid body differentiation and assessment of markers for the three germ layers,
using reverse transcriptase–PCR to look for NCAM, PAX6, AFP, GATA4, FLK1

 70 r.p.m. in a humidified 37 �C incubator set at 5% CO2. Undifferentiated cells were
maintained by passaging clusters dispersed with Accutase (StemCell Technologies;
07920) and seeded at 0.5 � 106 cells per ml in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 mM
Y27632 (Abcam; ab120129). Cultures were passaged every 72–96 h (ref. 17).
To initiate differentiation to SC-b cells, clusters were dispersed as above and
seeded between 0.25 and 1 � 106 cells per ml in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 mM
Y27632 to achieve cluster diameters of 150–220 mm after 48–72 h. Differentiation
was initiated by changing the media to differentiation media and following feeding
schedule seen in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. S6 basal media used in stage 6 was
made by supplementing CMRL 1,066 Supplemented (Mediatech; 99-603-CV) with
10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone; 16,777) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. For
this study, we had three batches of differentiation that failed to produce at least
40% PDX1 þ /NKX6-1 þ by the end of stage 4 and were not included in the
analysis. SC-b cell samples were acquired and experiments on SC-b cells were
performed after 10–17 days in Stage 6.
In a subset of experiments, PDX1 þ /NKX6-1 þ pancreatic progenitors and
dysfunctional cells that express C-peptide were generated with a planar
differentiation protocol for initial evaluation of hiPSC differentiation capacity. To
initiate planar differentiation, undifferentiated cells were seeded at 5.3 � 106 cells
per cm2 on plates treated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences;
356,231) in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 mM Y27632 and after 24 h the media
were changed to differentiation media. To generate PDX1 þ /NKX6-1 þ pancreatic
progenitors, the media were changed as seen in Supplementary Table 4. To
generate PH cells, the media were changed as seen in Supplementary Table 5.
Immunohistochemistry. Cell clusters or excised kidneys were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Science; 15,714) for 1 h at room
temperature (RT) or overnight at 4 �C, respectively, before being paraffin
embedded and sectioned at 10 mm. Paraffin was removed with Histoclear (Thermo
Scientific; C78-2-G) and rehydrated, and antigens retrieved by 2 h 0.1 M EDTA
(Ambion; AM9261) treatment in a pressure cooker (Proteogenix; 2,100 Retreiver).
Samples were blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 (VWR; EM-9400) and 5% donkey
serum (Jackson Immunoresearch; 017-000-121) in PBS (staining solution) for 1 h
at RT, incubated with primary antibodies diluted in staining solution overnight at
4 �C, washed for 5 min in staining solution, incubated covered with appropriate
Alexa Fluor-488 or -594 secondary antibodies diluted 1:300 in staining solution 2 h
at RT, washed for 5 min in staining solution, mounted with Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories; H-1200) and covered with a coverslip. Images were taken with an
Olympus IX51 Microscope. The primary antibodies used to assess differentiation
throughout this study are given in Supplementary Table 6 (ref. 17).
Flow cytometry. Clusters were dispersed by treatment with TrypLE Express
(Life Technologies; 12,604,013) at 37 �C, fixed with 30 min treatment with 4% PFA
on ice, blocked by 30 min incubation in staining buffer, stained with primary
antibodies diluted in staining buffer overnight at 4 �C, washed twice with staining
buffer, stained with appropriate AlexaFluor-488 and -647 secondary antibody
diluted 1:300 in staining buffer and washed twice with staining buffer. Stained cells
were measured using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed
using FlowJo17.
Electron microscopy. Cellular ultrastructure was assessed with electron
microscopy17. Clusters were fixed with 1.25% PFA, 2.5 glutaraldehyde and 0.03%
picric acid in pH 7.4, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 2 h at RT, washed in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer, incubated at least 2 h at RT in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5%
potassium ferrocyanide (OsO4/KFeCN6), washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer,
incubated for 1 h in OsO4/KFeCN6, washed thrice with water, stained for 1 h in 1%
aqueous uranyl acetate, washed twice in water and dehydrated with alcohol. After a
1-h incubation in propyleneoxide, samples were infiltrated overnight in 1:1
propyleneoxide and TAAB Epon (Marivac Canada), embedded, sectioned
(60 nm thickness), placed onto copper grids, stained with 0.2% lead citrate and
analysed using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope. Assessment of
ultrastructure was performed by a blinded observer.
In vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In vitro function was assessed by
measuring in vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion17. Clusters were washed
twice in Krebs buffer (krb), preincubated for 2 h in krb containing 2 mM glucose
(low glucose) at 37 �C and washed once. Clusters were then challenged with three
sequential treatments of alternating low-glucose krb and high-glucose krb
containing 20 mM glucose (sx total glucose treatments), followed by treatment with
low-glucose krb containing 30 mM KCl. Each treatment lasted 30 min, after which
100 ml of supernatant was collected and human insulin quantified using the Human
Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics; 80-INSHUU-E01.1. Human
insulin measurements were normalized by viable cell counts that were acquired by
dispersing clusters with TrypLE Expression and counted using a ViCell (Beckman
Coulter). The formulation for krb buffer is seen in Supplementary Table 7. In a
subset of experiments, cells were pre-cultured with an anti-diabetic drug for 24 h in
stage 6 media and that same anti-diabetic drug was also included in the krb buffer:
Tolbutamide (100 mM; Sigma; T0891), LY2608204 (1 mM; Selleck; S2155) and
Liraglutide (1 mM; Bachem; H-6724.0001).
Kidney capsule transplantation. All performed animal work was done in
accordance to Harvard University International Animal Care and Use Committee
regulations. The number of mice chosen was sufficient to statistically show
function previously17. No randomization was used. All procedures were done by
blinded individuals. ND male immunodeficient SCID/Beige mice (Taconic) aged
8–10 weeks were anaesthetized with 250 mg kg � 1 avertin, an incision made to
expose the kidney, a catheter needle inserted underneath the capsule and 5 � 106
cells injected. Cells generated with planar protocols were aggregated overnight to
form clusters before injection. After the incision site was closed, mice were given
5 mg kg � 1 carprofen and another dose 24 h later. Mice were monitored twice a
week after transplantation.
Two weeks after transplantation, the function of transplanted cells was assessed
by performing in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Mice were fasted 16 h
and the blood collected before and 30 min after an intraperitoneal injection of
2 g kg � 1 glucose by facial bleed with a lancet (Feather; 2,017-01). Serum was
separated from blood using microvettes (Sarstedt; 16.443.100) and human insulin
quantified using the Human Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA.
A subset of mice were treated with alloxan to destroy endogenous mouse b-cells
12–16 weeks after transplantation. Alloxan (90 mg kg � 1) was delivered by tail vein
injection21. Loss of endogenous mouse b-cells was confirmed by measuring
serum mouse C-peptide using a Mouse C-peptide ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics;
80-CPTMS-E01). Blood glucose levels was periodically measured for mice fasted
16 h and for mice injected with 2 g kg � 1 glucose.
Global gene expression analysis. Clusters from several independent batches
made from a subset of cell lines were dispersed with TrypLE, fixed in 4% PFA
supplemented with RNasin (VWR; PAN2615) for 30 min on ice, stained with
NKX6-1 and INS primary antibody in RNasin-containing buffer for 30 min on ice
and stained with appropriate Alexa Fluor-488 and -647 secondary antibodies
diluted in RNasin-containing buffer for 30 min on ice. INS þ /NKX6-1 þ cells were
sorted using an FACSAria (BD Biosciences) and RNA extracted by first incubation
sorted cells in digestion buffer (RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit;
Ambion; AM1975) at 50 �C for 3 h then by following the instructions from the
manufacturer. cDNA and cRNA was generated with Illumina TotalPrep RNA
Amplifcation Kit (Life Technologies; AMIL1791). cRNA was hybridized to Human
HT-12 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) with the Whole-Genome Expression
Direct Hybridization kit (Illumina) and chips read with Illumina Beadstation 500.
Data were analysed in GenomeStudio (Illumina) with background subtraction and
rank-invariant normalization. Previous published data for HUES8 SC-b cells,
undifferentiated HUES8, fetal b-cells and adult b-cells was also included in data
analysis17,22. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Pearson’s correlation
and Ward linkage.
Chemically induced stress. Cell clusters were dispersed by TrypLE Express
treatment and plated onto growth factor reduced Matrigel-coated 96-well plates
overnight in S6 media supplemented with 10 mM Alk5i, 1 mM T3 and 10 mM
Y27632. Plated cells were then washed twice with S6 then cultured with S6 media
alone or S6 media with combinations of chemical stressors (Supplementary
Table 8) for up to 48 h. In a subset of experiments, cells were also cultured with
10 mM Alk5i. After chemical treatment, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at
RT, blocked with staining buffer for 30 min at RT, stained with primary antibody
diluted in staining buffer overnight at 4 �C, stained with appropriate Alexa Fluor-
488 and -594 secondary antibody diluted in staining buffer for 2 h at RT and
stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Stained cells were quantified by
automated cell counting using Cellomics ArrayScanVTI, counting at least 1,000
cells per batch.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was determined by the use of
two-sided unpaired and paired t-tests, as appropriate. Data shown as mean±s.e.m.
n indicates the total number of batches (biological replicates) represented by the
data. The box and whisker plot was generated with defaulting statistical settings
with BoxPlorR (http://boxplot.tyerslab.com/).
