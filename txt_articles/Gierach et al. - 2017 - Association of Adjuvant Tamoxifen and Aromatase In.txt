IMPORTANCE Within 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis, roughly 5% of patients develop
contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Randomized trials have found that therapy including
tamoxifen citrate and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reduces CBC risk. But little is known about
the magnitude and duration of protective associations within the context of real-world
clinical management settings, where varying durations of and gaps in treatment are common.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association between adjuvant tamoxifen and AI therapy and
CBC risk within a general community setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study of CBC risk among 7541
patients diagnosed with a first primary unilateral invasive breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente
Institute for Health Research (Colorado) or Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health
Research (Oregon) between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2008. Data were analyzed
from 1 year after diagnosis of the first breast cancer through the earliest of the following
events: CBC diagnosis, other second cancer diagnosis, death, last tumor registry follow-up,
exit from the Kaiser Permanente health care plan, or end of study follow-up (December 31,
2010, for Oregon and December 31, 2011, for Colorado).
EXPOSURES Adjuvant tamoxifen use and AI therapy were treated as time-dependent
exposures, assessed using electronic prescription records.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident CBC based on long-term systematic follow-up.
RESULTS Among 7541 women with invasive breast cancer, median age at initial breast cancer
diagnosis was 60.6 years (age range, 24.9-84.9 years). Women were predominantly (92.9%
[7009 of 7541]) of white race. During a median of 6.3 years (range, 1-20.9 years) of follow-up,
248 women developed CBC (45 in situ and 203 invasive). Contralateral breast cancer risk
decreased significantly with increasing tamoxifen therapy duration. In current users, the
relative risk (RR) per year of tamoxifen use was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64-0.89), with an estimated
66% (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.29-0.40) RR reduction for 4 years of use compared with nonusers.
Risk reductions were slightly smaller for past users but were still significant at least 5 years
after stopping tamoxifen therapy (RR per year of use, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-0.995). In addition,
AI use without tamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced CBC risk (RR for AI users
compared with nonusers, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97). Risk reductions were most apparent
among women whose primary and CBCs were estrogen receptor positive.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Tamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced CBC risk
during treatment and after its cessation, with risk progressively decreasing as tamoxifen
therapy duration increased. Among those surviving at least 5 years, tamoxifen use for at least
4 years was estimated to prevent 3 CBCs per 100 women by 10 years after an estrogen
receptor–positive first breast cancer, an absolute risk reduction that is consistent with
findings from clinical trials. If adjuvant endocrine therapy is indicated for breast cancer
treatment, these findings in concert with trial data suggest that women should be
encouraged to complete the full course.

A
n increasing incidence of estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive breast cancer in the United States in concert
with the aging population and improved survival have
resulted in a greater number of women at risk of developing
second primary contralateral breast cancer (CBC).1 The 10-
year cumulative incidence of CBC is approximately 5%.2 Ran-
domized clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that
tamoxifen citrate therapy reduces risk of primary cancer re-
currence, improves survival, and decreases CBC risk.3,4 An
Early Breast Cancer Trialists’Collaborative Group (EBCTCG)
pooled analysis of 20 trials examining long-term effects of 5
yearsofadjuvanttamoxifentherapyvsnotamoxifenusefound
an absolute reduction in CBC at 15 years of 3.2% among women
whose initial diagnoses were ER positive, while tamoxifen
therapy did not significantly alter the CBC incidence among
womenwithER-negativeprimarytumors.3Amassingtrialdata

Despite strong evidence from trials, little is known about
the magnitude and duration of protective associations within
real-worldtreatmentscenarios,wherevaryingdurationsofand
gaps in treatment are common. Observational studies7-17 have
reported marked reductions in CBC risk with use of tamoxifen
or other unspecified endocrine therapies; however, most

fer according to the ER status of the CBC, and none have re-
ported on the association between AI therapy and CBC risk.
We undertook an investigation of the association of adju-
vant tamoxifen therapy and AI use with CBC risk in a cohort
of women diagnosed as having invasive breast cancer within
the Kaiser Permanente health care plan. This setting offers sev-
eraladvantagesforstudyingtheseassociations,includinglong-
term systematic follow-up of a large number of patients with
breast cancer with electronic prescription records, facilitat-
ing characterization of the persistence of associations of vary-
ing treatment durations, accounting for treatment gaps.
Methods
Study Population and Data Collection
We developed a retrospective cohort of patients (n = 8308)
diagnosed as having a first primary unilateral invasive breast
cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Re-
search (Oregon) (4665 between January 1, 1990, and Decem-
ber 31, 2008) or Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Re-
search (Colorado) (3643 between January 1, 1994, and
December 31, 2008) who survived and remained at CBC risk
for at least 1 year. Data were analyzed from 1 year after diag-
nosis of the first breast cancer through the earliest of the fol-
lowing events: CBC diagnosis, other second cancer diagno-
sis, death, last tumor registry follow-up, exit from the Kaiser
Permanentehealthcareplan,orendofthestudyfollow-up(De-
cember 31, 2010, for Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for
Health Research and December 31, 2011, for Kaiser Perma-
nente Institute for Health Research) (Figure 1). We excluded
342 patients with contralateral breast removal at the initial sur-
gery, 125 patients initially diagnosed as having metastatic dis-
ease, 98 patients not treated with breast surgery, and 202 pa-
tients diagnosed at 85 years or older, resulting in an analytic
cohort of 7541 patients.
This study was approved by the National Cancer Institute

Exposure and Outcome Assessment
Treatment with tamoxifen, AIs, other hormonal agents, che-
motherapeuticagents,andradiotherapywasobtainedfromelec-
tronic Kaiser Permanente prescription and medical records.
Treatment courses were defined separately for tamoxifen and
AIs and consisted of therapy without a gap in prescription cov-
erage of at least 90 days. Women were considered users of ad-
juvant endocrine therapy if they had accumulated at least 90
days of therapy during any one treatment course after the first
primary cancer diagnosis. Because of the recent introduction
of AI therapy in this cohort, we assessed ever use but could not
yetevaluateitsrecencyorduration.Currenttamoxifenusewas
defined as tamoxifen therapy within the past 30 days, whereas
former use was defined as at least 30 days. Time since the last
tamoxifen use was calculated from the end of the last tamoxi-
fencourseduringthefollow-upperiod,and15.4%(601of3900)
of patients treated with tamoxifen had at least 2 courses.
Patient and clinical characteristics, including race, height,
weight (available after 1996 at Kaiser Permanente Northwest
Center for Health Research [Oregon] and after 2000 at Kaiser
Permanente Institute for Health Research [Colorado]), and tu-
morcharacteristics,wereobtainedfromelectronicmedicalrec-
ords. Measured height and weight were used to calculate body
mass index. Second cancer diagnoses and vital status were de-
termined from the Kaiser Permanente Tumor Registry.

relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for CBC risk associated with
Key Points
Question What is the association between adjuvant tamoxifen
citrate and aromatase inhibitor therapy and contralateral breast
cancer (CBC) risk within a general community setting?
Findings In this cohort study of 7541 patients with invasive breast
cancer in a general community health care plan, tamoxifen therapy
was significantly associated with reduced CBC risk during
treatment, and risk decreased as tamoxifen therapy duration
increased. Protective associations persisted at least 5 years after
stopping tamoxifen therapy, and aromatase inhibitor use without
tamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced CBC risk.
Meaning If adjuvant endocrine therapy is indicated for breast
cancer treatment, women should be encouraged to complete the
full course.

ifentherapydurationinyears(continuousvariableforloglinear
trend) and time since the last use (ie, current use and former
use,with<3years,3to<5years,and≥5yearssincethelastuse),
with the reference group defined as those who had never used
tamoxifen or used tamoxifen for less than 90 days. Among for-
mer tamoxifen users, we also assessed risk in relation to cat-
egories of tamoxifen therapy duration of 90 days to less than 1
year, 1 year to less than 4 years, and at least 4 years using cut
points based on the cohort distribution of the cumulative ta-
moxifen exposure. Sensitivity analyses evaluating CBC risk as-
sociated with the first tamoxifen course yielded similar re-
sults. Poisson regression models were stratified by covariates
that we had identified a priori, including study site, age (<40,
40-49, 50-59, 60-69, or ≥70 years) and American Joint Com-
mittee on Cancer stage (I, II, III, or unknown) at diagnosis, ER
statusoftheinitialtumor(positive,negative,orunknownorin-
determinate), time since the initial breast cancer in yearly cat-
egories up to 15 years or more, and, to account for potential co-
hort effects, diagnosis year (1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-
2004,or2005-2008).Wealsoadjustedmodelssimultaneously
for AI use (with or without tamoxifen therapy), chemotherapy
with an alkylating agent, and radiotherapy. Because body mass
index was not associated with tamoxifen therapy duration, it
was not used in the adjustments.
In subgroup analyses, we evaluated associations by the ER
status and age (<50 vs ≥50 years, a proxy for menopausal sta-
tus) at diagnosis of the initial breast cancer. We also examined
risk according to the ER status of the CBC. Among women sur-
vivingatleast5yearsafteradiagnosisofER-positivebreastcan-
cer, we estimated the cumulative incidence of CBC according
to tamoxifen therapy duration (no tamoxifen therapy, tamox-
ifentherapydurationof<4years[themedianduration],andta-
moxifentherapydurationof≥4years),accountingfordeathand
diagnosis of other second cancers as competing risks.18
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All tests of
significance were 2-tailed. Analyses were performed using a
software program (Epicure, version 2.10; HiroSoft Interna-
tional Corporation).19
Results
Patient Characteristics Associated With CBC
and Adjuvant Tamoxifen Therapy
The median age of the cohort at the initial breast cancer diag-
nosis was 60.6 years (age range, 24.9-84.9 years). Women were
predominantly (92.9% [7009 of 7541]) of white race (eTable 1
in the Supplement). During a median of 6.3 years (range,
1.0-20.9 years) of follow-up, 248 women developed CBC (45 in
situ and 203 invasive). Compared with women who did not de-
velop CBC, CBC cases had similar initial breast cancer stage,
grade, histologic findings, and ER status. Almost 70% (5083 of
7541)ofCBCcasesandnoncaseswereprescribedradiotherapy,
andapproximatelyone-third(2527of7541)wereprescribedche-
motherapy with an alkylating agent for the initial treatment.
However, during study follow-up, CBC cases were less likely to
have been treated with endocrine therapy compared with non-
cases (51.2% [127 of 248] vs 65.3% [4762 of 7293]).
Compared with nonusers, tamoxifen users were slightly
more likely to be of white race (94.7% [3695 of 3900] vs 91.0%
[3314 of 3641]) and younger than 50 years at the initial diag-
nosis (22.3% [870 of 3900] vs 18.6% [679 of 3641]) (eTable 2
in the Supplement). Tamoxifen users were more likely to have
initial diagnoses that were stage II, moderately differentiated
grade, and ER positive. In addition, tamoxifen use was less
commonamongwomenwhoseprimarybreastcancerhadbeen
diagnosed more recently.
Associations Between Adjuvant Endocrine
Therapy and CBC Risk
Fifty-two percent (3900 of 7541) of patients used tamoxifen,
with a median duration of use of 3.3 years (range, 0.3-16.2
years). Contralateral breast cancer risk decreased with increas-
ing tamoxifen therapy duration among current and former us-
ers (Figure 2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement).

In current users, the RR per year of tamoxifen use was 0.76
(95% CI, 0.64-0.89) (Table), with an estimated 66% (RR, 0.34;
95% CI, 0.29-0.40) RR reduction for 4 years of use compared

AI use without tamoxifen therapy was associated with re-
duced CBC risk (RR for AI users compared with nonusers, 0.48;

did not have sufficient statistical power to evaluate these risks

Subgroup Analyses by the ER Status
of the Primary and CBCs
Among women whose first cancer was ER positive (n = 5951),
findings were consistent with those of the overall cohort
(Table). Likewise, when considering the ER status of the
subsequent CBC, risk of ER-positive CBC decreased signifi-
cantly with increasing years of tamoxifen therapy duration
among current users (RR per year of use, 0.68; 95% CI,
0.54-0.84) and among former users with less than 5 years
since the last use compared with nonusers (RR per year of
use in those with <3 years since the last use, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.67-0.91 and RR per year of use in those with 3 to <5 years
since the last use, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.98). Among women
whose primary cancer was ER positive, 31 were subse-
quently diagnosed as having ER-negative CBC. Although
based on small numbers, there was little indication that
tamoxifen therapy reduced ER-negative CBC risk when
evaluated using tamoxifen therapy duration or when
tamoxifen users were compared with nonusers (RR, 1.06;
95% CI, 0.41-3.10).
Among women whose first primary cancer was ER nega-
tive (n = 1236), 186 (15.0%) used endocrine therapy, for which
no clear associations were observed. Twenty-five of the CBCs
wereERpositive,and13wereERnegative.Amongpatientswith
a first ER-negative cancer, tamoxifen therapy was not associ-
ated with reduced risk even of ER-positive CBC (RR, 1.97; 95%
CI, 0.50-6.39) (4 diagnosed CBC cases); however, the num-
bers of CBCs diagnosed within treatment groups were small.
Subgroup Analyses by Age at the First
Breast Cancer Diagnosis
In separate analyses by age at the initial diagnosis, findings
among women who were 50 years or older at the initial diag-
nosis (eTable 4 in the Supplement) were similar to those ob-
served in the overall cohort. Among women whose first breast
cancerwasdiagnosedbeforeage50years,riskreductionswere
similar for current and former users with less than 5 years since
the last use but were based on only 53 CBC cases and not sta-
tistically significant.
Cumulative Incidence of CBC
Figure 3 shows the estimated cumulative incidence of CBC ad-
justed for competing risks by tamoxifen use and duration
among 3732 women who survived at least 5 years after a di-
agnosisofER-positivefirstbreastcancer.Ofthesepatients,2517
(67.4%) used tamoxifen, with a median duration of use of 4.2
years (range, 0.3-16.2 years). Patients who did not use tamox-
ifen had a 10-year cumulative incidence of CBC of 4.9% (95%
CI, 3.3%-6.5%), whereas the incidence was lower among those
taking tamoxifen for less than 4 years (3.3%; 95% CI, 2.1%-
4.6%)andwaslowestamongthosetakingtamoxifenforatleast
4 years (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-2.3%). Among those surviving at
least 5 years, tamoxifen use for at least 4 years was estimated
to prevent 3 CBCs per 100 women by 10 years after an ER-
positive first breast cancer. At 15 years after diagnosis, use of
tamoxifen for at least 4 years was estimated to prevent 4 CBCs
per 100 women.
Discussion
This retrospective analysis of more than 7500 US patients with
invasive breast carcinoma treated in a general community
healthcareplansuggeststhatadjuvanttamoxifenandAIthera-
piessignificantlyreduceCBCrisk.Wehavesupplementedclini-
cal trial data by testing associations in an unselected group of
patients using electronic prescription records to accurately
quantify risk reduction in CBC per year of adjuvant tamoxi-
fen use and estimating the persistence of therapeutic effects
in analyses, accounting for gaps in therapy and multiple treat-
ment courses. We found that tamoxifen therapy protects
against CBC when women are undergoing treatment and af-
ter treatment has ceased. Among former users, risk reduction
was most apparent for those receiving tamoxifen for at least
4 years, with protective associations persisting during the first
5 years after stopping tamoxifen therapy. These associations
were stronger among women whose first primary cancer was
ER positive.
Risk reductions in CBC associated with at least 4 years of
tamoxifen use in this observational cohort are consistent with
those found in clinical trials of women randomized to 5 years
of tamoxifen therapy.20,21 Whereas the standard intent-to-
treat analysis in trials only evaluates the prescribed treatment
period, we directly evaluated the cumulative tamoxifen expo-
sure over a wide range of durations (0.3-16.2 years) and ob-
served progressive reductions in CBC risk with increasing du-
ration. A systematic American Society of Clinical Oncology
review concluded that women randomized to receive tamoxi-
fen therapy either indefinitely or for 10 years compared with 5
years had lower CBC risk.22 Less than 5% (377 of 7541) of pa-
tients in our cohort received cumulative tamoxifen therapy of
5 years or longer; however, our findings are still an extension

beyond prior observational cohorts, which only evaluated risk
estimates for tamoxifen therapy lasting at least 1 year.8,9,13
As we have shown, the persistence of protective associa-
tions between adjuvant tamoxifen use and CBC risk likely de-
pends on therapy duration, an issue not sufficiently addressed
in prior observational studies.7-12,14-17 In the Women’
s Environ-
ment, Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) case-
control study,7 significant protective effects of tamoxifen
therapy on CBC risk persisted for 5 years after diagnosis, al-
thoughtherapydurationwasnotdirectlyexamined.Twonested
case-control studies8,9 found that taking tamoxifen for at least
12monthswasassociatedwithdecreasedCBCrisk,buttheper-
sistence of the effect was not reported. Cohort studies10-17 have
demonstrated substantial reductions in CBC risk with tamoxi-
fen or other unspecified endocrine therapies. In the single co-
hort study13 to have evaluated the persistence of effects in
relation to tamoxifen therapy duration, no clear patterns
emerged: that Danish study found that current but not former
adjuvant tamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced CBC
risk. The lack of effect among former users could be due to
shorter tamoxifen therapy duration (median, 1.0-2.5 years) in
that study relative to our US patient population.
In contrast, findings from our observational study are con-
sistent with a 2011 EBCTCG pooled analysis examining long-
term effects of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.3 Similar to the
EBCTCG’
s report of an absolute reduction of 3.2% in CBC at 15
years, we saw absolute CBC reductions of 3.3% at 10 years and
4.0% at 15 years for at least 4 years of tamoxifen therapy vs
no tamoxifen use among ER-positive patients surviving 5 years
or longer. Also consistent with the EBCTCG’
s pooled analysis,
we found that tamoxifen therapy did not appear to lower the
CBC incidence among women with ER-negative primary tu-
mors, although our numbers were too small for precise evalu-
ation. The agreement of our study with the EBCTCG’
s report
regarding the effectiveness of tamoxifen therapy strengthens
theevidenceforalong-lastingreductioninCBCriskbothwithin
and outside of the clinical trial setting.
Just as tamoxifen use has been shown to be most effective
amongwomenwhoseinitialdiagnosisisERpositiveinourstudy
and other studies,9,12,23 tamoxifen therapy was particularly ef-
fectiveinreducingriskofER-positiveCBC.Weandothers12have
also shown that tamoxifen use does not seem to significantly
affect risk of ER-negative CBC; however, these findings con-
flict with those from a prior nested case-control study9 that re-
porteda4.4-foldelevationinriskofER-negativeCBC(52cases)
associated with at least 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.
AlthoughwehadlimitedstatisticalpowertoevaluateriskofER-
negative CBC, the 95% CIs for tamoxifen-associated ER-
negative CBC risk were not consistent with an increased risk of
the magnitude reported previously.
For decades, 5 years of tamoxifen use was the standard
adjuvant therapy for patients with ER-positive tumors.24 More
recently, AIs have represented an alternate therapeutic op-
tion for ER-positive postmenopausal patients.6,25 In the
10-year analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Com-
bination (ATAC) trial,26 women randomized to receive anas-
trozole vs tamoxifen had significantly lower CBC risk. The re-
cent introduction of AI therapy into clinical practice in our
cohort precluded assessments of drug classes and the persis-
tenceofassociationsbetweenvaryingAItherapydurationsand
CBC risk but will be the subject of future investigations.
In the United States, most observational investigations
evaluating the effect of tamoxifen therapy on CBC risk have
been designed as cross-sectional7 or nested8,9 case-control
studies. A major strength of our retrospective cohort study is
that it was conducted within a large, prepaid health care plan
that provided all aspects of care, including cancer treatment
and provision of prescription medications. Furthermore, the
cohort design allowed for absolute risk estimation, which is
essential for clinical decision making.
Despite these advantages, our study had several limita-
tions. Because our study was observational, patients who used
endocrine therapy for long durations may differ in some man-
ner compared with never or short-term users. While we ad-
justed for multiple patient and clinical characteristics, the
possibilityofresidualorunmeasuredconfoundingexists.Ameri-
can Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines22 recommend that
premenopausal or perimenopausal women who have hor-
mone receptor–positive breast cancer should be offered adju-
vant tamoxifen therapy. We could not fully evaluate this issue
because we lacked data on the menopausal status in our co-
hort. Using age younger than 50 years as a proxy, we found that
tamoxifenusewasweaklyassociatedwithreducedCBCriskonly
amongcurrentandformeruserswithlessthan5yearssincethe
lastuse.Currentclinicalguidelinesrecommendthatpostmeno-
pausal women should be offered the choice of continuing ta-
moxifen use or switching to an AI for 10 years of adjuvant en-
docrinetherapy.22Therefore,despitetheolderageofourcohort,
our findings demonstrating significant reductions in CBC risk
withadjuvanttamoxifen(andAI)therapyarestillrelevantwithin
the context of contemporary clinical guidelines.
Earlier reports of reduced CBC risk in adjuvant tamoxifen
trials motivated its evaluation as a preventive agent and drew
attention to the importance of the contralateral breast as a risk
marker.27,28 Therefore, our findings may have implications not
onlyforwomenundergoingadjuvanttherapybutalsoforbreast
cancer prevention. In a 2013 meta-analysis29 of tamoxifen pre-
vention trials, breast cancer incidence was significantly re-
duced within the 5-year active treatment period and the first
5 years after stopping tamoxifen therapy. Our analysis of pa-
tients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen during a 20-year
follow-up period might provide some clues as to the persis-
tence of protection in the chemopreventive setting.
As the decision to elect contralateral prophylactic mastec-
tomy increases in popularity, despite the evidence suggesting
nosurvivalbenefitoverbreastconservation,5,30datafromagen-
eral community setting on the effects of adjuvant endocrine
therapy on CBC risk, as well as on recurrence and death, will be
important. Nonadherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy has
been attributed to multiple factors, including adverse effects
and financial constraints.31-33 Although tamoxifen has been
available in a generic form since 2002, generic AIs were not
available until 2010. Compared with brand-name users, ge-
neric AI users have been shown to have increased adherence.33
Improved adherence to endocrine therapy has also been as-
sociated with patient-centered health care services.31

Conclusions
The present is an opportune time for clinicians to engage in
shared, informed decision making with patients re-
garding the best treatment course for breast cancer. If
adjuvant endocrine therapy is indicated for breast cancer
treatment, our findings in concert with trial data suggest
that women should be encouraged to complete the
full course.

POETRY AND ONCOLOGY
Addressing Spiritual Distress
Danish Zaidi, MTS, MBE
Soon, cancer symptoms began to show:
questions, an unease, a brooding face.
“If He is kind, then I need to know
why I’
m here suffering in this place.”
I jotted down scribbles in my chart:
“Patient presenting with fear of death.”
The truth is I knew not where to start.
How does one answer? I held my breath.
I guess I could have done more in school—
read a bit on faith in times of grief.
Maybe then I would have known the rule
to deal with these issues of belief.
I paged the chaplain, feeling quite odd:
“Attending with questions about God.”
