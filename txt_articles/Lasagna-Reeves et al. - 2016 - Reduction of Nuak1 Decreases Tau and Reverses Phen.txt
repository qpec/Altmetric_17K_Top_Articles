 SUMMARY
Many neurodegenerative proteinopathies share a common pathogenic mechanism: the abnormal 
accumulation of disease-related proteins. As growing evidence indicates that reducing the steady-
state levels of disease-causing proteins mitigates neurodegeneration in animal models, we 
developed a strategy to screen for genes that decrease the levels of tau, whose accumulation 
contributes to the pathology of both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP). Integrating parallel cell-based and Drosophila genetic screens, we discovered that tau levels 
are regulated by Nuak1, an AMPK-related kinase. Nuak1 stabilizes tau by phosphorylation 
specifically at Ser356. Inhibition of Nuak1 in fruit flies suppressed neurodegeneration in tau-
expressing Drosophila, and Nuak1 haploinsufficiency rescued the phenotypes of a tauopathy 
mouse model. These results demonstrate that decreasing total tau levels is a valid strategy for 
mitigating tau-related neurodegeneration and reveal Nuak1 to be a novel therapeutic entry point 
for tauopathies.
INTRODUCTION
In many neurodegenerative conditions, normally soluble proteins accumulate and form 
filamentous insoluble aggregates over time (Chiti and Dobson, 2006). Alzheimer disease 
(AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by extracellular 
deposits of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) made from hyperphosphorylated tau (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). Tau 
undergoes many posttranslational modifications, predisposing it to self-assembly and 
accumulation in NFTs in AD and also in several other neurodegenerative diseases, including 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementia. Mutations in the gene 
which encodes for tau, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), cause familial 
frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), directly 
implicating tau dysfunction in neurodegenerative processes (Clark et al., 1998; Hutton et al., 
1998; Pittman et al., 2006). Furthermore, a copy number variation (CNV) consisting of a 
complete duplication of the MAPT locus has been described in a patient with frontotemporal 
dementia (Rovelet-Lecrux and Campion, 2012). These observations suggest that abnormal 
forms of tau or even elevated levels of wild-type tau are sufficient to cause neuropathology.
Although the molecular mechanism by which tau accumulation causes neuronal dysfunction 
and death is not fully understood, useful clues can be gleaned from studies of other 
neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s 
disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias, all of which share the formation of globular 
insoluble aggregates of mutant or wild-type protein (SOD1, HTT, and ataxins, respectively). 
In each case, the data clearly indicate that decreasing the accumulation of these proteins, 
usually by genetic manipulation, can reverse pathology in animal models for the disease 
(Harper et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2005; Williams and Paulson, 2008; Xia et al., 2004; Zu et 
al., 2004). For instance, studies of conditional tauopathy mouse models exhibit accumulation 
of NFTs in neurons associated with neurodegeneration, and have shown that suppressing 
expression of the conditional mutant tau gene improves memory and halts neuronal loss 
(Santacruz et al., 2005). Moreover, partial reduction of tau during early development in mice 
is well tolerated, increases resistance to chemically induced seizures, and markedly

 diminishes Aβ-driven neuronal and cognitive impairment in vivo (Morris et al., 2011; 
Roberson et al., 2007; Small and Duff, 2008). Therefore, we hypothesized that decreasing 
tau levels might be a feasible therapeutic approach for tauopathies, as we have pursued for 
other proteinopathies (Park et al., 2013). Consequently, we set out to identify druggable 
targets that modulate tau levels.
To take advantage of the unbiased, functional nature of genetic screens (Westbrook et al., 
2008) and compensate for the weaknesses inherent in any given model system, we utilized a 
genetic approach that we previously developed to successfully modulate the levels of 
glutamine-expanded ATXN1, which causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) (Park et 
al., 2013). We used a cross-species strategy: complementary forward genetic screens that 
targeted the levels of human tau in a tauopathy Drosophila model and in a human cell line 
that stably expresses tau. Because phosphorylation is important for tau accumulation and 
aggregation (Wang and Mandelkow, 2016), and because kinases are readily targeted with 
pharmacological agents (Noble et al., 2004), we chose to screen the human kinome. Our 
screen identified a previously unknown kinase that regulates tau levels by phosphorylating a 
site not previously known to affect protein levels. Additional studies in a mouse model 
demonstrate that reducing tau levels safely reverses tau-induced phenotypes and pathology.
RESULTS
Nuak1 influences steady-state levels of tau protein
To identify regulators of tau levels in human cells, we engineered a human-
medulloblastoma-derived cell line with a transgene encoding human tau fused with 
monomeric green fluorescent protein (tau-GFP). To distinguish modifiers that regulate tau 
protein levels from those that regulate transgene transcription, we placed the gene encoding 
DsRed upstream of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) driving independent translation 
of tau-GFP fusion protein (DsRed-IRES-tau-GFP). The DsRed to GFP fluorescence ratio by 
flow cytometry analysis serves as a proxy for tau-GFP protein levels while controlling for 
fluctuations in transcription of the transgene (Figure S1A).
We used our cell system to test the effects of individual short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 
targeting every known human kinase and kinase-like gene (1,908 siRNAs, 636 genes; test 
performed in triplicates) on tau levels (Figure S1B). In parallel, we performed a genetic 
screen in a tauopathy Drosophila model expressing four-repeat wild-type human tau, in 
which fruit flies develop an external eye (ommatidial) phenotype in response to tau toxicity 
(Figure S1C). We screened a total of 704 inducible RNAi alleles targeting the Drosophila 
kinome (337 genes) for those that would modulate degeneration induced by human wild-
type tau, using the readily observable ommatidial phenotype as a reliable read-out.
The cell-based screen revealed 44 human modifier genes that reduced tau levels and the 
Drosophila screen uncovered 88 genes that ameliorated tau-induced degeneration. We 
identified 16 modifiers common to both screens (Figure 1A and Figure S1D) and subjected 
them to a number of additional criteria before pursuing further validation (Figure S1E). One 
hit that satisfied all our conditions was Nuak1: Nuak1 down-regulation decreases tau levels 
in the human cell line not only in the GFP/DsRed ratio by flow cytometry but also by

 western blot analysis (Figure 1B), and knocking down the Drosophila Nuak1 homolog also 
resulted in a decrease of tau levels consistent with the observed suppression of eye 
degeneration (Figure 1C and D, Figure S2A). These results indicate that partial inhibition of 
Nuak1 is sufficient to reduce aberrant tau levels.
We therefore sought to validate the Nuak1 effect using a functional behavioral read-out in 
the nervous system. Neuronal-specific expression of human wild-type tau in the Drosophila 
impairs motor performance in a way that can be easily quantified using a climbing assay. We 
found that knockdown of the Drosophila homolog of Nuak1 suppressed these human tau-
induced motor deficits (Figure 1E and Video S1). We next tested the effect of an increase in 
Nuak1 levels, and found Nuak1-overexpressing tau flies showed a substantial worsening of 
the motor deficit. No motor abnormalities were observed in wild-type flies when Nuak1 was 
over expressed, demonstrating that under these conditions Nuak1 does not induce toxicity by 
itself but only augments tau toxicity (Figure S2B).
We next tested the effect of Nuak1 deletion in mice. Since Nuak1+/− mice are viable and 
fertile (Figure S2C–S2D), we were able to analyze the brains of 3-month-old animals. 
Western blot analysis revealed that a 50% reduction in Nuak1 was sufficient to decrease tau 
levels in the brain (Figure 1F–H). In parallel we compared the levels of tau-encoding mRNA 
in the Nuak1+/− and wild-type mice. No differences between genotypes were observed, 
confirming that Nuak1 affects tau levels post-translationally (Figure S2E).
Nuak1 is associated with tau accumulation in human tauopathy post-mortem brain tissue
To determine if Nuak1 is associated with tau in the context of human tauopathies, we 
biochemically and pathologically characterized Nuak1 in post-mortem brains from 
Alzheimer cases and age-matched controls (Table S1). We analyzed the RIPA soluble 
fraction and observed an increase in the levels of Nuak1 in comparison with controls (Figure 
2A). When we analyzed the insoluble fraction, which was enriched with tau fibrillar 
material, we detected the presence of Nuak1 only in the AD cases (Figure 2B). This result 
strongly suggests Nuak1 is associated with highly insoluble tau aggregates. To confirm this, 
we performed double immunofluorescence (IF) in AD brain sections and age-matched 
controls using an anti-tau antibody and an anti-Nuak1 antibody. Fluorescence images of AD 
brain sections show that Nuak1 co-localizes with tau NFTs (Figure 2C, top panel) as well as 
with tau neuropil threads (Figure 2C, bottom panel) while age-matched controls show that 
Nuak1 is normally located in the cytoplasm and within the nucleus (Figure S3A), as 
previously reported (Sun et al., 2013). This result supports the notion that Nuak1 is 
associated with pathological tau accumulation in Alzheimer disease.
To establish whether this association between Nuak1 and tau occurs only in the context of 
AD or also exists in other types of tauopathies, we performed similar evaluation in post-
mortem brain tissue from PSP patients. Biochemical analysis of brain soluble fractions in 
PSP cases (Table S1) showed an increase in the levels of Nuak1 in comparison with age-
matched controls (Figure 2D). When the insoluble fractions were analyzed, Nuak1 was 
detected only in PSP cases but not in controls (Figure 2E), suggesting that Nuak1 is also 
associated with tau aggregates in the context of PSP. Double IF on PSP brain sections 
demonstrated that Nuak1 co-localized with globose type-NFTs, which is a pathological

 hallmark of PSP (Figure 2F). Double IF on age-matched controls for this set of cases once 
again reveal that Nuak1 is located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in normal physiological 
conditions (Figure S3B). Nuak1 is thus strongly associated with tau in a human disease 
context.
Finally, to determine if the increase of Nuak1 levels is due to an increase in the expression of 
Nuak1 versus the stability or activity of the protein, we measured the levels of Nuak1-
encoding mRNA in AD cases, PSP cases and the respective age-matched controls. The qRT-
PCR analysis shows a decrease in the levels of Nuak1-encoding mRNA in AD as opposed to 
age-matched controls and no differences between PSP cases and its age-matched controls 
(Figure S3C–S3D). These results indicate that the increase in Nuak1 protein levels is due to 
an increase in protein stability or activity rather than transcription. In addition, the decrease 
in Nuak1-encoding mRNA in AD cases suggests a compensatory mechanism at late stages 
of the disease. In parallel, we analyzed available RNA seq data from AD and PSP patients. 
RNA seq data generated by the Mayo Brain Gene Expression (MayoEGWAS and Mayo 
Pilot studies) (Zou et al., 2012) revealed that Nuak1-encoding mRNA does not statistically 
change in AD and PSP cases in comparison with control cases (Figure S3E), which supports 
the conclusion that Nuak1 levels are likely increased due to protein stability.
Nuak1 regulates tau levels by phosphorylating Ser356
To determine whether Nuak1 directly regulates tau via phosphorylation, recombinant wild-
type Nuak1 and tau were evaluated in an in vitro kinase assay. Notably, Nuak1 directly 
phosphorylates tau (Figure 3A), while mutant Nuak1 lacking kinase activity failed to 
phosphorylate tau (Figure 3A). As a positive control we performed the kinase assay with 
Nuak1 and Caspase-6, a known Nuak1 substrate (Suzuki et al., 2004). To identify the sites 
phosphorylated by Nuak1, we repeated the in vitro kinase assay followed by mass 
spectrometry. The LC-MS/MS data revealed Nuak1 directly phosphorylates tau at Serine356 
(the amino acid number is based on the longest isoform (isoform 2, amino acids 1–441) 
(Figure 3B). Nuak1 did not phosphorylate tau at Thr212, Thr231 Ser214, Ser262 or Ser396, 
which are known sites for phosphorylation by other AMPK-related kinases (Mairet-Coello 
et al., 2013; Vingtdeux et al., 2011; Yoshida and Goedert, 2012) (data not shown).
To determine whether Nuak1 phosphorylates tau in living cells, we transfected a 
neuroblastoma cell line with either wild-type Nuak1 or the kinase-dead Nuak1 mutant 
K84M (Suzuki et al., 2006). Nuak1 overexpression led to a 30% increase in tau levels 
(Figure 3C and D), and a >50% increase in the levels of tau phosphorylated at Ser356 
(Figure 3C and E), but no changes in the levels of Ser262 phosphorylated tau (Figure 3C). 
Overexpression of the K84M mutant had no effect on tau levels (Figure 3C and D). 
Decreasing endogenous levels of Nuak1 from neuroblastoma cells induced a significant 
decrease in the levels of phospho-Ser356 tau (Figure S4A–S4D), confirming the 
physiological effect of Nuak1 on tau phosphorylation. Because tau phosphorylation at 
Ser262/Ser356 contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation at AD-related SP/ST sites (Ando et 
al., 2016; Nishimura et al., 2004), we also tested whether tau phosphorylation at Ser356 by 
Nuak1 initiates a cascade of hyperphosphorylation. Indeed, we found Nuak1 overexpression 
increases the levels of tau phosphorylated at Thr231 and Ser396/Ser404 (Figure S4E–S4G)

 To confirm that the effect of Nuak1 on tau levels was dependent on Ser356 phosphorylation, 
we co-expressed Nuak1 with wild-type tau or mutant S356A tau. Western blot analysis 
showed Nuak1 has a strong effect on wild-type tau levels but no effect over the levels of 
mutant S356A tau (Figure 3F and G). To determine if Nuak1 alters tau levels through 
stabilization of tau by phosphorylation at Ser356, we generated doxycycline-inducible cell 
lines expressing wild type tau or mutant S356A tau. Our protein stability measurements 
demonstrated that wild type tau has a higher half-life than the mutant S356A tau. 
Furthermore, over-expression of Nuak1 increases wild type tau half-life but does not have 
any effect over mutant S356A tau stability (Figure S5A–S5B). It has been previously 
reported that the carboxy terminus of the Hsp70-interacting protein CHIP binds and 
ubiquitinates tau within the microtubule-binding domain, which promotes tau proteasomal 
degradation (Dickey et al., 2007; Petrucelli et al., 2004). Whenever tau is phosphorylated at 
Ser262/Ser356, however, CHIP is unable to bind or ubiquitinate tau, and tau is thereby 
hindered from undergoing proteasomal degradation (Dickey et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 
2008). Therefore, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay to test if a similar mechanism 
occurs when tau is phosphorylated at Ser356 by Nuak1. Indeed, CHIP binding and 
ubiquitination of tau are interrupted by the effects of Nuak1 on tau (Figure S5C).
Having established the role of Nuak1 in phosphorylating tau at Ser356 using molecular and 
genetic approaches, we evaluated the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of Nuak1. Cells 
treated with the Nuak1 inhibitor WZ4003 (Banerjee et al., 2014) showed decreased levels of 
total and phospho Ser356 tau (Figure 3H–J), confirming that Nuak1’s effect on tau levels is 
conferred by its kinase activity. Together with the genetic data, these results strongly support 
the hypothesis that Nuak1 regulates tau levels. These findings also validate the genetic 
screen strategy and provide evidence that tau levels can be modulated pharmacologically.
Reducing Nuak1 rescues the phenotypes in a tauopathy mouse model
To determine if the decrease in tau levels observed in Nuak1+/− mice was functionally 
penetrant in a disease model, we bred Nuak1+/− mice to tau P301S transgenic mice, which 
bear human tau with the P301S mutation and recapitulate many features of human 
tauopathies (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). The offspring were aged and evaluated using 
comprehensive behavioral and pathological evaluation.
To test the effect of deleting one Nuak1 allele on memory, 7.5-month-old progeny were 
assayed in the Morris water maze. During the training phase, the latency to find the platform 
was somewhat increased in the P301S mice in comparison with wild-type, Nuak1+/−, and 
P301S/Nuak1+/− mice, although this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 4A). 
In the probe trial, a 50% reduction of Nuak1 in P301S mice improved memory retention, as 
shown by the higher percentage of time that the P301S/Nuak1+/− spent in the target quadrant 
in comparison with P301S mice (Figure 4B). Because all the mice performed equally well 
during the visible platform trial (Figure S6A), it was clear that all four genotypes have the 
ability to see and to swim efficiently. In addition, all four groups displayed comparable swim 
speeds (Figure S6B), so the decrease in time that the P301S mice spent in the target quadrant 
during the probe trial was due to their poorer ability to use and remember spatial cues.

 Next, we performed contextual and cued fear conditioning tests, which are largely dependent 
on the hippocampus and amygdala, respectively (Takeuchi et al., 2011). Interestingly, the 
P301S mice exhibited a significantly lower percentage of freezing compared to wild-type 
and Nuak1+/− mice during the contextual fear assay (Figure 4C). The P301S/Nuak1+/− mice 
showed better memory in the contextual fear test than the P301S mice (Figure 4C). No 
differences were observed between any groups on the cued fear test (Figure 4D). Therefore, 
decreasing the levels of Nuak1 by 50% reverses the spatial learning deficit in P301S mice.
After the behavioral studies, mice were sacrificed and brains were collected for biochemical 
and immunohistochemical analyses. Western blot was used to investigate whether reducing 
the levels of Nuak1 also decreased total and phosphorylated human mutant tau in P301S 
mice. Indeed, P301S/Nuak1+/− mice presented lower levels of human phosphorylated tau at 
Ser356 than P301S mice (Figure 5A and B). The P301S/Nuak1+/− mice also showed lower 
levels of endogenous murine phospho Ser356 tau than the P301S mice (Figure 5A and C). 
Remarkably, this phospho form of tau was almost absent in the Nuak1+/− mice (Figure 5A 
and C). When we measured total levels of tau using the tau-5 antibody, P301S/Nuak1+/− 
mice presented lower levels of total human tau than P301S mice (Figure 5A and D). When 
we analyzed the levels of total endogenous mouse tau, we observed that only the Nuak1+/− 
mice showed a decrease in total mouse tau levels in comparison with the other three groups 
(Figure 5A and E). Considering that tau phosphorylation at Ser262/Ser356 is required to 
initiate the pathogenic cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation (Ando et al., 2016; Nishimura et 
al., 2004), we measured the levels of tau phosphorylated at the disease-associated residue 
Thr231 and Ser396/Ser404. Western blot analysis revealed that P301S/Nuak1+/− mice 
presented lower levels of phosphorylated tau at Thr231 and Ser396/Ser404 than P301S mice 
(Figures S6C–S6D). To assess the degree of tau phosphorylation due to changes in total tau 
levels, we measured the levels of phospho Ser356, phospho Thr231 and phospho Ser396/
Ser404 relative to those of total tau. The relative ratio of phospho Ser356 to total tau was 
significantly decreased in P301S/Nuak1+/− mice in comparison with P301S mice (Figure 
S6E). No differences were observed between groups when the relative ratios of phospho 
Thr231 and phospho Ser396/Ser404 to total tau were measured (Figures S6F–S6G). These 
results confirm that the effect of Nuak1 over tau levels is mainly due to tau phosphorylation 
at Ser356 by Nuak1.
For immunohistochemical analysis we stained brain sections from P301S and P301S/
Nuak1+/− mice with the PHF1 antibody, which recognizes pathological-associated tau 
phosphorylated at epitopes Serine 396 and Serine 404 (Otvos et al., 1994). We found that 
eliminating one copy of mouse Nuak1 reduced the number of PHF1-positive neurons in the 
hippocampus and cortex of P301S mice (Figure 5F–H). This result demonstrated that a 
minor decrease in tau levels at early stages has a pervasive effect on the amount of 
pathological PHF1-positive NFTs.
Finally, in a second cohort, we measured long-term synaptic plasticity of freely moving 
mice. Long-term synaptic plasticity (e.g., long-term potentiation, LTP) serves as a neural 
substrate for learning and memory (Malenka and Bear, 2004; Whitlock et al., 2006). We 
investigated LTP over several days in freely moving WT, P301S, Nuak1+/− and P301S/
Nuak1+/− mice (Figure 6A and B). Before and after LTP induction, evoked responses were

 monitored in the perforant path recorded in the dentate gyrus. Following two days of 
baseline recording, tetanic stimulation of the perforant path induced significant potentiation 
of the population spike for multiple days in all groups (day 0, P < 0.001 versus baselines, 
respectively). Human P301S tau expression severely impaired hippocampal LTP over time in 
P301S mice 1 h after induction in comparison with the WT and Nuak1+/−, but a 50% 
decrease in Nuak1 expression completely rescued the impairment of synaptic plasticity in 
P301S/Nuak1+/− mice. We observed no difference in LTP between P301S/Nuak1+/− mice 
and WT or Nuak1+/− controls.
DISCUSSION
The data reported here show that Nuak1, an AMPK-related kinase, modulates tau levels in 
human cells, Drosophila, and mouse model systems. This kinase was highly associated with 
tau accumulation in two different tauopathies, AD and PSP, which strongly suggests that 
Nuak1 has a role in tau accumulation in a disease context, making this kinase a valuable 
target for further validation. We also demonstrated that hippocampal LTP is severely 
impaired in freely moving P301S mice and that decreasing Nuak1 levels or activity reverses 
several deficits in a tauopathy mouse model.
Previous studies reported that MARK2 phosphorylated tau at Ser262/Ser356 and AMPK 
directly phosphorylated tau at Ser262 but not at Ser356, demonstrating the important role 
this family of kinases plays in tau physiological functions (Dickey et al., 2007; Mairet-
Coello et al., 2013). To our knowledge Nuak1 is the first kinase to be identified that 
exclusively phosphorylates tau at Ser356 but not at Ser262. More importantly, we show that 
such phosphorylation directly affects tau levels.
Nuak1 directly phosphorylates tau at Ser356, which is located in the microtubule-binding 
domain (Buee et al., 2000). Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 and Ser356, both within the 
microtubule-binding domain, causes tau to be released from the microtubules, which in turn 
leads to microtubule destabilization (Biernat and Mandelkow, 1999). These are 
physiological phosphorylations that are able to regulate microtubule dynamics, which is 
important for axonal growth and other processes that require neuronal plasticity (Biernat and 
Mandelkow, 1999). Although phosphorylation at Ser356 plays a necessary role in the 
regulation of normal tau function, previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation 
at this site is required to initiate the pathogenic cascade of hyperphosphorylation on 
additional sites by other kinases associated with tau aggregation and formation of NFTs 
(Nishimura et al., 2004). This last observation holds true in the context of Nuak1, where we 
showed how tau phosphorylation at Ser356 by Nuak1 primes tau for the subsequent 
phosphorylation at other pathological sites. Taking into consideration that Nuak1 decreases 
tau ubiquitination and its binding to CHIP, which are essential for tau proteosomal 
degradation (Dickey et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 2008), and that Nuak1 is highly associated 
with tau pathology in human tauopathies; it is possible that direct phosphorylation of tau at 
Ser356 by Nuak1 triggers a cascade of events that promote or inhibit several post-
translational modifications key to increasing tau stability, promoting its accumulation, 
aggregation and formation of NFTs. This common mechanism for tau pathogenesis may 
have certain differences according to the nature of each tauopathy. For instance in AD, Aβ

 amyloid plays an important role in the activation of different kinases which subsequently 
phosphorylate tau (Ma et al., 2009; Takashima et al., 1998; Zempel et al., 2010). 
Alternatively in PSP, which is solely characterized by presence of tau pathology, the 
accumulation or activation of Nuak1 and other kinases could be triggered by a different 
mechanism. This point could explain the variability of Nuak1 levels between AD and PSP 
cases and even within cases of the same disease.
Our in vivo genetic interaction study demonstrated that reduction of Nuak1 by 50% was 
sufficient to decrease total tau levels and reverse the deficits in a tauopathy mouse model. 
This result is rather remarkable, considering that human tau is expressed in the P301S mouse 
model at five times the levels of endogenous mouse tau (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). It is thus 
possible that even a modest (less than 50%) reduction of Nuak1 could exert a strong effect 
on endogenous tau levels
Previous efforts in the tauopathy field have aimed to develop screening strategies for the 
discovery of therapeutic targets focused on tau aggregation or pathological hyper-
phosphorylation (Cavallini et al., 2013; Pickhardt et al., 2005). Our study focused on a much 
earlier stage in disease pathogenesis, the point at which tau levels begin to increase beyond 
the neuron’s ability to degrade the protein. This strategy allowed us to identify Nuak1, a 
kinase that phosphorylates tau at a physiological site such as Ser356. This site represents 
only a minor fraction of total phospho-sites, but still acts as a key trigger for tau 
accumulation and aggregation (Biernat and Mandelkow, 1999; Biernat et al., 2002; 
Nishimura et al., 2004). The fact that a small reduction in tau levels was sufficient to have 
prominent effects on multiple disease-like phenotypes substantiates screening for modifiers 
of tau levels as a strategy to subdue disease or even prevent its development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generation of stable cell lines
DsRed-IRES-tau:EGFP cell line was generated as previously described (Park et al., 2013). 
Briefly, the construct was cloned into a pHAGE vector. Lentiviral packaged clones were 
infected into Daoy cells and then selected with puromycin and ran through Aria II (BD 
Biosciences) for selection of cells that show expression of DsRed and GFP.
Cell-based kinase siRNA screen
Daoy DsRed-IRES-tau:EGFP cells were split into 96-well plates. On the next day, each 
siRNA (kinase siRNA library from Invitrogen) was transfected at 20 nM with 0.08 μl of 
transfection reagent (Dharmacon) into corresponding wells and incubated for 72 h. Before 
running FACS analysis (LSR II, BD Biosciences), the cells were trypsinized and suspended 
in PBS with 5% FBS.
Drosophila kinase screen
For the screen we used a transgenic line that expresses a four-repeat wild type isoform of 
human tau under the control of a GMR-Gal4 driver. We obtained homologs for all human 
kinases in Drosophila from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC). All crosses for the

 screen were done at 28°C for external eye phenotype and at 26.5°C for analysis of the retina. 
Flies were processed for scanning electron microscopy and paraffin sections of the retina as 
previously described (Park et al., 2013). Additional lines were obtained from Bloomington 
Stock center (Indiana).
Cell culture, over-expression, siRNA transfections and inhibitor treatment
Daoy stable cell lines and 2C neuroblastoma cell lines were cultured in DMEM or 
F12/MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) respectively. siRNAs (Invitrogen) were 
transfected with DharmaFECT (Dharmacon) and incubated for 3 days before analysis. 
Human wild-type Nuak1 and kinase dead Nuak1 (K84M) were cloned into a 3xflag-CMV 
plasmid (Sigma-aldrich). GFP-fused human tau (gift of K. Ashe, Addgene plasmid no. 
46904) was utilized to generated mutant tau S356A (QuikChange XL Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis Kit). All plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 
incubated for 48 hours. 2C cells were treated with Nuak1 inhibitor (WZ4003, abcam) for 24 
hours.
Cell lysate preparation and immunoblot analysis
Before collection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice for 20 min in RIPA buffer 
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% 
NP-40 and 5mM EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche). The cell lysates 
were then centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were analyzed 
by western blot. Primary antibodies used: anti-tau (tau-5, 1:1000, abcam, 
RRID:AB_304171), anti-pSer356 tau (1:750, abcam, RRID:AB_10586459),), anti-pSer262 
tau (1:750, abcam, RRID:AB_2139717), Anti-Nuak1 (1:800, abcam, RRID:AB_1267723) 
and Anti vinculin (1:10000, Sigma-aldrich, RRID:AB_477629).
Human and mouse brain samples preparation and immunoblot analysis
Postmortem brain tissues from subjects with AD, PSP and control subjects were provided in 
the form of frozen blocks by the Brain Resource Center at Johns Hopkins. AD cases 
consisted of pathologically severe AD, stage V–VI. Each brain was homogenized in RIPA 
buffer with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and a dilution of brain:RIPA of 1:10 (w/v). 
Samples were then centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants were 
portioned into aliquots, snap-frozen, and stored at −80°C until analyzed. The RIPA insoluble 
pellet was treated with formic acid by mixing samples with 88% formic acid for 1 hour at 
room temperature (The volume of 88% FA was ¼ of the volume used for RIPA). Samples 
were then diluted with distilled water to obtain the same volume used in RIPA. Samples 
were then lyophilized for 24 hours. Freeze-dried samples were reconstituted in PBS using 
the same volume that was originally used for RIPA. Samples were then sonicated for 30 
seconds. Finally, samples were mixed with running buffer, run on a gel, and analyzed by 
Western blot. Primary antibodies used: anti-Nuak1 (1:800), PHF1 (1:500, gift from Peter 
Davies, RRID:AB_2315150) and anti-vinculin (1:10000), tau-5 (1:1000) and anti-pSer356 
tau (1:750).

 Brain sections immunofluorescence (IF)
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in 0.01 M PBS 1X 3 times for 
5 min each time. After blocking in normal goat serum for 1 hr, sections were incubated 
overnight with tau-5 antibody (1:100) and anti-Nuak1 antibody (1:100). The next day, the 
sections were washed in PBS 1X 3 times for 10 min each time and then incubated with goat 
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1: 700; Invitrogen, RRID:AB_2534069) and goat anti-rabbit 
Alexa Fluor 568 (1:700; Invitrogen, RRID:AB_2534094) for 1 hr. Sections were washed and 
mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, 
RRID:AB_2336790). The sections were examined using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal 
microscope.
Mouse models
All procedures for mouse animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee for Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliates. The PS19 mouse model, 
which over expresses human tau with the P301S mutation, was directly purchased from 
Jackson laboratories (Stock No:008169, RRID:IMSR_JAX:024841). Nuak1 heterozygous 
embryos were provided by the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan 
(RRID:MGI:3771062). The Transgenic Mouse Core Rederivation at Baylor College of 
Medicine performed embryo pre-implantation.
Morris water maze (MWM)
Morris water maze was performed as previously described (Takeuchi et al., 2011). A circular 
pool (120 cm in diameter) was filled with water (21±1 °C), in which non-toxic white 
tempera paint was mixed to make the surface opaque. For the invisible platform test, a white 
colored platform was placed at the center in one of four quadrants of the pool (southwest 
area) and submerged 1 cm below the water surface so that it was invisible at water level. The 
location of the platform was fixed at the same quadrant while the start position of swimming 
was varied. Mice were given 4 trials per day for 5 consecutive days, during which they were 
allowed to find the platform within 60 seconds. Each trial was separated by an inter-trial 
interval of 1–2 min, which was adopted through all the tests. Once the mouse located the 
platform, it was permitted to stay on it for 10 seconds. If the mouse did not find the platform 
within 60 seconds, it was guided to the platform and placed on it for 20 seconds. To evaluate 
the spatial reference memory, all mice were given a probe trial 24 hours after the last trial of 
the invisible training test which consisted of removing the platform from the pool and 
allowing the mice to swim for 60 sec in its search. A record was kept of the swimming time 
(sec) in the pool quadrant where the platform had previously been placed. During the visible 
platform test, a colored platform was placed in the quadrant 1 cm above the surface of the 
water, and its location was always varied randomly in each trial. All mice were subjected to 
8 blocks with 4 trials per block during 1 day. Swim speed (cm/sec), latency time to find the 
platform (sec), and the time that each mouse swam in the target quadrant were recorded by 
video camera and analyzed by a computer-controlled video tracking system (Ethovision XT, 
by Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA).

 Fear conditioning
Fear conditioning was performed as previously described (Takeuchi et al., 2011). Each 
mouse was placed in a sound-attenuated chamber and allowed to explore freely for 2 min. 
An 80-dB white noise, the conditioned stimulus (CS), was presented for 30 sec followed by 
a mild (2 sec, 0.72 mA) foot shock, the unconditioned stimulus (US). Two more CS–US 
pairings were presented with 2-min interstimulus intervals. Context testing was conducted 1 
day after conditioning in the same chamber. Cued testing with altered context was conducted 
on the same day, following the context testing, using a triangular box made of white opaque 
Plexiglas, which was located in a different room. Data acquisition, control of stimuli (i.e., 
tones and shocks), and data analysis were performed automatically using Coulbourn/
Actimetrics FreezeFrame3 System.
Surgery and electrophysiology
Induction and recording of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vivo were conducted as 
previously published with a few modifications (Davis et al., 1997; Hao et al., 2015; Tang and 
Dani, 2009). Mice were secured on a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf) with 1–2% isoflurane 
as anesthesia. Under aseptic conditions, the recording electrode (Teflon-coated tungsten 
wire, bare diameter 50 μm, A-M Systems) was surgically aimed at the dentate gyrus (1.8 – 
2.0 mm posterior, 1.4 – 1.6 mm lateral of bregma, 2.2 – 2.3 mm below the skull) while a 
concentric stimulating electrode (same sort of tungsten wire as for recordings) was 
implanted ipsilaterally in the medial perforant path (0.2 mm posterior and 2.8–3.0 mm 
lateral of lambda, 1.0–1.3 mm below the dura) (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001). Evoked 
potentials of the performant path recorded in the dentate were used to guide the final 
positions of both electrodes. Dental cement was used to anchor the electrode assembly that 
was connected to a unity gain preamplifier, and the connecting device for chronic 
recordings. After at least two weeks of recovery from surgical implantation, mice were 
transported and habituated to the recording system during each of the 4 days prior to starting 
the LTP test. Signals were amplified (100x), filtered (bandpass, 0.1–5 kHz), digitized at 10 
kHz, and stored on disk for off-line analysis (pClamp10 and 1440A; Molecular Devices). 
The time course of LTP tests is across 7 days (day -1 to day 5). Test responses elicited by 
monophasic pulses (0.1 ms duration) were recorded for 20-min periods on consecutive days 
at an intensity that evoked 40% of the maximal population spike. Following two days of 
stable baseline, a tetanus was delivered to the perforant path for LTP induction. Pulse width 
was doubled during tetani, which consisted of 6 series of 6 trains of 6 stimuli at 400 Hz, 200 
ms between trains, 20 s between series. Responses were measured for 60 min after tetanus 
and again, for 20 min at 24 h, 48 h, and 120 h after tetanus. Since the latency of the 
population spike usually decreases following LTP induction, it is impractical to compare the 
initial slope of the fEPSP (field excitatory postsynaptic potential) before and after LTP 
induction in awake animals (Jones et al., 2001; Malleret et al., 2001). Accordingly, we 
quantified the amplitude of the population spikes (Hao et al., 2015; Tang and Dani, 2009). 
Data were averaged every 5 min and normalized to the baseline measured over the 10 min 
before tetanic stimulation and presented as mean ± standard error of mean. Two-way 
repeated measures ANOVA (between groups) or one-way ANOVA (within group) followed 
by Tukey posthoc were used for data analysis.

 Statistical analyses
Experimental analysis and data collection were performed in a blinded fashion. P values 
were determined using the appropriate statistical method via GraphPad Prism, as described 
throughout the manuscript. For simple comparisons, Student’s T-Test was used. For multiple 
comparisons, ANOVA followed by the appropriate post hoc analysis were utilized. Data is 
presented as mean ± s.d.m. *, ** and *** denote P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, 
respectively. To identify the primary screen hits, we calculated the whole-screen mean and 
selected the siRNAs that decreased the DsRed-IRES-tau:EGFP ratio below 2 standard 
deviations. For the confirmation screen, we performed three independent experimental sets 
and compared the effect of siRNAs within each set to the internal siRNA controls by 
analysis of variance followed by Dunnet’s and Tukey’s post-hoc tests to select for the 
siRNAs that were significantly decreased.

 Figure 6. Nuak1 down-regulation restores hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus 
of freely moving mice
A), Superimposed traces of the perforant path recorded in the dentate gyrus 5 min before 
(dotted lines) and 55 min after (dark gray, gray, blue, or purple) LTP induction. B), 
Summary of in vivo LTP in WT (n = 7), P301S (n = 8), Nuak1+/− (n = 9) and P301S/
Nuak1+/− mice (n = 7). LTP induction potentiated the population spikes in all the groups 
(one-way ANOVA on day 0: p < 0.001 for all groups). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA 
revealed significant main effects of population spike amplitudes among the four groups on 
day 0 (p = 0.01), day 1 (p < 0.05), day 2 (p < 0.05), and day 5 (p < 0.05). Tukey posthoc 
indicate LTP was impaired in P301S mice compared to WT or Nuak1+/− controls (day 0, P = 
0.001; day 1, P = 0.015; day 2, P = 0.009; a trend on day 5, P = 0.058). Nuak1 rescued the 
LTP impairment in P301S/Nuak1+/− mice compared to P301S mice (day 0, P = 0.004; day 1, 
P = 0.024; day 2, P = 0.024). There was no difference of LTP between P301S/Nuak1+/− mice 
and WT or Nuak1+/− controls (P > 0.05 for all the tested days). Arrow, LTP induction. Data 
are mean ± s.e.m.
