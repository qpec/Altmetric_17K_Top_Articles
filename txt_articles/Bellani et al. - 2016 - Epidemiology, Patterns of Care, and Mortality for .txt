IMPORTANCE Limited information exists about the epidemiology, recognition, management,
and outcomes of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
OBJECTIVES To evaluate intensive care unit (ICU) incidence and outcome of ARDS and to
assess clinician recognition, ventilation management, and use of adjuncts—for example prone
positioning—in routine clinical practice for patients fulfilling the ARDS Berlin Definition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Large Observational Study to Understand the
Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE) was an international,
multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing invasive or noninvasive
ventilation, conducted during 4 consecutive weeks in the winter of 2014 in a convenience
sample of 459 ICUs from 50 countries across 5 continents.
EXPOSURES Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was ICU incidence of ARDS.
Secondary outcomes included assessment of clinician recognition of ARDS, the application of
ventilatory management, the use of adjunctive interventions in routine clinical practice, and
clinical outcomes from ARDS.
RESULTS Of 29 144 patients admitted to participating ICUs, 3022 (10.4%) fulfilled ARDS
criteria. Of these, 2377 patients developed ARDS in the first 48 hours and whose respiratory
failure was managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. The period prevalence of mild ARDS
was 30.0% (95% CI, 28.2%-31.9%); of moderate ARDS, 46.6% (95% CI, 44.5%-48.6%); and
of severe ARDS, 23.4% (95% CI, 21.7%-25.2%). ARDS represented 0.42 cases per ICU bed over
4 weeks and represented 10.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-10.7%) of ICU admissions and 23.4% of
patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Clinical recognition of ARDS ranged from 51.3%
(95% CI, 47.5%-55.0%) in mild to 78.5% (95% CI, 74.8%-81.8%) in severe ARDS. Less than
two-thirds of patients with ARDS received a tidal volume 8 of mL/kg or less of predicted body
weight. Plateau pressure was measured in 40.1% (95% CI, 38.2-42.1), whereas 82.6% (95% CI,
81.0%-84.1%) received a positive end-expository pressure (PEEP) of less than 12 cm H2O.
Prone positioning was used in 16.3% (95% CI, 13.7%-19.2%) of patients with severe ARDS.
Clinician recognition of ARDS was associated with higher PEEP, greater use of neuromuscular
blockade, and prone positioning. Hospital mortality was 34.9% (95% CI, 31.4%-38.5%) for
those with mild, 40.3% (95% CI, 37.4%-43.3%) for those with moderate, and 46.1% (95% CI,
41.9%-50.4%) for those with severe ARDS.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among ICUs in 50 countries, the period prevalence of ARDS
was 10.4% of ICU admissions. This syndrome appeared to be underrecognized and
undertreated and associated with a high mortality rate. These findings indicate the potential
for improvement in the management of patients with ARDS.

A
cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute
inflammatory lung injury, associated with increased
pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung
weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue.1 Although prior epi-
demiologic studies have provided substantial insights into
ARDS,2-5 there remains limited information about the epide-
miology, recognition, management, and outcomes of pa-
tients with the ARDS, especially in the era of the current Berlin
Definition.1 This definition was constructed empirically and
validated using retrospective cohorts1; however, prospective
studiesoftheBerlinDefinitionhavebeenlimitedtosmallnum-
bers of centers and patients.6,7
We set out to address some clinically important ques-
tions regarding ARDS. The current incidence and mortality of
ARDS in a large international cohort is not known. Large re-
gional differences have been suggested; for example, the in-
cidence of ARDS in Europe5 is reported to be 10-fold lower than
in the United States.4 A number of ventilatory interventions,
such as lower tidal volumes,8 higher positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP),9 and adjuncts such as prone positioning,10
neuromuscular blockade,11 and extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation12 for ARDS have been proposed. It is not clear how
these interventions are applied in routine practice in the
broader international context. Implementation of effective
therapies may be limited by lack of recognition of ARDS by
clinicians.13,14UnderstandingthefactorsassociatedwithARDS
recognition and its effect on management could lead to effec-
tive interventions to improve care.
Therefore, we undertook the Large Observational Study
to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory
Failure (LUNG SAFE) to determine the intensive care unit (ICU)
epidemiology and outcomes from ARDS, assess clinician rec-
ognitionofARDS,andunderstandhowcliniciansusemechani-
cal ventilation and adjunctive interventions in routine clini-
cal practice.
Methods
Study Design
This study was an international, multicenter, prospective co-
hort study. The enrollment window consisted of 4 consecutive
winter weeks (February-March 2014 in the Northern hemi-
sphere and June-August 2014 in the Southern hemisphere), as
selected by each ICU. We aimed to recruit a broadly represen-
tative sample of ICUs by public announcements by the Euro-
pean Society of Intensive Care Medicine, by national societies
and networks endorsing the study, and by designated national
coordinators (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). The study ICUs
represent a convenience sample of those that agreed to partici-
pate in the study and had enrolled at least 1 patient. Different
ICUs from the same hospital were considered as separate cen-
ters; each ICU provided baseline data concerning its resources
(eTable1intheSupplement).AllparticipatingICUsobtainedeth-
ics committee approval and obtained either patient consent or
ethics committee waiver of consent. We recruited physicians
from each participating country as lead site investigators and
national coordinators. Site investigators (eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement) were also responsible for ensuring data integrity
and validity, and were offered web-based training to enhance
chest x-ray interpretation reliability as part of a substudy.
Patients, Study Design, and Data Collection
All patients, including ICU transfers, admitted to an ICU within
the 4-week enrollment window and receiving invasive or non-
invasive ventilation were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were age
younger than 16 years or inability to obtain informed con-
sent, when required. Following enrollment, patients were
evaluated daily for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, de-
fined as the concurrent presence of (1) ratio of arterial oxygen
tensiontoinspiredfractionofoxygen(PaO2/FIO2)of300mmHg
orless;(2)newpulmonaryparenchymalabnormalitiesonchest
x-ray or computed tomography; and (3) ventilatory support
with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), expiratory
positive airway pressure (EPAP), or positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O or more
Day 1 was defined as the first day that acute hypoxemic re-
spiratory failure criteria were satisfied, irrespective of ICU ad-
mission date. The case report form (eAppendix 3 in the Supple-
ment) automatically prompted investigators to provide an
expanded data set for days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 or at
ICUdischargeordeath.Alldatawererecordedatthesametime,
normally as close as possible to 10 AM each day. Patient out-
comes included date of liberation from mechanical ventila-
tion and vital status at ICU discharge and at either hospital dis-
charge or at day 90, whichever occurred earlier.
Quality Control
At the time of data entry, the site investigators were required
to answer all queries raised by the case report form before they
could electronically finalize a patient data set. Patient data sets
that were not finalized were not included in the analysis
(Figure 1). In addition, prior to analysis, all data were screened
for potentially erroneous data and outliers. These data were
verified or corrected by site investigators. We followed the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology (STROBE) statement guidelines for observational
cohort studies.15
Identification and Recognition of ARDS
ThediagnosisofARDSwasmadebyacomputeralgorithminthe
analysis phase of the study using the raw data that made up the
variouscomponentsoftheBerlinARDSDefinition:(1)presence

We assessed clinician recognition of ARDS at 2 time points.
On day 1 of study entry, site investigators indicated the rea-
sons for the patient’

tential cause. If the answer was “yes,” ARDS was deemed to
have been clinician-recognized on day 1. When patients ex-

ARDS Severity and Mechanical Ventilation Parameters
Patients with ARDS undergoing invasive ventilation were cat-
egorized on the day of ARDS diagnosis based on their
PaO2/FIO2 ratio into mild (200 <PaO2/FIO2 ≤300 mm Hg),
moderate (100 <PaO2/FIO2 ≤200 mm Hg), and severe
(PaO2/FIO2 <100 mm Hg) based on the Berlin Definition.1
Given the lack of clarity in the Berlin Definition regarding the
severity classification of patients managed with noninvasive
ventilation, and the difficulty in comparing noninvasive ven-
tilation settings to invasive modes, we excluded patients ven-
tilated on noninvasive ventilation from the analyses pertain-
ing to severity, ventilator management or outcome. To
ensure a more homogenous data set, we restricted subse-
quent analyses to the large subset of patients (93.1%) fulfill-
ing ARDS criteria on day 1 or 2 from onset of acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure.
Invasive ventilator-free days were calculated as the num-
ber of days from weaning from invasive ventilation to day 28.
Patients who died before weaning were considered to have a
ventilator-free-day value of 0. Driving pressure was defined
as plateau pressure (Pplat) minus PEEP.
Patients were considered to have no evidence for sponta-
neous ventilation when set and measured respiratory rates
were equal.
Calculation of Period Prevalence
and Per-ICU-Bed ARDS Incidence
The period prevalence of patients with ARDS was calculated by
dividing the number of patients fulfilling ARDS criteria by the
totalnumberofpatientsadmittedtotheICUinthe28-daystudy
period (ie, 29 160). The number of patients with ARDS per ICU
bed over the 4-week study period was calculated as number of
patients with ARDS/number of ICU beds available.
ICU Enrollment and Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome was to determine the ICU incidence of
ARDS. Secondary outcomes included assessment of clinician
recognition of ARDS, the application of ventilatory manage-
ment, the use of adjunctive interventions in routine clinical
practice, and the outcomes from ARDS. We wished to enroll
at least 1000 patients with ARDS. Assuming a 30% mortality,
300 deaths would allow us to evaluate at least 30 associated
variablesinmultivariablemodels.16Priorepidemiologicalstud-
iesreportedanARDSincidencerangingbetween2.2%and19%
ofICUpatients.2-5Basedonaconservativeaprioriestimatethat
5% of ICU admissions would have ARDS and projecting that a
medium-sized ICU admits 50 patients per month, we planned
to enroll at least 500 ICUs worldwide.

Results
Participating ICUs and Patients Enrolled
Six hundred sixty-six ICUs registered for the study. Following
data verification and elimination of nonrecruiting sites, 459
ICUs from 50 countries were included in the final analysis
(eTable 1 and eTable 3 in the Supplement). Of the 29 144 pa-
tients admitted to these ICUs during the enrollment period,
13 566 patients receiving ventilatory support were enrolled.
Complete data sets from 12 906 patients were analyzed
(Figure 1). Table 1 outlines their key characteristics.
Characteristics of Patients Enrolled
Of 4499 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure,
3022 (67.2%) fulfilled ARDS criteria during their ICU stay. Of
these, 2813 (93.1%) developed ARDS at day 1 (n = 2665) or day
2 (n = 148), whereas 209 patients (6.9%) developed ARDS af-
ter day 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (Figure 1). The
436patients(14.4%)withARDSwhoreceivednoninvasiveven-
tilation were excluded from analyses regarding ARDS sever-
ity, mechanical ventilation settings, and outcome.
ICU Incidence of ARDS
ARDS represented 10.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-10.7%) of total ICU
admissions and 23.4% (95% CI, 21.7%-25.2%)of all patients re-
quiring mechanical ventilation and constituted 0.42 cases/
ICU bed over 4 weeks. There was some geographic variation,
with Europe having an incidence of 0.48 cases/ICU bed over
4 weeks; North America, 0.46; South America, 0.31; Asia, 0.27;
Africa, 0.32; and Oceania, 0.57 cases/ICU bed per 4 weeks.

ARDS ranged from 51.3% (95% CI, 47.5%-55.0%) for mild
ARDS to 78.5% (95% CI, 74.8%-81.8%) for severe ARDS
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). Clinician recognition of ARDS
at the time of fulfillment of ARDS criteria was 34.0% (95%
CI, 32.0-36.0), suggesting that diagnosis of ARDS was fre-
quently delayed.
A multivariable analysis including variables from the
bivariable analyses (eTable 5 in the Supplement), revealed
several patient and organizational factors associated with
clinician recognition of ARDS. Higher nurse-to-patient
ratios, higher physician-to-patient ratios, younger patient
age and a lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and the presence of pneu-
monia or pancreatitis were factors independently associated
with higher probability of clinician recognition (Table 2).

cardiac failure were associated with reduced likelihood of
clinician recognition of ARDS (Table 2). The mean tidal vol-
ume was 7.5 mL/kg (95% CI, 7.4-7.6 mL/kg) of predicted
body weight (PBW) among patients whose physicians recog-
nized ARDS, marginally lower than that of 7.7 mL/kg (95%
CI, 7.6-7.9 mL/kg) in patients whose ARDS was not recog-
nized (P = .01). The mean PEEP level was 8.9 cm H2O (95%
CI, 8.8-9.1 cm H2O) in patients whose ARDS was recognized,
higher than that of 7.5 cm H2O (95% CI, 7.3-7.7 cm H2O) in
patients whose ARDS was not recognized (P < .001). Physi-
cians who recognized ARDS used adjunctive treatments
more than physicians who did not (43.9% vs 21.7%,
P < .001; eTable 4 in the Supplement). After adjusting for
potentially confounding variables, there was no statistically
significant association between clinician-recognized ARDS
and tidal volumes (eTable 6 in the Supplement) or Pplat
recording (eTable 7 in the Supplement). In contrast, clini-
cian recognition of ARDS was statistically associated with
the use of higher levels of PEEP, and greater use of prone
positioning and neuromuscular blockade (eTables 8-10 in
the Supplement).
ARDS Severity
A total of 2377 patients developed ARDS in the first 48 hours
of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and received invasive
mechanical ventilation. The period prevalence of mild ARDS
was 30.0% (95% CI, 28.2%-31.9%); moderate, 46.6% (95%
CI, 44.5%-48.6%); and severe, 23.4% (95% CI, 21.7%-25.2%)
(Figure 1). Ventilator management differed among the ARDS
severity groups, while the use of adjunctive measures
increased and mortality was higher with greater ARDS sever-
ity (Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5). At diagnosis, increasing
ARDS severity was paralleled by worsening Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, which was largely
accounted for by the pulmonary component. The nonpul-
monary component of the SOFA score was higher in patients
with an increased ARDS severity category (Table 3). The
PaCO2 increased and pH decreased in patients with increased
ARDS severity category (Table 3, eFigure 1A-B in the Supple-
ment). Three hundred sixteen patients (13.3%) with ARDS
had a PaCO2 of 60 mm Hg or higher. However, the extent and
severity of hypercapnia was relatively modest, even in
severe ARDS.
Mechanical Ventilation in ARDS
Ventilator management varied with ARDS severity (Table 3).
However, the decrease in tidal volume and increase in PEEP,
from mild to moderate to severe ARDS, while statistically sig-
nificant, was clinically modest (Table 3). In patients with ARDS
35.1% (95% CI, 33.1%-37.1%) received a tidal volume of more
than 8 mL/kg PBW (Figure 2A and eFigure 1C in the Supple-
ment), while 82.6% (95% CI, 81.0%-84.1%) received a PEEP of
less than 12 cm H2O.
The distribution of Pplat differed significantly with ARDS
severity (Figures 2B and eFigure 1D in the Supplement). Pplat
was measured in 40.1% (95% CI, 46.0%-51.0%) of patients,
irrespective of ARDS severity. This rose to 48.5% (95% CI,
46.0%-51.0%) of patients in whom there was no evidence for

A, Cumulative frequency distribution of tidal volume was similar in patients
in each severity category, with 65% of patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) receiving a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight
or less. B, In contrast, a right shift of the cumulative frequency distribution
curves of plateau pressures was seen for increasing ARDS severity category,
with plateau pressure of more than 30 cm H2O in 8.5% of patients for which
these data are available. C, Represents the distribution of day-1 tidal volume vs
plateau pressure for each patient for which these data are available.
Two-thirds of the patients fell within the limits for protective ventilation,
defined as plateau pressure less than or equal to 30 cm H2O and tidal volume
of less than or equal to 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight. Data refer to
the first day of ARDS.

spontaneous ventilation. Two-thirds of patients in whom
Pplat was reported received protective mechanical ventilation
as defined by a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg of PBW or less and
a Pplat of 30 cm H2O or less (Figure 2C). In patients in whom
Pplat was measured, 91.9% (95% CI, 88.1%-94.9%) of those
receiving a tidal volume of more than 8 mL/kg PBW had
a Pplat of 30 cm H2O or less (Figure 2C). Less than 3% of
patients received a tidal volume of more than 8 mL/kg and
had a Pplat pressure of more than 30 cm H2O (Figure 2C).
Therewasnorelationshipbetweentidalvolumeandeither
peak inspiratory pressure, Pplat or lung compliance (Figure 3A
and eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Tidal volume was signifi-

95% CI, 7.4-7.6 vs 7.9; 95% CI, 7.8-8.1 mL/kg PBW, P < .001;
Table 3).
Positive end-expiratory pressure levels were relatively low
(Table 3) and were higher in patients with higher peak inspi-
ratory pressure and higher Pplat. In addition, no relationship
was found between PEEP and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio, FIO2
(Figure 3B) or lung compliance (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between
FIO2 and SpO2, suggesting that clinicians used FIO2 to treat hy-
poxemia (Figure 3C).
Use of Adjunctive Measures
The use of adjunctive treatments in patients with ARDS on
day 1 or 2 was relatively low but increased with ARDS sever-
ity (Table 4). Continuous neuromuscular blocking agents,
high-dose steroids, and recruitment maneuvers were the
most frequently used adjuncts. In patients with severe
ARDS, continuous neuromuscular blockade was used in
37.8% (95% CI, 34.1%-41.2%), prone position in 16.3% (95%
CI, 13.7%-19.2%), and recruitment maneuvers in 32.7% (95%
CI, 29.3%-36.2%).
ARDS Outcomes
Severity of ARDS worsened in 356 (19.6%, 95% CI, 17.8%-
21.5%) patients with mild or moderate ARDS (Table 5).
There was a decreased likelihood of unassisted breathing
(Figure 4A) and survival (Figure 4B) at day 28 with increas-
ing severity. Overall, unadjusted ICU and hospital mortality
from ARDS were 35.3% (95% CI, 33.3%-37.2%) and 40.0%
(95% CI, 38.1%-42.1%), respectively (Figure 4 and Table 5).
The number of ventilator-free days decreased (eFigure 3 in
the Supplement), and the length of ICU—but not hospital—
stay, increased with greater ARDS severity category. Both
ICU and hospital survival decreased with increased ARDS
severity (Table 5). Patients with a driving pressure (ie, Pplat-
PEEP) of more than 14 cm H2O on day 1 had a worse out-
come (Figure 4C). There was a direct relationship between
both plateau and driving pressure quintile and mortality
rate (Figure 5).
Discussion
In this prospective study carried out in 459 ICUs in 50 coun-
tries in 5 continents, ARDS appeared to represent an impor-

increased in patients requiring higher inspired fraction of oxygen (FIO2).
C, There was a stepwise increase in FIO2 at lower arterial oxygen saturations,
with FIO2 steeply increasing at atrial oxygen saturation (SaO2) values lower than
91%. Data refer to the first day of ARDS.

tant public health problem globally, with some geographic
variation and with a very high mortality of approximately
40%. A major finding was the underrecognition of ARDS by
clinicians, the low use of contemporary ventilatory strate-
gies and adjuncts, and the limited effect of physician diag-
nosis of ARDS on treatment decisions. These findings indi-
cate the potential for improvement in management of
patients with ARDS.
In this study, the geographic variation in ARDS inci-
dence ranged from 0.27 to 0.57 cases per ICU bed per 4
weeks and prcentage of ICU admissions. Because we could
not estimate the population served by the ICUs in this
study, we could not calculate population incidence for
ARDS; therefore, relatively little can be inferred about the
burden of ARDS in participating countries. The nearly 2-fold
variation in ICU incidence in this study and the known
variation in ICU resources internationally may well explain
the variability in ARDS studies that involved specific geo-
graphic populations,5 with the highest estimates in the
United States4,17 and Australia.18,19 Our ICU incidence data
are concordant with other estimates using similar
approaches that have generated reliable population inci-
dence data.20
These results suggest that ARDS continues to be under-
recognized by clinicians in the era of the Berlin Definition,
similar to previous findings using the American-European
consensus conference (AECC) definition.14,21-23 A key fea-
ture of our study design was that data were collected for
each component of the Berlin Definition in all patients with
hypoxemia breathing with the aid of a ventilator, which
allowed us to identify patients with ARDS from the raw
data. We chose this approach to enable a more robust evalu-
ation of the incidence, as well to assess clinician recognition
of ARDS. The rate of clinician recognition of ARDS was low,
with 40% of all cases not being diagnosed. Clinician recog-
nition rates increased with increasing disease severity but
was still less than 80% in severe ARDS. Independent factors
contributing to clinician recognition were younger patient
age, lower predicted body weight, the presence of extrapul-
monary sepsis or pancreatitis, and greater disease severity.
Conversely, the absence of a risk factor for ARDS was associ-
ated with underrecognition of ARDS. Lower numbers of
nurses and physicians per ICU patient were both associated
with reduced clinician recognition of ARDS. It is possible
that the way in which the data were collected contributed,
in part, to clinician underrecognition of ARDS. Specifically,
it is possible that the ICU clinician knew that the patient had
ARDS, but this was not made known to the site investigators
or reported in the patient chart. However, not indicating the
diagnosis of ARDS in the chart constitutes a form of under-
recognition. In addition, that the study had an explicit focus
on ARDS, that all participants were offered online training
on ARDS diagnosis, and that the case report form asked at 2
separate points in the study if the patient had ARDS, make
this possibility less likely.
It is unclear whether clinician recognition of ARDS
affects outcome because recognition may be only one of a
number of barriers to the use of ventilatory and adjunctive

treatment strategies, while the sickest patients are more fre-
quently diagnosed.14,24 After adjusting for potential con-
founders, clinician diagnosis of ARDS was not indepen-
dently associated with the use of lower tidal volume.
Conversely, clinician diagnosis of ARDS was significantly
associated with the use of higher PEEP, prone positioning,
and neuromuscular blockade. Although the reasons for this
are unclear, clinicians do not appear influenced by the pres-
ence or absence of ARDS for setting tidal volume and may
be motivated by other factors (eg, perceived comfort, pH,
PaCO2, etc).
Our data appear to demonstrate the predictive validity
of the Berlin Definition, and are consistent with a recent
observational study.7 Increasing ARDS severity was associ-
ated with longer ICU stay, more days of invasive ventilation,
longer hospital stays, and higher mortality. Patients with
severe ARDS were younger, had fewer comorbidities but
had a significantly worse outcome. The proportion of
patients in each severity category was similar to that deter-
mined in retrospective analyses.1
ARDS appears to be undertreated in terms of the use of
optimal, proven, or recommended approaches to mechani-
cal ventilation and regarding the use of some adjunctive
measures. Plateau pressure was reported in only 40.1% of all
patients with ARDS, which increased to 48.5% of patients in
whom there was no evidence for spontaneous ventilation.
Although it is possible that patients in whom plateau pres-
sure was measured were ventilated differently, this did not
appear to be the case, at least in terms of tidal volume. We
found no evidence to suggest that lower tidal volumes or
higher PEEP were used in patients with a less compliant
respiratory system or greater ARDS severity as reported in
prior studies.22 Low tidal volume ventilation was the most
frequently used intervention, but more than one-third of all
patients with ARDS received a tidal volume of more than 8
mL/kg of PBW, and approximately 60% received a tidal vol-
ume of more than 7 mL/kg of PBW. This finding is consistent
with recent nonprotocolized RCTs in which patients
received larger tidal volumes than expected.12,25 In our
study, PEEP was relatively low and constant across the spec-
trum of ARDS severity, with more than 80% of patients with
ARDS receiving PEEP of 12 cm H2O or less. Hypoxemia
appeared to be treated predominantly by increasing
FIO2. High levels of permissive hypercapnia were infre-
quent. Adjunctive measures were used infrequently; this
appeared to be the case for less expensive interventions
such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, as
well as for expensive and invasive technologies such as
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. It is possible that
the relatively low use of adjunctive measures such as neuro-
muscular blockade or prone positioning reflects ongoing
uncertainty about the quality of evidence supporting these
interventions.
ARDS continues to have a high mortality, despite
advances in supportive care. There was a significant
increase in mortality with each increase in ARDS severity
category. Overall, 40% of patients with ARDS died in the
hospital. Although detailed analyses of the factors contrib-
uting to outcome are beyond the scope of this article, we
also confirmed a recent report26 suggesting that higher driv-
ing pressure is associated with increased risk of death;
albeit, our data should be interpreted cautiously as Pplat was
available in a minority of patients.
This study has a number of limitations. Our focus on
winter months, while allowing us to examine the burden of
ARDS during the same season across the globe, may over-
state ICU incidence figures for ARDS, due to specific dis-
eases such as influenza.27 In addition, despite enrolling a
large number of ICUs from around the world, our conve-
nience sample may be prone to selection biases that may
limit generalizability; therefore, we are unable to calculate
population-based incidence figures for ARDS. Similar to
other epidemiological studies, we did not have access to the
source data for the patients in the enrolling ICUs, so it is
possible that not all patients with ARDS in participating cen-
ters were enrolled. However, enrollment of patients with
ARDS from participating ICUs met expectations based on
their recorded 2013 admission rates, while data from lower

recruiting ICUs was not different from that from higher
enrolling ICUs, suggesting the absence of reporting biases.
To ensure data quality, we instituted a robust data quality-
control program in which all centers were requested to
verify data that appeared inconsistent or erroneous.
Although chest x-ray interpretation was performed by
on-site clinicians, which potentially increased variability,
we attempted to standardize interpretation by offering all
the investigators web-based training. Another limitation is
the lack of data collection concerning the use of conserva-
tive fluid strategy. Lastly, our assumption that patients dis-
charged from the hospital before day 28 were alive at that
time point is a further limitation.
Conclusions
Among ICUs in 50 countries, the period prevalence of ARDS
was 10.4% of ICU admissions. This syndrome appeared to be
underrecognized, undertreated, and associated with a high
mortality rate. These findings indicate the potential for im-
provement in management of patients with ARDS.
