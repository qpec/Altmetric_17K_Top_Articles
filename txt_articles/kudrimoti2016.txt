Dusquetide,
 a novel
 Innate
 Defense
 Regulator,
 modulates
 the  innate
 immune
 system
 at  a  key  convergence
point
 in intracellular
 signaling
 pathways
 and
 has  demonstrated
 activity  in  both
 reducing  inflammation
and
 increasing
 clearance
 of
 bacterial  infection.
 Innate
 immunity
 has  also  been  implicated
 in
 the  pathogen-
esis
 of oral  mucositis
 (OM),  a  universal
 toxicity
 of  chemoradiation
 therapy
 (CRT).
 Testing
 the  hypothesis
that
 dusquetide
 can  mitigate
 the  development
 and
 duration
 of  OM,  preclinical
 studies
 have  been com-
pleted
 and  correlated
 with  interim
 results  from  a  Phase
 2 clinical  study  in  patients
 undergoing
 CRT  for
head
 and  neck  cancer.
 Dusquetide
 reduced
 the  duration
 of OM  in  mouse  and  hamster
 models
 by approx-
imately
 50%,  which  was  recapitulated
 by  the  50%
 reduction
 of  severe
 OM  (SOM)
 in  the  Phase
 2 trial.
 A
reduction
 in the  clinical  rate of  infection
 was
 also  observed,
 consistent
 with  previously  reported
 pre-
clinical
 studies.  In aggregate,
 these  results
 not  only  demonstrate
 the  safety
 and
 efficacy
 of  dusquetide
 in
addressing
 this
 unmet
 medical
 need,  but  also  provide  proof  of concept
 for  the  translation
 of dusquetide
action
 between
 animal
 models
 and  the  human  clinical
 setting,
 and  further  support  the  contention
 that
innate
 immunity
 is  an  important
 driver  for the  initiation
 and  continued
 impact
 of  OM.

 Introduction
Oral
 mucositis
 (OM)
 is
 a
 universal
 toxicity
 of
 chemoradiation
therapy
 (CRT)
 used
 for
 cancers
 of
 the
 oral
 cavity,
 oropharynx
 and
larynx,
 whose
 incidence
 continues
 to
 increase
 despite
 aggressive
intervention
 (Ryerson
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Severe
 OM
 (SOM)
 occurs
 in
almost
 75%
 of
 these
 patients
 and
 is
 among
 the
 most
 debilitat-
ing
 and
 painful
 side
 effects
 related
 to
 treatment
 (Elting
 et
 al.,
2009).
 SOM
 is
 associated
 with
 increased
 opioid
 use,
 weight
 loss,

reliance
 on
 supplemental
 feeding
 and
 hydration,
 breaks
 in
 treat-
ment,
 unplanned
 office,
 or
 emergency
 room
 visits
 and
 frequent
hospitalizations
 resulting
 in
 an
 incremental
 cost
 of
 $18,000
 per
patient
 (Nonzee
 et
 al.,
 2008).
 OM,
 including
 SOM,
 is
 a
 common
feature
 of
 many
 other
 treatment
 regimens
 for
 cancers
 other
 than
head
 and
 neck,
 albeit
 generally
 occurring
 with
 lesser
 frequency
 and
duration
 (Peterson
 et
 al.,
 2011;
 Kudrimoti
 et
 al.,
 2008).
There
 are
 no
 Food
 and
 Drug
 Administration
 (FDA)-approved
drugs
 to
 ameliorate
 SOM
 in
 patients
 with
 head
 and
 neck
 squamous
cell
 carcinoma.
 The
 only
 approved
 therapy
 for
 oral
 mucositis
 in
 any
context
 is
 palifermin
 (Nguyen
 et
 al.,
 2015;
 Lucchese
 et
 al.,
 2016),
a
 tissue
 growth
 factor
 that
 is
 approved
 for
 use
 in
 patients
 with
hematologic
 malignancies
 receiving
 myelotoxic
 therapy
 requiring
hematopoietic
 stem
 cell
 support.
 However,
 palifermin
 is
 associ-
ated
 with
 a
 potential
 risk
 of
 stimulating/encouraging
 solid
 tumor
proliferation
 (McDonnell
 and
 Lenz,
 2007)
 and
 is
 therefore
 used
 in
hematologic
 cancers
 only.
 Other
 approaches,
 such
 as
 photobiomod-
ulation,
 have
 also
 been
 evaluated,
 including
 in
 head
 and
 neck
 cancer
patients
 (Fekrazad
 and
 Chiniforush,
 2014);
 although,
 concerns
 have
been
 raised
 here
 as
 well
 about
 the
 potential
 negative
 impact
 on
tumor
 control
 (Sonis
 et
 al.,
 2016)
As
 the
 biological
 complexity
 of
 OM
 has
 become
 increasingly
clear,
 preclinical
 and
 clinical
 data
 have
 accumulated
 supporting
 a
role
 for
 an
 exaggerated
 innate
 immune
 response
 as
 a
 key
 initiat-
ing
 event
 and
 a
 continuing
 contributor
 in
 its
 pathogenesis
 (Sonis,
2004).
 The
 response
 of
 the
 innate
 defense
 system
 to
 the
 result-
ing
 CRT-induced
 damage-associated
 molecular
 patterns
 (DAMPs)
results
 in
 an
 inflammatory
 cascade
 that
 culminates
 in
 apoptosis
of
 epithelial
 stem
 cells,
 mucosal
 atrophy
 and
 ultimately
 ulcera-
tion
 (Sonis,
 2004,
 2007;
 Sonis
 et
 al.,
 2007;
 Logan
 et
 al.,
 2007).
 The
resulting
 ulceration
 continues
 to
 send
 DAMP
 signals,
 as
 well
 as
potential
 pathogen-associated
 molecular
 pattern
 (PAMP)
 signals
due
 to
 infection,
 further
 exacerbating
 the
 inflammatory
 response.
Therefore,
 the
 innate
 immune
 response
 is
 a
 potential
 target
 to
attenuate
 both
 the
 incidence
 and
 duration
 of
 CRT-induced
 OM
(Sonis,
 2004,
 2007).
Dusquetide
 (SGX942)
 is
 a
 first-in-class
 Innate
 Defense
 Regu-
lator
 (IDR)
 that
 modulates
 the
 innate
 immune
 response
 to
 both
PAMPs
 and
 DAMPs
 by
 binding
 to
 p62,
 a
 key
 adaptor
 protein
 that
functions
 downstream
 to
 the
 key
 sensing
 receptors
 (e.g.,
 toll-like
receptors
 [TLRs],
 etc.)
 that
 trigger
 innate
 immune
 activation
 (Yu
et
 al.,
 2009).
 There
 are
 no
 other
 drug
 candidates
 which
 target
the
 p62
 protein.
 When
 the
 innate
 immune
 sentinel
 cell
 is
 acti-
vated,
 the
 presence
 of
 dusquetide
 modulates
 the
 cellular
 signaling
from
 a
 pro-inflammatory,
 pro-macrophage
 response
 to
 an
 anti-
inflammatory,
 heightened
 pro-macrophage
 response.
 This
 leads
 to
decreased
 inflammation
 with
 increased
 bacterial
 clearance
 and
 tis-
sue
 healing
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016;
 Scott
 et
 al.,
 2007;
 Yu
 et
 al.,
 2009).
Importantly,
 both
 circulating
 and
 tissue
 resident
 innate
 immune
cells
 respond
 to
 dusquetide
 treatment,
 making
 it
 useful
 even
 in
the
 context
 of
 immunosuppression
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 Dusque-
tide
 therefore
 has
 the
 potential
 to
 address
 each
 of
 the
 stages
 of
the
 pathogenesis
 of
 oral
 mucositis,
 decreasing
 the
 innate
 immune
amplification
 of
 the
 damage
 signaling
 (and
 subsequent
 exacerba-
tion
 of
 tissue
 damage),
 decreasing
 the
 incidence
 and
 increasing
the
 clearance
 of
 any
 secondary
 infections
 and
 aiding
 in
 the
 tissue
healing
 and
 resolution
 of
 mucositis.
 As
 such,
 dusquetide
 would
 be
expected
 to
 decrease
 the
 duration
 of
 OM.
 Importantly,
 dusquetide
does
 not
 mitigate
 the
 direct
 damage
 done
 by
 CRT
 to
 the
 tumor
 (or
the
 surrounding
 normal
 tissue).
The
 safety
 of
 single
 and
 multiple
 ascending
 doses
 of
 intravenous
(IV)
 dusquetide
 was
 demonstrated
 in
 a
 placebo-controlled
 study
of
 84
 healthy
 human
 volunteers,
 in
 which
 dusquetide
 was
 found
to
 be
 safe
 and
 well
 tolerated
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 In
 the
 groups
receiving
 multiple
 doses,
 most
 adverse
 events
 (AEs)
 were
 related
to
 minor
 infusion/venipuncture
 reactions.
 Other
 reported
 AEs
 were
somnolence
 (4/20
 dusquetide
 patients,
 2/10
 placebo
 patients),
 ala-
nine
 aminotransferase
 (ALT)
 elevation
 (3/20
 dusquetide
 patients,
1/10
 placebo
 patients),
 and
 back
 pain
 (3/20
 dusquetide
 patients,
1/10
 placebo
 patients).
 In
 vitro
 exposure
 to
 endotoxin
 of
 peripheral
blood
 cells
 from
 the
 same
 cohort,
 demonstrated
 an
 increase
 in
 anti-
inflammatory
 markers
 and
 a
 decrease
 in
 inflammatory
 markers
following
 administration
 of
 low
 doses
 (0.15–2.0
 mg/kg)
 of
 dusque-
tide
 relative
 to
 those
 subjects
 exposed
 to
 placebo
 (North
 et
 al.,
2016).
 Blood
 from
 patients
 exposed
 to
 high
 doses
 (3.0–8.0
 mg/kg)
of
 dusquetide,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 had
 responses
 similar
 to
 those
receiving
 placebo
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
Given
 the
 proposed
 role
 of
 innate
 immunity
 in
 mucositis,
dusquetide
 was
 tested
 first
 in
 preclinical
 models
 of
 mucositis.
 Sub-
sequently,
 dusquetide
 was
 assessed
 in
 a
 well-characterized
 clinical
setting
 in
 a
 Phase
 2a
 study
 specifically
 focusing
 on
 oral
 mucositis
in
 order
 to
 evaluate
 dusquetide’s
 safety,
 efficacy
 and
 consistency
 of
the
 response
 with
 preclinical
 results.

 was
 administered
 to
 male
 C3H/HeN
mice
 on
 Days
 −4
 and
 −2.
 On
 Day
 0,
 a
 chemical
 burn
 was
 applied
 to
the
 underside
 of
 the
 mouse
 tongue,
 inducing
 mucositis
 which
 gen-
erally
 peaked
 on
 Day
 2
 (Sonis
 et
 al.,
 1990).
 Mouse
 tongues
 were
scored
 from
 0
 to
 5
 for
 mucositis
 daily
 from
 Days
 1
 to
 14
 by
 2
blinded
 observers.
 Body
 weights
 were
 also
 measured
 daily
 and
 col-
itis
 severity
 was
 determined
 by
 video
 endoscopy
 on
 Days
 4
 and
 7.
Dusquetide
 (25
 mg/kg
 IV)
 was
 administered
 after
 chemotherapy
on
 Days
 −1,
 2
 and
 5
 in
 3
 independent
 experiments
 and
 the
 average
duration
 as
 a
 percent
 of
 the
 placebo
 (saline)
 response
 was
 averaged
across
 the
 3
 experiments.
 The
 dusquetide
 response
 was
 statistically
significant
 (p

 observers
 between
 Days
 7
 and
 35,
with
 peak
 mucositis
 severity
 generally
 occurring
 around

and
 2–3
 days
 later
 5
 ×
 106 MCF-7
 cells
 were
 implanted
 subcuta-
neously.
 Once
 tumors
 reached
 an
 average
 size
 of
 100
 mm3,
 the
animals
 were
 randomized
 into
 6
 groups
 of
 10
 animals
 and
 received
control,
 dusquetide,
 paclitaxel

 (saline)
 was
 administered
 IV
 on
 Days
0,
 4,
 7,
 10,
 and
 14.
 Paclitaxel
 (6
 mg/kg
 IP)
 or
 radiation
 therapy
(2
 Gy/Day)
 was
 undertaken
 on
 Days
 1,
 3
 and
 5.
 Tumors
 were
 mea-

 An
 unexpected
 number
 of
 deaths
 occurred
 in
 all
 treatment
groups,
 unrelated
 to
 treatment
 with
 study
 drug,
 and
 thus
 tumor
volumes
 can
 only
 be
 reliably
 interpreted
 up
 to
 Study
 Day

2.2.
 Peptide
Dusquetide
 (acetate
 salt,
 research
 name:
 SGX94)
 was
 synthe-
sized
 by
 solution
 phase
 synthesis
 (PPL,
 Inc.).
 Peptide
 purity
 was
analyzed
 by
 high
 performance
 liquid
 chromatography
 (HPLC)
 and
was
 typically
 greater
 than
 97%.
 Dusquetide
 was
 formulated
 in
 aque-
ous
 solution
 for
 intravenous
 (IV)
 administration
 (drug
 product
research
 name:
 SGX942).
2.3.
 Phase
 2a
 clinical
 study
The
 primary
 objective
 of
 this
 exploratory
 trial
 was
 to
 assess
the
 safety
 and
 effectiveness
 of
 dusquetide
 compared
 to
 placebo
in
 attenuating
 the
 duration
 and/or
 incidence
 of
 SOM
 in
 patients
undergoing
 CRT
 for
 head
 and
 neck
 cancer.
 Secondary
 objectives
included
 assessing
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 the
 drug
 in
 reducing
 ulcera-
tive
 oral
 mucositis
 (UOM)
 and
 determining
 which
 patient
 baseline
characteristics
 define
 subpopulations
 in
 which
 dusquetide
 had
particular
 effectiveness.
 The
 null
 hypothesis
 was
 that
 dusquetide
would
 not
 positively
 impact
 the
 duration
 and/or
 severity
 of
 OM.
2.3.1.
 Subjects
This
 study
 was
 conducted
 in
 the
 United
 States
 with
 21
 of
 27
sites
 enrolling
 at
 least
 1
 subject,
 in
 accordance
 with
 the

of
 the
 Declaration
 of
 Helsinki
 and
 with
 the
 approval
 of
 institutional
review
 boards
 at
 each
 center.
 This
 Phase
 2a
 study
 was
 regis-
tered
 with
 ClinicalTrials.gov
 (NCT02013050).
 Patient
 enrollment
was
 completed
 between
 December
 2013
 and
 August
 2015.
Inclusion/exclusion
 criteria:
 Eligible
 patients
 were
 at
 least
 18
years
 of
 age
 with
 locally
 advanced
 (Stages
 III-IVA/B)
 squamous
 cell
carcinoma
 of
 the
 oral
 cavity
 or
 oropharynx,
 and
 adequate
 organ
function
 and
 performance
 status.
 All
 patients
 were
 scheduled
 to
receive
 a
 continuous
 course
 of
 conventional
 intensity
 modulated
radiation
 therapy
 (IMRT)
 administered
 as
 single
 daily
 fractions
 of
2.0
 to
 2.2
 Gy,
 with
 a
 cumulative
 radiation
 dose
 between
 55
 and
72
 Gy
 at
 each
 of
 at
 least
 2
 oral
 sites
 concurrent
 with
 cisplatin
 admin-
istered
 either
 weekly
 (30–40
 mg/m2 for
 up
 to
 7
 doses)
 or
 every
third
 week
 (80–100
 mg/m2 for
 3
 doses).
 Patients
 who
 had
 received
surgery
 were
 eligible
 if
 the
 surgery
 had
 been
 performed
 within
10
 weeks
 prior
 to
 the
 planned
 initial
 dose
 of
 study
 drug.
 Patients
with
 prior
 head
 and
 neck
 radiotherapy,
 chemotherapy
 within
 12
months,
 scheduled
 to
 receive
 cetuximab,
 clinically
 significant
 organ
system
 dysfunction,
 or
 who
 were
 pregnant,
 breast-feeding,
 or

 were
 not
 eligible.
All
 patients
 signed
 written
 informed
 consent
 prior
 to
 study
 enroll-
ment.
2.3.2.
 Study
 design
This
 was
 a
 double
 blind,
 placebo-controlled
 trial.
 The
 initial
 sam-
ple
 size
 of
 78
 patients
 for
 this
 exploratory
 study
 was
 set
 based
 the
assumption
 that
 SGX942
 treated
 patients
 would
 have
 a
 median
duration
 of
 SOM
 (WHO
 Grade
 3
 or
 higher)
 of
 about
 11
 days
 and
placebo
 treated
 subjects
 would
 have
 a
 median
 duration
 of
 SOM
of
 about
 27
 days.
 Using
 these
 assumptions
 and
 no
 adjustment
 for
multiple
 testing,
 a
 total
 of
 21
 placebo
 patients
 and
 27
 total
 patients
in
 the
 SGX942
 1.5
 mg/kg
 group,
 would
 yield
 at
 least
 88%
 power
 to
detect
 a
 statistical
 difference
 (27
 days
 vs.
 11
 days)
 with
 alpha
 =
 0.1
using
 a
 log-rank
 test.
Patients
 received
 study
 drug
 (i.e.,
 dusquetide
 or
 placebo
 given
IV)
 within
 3
 days
 of
 starting
 radiation
 treatment
 and
 then
 twice
a
 week
 (every
 3rd
 day
 ±
 1
 day)
 while
 receiving
 radiation
 therapy.
The
 initial
 dose
 escalation
 phase
 of
 the
 trial
 assessed
 the
 safety
of
 dusquetide
 or
 placebo
 given
 for
 a
 maximum
 of
 14
 doses
 to
consecutive
 cohorts
 of
 six
 patients
 randomized
 to
 dusquetide
 or
placebo
 with
 equal
 numbers
 of
 patients
 (i.e.,
 3
 placebo:
 3
 SGX942).
Doses
 of
 dusquetide
 used
 were
 1.5,
 3.0
 and
 6.0
 mg/kg.
 After
 com-
pletion
 of
 the
 treatment
 course
 within
 a
 filled
 cohort,
 the
 data
 were
reviewed
 by
 an
 independent
 Data
 Review
 Committee
 (DRC)
 con-
sisting
 of
 a
 statistician,
 oncologist
 and
 preclinical
 researcher.
 Once
the
 DRC
 determined
 that
 there
 were
 no
 safety
 concerns,
 the
 next
cohort
 receiving
 the
 next
 higher
 dose
 of
 dusquetide
 was
 started.
In
 the
 second
 portion
 of
 the
 trial,
 patients
 were
 randomized
 to
receive
 1.5
 mg/kg
 dusquetide,
 6.0
 mg/kg
 dusquetide,
 or
 placebo
given
 twice
 weekly
 throughout
 radiation
 therapy
 and
 random-
ized
 4:4:1
 respectively
 to
 yield
 an
 approximately
 equal
 distribution
across
 the
 placebo,
 1.5
 and
 6.0
 mg/kg
 treatment
 groups
 over
 the
course
 of
 the
 entire
 study.
 Following
 a
 pre-specified
 interim
 anal-
ysis
 by
 the
 DRC
 after
 84
 patients
 had
 completed
 their
 therapy,
 an
additional
 27
 patients
 were
 enrolled
 into
 the
 trial,
 and
 randomized
equally
 to
 1.5
 mg/kg
 dusquetide
 or
 placebo
 at
 select
 sites
 (Supple-
mental
 Fig.
 2).
All
 patients
 receiving
 any
 study
 drug
 were
 included
 in
 the
 safety
analyses.
 Because
 the
 incidence
 of
 OM
 is
 highly
 correlated
 to
 the
cumulative
 radiation
 dose
 received,
 the
 primary
 efficacy
 popula-
tion
 was
 prospectively
 defined
 as
 consisting
 of
 patients
 receiving
a
 minimum
 cumulative
 radiation
 dose
 of
 55
 Gy
 to
 the
 oral
 cavity
or
 oropharynx.
 For
 the
 efficacy
 analyses,
 patients
 for
 both
 parts
 of
the
 study
 that
 receive
 the
 same
 dose
 of
 dusquetide
 were
 pooled.
Because
 only
 3
 patients
 were
 randomized
 to
 the
 3.0
 mg/kg
 dus-
quetide,
 no
 effectiveness
 conclusions
 can
 be
 drawn
 at
 this
 dose.
2.3.3.
 Assessment
 of
 OM,
 AEs,
 infections,
 and
 tumor
 response
The
 severity
 of
 OM
 was
 determined
 using
 WHO
 criteria
 (Sonis
2004;
 World
 Health
 Organization,
 1979)
 and
 was
 assessed
 by
trained
 staff
 twice
 weekly
 from
 baseline
 to
 the
 last
 study
 drug
treatment.
 If
 UOM
 persisted
 (WHO
 score
 ≥2)
 at
 last
 study
 drug
treatment,
 OM
 was
 further
 assessed
 weekly
 thereafter
 to
 the
 1-
month
 follow-up
 visit,
 at
 which
 point
 all
 subjects
 had
 a
 follow-up
evaluation.
 SOM
 was
 defined
 as
 a
 WHO
 score
 of
 ≥3
 and
 the
 dura-
tion
 of
 SOM
 defined
 as
 the
 time
 between
 the
 initial
 assessment
 of
 a
WHO
 score
 ≥3
 to
 the
 last
 time
 a
 score
 of
 ≥3
 was
 noted.
 Any
 patient
with
 unresolved
 SOM
 had
 their
 duration
 censored
 at
 the
 time
 of
the
 last
 assessment
 of
 OM.
 Standard
 clinical
 chemistry
 and
 hema-
tology
 studies
 were
 performed
 using
 samples
 obtained
 at
 baseline,
at
 2,
 4
 and
 6
 weeks,
 on
 the
 last
 day
 of
 study
 drug
 treatment,
 and
1
 month
 after
 completion
 of
 treatment.
 AEs
 were
 recorded
 at
 each
visit,
 including
 all
 clinical
 diagnoses
 of
 infection
 and
 the
 investi-
gator’s
 assessment
 as
 to
 whether
 the
 infection
 was
 severe.
 Repeat
radiologic
 scans
 were
 obtained
 1
 month
 following
 completion
 of
treatment
 and
 were
 compared
 to
 the
 staging
 scans
 using
 the
 RECIST
1.1
 criteria
 (Eisenhauer
 et
 al.,
 2009).
Duration
 of
 SOM,
 severity-weighted
 duration
 area
 under
 the
curve
 (AUC),
 and
 time
 to
 onset
 were
 compared

 The
 incidence
 of
 OM
 and
 incidence
 of
 infections
 was
 com-
pared
 using
 Fisher’s
 exact
 test.
 The
 objective
 of
 this
 exploratory
study
 was
 to
 assess
 trends
 in
 biological
 efficacy
 and
 as
 such
 the
statistical
 significance
 threshold
 was
 prospectively
 set
 at

 Results
3.1.
 Preclinical
 data
The
 impact
 of
 dusquetide
 on
 mucositis
 was
 assessed
 in
 the
 con-
text
 of
 chemotherapy-induced
 mucositis,
 assessing
 responses
 in
both
 the
 oral
 cavity
 and
 the
 lower
 gastrointestinal
 (GI)
 tract,
 and
in
 the
 context
 of
 fractionated
 radiation,
 directed
 at
 the
 oral
 cav-
ity
 alone.
 In
 each
 case,
 up
 to
 a
 50%
 reduction
 in
 the
 duration
 of
OM
 was
 observed
 (Fig.
 1a,b,c).
 Similar
 reductions
 in
 AUC
 were
 also
observed
 (Supplemental
 Fig.
 3).
 The
 impact
 of
 dose
 was
 evaluated
in
 each
 study
 by
 assessing
 dosing
 time
 and/or
 frequency.
 In
 general,
repeated
 administration
 of
 dusquetide
 was
 not
 associated
 with
an
 increased
 benefit
 (e.g.,
 Fig.
 1a),
 suggesting
 that
 more
 frequent
dosing
 was
 not
 beneficial.
 This
 finding
 is
 consistent
 with
 previous
studies
 in
 bacterial
 infection
 models
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
To
 further
 investigate
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 dusquetide
 may
 mit-
igate
 damage
 in
 the
 lower
 GI
 tract,
 a
 more
 severe
 DSS
 colitis
 mouse
model
 was
 utilized
 (Fig.
 1d).
 By
 Day
 14,
 all
 3
 dusquetide
 treat-
ment
 regimens
 demonstrated
 a
 statistically
 significant
 reduction
in
 endoscopic
 colitis
 severity
 score;
 however,
 reduction
 in
 Day
 7
scores
 were
 only
 observed
 in
 groups
 which
 had
 received
 at
 least
 2
doses
 of
 dusquetide
 by
 Day
 7.
 On
 Day
 21
 all
 3
 dusquetide
 groups
appeared
 to
 be
 responding
 similarly.
 Histopathology
 on
 Day
 21
indicated
 that
 some
 dusquetide
 treated
 groups
 had
 statistically
 sig-
nificantly
 decreased
 edema
 and
 necrosis,
 whereas
 other
 dusquetide
treated
 groups
 had
 similar
 responses
 which
 did
 not
 reach
 statistical
significance
 (Supplemental
 Fig.
 1).
Pharmacodynamically,
 
dusquetide
 
modulates
 
the
 
innate
defense
 system
 and
 thereby
 alters
 the
 consequent
 toxicity
 of
radiation
 or
 chemotherapy.
 Given
 the
 proposed
 role
 of
 the
 innate
defense
 system
 in
 radiation
 treatment
 of
 tumors,
 specific
 evalu-
ation
 of
 the
 impact
 of
 dusquetide
 on
 radiation
 tumor
 treatment
was
 undertaken
 using
 a
 tumor
 xenograft
 model
 with
 likelihood
to
 demonstrate
 an
 innate
 immune
 mediated
 interference.
 Thus,
studies
 were
 undertaken
 in
 nude
 mice
 with
 a
 minimally
 disturbed
innate
 immune
 system,
 in
 which
 dusquetide
 had
 previously
demonstrated
 efficacy
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016),
 using
 the
 MCF-7
 tumor
line
 (i.e.,
 breast
 cancer
 cell
 line).
 MCF-7
 cells
 express
 p62,
 the
target
 of
 dusquetide
 action
 (Abcam
 Product
 Datasheet,
 2016),
 and
are
 Beclin+/− and
 therefore
 autophagy
 deficient,
 making
 them
highly
 sensitive
 to
 interference
 with
 p62,
 a
 central
 protein
 in
the
 autophagic
 machinery
 (Aita
 et
 al.,
 1999;
 Rosenfeldt
 and
 Ryan
2009).
Treatment
 of
 MCF-7
 tumor
 xenografts
 with
 dusquetide
 showed
no
 increase
 in
 tumor
 growth
 or
 worsening
 of
 survival
 and
 a
 trend
towards
 decreased
 tumor
 growth
 and
 improvement
 in
 survival
with
 radiation.
 Treatment
 with
 dusquetide
 did
 not
 interfere
 with
radiation
 or
 chemotherapy
 (i.e.,
 paclitaxel)
 treatment
 of
 MCF-7
tumor
 growth.
 Indeed,
 a
 trend
 towards
 an
 additive
 suppression
 of
tumor
 growth
 was
 observed
 (Fig.
 2).
3.2.
 Phase
 2a
 clinical
 study
3.2.1.
 Patients
A  total
 of
 111
 patients
 were
 enrolled
 between
 December
 2013
and
 August
 2015
 at
 21
 sites
 (Fig.
 3).
 Five
 patients
 in
 each
 of
the
 placebo,
 1.5
 mg/kg
 dusquetide,
 and
 6.0
 mg/kg
 dusquetide
 dose
groups
 did
 not
 receive
 a
 cumulative
 dose
 of
 at
 least
 55
 Gy
 of
 radi-
ation
 to
 the
 oral
 cavity
 or
 oropharynx
 and
 were
 not
 evaluable
 (i.e.,
were
 not
 a
 part
 of
 the
 modified
 Intent
 to
 Treat
 population)
 (Fig.
 3).
Of
 the
 96
 evaluable
 patients,
 the
 median
 age
 was
 58.5
 years,
 81%
were
 men,
 34%
 had
 oral
 cavity
 and
 66%
 had
 oropharyngeal
 tumors,
76%
 had
 Stage
 IVA
 disease,
 53%
 had
 tumors
 that
 were
 human
 papil-
loma
 virus
 (HPV)
 positive
 based
 on
 p16
 immunostaining,
 and
 28%
received
 surgery.
 The
 treatment
 groups
 were
 well
 balanced
 with
respect
 to
 their
 baseline
 characteristics
 (Table
 1).
3.2.2.
 Safety
The
 rates
 and
 types
 of
 reported
 AEs,
 serious
 AEs,
 changes
 in
vital
 signs,
 and
 laboratory
 abnormalities
 were
 similar
 across
 dose
groups.
 Specific
 assessment
 of
 treatment-emergent
 AEs
 suggested
a
 potential
 shift
 in
 some
 hematology
 endpoints
 (e.g.,
 white
 blood
cell
 counts,
 anemia)
 (Table
 2).
 To
 test
 if
 this
 expected,
 unavoid-
able
 side
 effect
 of
 aggressive
 CRT
 was
 being
 differentially
 reported
by
 different
 sites
 (ascertainment
 bias),
 the
 lowest
 white
 blood
 cell
count
 for
 each
 patient
 was
 identified
 and
 this
 nadir
 value
 plotted
for
 each
 dose
 group.
 The
 resulting
 plot
 shows
 similar
 distributions
of
 nadir
 white
 blood
 cell
 counts
 in
 the
 dose
 groups
 (Fig.
 4a).
 This
suggests
 that
 the
 discrepancies
 between
 dose
 groups
 reported
 as
having
 “white
 blood
 cell
 disorder”
 AEs
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 incon-
sistency
 between
 site
 and/or
 physician
 reporting
 and
 not
 an
 actual
concern.
Another
 numeric
 difference
 is
 seen
 in
 patients
 with
 reported
anemia.
 The
 nadir
 measurements
 for
 anemia
 are
 shown
 in
Fig.
 4b,c,d,
 also
 indicating
 no
 association
 with
 anemia
 and
 dusque-
tide
 (SGX942)
 dosing.
3.2.3.
 Efficacy
Patients
 receiving
 1.5
 mg/kg
 of
 dusquetide
 had
 a
 50%
 reduction
in
 their
 median
 duration
 of
 SOM
 compared
 to
 the
 placebo
 group
(18
 versus
 9
 days
 for
 the
 placebo
 and
 dusquetide
 groups,
 respec-
tively;
 Fig.
 5a).
 This
 finding
 was
 supported
 by
 a
 39%
 reduction
 in
 the
median
 AUC
 for
 the
 WHO
 Grade-time
 calculation
 (35.5
 versus
 21.8
score-days
 for
 the
 placebo
 and
 dusquetide
 groups,
 respectively),
 a
71%
 reduction
 in
 the
 rate
 of
 SOM
 through
 1-month
 after
 completion
of
 treatment
 (from
 21%
 in
 the
 placebo
 group
 to
 5%
 in
 the
 dusquetide
group)
 and
 a
 7%
 relative
 reduction
 in
 the
 incidence
 of
 SOM
 when
compared
 to
 placebo
 (from
 74%
 in
 the
 placebo
 group
 to
 69%
 in
 the
dusquetide
 group;
 Supplemental
 Table
 1).
 In
 the
 6.0
 mg/kg
 group,
the
 results
 were
 inconsistent
 across
 outcomes
 (Supplemental
 Table
1).
Several
 subpopulations
 of
 patients
 were
 prospectively
 identi-
fied
 for
 further
 analyses.
 The
 duration
 of
 SOM
 of
 placebo-treated
patients
 was
 greater
 among
 individuals
 treated
 with
 cisplatin
 every
third
 week
 (80–100
 mg/m2;
 30
 days)
 compared
 to
 placebo-treated
patients
 treated
 with
 weekly
 cisplatin
 (30–40
 mg/m2;
 10
 days).
 In
those
 patients
 receiving
 cisplatin
 every
 third
 week,
 there
 was
 a
 67%
decrease
 in
 the
 median
 duration
 of
 SOM
 (i.e.,
 from
 30
 to
 10
 days
 in
the
 placebo
 and
 dusquetide
 1.5
 mg/kg
 dose
 groups,
 respectively;
Fig.
 5b),
 which
 was
 associated
 with
 a
 51%
 reduction
 in
 the
 median
AUC
 WHO
 Grade-time
 calculation,
 and
 an
 18%
 relative
 reduction
 in
incidence
 of
 severe
 OM
 compared
 to
 placebo
 (Supplemental
 Table
1).
 Among
 patients
 receiving
 weekly
 30–40
 mg/m2 cisplatin,
 the
median
 duration
 of
 SOM
 was
 decreased
 50%
 from
 10
 days
 in
 the
placebo
 group
 to
 5
 days
 in
 the
 1.5
 mg/kg
 dusquetide
 group,
 which
was
 associated
 with
 a
 55%
 reduction
 in
 the
 median
 AUC
 WHO
Grade-time
 calculation.
Improvements
 in
 UOM
 (WHO
 grade
 ≥2)
 seen
 in
 the
 1.5
 mg/kg
dusquetide
 dose
 group
 were
 similar
 to
 those
 for
 SOM
 but
 the
 mag-
nitude
 of
 the
 observed
 trends
 was
 less.
 The
 median
 duration
 was
decreased
 by
 12%
 and
 the
 median

was
 decreased
 by

 Discussion
Dusquetide
 consistently
 reduced
 the
 duration
 of
 OM
 by
 approxi-
mately
 50%
 in
 2
 key
 preclinical
 index
 models
 of
 mucositis
 (Fig.
 1a,b).
Efficacy
 was
 independent
 of
 the
 triggering
 event
 causing
 the
 OM
(i.e.,
 radiation,
 chemotherapy),
 consistent
 with
 the
 hypothesis
 that
the
 pathogenesis
 of
 mucositis
 is
 tied
 to
 the
 response
 of
 the
 innate
immune
 system
 to
 the
 damage
 rather
 than
 the
 underlying
 cause
 of
damage
 directly
 (Fig.
 1c).
 Similarly,
 efficacy
 was
 also
 observed
 in
both
 the
 oral
 cavity
 and
 the
 lower
 GI
 tract,
 again
 consistent
 with
the
 presumption
 that
 oral
 and
 GI
 mucositis
 are
 driven
 by
 similar
mechanisms
 in
 different
 locations
 (Keefe,
 2007).
 In
 another
 model
of
 chemotherapy-induced
 colitis,
 dusquetide
 was
 similarly
 dosed
every
 third
 day
 and
 again
 found
 to
 mitigate
 damage,
 whether
 initi-
ated
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 during
 or
 after
 the
 DSS
 (Fig.
 1d).
 In
 this
 model,
efficacy
 was
 linked
 to
 administering
 at
 least
 2
 doses
 of
 dusquetide.
Even
 in
 the
 context
 of
 continuing
 damage
 (e.g.,
 fractionated
 radia-
tion,
 DSS-induced
 colitis),
 dusquetide
 treatment
 was
 shown
 to
 be
effective
 (Fig.
 1a,c).
Previous
 studies
 in
 rodent
 infection
 models
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016)
have
 identified
 a
 dose
 level
 between
 25
 and
 50
 mg/kg
 (correspond-
ing
 to
 a
 human
 equivalent
 dose
 between
 2
 and
 4
 mg/kg)
 every
second
 or
 third
 day
 as
 optimal.
 Doses
 higher
 than
 50
 mg/kg
 were
not
 tested
 in
 mouse
 efficacy
 studies
 due
 to
 dosing
 limitations
 in
 the
mouse.
 Similar
 results
 were
 observed
 in
 these
 studies,
 where
 dos-
ing
 every
 second
 or
 third
 day
 was
 superior
 to
 daily
 dosing
 (Fig.
 1a).
In
 each
 case,
 dusquetide
 was
 efficacious
 when
 administered
 after
the
 damaging
 stimulus
 was
 applied
 (e.g.,
 after
 irradiation
 (Fig.
 1a)
or
 chemotherapy
 (Fig.
 1b,c,d)).
 This
 treatment
 modality
 was
 chosen
as
 a
 mimic
 of
 the
 most
 clinically
 convenient
 treatment
 course.

 higher

 (North

 In

 lev-
els
 of
 3,
 30
 and
 240
 mg/kg,
 the
 responses
 of
 the
 anti-inflammatory
IL-1ra
 levels
 were
 found
 to
 be
 highest
 at
 3
 and
 30
 mg/kg
 (corre-
sponding
 to
 a
 human
 equivalent
 dose
 of
 1–10
 mg/kg)
 (North
 et
 al.,
2016).
 Similarly,
 in
 a
 Phase
 1
 clinical
 study,
 anti-inflammatory
responses
 were
 highest
 after
 administration
 of
 dose
 levels
 between
0.15
 and
 2.0
 mg/kg,
 while
 individuals
 receiving
 doses
 between
3.0
 and
 8.0
 mg/kg
 were
 indistinguishable
 from
 the
 placebo
 group
(North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 These
 data
 in
 aggregate
 clearly
 suggest
 that
the
 adage
 “more
 is
 better”
 does
 not
 hold
 for
 this
 immune
 regulator.
Hormetic,
 or
 non-monotonic,
 dose
 response
 curves
 are
 well
 known
in
 immune
 biology,
 generally
 arising
 due
 to
 a
 balance
 of
 competing
pathways
 (Liu
 2003;
 Pearce
 et
 al.,
 2014).

Given
 the
 potential
 role
 of
 dusquetide
 in
 immune
 biol-
ogy,
 including
 impacting
 the
 microenvironment
 of
 the
 tumor,
 a
xenograft
 study
 was
 conducted
 with
 a
 tumor
 cell
 line
 most
 likely
to
 be
 sensitive
 to
 p62
 (target
 protein)
 modulation.
 No
 degradation
of
 tumor
 control
 by
 chemotherapy
 or
 radiotherapy
 was
 observed,
and
 there
 was
 a
 trend
 towards
 increased
 tumor
 suppression
 (Fig.
 4).
This
 finding
 is
 not
 unexpected,
 given
 the
 role
 of
 p62
 in
 the
 tumor
microenvironment,
 such
 as
 in
 the
 context
 of
 multiple
 myeloma
(Hiruma
 et
 al.,
 2009).
Based
 on
 these
 findings,
 doses
 for
 the
 Phase
 2a
 clinical
 study
were
 selected
 to
 represent
 the
 2
 “profiles”
 observed
 in
 the
 Phase
 1
study
 –
 one
 dose
 representing
 the
 “low
 dose”
 in
 the
 Phase
 1
 study
(1.5
 mg/kg
 representing
 the
 low
 dose
 range
 of
 0.15–2.0
 mg/kg)
and
 one
 representing
 the
 “high
 dose”
 (6.0
 mg/kg
 representing
 the
high
 dose
 range
 of
 3.0–8.0
 mg/kg).
 While
 both
 doses
 were
 tested,
efficacy
 was
 anticipated
 at
 the
 low
 dose
 (1.5
 mg/kg)
 due
 to
 the
 anti-
inflammatory
 activity
 observed
 in
 the
 Phase
 1
 study
 and
 the
 efficacy
observed
 in
 preclinical
 studies
 around
 this
 dose
 level
 (25–50
 mg/kg
in
 a
 mouse
 corresponds
 to
 1.5–4
 mg/kg
 in
 a
 human).
Upon
 discussion
 with
 FDA,
 an
 interim
 dose
 was
 recommended,
allowing
 for
 a
 more
 gradual
 dose
 escalation.
 As
 the
 3.0
 mg/kg
 dose
level
 was
 introduced
 for
 safety
 reasons,
 no
 efficacy
 analysis
 of
 this
group
 was
 planned
 given
 the
 limited
 number
 of
 subjects
 incor-
porated
 (3
 placebo,
 3
 dusquetide
 subjects
 only
 were
 included
 in
this
 cohort).
 Provision
 was
 included
 in
 this
 Phase

 hypothesis-
generating
 study
 for
 an
 independent
 DRC
 review
 of
 patient
 data
prior
 to
 dose
 escalation
 (from
 1.5
 to
 3.0
 mg/kg,
 from
 3.0
 to
 6.0
 mg/kg
and
 prior
 to
 proceeding
 with
 additional
 enrollment
 at
 6.0
 mg/kg),
as
 well
 as
 an
 interim
 review
 whereupon
 additional
 subjects
 could
be
 recommended
 to
 be
 enrolled.
Consistent
 with
 the
 Phase
 1
 study,
 no
 treatment-emergent
changes
 in
 vital
 signs,
 laboratory
 values,
 AEs
 or
 serious
 AEs
 were
found
 to
 be
 attributed
 to
 dusquetide
 treatment.
 In
 this
 population,
dusquetide
 (SGX942)
 appears
 to
 be
 safe
 and
 well
 tolerated.
In
 the
 present
 study,
 the

74%,
 the
 early
 discontinuation
 of

 5a,b).
The
 results
 in
 the
 6.0
 mg/kg
 dusquetide
 dose
 group
 compared
 to
the
 placebo
 group
 are
 inconsistent
 across
 the
 various
 measures
 of
SOM
 and
 across
 the
 various
 subpopulations
 (Fig.
 5a,b;
 Supplemen-
tal
 Table
 1),
 suggesting
 that
 it
 is
 not
 as
 effective
 in
 ameliorating
OM
 as
 the
 1.5
 mg/kg
 dusquetide
 dose;
 however,
 the
 limited
 sam-
ple
 size
 in
 the
 6.0
 mg/kg
 group
 makes
 any
 conclusions
 uncertain.
Decreased
 effectiveness
 at
 the
 6.0
 mg/kg
 dose
 level
 would
 be
 con-
sistent
 with
 findings
 in
 the
 Phase
 1
 study
 with
 dusquetide,
 where
anti-inflammatory
 activity
 was
 more
 prevalent
 at
 the
 lower
 dose
level
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
The
 50%
 reduction
 in
 the
 duration
 of
 SOM
 in
 patients
 treated
with
 dusquetide
 (Fig.
 5a,b)
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 preclinical
 studies
in
 both
 chemotherapy
 and
 radiation-induced
 oral
 and
 GI
 mucositis
in
 which
 dusquetide
 reduced
 the
 peak
 intensity
 and
 duration
 of
mucositis
 by
 approximately
 50%
 in
 the
 duration
 of
 SOM
 (Fig.
 1a,b).
Extensive
 studies
 have
 been
 conducted
 with
 dusquetide
 in
 var-
ious
 preclinical
 models
 of
 bacterial
 infection
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
Because
 dusquetide
 affects
 the
 host
 response
 rather
 than
 being
directed
 at
 the
 bacteria,
 this
 drug
 has
 an
 effect
 on
 infections
 caused
by
 gram-negative
 and
 gram-positive
 bacteria
 as
 well
 infections
related
 to
 multiple
 resistant
 organisms.
 Dusquetide
 is
 an
 effective
agent
 both
 prophylactically
 and
 therapeutically
 (North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
Our
 finding
 that
 the
 treated
 groups
 had
 fewer
 bacterial
 infections
(Fig.
 5c,
 Supplemental
 Table
 2)
 is
 very
 consistent
 with
 preclinical
animal
 models.
 Similarly,
 the
 potential
 reduction
 in
 tumor
 volume
observed
 in
 preclinical
 studies
 (Fig.
 4)
 was
 echoed
 in
 the
 increased
rate
 of
 “complete
 resolution”
 tumor
 status
 at
 the
 1-month
 follow-
up
 visit
 in
 the
 Phase
 2a
 study
 (Fig.
 5d,
 Supplemental
 Table
 3).
The
 treatment
 of
 OM
 has
 been
 fraught
 with
 many
 clinical
 fail-
ures,
 beginning
 with
 treatments
 targeted
 at
 infected
 ulcers
 (e.g.,
antibiotic
 mouthwashes).
 Further
 studies,
 including
 the
 use
 of
DNA
 and
 RNA
 biomarkers
 (Sonis
 et
 al.,
 2002),
 have
 demonstrated
that
 OM
 is
 an
 inherently
 inflammatory
 condition
 related
 to
 the
activation
 of
 the
 innate
 immune
 system
 in
 response
 to
 the
 dam-
age
 caused
 by
 CRT.
 Under
 this
 hypothesis,
 treatments
 modulating
the
 innate
 immune
 response
 have
 been
 suggested
 as
 an
 alterna-
tive
 approach.
 IDRs
 such
 as
 dusquetide
 address
 all
 phases
 of
 OM,
decreasing
 the
 initial
 inflammatory
 response
 to
 damage,
 mitigat-
ing
 the
 inflammatory
 amplification
 phase,
 providing
 anti-infective
activity
 during
 the
 ulcerative
 phase
 and
 potentially
 aiding
 in
 tis-
sue
 healing
 through
 the
 recruitment
 of
 macrophages
 (Scott
 et
 al.,
2007;
 North
 et
 al.,
 2016).
 This
 exploratory
 Phase
 2a
 study
 has
 fur-
ther
 validated
 the
 underlying
 hypothesis
 regarding
 innate
 immune
contribution
 to
 OM
 pathogenesis
 and
 has
 demonstrated
 that
 treat-
ment
 with
 an
 IDR
 has
 the
 potential
 to
 not
 only
 reduce
 the
 impact
 124
 
M.

 115–125
of
 OM,
 but
 also
 to
 provide
 ancillary
 benefits
 of
 reducing
 infections
and
 potentially
 aiding
 in
 the
 treatment
 of
 the
 underlying
 tumor.
The
 highly
 conserved
 nature
 of
 the
 innate
 immune
 system
 sug-
gests
 that
 animal
 models
 should
 provide
 realistic
 models
 of
 the
human
 clinical
 condition.
 Nonetheless,
 dusquetide
 has
 a
 unique
mechanism
 of
 action,
 heretofore
 untested
 in
 the
 human
 setting.
These
 preclinical
 and
 clinical
 studies
 have
 indicated
 that
 all
 of
 the
biological
 functions
 observed
 in
 the
 preclinical
 setting
 were
 trans-
ferred
 to
 the
 clinical
 setting,
 including
 reduction
 in
 duration
 of
 OM
and
 reduction
 in
 infection.
 These
 findings
 provide
 biological
 proof
of
 concept
 for
 the
 IDR
 platform
 and
 indicate
 that
 other
 preclinical
IDR
 activity
 is
 more
 likely
 to
 translate
 to
 the
 clinical
 setting.
In
 conclusion,
 dusquetide
 was
 shown
 to
 be
 effective,
 reducing
the
 duration
 of
 SOM
 in
 head
 and
 neck
 cancer
 patients,
 and
 safe
 and
well
 tolerated
 in
 an
 exploratory
 Phase
 2a
 study.
 The
 results
 of
 this
clinical
 study
 were
 consistent
 with
 preclinical
 findings,
 including
reduction
 in
 OM,
 reduction
 in
 acute
 inflammation
 and
 reduction
 in
the
 incidence
 of
 infection.
