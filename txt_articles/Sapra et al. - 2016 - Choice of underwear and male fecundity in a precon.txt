SUMMARY
Our objective was to investigate the relationship between male underwear-type worn during daytime/bedtime and male fecundity
as measured by semen quality and time-to-pregnancy. We used data from a prospective preconception cohort conducted in 16
counties in Michigan and Texas, USA. 501 couples were enrolled and followed for 12 months of trying, which facilitated capture of
time-to-pregnancy (in cycles), 6-cycle conception delay, and 12-month infertility. Male partners provided semen samples via in-
home collection for next-day semen analysis comprised of 35 semen quality endpoints. At enrollment, men provided information on
type of underwear worn during daytime and bedtime and were classified into 6 categories by underwear choice (n = 491): (i) briefs
day/night, (ii) boxer-briefs day/night, (iii) boxers day/night, (iv) briefs day and boxers/none at night, (v) boxer-briefs day and boxers/
none at night, (vi) boxers day and none at night. 473 (96%) men had semen analysis performed. Men switching from their usual day-
time underwear to boxers/none for bed (groups 4, 5, 6) had the most evidence of change in semen quality endpoints (10 of 11 differ-
ences) relative to men wearing briefs day/night (group 1). Group 4 men had lower percent of sperm with coiled tail (b = �0.18, 95%
CI: �0.35, �0.01), higher percent round (b = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.42), number of immature sperm (b = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.77),
and amplitude head displacement (b = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.10, 1.03). Group 5 men had higher sperm head perimeter (b=0.17, 95% CI:
0.002, 0.34), amplitude head displacement (b = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.91), percent cytoplasmic droplet (b = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.77)
and high DNA stainability (b=0.39, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.78). After false discovery rate control, no differences remained significant. No
significant differences in time-to-pregnancy, conception delay, or infertility were observed. In summary, male underwear choice is
associated with few differences in semen parameters; no association with time-to-pregnancy is observed providing reassurance to
couples attempting pregnancy.
INTRODUCTION
Couples planning or trying for pregnancy are eager for
information on lifestyles that may increase their chances for
success. Recognizing that both partners contribute to success-
ful pregnancy attempts, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention now offers preconception guidance for both men
and women, inclusive of quitting smoking, avoiding the use of
alcohol and drugs, and maintaining a healthy weight (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015a and 2015b). The
American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the
United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) also encourage these healthy habits for cou-
ples attempting pregnancy (American Society for Reproductive
Medicine, 2012; United Kingdom National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, 2013). As both ASRM and NICE’s guid-
ance notes that elevated scrotal temperature is associated with
decreased semen quality, a question commonly asked of clini-
cians by couples attempting pregnancy is about the male
partner’s choice of underwear to maximize conception proba-
bilities. However, it remains unclear whether wearing loose
underwear, which may lead to lower scrotal temperatures,
affects fecundity.
Several observational studies have been conducted on the
association of loose versus tight underwear and semen quality
among men seeking infertility evaluations (Oldereid et al., 1991;
Parazzini et al., 1995; Munkelwitz & Gilbert, 1998; Jung et al.,

 2001; Povey et al., 2012; Jurewicz et al., 2013, 2014; Pacey et al.,
2014). Some studies report better semen quality parameters in
men wearing loose compared with tight underwear (Parazzini
et al., 1995; Jung et al., 2001; Povey et al., 2012; Jurewicz et al.,
2013, 2014), though others have shown no association (Oldereid
et al., 1991; Munkelwitz & Gilbert, 1998; Pacey et al., 2014). A
few intervention studies have been conducted among fertile
men comparing semen quality before and after the use of an
underwear-type device to hold the testes close to (Shafik, 1992;
Wang et al., 1997; Ahmad et al., 2012) or even inside (Mieusset &
B’ujan, 1994) the body for reversible contraception. Most studies
(Shafik, 1992; Mieusset & B’ujan, 1994; Ahmad et al., 2012),
though not all (Wang et al., 1997), report reduced semen quality
parameters along with higher scrotal temperature during com-
pared with before use of the device, with one study reporting
complete azoospermia after several months of use (Shafik, 1992)
and another reporting higher high DNA stainability (HDS) and
DNA fragmentation index (Ahmad et al., 2012). Other studies
have randomized men to wear boxers and then briefs or vice
versa for several months with an observed benefit for loose
underwear relative to semen quality parameters. However, these
data are difficult to interpret as, in total, only 11 men completed
these two studies (Sanger & Friman, 1990; Tiemessen et al.,
1996).
A distinct data gap is present regarding male choice of under-
wear type and semen quality among men in couples attempting
pregnancy in the general population and also whether switching
to looser underwear or none for bed impacts semen quality
parameters. Furthermore, no data are available on male under-
wear type and time-to-pregnancy, conception delay or incident
infertility. Using data from a population-based, preconception
cohort of couples attempting pregnancy, we are able to empiri-
cally assess these knowledge gaps for the first time known to us.
Specifically, we assessed the relationship between men’s behav-
ior related to underwear choice for daytime and bedtime and
male fecundity measured by semen quality parameters, time-to-
pregnancy, conception delay, and infertility; we did not measure
scrotal temperature directly.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study population
In this study, 501 couples from 16 counties in Michigan and
Texas (2005–2009) were recruited upon discontinuation of con-
traception into the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the
Environment (LIFE) Study, a population-based preconception
cohort of couples attempting pregnancy [described in detail
elsewhere (Louis et al., 2011)]. Couples were followed daily until
positive home pregnancy test or 12 months of trying; couples
who became pregnant during the study were then followed
through pregnancy loss or delivery.
The study aimed to be inclusive of the spectrum of couples
attempting pregnancy and only excluded couples in which one
or both partners reported clinically diagnosed infertility/sterility.
The following constituted inclusion criteria: (i) in a committed
relationship, (ii) ability to communicate in English or Spanish,
(iii) male partner aged 18-years or older, (iv) female partner aged
18–40-years-old, (v) no use of injectable contraceptives in the
past year, and (vi) menstrual cycle length 21–42 days. At enroll-
ment, all women were administered a home pregnancy test to
ensure that women were not pregnant so that trying time could
be prospectively observed.
Exposure data collection
At enrollment, men completed in-person interviews with
research assistants that included two separate questions on the
usual type of underwear worn during the daytime and to bed.
Men could respond none, briefs, boxer-briefs, boxers, or other.
The replies of ‘other’ (n = 23, 5%) were followed by a free text
response that was hand coded to one of the four alternate cate-
gories. Most ‘other’ replies were ‘bikini’, which was coded as
‘briefs’, or ‘pajama bottoms’ or ‘pajama shorts’, which was
coded as none as we did not ask men about other clothing worn
to bed. As men were not queried about their underwear choice
at any other time point during the study, we assumed their
choices did not change over the course of study.
For this analysis, we were interested not only in the type of
underwear worn during the day but also whether men chan-
ged their underwear for bed. We assumed the primary manner
in which underwear may affect semen quality is through ele-
vated scrotal temperatures based on prior literature (Brindley,
1982; Jung et al., 2005). Six groups were defined to capture
the type of underwear and consistency of use from day to
bedtime: (i) briefs during the daytime and bedtime, (ii) boxer-
briefs during the daytime and bedtime, (iii) boxers during the
daytime and bedtime, (iv) briefs during daytime and boxers/
none at bedtime, (v) boxer-briefs during daytime and boxers/
none at bedtime, (vi) boxers during daytime and none at bed-
time. Men who wore none during the day (n = 9) or higher
exposure at night (n = 1) were excluded as we were primarily
interested in the type of underwear worn during the day and
whether they maintained this choice for bedtime or switched
to looser and presumably cooler underwear for bed. Here 491
(98%) men remained for the analysis. No further exclusions
were made.
We collected other information during the interview regarding
sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, urologic and
reproductive history, and other heat exposures. Sociodemo-
graphic characteristics included age, race/ethnicity, household
income, and self-reported current cigarette smoking and past
year alcohol use frequency. Height and weight were measured
by study personnel to calculate body mass index (BMI). Urologic
history
included
data
on
any
clinical
diagnosis
of
cryp-
torchidism, hypospadias, or varicocele (any urologic problem)
and whether surgery had been performed for these conditions
(any urologic surgery). Reproductive history included ever
fathering a pregnancy and any conception delay (time-to-preg-
nancy >6 months) in a past planned pregnancy. Heat exposures
queried were hot tub/sauna use frequency in the past year,
extreme heat at work (work environment warmer than 100°F),
prolonged sitting at work (working in sedentary position for >6 h
daily), and season of enrollment (based on month). We also
included average high seasonal temperature at enrollment,
which was a combination both of the month of enrollment as
well as the site (Michigan or Texas) in recognition that the sea-
sonal temperature in Michigan in January is much lower than in
Texas and July in Texas is hotter than in Michigan (Weather
Underground; Weather Underground). We also assessed female
factors that may influence male underwear choice including age,
race/ethnicity, education, BMI, current cigarette smoking and

 past year alcohol use frequency as these factors also may be
important for time-to-pregnancy.
Semen collection and analysis
At enrollment and 1 month later, men were asked to give a
semen sample for analysis. Samples were collected by men by
masturbation without lubricants following a recommended 2-
day period of abstinence. Men were supplied with a glass jar in
which to collect the sample. The jar was equipped with a glass
sperm migration straw (Vitrotubes #3520; VitroCom Inc., Mt.
Lakes, NJ, USA) so that sperm distance traveled at time of collec-
tion could be read the next day. Straw distance is used as a glo-
bal measure of motility to ensure motile sperm were present at
the time of semen collection. The jar was also equipped with a
temperature sensor (I-Button; Maxim Integrated, Jan Jose, CA,
USA) to ensure the sample was maintained within acceptable
temperature range from collection until analysis; all samples
were found to be within quality assurance and control standards.
Men mailed the sample in an insulated shipping container
designed to preserve sperm integrity (Hamilton Research) via
overnight shipping for next-day semen analysis. The semen
analysis comprised 35 endpoints, including 5 general character-
istics (volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, straw
distance, percent hypo-osmotic swollen), 8 motility measures,
12 morphometry measures, 8 morphology measures, and 2
sperm chromatin stability assay (SCSA) measures.
Upon arrival at the andrology laboratory at the National Insti-
tute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an aliquot of
semen was placed in a 20-lm deep chamber slide (Leja), and
sperm motility was assessed using the HTM-IVOS (Hamilton
Thorne, Beverly, MA, USA) computer-assisted semen analysis
system. Sperm concentration was measured using the IVOS sys-
tem and the IDENT stain (Zinaman et al., 1996), and sperm via-
bility assessed using the hypo-osmotic swelling assay (Jeyendran
et al., 1984). An aliquot of the whole semen was diluted in tris
NaCl EDTA (TNE) buffer with glycerol and frozen for the SCSA
analysis (Evenson et al., 2002). The SCSA procedure was con-
ducted on a Coulter Epics Elite Flow Cytometer using the SCSA
program (SCSA diagnostics, Brookings, SD, USA). Slides were
prepared for sperm morphometry and morphology. Sperm mor-
phometry was performed using the IVOS METRIX system at the
NIOSH laboratory. Sperm morphology assessment was com-
pleted by Fertility Solutions, Inc. (Cleveland, OH, USA). Both lab-
oratories had established quality assurance and quality control
procedures in place.
In this study, 473 (96%) men provided one and 378 (80%) men
provided two semen samples for analysis. The second sample
only measured volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count,
hypo-osmotic swollen, next-day motility, and sperm head mor-
phology, with the primary goal of affirming azoospermia in the
first sample and in light of budgetary constraints. Five men were
azoospermic on both samples and were informed so they could
seek medical care. These men are included in the analysis for
volume, count, and concentration.
Fecundity measures
Time-to-pregnancy was measured in prospectively observed
menstrual cycles, which were constructed using a combination
of bleeding recorded by women in daily journals and the press of
the ‘m’ button on digital fertility monitors (Louis et al., 2012).
Any time off contraception prior to enrollment [one (12%) or
two (18%) months] was added to the prospectively observed
cycles. This approach does assume that months are equivalent
to menstrual cycles; the median cycle length in the LIFE Study
was 30 days. Conception delay and infertility were defined as 6
prospectively measured cycles or 12 months without pregnancy,
respectively. To our knowledge, no couples sought clinical evalu-
ation or care during the study. At study entry, couples were told
that at the end of 12 months, if they had not achieved preg-
nancy, they would be provided with summary information from
their digital fertility monitors and daily diaries to share with their
physicians should they decide to seek medical care.
Statistical analysis
A key challenge is in evaluating whether other exposures or
characteristics are indeed associated with both the type of
underwear and semen quality or time-to-pregnancy; hence,
meeting the criteria for confounding. Unfortunately, there are
few data known to us on this topic and previous research has
not differentiated between underwear worn during the day and
night; thus, we used statistical testing of our data to guide our
selection of covariates for the adjusted models of semen quality
endpoints and time-to-pregnancy. We had an a priori hypothesis
that these covariates would be associated with semen quality
endpoints and time-to-pregnancy and would not lie on the path-
way between male underwear and any of the outcomes. We used
chi-square test for categorical and Kruskal–Wallis tests for con-
tinuous variables to determine significance at a two-sided p-
value <0.05. Those covariates that were significantly different
across patterns of underwear use were retained in multivariable
models.
Owing to non-normal distributions, semen quality endpoints
were Box-Cox transformed prior to modeling (Handelsman,
2002; Louis et al., 2015). If men provided two semen samples,
data from both samples were used to model semen quality end-
points. Specifically, linear mixed models were used for semen
quality endpoints with a random effect for subject included to
account for the correlation between two semen samples for the
same man. Beta coefficients (b) and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were estimated for patterns of underwear use relative
to wearing briefs during daytime/bedtime (referent) with nega-
tive values indicating a decrease and positive values indicating
an increase change in the unit for each semen endpoint. Models
were adjusted for seasonal temperature at enrollment (<60°F,
60–84°F, ≥85°F), race/ethnicity, and past year alcohol use fre-
quency (none, less than weekly, weekly or more), which were the
only characteristics significantly different by male underwear
choice, hence meeting criteria for confounding. Three men were
missing data on race/ethnicity and were not included in the
adjusted models. Given the large number of comparison in our
modeling of semen quality endpoints, we applied the Benjamini
and Hochberg method to control for the false discovery rate
(Glickman et al., 2014).
Discrete time Cox proportional hazards models were used to
estimate fecundability odds ratios (FOR) and 95% CI accounting
for right-censoring (loss to follow-up or end of study) and left
truncation (time off contraception before study entry), using the
delayed entry option in PROC PHREG in SAS V9.3. The FOR is
the relative odds of achieving pregnancy in a given cycle condi-
tional on not achieving pregnancy in the prior cycle for the

 exposed compared with reference group. An FOR <1 indicates a
longer time-to-pregnancy or reduced fecundity for the exposed
group. These models were adjusted for seasonal temperature at
enrollment (<60°F, 60–84°F, ≥85°F), race/ethnicity, and past year
alcohol use frequency (none, less than weekly, weekly or more).
We checked the proportionality assumption of the Cox model,
and it was upheld. Generalized regression models with a log link
and Poisson distribution were used to estimate risk ratios (RR)
and 95% CI and generalized regression models with an identity
link and Poisson distribution to estimate risk differences (RD)
and 95% CI for conception delay and 12-month infertility where
an RR >1 or RD >0 indicates greater risk or excess cases, respec-
tively, of conception delay or infertility among the exposed
group (Spiegelman & Hertzmark, 2005). These models were sim-
ilarly adjusted for seasonal temperature at enrollment (<60°F,
60–84°F, ≥85°F), race/ethnicity, and past year alcohol use fre-
quency (none, less than weekly, weekly or more).
Ethical approval
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from all
participating institutions, and all participants provided written
informed consent prior to data collection.
RESULTS
During daytime, boxer-briefs were the most common under-
wear choice (39%) closely followed by boxers (35%) then briefs
(26%) (Table 1). However, during bedtime, boxers became the
predominant underwear (43%) followed by boxer-briefs (24%),
none (20%), then briefs (13%). This is largely because men wear-
ing boxers during the day maintain them at night (83%) and
more men wearing briefs and boxer-briefs during daytime
switched to boxers at bedtime (26 and 17%, respectively).
Regardless of daytime underwear choice, one-third of men
changed to a cooler option for bedtime.
Of the many sociodemographic/lifestyle characteristics, uro-
logic and reproductive history, and various heat exposures we
assessed across patterns of underwear use, only three were sta-
tistically significant: race/ethnicity, past year frequency of alco-
hol use, and average high seasonal temperature at enrollment
(Table 2). Of note, none of the female characteristics were asso-
ciated with male underwear choice (data not shown).
The description of semen quality for the overall cohort has
been previously published (Louis et al., 2014). In linear mixed
models adjusted for race/ethnicity, past year alcohol use fre-
quency, and average high seasonal temperature at enrollment,
compared with briefs during daytime/bedtime, 11 differences
in semen quality endpoints were noted across the other 5
patterns (Table 3). Of note, 10 of 11 differences occurred in
men who switched to boxers or none for bed, particularly for
sperm head morphometry (3 endpoints) and morphology (4
endpoints),
though
fewer
parameters
were
suggestive
of
improved (2 endpoints) than diminished (4 endpoints) semen
quality endpoints.
Specifically, across daytime underwear choice, no differences
were observed for men wearing boxers compared with briefs
during the day and to bed, and only an increase in amplitude
head displacement (b = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.92) was noted for
boxer-briefs compared with briefs during the day and to bed.
Compared with men wearing briefs during the day and to bed,
men wearing briefs during the day and boxers/none to bed had
four differences, including lower percent coiled tail (b = �0.18,
95% CI: �0.35, �0.01), suggestive of improved semen quality;
higher percent round (b=0.22, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.42) and number
immature (b = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.77), both suggestive of lower
semen
quality;
and
higher
amplitude
head
displacement
(b = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.10, 1.03). Men wearing boxer-briefs during
the day and boxers/none to bed had four differences observed,
including higher percent cytoplasmic droplet (b = 0.39, 95% CI:
0.01, 0.78) and HDS (b = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.44), both sugges-
tive of lower semen quality, as well as increases in amplitude
head displacement (b = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.91) and sperm head
perimeter (b = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.002, 0.34), whose clinical correla-
tions are less certain. Men wearing boxers during the day and
none to bed had two differences observed, including higher
acrosome area of head (b = 2.22, 95% CI: 0.02, 4.42), suggestive
of improved semen quality, and higher sperm head width
(b = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.16). After controlling for the false dis-
covery
rate,
none
of
the
observed
differences
remained
significant.
Median time-to-pregnancy in this sample was four cycles (in-
terquartile range: 2, 7). Incidence of conception delay and infer-
tility were 27 and 11%, respectively. No significant differences in
time-to-pregnancy,
conception
delay,
or
infertility
were
observed by pattern of male underwear use (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this preconception cohort of couples recruited from the
general population, differences in specific semen quality end-
points were observed for some patterns of male underwear use.
While minimal differences in semen parameters were identified
based on daytime underwear type, most differences were seen
when men changed their underwear type at bedtime to a cooler
option. However, the findings were not all suggestive of
improved semen quality endpoints as one might expect under
the scrotal heat hypothesis for underwear. Most differences
occurred in sperm head morphometry and sperm morphology:
increase acrosome area of head and lower percent coiled tail
both suggest improved semen quality whereas increases in per-
cent round and cytoplasmic droplet and number immature are
suggestive of diminished semen quality; increases in sperm head
perimeter and width were also noted though their clinical corre-
lation is uncertain. However, the clinical relevancy of sperm
morphology
for
predicting
time-to-pregnancy
in
couples
attempting to conceive (Louis et al., 2014) or in predicting IVF/
ICSI success (van den Hoven et al., 2015) is limited. No individ-
ual change in semen quality endpoint remained significant after
control for false discovery rate. Prior studies on choice of

 underwear and semen quality in infertile populations reported
on fewer semen quality endpoints than we do here. Using vari-
ous definitions of abnormal sperm morphology, most studies
report no association with underwear choice (Oldereid et al.,
1991; Munkelwitz & Gilbert, 1998; Pacey et al., 2014), though a
recent study reported fewer sperm neck abnormalities for men
wearing boxers (Jurewicz et al., 2013).
While semen quality as reflected in specific endpoints was
associated with choice of underwear, we observed no differences
in other fecundity outcomes including time-to-pregnancy, con-
ception delay, or infertility. This is consistent with literature
demonstrating individual semen quality endpoints may be asso-
ciated with fecundity (Louis et al., 2014), but taken together,
semen quality has limited capacity to predict fertility (Louis
et al., 2014; Wang & Swerdloff, 2014). As this is the first study on
male underwear and time-to-pregnancy, no prior literature
exists with which we may contextualize our findings. However,
previous studies have described self-reported longer time-to-
pregnancy with occupational heat exposure in male partners
(Rachootin & Olsen, 1983; Figa-Talamanca et al., 1992; Thon-
neau et al., 1997). It is plausible that the increase in scrotal tem-
perature observed in men wearing tight underwear, about 1°C
(Jung et al., 2005), is sufficient to produce differences in semen
quality endpoints but not marked enough to bring about delays
in conception. This is encouraging news in light of market data
that shows sales of tighter fitting underwear are rising as sales of
looser fitting underwear are falling in the United States (The
NPD Group, 2014).
Our study has several strengths. First, this was a large study
population comprising couples recruited from the general popu-
lation rather than men from occupational settings or those seek-
ing fertility related services. Second, we had information on type
of underwear worn during the daytime and to bed separately. In
this way, we were able to explore not only the association of
usual underwear worn during waking hours on semen quality
endpoints, but also whether reducing exposure at night may be
beneficial for semen quality. To our knowledge, we are the first
to report on semen quality endpoints by the combination of

MALE UNDERWEAR AND FECUNDITY
ANDROLOGY
 underwear choice for daytime and bedtime. Third, we were able
to measure 35 semen quality endpoints, including 2 SCSA mea-
sures, which have been investigated in only one prior study (Jur-
ewicz et al., 2013). Fourth, we were able to extend previous work
on the reproductive outcomes associated with type of underwear
use by measuring time-to-pregnancy in a preconception cohort
of couples attempting pregnancy for up to 12 months of trying.
Finally, we had rich information on demographic and lifestyle
factors, self-reported medical history, occupational heat expo-
sure, and other potential heat exposures so that we could evalu-
ate potential confounding variables in both male and female
partners.
We did not have information available on the material of
the underwear, which some have posited to be a putative
mechanism for decreased semen quality because of the elec-
trostatic potential in synthetic materials (Shafik, 1992). This is
an area for future investigation as performance-type under-
wear becomes a larger share of the underwear market (The
NPD Group, 2014). We also did not ask about other types of
clothing worn during the day (e.g. pants or shorts) or to bed
(e.g. pajama bottoms), the use of blankets or other coverings
at bedtime, or proportion of the day spent active or seden-
tary, all of which would impact scrotal temperature. We did
not measure scrotal skin temperature, though others have
investigated this previously (Jung et al., 2005). This study
addressed the relationship between male underwear choice
and fecundity over a very short period of time. We only quer-
ied male underwear use at one time point and assumed that
choice of underwear remained constant throughout the study
period. We had no information on male underwear choice
earlier in adulthood or during pre-pubertal development; the
latter period may be a sensitive exposure window for male
fertility. While the LIFE Study was powered to detect signifi-
cant associations between exposures to environmental chemi-
cals and fecundity, no formal power analysis was conducted
in relation to male underwear types; post hoc power analyses
have limitations that make their interpretation problematic
and so were not conducted. For these reasons, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the negative findings for conception
delay and infertility are a result of low statistical power. Our
semen samples are used for research and not diagnostic pur-
poses. We recognize that in-home semen collection and next-
day analysis are not interchangeable with analysis of samples
collected at clinical centers. The methodologies for in-home
collection
and
24-hour
analysis
have
been
ongoing
as
reported by various authors (Stovall et al., 1994; Royster et al.,
2000) and are suitable for volume, sperm count/concentra-
tion, morphology, and DNA integrity (Morris et al., 2003; Hus-
zar et al., 2004). We developed a protocol that would generate
reliable data for all semen endpoints other than motility out-
comes. Recognizing that motility is challenged, men were
instructed to place the glass straw in the jar after collection
of the sample as a measure of sperm motility at the time of
collection. An important point is that we report relative mea-
sures of association for semen quality by underwear choice.
For bias to have affected our findings would require empirical
evidence or a strong assumption that semen quality analysis
varied systematically by choice of underwear. We are unaware
of any empirical data, and we do not think this is a plausible
assumption. Finally, these data were collected from couples
in the general population and so may not be applicable to
couples receiving infertility treatment. We also reiterate that
the goal of this study was to determine if male underwear
choice is associated with male fecundity as measured by
semen
quality
endpoints,
time-to-pregnancy,
conception
delay, and infertility; this work does not signify that scrotal
temperature, which was beyond the scope of our study, is
irrelevant for male fertility.
In the first observational study on male underwear and semen
quality among the general population attempting pregnancy, we
find that male underwear type is associated with differences in
specific semen quality endpoints, though with no discernable
pattern or any one consistently associated with diminished
semen quality, and no differences remain significant after con-
trolling for the false discovery rate. In the first study on male
underwear and time-to-pregnancy or infertility, we do not find
any significant differences in time-to-pregnancy, conception
delay, or infertility, by underwear type. The style of the male
partner’s underwear does not seem to affect a couple’s ability to
achieve pregnancy. Thus, deferring to man’s comfort for under-
wear choice appears a reasonable option for couples trying to
conceive.
