BACKGROUND: Temporal trends in prostate cancer incidence and death rates have been attributed to changing patterns of screening
and improved treatment (mortality only), among other factors. This study evaluated contemporary national-level trends and their
relations with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing prevalence and explored trends in incidence according to disease characteris-
tics with stage-specific, delay-adjusted rates. METHODS: Joinpoint regression was used to examine changes in delay-adjusted pros-
tate cancer incidence rates from population-based US cancer registries from 2000 to 2014 by age categories, race, and disease
characteristics, including stage, PSA, Gleason score, and clinical extension. In addition, the analysis included trends for prostate can-
cer mortality between 1975 and 2015 by race and the estimation of PSA testing prevalence between 1987 and 2005. The annual per-
cent change was calculated for periods defined by significant trend change points. RESULTS: For all age groups, overall prostate
cancer incidence rates declined approximately 6.5% per year from 2007. However, the incidence of distant-stage disease increased
from 2010 to 2014. The incidence of disease according to higher PSA levels or Gleason scores at diagnosis did not increase.
After years of significant decline (from 1993 to 2013), the overall prostate cancer mortality trend stabilized from 2013 to 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: After a decline in PSA test usage, there has been an increased burden of late-stage disease, and the decline in pros-
tate cancer mortality has leveled off. Cancer 2018;124:2801-14. V

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening into the population has been linked with the dramatic
increase in prostate cancer incidence between 1988 and 1992.1,2 Since the peak in 1992, prostate cancer incidence has
been decreasing, with an acceleration in the rate of decrease in more recent years. Several previous studies have suggested
that the decline in incidence is associated with decreased screening since the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) recommendations against routine PSA testing.3-6 In addition, the decline may also reflect a reduction in the

 pool of indolent cancers detectable by screening each year;
such a reduction is an expected effect of the gradual stabi-
lization of screening and biopsy practices in the 1990s and
early 2000s. Some of these previous studies also reported
recent increases in distant-stage disease based on changes
in the proportion of cases.4,5 However, the interpretation
of incidence trends based on the proportion of cases can
be misleading; proportions of late-stage disease could
increase without a corresponding increase in the overall
incidence rate simply because of a decline in the incidence
of early-stage disease. A recent study reported increases in
the rate of distant-stage prostate cancer in men aged 50 to
74 years.7 However, this recent study and none of the
aforementioned studies simultaneously examined prostate
cancer incidence and death rates.
In the United States, information on incident pros-
tate cancer cases is collected and curated by central cancer
registries with support from the National Cancer Institute’s
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-
gram and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
National Program of Cancer Registries. Sometimes, case
information is transmitted to central cancer registries with
a delay because of the need to observe the staging workup
and the initiation of treatment. Patients with local and
regional disease are more likely to undergo radical prosta-
tectomy.8,9 Because the surgery is performed in a hospital
setting whereas other treatment modalities are adminis-
tered in outpatient centers, there might be a differential
delay in reporting by stage based on the location of treat-
ment. Statistical modeling of reporting delays adjusts the
current case count to correct for the undercount of cases in
the most recent diagnosis years.10 These adjusted counts
and associated rates are valuable for more precisely deter-
mining changes in cancer trends.11
Using population-based incidence and mortality data
and nationally representative screening data, this study was
aimed at examining trends in prostate cancer incidence
and death rates with respect to changes in PSA screening
rates. Temporal trends in incidence rates and proportions
of cases were examined by stage and other disease charac-
teristics, including the PSA level, Gleason score, and clini-
cal extension. Notably, the analysis by stage was adjusted
for delays in reporting; this is the first study to do so.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Several data sources have been used to estimate trends for
annual PSA testing prevalence, prostate cancer incidence
rates, and prostate cancer mortality. Annual PSA testing
rates were derived from self-reported screening tests cap-
tured as part of the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) conducted in 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010,
2013, and 2015. From 2005 forward, we used coding
consistent with Jemal et al6 to determine whether a survey
respondent received a PSA test in the prior year. Ques-
tionnaires before 2005 were not consistent with those
from 2005 onward; for respondents who could not recall
precisely the timing of their last test, there were more
alternative options for ascertaining whether the test was
received within the past year, and response options varied
for the question asking the main reason for having
received a PSA test (eg, a routine physical examination/
screening test vs a routine examination). For these reasons,
the data are displayed as a disconnected series.
Because questions about PSA testing were not in-
cluded in the NHIS until the 2000 survey, longer term
trends back to the late 1980s (when PSA screening rapidly
disseminated in the US population) must be recon-
structed through modeling. Long-term trends in the pro-
portion of men having a PSA test in the previous year and
in the proportion of men having a first PSA test between
1987 and 2005 are an update of previous modeled esti-
mates.12 The NHIS survey conducted in 2005 asked
respondents to specify the year in which they had received
their last PSA test, which implicitly was the year of the
first test for respondents with just 1 test. For the corre-
sponding NHIS survey years, intervals between PSA test-
ing were estimated from claims available for a 5% random
sample of Medicare beneficiaries who were residents of
SEER areas and had not been diagnosed with cancer.13
Age at first test and intervals between tests were first com-
bined in 1987 to simulate PSA testing patterns.
We used 3 different prostate cancer incidence series,
including different geographic areas depending on the
purpose of our analysis. To study the impact of long-term
PSA testing use on prostate cancer incidence trends, we
used cases diagnosed between 1975 and 2014 by site
recode definition14 and reported by 9 SEER registries
(Atlanta, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mex-
ico, San Francisco–Oakland, Seattle–Puget Sound, and
Utah). Distant-stage incidence for this series was calcu-
lated with SEER historic stage A. For a shorter term series
that included more geographic areas within the United
States, we used a set of registries that satisfied criteria
required by the North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries (NAACCR) for inclusion in the Cancer
in North America annual reports.15 This set included 42
state central cancer registries covering 89% of the US pop-
ulation,16 and it was consistent with the data set used in

these registries was available only back to 2001, we used
this series only for cases from 2001 forward. Consistent

Stage
200018,19 for 2001 to 2003 and with Derived Summary
Stage 200020 for 2004 to 2014. When the Derived Sum-
mary Stage 2000 was missing, the abstracted stage was
used if the reporting source was deemed reliable. Finally,
to compute prostate cancer incidence trends by the PSA
test value at diagnosis, Gleason score, and clinical exten-
sion of the tumor, we used data from the SEER 18 regis-
tries21 for the years 2004-2014, which represented 28%
of the US male population. The data set excluded patients
whose only reporting source was a death certificate, an
autopsy report, or a nursing home record. For analyses
involving disease characteristics, only SEER data were
used because they had been recently reviewed for PSA
accuracy and any errors corrected back to 2004.22
The highest value of serum PSA within the 3 months
preceding the diagnostic biopsy has been collected by can-
cer registries for cases diagnosed in 2004 and after. For
each calendar year between 2004 and 2014, we catego-
rized patients into 3 categories of tumor aggressiveness
based on the PSA value at diagnosis (0.1-9.9, 10.0-19.9,
and �20 ng/mL), following clinical management guide-
lines issued by the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC)23 and the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network.8
In addition, disease aggressiveness at the time of
diagnosis was assessed on the basis of the Gleason score
and clinical extension of the primary tumor. All cases were
classified according to the most recent clinical guideline
recommendations into Gleason grade groups: 2 to 6, 7, 8,
9 to 10, and unknown.23-25 Per cancer registration rules,
if the Gleason score was available from multiple pathology
examinations, including core biopsy, transurethral resec-
tion, and prostatectomy specimens, the highest known
Gleason score was used to assign the grade group.26 The
incidence of cases with unknown Gleason scores decreased
over time, but the decline was not statistically significant.
Using the Collaborative Stage–derived AJCC-6 T
variable,27 we categorized patients diagnosed from 2004
to 2014 by extraprostatic extension into the following
groups: no extraprostatic extension (corresponding to
clinical T1-T2), extraprostatic extension (corresponding
to clinical T3-T4), and unknown extraprostatic extension
status. The extraprostatic extension definitions used were
those recommended for the assignment of the TNM clini-
cal T variable for the prostate by the AJCC28 and included
physical examinations, biopsies (including biopsies of the
seminal glands), and imaging examinations.
The mortality files were obtained from the National
Center for Health Statistics. We calculated prostate cancer
mortality for the years 1975-2015 by using all cases with
an underlying cause of death coded as a malignant neo-
plasm of the prostate (International Classification of Dis-
eases, Adapted, 8th Revision and International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 185 in 1975-1998 and
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code
C61 in 1999-2015). Race information available on the
death certificate was used to calculate race-specific pros-
tate cancer death rates for black men and white men.
The 2000 US standard population was used for the
age adjustment of all incidence and mortality estimates. A
more in-depth description of incidence and death rate
estimation is available in an accompanying article.17 All
incidence rates were adjusted for reporting delays accord-
ing to the methodology described in the Statistical Meth-
ods section. When used, age and race variables were
collected and categorized according to the NAACCR data
standards.29
Statistical Methods
Historically, delay-adjustment modeling was done only
for registries in the SEER areas, but in the last several
years, it has been expanded to include registries through-
out the United States and Canada that participate in the
NAACCR Call for Data.30 Delay-adjustment factors are
typically developed by registry, cancer site, age, and race,
but for this project, they were also developed for prostate
cancer by stage of disease for cases diagnosed from 2001
to 2014; SEER Summary Stage 200018,19 was used for
2001 to 2003, and Derived Summary Stage20 was used
for 2004 to 2014. For example, for US cases from 2014
for all races combined, the count needed to be adjusted
upward of approximately 7% for localized and regional
disease cases and 15% for distant and unstaged cases.
Both incidence rates and proportions of cancer cases were
delay-adjusted. For rates, only the numerator (ie, case
counts) was delay-adjusted, whereas for the proportions
of cases (eg, the proportion of cases with extraprostatic
extension), both the numerator and the denominator
were delay-adjusted. Delay-adjusted rates and proportions
involving disease characteristics were not stage-specific.
SEER*Stat software, version 8.3.4,31 was used to
calculate the age-adjusted incidence with the delay-
adjusted counts for each of the risk categories. In addition,
the counts were used to calculate the proportion of
patients in each risk group by diagnosis year. A trend

 analysis was conducted to identify the joinpoints (ie, trend
change years) and estimate the annual percent change
(APC) of the incidence rate. Separately, the same analysis
was used to study the changes in the proportion of cases
diagnosed with certain disease characteristics (eg, low,
intermediate, and high PSA levels). We calculated the
incidence and trends for all cases by age category (50-74
vs � 75 years) and race (black men vs white men). Age cat-
egories were selected to replicate those relevant in the con-
text of the USPSTF recommendations for PSA-based
screening.3,4
Temporal trends in age-standardized, delay-adjusted
cancer incidence and death rates were estimated with join-
point regression,32 which uses statistical criteria to deter-
mine both the number and location of trend changes. The
joinpoint model fits linear trends to the log-transformed
incidence or death rates, with the slope of the trend chang-
ing at the joinpoints. The maximum possible number of
joinpoints is determined by the number of observation
points. The slope of the model represents the APC in rates.
A 2-sided statistical-significance (P< .05) t test is used to
determine if the APC differs significantly from zero.
RESULTS
Trends in PSA Testing and Prostate
Cancer Incidence
Figure 1 displays the long-term trends in PSA testing and
the incidence of prostate cancer (all stages combined and
distant stage). The use of PSA testing increased very rap-
idly in the initial years after the test was first approved for
the surveillance of prostate cancer patients by the US
Food and Drug Administration in 1986, with the inci-
dence of newly tested men peaking in 1992. The dissemi-
nation of PSA testing among men was practically zero in
1987, but by 1992, 24% of men aged 50 years or older
had undergone at least 1 test. The rapid increase in PSA
testing between 1987 and 1992 coincides with the dra-
matic increase in prostate cancer incidence during 1988
through 1992 and a slightly delayed sharp decline in
distant-stage prostate cancer incidence between 1991 and
1994. The rise and fall of first PSA testing mimicked that
of prostate cancer incidence. The incidence of PSA testing
in previously unscreened men peaked between 1991 and
1992 when the prevalence of men undergoing their first
PSA test was close to 10%.
While Figure 1A shows the trends of PSA testing,
Figure 2A-C presents the most recent trends in PSA
screening by race and age category. In addition, Figure
2D-I presents prostate cancer incidence for all stages
combined and distant-stage disease. Screening rates
declined after 2008 for all age and race categories
shown, except for black men aged 75 years or older. As
measured by the NHIS, PSA testing rates for all races
and white men declined for men aged 50 to 74 years in
2013 in comparison with the prior survey in 2010. For
all age groups shown, prostate cancer incidence rates
consistently declined 6.5% per year from 2007 for all
races combined, 6.8% per year from 2007 for white
men, and 5.9% per year from 2009 for black men. For
distant-stage disease, there was an inflection point in the
trends across all ages and racial groups. In all cases,
except for black men aged 75 years or older, the rise in
rates was significant after the joinpoint. The joinpoint
varied from 2010 to 2011 for all ages combined and for
men aged 75 years or older and from 2008 to 2009 for
men aged 50 to 74 years. However, the confidence inter-
vals constructed around the starting point of the final
segment of distant-stage disease overlapped (95% confi-
dence interval for the joinpoint, 2006-2011 for the 50-
to 74-year age category vs 2009-2012 for the � 75-year
age category [data not shown in figures]). The rise in the
incidence rate of distant-stage prostate cancer occurred
at a time when fewer incident cases were reported as
unstaged (2004-2014 APCs for the unstaged incidence
rate, –4.0 for all races, –5.3 for whites, and –3.6 for
blacks [data not shown in the figures]). Thus, the
increase in distant-stage incidence rates can be partially
explained by better staging workup and/or better stage
documentation.
Although Figures 1 to 5 show incidence rate esti-
mates from 3 different data sets representing varying levels
of population coverage and time intervals, the average
annual prostate cancer incidence trend for the common
time period (years 2004-2014) and the data set covering
the largest population (89% of the United States) was
25.1% (data not shown in figures).
Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence
and Proportions by Disease Characteristics
As shown in Figure 3, most patients were diagnosed at
PSA levels below 10 ng/mL (a low recurrence risk); this is
true for all age categories. Proportionally, fewer men aged
75 years or older were diagnosed at PSA levels below
10 ng/mL in comparison with men aged 50 to 74 years.
The highest incidence rate of cases diagnosed at PSA levels
below 10 ng/mL among men aged 75 years or older was
observed in 2007, and a statistically significant downtrend
occurred after 2007. However, the incidence rate of dis-
eases diagnosed at low risk peaked earlier among patients
diagnosed at the age of 75 years or older (2007) in

 comparison with patients aged 50 to 74 years (2009).
Meanwhile, the incidence rate of prostate cancer diag-
nosed at PSA levels higher than 20 ng/mL (a high recur-
rence risk) for men of all ages declined steadily through
2012 and has plateaued in more recent years, except for
men aged 50 to 74 years, whose incidence rate of diseases
diagnosed at high risk has continued to decline through
2014.
Figure 4 shows that the incidence rate of tumors
with an aggressive histologic grade (ie, Gleason score of
9-10) for all ages combined remained steady between
2004 and 2014 (APC, 0.0). However, for men aged 75
years or older, there was a small but persistent decline
(APC, –1.1) in the incidence rate of patients who pre-
sented with a Gleason score of 9 to 10 at diagnosis
between 2004 and 2014. For the same age category, the

 ever since (41% in 2014). After 2010, the proportion of
new tumors diagnosed at a Gleason score of 2 to 6
decreased, whereas the proportion of tumors that pre-
sented with a more aggressive Gleason score increased.
This trend (APC, 12.4) was particularly apparent among
men aged 50 to 74 years, with nearly 9% of patients
newly diagnosed in 2014 presenting with the most
aggressive Gleason score category.
As presented in Figure 5, the clear majority of tumors
were assessed as confined to the prostate gland at the time of
diagnosis (corresponding to clinical T1-T2). Overall, the
incidence of unknown T classifications increased between
2004 and 2009 and decreased significantly with the intro-
duction of the seventh edition of the AJCC system in 2010.
The incidence of prostate-confined tumors (clinical T1-T2)
has been declining steadily since it peaked in 2007 (144 per
100,000) at approximately the same slope for all cases com-
bined (APC, –7.4), men aged 50 to 74 years (APC, –8.9),
and men aged 75 years or older (APC, –9.2). The incidence
of tumors with clinical extraprostatic extension (corre-
sponding to cT3-cT4) has also been decreasing in all age
categories (APC, –3.8, –4.3, and –1.4, respectively), albeit
at a slower pace than the cT1 to cT2 decrease.

Prostate cancer mortality increased slowly before 1987
(APC, 0.9), but the trend moved upward at a steeper rate
after 1987 for all races (APC, 3.0) and white men (APC,
3.1) and after 1988 for black men (APC, 3.2), as shown in
Figure 6. The highest mortality during the observation
period (1975-2015) for all races combined was observed
in 1993 (39.3 per 100,000). Mortality for black men
peaked in 1993 (81.9 per 100,000), 2 years after mortality
peaked for white men (36.5 per 100,000). After the peak,
a greater decline in mortality was observed in black men
(APC, –2.5) in comparison with white men (APC, –0.7).
Between 2001 and 2015, the rate of decline among black
men increased to an APC of –4.2. However, after a more
sustained fall between 1994 and 1999 (APC, –4.3), the
mortality decline slowed among white men (APC, –3.3)
and then leveled off after 2013 (APC, –0.4 [statistically
nonsignificant]).
DISCUSSION
Original Contribution
This article uses national surveillance data to examine in
detail the recent trends in prostate cancer incidence rates
(based on data representing 89% of the US population)
and prostate cancer death rates (based on mortality data
covering the entire United States). The incidence esti-
mates are presented by race and stage concurrent with
PSA testing. To improve the accuracy of incidence estima-
tion, the analysis used stage-specific delay-adjustment

 coefficients, which were found to be twice as large for dis-
tant and unstaged disease in comparison with local and
regional disease. These stage-specific delay-adjustment
coefficients allowed for a better correction of the reporting
delay, a bias that potentially masks a trend change in the
most recent years of a time series. Trends in the distribu-
tion of tumor characteristics, including the PSA test value,
Gleason score, and clinical extension of the tumor, at the
time of diagnosis allowed the examination of differences
associated with more aggressive disease. The analysis has
been conducted with the only population-based data set
for which PSA values have been fully audited and cor-
rected.22 Presenting prostate cancer statistics alongside
PSA testing estimates gives us insight into the interpreta-
tion of prostate cancer trends and how PSA test usage may
have influenced national statistics.
An observation not fully explained is the dissonance
of generally downward or stable incidence trends for pros-
tate cancer diagnosed with the most aggressive disease
characteristics (ie, high PSA levels, Gleason score of 9-10,
and extraprostatic extension) and the upward trend of dis-
tant disease incidence after 2010. Specifically, in most
recent years (2010-2014), the incidence of cases with high
PSA levels and cases with Gleason scores of 9 to 10 was
relatively flat, and the incidence of extraprostatic exten-
sion cases decreased significantly at the same time that the
incidence of distant disease increased significantly.
This analysis included all incident prostate cancer
diagnosed in the covered areas and observation periods,
regardless of the diagnosing facility type (eg, hospital vs
independent urology practice) and disease management
plan (eg, active surveillance vs curative-intent treatment).
Underreporting of outpatients under active surveillance is
a general concern in cancer surveillance; however, this
type of bias is less likely to affect patients diagnosed at a
late stage because these patients typically receive treatment
in inpatient settings.
Difference Between Incidence and Proportion
When we look at the characteristics of cancer at diagnosis,
data are shown as incidence rates and proportions of cases
in each PSA test value, Gleason score, and clinical extrap-
rostatic extension category. Incidence rates reflect the
population risk of being diagnosed with a cancer having
certain characteristics, whereas the proportions of cases
reflect the probability that a man diagnosed with prostate
cancer will present with specific characteristics. For exam-
ple, if we assume a steady rate of cases with high PSA lev-
els, as the incidence rate decreases for cases with low PSA
levels (the cases most likely to be detected by testing), the
proportion of cases presenting with high PSA levels will
increase. However, this increase in the proportion of cases
with high PSA levels does not necessarily imply either an
increase in the incidence rate of cases with high PSA levels
or an increase in the number of men diagnosed with high
PSA levels. This report shows that as the proportions of
cases with high PSA levels, high Gleason scores, and clini-
cal extraprostatic extension increased, the actual incidence
rates of those cases decreased or remained the same. When
testing is introduced into the population or when testing
usage declines, changes in the proportion of cases diag-
nosed with aggressive disease can be incorrectly inter-
preted as a change in risk. Moreover, changes in early
detection procedures and in staging workup sensitivity
make the interpretation of proportions even more diffi-
cult. For example, waiting for serial PSA measurements to
calculate the PSA velocity before the first biopsy is per-
formed can increase the counts of patients diagnosed with
high-risk PSA. Similarly, more sensitive imaging techni-
ques may result in better detection of cases with extrapro-
static extension. Thus,
the distribution of disease
characteristics at diagnosis and the trend based on propor-
tions alone are difficult to interpret. Looking at incidence
rates and proportion distributions side by side for prostate
cancer demonstrates the importance of considering both
measures when one is interpreting trends to understand
the cancer burden.
Changes in Screening Recommendations
and the Expected Impact and Timing
on Incidence
In this report, trends in PSA testing seem to reflect the
timing of changes in the USPSTF recommendations. In
August 2008, the USPSTF recommended an I rating
(insufficient evidence) for PSA-based prostate cancer
screening for men younger than 75 years but a D rating (a
recommendation against screening) for men aged 75 years
or older.3 PSA testing use declined after 2008 for all races
and for white men in particular. In May 2012, the
USPSTF revised its recommendations to a D rating for
PSA-based prostate cancer screening, regardless of age.4
PSA screening rates for all races and for white men in par-
ticular declined for men aged 50 to 74 years in 2013 in
comparison with 2010.
We show that when PSA testing was initially intro-
duced in the late 1980s, there was a very rapid decline in
the incidence of distant-stage prostate cancer. From this,
it might be anticipated that reduced testing usage may
trigger a similarly rapid increase in distant-stage disease.
Starting with the 2008 NHIS, we report a modest fall in

 PSA testing that is consistent with other reports.33 Con-
comitantly, we observed an increase in distant-stage dis-
ease incidence of 4.4 per 100,000 (between 2008 and
2014). There is a continuum of potential for progression
in the cancers poised to be diagnosed at any point in
time. When medical providers increase the intensity of
screening, certain would-be distant cases are likely to be
detected at an earlier stage. The rapid decline in distant-
stage prostate cancer incidence in the early 1990s, shortly
after PSA-based prostate cancer screening started, corrob-
orates this explanation, as do simulations using well-
calibrated models of the natural history of prostate
cancer.34
In May 2017, the USPSTF issued a draft recom-
mendation statement changing a D rating to a C rating
for men aged 55 to 69 years; this indicated that the deci-
sion about whether to be screened for prostate cancer
should be an individual one.35 This could again result in
changes in PSA testing and, consequently, the incidence
of distant-stage prostate cancer.
In contrast to overall prostate cancer incidence rates,
trend inflection points for cases diagnosed at low PSA lev-
els by age category followed the chronology of the
USPSTF recommendations (the decrease occurred first
and was more significant among those aged 75 years or
older). The incidence rate of prostate cancer with high
PSA levels decreased slightly until 2012 and appears to
have flattened from 2012 to 2014. High PSA levels at
prostate cancer diagnosis are associated with a higher risk
of recurrent disease.36 The incidence rate of high-grade
disease was relatively stable, and the risk of extraprostatic
extension decreased both before and after the USPSTF
recommendations.
Change in Assigning the Gleason Score
The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology
consensus conference recommended that a high-grade
tumor of any quantity should be included in the calcula-
tions of the Gleason score.25 These recommendations
have been reflected in the distribution of cases diagnosed
in 2006 and later.37 As other authors reported, we found a
migration of cases from the group with Gleason scores of
2 to 6 to the group with Gleason scores of 7. This migra-
tion has been seen in younger patients and had been
observed before the 2012 USPSTF recommendations. In
addition to the changes in the International Society of
Urological Pathology guidelines, Gleason score abstract-
ing instructions for cancer registrars changed in 2010.
The score of the specimen obtained at prostatectomy was
collected separately from the biopsy score and used for
this analysis whenever the information was available.
Thus, 2010 and later results may reflect better data collec-
tion practices. Nevertheless, the underlying population
risk for aggressive tumors was unchanged during the 11
years of observation (2004-2014). Among men aged 75
years or older, the risk of an aggressive histologic grade
decreased slightly. However, as with the PSA, the propor-
tion of new cases diagnosed at higher Gleason scores
increased significantly in later years. This is expected to
have an impact on the distributions of treatment because
having a Gleason score of 9 to 10 is a contraindication for
active surveillance or short-term androgen deprivation
therapy.8
Plausible Explanations for Changes
in Mortality Trends
A decline in prostate cancer mortality rate for men of all
races combined started in 1994 but stabilized between
2013 and 2015. The decline in the prostate cancer–spe-
cific mortality rate among white men slowed after 1999,
well before the 2012 USPSTF D recommendation for
PSA-based prostate cancer screening. Gulati et al38
showed an expected flattening of mortality even in the
absence of the recent decline in PSA testing. Interpreting
trends in mortality is somewhat complex. Although this
flattening of the mortality trend is temporally associated
with the fall in PSA testing and the rise of distant-stage
disease, there are other possible contributing factors. For
example, the timing and duration of the flattening could
have been affected by improvements in treatment.39,40
Since 1994, multiple factors might have contributed to a
continuing decline in prostate cancer mortality, such as
recent trends toward earlier detection and improved treat-
ment of metastatic and castration-resistant disease.41,42 In
conjunction with incidence data, death rate trends over
the next few years can be used to track the role of PSA
screening in declining prostate cancer mortality, although
these trends may be partially confounded by steady
improvements in prostate cancer treatment and by earlier
detection of recurrent disease.
Limitations
Joinpoint regression is a powerful method for detecting
changes in trends when the magnitude of change is small.
However, there is uncertainty about the exact location of a
joinpoint (ie, year of rate change), and this uncertainty is
greater when the APC change between 2 successive seg-
ments is small but still statistically significant. This makes
it particularly difficult to determine the exact temporal

 relation between interventions (ie, screening and thera-
peutics) and population-based effects.
A comprehensive evaluation of any preventive inter-
vention involves weighing both benefits and harms. This
analysis did not attempt to cover patterns of adverse
effects at the population or individual level and did not
focus on indicators that may point to changes in trends in
the frequency of adverse effects. Better information on the
trends of adverse effects is necessary to understand
whether the changes in incidence and mortality trends
reported by this article translated into a change in the risk-
benefit ratio at the population level. In addition to under-
standing how the risk-benefit ratio has changed, cancer
control efforts for prostate cancer may be informed by a
more in-depth analysis of how measures of occurrence
based on disease characteristics are related to the incidence
of late-stage disease and disease-specific mortality.
In conclusion, this analysis of prostate cancer trends
adjusted for delays in reporting by stage of disease showed
an increase in the incidence of late-stage disease from
2010 to 2014. This change chronologically followed new
recommendations in the USPSTF guidelines for PSA-
based prostate cancer screening.3,4 In addition, the inci-
dence of disease characteristics has changed because newly
diagnosed patients are less likely to present with low-risk
localized disease and, consequently, are less likely to be eli-
gible for active surveillance. However, there was no
increase in the incidence of patients with other high-risk
characteristics (ie, high PSA level, high Gleason score, and
extraprostatic extension) to date. These findings, together
with the flattening of previously declining mortality
trends, illustrate a trend of increasing late-stage disease
after decreasing PSA screening at the population level.
