Using a test-negative design, the Canadian Sentinel 
Practitioner Surveillance Network assessed interim 
2018/19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against predomi-
nant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Adjusted VE 
was 72% (95% confidence interval: 60 to 81) against 
medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. This substantial vaccine pro-
tection was observed in all age groups, notably young 
children who appeared to be disproportionately 
affected. Sequence analysis identified heterogeneity 
in emerging clade 6B.1 viruses but no dominant drift 
variant.
The 2018/19 influenza season in Canada for the period 
spanning November through January has been char-
acterised by dominant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activ-
ity, with lesser influenza A(H3N2) and little influenza 
B contribution [1]. This profile is in contrast to the 
2017/18 season which was comprised of dominant 
influenza A(H3N2) and early influenza B(Yamagata) co-
circulation [2]. The last influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-domi-
nant epidemics in Canada were in 2013/14 and 2015/16 
[3,4].
The 2018/19 influenza vaccine for the northern hemi-
sphere contains an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-
like antigen (belonging to clade 6B.1). The same 
component was included in the 2017/18 northern and 
the 2018 southern hemisphere vaccines [5]. Preliminary 
estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) from Australia’s 
2018 season showed substantial VE of 78% (95% con-
fidence interval (CI): 51 to 91) against influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses [6]. Here we present interim 2018/19 
VE estimates against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
from the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance 
Network (SPSN), including detailed genetic characteri-
sation of contributing viruses.
Vaccine effectiveness evaluation
VE was estimated using a test-negative design, as 
previously described [2-4]. Nasal/nasopharyngeal 
specimens and epidemiological data were collected 
from patients presenting to community-based senti-
nel practitioners in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, 
and Quebec. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as 
acute onset of self-reported fever and cough and at 
least one other symptom including sore throat, myal-
gia, arthralgia or prostration. Fever was not a require-
ment for elderly adults 65 years and older. Analyses 
were restricted to patients at least 1-year-old present-
ing within 7 days of ILI onset. Vaccination status was 
based on self-report of 2018/19 vaccine receipt at 
least 2 weeks before symptom onset; patients vacci-
nated less than 2 weeks before onset or with unknown 
vaccination status or timing were excluded. Compliance 
with two-dose recommendations in young children was 
not assessed. All influenza vaccines manufactured for 
Canada (including SPSN provinces) for 2018/19 were 
 2

egg-based and the vast majority (> 95%) were inac-
tivated vaccines (i.e. the live attenuated influenza 
vaccine constituted < 5% of doses distributed by the 
publicly-funded immunisation campaign). A high dose 
inactivated formulation was available for elderly adults 
in the SPSN province of Ontario. Institutional review 
boards in each province provided ethical approval.
Specimens collected from week 45 (starting 4 November 
2018) to week 2 (ending 12 January 2019) were tested 
for influenza type and subtype by real-time RT-PCR 
assays at provincial public health reference laborato-
ries. Sanger sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) 
gene (HA1 and HA2) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses contrib-
uting to VE analyses was conducted for all SPSN prov-
inces at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control 
Public Health Laboratory. Virus sequencing was under-
taken on original patient specimens, including as 
many as possible in the order received. Viral sequence 
data are being deposited for reference into the Global 
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) plat-
form (www.gisaid.org )

a One specimen was co-infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B and another specimen was co-infected with influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 and A(H3N2). Viruses involved in co-infections are plotted separately by type/subtype such that specimens involved in co-infections 
appear twice.
b Missing specimen collection dates were imputed as the date the specimen was received and processed at the provincial laboratory minus 2 
days, the average time between specimen collection date and laboratory received date among specimens with complete information for both 
values. Data for week 2 may be incomplete given delays in specimen processing and laboratory testing.

Unless otherwise specified, values displayed in the columns represent the number of specimens per category and percentages are relative to 
the total. Where the denominator for the percentages differs from the total, fractions supporting the calculation of percentages are shown.
a p values for comparison between cases and controls were derived by chi-squared test, Fisher’s exact test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
b Vaccination status based on patients’ self-report; defined as receipt of 2018/19 seasonal influenza vaccine at least 2 weeks before symptom 
onset. Patients vaccinated less than 2 weeks before onset of symptoms or with unknown vaccination status or timing were excluded.
c p values for comparison of the proportion vaccinated were derived by chi-squared test, Fisher’s exact test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
d Includes chronic comorbidities that place individuals at higher risk of serious complications from influenza as defined by Canada’s National 
Advisory Committee on Immunization, including: heart, pulmonary (including asthma), renal, metabolic (such as diabetes), blood, cancer 
or immunocompromising conditions, conditions that compromise management of respiratory secretions and increase risk of aspiration, or 
morbid obesity (body mass index ≥ 40).
e Missing specimen collection dates were imputed as the date the specimen was received and processed at the laboratory minus 2 days, the 
average time between specimen collection date and laboratory received date among specimens with complete information for both values.
f Participants who received seasonal 2018/19 influenza vaccine less than 2 weeks before ILI onset or for whom vaccination timing was unknown 
were excluded from the primary analysis. They are included here for assessing vaccination regardless of timing for comparison to other 
estimates of vaccination coverage.

Emerging genetic variants were assigned to genetic 
subgroups based on defining amino acid substitutions 
[7,8]. Substitutions were assessed for their involvement 
of HA1 antigenic sites (especially immuno-dominant 
Sa and Sb, but also Ca1, Ca2 or Cb), or as otherwise 
relevant to diversifying selection [9-11]. Sequence 
analysis was in relation to the cell-passaged A/
Michigan/45/2015 vaccine reference strain and the cor-
responding egg-adapted version (A/Michigan/45/2015 
X-275) as well as an alternate egg-adapted strain 
(A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 IVR-180) also used by 
manufacturers.
Odds ratios (OR) comparing influenza test positivity 
between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants 
were calculated using a logistic regression model, 
adjusted for age group, province, time from ILI onset 
to specimen collection, and specimen collection date. 
VE was derived as (1 − OR) × 100%. VE was estimated 
against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the primary

analysis, but estimates against any influenza and influ-
enza A are also presented.
Epidemiological findings
Among 1,518 eligible specimens, 661 (44%) tested 
positive for influenza, including 656 (99%) influenza 
A, 4 (1%) influenza B and 1 (0.2%) influenza A/B co-
infection. Among the 626 (95%) subtyped influenza A 
viruses, 585 (93%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 41 (7%) 
were A(H3N2) (Figure 1). There were two co-infections 
involving influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: one with influenza 
B and another with influenza A(H3N2). 
Participant profiles are displayed in Table 1 for the 585 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases and 857 test-negative 
controls included in primary VE analysis. Most (62%) 
participants were adults 20–64-years-old. However, 
significantly more influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases 
(28%) than controls (14%) were children 1–8-years-old 
(p < 0.001); that age group also had the highest influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09 test positivity (58%; 163/282). 
Conversely, significantly fewer influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 cases than controls were 65 years or older (4% 
vs 13%; p < 0.001), and this age group exhibited the 
lowest influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 test positivity (18%; 
25/138). Overall, 27% of controls but just 8% of influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were considered vaccinated 
(p < 0.001) (Table 1).
After adjustment for relevant covariates, VE against 
any influenza, foremost driven by A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses, was 68% (95% CI: 55 to 77); for influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 alone, it was 72% (95% CI: 60 to 81) 
(Table 2). Estimates for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were 
similar in sensitivity analyses: with additional adjust-
ment for sex and comorbidity, VE was 74% (95% CI: 
61 to 82), and with restriction to specimens collected 
from 2 December 2018 (week 49), VE was 70% (95% CI: 
55 to 8). By age group, adjusted VE estimates against 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were: 91% (95% CI: 67 to 
98) in 1–8-year-old children, 71% (95% CI: −60 to 95) 
in 9–19-year-old children, 68% (95% CI: 51 to 80) in 
20–64-year-old adults and 65% (95% CI: −1 to 88) in 
adults 65 years and older.
Virological findings
Sequencing of the HA gene was available for 240 (41%) 
of 585 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Collection 
dates of sequenced viruses spanned from 5 November 
2018 to 4 January 2019 (Table 3, Figure 2). All 
sequenced viruses belonged to genetic clade 6B.1, to 
which the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine reference virus 
also belongs. However, all sequenced viruses addition-
ally bore substitutions S74R (Cb), S164T (Sa) and I295V 
compared with the cell-passaged A/Michigan/45/2015 
vaccine strain (except for nine viruses which showed 
continued drift at position 74). All viruses also bore 
additional substitutions M209K and R223K (receptor-
binding site) attributed to egg adaptation mutations in 
the A/Michigan/45/2015 X-275 vaccine strain.
Beyond these shared substitutions, we observed het-
erogeneity among sequenced influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses overall and by province, with no single sub-
group dominating. Across subgroups, an S183P (non-
antigenic site) substitution was found in 200 (83%) of 
240 viruses and T185I (Sb) was found in 136 (57%) of 
240 viruses. In Alberta, where there was an earlier epi-
demic peak [1], most viruses (72/105; 69%) belonged 
to a 6B.1 subgroup bearing T185I (Sb) with S183P and 
N451T substitutions (both non-antigenic sites); the 
same variant was also identified in a substantial pro-
portion of viruses in British Columbia (26/75; 35%). In 
Ontario and Quebec, where fewer viruses contributed 
to sequence analysis, a different mix of subgroups was 
identified (Table 3, Figure 2).
 
Discussion
In this interim analysis, the 2018/19 influenza vac-
cine is estimated to have reduced the risk of medically 
attended influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 illness in Canada 
by 72%. This 2018/19 mid-season VE estimate against 
dominant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses is substan-
tially higher than last reported in the mid-season anal-
ysis from Canada for the 2017/18 A(H3N2)-dominant 
influenza epidemic, for which VE against A(H3N2) 
viruses was below 20% (with a paucity of A(H1N1)
pdm09 cases detected) [2].
Our 2018/19 VE estimate of 72% (95% CI: 60 to 81) 
against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses is comparable 
to a preliminary report from Australia using the same 
vaccine component for their 2018 season (78%) [6]. 
Both estimates are higher than reported in prior meta-
analysis for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (61%; 
95% CI: 57 to 65) [12]. The Canadian SPSN estimate for 
2018/19 is similar to mid-season estimates from our 
network during the last two A(H1N1)pdm09-dominant 
epidemics in 2013/14 and 2015/16 [3,4]. Of note, the 
2013/14 epidemic peaked in January 2014, with com-
parable VE estimates at mid- and end-of-season anal-
ysis (74%; 95% CI: 58 to 83 and 71%; 95% CI: 58 to 
80, respectively) [10]. Conversely, the mid-season VE 
estimate for 2015/16 was substantially higher than the 
end-of-season estimate (64%; 95% CI: 44 to 77 vs 43%; 
95% CI: 25 to 57), a finding that may in part be explained 
by waning of immunity and the unusually delayed epi-
demic peak in March 2016 (after which half the cases 
were accrued) [13]. Similar to 2013/14, the current sea-
son’s epidemic may have already peaked nationally in 
Canada; however, there is regional variation in the tim-
ing and intensity of activity [1]. Differences in VE esti-
mates at end-of-season analysis cannot be ruled out.
Globally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are in genetic 
flux, with substantial heterogeneity in circulating clade 
6B.1 viruses, but no dominant drift (immunological 
escape) variant yet declaring a fitness advantage (as 
in 2015/16) [8]. Consistent with virus characterisa-
tion in Europe [7], all sentinel A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
sequenced here belonged to clade 6B.1 and bore 
 8
www.eurosurveillance.org
additional S74R (Cb), S164T (Sa) and I295V mutations. 
Across various genetic subgroups, most viruses (83%) 
also bore S183P. Although the latter is not within an 
antigenic site, the introduction of proline (a large aro-
matic ring) in such close proximity to antigenic site 
Sb could have structural effects. A slim majority of 
sequenced viruses (57%) in several subgroups bore 
T185I substitution. Amino acid 185 in antigenic site Sb 
first mutated during the 2010/11 season and became 
established in the A(H1N1)pdm09 population as clades 
6 and 7, with S185T becoming dominant in subsequent 
seasons. The extent to which T185I substitution may 
now instead prevail warrants monitoring, especially 
when present alongside S183P as prominently identi-
fied in western Canada. Of note, antigenic site Sa has 
also evolved considerably over the past seven sea-
sons (with mutations localised around amino acids 
160–163). While the 2013/14 A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic 
was dominated by a K163Q mutant and 2015/16 by the 
clade 6B.1 S162N variant, this season L161I and K160M 
substitutions have arisen, albeit infrequently (12% and 
2% of viruses, respectively). These substitutions may 
be particularly relevant since they are located adja-
cent to an important, experimentally determined B-cell 
epitope [11]. Further, the amino acid at position 74 in 
site Cb continues to drift, with 4% of SPSN viruses car-
rying either the R74I or R74G substitution.
That interim VE estimates were not markedly affected 
by this genetic heterogeneity is consistent with find-
ings from national surveillance systems in Canada, 
the United States (US) and Europe reporting few influ-
enza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (< 5%) manifesting anti-
genic drift from the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain 
[1,7,14,15]. In Canada, low-level antigenic distinction 
has been restricted to viruses bearing a substitution at 
position 156, within the immuno-dominant Sa site and 
previously recognised as influential on antigenicity and 
receptor-binding properties [16-18]. Mutations at posi-
tion 156, however, were identified in just 2% of SPSN 
sequences so far this season. In combination, these 
findings reinforce the World Health Organization’s 
decision to retain the A/Michigan/45/2015 strain for 
the forthcoming 2019 southern hemisphere vaccine [5]. 
However, global monitoring for further evolution in cir-
culating variants remains important to inform potential 
vaccine reformulation for subsequent seasons.
As in prior SPSN analyses [2-4], most participants in 
the current analysis were adults aged 20–64 years 
(62%). However, 1–8-year-old children appeared to 
be disproportionately affected, accounting for 28% of 
A(H1N1)pdm09 cases overall in our outpatient setting 
(despite comprising ca 9% of the underlying population 
and 14% of controls across SPSN provinces [19]). This 
paediatric involvement is also consistent with national 
surveillance findings for 2018/19 [1] but may be more 
pronounced in the current analysis than in previous 
A(H1N1)pdm09-dominated seasons. For example, 160 
(30%) of 540 unvaccinated influenza A(H1N1)pdm90 
cases in 2018/19 were 1–8-year-old children (Table 
1) whereas their corresponding contribution was sig-
nificantly lower in 2015/16 (32/237; 14%; p < 0.001) 
and 2013/14 (32/259; 12%; p < 0.001), despite more 
comparable representation among unvaccinated con-
trols across the same mid-season analyses in 2018/19 
(98/623; 16%) compared with 2015/16 (77/454; 17%; 
p = 0.66) and 2013/14 (37/332; 11%; p = 0.04) [3,4]. 
Overall, the median age of unvaccinated influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 cases was lower this season (29 years) 
than in 2015/16 (36 years; p < 0.001) or 2013/14 (35 
years; p < 0.001) [3,4]. These age-related differences 
may reflect a greater proportion of children younger 
than 9 years in the current epidemic who were not yet 
born during prior H1 epidemics – notably the 2009 
pandemic of nine years ago – with fewer opportunities 
to acquire immunity compared to older age groups.
Limitations of the current analysis include its observa-
tional design for which residual bias and confounding 
cannot be ruled out. Sample size was limited in age-
stratified analyses, requiring cautious interpretation. 
In addition, characteristics of the 2018/19 influenza 
season have varied across the northern hemisphere. 
While the season in Canada commenced earlier than in 
recent years [1], notable influenza activity in the US and 
most of Europe was not observed until mid-December 
[14,15]. Further, while influenza A(H3N2) has accounted 
for less than 10% of subtyped A viruses in this study 
and nationally in Canada [1], influenza A(H3N2) has 
predominated in south-eastern regions in the US, and 
co-circulation has been observed in Europe, with influ-
enza A(H3N2) accounting for about one third of sub-
typed influenza A detections [14,15]. It remains to be 
seen how varying virological and participant profiles 
will impact VE estimates elsewhere across the north-
ern hemisphere.
Conclusions
Interim estimates from Canada for the 2018/19 northern 
hemisphere indicate substantial VE of ca 70% against 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Thus far, this epidemic has 
taken a greater toll on children younger than 9 years 
even when compared with previous A(H1N1)pdm09-
dominant seasons. Given ongoing epidemic activity in 
some regions, vaccination should be advocated to min-
imise the A(H1N1)pdm09-associated disease burden. 
In the context of observed genetic diversity, monitoring 
for further evolution in circulating 6B.1 variants, and 
potential impact on vaccine protection, is warranted.
