We have designed and validated a novel generic platform for production of tetravalent IgG1-like chimeric bispecific Abs. The VH-
CH1-hinge domains of mAb2 are fused through a peptidic linker to the N terminus of mAb1 H chain, and paired mutations at the
CH1-CL interface mAb1 are introduced that force the correct pairing of the two different free L chains. Two different sets of these
CH1-CL interface mutations, called CR3 and MUT4, were designed and tested, and prototypic bispecific Abs directed against CD5
and HLA-DR were produced (CD5xDR). Two different hinge sequences between mAb1 and mAb2 were also tested in the CD5xDR-
CR3 or -MUT4 background, leading to bispecific Ab (BsAbs) with a more rigid or flexible structure. All four Abs produced bound
with good specificity and affinity to CD5 and HLA-DR present either on the same target or on different cells. Indeed, the BsAbs were
able to efficiently redirect killing of HLA-DR+ leukemic cells by human CD5+ cytokine-induced killer T cells. Finally, all BsAbs had
a functional Fc, as shown by their capacity to activate human complement and NK cells and to mediate phagocytosis. CD5xDR-
CR3 was chosen as the best format because it had overall the highest functional activity and was very stable in vitro in both
neutral buffer and in serum. In vivo, CD5xDR-CR3 was shown to have significant therapeutic activity in a xenograft model of
human leukemia.

T
herapeutic mAbs have recently shown a great potential in
human cancer treatment (1). However, their activities as
monotherapy are often insufficient to produce a lasting
benefit. Several approaches have been used to enhance their effi-
cacy, the most common being conjugation with toxins or drugs (2)
and the development of bispecific Abs (BsAbs) (3, 4). Indeed,
BsAbs are promising immunotherapy tools that have improved
therapeutic activity through different mechanisms (i.e., by cross-
linking 1) two distinct cell surface Ags presented on the same cell
(normal or malignant), 2) Ags expressed on different cells, a tumor
cell, and an immune cell thus modulating immunity either posi-
tively or negatively, 3) a molecule on a target cell and a soluble
mediator, or 4) two soluble mediators). Furthermore, BsAbs may or
may not have an Fc capable of bridging an FcR bearing effector cell
to the cancer target and of providing greater stability in vivo.
However, BsAbs are difficult to produce and several strategies
have been developed for their generation, including chemical
conjugation (5, 6), fusion of two hybridomas (quadroma) (7) and
more effectively genetic engineering (4, 8). Some of these engi-
neered multispecific Abs result from the fusion of fragment var-
iable (Fv) or single-chain variable fragment (scFv), generating
small molecules lacking Fc, with short serum half life and unable
to activate immune effectors (4). Nonetheless, several of these
BsAb fragments are approved or in advanced clinical trials, such
as the bispecific T cell engagers, designed to redirect T cell on
tumor cells via the binding to CD3 and a tumor surface Ag (9, 10),
the tetravalent tandem diabody (11), and the Dual-Affinity-
RetargeTing (12). Combinations of nanobodies isolated from
camelidae H chain Abs are also used to generate bi- or multi-
specific molecules (13).

 More recently, several designs have in contrast aimed at producing
IgG-like BsAb molecules with a functional Fc domain and greater
stability. These IgG-like bispecific platforms can be either generic,
applicable to any couple of Abs, or nongeneric platforms. The latter
requires a two-in-one approach [i.e., selection of the binding sites that
recognize two different epitopes with a high affinity (14–16)], and
thus, few of these nongeneric platforms have actually been used.
Among generic platforms, some approaches combine the production
of recombinant Ab-derived moieties fused to specific interacting
domains such as the dock-and-lock technology (17) or the Fab-arm
exchange (18). Two types of IgG-like BsAbs can be distinguished,
depending on whether they require dimerization of only one or two
distinct H chains (19, 20). When two different H chains are used,
mutation sets have to be introduced to favor the correct H chain
heterodimerization (21–26). Controlling the correct pairing of the L
chain with its corresponding H chain is also an important issue; this
problem can be circumvented by using a common L chain (27), with
the CrossMab technology (20) or using mutations at the VH/VL and
CH/CL interfaces in Fab fragment (28).
Finally, BsAbs can have different valency. Whereas for some
applications, monovalent binding to each Ag may be sufficient or
advantageous (23, 27, 29), in other cases, the additional avidity or
signaling potential provided by bivalent binding to both Ags is
critical for the Ab biological activities (30–34).
In this paper, we describe an original generic concept allowing
the generation of a new recombinant bispecific Ab format with an
IgG-like structure and presenting tetrameric Ag binding sites.
Materials and Methods
Molecular modeling
We applied the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-
GBSA) approach (35, 36) to search for suitable mutation sites and sets of
mutations that drive correct pairing of mutated H and L chains and to avoid
mispairing. The crystal structure of human IgG1 anti–HIV-1 Ab B12
(Protein Data Bank code 1HZH) was used as a model. After performing
the mutations with the Designer program (37), the systems were mini-
mized using the molecular mechanics simulation package CHARMM
version c31b1 (38) and the CHARMM22 force field (39). All systems
(i.e., wild-type [WT], mutated matched, and mismatched pairs) were set up
for Molecular Dynamics simulation with CHARMM. We also estimated
the theoretical binding free energy (DG) using frames regularly extracted
from the Molecular Dynamics simulation trajectories by applying the MM-
GBSA method to identify residues making suboptimal contribution to the
binding and suitable for mutations.
Cells and virus
The insect Sf9 cell line (ATCC catalog number CRL1711) was maintained
in TC100 medium supplemented with 5% FBS (all from Life Technolo-
gies, St. Aubin, France). WT Autographa californica multiple nuclear
polyhedrosis (AcMNPV) virus clone 1.2 and recombinant baculoviruses
were propagated in Sf9 cells.
The JOK1 5.3 cell line (JOK1 Hairy Cell Leukemia cell lines stably trans-
duced with human CD5 cDNA) has been described previously (40). JOK1 5.3,
REH acute leukemia, MOLT4, and JURKAT T cell leukemias and K562
erythroleukemia cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 2 mM glutamine, 10% FBS (all from Euroclone, Milano, Italy) and 110
mM gentamicin (PHT Pharma, Milan, Italy). Primary chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) samples were obtained after informed consent from un-
treated CLL patients and contained .90% CLL cells in the mononuclear
fraction. The study was approved by the hospital ethical committee.
Construction of baculovirus transfer vectors
Recombinant baculoviruses expressing mutated mouse-human chimeric
monospecific anti-CD5 Abs (chCD5-CR3 and chCD5-MUT4) were con-
structed as previously reported (41). Mutations in the CH and CL domains
of H chain (pVTCg1) and L chain (pVTCK9) transfer vectors were in-
troduced by PCR, using the primers indicated in Supplemental Table I. The
cDNA encoding VH and VL domain of the anti-CD5 Ab were then
inserted in these vectors giving pVTCɣ1anti-CD5mutCR3 (or MUT4) and
pVTCkanti-CD5mutCR3 (or MUT4).
Production of the BsAb requires the synthesis of one fused H chain and
two L chains (Fig. 1). Because the duplication of sequences in baculovirus
(two CH1 domains and two CL domains, both k) generates high genome
instability, two synthetic cDNA were first constructed encoding the CH1-
Hinge (CH19/Hinge 29) and CL (CL9) domains of mAb2, but using al-
ternative codons by hybridization of synthetic overlapping oligonucleo-
tides (Eurogentec, Angers, France).
To generate a fused mAb1-mAb2 H chain, a linker, called A1 and encoding
the amino acid sequence STPPTPSPSGG, was synthesized by hybridization of
two synthetic oligonucleotides and introduced between the C terminus of
mAb2 hinge (Hinge 29) and the N terminus of mAb1 H chain. Similarly
synthetic oligonucleotides were used to generate constructs encoding the
fused H chain bearing two serines instead of cysteines in the hinge
29 sequence. New transfer vector pVTchitcath was constructed to insert
the cDNA encoding the fused–H chains giving pVTchitcath/anti-HLADR/
A1/anti-CD5/Cɣ1mutCR3 and pVTchitcath/anti-HLADR/A1/anti-CD5/
Cɣ1-mutMUT4 and either WT or cysteine-free hinge (CFH)2. In the same
way, the L chain transfer vectors pVTPH/VLanti-CD5/CkmutCR3 and
pVTPH/VLanti-CD5/CkmutMUT4 and pVTgp37/VL anti-HLADR/Ck9
were generated. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
Generation of recombinant viruses
Recombinant baculoviruses expressing WT or mutated chimeric, monospecific
anti-CD5 Abs were obtained as described previously (42). For the construction of
recombinant viruses expressing BsAbs, a new bacmid allowing the insertion of
three genes into the viral genome was used (43), generating a triple-recombinant
baculovirus coexpressing equimolar amount of the 3 chains. Sf9 cells were
cotransfected by lipofection with transfer vectors bearing the cDNA encoding 1)
the fused H chains pVTchitcath/anti-HLADR/A1/anti-CD5/Cɣ1mutCR3 or
MUT4 (WT or CFH), 2) the mAb2 L chain pVTgp37/VL anti-HLADR/CL9,
and 3) the mAb1 L chain pVTPH/VL anti-CD5/CLmutCR3 or pVTPH/VL anti-
CD5/CLmutMUT4 in the presence of purified viral DNA and DOTAP liposomal
transfection reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Recombinant viruses were
isolated by plaque assay, and productive clones were screened by ELISA (44).
The genomic organization of recombinant viruses was controlled by Southern
blotting. Sequence of integrated genes was verified after amplification by PCR
and sequencing (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany).
Production and purification of recombinant mono- or bispecific
Abs
Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 6 3 105 cells/ml in 400 ml serum-free
medium (SF900II; Life Technologies) in roller bottles and infected at a
multiplicity of infection of 2. After 4 d incubation at 28˚C, supernatant was
collected, and secreted recombinant Abs were purified on protein A–
Sepharose (GE HealthCare, Velizy Villacoublay, France). The concentra-
tion of purified Ab was determined using bicinchoninic acid assay,
as recommended by the manufacturer (Perbio, Villebon sur Yvette/
Courtaboeuf, France) using bovine IgG as a standard.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a
Bia3000 apparatus according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GE
Healthcare). Abs were captured on anti-human Fc using Ab human
Capture Kit (GE Healthcare) and different concentrations of soluble
recombinant human CD5 (Life Technologies) were injected. For ki-
netic measurement of anti-HLA-DR Abs, use of immobilized Ag was
found to be optimal. Increasing concentrations of Ab were therefore
injected on biotinylated HLA-DR (TCMetrix Ltd., Epalinges, Swit-
zerland) captured on streptavidin sensor chips. The kinetic constants
were evaluated from the sensorgrams after double-blank subtraction
with BioEvaluation software 3.2 (GE Healthcare) using a Langmuir 1:1
or bivalent fitting model for CD5 or HLA-DR Ag, respectively. For
bispecificity analysis by sandwich-SPR assay, BsAb at 20 nM was
injected on HLA-DR captured as above, followed by soluble CD5 at
120 nM. Controls included buffer instead of BsAb or CD5, to analyze
BsAb dissociation with time. For bispecificity analysis by sequential-
SPR assay, 100 nM CD5 was injected on BsAb captured as above,
followed by 100 nM HLA-DR (or control CD5).
Binding assays
Ab binding to cells was performed by standard flow cytometry, using
1mg/ml primary Ab and a FITC-labeled anti-human Fc Ab (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). In some cases, inhibition experiments were performed by
preincubating cells with increasing amounts of monospecific mouse anti-

 CD5 and/or anti-DR Abs. Samples were analyzed in a FACSScan or
FACSCantoII Instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
Assays for Fc-mediated immune functions
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was performed on JOK1 5.3
cells in the presence of 20% human serum and 10 mg/ml mono- or bispecific
Ab. Cell viability was measured at 6 h with alamar blue vital dye, as
described previously (45).
NK degranulation was used as a surrogate marker of ADCC (45). Briefly
PBMC were plated at 1:1 ratio in presence of JOK1 5.3 cells opsonized with
increasing doses of mono- or bispecific Abs. Percentage CD107a+/CD56+
cells was then measured after 4 h by flow cytometry.
For phagocytosis assays, CLL cells were stained with 0.1 mM CFSE
(Molecular Probes, Thermo Scientific) and incubated with in vitro differenti-
ated human macrophages (46), in the presence or absence of anti-CD5, bis-
pecific, or control Abs. After 2 h incubation at 37˚C, cells were harvested and
stained with CD19-allophycocyanin and CD11b-PE (both BD Biosciences)
and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II; BD Biosciences) (47).
Redirection of T cell cytotoxicity toward a leukemia target
CD5+ cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells were generated from normal
donor peripheral blood as described (48). Target cell lines were loaded
with calcein-AM (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at a 10:1 E:T ratio, in the
presence or absence of 1 mg/ml BsAb. After 4 h at 37˚C, supernatant was
collected, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence plate reader
(FluoroStar Optima, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at 485 excitation
and 520 emission. Results were measured as percentage lysis with respect
to cells lysed with 1% SDS (100% lysis) after background subtraction
(spontaneous calcein release).
In vivo activity
Six- to eight-week-old SCID CB-17 mice (Charles River Breeding Lab-
oratories, Wilmington, MA), were injected i.v. with 10 3 106 JOK1 5.3
cells in PBS (10 mice per group). Mice were tail-vein injected with 0.25
mg CD5xDR-CR3 BsAb, rituximab, or irrelevant IgG1 Ab on days 3, 5, 7,
and 11. Mice were monitored daily for the presence of hind-leg paralysis
and in that case sacrificed. All protocols were approved by the Institutional
Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of Brittany (authorization
b-2005-SL-04) and were performed according to international regulations
regarding animal experiments.
Statistical analyses
In vitro assays were analyzed using Student t tests, as appropriate. For
in vivo data, statistical comparisons between groups were performed us-
ing factorial ANOVA. Normality and homogeneity were evaluated by
Shapiro–Wilk test and the data were found to be valid.
Results
Design of BsAb
A novel chimeric tetravalent IgG1-like BsAb is described that
maintains natural Fab structures of both original mAbs as well as full
human Fc. We chose, as a prototype, to direct the BsAb against
human CD5 (mAb1) and human HLA-DR (mAb2) (Fig. 1). These
specificities give us the opportunity to validate the BsAb activity in
two different contexts, when the two Ags are carried on the same cell
(i.e., JOK1 5.3 leukemia cell line or CLL cells expressing both
HLA-DR and CD5) (40) or on two different cells (i.e., HLA-DR+ B
lymphoma cells and CD5+ T-lymphocytes). The BsAb is composed
of a fused H chain, carrying VH-CH1 domains of mAb1 fused in
tandem with the VH-CH1-Hinge domains of mAb2 through a pep-
tide linker. The two different mAb1 and mAb2 L chains (both k) in
contrast are free (Fig. 1).
To achieve correct pairing of the two light chains to their corre-
sponding mAb1 and mAb2 VH-CH domains, we introduced mutations
in the CH1 and CL interface of mAb1 (Fig. 1). With the help of three-
dimensional structure modeling and energetic considerations, two
rational modifications were proposed, the so-called charged residues
and hydrophobicity-polarity-swap.
In the charged residues option, the exchange of a pair of interacting
polar interface residues for a pair of neutral and salt bridge forming
residues was introduced. The formation of a salt bridge can reinforce
the specificity of the association, whereas an unwanted pairing should
be avoided by the lack of sterical and charge complementarity be-
tween the WTand variant chains. After extensive in silico testing, the
replacement of Thr192 by a Glu on CH1 chain and exchange of
FIGURE 1.

The mutated BsAbs are presented in two formats, one with unmodified hinge 2, containing two disulfide bridges (WT hinge 2), and one with additional
mutations replacing two cysteines of hinge 2 with serines, resulting in a more flexible format (cysteine-free hinge 2). (B) Structural modeling of the

 Asn137 to a Lys on CL chain was chosen. These two mutated resi-
dues form a salt bridge. In addition, a substitution of Ser114 to Ala on
CL chain was made to avoid steric clashes with a bigger lysine side
chain (Fig. 2A). This mutant was named CR3 and its predicted three-
dimensional structure is shown in Fig. 2B.
For the hydrophobicity-polarity-swap strategy, a double mutation
was introduced on each chain: a pair of interacting apolar residues
is exchanged for a pair of polar amino acids, whereas a pair of
interacting polar residues is simultaneously exchanged for a pair
of hydrophobic residues. After in silico testing of many potential
mutations, we chose to replace the Leu143 of the CH1 domain by a
Gln residue, whereas the facing residue of the CL chain (i.e., Val133)
was replaced by a Thr residue (hydrophobic to polar switch). Si-
multaneously, two interacting serine residues (Ser188 on CH1 chain
and Ser176 on CL chain) were swapped with valine residues (polar
to hydrophobic switch) (Fig. 2A). This mutant was named MUT4
and its predicted three-dimensional structure shown in Fig. 2C.
After initial testing with the Designer program (37), the binding
free energies of mutated complexes, either correctly paired as well
mispaired, were evaluated using the MM-GBSA method. For both
CR3 and MUT4 proposed mutations, the complex between the
modified CL and CH1 chains was estimated to be as stable as
the WT complex, whereas significantly unfavorable interactions in
the mispaired complexes were predicted. Indeed, the difference of
cumulative contribution to the interaction energy of mutated res-
idues in the properly paired and mispaired complexes was 2.0
kcal/mol in the case of hydrophobicity-polarity-swap mutant and
5.4 kcal/mol in the case of charged residues mutant.
Validation of CR3 and MUT4 mutations in mAb1
To verify the quality of the designed CR3 and MUT4 mutations
(i.e., correct pairing and maintenance of Fc functionality of mutated
IgG1 H and L chains), we introduced these mutations in the anti-
CD5 human-mouse chimeric mAb (chCD5, mAb1) (40), using
baculovirus vectors for expression in insect cells. Glycoproteins
produced in this system are functional and recombinant Abs can
exhibit all effectors functions (42). Through PCR, the correct
mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding the CH1 and
CL domains of anti-CD5. Recombinant baculoviruses were then
generated after cotransfection of Sf9 cells with DNA from a de-
fective baculovirus (BacMid) and the H and L chain transfer
vectors. WT and mutant Abs were purified on protein A–
Sepharose and analyzed 1) by SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-
reducing conditions and 2) by size-exclusion chromatography. As
shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, both mutants showed the expected
migration patterns.

 Biacore binding assays showed that affinity of WT and mutant
chCD5 for the recombinant Ag was very high in all cases (KD
ranging from 3.3 to 3.7 3 10212 M, very close to the apparatus
limit; Table I and data not shown). Binding to natural CD5
expressed on the cell surface of the JOK1 5.3 cell line showed a
similar dose response curve for WT and mutant Abs (Fig. 3C). All
these data suggest correct folding of the Fab portion of anti-CD5,
even in the presence of CR3 or MUT4 mutations.
We also verified whether the CR3 and MUT4 mutations affected
the Fc-mediated functional activity of anti-CD5 chimeric Ab.
Neither WT nor the mutant anti-CD5 Abs induced CDC in the
presence of JOK1 5.3 cell line and human serum (Fig. 3D). In
contrast, NK cell degranulation, as shown by induction of CD107a
on CD56+ cells, a surrogate marker of ADCC (Fig. 3E) (45), as
well as macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of CD5+ CLL target
cells was induced to a similar extent by both WT or mutant anti-
CD5 Abs (Fig. 3F).
Altogether, these data suggest that Fc function is unaltered by the
mutations introduced in the chimeric anti-CD5 Ab CH1-CL do-
main. We have similarly mutated other chimeric Abs without any
significant effect on Ag binding or Fc function (data not shown).
Production and characterization of CD5xDR BsAbs
The construction of the tetravalent BsAb directed against CD5 and
HLA-DR (CD5xDR) was based on either the CR3 or the MUT4
format in its anti-CD5 portion (mAb1). The BsAb contained a fused
H chain carrying the VH-CH1 domains from mAb1 (anti-CD5)
linked in tandem to the VH-CH1-Hinge domains of mAb2
(anti–HLA-DR). For the fusion, we chose a semirigid peptide
linker (A1) STPPTPSPSGG, inserted downstream from hinge
sequence (Hinge 2) of mAb2 (Fig. 4A). The fused H chain was
thus composed of the following domains (from N to C terminus):

 each construct was used for the production-purification steps. BsAb
production levels were similar to those observed during the pro-
duction of monospecific Abs (10–15 mg/l at low cell density). In
both cases, the size of the fused-H chain and light chains in SDS-
PAGE corresponded to the calculated molecular mass: 78 and 25
kDa, respectively (Fig. 4C). Size-exclusion chromatography on
Superose 6 indicated that only one molecule with the expected
molecular mass (260 kDa calculated molecular mass) was produced,
suggesting correct pairing with the light chains (Fig. 4D).
We next verified the binding specificity of the CD5xDR-CR3 and
CD5xDR-MUT4 BsAbs on CD5 and HLA-DR–positive or –nega-
tive cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5A (lower panels), both BsAbs
were able to specifically bind to the CD5 or HLA-DR single or
double positive cell lines but not to the negative ones, demonstrat-
ing that both Ags were recognized. Furthermore we investigated
whether each BsAb molecule could bind to both Ags, using a CD5/
HLA-DR double-positive CLL cells and cross-blocking each Ag
with mouse anti-CD5 and anti-DR. As shown in Fig. 5B (left two
panels), a marked decrease of BsAb binding to CD5+DR+ CLL cells
took place only in the presence of excess of both mouse anti-CD5
and mouse anti-DR, indicating that both these Ags are bound by the
same BsAb molecules. There were no significant differences be-
tween the CR3 and MUT4 versions of BsAbs (Fig. 5B).
To investigate whether the CD5xDR BsAbs could bind to the
two Ags on two different cells, we performed redirected cyto-
toxicity assays with cytotoxic CD5+ T cells and DR+ targets cells. As
effector T cells, we used the well characterized CIK cells (48, 49).
The DR+ cell line JOK1 5.3 and the primary lymphoma cells
DLBCL-PER were used as targets and the DR-negative cell line
JURKAT as negative control. As shown in Fig. 5C, both CD5xDR
BsAbs were able to redirect killing of CIK toward HLA-DR–
positive cells. Cell killing was efficient with up to 70% cytotox-
icity observed at a 10:1 E:T ratio. In contrast, BsABs did not
increase significantly the background cytotoxicity directed against
the HLA-DR–negative JURKAT cell line. These results demon-
strate that the BsAbs can redirect CD5+ CIK cells toward DR+
targets and therefore bind the two Ags on different cells. There
was no significant difference between the CR3 and MUT4 ver-
sions of CDxDR BsAbs (Fig. 5C).
In addition, we measured avidity of the CD5xDR-CR3 bispecific
Ab on native Ags compared with the parent chimeric monospecific
Abs. For this purpose, binding of the chimeric Abs to CD5+DR+
CLL cells was inhibited by increasing amounts of combined
mouse anti-CD5 and anti-DR Abs. Fifty-percent inhibition of
CD5xDR-CR3 binding (IC50) was observed with ∼8 nM mouse
Abs, compared with an IC50 of 0.7 and 3 nM for chCD5 and chDR
binding, respectively (Fig. 5D). This shows that the avidity of the
tetravalent BsAb CD5xDR-CR3 for native Ags is higher than that
of the corresponding monospecific bivalent mAbs.
Finally, we analyzed binding of the CD5xDR-CR3 BsAb on the
two Ags by SPR. Binding to both recombinant CD5 and HLA-DR
could be demonstrated using sequential assays as well as sandwich
assay (Fig. 6). The latter further proves simultaneous binding of
both Ags by the same BsAb.
Generation of cysteine-free hinge mutants and comparison of
binding affinity by SPR
Because the hinge of mAb2 (called hinge 2) contains a couple of
cysteines that mediate dimerization of the IgG H chains, creating a
relatively rigid and closed structure of the BsAb (Fig. 1), we also
constructed two additional modified CD5xDR BsAbs, in which
the pair of cysteines in hinge 2 were replaced by two serines, on
the same CD5xDR-CR3 or -MUT4 formats described above.
These potentially more flexible BsAbs with CFHs were called
CD5xDR-CR3-CFH, CD5xDR-MUT4-CFH. These new BsAb
formats were produced and purified, yielding the equivalent size
and purity of protein as the hinge WT versions of the Ab. Yield
was ∼10 mg/l at low density (data not shown).
Binding kinetics and affinities of the different BsAbs were first
analyzed by SPR against soluble CD5 and compared with that of
the corresponding monospecific Abs. The BsAbs showed lower af-
finity for CD5 compared with the monospecific Abs, mostly because
of a higher dissociation rate (Table I). Comparison of the CR3 with
MUT4 BsAbs showed that the kinetic constants and affinities of the
two versions for CD5 were very similar, with only a slightly more
favorable dissociation rate and binding affinity of CR3 compared with
MUT4 BsAbs (Table I). The different hinges in the BsAbs (containing
cysteines or not) did not affect binding to CD5. The affinity constants
of all BsAb (KD) were quite high in all cases (1029–10210M), sug-
gesting proper folding of these molecules (Table I).
The binding constants of the chimeric anti-DR mAb and of BsAb
CD5xDR-CR3 for recombinant HLA-DR was also analyzed by
SPR. The affinity of BsAb for HLA-DR was very similar to that of
the parent Ab (Table I).
Comparison of biological activities of all four BsAbs
constructs
We next compared the binding of allfour BsAb formats to the CD5+DR+
JOK1 5.3 cell line. Dose-response curves demonstrated that CD5xDR-
CR3 and CD5xDR-MUT4 have a similar binding affinity, whereas CFH
versions of the same BsAbs showed slightly lower binding at all doses
(p , 0.05 and p , 0.01 for CR3 and MUT4, respectively; Fig. 7A).

 We also analyzed the Fc-mediated functional activities of all
four BsAb formats. All BsAbs were strong inducers of CDC, but
the CFH versions were slightly less effective than the hinge 2 WT
versions of BsAbs, with ∼75% lysis compared with 95%, re-
spectively (Fig. 7B). This difference was significant for both the
CR3 and MUT4 formats (p , 0.05 and , 0.001, respectively).
All BsAbs were able to induce NK cell degranulation. We did
not observe a significant difference between the different Abs
(Fig. 7C). Finally, we analyzed the capacity of all four BsAb
formats to mediate phagocytosis of CD5+DR+ CLL cells by
macrophages. As shown in Fig. 7D, all four BsAbs mediated
significant phagocytosis at 0.1–1 mg/ml BsAb.
Stability of CD5xDR-CR3 and activity in vivo
To investigate the therapeutic activity of BsAbs in vivo, we selected
the CD5xDR-CR3 format, this being the most consistently active
format for binding and functional effects in vitro (Fig.7, Table I).
Furthermore, this format was found to be very stable in vitro even
upon long-term storage. Indeed, size-exclusion chromatography

 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) showed that little aggregation or
degradation of the protein had taken place (Fig. 8A). In confir-
mation of these findings, CD5xDR-CR3 was functionally fully
active even after months of storage at 4˚C (JG, data not shown).
We also investigated the stability of CD5xDR-CR3 in vitro when
incubated at 37˚C in 100% mouse serum for 2–15 d. CD5xDR-
CR3 maintained ∼86, 70, and 62% binding capacity after 2, 9,

 stability of the molecule even in these more physiological
conditions.
We finally analyzed the therapeutic activity of CD5xDR-CR3
against a CD5+DR+ leukemia target (JOK1 5.3). Tumor cells
were inoculated i.v., and 0.25 mg BsAb CD5xDR-CR3 was given
i.v. on days 3, 5, 7, and 11. BsAb treatment led to a 15 d delay in
median survival time, compared with untreated controls (35 versus
20 d, respectively) (p , 0.001) (Fig. 8B). Furthermore BsAb was
more effective than rituximab given at the same dose (median
survival time 31 d; p , 0.05).
In conclusion, the generic platform described allows production
of novel tetravalent BsAb format with therapeutic activity in an
in vivo model of leukemia. A patent for this platform has been
published (Multispecific antibodies. European patent application
PCT/IB2012/053482, Publication No. WO2013005194 A2. 2013
Jan 10).
Discussion
An original platform is described that allows the synthesis of an
IgG1-like bispecific tetravalent Ab molecule, carrying a complete
and functional Fc. The technology consists in the introduction of
paired mutations at the CH1-CL interface of a first human IgG1
Ab (mAb1), and fusing the VH-CH1 sequence of a second Ab
(mAb2) at the N terminus of the H chain of the first Ab. The
mAb1 CH1-CL mutations force the correct binding of the two
different free light chains (CL-VL) to their respective VH-CH1
domains. Two different sets of CH1-CL interface mutations were
tested in this study, called CR3 and MUT4, as well as two dif-
ferent hinge sequences separating the two mAbs, on a prototype
CD5xDR BsAb.
The fusion of the VH-CH1 domains of mAb2 to the H chain of
mAb1 is realized via a peptide linker. We have observed that the
natural semiflexible A1 linker STPPTPSPSGG, placed downstream
of hinge 2 sequence, conserved a full binding activity of BsAb
toward soluble human CD5. Moreover, this linker is a part of the
human IgA natural hinge sequence, which may also minimize the
immunogenicity of the molecule.
The specific pairing between the mAb1 and mAb2 VH-CH1
domains and their corresponding L chains (CL/VL domains) was
favored and stabilized by the introduction of mutations at the CH-CL
interface in one of these Fab (mAb1), the other one being non-
mutated (mAb2). Two mutational approaches have been chosen
and designed in silico: 1) a charged residues approach (CR3 mutant)
and 2) a hydrophobicity-polarity swap strategy (MUT4 mutant).
Production of mutated anti-CD5 monospecific and CD5xDR bispecific
Abs has demonstrated that these mutations do not affect the structure
and the properties of the recombinant molecules. The two mutations
did not differ significantly with each other in terms of specificity and
affinity for CD5, specificity for HLA-DR or Fc functions.
In particular, binding affinity and dissociation constants to CD5
and HLA-DR were measured by SPR. Affinity of BsAbs was lower
than that of monospecific anti-CD5 mAb, mostly because of higher
dissociation rate. This phenomenon is probably induced by steric
hindrance of mAb1 Fab, positioned internally in the bispecific
molecule. Similar, albeit smaller decreases in affinity have already
been reported for other BsAb formats (19, 50). Also worth noting is
that the affinity for CD5 of all BsAbs tested in this study was in
the 1029–10210 range, which is within that observed for several
other therapeutic Abs. The affinity for HLA-DR was very similar
between the BsAb CR3 format compared with monospecific anti-
DR Ab, suggesting correct overall folding of the molecule.

largement of the indicated portion of the curves, after subtraction of the buffer curve, which better illustrates the binding of CD5 to the BsAb.

 Interestingly, the CD5xDR-CR3 and -MUT4 BsAbs were shown by
cross-blocking experiments to bind specifically to the two different
Ags expressed by the same target cell (cis binding to a CD5+HLA-DR+
CLL target). They were also shown to bind specifically to the Ags
expressed by two different cells (trans binding to two different cel-
lular targets), since they were able to very efficiently redirect CD5+
CIK cells to kill HLA-DR+ targets, with up to 70% lysis obtained at a
10:1 E:T ratio. In this context, it is worth noting that the CD5+ cell
line JURKAT was not killed by CD5+ CIK cells in presence of
BsAbs, showing that the effector has to express a different Ags (CD5)
than the target (HLA-DR) for killing to occur. This is likely because
of the anti-CD5 and anti-DR Fabs are placed relatively close to each
other, allowing to bring the effector CD5+ T cells close to the DR+
target. Indeed, the distance between effector and target is thought to
be an important parameter for redirected cell killing (51). This
specificity of killing by our BsAb is an advantage, since it allows to
identify different Ag pairs on effectors and targets, to redirect dif-
ferent killer cells to different cancer cells. Binding to the two Ags by
the same CD5xDR-CR3 BsAb molecule was also demonstrated by
both sequential and sandwich SPR.
The Fc portions of the different BsAbs tested in this study were
fully functional in all cases and capable of mediating CDC, NK
activation, as well as phagocytosis of CLL targets by macrophages.
Interestingly, the CD5xDR BsAb has inherited the capacity of the
monospecific recombinant anti–HLA-DR Ab to induce CDC be-
cause no CDC could be detected with the monospecific recombinant
anti-CD5 Ab in the same experimental conditions. This may be due
in part to higher binding of BsAb compared with anti-CD5 mAb,
due to greater expression levels of HLA-DR compared with CD5.
Because the presence of disulfide bridges in the hinge 2 se-
quence between mAb1 and mAb2 may have imposed a relatively
rigid structure, with consequent steric hindrance and reduced
binding of mAb1 to CD5, we also produced two further CD5xDR
BsAb molecules in which the hinge 2 cysteine residues were mu-
tated to serine. These CFH BsAbs showed very similar properties
with respect to their cysteine containing counterparts, for ex-
ample equivalent binding to soluble CD5, as well as similar
cell- and Fc-mediated activities (NK degranulation, phagocy-
tosis). However CDC was reduced in the CFH formats, per-
haps due to a different overall three-dimensional structure of the
molecules.
Stability and aggregation are often major problems in the BsAb
field because many of the molecules containing scFv or Fv domains
are unstable in vitro or in vivo (i.e., proteolytic cleavage, incom-
plete disulfide bonds leading to partially assembled molecules)
(50, 52, 53). Several strategies have been developed to stabilize
these molecules, such as addition of disulfide bridges (54). Inter-
estingly, the CD5xDR-CR3 molecule was very stable upon long-
term storage in vitro at 4˚C, with little formation of aggregates or
degradation. It was also stable in physiological conditions, with
62% Ag binding activity maintained after 15-d incubation in
mouse serum at 37˚C. Finally, the in vivo experiments in mice
showed that the molecule is fully functional in vivo, indicating
that the molecule is stable and can activate immune-mediated
mechanisms in vivo. Our platform based on natural Fab do-
mains and WT hinges may be at the basis of the good stability,
limited aggregation and in vivo functionality of the CD5xDR-CR3
format observed in this study.

A NOVEL TETRAVALENT BsAb FORMAT

 Few other platforms have been published that allow production
of tetravalent IgG1-like molecules. Most of the other platforms
make use of scFv or nanobodies linked at the N or C terminus
of the L or H chains (4). scFvs often show reduced affinity/
specificity compared with their parental Ab and their linking
to other chains may further reduce their affinity or that of the Ab
to which they are linked (32). ScFv, like nanobodies, may also
show higher immunogenicity (55). Our format in contrast
maintains the full structure of Fab, helping with affinity and a
decrease in immunogenicity. Recently, a similar approach of
modifying CH1-CL interface was taken by another group, who
modified the disulphide bonds within these domains to favor
correct pairing of each L chain to the proper H chain. This
modification was, however, performed in the context of a bi-
valent, not tetravalent molecule (29).
The bispecific platform described is generic and can be applied to
any Ab couple. Indeed, novel BsAbs based on this platform have
already been successfully generated with specificities other than
CD5 and HLA-DR (M. Duonor-Ce
´rutti, unpublished observations).
Because the platform relies on mutations introduced in the constant
domains of CH1 and CL, it allows the rapid cloning of variable
domains of different Abs into preformed cassettes, without the need
for selection of best mutants in each case. The BsAbs produced are
easily purified on protein A–Sepharose columns like standard IgGs.
Furthermore, the tetravalency of the BsAbs presented in this paper
may have many advantages, at least for some applications: 1) a gain
of avidity/specificity, for example for target cells expressing both
Ags, as shown in this paper; 2) improved apoptosis induction or
growth arrest by cross-linking two different proapoptotic Ags or
growth promoting molecules; and 3) the possibility to efficiently and
specifically redirect immune effector cells (CIK, NK, T cells, mac-
rophages) toward neoplastic targets. Finally, the fully functional Fc
portion, in addition to greater stability, may add further immune
mediated properties such as CDC, ADCC, phagocytosis, as shown
in this study. Nonetheless, we have not compared our tetravalent
molecules with bivalent or other tetravalent bispecific formats. So we
cannot know at the present time whether this approach would be
more efficient or effective than existing platforms.
The choice of the BsAb format (bi- or tetravalent, Fc bearing or
not) will clearly depend on the specific application. Although Fc-
mediated activities have been thought to be a disadvantage for
some anticancer BsAbs because they could induce killing of ef-
fector cells, our data suggest that this is not the case for our BsAb,
which does not mediate killing of CD5+ effector cells. Further-
more, other BsAbs formats with highly effective Fc, like the
CD3xEpCAM or CD3xCD20 TrioMabs (56, 57), have reached the
clinic and appear to have very interesting clinical activities in vivo.
Further work will be required in vitro and in vivo, to investigate the
advantage of maintaining a fully functional Fc in our BsAb format,
according to the specific targets chosen. If necessary, an Fc unable
to bind to FcɣRs, or on the contrary, an Ab more active in binding
specific FcɣRs could also be designed on our platform through point
mutations or glycoengineering (58). Finally, the technology pre-
sented in this study is also applicable to the production of tetrava-
lent monospecific Abs, which could be highly efficient in the
clustering of membrane receptors thus enhancing the Ab efficiency,
as demonstrated with multivalent anti-CD20 (31, 59, 60).
