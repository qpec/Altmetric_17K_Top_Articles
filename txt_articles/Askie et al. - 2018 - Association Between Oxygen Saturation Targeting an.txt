Key Points  
Question: For extremely preterm infants, does targeting a lower oxygen saturation (85-89%) compared 
with a higher saturation (91-95%) result in a difference in death or major disability by 24 months’ 
corrected age? 
Findings: In a prospective meta-analysis of 4965 infants from five randomized clinical trials, there was no 
significant difference in the primary composite outcome of death or major disability between those 
treated with lower vs higher oxygen saturations (53.5% vs 51.6%). Lower oxygen targets were associated 
with increased death and necrotizing enterocolitis but reduced retinopathy of prematurity treatment. 
Meaning: Among extremely preterm infants, there was no significant difference between lower and 
higher oxygen saturation targets on a composite of death or major disability; secondary endpoints may 
need to be considered in decision-making.

Abstract  
Importance: There are potential benefits and harms of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia for extremely 
preterm infants receiving more or less supplemental oxygen.  
Objective: To compare the effects of different pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) target ranges on 
death or major morbidity.  
Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospectively planned, individual participant data meta-analysis of 
five randomized clinical trials (conducted 2005-2014), enrolling infants born at less than 28 weeks’ 
gestation. 
Exposure: Targeting a lower (85-89%) versus higher (91-95%) SpO2 range. 
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of death or major disability by 
18-24 months’ corrected age (bilateral blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy with the Gross Motor 
Function Classification System (GMFCS) level 2 or higher, or Bayley-III cognitive or language score less 
than 85). There were 16 secondary outcomes including death, major disability, retinopathy of 
prematurity (ROP) requiring treatment, blindness, severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 
Results: 4965 infants were randomized (2480 lower, 2485 higher): median gestational age 26 (IQR 25-
27) weeks, mean birthweight 832 (SD 190) grams. The primary outcome occurred in 1191/2228 (53.5%) 
lower target and 1150/2229 (51.6%) higher target infants, Risk Difference (RD) 1.7%, 95% Confidence 
Interval (CI) -1.3–4.6%; Relative Risk (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.98–1.09; P=0.21. Of the 16 secondary outcomes, 
11 were null, 2 significantly favored lower oxygen saturation, and 3 significantly favored higher oxygen 
saturation. Death occurred in 484/2433 (19.9%) lower target and 418/2440 (17.1%) higher target 
infants, RD 2.8% (0.6–5.0%), RR 1.17 (1.04–1.31), P=0.01. ROP treatment was administered to 220/2020 
(10.9%) lower target and 308/2065 (14.9%) higher target infants, RD -4.0% (-6.1–-2.0%), RR 0.74 (0.63–
 6 
 
0.86), P<0.001. Severe NEC occurred in 227/2464 (9.2%) lower target and 170/2465 (6.9%) higher target 
infants, RD 2.3% (0.8–3.8%), RR 1.33 (1.10–1.61), P=0.003.  
Conclusions and Relevance:  In this prospectively planned meta-analysis involving extremely preterm 
infants, there was no significant difference between targeting lower compared with higher oxygen 
saturation on the primary composite outcome of death or major disability at 18-24 months’ corrected 
age.  There were significant differences favoring the higher oxygen target for death and for NEC, but 
favoring the lower oxygen target for ROP.

Introduction  
Oxygen has been used in nurseries for over 70 years. In the 1950s it was shown that administering 
unrestricted oxygen to preterm infants significantly increased their risk of severe retinopathy of 
prematurity (ROP).1 Pulse oximetry, which non-invasively estimates arterial oxygen saturation (SpO₂), is 
now almost universal in neonatal intensive care units. Lower oxygen levels (targeting SpO₂ at 90% or 
less) may reduce ROP,2 whilst no studies predating the current investigations demonstrated impaired 
neurodevelopment or an increased risk of death.1,3 Higher oxygen levels (targeting SpO₂ greater than 
90%) may increase adverse pulmonary sequelae at SpO2 levels above 95% when tested in infants who 
remained oxygen dependent many weeks after birth.4,5 
A total sample size of approximately 5000 infants was required to detect the small but clinically 
important hypothesized difference of 4% in the primary outcome of death or major disability between 
lower and higher SpO2 target ranges. In order to achieve this, the Neonatal Oxygenation Prospective 
Meta-analysis (NeOProM) Collaboration was formed in 20036 with the investigators from five separate 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) prospectively planning to undertake their individual trials using similar 
study designs, participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes, and agreeing to provide 
individual participant data upon trial completion for inclusion in a meta-analysis.  
 
Methods  
Data Sources and Search Strategy  
The NeOProM Collaboration was a prospectively planned, individual participant data meta-analysis of 
five trial groups in the USA (Surfactant, Positive Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial - 
SUPPORT 2005-11),7 Canada (Canadian Oxygen Trial - COT 2006-12),8 New Zealand (Benefits Of Oxygen 
 8 
 
Saturation Targeting New Zealand - BOOST-NZ 2006-12),9 United Kingdom (Benefits Of Oxygen 
Saturation Targeting II United Kingdom - BOOST-II UK 2007-14),10 and Australia (Benefits Of Oxygen 
Saturation Targeting II Australia - BOOST-II AUS 2006-13).11 These studies were considered eligible for 
inclusion in the meta-analysis prior to the results of any of the trials being known.12 A study protocol was 
agreed and published13 in January 2011, registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and a statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) agreed in September 2015 (see Supplement 1). The conduct of each trial was approved by the 
relevant Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees and written informed consent was obtained 
from participating parents. 
Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria  
All five studies14-19 were randomized, double-blind, multi-center trials with infants eligible if they were 
born before 28 weeks’ gestation and enrolled within 24 hours of birth. Infants were randomized within 
each trial to target either a lower (85%-89%) or higher (91%-95%) SpO2 range. To ensure that parents, 
care-givers and outcome assessors remained masked to treatment allocation, each trial used Masimo 
pulse oximeters that had been modified to display and store oxygen saturations between 88% and 92% 
that were either 3% above or below the actual values. True values were displayed if the actual SpO2 
decreased below 84% or increased above 96%. Caregivers were instructed to adjust the concentration of 
inspired oxygen to maintain the displayed SpO2 between 88% and 92%, thus producing two treatment 
groups with actual target saturations of either 85% to 89%, or 91% to 95% (see Supplement 2, eFigure 
1). During the trials an artefact was identified in the calibration software of the oximeters that had the 
potential to influence the achieved oxygen saturation patterns.20 Three of the trials (BOOST-II UK, 
BOOST-II Australia and COT) changed their oximeters to incorporate revised oximeter software. On 
advice from their Data and Safety Monitoring Committees, two trials (BOOST-II UK and Australia) were 
terminated by their respective Trial Steering Committees after a pooled interim analysis of mortality 
 9 
 
data, subgrouped by oximeter software type, was undertaken21 when 81% and 95% of their target 
samples, respectively, had been achieved.  
Data Extraction  
 
A list of requested variables was sent to each trial group based on the agreed (in September 2015) SAP 
prior to the sharing of any individual participant data for use in the combined meta-analysis. These 
variables included randomization and baseline characteristics (including subgroup variables), in-hospital 
and 18-24 month follow-up information from individual participants (see Supplement 2 for the full list of 
pre-specified variables). De-identified data were provided by the trial groups between March and April 
2016. Data were checked for accuracy with published reports, trial protocols and data collection sheets. 
Inconsistencies were discussed with individual investigators and discrepancies resolved by consensus.  
Each trial verified its own finalized dataset prior to inclusion in the study database.  
Key Outcome Definitions 
The primary outcome was a composite of death or major disability at 18-24 months’ corrected age. 
Major disability comprised any of the following: Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 
version 322 (Bayley-III) cognitive score <85 or language score <85; severe visual loss (cannot fixate or is 
legally blind with visual acuity <6/60 in both eyes); cerebral palsy with the Gross Motor Function 
Classification System  level 2 or higher;23 or deafness requiring hearing aids. When a Bayley-III 
assessment was unavailable, some trials used alternative sources of information for classifying cognitive 
delay, such as a Bayley-II Mental Developmental Index score <70, or another validated assessment tool 
(e.g. Griffiths test), or a pediatric assessment, or a parent-reported measure of neurodevelopmental 
impairment (e.g. able to speak fewer than 5-10 words). To assess the effects of inclusion of these 
alternate measures of disability, a pre-specified supportive analysis of the primary outcome was also 
undertaken (see Figure 1 footnote and Supplement 2, page 4).   
 10 
 
Secondary outcomes were: the components of the primary outcome (death prior to 24 months’ 
corrected age; major disability); death prior to 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age; death prior to hospital 
discharge; the individual components of the major disability outcome (developmental delay, severe 
visual impairment, deafness, cerebral palsy); ROP treated by laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, or 
anti- vascular endothelial growth factor injection in one or both eyes; severe necrotizing enterocolitis 
(NEC leading to abdominal surgery or death); oxygen treatment at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age; 
postmenstrual age when each of the following respiratory support measures ceased: endotracheal 
intubation, continuous positive airway pressure, oxygen treatment, or home oxygen (if received); patent 
ductus arteriosus (PDA) diagnosed by ultrasound and receiving any treatment; PDA receiving surgical 
treatment; weight z-scores at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, at discharge home, and at 18-24 months’ 
corrected age; one or more re-admissions to hospital by 18-24 months’ corrected age; and time to 
death. 
Assessing the Risk of Bias  
The five trials were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration domains24 and consensus 
reached via discussion with the full study group.  
Statistical Analysis  
The pre-planned total sample size was 5230 infants. Because two trials stopped early, an individual 
participant data meta-analysis was undertaken of the 4965 infants recruited overall, which provided 
approximately 80% power (with a two-sided p-value of 0.05) to detect a minimum absolute risk 
difference of 4% in the primary composite outcome of death or major disability by 18-24 months’ 
corrected age, corresponding to a minimally important number-needed-to-treat of 25 to prevent one 
major adverse outcome.13 This minimal difference was derived via discussion with clinical experts, no 
formal assessments were undertaken. 
 11 
 
Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis using all data from each trial included in a single 
model. The I2 statistic25 was used to assess heterogeneity for all primary and secondary outcomes. No 
statistical methods were used to deal with the small proportion of missing data, but sensitivity analyses 
were undertaken for the primary outcome by using alternative measures of disability when Bayley-III 
outcomes were missing (see Figure 2 footnote for ‘Supportive analysis’ definitions). Binary endpoints 
were analyzed using log binomial regression in a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with an 
exchangeable correlation structure to account for multiple births. Models were adjusted for trial as a 
fixed effect as the prospective meta-analysis methodology meant all five trials were very similar with 
respect to their included participants, interventions and outcome definitions. Sensitivity analyses using 
random effects models were also undertaken. Results were presented as risk differences (RD) and 
relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and two-sided p-values. If these models failed to 
converge, Poisson models with a robust variance estimator were used. Continuous outcomes were 
analyzed using linear regression in GEE models and presented as mean differences. Time to death was 
assessed between treatment groups using proportional hazard models and displayed using Kaplan-
Meier survival curves.26 Relative risks and hazard ratios were computed such that values greater than 1 
favoured the higher target group. Subgroup analyses (gestational age (<26 weeks vs ≥26 weeks), inborn 
or outborn, use of any antenatal corticosteroids, sex, small for gestational age (SGA, <10th percentile), 
multiple birth, mode of delivery, time of intervention commencement (<6 hours vs ≥6 hours after birth), 
type of oximeter software (original vs revised)) were pre-specified and performed for primary and 
secondary outcomes by including a treatment-by-subgroup interaction term in the model. Two-sided p-
values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance, with no adjustment for multiple 
comparisons. Thus pre-specified secondary outcomes were interpreted cautiously (recognising the 
potential for Type I error) and subgroup analyses considered exploratory. Analyses were performed 
using SAS version 9.3.

Results  
Study Identification and Selection  
Data from the five included trials were collected and synthesized centrally following publication of the 
main results of all trials. Characteristics of the five studies are included in Supplement 1, eTable 1. 
Individual participant data (IPD) from 4965 infants (2480 randomized to the lower, 2485 to the higher 
target range), with a median gestational age of 26 (IQR 25-27) weeks and a mean birthweight of 832 (SD 
120) grams, were meta-analyzed. Baseline characteristics of each of the included trials and the 
combined data are described in Table 1. Data were available for 90% of infants for the protocol-defined 
primary outcome, and for 95% of infants for the pre-specified supportive analysis of the primary 
outcome which used alternate measures of cognitive disability (Figure 1).  
Primary outcome results 
There was no significant difference between targeting a lower SpO2 range (85-89%) compared with 
targeting a higher SpO2 range (91-95%) on the primary composite outcome of death or major disability 
at 18-24 months’ corrected age (lower 53.5%, higher 51.6%; RD 1.7%, 95% CI -1.3–4.6%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 
0.98–1.09; p=0.21; I2=14%; Figure 2). A supportive analysis of the primary outcome, which included 
alternate measures of disability, also showed no significant difference in the rate of death or major 
disability between the two groups (RD 1.7%, 95% CI -1.2–4.5%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98–1.09; p=0.20; 
I2=27%; Figure 2).  
Secondary outcome results 
Of the 16 secondary outcomes, 11 were null, 2 significantly favored lower oxygen saturation, and 3 
significantly favored higher oxygen saturation. An analysis of each component of the primary outcome 
(Figure 2) showed that targeting the lower SpO2 range was associated with a significantly increased 
 13 
 
incidence of death at 18-24 months’ corrected age (RD 2.8%, 95% CI 0.6–5.0%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04–
1.31; p=0.01; I2=0%), but not other components including severe visual impairment (RD 0.1%, 95% CI -
0.6–0.8%; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60–2.08; p=0.73; I2=0%). Survival analysis also showed a significant increase 
in risk of death by 18-24 months for the lower target group (Hazard Ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.03–1.34; 
p=0.02; see Supplement 2, eTable 2 and eFigure 2).  
Results of other secondary outcomes are listed in Figure 3. These show infants in the lower target group 
had an increase in death at other time points (36 weeks’ postmenstrual age and hospital discharge), 
severe NEC, and PDA treated with surgical ligation, but a lower rate of ROP receiving treatment and 
oxygen treatment at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age. There were no significant differences between the 
two groups for other secondary outcomes (Figure 2). 
Subgroup analyses results 
There were no differences between the two groups on the primary outcome (death or major disability) 
for any of the pre-specified subgroup analysis factors (gestational age, outborn, antenatal 
corticosteroids, sex, small for gestational age, multiple pregnancy, mode of delivery, time intervention 
started, oximeter software type; see Figure 4). Pre-specified subgroup analyses of major outcomes by 
oximeter software type (Figure 5) showed a significant difference in death by 18-24 months’ corrected 
age for the original software (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.91–1.23; p=0.47) versus revised software (RR 1.38; 95% 
CI 1.14–1.68; p=0.001), interaction test for subgroup difference p=0.03. A similar result was seen for 
death before hospital discharge, and for death before 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age.  
Further pre-specified exploration of other secondary outcomes was undertaken by subgroup analyses 
(see Supplement 2, eTables 3-32 for all results). The number of subgroup analyses performed was large 
(n=319 of which 17 (5%) were nominally significant), and the interaction p-values were not formally 
adjusted for multiple sub-group comparisons and are thus considered exploratory.27 Whilst there were 
 14 
 
some differences in some subgroups for some outcomes using bivariable analyses, there was no overall 
pattern indicating that any particular subgroup of infants benefited more or less from the lower, 
compared with the higher SpO2targeting. There was no difference in the association with lower oxygen 
targeting for death at 18-24 months’ corrected age by known risk factors such as early gestational age 
(<26 weeks), small for gestational age (<10th centile using either the pre-specified Kramer charts28 or the 
post-hoc Alexander curves29 as in the SUPPORT trial30), male sex or infants born outside a tertiary center 
(see Supplement 2, eTables 15 and 33). The association with lower oxygen targeting for severe NEC was 
greater for inborn infants and singletons (see Supplement 2, eTable 26). For the outcome of ROP 
receiving treatment, the association with lower oxygen targeting was larger in infants that commenced 
the intervention at less than 6 hours of age (largely driven by SUPPORT results) and for those born via 
cesarean section (see Supplement 2, eTable 27). There was no difference in the association with lower 
oxygen targeting for PDA treated surgically for any of the pre-specified subgroup variables (see 
Supplement 2,  eTable 25). The association with lower targeting on oxygen treatment at 36 weeks’ 
postmenstrual age was greater in infants small for gestational age (see Supplement 2, eTable 30).      
Sensitivity Analyses Results and Assessments of Bias, and Heterogeneity 
Sensitivity analyses exploring variations in the definition of the primary outcome (see ‘Supportive 
analysis’ in Figure 2) including a Bayley-III cognitive or language score of less than 70  or other definition 
variations used by the individual trials did not change the primary outcome findings. Using a random 
(rather than fixed) effects model gave the same conclusions for all outcomes with the exception of PDA 
treated with surgical ligation which became non-significant (see Supplement 2, eTable 34).  
Overall, the trials were assessed as being at low risk of bias for all domains31 (selection, performance / 
detection, attrition and reporting biases) and had low levels of statistical heterogeneity for most 
outcomes. The ‘ROP receiving treatment' outcome had a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 80%) which 
 15 
 
resulted from the substantially larger treatment effect of lower targeting on this outcome in the 
SUPPORT trial.  
 
Discussion  
In this prospectively planned individual participant data meta-analysis involving clinical trials of 
extremely preterm infants, there was no significant difference between targeting a lower (85-89%) 
versus higher SpO2 range (91-95%) from soon after birth on the primary composite outcome of death or 
major disability at 18-24 months’ corrected age. However, targeting the lower range was associated 
with more death and severe NEC and less treated ROP, but was not associated with blindness.  
When evaluating outcomes within a clinical trial sample or synthesizing results from several trials in a 
meta-analysis, the effects associated with treatment represent averages, and the true benefits and 
harms may differ from those in these analyses. Further, tests of associations between treatment and 
secondary, albeit pre-specified and important, outcomes (including the individual components of the 
composite primary outcome), can be considered exploratory, and the results interpreted with caution. 
In particular, the statistically significant increased risk of death would not remain significant if adjusted 
for multiple testing. However, death was a major component of the composite primary outcome, and a 
clear difference in death, in either direction, was used to assess the need for early stopping in two 
trials.21 The current pooled estimated risk and confidence intervals for mortality from these trials thus 
provide the best currently available indication to guide future clinical practice. 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses showed consistent results across trials for most outcomes, except for a 
larger association on treated ROP within the SUPPORT trial. Reasons for this result in SUPPORT need to 
be explored more fully. One possible explanation for the heterogeneity is that most infants in the 
 16 
 
SUPPORT trial were randomized before birth, but this hypothesis cannot be explored reliably in the 
other trials because they had too few infants recruited early.32  
Mortality was increased in the lower target group overall, in the first reported trial that used the original 
software exclusively,14 and in the subgroup analysis that was pre-specified in the study protocol (original 
versus revised oximeter software,13 Figure 5, Supplement 1). There has been considerable debate 
among the study investigators whether the change in oximeter software was responsible for this 
result.21,33-36  
A subgroup analysis undertaken by the SUPPORT trial investigators found that, in their trial, mortality in 
the lower target group was greater for SGA infants.30 A pre-specified subgroup analysis using a common 
definition of SGA28 across the combined dataset, and a post-hoc analysis on the full dataset using the 
same definition of SGA as used in the SUPPORT trial (Alexander curves),29,30 did not confirm this 
relationship (see Supplement 2, eTable 33).    
The main strength of this meta-analysis is that the five trials were planned prospectively to be similar in 
design and their investigators agreed to undertake a combined pooled individual participant data meta-
analysis after completion, based on a protocol and analysis plan developed in advance of any trial 
results.37,38 As would be expected with this study design, heterogeneity across the trials for most 
outcomes was low. 
A previous Cochrane Review31 had synthesized the aggregate data available from the published reports 
of the five trials. In contrast, these results were derived using raw, individual participant data, sourced 
directly from the trialists and combined centrally, making this the most comprehensive and rigorous 
analyses available of these data. The IPD analyses methods employed also permitted adjustment for the 
correlation of multiples; standardization of important outcomes across trials, including the definition of 
major disability; and enabled testing of the impact of differences in outcome definitions via sensitivity 
 17 
 
analyses. Whilst the main findings are similar to some of the Cochrane Review results, the current IPD 
meta-analysis has provided new insights into the consistency of results across multiple subgroups which 
now clearly do not support the notion that the findings should be restricted to certain groups of infants 
such as those born small-for-gestational age or at very early gestations.  The 2016 American Academy of 
Pediatrics guidelines39 noted that their recommendations at that time were made “pending additional 
data, including the individual patient meta-analysis (NeOProM).” Thus these new findings should help 
clarify these ongoing debates.  
Implications for future research may include investigations of the effects of: differences in alarm limits 
and targeting compliance40 and in the level of exposure to the intervention on outcomes; measures of 
SpO2 achieved and/or the proportion of time spent at various SpO2 levels on outcomes (e.g. via 
prediction models adjusted for potential confounders); the oximeter software change on mortality (e.g. 
further explanation of why a larger association was seen in this subgroup); and, using automated 
methods to match the relatively narrow target ranges required. 
 
Limitations  
This study has several limitations. First, all five trials reported less separation in oxygen exposure 
between treatment groups than anticipated, largely because the lower saturation target groups had 
higher than intended saturations.16 Second, two trials (BOOST-II UK and BOOST-II AUS) were stopped 
early, which may have resulted in some over-estimation of the effect on mortality in these trials.41 
However, excluding truncated studies from meta-analyses can lead to substantial bias due to 
underestimation of overall treatment effects.42 Therefore, the best estimate of the association with 
treatment remains the overall combined results from the five trials. Third, the lack of an association of 
oxygen target range on blindness, but with a clear difference on ROP by treatment group, may change 
 18 
 
with longer follow-up, when less severe visual impairments may become apparent. Fourth, the potential 
for false positive results based on multiple comparisons from 16 secondary outcomes and hundreds of 
subgroup analyses means that individual comparisons, although nominally significant, should be 
considered exploratory and interpreted cautiously. Fifth, whilst these results are generalizable across 
the five trials, caution should be exercised not to extend these findings to other settings which do not 
have early screening for ROP, appropriate ROP treatment or skilled nursing care regarding alarm limits. 
The trials studied the effects of SpO2 target ranges, not oximeter alarm limits, and these two concepts 
are not interchangeable.     
 
Conclusion  
In this prospectively planned individual participant data meta-analysis involving extremely preterm 
infants, there was no significant difference between targeting lower oxygen saturation compared with 
higher saturation on the primary composite outcome of death or major disability at 18-24 months’ 
corrected age.  There were significant differences favoring the higher oxygen target for death and for 
NEC, but favoring the lower oxygen target for ROP.
