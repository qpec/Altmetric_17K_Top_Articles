Abstract
The enteric nervous system (ENS) of jawed vertebrates arises primarily from vagal neural crest 
cells that migrate to the foregut and subsequently colonize and innervate the entire gastrointestinal 
tract. To gain insight into its evolutionary origin, we examined ENS development in the basal 
jawless vertebrate, the sea lamprey. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for the existence of a 
vagally-derived enteric neural crest population in the lamprey. Rather, DiI labeling showed that 
late-migrating cells, originating from the trunk neural tube and associated with nerve fibers, 
differentiated into neurons within the gut wall and typhlosole. We propose that these trunk-derived 
neural crest cells are homologous to Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), recently shown in 
mammalian embryos to populate post-embryonic parasympathetic ganglia1,2, including enteric 
ganglia3. Our results suggest that neural crest-derived SCPs made an important contribution to the 
ancient ENS of early jawless vertebrates, a role that was largely subsumed by vagal neural crest 
cells in early gnathostomes.
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is comprised of thousands of interconnected ganglia 
embedded within the wall of the gut4,5, making it the most complex portion of the peripheral 
nervous system in amniotes. The ENS of jawed vertebrates innervates the entire 
gastrointestinal tract to regulate muscle contraction, chemosensation, water balance, and gut 
secretion6. Classical transplantation experiments have demonstrated that the neurons and 
glia of the gut are largely derived from the “vagal” population of neural crest cells that arise 
within the post-otic portion of the hindbrain7,8. They subsequently migrate to the foregut and 
embark upon the longest migration of any embryonic cell type, from foregut to hindgut.

 The sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, is a jawless (agnathan) vertebrate and an 
experimentally tractable representative of the cyclostomes. As the sister group to jawed 
vertebrates (gnathostomes), lamprey are an important model for identifying traits common 
throughout vertebrates. Lamprey possess migrating neural crest cells that give rise to many 
cell types, including melanocytes, cartilage, sensory neurons and glia, but lack other neural 
crest-derived structures that are present in gnathostomes like jaws and sympathetic chain 
ganglia9,10. Given that lamprey embryos lack sympathetic ganglia, we sought to examine 
other components of the autonomic nervous system, with a focus on the ENS. Adult lamprey 
have a simple ENS that includes ganglionated plexuses of serotonin (5-HT) producing cells, 
as well as a smaller number of catecholamine-containing neurons11,12. However, the 
developmental origin of these enteric neurons is unknown.
As a first step in analysis of lamprey ENS development, we examined the time course of 
neuronal appearance along the developing embryonic gut by performing in situ hybridization 
for Phox2b, which is expressed in enteric neurons in many jawed vertebrates9. Expression of 
lamprey Phox2b is detectable along the gut from early stages (Tahara Stage 25 [T25]9), and 
by stage T28 or embryonic day (E) 20, Phox2b expressing cells are associated with a 
depression in the gut that will become the typhlosole, an hematopoietic tissue associated 
with elements of the ENS (Fig. 1a–b). Using a 5-HT antibody, serotonin-immunoreactive 
neurons were first observed within the gut wall at ~T28.5 (Fig. 1c–d) in the anterior trunk 
region. With time, the numbers increased, and 5-HT+ neurons were noted progressively 
posteriorly, with particularly high cell numbers in the cloacal region, as reported 
previously13. By T30 (E30), there are >100 neurons along the gut in association with the 
typhlosole and vagus nerve (Fig. 1e; Extended Data Fig. 1). Interestingly, individual 
serotonergic neuroblasts also were often associated with axon bundles emanating ventrally 
from the dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 2f; Extended Data Fig. 1a). In addition to 5-HT+ neurons, 
we also noted 5-HT+ columnar cells that may represent gut enterochromaffin cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 1a–b).
We next sought to determine the embryological origin of the neurons in the gut by 
performing lineage labeling with the lipophilic dye DiI14. In chicken, vagal neural crest cells 
that contribute to the ENS arise from the hindbrain neural tube adjacent to somites 1–77. 
After exiting the neural tube, they migrate ventrally, invade the foregut, and undergo a 
collective cell migration along the rostrocaudal extent of the gut. To test whether lamprey 
possess a homologous cell population, we performed focal injections of DiI into the dorsal 
portion of the caudal hindbrain (corresponding to the site of origin of vagal neural crest in 
gnathostomes) of T20 (E6) embryos. Regardless of the exact injection site, dye labeled cells 
spread within the hindbrain and emigrated from the neural tube as a stream directly above 
the pharynx (Extended Data Fig. 2). From this site, they progressed ventrally, then turned 
caudally to populate all of the branchial arches (Extended Data Fig. 2), similar to previously 
reported migration patterns of cranial neural crest cells15,16. However, despite many focal 
injections (n=46) into the caudal hindbrain homologous to “vagal”, we failed to find 
evidence of DiI-labeled cells in the gut. We next looked for expression of the vagal neural 
crest marker, ret, in lamprey, since it is required for vagal neural crest development in 
gnathostomes17–19. To this end, we cloned a lamprey ret homolog and the ret co-receptor 
GFRα1 and examined their expression patterns by in situ hybridization. The results show

 lamprey ret and GFRα1 are expressed in many parts of the embryo, including the 
typhlosole. Ret and GFRα1 expression are first observed in a region anterior to the gut at 
T26 (Extended Data Fig. 2i–j) in a manner reminiscent of Phox2b expression (Extended 
Data Fig. 2k). However, we did not observe expression in neural crest cells migrating from 
caudal hindbrain, raising the intriguing possibility that enteric neurons might arise from a 
different cellular source.
In gnathostomes, migrating trunk neural crest cells fail to invade the immediately underlying 
gut due to the presence of repulsive signals like Slit that block their entry20. Recently, 
however, a secondary contribution to the mammalian ENS has been uncovered that comes 
not from vagal neural crest but rather from trunk neural crest-derived Schwann cell 
precursors (SCPs) associated with extrinsic nerves that contribute post-natally to calretinin-
containing neurons of the gut3. Using Dhh-cre mice to lineage trace immature Schwann 
cells, Uesaka and colleagues found that ~15% of enteric neurons in mice were derived from 
trunk SCPs. Intriguingly, this population persists in ret null mice3. To examine the 
possibility that a homologous population may exist in lamprey, we asked whether cells 
emerging from the trunk neural tube might contribute to neurons of the gut. To test this, we 
performed focal DiI injections into the dorsal trunk neural tube as well as neural tube lumen 
injections following its cavitation at T22-T23 (~E8), thus labeling the entire neural tube as 
well as presumptive neural crest cells prior to their emigration. Both labeling techniques 
yielded similar results. By T25 (E14), such injections label neural crest-derived cells in 
dorsal root ganglia and mesenchyme cells of the fin9. Interestingly, at later stages, we 
observed DiI-labeled cell bodies closely associated with nerve processes, recognized by 
acetylated tubulin staining above the gut (n=47 embryos) (Fig. 2a–c). These individual DiI-
labeled cells were visible as early as T28 (E18–20) and persisted until the latest stages 
examined, T30 (E30-E35), by which time the yolk is reduced, facilitating imaging. In the 
trunk of lamprey, there are two nerve roots per trunk segment—a dorsal root that contains 
fibers emanating from neural crest-derived dorsal root ganglia and a ventral root that 
contains motor neuron nerve fibers. Interestingly, DiI labeled cells were associated with 
these dorsal roots (Fig. 2c). Similarly, serotonergic neuroblasts were selectively associated 
with and appeared to migrate only along these dorsal root bundles (Fig. 2d), consistent with 
a neural crest origin.
To establish whether the DiI-labeled cells differentiated into enteric neurons, embryos were 
sectioned and stained with antibodies to serotonin and acetylated tubulin as a mature 
neuronal marker. The results, based on examination of transverse sections through 25 
representative embryos at T30 (E30–35) in which we quantitated cells that were both 
acetylated tubulin and serotonin-positive, are summarized in Table 1. We noted numerous 
DiI-labeled serotonergic neurons (DiI/5HT/acetylated tubulin-positive cells) in the anterior 
gut (Fig. 2d), esophagus (Fig. 2e), typhlosole, and adjacent tissues, as well as other DiI+ 
neurons that were serotonin negative (Extended Data Fig. 1c). These results demonstrate that 
neural crest cells originating from the trunk neural tube can contribute to enteric neuron 
populations within the gut wall.
To determine if markers associated with neural crest-derived SCPs were present in the 
lamprey trunk, we stained embryos with an antibody to GFAP, which labels glial and

 Schwann cells in amniotes. We observed prominent GFAP+ cells in lamprey embryos 
including some that were DiI positive along the lateral line (Fig. 2g), consistent with the 
possibility that neural crest cells give rise to the nonmyelinating Schwann cells of 
lampreys21.
Finally, as an additional means of testing whether enteric neurons originate from within the 
trunk neural tube, we performed neural tube ablation (n=17), a method classically used to 
demonstrate the neural crest origin of enteric neurons8,22, at approximately T24. To 
accommodate slight natural variation in the number of ENS neurons between embryos, we 
expressed counts as the ratio of serotonergic cells in the zone adjacent to the ablation versus 
an identically sized region spaced approximately one somite length to the anterior. In 
comparison to control nonablated (n=6) or sham-ablated (n=4) embryos (Fig. 3a,c), 
experimental embryos show a significant decrease in the ratio of ENS serotonergic cells 
(Fig. 3b,d). We noted an ~12% decrease of serotonergic neurons in the ablated region 
compared with sham-ablated embryos and an ~25% decrease relative to stage controls, 
consistent with a model of ENS neuronal precursors migrating from trunk NC-derived cells. 
This decrease was particularly surprising given the remarkable regenerative capacity of the 
lamprey spinal cord23,24.
Recent evidence suggests that many neural crest derivatives in post-natal mammals, 
including skin and peripheral ganglia, arise from SCPs that are closely associated with 
extrinsic innervation to these structures. For example, SCPs along nerve processes 
differentiate into melanocytes of the skin and parasympathetic ganglia1,2,25. Moreover, SCPs 
that migrate along trunk spinal nerves contribute to a subpopulation of enteric neurons in 
mice3. These studies prove the existence of neural crest-derived cells that contribute to the 
peripheral nervous system and other derivatives at post-embryonic stages. Our results 
suggest that these trunk neural crest-derived cell types may represent an ancient and 
evolutionary conserved source of cells that contribute to the ENS. Moreover, our data 
suggest that agnathans might lack a classical “vagal” neural crest, leading us to speculate 
that a vagal neural crest population with ability to form enteric neurons arose in stem 
gnathostomes (Fig. 3e). We cannot rule out contributions from other sources, but focus here 
on the positive contribution of trunk neural crest-derived cells to enteric neurons. Although 
we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the mechanisms for populating the ENS 
arose independently in agnathans and gnathostomes, we favor the idea that the contribution 
of SCPs to the ENS might represent a primitive (plesiomorphic) state retained from early 
vertebrates, and perhaps common to all living vertebrates. With emergence of jawed 
vertebrates, new traits, including jaws, sympathetic ganglia, and vagal neural crest-derived 
enteric ganglia, appeared under the umbrella of embryonic neural crest derivatives.
Methods
Adult sea lamprey (P. marinus) were supplied by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 
Dept. of the Interior, and cultured according to previous protocols26 in compliance with 
California Institute of Technology IACUC protocol #1436. Embryo batches with less than 
70% survival were excluded from analyses, and all experimental embryos were randomly 
chosen from appropriately staged cultures. Celltracker CM-DiI (Thermo Scientific) was

 resuspended as described9, and surgical ablations were performed using forceps and 
tungsten needles. For surgeries, only embryos with ablations of 2–6 somite lengths, adjacent 
to anterior intestine, and without damage to other tissues were included in analyses. 
Serotonergic neurons associated with the typhlosole were counted in a 200–300 um region 
adjacent to the ablation site, and an equivalently sized nonablated region beginning 
approximately one myotome length anterior to the ablation. Measurements were taken in 
sibling non-ablated embryos and sham-ablated embryos in which ectoderm and neural tissue 
was cut, but not removed, at similar axial locations. Investigators were not blinded to group 
allocations. Probes for Phox2, GFRα1, and ret were cloned from cDNA with primers for 
Ensembl gene models ENSPMAG00000008433, ENSPMAT00000009324, and 
ENSPMAT00000008763. In situ hybridizations and antibody stainings were performed 
using previously described protocols27,28. Anti-acetylated tubulin (Sigma clone 6-11b-1, 
#T7541; Mouse IgG2b) and anti-5-HT (Immunostar #20080, Rabbit IgG) were used at 
1:500. Anti-GFAP (Dako, #Z0334; Rabbit IgG) was used at 1:400. Embryos were processed 
for cryosectioning according to standard protocols, and were sectioned on a Microm HM550 
cryostat. Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss AxioImager.M2 equipped with an Apotome.
