Suicide and poverty in low-income and middle-income 
countries: a systematic review
Valentina Iemmi, Jason Bantjes, Ernestina Coast, Kerrie Channer, Tiziana Leone, David McDaid, Alexis Palfreyman, Bevan Stephens, Crick Lund
Suicide is the 15th leading cause of death worldwide, with over 75% of suicides occurring in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Nonetheless, evidence on the association between suicide and poverty in low-income and 
middle-income countries is scarce. We did a systematic review to understand the association between suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and economic poverty in low-income and middle-income countries. We included studies 
testing the association between suicidal ideations and behaviours and economic poverty in low-income and 
middle-income countries using bivariate or multivariate analysis and published in English between January, 2004, 
and April, 2014. We identifi
 ed 37 studies meeting these inclusion criteria. In 18 studies reporting the association 
between completed suicide and poverty, 31 associations were explored. The majority reported a positive association. 
Of the 20 studies reporting on the relationship between non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty, 36 
associations were explored. Again, almost all studies reported a positive association. However, when considering each 
poverty dimension separately, we found substantial variations. These fi
 ndings show a consistent trend at the individual 
level indicating that poverty, particularly in the form of worse economic status, diminished wealth, and unemployment 
is associated with suicidal ideations and behaviours. At the country level, there are insuffi
  cient data to draw clear 
conclusions. Available data show a potential benefi
 t in addressing economic poverty within suicide prevention 
strategies, with particular attention to both chronic poverty and acute economic events.
Introduction
With over 800 000 people dying by suicide every year, 
suicide is the 15th leading cause of death worldwide.1 
Suicide is the second leading cause of death in young 
adults aged 15–29 years and fi
 fth leading cause in those 
aged 30–49 years. Suicide surpasses maternal mortality 
as the leading cause of death among girls aged 
15–19 years worldwide.2 Although prevalence of suicide 
in low-income and middle-income countries is lower 
than in high-income countries (11·2 vs 12·7 per 
100 000 people), 75·5% of deaths by suicide occur in 
low-income and middle-income countries.1 Eight of 
the ten countries with the highest prevalence of 
suicide in the world are low-income and middle-income 
countries.
Poverty, like suicide, is concentrated in low-income and 
middle-income countries.3 Poverty is a complex concept 
and its measurement is the subject of enduring debates.4,5 
The need for consensus is refl
 ected by the use of a wide 
array of indicators to measure poverty, including absolute 
measures (eg, income), proxies (eg, socioeconomic 
status, employment, education, health, housing and 
living conditions, food insecurity), and composite 
indicators (eg, Multidimensional Poverty Index, Human 
Development Index [HDI]).6
Although associations between poverty and mental 
health in low-income and middle-income countries are 
receiving steadily increasing research attention,7–9 the 
evidence base for the association between suicide and 
poverty is concentrated in high-income countries. 
Sociological theories on the association between 
economic circumstances and suicide are long standing,10 
with evidence suggesting that a lifetime of poverty is 
protective, whereas a sudden downturn in material 
fortunes can increase risk of suicide.11,12
Economic and epidemiological theories of suicide have 
built on these ideas.13–15 At the individual level, suicidal 
behaviour has been associated with mental illness and 
individual personality factors;16–19 nonetheless the relation 
between suicide and poor mental health is complex. 
At the population level, sociocultural, economic, and 
contextual factors also play a substantial role in the cause 
of suicide,20–22 such as a positive association between 
unemployment and completed suicide,23 and between 
economic crises and suicide.24
No systematic review has been done on the association 
between suicide and poverty across all low-income and 
middle-income countries to date. A previous review7 of 
common mental disorders and poverty in low-income 
and middle-income countries excluded suicide; a review25 
on suicide and poverty did not focus on low-income and 
middle-income countries; and another26 focused on south 
and southeast Asia only. It is within this context that we 
explore the association between suicide and poverty in 
low-income and middle-income countries.
Search strategy and selection criteria
Preliminary mapping exercises on suicide and poverty in 
low-income and middle-income countries were done 
independently at the London School of Economics and 
Political Science (UK) and the University of Cape Town 
(South Africa) in 2010, which informed the design of this 
systematic review.
We searched 11 medical and social science databases: 
CINAHL Plus, EconLit, Embase, Global Health, 
HTA Database, IBSS, NHS EED, PsycINFO, PAIS 
International, and Web of Science. A search strategy was 
designed for PubMed combining keywords for suicide, 
poverty, and low-income and middle-income countries, 
and successively adapted for each database (appendix).

Review
We searched for both published and unpublished studies 
with abstracts and full texts in English only between 
January, 2004, and April, 2014. The initial mapping 
exercise indicated few studies with robust methods 
before 2004. We ran additional searches tracking citations 
and looking at references of included studies.
Refl
 ecting the classifi
 cation used by WHO in 2014,1 we 
focused on the entire spectrum of suicidal ideations and 
behaviours, from suicidal ideations and plans, to 
suicidal gestures including self-harm, attempted 
suicide, and completed suicide. Studies focusing on 
assisted suicide or solely relating to violence, terrorism, 
and war were excluded. In this Review, we have used the 
term “suicidal ideations and behaviours” to refer to the 
full spectrum of completed suicide, and non-fatal 
suicidal ideations and behaviours including suicidal 
ideation, plan, attempt, and self-harm. All studies 
included in the Review had explicit and clearly defi
 ned 
suicidal ideations and behaviours.
Recognising the multidimensionality of poverty,4,6 we 
focused on economic poverty indicators at the individual 
level (absolute poverty, relative poverty, economic status, 
wealth, unemployment, economic or fi
 nancial problems, 
debt, welfare support) and country level (national 
income, national level inequalities, composite poverty 
measures).27 We excluded studies defi
 ning poverty 
through non-economic indicators (eg, education, health, 
housing and living conditions, food insecurity).
We used the World Bank’s defi
 nition of low-income and 
middle-income 
countries 
throughout 
this 
report 
(appendix).28 We included the following study designs: 
randomised, quasi-randomised, and non-randomised 
controlled trials, before-and-after studies, interrupted-time 
series, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional 
studies, ecological studies, case reports, case series, and 
economic evaluation and economic modelling studies. If 
a study included mixed (quantitative and qualitative) 
methods, we included the quantitative data only. Studies 
had to include at least one internal comparison group of 
individuals, allowing analysis by economic status. Studies 
also had to report quantitative data on measures of 
poverty and suicidal ideations and behaviours and their 
relationship, testing the association between suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and poverty using bivariate or 
multivariate analysis. We excluded studies using 
descriptive statistics only.
One author (VI) ran the literature search strategy. After 
testing agreement over a sample of 100 studies, two 
authors (BS and JB) independently screened the same 
titles and abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. They were not allowed to communicate or share 
their data during the process. Full texts of included 
studies were retrieved and the same fulltext references 
independently screened by two authors (AP and BS). The 
results were sent to VI, who compared results and 
compiled a list of studies for which they reached a 
diff
 erent conclusion. BS and JB discussed these until 
reaching an agreement. The studies for which agreement 
could not be reached were discussed by BS and JB with a 
third author. Additional searches were done by two 
authors (BS and VI). We used EndNote and Zotero 
software for screening.
Data extraction and quality assessment

analysis), suicidal ideations and behaviours dimensions, 
poverty dimensions, association between suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and poverty (methods of 
statistical analysis and nature of association found). Data 
was verifi
 ed by a second author, and then checked for 
statistical accuracy (CL or TL). We contacted authors 
when data were not reported to obtain further 
information. We diff
 erentiated between completed 
suicide and non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours.
Authors (BS, EC, JB, and VI) independently assessed 
the quality of eligible studies using the published Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist29 for cohort 
studies 
and 
case-control 
studies, 
adapted 
for 
cross-sectional, interrupted-time series, ecological, and 
economic studies (table 1). Data extraction and quality 
assessment were done in Excel.
Data analysis
We used a narrative analysis for these data. 
Characteristics of each study and associations between 
suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty were 
described. We stratifi
 ed studies by poverty and suicide 
dimensions, and by the method of statistical analysis. 
We then calculated the number of studies with positive, 
null, negative, and unclear associations between 
suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty. To avoid 
attributing too much or  too little weight to an individual 
study, the unit of analysis was the study rather than the 
article to avoid bias towards studies that had produced 
more than one paper. We described results from 
bivariate and multivariate analyses separately to 
highlight when other distal and proximal variables were 
controlled for. Meta-analysis was not possible because 
of the heterogeneity of measures of suicidal ideations 
and behaviours and poverty, and statistical methods of 
analysis. The only possible outcomes that could have 
been assessed in this way were employment and wealth, 
but they were measured diff
 erently and used in 
bivariate analysis only, which would not have allowed a 
meaningful analysis.
Identifi
 cation of studies
In the initial search we identifi
 ed 3653 records (fi
 gure). 
After discarding 1544 duplicates, we screened 2109 unique 
records by title and abstract. 188 full articles were 
retrieved of which 37 met our inclusion criteria. 
Characteristics of the 37 studies are described in table 2 
and reported in full in the appendix. 
We considered 29 (78%) of 37 studies to be of 
high30–32,35,40,46,47,55–60,65 or acceptable33,36–38,41–45,48–50,61,62,66 quality 
(table 3). Eight (22%) of 37 studies34,39,51–54,63,64 were 
considered low quality because of a high risk of bias 
though factors such as: performance bias, detection bias, 
selection bias, unclear case defi
 nitions, attrition, and 
absence of adjustment for confounding factors across all 
the study types used in the analysis.
Associations between poverty and suicidal 
ideations and behaviours
Table 4 and table 5 summarise the associations between 
suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty reported 
in 37 included studies (full details in appendix). In 
18 studies reporting the association between completed 
suicide and poverty, including one study reporting on 
both suicide dimensions, 31 associations were explored 
and split into bivariate and multivariate analyses. Most 
bivariate analyses were positive, indicating increased 
completed suicide with increased poverty: nine (56%) 
of 16 associations compared with four (25%) that 
reported a null association, one (6%) reporting a 
negative association, and two (13%) reporting an 
unclear association. Conversely, few multivariate 
analyses were positive: fi
 ve (33%) of 15 associations, but 
about half (seven [47%] of 15 associations) reported a 
null association in this type of analysis, and three (20%) 
reported an unclear association. Of the 20 studies 
reporting on the association between non-fatal suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and poverty, including one

dimensions, 
36 associations were explored. Most of the associations 
were positive, indicating increased non-fatal suicidal 
ideations and behaviours were associated with 
increased poverty. 12 (55%) of 22 positive associations 
used bivariate analysis and nine (64%) of 14 associations 
used multivariate analysis. Fewer of the associations 
were null, and were not statistically signifi
 cant: nine 
(41%) of 22 associations using bivariate analysis and 
fi
 ve (36%) of 14 associations using multivariate analysis. 
No study reported a negative association using 
multivariate analysis. However, when considering each 
poverty dimension separately, we found substantial 
variations.
Absolute and relative poverty
No study investigated the association between suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and absolute poverty. One 
study42 from Belarus found a positive association 
between completed suicide and relative poverty 
(marginal eff
 ects [β]=0·3 SE=0·0 for males and β=0·03 
SE=0·0 for females) through multivariate analysis. 
Another study65 testing the association between non-
fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours and relative 
poverty reported a positive association with 12-month 
suicidal ideations (odds ratio [OR] 1∙5, 95% CI 1∙2–2∙6) 
and plans (OR 1∙7, 1∙1–2∙7) but a null association for 
12-month planned and unplanned suicide attempts in

Health Survey. These studies were analysed with 
bivariate analysis.
Economic status and wealth
16 studies explored the association between suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and economic status or wealth. 
Five studies46,50,51,53,56 focused on completed suicide. Two 
studies53,56 reported positive and two studies46,50 reported 
null associations when using bivariate analysis. However, 
where multivariate analysis was used in two Indian 
studies, only null associations were found for value of 
livestock and value of agricultural produce among 
farmers61 and for monthly household income.50
Of the 11 studies on non-fatal suicidal ideations and 
behaviours, six studies31,44,58,59,61,63 using bivariate analysis 
reported a positive association and four studies43–45,57 
reported a null association. However, all studies44,46,54,55,57,58,61 
making use of a multivariate analysis found a positive 
association except one,55 which found a null association 
between perceived fi
 nancial status and suicide attempts 
in China. In Chinese studies, fi
 nancial status was 
associated with suicidal ideation (OR 2∙93, 95% CI 
1∙82–4∙71), severe suicidal ideation (2∙25, 1∙21–4∙19) and 
suicide plan (2∙15, 1∙04–4∙41),55 family economic status 
was associated with 6-month rate of severe suicidal 
ideation (1∙52, 1∙07–2∙15),61 and monthly income was 
associated with lifetime prevalence of suicidal attempts 
(0∙2, 0∙06–0∙6).57 In India, perceived economic status 
was associated with 12-month prevalence of suicidal 
ideation (2∙23, 1∙62–3∙06) and suicide attempt (2∙92, 
1∙63–5∙21).54 In Vietnam, low income was associated 
with lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation (1∙7, 
1∙1–2∙6).58 In Turkey, low income was associated with 
lifetime prevalence of self-harm (2∙10, 1∙07–4∙12).44
Unemployment
13 studies investigated the association between suicidal 
ideations 
and 
behaviours 
and 
unemployment. 
Six studies37,39,40,42,46,52 focused on completed suicide and 
six studies32,35,36,38,58,65 on non-fatal suicidal ideations and 
behaviours, with one48 looking at both dimensions.

Review
Among the seven studies reporting on completed 
suicide, three37,40,52 reported a positive and one46 reported a 
null association between completed suicide and 
unemployment using bivariate analysis. Results were 
mixed when studies were analysed with multivariate 
analysis, with one39 showing a positive association with 
female low labour force participation in Iran (r=–0∙38), 
one48 reporting null association with unemployment 
rates in the working age population in Sri Lanka 
(incidence rate ratio 1∙29, 95% CI 0∙96–1∙72), and 
another42 
showing 
an 
unclear 
association 
with 
unemployment rates among men and women in Belarus.
Among the seven studies investigating non-fatal 
suicidal ideations and behaviours, results were mixed for 
studies using bivariate analysis, with three36,38,65 showing 
positive and three38,58,65 showing null associations. When 
multivariate analysis was used, only one Iranian study38 
reported a positive association between unemployment 
rates and suicide attempts (OR 2·54, 95% CI 1·08–5·98). 
Three studies reported a null association with 
unemployment and hospital admission following 
intentional self-burning35 and self-reported responses to 
the Harmful Behaviour Scale and the Beck Scale for 
Suicidal Ideation,36 both in Iran and Sri Lanka.48
Economic or fi
 nancial problems
Seven studies explored the association between suicide 
and economic or fi
 nancial problems. All three studies 
focusing on completed suicide were measured by 
bivariate analysis only, reporting one positive,37 one null,46 
and one unclear52 association. In four49,60,62,65 studies on 
non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours, results from 
one60 showed a positive association, although results from 
another65 showed a null association using bivariate 
analyses. With the use of multivariate analyses, the results 
were similar with two studies reporting positive 
associations between non-fatal suicidal ideations and 
behaviours and economic or fi
 nancial problems. One 
study49 reported a positive association between the 
perceived 
amount 
of 
stress 
due 
to 
economic 
circumstances and lifetime suicidal ideation (OR 1∙17, 
95% CI 1∙11–1∙24) or lifetime suicidal attempt (1∙19, 
1∙08–1∙31) in India. A similar association was shown 
between becoming a female sex worker because of 
fi
 nancial necessity and 6-month occurrence of suicidal 
attempts among female sex workers in China (0∙24, 
0∙09–0∙58).62 A null association was shown between 
fi
 nancial burden for managing the autoimmune disorder, 
lupus, and suicidal ideation in China.60
Debt and welfare support
Three studies investigated the association between debt 
and completed suicide. Although results were positive 
for the two52,53 studies using bivariate analysis, there was 
a null association in a study51 looking at debt and suicides 
in farmers in India with multivariate analysis. One study 
in Iran39 explored the association between welfare 
support and completed suicide. The multivariate analysis 
showed a positive association between completed suicide 
and women receiving welfare support (r=–0∙58).
Economic crisis, national income, and national-level 
inequalities
No study explored the association between suicidal 
ideations and behaviours and economic crises or national-
level inequalities. However, seven studies30,33,34,41,47,64,66 
investigated the association between suicide and national 
income. Three studies measured these outcomes with 
bivariate analysis and had mixed results: one30 positive

with the infl
 ation rate in South Africa, one66 negative with 
Purchasing Power Parity-adjusted gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita across multiple countries, and one34 
unclear association with GDP per capita in Brazil. When 
multivariate analyses were used, results continued to be 
mixed. Two positive associations with per-capita real 
income in Turkey (long-run elasticity of suicide with 
respect to income –0∙41 [for which a 1% increase in per 
capita real income results in 0·41% decrease in numbers 
of suicides])41 and with per-capita GDP adjusted for 
infl
 ation in urban (β=–0∙57, SE=0∙20) and also in rural 
China (β=–0∙68, SE=0∙06).64 One33 null association with 
per-capita GDP in Brazil, and two unclear associations 
with the infl
 ation rate in South Africa30 and with GDP per 
capita in India47 were found.
Composite poverty measure
One study33 explored the association between suicide and 
composite poverty measures. With a multivariate 
analysis, this Brazilian study reported a null association 
between suicides and the income domain of the HDI 
(HDI-income).
Discussion
The results of our Review show that more than half of 
individual-level studies reported a positive association 
between economic adversity using various poverty 
measures and completed suicide in bivariate analyses. 
However, this association became more attenuated in 
multivariate analyses. In the case of non-fatal suicidal 
ideations and behaviours, both bivariate and multivariate 
analyses showed that approximately 60% of studies 
reported a positive association with poverty. The results 
from the remaining studies showed a null or unclear 
association, with few showing a negative association. We 
found a small number of studies in some poverty 
dimensions, mainly at the individual level, with no 
evidence for some dimensions (absolute poverty, 
economic crisis, and national level inequalities).
At the individual level, a broad trend is that adverse 
economic status, as measured through various poverty 
indicators, appears to increase risk for suicidal ideations 
and behaviours in low-income and middle-income 
countries. However, the relationship between poverty 
and these behaviours in low-income and middle-income 
countries is complex.
First, the eff
 ect of poverty on risk of suicidal ideations 
and behaviours appears to attenuate when multivariate 
analyses are done and other distal and proximal variables 
are controlled for, particularly in the case of completed 
suicide. This trend was not evident in non-fatal suicidal 
ideations and behaviours, where both bivariate and 
multivariate analyses showed consistent trends.
Second, the fi
 ndings for individual and country-level 
studies were quite diff
 erent. Whereas there were 
consistent associations between poverty and risk of 
suicidal ideations and behaviours at the individual level, 
there were no such trends at the country level. This trend 
could indicate that at a country level, various confounding 
variables acting either within or between the comparison 
groups might not be accounted for in the study design. 
The country-level evidence is insuffi
  cient to draw clear 
conclusions regarding the eff
 ects of economic variables 
on a macro scale on completed suicide.
Third, few dimensions of poverty are assessed in these 
studies; only six individual-level and two country-level 
dimensions of poverty receive attention. Poverty 
dimensions such as unemployment and economic status 
receive comparatively more attention than do debt and 
welfare support. Most studies had objective indicators of 
poverty (eg, mean family income, loans) and relied on 
self-report or family-report measures. Few studies asked 
participants if they considered themselves as living in 
poverty. This is an important distinction, as some people 
might not perceive themselves as living in poverty, 
although fulfi
 lling the criteria of poverty according to 
defi
 nitions.
Fourth, variations in the association between suicide 
and poverty might also refl
 ect varying measures of 
suicide made use of in studies. Research on suicide has 
long been hampered by problems inherent in defi
 ning 
and measuring suicidal ideations and behaviours and the 
inconsistent use of terminology.67 These problems 
manifest in the inconsistency in the defi
 nition of suicidal 
phenomena and its measurement in included studies. In 
some, for example, suicidal ideation is defi
 ned as 
“thoughts of killing oneself”60 although others defi
 ne the 
same concept as “a spectrum of self-destructive thoughts 
or ideas”.32 Some studies focus on particular kinds of 
non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours (eg, burning 
oneself), but others have broader inclusion criteria 
(eg, self-harm). A further problem confounding the 
interpretation of fi
 ndings and making comparisons 
diffi
  cult is under-reporting of suicidal ideations and 
behaviours in some low-income and middle-income 
countries as a result of poor surveillance systems, stigma, 
and legal sanctions.
Fifth, diff
 erent poverty dimensions vary in the strength 
and consistency of their associations with suicidal 
ideations and behaviours. For example, although 
consistent associations were evident for economic status, 
wealth, and unemployment, the fi
 ndings were more 
mixed for debt, welfare support, and relative poverty, 
which might have played a role in the variability in these 
fi
 ndings. Additionally, there could be varying eff
 ects of 
chronic and acute poverty on suicidal ideations and 
behaviours. Chronic poverty might provide a set of distal 
economic risk factors for suicidal ideations and 
behaviours, but acute economic shocks, such as crop 
failure,51,53 could provide more immediate causes, which 
interact with family and individual variables to increase 
risk for suicidal ideations and behaviours. A previous 
systematic review26 found a similar complex picture, with 
a decrease of socioeconomic position being associated 
 www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 3   August 2016 
781
Review
with an increased risk of completed suicide and suicide 
attempts in south and Southeast Asia, with variation 
across dimensions and studies.
Sixth, the evidence was weak on whether the association 
between suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty is 
due to either social causation or social selection. The only 
longitudinal study of acceptable quality included in this 
systematic review involved the use of economic status as 
a confounder and found no signifi
 cant association 
between low economic status and completed suicide.50 A 
previous review7 exploring the association between 
poverty and common mental disorders revealed a 
similarly complex picture in which various poverty and 
mental health related variables interact in a complex 
manner, infl
 uenced by both population and measurement 
factors.
Seventh, both suicidal ideations and behaviours and 
poverty diff
 er by sex. Globally, suicides rates are slightly 
less than double for males compared with females1, 
although economic poverty is more common in females.68 
However, sex diff
 erences in the association between 
suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty were not 
explored because of scarcely available evidence. 
Three studies30,33,42 only explored associations for both 
female and male participants.
Finally, social factors relating to poverty such as rurality 
and access to lethal means could explain some of the 
fi
 ndings. Living in conditions of poverty might infl
 uence 
access to potentially fatal means of self-injury and 
therefore might infl
 uence the rates of suicide. However, 
those associations were not explored in the included 
studies. One study55 reporting a positive association 
between non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours 
(suicidal ideation, severe suicidal ideation, suicide plan) 
and fi
 nancial status in rural China, reported a positive 
association between non-fatal suicidal ideations and 
behaviours (suicidal ideation, severe suicidal ideation) 
and degree of rurality using a multivariate analysis. 
Another study48 done in people who completed or 
attempted suicide by self-poisoning in rural Sri Lanka, 
where about 60% of the suicides were due to 
self-poisoning,69 found a null association between 
unemployment and both completed suicide and suicidal 
attempts, but a positive association with being employed 
in agriculture (with easier access to lethal means) using a 
multivariate analysis.
This is the fi
 rst systematic review to our knowledge to 
explore the association between suicidal ideations 
and behaviours and poverty in low-income and 
middle-income countries. The inclusion of both fatal 
and non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours provided 
an exploration of the entire spectrum of possible 
suicidal phenomena. However, the study has limitations. 
Poverty was defi
 ned in economic terms only, not 
including other dimensions of poverty such as poor 
education, health, housing and living conditions, and 
food insecurity.4 Poverty is increasingly understood by 
researchers to be more than simply a scarcity of resource 
or income, and can include cultural, social, and 
environmental dimensions, such as shame70 and 
religious beliefs.63 Another limitation is that publication 
bias could have hindered the results, with studies 
reporting negative and null results being less likely to 
be published. Moreover, the exclusion of qualitative 
studies might have limited understanding of how living 
in poverty might be related to suicidal ideations and 
behaviours, and the role of cultural, social, and 
environmental factors. Finally our searches were only 
run in English, only English full texts were included, 
and our searches were limited to 2004–14.
Suicide carries not only a considerable burden of 
disease but also a substantial cost, mainly due to a high 
proportion of suicide observed in young adulthood and 
the associated loss in productivity. Although the evidence 
in low-income and middle-income countries is scarce, in 
high-income countries the mean cost per suicide has 
been estimated to range from $0·4 million to $4·3 million 
(in international dollars, 2014), dependent on types of 
costs included and methods used in the analysis.71 The 
Sustainable Development Goals have not only included 
the goal to reduce by 2030 premature mortality by a third 
“from non-communicable diseases through prevention 
and treatment” but also to “promote mental health and 
wellbeing”.72 The mental health action plan 2013–20 
published by WHO73 has also set the goal of a 
10% reduction in suicide by 2020 by use of eff
 ective 
interventions (eg, reduced access to pesticides, training 
programmes for school teachers, follow-up of suicide 
attempt survivors).74 These actions need not only to 
involve health but also other sectors.1 Our results suggest 
that interventions addressing the poverty of individuals 
could have a positive eff
 ect on reducing suicidal ideations 
and behaviours. Attention needs to be brought not only to 
chronic poverty but also to acute events and economic 
shocks, 
such 
as 
crop 
failure. 
However, 
no 
recommendations can be made for specifi
 c countries, as 
there is insuffi
  cient evidence to form the basis of future 
recommendations.
Further research is needed to understand associations 
between diff
 erent dimensions of suicide and poverty, and 
to cover all regions, especially regions where suicide 
rates are high. Additional studies should use multivariate 
analysis to highlight associations and interactions with 
proximal and distal factors and have longitudinal study 
designs to explore causal pathways. Encouraging a more 
consistent statistical approach towards analysis would 
also help in facilitating meta-analyses and cross-country 
comparisons. Although most of the studies in this review 
were also atheoretical, it would be helpful for future 
studies in this fi
 eld to make use of appropriate existing 
theoretical frameworks and contribute to their adaptation 
to help understand the cause of suicide and how poverty 
is implicated in low-income and middle-income country 
settings.
