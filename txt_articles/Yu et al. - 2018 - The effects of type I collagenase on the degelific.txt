Abstract
Background: Semen from the chimpanzee species becomes a colloidal solid after ejaculation. The formation of this
copulatory plug is believed to prevent additional spermatozoa of subsequent mating events from accessing the ova.
However, this naturally preserved strategy hampers the processes for sperm preparation. In this study, we investigated
whether collagenase can be used to degelify the semen plug and accelerate the semen liquefaction process in zoo
captive chimpanzee species (Pan troglodytes).
Results: We showed that incubation of chimpanzee ejaculates with 0.1% type I collagenase efficiently and significantly
(p < 0.05) releases 2.7-fold more spermatozoa from the coagulated ejaculates, and this degelification process did not
alter sperm morphology or viability; nor did it stimulate spontaneous capacitation or an acrosome reaction as assessed
by tyrosine phosphorylation and peanut agglutinin stains; moreover, based on computer assisted sperm analysis assay,
motility-related parameters remained similar to those of untreated spermatozoa. When collagenase effects were evaluated
on cryopreserved sperm samples, we observed post collagenase treatment in which 2.5% glycerol, as a cryoprotectant,
preserved sperm acrosome integrity better than 7.8%; however, 7.8% glycerol, as a cryoprotectant, maintained sperm
motility better than that of 2.5% glycerol.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated for the first time that type I collagenase can be used to obtain a significantly
higher number of spermatozoa from colloid chimpanzee semen ejaculate without affecting the physiological properties
of spermatozoa, and these results are critical for the subsequent gamete development. Our results would benefit sperm
preparation processes and cryopreservation efficiency per ejaculate, as more unaffected spermatozoa can be released
from the semen plug within a shorter period of time. These results would also benefit the genetic diversity of the
chimpanzee species, using sperm cells from less dominant individuals, and for achieving better pregnancy success in
primates with significantly higher amounts of sperm for artificial insemination.

Background
Seminal fluid is a mixture of various components secreted
by gonads and accessory sex glands that contains proteins,
lipids, amino acids, fructose and other carbohydrates. In
addition to the vitality nutrients and metabolites mentioned
above, seminal fluid also contains numerous components
that form the extracellular matrix and contributes to the
main composition of semen and its viscosity, which further
affects sperm competition success [1–4]. The degree of
semen viscosity varies between animal species and individ-
uals. Ejaculates from some animals remain liquid all the
time, while semen from other mammalian species becomes
solidified after ejaculation. It is known that semen from
humans (Homo sapiens) undergoes solidification and lique-
faction processes [5]; however, semen from other species,
such as llamas, alpacas or primates (i.e., chimpanzee,

 orangutan, gorilla), the ejaculates begin to coagulate and
become a colloidal solid after exposure to the air [6, 7]. The
formation of this so called “mating plug” or copulatory plug
is believed to prevent the additional spermatozoa of subse-
quent mating events from accessing the ova, which is
critical to preserve genetic materials from a specific individ-
ual (especially the dominant individual from a species with
highly hierarchical social structure) in wild animals [8].
It has been suggested that vesiculase secreted from
anterior prostate or coagulating gland facilitates the
coagulation of the semen and proteolytic enzymes in
human seminal fluid are responsible for semen liquefaction,
likely due to high levels of arginine ester-hydrolyzing
enzyme [5]. Earlier studies on semen composition of
primates indicated that their semen may not contain
sufficient amounts of proteolytic enzymes to rapidly and
automatically liquefy colloidal semen plug [5, 8]; therefore,
current approach to obtain free swimming spermatozoa
from great apes is to place the ejaculates at either room
temperature (RT) or at 25–37 °C and wait for auto-
liquefaction. However, Young and Smithwick demonstrated
that in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) ejaculates, only about
one-fourth of the ejaculates were automatically liquefied
after 4 h, and sperm motility measured during this 4 h
period of time showed a significant downward tendency,
especially in the first two, one-hour (0 ~ 1 h and 1 ~ 2 h)
intervals. Additionally, the percentage of viable and motile
spermatozoa decreased significantly over time [9]. In this
study, we aim to investigate whether type I collagenase
would facilitate semen liquefaction of chimpanzee semen
and to evaluate whether collagenase treatment would affect
sperm capacitation status, acrosome integrity and motility-
related parameters using various independent approaches.
Methods
Chimpanzee training and semen collection by hand
massage
Electroejaculation (EEJ) is widely used for semen collection
in wildlife and captive zoo animals [10, 11]. However, EEJ
in great apes has been discouraged, as it incurs higher risk
due to the need for deep anesthetization and the high elec-
tric voltage required to induce ejaculation. Moreover, the
quality of ejaculates was generally suboptimal with great
variation. To perform non-invasive semen collection pro-
cedure, as previously described [12, 13], Taipei Zoo began
to train great apes for medical, husbandry and research pur-
poses using positive reinforcement methods (e.g., rewarding
additional feed or biscuits) since 2010 (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). Chimpanzees were trained to stay at their
assigned position in their accommodation facing animal
caretakers when being called. Chimpanzee displayed an
erect penis ready for semen collection when veterinarians
approached with artificial vagina in hand (Additional file 1:
Figure S1A). Other chimpanzees in the same cage held still
at their position with the animal caretaker and did not
interfere with semen collection processes (Additional file 1:
Figure S1B). Ejaculate was immediately collected from the
artificial vagina into a 50 ml falcon tube using a sterilized
scrapper in the presence of dilution medium; the formation
of gel-like texture was observed as soon as the ejaculate got
in contact with the air (Additional file 1: Figure S1C). As
indicated in the methods (animal training section), after the
completion of semen collection, the chimpanzee was given
additional rewards (biscuits) on top of their regular feeds
(Additional file 1: Figure S1D).
Semen samples acquired in this study were collected
from 4 adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, age ranging
from 7 to 23 years old, group housed with fixed feeding
schedule and free water access) using artificial vagina
(IMV Ram/goat vagina 13.5, IMV Technologies, L’Aigle,
France)
in
combination
with
penile
hand
massage
without anesthesia.
Chemicals, reagents, antibodies
Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise stated.
Mouse monoclonal anti-Phosphorylation Tyrosine (4G10)
was obtained from EMD Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany);
Lectin-PNA from Arachis hypogaea conjugated with
Alexa 488 was purchased from Invitrogen (Invitrogen/Life
Technologies,
Carlsbad,
CA,
USA).
All
secondary
antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch
(PA, USA). Sperm incubation medium (Modified Ham’s
F10) and frozen medium used for cryopreservation experi-
ments were acquired from IrvineScientific (CA, USA).
Type I collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Semen evaluations and sperm preparation
The acquisition of animal materials (semen ejaculates)
and
animal
handling
followed
the
regulation
and
approval of animal welfare committee of Taipei Zoo
(protocol#10601)
and
were
monitored
under
the
guidance of the animal welfare committee of Taipei Zoo,
Taiwan. For sperm preparation, 16 ejaculates (4 ejacula-
tions each from 4 individuals) were collected and
assessed (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Freshly ejaculated
semen was removed from the artificial vagina into a
50 ml falcon tube using sterilized chemical scope. An
equivalent amount (in weight) of clotted semen was
separated for further experiments. Experiments were
divided into “fresh sample evaluations” and “cryopre-
served sample assessments”. For fresh sample experi-
ments, coagulated semen was incubated with Ham’s F10
medium in the absence (control) or presence of 0.1 type
I collagenase at 25 °C water bath for 30 min. After the
incubation, liquefied semen was separated for semen
quality assessments; semen concentration, motility, sperm

 viability and morphological abnormality were manually
evaluated by experienced personnel. For morphological
evaluation, standard papanicolaou (PAP) and POPE’s
staining
procedures
were
carried
out
as
previously
described [14–16], and 200 sperm cells were evaluated for
each collection; data were expressed in percentages (%).
For cryopreservation experiments after required collage-
nase incubation (with or without collagenase treatment),
spermatozoa were spun down (800 g, 10 min) and
resuspended in a sufficient volume of frozen medium
containing test yolk (IrvineScientific) to achieve a final
concentration of ~ 109 spermatozoa/ml. Sperm-test yolk
mixture was first cooled down at 25 °C in a water bath for
30 min at dark and then chilled in a cooler at 4 °C for
90 min (cooling rate of < 0.5 °C/min), and chilled sperm
samples were mixed with 12% glycerol (in test yolk) to
reach a final concentration of either 2.5% or 7.8% glycerol
before loading into plastic straws (0.25 ml) at 4 °C. Chilled
straws containing semen samples were subsequently
exposed to nitrogen vapor (4 cm over the surface of liquid
nitrogen) for 10 min and then immersed and stored in
liquid nitrogen until use.
Sperm viability assay
Sperm 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazo-
lium bromide (MTT) assay and Propidium iodine (PI)
staining were performed to evaluate sperm viability.
Briefly, MTT stock (5 mg/ml) solution was prepared and
filtered with 0.22 μm PVDF membrane filter (Millipore)
to remove undissolved residues and kept at 4 °C in dark
for maximum 1 week. When used, MTT stock was added
into sperm suspensions to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/
ml (1.2 mM) in Ham’s F10 medium and incubated for 1 h
at 37 °C in humidified incubator. Analysis was carried out
by manually examining at least 200 sperm cells per condi-
tion; spermatozoa without any signs of residue MTT were
considered non-viable sperm; spermatozoa with clear
granule-like particle aggregated in the mid-piece region
were considered viable spermatozoa [17]. Due to the inter-
ference of cryoprotectant on MTT assay, PI stain was
therefore used for cryopreserved sample evaluation as an
alternative measurement as previously described [18]. In
brief, after frozen straws were defrosted in a 37 °C pre-
warmed water bath, the frozen medium was removed by
centrifugation (800 g, 10 min), and sperm pellet was
resuspended in Ham’s F-10 medium. A half microliter of
stock PI (1 mg/ml) was added to each sample, obtaining a
final concentration of 5 μg/ml (7.5 μM). Samples were
incubated at 37 °C in a dark room for 8 min before
manual assessments under fluorescence microscopy.
Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA)
Motility-related sperm parameters were analyzed using
an UltiMate computer-assisted sperm analysis system
(CASA,
Hamilton
Thorne
Inc.,
Beverly,
USA),
as
described by Broekhuijse et al. [19]. Default software and
parameter settings were followed by recommendation of
Hamilton Thorne Inc., for human spermatozoa, and
image capture was set to 60 frames/s; a total 45 frames
were recorded per examination field. After required
treatments, sperm suspension was diluted 1:10 in pre-
warmed Ham’s F10 medium. Then, 3 μl aliquot was
added into a standardized Leja 4-chamber counting slide
(Leja Products B.V., Nieuw Vennep, the Netherlands).
By the use of automated stage, 5 microscopic fields were
analyzed within each chamber (a total 225 frames were
taken per experimental sample). At least 3–5 independent
repeats were performed for each experimental condition;
mean value and standard error of mean (SEM) were calcu-
lated accordingly. Motility-related parameters including
motility (%), progressive motility (%, defined as VAP >
=25 μm/s, STR > =30%), velocity average path (VAP, μm/s),
velocity straight line (VSL, μm/s), velocity curvilinear (VCL,
μm/s), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, μm),
beat frequency cross (BCF, Hz), and straightness (STR)
were measured and analyzed.
Indirect immunofluorescent (IFA) assays for sperm
capacitation status and acrosome integrity
Indirect immunofluorescent staining was carried out to
evaluate sperm capacitation status and acrosome integrity.
For sperm capacitation status, standard protocol for
sperm
phosphotyrosine
staining
was
followed
[20].
Spermatozoa were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
for 30 min at RT, permeabilization of fixed spermatozoa
was performed by using 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS
for 10 min at RT. Tyrosine phosphoproteins were labelled
and subsequently recognized by anti-mouse secondary
antibody. Fully capacitated spermatozoon was defined
when either (1) a strong signal could be observed in the
flagellum or (2) a strong signal in the flagellum with
moderate signal in the equatorial segment was detected.
Acrosome integrity was evaluated as previously described
[21]. Briefly, fixed spermatozoa were washed and resus-
pended in PBS; 20 μl of sperm suspension was added onto
Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Thermo Scientific/
Invitrogen), and spermatozoa were allowed to attach to
the slide for 10 min. Unbound sperm cells were removed
with PBS, and antibody incubation was immediately
carried out using peanut agglutinin (PNA) conjugated
with Alexa 488 at 2 mM for 1 h at RT. Nuclei were stained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vectashield
H-1200, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA), and slides were
then sealed with nail polish. At least 200 spermatozoa
were counted in each sample under a fluorescence
microscope. For negative controls, each immunoreaction
was accompanied by a reaction omitting the primary
antibody. All samples were evaluated with Olympus IX83

 epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, JP) and
analyzed with either ImageJ (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/)
or Cellsens software (Olympus).
Immunoblotting
Sperm cells were solubilized using commercially avail-
able RIPA cell lysis buffer (AMRESCO, Ohio, USA) in
combination with sonication. Equivalent amount of total
protein extract was resuspended with an appropriate
volume of Lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) loading buffer
(Invitrogen) in the presence of reducing agent (50 mM
DTT). Samples were heated in a 100 °C dry bath for
10 min and cooled on ice before loading on gels.
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (gradient T-Pro
EZ Gel Solution, T-Pro Biotechnology, NTC, TW) and
wet-blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P,
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking for 1 h
with blocking buffer (5 mM Tris, 250 mM sucrose,
pH 7.4 with 0.05% v/v Tween-20 [TBST], supplemented
with 5% milk powder) at RT, blots were incubated with
anti-Phosphotyrosine (Merk/Millipore) primary antibody
and subsequently with secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution
in TBST) for 1 h at RT. Protein signals were visualized by
chemiluminescence (Merck, Ltd., TW) and were detected
with ChemiDoc™ XRS+ system (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analyses
Results were expressed as the mean+/−standard error of
mean (SEM). Comparative studies of means were per-
formed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by a Kruskal- Wallis test. Significance was set
with p < 0.05.
Results
Type I collagenase facilitated the release of spermatozoa
from colloid semen without affecting sperm morphology
and viability
In line with observations from earlier studies [10, 22],
ejaculations from chimpanzees formed a colloid semen
texture as soon as they were exposed to the air, and only
a minimal amount of semen in liquid form could be
observed (Fig. 1a). An average concentration of 3.13 × 108
sperm/ml could be obtained from auto-liquefied semen,
in contrast, a 2.3-fold increase in sperm concentration per
ml (7.21 × 108/ml) was achieved in the presence of 0.1%
collagenase, and a 2.74-fold (3.38 × 108 vs. 9.27 × 108)
increase in total sperm number was counted (Fig. 1b). To
evaluate the cell toxicity of collagenase and whether
collagenase treatment results in sperm death, MTT sperm
viability assay was performed as described earlier [17].
Spermatozoon was considered alive when positive signals

least 200 sperm cells were evaluated in each sample. Data were analyzed from 16 ejaculates from 4 individuals

 arrow heads) were observed at its mid-piece, or else the
spermatozoon would be considered as dead (Fig. 1c,
indicated with black arrow head). For sperm abnormality
assessment, chimpanzee sperm cells were smeared on
examination slides and manually evaluated by 3 independ-
ent experienced lab technicians. No significant differences
were observed between control and collagenase-treated
groups in sperm abnormality rate, nor did their viability
suggest that collagenase treatment did not cause morpho-
logical damages or affect chimpanzee viability under our
experimental setups (Fig. 1c).
Motility-related sperm parameters were not altered by
type I collagenase treatment
Sperm motility is the most important factor for success-
ful fertilization in vivo; we next evaluated the effects of
type I collagenase on sperm motility using a well-
recognized system, namely, computer-assisted sperm
analysis (CASA). When compared with control condi-
tion, chimpanzee sperm treated with collagenase did not
show
significant
decrease
in
total
motility;
when
compared with its own starting point (t = 10), gradual
reductions in progressive motility were measured in
both control and collagenase-treated groups (Fig. 2).
Among all parameters measured, average path velocity
(VAP) and curvilinear velocity (VCL) were widely used
to indicate the velocity/speed of swimming sperm cells;
beat frequency cross (BCF) and linearity (LIN) are
known to represent sperm swimming pattern, and these
four parameters were considered critical indicators for
sperm functions measured by CASA [19]. Our data
demonstrated that besides a slight decrease in sperm
swimming linearity in the collagenase-treated group at
60 min post incubation, and no other differences were
measured
between
control
and
collagenase-treated
groups in the abovementioned parameters (Fig. 2);
therefore, our data showed that collagenase did not
exhibit apparent negative influences on sperm swimming
and
motility-related parameters
in
freshly collected
chimpanzee semen samples.
Type I collagenase did not induce spontaneous sperm
capacitation or acrosome reaction
Sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction are two
important indications for physiological status of sperm
cells [21, 23, 24]. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a well-
recognized indicator for both spontaneous or induced
sperm
capacitation;
spermatozoa
were
considered
capacitated when tyrosine phosphorylated proteins can
be observed at sperm tail (Fig. 3A2, indicated with arrow
heads). For acrosome integrity, outer acrosomal membrane-
specific lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) was used as a
marker lectin in this study as previously described [21].
Acrosome was considered intact when a homogeneous
Fig. 2 CASA analyses revealed no negative effects of type I collagenase on sperm motility-related parameters. Computer-assisted sperm analysis
showed no significant differences on sperm motility, progressive motility, average path velocity (VAP), curvilinear velocity (VCL), beat frequency
cross (BCF), and linearity (LIN) between control and collagenase-treated sperm, indicated no negative effects of type I collagenase on sperm
motility-related parameters. Data were expressed in percentages (%, for motility, progressive motility and linearity), mm/s (for VCL) and Hz (for
BCF). *Indicates significant differences between groups. Relative changes within each group (t60 vs. t10) were also indicated. Data were analyzed
from 16 ejaculates from 4 individuals

 PNA signal can be observed at the anterior sperm head
(Fig. 3A3, indicated with arrow heads) and acrosome
reacted or reacting spermatozoa exhibit no or ring-like
signal at their equatorial area of the sperm heads
(Fig. 3A4, indicated with arrow heads). Following these
criteria, at least 200 sperm cells were counted for each
experimental repeat (n = 16); a slight decrease in sperm
capacitation rate was observed when 0.1% collagenase
was used (30.7% vs. 28.5%); however, this difference did
not reach significance (p > 0.01, Fig. 3B). For spontan-
eous acrosome reaction rate, no significant difference
was observed between control and collagenase-treated
groups (p > 0.01, Fig. 3B). In addition to sperm staining
mentioned above, we also assessed the level of tyrosine
phosphorylation using immunoblotting technique. In
line with our sperm counting results, both control and
collagenase-treated conditions exhibited a certain level
of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but no apparent
differences were detected between the two groups
(Fig. 3C). Taken together, our data showed that type I
collagenase did not alter sperm capacitation status or
cause further acrosome damages on freshly acquired
chimpanzee sperm cells.
Collagenase-treated spermatozoa showed similar
morphological and physical characteristics as un-treated
spermatozoa after glycerol-based cryopreservation
Glycerol has been considered as an affective cryoprotectant;
based on current practice in most of the zoos, 2.5–7.8%
glycerol was commonly used to preserve chimpanzee
sperm [25], therefore, 2.5% and 7.8% glycerol were used in
this study. Based on propidium iodine staining (Fig. 4a), no
matter whether 2.5% or 7.8% glycerol was used as cryopro-
tectant, no differences were observed between control and
collagenase-treated groups on morphological abnormality,
viability, sperm capacitation status and acrosome integrity
(Fig. 4b-e). From immunoblotting results, no apparent
differences
between
collagenase-treated
and
untreated
groups were observed when 2.5% glycerol was applied;
however, a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylated pro-
teins was observed when 7.8% glycerol was used (Fig. 4f).
When CASA was used for evaluating motility-related
parameters
of
cryopreserved
semen
samples,
some
differences
between
control
and
collagenase-treated
group were observed. In the 2.5% glycerol group (Fig. 5a),
in contrast to the control group, spermatozoa showed a
gradual decrease throughout time, and collagenase-

was considered capacitated when distinct tyrosine phosphorylation staining was observed at sperm tail (A1, A2, indicated with white arrow
heads). Sperm acrosome was considered intact when homogeneous PNA staining could be observed at the anterior area of the sperm head (A3,
marked with white arrow heads). Acrosome reacting/reacted spermatozoon showed a ring-like staining pattern at its post-equatorial region (A4,
marked with arrow heads). B-C No significant differences on sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction rates were observed between control
and 0.1% type I collagenase-treated group; N.S: not significantly different. At least 200 sperm cells were evaluated in each sample. Data were
analyzed from 16 ejaculates from 4 individuals. Fifty micrograms of total protein was loaded onto each lane for immunoblotting experiment

 treated spermatozoa showed a sharp decline in motility
within the first 20 min post thaw and then became
stable afterward (Fig. 5a). Collagenase-treated group
showed a lower progressive motility throughout the
measured time points when compared with control non-
treated sperm cells; however, the level of reduction in
progressive motility was more apparent in control non-
treated spermatozoa when compared with collagenase-
treated spermatozoa (− 29% vs. -10% for control non-
treated and collagenase-treated group, respectively) (Fig. 5a).
Intriguingly, both VAP
, VCL were sharply decreased in the
control group, while a static (VAP) and even a slight
increase in VCL was observed in collagenase-treated group
(data not shown). For sperm swimming pattern, when
compared with control sperm when 2.5% glycerol was used,
collagenase-treated
spermatozoa
showed
a
significant
increase in BCF with similar linearity (Fig. 5a). When 7.8%
glycerol was used for cryopreservation protocol (Fig. 5b), in
contrast to the control group, non-treated spermatozoa
exhibited greater variations throughout the measuring time
points (0–60 min after thaw), and parameters, such as
motility, progressive motility, BCF and LIN measured for
collagenase-treated sperm, were relatively stable (Fig. 5b,
compared gray lines with black lines throughout the
time points).
Glycerol concentrations used as cryoprotectant benefit
for different aspects of chimpanzee spermatozoa
As cryopreservation processes normally compromise sperm
motility
and
reduce
fertilization
success,
we
further
compared whether different percentages of glycerol, as a
cryoprotectant, could benefit cryopreservation outcomes,
as measured by sperm morphology, viability, capacitation
status, acrosome integrity and CASA analyses. With our
Fig. 4 Analyses on cryopreserved chimpanzee spermatozoa revealed no differences between control and collagenase-treated groups. a Propidium
iodine (PI) was used to quickly assess the viability of cryopreserved semen samples; alive sperm cells showed negative signal while dead sperm cells
were stained in red (indicated with arrow heads). b-d Chimpanzee sperm cells treated with 0.1% collagenase showed no differences in sperm
abnormality, viability, capacitation rate or acrosome integrity compared with control sperm cells after cryopreserved with either 2.5% glycerol (b-c) or
7.8% glycerol (D-E). f A slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in collagenase-treated group when 7.8% glycerol was used for
cryoprotectant. Arrowheads indicate tyrosine phosphorylated protein signals; N.S: not significantly different. At least 200 sperm cells were evaluated in
each sample. Data were analyzed from 16 ejaculates from 4 individuals

 cryopreservation protocol, when compared with 2.5%
glycerol group, 7.8% glycerol group showed slightly higher
abnormality rate and lower viability rate (Fig. 6a). Although
no differences in spontaneous sperm capacitation rate were
observed between 2.5% and 7.8% glycerol cryopreserved
groups, the 2.5% glycerol cryopreserved group showed
significantly higher percentage of acrosome intact sperm-
atozoa after freezing-thawing process when compared with
7.8% glycerol cryopreserved group (72% vs. 51% for 2.5%
vs. 7.8% glycerol) (Fig. 6a, lower panel). For sperm motility-
related parameters, when 7.8% glycerol was used for cryo-
preservation, spermatozoa showed better motility, higher
progressive motility, BCF and linearity, as measured by
CASA analyses (Fig. 6b). These data demonstrated that
both 2.5% and 7.8% glycerol could be used when freezing
spermatozoa of chimpanzee sperm (Pan troglodytes), and
glycerol concentration would be beneficial to different
aspects of sperm physiological characteristics.
Discussion
Reproduction of wildlife and zoo captive species is
always a challenging issue due to low number of individ-
uals and limited area of habitats. These reasons often
result in the aging of the animals or close inbreeding
within herds, which further affects reproductive success
and leads to the extinction of specific species. Primate
species, such as chimpanzees, have a strict social struc-
ture of hierarchy in their natural state, and therefore, in
an ethnic group, only one dominant individual can
proceed the breeding with females, thus greatly reduces
genetic diversity in the particular population [26, 27]. In
most species, this dilemma can be resolved by artificial
insemination using semen samples collected from other
non-dominant male individuals.
Unlike most of the animal species, semen samples

 structure with slow semen liquefaction in nature [8–10].
This characterization has also been observed in South
American camelidae, such as llamas and alpaca, and
likely serves to ensure the success of mating competition
and the consequent inheritance of genetic materials [6,
10, 28, 29]. Upon waiting for the occurrence of natural
semen liquefaction, sperm motility declines quickly and
often results in poor semen quality and a low success
rate for pregnancy in females when used for artificial
insemination. To overcome this naturally coagulated
semen, attempts have been made in camelidae species to
facilitate semen liquefaction using various enzymes [6,
30, 31]. Results from these independent studies indicated
that 1 mg/ml collagenase affectively eliminated viscosity
of 100% and 99% of the samples in llamas and alpaca,
respectively, while fibrinolysin also seemed to be effective;
however,
in
enzyme-treated
llama
or
alpaca
semen
samples, besides the general sperm motility and viability
(assessed by manual evaluation) that were presented, no
further
information
was
available
[6,
30].
Authors
concluded that among enzymes tested, collagenase exhib-
ited the best degelification effect with minimal negative
impacts on semen quality [30, 31]. Our results demon-
strated that in line with previous reports in camelidae
species, type I collagenase was effective in eliminating
semen viscosity and that a 2.3-fold increase in sperm
concentration and a 2.7-fold increase in total sperm
number were achieved in collagenase-treated group;
however, collagenase concentration used in this study was
lower (0.1% [W/V]) than that in studies in South American
camelids, likely due to different semen composition and the
proportion of collagen present in the semen of different
species. Artificial insemination using cryopreserved samples
or semen obtained from elderly individuals normally
requires a higher number of spermatozoa to achieve
pregnancy success [32, 33]; therefore, significant increase in
sperm concentration and total spermatozoa obtained after
collagenase incubation would benefit the success of preg-
nancy and increase the number of cryopreserved semen
samples (total number of frozen straws) per ejaculation.
Fig. 6 Glycerol concentrations resulted in different protective effects on either sperm membrane integrity or motility-related characteristics. a Collagenase-
treated sperm cryopreserved with 7.8% glycerol showed higher abnormality rate and lower viability when compared with 2.5% glycerol cryopreserved
group. Differences were also observed on acrosome integrity that 7.8% glycerol group contained significantly lower acrosome intact spermatozoa after
cryopreservation processes (72% vs. 51% for 2.5% and 7.8% glycerol group). b Collagenase-treated chimpanzee sperm cryopreserved with 7.8% glycerol
exhibited higher motility, progressive motility, beat frequency cross (BCF) and linearity (LIN) when compared with 2.5% glycerol group; N.S: not significantly
different. At least 200 sperm cells were evaluated in each sample. *Indicates significant differences between groups. Relative changes within each group
(t60 vs. t10) were also indicated. Data were analyzed from 16 ejaculates from 4 individuals

characteristics, sperm motility (can be evaluated by
CASA), mortality (viability), and morphology [34]. Our
results showed that using 0.1% collagenase to facilitate
the release of spermatozoa from the colloid semen
coagulates did not lead to morphological alteration, nor
did it lead to a decrease in cell viability. Moreover, colla-
genase treatment did not stimulate spontaneous sperm
capacitation or damage acrosome integrity or affect
motility-related parameters. Collagenase is an enzyme
that facilitates the breakdown of collagen, a component,
which contributes to the viscosity and structure of
seminal fluid [35, 36]. Based on currently available
sperm and semen proteome data, depending on animal
species and physiological condition of the individual,
collagen presents in various amounts in seminal fluid,
but not on sperm membrane surface [36–41]; therefore,
under our experimental condition (0.1% collagenase,
30 min at 25 °C), the effects of collagenase likely were
limited to de-structure the collagen in the extracellular
matrix of chimpanzee semen and may not have directly
affected membrane composition of chimpanzee sperm-
atozoa, as the percentage of spontaneous capacitation or
acrosome-reacted
sperm
did
not
increase
under
collagenase treatment when compared with its control
conditions.

between
zoos or by artificial insemination of females using semen
samples collected from less dominate individuals. As we
demonstrated in this study, collagenase treatment did
not
affect
examined
sperm
parameters
in
freshly
acquired semen samples. To further evaluate whether
collagenase affects cryoprotective efficiency of glycerol-
based cryopreservation protocols, we compared sperm
capacitation status, acrosome integrity as well as sperm
motility-related parameters based on post thaw semen
samples of two glycerol concentrations (2.5%, 7.8%). No
significant between-group differences could be observed,
with or without collagenase, when either 2.5% or 7.8%
glycerol was used for cryopreservation, although a slight
increase of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected when
immunoblotting
technique
was
applied. This result
further supported the fact that collagenase did not sig-
nificantly affect physiological characteristics of chimpan-
zee spermatozoa, even if these treated sperm cells were
subjected for cryopreservation. In contrast to an earlier
report from Gould et al., which stated that 7.8% glycerol,
as a cryoprotectant, resulted in better cryopreservation
outcomes
[25],
we
observed
a
sharp
decrease
in
acrosome integrity when 7.8% glycerol was used. The
observed inconsistencies may likely be due to different
experimental setups as well as different freezing protocol
and medium used; moreover, the defined “better cryo-
preservation outcomes” in earlier study by Gould et al.
focused primarily on sperm motility rather than the
additional parameters evaluated in this study.
Our data from CASA experiments demonstrated that
at least in freshly acquired chimpanzee samples, parame-
ters evaluated (motility, progressive motility, VAP, VCL,
BCF
and
LIN)
were
not
affected
by
collagenase
treatment. However, in cryopreserved semen samples, a
significant decrease in progressive motility was observed
in collagenase-treated group when 2.5% glycerol was
used. One interesting phenomenon was that in contrast
to fast decline in motility, progressive motility, BCF and
LIN in control sperm, collagenase-treated sperm cells
showed relatively stable swimming patterns throughout
time, as measured by CASA; further experiments will be
required to reveal whether collagenase could also facili-
tate sperm cells in preserving energy due to its reaction
on quickly dissolving extracellular matrix of highly
viscous chimpanzee semen. In this study, we observed
that after collagenase treatment, 7.8% glycerol resulted
in better post-thaw motility, progressive motility BCF
and LIN; this outcome can be explained by our observa-
tion that 7.8% glycerol group showed an increase of
tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, which resulted in an
increase of hypermotile capacitated sperm; however,
2.5% glycerol provided significantly better protective
effect on sperm acrosome integrity than that of 7.8%
glycerol. These observations indicated that 2.5% glycerol
resulted in better acrosome protection, and 7.8% glycerol
gave rise to better motility, progressive motility, BCF,
and LIN; therefore, future use of glycerol for cryopre-
serving chimpanzee sperm should not only focus on
evaluating motility-related parameters but also should
take into account the assisted reproductive techniques
that will later be applied, as sperm head membrane/ac-
rosome integrity is as critically important as motility
for successful fertilization upon artificial insemination.
Conclusions
In this study, we showed that collagenase facilitates the
release of chimpanzee spermatozoa from coagulated
semen ejaculates, and more importantly we demon-
strated for the first time that chimpanzee sperm treated
with 0.1% type I collagenase did not alter sperm capaci-
tation status or acrosome integrity. Moreover, using the
CASA system, we also showed that sperm motility-
related parameters (sperm swimming patterns) were not
affected
by
collagenase
treatment.
With
significant
increase of unaltered spermatozoa acquired per ejacu-
late, we will be able to improve fertilization success and
genetic diversity of zoo captive chimpanzee species.
