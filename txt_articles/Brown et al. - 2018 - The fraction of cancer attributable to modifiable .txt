BACKGROUND: Changing population-level exposure to modifiable risk factors is a key driver of changing cancer incidence.
Understanding these changes is therefore vital when prioritising risk-reduction policies, in order to have the biggest impact on
reducing cancer incidence. UK figures on the number of risk factor-attributable cancers are updated here to reflect changing
behaviour as assessed in representative national surveys, and new epidemiological evidence. Figures are also presented by UK
constituent country because prevalence of risk factor exposure varies between them.
METHODS: Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated for combinations of risk factor and cancer type with sufficient/
convincing evidence of a causal association. Relative risks (RRs) were drawn from meta-analyses of cohort studies where possible.
Prevalence of exposure to risk factors was obtained from nationally representative population surveys. Cancer incidence data for
2015 were sourced from national data releases and, where needed, personal communications. PAF calculations were stratified by
age, sex and risk factor exposure level and then combined to create summary PAFs by cancer type, sex and country.
RESULTS: Nearly four in ten (37.7%) cancer cases in 2015 in the UK were attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was
around two percentage points higher in UK males (38.6%) than in UK females (36.8%). Comparing UK countries, the attributable
proportion was highest in Scotland (41.5% for persons) and lowest in England (37.3% for persons). Tobacco smoking contributed by
far the largest proportion of attributable cancer cases, followed by overweight/obesity, accounting for 15.1% and 6.3%, respectively,
of all cases in the UK in 2015. For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and
melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco and overweight/obesity remain the top contributors of attributable cancer cases. Tobacco smoking has the
highest PAF because it greatly increases cancer risk and has a large number of cancer types associated with it. Overweight/obesity
has the second-highest PAF because it affects a high proportion of the UK population and is also linked with many cancer types.
Public health policy may seek to mitigate the level of harm associated with exposure or reduce exposure levels—both approaches
may effectively impact cancer incidence. Differences in PAFs between countries and sexes are primarily due to varying prevalence
of exposure to risk factors and varying proportions of specific cancer types. This variation in turn is affected by socio-demographic
differences which drive differences in exposure to theoretically avoidable ‘lifestyle’ factors. PAFs at UK country level have not been
available previously and they should be used by policymakers in devolved nations. PAFs are estimates based on the best available
data, limitations in those data would generally bias toward underestimation of PAFs. Regular collection of risk factor exposure
prevalence data which corresponds with epidemiological evidence is vital for analyses like this and should remain a priority for the
UK Government and devolved Administrations.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, age-standardised incidence rates for all
cancers combined (International Classification of Diseases version
10 [ICD-10]1 C00-C97 excluding C44) have increased by 7% in the
UK, with a larger increase in females (8%) than in males (3%).2,3
Over the next two decades, incidence rates for all cancers
combined are projected to rise by 2% in the UK; this slower pace
of increase is in part due to falling smoking rates since the 1970s,
the impact of which will be seen most clearly in future decades.4
Changes in exposure to risk factors are key drivers of changes in

 cancer incidence, with improvements in cancer diagnosis and data
capture contributing to a lesser extent. Quantifying the contribu-
tion of these risk factors indicates the reduction in cancer
incidence, which could be achieved through risk exposure
reduction or removal.
Efforts to reduce exposure to theoretically modifiable cancer
risk factors at individual and societal level may be hampered by
the breadth of factors implicated (and possibly limited awareness
of some of those factors),2,3 and a lack of clarity on which factors
have the most impact on cancer risk, and therefore which to
prioritise. Risk factors which contribute the most cases to the
overall cancer burden are either those with the highest relative
risks associated with exposure, those with the highest exposure
prevalence in the population, those with the largest number of
associated common cancer types, or combinations thereof. Parkin
et al.5 published novel data on the burden of theoretically
avoidable cancer in the UK in 2010. These have informed tobacco,
alcohol and obesity policy in the UK, as well as inspiring similar
work internationally.6
International versions of Parkin5,7 work demonstrate how
nations differ markedly in the population attributable fractions
(PAFs) for specific cancer types and risk factors, and for all cancers
and risk factors combined. Several factors underpin true variation
between countries. Prevalence of exposure to risk factors varies
both with time period and geography. Age and sex profile of
cancer cases may vary, often due to different availability of and
eligible ages for screening programmes. Morphology breakdowns
of individual cancer types (e.g. oesophageal squamous cell
carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) vary with risk factor prevalence.
Proportions of individual cancer types contributing to the total
number of cancers vary due to screening availability and risk
factor prevalence. Methodological differences also contribute to
PAF differences, for example the relative risks used, calculation
methods, and choice of risk factors included.
It is not ideal therefore to use whole-UK PAFs to describe the
burden in individual UK countries when many of these factors,
most importantly the prevalence of risk factor exposure, is known
to vary between them.8 It is also important to regularly update
widely used figures such as these, to incorporate changes over
time in risk factor exposure prevalence, new high-quality evidence
on relative risks, changes in the demography of cancer patients,
and changes in official classifications of risk factor evidence
strength (by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
[IARC] and World Cancer Research Fund [WCRF]).9,10
This update builds on the methodology devised by Parkin et al.5
to provide 2015 PAFs by cancer type and risk factor for the UK
overall and for each constituent country. Differences in methodol-
ogy compared with Parkin et al.5 mainly reflect updates to
evidence and classifications, and availability and quality of UK
country-level exposure prevalence data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Risk factors included
Combinations of risk factor and cancer type were included in the
analysis if they were, at the time of the literature search for the
analysis (April 2017), classified by IARC or WCRF as having
‘sufficient’ (IARC) or ‘convincing’ (WCRF) evidence of a causal
association.9–11 If both IARC and WCRF had issued a classification
on a combination of risk factor and cancer type, then the most
recently issued classification was used; the source of each
classification used is shown in Supplementary Material A. Cancer
types with no risk factors classified as having ‘sufficient’ or
‘convincing’ evidence of a causal association (e.g. prostate and
testicular cancers) were not included in any PAF calculations, but
were included in the all cancers combined total. For oral
contraceptives, which increase risk for some cancer types but
decrease risk for others, PAFs were calculated only for the cancer
types where risk is increased, as the aim of this study is to quantify
cancers caused, not the net effect. Ethics approval was not
required and the study was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
PAF formula
For most risk factors, PAFs were calculated using the standard
formula described by Parkin et al.7

where p1 is the proportion of the population in exposure level 1
(and so on) and ERR1 is the excess relative risk (relative risk – 1) at
exposure level 1 (and so on).
Where relative risk (RR) was provided for the presence of/
increase in a risk factor when the PAF was to be calculated for the
absence of/decrease in that risk factor, ERR was calculated as the
natural logarithm of the reciprocal of the RR (ln(1/RR)). Where RR
was provided for multiple units when the calculation required ERR
per unit, ERR for x units was divided by x to obtain ERR per unit.
For some risk factors PAFs were obtained from other published
studies, as was the case in Parkin et al.5 This applied to PAFs for
Epstein–Barr virus,12 human papillomavirus (HPV),13,14 Kaposi
sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV8),15 and
diagnostic radiation.16
Where IARC/WCRF classifications were specific to cancer type
subsites, morphological types, or patient age groups (Supplemen-
tary Material C), the number of attributable cases was calculated
using only those specific attributes, and the PAF used those
specific cases as the numerator and the total cases of that overall
cancer type as the denominator. For example, the overweight/
obesity PAF for stomach cancer uses the attributable cases of
gastric cardia stomach cancer, within the total cases of stomach
cancer overall. This applied to meningioma and postmenopausal
breast cancer for overweight/obesity (denominators were brain
tumours and breast cancers); non-cardia stomach cancer and
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma for Helicobacter
pylori (denominators were stomach cancer and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma); conjunctiva for HIV (denominator was eye cancer);
salivary gland and all leukaemias excluding chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia for ionising radiation (denominators were oral cavity
cancer and all leukaemias combined); and mucinous ovarian
cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia for tobacco (denominators
were ovarian cancer and all leukaemias combined).
Relative risks
RRs were identified through systematic PubMed searches (search
terms are shown in Supplementary Material B, selected relative
risks and sources are shown in Supplementary Material C). Meta-
analyses were the preferred source of RRs, followed by pooled
analyses and cohort studies, with case–control studies selected
only when no other sources could be found. Within meta- and
pooled analyses where multiple analyses were reported, or where
more than one meta- or pooled analysis was available, RRs were
selected based on characteristics most relevant to the evidence.
For example, where statistically significant variation between
pooled estimates for different world regions was observed, the
Europe/UK estimate was preferred; where there was statistically
significant male versus female variation, sex-specific RRs were
used; and where confounding was a particular concern, RRs with
the most comprehensive adjustment for confounders were
selected. Sample size and compatibility with the format of
exposure prevalence data were also considered in these decisions,
for example, tobacco exposure prevalence was usually defined as
cigarette smoking rather than use of other tobacco products, so
RRs for cigarettes rather than all tobacco products were used
where available. The relative risk of leukaemia associated with

 ionising radiation exposure was calculated using the formula
presented by Parkin et al.5
Risk factor exposure prevalence
For the majority of risk factors analysed, cancer risk increases with
higher exposure, the optimum exposure level is nil, and the
reference category in the RR sources is ‘unexposed’ (Supplemen-
tary Material D). For fibre, physical activity and breastfeeding,
increased cancer risk is associated with lower exposure. Fibre
exposure
prevalence
was
calculated
as
deficit
against
UK
Government recommended levels at the time the PAFs were
calculated (30 g per day of fibre).17 Physical activity exposure
prevalence was calculated as deficit against the reference
category in the RR source (600 metabolic equivalent [MET]-
minutes, or 150 min of moderate-intensity activity per week),
because the latest evidence indicates that significant reductions in
bowel cancer risk are only achieved at higher physical activity
levels than the UK Government recommends.18 Breastfeeding
exposure prevalence was calculated as absence of the behaviour.
While the World Health Organization recommendation (based on
benefits to the child) is to breastfeed for 6 months,19 the
prevalence data available are insufficient to accurately gauge
duration of breastfeeding across all the UK countries. For factors
where UK Government recommendations are maximum rather
than minimum intake (alcohol and processed meat),20,21 the
optimum exposure was defined as nil.
Prevalence of exposure to risk factors was generally obtained
from nationally representative population surveys (Supplementary
Material D), at as granular a breakdown of age and sex as the data
allowed. Where UK- or Great Britain-wide surveys with a country
breakdown provided an adequate sample size for each constitu-
ent nation, these were used to afford direct comparability
between countries; however, in most cases a separate survey
(e.g. national health surveys, which are powered for devolved
nations’ analysis) was used for each country. Data were obtained
for 2005 for each country wherever possible, providing a ten-year
lag between risk exposure and cancer incidence. In some cases it
was not possible to match years across countries. Conversions or
imputations were made where exposure prevalence data were not
available for all cohorts required. These calculations are described
in Supplementary Material E; where no calculations are described
the data were lifted directly from source with no conversion or
imputation required. References are provided in Supplementary
Material.
Incidence
Cancer incidence data for 2015 were obtained for each of the UK
constituent countries mainly from their routine annual publica-
tions.22–25 Generally these publications provided data at the ICD-
10 3-digit level. A small number of calculations required incidence
data not routinely published: by 4-digit ICD-10 code (e.g. brain,
other central nervous system and intracranial tumours), by
morphology (e.g. oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma), or for rarer cancer types (e.g. gallbladder and
sinonasal cancers). For these calculations, the UK countries’ cancer
registries kindly provided appropriate data (Information Services
Division Scotland, September 2016, Scotland 2012–2014 incidence
data for oesophageal adenocarcinoma, oesophageal squamous
cell
carcinoma,

Combining PAFs
PAFs for all risk factors combined, for each cancer type and for all
cancers combined, were obtained by first applying the first
relevant PAF in the sequence shown in Table 1 to the total
number of observed cases, to obtain the number of cases
attributable to that factor only. The order of risk factors within the
sequence does not affect the result of the sum, the order in
Table 1 runs from highest to lowest UK PAF within males, females
and persons separately. Each subsequent PAF in the sequence was
applied only to the number of observed cases not yet explained
by the risk factors earlier in the sequence, as described by Parkin
et al.26 Though the RRs used in the PAFs calculations are generally
adjusted and therefore should represent only the effect of the
specific risk factor in isolation, residual confounding remains
possible. This aggregation method avoids overestimating PAFs for
all risk factors combined but does not account for cases caused by
exposure to risk factors in combination, e.g. the synergistic effect
of tobacco and alcohol on oesophageal cancer risk, or of HPV and
tobacco smoking on cervical cancer risk.
RESULTS
Summary results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. More detailed
results by risk factor–cancer type combination, cancer type, sex
and country are presented in Supplementary Material F.
UK
Nearly four in ten (37.7%) cancer cases in 2015 in the UK were
attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was around two
percentage points higher in UK males (38.6%) than in UK females
(36.8%). Excluding sex-specific cancer types (cervix, ovary, uterus,
vagina, vulva, penis [prostate and testicular have no risk factor-
attributable cases in these calculations]) and breast cancer, the
proportion was much higher in UK males (36.4%) than in UK
females (25.6%).
The attributable proportion for all cancers combined was
highest in Scotland (41.5% for persons) and lowest in England
(37.3% for persons). Between-country variation was margin-
ally larger for males than for females, with around five (males)
and four (females) percentage points between highest and
lowest.
Tobacco smoking contributed by far the largest proportion of
attributable cancer cases, accounting for 15.1% of all cases in the
UK in 2015. Smoking had the highest PAF in all the UK countries.
The proportion was higher in UK males (17.7%) than in UK females
(12.4%), reflecting higher smoking prevalence in males in 2005.
The tobacco smoking-attributable proportion of cancer cases was
highest in Scotland (18.2% for persons) and lowest in Northern
Ireland (14.6% for persons). The cancer types with the highest
PAFs for tobacco smoking were lung (72.2% for UK persons) and
larynx (64.0% for UK persons).
Overweight and obesity was the second-largest preventable
cause of cancer in the UK and accounted for 6.3% of all cases in
the UK in 2015. This factor was second-highest in all the UK
constituent countries. The proportion was higher in UK females
(7.5%) than in UK males (5.2%), and was highest in Scotland (6.8%
for persons) and lowest in Wales (5.4% for persons). The cancer
types with the highest PAFs for overweight and obesity were
uterine for females (34.0% for UK females) and oesophagus for
males (31.3% for UK males).
UV radiation and occupational risks contributed the next-
highest proportions of attributable cases (both 3.8% in UK
persons), both with less than one percentage point difference in
PAFs between highest (Scotland for occupation, England for UV)
and lowest (England for occupation, Wales for UV) countries.

Cancer attributable to risk factors, UK 2015
KF Brown et al.
1134
 Exposure to infections, alcohol drinking and insufficient dietary
fibre each contributed 2–4% of attributable cancer cases in UK
persons. The remaining factors contributed less than 2% each.
For 10 cancer types, including two female-specific sites, more
than 70% of cases in UK persons were attributable to known risk
factors: Kaposi sarcoma (100%), cervical (99.8%), mesothelioma
(94.4%), anal (91.3%), pharyngeal (88.4%), nasopharyngeal (85.0%),
melanoma (86.5%), lung (78.9%), vaginal (75.0%) and laryngeal
(72.5%).
England
Almost four in ten (37.3%) cancer cases in 2015 in England
were attributable to known risk factors. The proportion differed
only marginally between England males (38.0%) and females
(36.4%), in contrast to the other UK countries where the sex
difference was larger. The overall PAF was lowest in England males
and second-lowest in England females, when comparing between
countries.
Tobacco
smoking
contributed
the
largest
proportion
of
England’s
attributable
cancer
cases
(14.7%).
This
was
the
second-lowest tobacco smoking-attributable proportion among
the UK countries. Overweight and obesity contributed the second-
highest proportion of cases in England (6.3%) and this proportion
was second-highest among the UK countries.
England had the joint-largest (with Scotland) sex difference in
the UK in alcohol PAFs, with a lower PAF for males (3.0%) than for
females (3.5%).
Among the UK countries, England had the highest PAFs for
UV radiation and air pollution. England had the lowest or
joint-lowest PAF among the UK countries for a number of risk

 factors, including alcohol drinking, insufficient dietary fibre
and occupational risks.
These PAF differences reflect risk factor exposure prevalence,
for example England’s current smoking prevalence was the lowest
in the UK in 2005, and its overweight and obesity prevalence was
the highest in the UK in 2005.
Scotland
Around four in ten (41.5%) cancer cases in 2015 in Scotland were
attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was nearly four
percentage points higher in Scotland males (43.3%) than in
females (39.7%). The overall PAF was the highest among the UK
countries for both males and females.
These PAF differences reflect risk factor exposure prevalence,
but also proportion of specific cancer types in the all cancers
combined total. For example, 2005 smoking prevalence is not
markedly higher in Scotland than in the other UK countries, but
Scotland has a higher proportion of lung cancer cases in its all
cancer combined total.
Tobacco
smoking
contributed
the
largest
proportion
of
attributable cancer cases in Scotland (18.2%). This was by far the
largest tobacco smoking-attributable proportion among the UK
countries, around two percentage points higher than the next-
highest country. Overweight and obesity contributed the second-
highest proportion of cases (6.8%) and again this proportion was
highest among the UK countries, though the between-country
variation here was smaller.
Scotland had the joint-largest (with England) sex difference in
the UK in alcohol PAFs, but in the opposite direction to England
with a higher PAF in males (3.8%) than in females (3.3%).
Scotland had the lowest PAF in the UK for only one risk factor:
ionising radiation. For all other risk factors Scotland had the
highest or second-highest PAF in the UK.
Wales
Nearly four in ten (37.8%) cancer cases in 2015 in Wales were
attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was more than
two percentage points higher in Wales males (39.0%) than in
females (36.5%). The overall females PAF was second-highest
among the UK countries.
Tobacco smoking and overweight and obesity contributed the
highest proportions of cases (16.1% and 5.4% respectively). The
overweight and obesity PAF was lowest in Wales compared with
the other UK countries.
Wales had the highest PAFs in the UK for ionising radiation and
postmenopausal hormones, and the lowest or joint-lowest PAFs in
the UK for processed meat, infections, UV radiation, alcohol,
physical activity, air pollution and not breastfeeding.
Risk factor exposure prevalence again underpins these results:
Wales had particularly low obesity prevalence in 2004/2005
(although
overweight
prevalence
was
similar
to
other
UK
countries), and radon levels are slightly higher in Wales than
elsewhere in the UK.
Northern Ireland
Nearly four in ten (38.0%) cancer cases in 2015 in Northern Ireland
were attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was nearly
four percentage points higher in Northern Ireland males (39.9%)
than in females (36.1%).
Northern Ireland’s tobacco PAF was the lowest among the UK
countries for males and females combined, though this was
mainly driven by the between-country pattern in females.
Northern Ireland had the largest sex difference in the UK in
tobacco smoking PAFs, with the PAF around 50% higher in males
(17.8%) than in females (11.3%).
Tobacco smoking and overweight and obesity contributed the
highest proportions of cases in Northern Ireland (14.6% and 6.2%
respectively).
Northern Ireland had the highest or joint-highest PAFs in the UK
for processed meat, insufficient dietary fibre, insufficient physical
activity, oral contraceptives, not breastfeeding, and alcohol—
though for all these factors the difference was very small. It had
the joint-lowest (with Wales) PAF in the UK for air pollution.
Prevalence of diet and physical activity risk factors was higher in
Northern Ireland in 2005 compared with the other UK countries.
Although Northern Ireland’s air pollution concentrations were
second-lowest to Scotland, the higher proportion of lung cancer in
Scotland meant more air pollution-attributable cases there.
DISCUSSION
Variation by sex and country
Variation by UK country and sex was generally only a few
percentage points, so these differences should be interpreted
cautiously.
Males have higher prevalence of exposure to risk factors than
do females, across almost all risk factors and UK countries.
Tobacco smoking, overweight and obesity, meat-eating, and
alcohol drinking are more common and/or at higher levels in men
than in women27–30). Fibre is a notable exception, with lower
intake, and accordingly higher PAFs, in females than in males. The
male excess in risk factor exposure is generally not offset by the
female-only cancer types, with the exceptions of overweight and
obesity, infections, and ionising radiation, where PAFs are higher
in females than in males mainly because of sex-specific cancers,
some of which have high PAFs. Nor is men’s higher risk factor
exposure offset by female-only risk factors such as exogenous
hormone use and non-breastfeeding.
The relative risk of cancer associated with risk factor exposure is
often higher in males than in females (although this may relate to
sample size and statistical power, discussed in more detail below),
so even where exposure levels are similar, the estimated
population impact is higher in males than in females. The all
cancers combined total in males comprises a higher proportion of
tobacco smoking-associated cancer types with high individual
PAFs, while in females some of the largest contributors to the all
cancers combined total have reasonably low individual PAFs (e.g.
23.0% for breast cancer). Sex-specific cancers contribute much
more to the total PAF for females than for males, with breast
cancer accounting for most of the difference.
Differences between countries in the all cancers combined PAFs
are due to a combination of two related factors: risk factor
exposure prevalence and proportions of specific cancer types.
Differences in risk factor exposure prevalence between countries
are to some extent a reflection of data availability and quality in
each nation, and comparisons between countries’ PAFs should be
made with this in mind. Any true differences probably reflect
demographic differences which drive those ‘lifestyle’ differences.
For example, areas with higher levels of socioeconomic depriva-
tion have higher tobacco smoking rates31; areas with larger
populations which eschew alcohol for faith reasons have lower
alcohol-drinking rates.32 Further, many lifestyle ‘choices’ are driven
by environmental/societal factors such as food pricing and
availability, and susceptibility to these factors varies with socio-
economic position.33 Differences in risk factor exposure preva-
lence between countries are generally not large, with the
exception of H. pylori which may reflect both differing deprivation
levels across the UK and artefact due to differing data periods.34
Factors
beyond

control
also
vary
between
countries, for example, the predominant occupation groups and
air pollution levels. Geographical variation, for example, in radon
and UV exposure levels is not controllable (although individuals
and Government can take steps to ameliorate the risk associated
with those factors). Similarly, having a higher proportion of
workers in ‘cancer risk’ industries may not translate to a higher
proportion of occupation-related cancers, as employers and

 Government can implement risk-reduction policies; however, the
country-specific occupation PAFs presented here account only for
variation in workforce size, not for possible variation in workplace
safety.
Variation by risk factor
Risk factors with the largest PAFs are either those with the highest
relative risks associated with exposure, those with the highest
exposure prevalence in the population, those with the largest
number of associated common cancer types, or combinations
thereof. For example, tobacco smoking rates are lower than
alcohol drinking rates but tobacco smoking has a much greater
impact on cancer risk, and a much larger number of cancer types
associated with it, leading to a much higher PAF.
Comparison with other relevant studies
The results reported here are overall in line with those from similar
studies, though methodological differences—different groups of
risk factors used, different time periods and different relative risk
sources—preclude direct comparisons. For all modifiable risk
factors and all cancers combined where the UK 2015 PAF was
37.7%, other reported PAFs include 42.0% in the US in 2014;35
40.8% in Alberta, Canada in 2012;36 and 31.9% in Australia in
2010.37 In all these studies the preventable proportion was higher
in males than in females, with the gap widest in Canada (3.7
percentage points) and smallest in the US (1.0 percentage points),
in line with the 1.8 percentage point sex difference reported here.
Tobacco contributed the highest proportion of preventable cases
across the board (PAFs ranging from 19.0% in the US 2014 to
13.4% in Australia 2010; 15.1% in the UK 2015), with between-
country variation reflecting method differences and, arguably,
temporal changes in smoking prevalence worldwide. Overweight
and obesity was the second-biggest cause of cancer after tobacco
in the US 2014 (PAF 7.8%) and UK 2015 (PAF 6.3%), and ranked
third in Canada 2012 (PAF 4.3%) and fourth in Australia 2010 (PAF
3.4%). Between-country variation here mainly reflects geographi-
cal and temporal differences in overweight/obesity prevalence,
and is in line with Arnold and colleagues’ global overweight/
obesity PAFs calculations for 2012,38 reinforcing their conclusion
that the UK has among the highest proportion of overweight/
obesity-associated cancers in the world.
The obvious reference point for this work is the UK PAFs
published by Parkin and colleagues in 2011.5 The all cancers
combined PAF for UK persons presented here (37.7%) is almost
five percentage points lower than the equivalent figure obtained
by Parkin et al. (42.7%).26 This does not represent a direct
temporal change: changes in risk factor prevalence, cancer
incidence and study methodology have all contributed to this
difference.
This study has built on Parkin et al.5 Risk factors with probable/
limited evidence for associations with specific cancer types were
included by Parkin et al.,5 but have not been included in this
study. The difference in inclusion criteria for risk factor-cancer type
combinations partly explains the lower PAFs seen here compared
with Parkin et al.'s5 work, though this effect is reduced by the
addition of new combinations which have been classified as
sufficient/convincing over the last 6 years.
This study has used specific cancer type subsites, morphological
types and patient age groups where evidence of causality was
specific to those attributes, where Parkin et al.5 often used entire
cancer types in their calculations.
The evidence base on relative cancer risk for specific risk factor-
cancer type associations has improved since Parkin et al.'s5 study,
with many more meta-analyses available now. These gold
standard evidence syntheses have been used in preference
to
single
studies
wherever
possible
in
this
work.
The
meta-analyses used in this study typically report lower relative
risks than the single studies used by Parkin et al.,5 and this is an
important explanation for the difference in PAFs between the
studies.
Risk factor exposure prevalence is different in this study
compared with Parkin et al.,5 and this explains a large part of
the difference in PAFs obtained. Risk factor exposure prevalence
changed between 2000 (ref. 5) and 2005. In this period shifts both
towards optimal population prevalence (e.g. reduction in smoking
prevalence) and away from it (e.g. increase in overweight and
obesity
prevalence).
This
study
used
risk
factor
exposure
prevalence data
from each UK constituent
country where
available, where Parkin et al.5 typically used England or Great
Britain as a proxy for the whole UK.
In Parkin et al.'s5 estimated 2010 cancer incidence data,
smoking-related cancers contributed 52% of the males all cancers
combined total, and 43% of the females all cancers combined
total. In this study’s observed 2015 cancer incidence data, these
proportions were 50% and 42%. Therefore even if the 2015 cancer
type PAFs were identical to the 2010 cancer type PAFs, the all
cancers combined PAF would be lower simply because the
proportion of smoking-related cancers in the all cancers combined
denominator is lower.
The largest methodological difference between Parkin et al.5
and the current work is in tobacco smoking—but method
differences apart, tobacco smoking PAFs have fallen over this
time because of reductions in smoking prevalence. Calculating the
2010 tobacco PAF using 2000 smoking prevalence with the same
method as in this study produces PAFs of 19.9%, 12.2% and 16.1%
for UK males, females and persons respectively—markedly higher
than the corresponding 2015 PAFs of 17.7%, 12.4% and 15.1%.
Differences in methodology do also contribute to the different
PAFs between studies. Here, lower RRs from meta-analyses have
been used, while Parkin et al.5 used higher RRs mainly from single
studies, and this is a key driver of the PAF differences. The use of
survey-reported smoking prevalence rather than notional smoking
prevalence as used by Parkin et al.5 made a smaller difference. The
main benefit of using notional prevalence is that latency between
smoking and cancer does not need to be defined,39,40 and the
choice of latency in the current work is almost certainly too short
for tobacco smoking. To use a different lag for smoking than for
the other risk factors would not have been systematic, given the
similarly sparse data on latency for smoking and for the other risk
factors included in this work. Aside from this latency-related
benefit, using notional in incidence PAF calculations across
multiple cancer types is problematic because it represents a
substantial deviation from the original purpose of the method and
therefore requires many assumptions which were not considered
reliable enough for use in the current study.
There are other methodological differences between this study
and Parkin et al.5 which influenced the PAFs, but these are
relatively small. The UV radiation PAF was calculated using several
theoretically UV-unexposed/less UV-exposed groups rather than
the single less-exposed birth cohort used in the original project, in
an effort to reduce the impact of overdiagnosis in skin cancer
which is thought to have increased over time.41 However these
PAFs probably reflect increased diagnosis as well as true increased
incidence, and the relative contribution of each is impossible to
assess. Alcohol consumption and breastfeeding prevalence were
calculated as categorical rather than continuous variables, in order
to minimise the amount of manipulation and assumption around
the exposure prevalence data and to better match the sources of
relative risks. Moderate physical activity was defined as 4 METs
rather than 6 METs as used by Parkin et al.,5 again to better match
the source of relative risks and reflect the World Health
Organization definition of moderate physical activity.42 The
optimum level of physical activity was defined as exceeding,
rather than just reaching, 10 MET-hours per week, because recent
evidence

 meat and meat products were included with processed meat in
this study where they were excluded from meat calculations in
Parkin et al.,5 because the definition of these categories places
them fairly clearly in the processed category and they make up a
sizeable proportion of processed meat intake. The optimum fibre
intake was defined as 30 g/day rather than 23 g/day to reflect the
current guidelines which form the context for policymakers’ use of
the current study’s results. Cases caused by oral contraceptive use
were included in the all cancers combined PAF where oral
contraceptives were excluded altogether from the all cancers
combined PAF in ref. 5 because of the net protective effect of oral
contraceptive use. A net protective effect was observed in the
current study (around 4,400 cases prevented and around 800
cases caused), but there is a burden of preventable cases
nonetheless and the aim of this work was to quantify preventable
cases. The effect of including the causal effect of oral contra-
ceptives in the overall PAF is minimal: omitting oral contraceptives
entirely from the UK persons all cancers combined PAF would
reduce that PAF by only 0.2 percentage points.
Strengths and limitations
This
work
provides
UK
and
constituent
country-level
PAF
estimates for the full compendium of risk factors where evidence
of a causal role in cancer development is sufficient/convincing.
PAFs at this level have not been available previously and they will
be useful for policymakers in devolved nations. Further, at a UK
level this work updates the original evidence from Parkin et al.,5
and this update is timely given changes in risk factor exposure
prevalence and developments in epidemiological evidence.
The PAFs presented here are estimates based on the best
available data; therefore, the PAFs should be interpreted with the
limitations of the source data (and the limitations of the
calculations made on those data) in mind. Most of these
limitations would bias toward underestimation of PAFs in the
current work. Traditional confidence intervals cannot be provided
due to the multiple components in the PAF calculation. Sensitivity
analyses—using the upper and lower confidence intervals of the
RR and risk factor exposure prevalence data to calculate the
highest- and lowest-possible PAFs—were conducted for most risk
factor-cancer type combinations, as colleagues using the same
PAF calculation method have done.5,6 However, as in these
colleagues’ work, the results of those analyses are not reported
here lest they be misleading, the ranges implying precision
though they do not take into account all the possible biases
operating on the components of the PAF calculations.43
Restricting to risk factors with IARC/WCRF-classified sufficient/
convincing evidence of a causal link with cancer is likely to
underestimate the true PAF, as genuine risk factor-cancer type
combinations may not yet be clear. For example, evidence is
mounting for a causal association between obesity and risk of
advanced prostate cancer,44,45 and were this risk factor–cancer
type combination to be included in the present calculations, the
overall PAF for males would increase slightly. For some risk
factor–site–sex combinations, the association is not statistically
significant in the latest evidence, so the RR has been set to 1 in the
PAF calculations (Supplementary Material C) resulting in no
attributable cases. This may in some cases reflect lack of statistical
power (particularly for rarer cancer types and less prevalent
behaviours) rather than a genuine lack of association. Excluding all
non-significant RRs has almost certainly resulted in conservative
PAFs.
Comparison between risk factors is only as reliable as the
relative risk evidence available, and in most cases confounding
cannot be completely ruled out. For example, the alcohol PAFs are
likely to be underestimates as ‘unexposed’ reference groups in
this literature often include ex- and occasional drinkers, which
dilutes the observed effect of alcohol drinking on cancer risk.46
The relative risk figures used were identified and selected
systematically but different choices here would influence the
PAFs.
Perhaps one of the most vexed issues in PAF calculation is
latency, and the results presented here are certainly affected by
using a blanket ten-year latency period across all risk factors. PAF
calculations are limited by the availability of relative risk and
exposure prevalence data for the relevant period. There would be
bias in calculating a PAF assuming 30-year latency, with poor
exposure prevalence data and relative risk from a study with only
a ten-year follow-up, just as there is in calculating a PAF using
good exposure prevalence and appropriate relative risk data
assuming a 10-year latency which is too short. Clear data on
latency between exposure and cancer development are lacking,
moreso for some cancer types than others, and using bespoke
lags for each cancer type in this study would have been
unsystematic and reduced comparability between risk factors.
Tobacco smoking has the most evidence for a longer latency and
as tobacco smoking prevalence is falling, the tobacco smoking
PAF is almost certainly an underestimate. Despite this, calculating
the UK 2015 PAF for tobacco smoking using a 20-year latency
produces only a 1 percentage point increase compared with the
10-year latency 2015 PAF, therefore supporting the use of a
shorter latency with higher quality data for the UK countries.
PAFs for individual
risk factor–cancer
type
combinations
represent the fraction of that cancer attributable to that risk
factor in isolation, when the effect of other risk factors has been
controlled for in the relative risk figure. Control for confounding is
easier for some risk factors and cancer types than others. The
method of summing individual PAFs to reach the all factors
combined total for each risk factor avoids overestimation by
applying PAFs sequentially only to the cases not attributed for by
factors earlier in the sequence. The issue of cancer cases with
more than one cause is distinct from that of cancer cases caused
by the synergistic effects of risk factors in combination. For
example, the effect of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking
together on oesophageal cancer risk,47 or on radon and smoking
together on lung cancer risk,48 is several times greater than the
effects of these factors individually. Synergistic effects have not
been included in the calculations reported here for several
reasons. National survey data on prevalence of combined risk
factor exposure are not sufficiently detailed for use in PAF
calculations, and IARC and WCRF do not comment explicitly on
synergistic effects so those cancer type-risk factor combinations
cannot be evaluated against our inclusion criteria. Further, there is
a strong possibility of double-counting if synergistic effects are
included: residual confounding in the RRs for individual risk factors
(a particular concern for alcohol RRs being confounded by
tobacco) would mean that some of the ‘alcohol-only’ cases
actually do reflect alcohol and tobacco in combination; adding
‘official’ alcohol and tobacco synergy cases to this would arguably
risk overestimating the PAF.
Risk factor exposure prevalence data from surveys is prone to
self-reporting errors, particularly underestimation of exposure.49
Throughout the analysis some datapoints for specific countries or
time periods were not available, and so imputation, estimation
and extrapolation (see Supplementary Material E) were required to
fill those gaps. This has particularly affected the devolved nations’
results, and this project demonstrates the value of collecting risk
factor exposure prevalence data consistently across countries,
regularly,
and
in
a
format
which
facilitates
linkage
with
epidemiological data in order to calculate the most accurate PAFs.
Operationalising overweight and obesity prevalence, alcohol
consumption, and breastfeeding prevalence as categorical rather
than continuous variables is likely to have overestimated the PAFs
for these risk factors. However, available exposure prevalence and
relative risk data were overwhelmingly categorical, so converting
to continuous data would have introduced further uncertainty.
RRs comparing categories of people will overestimate the effect
Cancer attributable to risk factors, UK 2015
KF Brown et al.
1138
 for those very near to the category boundary and underestimate
the effect for those furthest away from it. If the exposure
prevalence distribution is left-skewed (more people near the
boundary with optimum exposure), as is the case for overweight
and obesity, then the PAF is likely to be an overestimate. This is
less of a concern if the within-category distribution is similar in the
RR source and the exposure prevalence. However, this information
is rarely reported and so the risk of PAF overestimation on this
basis cannot be quantified. More accurate PAFs could be
calculated if relative risks and exposure prevalence were reported
continuously rather than categorically.
The physical activity PAF may be an overestimate as those
people achieving 600 + MET-min in less than 5 days were
classified as inadequately active. Exposure prevalence data were
provided as days when 30 + min moderate physical activity was
achieved, rather than total minutes per week. Exposure prevalence
data are collected
in a format matching
the current UK
Government physical activity guidelines but the latest evidence
shows
that
these
guidelines
need
to
be
exceeded
quite
substantially to impact bowel cancer risk.
Air pollution PAFs are based on exposure prevalence in 2010,
although outdoor air pollution levels have decreased markedly
over past decades.50 However in the absence of firm evidence on
latency in this area, erring toward underestimating the PAF was
preferred.
The occupation chapter in the original UK attributable cancers
project was based on a large separate piece of work and it was
beyond the scope of this update to re-create that work. The method
used to derive country-level PAFs for occupation here is crude but the
results are not unexpected: Among the UK countries Scotland and
Wales have the highest overall occupation PAFs and those countries
have the highest proportions of the workforce in industries with the
highest exposure to cancer risk factors (construction and manufactur-
ing, specifically mining). Removing shiftwork and non-melanoma skin
cancer from the PAF estimates in the original attributable cancers
project report was offset by adjusting for country-specific occupa-
tional exposure levels, so the all cancers combined occupation PAF for
the UK has remained similar to the original estimate.
Oral contraceptives calculations use the most recent freely
available data with appropriate age breakdowns, from 2010 to
2012. These were assumed accurate for ‘current’ use in 2015 (as
the RRs are for current use at the time of cancer diagnosis). The
validity of this assumption cannot be checked with freely available
data, but marked change is unlikely in 3–5 years. For the
exogenous hormones calculations there were no freely available
data on prevalence of use by preparation type or duration of use,
which necessitated a simplified (and arguably weaker) methodol-
ogy in comparison to Parkin et al.5 The relative risks used in the
calculations are not preparation or duration-specific and are from
a UK population, so the distribution of preparation types and use
durations in the exposure prevalence data are expected to be
close to that in the relative risk data.
Calculations for ionising radiation may overestimate radon-
attributable cases as radon prevalence at country level was taken
from recent Public Health England data which focuses on high-
radon areas rather than a random sample;51 however, it is unlikely
that the magnitude of overestimation varies between countries.
Expectations for future years’ PAFs in the UK
Tobacco
smoking
currently
contributes
by
far
the
largest
proportion of UK cancer cases attributable to risk factor exposure,
and as prevalence of this behaviour is falling, so the tobacco PAF is
expected to fall in future. This assumes that tobacco smoking
prevalence will continue to fall in future, but this is not
guaranteed; progress to date in this area is thanks to public
health initiatives, including mass media cessation campaigns, Stop
Smoking Services, smoke free legislation and plain packaging for
tobacco products.52 Despite this, a wide disparity in smoking rates
exists between different societal groups, for example, rates remain
very high among those with mental health conditions.53 Some
groups will need more support to quit so effective smoking
cessation interventions should continue to be provided by the
government and the NHS to maintain the current momentum and
address health inequalities.54
Overweight and obesity contributes the second-highest pro-
portion of attributable cases and prevalence of this risk factor is
rising, so this PAF is expected to rise in future. Evidence for the
impact of high BMI on cancer risk is still growing, so more cancer
types could also be classified as having strong evidence for an
association with BMI, which would also increase the PAF. The PAF
gap between tobacco and overweight and obesity will shrink in
future if current overweight and obesity prevalence trends
continue. Current initiatives, including the UK Government’s Soft
Drinks Industry Levy and Sugar Reduction programme, may slow
the increase, but a more comprehensive approach as seen in
tobacco may be necessary to significantly reduce prevalence.55
This should include recommendations made by Public Health
England such as restrictions to the advertising of foods high in fat,
sugar, and salt.56
Factors not included in these calculations may impact on PAFs
by affecting the mix of cancer types in the all cancers combined
total. Screening for bowel, cervical and breast cancer, and HPV
vaccination, may reduce the proportion of cancer types which
contribute a large number of preventable cases in the current
calculations, reducing the overall PAF. Introduction of further
screening programmes would also affect the overall PAFs.57–59 In
addition, incidence could fall for some cancers in the future with
more conservative testing practice—for example, if prostate
cancer incidence falls with more conservative use of PSA testing
in future, the proportion of non-risk-factor-attributable cancer
cases in the all cancers combined total will be reduced, increasing
the overall PAF.
CONCLUSION
Known risk factors are responsible for a substantial proportion of
UK cancer cases. Prevention efforts which focus on smoking and
overweight and obesity are likely to have the largest population-
level impact. Between-country variation likely reflects population
demographics; deprived communities across the UK require
additional support to reduce their cancer risk. Evidence from this
study should be used to focus efforts on reducing the number and
proportions of cancers attributable to preventable risk factors
across the countries of the UK Department of Health.20
