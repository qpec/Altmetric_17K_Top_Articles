INTRODUCTION: Malaria parasites cause
human disease by invading and replicating
inside red blood cells. InthecaseofPlasmodium
falciparum, this can lead to severe forms of ma-
laria that are a major cause of childhood mor-
tality in Africa. This species of parasite enters
the red blood cell through interactions with sur-
face proteins including the glycophorins GYPA
and GYPB, which determine the polymorphic
MNS blood group system. In a recent genome-
wide association study, we identified alleles as-
sociated with protection against severe malaria
near the cluster of genes encoding these inva-
sion receptors.
RATIONALE: Investigation of genetic variants
at this locus and their relation to severe malaria
is challenging because of the high sequence simi-
larity between the neighboring glycophorin genes
and the relative lack of available sequence data
capturing the genetic diversity of sub-Saharan
Africa. To better assess whether variation in the
glycophorin genes could explain the signal of
association, we generated additional sequence
data from sub-Saharan African populations
and developed an analytical approach to char-
acterize structural variation at this complex
locus.
RESULTS: Using 765 newly sequenced human
genomes from 10 African ethnic groups along
with data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we
generated a reference panel of haplotypes across
the glycophorin region. In addition to single-
nucleotide polymorphisms and short indels, we
assayed large copy number variants (CNVs) using
sequencing read depth and uncovered exten-
sive structural diversity. By imputing from this
reference panel into 4579 severe malaria cases
and 5310 controls from three African popula-
tions, we found that a complex CNV, here called
DUP4, is associated with resistance to severe ma-
laria and fully explains the previously reported
signal of association. In our sample, DUP4 is
present only in east Africa, and this localiza-
tion, as well as the extent of similarity between
DUP4 haplotypes, suggests that it has recently
increased in frequency, presumably under nat-
ural selection due to malaria.
To evaluate the potential functional conse-
quences of this structural variant, we analyzed
high-coverage sequence-read data from mul-
tiple individuals to gener-
ate a model of the DUP4
chromosome structure. The
DUP4 haplotype contains
five glycophorin genes, in-
cluding two hybrid genes
that juxtapose the extra-
cellulardomainofGYPBwiththetransmembrane
and intracellular domains of GYPA. Noting that
these predicted hybrids are characteristic of the
Dantu antigen in the MNS blood group system,
we sequenced a Dantu positive individual and
confirmed that DUP4 is the molecular basis of
the Dantu NE blood group variant.
CONCLUSION: Although a role for GYPA and
GYPB in parasite invasion is well known, a di-
rect link between glycophorin polymorphisms
and clinical susceptibility to malaria has been
elusive. Here we have provided a systematic
catalog of CNVs, describing structural diversity
that may have functional importance at this
locus. Our results identify a specific variant that
encodes hybrid glycophorin proteins and is as-
sociated with protection against severe malaria.
This discovery calls for further work to determine
how this particular molecular rearrangement
affects parasite invasion and the red blood cell
response and may lead us toward new para-
site vulnerabilities that can be utilized in future
interventions against this deadly disease.▪

A structural variant creating hybrid glycophorin genes is associated with protection from severe malaria. The reference haplotype carries
three glycophorin genes, two of which (GYPA and GYPB) are expressed as proteins on the red blood cell surface. The malaria-protective haplotype
carries five glycophorin genes, including two hybrid genes that encode the Dantu blood group antigen and are composed of a GYPB extracellular
domain and GYPA intracellular domain. These glycophorins serve as receptors for malaria-parasite ligands during red blood cell invasion.

The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum invades human red blood cells by a series of
interactions between host and parasite surface proteins. By analyzing genome sequence data
from human populations, including 1269 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, we identify a
diverse array of large copy-number variants affecting the host invasion receptor genes GYPA
and GYPB. We find that a nearby association with severe malaria is explained by a complex
structural rearrangement involving the loss of GYPB and gain of two GYPB-A hybrid genes,
which encode a serologically distinct blood group antigen known as Dantu. This variant
reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently increased in frequency in parts
of Kenya, yet it appears to be absent from west Africa. These findings link structural
variation of red blood cell invasion receptors with natural resistance to severe malaria.
M
alaria parasites cause human disease by
invading and replicating inside red blood
cells, which can lead to life-threatening
complications that are a major cause of
childhood mortality in Africa (1, 2). The
invasion of red blood cells is orchestrated by the
specific binding of parasite ligands to erythrocyte
receptors (3), a stage at which genetic variation
could influence the progression of infection. Indeed,
a human genetic variant that prevents erythrocytic
expression of the Duffy antigen, which is essential
for invasion by Plasmodium vivax, is thought to
have undergone a selective sweep resulting in the
present-day absence of P. vivax malaria across
most of sub-Saharan Africa (4). In contrast, the
main cause of malaria in Africa, P. falciparum,
has an expanded family of erythrocyte-binding
ligands that target a different set of human re-
ceptors, most of which do not appear to be
essential for invasion (5–7). Two such invasion
receptors are the glycophorins GYPA and GYPB,
which are abundantly expressed on the eryth-
rocyte surface and underlie the MNS blood group
system (6, 8–10). The antigenic complexity of
this system as well as rates of amino acid sub-
stitution and levels of diversity in African pop-
ulations have led to speculation that this locus
is under evolutionary selection due to malaria
(8, 11–13).
In a recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS), we identified alleles associated with pro-
tection from severe malaria on chromosome 4,
between the gene FRAS1 related extracellular
matrix 3 (FREM3) and the cluster of genes en-
coding GYPE, GYPB, and GYPA (14). Although
the association signal did not extend to these
genes and a functional variant was not identi-
fied, interpretation and further analysis of the
association signal were inhibited by several fac-
tors. First, the GWAS samples were collected at
multiple locations in sub-Saharan Africa, where
levels of human genetic diversity are higher than
in other parts of the world. This diversity re-
mains underrepresented in reference panels of
genetic variation. Second, the glycophorin genes
are in a region of segmental duplication that is
difficult to characterize because of high levels
of paralogy. Notably, the region is known to
harbor structural variation that contributes to
the MNS blood group system but has not been
characterized by next-generation sequencing data
(15, 16). Here we aim to capture additional var-
iation in sub-Saharan African populations, in-
cluding structural variation, to determine the
underlying architecture of the association sig-
nal in this region.
An African-enriched reference panel in
the glycophorin region
We constructed a reference panel with improved
representation of sub-Saharan African popula-
tions from countries where malaria is endemic.
We performed genome sequencing of 765 indi-
viduals from 10 ethnic groups in The Gambia,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, and Tanzania, includ-
ing 207 family trios [100–base pair (bp) paired-
end (PE) reads, mean coverage 10×; tables S1 and
S2]. We focused on a region surrounding the
observed association signal (chr4:140 to 150 Mb,
with respect to the GRCh37 human genome ref-
erence assembly). Genotypes at single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and short indels in the
region were called and computationally phased
(17–19) and combined with phase 3 of the 1000
Genomes Project (20) to obtain a reference panel
of 3269 individuals, including 1269 Africans and
a further 157 individuals with African ancestry
(fig. S1 and tables S1 and S3). We imputed variants
from this panel into the published severe ma-
laria GWAS data set comprising 4579 cases of
severe malaria and 5310 population controls from
The Gambia, Kenya, and Malawi and tested for
association as described previously (14). The sig-
nal of association, formerly identified and repli-
cated at SNPs lying between FREM3 and GYPE,
extends across a region of at least 700 kb and

 includes linked variants within GYPA and GYPB
where association is only apparent with the ad-
ditional African reference data (fig. S2).
Identification of copy-number
variants (CNVs)
We next assessed copy-number variation in the
glycophorin region (defined here as the segmen-
tal duplication within which the three genes lie)
for the sequenced reference panel individuals.
The high level of sequence identity between the
duplicate units presents a challenge for short-
read sequence analysis because of ambiguous
mapping (Fig. 1A) (21). We therefore focused
on changes in read depth at sites of high map-
pability and developed a hidden Markov model
(HMM) to infer the underlying copy-number
state for each individual in 1600-bp windows.
We grouped individuals carrying similar copy-
number paths to define CNVs and assign indi-
vidual CNV genotypes.
Across the 3269 samples, we identified eight
deletions and eight duplications that were found
in two or more unrelated individuals (referred to
below as nonsingleton CNVs) as well as at least
11 singleton variants (Fig. 1B and fig. S3) (22).
For reference, we labeled these variants by copy-
number type (DEL for deletion, DUP for duplica-
tion) and numbered them in order of frequency.
To validate the CNV calls, we analyzed trans-
mission in family trios and observed segrega-
tion as expected, with few exceptions (table S4)
(22). We also compared the CNV calls with the
1000 Genomes Project structural-variant analysis
(23) and found highly consistent copy-number
inference (98.8% of individuals have the same
overall copy-number call) but substantial improve-
ments to individual genotypes in our analysis (fig.
S4) (22). Validation of the breakpoint of the most
common variant (DEL1) by Sanger sequencing
further confirmed the accuracy of our method
(figs. S5 and S6 and table S5) (22).
The variants ranged in length from 3.2 kb (the
minimum possible with our method) to >200 kb
and included deletions and duplications of entire
genes. Loss of GYPB was a common feature, with
five different forms of GYPB deletion among the
nonsingleton CNVs (Fig. 1B). Hybrid gene struc-
tures were another common feature, with two
nonsingleton CNVs predicted to generate GYPB-A
or GYPE-A hybrids (fig. S7). Some variants are
predicted to correspond to known MNS blood
group antigens, whereas others have not pre-
viously been reported (table S6) (22). Of the
nonsingleton CNVs, half (8/16) had a single pair
of breakpoints in homologous parts of the seg-
mental duplication, consistent with formation
through nonallelic homologous recombination
(NAHR; Fig. 1C). Of these, four share a breakpoint
position, which coincides with a double-strand
break (DSB) hotspot active in an individual carrying
a C allele at PRDM9, which encodes a DNA-binding
protein that directs the locations of meiotic DSBs.
(Fig. 1C and fig. S8) (24).
CNVs in the glycophorin region were observed
more frequently in Africa than in other parts of
the world (Fig. 2). In this data set, the combined
allele frequency of glycophorin CNVs in African
populations was 11% compared to 1.1% in non-
African populations, and most of the nonsingleton
CNVs (13/16) were identified in individuals of
African ancestry. Among 14 different ethnic groups
sampled in Africa, the estimated frequency ranged
from 4.7 to 21%, with the highest frequencies in
west African populations.

 Association with severe malaria
We sought to incorporate CNVs into the phased
reference panel with the aim of imputing into
our GWAS data set. Computational phasing of
CNVs is challenging, as published methods do
not model CNV mutational mechanisms or non-
diploid copy number at smaller variants within
CNVs. To work around this, we excluded SNPs
and short indels within the glycophorin region
and relied on the trio structure of sequenced
individuals to resolve haplotype phase between
CNVs and flanking SNPs (18, 25). Haplotype
clustering and cross-validation predict good
imputation performance for the three highest-
frequency CNVs, DEL1, DEL2, and DUP1, as well
as for DUP4 (figs. S9 to S11).
We used this panel to impute CNVs into the
severe malaria GWAS samples (fig. S12) and
tested for association as before. One of the im-
puted CNVs, DUP4, is associated with decreased
risk of severe malaria [odds ratio (OR) = 0.60;
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.72;
Padditive = 9.9 × 10−8; computed under an ad-
ditive model of association by fixed-effect meta-
analysis; Fig. 3A]. Across populations, evidence
for association at DUP4 is among the strongest
of any variant in our data. Moreover, conditioning
on the imputed genotypes at DUP4 in the sta-
tistical association model removes signal at all
other strongly associated variants, including the
previously reported markers of association (e.g.,
conditional Padditive = 0.32 at SNP rs186873296;
Fig. 3B and fig. S13). DUP4 has an estimated
heterozygous relative risk of 0.61 (95% CI 0.50 to
0.75), and its genetic effect appears to be con-
sistent with an additive model, although the low
frequency of homozygotes makes it difficult to
distinguish the extent of dominance (homozy-
gous relative risk 0.31; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.06; n =
24 homozygotes; Fig. 3C). Analysis of different
clinical forms of severe malaria showed that
DUP4 reduced the risk of both cerebral malaria
and severe malarial anemia to a similar degree
(table S7). We noted some evidence of additional
associations in the region, including a possible
protective effect of DEL2 (OR = 0.63; 95% CI =
0.42 to 0.94; Padditive = 0.02), but no evidence of
association with the more common DEL1 or with
GYPB deletion status overall (P > 0.1 using lo-
gistic regression). These results are compatible
with a primary signal of association that is
well explained by an additive effect of DUP4.
DUP4 is imputed with high confidence in both
east African populations included in our GWAS
(Kenya and Malawi; Fig. 3D), where it is at sub-
stantially higher frequency than in the reference
panel (fig. S12). To independently confirm the
imputed DUP4 genotypes, we analyzed SNP mi-
croarray data for intensity patterns indicative of
copy-number variation (Fig. 4) using a Bayesian
clustering model informed by the sequenced DUP4
carriers (fig. S14 and table S8) (22). Classification
of GWAS samples was highly concordant with
the imputed DUP4 genotypes in the east African
populations [squared Pearson correlation co-
efficient (r2) = 0.96 in Kenya; r2 = 0.88 in Malawi;
table S9]. Surprisingly, both imputation and the
microarray intensity analysis suggest that there
may be no copies of DUP4 present among the 4791
Gambian individuals in the GWAS. This large
frequency difference places DUP4 as an outlier
compared with imputed variants at a similar fre-
quency in The Gambia or in Kenya genome-wide
(P = 1.7 × 10−3 and 5 × 10−3, respectively, on the
basis of the empirical distribution of frequencies;
Fig. 5A). DUP4 also varies in frequency within
east Africa (Fig. 5B). Computation of haplotype
homozygosity provides evidence that DUP4 is
carried on an extended haplotype [P = 0.012 for
the integrated haplotype score (iHS) (26, 27) on
the basis of the empirical distribution for variants
of similar frequency genome-wide; Fig. 5, C and
D] that may have increased to its current fre-
quency in Kenya relatively recently. DUP4 is also
absent from all but two of the reference panel
populations (Fig. 2).
The physical structure of DUP4
The copy-number profile of DUP4 is complex,
with a total of six copy-number changes that
cannot have arisen by a single unequal crossover
event from reference-like sequences (Figs. 1B
and 4B). At the gene level, this copy-number pro-
file corresponds to duplication of GYPE, deletion
of the 3′ end of GYPB, duplication of the 5′ end
of GYPB, and triplication of the 3′ end of GYPA.
To begin to understand the functional conse-
quences of DUP4, we sought to reconstruct the
physical arrangement of this variant by pooling
data across the nine carriers in the sequenced
reference panel (eight Wasambaa individuals
from Tanzania, including three parent-child pairs,
and a single African Caribbean individual from
Barbados). First, analysis of coverage along a
multiple sequence alignment of the segmental
duplication corroborated the location of the six
copy-number changes from the HMM, with two
pairs of breakpoints at homologous locations in
the alignment (fig. S15).
Next, we looked for sequenced read pairs
spanning CNV breakpoints, which provide di-
rect evidence of the structure of the underlying
DNA. We identified read pairs that were mapped
near breakpoints but with discordant positions
[mapping quality ≥ 1, absolute insert size >
1000 bp], including longer-read data that we
generated for the 1000 Genomes individual who
carries DUP4 (individual HG02554; 300-bp PE
reads on Illumina MiSeq to 13× coverage). Dis-
cordant read pairs supported the connection be-
tween each pair of homologous breakpoints as
well as between the remaining two breakpoints,
which lie in nonhomologous sequence (Fig. 6A
and fig. S16). On the basis of the combined evi-
dence from copy-number changes, discordant read
pairs, and homology between inferred breakpoints,
we generated a model of the DUP4 chromosome
that contains five glycophorin genes (Fig. 6B).
A prominent functional change on this struc-
ture is the presence of two GYPB-A hybrid genes,
supported by several read pairs within intron 4
of GYPA and GYPB and the copy-number profile.
We confirmed the hybrid sequence by polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR)–based Sanger sequenc-
ing of a 4.1-kb segment spanning the breakpoint
(Fig. 6B, figs. S17 and S18, and table S10) (22).
These data localize the breakpoint to a 184-bp
section of GYPA and GYPB where the two genes
have identical sequence (fig. S19). If translated,
the encoded protein would join the extracellular
domain of GYPB to the transmembrane and in-
tracellular domains of GYPA, creating a peptide
sequence at their junction that is characteristic
of the Dantu antigen in the MNS blood group
system (28, 29). Moreover, like DUP4, the most
common Dantu variant (termed NE type, here
referred to as Dantu NE) is reported to have two
such hybrid genes and lack a full GYPB gene
(30). We sequenced genomic DNA from an in-
dividual serologically determined to be Dantu
positive (Dantu+) and of NE type (150-bp PE
reads on Illumina HiSeq to 18× coverage) and
analyzed it using our HMM. The coverage pro-
file and HMM-inferred copy-number path, in-
distinguishable from those of DUP4 carriers,
confirm identification of DUP4 as the molecular
basis of Dantu NE (Fig. 6, C and D).
In addition to duplicate GYPB-A hybrid genes,
these data reveal the full structure of this Dantu

 variant, including a duplicated copy of GYPE and
the precise location of six breakpoints. Either com-
plex mutational events or a series of at least four
unequal crossover events are needed to account
for the formation of this variant (confirmed by
simulation; fig. S20) (22). However, we find no
potential intermediates and no obvious relation-
ship between DUP4 and other structural-variant
haplotypes in the present data set (fig. S9) (22).
Further analysis of discordant read pairs identifies
a number of shorter discrepancies relative to the
reference sequence that are consistent with gene-
conversion events (fig. S21) and could be func-
tionally relevant (e.g., fig. S22).
Discussion
Here we use whole-genome sequence data to
identify at least 27 CNVs in the glycophorin re-
gion that segregate in global populations. In this
study, 14% of sub-Saharan African individuals
carry a variant that affects the genic copy number
relative to the reference assembly. Our descrip-
tion of these variants complements the existing
literature on antigenic variation associated with
the MNS blood group system and offers addi-
tional insights. For example, the frequency of
GYPB deletion is broadly commensurate with
previous surveys of the S−s−U− blood group
phenotype linked to absence of the GYPB pro-
tein, but the GYPB deletions in our data differ
from the reported molecular variant (fig. S23)
(16, 22, 31–33).
Of the array of glycophorin CNVs identified,
one (DUP4) is associated with resistance to se-
vere malaria and explains the previously reported
signal of association (14). Although there may be
other functional mutations on this haplotype, we
propose that the direct consequences of this re-
arrangement are likely to drive the underlying
causal mechanism for resistance to severe ma-
laria. DUP4 was not present in the 1000 Genomes
phase 1 reference panel [used in (14)] and exists
as a singleton in the 1000 Genomes phase 3
reference panel. Thus, as previously observed at
the sickle-cell locus (34), mapping of the asso-
ciation signal by imputation was only possible
with the inclusion of additional individuals in
the reference panel.
Through additional sequencing, we have shown
that DUP4 corresponds to the variant encoding
the Dantu+ (NE type) blood group phenotype,
thus linking the predicted hybrid genes to a
serologically distinct hybrid protein that is ex-
pressed on the red blood cell (29, 35). The few

 existing studies of Dantu+ (NE type) erythro-
cytes indicate high levels of the hybrid GYPB-A
protein and lower levels of GYPA than wild-
type cells (35, 36). A single study reports par-
asite growth to be impaired in Dantu+ cells (37),
making Dantu NE one of many glycophorin
variants that have been hypothesized to influence
malaria susceptibility or shown to have an ef-
fect in vitro (12, 37–40). Our results regarding a
specific protective effect of DUP4, and the lack
of evidence for other protective CNVs, suggest
that the relevance of these effects in natural
populations may be complicated. We caution
that many of the other CNVs are rare, such that
larger sample sizes and direct typing may be
required to test their effect in vivo.
These findings then raise the question of how
DUP4 protects against malaria. GYPA and GYPB
are exclusively expressed on the erythrocyte sur-
face and are targeted by parasites during inva-
sion (6, 7). P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding
antigen 175 (EBA-175) binds to the extracellular
portion of GYPA (41), which is preserved in DUP4.
P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding ligand-1 (EBL-1)
binds to the extracellular portion of GYPB (42),
which is duplicated in DUP4 but joined to intra-
cellular GYPA. The importance of the extra copy
of GYPE or the absence of full GYPB in DUP4
is uncertain, as GYPE is not known to be ex-
pressed at the protein level (8, 43) and we do not
observe evidence that absence of GYPB alone
confers protection (Fig. 3A). GYPA and GYPB are
known to form homodimers as well as hetero-
dimers in the red blood cell membrane (33), so
these copy-number changes could have com-
plex functional effects. There are physical inter-
actions between GYPA and the anion transport
protein Band 3 (encoded by SLC4A1) at the red
blood cell surface (44), and parasite binding to
GYPA appears to initiate a signal leading to in-
creased membrane rigidity (45). Thus, the GYPB-A
hybrid proteins seen in DUP4 could potentially
affect both receptor-ligand interactions and the
physical properties of the red blood cell membrane.
Previous surveys of the Dantu blood group
antigen have indicated that it is rare (table S11)
(33, 46–48). We find that DUP4 is absent or at
very low frequency outside parts of east Africa,
with a frequency difference and extended haplo-
type consistent with a recent increase in frequen-
cy in Kenya. In contrast, the malaria-protective
variant that causes sickle-cell anemia (SNP rs334
in HBB, the gene encoding b-globin), which is
thought to be under balancing selection, has a
similar frequency in both The Gambia and Kenya
(Fig. 5A). One possibility for why DUP4 is not
more widespread, given its strong protective ef-
fect against malaria, is that it has arisen recently
without time for gene flow to facilitate its dis-
persion. Alternatively, this frequency distribution
could be consistent with balancing selection—for
example, if it protects only against certain strains
of P. falciparum that are specific to east Africa.
The glycophorin region is near a signal of long-
term balancing selection, and measures of poly-
morphism in both the human glycophorins and
P. falciparum EBA-175 have been suggestive of
diversifying selection (11, 12, 49, 50). Although ap-
parently not directly related to these signals, cur-
rent selection on DUP4 may represent a snapshot
of the long-term evolutionary processes acting at
this locus. Mapping the allele frequency of DUP4
across additional populations could help clarify
the nature of selection.
Recent GWASs have confirmed three other loci
associated with severe malaria (HBB, and ABO
and ATP2B4, which encode a glycosyltransferase
and a calcium pump, respectively), all of which
are also related to red blood cell function (14, 51).
However, only the association with GYPA and
GYPB directly involves variation in invasion re-
ceptors. These receptors have been found to be
nonessential in experimental models (7, 9), yet
this result indicates important functional roles in
natural populations. Intriguingly, there is marked
variation among P. falciparum strains in prefer-
ence for different invasion pathways in vitro (7);
field studies that account for parasite heterogene-
ity and tests for genetic interactions may therefore
be important in determining how DUP4 affects
parasite invasion. The discovery that a specific alter-
ation of these invasion receptors confers substantial
protection provides a foundation for experimental
studies on the precise functional mechanism and
may lead us toward the identification of new par-
asite vulnerabilities that can be utilized in future
interventions against this deadly disease.

 and tables S1 and S2). Individuals were from the
general population, with most recruited as fam-
ily trios except in Burkina Faso, where individuals
are unrelated. Genomic DNA was extracted and
sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq
2000 at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute with
100-bp paired-end reads to an average of 10× cov-
erage. Reads were mapped to the GRCh37 human
reference genome with additional sequences as
modified by the 1000 Genomes Project [hs37d5.fa;
(20)], by BWA (52) with base quality score recal-
ibration (BQSR) and local realignment around
known indels as implemented in GATK (53, 54).
Sequence data curation
We used GATK HaplotypeCaller to compute an
initial set of genotype likelihoods across samples
at a genome-wide set of variants, including poly-
morphic sites from 1000 Genomes phase 3 (55).
We computed average coverage across the genome
for each individual using BEDTools genomecov
(56) and excluded seven Bantu individuals from
Cameroon with less than 2× coverage across
the genome and one Wollof individual from The
Gambia with less than 6× coverage and greater
than 10% missing call rate in the GATK analysis.
All further analyses described here are based on
the 765 nonexcluded individuals.
We inferred the sex of sequenced samples
from the ratio of X chromosome coverage to
autosomal coverage. To infer family relation-
ships, we used lcMLkin (57) to compute maximum-
likelihood pairwise-kinship estimates from the
GATK-estimated genotype likelihoods at a thinned
set of ~26,000 SNPs genome-wide. We then ran
PRIMUS (58) to infer pedigrees from the kinship
estimates and compared the inferred and reported
relationships. On the basis of this, we manually
curated the family structure of sequenced samples
by removing relationships incompatible with trio
structure (IBD1 < 0.9 for parent-child relation-
ship), swapping three individuals between trios
with clear sample mix ups, and exchanging pa-
rental labels in two trios to be consistent with
the genetic sex of the parents. The curated data set
contains 207 trios, 16 duos, and 115 individuals
without nominal close relationships. All trios and
duos are unrelated to each other except for one
extended family in the Wollof from The Gambia,
which consists of a quad (two parents and two
children, here encoded as two trios), where one
of the children is a parent in an additional trio.
1000 Genomes sequence data
The 2504 individuals from 26 populations in the
1000 Genomes phase 3 release (20) were analyzed.
Bam files containing reads mapped to GRCh37
were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes FTP
site (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/;
fig. S1B and table S3).
Overview of the glycophorin region
The glycophorin gene cluster on chromosome 4
results from segmental duplication events in the
ancestor to African great apes (59) and is not
related in sequence to GYPC on chromosome 2.
By aligning segments of the reference sequence
against one another, we identified the region
of segmental duplication, here referred to as
the glycophorin region, as chr4:144,706,830 to
145,069,066 bp and the three paralogous units
of the segmental duplication as GYPE unit,
chr4:144,706,830 to 144,837,481 bp; GYPB unit,
chr4:144,837,482 to 144,947,716 bp; and GYPA
unit, chr4:144,947,717 to 145,069,066 bp. Each
gene occupies ~30 kb toward the end of its
~120-kb repeat unit. We generated a multiple
sequence alignment of the reference sequence
for the three units by running kalign (60) with
default parameters and calculated pairwise iden-
tity in 1600-bp windows along this alignment
(Fig. 1A). The glycophorin genes are transcribed
on the negative strand, and we adopt the con-
vention of numbering exons and introns as

Construction of a regional
reference panel
Identification of polymorphic sites and
genotype-likelihood computation
To construct a regional reference panel, we fo-
cused on the 10-Mb region chr4:140 to 150 Mb,
including a 500-kb margin at either end. We
first assembled a list of previously identified SNPs
and short indels from the 1000 Genomes phase 3
(20), the Illumina Omni 2.5M array, the ExAC
project (61), and the European Variation Archive
(downloaded on 24 February 2016; www.ebi.ac.
uk/eva/), totaling 421,670 variants. We then used
freebayes v1.0.2 (19) to calculate genotype like-
lihoods at these sites, as well as at newly iden-
tified putatively polymorphic sites, across the
3269 sequenced individuals. Freebayes was run
in 10-kb chunks across the region. We filtered
freebayes output to include all previously iden-
tified variants and high quality novel variants,
i.e., novel variants with quality (QUAL) > 1, pres-
ence of supporting reads on both strands (SAF >
0 and SAR > 0) and both sides of the variant
(RPL > 1 and RPR > 1), and high quality per al-
ternate observation (QUAL/AO > 10). In total,
the filtered output contained 424,909 variants,
of which 412,795 were among the previously iden-
tified variants.
Genotype calling and phasing
We next aimed to generate a high-quality set of
genotype calls in the 765 individuals collected
by MalariaGEN partners. We focused on sites
with combined mean coverage between 7.5× and
13.5×, excluding ~4% and ~1% of variants with
depth below or above this range, respectively,
and restricted to variants with allele count of at
least 2, leaving a total of 117,531 variants. We
produced an initial set of genotype calls at these
variants using BEAGLE 4.0 [beagle.r1399; (17)]
without specifying family information. On the
basis of the initial calls, we removed variants
with more than five Mendelian errors in the 207
trios, strong evidence for deviation from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (PHWE < 1 × 10−3 in the
542 individuals without parents in the data set)
or more than one alternate allele. We then reran
BEAGLE on the remaining set of 111,167 variants,
including family information, to produce geno-
type calls. We phased these genotypes using
SHAPEIT2, specifying 400 selected and 200 ran-
dom conditioning states, an effective popula-
tion size of 17,469, and 10 burn-in, 8 pruning, and
50 main iterations, and including trio information.
Finally, to form a joint reference panel across
all individuals, we merged the phased haplotypes
with the 1000 Genomes phase 3 haplotypes (20)
at the overlapping set of variants. The merged
reference panel, which contains 96,676 variants
in the region chr4:139.5 to 150.5 Mb, is available
for use in other studies (see www.malariagen.
net/resource/23).
Imputation and association testing at
SNPs and short indels
Imputation and association testing
We used both the 1000 Genomes phase 3 refer-
ence panel (20) and the merged reference panel
described above to impute genotypes into the
previously published sets of severe malaria cases
and population controls from The Gambia, Kenya,
and Malawi (14). In brief, we ran IMPUTE2
(62, 63) in 2-Mb chunks using Illumina Omni
2.5M genotype calls, as previously described. A
total of 5621 (The Gambia), 5203 (Malawi), and
5583 (Kenya) genotyped variants were included
in the 11-Mb region considered. We specified
1000 copying states (–k_hap 1000), an effective
population size of 20,000 (–Ne 20,000), as re-
commended for African populations, and a buffer
region of 500 kb. We removed reference panel
individuals with parents in the panel before
imputation.
We tested for association in each population
under additive, dominant, recessive, and hetero-
zygote models using a logistic regression model
as implemented in the program SNPTEST, in-
cluding five principal components to account for
population structure. We restricted analysis here
to severe malaria cases with nonzero parasitemia,
as measured by blood slide at the time of ad-
mission, as this is likely to be the most accurate
phenotype. For downstream meta-analysis, we
omitted results for variants at low frequency
[minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.5%] or with
low imputation quality (IMPUTE info < 0.75) in
each population.
We used fixed-effect meta-analysis to compute
an estimate of the odds ratio across populations,
along with a standard error and P value, for each
model. For the additive model, we refer to the
resulting P value as Padditive. Additionally, we
computed a model-averaged Bayes factor (BFavg)
reflecting the overall evidence for association as
previously described (14). Meta-analysis results
under the two imputation reference panels, as well
as for the previously published 1000 Genomes
phase 1 reference panel imputation, are shown
in fig. S2.
Functional annotation of variants
We used Variant Effect Predictor [VEP; (64)] to
annotate the functional consequences of all var-
iants with evidence of association (BFavg > 1).
We noted one variant with VEP IMPACT rating
“moderate” with some evidence of association
(rs147343123; nonsynonymous in exon 1 of GYPA,
predicted deleterious; association test BFavg =
17.34, Padditive = 1.4 × 10−3 for 1000 Genomes im-
putation; BFavg = 121.3, Padditive = 1.5 × 10−4 for
full panel imputation) (fig. S2). We also noted that
the nonsynonymous variant in FREM3 exon 1
previously found to have evidence of associa-
tion [rs181620317; see (14)] is imputed at much
lower frequency with both the 1000 Genomes
phase 3 panel and the full reference panel (e.g.,
frequency = 0.2% in Kenya with the full reference
panel), and shows no evidence for association
using genotypes imputed from these panels.
Identification of copy-number variation
Method to call copy-number variation
To identify large CNVs across the glycophorin
region, we implemented a hidden Markov model
(HMM) to infer the underlying copy-number
state from the observed read counts. The input
to the HMM is read depth, averaged over sites in
windows of fixed length (here, 1600 bp) for each
individual. To reduce the problems with mapping
in the region, we included only (i) reads with at
least a mapping quality (MQ) of 20; (ii) mappable
sites, defined as sites with mappability > 0.9,
where mappability of a site is the mean value
of the CRG mappability track for all 100-mers
overlapping that site (21); and (iii) windows with
≥25% of sites fulfilling this criterion—windows
with fewer mappable sites were considered
uninformative.
We modeled the mean depth of coverage for
individual i at window j, di,j, as normally dis-
tributed with mean and variance dependent
on the assumed underlying copy number k (k =
2 is the normal diploid state):
di;j ∼ Norm k
2 wjmi;
k
2 si
�
�2
 
!
k∈f0; 1; 2; 3; 4g
For copy number k = 0 (homozygous deletion),
we used a truncated normal distribution (trun-
cated at 0) and assigned a variance of 0.04 to
allow for spurious mapping. To account for sys-
tematic variation in coverage along the genome,
we estimated a window-specific factor (wj) pro-
portional to how much individuals with no copy-
number variation (k = 2) are greater than or less
than their mean in that window. These define
the emission probabilities for the HMM. We used
a fixed transition matrix that assumes a low rate
of switching with ~0.999 probability of remain-
ing in the current copy-number state; 1 × 10−4
probability for leaving the diploid state; 0.001
probability of returning to diploid (k = 2) from
a nondiploid state; and 1 × 10−5 probability of
switching among nondiploid states.
We estimated mi, si, and wj by starting with
an initial guess, assuming everyone to be diploid
across the region, and then running the Viterbi
algorithm separately for each individual. We
then recalculated mi and si for each individual,
only including windows in which the copy num-
ber is inferred to be 2, and wj for each window,
only including individuals in which the copy
number is inferred to be 2. We iterated this al-
gorithm until no further changes in the inferred
underlying copy-number paths were observed
for any individuals.

Downloaded from 
 data in an 850-kb region including the glycophorin
genes (chr4:144.35 to 145.20 Mb). After inferring
the copy-number state paths for each individ-
ual, we then considered variants to be the same
across individuals if the direction of copy-number
change was the same and both end points were
within three bins of each other. Heterozygous
triplications and homozygous duplications were
differentiated by looking across individuals; var-
iants that were always found in copy-number state
4 were attributed as triplications. We excluded
copy-number variable segments that covered
only a single bin or were outside the segmental
duplication. We then considered copy-number
variable segments that were always found to-
gether to be a single CNV and manually refined
the few other copy-number variable segments
that were not found separately from other CNVs
(22). This process identified 16 nonsingleton
variants and 28 singleton variants (Fig. 1B and
fig. S3), although we note several caveats about
the singleton CNVs, including some that likely
correspond to more common variants (22).
To validate the CNVs and genotype calls, we
assessed inheritance in the MalariaGEN trios
and compared genotype calls for the 1000 Ge-
nomes individuals with those released in the
1000 Genomes phase 3 paper on structural var-
iants (table S4 and fig. S4) (22, 23). We also de-
signed PCR primers on either side of the DEL1
variant and generated Sanger sequence that
confirmed and localized this breakpoint (figs. S5
and S6 and table S5) (22).
Phasing and imputation of CNVs
Initial phasing of CNVs
We investigated whether CNVs could be accu-
rately phased relative to surrounding SNP var-
iation in the regional reference. Collectively,
nonsingleton CNVs in our data set cover a to-
tal of 350 kb (Fig. 1B), which extends over most
of the region of segmental duplication sur-
rounding the glycophorin genes. In principle,
inference of CNV haplotype phase might be-
nefit from copy number–aware genotype calls
at smaller variants within CNVs. However, im-
plementing this is challenging, as the state-of-
the-art phasing methods assume samples are
diploid. A further possible issue is that read map-
ping, and hence the quality of SNP genotype
calls, is likely to be impaired in such regions of
segmental duplication.
Motivated by these observations, we took the
following approach to phasing CNVs, which
leverages the family trio structure of sequenced
individuals to infer accurate phase, using both
SHAPEIT2 (18) and MVNCALL (25). First, we fo-
cused on the 765 sequenced individuals collected
by MalariaGEN partners. We removed variants
within the region of segmental duplication (here
taken as chr4:144.7 to 145.07 Mb) from the ref-
erence panel and replaced these with CNV geno-
type calls to form a single file with genotypes
at the CNVs and flanking SNPs and indels.
SHAPEIT2 requires each variant to be assigned
a single genomic position. For each CNV longer
than 10 kb, we included the genotypes for that
variant at the start-, mid-, and endpoints of the
CNV; for variants less than 10 kb, we used the
midpoint. We then ran SHAPEIT2 with param-
eters as for SNP and indel phasing to produce
phased genotype calls, treating each CNV as a
separate, biallelic variant. Next, to phase CNVs
into the 1000 Genomes Project individuals, we
extracted the Omni 2.5M sites with allele fre-
quency >1% from the 1000 Genomes Project
phased haplotypes and removed the region of
segmental duplication. We used MVNCALL to
phase each nonsingleton CNV into this scaffold,
again placing each CNV greater than 10 kb in
length at its start-, mid-, and end positions.
We assessed accuracy of phasing by considering
patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between
CNVs and variants in the left- and right-flanking
regions (figs. S9 and S10). We noted high LD
between some CNVs and variants to the left of
the region, including for DEL1, DEL2, DUP1, and
DUP4. LD estimated from phased haplotypes
captured most of the correlation between geno-
types across the region, as expected in an outbred
population if haplotype phase is accurate. The
small deviations observed may be due to the pres-
ence of a small number of switch errors, or po-
tentially to population substructure.
Haplotype-based curation and rephasing
of CNVs
Some singleton CNVs have similar copy-number
profiles to more common CNVs in the HMM-
based calls (22), and after phasing, we observed
that haplotypes carrying several of these clus-
tered with the corresponding common variant
(DEL9 with DEL1; DEL11, DEL12, and DEL14
with DEL2; DUP15 and DUP18 with DUP1). We
reasoned that these are likely to represent the
same variant, with differences in calling poten-
tially due to noise in coverage profiles or varia-
tion in the other chromosome. We merged these
singletons with the corresponding nonsingleton
CNV and repeated the procedure described above,
using SHAPEIT2 and MVNCALL to rephase CNVs
and flanking short variants and then merging
the two reference panels. We also noted that
haplotypes carrying DEL4 cluster with DUP1,
which shares a similar breakpoint (Fig. 1, B
and C). A plausible explanation for this is that
DUP1 arose by NAHR on a DEL4 background
(fig. S24) (22).
For subsequent imputation steps, we restricted
the combined panel to the set of haplotypes from
unrelated individuals (i.e., removing the children
of family trios and duos). Three individuals in
the 1000 Genomes data carry CNVs that are not
singletons in the overall data set but are private
to that individual in the 1000 Genomes data
(HG01986, carrying DEL4; HG02554, carrying
DUP4; and HG02585, carrying DUP5). Of these,
we noted in particular that HG02554 appears
to have a switch error in the 1000 Genomes (ex-
plaining clustering of opposite haplotypes with
other DUP4 haplotypes on either side of the re-
gion; fig. S9). Because our approach phases var-
iants in the 1000 Genomes separately and these
are singletons in that data set, we also excluded
these three individuals from the panel used for
imputation.
Cross-validation of CNV imputation in the
reference panel
To evaluate how well CNVs are likely to be
imputed in our GWAS data set, we performed
a cross-validation experiment using the African–
reference panel individuals as follows. For each
individual, we removed the individual and his or
her family members (if present) from the phased
reference panel haplotypes to form a subsetted
panel. We also extracted genotype calls for that
individual at variants on the Illumina Omni 2.5M
array from the reference panel genotypes, exclud-
ing variants within the glycophorin region. We
used these genotypes and the subsetted panel to
re-impute CNVs for that individual.
We evaluated CNV re-imputation by computing
the correlation between HMM-based genotype
calls and genotype dosages from the re-imputation
(fig. S11) and by direct comparison of HMM and
re-imputed calls. DEL4 carriers were imputed with
some confidence as carrying DUP1, consistent
with the shared haplotype for these variants
and the higher frequency of DUP1. Given the
functionally distinct nature of these variants,
this affects interpretation of imputed DUP1
genotypes.
Among CNVs >10 kb in length, we noted little
variation between the three imputation locations
(leftmost breakpoint, midpoint, and rightmost
breakpoint of the CNV), except for DUP4, where
the right endpoint had slightly higher imputa-
tion performance (fig. S11). For all analyses pre-
sented in this paper, we refer to the midpoint
imputation of each CNV.
Imputation of CNVs
We used the combined panel to impute CNVs into
the three GWAS data sets. Imputation settings
were as described above. To ensure imputation
was based on flanking SNPs, we removed SNPs
within the glycophorin region from the genotype
data before imputation. We evaluated imputa-
tion performance in the GWAS data by compar-
ing the overall expected allele frequency against
the IMPUTE info metric and another metric of
confidence in imputed CNV call probabilities,
the proportion of expected frequency of CNV
heterozygote or homozygote that is due to geno-
types with at least 90% probability (Fig. 3D and
fig. S12, A and B). We also compared the expected
frequency in control samples with the frequency
in the geographically nearest reference panel pop-
ulation (fig. S12C).
Analysis of association at CNVs
Association with severe malaria
We tested for association with each CNV in each
population using logistic regression including
five principal components as covariates and
computed both fixed-effect and Bayesian meta-
analyses as described above for SNPs and indels.
To directly estimate the effect of heterozygote and
homozygote genotypes, we modified SNPTEST
to fit the logistic regression model with a separate

 parameter for heterozygote and homozygote geno-
types in a missing data–likelihood framework that
integrates over imputation uncertainty. To as-
sess evidence for association after accounting
for DUP4, we used QCTOOL v2 (http://www.well.
ox.ac.uk/~gav/qctool_v2/) to extract the additive
and heterozygote imputed dosages of DUP4
for each individual and repeated the association
test and meta-analysis at SNPs, indels, and CNVs
conditional on these dosages (Fig. 3B and
fig. S13).
Association with clinical subtypes
Severe malaria–affected children in our data are
recorded as either having cerebral malaria (CM),
severe malarial anemia (SMA), or other nonspecific
severe-malaria phenotype (OTHER). To assess the
association of DUP4 with these subphenotypes,
we fit a multinomial logistic regression model with
these outcome levels using population controls
as a baseline (table S7). A small number of in-
dividuals are annotated as both CM and SMA
and were excluded from this analysis.
Association with gene content
To test for association with overall copy number
of each glycophorin gene, we used the imputed
genotype probabilities and the copy-number pro-
file of nonsingleton CNVs (Fig. 1B) to compute
the expected number of copies of each gene in
each GWAS sample. Because overlap of some
CNVs with genes is partial, we measured copy
number separately at the transcription start and
end sites. We also computed the expected num-
ber of hybrid genes as formed by DUP2, DUP4,
and DUP8. We tested for association with each
copy-number measure by fitting a logistic regres-
sion model across the three populations, including
the genic dosage and five principal components in
each population. Overall genic copy number was
significantly associated with severe malaria status
(e.g., P = 3 × 10−7 for dosage at transcription start
sites), as was the expected number of hybrid
genes. However, these effects were well explained
by the effect of DUP4 (P > 0.14 after conditioning
on the expected dosage of DUP4). Several of these
predictors are strongly correlated with DUP4
dosage; this analysis could not distinguish between
an effect of DUP4 and that of copy number of
GYPE, copy number of the GYPA transcription
end site, or the total copy number of hybrid genes
(P > 0.13 for either effect in a joint model).
We also specifically tested whether the num-
ber of deleted copies of GYPB, or the presence of
one or two deleted copies, was associated with
severe malaria status but saw no evidence of as-
sociation (P > 0.48).
Population genetic analysis
Frequency differentiation
We used estimated MAFs at both typed and im-
puted variants from (14) for the 2490 population
controls from The Gambia and 1498 population
controls from Kenya to investigate the extent to
which the observed frequency difference of DUP4
is extreme relative to other variants genome-wide.
For this comparison, we included all autosomal
variants having IMPUTE info > 0.75 and esti-
mated frequency ≥ 0.5% in at least one of the
populations (14,973,426 variants in total). We
binned variants into 0.5% MAF bins and noted
the frequency estimates for DUP4 ( fKenya = 0.0895
and fGambia = 0.0003) and, for comparison, the
sickle cell anemia–causing allele [rs334:T; MAF =
0.0853 in Kenya and 0.0766 in The Gambia es-
timated from direct typing of this SNP in these
samples (65)].
To quantify the extent to which DUP4 is an
outlier, we computed two empirical P values
based on the marginal distributions. Specifically,
we computed PGambia|Kenya as the proportion of
variants with MAF less than or equal to fGambia in
The Gambia, among all variants with MAF within
1% of fKenya in Kenya (empirical PGambia|Kenya <
1.2 × 10−6; 0 of 831,956 variants in this bin). Sim-
ilarly, we computed PKenya|Gambia as the propor-
tion of variants with MAF equal to or greater
than fKenya in Kenya, among all variants with
MAF within 1% of fGambia in The Gambia (empir-
ical PKenya|Gambia = 1.7 × 10−3; 2851 of 1,710,922
variants in this bin).
The computation of PGambia|Kenya is sensitive
to the frequency of DUP4 in The Gambia, which
may be underestimated because of poor imputa-
tion performance. To account for this, we recom-
puted PGambia|Kenya assuming 1% frequency in
The Gambia (adjusted empirical PGambia|Kenya =
5 × 10−3) and refer to this value in the main text.
Haplotype homozygosity
To assess haplotype homozygosity, we first used
SHAPEIT2 to phase imputed CNV genotypes
onto haplotypes defined by directly typed SNPs
in the region chr4:139.5 to 150.5 Mb, excluding
SNPs in the glycophorin region. We specified
400 selected and 200 random copying states
(–states 400, –states-random 200), an effective
population size of 17,469 as recommended for
African populations, and included reference
panel haplotypes to inform phasing. EHH (27)
was then computed around DUP4 by using the
rehh R package. We used a custom script to
compute an unstandardized integrated haplo-
type score (uiHS) (26), using recombination rate
estimates from the HapMap combined recombi-
nation map (66).
To generate a distribution of uiHS at SNPs with
a similar frequency to DUP4, we computed uiHS
at those genotyped SNPs (14) where the human
ancestral allele could be inferred using the six
primate EPO alignments (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.
ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/
ancestral_alignments/) and the derived allele fre-
quency was in the 2% frequency bin centered
around fKenya (0.0795 to 0.0995). We computed
an empirical P value as the proportion of SNPs
with uiHS less than or equal to that observed at
DUP4 (P = 0.0119; 996 of the 83,419 variants in
this bin). The exclusion of the glycophorin region
from the estimate at DUP4 is likely to be conserv-
ative, because, in effect, it adds a constant term
equal to the recombination length of the removed
interval [~0.15 centimorgan (cM)] to both the
numerator and denominator of the statistic.
Resolution of the structure of DUP4
Discordant read pair analysis
We began by remapping reads from each of the
nine heterozygous DUP4 carriers genome-wide
using bwa mem, which has better performance
for longer reads (67). Because even longer reads
should facilitate more confident mapping around
the breakpoints, we also obtained DNA from
Coriell for HG02554, the 1000 Genomes sample
carrying DUP4, and generated 300-bp PE sequence
data on Illumina MiSeq at the High Throughput
Genomics core at the Wellcome Trust Centre for
Human Genetics at the University of Oxford.
We mapped these reads to the same GRCh37
human reference (hs37d5.fa) with bwa mem,
yielding 13× genomic coverage. For all remap-
ped bam files, we marked duplicates with Picard
MarkDuplicates and excluded duplicate reads
from further analysis.
We then used samtools to pull out read pairs
where both reads had a primary alignment to the
glycophorin region with MQ ≥ 1 and an absolute
insert size ≥ 1 kb. For the 300-bp data, we allowed
one of the reads in the pair to be mapped to the
glycophorin region with MQ = 0. Across samples,
there were 434 such read pairs. We grouped read
pairs where both ends were mapped within 1 kb
of each other and identified those near the HMM-
inferred breakpoints.
To view how closely the discordant read pairs
matched each of the three possible homologous
positions in the segmental duplication, we used
the mapped position and the cigar string to place
each read into the multiple sequence alignment
and then identified positions in the read with a
match or mismatch to each of the three aligned
reference sequences using custom scripts in R
(e.g., fig. S16).
Molecular assays and Sanger sequencing
Briefly, a 4.1-kb fragment spanning the GYPB-A
hybrid breakpoint (located between exons 4 and
5) was amplified by PCR with primers designed
against GYPB and GYPA sequences (fig. S17 and
table S10). In practice, it is difficult to design spe-
cific primers because of the high homology, and we
found that the assay amplifies both GYPA and
GYPB-A hybrid sequences. To separate these,
we identified a restriction enzyme site [Blp I
(5′…GC/TNAGC…3′)] that cleaves the GYPA se-
quence, but not that of the hybrid. PCR products
were digested and then separated on an agarose
gel. We excised the 4.1-kb band and obtained
Sanger sequence of the region around the puta-
tive breakpoint (figs. S18 and S19). A full descrip-
tion of the design and protocols is given in (22).
Sequencing and copy-number analysis of a
serologically-typed Dantu+ individual
We obtained DNA from the International Blood
Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol, UK, from
an archived reference sample that had been se-
rologically typed as Dantu+ (NE type). This sam-
ple was collected in 1992, and the individual was
originally from Natal, South Africa. The DNA was
sequenced with 150-bp PE reads on Illumina HiSeq
4000 by the High Throughput Genomics core at

to the same GRCh37 human reference genome
(hs37d5.fa) with bwa mem, yielding 18× coverage.
To generate CNV calls, we ran our HMM method
on this individual alone, without using the window-
specific factors.
Simulations of DUP4 formation
To determine possible routes to formation of
DUP4, we implemented a computer program
in C++ to iteratively generate structural rear-
rangements by unequal crossing over, allowing
breakpoints to occur at any of the six locations
observed for DUP4 with no constraint based on
homology. In brief, we encoded the reference
haplotype as a string of seven segments delineated
by the coverage breakpoints (i.e., as the string
0123456; Fig. 6A). We ran the program through
three generations of events, where the first gen-
eration produced all possible events between two
reference haplotypes and the second and third
generations allowed unequal crossing over be-
tween any two haplotypes from previous gener-
ations. This brute-force search allows us to place
a lower limit of four on the number of events
required to form DUP4. For additional details on
the program and search, see (22).
