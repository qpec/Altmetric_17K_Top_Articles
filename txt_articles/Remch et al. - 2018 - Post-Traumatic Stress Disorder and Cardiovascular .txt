BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) is a risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, 
beyond the expected effects from recognized cardiovascular risk factors 
and depression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: World Trade Center–Heart is an observational 
prospective cohort study of 6481 blue-collar first responders nested 
within the World Trade Center Health Program in New York City. 
Baseline measures in 2012 and 2013 included blood pressure, weight 
and height, and blood lipids. PTSD, depression, smoking, and dust 
exposure during the 2001 cleanup were self-reported. During the 
4-year follow-up, outcomes were assessed through (1) interview-based 
incident, nonfatal MI, and stroke, validated in medical charts (n=118); 
and (2) hospitalizations for MI and stroke for New York city and state 
residents (n=180). Prevalence of PTSD was 19.9% in men and 25.9% in 
women, that is, at least twice that of the general population. Cumulative 
incidence of MI or stroke was consistently larger for men or women with 
PTSD across follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 2.22 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.30–3.82) for MI and 2.51 (95% CI, 1.39–4.57) 
for stroke. For pooled MI and stroke, adjusted HRs were 2.35 (95% CI, 
1.57–3.52) in all and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.01–3.49) in men free of depression. 
Using hospitalization registry data, adjusted HRs were 2.17 (95% CI, 
1.41–3.32) for MI; 3.01 (95% CI, 1.84–4.93) for stroke; and for pooled 
MI and stroke, the adjusted HR was 2.40 (95% CI, 1.73–3.34) in all, HR 
was 2.44 (95% CI, 1.05–5.55) in women, and adjusted HR was 2.27 
(95% CI, 1.41–3.67) in men free of depression. World Trade Center dust 
exposure had no effect.
CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study confirms that PTSD is a risk factor for 
MI and stroke of similar magnitude in men and women, independent of 
depression.

T
his is the first report from World Trade Center 
(WTC)-Heart—a cohort study specifically designed 
to assess the association between early response 
to the WTC September 11 attack and cardiovascular 
outcomes. WTC-Heart comprises blue-collar workers 
who were involved in the cleaning of the debris of the 
WTC complex during the months immediately after the 
attack. The cohort offers the ability to assess whether 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is involved in car-
diovascular disease (CVD) incidence because of 3 cohort 
characteristics: (1) it underwent the same, extraordinary 
traumatic event at a discrete point in time and suffers 
from an excess burden of PTSD symptoms at least twice 
that of the general population1,2; (2) being nested within 
a long-term program offering free care to first respond-
ers, can explore long-term risk 11 to 15 years after the 
event; and (3) because first responders were on average 
in their forties in 2001, it is a relatively young cohort in 
which CVDs would be expected to be rare if it was not 
because of this unique exposure to the psychologically 
and environmentally traumatic event in 2001.
PTSD—a syndrome characterized by re-experiencing 
the traumatic exposure, avoidance of reminders, hyper-
arousal, and negative mood and cognitions, highly prev-
alent among WTC responders3—has been consistently 
shown to be an independent risk factor for incident 
myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in cohort studies.4–10 
Previous reports from a different WTC cohort have relat-
ed psychological stress to heart diseases among people 
who worked at or were living in the vicinity of Ground 
Zero in 2001 to 2002.11,12 However, despite the wealth 
of evidence, PTSD is still not recognized as a risk factor 
for CVD because available studies are all affected by 1 
or several limitations, such as self-report of established 
CVD risk factors (eg, lipids, blood pressure, weight, and 
height), self-reported CVD events, exclusively male or 
female cohorts, or nonadjustment for depression. In 
contrast, in WTC-Heart, CVD risk factors were mea-
sured in a standardized fashion, and incident cases of 
MI and stroke were assessed using an active follow-up, 
including personal interviews and validation of events 
in medical charts simultaneously in men and women.
METHODS
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be 
automatically made available to other researchers for pur-
poses of reproducing the results or replicating the proce-
dure. The cohort is nested within the WTC Health Program 
(WTCHP), and authorization will have to be obtained from 
the WTCHP too.
WTC-Heart is a prospective, fixed cohort of 6481 WTC 
first responders involved in cleaning up the debris of the WTC 
complex in New York City in 2001 and 2002 and recruited 
within the WTCHP
. Active follow-up for incident and recur-
rent CVD was conducted from January 2012 until June 2016, 
remotely via e-mail, mail, and phone interviews in English, 
Spanish, and Polish. The cohort was also linked with the New 
York state hospitalization database, SPARCS.
The cohort was recruited from 2 WTCHP sites (ie, the Icahn 
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or North Shore Long Island 
Jewish Hospital) in New York City. The WTCHP
, established 
in 2002, comprises nonfirefighter workers and volunteers 
engaged in rescue, recovery, restoration of services, cleanup, 
or other support work on or after September 11. These first 
responders were eligible in the WTCHP if they had worked 
for ≥4 hours on September 11 to 14, 2001, ≥24 hours dur-
ing the month of September 2001, or ≥80 hours total during 
the period of October through December 2001.13 Also eligible 
were employees of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 
who processed human remains, of the Port Authority Trans-
Hudson Corporation who participated in the cleanup efforts 
for ≥24 hours from February to July 2002, and workers who 
drove, repaired, cleaned, or maintained vehicles that handled 
WTC debris for at least 1 day between September 11, 2001, 
and July 31, 2002.14
Sample
The cohort is a consecutive sample of 6481 women and men 
attending one of their annual clinical visits, up to their 10th 
annual visit, at the WTCHP between January 2012 and June 
2013 (baseline). Annual visits are not necessarily associated with 
medical problems requiring care. Informed consent was pro-
vided on the day of recruitment, in English, Spanish, and Polish. 
The Queens College Institutional Review Board and those of the 
2 recruitment sites approved the WTC-Heart protocol.
Exposures
Recognized cardiovascular risk factors comprised: (1) stan-
dardized 2 measurements of blood pressure to the third digit 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Post-traumatic stress disorder has been consis-
tently shown to be an independent risk factor for 
incident myocardial infarction or stroke in cohort 
studies.
• However, despite the wealth of evidence, post-
traumatic stress disorder is still not recognized as 
a risk factor for cardiovascular disease because 
available studies are all affected by 1 or several 
limitations.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• World Trade Center–Heart offers unique and 
strong evidence that World Trade Center attack–
related post-traumatic stress disorder is a risk fac-
tor for myocardial infarction and stroke, in men 
and women, and independent of recognized car-
diovascular risk factors and depression.
• Because of its methodological strength (ie, active 
follow-up, medical chart validation, and adjust-
ment for depression), this study validates previous 
reports of exclusively male or female cohorts.

(eg, 12.2) after sitting down; (2) a comprehensive smok-
ing history; (3) body weight and height measured in lightly 
dressed subjects; and (4) blood lipids: total cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. Clinical personnel were 
trained specifically for this study and provided identical, new 
instruments (scales, sphygmomanometers). Baseline mental 
health symptoms included the PTSD checklist PCL-C (civilian) 
for DSM-IV,15 with a specific preamble relating the answers to 
the participation in the WTC cleanup. The cutoff for probable 
PTSD was ≥44 points as recommended given the prevalence 
of PTSD in the cohort.16 Possible depression was defined as a 
score of ≥10 (in a range of 0–27) on the 9 questions of the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9.17
In a detailed questionnaire, each participant indicated: (1) 
which day on or after September 11 they began working on 
the WTC complex; (2) whether they were directly in the cloud 
of dust (or blackout) from the collapse of the WTC buildings 
or not; (3) whether their work was adjacent or on the pile 
or pit, terms that referred to the former location of the twin 
towers of the WTC complex; and (4) whether they wore a 
protective mask.18
Active Follow-Up
Attempts were made to contact every participant once a 
year from the 2012 baseline to June 2016. At each annual 
contact, incident cardiac and incident neurological events 
were reported in a standardized, self-administered survey 
in English, Spanish, and Polish either online, by mail, or by 
telephone. In case of death reported by a relative or by the 
WTCHP
, a questionnaire and request of death certificate was 
mailed to either relatives or healthcare provider.
Outcomes
All self-reported CV events on the follow-up forms, includ-
ing positive report of cardiac symptoms, MI, neurological 
symptoms, or stroke, were tentatively confirmed by specific 
additional personal interviews conducted by phone by trained 
interviewers in English, Spanish, or Polish. Determination of 
incident and recurrent cardiovascular outcomes in medical 
charts was performed by a blinded adjudicating panel com-
prising the principal investigator (A.M.) and a senior research 
worker (C.M.-M.) with 24 years of experience adjudicating 
acute MI and stroke in several large population-based studies. 
An MI was confirmed in the presence of typical symptoms, 
EKG signs, troponin, and enzymatic movement. A stroke or 
a transient ischemic attack was confirmed in the presence of 
typical symptoms and medical imaging or sonographic signs.
From January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016, (the 
latest year available) all WTC-Heart participants were elec-
tronically linked to New York State Department of Health 
SPARCS program, which includes diagnoses and dates for all 
patients discharged from acute care hospitals, excluding psy-
chiatric and federal hospitals. The coding of discharge diag-
noses may not be accurate, but the degree of inaccuracy is 
likely to be homogeneous across the cohort. Matched records 
had identical key identifying information, such as name, date 
of birth, last 4 digits of the social security number, or address. 
Analyses were restricted to the 5484 New York city or state 
residents. We used, for MI, International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes 410 to 411 and International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes I21-I22, and 
for stroke, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision codes 430 to 432 and International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes I60-I63. For the follow-up 
years 2012 through 2016, 180 WTC-Heart study participants 
were identified in the SPARCS database as having been hospi-
talized with a discharge diagnosis of MI or stroke.
Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to plot the cumula-
tive incidence of MIs and stroke. Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MI or stroke, adjusted 
for use of a respirator and for recognized cardiovascular risk 
factors: age, blood pressure, total cholesterol, body mass 
index, tobacco use, and, when relevant, sex. Firth procedure 
was applied to improve aHR and CI estimates from Cox pro-
portional hazard models with small sample sizes and few 
measured outcome events.19
Because PTSD may have increased weight gain, tobacco 
use, blood pressure, and possibly cholesterol after the 2001 to 
2002 trauma, resulting in these factors being on the pathway 
to MI and stroke and biasing the hazard ratios (HRs) toward 
the null, we present primary analyses both age adjusted and, 
when sample size allows, adjusted for all these factors.
Time of event was retrieved from the participant’s inter-
view or SPARCS records. For event-free participants censoring 
for interview-based incident, events occurred at the date of 
completion of the most recent annual survey, or, for SPARCS-
derived events, on December 31, 2016—the last date of 
available SPARCS data. Analyses of postbaseline, incident 
outcomes were, therefore, repeated including and excluding 
MIs and strokes recurring during follow-up among subjects 
who already had an MI or stroke before 2012. We report 
the analysis including all cases in the article for 4 reasons: 
(1) because this cohort had a mean age of 51 years in 2012, 
all cardiovascular events occurred after 2001; (2) PTSD is a 
chronic disease, most likely secondary to 2001, for which it is 
difficult to set an exact date of onset; (3) these middle aged 
subjects who had cardiovascular events before baseline were 
subjects at the highest risk in the cohort and excluding them 
would also introduce selection bias; (4) removing 35 recurrent 
cases did not alter the statistical power for the full analysis 
(as shown in the article) but left thin data for the sex- and 
disease-specific analyses. Thus, subjects who had had pre-
baseline cardiovascular events were excluded for some of the 
exploratory full sample analyses but kept in all other analyses, 
with only the postbaseline events going into the numerator of 
the hazard rates and risks.
MI and stroke were analyzed both separately and pooled 
as a single outcome (MI/stroke) because separate analyses of 
self-reported MI and stroke, provided in an appendix, yielded 
associations of consistent magnitudes. Similarly, men and 
women were analyzed estimating both separate and pooled 
sex-adjusted HRs. The number of female cases (9 MIs, 7 
strokes, and 22 hospitalizations for MI or stroke) precluded 
statistical power for most analyses, but, as shown in the 
appendix, the magnitude of the associations was remarkably 
consistent across sex allowing for meaningful sex-adjusted

HRs. The participants who had both MI and stroke were ana-
lyzed as per the first of the 2 outcomes in the analyses pool-
ing MI and stroke.
Because PTSD and depression are highly correlated, the 
analyses for pooled MI and stroke adjusted for recognized 
cardiovascular risk factors were repeated among 4120 non-
depressed men (the number of female cases was too small to 
perform sex-adjusted analyses), after exclusion of men having 
either depression only (n=97), depression and PTSD (n=477), 
or missing depression data (n=248).
RESULTS
The sociodemographic, cardiovascular, and mental 
characteristics of the WTC-Heart cohort were similar 
to those of the whole WTCHP in which it was nested 
(Table I in the Data Supplement). As of July 1, 2016, 
510 participants (7.9%) had no follow-up information. 
The analyses are, therefore, based on 4942 men and 
1029 women (n=5971).
Baseline (2012–2013) Characteristics
Mean age was 51.3 years in men and 51.1 years in 
women. The cohort was 82.8% men, 54.1% white, 
and 25.4% lower than college education. The Table 
shows these characteristics by sex. Prevalence of PTSD 
was 19.9% in men and 25.9% in women.
Recognized Cardiovascular Risk Factors 
and Dust
Figure 1 and Table II in the Data Supplement show cur-
rent smoking standing out—besides PTSD not shown 
in Figure 1—as the main recognized risk determinant 
of incident (including recurrent) pooled MI and stroke, 
after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors 
and PTSD. Specific results for MI or stroke are shown 
in Tables III and IV in the Data Supplement. Moreover, 
resting heart rate per minute at baseline was, respec-
tively, for those without and with PTSD, 68.9 and 70.8 
in men and 69.5 and 69.9 in women (not shown in a 
table).
None of the variables differently expressing the 
timing or intensity of exposure to the WTC dust and 
dust cloud were independently associated with sub-
sequent MI or stroke in these analyses (Table V in the 
Data Supplement). Donning of a protective mask was 
deemed the closest approximation of the amount of 
dust inhaled and was adjusted for in all multivariate 
analyses (Figure 1).
Cumulative Risk of CVD by PTSD
By June 30, 2016, reported cases were 70 MIs, of which 
20 were recurrent, and 53 strokes, of which 15 were 
recurrent. Figure 2 shows the cumulative risks of MI and 
stroke for the whole sample by PTSD status. The curves 
diverge early, divergence increases over time, with sta-
tistically significant differences at P<0.0001. Specific

curves for MI or stroke by sex are shown in Figures I 
through IV in the Data Supplement.
Multivariable Analysis
In Figure 3 and Table VI in the Data Supplement the 
aHRs of PTSD were 2.22 (95% CI, 1.30–3.82) for 70 
MIs, 2.51 (95% CI, 1.39–4.57) for 53 strokes, 2.35 
(95% CI, 1.57–3.52) for 118 incident (including recur-
rent) pooled MI and stroke, and (not shown in a table 
or figure) 2.24 (95% CI, 1.39–3.63) for 83 incident 
(excluding recurrent) pooled MI and stroke. Five sub-
jects had both MI and stroke. Specific results by sex and 
outcomes are provided in Table VI in the Data Supple-
ment. In women, the estimated HRs for MI, stroke, 
and pooled MI and stroke were consistent with those 
observed among men.
Misclassification of Outcomes
Access to medical charts to validate the interview-based 
diagnosis was similar in cohort participants with (60%) 
and without PTSD (62%). The confirmation fraction 
was also similar across groups for stroke. However, for 
MIs, it was smaller for PTSD (47%) than for non-PTSD 
cases (74%). Such source of differential misclassifica-

tion could spuriously strengthen the observed associa-
tions. We, therefore, repeated the analyses using dis-
charge diagnoses for hospitalization in New York State 
for MI or stroke as outcomes—a measure independent 
of participant reports.
Hospitalization for MI or Stroke
These analyses were restricted to New York city or 
state residents (n=5484). All incident MI and strokes 
identified in interviews, whether confirmed or not in 
medical charts, were present in the SPARCS database. 
In contrast, 49 events (19 among subjects with PTSD 
and 30 among subjects without PTSD) were recorded in 
SPARCS but had been missed by the active follow-up. 
As shown in Figure 4 and Table VII in the Data Supple-
ment for hospitalizations for MI or stroke in New York, 
aHRs were 2.17 (95% CI, 1.41–3.32) for 112 MIs, 3.01 
(95% CI, 1.84–4.93) for 77 strokes, and 2.40 (95% 
CI, 1.73–3.34) for pooled 180. Nine subjects had been 
hospitalized for both MI and stroke. The association 
of PTSD and hospitalization for pooled MI and stroke 
adjusted for age only was statistically significant among 
women too (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.05–5.55).
Of note, of the 415 lost to active follow-up, 228 
(54.9%) had a record in SPARCS between January 2012 
and December 2016. Of these 228, 4 had had an MI or 
a stroke, that is, 1.8% (95% CI, 0.0–3.5). This cumula-
tive incidence of hospitalizations for MI or stroke in the 
lost to follow-up is of the same order of magnitude as 
that of 2.8% observed in the full cohort of (123/5971) 
during the same period.
Control of Depression
In the full cohort, there were 6 cases of MI or stroke in 
men with depression but no PTSD and 29 cases of MI or 
stroke in men with both depression and PTSD. Among 
men free of depression, the crude (not shown in the 
figures), age-adjusted, and multivariate (shown in Fig-
ures 3 and 4) HRs of MI or stroke were, respectively, 
1.94 (95% CI, 1.07–3.50), 2.19 (95% CI, 1.21–3.95), 
and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.01–3.49) for incidence and 1.93 
(95% CI, 1.19–3.02), 2.41 (95% CI, 1.49–3.75), and 
2.27 (95% CI, 1.41–3.67) for hospitalization.
Mortality
There were 43 deaths identified in the cohort, of which 
3 were from CVDs, 18 from other causes, and 22 from 
unknown causes.

(95% CI, 1.17–1.95) excluding recurrent cases.
DISCUSSION
After 4 years of active follow-up of WTC-Heart, PTSD 
comes out as a strong, independent determinant of 
MI and stroke, in both men and women, before and 
after controlling for recognized use of a respirator dur-
ing cleanup of debris, cardiovascular risk factors, and 
depression. Hazard ratios were consistent when analy-
ses were restricted to discharge diagnoses of MI and 
stroke derived from a New York hospital registry that 
did not include any patient self-reports.
Because of its methodological strength (ie, active 
follow-up, medical chart validation, and adjustment 
for depression), this study validates previous reports 
of exclusively male or female cohorts4,5 and those of 
the WTC-Registry reports.11,12 The independence of the 
PTSD and MI or stroke association from depression is 
consistent with most4 but not all reports.20,21
PTSD and CVD in Women
The associations with PTSD were in the same order of 
magnitude for men and women, and, specifically, the 
association of PTSD and hospitalization for pooled MI 
and stroke was statistically significant in both sexes. Of 
the 3 previous cohort studies that examined women, 2 
had only women,7,10 and 1 lacked measured conven-
tional cardiovascular risk factors.11,12 The average ages 
of women at baseline in these 3 cohorts were 44.4,7 
34,10 and 32 years,12 whereas women in WTC-Heart 
were 51.1 years of age at baseline. Thus, the present

results add qualitatively to the evidence indicating that 
PTSD before menopause increases women’s long-term 
risk of MI and stroke.22
Biological Plausibility
PTSD is a polythetic disorder consisting of clusters 
of symptoms potentially impacting cardiometabolic 
risk.23,24 For example, PTSD may develop and persist 
because of fear manifested by nightmares, intense 
emotional and physiological re-experiencing of the 
trauma, active avoidance of cues or reminders of the 
trauma, and exaggerated startle response to threat.25 
Another cluster groups symptoms evoking major 
depression, such as anhedonia, detachment, restricted 
affect, sleep difficulty, and failing concentration.26–28 In 
humans, the stress associated with these PTSD dimen-
sions may upregulate amygdalar activity, activating 
both the sympathetic nervous system, releasing inflam-
matory cells from the bone marrow, and leading to 
atherosclerotic inflammation, MI, and stroke.29–36 The 
similar effect sizes in this study suggest similar mecha-
nisms relating PTSD and incident MI or stroke in men 
and women.37
Recognized Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Current smoking was the only recognized cardiovascu-
lar risk determinant in this cohort. Blood lipids, blood 
pressure, and body mass were not associated with MI 
or stroke. These recognized risk factors may play a role 
for individual cohort members, but they do not discrim-
inate cardiovascular risk in this homogeneous cohort of 
blue-collar workers.
Because PTSD is more prevalent in this cohort 
(20.9%) than current smoking (7.1%) for aHRs of a 
similar magnitude of 2, ≈3× more cardiovascular cases 
are attributable to PTSD than to current smoking.

Dust Exposure
None of the variables expressing exposure to the WTC 
dust, such as the timing and intensity of exposure to 
the dust cloud or the donning of a protective mask, 
were independently associated with subsequent MI or 
stroke in these analyses.
Limitations
The exposure severity and cardiovascular profile of the 
subcohort of survivors enrolled in the WTC-Heart sub-
jects may not be representative of the estimated 90 
000 
individuals who originally responded to the September 
11 disaster (Figure 5). However, given the homogeneity of 
the cohort of blue-collar worker in terms of cardiovas-
cular risk, the selection process is unlikely to have biased 
the risk comparison among the enrollees between those 
who developed PTSD and those who did not. Moreover, 
the small losses to follow-up (7.9%) offer some pro-
tection against selection bias, in particular because we 
could establish that (1) the proportion of lost to follow-
up was identical in men (7.9%) and women (7.7%), (2) 
the subjects lost to follow-up had a similar cardiovascular 
risk profile as those who remained in the cohort (Table 
VIII in the Data Supplement), and (3) the cumulative risk 
of MI and stroke for more than half of those who were 
never contacted after baseline but had a record in the 
New York State SPARCS program was of the same order 
of magnitude as the risk of the rest of the cohort.
We were not able to obtain the causes of death for 
22 participants and do not know which proportion of 
the lost to follow-up died of CVDs. Incorporating car-
diovascular deaths could have attenuated or exacerbat-
ed the present findings. However, the small number of 
cardiovascular deaths expected given the age distribu-
tion of the cohort is unlikely to have qualitatively modi-
fied the cumulative risks of events, which progressively 
diverged over time between participants with and with-
out PTSD (Figure 2).
Also, because participants were sampled consecu-
tively among subjects attending the WTCHP either 
for their annual visit or for health problems, we may 
have included people visiting the clinic more frequently 
because of poorer health problems than those only 
visiting the clinic once per year. However, as shown 
in Table I in the Data Supplement, the demographics 
of WTC-Heart were virtually identical to those of the 
whole WTCHP in which it was nested. Prevalences of 
PSTD in WTC-Heart were almost identical to those pub-
lished for the whole WTCHP
.38
Additional limitations include a self-report of PTSD 
based on the PCL-C questionnaire, residual confound-
ing from self-report of depression based on the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 and recall of respirator use and 
exposure to the dust cloud, and the lack of assessment 
of potential biological mediators and unmeasured con-
founding (eg, prior trauma) of the association between 
PTSD and MI/stroke. However, similar baseline heart rate 
for those with and without PTSD suggests no specific 
factor that protects against both PTSD and MI/stroke.
Strengths
Because WTC-Heart is nested within the health program 
(ie, WTCHP) begun 1 year after the attack and currently 
providing lifetime free medical care for WTC-related 
medical conditions to first responders, the cohort study 
had a unique opportunity to recruit exposed workers 
11 to 15 years after September 11 as they entered ages 
at which incidence of CVD increases rapidly and follow 
them up for 4 years with small losses (7.9%).
In agreement with previous WTC reports,3 preva-
lence of PTSD in this cohort comprising a majority of 
nontrained responders was more than twice of that in 
the general population. This excess prevalence of PTSD 
provided statistical power to study the association of 
PTSD and cardiovascular outcomes in both sexes. The 
young age of the cohort participants, associated with

low rates of MI or stroke, negatively affected statistical 
power but allowed us to reasonably assume that few 
cases were missed during the 2001 to 2012 period. The 
young age may also have facilitated singling out the 
effect of PTSD for lack of competing causes.
In terms of validity and confounding controls, analy-
ses were performed before and after adjustment for 
measured recognized cardiovascular risk factors; in 
men, the association was observed in the subgroup free 
of depression; interview-based outcomes were tenta-
tively confirmed in medical charts; findings for inter-
view-based diagnoses of incident MIs and stroke were 
reproduced after linkage to hospitalization records.
Conclusions
Because of its design, this cohort study offers unique 
and strong evidence that WTC attack–related PTSD is a 
risk factor for MI and stroke, in men and women, and 
independently of recognized cardiovascular risk factors 
and depression.
