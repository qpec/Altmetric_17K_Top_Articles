Abstract:
Objectives:
Galla  chinensis  water  extract  (GCE)  has  been  demonstrated  to  inhibit  dental  caries  by  favorably  shifting  the
demineralization/remineralization balance of enamel and inhibiting the biomass and acid formation of dental biofilm. The present
study focused on the comparison of composition and anticaries effect of Galla chinensis extracts with different isolation methods,
aiming to improve the efficacy of caries prevention.
Methods:
The composition of water extract (GCE), ethanol extract (eGCE) and commercial tannic acid was compared. High performance
liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) analysis was used
to analyze the main ingredients. In vitro pH-cycling regime and polymicrobial biofilms model were used to assess the ability of
different Galla chinensis extracts to inhibit enamel demineralization, acid formation and biofilm formation.
Results:
All the GCE, eGCE and tannic acid contained a high level of total phenolics. HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS analysis showed that the main
ingredients of GCE were gallic acid (GA), while eGCE mainly contained 4-7 galloylglucopyranoses (GGs) and tannic acid mainly
contained  5-10  GGs.  Furthermore,  eGCE  and  tannic  acid  showed  a  better  effect  on  inhibiting  enamel  demineralization,  acid
formation and biofilm formation compared to GCE.
Conclusions:
Galla chinensis extracts with higher tannin content were suggested to have higher potential to prevent dental caries.

1. INTRODUCTION
Dental caries, the most prevalent and costly oral infectious disease worldwide, is attributed to prolonged plaque
acidification resulting from the metabolic activity of cariogenic microbiota, which leads to demineralization of the tooth
[1 - 3]. Although fluoride’s cariostatic efficacy has been demonstrated, additional approaches are needed to enhance its
effectiveness [4, 5]. Natural products have been used as a major source of innovative and effective therapeutic agents
throughout human history, offering a diverse range of structurally distinctive bioactive molecules [6]. It is estimated
that plants produce a vast array of more than 100,000 metabolites, and the total number of metabolites in plants exceeds
500,000 [7]. These structurally diverse substances with a wide range of biological activities could be useful for the
development of alternative or adjunctive anticaries therapies. However, identification of the bioactive component or
compound from thousands of chemicals still remains a fundamental challenge to develop natural product derived
anticaries agents.
In recent years, one of the natural products, Galla chinensis extract (GCE) was demonstrated with potentials to
inhibit  the  activities  of  cariogenic  pathogens  and  favorably  shift  the  demineralization/remineralization  balance  of
enamel  and  dentine  [8  -  12].  However,  complete  chemical  characterization  of  GCE  is  still  needed  before  further
application. In addition, different extraction methods might influence its compositions and subsequent bioactivities.
During previous studies, we noticed that, in inhibiting enamel demineralization, GCE was more effective than GCE-A,
GCE-B, GCE-C and GCE-D, which were fractionated from GCE by adsorption chromatography [13]. Whereas other
studies showed that the aqueous extract of Galla chinensis could inhibit periodontopathogenic bacteria and an ethanol
extract was reported having strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus [14, 15]. Tian’s studies on
consecutive extracts from Galla chinensis showed that the extracts with weaker polarity (such as ethyl acetate and
ethanol) contained gallotannins with higher molecular weight, and had stronger antioxidant and antibacterial activities
[16]. Given the complex chemical nature of natural products, it still remains a challenge to screen bioactive component
and optimize the isolation methods, which may finally yield the best anti-caries effect.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to chemically characterize three Galla chinensis extracts: aqueous extract
(GCE), ethanol extract (eGCE) and tannic acid (gallotannin, extracted from Galla chinensis) and to compare their
anticaries effects, and identify the most effective Galla chinensis extract as an anticaries agent.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Plant Material
Galla chinensis (origin: Sichuan province, China) was purchased from China Tong Ren Tang drugstore (Chengdu,
China) and authenticated by Prof. Jing Huang, in the Institute of Naturally Occurring Drugs of Sichuan University,
Chengdu, China.
2.2. Extraction of Galla Chinensis
Galla chinensis (2 kg) was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 3 days, and then finely powdered. The powder was equally
divided into two portions. One was added to 600 mL of distilled water and stirred for 10 h at 65°C and then filtered.
The extract was re-extracted with distilled water under the same conditions. Then the extract was dissolved in 500 mL
of ethanol (95%). After filtration and evaporation, the remaining extract was lyophilized to give a powder (Galla
chinensis aqueous  extract, GCE).  Another portion  was added  to ten  times ethanol (95%). The  mixture was  stirred at
50 °C and then filtered. The extract was re-extracted with ethanol under the same conditions. After filtration and
evaporation of the ethanol, the remaining extract was lyophilized to give a powder (Galla chinensis ethanol extract,
eGCE). Tannic acid was purchased from Sigma (Guarantee analysis, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which is extracted from
Galla chinensis and is also called gallotannin.
2.3. Determination of Total Phenolics
Total phenolics (TP) were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) assay and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE)
based on a gallic acid (GA) calibration curve. FC assay was performed according to Singleton and Rossi [17], which
has been modified to determine the total phenolics of Galla chinensis extracts previously [18]. Each sample was
performed in triplicate.

2.4. Determination of Tannin Content
The tannin content was determined using the method described by Tian [18] and was also determined as GAE. The
tannin content was the difference of total phenolics of test sample before and after precipitating casein referring to the
FC assay. Each sample was performed in quadruplicate.
2.5.  High  Performance  Liquid  Chromatography  Coupled  to  Electrospray  Ionization-Time  of  Flight-Mass
Spectrometry Analysis
GCE, eGCE and tannic acid were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray
ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) [19], a tandem system. The Agilent 1200 series
HPLC consisted of a model G1315D diode array detector (DAD), a G1312B binary Pump, a G1379B vacuum degasser,
a G1367C auto-sampler and a G1316B column heater. The concentration of the testing solution was 1mg/mL, and the
injection volume was 5 μL. Gradient elution HPLC was applied at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with detection at 270 nm.
Two solvents were used for the mobile phase: (A) 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate (pH3.0), (B)
acetonitrile. Compounds were separated using the following gradient: 0-5 min, 5% B; 5-8 min, 20% B; 20-30 min, 30%
B; 30-40 min, 20% B; 40.0-40.1 min, 5% B. The separation of components in GCE was performed on an Agilent
column (Poroshell 120 SB-C18, 150mm × 4.6mm, particle size 2.7μm) at 40 °C.
The time of flight (TOF) mass detector (G1969A, Agilent, US) was equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI)
interface. The ESI voltage was 3.5 kV, and a mass range of 50-3000 m/z was scanned in negative full scan mode. Data
processing was performed on Agilent Mass Hunter (v.B.01.04) software.
2.6. Determination of GA Content in GCE
HPLC-DAD  was  equipped  and  the  gradient  elution  HPLC  conditions  were  the  same  as  HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS
analysis. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, and detection wavelength was 270 nm. The injection volume was 10 μL. Data
processing was performed on CHEMSTATION (v.B.04.02) software. GA (reference substance) in all the studies was
purchased from The National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, Chengdu, China.
2.7. Effects on Demineralization of Bovine Enamel
Bovine  enamel  specimens  were  prepared  and  the  baseline  surface  microhardness  (SMH)  was  measured  as  in
previous studies [20]. Then, forty specimens were selected from a batch of 420 specimens, with baseline SMH between
388.7 and 436.1 Knoop hardness number (KHN).
The  specimens  were  randomly  divided  into  the  following  5  treatment  groups  (each  N=10):  4.0  mg/mL  GCE
solution,  4.0  mg/mL  eGCE  solution,  4.0  mg/mL  tannic  acid  solution,  1  mg/mL  NaF  solution  (positive  control),
deionized distilled water (DDW, negative control). Next, specimens were pH-cycled following the procedure described
in a previous study [2]. In brief, after immersion of the specimens in one of the treatment solutions for 5 min, the blocks
were placed in an acidic buffer (50 mmol/L acetic acid, 1.5 mmol/L potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, pH 5.0) for
1h  (2  mL  per  block),  and  then  in  a  neutral  buffer  (20  mmol/L  HEPES,  1.5  mmol/L  potassium  dihydrogen
orthophosphate, pH 7.0) for 5 min (2 mL per block) in each of 12 cycles. After each step, the specimens were washed in
DDW (1 min) for 3 times.
After pH-cycling, the acidic buffers were retained for analysis. Calcium concentration in the acidic solutions was
determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS, Thermo Element MKII-M6, Thermo Electron, USA).
Then a calcium depletion rate (CDR) for each sample was calculated. This is a measure of calcium extracted per unit
area per unit time in the 2 mL acid and is calculated as
In  addition,  representative  specimens  from  all  treatment  groups  were  randomly  selected  for  scanning  electron
microscopic (SEM). Air-dried samples were sputtered with gold resulting in a gold coating. Then, the morphology of
enamel surfaces was evaluated with a SEM (S450, Hitachi, Japan).

2.8. Effects on Polymicrobial Biofilms
Polymicrobial biofilms were formed in a high-throughput active attachment biofilm model as described in detail in
previous studies and previously used to determine the effects of GCE on biofilms [21, 22]. In brief, glass disks were
attached to a custom made lid, in such a way that each disk fitted into one of the wells of a polystyrene, 24-well flat-
bottomed microtiter plate. Each well was filled with 1.5 ml McBain medium [23], supplemented with 0.2% (w/v)
sucrose and buffered at pH 7.0 with 50 mM PIPES buffer, to submerge the disks. A saliva-glycerol stock was added
(1:50 final dilution) as inoculum and the microtiter plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for a total period of
48h, with refreshments of the medium after 8, 24 and 32 h. Subsequently, the disks were immersed into one of the
following eight treatment solutions (4 mg/mL GCE solution, 4 mg/mL eGCE solution, 4 mg/mL tannic acid solution or
DDW) for 1 h. After treatment, biofilms were harvested in PBS solution. Treatments effects were assessed from colony
forming unit (CFU) and lactic acid formation data. For this, saliva had been donated by a single donor. The model was
approved by the institutional review board and the donor had given written informed consent.
2.9. Statistical Analysis
Statistical evaluations were performed using the SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Incorporated, Chicago). The normal
distribution of the data was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk tests. T-test and One-way ANOVA was used. The level of
significance was set at 5%.
3. RESULT
3.1. Determination of Total Phenolics and Tannin Content
The total phenolics and tannin content is shown in Fig. (1). The three Galla chinensis extracts had similar values in
total phenolics but had different tannin content. eGCE and tannic acid had more tannin than GCE, indicating these two
extracts had stronger capability to precipitate proteins.

compounds and m/z values are shown in Table (1) [16, 24 - 26]. The m/z values revealed that GCE were mixtures,
consisting mainly of GA and its isomer, and 1-3 galloylglucopyranoses (GGs), while eGCE mainly contained GA and
4-7 GGs, and tannic acid mainly contained 5-10 GGs.

The CDRs analysis is presented in Fig. (4). CDRs were significantly lower in Galla chinensis extracts groups and
NaF group than in DDW group (ANOVA, P < 0.05). However, CDRs were significantly higher in GCE group than in
eGCE group, tannic acid, and NaF group (ANOVA, P < 0.05). No significant differences of CDRs were observed
among eGCE, tannic acid and NaF groups (ANOVA, P > 0.05). The data show that all Galla chinensis extracts could
inhibit enamel demineralization, and GCE was less effective than eGCE and tannic acid.

4. DISCUSSION
In the present study, the composition and anticaries effects of Galla chinensis extracts with different isolation
methods was compared. All the GCE, eGCE and tannic acid contained high level of total phenolics, while eGCE and
Tannic acid had more tannin than GCE, indicating these two extracts had stronger capability to precipitate proteins.
HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS analysis further showed that the main ingredients of GCE were GA, while eGCE mainly contained
4-7 GGs and tannic acid, a commercialized gallotannin from Galla chinensis, mainly contained 5-10 GGs. In addition,
when assessed by using in vitro pH-cycling regime and polymicrobial biofilm model, eGCE and tannic acid showed
better effect on inhibiting enamel demineralization, acid formation and biofilm formation compared to GCE. Combined
with those finding, Galla chinensis extracts with higher tannin content were suggested to have higher potential to
prevent dental caries.
Natural products have been used as an extremely diverse source for developing innovative anti-caries reagent;
however, the great complexity of biological samples still remains a major obstacle to the identification of the true
effective composition. Galla chinensis is rich in heterogenous gallotannins and also contains nearly 20% GA, 7%
methyl gallate, and some resin, fat, wax, starch, etc [16, 27]. Previous studies have already proved the in vitro efficacy
of GCE as an anti-caries reagent. However, little is known about the chemical composition of GCE and its relationship
with functional activities, as different extract conditions, e.g., extraction solvent, temperature, pH, extraction time,
particle size and other supplementary means such as microwave, would influence the yields and products [16, 28]. In
the present study, we only changed two factors, extraction solvent and temperature, and found that the composition of
extracts was significantly changed. GCE extracted by water at 65°C, contained less tannin content than eGCE extracted
by ethanol at 50°C. This is in agreement with a previous study that gallotannins in Galla chinensis had weak polarity
and were more soluble in non-polar or weak-polar solvents, such as ethanol compared to polar solvents, such as water
[16].
As Galla chinensis mainly contained hydrolysable tannins, to further elucidate the detailed constituents of GCE,
HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS was applied. HPLC is one of the predominant methods used to separate constituent. HPLC with
gradient elution has a continuous change in the mobile phase during separation, which is essential for improving the
sharpness of the peaks [29]. HPLC coupled with mass detection was widely used to identify unknown polyphenolics in
biological  samples  [30].  The  online  coupling  of  HPLC  with  MS  using  ESI  can  provide  efficient  resolution  and
identification of a wide range of polar compounds, while TOF-MS can provide accurate mass data over a wide dynamic
range and thereby permits the rapid and reliable assessment of the elemental composition of ions [31]. In the combined
detection system, major constituents and degree of polymerization of Galla chinensis extract were revealed. This lays
an initial basis to exploit the structure-activity relationship to develop reliable anti-caries reagent with defined chemical
composition.
Inhibiting enamel demineralization is an effective strategy to prevent dental caries [32]. The process of enamel
demineralization involves the dissolution of enamel apatite crystals and the diffusion of ions. It has been suggested that
the  diffusion pathway  in enamel  is controlled  by the organic  matrix network, which  occupies both  the inter  and
intra-prismatic  spaces  [33],  and  the  changes  on  enamel  organic  matrix  can  affect  the  process  of  the  enamel
demineralization through the control of the diffusion pathway in tooth structures [34]. In a previous study, GA, the main
component in GCE, has been revealed to inhibit enamel demineralization [35] and GCE-organic matrix interaction has
been further found to play a substantial role in inhibiting the demineralization [36]. The enamel organic matrix consists
of short peptide fragments, rich in Pro, Glx, and Gly, which are presumably breakdown products of the major enamel
matrix protein, amelogenin [37]. GCE could interact with enamel organic matrix through polyphenols organic matrix
interaction involving covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic processes [38, 39]. This interaction could
stabilize the enamel organic matrix during the acid attack and the induced metamorphic enamel organic matrix is
precipitated in the enamel and blocks the diffusion pathway of the ions in tooth structures, thus inhibiting the mineral
loss from enamel [39]. In the current study, the three extracts could all inhibit enamel demineralization but showed
different activities. eGCE and tannic acid were more effective than GCE in inhibiting the enamel demineralization as
HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS analysis revealed that they contain more high molecular weight gallotannins. As it is reported for
1-10GGs, a higher degree of galloylation results in stronger protein binding ability, it is reasonable that eGCE and
tannic acid could interact with enamel organic matrix more potently and therefore inhibit enamel demineralization more
effectively compared to GCE.
The biofilms model in the present study is an active attachment rather than a sedimentation biofilm model, and
saliva was used as inoculum to form polymicrobial biofilm. Thus, the model can provide new and relevant insights into
 Composition and Anti-Caries Effect of GCE
The Open Dentistry Journal, 2017, Volume 11   457
the properties and dynamics of the dental plaque ecosystem [8, 21]. The resistance to killing by antimicrobial agents in
biofilms increases compared with the resistance exhibited by planktonic bacteria, during which, biofilm matrix plays an
important role, either by acting as a diffusion barrier, or by binding directly to antimicrobial agents and preventing their
access to the biofilm cells [40]. Therefore, the interaction with target proteins in our biofilms was much more difficult,
and the effects on caries pathogens in biofilms were much less [41]. In the present model, all the Galla chinensis
extracts showed inhibitive effect on the microbial metabolism and polymicrobial biofilm formation, and eGCE (mainly
with 4-7GGs) and tannic acid (mainly with 5-10GGs) have stronger inhibition effect than GCE, which were consistent
with the findings that the extracts with weaker polarity contained gallotannins with higher molecular weight, and had
stronger antibacterial activities [18]. It is possible that polyphenols in Galla chinensis extracts can interact with the
membrane proteins of bacteria by means of hydrogen bonding through their hydroxyl groups, which can result in
changes  in  membrane  permeability  and  cause  cell  destruction  and  inhibit  cell  proliferation  [42].  In  addition,
polyphenols may also penetrate into bacterial cells, disrupt the proton motive force, electron flow, active transport and
coagulate cell contents, resulting in lowered lactic acid production. Besides, eGCE mainly contained 1-7GGs. 6GGs and
7GGs were demonstrated with more remarkable antibacterial activities than other gallotannins [18]. We speculate the
medium molecular weight gallotannins are easier to penetrate the diffusion barrier in biofilm than high molecular
weight  gallotannins  and  are  easier  to  react  with  target  protein  than  GA  and  high  molecular  weight  gallotannins,
although this requires further investigation.
CONCLUSION
Taking information on compositions and anticaries effects of three Galla chinensis extracts together, eGCE and
tannic acid are suggested to be the most effective Galla chinensis extracts as anticaries agent. Further we conclude that
medium  molecular  weight  gallotannins  are  the  most  active  constituent  in  terms  of  caries  prevention.  Optimum
extraction  methods  should  be  chosen  to  maximize  their  levels  in  caries  preventive  extracts.
