 INTRODUCTION 
In the UK more than 53 000 women are 
diagnosed with breast cancer each year, 
and 11 000 die of the disease.1 Women 
with a family history of the disease are at 
increased risk, and this accounts for 5–10% 
of all breast cancer cases.2 The majority 
of women with an increased risk of breast 
cancer are ineligible for prophylactic surgery, 
and therefore prevention by other means is 
a priority.3
In 2013, the UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued 
recommendations regarding the use of two 
selective oestrogen-receptor modulators 
(SERMs), tamoxifen and raloxifene, for 
women at increased risk of breast cancer 
because of their family history.3 SERMs 
reduce breast cancer incidence by ≥30%.4 
The number needed to treat to prevent 
one diagnosis of breast cancer in the first 
10 years is 42. However, the decision to 
prescribe SERMs is complicated because 
current preventive therapy trials are not 
designed to detect effects on mortality,5 and 
the medications are not licensed for primary 
prevention. SERMs also increase the risk 
of thromboembolic events, endometrial 
cancer, and menopausal side effects.4 Only 
one in six women accept the offer of breast 
cancer preventive therapy, and uptake is 
significantly lower in non-trial settings.6 The 
cancer strategy for England (2015–2020) 
has recommended that action be taken to 
ensure preventive therapy is appropriately 
prescribed in the NHS.7 
Previous qualitative work by the authors has 
suggested GPs and family history clinicians 
experience barriers to implementing the 
NICE clinical guideline for familial breast 
cancer (CG164).8 Concerns were raised 
relating to licensing, interpretation of the 
NICE guideline, and responsibility for 
prescribing. GPs suggested they may be 
more comfortable continuing a preventive 
therapy prescription, providing it had been 
initiated in secondary care. To validate 
and quantify these findings, the authors 
surveyed a national sample of GPs who were 
randomised to view one of four case studies 
of a hypothetical patient seeking a tamoxifen 
prescription for primary prevention.

Abstract
Background
The cancer strategy for England (2015–2020) 
recommends GPs prescribe tamoxifen for 
breast cancer primary prevention among 
women at increased risk. 
Aim
To investigate GPs’ attitudes towards 
prescribing tamoxifen.
Design and setting
In an online survey, GPs in England, Northern 
Ireland, and Wales (n = 928) were randomised 
using a 2 × 2 between-subjects design to read 
one of four vignettes describing a healthy 
patient seeking a tamoxifen prescription.
Method
In the vignette, the hypothetical patient’s breast 
cancer risk (moderate versus high) and the 
clinician initiating the prescription (GP prescriber 
versus secondary care clinician [SCC] prescriber) 
were manipulated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Outcomes 
were willingness to prescribe, comfort discussing 
harms and benefits, comfort managing the 
patient, factors affecting the prescribing decision, 
and awareness of tamoxifen and the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
guideline CG164.
Results
Half (51.7%) of the GPs knew tamoxifen can 
reduce breast cancer risk, and one-quarter 
(24.1%) were aware of NICE guideline CG164. 
Responders asked to initiate prescribing (GP 
prescriber) were less willing to prescribe 
tamoxifen than those continuing a prescription 
initiated in secondary care (SCC prescriber) 
(68.9% versus 84.6%, P<0.001). The GP 
prescribers reported less comfort discussing 
tamoxifen (53.4% versus 62.5%, P = 0.01). GPs 
willing to prescribe were more likely to be 
aware of the NICE guideline (P = 0.039) and to 
have acknowledged the benefits of tamoxifen 
(P<0.001), and were less likely to have 
considered its off-licence status (P<0.001). 
Conclusion
Initiating tamoxifen prescriptions for preventive 
therapy in secondary care before asking GPs to 
continue the patient’s care may overcome some 
prescribing barriers.

Prescribing tamoxifen in primary care for the 
prevention of breast cancer:
a national online survey of GPs’ attitudes
e414  British Journal of General Practice, June 2017
 UK was undertaken in April 2016. Members 
of a research panel with more than 33 000 
members were e-mailed an invitation to 
take part. Sampling was done by inviting 
panellists on an unfiltered random basis 
to avoid over-sampling. GPs practising 
in Scotland were excluded from these 
analyses because an agreed care pathway 
already exists there for the prescription of 
tamoxifen.9 GPs practising outside of the UK 
were excluded. The study was prospectively 
registered (ISRCTN14292000).
Questionnaire design
Responders were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 
ratio to one of four case study vignettes 
describing a hypothetical patient at 
increased risk of breast cancer (Appendix 1).
The vignettes were designed with input from 
clinical geneticists, medical oncologists, 
GPs, and public health specialists. They 
were intended to be representative of a 
typical patient attending a family history 
clinic, and were informed by the authors’ 
earlier research.8 The vignettes described 
a hypothetical patient’s age (45 years), risk 
level, premenopausal status, her lack of 
contraindications, and her discussion in 
secondary care. The case studies were 
presented using a between-subjects 2 × 2 
factorial design, where patient risk level 
(moderate lifetime risk of 17–30% versus 
high lifetime risk of ≥30%) and the clinician 
responsible for initiating the prescription 
(GP versus secondary care clinician) were 
manipulated. The secondary care clinician 
was described as a family history clinician. 
The case study was available to them 
throughout the survey.
Prior to the vignettes, responders were 
informed about the NICE guidelines, the 
eligibility criteria for tamoxifen, the harms 
and benefits of the drug, the typical patient 
pathway, and the licensing status. This 
information was available throughout the 
survey. 
Measures
Chemoprevention awareness. Responders 
were asked if they were aware tamoxifen 
could be used for risk reduction in women 
with a family history of breast cancer, and 
if they were aware of the relevant NICE 
guideline. Responders answering ‘yes’ to 
the second question were asked how they 
became aware that tamoxifen could be used 
for primary prevention. Example options are 
shown in Appendix 2.
Willingness to prescribe. GPs’ willingness 
to prescribe tamoxifen was assessed, and 
response options were ‘definitely not willing’, 
‘probably not willing’, ‘probably willing’, and 
‘definitely willing’. Data were combined to 
reflect unwilling and willing responses. 
Comfort discussing harms and benefits 
of long-term management. GPs were 
asked to report their comfort in discussing 
the harms and benefits of tamoxifen 
with a patient, as well as their comfort in 
managing the patient for the duration of the 
prescription. Response options were ‘very 
uncomfortable’, ‘quite uncomfortable’, ‘quite 
comfortable’, and ‘very comfortable’. Data 
were combined to reflect GPs who were 
uncomfortable and comfortable. 
Barriers 
to 
prescribing. Responders 
were offered a series of factors that could 
potentially affect the willingness of GPs to 
write a prescription for the hypothetical 
patient. Responders were provided with 
the response categories ‘strongly disagree’, 
‘disagree’, ‘agree’, and ‘strongly agree’. Data 
were combined to reflect agreement and 
disagreement. 
Responder 
characteristics. GPs 
self-
reported their sex, age in 10-year bands, 
status within the practice, region of practice, 
year qualified in general practice, and 
special interests.
Statistical analysis
The data were described using percentages. 
For the vignettes, the main effects of risk 
and type of prescriber on willingness to 
prescribe, comfort discussing tamoxifen, 
and comfort managing the patient were 
tested using unadjusted logistic regression. 
Logistic regression models with the 
interaction between risk and prescriber 
were also tested. Multivariable logistic 
regression adjusted for nation, GP status, 
sex, age, experience, and specialisms was 
used to compare subgroup differences 
on study outcomes. Unadjusted logistic 
regression was used to compare differences 
How this fits in
The cancer strategy for England 
recommends that GPs prescribe tamoxifen 
for breast cancer primary prevention 
among women at increased risk. The 
authors demonstrated that GPs are largely 
unaware of using tamoxifen for primary 
prevention, and a significant minority 
may be unwilling to prescribe the drug 
for eligible patients. These data show 
that a shared care agreement between 
primary and secondary care could alleviate 
a number of concerns, and facilitate 
appropriate prescribing.

 in endorsement of barriers between GPs 
who were and were not willing to prescribe 
tamoxifen. Statistical significance was set 
at P<0.05. Analyses were conducted using 
SPSS (version 22). 
RESULTS
Sample overview
In total, 13 764 of approximately 33 000 
GPs were approached via e-mail, and 1321 
started the survey (9.6%). Responders were 
excluded if they did not agree to the terms 
and conditions (n = 35), did not complete the 
survey (n = 143), completed the survey after 
the deadline (n = 35), or failed a data quality 
check (n = 101). Scottish GPs (n = 79) were 
also excluded, leaving data from 928 GPs 
for this analysis. An overview of the sample 
compared with national data is shown in 
Table 1. Participant characteristics across 
the study arms were comparable (Table 2). 
Awareness of tamoxifen and the NICE 
guidelines
Approximately half (51.7%) of the responders 
were aware tamoxifen could be used to 
reduce the risk of breast cancer, and 
one-quarter (24.1%) were aware of NICE 
guideline CG164. Among those who were 
aware of the NICE guideline, common 
sources of information about tamoxifen 
were training days (31.7%), GP magazines 
(30.9%), and the NICE guideline (30.9%) 
(Figure 1).
Barriers to prescribing and discussing 
breast cancer preventive therapy
Willingness to prescribe. The majority 
of GPs (77.4%) were willing to prescribe 
tamoxifen for the hypothetical patient 
(definitely willing 17.6%, probably willing 
59.8%). The remaining GPs were either 
probably not willing (18.1%) or not at all 
willing (4.5%) to prescribe tamoxifen. Male 
GPs were more likely to report a willingness 
to prescribe tamoxifen than female GPs 
(odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.00 to 1.90, P = 0.05). 
Willingness to prescribe was unaffected by 
the other GP characteristics (Table 3). 
Table 4 shows the proportion of GPs 
willing to prescribe tamoxifen in each 
condition. GPs told they would be asked 
to be the first prescriber were significantly 
less willing to prescribe tamoxifen than 
GPs told they would be asked to continue 
a prescription initiated in secondary care 
(68.9% versus 84.6%, OR 0.40, 95% CI = 0.29

aData from British Medical Association briefing document.10If Scotland were included in the sample, the 
proportions in each country are as follows: England 85.6%, Scotland 7.8%, Wales 3.9%, and Northern Ireland 
2.7%.

 to 0.55, P <0.001). There were no differences 
in responders’ willingness according to 
patient risk (moderate risk 77.1% versus 
high risk 77.7%, OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 
1.41, P = 0.83). There was no interaction 
between the two factors. 
Comfort in discussing harms and benefits 
of tamoxifen. The majority of GPs were 
either very comfortable (6.5%) or quite 
comfortable (51.8%) discussing the harms 
and benefits of tamoxifen. The remaining 
GPs were either quite uncomfortable 
(36.6%) or very uncomfortable (5.1%). In 
multivariable analysis, comfort in discussing 
the harms and benefits of tamoxifen with a 
patient was higher among GPs >50 years 
(OR 1.53, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.17, P = 0.02), 
with >10 years’ experience (OR 1.39, 
95% = CI 1.02 to 1.91, P = 0.04), and those 
with a special interest in cancer (OR 1.79, 
95% CI = 1.12 to 2.85, P = 0.02). Comfort 
discussing tamoxifen was unaffected by the 
remaining GP characteristics (Appendix 3). 
GPs were more likely to report they were 
comfortable in discussing the harms and 
benefits of tamoxifen if they were told a 
secondary care clinician would write the 
first prescription, compared with those who 
were told they would be asked to prescribe 
first (62.5% versus 53.4%, OR 0.69, 
95% CI = 0.53 to 0.90, P = 0.01). There 
were no significant differences in reported 
comfort discussing the harms and benefits 
according to the patient’s risk (moderate 
risk 56.6% versus high risk 60.3%, P = 0.25), 
and there was no interaction between the 
two factors. 
Comfort in managing the patient’s 
care. The majority of GPs were very 
comfortable (7.8%) or quite comfortable 
(58.6%) managing the patient, should she 
decide to take tamoxifen. The remaining 
GPs were quite uncomfortable (29.8%) 
or very uncomfortable (3.8%). Comfort 
managing the hypothetical patient was 
higher among GPs with a special interest in 
preventive medicine (OR 1.66, 95% CI = 1.03 
to 2.69, P = 0.04). Comfort managing the 
patient was unaffected by all other GP 
characteristics (Appendix 4).
There were no differences in comfort 
managing the patient comparing the 
prescriber manipulation or the patient risk 
manipulation. There was also no interaction 
between these variables. 
Tamoxifen attitudes according to knowledge 
of the national guideline. GPs who were 
aware of the NICE guideline were more 
willing to prescribe tamoxifen, with 82.4% 
who were aware being willing to prescribe, 
compared with 75.7% who were unaware 
(OR 1.50, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.19, P = 0.04). 
Awareness of the NICE guideline also 
affected reported comfort in discussing 
the potential harms and benefits of 
tamoxifen, with 66.5% of those who were

55.6% of those who were unaware being 
comfortable (OR 1.58, 95% CI = 1.16 to

Factors affecting prescribing decisions. GPs 
were most likely to agree that the evidence 
for the benefits of the drug (95.0%), the 
existence of the NICE guideline (95.0%), 
and the patient’s awareness of the harms 
and benefits (94.1%) affected their decision 
(Table 5). GPs who were willing to prescribe 
were more likely to consider a number of 
factors than those who were unwilling. Key 
differences were observed with regard to 
their consideration of prescribing off label 
(91.4% of those unwilling to prescribe agreed

DISCUSSION
Summary
The cancer strategy for England (2015–
2020) has recommended that work 
should be done to ensure tamoxifen is 
appropriately prescribed as preventive 
therapy to interested patients. This national 
study showed that only three-quarters of 
UK GPs reported that they would be willing 
to prescribe tamoxifen for a hypothetical 
patient at increased risk of breast cancer
. 
Willingness was significantly lower among 
GPs who were told that they would be 
asked to initiate the drug prescription, 
compared with GPs who were asked to 
continue a prescription from a clinician in 
secondary care. Levels of reported comfort 
in discussing the harms and benefits of 
tamoxifen were low, and responders who 
were asked to prescribe first reported 
significantly lower levels of comfort. The 
most commonly reported barrier among 
GPs who were unwilling to prescribe was 
concern about off-label prescribing. 
Strengths and limitations
This study was strengthened by its 
randomised design and large national 
sample. The authors were able to compare 
the sample with the UK GP workforce,10 
which showed that the current sample 
were more likely to be salaried GPs, 
younger, and male. Recruitment was from 
an online panel, and not all UK GPs are 
affiliated with the company responsible. The 
response rate was low, which may further 
limit generalisability. Multiple barriers to 
prescribing tamoxifen were investigated, 
and therefore the possibility of a type I 
error is increased. The patient vignette 
was designed to be representative of a 
typical patient in this context, but specific 
characteristics may not match all patients. 
Similarly, the healthcare professional was 
described as a family history clinician, 
and attitudes towards prescribing may 
have been different if alternative clinical 
positions were described. The vignette was 
hypothetical, and prescribing behaviour 
may be different in a clinical setting. 
Comparison with existing literature
The authors’ previous qualitative work 
suggested that a shared care agreement 
between primary and secondary care would 
reduce ambiguity for prescribing, and 
encourage discussions about preventive 
therapy with high-risk patients.8 The 
current study’s data support this conclusion.

 Their earlier work also suggested GPs 
are concerned about the lack of licence 
for tamoxifen when used for prevention.8 
The survey responses showed that this is 
considered in the decision making of GPs, 
but other factors had a greater influence. 
Together, the interview and survey data 
help to explain why uptake of preventive 
therapy is lower in routine clinical settings 
compared with trial participation.6 
Implications for practice
Guidance for prescribing tamoxifen in 
Scotland has been produced,9 but there 
is no formal care pathway for the rest of 
the UK. Developing a pathway involving 
both primary and secondary care in a 
shared care agreement could substantially 
increase GPs’ willingness to prescribe. 
Although GPs may become more familiar 
with tamoxifen as a preventive agent over 
time, shared care agreements could form 
one facet of a longer-term implementation 
strategy. Consideration would, however, 
have to be given to the fact that genetic 
counsellors do not have prescribing rights, 
and therefore a supervising clinician would 
have to be responsible for prescribing in 
secondary care. The approach described 
is similar to the national prescribing policy 
developed within the Health Improvement 
Scotland guidance for tamoxifen.11 The 
authors recommend that NHS England, 
NHS Wales, and the Department of Health 
in Northern Ireland should replicate and 
adapt the Scottish guidelines. 
One 
of 
the 
major 
barriers 
to 
implementing the tamoxifen guidelines 
is the low awareness of its potential to 
be used as preventive therapy. Although 
cross-sectional surveys do not allow causal 
inferences, the data suggest increasing 
awareness of preventive medications could 
facilitate appropriate prescribing behaviour
. 
The most common sources of information 
were training days, GP magazines, and 
national guidelines. Strategies to promote 
awareness of tamoxifen for primary 
prevention should consider ways to target 
these sources. Providing an up-to-date and 
accurate source of information for GPs 
so they are prepared to have informed 
conversations with patients may reduce 
prescribing 
barriers. 
Although 
local 
decision aids are currently in use, a single 
national resource could ensure all patients 
are provided with the same information. 
Developing standardised pro-formas for 
secondary care clinicians to send to GPs 
when referring patients to discuss preventive 
therapy could be a useful strategy to 
improve GP awareness. These pro-formas 
could be adapted from those included in the 
Health Improvement Scotland guidelines.9 
These data suggest that encouraging GPs 
to consider the evidence for the benefits 
of the drug may encourage prescribing. 
Perceiving that patients may be lacking 
awareness of the harms and benefits of 
tamoxifen was also shown to be a barrier 
to prescribing among GPs. Highlighting 
that harms and benefits have already been 
communicated to the patient by a specialist 
may alleviate these concerns. 
These data suggest the lack of licence 
for tamoxifen is a factor in decision making, 
and is the most commonly reported 
barrier among those who are unwilling 
to prescribe. One strategy to overcome 
anxieties related to off-label prescribing is 
through acknowledgement in the British 
National Formulary (BNF). Although the 
BNF does not have the authority to license 
a medication, it frequently describes 
alternative unlicensed indications for 
medications. The authors suggest that 
primary prevention is listed as an indication 
for tamoxifen in the BNF for the appropriate 
patient groups.

Chemoprevention
We are interested in the use of chemoprevention drugs in the NHS. In this instance, chemoprevention is the use of medication to lower the risk of cancer in people not 
previously affected by the disease. We are particularly interested in chemoprevention using tamoxifen and aspirin. 
We have supplied some information below for you to read, with some follow-up questions. Please take your time to read this information. 
Tamoxifen: the essentials
NICE guidelines suggest women at high risk of breast cancer (≥30% lifetime risk) should be offered tamoxifen for primary prevention and clinicians should consider 
offering the drug to moderate-risk women (17–30% lifetime risk). Women would take tamoxifen for 5 years. Tamoxifen can reduce the risk of getting breast cancer 
among women at increased risk by at least one third. Women taking tamoxifen have an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolic events, and 
menopausal side effects. There is no generally accepted nationwide care pathway for prescribing tamoxifen for primary prevention. Tamoxifen will usually be discussed 
with patients in secondary care, and interested patients will typically be referred back to primary care. Tamoxifen is not licensed for a primary prevention indication, and 
therefore prescriptions are made off-label. 
Tamoxifen: the facts
Background
In 2013, NICE endorsed the use of tamoxifen as a therapeutic agent for women at increased risk of breast cancer because of a family history of the disease (see Clinical 
Guideline 164: Familial breast cancer: classification, care and managing breast cancer and related risks in people with a family history of breast cancer). The guidelines 
suggested that women at high risk of breast cancer (≥30% lifetime risk) should be offered tamoxifen, and that clinicians should consider offering tamoxifen to women 
at moderate risk of breast cancer (17–30% lifetime risk). Women initiating therapy would take the medication for up to 5 years. 
Benefits and harms
A meta-analysis of women at increased risk of breast cancer who were taking selective oestrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs) (the class of medication that includes 
tamoxifen) showed a relative risk reduction of 38% for breast cancer incidence. Women taking tamoxifen had a higher rate of endometrial cancer (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 2.18), venous thromboembolic events (HR = 1.60), and cataracts (HR = 1.10). Tamoxifen can also increase the likelihood of experiencing gynaecological, sexual, 
and vasomotor symptoms, as well as weight gain and headaches. 
Prescribing
There is no generally accepted nationwide care pathway for prescribing tamoxifen for primary prevention. Patients at increased risk of breast cancer will generally 
be seen in clinical genetics clinics, family history clinics, or breast cancer departments. The option of tamoxifen will be discussed in secondary care, and patients 
who are interested in taking tamoxifen will typically be referred back to primary care. Tamoxifen is not licensed for a primary prevention indication, and therefore all 
prescriptions have to be made off-label.
