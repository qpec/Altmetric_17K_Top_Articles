Autotransporters are the largest family of outer membrane and secreted proteins in Gram-
negative bacteria. Most autotransporters are localised to the bacterial surface where they
promote colonisation of host epithelial surfaces. Here we present the crystal structure of
UpaB, an autotransporter that is known to contribute to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) colo-
nisation of the urinary tract. We provide evidence that UpaB can interact with glycosami-
noglycans and host fibronectin. Unique modifications to its core β-helical structure create a
groove on one side of the protein for interaction with glycosaminoglycans, while the opposite
face can bind fibronectin. Our findings reveal far greater diversity in the autotransporter β-
helix than previously thought, and suggest that this domain can interact with host macro-
molecules. The relevance of these interactions during infection remains unclear.

 A
key factor in the establishment of infections by most
bacterial pathogens is their adherence to host epithelial
cells1,2. Autotransporters (ATs) are the largest group of
outer membrane and secreted proteins in bacteria and play
important roles in virulence, including promoting adhesion3.
ATs share a common domain organisation consisting of a
Sec-dependent signal sequence, a passenger or α-domain and a
C-terminal translocator β-domain4. The signal sequence and
β-domain are required for transport of the α-domain through the
inner and outer membranes, respectively. The α-domain is the
functional portion of the protein and can drive phenotypes
including cytotoxicity, aggregation, adhesion and/or invasion,
features that enhance bacterial virulence, colonisation, biofilm
formation, persistence and resistance to host innate defence
mechanisms3–5. In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, a
greater understanding of the mechanisms by which ATs augment
bacterial pathogenesis is required if we are to develop new
strategies to combat infections caused by multidrug-resistant
pathogens.
Despite the abundance of AT genes in the GenBank sequence
database and the importance of these proteins in bacterial
pathogenesis,
structural
information
about
AT
α-domains
remains limited. To date, only 11 α-domains and some small
fragments of trimeric ATs (a separate subfamily of ATs that are
obligate trimers6–8) have been structurally characterised, and
consequently, AT molecular mechanisms of action are largely
unknown.
Based on limited structural information, AT α-domains adopt
a general architecture comprising a long narrow right-handed β-
helix that is embellished with loops and/or other small domains
(e.g. trypsin-like domains) that confer different functional prop-
erties9–12. One of the best characterised ATs is the antigen 43
(Ag43) protein, which belongs to the largest and most diverse AT
subfamily, the AIDA-I type class13. Ag43 is the only member with
a known mechanism of action, whereby a head to tail dimerisa-
tion of Ag43 monomers on the surface of adjacent bacterial cells
promotes aggregation and biofilm formation via a molecular
‘velcro-like’ mechanism14–17.
The surface-exposed α-domains of different AIDA-I type ATs
exhibit extensive sequence variation13. An example of this is
represented
by UpaB
from
uropathogenic
Escherichia
coli
(UPEC), the major aetiologic agent of urinary tract infection and
a primary cause of sepsis18. UpaB is an AT that mediates UPEC
adherence to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and enhances
UPEC colonisation of the urinary tract19. Here we determine the
structure of UpaB at high resolution and reveal that it adopts a
unique architecture potentially comprising two distinct binding
sites. One binding site is formed by significant extensions to its
β-helix that form a groove that can interact with glycosami-
noglycans. On its opposite face, a second binding region can
interact with human fibronectin (FN) type III (FnIII). Our results
suggest that the AT β-helix may have diverse roles in addition to
acting as a structural scaffold5.
Results
Characterisation of UpaB reveals that it does not exhibit self-
association properties. AIDA-I-type ATs including Ag43, TibA
and AIDA-I belong to a group of self-associating ATs that pro-
mote bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation20. In the case of
Ag43, aggregation is mediated via a series of hydrogen bonds,
hydrophobic interactions and Van der Waals forces that drive a
head-to-tail dimersation of Ag43 monomers on the surface of
adjacent cells17. We previously showed that UpaB from the UPEC
reference strain CFT073 does not mediate cell aggregation when
overexpressed in E. coli laboratory strains19, but under certain
conditions, it may have a slight indirect effect on these pheno-
types21. UpaB is composed of an N-terminal signal sequence
(residues 1–37), an α-domain (residues 38–500) and a β-domain
(residues 501–776) (Fig. 1a). In order to understand the func-
tional properties of UpaB, we cloned, expressed and purified the
region encoding the UpaB α-domain (αUpaB) from UPEC
CFT073 and used analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation
velocity experiments to assess its propensity to self-associate in
solution. At 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mg ml−1, αUpaB produced a single
sedimentation
boundary
and
a
continuous
sedimentation-
coefficient distribution (c(s)) (Fig. 1b) to give a single species
with a standardised sedimentation coefficient of 3.1 s. Analysis by
continuous mass distribution (c(M)) gave a molecular weight of
approximately 52.7 kDa, consistent with a monomeric species.
Likewise, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of αUpaB at con-
centrations <2.7 mg ml−1 was consistent with a monodisperse
protein population (Supplementary Fig. 1), with the estimated
mass, radius of gyration (Rg) and the maximum linear dimension
(Dmax) from the experimental pair-distance distribution profile (p
(r)) yielding values close to what would be expected for a solution
of monomeric αUpaB (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, unlike the
α-domain of Ag43 (αAg43), recombinant αUpaB does not self-
associate. This fundamental difference in the functional proper-
ties of both proteins led us to determine the crystal structure of
αUpaB.
Overall UpaB structure. The αUpaB crystal structure was solved
to 1.9 Å resolution (crystallographic Rfactor of 17.5%; Rfree 21.8%).
The crystallographic refinement statistics are reported in Table 1.
The structure was solved from a xenon derivative by single iso-
morphous replacement with anomalous scattering. One molecule
of αUpaB was found in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure
of αUpaB exhibited a right-handed three-stranded β-helix con-
sisting of 13 turns (Fig. 1c), with each triangular turn containing
three faces, F1, F2 and F3 faces (Fig. 1d). The β-helix is pre-
dominantly stabilised by an inter-strand network of hydrogen
bonds. The interior of the β-helix is packed mostly by long stacks
of aliphatic residues (Fig. 1e), whereas the exterior is largely acidic
in nature. At the C-terminus of the β-helix, αUpaB forms a two-
stranded β-sandwich that is capped by a three-stranded β-
meander motif. This latter region resembles the autochaperone
region that is required for the folding of AT α-domains on the cell
surface22. A DALI structural alignment revealed that αUpaB
shared only a low resemblance to other AT structures in the PDB,
with highest similarity to the Bordetella pertussis pertactin AT
(PDB 1DAB); (18% sequence identity, Z-score 24.5 and r.m.s.d of
2.8 Å between 358 equivalent Cα atoms) (Fig. 1f). Compared to
αAg43, αUpaB shares only 12% sequence identity, Z-score 14.6 and
r.m.s.d of 3.8 Å between 242 equivalent Cα atoms (Fig. 1g).
Further comparison with other ATs9–12,17 revealed the αUpaB
β-helix is wider and shorter with a total length of 75 Å. However,
the most striking feature of the αUpaB β-helix is the extended
β-strands within turns 6–10, which reach up to 32 Å in length. In
addition, the strands linking turns 2–3, 3–4, 4–5 and 5–6 are
lengthened into a consecutive series of large loops. To date, these
structural features have not been observed in the α-domain of any
other AT protein23.
UpaB can bind glycosaminoglycans. The β-strand extensions
contributed by turns 6–10 and the long loops protruding between
turns 2–6 form a long hydrophilic groove 11 Å wide and 12.5 Å
deep on the F1 face of αUpaB (Fig. 2a, b). Sidechains from E165,
S188, N189, Q197, T230 and E293 protrude into the groove and
largely determine its slightly acidic nature. The results of the
DALI search using αUpaB were further analysed to define a role

 for its groove and revealed that UpaB shared low structural
similarity to polysaccharide degrading enzymes (1BHE, 5GKD,
4C2L), which are also composed of a β-helix with a prominent
groove for binding polysaccharides24–26. The αUpaB groove most
closely resembled the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) lyase chon-
droitinase B (PDB 1OFL) from Pedobacter heparinus27 (8%
sequence identity, Z-score 16.5 and r.m.s.d of 3.3 Å) (Fig. 2c).
Chondroitinase B is the closest homolog known to interact with
human
polysaccharides.
Importantly,
αUpaB
shares
a
putative active site with chondroitinase B and other GAG lyases,
located just outside the groove (Fig. 2c). This site comprises UpaB
Lys 256 and Lys 343 situated in similar positions to chon-
droitinase B Lys250/Arg271 Brønsted base/acid pair required to
break the glycosidic bonds of GAGs28. In chondroitinase B and
other GAG lyases, the Lys250/Arg271 would be situated proximal
to a bound calcium ion required for neutralisation of the GAG
carboxylic group during bond cleavage. Indeed, we identified
electron density associated with the αUpaB lysine pair likely to be a
bound calcium (Supplementary Fig. 2). Similar to other lyases,
this calcium ion would be held in place by the neighbouring
αUpaB Glu 314 and Asn 316 residues. The likelihood of a GAG
binding within the UpaB groove was tested using docking
simulations (Fig. 2a). A model of a GAG was constructed and
docked into the αUpaB groove using Autodock Vina. All of the
docking conformations showed an interaction with the αUpaB
groove, with one of the top conformations displaying an inter-
action with the putative lyase active site resembling a pre-cleavage
state (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This binding conformation
exhibited a significant predicted binding affinity of −9.4 kcal mol
−1 (free energy of binding), based on an extensive hydrogen
bonding network between the GAG hydroxyl groups and a
number of polar residues within and around the αUpaB groove.
This investigation was followed by the screening of αUpaB
against 2788 compounds (including 88 carbohydrate molecules)
in a fluorescence thermal shift-based assay (Fig. 2d). Significant
binding was shown to two ‘GAG-like’ molecules, Tn Antigen
GalN-α1-O-Ser and lacto-N-neohexaose (Fig. 2d). GalN-α1-O-
Ser closely resembles the O-glycosidic-linked saccharide to serine

 complex that anchors most GAGs to their core proteins, and the
lacto-N-neohexaose is representative of a main chain GAG29. The
role of the UpaB groove in this binding was shown by repeating
this assay with a UpaB mutant (αUpaB_G1), designed by alanine
substitutions to the prominent residues that stabilise the GAG
interaction identified in our molecular docking studies (E165A,
N189A, Q197A, N200A, Q203A, K256A and N316A). Although
we confirmed that these alterations did not affect the secondary
structure of αUpaB_G1 (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and αUpaB-G1
behaved in solution similar to the native protein (Supplementary
Fig. 3b), this mutant was unable to bind the ‘GAG-like’ molecules
as shown by the overlapping melting curve plots of αUpaB-G1 in
the presence and absence of the GAGs (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Further analyses revealed that αUpaB did not display a broad
affinity for some common GAGs found in the urinary tract
including chondroitin sulfate A, B, C and heparin sulfate29,30
(Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5).
Overall, these results show that αUpaB can bind GAG-like
molecules and that this binding is lost when we mutate the GAG-
binding site. Our data also indicate that αUpaB may display a
considerable substrate specificity (chemical library screening
identified only two ‘GAG-like’ molecules out of 2788 compounds
and we did not observe binding to four polysaccharides found in
the urinary tract) and therefore may interact with a limited range
of GAGs that we are yet to identify.

Binding to fibronectin by αUpaB_G1 (E165A, N189A, Q197A, N200A, Q203A, K256A and N316A) was also tested. Alteration of the surface acidic patch S1
abolished the ability of UpaB to bind fibronectin. Data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicates

 UpaB contains a FN-binding site. In addition to GAG con-
taining proteoglycans, the epithelium is comprised of many other
glycoproteins including ECM components31. E. coli expressing
UpaB was previously found to bind these ECM proteins9. We
examined this further by testing the ability of purified αUpaB to
bind human FN, laminin and fibrinogen (Fig. 3a). αUpaB bound
strongest to FN, and thus we focussed on understanding this
interaction at the molecular level. Using surface plasmon reso-
nance (SPR) we determined a dissociation constant (KD) of 45.2
± 1.4 μM between UpaB and FN (Fig. 3b), with the latter
immobilised to a CM5 sensor chip using the standard coupling
procedure32. Although the determined KD may be somewhat
underestimated
owing
to
the
restricted
conformational
flexibility of the immobilised FN, this binding affinity is con-
sistent with other bacterial FN-binding proteins (including a Fn
type
III-binding
protein)33–35.
This
affinity
is
also
comparable with other physiologically important protein–protein
interactions
that
mediate
cell–cell
contacts
(i.e.,
T
cell
receptor–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes
range from 2 to 112 μM KD36). Importantly, this binding would
not be in the context of a single protein–protein interaction but
rather the expression of multiple copies of UpaB on the bacterial
cell surface would further enhance the bacterial binding efficiency
to FN.
Unlike many other bacterial FN-binding proteins (FnBPs),
UpaB does not possess a characteristic GGXXXXV(E/D)(F/I)XX
(D/E)T(Xx15)EDT
FN-binding
repeat
(FnBR)
sequence37.
Therefore, to determine the region of αUpaB that binds FN, we
generated a series of αUpaB mutants with specific deletions in β-
strand turns, followed by overexpression and purification of the
corresponding proteins (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Testing of the
mutant proteins for their capacity to bind human FN revealed
that deletion of the region encompassing the extended β-strands
in turns 6–10 (αUpaB-Δt6–10) resulted in a significant reduction in
binding
to
FN
(Fig.
3c).
Further
analysis
involving
the
progressive deletion of pairs of β-strand turns from the αUpaB
N-terminus through the extended β-strand region, generating
αUpaB-Δt1–2, αUpaB-Δt3–4, αUpaB-Δt5–6 and αUpaB-Δt7–8, demon-
strated that the highest loss in FN binding was caused by deletion
of turns 3–8. As such, most of the region encompassing the β-
strand extensions comprises the primary site for binding FN. The
secondary structure of the deletion mutant that was least affected
(αUpaB-Δt1–2) and most affected (αUpaB-Δt5–6) to binding FN was
confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Finally, the same mutations were also generated in the
full-length UpaB protein, thereby enabling us to assess its
capacity to mediate binding to FN upon translocation to the E.
coli
cell
surface.
These
UpaB
deletion
mutants,
when
expressed with their β-domain transporter, were all translocated
to the cell surface, as confirmed by whole-cell enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using polyclonal UpaB antibody
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). Subsequent whole-cell ELISA experi-
ments revealed that E. coli expressing these UpaB mutant
proteins bound to FN in a manner consistent with the results
obtained using purified recombinant proteins (Supplementary
Fig. 7b).
To determine the specific site within turns 3–8 of αUpaB that
interacted with FN, we initially investigated the GAG-binding
groove on the F1 face, as it was the most prominent structural
feature within this region. Utilising our αUpaB_G1 GAG-binding
mutant, along with other mutants containing amino acid
substitutions of hydrophobic (αUpaB_G2) and acidic (αUpaB_G3)
residues within the groove, we found that these regions had no
effect on FN binding as determined by ELISA (Fig. 3d). We next
examined the other αUpaB faces for possible sites that could bind
FN. We made amino acid substitutions to a predominantly acidic
patch (αUpaB_S1) and polar region (αUpaB_S2) on the F2 face and a
hydrophobic patch (αUpaB_S3) between the F2 and F3 faces
(Fig. 3d).
Substitution of residues D116, D119, N146, N175, D217, K245,
D246, D281, R310 and D336 on the F2 face to alanine (αUpaB_S1)
caused almost complete loss of FN binding as determined by
ELISA, while maintaining the correct secondary structure of
αUpaB_S1 based on circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 3a) and displaying a behaviour in solution
similar that of the native protein (Supplementary Fig. 3b). This
result mapped the FN-binding site to a ladder of charged/polar
residues that are contributed from β-strands or loops in
consecutive rungs of the αUpaB β-helix. The only established
mode of interaction between FnBPs and FN involves the donation
of a series of structurally disordered FnBPs to FN, which upon
binding each form an additional β-strand within type I FN
modules37,38. Thus the αUpaB–FN interaction is unique, with
interacting residues contributed from already formed β-strands
held tightly within the αUpaB β-helix by a hydrogen-bonding
network.
UpaB can bind FN type III. In order to further investigate the
atypical mode of interaction between UpaB and FN, we deter-
mined the region of FN bound by αUpaB. FN is composed of 12
type I modules (FnI), 2 type II modules (FnII) and 15–17 type
III modules (FnIII)38. We obtained commercially available
fragments of human FN which included a 45 kDa gelatin-
binding fragment (FnI6–9, FnII1–2), a 70 kDa heparin/gelatin-
binding fragment (FnI1–9, FnII1–2), a 120 kDa cell-binding
fragment (FnIII2–11) and a 40 kDa C-terminal heparin-binding
fragment (FnIII12–15)32 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6b). The
binding of αUpaB to these FN fragments determined by ELISA
revealed that it displayed strongest interaction with the cell
binding fragment (FnIII2–11) and weak binding to the gelatin
(FnI6–9, FnII1–2) and heparin/gelatin (FnI1–9, FnII1–2) frag-
ments (Fig. 4b). Given the size of UpaB, this maps its binding
site on FN to the first FnIII units in the cell-binding fragment,
possibly also including some interaction with the neighbouring
FnI units in the gelatin-binding fragment (note that the gelatin
[FnI6–9, FnII1–2] and heparin/gelatin [FnI1–9, FnII1–2] frag-
ments overlap in this region). The difference observed between
UpaB binding to full-length FN compared to its fragments
could be attributed to the lack of the FnIII1 unit within any of
the commercially available fragments, which given its location
would be an important contribution to the UpaB–Fn interac-
tion. FnIII1–2 are valid targets for bacterial pathogens such as
UPEC, as these 2 units are known to be involved in FN matrix
assembly, whereby their disruption could facilitate bacterial
spread39.
Bacterial interactions with FnIII are uncommon; most of the
100 known bacterial FnBPs bind to the FnI heparin- and gelatin-
binding domains via a β-zipper interaction38 (Fig. 4c). However,
there are an increasing number of bacterial proteins including
Haemophilus
influenzae
Hap40,
Staphylococcus
epidermidis
Embp41, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ShdA42 and
Pasteurella multocida PM166532 that bind to FnIII. The AT Hap
(13% sequence identity) also primarily binds to FnIII1–2 via four
small binding motifs. These motifs are absent in UpaB and both
the UpaB and Hap FN-binding sites do not share the same
location.
Overall, the structural basis for how bacterial proteins interact
with the FnIII fragment of FN has not been determined, and thus
we investigated this interaction using molecular dynamics
simulations with our αUpaB crystal structure and the structure
of human FnIII1–2 (2HA1)39 (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Movie 1).

 To visualise this interaction, we also ran simulations with the

FN
(Supplementary Movie 2). Modelling simulations were performed
using NAMD 2.1243 for a cumulative total of 1.2 μs for each
system (3 replicates of 400 ns each). Though the simulations are
too short in timescale terms of protein–protein interactions to
demonstrate specific binding, they do provide plausible binding
mechanisms, showing that αUpaB could interact with FnIII via
complementary charged residues without unfolding and/or
donating β-strands. Specifically, our αUpaB-FnIII1–2 simulations
indicate that αUpaB primarily interacts with FnIII1, through
hydrogen bond interactions mediated by αUpaB D246, R310,
D336 and D375 residues with complementary charged areas on
FnIII, particularly residues K32, K40, E70, R36 and of FnIII1.
Substitutions of the αUpaB FnIII-interacting residues to alanine in
the αUpaB_S1 mutant greatly reduced hydrogen bond interactions
observed in the simulations (Supplementary Movie 2). β-Helix–β-
helix interactions have been observed previously for Ag43 and
some trimeric ATs17,44,45. However, these studies show how an
AT β-helix can interact with another type of fold, namely the β-
sandwich fold of FnIII.
UpaB is highly conserved and immunogenic during UPEC
infection. To determine whether the structural features of UpaB
required for binding FnIII and GAGs are conserved across the E.
coli species, we screened the NCBI public database and an in-
house collection, which were represented by 2818 draft and 199
complete E. coli genome sequences. Overall, the upaB gene was
present in 1019 strains in this collection (34%) and was found in
UPEC strains as well as intestinal pathogenic, commensal and
other extra-intestinal pathogenic strains. Analysis of these 1019
translated UpaB amino acid sequences revealed that 95% (968/
1019) shared an amino acid sequence identity >89%. Comparison
of the translated UpaB amino acid sequence from seven com-
pletely sequenced UPEC strains showed that the putative GAG
lyase active site was strictly conserved; there was also high con-
servation of the residues that contribute to the acidic groove, as
well as the residues that interact with FnIII (Supplementary

 Fig. 8). We also examined whether an immunological response
against UpaB was elicited during human UPEC infection and
showed that plasma samples from urosepsis patients infected with
UpaB-positive E. coli strains produced significantly higher anti-
αUpaB antibody titres compared to healthy individuals (Supple-

Relevance of GAG and FN-binding regions in vivo. We pre-
viously showed that mutation of upaB in CFT073 led to decreased
bladder colonisation in experimental mice19. In order to examine
how the GAG- and FN-binding properties of UpaB impact its
function in vivo, we constructed plasmids containing the S1, G1
and double S1–G1 mutations in the full-length upaB gene. These
plasmids
were
transformed
into
our
upaB
mutant
strain
(CFT073upaB) to generate a set of strains with plasmid pSU2718
(vector control), pUpaB (wild-type (WT) UpaB), pUpaBG1
(UpaB with mutated GAG-binding site), pUpaBS1 (UpaB with
mutated FN-binding site) or pUpaBG1, S1 (UpaB with mutated
GAG- and FN-binding sites). Next, we examined the capacity of
our CFT073upaB complemented strains to colonise the mouse
bladder. In these experiments, CFT073upaB complemented with
pUpaB, pUpaBG1 and pUpaBS1 restored bladder colonisation at
24 h post-infection to a level equivalent to colonisation by WT
CFT073 (Fig. 5). In contrast, complementation with either the
vector control plasmid pSU2718 or pUpaBG1, S1 did not restore
bladder colonisation to WT levels, and these levels were sig-
nificantly reduced at 24 h post-infection compared to colonisation
by CFT073upaB containing pUpaB, pUpaBG1 or pUpaBS1
(Fig. 5). This lack of complementation by pUpaBG1, S1 was not
due to lack of expression of the mutant protein on the cell surface,
as demonstrated by western blot analysis and whole-cell ELISA
(Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). The stability of the pUpaBG1,S1
mutant was also confirmed by purification and biophysical
characterisation of recombinant αUpaB_G1,S1 (Supplementary
Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 10c). A similar colonisation
profile was observed for each of the UPEC strains in the urine of
these experimentally infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 10d).
Discussion
AT adhesins are a common group of proteins that play a central
role in bacterial pathogenesis. They allow bacteria to adhere to
human cells, aggregate with other bacteria and form biofilms, all
key facilitators of bacterial virulence. Currently, our under-
standing of the function of ATs is limited, and detailed infor-
mation at the level of atomic structure as well as the precise
molecular mechanisms that govern their interaction with target
molecules is lacking. Here we describe the structure and
mechanism of action for UpaB, a recently described AT adhesin
from UPEC.
UpaB differs from other characterised AIDA-I AT adhesins as
it does not self-associate. Self-association of AIDA-I ATs on the
bacterial cell surface is the mechanism by which AIDA-I ATs
promote bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation17. The lack
of this feature in UpaB is consistent with previous studies which
showed that UpaB overexpression did not impact on these
phenotypes19,46. Subsequent determination of the αUpaB structure
revealed an unprecedented departure from the common β-helix
fold previously determined for all other ATs and led to the
definition of several novel features in the architecture of UpaB.
Extensions of β-strands within αUpaB together with large loops
create a long acidic groove that can bind GAG. This site bears
structural similarity to characterised GAG lyases28 and promoted
the binding of UpaB to GAG-‘like’ substrates, thus supporting a
potential polysaccharide-binding site in an AT protein.
We also show that UpaB can bind to human FN. Using a series
of UpaB mutants in combination with different fragments of FN,
we showed that this occurs via interaction with type III FN, most
likely at FnIII1–2. Despite human FN being one of the most
common targets for bacterial adhesins, a detailed mechanistic
description of the structural basis for binding to FnIII is
lacking32,38,40–42. In UpaB, this interaction involves the folded
UpaB β-helix presenting a ladder of charged/polar residues that
interact with complementary charges on FnIII. This is in contrast
to previously characterised FnBP–FN interactions, which occur
through the donation of a series of disordered repeats from the
FnBP to form a tandem β-zipper interaction with consecutive FnI
domains37,47. This mode of UpaB binding to FnIII might also be
utilised by other bacterial proteins that bind FnIII. Indeed,
binding interactions involving β-helices have been increasingly
observed among ATs and other proteins17,44,45.
Our previous work showed that deletion of upaB reduces
UPEC colonisation of the mouse bladder19. The in vivo data we
present here show that mutating either the GAG-binding site or
the FN-binding site does not affect UPEC colonisation, while
mutating both binding sites leads to a modest decrease in colo-
nisation. One possible interpretation of these results would be
that UPEC colonisation may be facilitated by UpaB binding to
both GAG and FN. However, it is possible that the multiple
mutations required to inactivate both binding domains may have
altered the stability or other functional features of the UpaB
protein. Therefore, further work is needed to clarify the potential
relevance of UpaB binding to GAG and FN during infection.

 Cloning, expression and purification of αUpaB. The coding sequence for the upaB
alpha domain (residues 38–500, locus tag c0426) was PCR-amplified from UPEC
CFT073 genomic DNA using primers 4326-UpaB-F and 4327-UpaB-R containing
ligation-independent cloning (LIC) overhangs (Supplementary Table 2). Using LIC
cloning, the amplified gene was inserted into a modified version of a pMCSG717
vector, which encodes a N-terminal his6-tag followed by a thioredoxin (TRX)
domain and a TEV protease cleavage site. The resulting plasmid, pUpaBα, was used
for the expression of αUpaB and introduces three residues at the N-terminus (i.e.
SNA) upon removal of the his6-TRX-tag with TEV. The αUpaB protein was
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Invitrogen) using autoinduction (24 h
at 30 °C) in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics (ampicillin 100 μg ml−1,
chloramphenicol 34 μg ml−1). Cells were harvested, resuspended in 25 mM Tris pH
7.5 and 150 mM NaCl and lysed by cell sonication. The lysate was cleared by
centrifugation and loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were
eluted in a gradient of 0–500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing αUpaB were
cleaved with TEV protease and the uncleaved protein was removed by further
nickel affinity chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S-75 GE
Healthcare) in 25 mM Hepes and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.0, was used to further purify
αUpaB as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE).
The pαUpaB plasmid was used as the parent vector for the construction of all
αUpaB mutants, namely αUpaB-Δt6–10, αUpaB-Δt1–2, αUpaB-Δt3–4, αUpaB-Δt5–6, αUpaB-
Δt7–8, αUpaB-G1, αUpaB-G2, αUpaB-G3, αUpaB-S1, αUpaB-S2, αUpaB-S3 and
αUpaB-G1,S1 (Supplementary Table 2). All constructs were generated by Epoch Life
Science, confirmed by sequencing and transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysS
(Supplementary Table 2). The αUpaB mutants were expressed and purified as
described for the native αUpaB.
Crystallisation. Crystals of αUpaB were grown at 20 °C using the hanging-drop
vapour-diffusion technique. Crystals grew at 20 mg ml−1 in 0.1 M sodium acetate
pH 4.8, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 28% (w/v) PEG 4000. Crystals pre-
equilibrated in reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol were flash-cooled in
liquid nitrogen. Xenon derivatisation was performed using a Xenon chamber
(Hampton Research) at 20 bar for 1 min before flash freezing.
Structure determination and refinement. Native data were collected (λ = 0.954,
−163 °C) from a single crystal with an ADSC Q315r CCD detector on the MX2
micro-crystallography beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. The data were
integrated and scaled with HKL200048. Anomalous data were collected (λ = 1.3776,
−163 °C) from 2 crystals at the MX2 beamline. This data was integrated, scaled and
merged using XDS/XSCALE49. All crystals belonged to spacegroup P3121 with
similar cell dimensions of a ≈ 69 Å, b ≈ 69 Å, c ≈ 166 Å and α = 90.0°, β = 90.0° and
γ = 120.0°. This was consistent with one αUpaB molecule per asymmetric unit. The
structure of αUpaB was determined by single isomorphous replacement using
anomalous signal from Xenon. SHELX C,D,E50 was used to find the Xenon atoms,
phasing and density modification. Eight Xenon atoms were found per asymmetric
unit. ARP/wARP51 was used for initial model building against the experimental
phases. This model underwent rounds of manual model building using the pro-
gram COOT52 and refinement using Refmac553 and phenix.refine54 to 1.97 Å using
native data. The quality of the model was monitored during refinement by the
Rfree value, which represented 5% of the data. The structure was validated by the
MolProbity55 server and the figures were created with PyMOL56. Ramachandran
statistics showed 97.87% of residues in the most favoured region and 2.13% in the
allowed regions. Details of data-processing statistics and final refinement values are
summarised in Table 1.
Analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were per-
formed in a Beckman Coulter model XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with a An50-Ti
rotor. Double-sector quartz cells were loaded with 400 μl of buffer (25 mM Tris pH
7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) and 380 μl αUpaB at 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mg ml−1. Initial scans
were performed at 725 × g to determine the optimal wavelength and radial posi-
tions. Absorbance readings were collected at 280 nm and 128,794 × g. at 20 °C.
Solvent density, solvent viscosity and estimates of the partial specific volume of
αUpaB (0.7203 ml g−1) at 20 °C were calculated with SEDNTERP57. Data were
analysed using c(s) and c(M) with SEDFIT58.
SAXS data collection and analysis. Data were collected on the SAXS–WAXS
beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. Serial dilutions of a 2.7 mg ml−1 stock
were made to give samples with concentrations between ~0.1 and 2.7 mg ml−1. All
samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g prior to being loaded into a 96-well plate. To
minimise the effects of radiation damage, samples (~80 μl) were maintained at 283
K and drawn into a capillary from the 96-well plate and flowed past the beam. All
measured two-dimensional data were averaged and corrected for transmission,
solvent scattering and detector sensitivity and radially averaged to produce I(q) vs.
q profiles using Scatterbrain (v 2.7.1).
The estimated molecular masses were calculated using values for contrast and
partial specific volume predicted from the protein sequence using MULCh (v 1.1)59
along with the Porod volume. Data processing and Guinier analysis was performed
using Primus (v 3.2)60. The pair-distance distribution function, p(r), was generated
from the experimental data using GNOM (v 4.6)61, from which I(0), Rg and Dmax
were determined.
The program CORAL (v 1.1)62 was used to generate 16 rigid-body models of the
protein, where the missing N- and C-terminal residues from the crystal structure
(PDB: 6BEA) were modelled as dummy residues. All models were qualitatively
similar, and the model with the lowest χ2 was chosen as the representative structure.
The program DAMMIN (v 5.3)63 was used to generate 16 molecular envelopes,
which were averaged and filtered using the program DAMAVER (v 2.8)64. The
SAXS data and models have been deposited in the SASBDB65.
Polysaccharide lyase assay and gel. Polysaccharide lyase assays were performed
with human chondroitin sulfate A/C (Sigma), human chondroitin sulfate B (Sigma)
or human heparin sulfate (Sigma) at 0.5 mg ml−1 in 100 mM Tris 50 mM sodium
acetate pH 8.0 and 10 mM CaCl2 to final volume of 100 μl. Purified αUpaB was
added to a final concentration of 0.05 mg ml−1 along with the negative control
Antigen 43, with the positive control chondroitin lyase ABC (Sigma) used at 0.005
mg ml−1. Assays were set-up in 96-well microplates (UV-Star Greiner) and sub-
strate cleavage was followed by A232 measurements every 4 min for 2 h at 37 °C,
using an EnSpire 2300 multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer). Assay samples were then
analysed by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) with Alician Blue/Silver staining.
ELISA of glycosaminoglycans, FN, laminin or fibrinogen with αUpaB. ELISAs of
the glycosaminoglycans human chondroitin sulfate A, B, C and heparin sulfate
were performed by coating the molecules onto Nunc Maxisorp flat-bottom 96-well
plates (Thermo Scientific) at 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg ml−1. Plates were blocked with 1%
w/v bovine serum albumin and probed with 10 µg ml−1 of αUpaB. The binding of
αUpaB was detected using a UpaB-specific polyclonal antibody (1 in 500 dilution in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS))19 followed by alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1 in 10,000 dilution in PBS (Sigma A3687)). For human laminin
(10 µg ml−1, Sigma), human fibrinogen (10 µg ml−1, Sigma) and full-length human
FN (10 µg ml−1, Sigma), ELISAs were performed in the same manner. To detect
binding to immobilised UpaB or UpaB mutants, ELISA plates were coated with
purified αUpaB, truncates or αUpaB surface/groove mutants (10 µg ml−1) and probed
with 10 µg ml−1 each of full-length human FN or FN fragments; including the
gelatin-binding (Sigma), heparin/gelatin (Sigma), cell-binding (Merck Millipore) or
C-terminal heparin-binding (Merck Millipore) α-chymotryptic FN fragments. The
binding of FN and FN fragments was detected using anti-FN antibody (1 in 1000
dilution in PBS (Sigma F3648)) followed by alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1 in 10,000 dilution in PBS (Sigma A3687)). The reaction was
developed in the presence of alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma) and absor-
bance was read at 405 nm.
Fluorescence thermal shift assays. Fluorescence thermal shift assay was con-
ducted in 384-well plate format with an assay volume of 10 µl. Recombinant αUpaB
protein sample and 5000× Sypro-Orange (Invitrogen) were diluted and mixed in a
Hepes buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) to a protein concentration of
0.5 µg per well and 5× Sypro-Orange. Because of the low signal intensity of αUpaB,
higher than usual protein concentration was used. After adding the protein Sypro-
Orange mix to a PCR plate, testing compounds were added using a Labcyte
Echo550 acoustic liquid transfer robot. Plates were mixed, sealed with optical clear
plastic seal and centrifuged. Thermal scanning coupled with fluorescence detection
was performed on a CFX384 qPCR machine at 1.5 °C min−1 from 10 °C to 85 °C.
Data analysis was performed using the in-house software excelFTS, which uses
IDBS XLfit for fitting the fluorescence data to a Boltzmann function to determine
the melting temperature Tm and other thermal transition parameters. Two com-
pound libraries of 2700 molecules and 88 molecules each were screened with αUpaB.
No hit compounds were found from the 2700 molecule Spectrum collection of
known and experimental drugs and natural products (MicroSource Discovery).
The screen of 88 carbohydrates yielded two hits.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy. An Aviv model 420 Circular Dichroism Spec-
trometer was used to investigate the structural properties of αUpaB proteins at 0.3
mg ml−1 in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Wavelength scans were
performed with 0.5 nm steps between 200 to 250 nm at 20 °C.
ELISA of whole cells expressing UpaB with FN. Full-length upaB from UPEC
CFT073 was cloned into plasmid pSU2718 at XbaI-HindIII restriction sites with
primers 6460-UpaBF1 and 6461-UpaBR (Supplementary Table 2). The resultant
parent plasmid (pUpaB) was used for construction of all UpaB deletion mutants
used in this study (Supplementary Table 2). Specific mutations and deletions were
introduced into upaB by Epoch Life Science to generate the following plasmids
[pUpaBG1, pUpaBS1, pUpaBΔt1–2, pUpaBΔt3–4, pUpaBΔt5–6 and pUpaBΔt7–8]. All
constructs were confirmed by sequencing and transformed into MS427 (Supple-
mentary Table 2). For all assays, overnight cultures of bacterial cells were nor-
malised to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm) of 1.0. Whole-cell ELISAs were
performed as described for purified UpaB proteins. Whole-cell ELISAs for the
detection of UpaB and UpaB deletion mutants on the E. coli cell surface were
performed using polyclonal anti-αUpaB antibody (1 in 500 dilution in PBS) and
detected using alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 in 10,000

 dilution in PBS (Sigma A3687)). The interaction of UpaB deletion mutants with FN
was examined by whole-cell ELISA using anti-FN antibody (1 in 1000 dilution in
PBS (Sigma F3648)) and detected using alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit IgG (1 in 10,000 dilution in PBS (Sigma A3687)).
SPR measurements. A Biacore T200 biosensor instrument was used to measure
the affinity of the interaction of UpaB with full-length human FN. FN was cova-
lently immobilised onto a CM5 chip at two different densities, 1000 RU and 5000
RU, using amine coupling method. SPR experiments were performed at 25 °C using
PBS-T (1× PBS pH 7.4 and 0.05% Tween 20) as the running buffer. To generate
binding data, UpaB at concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.8 µM was injected over
immobilised FN at a constant flow rate of 90 ml min−1 for 50 s; UpaB dissociation
was monitored by flowing running buffer at 90 ml min−1 for 150 s. The surface was
regenerated after each cycle by injecting 0.1% SDS. Steady-state equilibrium ana-
lysis was carried out using the Biacore T200 evaluation software. KD is expressed as
mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Experiments were conducted on three
independent occasions with fresh immobilisation.
Mouse infections. Plasmids containing the full-length upaB gene with mutations
in the GAG-binding site (pUpaBG1), FN-binding site (pUpaBS1) and both binding
sites (pUpaBG1, S1) were generated by Epoch Life Science. These plasmids, together
with a plasmid containing the full-length upaB gene (pUpaB) and the vector
control (pSU2718), were transformed into CFT073upaB, respectively, to generate
the strains used in the mouse UTI model. Female C57BL/6 mice aged 10–12 weeks
(Animal Resources Centre) were inoculated by transurethral infection to deliver
approximately 108 bacteria to the bladder, as described elsewhere66. Briefly, mice
(n = 10 per group) were anaesthetised by inhalation exposure to isoflurane and a
sterile Teflon-coated catheter attached to a 1 ml syringe was used to deliver 50 µl of
PBS containing ~108 colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria (at a rate of 5 µl s−1)
to the bladder. Urine samples were collected 24 h after challenge and were diluted
in PBS and plated on LB agar or LB agar supplemented with 30 µg ml−1 chlor-
amphenicol, as appropriate, for colony counts. Subsequently, the mice were
euthanised (using isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation), and the
bladders and kidneys were collected, weighed and homogenised in sterile PBS. The
tissue homogenates were diluted and plated on agar as above to quantify c.f.u. per
0.1 g tissue. Data are compiled from at least two independent experiments.
ELISA to detect anti-αUpaB antibodies from urosepsis patients. Blood plasma
was collected from 45 patients presenting with urosepsis at the Princess Alexandra
Hospital (Brisbane, Australia) along with matching blood culture UPEC isolates.
Isolates were screened for the presence of upaB, resulting in 33 plasma samples
with matching infecting strains positive for upaB to be assessed. Forty-two plasma
samples from healthy volunteers were obtained as controls. Recombinant UpaB α-
domain (αUpaB; 10 µg ml−1) was coated onto Nunc Maxisorp flat-bottom 96-well
plates (Thermo Scientific), plasma samples were added and peroxidase-conjugated
anti-human IgG (1:30,000 dilution in 5% skim milk (Sigma A0170)) was applied as
a secondary antibody for detection (incubated at 37 °C for 90 min). Plates were
developed with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine with absorbance determined using a
SpectraMax 190 Absorbance Microplate Reader at 450 nm. Statistical analysis
between patient and healthy plasma was performed using an unpaired two-sample
t test.
Sequence analysis. The upaB sequences from the NCBI database and in house
collection were compared and aligned using CLC Main Workbench (Qiagen).
Modelling. Models for dynamics simulations were constructed for both αUpaB and
αUpaB_S1 using the UpaB crystal structure and the FnIII1–2 crystal structure
(2HA1). UpaB models were positioned approximately 10 Å from the FN fragment
and solvated with TIP3P and electrically neutralised with 0.15 M sodium chloride.
The models initial dimensions of 108 × 81 × 120 Å, contained 100,010 and 100,015,
atoms respectively. Each model was run independently 3 times for 400 ns, per-
formed with NAMD2.12 34, for a cumulative total of 2.4 µs of simulation. Simu-
lations were performed with NAMD2.1243. Long-range Coulomb forces were
computed with the Particle Mesh Ewald method with a grid spacing of 1 Å. Two-fs
timesteps were used with non-bonded interactions calculated every 2 fs and full
electrostatics every 4 fs while hydrogens were constrained with the SHAKE algo-
rithm. The cut-off distance was 12 Å with a switching distance of 10 Å and a pair-
list distance of 14 Å. The temperature was set to 310 K. Pressure was controlled to
1 atmosphere using the Nosé–Hoover Langevin piston method employing a piston
period of 100 fs and a piston decay of 50 fs. Trajectory frames were captured every
100 ps. Simulation trajectories were viewed and mapped with VMD67.
Docking of the GAG into UpaB utilised a model based on the NMR structure of
unsulfated chrondroitin (PDB: 2KQO). Docking of the GAG model was performed
against the UpaB structure using Autodock Vina68. A 52 × 24 × 46 Å search space
was set up to cover the UpaB surface and groove. Standard chemical bond torsions
were applied to the GAG molecule and UpaB was kept rigid apart from the
following residues: N189, Q197, K256, and K343. Docking conformations were
ranked against the predicted free energy of binding (kcal mol−1).
Ethics statement. All animal experimentation was conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Griffith
University Animal Ethics Committee approved this study (MSC/01/18/AEC). The
use of human blood plasma from patients was approved by the institutional review
board of the Princess Alexandra Hospital (2008/264). The need for patient
informed consent was waived, as the primary purpose for the collection of these
samples was for other diagnostic procedures, and all patient information was de-
identified. The collection of human blood from control subjects was approved by
the institutional review board of Griffith University (MSC/18/10/HREC). Informed
consent was obtained from all control subjects.
