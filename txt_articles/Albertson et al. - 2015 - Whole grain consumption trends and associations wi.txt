Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study was (1) to describe intakes of total grain and whole grain in the United
States over the past 12 years and major dietary sources, and (2) to determine the relationship between whole grain
intake and adiposity measures for children and adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional dietary data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
2001–12 (6 2-year cycles) for children 6–18 years (n = 15,280) and adults 19+ years (n = 29,683) were linked to the
My Pyramid and Food Patterns Equivalents Databases to assess daily intake of total grain and whole grain. These
populations were classified into groups based on average whole grain intake: 0 ounce equivalents (oz eq)/day, > 0 and
<1 oz eq/day, and ≥1 oz eq/day. Within these classifications, body mass index, waist circumference, and percent
overweight/obese were identified. Regression and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations
between these dependent variables and whole grain intake.
Results: Adults consumed a mean 0.72 whole grain oz eq/day in 2001–02 and 0.97 oz eq/day in 2011–12 and
children consumed a mean 0.56 whole grain oz eq/day in 2001–02 and 0.74 oz eq/day in 2011–12. While over
70 % of children and 60 % of adults met daily intake recommendations for total grain, less than 1.0 and 8.0 %
percent of children and adults, respectively, met whole grain recommendations in 2011–12. Adults and children
who consumed whole grain had significantly better intakes of nutrients and dietary fiber compared to non-consumers.
From 2001 to 2012, grain mixed dishes and yeast breads were the leading sources of total grain, while yeast breads
and ready to eat cereals were the leading sources of whole grain for both children and adults. Multiple regression
analysis showed a significant, inverse relationship between body mass index and waist circumference with respect to
whole grain intake after adjustment for covariates in both children and adults (p < 0.05). Similarly, logistic regression
analysis showed a significant inverse relationship between percent overweight/obese and whole grain intake (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Although most children and adults meet daily intake goals for grain foods overall, whole grain as a
portion of total grain intake continues to be consumed at levels well below recommendations. The data from the
current study suggest that greater whole grain consumption is associated with better intakes of nutrients and healthier
body weight in children and adults. Continued efforts to promote increased intake of whole grain foods are warranted.

 Background
Current U.S. dietary guidance includes a recommendation
that at least half of all grains be consumed as whole grains
(WG) [1] with the total amount of grains dependent on
the individual’s age, sex, and level of physical activity. This
recommendation is based on reviews of prospective
studies and randomized trials indicating that WG intake
among adults is associated with chronic disease risk re-
duction including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease,
hypertension, and lower risk of weight gain [2–9] and
lower all-cause mortality [10]. The protective effects of
WG intake have been attributed mostly to bran and germ
components, including bioactive compounds such as anti-
oxidants and minerals [2, 11, 12].
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data from 1999 to 2004 showed an inverse
relationship between WG intake and measures of adult
adiposity including body mass index (BMI), waist cir-
cumference and percent overweight/obese (OW/OB)
[13, 14]. However, an inverse relationship between WG
intake and measures of adiposity among children and
adolescents has been reported less consistently. For ex-
ample, after adjusting for food group intake, WG intake
was not associated with BMI, waist, arm or thigh cir-
cumference among adolescents measured as part of the
NHANES data collection from 1999 to 2004 [15]. How-
ever, an inverse association was reported between intake
at the level of 1.5 to < 3 daily WG servings and BMI z-
score and BMI-for-age percentile among adolescents
based on NHANES data collected during the same time
period [16].
Greater intake of WG foods has also been associated
with improved diet quality among children, adolescents
and adults in the U.S. based on NHANES data (1999–
2004) and in the United Kingdom based on national data
[15, 17–19]. Greater WG intake has been associated
with higher intakes of fiber, folate, magnesium, phos-
phorus, iron, vitamins A, E and select B vitamins, as well
as energy and lower intakes of saturated fat and choles-
terol, added sugars and sodium. Several of these nutri-
ents (vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, magnesium) have
been identified as underconsumed by the general public
in the U.S. [20].
NHANES data (2009–10) indicate that only 2.9 and
7.7 % of children/adolescents and adults consumed ≥ 3
WG ounce equivalents (oz eq)/day, respectively [21],
consistent with estimates from earlier NHANES data
(1999–2004) [17, 18]. Efforts to increase WG intake by
Americans include an emphasis on consumption of WG
foods in dietary guidance since 2005 [1, 20]. The focus
on WG foods fueled consumer interest and demand, as
national survey results in 2015 indicate two-thirds of
consumers considered the WG content of a food an im-
portant factor when making purchase decisions [22].
Following consumer demand, the availability of WG
foods has expanded in the marketplace and food manu-
facturers have conducted applied research to address
barriers such as limited availability and perceived poor
palatability of WG products [23]. In 2011, 3378 new
WG food products were introduced compared to 855 in
2005 (a 4-fold increase) [24]. The alignment of several
nutrition assistance programs with dietary guidance
regarding WG intake has also resulted in increased
product availability in the marketplace. For example, the
Women, Infants and Children Special Supplemental
(WIC) Program revised the food package provided to
participants in 2009 to authorize inclusion of whole
wheat/whole grain bread and other WG options [25].
Several regional studies have shown that the revised
WIC food package resulted in improved availability of
WG foods in convenience and grocery stores [26, 27].
WG food sources were reported for children/adoles-
cents and adults in the U.S. using national dietary intake
data from 2009 to 10 [21]. Primary sources included
ready to eat (RTE) cereals, yeast bread and rolls, oatmeal
and popcorn with adults consuming slightly more oat-
meal than children/adolescents (21 % of the total WG
intake vs. 12 %) and less RTE cereals than children/ado-
lescents (20 % of the total WG intake vs. 25 %). Recent
trends in breakfast choices among consumers, and the
addition of new products to the marketplace may have
resulted in changes in WG food sources over time. Iden-
tification of the main sources of total grain (TG) con-
sumed by adults and children may help determine
additional foods that could be reformulated to include
more whole grains.
A comprehensive report based on data from USDA’s
1994–96 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individ-
uals was published in 2000 providing the first population
estimates of TG and WG intake, major dietary sources
in the U.S. and impact on diet quality [28]. Over the past
20 years, new research on health benefits as well as
changes in dietary guidance, consumer interest, and
availability of WG foods indicates that an examination
of changes in TG and WG intake and diet quality, and
dietary sources is warranted. Recently McGill et al. [29]
reported 10-year trends in WG intake and a descriptive
analysis of WG food sources for U.S. adults and children
based on NHANES data 2001–2010, however, this report
does not include the latest dietary intake information
available from NHANES 2011–2012. A re-examination of
the role that WG intake may play in adiposity is also
warranted given the inconsistent reports of relationships
between WG intake and weight status among children/ad-
olescents [15, 16]. Therefore, the purpose of the current
study was 1) to describe how daily intakes and primary
dietary sources of TG and WG have changed over the past
12 years, and 2) to test the hypotheses that an inverse

 association exists between WG intake and measures of
adiposity among children (6–18 y) and adults (19+ y). This
article reports on trends in TG and WG intake over time
in the US population, whether the trends reflect dietary
recommendations, and health benefits related specifically
to WG intake on improvements in nutrient intake and
body weight.
Methods
Study population
Data from the NHANES 2001–2012 were used for the
present analysis [30]. The continuous NHANES is a
cross-sectional survey that collects data about the nutri-
tion and health status of the U.S. population using a
complex, multi-stage, probability sampling design [30].
NHANES is conducted in a non-institutionalized, civil-
ian U.S. population by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS). NHANES participants completed a
comprehensive questionnaire assessing dietary behaviors,
health history, socioeconomic status, and demographic
information at NHANES Mobile Examination Centers
and in participant’s homes. The NCHS Research Ethics
Review Board reviewed and approved all study protocols
for NHANES 2001–12.
Dietary intake assessment
Trained interviewers conducted in-person 24-h dietary
recalls
using
the
USDA’s
Automated
Multiple-Pass
Method (AMPM) 5-step data collection [31]. Dietary
data included detailed descriptions of all food and quan-
tities eaten. Two days of dietary intake were collected
from participants. Dietary intake data for the first day
were collected through in-person interview. On the sec-
ond day, dietary intake data were collected by telephone
interview. Detailed descriptions of the dietary interview
methods are provided in the NHANES Dietary Inter-
viewer’s Training Manual, which includes pictures of the
Computer-Assisted Dietary Interview system screens,
measurement guides, and charts used to collect dietary
information [32].
The current study utilized intake data only from the
first day of data collection unless otherwise noted. Par-
ticipants with complete and reliable dietary data were
included, as determined by the NCHS. USDA’s Food and
Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) was
used to code and estimate the nutrient content of re-
ported food and beverages for each respective 2 year cycle
of NHANES from 2001 to 12 [33].
Grain intake and main food sources
Mean daily intake of TG and WG reported in ounce
equivalents (oz eq) and the food sources consumed were
calculated for children 6–18 years old and adults 19 years
and above for each 2 year cycle of NHANES from 2001
to 02 to 2011–12. USDA’s My Pyramid equivalent data-
base (MPED) for USDA survey foods, 1994–2002, Ver-
sion 1.0 and 2003–2004, version 2.0 A (MPED 1 and 2)
were used to calculate TG (refined grain + WG) and WG
intake for NHANES 2001–2004 participants [34, 35].
USDA’s
Food
Pattern
Equivalent
Database,
(FPED)
2005–2006, FPED 2007–2008, FPED 2009–2010 and
FPED 2011–2012 were used to calculate TG (refined
grain + WG) and WG intake for NHANES 2005–2012
participants [36–39]. MPE food data files from 2001 to
2004 contain the number of servings per 100 g of food
for 32 MyPyramid food groups, three of which are WG,
refined grain, and TG. The FPED database was revised
in 2005 to report grain consumption in terms of ounce
equivalents (oz eq) in order to align with the food group
serving definitions used in the 2005 Dietary Guidelines
for Americans. Examples of grain food servings con-
tained within the database include one slice of bread, a
cup of cereal, or ½ cup of hot cereal, cooked pasta, rice,
or other grain such as bulgur, oatmeal, and cornmeal.
Grain components contributing to total WG intake were
defined as including all parts of the entire kernel (germ,
bran and endosperm) such as oatmeal, popcorn, whole
wheat, whole barley, wild rice and quinoa [36–39].
National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Usual Intake method
was used to estimate percent of individuals meeting the
recommendations of at least 6 oz eq of TG and at least
3 oz eq of WG per day [40]. Two 24-h dietary recalls
(day 1 and 2) were used to estimate these numbers. This
analysis was done for each 2 year cycles of NHANES
from 2003 to 2012. For NHANES 2001–02, only one 24-
h dietary recall data was available, therefore it was not
possible to estimate the percent meeting the recommen-
dation of TG or WG for the year 2001–02.
Nutrient intake by whole grain consumption
The NHANES 2001–12 were used in this secondary ana-
lysis to examine the relationship between WG intake and
nutrient intake among children (6–18 y of age) (n =
15,280) and adults (≥19 y of age) (n = 29,683). Participants
were categorized into one of three WG consumption
groups based on oz eq consumed per day: none or no
WG (0 oz eq/day), low (>0 to <1 oz eq/day), and high
(≥1 oz eq/day). Intake of energy, macronutrients and se-
lected micronutrients were calculated, and do not include
contributions from dietary supplements, medications, or
plain drinking water. The mean daily nutrient intakes are
compared to understand if any significant difference exists
between the three WG groups.
Whole grain intake and adiposity measures
Adiposity status was assessed by using anthropometric
measurements (i.e., weight, height, and waist circumfer-
ence) conducted by NHANES personnel in the Mobile
Albertson et al. Nutrition Journal  (2016) 15:8

 Examination Center [41]. BMI was calculated as kg/m2.
Status of overweight and/or obesity (%) was assigned by
two different methods for children and adults. Among
adults (≥19 y of age), individuals with BMI ≥ 25 are de-
fined as overweight/obese (OW/OB) and those with
BMI ≥ 30 are defined as obese [42]. Among children (6–
18 y of age), individuals with BMI at or above the 85th
percentile for children of the same age and sex are de-
fined as OW/OB and those with BMI at or above the
95th percentile are defined as obese [43]. For NHANES
2001–12, the relationship between WG intake and adi-
posity measures were studied as a continuous sample.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.2
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Dietary intake sample weights
were applied to all analyses to account for the unequal
probability of selection, non-coverage, and non-response
bias resulting from oversampling of low-income persons,
adolescents, elderly persons, African-Americans, and
Mexican-Americans. Demographic, socioeconomic, and
physical activity information was obtained from their re-
spective NHANES questionnaires. Mean TG or WG
(oz eq/d) intakes were calculated using PROC SURVEY-
MEANS for all the 2 year cycles of NHANES from 2001
to 12 to understand the trend among children and
adults. Regression analysis was performed to understand
the linear and curvilinear trend in mean TG or WG in-
take across different years of NHANES. Analysis of Vari-
ance (ANOVA) was performed to compare mean TG or
WG intake of every cycle of NHANES with 2011–12.
Mean TG or WG intake from different food sources
were estimated using PROC SURVEYMEANS and per-
cent contribution from different food groups were calcu-
lated as a result. This analysis was performed separately
for each cycle of NHANES from 2001 to 12 to under-
stand the change in the sources of grain intake over the
period of 12 years. The NCI usual intake method was
used to estimate the percent individuals meeting the
dietary recommendation of at least 6 servings of TG or
at least 3 servings of WG daily for each cycle of
NHANES from 2003 onwards. ANOVA was used to
compare the mean nutrient intake between three WG
consumption groups: none or no WG (0 oz eq/day), low
(>0 to <1 oz eq/day), and high (≥1 oz eq/day). Baseline
age and weight characteristics were estimated for each
NHANES cycle using the appropriate survey weights.
Multivariate linear regression was performed to deter-
mine the extent to which adiposity measures (BMI, and
waist circumference) were explained by WG intake.
Similarly, multivariate logistic regression was performed
to estimate how the likelihood of being overweight/
obese or obese, respectively, differs across WG con-
sumption groups among children (6–18 y of age) and
adults (≥19 y of age). The analysis was adjusted for the
following covariates: age, age2, gender, race/ethnicity,
total calorie intake (kcal), alcohol intake and physical
activity. A P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Mean daily TG intake in the U.S. population has
remained relatively stable from 2001 to 2012 for both
adults and children, whereas mean daily WG intakes in
the U.S. population have increased slightly (Table 1). Ac-
cording to NHANES 1-day records, children consumed
an average of 7.2 oz eq/day of TG in 2011–12, a signifi-
cant decrease from 7.4 oz eq/day reported in 2001–02.
In adults, mean TG intake decreased from 6.9 oz eq/day in
2001–02 to 6.4 oz eq/day 2007–08, but then increased to
6.8 oz eq/d in 2011–12 (p = 0.0041 for curvilinear trend).
In
comparison,
mean
WG
intake
in
adults
was
0.72 oz eq/day in 2001–02 and an average of 0.97 oz eq/
d in 2011–12, a 35 % increase in WG intake over the
12-year time period (Table 1). The mean WG intake in
2011–12 was significantly greater than all previous
waves. Children age 6–18 consistently consumed slightly
lower levels of WG than adults over the 12-year time
period: on average, 0.56 oz eq/d in 2001–02 and
0.74 oz eq/d in 2011–12, a 32 % increase over 12 years.
Similar to adults, mean intake in 2011–12 was signifi-
cantly greater than all previous waves. Based on 2011–12
consumption levels, WG represented 10 % of mean TG
intake in children, and 14 % of mean TG intake in adults,
which is an increase from 7.5 % in children and 10 % in
adults in 2001–02. Forty six percent of adults and children
reported consuming zero oz eq/d of WG in the continu-
ous sample from NHANES 2001–12 (Tables 5 and 6).
Over 74 % of children and 60 % of adults reported
meeting the daily recommendation for TG intake (at
least 6 oz eq/d) in 2011–12, which was similar to values
reported in 2003–04 (Table 2). In comparison, the per-
cent
of
adults
meeting
recommendations
for
WG
(3 oz eq/day) has increased steadily since 2003–04. Des-
pite these increases, only 7.9 % of adults consumed the
recommended amount of WG in 2011–12 based on 2-
day diet records. Less than 0.5 % of children age 6–18
met the WG recommendations in any of the years
evaluated.
Table 3 shows the % TG intake from various food
groups from 2001 to 2012 for each age group. Yeast
breads, grain mixtures (including frozen meals and
soups), crackers/salty snacks and other grain foods were
consistently the leading sources of TG intake in children
and adults. For children, the largest increase in TG in-
take over the 12-year period was from grain mixtures
(23.3 to 30.9 %), with decreases in the percent contribu-
tion from yeast breads, pasta/rice and RTE cereals

 (Table 3). A similar trend was seen in adults, where rela-
tive TG intake from grain mixtures increased 7.1 %
across 2001–12, with slight decreases in the contribution
from yeast breads, quick breads and pasta/rice (Table 3).
Yeast breads and RTE breakfast cereals have consist-
ently been the top sources of WG intake, accounting for
about 50 % of the WG in the diet. As a source of WG,
RTE breakfast cereals have decreased for children age
6–18 between 2001 and 02 and 2011–12 (39.6 to
27.1 %) (Table 4). Conversely, yeast breads provided a
much larger percentage of WG in children’s diet in
2011–12 (34 %) than in 2001–02 (17 %). Since 2001–02,
crackers and salty grain snacks have increased as a
source of WG for children. These foods provided 6.8 %
of the WG intake in 2001–02 and 9.8 % of the intake in
2011–12. Popcorn and oatmeal as a source of WG have
decreased over time, and each account for 5–10 % of the
WG intake in children. In adults, yeast bread, crackers
and salty grain snacks have increased as a source of WG
over the 12 year time period (Table 4). Comparing
2001–02 and 2011–12 cycle years, notable decreases
were seen in the WG contribution from RTE breakfast
cereals (25.4 vs. 18.6 %), popcorn (11.1 vs. 5.3 %) and
oatmeal (13.6 vs. 10.6 %).
Whole grain consumers had significantly better intakes
of nutrients and other dietary components compared to
non-consumers (Tables 5 and 6). Children age 6–18 who
consumed some WG (0 < WG < 1 oz eq) had higher in-
takes of dietary fiber, potassium, calcium, vitamin C, B-
vitamins, iron, zinc, magnesium, folate and vitamins A
and D. Higher levels of WG consumption (at least 1 oz eq)
also corresponded with overall improved nutrient intakes,
but more specifically higher intakes of carbohydrate, pro-
tein, total sugars, vitamin E and selenium compared to
lower WG intake. In addition, both children and adults
who consumed WG had lower intakes of cholesterol. In
the adult population, those who consumed at least
1 oz eq/day had higher intakes of carbohydrate, protein,
total sugars, dietary fiber, potassium, calcium, thiamin,
riboflavin, vitamin B12, iron, magnesium, folate, selenium,
and vitamins E, A, D and C. These increases in nutrient

ergy intake. Energy intake for both adults and children
were higher for those consuming at least 1 oz eq com-
pared to no WG (0 oz eq/day) and low (>0 to <1 oz eq/
day) consumers.
Baseline age and weight characteristics for children
and adults across NHANES cycles are shown in Table 7.
Comparing sample means in children from 2001 to 02
to 2011–12, BMI increased from 20.9 to 21.3 kg/m2,
WC increased from 73.1 to 74.1 cm, and the % OW/OB
increased from 32.7 to 35.9 % with a larger increase in %
OB from 16.5 to 20.5 %. Similar increasing trends in
mean weight measures were seen for adults comparing
across the 12 year timeframe, in particular an increase in
the % OB from 30.5 to 34.6 %. In adults, there was also
an increase in mean age from 45.6 to 46.9 years that
could reflect the increasing longevity of the US popula-
tion (Table 7). Results from multiple regression analysis

 (Table 8) showed a significant, inverse relationship be-
tween BMI and WC with respect to WG intake in
both children and adults after adjustment for covari-
ates (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed
children consuming at least 1 oz eq WG were signifi-
cantly less OW/OB and OB compared to those with
no WG intake. A similar, significant inverse relation-
ship between percent OW/OB (p < 0.0001) and OB
(p = 0.0035) with increasing WG consumption was
also observed for adults (Table 8).
Discussion
The examination of trends in TG intake, WG intake, food
sources, and effects on nutrient intake and adiposity mea-
sures provides evidence for small changes in intake over
12 years, shifts in dietary sources, and confirmation that
WG foods contribute to dietary quality and weight man-
agement. Dietary guidelines have consistently highlighted
the importance of grains as a staple food group, but have
more recently emphasized increasing the proportion con-
sumed as WG and decreasing the proportion consumed

 as refined grain [1]. Consumption of TG has slightly de-
creased in children since 2001–02, and although adult TG
intake decreased from 2001 to 02 through 2007–08, it
rebounded back to similar consumption levels in 2011–
12. These findings indicate that little progress in decreas-
ing intake of refined grains has occurred in the past
12 years.
Small increases in WG intake were observed over
12 years, with intake in the last 2 year cycle (2011–2012)
higher than all previous cycles. However, the proportion
of the population who met WG recommendations in
2011–12 was still <1 % for children (6–18 y) and <10 %
for adults. Therefore, the ability to achieve the potential
health benefits associated with intake of 40–50 g WG/d
is limited [2]. Low levels of consumption have also been
reported for individuals of varying ages in France [44],
Germany [45], Ireland [46], and the United Kingdom
[47]. Intake by French children and adults was estimated
to be about 9.1 and 14.4 g/d, respectively [44] and intake
by children/teenagers and adults in the United Kingdom
was estimated to be 13 and 20 g/d, respectively [47]. A
longitudinal study of German children and adolescents
reported WG intakes of 20 and 33 g/d, respectively,
from weighed dietary records [45], and a national study
of Irish children and teens using 7 day food records
showed an intake of 18.5 and 23.2 g/d, respectively [46].
These low intake levels indicate that in spite of the dif-
ferences in whole grain sources and eating contexts
across the U.S. and Europe, meeting recommendations
for WG intake is a widespread challenge.
The continued low percentage of children (6–18 y)
and adults (19+ y) in the U.S. not meeting WG

 recommendations is unexpected given the increased
reported availability of WG foods in the marketplace
[48] and in schools based on new school meal require-
ments [49]. Since the 2005 Dietary Guidelines release,
WG pasta, bread and cereal introductions have increased
and growth has been observed in WG product sales vol-
ume, and in whole or multi-grain bread sales relative to all
bread sales [48]. Alignment of food assistance programs
with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans [49] which oc-
curred in 2009 for the WIC program and in 2012 for the
School Lunch and Breakfast Programs may facilitate a
future increase in availability of WG foods and therefore
the proportion of Americans meeting WG recommenda-
tions. WIC served 8.3 million participants in 2014 [50]
and the School Lunch and Breakfast Programs served 30.4
and 13.6 million participants, respectively in 2014 [51]. As
the proportion of whole grain-rich foods served in schools
increases, the proportion of TG intake consumed as re-
fined grain by children may decrease.
Several studies support the important contributions
that breakfast and RTE breakfast cereal make to WG in-
take. Data from NHANES 2001–10 and the national
Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals 1989–
1991 showed that breakfast eating occasions accounted
for a large proportion of WG intake (39–53 %) [29, 52].
Children (5–18 y) participating in the third School
Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (2004–2005) who
ate breakfast which included RTE cereal had higher WG
intake compared to those not eating breakfast [53]. In
the current study, RTE breakfast cereals and oatmeal have
decreased as a source of WG for children, while yeast
breads have increased. Based on nationally representative

56 kcal/d (2009–10) [55]. RTE cereals represented a lower
proportion of both TG (6.9 to 5.0 %) and WG (39.6 to
27.1 %) intake for children in the current study from 2001
to 2012. Therefore, the types of foods served in schools or

 homes for breakfast may have changed over time in the
interest of convenience, with children eating hand-held
or portable foods instead of sitting down to eat a bowl
of cereal.
For both adults and children from 2011 to 2012, grain
mixtures including frozen meals accounted for more
than 25 % of TG intake, but only about 2 % of WG in-
take. These findings indicate that grain mixtures may
represent a category that could benefit from reformula-
tion to include more whole grain and therefore impact
WG intake in the future. Examples of grain products
within this category include pasta, pizza, soups (eg, con-
taining noodles or rice), egg rolls, and pizza rolls. In a
previous modeling study, substitution of refined grain in
a variety of product categories with a specified level of
whole grain was expected to increase WG intake by
1.7 oz eq/day [56]. However, most of the projected in-
crease was based on reformulated yeast bread/rolls and
quick breads (0.85 oz eq/day) and less from foods repre-
senting grain mixtures (0.61 oz eq/day) including pizza
and other mixtures containing flour, and rice and pasta
(including those in mixtures). Reformulation of grain
products to include whole grain is challenging for food
manufacturers with respect to maintaining acceptable
taste, texture and flavor, especially for product categories
considered to be less traditional sources of WG [23].
The development of effective technological approaches
to address these challenges may allow for a wider variety
of whole grain foods to be developed in the future.
The results of the current study indicated that crackers
and non-popcorn salty grain snacks have increased over
the past 12 years as a source of WG for children while
also accounting for a substantial proportion of TG in-
take. This finding is consistent with results from other
studies showing an increased trend in snacking for U.S.
children, and that savory/salty snacks are a popular,
widely-available snacking choice for children/adoles-
cents. An analysis of snacking trends among U.S. chil-
dren
showed
that
snacking
frequency
significantly
increased from 1977 to 78 to 2003–06 by about 1 more
snack/d and the proportion of total energy intake from
snacks increased to 27% [57]. The analysis also showed
that salty snacks (crackers, chips, popcorn, and pretzels)
accounted for the second largest source of total energy
from snacks in 2006 [57]. Savory snacks (potato and
other starchy vegetable chips, popcorn, pretzels, rice
crackers, savory crackers, and zwieback toast) were
consistently one of the seven major food sources con-
tributing to energy intake for U.S. children/adolescents
from 1989 to 2010 [55]. Finally, snack foods are widely
available for purchase by children/adolescents in schools,
retail food and non-food retail environments and restau-
rants according to a recent review on child snacking
patterns [58].
In the current study, children and adults who consumed
the highest amount of WG (>1 oz eq/d) had higher in-
takes of shortfall nutrients (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin
E, folate, vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium) [20] as well
as energy, total sugars and sodium compared with those
who consumed low (0 < WG < 1 oz eq/d) or no WG in-
take/d. These findings indicate that careful selection of
WG foods by consumers is warranted to avoid those foods
with higher sugar and sodium content. The findings with
respect to greater energy, fiber and magnesium intakes
with greater intake of WG are consistent with previous
studies for both children (6–18 y) and adults (19+ y)
[17, 18]. Contrary to the findings in the current study,
O’Neil et al. [17, 18] observed either lower or no sig-
nificant differences in intakes of sodium and total
sugars with greater intakes of WG. However, the cat-
egories of WG intake were based on different cutpoints
compared to the current study which may account for
the lack of consistency between studies.
Recent reviews have indicated inverse associations
between WG intake and BMI, waist circumference,
and weight gain among adults in epidemiological stud-
ies [9, 59] consistent with findings from the current
study. Findings from the current study were also con-
sistent with a previous cross-sectional study involving
NHANES 1999–2004 for adolescents based on an
inverse relationship between WG intake and BMI z-
score and BMI-for-age percentile [16]. However, WG
intake as part of an energy-restricted diet has not been
effective
in
reducing
body
weight
in
short-term,
randomized-controlled,
intervention
studies
among
adults or children [7, 60]. Giacco et al. [59] suggests
that intervention study results may have been affected
by methodological issues including small numbers of
study participants and short duration explaining in
part the lack of consistency of results compared to epi-
demiology studies. Therefore, the results of the current
study may not be directly applicable in clinical settings.
Further intervention studies addressing these limita-
tions are needed among both adults and children.
A number of dietary and physical factors may explain
the inverse associations observed between WG intake
and lower body weight in epidemiological studies. Giacco
et al. [59] suggest possible dietary mechanisms including
lower energy density of WG products and lower glycemic
index of WG compared to refined grain foods which may
enhance satiety. However, in the current study among
adults and children, both energy and fiber intakes were
higher while BMI, waist circumference, % OV/OB and %
OB were lower in the highest WG consumption group
compared to non-WG consumers. These findings do
not support the dietary mechanisms suggested [59],
therefore mechanisms other than effects on satiety
may need to be examined.

 The low intake of WG and small percentage of children
and adults in the U.S. meeting WG recommendations in-
dicates a need for attention to factors that affect selection
and intake of WG foods by consumers [23]. Information
about WG content could be made available on WG food
packages in response to reports that this information is
difficult to interpret [61]. For example, the ability to iden-
tify WG foods was identified as a problem in purchasing
WG foods for schools by food service managers [61]. A
standard definition of WG foods has also been suggested
as a means to enable health professionals and educators to
better promote increased intake [62].
Strengths of the current study include the use of 6 2-
year cycles (2001–02, 2003–04, 2004–06, 2007–08, 2009–
10, 2011–12) of NHANES data which increases the
number and types of foods included in the analysis. In
addition, these data were obtained from a large, nationally
representative sample. In terms of limitations, due to the
cross-sectional nature of the NHANES study design,
causal inferences cannot be made. The use of one day of
dietary recalls is also a potential limitation as it may not
reflect usual consumption; however, data from days 1 and
2 were used to determine the percentage of individuals
meeting TG and WG recommendations. Ounce equiva-
lent units for grain intake were used in the current study
instead of reporting intake in g dry weight/day as recently
suggested by Ross et al. [63]. However, because total and
whole grain intake recommendations based on the U.S.
Dietary Guidelines for Americans are made in oz eq [1],
TG and WG intake were expressed in the same meas-
ure to enable evaluation of intake with respect to rec-
ommendations. Also, in the USDA food patterns, which
are based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, one
oz eq of grains can be either 16 grams or 28.35 g of
grain, depending upon the food source [39]. Therefore
in this case, back converting oz eq to grams could not
be done in a meaningful way. Consistency in ap-
proaches to reporting WG consumption would allow
for more meaningful comparisons in WG intake be-
tween datasets and across global regions. In addition,
the current study reports a detailed description of total
WG intake across food categories, but not by specific
grain type. Based on the top food sources of WG
intake, one could infer that wheat (yeast breads, RTE
cereals), oats (RTE cereals, oatmeal), and corn (pop-
corn, RTE cereals) are the grain types most commonly
consumed, but a more definitive assessment is needed.
A recent study from the HELGA cohort in Scandinavia
did include WG intake by grain type, highlighting rye
and wheat as primary sources across Denmark, Sweden
and Norway [10]. This study utilized a FFQ which typ-
ically contains much fewer unique food items to review
and identify the primary grain type compared to the
variety of foods typically reported in a 24 h recall.
Conclusions
Over the past 12 years, WG consumption has modestly
increased in the US population, while TG intake has
slightly decreased in children but remained steady in
adults. Despite an increase in consumer interest and
availability of WG foods in the marketplace, less than
10 % of Americans meet daily dietary goals to consume
at least half of all grains as WG, while most continue to
meet daily recommendations for TG. Higher consump-
tion of WG can be seen as an indicator of a healthier
diet and lifestyle pattern, as WG intake was associated
with improved nutrient intake and weight measures in
children and adults. Nutrition policy, health professional
and food industry efforts should continue to highlight
the significant gap in WG consumption, and provide
actionable, convenient and affordable options to allow
consumers to more easily integrate WG choices into
daily eating habits.
