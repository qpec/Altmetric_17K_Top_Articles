Abstract: There are limited published data on the burden of rare cancers in the
United States. By using data from the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the authors
provide information on incidence rates, stage at diagnosis, and survival for more
than 100 rare cancers (defined as an incidence of fewer than 6 cases per 100,000
individuals per year) in the United States. Overall, approximately 20% of patients
with cancer in the United States are diagnosed with a rare cancer. Rare cancers
make up a larger proportion of cancers diagnosed in Hispanic (24%) and Asian/
Pacific Islander (22%) patients compared with non-Hispanic blacks (20%) and non-
Hispanic whites (19%). More than two-thirds (71%) of cancers occurring in children
and adolescents are rare cancers compared with less than 20% of cancers diag-
nosed in patients aged 65 years and older. Among solid tumors, 59% of rare cancers
are diagnosed at regional or distant stages compared with 45% of common cancers.
In part because of this stage distribution, 5-year relative survival is poorer for
patients with a rare cancer compared with those diagnosed with a common cancer
among both males (55% vs 75%) and females (60% vs 74%). However, 5-year relative
survival is substantially higher for children and adolescents diagnosed with a rare
cancer (82%) than for adults (46% for ages 65-79 years). Continued efforts are
needed to develop interventions for prevention, early detection, and treatment to
reduce the burden of rare cancers. Such discoveries can often advance knowledge
for all cancers. CA Cancer J Clin 2017;67:261-272. V

Introduction
Rare cancers present unique challenges for clinicians and their patients. For most
rare cancers, research to identify causes or to develop strategies for prevention or
early detection is limited or nonexistent. In addition, rare cancers can be challeng-
ing to diagnose, often resulting in numerous physician visits, misdiagnoses, and
substantial delays in diagnosis. Treatment options for rare cancers are often more
limited and less effective than for more common cancers. This is partly because
there is less preclinical research and fewer clinical trials for rare cancers, which are
often limited to select high-volume cancer centers.1 Consequently, rare cancers
have become an area of priority for some researchers and public health advocates.2
There is no universally adopted definition for rare cancers. The US Orphan
Drug Act of 1983 defined rare diseases as those affecting less than 200,000 people
in the United States.3 In 2010, Greenlee et al described the US burden of rare can-
cers according to the National Cancer Institute’s definition as those cancers with
fewer than 15 cases per 100,000 people per year.4 More recently, a consortium
from the European Union, Surveillance of Rare Cancer in Europe (RARECARE),
described the burden of rare cancers in Europe using a revised definition of rare
cancers as those with fewer than 6 cases per 100,000 people per year.5 As part of
this effort, the RARECARE working group, consisting of pathologists, hematolo-
gists, other clinicians, and epidemiologists, produced a list of clinically relevant, his-
tologically defined cancers. Herein, we describe the burden of rare cancers in the

 United States, providing data on incidence, stage at diagno-
sis, and survival for 181 rare cancers according to the
RARECARE definition and list of rare cancers.
Materials and Methods
Definition of Rare and Common Cancers
All cancers were defined using the list of cancers produced
by the RARECARE study group.6 The RARECARE can-
cer list classifies cancers using combinations of International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition
(ICD-O-3) morphology and topography codes and is hier-
archically organized in to 3 layers.7 The first layer consists
of families of tumors according to a consensus-based clinical
perspective. The second layer groups tumors into those per-
ceived by clinicians as single diseases that are relevant for
clinical management and research. The third layer consists
of World Health Organization names of individual cancer
entities and corresponding ICD-O-3 codes. We limited
this analysis of rare cancers in the United States to those
invasive cancers from the RARECARE list with an overall
annual crude incidence rate of fewer than 6 cases per
100,000 people. For sex-specific cancers (eg, squamous cell
carcinoma of the cervix uteri and seminoma of the testis),
status as a rare cancer was based on the incidence rate in the
appropriate population of males or females. In this report,
we provide information for cancers in the second layer as
well as for specific subtypes of adenocarcinoma of the breast,
which are third-layer entities. The 19 cancers that were clas-
sified as common are listed in Table 1. In addition, we
excluded 13 cancers for which there were fewer than 25
cases during 2009 through 2013 (Table 2).
Data Sources
Incidence rates and case distributions by sex, race/ethnicity,
age, and stage at diagnosis were obtained using North
American
Association
of
Central
Cancer
Registries
(NAACCR) data from 47 states and the District of Colum-
bia, representing 96.7% of the US population.8 Data from
Minnesota, Nevada, and New Mexico were not included,
because these states failed to meet NAACCR high-quality
standards for a year or more during 2009 through 2013.
Data for survival analyses were obtained from the Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) SEER 18 registries,
which cover approximately 28% of the US population.9
One-year and 5-year relative survival were based on patients
who were diagnosed during 2008 through 2012 and 2006
through 2012, respectively, and were followed through 2013.
Statistical Analyses
Incidence rates and relative survival were calculated using
the NCI’s SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.2).10 All inci-
dence rates were age-standardized to the 2000 US standard
population and expressed per 100,000 population. Stage dis-
tribution was analyzed using SEER Summary Stage. The
percentage of cases diagnosed at regional or distant stage
was based on patients who had known stage at diagnosis.
Relative survival is the ratio of observed survival in a cohort
of patients diagnosed with a specific cancer to the expected
survival for a similar group of individuals without cancer in
the general population and is an estimate of the percentage
of patients expected to survive the effects of their cancer.
Statistics are not shown when they are based on fewer than
10 cases.
Selected Findings
We identified 181 rare cancers with overall incidence rates
of fewer than 6 cases per 100,000 per year during
2009 through 2013 (Table 3). Together, these rare cancers
represent 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States

The Burden of Rare Cancers in the United States

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 during 2009 through 2013. Of these 181 rare cancers, 119
cancers are considered very rare, that is, with an incidence
rate �0.5 per 100,000. These very rare cancers represent
only about 3% of all cancers diagnosed each year.
Variations in the percentages of rare cancers by sex, race/
ethnicity, and age at diagnosis are shown in Figure 1. Some
cancers cannot be classified as rare or common because of
nonspecific morphology coding. Rare cancers make up a

 slightly larger proportion of cancers in males than females
(21% vs 19%) and in Hispanics (24%) and Asians/Pacific
Islanders (22%) compared with non-Hispanic (NH) blacks
(20%) and NH whites (19%). The greater representation of
rare cancers in racial/ethnic minorities may contribute to
racial/ethnic disparities in overall cancer outcomes. The pro-
portion of rare cancers is greater among children and adoles-
cents and young adults; rare cancers accounted for the
majority (71%) of diagnoses in those aged younger than 20
years and 39% of cancers in those ages 20 to 39 years. In
contrast, rare cancers represented about 17% to 20% of can-
cers diagnosed in adults aged 40 years and older.
Figure 1 also describes the distribution of rare and com-
mon cancers by cancer site. Rare cancers account for only
5% of both breast and male genital system cancers but as
much as 38% of hematopoietic and 36% of digestive system
cancers, which include cancers that occur in the oral cavity
and pharynx, all of which are rare. Rare cancers also make
up nearly one-third of cancers of the female genital system
(31%).
Table 3 shows variation in incidence rates for specific rare
cancers by sex and race/ethnicity. Some cancers that are rare
overall are more common in specific demographic groups.
For example, although adenocarcinoma of the stomach is
considered a rare cancer overall, it is a common cancer
among males and Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander
females. Conversely, NH white males and females have the
highest rates of transitional cell carcinoma of the pelvis and
ureter (2.06 and 1.07 per 100,000, respectively), and NH
black males and females have the lowest (0.85 and 0.52 per
100,000, respectively). Similarly, NH whites have the high-
est rates of bladder cancer in the United States.11 Malignant
thymoma is a very rare cancer (<0.5 per 100,000) among all
subgroups, but rates are twice as high in NH black and
Asian/Pacific Islander men and women compared with NH
white men and women. Racial differences in thymoma rates

 have been noted previously, but reasons for the disparities
are not currently known.12 Examining racial and ethnic dif-
ferences in risk for some rare cancers may provide insights
into their etiology.
Figure 2 compares 5-year survival for rare and common
cancers by sex. Overall, 5-year relative survival for rare can-
cers is poorer than that for common cancers among both
males (55% vs 75%) and females (60% vs 74%). The survival
difference in part reflects differences in stage at diagnosis.
Among solid tumors with information on stage at diagnosis,
59% of rare cancers are diagnosed at regional/distant stages
compared with 45% of common cancers (Table 4). To some
extent, delays in diagnosis are nearly inevitable, because,
by definition, clinicians will not see rare cancers often
and will initially seek to rule out more common causes of
symptoms.13-16
Five-year relative survival for patients with rare and com-
mon cancers varies by age at diagnosis (Fig. 3). Five-year
survival is substantially higher for children (ages birth-19
years) and young adults (ages 20-39 years) diagnosed with
a rare cancer (about 80%) compared with older adults
diagnosed with a rare cancer (60% or less). Nevertheless,
patients with a rare cancer diagnosis have poorer survival
than those with a common cancer diagnosis across all age
groups. Notably, the difference in survival between rare and
common cancers is much greater in older patients. For exam-
ple, among patients diagnosed with cancer who are aged
older than 80 years, the 5-year relative survival rate was 35%
for those diagnosed with a rare cancer compared with 60%
for those diagnosed with a common cancer (Fig. 3).
The proportion of late (regional/distant) stage diagnoses
and the 1-year and 5-year relative survival rates for select
rare cancers are provided in Table 4. The proportion of can-
cers diagnosed at late stage ranges from only 6% for soft tis-
sue sarcoma of the skin and tubular adenocarcinoma of the
breast to greater than 90% of mesothelioma of pleura and
pericardium, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of gall bladder
and extrahepatic bile duct, SCC of nasopharynx, undiffer-
entiated carcinomas of the nasal cavities and sinuses, and
Mullerian mixed tumors of the ovary. There are also wide
variations in 1-year and 5-year relative survival for rare can-
cers. One-year relative survival ranges from 20% for SCC of
the liver to 90% or greater for 72 rare cancers, including soft
tissue sarcomas of the breast, limbs, paraorbit, paratestis,
and skin, classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant
Hodgkin lymphoma, and uveal melanoma. Five-year rela-
tive survival ranges from less than 10% for 7 rare cancers,
including undifferentiated carcinomas of the stomach (0%),
mesothelioma of the pleura and pericardium (6%), SCC of
pancreas (8%), and adenocarcinoma of the liver (8%), to
nearly 100% for several rare subtypes of adenocarcinoma of
the breast, including mucinous carcinoma, invasive cribri-
form carcinoma, and tubular carcinoma.
Discussion
In this report, we provide an overview of the burden of rare
cancers in the United States. Overall, rare cancers represent
20% of cancers diagnosed in the United States. Previous
studies using the RARECARE definition demonstrated that
rare cancers represent 22% of cancer diagnoses in Europe (27
countries), 17% of cancers in the Netherlands, and 15% of
diagnoses in Japan.5,17,18 Similarly, Greenlee et al estimated
that 25% of all cancers diagnosed in US adults during 1995
through 2004 were rare, considering rare cancers as those
with rates less than 15 per 100,000 population.4
Overall, 5-year relative survival is poorer for patients with
a rare cancer compared with those diagnosed with a more
common cancer among both males (55% vs 75%) and
females (60% vs 74%). Similarly, Gatta et al reported that
the 5-year survival rate in Europe was 47% for patients with
rare cancers compared with 67% for those with common
cancers.19 Reasons for poorer survival for rare cancers
include lack of effective treatments and standard treatment
guidelines as well as delays in diagnosis.2 Poor survival for
some rare cancers, such as those that are more prevalent
among adolescents and young adults, may also in part reflect
differences in tumor biology.20,21
Clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for rare cancers
are inherently challenging. Billingham et al recently pro-
posed methods that could increase the utility of clinical tri-
als
for
rare
cancers,
including
strategies
that
would
maximize recruitment and minimize sample size in the con-
ventional trial setting, as well as alternative study designs.22
International collaboration in clinical trials is essential to
improve outcomes for rare cancers. To this end, the Interna-
tional Rare Cancers Initiative was established in 2011 as a
joint initiative between the NCI, Cancer Research UK, the

The Burden of Rare Cancers in the United States
270
CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research
Network: Cancer, the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer, the French National Cancer
Institute, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada
Clinical Trials Group to facilitate the development of inter-
national trials and boost the progress of new treatments that
initially focused on 9 specific rare cancers.23 In addition, in
2014, the National Clinical Trials Network was launched in
the United States with a focus on the study of rare cancers.24
Notably, there has been tremendous success in the advance-
ment of treatment for many childhood cancers, in large part
because treatment for children’s cancers has been concen-
trated in specialized centers and the joint research collabora-
tions among these centers.25-27
Among solid tumors, 59% of rare cancers are diagnosed at
regional/distant stages compared with 45% of all common
cancers. Progress in screening and detection of cancer has
generally been limited to more common cancer sites. Of
course, some rare histologic subtypes of more common can-
cer sites, such as rare subtypes of adenocarcinoma of the
breast, are detectable through current screening modalities.
Screening of rare cancer sites is generally impractical because
of the extremely large numbers of patients that would need
to be screened to prevent one death.28 As a result, most
patients with a rare cancer present with symptoms, which are
often nonspecific.29 Efforts to increase awareness of rare can-
cer symptoms in patients and clinicians could lead to earlier
detection and improvements in survival.30
There are several limitations in this analysis of rare cancers.
It may be more difficult to diagnose and register rare cancers
than common cancers. In this study, 775,645 of 7,465,548
cases (10%) could not be classified as rare or common cancers;
127,105 of these (16%) were unknown primary (C80.9),
285,600 (36%) were classified as neoplasms (C8000) without
additional detail regarding morphology, and 134,839 (17%)
were classified as carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS)
(C8010). Unspecified morphology (ie, NOS) may reflect dif-
ficulty making a precise diagnosis or inadequate documenta-
tion, which could result in an underestimate for some rare
cancers. The RARECARE group conducted a sensitivity
analysis and concluded that the vast majority of NOS cases in
Europe were due to genuine difficulties in assigning more
specific diagnoses.5 It is also notable that some cancers that
are defined herein as rare according to the RARECARE
framework may in fact be well studied and/or not “clinically
rare,” in that they do not require unique treatments. Finally,
the number of rare cancers will likely continue to increase as
cancers are being further defined on the basis of molecular
markers; however, these data are generally not currently avail-
able from cancer registries.
Collectively, rare cancers contribute to a substantial por-
tion of the cancer burden in the United States. The propor-
tion of rare cancers is likely to grow because of the
increasing use of molecular markers in the classification of
cancers. Research and resources have historically focused on
the most common cancers and thus the development of
novel therapeutics has lagged behind for rare cancers, except
for childhood cancers, which have had remarkable progress
in treatment and survival.25,26 Continued efforts are needed
to develop interventions for prevention, early detection, and
treatment to reduce the burden of rare cancers. Notably, the
study of rare cancers has led to the identification of numer-
ous cancer genes and has increased understanding of cancer
biology.31,32 Discoveries for rare cancers can further knowl-
edge for all cancers. �
