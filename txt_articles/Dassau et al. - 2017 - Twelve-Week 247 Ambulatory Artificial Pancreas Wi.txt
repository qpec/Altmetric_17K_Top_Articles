Diabetes Care 2017;40:1719–1726 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-1188
OBJECTIVE
Artificial pancreas (AP) systems are best positioned for optimal treatment of type 1
diabetes (T1D) and are currently being tested in outpatient clinical trials. Our con-
sortium developed and tested a novel adaptive AP in an outpatient, single-arm,
uncontrolled multicenter clinical trial lasting 12 weeks.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Thirty adults with T1D completed a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)-augmented
1-week sensor-augmentedpump(SAP) period. After theAPwas started, basalinsulin
delivery settings used by the AP for initialization were adapted weekly, and carbo-
hydrate ratios wereadaptedevery4 weeks byanalgorithmrunningona cloud-based
server, with automatic data upload from devices. Adaptations were reviewed by
expert study clinicians and patients. The primary end point was change in hemoglo-
bin A1c (HbA1c). Outcomes are reported adhering to consensus recommendations on
reporting of AP trials.
RESULTS
Twenty-nine patients completed the trial. HbA1c, 7.0 6 0.8% at the start of AP use,
improved to 6.7 6 0.6% after 12 weeks (20.3, 95% CI 20.5 to 20.2, P < 0.001).
Compared with the SAP run-in, CGM time spent in the hypoglycemic range improved
during the day from 5.0 to 1.9% (23.1, 95% CI 24.1 to 22.1, P < 0.001) and overnight
from 4.1 to 1.1% (23.1, 95% CI 24.2 to 21.9, P < 0.001). Whereas carbohydrate
ratios wereadapted to a larger extentinitiallywithminimal changesthereafter,basal
insulin was adapted throughout. Approximately 10% of adaptation recommenda-
tions were manually overridden. There were no protocol-related serious adverse
events.
CONCLUSIONS

A number of artificial pancreas (AP) systems have recently been developed to auto-
mate basal insulin delivery for individuals with type 1 diabetes (TID) (1). Although initial
AP studies were of shorter duration and performed in clinical research centers, the
technology has matured enough to permit larger scale and longer outpatient clinical
trials culminating in recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 the first commercial hybrid AP system in
the U.S. that works by automated basal
ratemodulation(2–4).Alimitationofcur-
rent AP systems is that patients must still
input carbohydrate estimations for de-
livery of meal insulin boluses. Because in-
sulin analogs take ;50 min to reach peak
serum concentration (5), adjustment of
the basal rate (reduction/suspension or
increase in insulin delivery) is not always
enough to compensate for inaccuracies
in meal bolus dosing, exercise, illnesses,
stress,orotheractivitiesthatchangeinsulin
sensitivity.
As a result, a number of recent AP stud-
ies have included a period of clinician-led
optimization of open-loop insulin pump
settings or continued clinician adjust-
ments to these settings throughout their
use, with the goal of letting the AP system
function as effectively as possible when
basal rates and other settings are already
optimized (6–12). To help this process,
different degrees of automated adapta-
tion are being developed (13–15). Yet
how to best optimize adaptation to safely
improve glucose control, in frequency
and magnitude of adjustments to the un-
derlying basal insulin and carbohydrate
ratio profile, remains to be determined
(3,16).
We previously reported on our system
that algorithmically optimized open-loop
settings to improve AP results (15). We
have since improved and expanded this
system, and here report the results of a
12-week single-arm, multicenter clinical
trial of 24/7 at-home AP in 30 adult pa-
tients with T1D. In this trial we performed
cloud-based, algorithmic adaptation of
basal rate and carbohydrate ratio profiles
during AP use, providing a novel auto-
mated system for weekly adaptation of
insulin delivery settings without the
need for clinician or patient involvement
for upload or analysis. We used these au-
tomated adaptations to initialize the AP
system for subsequent weeks in the study
to assess long-term improvement in gly-
cemic control by change in hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) and time in euglycemic target
range.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Trial Oversight
This study was an investigator-initiated
single-arm, multicenter trial analyzing
the effects of weekly adaptations of basal
insulin rates and monthly adaptations of
carbohydrate ratios during AP use at
three clinical sites (William Sansum Dia-
betes Center, Santa Barbara, CA; Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN; and University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), with engi-
neering support from four sites (Harvard
University, Cambridge, MA; University of
California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara,
CA; University of Padova, Padova, Italy;
and University of Virginia, Charlottesville,
VA). The trial was overseen by a data and
safety monitoringboard. The fulltrial pro-
tocol was approved by the FDA, the in-
stitutional review board at each center,
and the data and safety monitoring board.
Thetrialwasperformedinaccordancewith
theprinciplesoftheDeclarationofHelsinki.
All participants provided written informed
consent. The protocol was registered on
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02705053).
The authors assume responsibility for the
accuracy and completeness of the data
and analysis.
Patients and Study Design
The design of the study is shown in Fig. 1.
Adults (aged 21–65 years) with T1D for at
least 1 year, using an insulin pump for at
least 6 months, and an HbA1c ,10% were
enrolled. Additional eligibility criteria in-
cluded baseline screening laboratory
tests within normal reference ranges
and commitment from a care partner
knowledgeable of the participant’s loca-
tion at all times and available to assist in
responding to hypo- or hyperglycemia
as needed. Exclusion criteria included
pregnancy, diabetic ketoacidosis or se-
vere hypoglycemia in the past 12 months,
medicalconditions ormedicationuse that
increased the risk of hypo- or hypergly-
cemia, and hypoglycemia unawareness,
defined as a score of $4 on the Clarke
Hypoglycemia Unawareness Question-
naire (17).
The Accu-Chek Spirit Combo insulin
pump (Roche Diabetes Care, Indianapolis,
IN) and the G4 Share AP continuous glu-
cose monitor (CGM) with 505 algorithm
(Dexcom, San Diego, CA) were connected
wirelessly via Bluetooth to the Diabetes
Assistant (DiAs) smartphone device (Uni-
versity of Virginia) (Supplementary Fig. 1)
(18). The Zone Model Predictive Con-
troller (MPC) (19) AP and the Health
Monitoring System (20) hypoglycemia
prediction algorithms (University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara/Harvard University)
both ran on the DiAs. Remote safety
monitoring was available to clinical staff,
who received short message service–text
message alerts for specific conditions
where they were instructed to contact a
participant or care partner should there
be a technical issue or safety concern,
both in the sensor-augmented pump
(SAP) 1-week run-in and during the
12 weeks of AP use. Study staff reviewed
patient data on the remote monitoring
site continuously throughout the study
according to the FDA mandate. In addi-
tion, participants were contacted weekly
by study staff and had monthly follow-up
visits throughout the study. While using
the AP system, patients were instructed
to avoid deviating from their regular daily
diet and exercise routine and to maintain
their usual sleep schedule during the
course of the study.
The Zone MPC AP control algorithm
modulated insulin delivery every 5 min
based on the CGM glucose level, histor-
ical glucose measurements, anticipated
glucose trends, historical insulin deliv-
ery, and patient-specific information
such as the basal rate profile. The algo-
rithm strove to maintain CGM glucose
levels in the safe euglycemic range
(80–140 mg/dL) during the day, with an
asymmetric penalty weighted to prevent
hypoglycemia (19). Meal boluses were
also given by subjects for their meals.
Similar to our previous study designs
(15,21) and as validated by others (22), the
AP system modified the mealtime bolus
Figure 1—Study design. After a 1-week SAP
run-in, patients had an automated carbohy-
drate (Carb) ratio adaptation and underwent
AP training and run-in. They then used the AP
for 4 weeks, with automated basal rate adap-
tations occurring at the start of each week for
3 more weeks. This same pattern (one carbo-
hydrate adaptation followed by 3 weekly
basal rate adaptations) was performed again
for the second and third months of the study.
Prespecified outcome weeks are shaded.

 based on the fingerstick self-monitoring
blood glucose (SMBG) value at the time
of the meal as follows: for SMBG
,120 mg/dL, 80% of the bolus calculated
using the patient’s own carbohydrate ra-
tio was delivered; for SMBG between
120 and 150 mg/dL, the full bolus was
given; for SMBG .150 mg/dL, the full
bolus was given with an additional correc-
tion based on the patient’s own correc-
tion factor to lower glucose to 150 mg/dL.
The correction was limited to 2 units.
Adaptation of Carbohydrate Ratio and
Basal Rates
Every 5 min, the DiAs device uploaded
CGM, SMBG, meal, and insulin delivery
data to a server without any user inter-
vention. At the start of AP use and once
every 4 weeks, an automated algorithm
running on this server retrospectively re-
viewed the CGM, insulin delivery, and
meal data of the last 7 days to calculate
an index of insulin sensitivity relative to
each meal, as previously described (23),
and recommended changes to the carbo-
hydrate ratio profile. Changes were al-
lowed only if large hypo- or hyperglycemic
excursions occurred within the last 7 days.
For safety reasons, each carbohydrate ratio
value was constrained to lie within the
range 4–20 g/unit, with a 0.5 g/unit reso-
lution, and the final recommendation was
allowed to deviate from the previous
profile by no more than 20% (see Sup-
plementary Data for additional details).
At the start of AP use and three times
per month, the basal rate adaptation rou-
tine also ran on the cloud, using CGM,
SMBG, and insulin delivery data between
meals. It computed an “ideal” basal pro-
file, reconciling historical AP insulin deliv-
ery over the previous 10 days with the
current profile setting and provided an
adapted basal profile that deviated from
the original by no more than 25% at any
time of the day (see Supplementary Data
for additional details).
Study physicians reviewed these rec-
ommended changes in carbohydrate ra-
tio and basal rate profile as part of the
study protocol, with changes made to
the insulin delivery profile settings after
mutual agreement between the study
physicianand the patient. A team ofstudy
physicians reviewed all overrides.
Outcome Measures
The primary end point was the change in
HbA1c from the start of AP use to the end
of week 12 of AP use, with HbA1c also
measured at 4 and 8 weeks into AP use
for repeated measures. Secondary out-
come measures included a set of prede-
fined quantifications of the CGM data and
data generated about the operation of
the adapted AP algorithm. For the CGM
data, numerical summaries were calculated
at four time points to match the HbA1c as-
sessment periods; the SAP run-in phase
week and the last week of each of the
4-week AP periods (Fig. 1). Other CGM-
based outcome measures are reported
consistent with the recent AP outcomes
measures consensus statement (24).
Statistical Analyses
The sample size for this study was based
on the change in HbA1c, which was as-
sumed to be similar to recent long-term
outpatient APstudies(11).Poweranalysis
showed that at least 26 patients would be
required to achieve 95% power at signif-
icance level of 0.05 to detect a change of
0.76 SD in HbA1c. To account for attrition
during the course of the study, the sam-
ple size was adjusted to be 30 overall,
with 10 participants per site. For analyses
of the primary and CGM-based secondary
outcome measures, a mixed model with
random subject effect was used to ac-
count for the clustering of the four mea-
surements over time per participant.
Study time was modeled as a factor vari-
able, and the primary contrast of interest
was the change between week 12 of AP
and the baseline assessment at the end
of the SAP run-in. Additional contrasts
comparing the change of the intermedi-
ate weeks (i.e., weeks 4 and 8 of AP) with
baseline were also estimated. Descrip-
tive statistics, including means 6 SDs
and n (%), were also computed to de-
scribe the sample characteristics and out-
come distributions. R 3.3.1 (The R Project
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) were
used for statistical programming, includ-
ing derivation of the CGM summaries.
Mixed models were estimated using
PROC MIXED in SAS 9.4. Reported P val-
ues are two-sided and were not adjusted
for multiple testing. All results are ex-
pressed as mean 6 SD.
RESULTS
Patients
Of 34 patients who were screened, 32
(17 women) enrolled, with 2 withdrawals
after device training before the SAP run-
in. Baseline HbA1c at the start of AP was
7.0 6 0.8%. One patient stopped the AP
intervention at week 11 owing to an un-
related acute coronary event (see ADVERSE
EVENTS) but was included in all analyses.
There were 29 patients who completed
the full protocol. Demographic details
are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Glycemic Outcomes
HbA1c, 7.0 6 0.8% at the start of AP use,
improved to 6.7 6 0.6% after 12 weeks
(20.3, 95% CI 20.5 to 20.2, P , 0.001)
(Table 1). Compared with the SAP run-in,
the percentage of time CGM glucose
was ,70 mg/dL improved during the
day from 5.0 to 1.9% (23.1, 95% CI
24.1 to 22.1, P , 0.001) and overnight
from 4.1 to 1.1% (23.1, 95% CI 24.2 to
21.9, P , 0.001) compared with the last
week of the AP (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The
changes were also reflected in the low
blood glucose index.
The mean CGM glucose values for the
SAP run-in phase, compared with weeks 4,
8, and 12 of AP use, are shown graphi-
cally in Fig. 3. The reduced exposure to
hypoglycemia throughout the study is
reflected in the changes in the blue over-
lays in Fig. 3, suggesting decreased gly-
cemic variability throughout the study.
However,themean CGMglucoseincreased
from 141.9 6 20.1 mg/dL at SAP run-in to
149.6 6 21.0 mg/dL at week 8 and to
152.5 6 20.7 mg/dL at week 12 (Table 1).
Totalcarbohydrateratioprofilechanges
showed a larger change with the first ad-
aptation (with some patients changing al-
most 20%) (Supplementary Fig. 2). After
the first month of the AP, there was con-
vergence with minimal changes to carbo-
hydrate ratios.
There was considerable basal rate pro-
file adaptation throughout the study (three
times per month) (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Total basal profile changed by as much as
2.5 units/day, although the effect of this
was difficult to discern given that the AP
was adjusting basal rates every 5 min.
The total daily dose of insulin delivered
in the prespecified outcome weeks is
listed by subject in Supplementary Table
2. The total daily insulin dose during
AP increased from a mean of 35.0 6
15.4 units/day during the SAP run-in to
42.5 6 21.4 units/day during week 12 of
the AP (7.77, 95% CI 4.61 to 10.93, P ,
0.001). The total bolus dose did not sig-
nificantly change, suggesting the increase
inTDIwasprimarilyfrombasalratechanges
and controller action during AP use. The

Physician Overrides of the Automated
Learning System
Duringthestudy,the systemmadeacom-
bined 358 recommendations to update
basal rate and carbohydrate ratio set-
tings. Study physicians declined the auto-
mated recommendation 21 times for the
carbohydrate ratio and 14 times for basal
rate (90% acceptance rate of the algorith-
mic adaptations) (Supplementary Table
3). The main reason cited was concern
for increasing hyper- or hypoglycemia in
thecontext ofpatientsstatinga change to
their prior routine (e.g., change in physi-
cal activity).

(.60,000 h of AP use), one patient had
a hypoglycemic event requiring evalu-
ation and assistance taking oral car-
bohydrates after a meal bolus but no
additional treatment. This event occurred
despite the automatic 20% reduction in
recommended meal bolus insulin delivery
that is built into the AP, which the patient
accepted before giving the bolus. Ketones
developed in five patients related to in-
fusion set failure, all of which resolved
with changing the infusion set. An unre-
lated acute coronary syndrome devel-
oped in one patient during exercise while
euglycemic for the past 24 h in the 11th
week of the study and was found to have a
90% occlusion of his right coronary artery
requiring stent placement. He recovered
fully but was withdrawn from the study
based on prespecified criteria. All adverse
events are summarized in Supplementary
Table 4.
CONCLUSIONS
The advent of insulin pumps, CGM, and
other advanced technology has led to nu-
merous changes in diabetes care. Yet out-
comes are still not ideal, with registry data
showing a mean HbA1c of 8.4% in persons
with T1D, along with up to 6% of T1D
Exchange registry participants report-
ing a seizure or loss of consciousness
caused by hypoglycemia in the prior
3 months (25).
AP systems, which adjust up or down
preset basal rates on the insulin pump,
promise to improve these results. Per-
centage of time spent in goal glucose
range of 70–180 mg/dL is as high as
67.7–79.1%inlarger studies ofoutpatient
AP, and the automation involved has in-
creased (3,11,12,15,26). However, a limi-
tation remains on the effectiveness of AP
caused by the speed of insulin action,
with automated basal rate changes tak-
ing timedsometimes several hoursdto
show full clinical effect (27). Patients who
are taking too little or too much basal in-
sulin may find it takes too long to address
disturbances in glucose levels.
Automated adaptations to achieve
ideal basal insulin delivery settings are
clinically important. Having patients on
nearly optimal basal rates helps the AP
algorithms to be as effective as possible
as they work within a given constraint
when reducing/suspending or giving ex-
trainsulin.The insulindelivery settings for
patients starting AP may not be opti-
mized. A well-recognized limitation of
current diabetes management is the dif-
ficulty in obtaining and analyzing the
day-to-day data from diabetes devices,
where only a minority of patients ever
review their data (28). In fact, during the
run-in period of other AP studies, with
just the addition of CGM and weekly
follow-up for structured education and
heightened awareness of their glucose
control, patients showed significant im-
provement in HbA1c over 4 to 6 weeks be-
fore use of AP (29).
Some studies have proven the feasibil-
ity of using cloud-based diabetes man-
agement programs for insulin initiation
and titration, although these were not
fully automated (30). Our previous efforts
have focused on a run-to-run methodol-
ogy toadaptbasal ratesand carbohydrate
ratiosthrough continuousfeedbackin the
open-loop setting (31–33), followed by
application of these results to the AP
(15). In this study, we developed a novel,
user-friendly (completely automated)
cloud computing system to seamlessly in-
tegrate data from the AP into our adap-
tation framework for basal rates and
carbohydrate ratios throughout the
study, potentially obviating the need for
clinician involvement before or during
use of the AP. Our approach, adapting
open-loop settings that are used by the
AP algorithm, is easily understandable
and transparent to both patients and
physicians.
Our results were similar to other long-
term AP trials, with our study showing a
mean HbA1c decrease of 0.3% after
12 weeks of use (3,4,12,34). How fre-
quently adaptation should be happening
to further improve HbA1c is another as-
pect of AP systems that is not yet known.
Whereas the currently approved 670G
system adapts daily (35), our system re-
sponds every week.
In this report, the percentage of time
glucose was at ,70 mg/dL significantly
decreased during the day and overnight,
but at the same time showed improve-
ment in HbA1c. Despite the mean starting
HbA1c of only 7.0%, almost all patients
showed an improvement while also re-
ducing time in the hypoglycemic range.
No significant change occurred in the
percentage of time in the range 70–180
mg/dL, but mean glucose increased
from 142 to 153 mg/dL. As is well known,
the glucose distribution in patients with
T1D is asymmetric; thus, mean glucose
provides limited information. The likely
explanation for the elevation in mean
glucose despite the HbA1c being reduced
isthatouranalysesonlyaccountfor4weeks
during this period. The SD remained similar
while mean glucose increased, resulting in
a decrease of the coefficient of variation.
This confirms a decrease in the dispersion
of glucose. Finally, the HbA1c values reflect
Figure 2—Change in HbA1c compared with
percentage of time in hypoglycemia. Repre-
sented are the individual HbA1c measure-
ments and the percentage of time CGM
glucose was ,70 mg/dL (radius of the circle)

ual subjects are shown by the colored lines

 glucose status over 8 to 12 weeks, and
glucose analyses for all of the 12 weeks
may show lower mean glucose.
It will be important for clinicians and
patients to have trust in the recommen-
dations of any automated adaptation sys-
tem that adjusts insulin delivery settings.
For this reason, we allowed study clini-
cians and patients to override the auto-
mated algorithmic adaptations. Less than
10% of the algorithmic insulin delivery
profile recommendations were overrid-
den as a result of 1) concern for hyper-
or hypoglycemia after meals, 2) changing
insulin requirements reported by the pa-
tients, and3) projected changesin activity
level for the following week. The largest
changes in carbohydrate ratio adaptation
were made by the system in the begin-
ning of the study, with subsequent minor
changes as the study progressed. Larger
controlled studies will be necessary to in-
terpret the true effectiveness of these
changes on AP performance.
We recognize limitations in our study.
Although we compared AP results to the
SAP run-in, this was a single-arm and un-
controlled study for the effects of AP as
well as the carbohydrate ratio and basal
rate adaptations. The AP period was also
much longer than the 1-week SAP run-in.
Remote monitoring was used to comply
with regulatory requirements in this early
feasibility study of an investigational de-
vice. In addition, regular study subject
contact occurred at least weekly regard-
ing the parameter updates as well as to
respond to any technical issues. The num-
ber of contacts with study subjects was

 not tracked; however, no known interven-
tions were required that were not already
underway to respond to hypoglycemia. In
addition, no care partner was required to
intervene on behalf of a study subject. Fi-
nally, the startingHbA1cof7% reflects that
the study patients were sophisticated
users, implying adherence with diabetes
management. Despite this, they showed
an improvement in HbA1c and a reduction
in hypoglycemia, similar to other studies
of an AP with adherent patients (36).
In conclusion, we found that outpatient
use of an AP system for 12 weeks, with
algorithmic adaptation and eventual opti-
mizationofinsulindeliveryparameters,has
the potential to deliver enormous benefits.
We have shown significant improvement
not only by change in HbA1c but also by
reduction of hypoglycemia. Continued
study of ways to improve adaptation of
AP systems is needed.
