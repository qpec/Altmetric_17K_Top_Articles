AbsTrACT
Objective to examine the associations between 
egg consumption and cardiovascular disease (cVD), 
ischaemic heart disease (ihD), major coronary events 
(Mce), haemorrhagic stroke as well as ischaemic stroke.
Methods During 2004–2008, over 0.5 million adults 
aged 30–79 years were recruited from 10 diverse 
survey sites in china. Participants were asked about the 
frequency of egg consumption and were followed up via 
linkages to multiple registries and active investigation. 
among 461 213 participants free of prior cancer, cVD 
and diabetes, a total of 83 977 cVD incident cases and 
9985 cVD deaths were documented, as well as 5103 
Mce. stratified cox regression was performed to yield 
adjusted hazard ratios for cVD endpoints associated 
with egg consumption.
results at baseline, 13.1% of participants reported 
daily consumption (usual amount 0.76 egg/day) and 
9.1% reported never or very rare consumption (usual 
amount 0.29 egg/day). compared with non-consumers, 
daily egg consumption was associated with lower risk 
of cVD (hr 0.89, 95% ci 0.87 to 0.92). corresponding 
multivariate-adjusted hrs (95% ci) for ihD, Mce, 
haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke were 0.88 
(0.84 to 0.93), 0.86 (0.76 to 0.97), 0.74 (0.67 to 
0.82) and 0.90 (0.85 to 0.95), respectively. there 
were significant dose-response relationships of egg 
consumption with morbidity of all cVD endpoints (P 
for linear trend <0.05). Daily consumers also had an 
18% lower risk of cVD death and a 28% lower risk of 
haemorrhagic stroke death compared to non-consumers.
Conclusion among chinese adults, a moderate level 
of egg consumption (up to <1 egg/day) was significantly 
associated with lower risk of cVD, largely independent of 
other risk factors.
InTrOduCTIOn
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading 
cause of death and disability worldwide, including 
China, mostly due to ischaemic heart disease (IHD) 
and stroke (including both haemorrhagic and isch-
aemic stroke).1 Unlike IHD, which is the number 
1 cause of premature death in most Western coun-
tries, stroke is the most responsible cause in China, 
followed by IHD. Although ischaemic stroke 
accounted for the majority of incident strokes, 
the proportion of incident haemorrhagic stroke 
in China was still higher than that in high-income 
countries (23.8% vs 9–13%).2 3
Modifiable factors, such as smoking, alcohol, 
physical inactivity and dietary factors, play crucial 
roles in the development of CVD, as do non-modi-
fiable factors such as age and sex. Eggs are a prom-
inent source of dietary cholesterol, but they also 
contain high-quality protein, many vitamins and 
bioactive components such as phospholipids and 
carotenoids.4 Previous studies have been incon-
sistent, and most of them observed insignificant 
associations between egg consumption and coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) or stroke.5 However, 
the Life Span Study in Japan found that daily egg 
consumption was associated with a 30% lower 
risk of total stroke mortality compared with very 
occasional (rare) consumption.6 These studies had 
relatively smaller sample sizes or fewer cases, were 
too low-powered to obtain precise effect estimates, 
and were unable to examine the associations with 
stroke subtypes, especially haemorrhagic stroke. 
Above all, they originated from Western and Japa-
nese populations, which have dietary habits and 
other lifestyle and CVD patterns that differ from 
the Chinese population. Dietary guidelines from 
the Chinese Nutrition Society recommend healthy 
adults consume 40–50 
g of egg (about 0.8–1 egg) 
per day, with particular emphasis on the egg yolk, 
and recently cancelled the upper limit of choles-
terol.7 Yet the amount of egg consumption has not 
improved over the past decade.8 Evidence about 
the relation between eggs and  cardiovascular 
health among Chinese adults is therefore urgently 
required.
Our study aimed to examine the associations of 
egg consumption with CVD, including IHD, major 
coronary events (MCE), haemorrhagic stroke and 
ischaemic stroke in the China Kadoorie Biobank 
(CKB) study, an ongoing prospective cohort of 
about 0.5 
million adults.

study population
The CKB study was a prospective cohort of 512 
891 
participants aged 30–79 years from 10 geograph-
ically diverse survey sites (five urban and five 
rural) across China; participants were recruited 
from 2004 to 2008 and have been followed up to 
determine their morbidity and mortality rates ever 
since. About 5% of the participants were selected 
randomly to join in the re-surveys every 5 
years 
after the completion of the baseline survey. Detailed

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
published.9 10 In the present study, we excluded individuals 
reporting medical histories of cancer (n=2577), heart disease 
(n=15 
472) or stroke (n=8884), or having prevalent diabetes 
(n=30 
300) defined by self-reported diabetes or on-site plasma 
glucose testing (fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 
mmol/L or random 
blood glucose ≥11.1 
mmol/L). We made these exclusions to 
avoid a prevalence–incidence bias and minimise the effect of 
reverse causality led by potential confounders such as lifestyle 
factors. We also excluded two individuals whose body mass 
index (BMI) values were missing, and one individual with an 
implausible censoring date. Overall, 461 
213 participants were 
eligible for the final analyses.
Both the Ethics Review Committee of the Chinese Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China) and the Oxford 
Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford 
(UK) have approved the CKB study. All participants signed 
informed consent forms before joining the study.
Assessment of egg consumption
At baseline, we administered a laptop-based questionnaire to 
participants about the frequency of their habitual egg consump-
tion during the previous 12 months at local clinics. Possible 
answers were daily, 4 to 6 days per week, 1 to 3 days per week, 
1 to 3 days per month, and never or rarely. To evaluate the 
reproducibility of the baseline questionnaire, 926 participants 
were randomly chosen and interviewed repeatedly within a year 
(mean interval 5.4 months). The age- and sex-adjusted Spearman 
correlation coefficient for egg consumption was 0.58. Similar 
questions were asked at the first and second re-survey (2008 and 
2013–14, respectively) and the amount was further provided 
during the second re-survey, which was used as a proxy to esti-
mate the usual amount for each category (see the online supple-
mentary material).
Assessment of covariates
We collected covariates from the baseline questionnaire, 
including sociodemographic characteristics (age at recruit-
ment, sex, education, household income, marital status), 
lifestyle behaviours (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, 
physical activity, intakes of multivitamin supplementation, 
rice, wheat products, other staple foods, meat, poultry, fish, 
dairy products, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh 
fruit and soybean products), medical history (hypertension, 
diabetes, use of antihypertensive drugs, as well as use of aspirin 
and statins among those with self-reported hypertension), and 
family history of heart attack and stroke. A family history 
of CVD was considered to exist if a participant reported at 
least one first-degree relative (including biological parents 
and siblings) as having a heart attack or stroke. Three dietary 
patterns were identified previously and named as new afflu-
ence, traditional southern and traditional northern dietary 
pattern, respectively.11
Trained staff measured body weight, height, waist and hip 
circumferences, and blood pressure using calibrated instruments. 
BMI was calculated from the body weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in metres (kg/m2). Waist to hip ratio 
was calculated from the waist circumference divided by the hip 
circumference. Prevalent hypertension was defined as self-re-
ported diagnosed hypertension, a measured mean systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) ≥140 
mm Hg, a measured mean diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) ≥90 
mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihyper-
tensive drugs.
Ascertainment of endpoints
Information on morbidity and mortality of all the participants 
was obtained regularly via local disease and death registries, 
checked against the national health insurance system with elec-
tronic linkage to all hospitalisations, or ascertained through 
active follow-up. Diseases were coded according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The 
primary outcomes were the incidence of and mortality from 
CVD (I00-I99), IHD (I20-I25), haemorrhagic stroke (I61) and 
ischaemic stroke (I63), as well as MCE, including fatal IHD 
death [I20-I25] and incident non-fatal myocardial infarction 
[I21-I23]).
statistical analysis
Logistic regression (for categorical variable) or multiple linear 
regression (for continuous variable) was conducted to compare 
age-, sex- and site-adjusted proportions or means of baseline 
characteristics by the frequency level of egg consumption.
We used stratified Cox proportional hazard models to esti-
mate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the associa-
tions between egg consumption and CVD, with stratification 
on survey site and birth cohort (in 5-year intervals) and with 
attained age as the underlying time scale. Person-years elapsed 
from completion of the baseline survey to the diagnosis of each 
CVD endpoint, death, loss to follow-up or 31 December 2015, 
whichever came first. The proportional hazard assumption was 
examined by testing the significance level of the interaction 
terms between egg consumption and time. The multivariate 
model was adjusted for age at recruitment (continuous), sex 
(men or women), education level (no formal school, primary 
school, middle school, high school, college, or university or 
higher), household income (<2500, 2500–4999, 5000–9999, 
10 
000–19 999, 20 
000–34 999, or ≥35 
000 
yuan/year), 
marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, or 
never married), alcohol consumption (not weekly; ex-regular; 
not daily; daily consuming 1–15, 15–29, 30–59 or ≥60 
g), 
tobacco smoking (never or occasional; former; current smoking 
with 1–14, 15–24, or ≥25 
cigarettes/day), physical activity in 
MET-hours/day (continuous), BMI (continuous), waist to hip 
ratio (continuous), prevalent hypertension (presence or absence), 
use of aspirin (presence, absence, or unknown), family history 
of CVD (presence or absence), intake of multivitamin supple-
mentation (presence or absence) and dietary pattern (new afflu-
ence, traditional northern, or traditional southern). We assigned 
the midpoint value to each frequency level and treated it as a 
continuous variable in the model to test the linear trend. The 
HR for each one egg increment per week was calculated with the 
usual amount of each frequency level in the model.
To examine the robustness of our results, we performed several 
sensitivity analyses: excluding cases or deaths occurring in the 
first 2 years of follow-up; additionally adjusting for daily energy 
intake12; additionally adjusting for the frequency levels of the 
other 11 food groups; adjusting for the dietary pattern without 
incorporating egg consumption, instead of the dietary pattern 
incorporating egg consumption; adjusting for simultaneous use 
of aspirin and statins instead of use of aspirin; adjusting for three 
levels of prevalent hypertension (absence, presence with anti-
hypertensive medication, or presence without antihypertensive 
medication) instead of two levels of prevalent hypertension. We 
also examined the associations between egg consumption and 
CVD among diabetic patients.
We performed stratified analyses according to prespecified 
baseline groups: sex, age, area, education level, household

Values (except for the usual amount) according to the frequency of egg consumption were either proportion or mean (SD) with adjustment for age at recruitment, sex and survey 
site where appropriate, using logistic regression (for categorical variables) or multiple linear regression (for continuous variables). These variables were categorised into three 
levels: highest education level (primary school and below, middle or high school, or college and above), household income (<10 000, 10 000–19 999, or ≥20 000) and dietary 
pattern (new affluence, traditional southern or traditional northern).

ined the significance of interaction by the likelihood ratio test, 
comparing models with and without interaction terms between 
the stratifying variable and egg consumption (as a multinomial 
variable). All statistical analyses were performed with Stata 
version 14.0. We set the statistical significance at two-tailed 
P<0.05.
resulTs
Among the eligible 461 
213 participants, the mean age was 
50.7 years; 41.0% were men; 42.3% resided in urban areas; 
about half of them consumed eggs 1–3 days per week. Partici-
pants consumed an average amount of 0.47 egg per day. Table 1 
shows age-, sex- and site-adjusted baseline characteristics of the 
participants by category of egg consumption. Compared with 
non-consumers (those who never or rarely consumed eggs), daily 
consumers were more likely to have a higher level of education 
and household income, to have a new affluence dietary pattern, 
and to take multivitamin supplementation. Daily consumers 
were less likely to have prevalent hypertension compared with 
non-consumers.
During a median follow-up of 8.9 years (IQR 2.15 years; total 
person-years 3.9 
million), we documented 83 977 CVD cases 
(including 30 169 IHD, 7078 haemorrhagic stroke, and 27 
745 
ischaemic stroke cases), 9985 CVD deaths (including 3374 IHD, 
3435 haemorrhagic stroke, and 1003 ischaemic stroke deaths), 
as well as 5103 MCE. After multivariate adjustment, inverse 
associations were found to be significant between egg consump-
tion and CVD (table 2). As compared with non-consumption, 
the adjusted HRs (95% 
CI) of daily consumption were 0.89 
(0.87 to 0.92) for CVD, 0.88 (0.84 to 0.93) for IHD, 0.86 
(0.76 to 0.97) for MCE, 0.74 (0.67 to 0.82) for haemorrhagic 
stroke, and 0.90 (0.85 to 0.95) for ischaemic stroke (all P for 
linear trend <0.05). Notably, each one egg increment per week 
was associated with an 8% lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke 
(HR 0.92, 95% 
CI 0.90 to 0.95). Similar associations were 
observed for CVD and haemorrhagic stroke mortality, with 
the HRs (daily consumption vs non-consumption) being 0.82 
(0.75 to 0.89) and 0.72 (0.62 to 0.84), respectively (table 3). Yet 
the inverse associations with mortality from IHD and ischaemic 
stroke were found to be insignificant.
After excluding the events that occurred in the first 2 years of 
follow-up, the associations hardly changed; or there was addi-
tional adjustment for daily energy intake; or additional adjust-
ment for the other 11 food groups; or adjustment for the dietary 
pattern without incorporating egg consumption, instead of the 
dietary pattern incorporating egg consumption; or adjustment 
for simultaneous use of aspirin and statins, instead of use of 
aspirin; or adjustment for three levels of prevalent hypertension, 
instead of two levels of prevalent hypertension (online supple-
mentary tables S2–4). Further analyses demonstrated that egg 
consumption was not associated with morbidity and mortality of 
any CVD endpoint among diabetic patients (online supplemen-
tary tables S15–16).
We conducted stratified analyses to examine whether the 
associations between egg consumption and CVD were modi-
fied by baseline characteristics. No significant interactions have 
been found across the stratum for age, alcohol consumption and 
physical activity (figure 1, online supplementary tables S6–14).

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
Figure 1 Subgroup analysis of associations between egg consumption and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischaemic heart 
disease (IHD), haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke according to potential baseline risk factors. Hazard ratios (HR) for incident CVD, IHD, 
haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke are for comparison between daily consumers and non-consumers. Solid squares represent point estimates, 
and horizontal lines represent 95% CI. Stratified Cox proportional models were used with stratification on survey site and birth cohort (in 5-year 
intervals). Multivariate models were adjusted for age at recruitment (continuous) and sex (men or women), education level (no formal school, 
primary school, middle school, high school, college, or university or higher), household income (<2500, 2500–4999, 5000–9999, 10 000–19 999, 
20 000–34 999 or ≥35 000 yuan/year), marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, or never married), alcohol consumption (not weekly; 
ex-regular; not daily; daily consuming 1–15, 15–29, 30–59 or ≥60 g), tobacco smoking (never or occasional; former; current smoking with 1–14, 15–
24 or ≥25 cigarettes/day), physical activity in MET-hours/day (continuous), BMI (continuous), waist to hip ratio (continuous), prevalent hypertension 
(presence or absence), use of aspirin (presence, absence or unknown), family history of CVD (presence or absence), intake of multivitamin 
supplementation (presence or absence) and dietary pattern (new affluence, traditional northern, or traditional southern). The tests for interaction 
were performed using likelihood ratio tests, which involved comparing models with and without interaction terms between the strata variable and 
egg consumption (as a multinomial variable). *Tests for interaction were significant, with the significant level being 0.05. BMI, body mass index; MET, 
metabolic equivalent task. 
Though significant interactions with sex were observed for 
incident CVD (P for interaction 0.005), the HRs were similar 
between men and women. We observed stronger associations 
with incident IHD among urban residents (P for interaction 
0.014) and with haemorrhagic stroke among rural residents (P 
for interaction 0.048). For incident CVD and IHD, the associ-
ations appeared to be greater among participants with normal 
BMI (24.0–28.0 
kg/m2) (P for interaction 0.005 and 0.046) or 
with traditional southern dietary pattern (P for interaction 0.031 
and <0.001). Significant differences across the stratum were 
found, with stronger associations among non-current smokers 
than smokers (P for interaction 0.004). For daily consumers, 
inverse associations seemed to be greater among those with 
higher education level for IHD and those with higher household 
income for ischaemic stroke.
dIsCussIOn
From this prospective cohort study, we found more frequent 
egg consumption was associated with CVD, IHD, MCE, haem-
orrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke, independent of potential 
confounders. Notably, daily consumers (up to <1 
egg/day) were 
associated with a 26% lower in risk of haemorrhagic stroke.
Results from our study have been inconsistent with previous 
studies. The latest meta-analysis included seven prospective 
studies and found that consumption up to one egg/day had 
no significant association with CHD (HR 0.97, 95% 
CI 0.88 
to 1.07), compared with consuming two eggs/week.5 In the 
present study, a 12% reduction in risk of IHD was observed for 
consuming eggs daily (estimated amount 5.32 eggs/week), with 
never or rare consumption (2.03 eggs/week) as the reference 
group. This discrepancy may result from smaller sample sizes, 
fewer identified cases or deaths, ethnic difference, and only 
adjusting for prior diabetes or blood glucose instead of excluding 
diabetic patients. Their results may be biased by the inclusion of 
diabetic patients, who may alter their dietary habits and have 
a greater risk of CVD than non-diabetic patients.13 Our study 
excluded individuals with prevalent diabetes and sensitivity anal-
yses further confirmed that the associations of interest appeared 
to attenuate null among diabetic patients.
The Life Span study in Japan documented 354 haemor-
rhagic stroke deaths and 655 ischaemic stroke deaths among 
15 
350 men (mean age 54 years) and 24 
999 women (mean age 
58 years) after 16 years of follow-up.6 They showed that the 
multivariate-adjusted HRs for total stroke mortality were 0.75 
(95% CI 0.55–1.01) for less than one time/week, 0.77 (95% CI 
0.57–1.03) for 2–4 times/week and 0.70 (95% CI 0.51–0.95) 
for almost daily consumption, compared with non-consumption 
(P for linear trend 0.185). Though another study from the Third 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 
III) found the inverse associations with stroke mortality, the

estimate (HR 0.27, 95% 
CI 0.10 to 0.73) for daily consumption 
was imprecise because of sparse data (74 deaths among 6833 men 
and 8113 women).14 Both of the studies above failed to present 
the associations with stroke subtypes. The Nurses’ Health Study 
and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study analysed the associ-
ations with both haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke and 
observed that the three middle quintiles of egg consumption 
were associated with reduced risk of ischaemic stroke (from 
low to high: 16%, 14%, and 20%, respectively) compared 
with the lowest quintile category (P for linear trend 0.360).15 
Other prospective studies did not observe similar associations 
between egg consumption and total stroke or any subtype.16 17 
In the present study, higher egg consumption was associated with 
reduced risk of both stroke subtypes and participants consuming 
less than one egg daily were at the lowest risk of haemorrhagic 
stroke and ischaemic stroke compared with non-consumers.
Indeed, eggs are a major source of dietary cholesterol. 
However, a recent systemic review demonstrated that though 
dietary cholesterol increased the level of serum total cholesterol 
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), it also elevated high-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) and the LDL to HDL ratio, and it had no estab-
lished causal effect on CVD risk.18 Our findings of the inverse 
associations implicated that other components from eggs could 
have a favourable effect on cardiovascular health. Egg-derived 
phospholipid can raise HDL levels and enhance HDL function 
via preferentially incorporating into HDL cholesterol particles,19 
further slowing down the progress of atherosclerosis.20 Likewise, 
high-quality egg protein resulted in greater satiety, lower post-
prandial glycaemia and insulinaemia, and reduced subsequent 
food intake in healthy and overweight individuals.21 22 Intake of 
eggs also increased plasma lutein and zeaxanthin,23 which play 
an important role in protecting against oxidation, inflammation 
and atherosclerosis.24 Notably, these two carotenoids derived 
from eggs had higher bioavailability than those derived from 
vegetables or fruits and promoted carotenoid absorption from 
other carotenoid-rich foods.25 26
The strengths of our study include a prospective cohort 
design, a large sample size, careful adjustment for established 
and potential risk factors for CVD, and the provision of more 
precise estimates for stroke subtypes. However, this study 
has some limitations. Egg consumption was obtained via a 
non-validated qualitative food frequency questionnaire and the 
average amounts were estimated indirectly from the two re-sur-
veys, but the estimated amount was similar to that reported by 
the Chinese Nutrition and Health Surveillance (2010–2012: 
0.49 egg).8 There is potential misclassification of egg consump-
tion due to recall issues, but this misclassification may be 
non-differential, causing the associations to attenuate toward 
the null. Lacking participants with consumption of more than 
one egg per day restricted us to assess the association between 
higher egg consumption (>1 
egg/day) and the risk of CVD; but 
the usual amount of the highest frequency level in the present 
study was approximate to the recommended amount of the 
guidelines (0.76 egg vs 0.8–1.0 egg), indicating that adher-
ence to the dietary guidelines with regard to egg consumption 
could result in a lower risk of CVD. Another disadvantage is 
that information on habitual egg consumption was collected 
once at the the baseline survey and might not necessarily reflect 
dietary habits over the follow-up. Reverse causality could bias 
the results as well. Participants may change their habitual egg 
consumption after developing major chronic diseases or having 
diseases or subclinical symptoms that predispose them to CVD. 
However, we excluded participants with prior major diseases. 
Further exclusions of those developing CVD in the first 2 
years 
of follow-up did not change the results appreciably. Finally, we 
controlled potential confounders to the best of our ability, yet 
residual confounding by other unmeasured or unknown factors 
may still exist.
COnClusIOns
Our findings suggested that daily egg consumption (<1 egg) was 
associated with lower risk of CVD, IHD, MCE, haemorrhagic 
stroke and ischaemic stroke among Chinese middle-aged adults. 
Our findings contribute scientific evidence to the dietary guide-
lines with regard to egg consumption for the healthy Chinese 
adult.
Key questions
What is already known on this subject?
 
► The effect of egg consumption on cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and stroke has been controversial. Previous studies 
mostly had smaller sample sizes, fewer CVD events and were 
unable to obtain accurate estimates on the associations of 
egg consumption with stroke subtypes.
What might this study add?
 
► This prospective cohort study of the general Chinese 
population demonstrated a significantly inverse association 
of egg consumption with CVD, ischaemic heart disease, 
haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, as well as major 
coronary events. In particular, daily egg consumers (up 
to <1 egg/day) had a 26% lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke, 
a stroke subtype with a higher prevalence rate in China than 
in high-income countries.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► The present study finds that there is an association between 
moderate level of egg consumption (up to <1 egg/day) and a 
lower cardiac event rate.
