Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous studies have shown
that the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide (GIP) that have anti-diabetic properties show very promising effects in animal models of
AD. Glucagon (Gcg) is a hormone and growth-factor, and the Gcg receptor is expressed in the brain.
Here we test the effects of a triple receptor agonist (TA), which activates GIP-1, GIP and glucagon recep-
tors at the same time. In the present study, the effects of the TA were evaluated in the APP/PS1 transgenic
mouse model of AD. The TA was injected once-daily (10 nmol/kg i.p.) for two months. The results showed
that treatment with TA significantly reversed the memory deficit in the APP/PS1 mice in a spatial water
maze test. Moreover, the drug reduced levels of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX,
increased the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule Bcl-2 and enhanced the levels of BDNF, a key growth fac-
tor that protects synaptic function. Levels of synaptophysin were enhanced, demonstrating protection
from synaptic loss that is observed in AD. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was furthermore enhanced
as shown in the increase of doublecortin positive cells. Furthermore, TA treatment reduced the total
amount of b-amyloid, reduced neuroinflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes), and oxidative
stress in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these findings show that novel TAs are a promising lead
for the design of future treatment strategies in AD.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is a progressive neurodegenerative
disease, characterized clinically by progressive memory loss, cog-
nitive decline, and aberrant behavior [1]. Currently, there is no
treatment can improve this condition. Epidemiological studies
have shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor
for Alzheimer disease (AD) (Luchsinger et al., 2004; Ohara et al.,
2011). The underlying mechanism is most likely that insulin sig-
naling is impaired in the brains of AD patients (Moloney et al.,
2010; Talbot et al., 2012). This motivated research in drugs that
have shown good effects in treating diabetes to investigate if they
could be helpful in treating AD as well. Previous studies have
shown that the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-
1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) can
play a neuroprotective role in the brain and show very promising
effects in animal models of AD (Duffy and Holscher, 2013; Faivre
and Holscher, 2013b; Li et al., 2010; McClean et al., 2011;
McClean and Holscher, 2014). Glucagon (Gcg) is a hormone and
growth-factor, and the Gcg receptor is expressed in the brain
(Hoosein and Gurd, 1984; Mayo et al., 2003). Activation of the
receptor can activate neuronal activity and cellular Ca2+ signaling
and may have neuroprotective properties (Ayush et al., 2015). Here
we test the effects of a triple receptor agonist (TA), which activates
GIP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors at the same time. This novel
drug has been developed as a potential treatment for diabetes
(Finan et al., 2015). No studies have been published that test the
neuroprotective effects of this novel drug. We therefore tested this
promising TA in the APPSWE/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD. This mouse
model recapitulates some of the hallmarks of AD, such as memory
loss, synaptic loss, reduction of synaptic plasticity, reduction of
neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, chronic inflammation in the
brain, and formation of amyloid plaques in the brain (Duffy and
Holscher,
2013;

 the effects of TA in this transgenic mouse model and evaluated the
neuroprotective effects. We analyzed memory formation, hip-
pocampal neurogenesis, the expression levels of Brain Derived
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) (Blurton-Jones et al., 2009), mitochon-
drial apoptosis signaling proteins, neuroinflammation and oxida-
tive stress levels.
2. Results
2.1. TA-treatment improved the learning and memory impairment of
APP/PS1 mice in the water maze
A two-way ANOVA found a significant difference between
groups (p < 0.0001) and over time (p < 0.001). In the Morris water
test, it was observed that the control mice, APP/PS1 mice and TA-
treated APP/PS1 mice had a similar escape latency (P > 0.05). On
day 5, the average escape distance in searching for the hidden plat-
form in the APP/PS1 mice was significantly longer than that in the
control mice (P < 0.05). Compared to the APP/PS1 group, the TA-
treated APP/PS1 group’s average escape distance was decreased
(P < 0.01). There was no difference in swimming speed among
these three groups in training days (P > 0.05).
Then on day 6, the platform was removed and the probe trail
test was conducted. A one way ANOVA analysis showed an overall
difference between groups. The APP/PS1 mice spent less time in
the target quadrant (P < 0.01) and had fewer times passing through
the original position of the hidden platform (P < 0.01), compared
with control mice. In the TA-treated APP/PS1 group, the time spent
in target quadrant (P < 0.05) and the frequencies to cross the plat-
form significantly increased (P < 0.05), compared to the APP/PS1
group Fig. 1.
2.2. TA-treatment ameliorated amyloid plaques in the brains of APP/
PS1 mice
In the immunohistochemical analysis, we analyzed the amount
of amyloid plaques present in the brains of APP-PS1 mice. A one-
way ANOVA found an overall difference on the amyloid deposits
in the cortex (F = 31.10, P < 0.0001) and the hippocampus (F =
30.38, P < 0.0001) of mice between groups. The Ab1-42 depositions
in the cortex and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice were signifi-
cantly higher than that in the control mice (P < 0.001), while TA-
treatment
group
significantly
decreased
the
deposition
(P <
0.001) compared to the APP/PS1 group. N = 6 per group. See Fig. 2.

 2.3. TA-treatment reduced the chronic inflammation response in the
cortex and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice
In the immunohistochemical analysis, an anti-GFAP antibody
was used as an indication of activated astrocytes. A one-way
ANOVA found an overall difference on the GFAP expression in
the cortex (F = 77.03, P < 0.0001) and the hippocampus (F = 86.51,
P < 0.0001) of mice between groups. The levels of GFAP in the cor-
tex and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice were significantly
higher than that in the control mice (P < 0.001), while TA-
treatment group significantly decreased (P < 0.001) compared to
the APP/PS1 group. N = 6 per group. See Fig. 3.
In the immunohistochemical analysis, an anti-IBA1 antibody
was used as an indication of microglia activation. A one-way
ANOVA found an overall difference on the IBA-1 expression in
the cortex (F = 28.71, P < 0.0001) and the hippocampus (F = 66.42,
P < 0.0001) of mice between groups. The levels of IBA-1 in the cor-
tex and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice were significantly
higher than that in the control mice (P < 0.001), while TA-
treatment group significantly decreased (P < 0.001, P < 0.01) com-
pared to the APP/PS1 group. N = 6 per group. See Fig. 4.
2.4. TA-treatment suppressed oxidative stress in the cortex and
hippocampus of APP /PS1 mice
In the immunohistochemical analysis, 4-HNE was measured as
an indicator of lipid peroxidation. A one-way ANOVA found an
overall difference on the 4-HNE expression in the cortex (F =
60.60, P < 0.0001) and the hippocampus (F = 35.22, P < 0.0001) of
mice between groups. The expressions of 4-HNE in the cortex
and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice were significantly higher
than that in the control mice (P < 0.001), while TA-treatment group
significantly decreased (P < 0.001) compared to the APP/PS1 group.
N = 6 per group, see Fig. 5a.
In the immunohistochemical analysis, 8-OHdG was measured
as an indicator of DNA oxidation. A one-way ANOVN found an
overall difference on the 8-OHdG expression in the cortex (F =
38.72, P < 0.0001) and the hippocampus (F = 56.60, P < 0.0001) of
mice between groups. The expressions of 8-OHdG in the cortex
and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice were significantly higher
than that in the control mice (P < 0.001), while TA-treatment group
significantly decreased (P < 0.01, P < 0.001) compared to the APP/
PS1 group. N = 6 per group, see Fig. 5b.
2.5. TA-treatment increased immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of
APP/PS1 mice
In the immunohistochemical analysis, numbers of neurogene-
sis, assessed by doublecortin (DCX). A one-way ANOVN found an
overall difference on the DCX positive cell in the dentate gyrus
(F = 43.61, P < 0.0001) of mice between groups. The numbers of
DCX were much reduced in the APP/PS1 mice (P < 0.001) compared
to the control mice. While TA-treatment partially prevented the
reduction (P < 0.001) compared to the APP/PS1 mice. N = 6 per
group. See Fig. 6.

 2.6. TA-treatment reversed the decrease of BDNF levels in the
hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice
BDNF, a key neurotrophic factor in the brain, was detected by
Western blot analysis. A one-way ANOVA found an overall differ-
ence between groups (F = 20.01, P < 0.001). The expression of BDNF
in hippocampus was reduced in APP/PS1 group (P < 0.001) com-
pared to the control group. TA-treatment reversed the decreased
(P < 0.05) compared to the APP/PS1 group. N = 6 per group. See
Fig. 7a.
2.7. TA-treatment reversed the reduction of synaptophysin levels
Synaptophysin (SYN), a synaptic markers, was detected by Wes-
tern blot analysis. A one-way ANOVA found an overall difference
between groups (F = 20.46, P < 0.001). The level of SYN in hip-
pocampus was decreased in the APP/PS1 group (P < 0.001) com-
pared to the control group. While TA-treatment prevent the
reduction (P < 0.01) compared to the APP/PS1 group. N = 6 per
group. See Fig. 7b.
2.8. TA-treatment showed potential anti-apoptotic effects by
decreasing the BAX/Bcl-2 ratio in APP/PS1 mice
The expression of apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 (that sup-
press apoptosis) and BAX (that promotes apoptosis), was detected
by Western blot analysis. A one-way ANOVA found an overall dif-
ference between groups (F = 77.64, P < 0.001). The ratio of BAX/Bcl-
2 in hippocampus was increased (P < 0.001) compared to the con-
trol group. While TA-treatment partly decreased the ratio of BAX/
Bcl-2 (P < 0.001) compared to the APP/PS1 group. N = 6 per group.
See Fig. 7c.
3. Discussion
The results demonstrate for the first time that the novel GLP-1/
GIP/Gcg receptor agonist has clear neuroprotective effects in the
APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Memory formation in the spatial
water maze task was improved by the drug, and the amyloid pla-
que load in the cortex and hippocampus was reduced. This result
confirms our previous findings that single GLP-1 or GIP analogues
can protect from memory loss in this mouse model of AD (Faivre
and Holscher, 2013a,b; McClean et al., 2011; McClean and
Holscher, 2014). The chronic inflammation response as seen in
the activation of microglia and astrocytes is much reduced by the
novel TA, similar to single GLP-1 or GIP receptor agonists (Duffy
and Holscher, 2013; Ji et al., 2016a; McClean et al., 2011). Levels
of the peroxidized lipid 4-HNE that also acts as a pro-apoptotic sig-
nal in mitochondria have been reduced by the TA. 4-HNE is one of
the markers of membrane lipid peroxidation induced by cytotoxic
radicals such as �OH. 4-HNE has cytotoxic, mutagenic and geno-
toxic properties and 4-HNE is reported to stimulate apoptosis via

 caspase 3 activation and by inducing mitochondrial damage as
shown in cytochrome c release (Ji et al., 2001). The levels of the
mitochondrial apoptosis signal BAX (Kim et al., 2005) were also
reduced. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule B-
cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) which is active in functioning mitochon-
dria
that
have
normal
inner
membrane
voltage
potentials
(Kavitha et al., 2013) is upregulated by the TA, adding to the neu-
roprotective effect. The level of chronic oxidative stress as measure
by the levels of the oxidized nucleotide 8-Hydroxiguanosine (8-
OHdG) was also reduced by the drug. Neurogenesis in the dentate
gyrus was normalized. Importantly, the levels of the key growth
factor BDNF were normalized in the brain. BDNF has shown clear
neuroprotective effects in a range of animal models of disease
(Allen et al., 2013; Benedetti et al., 2014; Blurton-Jones et al.,
2009; Nagahara et al., 2013). An important factor of BNDF activity
is that it maintains synaptic activity and protects synapses from
stressors (Kuipers and Bramham, 2006). The observation that the
synaptic marker synaptophysin was expressed at normal levels
after TA treatment also indicates that synaptic numbers and func-
tion was improved in the AD mouse. We have shown previously
that GLP-1 and GIP analogues protect synapses from amyloid
induced stress and keeps them functional (Faivre and Holscher,
2013b; Gault and Holscher, 2008a; Gault and Holscher, 2008b;
McClean and Holscher, 2014).
Recently, multiple receptor agonists have been developed to
treat type II diabetes (Finan et al., 2013, 2015). We have tested
novel dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists that showed good neuro-
protective effects that are superior to single GLP-1 analogues
(Cao et al., 2016; Jalewa et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2016b; Yuan et al.,
2017). The novel dual agonist DA3-CH was found to be superior
to liraglutide in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (Yuan
et al., 2017), demonstrating that the strategy of activating more
than one incretin receptor type offers an advantage over single
receptor agonists. Here, we show that a novel triple receptor ago-
nist also shows promise as a potential treatment for AD, but further
dose–response tests and direct comparisons with other drugs have
to be conducted in order to evaluate if this new drug is superior to
previous ones.
GLP-1, GIP and glucagon are members of the growth factor fam-
ily (Hölscher, 2016). Their respective receptors are classic 7-
membrane spanning domain, G-protein coupled receptors that
activate cAMP synthesis (Campbell and Drucker, 2013; Doyle and

 Egan, 2007; Holst et al., 2011). The activation of the second mes-
senger cascade cAMP-PKA-CREB induces a number of cytoprotec-
tive processes, including the normalization of energy utilization,
cell repair and growth-factor related gene expression (Holscher,
2014; Jalewa et al., 2016; Perry and Greig, 2004; Sharma et al.,
2013). Importantly, GLP-1 and GIP also have anti-inflammatory
properties. Astroglia and microglia express the receptors, and acti-
vating
these
reduce
the
inflammation
response
(Duffy
and
Holscher, 2013; Jalewa et al., 2017; Parthsarathy and Holscher,
2013; Spielman et al., 2017). Chronic inflammation is a main driver
of neurodegenerative disorders, and a reduction of the inflamma-
tion in the brain shows protective effects (Akiyama et al., 2000;
Clark et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2010).
Based on the impressive preclinical data that demonstrate neu-
roprotection of such drugs, clinical trials have started that investi-
gate the neuroprotective effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonists
exendin-4
(Byetta,
Bydureon�)
and
liraglutide
(Victoza�)
in
patients with AD or with Parkinson disease (PD). A pilot study test-
ing the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in AD patients showed promis-
ing results. In a double blind, placebo controlled trial, AD patients
showed no deterioration in brain activity as measured in the
18FDG-PET scan after 12 months of drug treatment. In contrast,
the placebo group showed clear reductions in cortical activity as
expected for this progressive neurodegenerative disease (Gejl
et al., 2016). A phase II clinical trial is currently ongoing
(Hölscher, 2016). A pilot trial testing exendin-4 in PD patients
has shown good effects (NCT01174810). This open-label study
tested the effects of exendin-4 in 45 patients. There were clear
improvements in the motor coordination as shown in the MDS-
UPDRS part 3 assessment, and cognition was improved as mea-
sured by the Mattis DRS-2 test battery that had been designed to
evaluate cognitive impairments in PD patients (Aviles-Olmos
et al., 2013). Patients were re-tested 12 months later, and the dif-
ferences in motor performance and cognitive scores were still vis-
ible (Aviles-Olmos et al., 2014). A phase II double-blind, placebo
controlled clinical trial that tested the once-weekly formulation
of exendin-4, Bydureon�, confirmed the results of the pilot study.
The drug group did not deteriorate in the MDS-UPDRS part 3
assessment after 48 weeks of treatment, and after 12 weeks of a
wash-out period, the disease-modifying effect was still visible. In
contrast, the placebo group deteriorated over time as would be
expected in this disease (Athauda et al., 2017). In addition, a phase
II trial testing liraglutide in PD patients has started, testing patients
in
a
double
blind,
placebo
controlled
trial
for
one
year
(NCT02953665). A further clinical trial testing the GLP-1 receptor
agonist Lixisenatide in PD patients is in planning.
These very promising preclinical and the first clinical outcomes
demonstrate the efficacy of these novel multiple receptor agonists
that originally were developed to treat type II diabetes, but have
shown consistent neuroprotective effects in several studies. In
the present study, the novel TA improved learning and memory,
reduce amyloid plaque load, chronic inflammation and oxidative
stress, as well as mitochondrial stress signaling, and improved
BDNF release and synaptic markers while normalising neurogene-
sis in the dentate gyrus. The novel triple GLP-1/GIP/Gcg receptor
agonist holds clear promise of being developed into a new treat-
ment for chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s
disease.
4. Materials and methods
4.1. Peptide and chemicals
The triple GLP-1/GIP/Gcg used in this study was synthesized by
China Peptides Co, Ltd. (Shanghai, China) to 95% purity. The iden-
tity and purity of the peptide was confirmed by reversed-phase
HPLC and characterized using matrix assisted laser resorption/ion-
ization time of flight (MALDI–TOF) mass spectrometry. The peptide
was stored in dry form and dissolved in double-distilled water con-
taining 0.9% NaCl2 before experiments. A Bi-cinchoninicacid (BCA)
protein assay kit was purchased from Apply gen Technologies Inc.
(Beijing, China). 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was purchased from
ZSGB-BIO Co. (Beijing, China). The primary antibodies recognizing
Ab1-42,
IBA-1,
BDNF,
4-Hydroxynonenal
(4-HNE),
8-
Hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), synaptophysin (SYN) and b-actin
were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The primary antibody
GFAP, Bcl-2, and BAX were obtained from Boster Biotechnology
(Wuhan, China). The primary antibody doublecortin (DCX) buy
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, biotinylated rabbit anti-goat
IgG, avidinbiotin peroxidase complex reagent was purchased from
Boster Biotechnology (Wuhan, China). All other reagents used in
the research were of analytical grade and of the highest quality
commercially available. The peptide sequence was as follows
(Finan et al., 2015):
HXQGTFTSDKSKYLDERAAQDFVQWLLDGGPSSGAPPPS
X = aminoisobutyric acid, K = cE-C16 acylation (with a C16 fatty
acid).
4.2. Animals and treatments
APP/PS1 transgenic mice were purchased from the Academy of
Military Medical Sciences (AMMS, China), were maintained in a
constant temperature (22 ± 1 �C) and humidity (relative 30%)
under a 12 h light/dark cycle in animal house. As well as age-
matched non-AD mice, which are wild-type animals as control.
When animals were 6 months of age, TA was dissolved in saline.
The dose was a once-daily injection of 10 nmol/kg body weight
ip. for two months. Injections were given in the morning (8:00
am). Control mice received equal volumes of saline solution. All
experimental procedures involving animals were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Shanxi Medical Univer-
sity and conform to the guidelines of National Institute of Health
(NIH) guideline (NIH publication No. 85-23. Revised 1985). They
were divided into three different groups (n = 12). (i): control group
treated with saline only; (ii): APP/PS1 group treated with saline
only; (iii): APP/PS1 group treated with TA. At the end of drug treat-
ments, measurements of behavioral change, neuronal damage,
oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were conducted.
4.3. Morris water maze test
The water maze test is a standard method for assessing learning
and memory in animals. The water maze (WM) task was per-
formed 5 days after two months intraperitoneal injection. The
apparatus was a circular, white painted pool (150 cm in diameter
and 60 cm in height) which was filled to a depth of 40 cm with
warm water at a temperature 23 ± 2 �C to avoid hypothermia,
and was surrounded by a white curtain around the pool. The pool
was divided into four quadrants with four starting locations, north
(N), east (E), south (S) and west (W), the starting quadrant was ran-
domly chosen. A perspex platform (diameter, 10 cm) was located
in a specific location during the acquisition trials and submerged
approximately 1.0 cm below the surface of the water. A video cam-
era was mounted directly above the pool to record the movement
and the trail of the mice. During the acquisition phase, each mouse
was subjected to four consecutive training trials on each day. The
mouse was gently placed in the water between the quadrants,
and allowed 60 s to search the hidden platform. If it failed to find
the platform within 60 s, it was guided to the platform and allowed
70
J. Tai et al. / Brain Research 1678 (2018) 64–74
 to remain there for 10 s. Training continued for 5 days. On the sixth
day, the hidden platform was removed and each mouse was
allowed to swim in the pool for 60 s. The mean time spent in all
four quadrants and the target area for searching the hidden plat-
form was recorded.
4.4. Brain tissue preparation
Half of the animals were decapitated after anesthetization with
ethyl carbamate, hippocampus tissues were immediately isolated
and stored at �80 �C for further investigations. The second half
of each group was used for immunohistochemistry analysis. Ani-
mals were perfused
intracardially
with saline and
cold 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h.
4.5. Immunohistochemistry
For DAB staining, fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin. Cor-
onal sections (5 lm thick) of the brains were cut on a Leica micro-
tome for immunohistochemistry. Paraffin was removed from the
tissue sections with xylene, and the sections were rehydrated in
graded ethanol solutions. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Antigen
retrieval was performed by heating in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for 10 min. After blocked with 5% BSA, sections were incu-
bated with the primary antibody for doublecortin (goat anti-DCX;
1:50), GFAP (rabbit anti-GFAP; 1:100), IBA-1 (goat anti-IBA1;
1:200), 4-Hydroxynonenal antibody (goat anti-4 HNE; 1:200) and
anti-8 Hydroxyguanosine antibody (goat anti-8 OHdG; 1:200) at
37 �C for 2 h. For the Anti-8 OHdG histology, enzymatic antigen
retrieval with 10 lm/ml proteinase K for 40 min at 37 �C was per-
formed. To detect amyloid deposits, the primary antibody was Ab1-
42 (rabbit anti-Ab1-42; 1:100), brain sections were pre-incubated
with 70% formic acid and incubated at 4 �C for 24 h. They were
rinsed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
IgG or biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG at 37 �C for 0.5 h and incu-
bated with the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex reagent at 37 �C
for 0.5 h. Samples were stained in DAB solution in the presence
of H2O2. All stained sections were viewed and photographed under
a Zeiss light microscope, and images were captured by Motic
Images Plus2.0ML software. The numbers of DCX positive neurons,
the areas of Ab1-42, GFAP, IBA-1, 4-HNE and 8-OHdG positive cells
were determined using Image-pro plus6.0 software. The software
counts objects that are defined in size and staining threshold by
the user. This automated process avoided user bias.
4.6. Western blot
The hippocampal tissues from mice was homogenized in ice
cold RIPA buffer (containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxy-
cholate) and PMSF (phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride). The homoge-
nate was centrifuged 12,000 rpm/min for 5 min at 4 �C before
taking the supernatant. Tissue containing 60 lg of protein was sep-
arated on 10–12% gradient Bis–Tris gel with molecular marker and
electrophoresed in running buffer at 120 mV for 90 min followed
by transfer to the PVDF membrane. Following protein transfer,
the membrane was washed in TBST (tris buffered saline with
0.05% Tween-20, pH 8) and blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 h. Then
incubated overnight at 4 �C with rabbit anti-synaptophysin (SYN)
(1:10,000), rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (1:400), rabbit anti-BAX (1:400), rab-
bit anti-BDNF (1:5000), after three washes in TBS further incuba-
tion for 2 h at room temperature with the HRP-labeled goat anti-
rabbit immunoglobulin (1:5000). In some cases, the blots were
stripped and reprobed with a rabbit anti-b-actin (1:5000) to ensure
equal sample loading. The bound antibodies were then visualized
by
ECL-enhanced
chemiluminescence
(Beyotime
Institute
of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Western
blot
images
were
captured
with
a
chemiluminescent imaging system (Sage Creation, Beijing, China).

4.7. Statistical analysis
The data were presented as the mean ± standard error of mean
(S.E.M.) and analyzed by one-way or two way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test using the software Prism 5
(Graph Pad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical significance
is defined as P < 0.05.
