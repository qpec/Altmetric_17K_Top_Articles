Summary
Background Multiple sclerosis is a degenerative inflammatory disease of the CNS characterised by immune-mediated 
destruction of myelin and progressive neuroaxonal loss. Myelin in the CNS is a specialised extension of the 
oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and clemastine fumarate can stimulate differentiation of oligodendrocyte 
precursor cells in vitro, in animal models, and in human cells. We aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of 
clemastine fumarate as a treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis.
Methods We did this single-centre, 150-day, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ReBUILD) 
in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis with chronic demyelinating optic neuropathy on stable immunomodulatory 
therapy. Patients who fulfilled international panel criteria for diagnosis with disease duration of less than 15 years 
were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via block randomisation using a random number generator to 
receive either clemastine fumarate (5·36 mg orally twice daily) for 90 days followed by placebo for 60 days (group 1), 
or placebo for 90 days followed by clemastine fumarate (5·36 mg orally twice daily) for 60 days (group 2). The primary 
outcome was shortening of P100 latency delay on full-field, pattern-reversal, visual-evoked potentials. We analysed by 
intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02040298.
Findings Between Jan 1, 2014, and April 11, 2015, we randomly assigned 50 patients to group 1 (n=25) or group 2 
(n=25). All patients completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was met with clemastine fumarate treatment, 
which reduced the latency delay by 1·7 ms/eye (95% CI 0·5–2·9; p=0·0048) when analysing the trial as a crossover. 
Clemastine fumarate treatment was associated with fatigue, but no serious adverse events were reported.
Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to document efficacy of a remyelinating 
drug for the treatment of chronic demyelinating injury in multiple sclerosis. Our findings suggest that myelin repair 
can be achieved even following prolonged damage.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory, autoimmune 
demyelinating disease of the CNS in which an adaptive 
immune response targets unknown CNS antigens 
resulting in oligodendrocyte damage and neurological 
dysfunction.1,2 Myelin is a specialised extension of the 
plasma membrane of oligodendrocytes that ensheathes 
axons and enables saltatory conduction of action 
potentials. Patients with multiple sclerosis with myelin 
injury exhibit impaired conduction of action potentials, 
which can manifest as neurological dysfunction in 
the affected pathway. Only terminally differentiated 
oligodendrocytes can form myelin and enwrap CNS 
axons.3,4 Newly differentiated oligodendrocytes have the 
capacity to remyelinate denuded axons, and a short-
term crucial window for myelination might exist at the 
time of differentiation.5 Despite the presence of oligo-
dendrocyte precursors in multiple sclerosis lesions,6–8 
remyelination is generally unsuccessful—and at best 
partial—after 
demyelinating 
injury 
in 
multiple 
sclerosis.9,10
Current treatments for multiple sclerosis block access 
of immune cells to their target tissue or otherwise 
suppress inflammatory injury, but do not fully prevent 
neuroaxonal degeneration and disability.11,12 No proven 
treatments are available to remyelinate or otherwise 
sustainably repair myelin-related injury.
Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is dependent on 
evidence of dissemination of lesions in time and space, 
meaning that previous demyelinating injury must be 
present at the time of diagnosis.2,13 Even at disease onset, 
many patients show evidence of myelin damage beyond 
the clinically salient lesion that brought them to medical 
attention. Furthermore, myelin disruption in multiple 
sclerosis extends to the normal appearing white matter 
outside of circumscribed lesions, especially in the later 
stages of disease.14 Chronic demyelination is believed to 
contribute to early axonal loss and resultant progressive 
disability.2,15,16
Whether or not remyelination can be achieved in 
chronically demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis 
remains an unanswered question. A binary, cell-specific,

functional screening method identified clemastine 
fumarate—a first generation antihistamine—as capable 
of 
inducing 
oligodendrocyte 
differentiation 
and 
myelination due to off-target antimuscarinic effects17 and 
was confirmed in a second independent screen.18 
Clemastine fumarate readily crosses the blood–brain 
barrier and has been available over the counter in the 
USA since 1992. Preclinical work validated the efficacy of 
clemastine fumarate in vitro and in animal models.17,19 
Additional work confirmed the efficacy of clemastine 
fumarate in multiple animal models17–22 and showed that 
this benefit was mediated specifically via remyelination 
induced from oligo 
dendrocyte differentiation and not 
via effects on the immune system.19 We furthermore 
showed the capacity of clemastine fumarate to induce 
oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation 
and myelination with human OPCs (appendix).
Evoked potentials record cortical responses to a 
repetitive stimulus and can measure the speed of 
conduction in the CNS. Myelinated axons conduct 
electrical signals at 70–100 times the speed of un-
myelinated axons of the same diameter. Pattern-reversal 
visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) record cortical responses 
on the scalp overlying the occipital lobe in response to an 
alternating repetitive visual stimulus.23,24 Nearly all 
patients with multiple sclerosis ultimately exhibit 
demyelinating damage to the anterior visual pathway25 
and detection of prolongation of VEP latency has been 
used as supportive evidence to help confirm a clinical 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.24,26
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed articles published until Jan 10, 2017, 
without language restrictions reporting on remyelinating trials 
and treatments for multiple sclerosis. In our search, we used 
the terms “multiple sclerosis” OR “MS” OR “optic neuropathy” 
OR “visual evoked potential” OR “clemastine” AND 
“remyelination” initially filtering results for articles that report 
phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical trials. In addition, abstracts were 
reviewed from the American Academy of Neurology Meeting 
(AAN) and European Committee on Treatment in Multiple 
Sclerosis between 2006 and 2016. No previously successful 
randomised controlled trials using a remyelinating drug to 
treat a chronic demyelinating injury were reported. A number 
of clinical trials for acute relapses that principally focused on 
optic neuritis were identified, including one that assessed 
visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) as a secondary endpoint in a 
trial comparing simvastatin with placebo. This trial reported 
positive results in an intention-to-treat analysis but mismatch 
in severity was significant between the two groups, with the 
placebo group having more severe injury at baseline than the 
treated group. A successful phase 2 clinical trial of intravenous 
erythropoietin displayed improved VEP latency at 4 months as 
a secondary outcome in the treated group. In addition, a trial 
(RENEW) of opicinumab, a monoclonal antibody to inhibit 
LINGO 1, failed on its primary outcome in an intention-to-treat 
analysis, but showed apparent benefit in a per-protocol 
analysis. A second phase 2b study (SYNERGY) of opicinumab in 
patients with relapsing and secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis did not reach its primary endpoint: a multicomponent 
measure that evaluated improvement of physical function, 
cognitive function, and disability. An additional trial of 
intravenous immunoglobulin did not show a beneficial effect 
for VEP. A clinical trial that showed efficacy for neuroprotection 
with phenytoin in acute optic neuritis using optical coherence 
tomography peripapillary nerve fibre as an outcome did not 
show effects on VEP latency. In addition, two observational 
studies that monitored patients with multiple sclerosis showed 
that patients had worsening or stable P100 latency on VEP 
rather than spontaneous improvement, and one concluded 
that this would therefore make a good biomarker for 
measurement in remyelinating clinical trials. Additional 
observational and animal studies suggested that VEPs showed 
promise as putative measures of both demyelination and 
remyelination in multiple sclerosis and animal models of 
demyelinating injury.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to establish the 
safety and efficacy of clemastine fumarate in patients with 
multiple sclerosis and to show a benefit from clemastine 
fumarate on VEP latency. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is 
also the first successful trial to use a drug with substantial 
preclinical evidence to suggest a remyelinating effect that met 
its clinical endpoint with an intention-to-treat analysis and to 
show the effect of remyelinating therapy on chronic 
demyelination. Treatments capable of remyelination, 
neuroprotection, or regeneration are a major unmet need for 
multiple sclerosis and other diseases that involve myelin 
damage, loss, or dysfunction in the CNS. In the ReBUILD study, 
electrophysiological evidence of remyelination is seen in the 
context of a therapy with strong preclinical data, which 
suggests potential human efficacy. Furthermore, there is 
preliminary evidence to suggest that this effect might extend 
to low-contrast letter acuity—a well validated outcome 
of clinically relevant visual function in patients with 
multiple sclerosis.
Implications of all available evidence
Our results lend support to the further investigation of the safety 
and efficacy of clemastine fumarate in patients with acute 
demyelinating injury and other forms of chronic demyelination. 
They also provide evidence that supports further investigation to 
optimise timing and dosing of clemastine fumarate, and to 
assess its effects in other pathways of the CNS. Furthermore, this 
study suggests that the visual system is an attractive model for 
studying repair and remyelination in the setting of chronic 
demyelination.

We did a phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of 
clemastine fumarate for remyelination in a state of chronic 
demyelination, evaluate the safety and tolerability profile 
for clemastine fumarate in patients with multiple sclerosis, 
and use a small molecule with well validated remyelinating 
potential to assess the responsiveness of putative, yet not 
validated, outcomes intended to measure remyelination.
Methods
Study design and participants
Before the study, preclinical work was done, which 
included generation of induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs) and culture and OPC differentiation from iPSCs 
(appendix). We did this double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ReBUILD) at the 
University of California, San Francisco (San Francisco, 
CA, USA). Clinically stable patients with relapsing 
multiple sclerosis who fulfilled international panel criteria 
for diagnosis13 with disease duration of less than 15 years 
were eligible for screening. Although a previous clinically 
evident optic neuritis was not a requirement for 
enrolment, patients could not have had a clinical optic 
neuritis in the 6 months before screening or a docu-
mented optic neuritis in the qualifying eye for more than 
5 years before screening. We designed inclusion criteria to 
ensure that patients had demyelinating injury in the visual 
pathway (VEP P100 latency in at least one eye of 118 ms) 
and to increase the likelihood that the number of surviving 
axons was sufficient to provide the needed substrate for 
remyelination to occur (approximated by retinal nerve 
fibre layer thickness on spectral-domain optical coherence 
tomography [OCT] >70 µm in the VEP qualifying eye). 
Exclusion criteria included confounding ophthalmological 
disease that could affect vision or testing, changes in 
immunomodulatory therapy for multiple sclerosis in the 
6 months before being randomly assigned, glucocorticoid 
use within 30 days before screening, concurrent use of 
4-aminopyridine or fam 
pridine,27 or serological evidence 
of vitamin B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism.
A Food and Drug Administration Investigational New 
Drug exemption was granted (on Oct 31, 2013; reference 
number 3398780) to investigate clemastine fumarate as a 
remyelinating medication for the treatment of multiple 
sclerosis. The study was approved by the UCSF Insti-
tutional Review Board and all participants provided 
informed consent. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.
gov (number NCT02040298) before initiation of patient 
enrolment. 
Randomisation and masking
We randomly assigned patients to either group 1 (active 
treatment over the first 90 days followed by placebo for 
60 days) or group 2 (placebo for 90 days, followed by active 
treatment for 60 days) without a washout between the two 
periods. The differing length of the two epochs was 
intended to help determine if any difference in efficacy 
was based upon variation in exposure time.
The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF; 
San Francisco, CA, USA) investigational pharmacy 
randomly assigned (1:1) the patients (via block 
randomisation using a random number generator), and 
all patients and investigators were masked to group 
assignment for the duration of the trial, including the 
evaluation of all data and outcomes such as determination 
of VEP quality and final assignment of P100 latencies. 
Patients were reminded at each visit not to take any 
supplementary clemastine fumarate (or Tavist) and were 
asked if they had taken any added clemastine fumarate 
(no patients replied “yes”).
Procedures
Medication was provided as unmarked blue capsules of 
5·36 mg clemastine fumarate (Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, 
Sellersburg, PA, USA) or placebo (corn starch; Medisca, 
Plattsburgh, NY, USA) by the UCSF investigational 
pharmacy. When on the active treatment, patients received 
5·36 mg orally twice daily (10·72 mg/day). 
We recorded monocular transient full-field pattern-
reversal VEPs with check size 64-min of arc with a 
Nihon-Kohden MEB-2300 (Nihon-Kohden, Irvine, CA, 
USA). At least 100 averages were obtained per recording. 
VEPs were done at screening, baseline, and months 1, 3, 
and 5. VEP latency was defined by the P100. We averaged 
recordings from baseline and screening for comparison 
with final outcomes. We analysed VEP recordings for 
quality before unmasking and those recordings of 
insufficient quality to unequivocally identify the P100 
were discarded before analysis. Investigators not involved 
in the clinical assessment of patients or acquisition of 
data assessed VEP quality and marking of P100 latency 
and were masked to any assignment information in 
batch at completion of the study.
For MRI analysis, all participants were scanned using a 
Siemens 3T Skyra scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) 
equipped with a 20-channel head-neck coil and a 32-channel 
spine coil array at baseline, and months 3 and 5. Sequences 
included myelin water fraction (MWF), magnetisation 
transfer ratio (MTR), and diffusion MRI.
To evaluate visual function, we assessed high-contrast 
and low-contrast visual acuity monocularly with 
retro-illuminated 100% and 2·5% Sloan low-contrast 
vision charts, respectively (Precision Vision, La Salle, 
IL, USA). We recorded the number of letters the 
patients reported correctly and used this number 
for analysis.28
Evaluating clinicians masked to all other assessments 
did standardised clinical assessments, including the 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), timed 
25-foot walk (T25FW), and 6-min walk test (6MWT).
OCT (Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, 
Germany) of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer 
(RNFL) was done using a high-resolution ring B-scan 
3 mm around the disc (target ART 10 and signal 
strength 25).

Outcomes
The primary outcome was shortening of P100 latency 
delay on full-field, pattern-reversal VEPs. With the 
following ranking, based on the presumed relative 
importance of these secondary endpoints, whole brain 
MTR, white matter MTR, white matter fractional 
anisotropy (FA), and MWF were secondary imaging 
endpoints for efficacy. Additional assessments included 
standard T1 (both before and after administration of 
gadolinium) and T2 at all timepoints (appendix). The 
principal functional secondary endpoint was low-contrast 
letter acuity (LCLA). We also assessed change in RNFL 
thickness from baseline as an exploratory endpoint at 
months 3 and 5.
Adverse events were recorded at each visit. We obtained 
safety laboratory measures including transaminases, 
triglycerides, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone 
concentrations at each visit. We assessed cognition with 
the symbol digit modality test (SDMT) that is sensitive to 
both cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis29 and 
cognitive dysfunction associated with excessive anti-
cholinergic treatment in the elderly.30 We assessed 
fatigue via the multidimensional assessment of fatigue 
(MAF) scale.31,32
Statistical analysis
We did a power analysis before starting the trial, modelled 
on the parallel group portion of the trial looking at the 
3-month outcome. We estimated that the sample size of 
25 patients per group would give 90% power to detect a 
50% relative reduction in latency with clemastine 
fumarate compared with placebo at the 3-month 
timepoint. We analysed data with both a prespecified 
analysis plan appropriate for a repeated-measures 
crossover trial and by evaluating the trial post hoc as a 
delayed-treatment trial. We considered p values less than 
0·05 to be significant. We used an intention-to-treat 
approach including all patients randomly assigned to the 
study. Missing outcome data were accounted for using 
mixed-effects linear models. For the principal analysis, 
we analysed the 30 day, 90 day (epoch 1), and 150 day 
(epoch 2) bivariate (left and right eye) measurements 
using mixed-effects linear regression. The crossover 
model included random effects for patient and for eyes 
within patient, and fixed-effects for the standard analysis 
of a 2 × 2 crossover model (an indicator for epoch 2 and an 
indicator for the active-treatment period) with additional 
adjustment for the baseline value. To mitigate the 
carryover effect and to optimally estimate the magnitude 
of the therapeutic effect, we did a parallel group 
comparison considering group 2 as subject to delayed 
treatment. In our primary analytical approach per the 
crossover analysis, the clemastine fumarate first group 
(group 1) was considered to be in the treatment group at 
months 1 and 3, and in the control group at month 5, 
whereas the placebo first group (group 2) was considered 
to be in the control group at months 1 and 3 and in 
the treatment group at month 5 (and both groups 
were control group at baseline). This crossover analysis 
regards the effect of clemastine fumarate as transitory, 
lasting only while the active drug is being given, whereas 
the post-hoc delayed-treatment analysis regards each 
group as having a before and after clemastine fumarate 
period, with the assumption that the effect of the drug is 
persistent throughout the timeframe of the study. We also 
did an additional post-hoc analysis evaluating the 
frequency of patients who showed significant evidence of 
VEP latency improvement from baseline, which was 
defined as more than 6 ms of improvement consistent 
with laboratory standards and previous scientific 
literature. This analysis was done before review of the 
data, but was not initially specified in our protocol. 
Additional sensitivity analyses excluded the 30-day 
measurement as a repeated measurement in period 1 
(90 days), as well as modelling the time change linearly to 
account for the differential exposure to treatment in 
period 1 and period 2 (60 days; appendix). We compared 
the means of continuous variables with t tests and 
frequencies of categorical variables with χ² tests. We 
averaged the values for variables with both screening 
and baseline values for subsequent comparison. An 
independent faculty analyst (WJB) did all analyses with 
Stata version 13.

Results
Between Jan 1, 2014; and April 11, 2015, we randomly 
assigned 50 patients to group 1 (n=25) and group 2 (n=25; 
figure 1). The enrolled patients had an average age of 
40·1 years (SD 10·3), mean mild disability with 
EDSS 2·2 (1·1), and mean disease duration of 5·1 years 
(5·1; table). Eyes with baseline RNFL thickness smaller 
than 70 µm in the non-qualifying eye were excluded as 
prespecified. Furthermore, VEPs for which a reproducible 
P100 was not identified were excluded from analysis 
(constituting 29 [6%] of 480 recordings), and therefore, 
94% of all VEP recordings were included. 93 eyes were 
informative for the final trial outcomes after considering 
these exclusions. All patients who were randomly assigned 
attended all visits and completed the trial (figure 1).
28 patients (56%) had a previous history of optic 
neuritis at an average of 4·3 years before enrolment 
(table). Baseline characteristics in terms of disability, 
VEP P100 latency, OCT measures, and other functional 
assessments were similar between the groups (table).
No clinical relapses occurred during the trial. 46 (92%) 
of the 50 patients were on immunomodulatory disease 
modifying therapy: 20 on injectable, 16 on oral, and ten 
on high-potency infusible therapies. No patient had a 
change in immunomodulatory therapy during the course 
of the trial. No interaction for any of the therapies was 
seen on any of the outcomes, but the trial was not 
powered to detect such interactions.
Patients in both groups exhibited shortening of 
P100 latency while on the active compound. The 
primary prespecified efficacy endpoint for the trial 
was met with reduction of latency delay of 1·7 ms/eye 
(95% CI 0·5–2·9; p=0·0048) in the crossover model. 
The clinical effect observed for group 1 was also 
sustained into the second epoch (figure 2). Given this 
sustained effect the so-called no-carryover assumption of 
the standard crossover model led to a substantial 
underestimate of the magnitude of the therapeutic 
effect of clemastine fumarate. Therefore, a delayed-
treatment model was also assessed post hoc, showing a 
3·2 ms reduction in VEP latency delay per eye (1·8–4·7; 
p=0·0001) while on therapy. Furthermore, 16% of 
group 1 and 26% of group 2 showed a latency 
improvement of more than 6 ms while on treatment 
compared with 3% of group 1 and 6% of group 2 while 
on placebo (figure 2) in a post-hoc analysis done based 
on lab standards of significant interocular differences 
and previous scientific literature.33,34 Patients also showed 
evidence of improvement in LCLA for the period on 
treatment, with an increase of 0·9 letters per eye (95% CI 
–0·1 to 1·9; p=0·085; figure 3) using the crossover 
analysis; however, this observation did not meet the 
prespecified threshold of statistical significance. An 
additional post-hoc analysis done by assessing the LCLA 
outcome with the delayed-treatment model suggested 
an increase of 1·6 letters per eye (0·2 to 3·0; p=0·022). 
No effects of age, sex, disease duration, or previous 
history of clinical optic neuritis were detected.
Groups at baseline did not differ with regards to any of 
the non-visual functional or MRI metrics (table). None of 
the predefined MRI measures, including new and 
enlarging T2 lesions, volume of gadolinium-enhancing 
lesions on T1, MWF, MTR, or FA on diffusion tensor 
imaging showed evidence of improvement or worsening 
while on study drug (appendix) either using the crossover 
or delayed-treatment analyses. The two groups did not 
differ in processing speed on study drug, as assessed by 
the SDMT. Additionally, EDSS, T25W, and 6MWT were 
unchanged by treatment with clemastine fumarate 
(appendix).
Serious adverse events did not occur during the trial. 
Few adverse events were reported: a modest worsening 
of fatigue from baseline across both cohorts for the 
period on treatment versus the period off treatment 
based on the MAF assessment (p=0·017). Given the 
potential for participant unmasking as a consequence of

fatigue, we did additional analyses to determine whether 
the primary trial result remained significant after 
controlling for fatigue. Controlling for fatigue had no 
effect on either the magnitude or statistical significance 
of the VEP or LCLA results (appendix). One patient had 
to modify dosing and timing of clemastine fumarate as a 
result of severe fatigue. Furthermore, a small number of 
patients exhibited increases in triglyceride concentrations 
over the course of the trial; however, this outcome had no 
discernible association to treatment.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this clinical trial in conjunction with 
published preclinical evidence related to clemastine 
fumarate and remyelination provides the first evidence 
of drug-induced repair in a chronic neurodegenerative 
condition. Preclinical data unequivocally showed that 
clemastine fumarate promotes oligodendrocyte pre-
cursor differentiation17,18 and remyelination19–22 without 
modulating the immune system.19 The robustness of the 
findings were documented by the latency improvement 
observed in both groups of the cohort while on active 
treatment. Furthermore, the sustained clinical response 
in the first epoch provides evidence that the observed 
improvement was not due to a transient effect of 
medication on electrical conductance but rather reflects a 
persistent structural change induced by treatment. 
Previous studies (NCT02040298)35 suggested that drugs 
that target the immune system or paranodal potassium 
channels might reduce VEP latency.
To show functional repair and regeneration over short 
timescales in phase 2 clinical trials is challenging in 
a multifocal, stochastic disease of the CNS, such as 
multiple sclerosis, because of the wide variety of deficits 
that can be encountered. The simplification of the 
phenotype being studied by selecting patients on the 
basis of shared clinical deficits in an isolated functional 
pathway allowed for assessment of efficacy using a single 
clinical outcome. The visual pathway was selected as a 
suitable model for assessment because of its anatomical 
segregation and the precision of the clinical tests 
available for visual assessment.23,26,28 The visual system 
almost universally exhibits injury in people with multiple 
sclerosis.25,36 This trial highlights the value of this model 
for assessment of remyelination treatments in the 
chronic disease setting. We included patients who did 
not have a previous history of optic neuritis. A post-hoc 
analysis evaluating the history of optic neuritis showed 
the robustness of the effect of clemastine fumarate 
(despite the reduction in the size of the stratified sample) 
but could be taken to suggest that patients with a previous 
clinical episode of optic neuritis might have had a more 
pronounced response (appendix).
Optimal trial design and analytical methods for early 
phase studies to assess drugs with potential for 
remyelination and repair have not been determined—
especially for over-the-counter medications. The crossover 
trial design helped to establish the sustainability of the 
clinical benefit of clemastine fumarate and enhanced the 
power of the study to detect an effect in a relatively small 
population. Furthermore, it made recruitment for a trial 
with a non-prescription medication possible because all 
patients were granted access to the study drug. However, 
the standard statistical approach for analysing crossover 
study data includes an assumption that there is no 
carryover of treatment effect—ie, any benefit from earlier 
clemastine fumarate treatment is not sustained during the 
control epoch. This assumption did not hold in this study,

which points to the potential reparative effect of the 
medication. However, the magnitude of the benefit of 
clemastine fumarate in this model is estimated on the 
basis of this assumption of no carryover. Thus, a standard 
crossover analytical approach underestimates the true 
magnitude of the therapeutic effect because it falsely 
discounts the sustained benefit in epoch 2 for group 1. The 
benefit of clemastine fumarate treatment on VEP latency 
showed substantial carryover (ie, the improvement in 
latency plateaus and persists after cessation of treatment 
which—given the goal of structural repair—is a desirable 
outcome). Furthermore, greater improvements in latency 
for group 2 patients than for group 1 patients were seen 
during their period on treatment; however, given the 
assumption about no carryover, the primary analysis 
underestimates the contribution of this effect (as the 
sustained group 1 benefits are compared with the group 2 
benefits on treatment). Therefore, an assessment of the 
study results as a delayed-treatment trial provides an 
accurate estimate of the magnitude of the therapeutic 
effect. We have presented both methods of analysis to 
show that a treatment effect is observed using either 
analytical method. However, we consider the delayed-
treatment analysis to provide a more realistic appraisal of 
the magnitude of the therapeutic benefit achieved with 
clemastine fumarate at this dose. Additionally, in a 
post-hoc analysis that evaluated the VEP data using a 6 ms 
improvement threshold (which, based on experience and 
previous literature,33,34 would not be anticipated to be due to 
measurement error), clemastine fumarate treatment 
out 
performed placebo in both periods of the trial.
Given the absence of measurable difference in efficacy 
between the two groups (which had different lengths of 
exposure to the active compound), we cannot determine 
the optimal length of exposure to clemastine fumarate or if 
additional benefits would be seen with longer exposure. In 
fact, a modestly greater magnitude of effect was observed 
in group 2, but the significance of this observation cannot 
be determined because it could be due to baseline 
differences between the groups that were not balanced by 
randomisation. In addition, although the sustained clinical 
response of group 1 indicates that the clinical effect is not 
transient, whether the clinical response is maintained over 
the long term (ie, longer than 2 months) is uncertain.
This trial provides a framework for future assessments 
of remyelinating therapies for patients with multiple 
sclerosis. In particular, these results indicate that evoked 
potentials are a promising and sensitive measure of 
putative remyelination with effective drugs. The trial also 
supports the potential clinical benefit of adding a 
remyelinating drug in stable patients on a pre-existing 
immunomodulatory therapy.
Patients showed evidence of improvement in LCLA 
performance that did not meet our prespecified standard 
for statistical significance using the crossover analysis. 
However, when analysed with the delayed-treatment 
model, improvements in LCLA reached statistical 
significance. LCLA is the best-assessed and most well 
validated functionally relevant psychophysical clinical 
trial outcome for multiple sclerosis.26,29 This clinical 
effect was confounded by a learning effect observed for 
LCLA assessments over the course of the trial. This 
made detection of clinical effects of the drug more 
difficult. Future investigations might seek to use 
additional tests of visual function to help further resolve 
the clinical effect of treatment.
Preselected MRI measures were unable to detect 
biological effects. In general, these measures exhibited 
greater variability than is optimal for clinical trial 
outcomes. Future studies looking at MRI metrics might 
need to increase the frequency of assessments to reduce 
variability and enhance the ability to detect a response. 
Additional evaluation of our MRI results to assess for 
novel or promising new ways to analyse the data will be 
the subject of further study.
Patients in the trial showed worsened fatigue on the 
basis of MAF while on treatment. Fatigue is reported as a 
symptom in 65–95% of patients with multiple sclerosis. 
As many as 40% of patients report that it is the 
most disabling symptom of their disease.37 We cannot 
determine if this fatigue effect is due to action on the 
target muscarinic receptor or might reflect effects on 
other receptors, such as histamine receptors. Clemastine 
fumarate is well known to have antagonistic effects on 
a wide variety of membrane-bound G-protein-coupled 
neuro 
transmitter receptors.38 Furthermore, animal experi-
ments indicate that at our selected dose we only achieved 
partial saturation of the target muscarinic receptor (data 
not shown; dose adjusted). Non- 
selective drugs with 
anticholinergic effects have been suggested to have 
anticognitive effects in uncontrolled studies in patients 
with multiple sclerosis.39 A significant anticognitive effect 
was not observed in this trial at doses exceeding existing 
standard recommendations.
A limitation of the current trial is that it cannot 
ascertain whether the potential remyelinating effects of 
clemastine fumarate are sustained beyond the period of 
study, nor can it assess if continued dosing of clemastine 
fumarate would yield continued benefits. It cannot be 
used to assess whether higher doses would provide 
enhanced beneficial effects and it certainly cannot 
evaluate the risks of such higher or alternative dosing 
regimens. We also could not establish if the effects seen 
in the visual system might reflect that this pathway is 
more amenable to repair than others, nor given the size 
of the study could we fully evaluate if certain patient 
characteristics are most likely to be associated with the 
observed benefits.

progression, identify the extent of repair that is achievable 
with more selective and targeted drugs, and define the 
optimal dosing regimens and duration of treatment. 
Additional preclinical work should address the specificity 
of VEP latency changes in animal models using 
drugs such as clemastine fumarate for remye 
lination. 
Furthermore, we will need to determine optimal timing 
of treatment by evaluation of other stages of disease, 
such as following acute demyelinating injury. This work 
shows that remyelination and repair are promising goals 
for medical therapeutics in multiple sclerosis.

iPSC generation and culture: Human iPSCs were generated from postnatal patient fibroblasts 
obtained under approval from UCSF Institutional Review Board (IRB). iPSC clones were 
established by electroporation of a CoMiP episomal vector containing 4 reprogramming factors 
(Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc) following a published protocol. S1 The patient carried a mutation, 
which was corrected to wildtype sequence by gene targeting. iPSCs were maintained on CF1 
MEF feeder cells in ES medium containing Knockout DMEM/F12, 20% knockout serum 
replacement, non-essential amino acids, Glutamax (Thermo Fisher), and 10 ng/ml human basic 
FGF (Peprotech). Pluripotency was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of Tra1-60 (Cell 
Signaling) and Oct3/4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as well as teratoma formation and 
differentiation into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm lineages. A normal karyotype was 
confirmed. 
 
OPC differentiation from iPSCs and clemastine treatment: A previously published protocol 
for directed iPSC differentiation to OPCs was used with the following modifications S2-S3 human 
ES medium and human ES medium without basic FGF were used in place of mTeSR and 
custom mTeSR, respectively. The concentration of SAG was 0.5 uM, T3 40 ng/ml, and NT3 1 
ng/ml. Penicillin-Streptomycin was omitted from N2 medium, HGF from PDGF medium, and 
HEPES from Glia medium. On day 0, iPSCs were plated at 0.25x106 cells/well in a matrigel-
coated 6-well plate with ES medium without basic FGF, supplemented with dual SMAD 
inhibitors, RA, and ROCK inhibitor thiazovivin (Santa Cruz). From day 1 to day 4, N2 medium 
was gradually increased by 25% each day, reaching 100% on day 4. On day 8, dual SMAD 
inhibitors were replaced with SAG. On day 12, cells were lifted, dissociated, and seeded onto 
petri dishes for sphere formation. On day 20, the medium was changed to PDGF-containing 
medium. On day 30, spheres were plated on poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated dishes. On day 45,

medium was changed to Glial medium to initiate differentiation. Cells were exposed to 
clemastine at 500 nM from day 45 and analysed on day 55. 
 
Detailed description of MRI protocol:  Standard high-resolution T1-weighted acquisition of the 
brain (sagittal 3D MPRAGE, 1 mm3 cubic voxel, iPAT 2, acquisition time: 5:12 min) and a 
sagittal 3D FLAIR (1 mm3 cubic voxel, iPAT 2, acquisition time: 6:12 min) were acquired for all 
participants.  
 
A Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) protocol with correction for RF inhomogeneity and T1 
relaxation (MTsat) was also acquired for the brain. The protocol consisted of 2 axial volumes 
acquired with a 3D FLASH sequence with and without a MT pulse (1.2 kHz offset frequency) 
applied (resolution 1 x 1 x 2.5 mm3, FOV 240 x 240 x 180 mm3); other key parameters: TR/TE = 
29/4.92 ms, flip angle = 5°. A third volume to correct for RF inhomogeneity and T1 relaxation 
effects was also acquired with a flip angle=15°. Total acquisition time was about 10:20 min. 
MTsat values were computed using the methods described by Helms et al.S4 
 
The brain Myelin Water Fraction (MWF) protocol consisted of a volume acquired using an axial 
2D multi-gradient-echo FLASH sequence (in plane resolution 1.25 x 1.25 mm2, FOV 240 x 240 
mm2, 50 slices of 2.5 mm thickness) with a flip angle of 40°, TR=2260 ms and total acquisition 
time of 4:15 min. For each acquisition, 10 echoes were collected with first echo time TE1 = 4.70 
ms and echo spacing ΔTE = 4 ms. To compute T1 relaxation times and correct for signal 
saturation effects, a second axial 2D FLASH volume was acquired (TR=700 ms, two echoes 
with TE 4.70 and 8.70 ms, flip angle 70°). A series of low resolution GE-EPI were also acquired 
to correct for B0 and B1 RF inhomogeneity. The MWF protocol had a total duration time of about 
9 min. Myelin water fractions were computed using the method described by Neeb et al.S5-S6

A two-shell NODDI protocolS7 of total scan time of about 9 min was implemented using an axial 
multi band SE-EPI sequence with slice acceleration factor 2. Other key acquisition parameters: 
TR/TE = 4300/96 ms, 2.2 mm3 cubic voxel, 66 axial slices, iPAT 2, 30 directions at b = 700 
s/mm2, 64 directions at b = 2000 s/mm2 and 10 volumes without diffusion sensitising gradients 
applied (b0). The diffusion MRI data were processed including eddy current corrections and 
diagonalization to get parameters of the diffusion tensor model. The fractional anisotropy was 
calculated from the diffusion tensor eigenvalues (DiPy).

Supplementary Table 2: Secondary Outcomes: Additional outcomes from the clinical trial. All 
data was analyzed using the standard crossover model specified in the analysis plan in 
supplementary table 2a and as a delayed treatment trial in supplementary table 2b. Effect is 
therefore the measurement on drug compared to baseline or screening (as appropriate). Six-
minute walk test reflects the distance in feet participants walked in 6 minutes. The timed 25-foot 
walk represents the time taken to walk 25 feet. MTR = Magnetization Transfer Ratio, MWF=
