 Experimental monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies have shown promise for treatment of lethal 
Ebola virus (EBOV) infections, but their species-specific recognition of the viral glycoprotein 
(GP) has limited their use against other divergent ebolaviruses associated with human disease. 
Here, we mined the human immune response to natural EBOV infection and identified mAbs with 
exceptionally potent pan-ebolavirus neutralizing activity and protective efficacy against three 
virulent ebolaviruses. These mAbs recognize an inter-protomer epitope in the GP fusion loop, a 
critical and conserved element of the viral membrane fusion machinery, and neutralize viral entry 
by targeting a proteolytically primed, fusion-competent GP intermediate (GPCL) generated in host 
cell endosomes. Only a few somatic hypermutations are required for broad antiviral activity, and 
germline-approximating variants display enhanced GPCL recognition, suggesting that such 
antibodies could be elicited more efficiently with suitably optimized GP immunogens. Our 
findings inform the development of both broadly effective immunotherapeutics and vaccines 
against filoviruses.

INTRODUCTION
Viruses of the family Filoviridae (filoviruses) cause outbreaks of a lethal disease for which 
no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments or vaccines are available. The 
unprecedented 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in Western Africa highlighted the 
potential of these agents to cause health emergencies of international scope and has 
accelerated the development of countermeasures (de La Vega et al., 2015; Kuhn et al., 2014). 
At the height of this epidemic, several early-stage therapeutics and vaccines were evaluated 
under compassionate-use protocols (Wong and Kobinger, 2015). Arguably the most 
successful of these is ZMapp, an immunotherapeutic comprising three mouse/human 
chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6, which target the 
glycoprotein (GP) spikes on the surface of EBOV virions. ZMapp was highly effective at 
reversing advanced EBOV disease (EVD) in non-human primates (NHPs) and provided

 initial evidence of efficacy in a phase II clinical trial (Davey et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2014). 
Despite its promise, ZMapp suffers a key limitation. It lacks activity against other filoviruses 
associated with human disease, including Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), 
and Marburg virus (MARV), because its component mAbs do not recognize and neutralize 
these divergent GPs (Murin et al., 2014). The public health threat represented by BDBV and 
SUDV, which caused ≈ 40% of all ebolavirus infections prior to 2013 (Burk et al., 2016), 
and by newly emerging or engineered ebolaviruses, demands an urgent response.
Given the scientific and logistical hurdles inherent in developing a separate mAb therapeutic 
for each filovirus, recent work has focused on the development of broadly protective 
immunotherapies. Frei et al. (2016) combined known EBOV and SUDV GP-specific 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) KZ52 and a humanized variant of 16F6, respectively, to 
generate bispecific antibodies that protected against both viruses in mice. More recently, 
bispecific antibodies combining two broadly reactive but non-neutralizing mAbs targeting 
virus:host receptor interactions were shown to neutralize all known ebolaviruses through a 
“Trojan horse” mechanism and to protect mice challenged with EBOV or SUDV (Wec et al., 
2016). The presence of cross-reactive and cross-neutralizing antibodies in natural antibody 
repertoires following monospecific ebolavirus infection or immunization has also been noted 
(Bornholdt et al., 2016b; Macneil et al., 2011; Natesan et al., 2016), and antibody discovery 
efforts have yielded cross-neutralizing mAbs with increased protective breadth (Flyak et al., 
2016; Furuyama et al., 2016; Howell et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015). To date, however, only 
a single canonical IgG with true pan-ebolavirus neutralizing activity—the mouse mAb 6D6
—has been reported (Furuyama et al., 2016). Moreover, no natural or engineered antibody 
has yet been shown to protect animals against EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV (Burk et al., 2016).
Here, we sought to perform a systematic analysis of the breadth of the anti-ebolavirus 
neutralizing mAb response in humans. Accordingly, we screened our recently published 
library of 349 human mAbs isolated from a survivor of the recent West African EBOV 
outbreak (Bornholdt et al., 2016b) for broad neutralizers. We identified two mAbs that could 
potently neutralize all five ebolaviruses and confer post-exposure protection against EBOV, 
BDBV, and SUDV in animal challenge models. Follow-up studies indicated that these mAbs 
recognize a hitherto unknown GP epitope that encompasses membrane-seeking residues in 
the internal fusion loop and mediate neutralization by targeting a proteolytically cleaved GP 
intermediate in the endocytic pathway. Together, our findings inform the development of 
pan-ebolavirus immunotherapeutics and the design of filovirus vaccines tailored to elicit 
highly potent cross-protective antibodies.
RESULTS
Identification of Cross-Reactive and Cross-Neutralizing mAbs
To identify broadly reactive mAbs in the EVD survivor library, we screened recombinant 
VSV (rVSV) particles displaying prototypic GPs from EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV by ELISA. 
72% of the mAbs recognized BDBV GP, whereas only 11% cross-reacted with SUDV GP 
(Figure S1A), consistent with the amino acid sequence conservation among these GPs. 37 of 
349 mAbs reacted with all three GPs by ELISA (Figure S1B). Within this subset, 16 mAbs 
belonged to the glycan cap epitope group (c13C6 competitors), 10 mAbs targeted the GP

 base (KZ52 competitors), another 10 were directed against the α–helical heptad repeat 2 in 
the GP2 “stalk” (HR2 epitope group, ADI-15974 competitors), and one mAb belonged to an 
undefined but GP1-specific epitope group (Bornholdt et al., 2016b).
We assayed the 37 cross-reactive mAbs for their capacity to inhibit infection by rVSV 
particles bearing SUDV GP, the most divergent from EBOV GP in amino acid sequence. 
Neutralization potency was first evaluated at two concentrations, and mAbs advanced if 
>50% reduction in infection was observed at the higher dose (Figures S1C–S1F). Only 10 of 
37 cross-reactive mAbs showed significant neutralizing activity against rVSV-SUDV GP. 
Six of these NAbs belonged to the KZ52 competition group and targeted the GP base, 
whereas the remaining four were equally divided between the HR2 and 13C6 epitope groups 
(Figures 1A and S1C–S1F). These and previous results (Flyak et al., 2016) suggest that a 
small subset of cross-reactive and cross-neutralizing antibodies is generated by the human 
immune response in the course of natural ebolavirus infection.
Analysis of mAb Neutralization Breadth In Vitro
To evaluate the breadth and potency of neutralization by the top ten NAbs identified above, 
we performed dose-response neutralization assays with rVSVs bearing GPs from all five 
known ebolaviruses—EBOV, BDBV, SUDV, Reston virus (RESTV), and Taï Forest virus 
(TAFV) (Figures 1B–1P; Table S1). The HR2 binder, ADI-16061, potently neutralized 
infection by rVSVs bearing EBOV, BDBV, and TAFV GP with half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values below 5 nM but had little activity against those bearing SUDV 
and RESTV GP. The second NAb from this group, ADI-15975, possessed an even narrower 
antiviral spectrum, with strong activity only against rVSV-EBOV GP (Figures 1B, 1E, 1H, 
1K, and 1N; Table S1).
The glycan cap binders, ADI-15750 and ADI-15968, neutralized rVSVs bearing EBOV, 
TAFV, and SUDV GP, albeit with weaker activity against SUDV GP (Figures 1C, 1I, 1L; 
Table S1). Further, ADI-15750 was effective at neutralizing rVSV-RESTV GP but not rVSV-
BDBV GP, whereas the converse was true for ADI-15968 (Figures 1F and 1O; Table S1). 
Thus, none of the mAbs directed against the GP stalk or glycan cap demonstrated pan-
ebolavirus neutralizing profiles, consistent with the limited antigenic conservation across 
these GP surfaces (Figures 4, S3A, and S3B).
Two NAbs recognizing the GP base, ADI-15878 and ADI-15742, possessed exceptionally 
broad and potent neutralizing activity (IC50 <2 nM) against all five rVSV-GPs (Figures 1D, 
1G, 1J, 1M, and 1P; Table S1). A third base-binding NAb, ADI-15946, potently neutralized 
EBOV, BDBV, and TAFV, but showed reduced or no activity toward rVSVs bearing SUDV 
and RESTV GP, respectively (Figures 1D, 1G, 1J, 1M, and 1P; Table S1). The remaining 
three NAbs in this epitope class were not pursued further due to their limited neutralization 
breadth.
We advanced the broadest and most potent neutralizers in each epitope group for testing 
against authentic ebolaviruses (Figure 2). The results largely corroborated our findings with 
rVSV-GPs and confirmed that only the base binders ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 could 
potently neutralize infection by EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV (IC50 ≤ 1 nM) (Figure 2).

 However, the activity of these broadly neutralizing Abs (bNAbs) did not extend to the more 
divergent GPs of Lloviu virus (LLOV) and MARV (Table S1). These findings underscore the 
challenges inherent in achieving pan-filovirus or even pan-ebolavirus neutralization with 
single mAbs targeting surface-exposed GP epitopes.
Mapping of bNAb Epitopes Using Negative-Stain Electron Microscopy and Escape Mutant 
Analysis
To visualize each GP:bNAb complex, we performed negative-stain transmission electron 
microscopy (EM) studies of the antigen binding fragments (Fabs) of ADI-16061, 
ADI-15750, ADI-15878, ADI-15742, and ADI-15946 bound to trimeric soluble EBOV GP 
(GPΔTM). 3D reconstructions determined from the EM class averages confirmed previous 
epitope group assignments based on binding competition experiments (Bornholdt et al., 
2016b). To approximate bNAb footprints on GP, we fit the recently solved unliganded 
EBOV GPΔTM X-ray crystal structure (PDB: 5JQ3) (Zhao et al., 2016) into the GP 
envelope obtained by image reconstruction (Figure 3). Further, to identify GP residues 
critical for bNAb binding and viral neutralization, we selected neutralization escape mutants 
(Figures 3, S2, and S3). rVSV-GPs were serially passaged in the presence of each bNAb 
until complete viral resistance was observed, and the GP genes of viral clones were 
sequenced to identify escape mutations (Figures 3, S2, and S3).
ADI-16061 bound to HR2 and an N-terminal portion of the membrane proximal external 
region (MPER) between residues 621–640 in the GP2 stalk, with an angle of approach 
perpendicular to the GP stalk and parallel to the viral membrane (Figure 3A). Despite the 
compact nature of the GP stalk, three Fabs could bind per GP trimer, each rotated by ~50° 
with respect to the GP 3-fold symmetry axis. Two independent mutations in HR2, H628N 
and D632E (Figure 3E), greatly reduced GP:bNAb binding (Figure S2A) and afforded 
escape from viral neutralization (Figure S2B). While residue H628 was visualized in the 
EBOV GP X-ray crystal structure (Zhao et al., 2016), the complete ADI-16061 epitope 
likely extends past the last resolved amino acid residue (631), inclusive of D632E, and into 
the MPER (EBOV GP residues ≈ 633–657). The high degree of viral species-dependent 
sequence variation in the MPER probably accounts for the failure of ADI-16061 to 
neutralize RESTV and SUDV (Figures 1, 2, and S3A).
Complexes between ADI-15750 and GPΔTM were not amenable to 3D reconstruction due 
to partial mAb occupancy, likely resulting from poor binding affinity (data not shown). 
However, 2D class averages of these complexes showed the Fabs binding GP axially to the 
viral membrane, reminiscent of the binding modes of c13C6 and other glycan cap binders 
(Bornholdt et al., 2016b; Murin et al., 2014; Pallesen et al., 2016) (Figure S4A). rVSV-
EBOV GP particles escaped ADI-15750 neutralization via mutation of multiple glycan cap 
residues that compromised GP:bNAb binding to varying degrees (Figures S2, S3, and S4). 
The ADI-15750 binding footprint inferred from the escape mutant analysis appears to 
overlap that of mAb c13C6 (Pallesen et al., 2016) (Figures 4D, 4E, S3, and S4). 
Concordantly, binding of both mAbs was sensitive to the G271R escape mutation 
engendered by ADI-15750 (Figures S4C and S4D).

 The GP base-binding bNAbs ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 are clonal siblings with 90% and 
95% identity in their variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) amino acid sequences, 
respectively (Bornholdt et al., 2016b) (Figure 6A). Their Fabs showed a steep angle of 
approach similar to the SUDV-monospecific Fab 16F6 (Dias et al., 2011) but appeared to be 
rotated by ≈ 90° about their long axes relative to the EBOV-monospecific Fab KZ52 
(Figures 3B, 3C, and 3I) (Lee et al., 2008b). The epitope targeted by ADI-15878 and 
ADI-15742 is also rotated by ≈ 60° about the GP 3-fold symmetry axis relative to the base 
binders KZ52, 16F6, c2G4, and c4G7 (Dias et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2008a; Murin et al., 
2014; Pallesen et al., 2016) (Figures 3B, 3C, 3I, and 4). The ADI-15878/15742 footprint on 
GP comprises discontinuous sequences in both GP1 and GP2 subunits that span neighboring 
protomers, including putative membrane-seeking residues in the highly conserved GP2 
internal fusion loop (IFL) (Figures 3B, 3C, and 4). Consistent with a critical role for 
bNAb:IFL contacts, a single IFL point mutation, G528E, abolished both viral recognition 
and neutralization without observable effects on viral entry (Figures 3F, 3G, S2, and S3). 
Both ADI-15742 and ADI-15878, like another base-binding NAb mAb-100, are also 
predicted to contact the complex N-liked glycan at GP2 residue 563, in the α–helical heptad 
repeat 1 (HR1) sequence of the adjacent protomer (Figures 3B, 3C, 3F, 3G, and 4B) (Misasi 
et al., 2016). Glycosylation of this residue is strictly conserved across all filovirus GPs 
(Figure S3).
Unexpectedly, ADI-15878/15742 displayed enhanced binding and neutralization of rVSV-
EBOV GP particles bearing the N563A mutation, indicating that the glycan on this residue 
impairs GP recognition. By contrast, removal of the N563 glycan abolished mAb-100 
neutralization and modestly reduced the activity of the other base binders tested (Figures 5D, 
S5D, S5E, and S5F).
ADI-15946, the third base-binding bNAb identified herein, targets an epitope that is 
similarly positioned to those of mAbs KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 (Lee et al., 2008a; Murin et 
al., 2014; Pallesen et al., 2016) but shifted upward toward the glycan cap (Figures 3D and 
4F–4H). ADI-15946’s angle of approach is similar to that of mAb c2G4 (Murin et al., 2014; 
Pallesen et al., 2016) and its contacts involve discontinuous sequences with a single GP 
protomer: GP1 base (residues 71–77), glycan cap (residues 251–303), and GP2 (residues 
508–514) (Figures 3D and 4F). A single amino acid change (K510E), adjacent to the KZ52/
c2G4/c4G7 escape mutation (Q508R) (Audet et al., 2014), afforded complete viral 
resistance to ADI-15946 binding and neutralization (Figures 3D, 3H, S2, and S3). A second 
mutation at a buried position in the GP1 base (E100K) weakened viral neutralization but did 
not substantially diminish ADI-15946:GP binding. The higher level of sequence 
conservation in the putative ADI-15946 epitope relative to those of c2G4, C4G7, and KZ52 
likely explains the former’s enhanced antiviral breadth (Figures 4F and S3D). However, the 
greater sequence divergence of SUDV and RESTV GP at the proposed sites of contact 
(Figure S3) is consistent with the failure of ADI-15946 to neutralize viruses bearing these 
GPs.

 Mechanisms of Antiviral Neutralization
The filovirus cell entry pathway is a complex, multistep process that culminates in GP-
catalyzed fusion between viral and host endosomal membranes and escape of a viral 
nucleocapsid payload into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Miller and Chandran, 2012; Moller-
Tank and Maury, 2015). Following their attachment to the plasma membrane of a permissive 
cell, virions are internalized and trafficked to late endo/lysosomal compartments (Simmons 
et al., 2015; Spence et al., 2016). In endosomes, resident host cysteine cathepsins cleave GP 
to remove the mucin and glycan cap sequences (Chandran et al., 2005; Schornberg et al., 
2006), thereby unmasking a binding site for the critical endosomal receptor, Niemann-Pick 
C1 (NPC1) (Bornholdt et al., 2016a; Carette et al., 2011; Côté et al., 2011; Miller et al., 
2012). Recognition of NPC1 by a cleaved GP species (hereafter, GPCL), together with one or 
more unknown host signals, is proposed to trigger GP refolding and the membrane fusion 
reaction that is coupled to it (Brecher et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012; Spence et al., 2016; 
Wong et al., 2010).
In initial studies, we found that ADI-15878, ADI-15742, and ADI-15946 were efficiently 
co-internalized with viral particles and delivered to NPC1+ late endosomes (Figures S5A 
and S5B for ADI-15878). Because GPCL:NPC1 recognition is an indispensable requirement 
for filovirus entry (Miller et al., 2012), we first examined the capacity of the GP base-
binding bNAbs to inhibit it in a competitive ELISA (Figure 5A). Pre-incubation of each 
bNAb with VSV particles bearing EBOV GPCL had no effect on viral capture of a soluble 
fragment of NPC1, whereas the mAbs MR72 and FVM04, which bind directly to the 
receptor-binding site (RBS) in GPCL, blocked NPC1 capture, as described previously 
(Bornholdt et al., 2016a; Howell et al., 2016). Thus, consistent with their RBS-distal 
epitopes, none of the GP base binders described herein exert their antiviral effect by directly 
preventing the virus-receptor interaction. (Figures 3 and 4).
Endosomal GP → GPCL cleavage is a prerequisite for GPCL:NPC1 binding and therefore 
essential for filovirus entry. Accordingly, we investigated if any of the NAbs could interfere 
with this proteolytic processing step, as reported for the human EBOV-specific GP base 
binders, KZ52 and mAb-100 (Misasi et al., 2016; Shedlock et al., 2010). rVSV-EBOV GP 
particles were pre-incubated with each NAb and then exposed to the endosomal cysteine 
protease cathepsin L (CatL). GP cleavage was assessed by measuring exposure of the GPCL 
RBS with an NPC1-binding ELISA (Figure 5B) or by gel electrophoresis and 
immunoblotting (Figure 5C) as described (Chandran et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2012). 
ADI-15946, similar to c2G4, c4G7, KZ52, and mAb-100, could inhibit GP → GPCL 
cleavage and GPCL RBS exposure in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, ADI-15878 and 
ADI-15742 were ineffective at blocking GP → GPCL cleavage. These results are consistent 
with the proximity of the binding footprints of mAb-100, c2G4, c4G7, and ADI-15946 to 
the GP1 β13–β14 loop, which is proposed to be the initial target of proteolytic cleavage 
(Chandran et al., 2005; Dube et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008a; Zhao et al., 2016). ADI-15878 
and ADI-15742 appear to bind distal to the β13- β14 loop (Figures 3B–3D and 3I).
The preceding findings suggested that ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 act primarily at a step 
that follows GP → GPCL cleavage and receptor engagement. Because an endosomally 
generated GPCL species (alone or in complex with NPC1) is the presumptive final target of

 these bNAbs, we examined the capacities of the base binders to neutralize VSV particles 
bearing GPCL generated with CatL (Figures 5D, S5C, and S5G). Strikingly, GP cleavage 
enhanced the antiviral potencies of ADI-15946, ADI-15878, and ADI-15742 by 50- to 200-
fold (not shown for ADI-15742), whereas it attenuated or eliminated neutralization by the 
other base binders tested.
Kinetic binding studies by biolayer interferometry (BLI) further elucidated pH- and 
cleavage-dependent changes in the apparent GP binding affinity of some NAbs (Figure 5E; 
Table S2). ADI-15878 bound with picomolar affinity to uncleaved GPΔTM at pH 7.5, but 
suffered a striking (103- to 104-fold) loss in apparent binding affinity at pH 5.5, the 
approximate pH of late endosomes. However, it regained picomolar binding affinity for 
CatL-cleaved GPCL. ADI-15946 recognized uncleaved GPΔTM with nanomolar affinity at 
pH 7.5 and 5.5 and also gained picomolar binding to GPCL at pH 5.5 (103- to 104-fold 
enhancement). Thus, the enhanced neutralization potential of these bNAbs against cleaved 
viruses may be at least partially attributable to improvements in GP binding. Interestingly, 
the monospecific base binders KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 retained efficient binding to GPCL 
despite their loss of neutralization against cleaved viruses, indicating that the nature of the 
epitope recognized, and not only binding affinity, dictates the molecular mechanism by 
which GP base-binding NAbs block ebolavirus entry.
Together, these results suggest that the bNAbs ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 differ from 
previously described monospecific base binders like KZ52, c2G4, c4G7, and mAb-100, in 
their capacity to target and neutralize a cleaved GP species that is generated deep in the 
endocytic pathway (Figure 5F). Conversely, the latter NAbs appear to act principally at 
and/or prior to the GP → GPCL cleavage step. ADI-15946 displayed a dual behavior and 
may act both upstream, to block GP cleavage, and downstream, to target one or more GPCL-
like species at or near the membrane fusion step.
Germline Origin of ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 and Sequence Determinants of Their 
Neutralization Potency and Breadth
To begin to define the molecular basis of broad neutralization by ADI-15878 and 
ADI-15742, we assigned the VH and VL sequences of each bNAb to their respective 
germline genes and reverted ADI-15878 to its nearest inferred germline (IGL) precursor 
(Figure 6A). ADI-15878IGL was engineered to contain germline reversions in most 
framework and complementarity-determining regions (CDR) segments but retain wild-type 
(WT) (fully mature) CDR-H3, because the originating germline sequence in this region 
could not be predicted with confidence given the highly diverse nature of D segments upon 
VDJ recombination. ADI-15878IGL bound to EBOV GPΔTM (apparent KD, KD app ≈ 400 
nM by BLI) but lacked neutralizing activity (Figures 6B, 6C, S6, and S7). Heterodimeric 
light chain-heavy chain pairings containing one mature, somatic hypermutation (SHM)-
bearing variable domain and one IGL variable domain bound to EBOV GP with single-digit 
nanomolar affinity (20- to 100-fold lower KDapp), but picomolar affinity to EBOV GP 
required pairing of both mature chains (Figures S6A and S6C). The higher affinity of mature 
variable domains for binding to EBOV GP was primarily due to slower dissociation rates 
(koff) relative to variants containing one or both IGL segments. These changes in binding

 affinity associated with variable region maturation were accompanied by incremental 
improvements in neutralization potency and breadth. However, neutralization of rVSVs 
bearing SUDV and RESTV GP was especially dependent on sequences containing light 
chain SHMs, indicating a critical role for ADI-15878 light chain: GP interactions in 
neutralization breadth (Figures 6C and S7). Together, these findings suggest that the CDRs 
of both VH (non-CDR-H3) and VL sequences of ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 make key 
contributions to the energetics of ebolavirus GP binding and to pan-ebolavirus neutralizing 
efficacy.
To complement the above analysis, we separately assessed the contributions of individual 
CDR-H3 residues in ADI-15878 by alanine scanning mutagenesis (Figures 6B, 6C, S6, and 
S7). WT ADI-15878 mAb exhibited a slow off rate for both GP and GPCL (below the 10−7 s
−1 detection limit of BLI, providing a <1 pM estimate of KDapp). Most of the WT → Ala 
CDR-H3 mutants exhibited dramatically lower binding to EBOV GP (KDapp s 20- to 74,000-
fold higher than 1 pM), indicating that mutations were either detrimental to direct binding 
interactions or altered productive CDR-H3 loop conformations. However, all of the WT → 
Ala CDR-H3 mutants had only modest effects on neutralization potency against rVSV-
EBOV GP relative to WT ADI-15878, except D95A and W99A, which suffered an ≈ 99% 
reduction in potency. The impact on neutralization of each CDR-H3 mutant, including D95A 
and W99A, was even less pronounced against rVSV-EBOV GPCL (Figures 6C and S7), 
consistent with enhanced mAb:GPCL binding affinity and GPCL neutralization sensitivity 
(Figure 6B; Table S2). These neutralization trends extended to GPs from the other 
ebolaviruses, except for Y100cA, which was selectively less potent against rVSVs bearing 
SUDV GP and GPCL (Figures 6C, S7C, and S7D). These results suggest that interactions 
between the CDR-H3 loop of ADI-15878 and structurally conserved elements in the GP2 
IFL and HR1 contribute to pan-ebolavirus recognition and neutralization. Furthermore, they 
identify three WT side chains (D95, W99, Y100c) that are critical to the pan-ebolavirus 
neutralizing activity of ADI-15878.
Protective Efficacy in Animal Models of EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV Challenge
We assessed the protective efficacy of the human bNAbs in three small-animal models of 
lethal ebolavirus challenge (Figure 7). First, wild-type (WT) BALB/c mice were exposed to 
mouse-adapted EBOV (EBOV-MA) and then administered a single dose of each bNAb at 2 
days post-infection (Figures 7A and 7B). bNAbs from each epitope group were highly (≥ 
80%) protective against EBOV in this stringent post-exposure setting with little or no weight 
loss apparent in antibody-treated animals.
We next evaluated the bNAbs in the type I interferon α/β receptor-deficient mouse model for 
SUDV challenge (Figures 7C and 7D) (Brannan et al., 2015). Mice were exposed to WT 
SUDV and then dosed with each bNAb on days 1 and 4 post-infection. ADI-15878 and 
ADI-15742 afforded ≥ 95% survival and greatly reduced weight loss, relative to the PBS 
vehicle group. By contrast, ADI-16061 and ADI-15946, both weak SUDV neutralizers, 
provided little or no protection. To the contrary, ADI-16061 significantly increased mortality 
in two independent experiments (p < 0.05), raising the possibility that it can enhance SUDV 
infection in vivo.

 Finally, we tested the anti-BDBV efficacy of the two pan-ebolavirus bNAbs, ADI-15878 and 
ADI-15742, in the domestic ferret, which is the only described non-NHP model for BDBV 
challenge (Figures 7E and 7F) (Cross et al., 2016; Kozak et al., 2016). Animals received two 
doses of each bNAb. As observed previously (Cross et al., 2016; Kozak et al., 2016), BDBV 
infection was uniformly lethal, with PBS-treated animals succumbing between days 8–10 
following challenge. By contrast, both bNAbs afforded highly significant levels of survival 
(p < 0.01; three of four animals for ADI-15878; two of four for ADI-15742). Furthermore, 
peak viremia levels correlated with bNAb treatment and survival outcome, with lower viral 
titers observed in the surviving animals relative to those that succumbed to infection (p = 
0.0011) and in bNAb-treated animals relative to PBS-treated controls (p = 0.0006). Viremia 
also trended lower in animals receiving ADI-15878 relative to those receiving ADI-15742, 
but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Strikingly, analysis of the BDBV GP 
consensus sequence in blood samples collected from viremic animals at day 6 post-
challenge revealed a single nucleotide change encoding the G528S mutation in all four of 
the ADI-15742-treated animals, but in none of the ADI-15878-treated and PBS-treated 
animals for which viral RNA could be isolated (Table S3). Mutation of the same GP2 IFL 
residue conferred viral neutralization escape from both antibodies in tissue culture (Figures 
3, S2, and S3). These results raise the possibility that ADI-15878 engenders viral 
neutralization escape to a lesser extent than ADI-15742 in vivo and suggests that ADI-15878 
should be prioritized over ADI-15742 as a component of a pan-ebolavirus 
immunotherapeutic.
In sum, our findings demonstrate that the pan-ebolavirus bNAbs ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 
can afford post-exposure protection against challenge by the three divergent ebolaviruses 
currently associated with lethal disease outbreaks in humans.
DISCUSSION
Herein, we identified bNAbs from a human survivor of the 2013–2016 West African EBOV 
epidemic, including two with potent pan-ebolavirus neutralizing activity. Flyak et al. (2016) 
previously reported a bNAb, BDBV43, from a survivor of BDBV infection, but two features 
limit its therapeutic utility in comparison to the human bNAbs described in this study. First, 
BDBV43 neutralizes EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV weakly (IC50 >100 nM). Second, BDBV43, 
a glycan cap binder, cross-reacts with the secreted form of the glycoprotein (sGP). sGP is 
present at high levels in EVD patients (Sanchez et al., 1996) and may “soak up” mAbs that 
recognize it (Mohan et al., 2012) potentially reducing their capacity to target and neutralize 
infectious virions.
We uncovered cross-neutralizing mAbs that not only target the glycan cap and sGP 
(ADI-15750) (Bornholdt et al., 2016b) but also other structural regions of the trimeric GP 
spike, namely the base and internal fusion loop (IFL) (ADI-15878, ADI-15742, ADI-15946) 
and the stalk (ADI-16061). The broadest and most potent of these bNAbs recognize base 
epitopes. ADI-15878 and ADI-15742, two clonally related mAbs of the 349 screened, 
afforded highly potent neutralizing activity (IC50 <1 nM) against all five known 
ebolaviruses. A third base binder, ADI-15946, could potently neutralize four of five 
ebolaviruses (except RESTV) but demonstrated only modest activity against SUDV.

 Our findings reveal unusual modes of neutralization by ADI-15878, ADI-15742, and 
ADI-15946. Specifically, ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 appear to target a cleaved GP 
intermediate in endosomes, whereas the prototypic base binders KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 act 
only at one or more upstream steps in entry, as also proposed by Misasi et al. (2016) 
(Figures 5F, S5A, and S5B). The protomer-spanning mode of ADI-15878/15742 binding is 
predicted to “lock” the cleaved GP trimer, whether free or bound to NPC1, in a pre-fusion 
state, thereby arresting GP conformational changes required for viral membrane fusion. 
ADI-15946 appears to act at both upstream and downstream entry steps and may arrest the 
transduction of receptor-induced conformational changes required for fusion by binding GP1 
residues adjacent to the RBS (71–77) (Figures 4F and S3D). These residues were shown to 
rearrange upon GPCL:NPC1 association (Wang et al., 2016). The prototypic base binders do 
not appear to make such GP1 contacts (Figures 4G and 4H).
To explore the genesis of pan-ebolavirus bNAbs in humans infected with a single ebolavirus, 
we characterized “germline-reverted” variants of ADI-15878 for viral binding and 
neutralization. Our results suggest that, although ADI-15878/15742-like pan-ebolavirus 
neutralizing mAbs did not arise with high frequency in this human survivor of EVD (2/349), 
the barrier for maturation of such mAbs may be lower than that seen in some other viral 
diseases. ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 originate from the most common germline heavy chain 
segment (VH3–23), do not possess extremely long CDR-H3s (15 amino acids versus 20–33 
for HIV-1-specific bNAbs whose epitopes contain protein sequences and glycans), and 
require only a few SHMs for broad and potent antiviral activity (≈ 6% amino acid changes 
in VH versus ≈ 30% for HIV-1 CD4-binding site-specific bNAbs) (Bornholdt et al., 2016b; 
Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013; Tiller et al., 2013). Furthermore, a germline-reverted variant 
of ADI-15878 (albeit with a mature CDR-H3) could recognize EBOV GP with 
submicromolar affinity (Figures 6 and S6). The presence of bNAbs in polyclonal primary 
responses to ebolavirus infection contrasts with the origin of such bNAbs in human subjects 
who control long-term HIV-1 infection or with active secondary dengue virus infection 
(Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013; Dejnirattisai et al., 2015).
Our findings further suggest the possibility of eliciting anti-ebolavirus bNAbs efficiently in 
humans through immunization with a suitably engineered immunogen, because the sites of 
broad vulnerability within GP are clearly defined, and the generation of ADI-15878-like 
responses requires only subtle maturation of an abundantly represented germline. Strikingly, 
the germline-reverted ADI-15878 variant could bind to soluble EBOV GPCL with single-
digit nanomolar KDapp and neutralize viruses bearing EBOV and SUDV GPCL (Figures 6C, 
S6A, and S7A). Thus, minimized EBOV GP constructs mimicking GPCL may preferentially 
elicit ADI-15878-like antibodies through enhanced presentation of vulnerable IFL epitopes, 
increased activation of the appropriate B cell precursors, and removal of putatively 
immunodominant and generally non-neutralizing epitopes in the glycan cap and mucin 
domain. Such germline-targeting immunogens could be further improved by modification of 
the GP glycan landscape (e.g., at residue 563) and may have utility as part of a broadly 
protective next-generation filovirus vaccine.
ADI-15878 and ADI-15742 protect against EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV in vivo under 
stringent post-exposure conditions when administered as monotherapy, and our results

 suggest that they should also afford protection against all other known ebolaviruses. By 
contrast, the ZMapp cocktail, which represents the current state-of-the-art for anti-filovirus 
immunotherapy, is only efficacious against a single virus, EBOV. Moreover, ZMapp 
component c13C6 cross-reacts with sGP, and all three mAbs lack activity against 
endosomally cleaved forms of GP. Next-generation cocktails comprising bNAbs like 
ADI-15878, ADI-15946, and/or CA45 (Zhao et al., 2017; this issue of Cell), which elude 
subversion by sGP (Bornholdt et al., 2016b) and can act synergistically to block both 
uncleaved and cleaved forms of GP (Figure 5F), should provide broad protection at 
significantly lower doses, while reducing the risk of neutralization escape that is inherent to 
antibody monotherapy.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell lines—Vero female African grivet monkey cells, HEK293T female human embryonic 
kidney fibroblast cells, and U2OS female human osteosarcoma cells were obtained from the 
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Vero and HEK293T cells were cultured in high-
glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher), and 1% 
penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). U2OS cells were cultured in McCoy’s-5A medium 
(Thermo Fisher) with serum and additives as above. Suspension-adapted 293-Freestyle (293-
F) cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher, and cultivated in Freestyle 293 serum-free 
expression medium (Thermo Fisher). Cell lines were maintained in a humidified 37°C 
incubator supplied with 5% CO2 (Vero, HEK293T) or 8% CO2 (293-F). Cell lines were not 
authenticated following purchase.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) recombinants and pseudotypes—Recombinant 
vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses (rVSV) expressing eGFP in the first position, and 
encoding representative GP proteins from EBOV/Mayinga (EBOV/H.sap-tc/COD/76/
Yambuku-Mayinga), EBOV/Makona (EBOV/H.sap-rec/LBR/14/Makona-L2014), BDBV 
(BDBV/H.sap/UGA/07/But-811250), SUDV/Boneface (SUDV/C.por-lab/SSD/76/
Boneface), RESTV (RESTV/M.fastc/USA/89/Phi89-AZ-1435), and LLOV (LLOV/M.sch-
wt/ESP/03/Asturias-Bat86), in place of VSV G have been described previously (Ng et al., 
2014; Wec et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2010). VSV pseudotypes bearing eGFP and GP proteins 
from TAFV (TAFV/H.sap-tc/CIV/94/CDC807212) and MARV (MARV/H.sap-
tc/KEN/80/Mt. Elgon-Musoke) were generated as described (Takada et al., 1997).
Authentic filoviruses—The authentic filoviruses EBOV/“Zaire 1995” (EBOV/H.sap-
tc/COD/95/Kik-9510621) (Jahrling et al., 1999), mouse-adapted EBOV/Mayinga (EBOV-
MA) (Bray et al., 1998), SUDV/Boneface-USAMRIID111808 (WHO International Study 
Team, 1978), and BDBV/200706291 (Towner et al., 2008) were used in this study.

 METHOD DETAILS
Generation of cleaved VSV-GP particles and GPΔTM ectodomain proteins—In 
some experiments, cleaved viral particles bearing GPCL were first generated by incubation 
with thermolysin (200 μg/mL, pH 7.5, 37°C for 1 h; Sigma-Aldrich) or recombinant human 
cathepsin L (CatL, 2 ng/μL, pH 5.5, 37°C for 1 h; R&D Systems), as described previously 
(Wong et al., 2010). Reactions were stopped by removal onto ice and addition of 
phosphoramidon (1 mM) or E-64 (10 μM), respectively, and viral particles were used 
immediately for infectivity assays. A recombinant, soluble GPΔTM protein (Bornholdt et 
al., 2016b) was also cleaved essentially as described above.
VSV infectivity measurements and neutralization assays—Viral infectivities were 
measured by automated counting of eGFP+ cells (infectious units; IU) using a CellInsight 
CX5 imager (Thermo Fisher) at 12–14 hr post-infection. For mAb neutralization 
experiments, pre-titrated amounts of VSV-GP particles (MOI ≈ 1 IU per cell) were 
incubated with increasing concentrations of test mAb at room temp for 1 hr, and then added 
to confluent cell monolayers in 96-well plates. Viral neutralization data were subjected to 
nonlinear regression analysis to derive EC50 values (4-parameter, variable slope sigmoidal 
dose-response equation; GraphPad Prism).
Authentic filovirus microneutralization assays—Antibodies were diluted to 
indicated concentrations in culture media and incubated with virus for 1 hr. Vero E6 cells 
were exposed to antibody/virus inoculum at an MOI of 0.2 (EBOV, BDBV) or 0.5 (SUDV) 
plaque-forming unit (PFU)/cell for 1 hr. Antibody/virus inoculum was then removed and 
fresh culture media was added. At 48 hr post-infection, cells were fixed, and infected cells 
were immunostained using the antibodies KZ52, ADI-15878, and 3C10 for EBOV, BDBV, 
and SUDV and quantitated by automated fluorescence microscopy, as described (Wec et al., 
2016).
Generation of mAbs—Antibodies used for initial binding and neutralization screening, as 
well as germline-reverted (IGL) mAb constructs and WT:IGL chimeras of ADI-15878, were 
expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (Bornholdt et al., 2016b). 
Briefly, yeast cultures were grown in 24-well plates, harvested by centrifugation after 6 
days, and IgGs were purified by protein A-affinity chromatography. IgGs used in in vivo 
challenge experiments were expressed in FreeStyle™ 293-F cells by transient co-
transfection of heavy and light chain plasmids (ThermoFisher). One day prior to 
transfection, HEK293 cells were passaged at 2.0–2.5 × 106 cells per ml. On the day of 
transfection, cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 400 ×g for 5 min, and cell pellets were 
resuspended in fresh FreeStyle F17 medium at a density of 4 × 106 cell per ml and returned 
to the incubator. A transfection mixture was prepared by first diluting the plasmid DNA 
preparations in FreeStyle F17 medium (1.33 μg total plasmid DNA per ml of culture). 
Transfection agent, PEIpro (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France), was then added to the 
diluted DNA at a DNA-to-PEI ratio of 1:2, and the mixture was incubated at room 
temperature for 10 min. The transfection mixture was then added to the culture. Cultures 
were harvested six days post transfection by two rounds of centrifugation, each at 2000 ×g 
for 5 min, and antibodies were purified the clarified conditioned medium by passing over

 Protein A agarose (MabSelect SuRe from GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The bound 
antibodies were washed with PBS, eluted with 200 mM acetic acid[pH 3.5],50 mM NaCl 
into 1/8th volume 2M HEPES[pH 8.0], and buffer-exchanged into PBS.
Fabs were generated by digesting the IgGs with papain for 2 hr at 30°C. Reactions were 
terminated by the addition of iodoacetamide, and the Fab and Fc mixtures were passed over 
Protein A agarose to remove Fc fragments and undigested IgG. The flow-through was then 
passed over CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 affinity resin (ThermoFisher), and eluted and buffer-
exchanged as above.
ELISAs for GP:mAb binding—To identify GP cross-reactive mAbs in Figures 1 and S1, 
normalized amounts of rVSVs bearing EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP were coated onto 
plates at 4°C. Plates were then blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin 
(PBSA), and incubated with dilutions of test antibody (5, 50 nM). Bound Abs were detected 
with anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 
Ultra-TMB colorimetric substrate (Thermo Fisher). All incubations were performed for 1 hr 
at 37°C.
Competition ELISAs for GP/mAb binding to NPC1—The viral lipid envelopes of 
rVSV-EBOV GP particles were labeled with biotin using a function-spacer-lipid construct 
(FSL-biotin) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at pH 7.5 and 37°C, as described (Ng et al., 2014). 
Biotinylated viral particles bearing GPCL were generated by incubation with thermolysin, 
and then captured onto high-binding 96-well ELISA plates precoated with recombinant 
streptavidin (0.65 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). Plates were then blocked with PBSA, and 
incubated with serial dilutions of test mAbs. Washed plates were then incubated with a pre-
titrated concentration of soluble, FLAG epitope-tagged, NPC1 domain C (NPC1–C) protein 
(Bornholdt et al., 2016a), and bound NPC1–C was detected with an anti-FLAG antibody 
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). All incubations were performed for 1 
hr at 37°C.
ELISAs and immunoblots to detect mAb inhibition of GP cleavage—In Figure 
5B, we used exposure of the NPC1-binding site in EBOV GPCL as a proxy for successful 
GP→GPCL cleavage by CatL. rVSV-EBOV GP particles, biotinylated as above, were 
preincubated with mixtures of test mAb and irrelevant human IgG (test mAb at 50, 250, or 
1000 nM; 1000 nM total IgG per reaction) for 1 hr at pH 5.5 and 37°C. Reactions were then 
incubated with CatL (4 ng/μL and 37°C for 30 min). Reactions were then stopped with the 
cysteine cathepsin inhibitor E-64, readjusted to neutral pH with PBS, and captured onto 
streptavidin-coated ELISA plates. NPC1–C binding was measured as above.
Samples treated with the highest concentration of test mAb were also subjected to western 
blotting (Figure 5C). Cleaved GP1 species were detected by immunoblotting with h21D10 
mAb (a gift from Dr. Javad Aman) directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
Selection of viral neutralization escape mutants—Escape mutant selections were 
performed by serial passage of rVSV-GP particles in the presence of test mAb. Briefly, serial 
3-fold dilutions of virus were preincubated with a concentration of mAb corresponding to 
Wec et al.

 the IC90 value derived from neutralization assays, and then added to confluent monolayers 
of Vero cells in 12-well plates, in duplicate. Infection was allowed to proceed to completion 
(> 90% cell death by eye), and supernatants were harvested from the infected wells that 
received the highest dilution (i.e., the least amount) of viral inoculum. Following three 
subsequent passages under mAb selection with virus-containing supernatants as above, 
supernatants from passage 4 were tested for viral neutralization escape. If resistance was 
evident, individual viral clones were plaque-purified on Vero cells, and their GP gene 
sequences were determined as described previously (Wong et al., 2010). The following 
escape mutant selections were performed: ADI-16061 with rVSV-EBOV/Makona GP, 
ADI-15742 with rVSV-SUDV/Boneface GP, ADI-15750 with rVSV-EBOV/Mayinga GP, 
and ADI-15946 with mucin domain-deleted rVSV-BDBV GPΔMuc.
Single-particle electron microscopy—Antibody Fabs and a EBOV GPΔTM 
ectodomain protein were prepared as above, and incubated at a ratio of 10:1 (Fab:GP) 
overnight at 4°C. Complexes were then deposited onto a carbon-coated copper mesh grid, 
and stained with 1% uranyl formate. Samples were imaged on a Tecnai F12 microscope 
using the automated image acquisition software Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005). Images 
were collected with a Tietz 4K CMOS detector at 52,000 × magnification, resulting in a final 
pixel size of 2.05Å at the specimen level. Images were automatically uploaded to and 
processed within our Appion database (Lander et al., 2009). Individual complexes were 
extracted from raw images using DoG Picker (Voss et al., 2009), binned by 2, and placed 
into a stack. The stack was then subjected to reference-free 2D classification using 
MRA/MSA (Ogura et al., 2003). Class averages that did not respond to Fab:EBOV GPΔTM 
complexes were removed from all subsequent analyses. A subset of 2D class averages was 
used to create an initial model using common lines within EMAN2 (Tang et al., 2007). The 
raw particle stack was then refined against the initial model using EMAN2 to yield the final 
3D volumes. UCSF Chimera was used for modeling and figure generation (Goddard et al., 
2007).
Structural representation of ebolavirus GP sequence conservation—To 
graphically represent the degree of sequence conservation of each surface-exposed residue in 
the ebolavirus GP trimer (Figure 4), representative GP sequences from EBOV, TAFV, 
BDBV, SUDV, and RESTV were aligned with CLUSTALW (Larkin et al., 2007). This 
multiple sequence alignment was submitted to the AL2CO server (Pei and Grishin, 2001) to 
calculate a normalized conservation score at each amino acid position, using a BLOSUM62 
matrix. To color residues in the EBOV GPΔTM X-ray crystal structure [PDB: 5JQ3; (Zhao 
et al., 2016)] according to sequence conservation, the crystallographic B-factor associated 
with each residue in the PDB file was first replaced with the conservation score using a 
custom MATLAB script. Residues in this modified PDB file were then recolored in 
MacPymol (Schrödinger) using the script color_b.py (Robert Campbell, http://
pldserver1.biochem.queensu.ca/~rlc/work/pymol/). A 3-color histogram was used to evenly 
assign ranges of conservation scores to ranges of colors.
GP:mAb kinetic binding analysis by biolayer interferometry (BLI)—The Octet 
Red™ system (FortéBio, Pall) was used to determine the binding properties of different

 IgGs to various forms of EBOV GP. Anti-human Fc (AHC) capture sensors (ForteBio) were 
used for initial mAb loading at 25 mg/mL in 1 × kinetics buffer (PBS supplemented with 
0.002% Tween-20 and 1 mg/mL of BSA). Binding to GP was performed across two-fold 
serial dilutions of EBOV GPΔTM or GPCL. The baseline and dissociation steps were carried 
out in the 1 × kinetics buffer as per the instrument manufacturer’s recommendations. For 
analysis of binding at pH 5.5, a 1 × pH 5.5 kinetics buffer (50 mM sodium citrate 
dihydrate[pH 5.5], 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.002% Tween-20 and 1 mg/mL BSA) was 
used in place of the PBS-based 1 × kinetic buffer for all steps. Kinetic binding data in all 
cases are adequately described accurately by a 1:1 binding model (Figures S6A and S6B), 
but given the bivalent nature of the IgG (immobilized) and the trimeric state of GP (analyte), 
the association stoichiometry is likely to be more complex. Thus, koff/kon likely reflects an 
ensemble of binding stoichiometries, and accordingly, we refer to this ratio as apparent KD 
(Kdapp) throughout.
EBOV and SUDV challenge studies in mice—10–12 week old female BALB/c mice 
(Jackson Labs) were challenged via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with EBOV-MA (100 
PFU; ~3,000 LD50). Mice were treated i.p. 2 days post-challenge with PBS vehicle or 300 
μg of each mAb (0.3 mL volume, ≈ 15 mg mAb/kg). Animals were observed daily for 
clinical signs of disease and lethality. Daily observations were increased to a minimum of 
twice daily while mice were exhibiting signs of disease. Moribund mice were humanely 
euthanized on the basis of IACUC-approved criteria.
6–8 week old male and female Type 1 IFN α/β receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFNα/β R−/
−) (Jackson Labs) were challenged with WT SUDV (1000 PFU i.p.). Animals were treated 
i.p. 1 and 4 days post-challenge with PBS vehicle or 300 μg (≈ 15 mg mAb/kg) per dose, 
and monitored and euthanized as above.
BDBV challenge studies in ferrets—Six-month-old ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) 
were challenged via the intramuscular (i.m.) route with WT BDBV (BDBV/H.sap-
tc/UGA/07/Butalya-811250; 1000 TCID50 in 0.5 mL volume), as described previously 
(Kozak et al., 2016). Animals were treated i.p. 3 and 6 days post-challenge with either PBS 
vehicle or 15 mg (day 3) and 10 mg (day 6) of each mAb (2 mL volume/dose). Additionally, 
1 mL blood was taken from each animal on days 0, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, 28 days post-infection to 
determine viral load, measure complete blood counts, and evaluate biochemical markers. 
Animals were monitored twice daily for signs of disease during the course of the 
experiment.
BDBV GP sequencing from ferret blood samples—Total RNA was extracted from 
ferret blood samples at 3, 6, 10, and 14 days post-challenge with the QIAamp Viral RNA 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix 
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR reaction conditions were 
as follows: 45 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s. PCR product 
purification from the agarose gel was performed with the NucleoSpin gel and PCR clean-up 
kit (Macherey-Nagel), and subjected to Sanger DNA sequencing. The sequences were 
aligned to that of the challenge virus preparation and the published BDBV GP sequence

 (Bundibugyo virus/H. sap-tc/UGA/2007/Bundibugyo-200706291; GenBank accession 
number KU182911.1). Sequencing primers are indicated in the Key Resources Table.
Animal welfare statement—Murine challenge studies were conducted under IACUC-
approved protocols in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy, and other 
applicable federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving 
animals. The facility where these studies were conducted (USAMRIID) is accredited by the 
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International 
(AAALAC) and adhere to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals, National Research Council (2011). The animal facility at USAMRIID performs 
routine clinical observations to evaluate anorexia, activity, dehydration and edema. Mice 
were observed daily by assigned Veterinary Medicine Division personnel for husbandry 
conditions, humane care and general health. All procedures for animal care and housing are 
in accordance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996) 
(Clark et al., 1997) and the Animal Welfare Act as amended and standards incorporated in 9 
CFR Part 3, 1991. For all mouse studies described, mice were purchased from commercial 
suppliers and housed in microisolator cages (10 mice per cage) with water and food 
provided ad libitum. Once received, mice were placed in quarantine and evaluated for the 
presence of parasites, infectious agents, or other conditions that could adversely affect the 
studies. At the end of the quarantine period an American College of Laboratory Animal 
Medicine (ACLAM)-certified veterinarian released the animals for use in studies once they 
were determined to be healthy. All mice used for the described studies were naive animals 
that had not previously been used for any other study or previously exposed to test 
antibodies or viruses.
Ferret challenge studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee (ACC) of the 
Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (CSCHAH) in Winnipeg, Canada, 
in accordance with guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC). Ferrets 
were obtained from Marshall BioResources USA, and were monitored daily for food and 
water consumption and given environmental enrichment according to the guidelines for the 
species. Cage cleaning and complete bedding exchange was carried out three times per 
week. Two or three animals were housed per cage in the Allentown caging system. Each unit 
is ventilated with a HEPA blower system and all units are manufactured from stainless steel 
and are autoclavable. Following viral challenge, survival, weight, temperature and overall 
health were monitored daily and recorded on the humane scoring chart. Ferretsused for 
BDBV challenges were previously involved in a non-interventional influenza A virus (IAV 
subtype H5N1) pathogenesis study. Thy were challenged with IAV, and did seroconvert by 
ELISA, but did not present with disease symptoms. No treatments or vaccinations were 
administered in that prior study. BDBV challenge was performed 40 days after the IAV 
infection, a period sufficient for immune recovery of the animals.

 nonlinear regression analysis. 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the extracted IC50 
parameter were estimated under the assumption of normality. Analysis of survival curves in 
Figure 7 was performed with the Mantel-Cox (log-rank) test. Statistical comparisons of viral 
titers in Figure 7F (also see Results) were carried out with a Mann-Whitney U test. Testing 
level (alpha) was 0.05 for all statistical tests. All analyses were carried out in GraphPad 
Prism.

 Figure 4. Predicted bNAb Epitopes
The predicted GP:NAb contact surface is indicated as a yellow outline on a surface-shaded 
representation of the GPΔTM trimer model (PDB: 5JQ3). Each amino acid residue in GP1 
(blue) and GP2 (red) is shaded according to the degree of sequence conservation among 
ebolavirus GP proteins at that position, based on a multiple sequence alignment (light to 
dark, 0% to 100% sequence identity) (see the STAR Methods for details). In (A)–(C), the N–
linked glycan on GP2 residue Asn 563 is indicated as a translucent envelope and green balls-
and-sticks. Antibody contact sites in (C), (E), (G), and (H) are derived from published 
structures of EBOV GP:Fab complexes.

 Figure 5. Mechanistic Basis of Human NAb-Dependent Blockade of Viral Entry
(A) Capacity of NAbs to block EBOV GPCL:NPC1 binding in an ELISA. Immobilized 
rVSV-EBOV GPCL particles were incubated with increasing concentrations of each NAb 
and then with a pre-titrated concentration of purified NPC1 domain C-flag. Binding of 
NPC1 to GPCL was detected with an anti-flag antibody. Means ± SD for three replicates are 
shown.
(B) Capacity of NAbs to block exposure of the RBS mediated by GP → GPCL cleavage. 
rVSV-EBOV GP particles were incubated with cathepsin L (CatL) at pH 5.5 in the presence 
of increasing concentrations of each mAb. GP:NPC1 binding was detected by NPC1 ELISA 
as in (A). Means ± SD for six replicates from two pooled experiments are shown.
(C) Capacity of the NAbs to block EBOV GP → GPCL cleavage. Reactions from (B) were 
resolved by SDS-PAGE, and GP1 was visualized by western blotting. Open triangle, 
uncleaved GP1. Filled triangle, cleaved GP1. Asterisk, partially cleaved GP1 species. Blot 
image has been cropped to show only relevant lanes. (D) Capacity of NAbs to neutralize
