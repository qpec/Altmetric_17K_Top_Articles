ABSTRACT
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication is strongly dependent upon a programmed ribosomal frameshift. Here we
investigate the relationships between the thermodynamic stability of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA frameshift site stem-loop,
frameshift efficiency, and infectivity, using pseudotyped HIV-1 and HEK293T cells. The data reveal a strong correlation between
frameshift efficiency and local, but not overall, RNA thermodynamic stability. Mutations that modestly increase the local stabil-
ity of the frameshift site RNA stem-loop structure increase frameshift efficiency 2-fold to 3-fold in cells. Thus, frameshift effi-
ciency is determined by the strength of the thermodynamic barrier encountered by the ribosome. These data agree with previous
in vitro measurements, suggesting that there are no virus- or host-specific factors that modulate frameshifting. The data also
indicate that there are no sequence-specific requirements for the frameshift site stem-loop. A linear correlation between Gag-
polymerase (Gag-Pol) levels in cells and levels in virions supports the idea of a stochastic virion assembly mechanism. We fur-
ther demonstrate that the surrounding genomic RNA secondary structure influences frameshift efficiency and that a mutation
that commonly arises in response to protease inhibitor therapy creates a functional but inefficient secondary slippery site. Fi-
nally, HIV-1 mutants with enhanced frameshift efficiencies are significantly less infectious, suggesting that compounds that in-
crease frameshift efficiency by as little as 2-fold may be effective at suppressing HIV-1 replication.
IMPORTANCE
HIV, like many retroviruses, utilizes a �1 programmed ribosomal frameshift to generate viral enzymes in the form of a Gag-Pol
polyprotein precursor. Thus, frameshifting is essential for viral replication. Here, we utilized a panel of mutant HIV strains to
demonstrate that in cells, frameshifting efficiency is correlated with the stability of the local thermodynamic barrier to ribo-
somal translocation. Increasing the stability of the frameshift site RNA increases the frameshift efficiency 2-fold to 3-fold. Mu-
tant viruses with increased frameshift efficiencies have significantly reduced infectivity. These data suggest that this effect might
be exploited in the development of novel antiviral strategies.
T
he genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),
like that of other retroviruses, has three genes that encode the
structural proteins Gag, polymerase (Pol), and Env. The expres-
sion of the gag gene results in the synthesis of the Gag precursor
protein, p55, which is subsequently processed by the viral protease
to release the mature Gag proteins p17 (matrix protein), p24 (cap-
sid), p15 (nucleocapsid), and p6 (late domain) and two so-called
spacer peptides (SP) that flank p15, namely, p2 (SP1) and p1
(SP2), respectively (1). The synthesis of Gag precursor protein
alone is sufficient for the assembly and release of noninfectious
virus-like particles (VLPs) (2). The pol gene codes for the p160
polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into the mature en-
zymes reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease
(PR) (3). The pol gene is in the �1 reading frame relative to the gag
gene. The synthesis of the Gag-Pol precursor results from a �1
programmed ribosomal frameshift (�1 PRF) that is stimulated by
a conserved RNA structure and occurs at a frequency of �5%
during translation, resulting in a Gag/Gag-Pol ratio of approxi-
mately 19:1 (4). Thus, frameshifting is essential for the expression
of the viral enzymes and for maintaining the appropriate levels of
Gag and Gag-Pol gene products required for viral assembly. In-
corporation of Gag-Pol or its mature products into virions is re-
quired for infectivity, as the viral enzymes are necessary for the
synthesis and integration of viral cDNA in infected cells (5).
The HIV-1 �1 PRF site is composed of a heptanucleotide slip-
pery sequence (SS) (U UUU UUA [the spaces denote the 0 frame])
followed by a highly stable 11-bp RNA stem-loop that is 8 nucle-
otides downstream of the slippery sequence (6, 7) (Fig. 1). The
slippery site allows near-cognate repairing of the A and P site
tRNA anticodons in the �1 reading frame. The 8-nucleotide (nt)
spacing between the slippery site and the stem-loop corresponds
to the length of mRNA required to span the distance from the
ribosomal A site to the mRNA entrance tunnel on the surface of
the ribosome (6, 8). As the mRNA entrance tunnel is only wide
enough to accommodate single-stranded mRNA, the first few base
pairs of the stem-loop are expected to be engaged with ribosomal

 surface helicase-like proteins S3 and S9 (9, 10) at the time of
frameshifting. Consistent with this, our previous experiments
used a dual-luciferase assay in rabbit reticulocyte lysate to show
that the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3 bp in the
frameshift site stem-loop is highly correlated to frameshift effi-
ciency in vitro (6). However, it is not known if a similar thermo-
dynamic correlation exists within cells during viral replication.
The �1 PRF site of HIV-1 group M is contained within a larger
3-helix-junction secondary structure, which may serve to stall ap-
proaching ribosomes (11). Stalled ribosomes can lead to ribosome
stacking (12), which may decrease frameshift efficiency if the lead-
ing ribosome unwinds the frameshift site RNA structure for the
trailing ribosome to pass through unimpeded. Conversely, if every
ribosome encounters the folded frameshift site stem-loop, de-
creased ribosome density may increase the relative frameshift ef-
ficiency. Consistent with this idea, Brakier-Gingras and coworkers
found that decreased translation initiation of HIV-1 mRNA re-
sulted in increased frameshifting (13). Additionally, we found that
disruption of the genomic secondary structure by mutagenesis led
to increased frameshifting in vitro (6, 14). SHAPE (selective 2-hy-
droxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) data indicate that
the genomic secondary structure is remodeled during translation,
as regions of the RNA are unfolded and sequestered by the ribo-
some (14). The role of the genomic secondary structure surround-
ing the HIV frameshift site has not been investigated in living cells.
The HIV frameshift site genomic secondary structure contains
a UUUUCUU sequence (nucleotides 1676 to 1682). In viruses
resistant to protease inhibitors, a C1680-to-U mutation is fre-
quently found in this region, which creates a UUUUUUU se-
quence that resembles the conserved UUUUUUA slippery se-
quence (15). This site could act as a secondary slippery sequence
that increases the overall amount of frameshifting, thereby in-
creasing the relative amount of protease in order to compensate
for the reduction in protease activity in the presence of inhibitor
(16). At the protein level, this causes a Leu-to-Phe mutation at the
P1-p6 cleavage site that may affect cleavage efficiency and viral
maturation. Previous studies investigating the effect of the
C1680U mutation on frameshifting utilized a truncated RNA con-
struct that did not contain the full frameshift site secondary struc-
ture (16, 17). In vitro, the full secondary structure is required in
order to stimulate frameshifting at the C1680U secondary slippery
site (14). Using a dual-luciferase assay in rabbit reticulocyte lysate,
we found that the C1680U mutation creates a functional slippery
sequence that can be detected when the primary slippery site is
knocked out by mutagenesis (14).
Alteration of the Gag/Gag-Pol ratio from 20:1 to 20:21 has
been achieved by cotransfection of an in-frame Gag-Pol expres-
sion vector, and the resulting increase in the level of Gag-Pol re-
duces the infectivity of progeny viruses and hinders the formation
of stable virion RNA dimers through an unknown mechanism
(18). Thus, the maintenance of normal Gag/Gag-Pol ratios is im-
portant for HIV-1 replication. Although both the proteolytic pro-
cessing of HIV-1 proteins and a normal intracellular Gag/Gag-Pol
ratio are required for RNA dimerization, the formation of stable
RNA dimers is not essential for the packaging of HIV-1 genomic
RNA (18). The importance of maintaining Gag/Gag-Pol levels for
viral infectivity has encouraged the exploration of various ap-
proaches attempting to discover small molecules that could mod-
ulate HIV-1 frameshift efficiency (19–25).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid construction. Gene block DNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies
[IDT], Inc.) of the different mutants were amplified by PCR and sub-
cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The clones were grown us-
ing a dam-negative/dcm-negative (dam�/dcm�) competent Escherichia
coli strain to obtain unmethylated DNA and were then cloned into the
pHIV NL4-3 �Env, �VPR, �Nef, green fluorescent protein-positive
(GFP�) provirus plasmid (26) between the ApaI and BclI restrictions
sites. The resulting plasmid DNA (JB474 wild type [WT], M1 to M11, -SS,
and -SS2) was purified from cell cultures (Qiagen), and the sequences of
all constructs were verified (University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Cen-
ter).
Cell culture, transfections, and Western blot analyses. HEK293T
cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% L-glu-
tamine. Subconfluent monolayers were plated in six-well tissue culture-
treated dishes prior to transfection with 2 �g of plasmids encoding each
mutant version of HIV NL4-3 GFP reporter using polyethylenimine
(PEI). At 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh
medium. When the goal of the assay was to measure frameshifting effi-
ciency in the absence of proteolytic processing, the medium was supple-
mented with a 10 �M concentration of the protease inhibitor saquinavir.
At 48 h after the transfection, the cells and supernatants were harvested as
previously described (27). Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation

 assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and fil-
tered virions were pelleted through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion and
lysed. Total protein concentrations from the cell lysates and purified viri-
ons were measured by the use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay
kit (Pierce), and the same amounts of proteins were used for SDS-PAGE.
SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (28) on a
4% to 15% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred into a
nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with relevant
antisera as follows: a 1:1,000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-HIV-1 p24
antibody (derived from hybridoma 183-H12-5C) (29–31) obtained from
the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Bethesda, MD),
a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-HIV1 p15 antibody (Ab66951;
Abcam), a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal anti-RT antibody (Ab63911; Ab-
cam), a 1:2,500 dilution of rabbit anti-GFP antibody (AB10145; Milli-
pore), and a 1:3,000 dilution of anti-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) anti-
body (H-114 [catalog no. sc-7947]; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The gene
encoding HSP90 is a housekeeping gene and was detected to normalize
band density values to total cell protein values. Secondary IRdye680- or
IRdye800-conjugated antibodies (Li-Cor Biosciences) were used for
quantitative immunoblotting with an Odyssey infrared scanner (Li-Cor
Biosciences). All blot experiments were performed in triplicate.
Immunofluorescence. Subconfluent monolayers of HEK293T cells
cultured in 24-well glass-bottom dishes (Mattek Corporation, Ashland,
MA, USA) were transfected with 1 �g of the different mutants cloned into
pHIV NL4-3 plasmid using PEI. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 solution, and blocked
in NGB buffer (50 mM NH4Cl, 1% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albu-
min) for 1 h. Gag was detected using mouse monoclonal anti-capsid (p24
CA) antiserum (hybridoma 183-H12-5C) (diluted 1:500 in NGB buffer),
rabbit polyclonal anti-matrix (p17 MA) serum (UP595) (diluted 1:500 in
NGB buffer) (32), secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to
Alexa Fluor 546, and anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647
(Invitrogen). Imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted
wide-field microscope (Nikon Corporation, Melville, NY, USA) using a
100� Plan Apo objective lens (numerical aperture [NA], 1.45). Images
were acquired using an Orca-Flash4.0 complementary-metal-oxide-
semiconductor (CMOS) camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Skokie, IL,
USA) and Nikon NIS Elements software. Images were acquired using the
following excitation/emission filter sets (nanometer ranges): 405/450
(DAPI), 490/525 (GFP), 555/605 (Alexa Fluor 546), and 645/705 (Alexa
Fluor 647). Images were processed using FIJI/ImageJ2. For quantification,
cells assessed in three independent experiments using �100 cells per con-
dition (WT and M1 to M6) were scored for the presence of Gag (p24)
immunofluorescence localized at the plasma membrane.
Single-cycle infectivity assays. Subconfluent monolayers of HEK293T
cells cultured in six-well plates were cotransfected with 2 �g of the differ-
ent mutants cloned into pHIV NL4-3 plasmid and 0.2 �g vesicular sto-
matitis virus G (VSV-G) protein expression vector using PEI. At 48 h later,
supernatants were harvested and the virus-like particles (VLPs) were pu-
rified through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion at 21,000 � g for 2 h at 4°C.
Viral pellets were resuspended into 50 �l of phosphate-buffered saline
solution. Subconfluent monolayers of HEK293T cells seeded in 35-mm
cultures were infected using 10 �l of the virion resuspension. Infectivity
assays were performed by two different methods: Western blotting and
calculation of the relative percentages of infected HEK293T cells express-
ing GFP. For the Western blot analyses, the cells were harvested 48 h after
the infection and Western blot analyses were carried out as described
above. The membranes were incubated with a 1:2,500 dilution of rabbit
anti-GFP antibody (AB10145; Millipore) and a 1:3,000 dilution of anti-
heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) antibody (H-114 [catalog no. sc-7947];
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HSP90 was detected to normalize band den-
sity values. To calculate the percentage of GFP-positive 293T cells, the cells
were fixed at 48 h postinfection using 4% paraformaldehyde–phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Nuclei were
stained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and coverslips were
mounted using Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Imaging experiments were per-
formed using a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted wide-field microscope (Nikon
Corp.) and a 10� objective lens (NA, 0.30), as previously described (33).
Images were collected using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics) and
Nikon NIS Elements software (v4.00.03). Images were acquired using
differential interference contrast and the following fluorescence excita-
tion/emission (nanometer ranges) filter sets: 325 to 375/435 to 485
(DAPI) and 490 to 520/520 to 550 (yellow fluorescent protein [YFP]). In
each experiment, total cells and infected cells for 10 distinct fields of view
were counted by two independent observers. Each mutant was assayed
four times. GFP levels were also quantified by Western blot analysis.
Electron microscopy. HEK293T cells were cultured in six-well dishes
and transfected as described above. At 48 h posttransfection, culture su-
pernatants were collected, filtered, and purified through a 20% sucrose
cushion. Virion pellets were fixed in a solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde–
2.0% paraformaldehyde–0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PBS) (pH 7.4)
for �2 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed five times for 5 min
each time in 0.1 M PBS. Rinsed pellets were then postfixed in 1% osmium
tetroxide (OsO4)–1% potassium ferrocyanide–PBS for 1 h at room tem-
perature. Following OsO4 postfixation, the samples were rinsed in PBS as
described above followed by three 5-min rinses performed with distilled
water to clear phosphates and then embedded using increasing concen-
trations (10 ml of components A and M, 10 ml of component B, 300 �l of
component C, and 100 �l of component D) of Durcupan ACM resin
(Fluka AG, Switzerland) at 60°C. Pellets were sectioned using a Leica
electron microscopy (EM) UC6 ultramicrotome with 100-nm sections
collected on 300-mesh Cu thin-bar grids and were contrasted using Reyn-
olds lead citrate–8% uranyl acetate–50% ethyl alcohol (EtOH). The sec-
tions were observed with a Philips CM120 transmission electron micro-
scope, and images were documented with a MegaView III (Olympus-SIS,
Lakewood, CO) side-mounted digital camera.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means � standard errors of
the means. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Newman-Keuls test for multiple
comparisons (GraphPad Prism Program v5.0). Differences were classified
as significant for P values of �0.05 (#) and �0.001 (*).
RESULTS
Correlation between local thermodynamic stability of the stem-
loop and frameshift efficiency in cells. The sequence of the
frameshift site stem-loop was modified in order to dissect the
relative contributions of local and overall RNA thermodynamic
stability to HIV-1 frameshift efficiency in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1).
It is not possible to generate the range of thermodynamic stabili-
ties needed to systematically test the correlation between RNA
stability and frameshift efficiency using silent mutations. There-
fore, the mutations shown in Fig. 1 also result in amino acid sub-
stitutions in the p1 spacer region (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). In order to measure frameshift efficiency, the highly
effective protease inhibitor saquinavir (34) was used to inhibit
proteolytic processing and allow the accurate quantification of
Gag-Pol/Gag ratios. We observed that increased local stability of
the first few base pairs results in significant increases in the frame-
shift efficiency (Fig. 2A and B; M1 to M3). No significant changes
were observed for the mutants with lower local stability of the first
3 bp (Fig. 2A and B; M6, M7, and M8) or for the mutants with
decreased overall stability of the frameshift site stem-loop (Fig. 2A
and B; M5). Frameshift efficiency was plotted as a function of
overall stability and local (3-bp) stability using previously de-
scribed free energy values (6). The data from the mutants showed
a modest correlation as a function of overall RNA stability (R2 �

 0.67); however, we observed a strong correlation (R2 � 0.95) be-
tween frameshifting and the thermodynamic stability of the first 3
bp (Fig. 2E and F). These results are highly similar to previously
described in vitro data (6). As expected, no frameshifting was de-
tected when the slippery site was mutated to a nonslippery se-
quence (Fig. 2A and B).
In purified VLPs from our panel of mutants, we observed a
pattern of Gag-Pol/Gag ratios that mirrored the data obtained
from cell lysates (Fig. 2A to D). We noted that the Gag-Pol levels in
purified HIV-1 VLPs were higher than in cells (�20% versus 7%
for the WT), suggesting that molecular interactions assist in re-
cruiting Gag-Pol into virions. However, the strong linear correla-
tion (R2 � 0.93) between Gag-Pol/Gag ratios in cell lysates and
VLPs (Fig. 2G) demonstrates that intracellular Gag-Pol concen-
trations determine the relative levels of Gag-Pol in virions. This
observation is consistent with a stochastic mechanism regulating
the relative rate of Gag-Pol incorporation, similar to that recently
reported for the gammaretrovirus Moloney murine leukemia vi-
rus (35). Similar results were obtained when no protease inhibitor
was added to the media (data not shown).
Influence of the frameshift site on genomic secondary struc-
ture. We also studied the influence of the HIV-1 genomic second-
ary structure surrounding the frameshift site. A secondary struc-
ture model derived from SHAPE data was derived previously (11)
(Fig. 3); more recently, an alternative secondary structure was
proposed for this region of the RNA (36). The two secondary
structures contained the highly stable stem-loop (Fig. 1) and “an-
choring helix” (Fig. 3) but mainly differed in whether or not the
slippery sequence was base paired. The weak thermodynamic sta-
bility of the slippery sequence helix is consistent with formamide
titration data (14). Previously, we showed that the anchoring helix
modulates frameshifting in vitro, with disruption of this helix
causing an increase in frameshifting (6, 14). Analysis of cell lysate
shows that disruption of the anchoring helix (mutant M9) signif-
icantly increased the frameshift efficiency in cells (Fig. 3A to C). In
purified VLPs, the M9 mutant on average also incorporated more

 Gag-Pol, although the effect was not statistically significant at a P
value of �0.05 (Fig. 3D and E).
We next explored whether the C1680U mutation associated
with patients on protease inhibitor therapy (15, 16) could func-
tion as a secondary slippery site in cells. When the primary slip-
pery sequence was inactivated by double mutation (-SS), the
frameshift efficiency decreased to near-background levels (Fig. 4).
The same was true when both the primary and potential secondary
slippery sites (-SS2) were knocked out (Fig. 4). The C1680U mu-
tant (M10) produced slightly higher levels of frameshifting in
cells, although the effect was not statistically significant. The slight
increase in frameshifting seen with C1680U suggests that the sec-
ondary slippery site is not as efficient as the primary slippery site.
Additionally, the M10 mutant had lower overall Gag-Pol levels in
VLPs (see Discussion). Most notably, when the primary slippery
site was knocked out, the C1680U mutant (M11) displayed frame-
shifting levels that were clearly enhanced relative to those seen
with the -SS slippery site control mutant but not as high as those
seen with the WT (Fig. 4). We conclude that the C1680U mutation
does indeed induce frameshifting at the secondary site, albeit less
efficiently than the primary frameshift site.
Effects of altered Gag-Pol/Gag ratios on cell lysate and VLP
protein processing. The expression of the gag gene resulted in the
synthesis of a precursor Gag protein, p55, which was subsequently
processed by the viral protease into the mature Gag proteins p17
(matrix), p24 (capsid), p7 (nucleocapsid), and p6 (late domain)
(Fig. 5). Since the expression of protease is dependent upon
frameshifting, we wished to determine if the altered ratios of Gag-

 Pol/Gag induced by our various mutations influenced the proteo-
lytic processing of viral proteins. We used Western blotting with
antibodies against p24 or p15 nucleocapsid-p6 precursor to mon-
itor protein processing 48 h after the transfection of HEK293T
cells, in the absence of saquinavir, for both cell lysates and purified
VLPs. The p15 precursor protein was detectable in purified VLPs
but not in cell lysates. Protein levels were normalized to p55, p41,
and p24 combined in order to detect possible differences in p24
levels.
The mutants M4, M5, M6, and M7 all exhibited WT levels of
frameshifting, and no significant differences in proteolytic pro-
cessing patterns were observed for these mutants in cell lysates and
purified VLPs (Fig. 5A and B). The mutants with increased frame-
shift efficiency (M1, M2, M3, and M9) also did not show signifi-
cant differences in Gag processing in cells, with the exception of a
significantly increased amount of p24 for M1, perhaps because
this mutant had the highest Gag-Pol levels (and therefore the
highest level of protease expression) (Fig. 5A). In the VLPs, the
M1, M2, and M3 mutants had decreased levels of p55 precursor
and corresponding increases in p24 abundance. These data are
consistent with higher levels of proteolytic processing for mutants
M1 to M3 with increased frameshifting.
As expected, the mutants that cannot express Gag-Pol due to a
knocked-out primary slippery site sequence (-SS) and alternate
slippery sequence (-SS2) showed an increase in relative amounts
of p55 precursor in both cell lysates and VLPs, while p24 levels
were nearly undetectable (Fig. 5). Interesting expression and pro-
cessing differences were observed in VLPs for the M10 and M11
mutants with the alternate slippery site mutation (Fig. 5C). M10
exhibited decreased p55 and increased p24 levels, consistent with
an increase in proteolytic processing. In contrast, M11 showed the
inverse pattern—increased p55 and decreased p24 levels (Fig. 5C).
These data are consistent with the significantly lower levels of
Gag-Pol expression for M11 due to knockout of the primary slip-
pery site (Fig. 4).
Assessment of the effect of increased frameshift efficiency on
viral infectivity. A single-cycle infectivity assay was used to assess
the effect of the frameshift site mutations on viral infectivity. The
viral Nef gene was replaced by GFP to enable quantification of
viral gene expression in infected cells using fluorescence micros-
copy. Representative images of the assay are shown in Fig. 6A. For
each mutant, the top panel shows the nucleus stained with DAPI

 (Fig. 6B). We note that these RNA mutations alter the amino acid
sequence in the p7-p1-p6 region (predominately p1) (see Fig. S1
in the supplemental material). The p1 peptide sequence is thought
to be nonessential as long as it is proteolytically cleaved, because
the majority of it can be deleted without significantly impacting
infectivity (37). The mutations also alter the sequence of p6* in
Gag-Pol, which overlaps p1-p6 and is also widely dispensable for
infectivity (38). The M4 and M5 mutants have altered p1 peptide
sequences and were nearly as infectious as the WT (Fig. 6; see also
Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In contrast, the M6 and M7
mutants exhibited normal levels of frameshifting (Fig. 2) but
were poorly infectious (Fig. 6), perhaps because these mutants

 have a glycine-to-tryptophan mutation directly adjacent to the
p1-p6 cleavage site that may interfere with cleavage (see Fig.
S1) (37). We were unable to address this hypothesis because the
p1-p6 cleavage event could not be resolved in our Western blot
analyses.
The M8 mutant was 10-fold less infectious than the WT (Fig.
6). In this mutant, the RNA mutations conservatively altered a
single amino acid in the middle of p1 (Trp to Phe; see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material), whereas much of the frameshift site stem-
loop was disrupted. For this mutant, Gag-Pol levels were slightly
lower in cell lysates and significantly lower in VLPs (Fig. 2). In
contrast, M9 showed an increase in frameshifting due to disrup-
tion of the anchoring helix (Fig. 3) and also exhibited lowered
infectivity (Fig. 6). The M11, -SS, and -SS2 mutants all exhibited
low levels of frameshifting due to mutation of the primary slippery
site (Fig. 4). Correspondingly, these mutants had low infectivity,
as expected (Fig. 6).
Frameshift site mutations do not affect Gag expression and
localization in cells. We tested a subset of mutants (M1 to M6)
using immunofluorescence to investigate whether the frameshift
site mutations affect Gag stability or localization in cells (Fig. 7).
Antibodies against capsid and matrix showed no detectable differ-
ences in protein expression or cellular localization. Transfected
cells were scored for Gag localization to the plasma membrane,
which revealed that �90% of cells showed plasma membrane lo-
calization of Gag for the WT and M1 to M6 (Fig. 7 and data not
shown). Therefore, the decreased infectivity associated with the
M1-to-M3 frameshift mutants is not due to changes in Gag stabil-
ity or localization.
We next investigated how frameshift site mutations affect the
measurable levels of reverse transcriptase (RT). The M1, M2, and
M3 mutants with increased frameshifting efficiencies all showed
increased expression of RT in cell lysates (Fig. 8A and B). We
observed an approximately 2-fold increase in RT levels, which

 agrees well with the 2-fold to 3-fold increase in frameshifting ob-
served for these mutants. The M4-to-M7 mutants have wild-type
frameshift efficiencies (Fig. 2) and also wild-type levels of RT (Fig.
8A and B). M8 showed relatively low RT expression consistent
with its low infectivity (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the RT levels were
much less variable in the VLPs than in the cell lysates (Fig. 8C and
D). Similar per-particle RT normalization results were previously
described by Mak and colleagues (39), and the data may imply that
a set threshold level of RT is retained in association with the nu-
cleocapsid postmaturation.
Virion morphology was analyzed by negative-stain electron
microscopy for a subset of our mutants (Fig. 9). The purified
particles were categorized as immature, i.e., as particles in which
Gag molecules are radially arranged and in contact with the
plasma membrane, or as mature, i.e., as particles containing elec-
tron density associated with conical or round cores. No significant
morphology differences were observed between the WT and the
mutants assayed, even for the mutants that exhibited strongly re-
duced infectivity. At least 40 purified virions were imaged for each
sample. We found that for the WT and all mutants tested, �70%
of the virions imaged contained density consistent with the pres-
ence of mature viral cores. The percentages of mature viral cores
differed by less than 10% for all samples imaged. Thus, the ob-
served decreased infectivity associated with the M1 and M2 mu-
tants at this level of resolution is not due to large-scale defects in
Gag assembly or virion morphogenesis. These results agree with
the relatively normal proteolytic processing patterns detected for
the VLPs (Fig. 5C), as well as with the normal RT levels associated
with the mutant VLPs (Fig. 8C).
DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrated that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency in cells is
directly correlated (R2 � 0.95) with the local thermodynamic sta-
bility of the frameshift site stem-loop. In contrast, the correlation
with overall thermodynamic stability is weaker (R2 � 0.67). A
previous study concluded that overall thermodynamic stability
correlates with frameshift efficiency but did not systematically (or
quantitatively) parse relative thermodynamic contributions (39).
Local stability determines frameshift efficiency because the ribo-
some unwinds mRNA helical structures 3 bp at a time, and this is
the thermodynamic barrier that is encountered by the ribosome
when it is engaged at the slippery site. The excellent agreement
between these data and previous in vitro (rabbit reticulocyte ly-
sate) measurements (6) indicates there are no additional viral or
host factors that modulate frameshift efficiency. Our data also
provide strong evidence that the functional frameshift site struc-
ture in cells is a stem-loop, as originally proposed by Jacks et al.
(4), with no additional sequence-specific requirements. This is
consistent with the observation that a stem-loop with an entirely
different sequence but similar stability is fully functional in frame-
shifting (38). An alternative structure for the frameshift site in-
volving tandem pseudoknots was recently proposed (40). How-
ever, our data are inconsistent with that model, as the mutations
employed in the present study that either stimulate or have no
effect on frameshifting would disrupt base pairs in the proposed
pseudoknots.
The 3-helix-junction secondary structure surrounding the
HIV frameshift site has a high pairing probability, as determined

were fixed 48 h posttransfection. Differences between WT and the frameshift mutants in capsid (p24) expression do not appear to have affected Gag localization
within the cell. Viral GFP expression data indicate transfected cells.

 by evolutionary conservation, low SHAPE reactivity, and high
predicted thermodynamic stability (11, 14). Here we show that
this secondary structure modulates frameshift efficiency in cells.
Disruption of the anchoring helix (M9) led to significantly in-
creased frameshifting (Fig. 3) and lower infectivity (Fig. 6). The
lower infectivity associated with this mutant may have been due to
the W-to-Y mutation in the p7 (zinc knuckle 2 region) of nucleo-
capsid which is involved in genomic RNA recognition (41) or to a
change in RNA structure and frameshifting efficiency or to a com-
bination of these effects. M9 also has two mutations in the Pol p6*
region (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), although this
region has been reported to tolerate multiple amino acid substi-
tutions without loss of infectivity (42).
The C1680U mutation induced a functional secondary slip-
pery site (Fig. 4) that was less efficient than the primary slippery
site. This was likely due the fact that there is only a weak (3-bp)
helix downstream of the secondary slippery site, which is likely
inefficient at inducing ribosomal pausing. The C1680U mutant
frameshifted at levels only slightly higher than those seen with the
WT (Fig. 4; M10) and yet had low infectivity (Fig. 6; M10). We
hypothesize that the low infectivity associated with M10 was due
to mutation of the p1-p6 cleavage site (NFL to NFF) (see Fig. S1 in
the supplemental material). Interestingly, mutations at proteo-
lytic processing sites associated with drug resistance have been
previously observed to be profoundly codependent on the drug
for processing and infectivity (43). Thus, it would be interesting to
investigate whether the C1680U mutation operates through a sim-
ilar mechanism. It is possible that the C1680 mutation is opti-
mized to simultaneously allow enhanced frameshifting and in-
creased proteolytic processing in the presence of inhibitor. Such
coordination at both the RNA and protein levels may allow the
C1680U mutant to achieve a new optimal Gag-Pol/Gag ratio in
the presence of protease inhibitor.
It is interesting that the M1 and M2 mutants had frameshift-
ing levels that were 2-fold to 3-fold higher (Fig. 2) and low
infectivity (Fig. 6). We detected no gross defects in processing
(Fig. 5C), RT content (Fig. 8C), or viral morphology (Fig. 9) for
these mutants. However, we did observe that the M1 and M2
mutants had protein patterns consistent with increased proteo-
lytic processing relative to the WT, including lower levels of

 p55 Gag precursor and higher levels of p24 capsid (Fig. 5C).
Therefore, the low infectivity of these mutants might be a con-
sequence of protease overexpression. Other interesting mu-
tants include M8 and M9, which have a disrupted stem-loop
and anchoring helix, respectively. Surprisingly, M8 frame-
shifted only slightly less well than the WT (Fig. 2). This was
likely due to the fact that the slippery sequence plays a domi-
nant role in frameshifting (Fig. 4) and also suggests that the
stem-loop can tolerate mismatches.
The ratios of Gag-Pol/Gag in VLPs correlate well with those
observed in cell lysates (Fig. 2, 3, and 4), consistent with a stochas-
tic mechanism for Gag-Pol incorporation into budding virions.
However, we also observed that Gag-Pol/Gag ratios were enriched
in virions relative to lysates, consistent with the selective recruit-
ment of Gag-Pol into VLPs. The mechanism for preferential re-
cruitment of Gag-Pol into assembling capsids is not understood
but is likely to reflect one or more features of the pol gene relevant
to the assembly pathway.
Finally, our observation that a very modest (2-to-3-fold) in-
crease in frameshift efficiency can significantly decrease HIV-1
infectivity is encouraging in considering frameshifting as a poten-
tial therapeutic target. Indeed, compounds designed to bind to the
frameshift site are capable of inhibiting viral replication (20).
Therefore, further development and optimization of compounds
that can target frameshifting seem warranted.
