Abstract
IMPORTANCE Pediatric intensive care unit care conferences often involve high-stakes decisions
regarding critically ill children, resulting in strong family emotions. Families often report the need for
physician empathy.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the characteristics of physician empathetic statements during pediatric
intensive care unit care conferences.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this single-center, cross-sectional, qualitative
phenomenology study, 68 transcripts of audio-recorded care conferences were analyzed from an
urban, quaternary medical center from January 3, 2013, to January 5, 2017. Thirty physicians and 179
family members of 68 children participated in care conferences. Data analysis was conducted from
June 5, 2017, to October 12, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to code
physician empathetic statements and family’
s responses to these statements. Empathetic
statements were classified using the previously published NURSE pneumonic (naming,
understanding, respecting, supporting, exploring) and coded as unburied (statement followed by a
pause allowing the family time to respond) or buried (empathetic statement encased in medical talk
or terminated with a closed-ended statement). Family responses were categorized into 3 themes:
alliance (emotion continued), cognitive (medical talk), or none. Missed opportunities for physicians
to respond with empathy were identified.
RESULTS Thirty physicians participated, of whom 13 (43%) were male, 24 (80%) were white, 24
(80%) had more than 5 years of practice, 10 (33%) specialized in critical care, and 7 (23%) specialized
in hematology/oncology. Within 68 care conferences, physicians recognized families’emotional cues
74% of the time, making 364 empathetic statements. Of these statements, 224 (61.5%) were
unburied and 140 (38.5%) were buried. Buried statements were most commonly followed by
medical talk (133 [95.0%]). Unburied empathetic statements were associated with alliance
responses from the family 71.4% of the time compared with 12.1% of the time when the statement
was buried (odds ratio, 18; 95% CI, 10.1-32.4; P < .001). Physicians missed an opportunity to address
emotion 26% of the time, with at least 1 missed opportunity occurring in 53 conferences (78%).
Physicians attended to all family emotions in only 5 conferences (7%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this analysis, physicians responded with empathy frequently,
but responses were buried within other pieces of medical data or missed entirely in nearly one-third
of conferences. When physicians responded using unburied empathetic statements and allowed

Key Points
Question When physicians attend to
family emotions, how does it influence
ensuing communication?
Findings In this qualitative study of 68
pediatric intensive care conferences
with 179 family members, physicians
recognized family emotions 74% of the
time and missed opportunities to
respond to emotion 26% of the time.
When physicians’empathetic
statements were followed by a pause,
rather than additional medical talk,
family-participants were 18-fold more
likely to share concerns, hopes,
or values.
Meaning When physicians attend to
emotions and then stop, family-
participants have time to express
emotions and provide valuable
information.

Introduction
Care conferences between physicians and families of critically ill children in the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) are often convened to review a patient’
s condition, discuss prognosis, and/or make
an important medical decision.1-3 Most often, care conferences are offered when a patient’
s clinical
condition has worsened or when there is a need for medical decisions about the plan of care.1
Because these meetings typically involve high-stakes decisions, such as whether to limit life-
sustaining therapies, families are under extreme stress and emotions are strong.4-6 Studies have
shown families experience powerful positive and negative feelings during their time in the intensive
care unit (ICU).6-8 These may be further heightened when discussing serious news or facing life-
changing decisions.
Families have consistently reported a desire for their physicians to show empathy.9,10 Empathy
is a vital component of high-quality health care,11,12 and physician statements of empathy are an
important source of support for patients and their families.13 Literature from adult ICUs suggests
physicians infrequently show empathy14 and often miss opportunities to connect with families.15 We
do not know how often pediatricians show empathy or how expressions of sentiments affect
communication during care conferences. Our objectives were to evaluate the characteristics of
physician empathetic statements during family care conferences in the PICU. We also explored if and
when these opportunities were missed.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional, qualitative phenomenology study analyzing 68
transcripts of family-physician care conferences in the PICU. Transcripts were collected from January
3, 2013, to January 5, 2017, from an urban, quaternary medical center with a 44-bed mixed medical
and surgical PICU, excluding patients with primary cardiac conditions, who were cared for in a
separate cardiac ICU. This study was approved by the Children’
s National Health System institutional
review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in the care
conference.
Data Collection
We defined a care conference as a scheduled meeting between the family of a critically ill child
(newborn to 26 years) and the PICU attending physician or primary consultant. In our PICU, care
conferences are convened at the discretion of the PICU attending physician or by family request.
Eligible care conferences included those in which the PICU attending physician or primary
consultant anticipated discussing a medical decision with an English-speaking family of a critically ill
child. Medical decisions were defined as decisions to initiate, escalate, or withdraw medical
interventions, such as endotracheal tubes, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, surgical
procedures, and discussions of resuscitation status. We only included weekday care conferences,
which was when primary care team members were most available. We excluded conferences with
the intention to discuss discharge planning or provide a medical update because our primary goal
was to assess physician use of empathy during high-stakes, decision-making care conferences.
To identify care conferences, study personnel contacted PICU attending physicians each
weekday morning to determine if they anticipated conducting a care conference. After screening for

 eligibility, study personnel consulted with the care team (ie, clinical nurse, social worker, and
attending physician) to determine if there were reasons this particular family should not be
approached. Families were eligible to participate once in the study; attending physicians could be
enrolled up to 4 times. Each care conference was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, with
personal identifiers removed prior to analysis. We collected demographic data from families via
surveys and clinical data from electronic medical records. We also collected demographic data from
the physicians via surveys, including years of practice, medical specialty, sex, and race.
Data Analysis
Our primary outcome measure was to conduct a qualitative thematic analysis following Standards for
Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) reporting guidelines to code physician empathetic statements
in care conferences and the family’
s response to these statements. We also analyzed empathetic
statements made by other members of the health care team. We applied directed content analysis16
to code the empathetic statements and responses. We used investigator triangulation,17 with 3
investigators (T.W.O., Z.B.D., and A.R.R.) reviewing all transcripts and 2 reviewing all codes. For context,
we represented pediatric clinicians with experience in critical care (T.W.O.), oncology (A.R.R.), palliative
care (T.W.O. and A.R.R.), and investigators with formal training in health services and qualitative research
(T.W.O., Z.B.D., and A.R.R.). Additionally, Dr October may have had direct clinical contact with
participants as one of their attending physicians, although she was neither in that role nor present for
any of the recorded care conferences.
Any discrepancies in coding were resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached. A
random sample of 20% of the comments was then selected by a third researcher to determine
interrater reliability between the 2 coders; Cohen κ was 0.85 (P < .001). Quantitative data were
analyzed using SPSS Statistics software version 24 (IBM).
An empathetic statement was defined as any statement made by a physician that attempted to
convey the physician understood or shared the family’
s emotional state. A family’
s emotional state
was defined as statements expressing negative emotion, such as sadness, anger, frustration, or
helplessness, eg, “Seeing her lying there, not being able to comfort her, I feel so helpless.” We used
the NURSE pneumonic (naming, understanding, respecting, supporting, exploring)13,18 to identify
and classify the empathetic statements into 5 categories: naming the family’
s emotion,
understanding the family’
s emotional response, respecting the family‘
s expert role in the child’
s care,
supporting the family’
s needs and/or decisions, and exploring the family’
s feelings, concerns, or
hopes. For example, if a family member hears upsetting news and says, “I am so upset I wasn’
t there,”
an empathetic response from the physician of, “You have been such a good parent to your child.
Always at his bedside,” would classify as a respect NURSE statement.
Empathetic statements were coded as unburied or buried. Unburied statements were defined
as empathetic statements made by the physician followed by a pause to allow the family time to
respond. Contrarily, buried statements were defined as empathetic statements made by the
physician and obscured in 1 of the following ways: (1) medical talk, which was (a) encased in more
than 2 sentences of medical text; (b) linked with “but” and followed by more medical talk; or (c)
followed by a second physician speaking, not allowing time for a family response; or (2) closure by the
physician, who asked a closed-ended question.
We collected the family’
s response to the physician’
s buried or unburied empathetic statement
and categorized them based on emergent themes. Family responses fell into 3 themes: an alliance
response, a cognitive response, or no response (Table 1). Alliance responses were defined as
statements that deepened the emotional discussion, expressed gratitude, demonstrated agreement,
or expressed mourning. Cognitive responses were defined as statements in which the family asked
a medical question or continued to talk about medical information, ignoring the emotional
statement. No response occurred when the conversation ended without a family response either
because the physician asked a closed-ended question or a member of the health care team
interrupted, preventing the family from responding to the emotional statement.

 Differences between family responses to physician buried vs unburied empathetic statements
were calculated using Pearson χ2 analysis with a 2-sided α of .05, and odds ratios with 95%
confidence intervals are presented. Differences between medical specialty, physician sex, or number
of years of practice and buried vs unburied statements were calculated using Fisher exact test.
We identified missed opportunities for physicians to show empathy. These missed
opportunities, as defined by Curtis et al,15 were classified as passages in which the physician failed to
respond to a family’
s emotional statements. For example, a family member may say, “This shouldn’
t
happen to a baby.” A physician’
s response of “Let’
s talk about the next steps” would classify as a
missed opportunity rather than responding with an empathetic statement. If the same missed
opportunity was present multiple times throughout the same passage of the transcript but was still
representative of the same theme, it was collectively counted as 1 missed opportunity.
Results
Demographic Characteristics
We identified 88 eligible care conferences, of which 10 families declined participation because they
did not consent to audiotaping (n = 3) or felt emotionally overwhelmed (n = 7). An additional 10
families were not approached based on the care team’
s recommendation (eg, if there was concern for
psychologic instability or if there was legal involvement), resulting in 68 audio-recorded family-
physician care conferences (77% enrollment). A total of 179 family members participated in the 68
care conferences; 67 (99%) included the mother, 50 (74%) included the father, and 62 (91%)
included an additional family member.
A total of 30 physicians participated. Of these, 13 (43%) were male, 24 (80%) were white, 24
(80%) had more than 5 years of practice, 10 (33%) specialized in critical care, and 7 (23%) specialized
in hematology/oncology (Table 2). In the 68 care conferences, the most common decision discussed
was tracheostomy placement (30 [44%]), followed by the family’
s goals (13 [19%]), surgical
procedure (10 [15%]), and medical treatment (9 [13%]). Of the participating patients, 43 (64%) were
black, and 15 (22%) were white. They were most commonly discharged home (29 [43%]) or to a
subacute facility (19 [28%]). Fifteen (22%) died during hospitalization. The care conferences’
participants included on average 2.6 family members and 6 health care team members. Aside from
physicians, other health care team members included most often a social worker (62 [91%] of care
conferences), a case manager (29 [43%]), or a bedside nurse (24 [35%]).

Sample Quotea
Alliance response
Deepen emotional discussion
Family shares their hopes and fears
Physician: This is not making sense, I understand. It is no one’s intent to have such a
thing happen…and it’s a nightmare.
Family: It is, and it’s never going to end because my son won’t be leaving out here
with me. I don’t know what to do.
Express gratitude
Family expresses thanks for the care or concern from
the physician
Physician: He’s so lucky to have you guys…he has an amazing family—you all are
amazing. Are there any questions we haven’t answered?
Family: No questions. I really, really appreciate it. He wouldn’t have survived without
you, so I really appreciate the doctors and the hospital.
Agreement with physician
Family statement aligns with the physician’s
statement
Family: I agree. I think that talking to the tracheostomy nurse would be a good idea.
Express mourning
Family becomes tearful or asks for a moment to
collect themselves
Family: [family crying]
Cognitive response
Family asks a medical question or makes a statement
continuing the medical talk, ignoring the empathetic
statement
Physician: Believe me, we want to do that. We want to do what’s best for him as fast
as possible. We thought about removing the kidneys first, but it’s a big surgery. He
won’t make any urine anymore. His kidney function is declining, but still the kidneys
are doing at least a little bit, and that helps even a little bit. So that’s why we want to
try this peritoneal dialysis first.
Family: That would be a drastic change, removing the kidney.
No response
Conversation ends without a response from the
family because the physician asked closed-ended
question or a member of the health care team
interrupted prior to a family response
Physician: I think you guys did a great job. You expressed your thoughts very clearly
and we had a good 2-way conversation. We’ll come in separately for the week and
touch base with you. Alright?
Family: Mmhmm.

 Empathetic Statements
In the 68 conferences, physicians recognized families’emotional cues 74% of the time, making 364
empathetic statements identified using the NURSE pneumonic (range, 1-15 statements per
conference; mean, 2.8 statements per conference) (Table 3). Of these 364 empathetic statements,
224 (61.5%) were unburied and 140 (38.5%) were buried. Buried statements were most commonly
followed by medical talk (133 [95.0%]), of which 72 (54.1%) featured the same physician continuing
with medical data, 34 (25.6%) featured the same physician connecting the empathetic statement
with medical talk using “but,” and 27 (20.3%) featured a second physician interrupting with more

 medical data. The remaining 7 buried statements (5.3%) were followed by a closed-ended question
(Table 4). We did not find a relationship between whether the empathetic statement was buried or
unburied and physician medical specialty, sex, or years of practice.
Another member of the health care team, such as the social worker or bedside nurse, was
present in all 68 care conferences and spoke on average 5% of the time. In 47 care conferences
(69%), they did not verbally contribute an emotional statement. In the remaining 21 care
conferences (31%), nonphysician team members made 53 empathetic statements, of which 46
(87%) were unburied and 7 (13%) were buried. Using the NURSE pneumonic, 48 statements (25%)
were naming, 90 (28%) were respecting, and 83 (30%) were supporting statements.
Family Responses Based on Type of Empathetic Statement (Buried or Unburied)
When comparing family responses with unburied and buried empathetic statements, we found when
physicians buried the empathetic statement, it frequently stopped the progression of the
conversation and led to an alliance response only 12.1% (17 of 140) of the time (Table 5). Contrarily,
when physicians made an empathetic statement and paused to allow the family time to respond, the
family was able to continue to emote and led to an alliance response of 71.4% (160 of 224) of the
time. The odds of a physician receiving an alliance response from families was 18-fold higher (95% CI,
10.1-32.4; P < .001) when the physician used an unburied statement compared with a buried
statement. Buried statements also did not result in any family expressions of mourning, such as
crying or asking for time to collect themselves, whereas unburied empathetic statements resulted in
expressions of mourning in 14 responses (8.8%).

 Missed Opportunities for Empathy
Missed opportunities were occasions when the family expressed an emotion and the physician did
not respond with empathy, which occurred 125 times (26% of empathetic opportunities). At least 1
missed opportunity occurred in 53 conference (78%). In only 5 conferences (7%) were all of the
family’
s emotional opportunities attended to by the physician. We identified 5 categories of missed
opportunities based on when physicians
(1) Responded with a medical statement (44 [35%]),
Family: I’
m nervous about going home with that [chest tube]. It scares me.
Physician: At one point, we were even debating putting a chest tube in that Saturday. We all
thought it was the right thing to do for [patient]. If you pull that chest tube out, he would feel short
of breath. It would trap secretions into his lungs; it would set him up for infection. I think it would be
painful and I think there’
s a chance that it could compromise the blood flow to his body and be what
we call a tension pneumothorax.
(2) Negated the family’
s emotional statement by attempting to discount it as false (29 [23%]),
Family: I told them when he cries so loud and his whole body turns red and he gets very still—it
really worried me. It wasn’
t just the cry, it was his body language. It wasn’
t often, it would just be at
certain times, he would do exactly what I just said, and it worried me.
Physician: The most common reason for a baby to do that is actually reflux, especially if it
happens episodically like that.
(3) Pivoted by simply moving on to another topic (29 [23%]),
Family: That’
s the only option. It’
s either [the tracheostomy] or he passes away and I don’
t think
that’
s fair to him.
Physician: Do you have family down in [location]?
(4) Ignored the comment completely (20 [16%]),
Family: I feel like he’
s in pain. I know you guys don’
t, but I do. I know you guys might think I’
m
wrong, but he’
s so sensitive… He was breathing on his own a little yesterday, until he started the
breathing treatment, which was really rough on him. So I don’
t know if he shut down because of pain.
Physician: Yeah, the breathing issues are something we’
re going to have to address eventually.
(5) Deferred responsibility to another member of the health care team (3 [2%]),
Family: It’
s very concerning to us. We feel someone needs to be ultimately responsible for her
case…and not have 10 different hands in the pot.
Physician: I have not seen her before this. I’
ve only heard and talked about her
echocardiograms, but she was seen by the heart failure team, not the general cardiology
consult team.
Discussion
Expressions of emotion from families during decision-making discussions regarding a critically ill child
are common, and finding the right response to a family’
s emotion can be challenging. When families

 express emotions, physicians may recognize it and respond empathetically or they might miss or
ignore the opportunity, pressing on in the delivery of medical data. We wanted to assess how these
types of responses impact the flow of conversation and whether they help or hinder family-physician
communication.
Like other studies,19,20 we found physicians responded with empathy frequently. In this study
we demonstrated that how the physician responded empathetically made a difference. Importantly,
in nearly half of cases where the empathy was transparent and unburied, the conversation
progressed or deepened, and physicians learned new information about a family’
s motivations, fears,
worries, and/or hopes.
Empathy not only builds the physician-family relationship,21-23 it also helps physicians make
treatment recommendations by promoting better data collection and information gathering. Value-
laden decisions require input from patients and their families.24 In 2016, the American College of
Critical Care Medicine identified preference-sensitive decisions, such as tracheostomy placement,
goals of care, or withdrawal of technical support (72% of the decisions in our cohort), that should
trigger physicians to explore a family’
s values.25 Responding with unburied empathy may be an
effective strategy to ensure families feel heard and present an opportunity for the physician to learn
values most important to the family.
When the empathetic statement is buried, our data suggest families may not hear the
physician’
s attempt to connect with them empathetically. How physicians bury empathy is
predictable. It was most commonly buried within complex medical talk or attached to medical
statements with a “but.” But is a conjunction aimed at connecting ideas, and it often serves to
contradict the next clause. We suspect physicians use medical talk or “but” to quickly attempt to
address the emotion, then return to what is most comfortable. For families, using “but” may make
that clear and lead them to move away from the emotion and stay in medical talk.
Missing or ignoring the opportunity to address family emotion can also affect the family-
physician partnership because family members may feel unheard or even dismissed. We recognize
walking into the emotion is difficult, and it may seem counterintuitive to invite deeper emotions,
such as mourning or overt sadness; however, we also know emotional evolution may be necessary
for rational decision making.26-29 Shared decision making may therefore necessitate emotional
processing.
Families need to feel cared for by their physician.9 They want their physicians to show
empathy,30 and studies suggest that perceptions of physician empathy translate to perceptions of
physician competence.31 Incorporating empathy into communication has been linked to patient
satisfaction, better health outcomes, and reduced physician burnout.21,32-35
In our care conferences, there was always another member of the health care team present.
Although they contributed to less than 5% of the dialogue, when they addressed a family’
s emotions,
these other health care team members were more likely to use unburied empathetic statements
offering support to families. These results suggest that maximizing the expertise in the full health
care team may offer an additional layer of support in responding to families, and future care
conferences should consider increasing the verbal contributions of other health care team members.
Our results offer practical guidance for physicians to consider when communicating with
families. Using NURSE statements and then stopping to allow time for a response helps to connect
with families and share their experience. Limiting medical talk, using open-ended questions to
explore emotions, and reducing physician-to-physician interruptions can provide opportunities to
learn new information about patients and their families. Most importantly, listening to patients and
their families allows physicians to avoid missing opportunities to deepen the discussion.
Limitations
The strength of this article lies in a relatively large sample of audio-recorded care conferences with a
diverse group of physicians and clinical decisions being discussed with families of critically ill children.
Despite the strengths, there are limitations. As a single-center study, the use of empathetic

 statements may be unique to this group of physicians. We attempted to mitigate this effect by
limiting the number of audio recordings per physician and including physicians from many pediatric
disciplines. Excluding non-English–speaking families limits our ability to generalize results to all
families in the PICU. We excluded conversations about medical updates or discharge planning to
focus on high-stakes emotional discussions. Physicians’patterns of empathetic statements may be
different in these other types of discussions. We also recognize that we did not conduct a
multivariate analysis of this relationship, and there may be other important confounders, such as
family member sex and relationship to patient, which are not addressed. We captured only formal,
scheduled family-physician conversations and recognize we cannot comment on other opportunities
to communicate with families, such as during bedside meetings and family-centered rounds.
Conclusions
While physicians frequently responded with empathy, their responses were often buried within
medical talk. When physicians use transparent, unburied empathetic statements to respond to family
emotion, it leads to a deeper conversation and can reveal a family’
s fears, values, and motivations.
