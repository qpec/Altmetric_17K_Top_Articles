ABSTRACT
Purpose: To describe the experience of five Israeli pediatric epilepsy clinics 
treating children and adolescents diagnosed as having intractable epilepsy with 
a regimen of medical cannabis oil.
Methods: A retrospective study describing the effect of cannabidiol (CBD)-
enriched medical cannabis on children with epilepsy. The cohort included 74 
patients (age range 1-18 years) with intractable epilepsy resistant to >7 
antiepileptic drugs. Forty-nine (66%) also failed a ketogenic diet, vagal nerve 
stimulator implantation, or both. They all started medical cannabis oil 
treatment between 2-11/2014 and were treated for at least 3 months (average 6 
months). The selected formula contained CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol at a 
ratio of 20:1 dissolved in olive oil. The CBD dose ranged from 1-20 mg/kg/d. 
Seizure frequency was assessed by parental report during clinical visits.
Results: CBD treatment yielded a significant positive effect on seizure load. 
Most of the children (66/74, 89%) reported reduction in seizure frequency: 13 
(18%) reported 75-100% reduction, 25 (34%) reported 50-75% reduction, 9 
(12%) reported 25-50% reduction, and 19 (26%) reported <25% reduction. 
Five (7%) patients reported aggravation of seizures which led to CBD 
withdrawal. In addition, we observed improvement in behavior and alertness, 
language, communication, motor skills and sleep. Adverse reactions included 
somnolence, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances and irritability leading to 
withdrawal of cannabis use in 5 patients. 
Conclusions: The results of this multicenter study on CBD treatment for 
intractable epilepsy in a population of children and adolescents are highly

promising. Further prospective, well-designed clinical trials using enriched 
CBD medical cannabis are warranted.

1. Introduction
About one-third of patients with epilepsy suffer from drug-resistant disease 
defined as failure to stop all seizures after an adequate trial of at least two 
appropriate medications. The efficacy of current medications in these cases is 
limited.1-3 There is great interest in the development of new medications which 
may have antiepileptic properties, particularly those agents that affect novel 
receptors. 
The two main cannabis ingredients with central nervous system (CNS) 
activity are psychoactive Δ9-tetrahydro-cannibinol (THC) and the non-
psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD). THC directly activates the brain 
endocannabinoid system, which has a role in synaptic communication.4 CBD 
is a cannabinoid receptor antagonist that modulates the endogenous 
cannabinoid system by potentiating intrinsic anandamide-mediated 
neurotransmission. In addition, CBD is involved in the regulation of other 
cerebral neurotransmitters and receptors, as well as having an anti-
inflammatory and antioxidant properties.5,6 The mechanism of action of CBD 
is not well understood, but it has become clear that its anticonvulsant 
properties do not involve a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-dependent 
mechanism.7 Because of its multiple targets and high toxicity threshold, it is 
currently being investigated as a potentially useful therapeutic drug in several 
CNS and extra-CNS disorders, including epilepsy, in both experimental 
models and in humans.8,9 The effects of cannabis on epilepsy were described 
by detailed case reports in the medical literature from as early as the 19th
century.10,11 Those articles were followed by several epidemiological studies 
that claimed a protective effect of marihuana smoking against seizures.12-14
 Page 6 of 22

CBD was also found to have positive effects on seizure threshold, severity and 
lethality in several epilepsy mouse and rat models.15-18 Several small 
controlled studies on the effect of purified CBD (200-300 mg/d) on epilepsy in 
adults were conducted in the 70’s.19-22 While the first two claimed a significant 
effect of CBD on seizure frequency, the last two did not show any benefit for 
CBD use over placebo. These reported studies were analyzed in a Cochrane 
review23 that concluded that because of the quality of the studies, the only 
answered question was the secondary outcome measure related to adverse 
effects and concluded that 200-300 mg/d cannabidiol had been safely 
administered to small numbers of patients for short time periods.
The last three years have witnessed growing interest among the 
medical community, parent groups and media in the use of enriched CBD 
medical cannabis and pure CBD in intractable pediatric epilepsy. Based on 
anecdotal reports and parental pressure, marijuana is currently licensed for 
seizures or epilepsy in 14 states in the US.24
Medical cannabis in various ratios of CBD and THC and in different 
preparations (modes of administration) is licensed by the Israeli Ministry of 
Health (MOH) for a number of indications, including oncology-related pain 
and side effects of chemotherapy, phantom pain, and pain related to multiple 
sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury, post-traumatic stress 
disorder. severe intractable Gille de la Tourette syndrome, intractable epilepsy 
in pediatric and adult patients, intractable Crohn's disease and selected cases 
of severe fibromyalgia. Contraindications for its administration include a 
history of drug abuse, significant psychiatric background and congestive heart 
failure. Only experts in each specific field are allowed to apply for a license to 
 Page 7 of 22
Accepted Manuscript
access a special unit in the MOH by means of computer-based application 
forms. Each application is reviewed, and approval is given for a period of 6 
months to 1 year if considered appropriate by a group of 30 key leaders in 
these fields of expertise nominated by the MOH and signed by one designated 
MOH expert physician. There are currently 23,500 active licenses in the MOH 
registry (200 for children with epilepsy). The cannabis preparations (oil, 
cigarettes, inhalation extract or flowers) are produced by 8 MOH-certified 
growers and distributed by them to the licensed patients through specific 
distribution points and accompanied by personal guidance for their proper use. 
Treatment follow-up is performed by the applying physician.
Our objective in this paper is to present the experience of four pediatric 
epilepsy units in Israel that treat children and adolescents diagnosed as having 
intractable epilepsy with enriched CBD medical cannabis.
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Subjects 
We conducted a retrospective study based on clinical records of clinic and 
phone call visits of children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy who 
were being treated in four pediatric epilepsy centres in Israel. The participating 
clinics are all tertiary referral centers for pediatric epilepsy in Israel, and each 
treats thousands of patients with epilepsy, including many with intractable 
disease. All the patients that received CBD-enriched cannabis oil (CECO) 
were followed by each of the clinics for at least 12 months before receiving 
CECO. It was offered to them by the physician after they had been resistant to 
 Page 8 of 22
Accepted Manuscript
5-7 drugs, or treatment by a ketogenic diet or vagal nerve stimulation (VNS). 
The possibility of CECO was also raised by the child’s parents who learned 
about that treatment option via information made available by the media. One 
pediatric neurologist followed the patients in each clinic. 
The cohort included children who were treated with cannabis oil for 
more than 3 months throughout 2014. Patients aged 1-18 years with refractory 
epilepsy that was characterized by daily seizures refractory to >7 appropriate 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and other treatment modes, i.e., VNS 35/74 (47%), 
epilepsy surgery 3 (4%), and ketogenic diet 29/74 (39%) were included. 
Patients with severe behavioral disorders and significant family 
psychopathology were excluded.
The study patients were divided into six groups based on seizure 
etiology: 
1. Acquired
2. Early epileptic encephalopathy with a known genetic etiology 
3. Epileptic encephalopathy without a known genetic etiology
4. Congenital brain malformations
5. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
6. Other (etiology not defined)
2.2. Study medication 
CBD-enriched cannabis oil was supplied by two licensed growers (Better and 
Tikun Olam, Tel-Aviv, Israel), and the preparation of the oil was made by two 
methods. In the first method, the cannabis plant material was extracted in 
PhEur absolute ethanol, followed by evaporation and decarboxylation. The 
 Page 9 of 22
Accepted Manuscript
concentrate was diluted in PhEur canola oil to the required concentration of 
20% CBD and 1% THC. Preservatives and antioxidants were added to ensure 
stability of the active ingredients. The ingredient concentration and quality 
analysis was done four times by high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) during the different stages of the preparation process. In the second 
method, the cannabis oils were extracted from two CBD-rich cannabis strains 
using ethanol as an extracting solvent. The preparation at the crude extract 
level, the purified CBD and the final solution level were analyzed by both 
HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ratio between THC 
and CBD was standardized and corrected to 20:1 by the addition of pure CBD. 
At the final stage, the preparations were assayed to ensure the absence of fungi 
and molds (based on the Israeli Standard 885 for preparation sterility). The 
CBD and THC analyses were performed in two independent labs which 
supply services for the growers. One is a university lab and the other is a 
GMP-approved lab.
The CBD dosage ranged from 1-20 mg/kg/d, and it was divided into 
two groups, 1-10 mg/kg/d and 10-20 mg /kg/d. The final dose used for each 
patient was defined according to seizure response and side effects. The THC 
dosage did not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/d, which is considered far below the safety 
margin of THC. In some cases, the patient’s other medications were reduced if 
there was decrease in seizure frequency and adjusted according to side effects, 
in addition to drug level adjustments while on CECO. Seizure reduction was 
rated according to four levels (0%, <25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%) as 
reported by parents and older patients. Parents were asked to report the 
 Page 10 of 22

number of seizures per period and we did the percentage calculations. Side 
effects were also reviewed.
The study was approved by the IRB committee of the four participating 
centers.
3. Results
A total of 74 patients met the study inclusion criteria. One-half of them (37/74, 
50%) were younger than 10 years of age. Sixty-five (88%) of the patients were 
cognitively impaired as follows: mild 16/74 (22%), moderate 14/74 (19%), 
and severe 34/74 (46%), with only 10 of them (13%) having normal cognition. 
The CECO treatment duration was between 3-12 months. The median duration 
of exposure was 5.5 months and the duration of follow-up was 10 months. The 
CBD dosage ranged from 1-20 mg/kg/d: 60 (81%) patients were treated with 
<10 mg/kg /d of CBD and 14 (19%) treated with >10 mg/kg/d of CBD, with 
the highest CBD dose reaching 270 mg/day. 
Most of the patients (66/74, 89%) reported some reduction in seizure 
frequency: 13 (18%) had 75-100% reduction, 25 (34%) had 50-75% reduction, 
9(12%) had 25-50% reduction, and 19 (26%) had <25% reduction. Five (7%) 
patients reported aggravation of seizures which led to withdrawal of the 
cannabis oil.
One patient, a 7-month-old with severe acquired hypoxic ischemic 
damage, intractable spasms and partial complex seizures, became seizure-free 
on CECO at a dosage of 2 mg/kg/d. The improvement demonstrated on his 
electroencephalogram (EEG) enabled a gradual decrease in the dosages of his 
other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

The results of cannabis oil treatment according to seizure etiology are 
displayed in Table 1. In the first two groups (epileptic encephalopathies with 
or without known genetic mutations), 66% (30/45) of the children showed 
more than a 25% reduction in seizure frequency, with 23/45 (51%) reporting 
between 50-100% reduction in seizure frequency. Table 2 lists the results of 
cannabis oil treatment according to dosage. Positive effects not related to 
seizure frequency were reported by 44/74 patients, and they included 
improved behavior and alertness in 25/44, improved language, communication 
and motor skills in 11/44, and improved sleep in 8/44. 
Adverse events were reported by 34/74 patients (Table 3). The side 
effects led to the withdrawal of medical cannabis in five patients.
4. Discussion 
The use of enriched CBD oil in the treatment for intractable pediatric 
epilepsy patients is becoming increasingly popular. Three publications on 
retrospective studies appeared between 2013-2015 describing parental surveys 
or the experience of epilepsy clinics with enriched CBD oil among various 
pediatric epilepsy populations.25-27 Although they showed a favorable effect of 
CBD-enriched cannabis in the pediatric epilepsy population, those reports 
lacked objectivity as well as crucial data on the study population and on the 
compounds used according to varying considerations. The first was a 
retrospective study that described a telephone/Internet survey of 19 parents 
whose children had various childhood epileptic encephalopathies for which 
they received CBD-enriched medical marijuana: 16 (84%) had a reduction in 
 Page 12 of 22
Accepted Manuscript
seizure frequency and two became seizure-free.25 The second report was a 
retrospective chart review from a single tertiary epilepsy center, and it 
included 75 children and adolescents with various epileptic encephalopathies 
who were given medical cannabis.26 Thirty-three percent reported a >50% 
reduction in seizures, while 57% reported some improvement in seizure 
control. The response rate was syndrome-dependant: Dravet syndrome had a 
rate of 23%, Doose syndrome 0%, and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome 88.9%. No 
benefit was demonstrated in the available EEGs. The third report was an 
online parental survey that focused on perceived efficacy, dosage, and 
tolerability of CBD-enriched cannabis preparations for children with infantile 
spasms and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and other intractable epilepsies. A total 
of 117 parents responded to the survey. The perceived efficacy and tolerability 
were similar across etiologic subgroups, with 85% reporting some reduction in 
seizure frequency and 14% reporting complete seizure freedom. The median 
duration and the median dosage of CBD exposure were 6.8 months and 4.3 
mg/kg/day, respectively. 27 The few side effects reported in these three studies 
included increased appetite, somnolence/fatigue, and an increase in seizure 
frequency25-27. Rare adverse events were developmental regression, abnormal 
movements, status epilepticus requiring intubation, and death. The beneficial 
effects other than seizure control that were reported in all three studies by 
parents included sleep quality improvement, increased alertness, and better 
mood during CBD therapy. Improvements in language and motor skills were 
reported in 10% of patients in a study by Hussain et al.27
Our current investigation is a large retrospective study. It differs from 
the previously reported studies25-27in a number of aspects. The patients and 
 Page 13 of 22

their epilepsy course were well known to the treating physicians in all four 
participating centers. Only two CBD-enriched cannabis solutions with known 
and well-controlled compositions were used, and the titration of dosage was 
done regularly by the treating physician according to seizure response and side 
effects during clinic visits. The follow-up was done mainly in person with 
additional in-between phone calls and not by printed questionnaires, which 
may strengthen the reliability of the data. Because of the novelty of using 
medical cannabis in pediatric epilepsy, the physicians were very selective in 
their inclusion criteria and chose only patients with severe refractory epilepsy 
(i.e., all had failed at least 7 AEDs and most had also failed the ketogenic diet, 
VNS or epileptic surgery or both). 
We divided the patients into six groups according to etiology. The 
largest was the group that had epileptic encephalopathy with or without a 
known genetic etiology (59%). While 66% of the epileptic encephalopathy 
group (30/45) showed more than a 25% reduction in seizure frequency, only 
45% (14/31) of the other children showed a similar response rate. Importantly, 
there was no difference in the baseline severity of epilepsy between the groups 
by the physicians' clinical assessment.
Because of no previous experience and no available data on the effect 
and safety of CBD and the limitations related to THC dosage, three out of the 
four participating centres chose to titrate the cannabis oil slowly and kept the 
patients on a relatively low CBD dose (<10 mg/kg/d), with only 13 patients 
(17%) reaching a CECO dosage higher than 10 mg/kg/d. The small size of the 
high dose group precludes our reaching any conclusions regarding dosage-
related efficacy.
 Page 14 of 22

Side effects of substance use were inevitable, but their rate and severity 
were not different from most known AEDs. There were no allergic responses. 
Somnolence and fatigue were relatively common but they were mostly
temporary. It is also important to mention that CECO was added to at least 2 
other AEDs in all patients, and that drug-drug interactions may have been the 
underlying cause for the fatigue and somnolence. There were no major 
systemic side effects, and the reported gastrointestinal problems were of minor 
significance. The seizure aggravation reported in 7% of the patients can be 
partly related to the disease’s natural history. Most of our study patients were 
cognitively impaired, thus preventing the option to assess the effect of CECO 
on cognition.
Our study has several imitations, including the lack of a control group, 
no consistent rate of dosage elevation, reliance upon parental report on seizure 
frequency, short duration of the study and lack of long-term outcome, no EEG 
results and no measurement of other drug levels. Since it is a retrospective 
study, there was no planned baseline period before commencing CECO. 
However, because all the patients were well-known and continuously 
followed-up in the participating clinics, the natural history of their epilepsy 
was well known and served as baseline.
5. Conclusions
The results of this multicenter study on CBD enriched cannabis oil treatment 
for intractable epilepsy in a population of children and adolescents are highly 
 Page 15 of 22

promising. Further prospective, well-designed clinical trials using enriched 
CBD medical cannabis are warranted to validate our findings.
