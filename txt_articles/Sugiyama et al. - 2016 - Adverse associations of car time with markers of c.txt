Objective. To examine associations of time spent sitting in cars with markers of cardio-metabolic risk in
Australian adults.
Method. Data were from 2800 participants (age range: 34–65) in the 2011–12 Australian Diabetes, Obesity
and Lifestyle Study. Self-reported time spent in cars was categorized into four groups: ≤15 min/day; N15 to
≤30 min/day; N30 to ≤60 min/day; and N60 min/day. Markers of cardio-metabolic risk were body mass index
(BMI), waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-
cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose, a clustered cardio-metabolic risk score, and having the
metabolic syndrome or not. Multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses examined associations of car
time with each cardio-metabolic risk outcome, adjusting for socio-demographic and behavioral variables and
medication use for blood pressure and cholesterol/triglycerides.
Results. Compared to spending 15 min/day or less in cars, spending more than 1 h/day in cars was significant-
ly associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, and clustered cardio-metabolic risk,
after adjusting for socio-demographic attributes and potentially relevant behaviors including leisure-time physi-
cal activity and dietary intake. Gender interactions showed car time to be associated with higher BMI in men only.
Conclusions. Prolonged time spent sitting in cars, in particular over 1 h/day, was associated with higher total
and central adiposity and a more-adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile. Further studies, ideally using objective
measures of sitting time in cars and prospective designs, are needed to confirm the impact of car use on cardio-
metabolic disease risk.

Background
High volumes of daily sitting time, which are now common in many
countries (Matthews et al., 2008; Ng and Popkin, 2012) are associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases
(Cooper et al., 2014; Healy et al., 2008; Owen et al., 2010; Thorp et al.,
2010; Wijndaele et al., 2014). Of the specific sedentary behaviors, TV
viewing time has been examined extensively and shown to be associated
with cardiovascular mortality (Dunstan et al., 2010; Matthews et al.,
2012) and markers of cardio-metabolic risk (Inoue et al., 2012; Thorp
et al., 2010; Wijndaele et al., 2010). However, potential health effects of
other sedentary behaviors, such as sitting in cars, have been less studied.
Although sitting defines sedentary behaviors regardless of where
they take place, driving can involve slightly higher energy expenditure
(2.0 METs) than other sedentary behaviors such as TV viewing (sitting
quietly, 1.0 METs) and sitting at work (1.5 METs) (Ainsworth et al.,
2000). Recent studies have suggested that sitting in different domains
may not be similarly associated with mortality and disease outcomes
(Basterra-Gortari et al., 2014; Chau et al., 2012; Pinto Pereira et al.,
2012). Given that different strategies may be needed to reduce sedentary
behavior in different domains (leisure, transport, and occupation), it is
important for practitioners and policy makers in relevant sectors to

 understand how particular domain-specific sedentary behaviors are re-
lated to health risk.
The proportion of adults who use a car as the main form of transport
to work or for other commuting purposes is high: 86% in the USA and
78% in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012; McKenzie and
Rapino, 2011). Even in European countries, which can have more-
compact urban environments and more accessible public transport,
the majority of trips are made by cars. For example, cars are used for
64% of all instances of travel in the UK, and 53% in Sweden (Transport
Analysis, 2012; UK Department of Transport, 2013). Car use is not only
high in frequency, but can also be substantial in duration. Australian
household travel surveys show that adults spend on average more
than 50 min/day in a car (Ironmonger, 2008), with up to 18% of men
and 12% of women spending more than 2 h/day (Sugiyama et al., 2012).
Car commuters have been shown to have higher odds of being over-
weight or obese, compared to non-car commuters (Laverty et al., 2013;
Lindstrom, 2008). Frequent car use for commuting and errands has been
associated with higher BMI (Pendola and Gen, 2007). A recent review
has shown that longer car use (measured in time or in distance) was sig-
nificantly associated with higher weight status in eight out of 10 studies
(McCormack and Virk, 2014). Longitudinal studies have also found fre-
quent and longer car use to be associated with greater weight gain and
higher cardiovascular mortality (Sugiyama et al., 2013; Warren et al.,
2010). These studies, however, have used predominantly self-reported
adiposity measures. One study reported distance between home and
work to be associated with a metabolic syndrome risk score derived
from objectively-assessed biomarkers (Hoehner et al., 2012). However,
such a distance measure focusing on the workplace may not accurately
represent time spent sitting in cars.
As discussed above, car use is a common sedentary behavior among
adults. Since it has a broad detrimental impact on society including
human health, greenhouse gas emission, and congestion, producing
specific evidence of how time in car is associated with increased risk
of chronic diseases is relevant to help inform policies to promote active
travel. We examined associations of time spent sitting in cars
with objectively-measured markers of cardio-metabolic risk among
Australian adults.
Methods
Data source
Data were obtained from participants of the third wave of the Australian
Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab3) study, which was conducted in
2011–12. AusDiab is a cohort study that was originally established to examine
the national prevalence and incidence of diabetes and related risk factors.
Detailed methods of recruitment and data collection have been reported
elsewhere (Dunstan et al., 2002; Thorp et al., 2010). Briefly, the initial data
collection (AusDiab1) was conducted in 1999–2000, using a stratified cluster
sampling method. First, six Census Collection District (CCD, a geographic unit
defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics with an average of 225 dwellings
each) clusters were selected from each of the seven Australian states and
territory. Within each of the 42 study areas, adults aged 25 years and over
who had resided at the address for 6 months or longer prior to the survey and
those without physical or intellectual disabilities were asked to participate in
the survey. The sample for AusDiab 1 (n = 11,247) was a national sample of
the adult population aged 25 years and over. Survey questions on car use
were first introduced in AusDiab3 (n = 6,186). The response rate for this
wave among eligible AusDiab2 participants was 59.8%. Of these, 4,614 partici-
pants attended testing sites for biomedical examination (Tanamas et al.,
2013). The sample for the current study consisted of those who were 65 years
or younger (n = 3,112). Adults older than 65 years were excluded from this
analysis on the grounds that cardio-metabolic health of those who were retired
(no longer driving to work) may have been influenced by previous driving
habits. Of these, participants who did not report car time (n = 86), did not
have more than one outcome measure (n = 21), did not answer a general
questionnaire for socio-demographic variables (n = 63), were diagnosed with
diabetes (n = 138), had a history of cardiovascular disease (angina, heart attack,
stroke; n = 51), or were pregnant (n = 5) were excluded. The final sample size
was 2,800 (exclusion criteria not mutually exclusive). The study was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the International Diabetes Institute and the Alfred
Health Human Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
Outcome measures
Objective markers of cardio-metabolic risk included BMI; waist circumfer-
ence; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP); triglycerides; HDL-cholesterol;
fasting plasma glucose; 2-h post-load plasma glucose; clustered cardio-
metabolic risk; and having the metabolic syndrome or not. Trained personnel
at data collection sites measured participants' height, weight, waist circumfer-
ence, and resting BP. Fasting serum triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and fasting
and 2-h plasma glucose levels were measured by enzymatic methods using the
Roche Modular (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). A continuous clustered
cardio-metabolic risk score was computed using five cardio-metabolic measures:
waist circumference; BP (average of systolic and diastolic); triglycerides;
HDL-cholesterol; and fasting plasma glucose (Wijndaele et al., 2009). After
standardizing all five markers, the risk score was calculated by summing all
standardized scores and dividing this sum by five. Gender-specific means and
standard deviations from all participants with complete data for each cardio-
metabolic variable were used. A higher positive score denotes greater cardio-
metabolic risk. Triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose were normalized
(natural log) prior to standardization. The standardized score of HDL-
cholesterol was multiplied by minus one, to account for its protective cardio-
metabolic effect. The presence of the metabolic syndrome was determined
based on the 2009 Joint Interim Statement (Alberti et al., 2009).
Exposure measure
Participants were asked to report the total duration they used a car (as
driver or passenger) to get to places such as work, school, shops, or services in
the last week. The question was asked in the format used for those in the Interna-
tional Physical Activity Questionnaire (Craig et al., 2003). Participants were cate-
gorized into four groups according to daily time spent in cars: ≤15 min/day;
N15 to ≤30 min/day; N30 to ≤60 min/day; and N60 min/day.
Covariates
Socio-demographic variables were collected using an interviewer-
administered questionnaire. They included age; gender; education (high school
or less, technical/vocational, bachelor's degree or higher); work status (working
including students, not working, other); marital status (single, couple); having
children in the household (yes, no); and annual household income (less than
AU$60 K, AU$60–125 K, AU$125 K or more, no response). Behavioral covariates
included self-reported sitting time for work, TV viewing time, leisure-time com-
puter use, leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (LTPA), energy
intake, and alcohol consumption. Participants reported time spent sitting as
part of their work in the last week during weekdays (sitting for work), time
spent sitting to watch TV or video/DVD in the last week (TV viewing), and
time spent sitting to use a computer, the internet, and electronic games during
leisure time in the last week (computer use). For each of them, the average daily
sitting time was calculated. LTPA was determined using the Active Australia
Survey, a validated and reliable questionnaire, by summing the time spent in
moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity (multiplied by two)
in the last week (Armstrong et al., 2000). Daily energy intake and alcohol
consumption were determined using a self-administered food-frequency ques-
tionnaire, with a reference frame of the last 12 months (Hodge et al., 2000).
Daily intakes of each food were calculated using sex-specific standard portion
sizes derived from weighed food records and the reported frequencies convert-
ed to daily equivalents. From these data, intakes of nutrients, including energy,
were calculated using NUTTAB95 food composition data (Lewis et al., 1995). In
addition, self-reported medication use for BP and for cholesterol or triglycerides
were also included as covariates.
Statistical analyses
Outcome variables that had a skewed distribution (triglycerides, fasting plas-
ma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose) were log-transformed to reduce skewness.
Multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses examined associations of time
spent in cars with each outcome, using CCD clusters as a random intercept.

 Analyses adjusted for socio-demographic and behavioral variables described
above. They also adjusted for medication use for BP (only in models examining
systolic BP, diastolic BP, and cardio-metabolic risk) and medication for cholester-
ol/triglycerides (only in models examining triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and
cardio-metabolic risk). Results were shown in unstandardized regression
coefficients for continuous outcome measures and odd ratios for the metabolic
syndrome, according to each car time category with p values for linear trend. In
light of previous studies showing differential associations of sedentary behavior
with health outcomes between men and women (Thorp et al., 2010; Yates et al.,
2012), gender interaction was also examined for each outcome. We also examined
the interaction of work status with time in cars, as workers and non-workers are
likely to differ in their behavior pattern. When the interaction term approached
significance (p ≈ 0.1), stratified analyses were conducted. To examine whether
other behavioral variables (sitting, LTPA) attenuate the association of time in
cars and the outcomes, we also conducted separate analyses where each behavior
is adjusted for separately. Analyses were conducted using STATA version 12
(StataCorp, College Station, TX). Statistical significance was set at p b 0.05.
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study sample (n = 2800).
Participants' average age was 54 years (range: 34–65 years), and more
than two thirds were working. The mean daily duration in cars was
49 min, which is similar to the average daily duration of car use derived
from household travel surveys in Australia (Ironmonger, 2008). Time
spent in cars was weakly correlated with other behavioral variables:
correlation coefficients were 0.06 (p = 0.005) with sitting for work,
−0.04 (p = 0.04) with TV viewing, −0.04 (p = 0.02) with leisure-
time computer use, and 0.02 (p = 0.3) with LTPA.
Table 2 shows the results of the regression analyses for each
outcome measure. Compared to participants using a car for 15 min/day
or less, those who spent more than 1 h/day in cars were more likely to
have significantly higher BMI, waist circumference, fasting plasma glu-
cose, and clustered cardio-metabolic risk. Using a car between 30 and
60 min/day was also associated with higher clustered cardio-metabolic
risk. Car time was not significantly associated with BP, triglycerides,
HDL-cholesterol, 2-h plasma glucose, and the metabolic syndrome. In
addition to the full model, we further examined to what extent the
associations between car time and the outcomes were attenuated by
other behaviors. It was found that sitting for work and LTPA slightly at-
tenuated the associations, but TV viewing and leisure-time computer
use strengthened the association (Supplementary Tables 1–5). However,
the overall results (car time being associated with BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, fasting plasma glucose, and clustered cardio-metabolic risk)
remained similar after adjusting for each behavioral covariate.
Interaction analyses found that the interaction between gender and
time spent in cars on BMI approached significance (p = 0.11). Table 3
shows the results of the regression analyses for BMI, stratified by
gender. A significant association between time in cars and BMI was
observed for men but not for women. Interaction of work status with
time in cars was not significant for any of the outcome variables.
Discussion
In our sample of Australian adults, we observed that those who spent
longer time in cars showed higher levels of general and central adiposity
and a poorer overall cardio-metabolic risk profile, after adjusting for sev-
eral potential confounders. Relative to participants who spent 15 min/day
or less in cars, those who spent more than 1 h/day (about a quarter of
the sample) were likely to have a 0.8 greater BMI (equivalent to 2.3 kg
for a person with a height of 1.7 m), and 1.5 cm greater waist circumfer-
ence. Previous studies have shown the associations of car use with
self-reported adiposity measures (Ding et al., 2014; Frank et al., 2004;
Laverty et al., 2013; Lindstrom, 2008; Sugiyama et al., 2013). Another
study showed that living far from work was detrimentally associated
with objectively-assessed BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, and
continuous metabolic syndrome score (Hoehner et al., 2012). Our
study adds further evidence supporting the unfavorable associations
of prolonged car use with objectively-measured markers of cardio-
metabolic risk, particularly among those who used a car more than 1
h/day.
Our findings on car time are broadly comparable with previous stud-
ies using objectively-measured total sedentary time. They showed
mostly consistent significant associations with adiposity and with
cardio-metabolic risk, and consistent non-significant associations
with blood pressure (Cooper et al., 2014; Healy et al., 2008; Wijndaele
et al., 2014). However, the current study differed from these previous
studies in associations with triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose.
Compared to leisure-time sitting, driving a car can involves some
modest bodily movement (Ainsworth et al., 2000), and occurs in a
setting that can be stressful (Ding et al., 2014; Rissel et al., 2014). Such
differences may provide an explanation for the variations between
this study and those using objectively-measured overall sedentary
time. It should be noted that car use as a passenger was also included
in this study. However, in Australia, a large majority of car use is done
by unaccompanied drivers (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012).
We found that time spent sitting in cars was only weakly correlated
with other sedentary behaviors and leisure-time physical activity.
Additional analyses in which these behavioral covariates were adjusted
for individually also showed that the associations of time in cars with
the outcomes were not markedly influenced by other behaviors
(Supplementary Tables). The results suggest that car use is mostly
unrelated to other behaviors measured in the study (e.g., sitting for

 work, TV viewing), and independently associated with markers of
cardio-metabolic risk. Further research examining the relative contribu-
tions of domain-specific sitting (at home, in car, at work) to health
outcomes is warranted to develop more effective sitting interventions
to enhance population health.
Interaction analyses showed that time in cars was associated with
BMI for men but not for women. It was found that men who spent
more than 30 min/day in cars had a significantly higher BMI, compared
to those who spent 15 min/day or less in cars. Previously, studies report-
ed stronger associations between sedentary time and adiposity
measures for women (Thorp et al., 2010; Yates et al., 2012). Studies
have shown prolonged bouts of sitting to be associated with cardio-
metabolic risk (Carson et al., 2014; Healy et al., 2011). There may be
gender differences in the duration of bouts in car use, which may par-
tially account for the differential association. Further studies identifying
the bout of driving would be of interest to understand whether it is
related to other measures of cardio-metabolic health.
Strengths of the study include the use of objectively-measured
markers of cardio-metabolic risk, a large sample obtained from diverse
locations (urban, suburban, and regional) throughout Australia, and
adjustment by behavioral (including dietary intake) variables and
medication use. However, there are limitations to be recognized. First,
the cross-sectional nature of our study hinders any inference on causal-
ity. It is possible that participants with high adiposity may have spent a
longer time in cars as they find the use of public transport inconvenient.
It is also possible that they have chosen to live in a car-oriented neigh-
borhood. Longitudinal studies, considering the reason for moving to
the neighborhood, are needed to confirm our findings. Second, this
study used a self-report measure for time spent in cars, which may in-
volve recall error. To date, however, no studies have directly measured
time spent sitting in cars. In the literature, duration was estimated
from the distance between the origin and destination reported in travel
surveys (Frank et al., 2004), or the distance between home and work
was used as an exposure measure (Hoehner et al., 2012). Given that
car use is a common sedentary behavior among adults, objective
methods to accurately identify how long people sit in a car need to be
developed and employed in future research. Global positioning systems,
which are now widely available in mobile phones and have begun to be
used for health research (Kerr et al., 2011), may be employed for this
purpose. Third, our findings may be influenced by residual confounding
of unmeasured factors, such as sitting in other types of transportation
(e.g., train, bus), stress, and exposure to particulate matter during car
use (Chertok et al., 2004).
In conclusion, this study adds further evidence on the likely adverse
cardio-metabolic health consequences of prolonged time in cars, in
particular for a quarter of the sample who spent over 1 h per day in
cars. Transport sectors have been trying to promote active travel mainly
to reduce congestion, air pollution, and the proliferation of automobile-
related infrastructure. Such efforts can be further supported by produc-
ing a compelling body of evidence on the adverse health impact of
prolonged time spent in cars. Research on the deleterious health im-
pacts of car use can contribute to more comprehensive evidence base
to underpin advocacy of active transport options. Collaborative research
between the health (including health economics), transport, and plan-
ning sectors has considerable potential to promote active travel further
and to broaden the base for cardio-metabolic disease prevention
initiatives.
