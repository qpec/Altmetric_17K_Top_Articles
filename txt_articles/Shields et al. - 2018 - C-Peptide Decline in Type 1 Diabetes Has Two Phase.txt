 C-Peptide Decline in Type 1
Diabetes Has Two Phases: An
Initial Exponential Fall and a
Subsequent Stable Phase
Diabetes Care 2018;41:1486–1492 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc18-0465
OBJECTIVE
The decline in C-peptide in the 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes has been
well studied, but little is known about the longer-term trajectory. We aimed to
examine the association between log-transformed C-peptide levels and the dura-
tion of diabetes up to 40 years after diagnosis.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We assessed the pattern of association between urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio
(UCPCR) and duration of diabetes in cross-sectional data from 1,549 individuals with
type 1 diabetes using nonlinear regression approaches. Findings were replicated in
longitudinal follow-up data for both UCPCR (n = 161 individuals, 326 observations)
and plasma C-peptide (n = 93 individuals, 473 observations).
RESULTS
We identified two clear phases of C-peptide decline: an initial exponential fall over
7 years (47% decrease/year [95% CI 251, 243]) followed by a stable period
thereafter (10.07%/year [21.3, 11.5]). The two phases had similar durations and
slopes in patients above and below the median age at diagnosis (10.8 years), although
levels were lower in the younger patients irrespective of duration. Patterns were
consistentinbothlongitudinalUCPCR(n=162;£7yearsduration:248%/year[255,
238]; >7 years duration 20.1% [24.1, 13.9]) and plasma C-peptide (n = 93; >7 years
duration only: 22.6% [26.7, 11.5]).
CONCLUSIONS
These data support two clear phases of C-peptide decline: an initial exponential
fall over a 7-year period, followed by a prolonged stabilization where C-peptide
levels no longer decline. Understanding the pathophysiological and immunological
differences between these two phases will give crucial insights into understanding
b-cell survival.
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by autoimmune destruction of
the b-cells in the pancreas. Traditionally, the autoimmunity has been considered as
an ongoing destructive process, ultimately leading to absolute insulin deficiency.
However, recent studies have challenged this view by revealing that 29–80% of
individuals having type 1 diabetes with over 5 years duration still produce some
C-peptide(1–5).Importantly,thisisresponsivetomealstimulation(1),suggestingthat
at least some of the residual b-cells are functional. These findings are consistent with

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 histological studies of the pancreas in
which residual insulin-containing islets
have been found in patients with long-
standing type 1 diabetes (6–8). The pres-
ence of both C-peptide and b-cells in
patients with long-standing type 1 dia-
betes suggests an attenuation in the
rate of b-cell loss over time.
Studying the longer-term trajectory
of b-cell decline will be a key step to un-
derstanding the preservation of C-peptide
secretion in type 1 diabetes. Many studies
have examined early C-peptide loss, and
these have revealed a rapid and continu-
ing decline in the first 5 years after diag-
nosis(9–14).However,verylittleattention
has been paid to the progression of
C-peptide loss in longer durations of type 1
diabetes. For example, it is not known
whether the rate of C-peptide loss slows
or stabilizes, and if so, whether this is
dependent on the duration of diabetes
or the age of the patient.
Therefore, we aimed to examine the
trajectory of C-peptide levels measured
in a large cohort of patients up to 40 years
after type 1 diabetes was diagnosed.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We used both cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal data sets to explore the trajectory
of C-peptide levels over time in patients
with type 1 diabetes. Characteristics of
the patients in these cohorts are in
Supplementary Table 1.
Cross-sectional Cohort
Initial analysis examined the associa-
tion between C-peptide and duration of
diabetes in a cross-sectional cohort of
1,549 individuals with type 1 diabetes.
Patients were recruited from two dis-
crete geographic regions in the U.K. as
part of the Using pharmacogeNetics to
Improve Treatment in Early-onset Dia-
betes (UNITED) study that aimed to re-
cruitallpatientswhohadbeendiagnosed
withdiabetesat#30yearsofageinthese
regions (15,16). For our study, we only
examined patients with a clinical diag-
nosisoftype1diabeteswhoweretreated
withinsulinfromthetimeofdiagnosis,and
to rule out type 2 diabetes, patients were
excludedif they hadaBMI .30kg/m2(or
were in .80th percentile if ,22 years of
age at the time of recruitment) unless
theywerepositiveforGADorIA2autoanti-
bodies (2). As part of the UNITED study, all
patientswithaurinaryC-peptide/creatinine
ratio (UCPCR) .0.2 nmol/mmol and
negative islet antibody results were tested
for 35 known monogenic diabetes subtypes
(15,16). Any patients with an identified
monogenic cause for their diabetes were
excluded from this analysis. All patients
had a duration of diabetes of #40 years.
Subjects had their endogenous insulin
secretion tested by a postmeal UCPCR.
This test has been validated against a
formal assessment of C-peptide in a
mixed-meal tolerance test and shows
a very high correlation with the stimu-
lated C-peptide (r = 0.91) (17). UCPCR
results below the limit of detection
were coded at 0.00072 nmol/mmol
(which is the limit of detection for the
urinary C-peptide assay [0.03 nmol/L]
divided by the maximum urine creatinine
level seen in the study [41.6 mmol/L]).
Longitudinal Cohorts
We analyzed changes in C-peptide levels
over time using repeat samples from
individuals to verify our findings in the
cross-sectional data. The patients were
recruited from two different population
cohorts, both from a single geographic
region (Exeter, U.K.), and met the same
inclusion and exclusion criteria for type 1
diabetes as the cross-sectional cohort.
UCPCR
A subset of patients who had UCPCR
measured as part of the UNITED study
(described above) or a UCPCR validation
study (17) had repeat postmeal UCPCR
samples taken a median of 4.3 years later
(interquartile range [IQR] 3.6, 5.1) (n =
221 patients in total, two repeat mea-
surements except for three individuals
with three measurements).
Plasma C-Peptide
Repeat random nonfasting plasma
C-peptide measurements were available
on 105 patients with type 1 diabetes
recruited to the Diabetes Alliance for
Research in England (DARE) study. These
patients consented for C-peptide to be
measured at the same time as routine
HbA1c testing using EDTA plasma. This
enabled regular monitoring without spe-
cific research visits. C-peptide is stable
for 24 h at room temperature on EDTA
plasma (18), and a random nonfasting
C-peptide level has been shown to be
highly correlated to a 90-min C-peptide
level in a mixed-meal tolerance test (r =
0.91) (19). All patients with at least three
repeat measurements were included in
the analysis. Five hundred twenty-nine
C-peptide results were available from
the 105 patients, with a median of six
results available per patient, over a me-
dian time of 2.1 years (IQR 1.3, 2.2).
The studies were approved by the
National Research Ethics Service Commit-
tee South West (Exeter and Bristol). All
patients gave signed informed consent.
Laboratory Analysis
Urinary C-peptide and plasma C-peptide
levels were measured by electrochemi-
luminescence immunoassay (intra-assay
coefficient of variation 3.3%; interassay
coefficient of variation 4.5%) on a Roche
Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) E170
Analyzer by the Blood Sciences De-
partment at the Royal Devon and Exeter
NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, U.K. The
assay is a two-site immunoassay using
monoclonal antibodies against human
C-peptide, calibrated to World Health
Organization (WHO) International Refer-
ence Reagent for C-peptide of humans.
Urinary creatinine was analyzed on the
Roche P800 platform using creatinine
Jaff´
e reagent (standardized against iso-
tope dilution mass spectrometry) to calcu-
late the UCPCR (in nmol/mmol).
GAD and IA2 antibodies were measured
as part of the UNITED study in those who
had UCPCRs .0.2 nmol/mmol (15), and as
part of the longitudinal plasma C-peptide
studies. GAD and IA2 antibody analyses
were performed using commercial ELISA
assays (RSR Ltd., Cardiff, U.K.) and a Dynex
DSX automated ELISA system (Launch Di-
agnostics, Longfield, U.K.). The laboratory
participates in the Diabetes Autoantibody
Standardization Program. Patients were con-
sidered positive for antibodies if their results
were .97.5th percentile (11 WHO units/mL
for GAD, 15 WHO units/mL for IA2).
Statistical Analysis
All C-peptide results, in both plasma
and urine, were natural log transformed
for analysis, in line with previous studies
(2,10,20), as the distribution of their
values was heavily skewed.
Initial analysis of cross-sectional data
used nonlinear regression modeling to
examine the association between dura-
tion and log UCPCR. Generalized additive
models were used to explore the initial
shape of the association. This revealed a
pattern consistent with two phases that
could be modeled with two lines of best
fit. Segmented regression was used to de-
termine the optimal breakpoints where

 the lines of best fit would meet and to
enable calculation of the intercept and
slope of the two different phases, thereby
modeling the starting point and rate of
C-peptide decline.
To determine whether the association
was similar in both patients who had
received a diagnosis in childhood and in
those who received a diagnosis in their
teenage years/young adulthood, the
data set was split by the median age at
diagnosis and the analysis repeated in
each group.
For the longitudinal analysis, data were
split into two groups for the two phases:
before and after the optimal breakpoints
identified from cross-sectional analysis.
The intercept and slopes of the two dif-
ferent phases were determined using
mixed-effectsmodelstomodelC-peptide
against duration, with random effects at
the patient level to allow each patient to
contribute multiple C-peptide values at
different time points. We used a random-
intercept, random-slope model to allow
for variability between individuals in terms
of both C-peptide level at diagnosis (the
intercept) and in the percentage change
in C-peptide over time (the slope).
We repeated the analysis excluding
those patients whose first value was
below the lower limit of detection of
the assay to ensure that the finding did
not represent a floor effect (i.e., that the
results were not an artifact of those
below the lower limit of the assay not
being able to fall). Model assumptions
were tested by examining the normality
of residuals and by plotting associations
between residuals and fitted values and
the duration of diabetes.
The intercepts were back transformed
(using the exponential) to estimate
C-peptide levels at diagnosis from the
models. Because slopes were on a log
scale, they were interpreted in terms
of the percentage change per year (cal-
culated from the exponential of the
b-coefficient21).Thehalf-lifeofC-peptide
was calculated from loge(0.5)/b. The
variability of individual slopes in the lon-
gitudinal models was determined using
the SD range (calculated by back trans-
forming the b-coefficient 6 1 SD of the
slopes).
All analysis was carried out in R version
3.3.2, including the mgcv package (for
GAMmodels),thelme4package(formixed-
effects models), and the segmented pack-
age (for segmented regression).
RESULTS
Cross-sectional Analysis Identifies
Two Phases of C-Peptide Decline
Generalized additive modeling of cross-
sectional data was used to explore the
initial shape of the association and re-
vealed a nonlinear association between
log UCPCR and disease duration (Fig. 1A).
This is suggestive of two phases: an initial
log-linear (exponential) decline followed
by a more stable period where the as-
sociation flattens out. Characteristics of
the 1,549 individuals in the cross-sectional
cohort are shown in Supplementary
Table 1.
To model the slopes of these two
phases, segmented regression was used.
Figure 1B shows the two fitted slopes, and
the corresponding summary statistics,
including the estimated UCPCR as mod-
eled at diagnosis and at the breakpoint, are
presented in Table 1. The optimal break-
point (i.e., the point at which the slope
changes) was modeled at 6.9 years from
initial diagnosis (95% CI 6.3, 7.5). Over this
period, UCPCR declined by 47%/year
(95% CI 43, 51) (P , 0.0001), equivalent
to a half-life of 1.10 years (95% CI 0.99,
1.25). Beyond 6.9 years, the slope was
flat, suggesting a more stable period with
no further decline (10.07%/year [95%
CI 21.3, 11.5], P = 0.8).
The Rates of Decline Were Similar
Across All Ages at Diagnosis, but the
Overall UCPCR Values Were Higher at
All Durations in Those Who Received
Diagnoses at Older Ages
Figure 2 shows the patterns of associa-
tion between disease duration and UCPCR
when splitting the data by the median age
at diagnosis (10.8 years). In both “age at
diagnosis” groups, the pattern of b-cell
decline was similar, showing an initial
exponential fall followed by a more stable
period.Therewasnosignificantdifference
in the slope of the first phase of decline
in those who had received a diagnosis of
diabetes at #10.8 years of age compared
with those diagnosed at .10.8 years of age
(42% vs. 49% decrease/year, P = 0.13)
(Table2).TheassociationbetweenUCPCR
and duration was much flatter in the
second phase in both groups (Table 1).
Although the initial slopes were similar
in each age-group, the absolute UCPCR
value was higher across all time points in
those who were older at diagnosis: the
intercept was higher (indicating the UCPCR
at diagnosis was higher) (1.32 vs.
0.27 nmol/mmol, P , 0.0001), as well
as the modeled UCPCR at the breakpoint
(i.e., the level for the start of the second
more stable phase) (0.022 vs. 0.005 nmol/
mmol, P , 0.0001). Based on the initial
UCPCR and half-life estimated from the
slopes, we can calculate that for patients
receiving a diagnosis of diabetes at #10.8
years of age, it would take 0.6 years to
reachthe clinically important thresholdof
absolute insulin deficiency (0.2 nmol/
mmol [equivalent to 200 pmol/L]) (21)
comparedwith2.7yearsintheoldergroup
(diagnosed at .10.8 years of age).
Longitudinal Cohorts Validate the Two
Phases of C-Peptide Decline in Both
Plasma and Urine
To validate the existence of two distinct
phases, separate models were analyzed

Type 1 Diabetes: Two Phases of C-Peptide Decline
Diabetes Care Volume 41, July 2018
 using longitudinal data obtained either in
the first 7 years (individual patient data
rounded to the nearest year) or after
7 years, in line with the estimated in-
flection point from cross-sectional data.
Of 221 patients with repeat UCPCR re-
sults, 41 had both initial and repeat
results within 7 years of diagnosis and
121 had both initial and repeat results
beyond 7 years after diagnosis.
The patterns were similar to those seen
in the cross-sectional data, with an initial
exponential fall in UCPCR during the first
7 years (48% decrease/year [SD range
for variability of individual slopes 267
to 218], half-life 1.1 years) (Table 2) and
a more stable phase showing no further
decline after that time (0.1% decrease/year
[SD range 21.8 to 11.7]) (Table 2). When
excluding those patients whose first re-
sult was below the lower limit of the assay
(to examine only those whose C-peptide
levelscouldfall),therewasaslightdecline
in the second phase, but this was far
slower than that seen in the first 7 years
(24.5%/year [SD range 29.0 to 10.3]),
half-life 15 years) (Table 2).
In the 26 patients who had a UCPCR
.0.2 nmol/mmol (significant endogenous
insulin) (21,22) beyond 7 years after di-
agnosis, there was no decrease in slope on
repeat sampling (20.7%/year [95% CI 24,
13], P = 0.7). Fifteen of twenty-six of these
patients were positive for either GAD or
IA2 autoantibodies, and given the high
positive predictive value of islet autoanti-
bodies in this age-group and our strict
inclusion criteria, this reinforces the con-
clusion that these individuals have type 1
diabetesdespitetheirhighC-peptidelevels.
Similar patterns were seen in the long-
duration patients when assessing the
longitudinal plasma C-peptide data. Of
the 105 patients with repeat plasma
C-peptide results, only 5 had repeat sam-
plesintheinitial7yearsafterdiagnosis,so
analysis of the first phase was not carried
out. Data were available from 93 patients
who had initial and all repeat samples
beyond 7 years duration, and, again, there
was no decline in slope over this second
phase (22.6% decrease/year, P = 0.2
[SD range 212.6 to 18.5]) (Table 2).
Results were similar when excludingthose
whose first measurement was below the
lower limit of the assay (Table 2).
CONCLUSIONS
We have shown, using both cross-
sectional data and longitudinal data,
that there are two phases of C-peptide
decline in the first 40 years after the
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. These com-
prise an initial exponential fall over the
first 7 years, followed by a more stable
period, where C-peptide levels either
completely plateau or decline much
more slowly.
ThedeclineinC-peptidelevelsoverthe
first few years after diagnosis has been
studied in detail in a number of other
studies (10–14,20). The rate of decline

 we show of ;47%/year up to 7 years
is similar to that reported previously
(10,20). Some studies (11,13) have not used
log-transformed data for analysis, but,
despite this, the patterns reported are
consistent with an exponential fall.
Toourknowledge,thisisthefirststudy
examining the continuous pattern of
C-peptide concentrations over time in
long-durationtype1diabetes.Analysisof
the T1D Exchange cohort investigated
the prevalence of detectable C-peptide
and found a decrease with increasing
duration, but as the outcome was cate-
gorical this did not fully capture the
changing association (4). The longest pre-
vious longitudinal study we have been
able to identify modeled C-peptide over
the first 7.4 years after diagnosis but used
older, less sensitive C-peptide assays, so
was unable to evaluate the pattern of
decline at lower levels (23). Our data
suggest that there is a major change at
aroundthispoint,withadramaticdecline
in C-peptide secretion (half-life of ;1
year)overthefirst7yearsafterdiagnosis,
followed by a relatively stable period
beyond 7 years, where C-peptide levels
either remain fairly constant or decline
much more slowly (half-life estimated
at 15 years from longitudinal plasma
C-peptide data). This change is consistent
with data showing HbA1c “tracks” over
time stabilizing after ;6 years (24).
In our study, the absolute values of
C-peptide differed according to age at
diagnosis, with younger patients having
lower levels on average, but the rate of
decline and disease duration before
the second stable phase was similar
in individuals who received a diagnosis
below or above 10.8 years of age (the
median age at diagnosis). The finding that
younger patients have lower levels of
C-peptide at diagnosis (and throughout
the disease process) is well established
(4,10,13,20) and fits nicely with studies
of the pancreas that show fewer residual
insulin-containing islets in patients hav-
ing younger ages at disease onset (8). The
similarity in the rate of decline between
those patients who received a diagnosis
in childhood and in teenage years has also
been seen previously (4,10,11). By con-
trast, the studies that have suggested
that the rate of C-peptide decline is faster
in patients who received a diagnosis at
younger ages have used other outcomes,
such as time to a given low C-peptide
threshold, to judge the rate and, as
such, are not directly comparable with
the present data (9,12). Nevertheless,
given that we find an exponential loss,
and that younger patients with lower
C-peptide levels at diagnosis would
reach a low threshold more quickly,
these previous results are not incon-
sistent with our data.
The finding of two phases suggests a
change in the underlying biological pro-
cesses leading to b-cell demise at ;7
years of disease duration. The fact that
the pattern and inflection points were
similar in those who received a diagnosis
at both younger and older ages suggests
that this is a feature of disease progres-
sion, rather than being determined by
the chronological age of the patient.
This means that it is more likely to be
a manifestation of changes occurring
in the disease process in the pancreas
rather than differences in puberty or in
the maturity of the pancreas.
The nature of the biological changes
thatresultinthestabilizationofC-peptide
are not revealed by our study, so we see
our findings as largely hypothesis gen-
erating. The stability of C-peptide after
;7 years could reflect either the persis-
tence of a less susceptible population of
b-cells that remains after the period of
exponential decay or a change in the
immune-mediated attack at this time.
Recent work (25) has described subpo-
pulations of b-cells, including a putative
“hub” cell population within islets, and
it may be that certain cells are able to
escape the immune destruction that af-
fects all other b-cells. A change in the
immune response is another possibility,
and there is evidence that the immune
attack may subside over time, given the
recent finding that HLA class I hyperex-
pression on the residual insulin-containing
islets of individuals with type 1 diabetes
(which is prominent at diagnosis) declines
with disease duration (26). However,
altered immune responses could also
reflect changes in antigen expression
and/or antigen presentation.
Follow-up prospective studies involv-
ing repeated C-peptide measurements
before and after the 7-year inflection
point in larger numbers of people would
be of considerable value. These would
allow the timing of the change in the rate
of C-peptide decline to be examined in

Type 1 Diabetes: Two Phases of C-Peptide Decline
Diabetes Care Volume 41, July 2018
 individual subjects and combined with
simultaneous immune studies. However,
the considerable intraindividual variation
in both C-peptide estimation and immune
cell populations would mean that large
numbers of people must be studied.
Understanding the mechanisms that
mediate the change in C-peptide decline
occurring at the inflection point will not
only help to elucidate the underlying
biological mechanisms of b-cell destruc-
tionovertimeintype1diabetes,butmay
also lead to improved strategies for b-cell
preservation. If the level of C-peptide
attained in any given person at 7 years
after diagnosis is sustained, then this
would also have implications for future
intervention trials. The majority of trials
currently focus on preserving b-cell func-
tion close to the diagnosis of type 1 di-
abetes, but our new finding offers the
potential for therapeutic trials to be un-
dertaken later in the disease process.
Our study has strengths and weak-
nesses. The major strengths are 1) the
large numbers people studied (.1,500);
2) that we combined both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies, measuring both
urine and plasma C-peptide, which show
consistent support for both the stabili-
zation of C-peptide levels at 7 years
and the rate of exponential deterioration
before that; and 3) that we examined
a large range of disease durations (up
to 40 years). The major weaknesses are
thattheinitialanalysiswasbasedoncross-
sectional data, and the longitudinal studies
were based on repeat samples collected
over a relatively short period (2–4 years)
with the number of measurements lim-
ited to two for most individuals. Therefore,
larger, longer, and more frequently sam-
pled longitudinal replication would have
considerable value, particularly prospec-
tivestudies crossing the 7-year time point.
Without a longer follow-up time, we can-
not determine the extent to which our
resultsreflectthepatternofC-peptideloss
in all patients. However, given that the
second phase, as modeled, is flat, this
pattern would not occur if some patients
were still declining at this point, without
an equivalent number increasing their
C-peptide levels to balance this. The fact
that the second-phase slope still remains
relatively flat even when removing those
individuals whose measured C-peptide level
is below the limit of the assay suggests
that this is not an artifact caused by the in-
clusionofpeoplewithunrecordablevalues.
Moreover, we used strict inclusion criteria
to ensure that potential cases of type 2
or monogenic diabetes were excluded.
Given the rarity of other causes in those
individuals who received a diagnosis at the
youngest ages and the high proportion of
positive islet autoantibodies in those with
high C-peptide levels, we feel that it is
unlikely that the individuals studied had a
form of diabetes other than type 1, and
that any potential misclassification will be
minimal.Itshouldalsobeemphasizedthat
we have used home postmeal UCPCR and
random nonfasting plasma C-peptide re-
sults rather than results from a gold stan-
dard mixed-meal tolerance test for the
present analysis. However, both of these
C-peptide measurements have been val-
idated against the mixed-meal tolerance
test and shown to be highly correlated
(17,19). Although, the measurements
we used are potentially more prone to
noise, we have used large sample sizes,
and, importantly, the results were re-
markably consistent in both plasma and
urine.Finally,itisimportanttonotethat
this study was carried out on predomi-
nantly white cohorts. Further work is
neededtodeterminewhetherthepattern
is generalizable to other racial groups.
In conclusion, we have shown that
there are two phases of C-peptide decline
in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The
stabilization of C-peptide levels at ;7
years after diagnosis suggests that there
are important and previously unrecog-
nized changes in immune function and/
or b-cell viability around this time that
may have critical implications for future
pharmaceutical interventions.
