Strain and rate-dependent 
neuronal injury in a 3D in vitro 
compression model of traumatic 
brain injury
Eyal Bar-Kochba, Mark T. Scimone, Jonathan B. Estrada & Christian Franck
In the United States over 1.7 million cases of traumatic brain injury are reported yearly, but predictive 
correlation of cellular injury to impact tissue strain is still lacking, particularly for neuronal injury 
resulting from compression. Given the prevalence of compressive deformations in most blunt head 
trauma, this information is critically important for the development of future mitigation and diagnosis 
strategies. Using a 3D in vitro neuronal compression model, we investigated the role of impact strain 
and strain rate on neuronal lifetime, viability, and pathomorphology. We find that strain magnitude 
and rate have profound, yet distinctively different effects on the injury pathology. While strain 
magnitude affects the time of neuronal death, strain rate influences the pathomorphology and extent 
of population injury. Cellular injury is not initiated through localized deformation of the cytoskeleton 
but rather driven by excess strain on the entire cell. Furthermore we find that, mechanoporation, one of 
the key pathological trigger mechanisms in stretch and shear neuronal injuries, was not observed under 
compression.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant global health and economic challenge. In the United States alone, 
over 1.7 million people suffer from TBI every year1. At the cellular scale, diffuse neuronal injury, including diffuse 
axonal injury (DAI) and neurite swelling, has emerged as one of the hallmark pathological identifiers of TBI. 
Diffuse neuronal injury and DAI have been linked both to acute TBI symptoms2–5 and progressive neurodegener-
ative diseases, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease4,6–8. Morphologically, diffuse neuronal injuries and 
cellular degeneration are identified by membrane swelling, or blebbing, due to vesicle and organelle accumulation 
within the injured neuronal cell9–14. Although the clinical importance of neuronal injury is widely recognized, a 
complete understanding of the exact strain and deformation mechanisms, modalities and thresholds producing 
the injury remains elusive. This challenge is compounded further by the lack of appropriate three-dimensional 
neuronal injury platforms capable of resolving the injury evolution with sufficient spatiotemporal detail. Previous 
in vitro investigations, derived largely from relatively stiff, two-dimensional substrata under the application of 
shear15–19 and stretch insults20–25, have shaped much of our current understanding of the injury mechanism, and 
its associate strain and strain-rate levels. While much of the literature has focused on investigations involving 
tensile and shear deformations, which can be straightforwardly recapitulated in simplified 2D assays, little spa-
tiotemporal details of cellular injury strains have been reported of neurons undergoing compressive loading, 
which inherently requires 3D impact platforms. It is important to note that compressive deformations play a 
significant role in insults to the head as the majority of the initial impact-derived deformation wave is highly 
compressive26–29. Furthermore, result from head impact and finite element modeling simulations show that the 
brain is exposed to several compression waves during the course of a typical head impact26,27,30, yet detailed meas-
urements correlating compressive strains to neuronal injury are largely lacking.
Furthermore, most in-vitro investigations of cellular TBI have provided discrete endpoint data, rather than 
detailing the temporal evolution of neuronal degeneration immediately post insult. Resolution of the injury time 
line as a function of applied strain and strain rate is important to determine the maximum window of possible ther-
apeutic intervention to mitigate or prevent any irreversible cell damage. At a minimum, the timeline when neurite 
or axonal swelling is first observed should be documented as a function of impact strains and strain rate to this end.

To address this knowledge gap we developed a high-resolution, in-situ 3D neuronal compression device 
for administering controlled and repeatable uniaxial compression deformations to neurons embedded in 3D 
collagen gels. Since the device is installed directly on top of a laser scanning confocal microscope the entire 
continuous timeline of injury post-impact can be resolved. Using our previously-developed fast iterative dig-
ital volume correlation algorithm, we experimentally verified that the applied strain fields are indeed uniform 
throughout the entire imaging volume. By employing a custom-built 3D image segmentation procedure we 
resolve orientation-dependent neurite strains for strain magnitudes equal or greater than 0.012. Through spatio-
temporal correlation between changes in neurite morphology and 3D strain mapping we find that excess in local 
shear strains correlate with the localization of neurite blebbing, but, interestingly, not with neuronal cell death. 
Instead, we find neuronal cell death to correlate most strongly with an excess in the total cell-averaged, or mean, 
axial strain nearly independent of applied strain rate. Strain rate on the other hand, had profound effects on neu-
ronal pathomorphology and the extent of population injury. Lastly, we investigated whether compression-driven 
local axial and shear deformations would produce similar levels of mechanoporation generally observed in shear 
and tension mediated neuronal injury assays. Interestingly, under compression no significant amounts of mech-
anoporation were observed until cells became severely fragmented.
Given the prevalence of compressive deformations among TBI impacts, our findings provide new insight on 
the dependence of neuronal injury and pathomorpholgy on applied strain and strain rate in compression.
Results
3D Compression model and characterization of the applied far-field strain. 
A new 3D cellular 
 
in vitro model of neuronal injury was developed to investigate the role of mechanoporation, shear, and axial 
deformations in neurons subjected to single compressive impacts. Primary cortical neurons embedded in type I 
collagen gels (2.2 mg/mL) were subjected to three different loading regimes (10−4 s−1, 10 s−1, and 75 s−1) at max-
imum compressive strains of 0.38 in quasistatic (10−4 s−1) and 0.30 in dynamic loading (Fig. 1a,b). The dynami-
cally applied strain magnitudes of 0.30 and peak strain rates of 10 s−1 and 75 s−1 (Fig. 1e) were chosen to match the 
range of previous cellular TBI investigations15,17,31. Prior to loading, neuronal cultures exhibited morphologically 
healthy network formation (Fig. 1c) and viability (Supplementary Fig. S1) in the collagen matrix as determined 
with confocal microscopy (Fig. 1d), and compared to previous literature results32,33.
In order to estimate the spatial distribution of matrix strains experienced by the embedded cells, the 3D 
volumetric strain fields inside the collagen gels were quantitatively resolved using our previously developed fast 
iterative digital volume correlation (FIDVC) technique34. Neuronal cultures embedded with 0.5 µm fluorescent 
microspheres were quasistatically compressed at applied far-field strain increments of 0.02 and subsequently 
imaged via confocal microscopy (Fig. 2a).
Quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution of the displacement field along the loading axis x3 shows 
that the collagen surrounding the neurons is uniformly compressed within the resolution of our FIDVC tech-
nique35, which, for the current study, can resolve any displacement motion greater than 0.63, 0.69, and 0.63 μm in 
the x1, x2, and x3 directions, respectively (Fig. 2c,d; Supplemental Subsection: Spherical Inclusion Problem). Given 
the temporal limitation in typical laser scanning confocal microscopes, including our own, these 3D displacement 
measurements could only be carried out at quasistatic (10−4 s−1) conditions. While the stress response of both the 
collagen and neuronal networks may show significant viscoelastic effects36, the material strains, which are the 
controlled inputs of our device, are expected to be similar for the higher loading rates thus serving as estimators 
for the locally experienced cellular strain fields during impact. To determine whether fluid-derived shear stresses 
could be responsible for inducing neuronal injury at the higher loading rates, we visualized interstitial fluid flow 
through the collagen network using the tracer dye Rhodamine. We find that the average image intensity remained 
constant before and after impact showing that pressure driven flow (e.g., as described using Darcy’s law) was 
negligible for the collagen scaffolds used in our study, and that cell deformations were imparted primarily by the 
surrounding matrix rather than the pore fluid.
Morphological injury assessment of neurons. 
Common morphological TBI injury indicators including 
blebbing, retraction, and thinning of neurites were quantified at each strain rate via confocal time-lapse imaging. 
Time evolution 3D confocal micrographs of representative neurons for each strain rate revealed two distinct, 
loading-rate dependent neuropathomorphologies (Fig. 3). The first signs of structural degeneration, or changes 
within the pre-impact cytoskeleton, occured around six hours after the original impact. Once the structural 
changes became visible, cytoskeletal deteoriation proceeded quickly ending in cell death marked by either com-
plete cellular fragmentation or somatic lysis around 9.7 hours. Somatic lysis is considered an endpoint criterion of 
cell death, in which failure of cellular structural components leads to termination of active cellular processes and 
necrosis37. Neurons impacted at

this retraction and thinning morphology, but exhibited additional formation of visible focal blebs along their

in size until somatic lysis occurred. In contrast, smaller blebs gradually increased in number and size, producing 
local cell fragmentation. Quantifying the relative occurrence of each injury morphology for all impacted cells, we 
found an approximately 1.7-fold increase in occurrence of bleb formation with increasing strain rate: 37% of dead

Analysis of local and cell-averaged (mean) axial and shear strains. 
To assess whether bleb forma-
tion is spatially correlated with a particular strain magnitude threshold, the local axial (Ec) and shear (Es) strains 
were computed for neurons exhibiting clear bleb formation (Fig. 4a,b). The maximum value of Ec and Es in the 
immediate proximity of each bleb was computed for eight neurons impacted at 
=

E
75s 1 (Fig. 4c,d; 
Supplemental Methods). The inverse cumulative distribution function shows that bleb formation is strongly cor-
related with an average local shear threshold value of Es = 
 0.14, while being uncorrelated with the axial strains. 
These data suggest that the presence of significant local shearing may generate cellular blebs within six to eight 
hours following the initial impact. An excess in local strains, however, may not be the primary cause of cell death,

since only 32% of all dead cells presented neurite blebbing, and neither the local axial and shear strains correlated 
with other morphological features.
Thus instead, we computed the cell-averaged, or mean, axial and shear strains as a measure of the average 
strain distribution across the entire neuronal cytoskeleton. Given previous literature findings showing the exist-
ence and importance of a strain-dependent physical homeostasis in neurons38–40, we investigated whether a signif-
icant perturbation in this homeostasis would correlate with the temporal progression of neuronal degeneration.
Here, we plot the cell-averaged shear and axial strains for all recorded neurons versus the measured time 
of cell death, td (Fig. 4f,g; Supplemental Methods). Our results show that td strongly correlates with the mean 
axial strains but not the mean shear strains, highlighting the importance of injury modality during compression. 
Although, the result might seem obvious given that the far field strains are largely compressive, it is important to 
note that, because of the 3D orientation of each neurite within the gel, each cell encounters a significant amount 
of shear strain, which does not correlate with injury in our study.
The correlation between 〈 
Ec〉 
 and td was quantified by computing the minimum covariance determinant 
(MCD) estimator, which fit the data to a bivariate normal distribution41,42. To confirm the fitting, the contour map 
of the bivariate probability density function shows a normal-like distribution within the ellipse (Fig. 4g (inset))43. 
The ellipse shown represents an isocontour at 95% confidence of the normal distribution and provides a relation-
ship between time of cell death and the mean axial impact strain experienced. This relationship is described by 
the equation td = 
 62.5(0.265 − 
 〈 
Ec〉 
), which signifies the major axis of the distribution and holds true within the 
95% confidence interval. The ellipse is further characterized by the spatial location of the centroid μ (td = 9.67 hr, 
〈 
Ec〉 
 = 
 0.107) and major and minor axis lengths a1 (3.94 hr, 0.065) and a2 (1.65 hr, 0.014), respectively. The relative 
major and minor axis lengths define the eccentricity of the ellipse as 0.96.
Cell permeability measurements. 
Detection of mechanoporation was performed using the cell-impermeable 
 
fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 568 hydrazide (AFH), which causes a rise in internal intensity upon passing through 
a compromised cell membrane (Fig. 5a). To quantitatively assess AFH influx after mechanical loading, the mean 
intensity within the cell boundary was computed for impact strain rates of 10 s−1 and 75 s−1. Mean intensity was 
compared to a positive control, treated with the surfactant Triton X-100, which generates significant membrane 
poration, and a negative control, without mechanical loading (Fig. 5b). The average influx time, defined as the

time at which the internal fluorescence from AFH peaked (Fig. 5b), was compared to the average cellular death 
time for both strain rates (Fig. 5c). Time of cell death was assessed as the time point at which somatic lysis or a 
combination of leaking of live cell dye Calcein AM and severe morphological deformities occurred. Leakage of 
calcein AM fluorescence has been shown to correlate with other cell death markers44.
For loading rates of 10 s−1 and 75 s−1, AFH did not infiltrate the neurons until the cell membrane was already 
severely fragmented (Fig. 5a). This observation is contrary to several previous shear- and stretch-based in vitro 
injury models showing that membrane permeability steadily increases after impact loading20,23,45,46. Instead, we 
find that AFH inflow only occurred at the time of cell death with average influx times of 9.8 ±

Discussion
Through careful spatiotemporal analysis we determined our measured strain and strain rates to have profound, 
yet distinctly different effects on neuronal injury under compressive impact loading. In particular for the two 
evaluated impact loading rates (

experienced by the injured cells. The morphological differences are important for two reasons. First, it indicates a 
shift in neuropathomorphology with increasing strain rate, albeit an only small increase in the percentage of total 
cell death normalized by 7 day in vitro viability (Supplementary Fig. S1), i.e. 59% for

impact durations on the order of 100 ms the observed neuronal injury morphologies less often include bleb for-
mation, contrary to previously reported stretch and shear induced injuries13,18. This finding might be particularly 
important for histological screenings post-mortem, which may underpredict the injury extent if neurite blebbing 
is employed as the main pathomorphological indicator, which is not representative of strain rates at

Although these slower strain rates may not reflect the time scale of the initial compression wave, it is conceivable 
that these slower loading rates exist within intracranial stress waves, which are likely to be attenuated by the var-
ious elastic impedance changes and viscosities present in brain matter27,30,47,48.
The observed bleb and cell death dependencies on strain rate (Figs 3 and 4e) may be due to the unique viscoe-
lastic properties of the neuronal cytoskeleton49,50. In 2014 Ahmadzadeh et al. numerically estimated the 
rate-dependent disassociation of microtubule-associated tau proteins leading to neuronal injury at critical strain 
rates of 22–40 s−1 31. At subcritical strain rates (i.e. < =
−

E
10s 1), viscoelastic tau proteins allow for reversible 
sliding of microtubules31, preventing cellular damage, which is consistent with our quasistatic compression results 
(Figs 2 and 3) and previous literature results51,52. However, at supercritical rates, (e.g. 
=
−

E
75s 1), strain stiffening 
of tau proteins causes significant load transfer onto microtubules, resulting in large-scale microtubule damage31. 
This failure behavior at high strain rates may be responsible for disrupting neurite transport, causing the accumu-
lation of vesicles and organelles, which manifests morphologically as bleb formation13.

Though striking, strain rate considerations only explain part of the injury narrative. While morphology during 
cell death has been determined, the timeline of cell death and the dependence on local versus mean axial strain 
requires attention. The histogram of local axial strain Ec shows a multimodal distribution, suggesting that bleb 
formation is not correlated with Ec. In contrast, the histogram of Es shows a skewed distribution with the highest 
peak at Es ≈ 
 0.16, suggesting that local shear deformations may be the mechanical driving force behind bleb for-
mation. However, it should be noted that bleb formation was only observed for a subset of all injured cells, and 
primarily occurred at the higher strain rate (Fig. 4e), suggesting that these local deformation measures cannot 
fully account for all observed cell deaths.
Recent studies have shown that long-range intra-axonal tension is required for the proper regulation and 
execution of neurotransmission53 and active vesicle transport along axons and neurites54. This tensional homeo-
stasis is carefully regulated by neurons50 through the dynamic modulation of the cytoskeleton. Neurons via their 
internal contractility machinery tend to restore this physical homeostasis when perturbed on the time scales 
of minutes or longer50,54. Our results show that neurons subjected to large quasistatic compressive strains up 
to 0.38 show no sign of injury or cell death (Fig. 2). In contrast, neurons subjected to mechanical deformations 
at time scales much faster than their own contractility regulation times, as in the case for millisecond impacts 
(Fig. 3) may experience large-scale disruptions in tensional homeostasis resulting in neuronal injury and cell 
death. Furthermore, in our measurements we did not observe any noticeable rearrangement of neurons dur-
ing the quasi-static loading and unloading cycle, suggesting that contractility rather than reorientation or shape 
changes are invoked to maintain physical homeostasis. This is consistent with previous literature results on other 
cell type showing that significant contractility and surface traction changes can occur without significant changes 
in cell shape55,56. However, it is important to note that cellular reorientation will eventually occur as a result of 
a significant alterations in cellular contractility given that the external load is not removed or that altered cell 
tractions are maintained over extended periods of time. To test whether a disruption in the physical homeosta-
sis of the neuron is responsible for the observed cell death, we shifted our focus from resolving the local strain 
variations along neuronal extensions (Fig. 4c,d) to computing the mean (cell-averaged) shear and compressive 
axial strains experienced by each cell 〈 
Es〉 
 and 〈 
Ec〉 (Fig. 4f,g), respectively. Interestingly, and independent of the 
investigated strain rates and bleb formation, all data points coalesced into a narrow band for both axial and shear 
strains. The general shape of each cluster indicates the functional correlation between td and the respective mean 
strain metric. The time of cell death was independent of the magnitude of the mean shear strain experienced by 
the cells, suggesting that cell death is not dependent upon 〈 
Es〉 
. In contrast, we found a strong correlation between 
the mean axial strain magnitude, 〈 
Ec〉 
, and the time of cell death.

The relationship between mean axial strain and time of cell death defines the most likely timeframe of cell 
death after impact for a given mean axial strain magnitude. We found the relation between the mean axial strain, 
〈 
Ec〉 
, and time of cell death, td (Fig. 4g; Supplemental Methods) to be linear within an elliptical 95% isocontour of 
a bivariate normal distribution, or specifically, td = 
 62.5(0.265 − 
 〈 
Ec〉 
). The high eccentricity of the ellipse (Fig. 4g) 
describes the linear behavior between the mean axial injury strain and time of cell death and suggests that cell 
death is primarily driven by the mean, not the local, compressive axial strain. The clustering of injury data points 
within the ellipse indicates that the relationship between the time of cell death and the level of experienced axial 
strain is independent of strain rate as long as the strain rate is sufficiently high (i.e.

1). No 
cell death was observed for neurons undergoing compression at quasistatic (10−4 s−1) loading rates. The signifi-
cance of this correlation is that it allows prediction of time of cell death for a given cell-average axial strain mag-
nitude for a cell impacted above the critical strain rate. For example, neurons experiencing around 7% axial strain 
died on average 12 hours post impact, whereas neurons subjected to 12% strain died within only 7 hours. To our 
knowledge, this is the first 3D cellular death timeframe reported for neurons undergoing compression, and it 
presents a quantitative estimate on a potential therapeutic time window over which neuronal degeneration and 
subsequent cell death might be mitigated.
Finally, we investigated whether mechanoporation, which has been reported as an inciting event of neuronal 
injury in shear and tension assays, does also occur under compression. Interestingly and within the resolution of 
our confocal images (> 
200 nm), we did not observe mechanoporation in compression. The sharp, as opposed to 
gradual, increase in observed internal fluorescence (Fig. 5b) suggests that compression may not initiate the same 
enzymatic formation of non-resealable secondary pores (or mechanoporation), typically observed in stretch or 
shear deformation dominated neuronal injury models.
It is important to note that there are several limitations in our study, which should be addressed by future 
studies employing either the same or a similar experimental, high-resolution 3D approach. First, it is important to 
understand that many cells are sensitive to the local physical properties of their surrounding environment includ-
ing the stiffness of the extracellular matrix, which may play an important role in the transduction of force and 
deformations onto the cells. Next, the role of integrins and their mechanotransducive capacity in neurons remains 
to be determined, which will have implications on the composition (e.g., laminin vs. collagen) and physical stiff-
ness of the ECM. Given current advances in 3D cell matrix fabrication, these are all parameters that can be stud-
ied within the context of the presented experimental approach but are beyond the framework of the current study. 
Determination of the electrophysiology, spontaneous and stimulated neurotransmission pre- and post-impact 
provide exciting and important aspects for characterizing the full effect of the disease, but their current imple-
mentation particularly in 3D culture settings is still in its infancy. Approaches that are non-invasive and feature 
high spatiotemporal resolution are currently investigated and will provide additional insight into the temporal 
degeneration of neurons post-impact57. The strain rate effects on the presented neuronal pathormophology, while 
significant, are certainly not exhaustive, and future studies are encouraged to expand upon the rate-dependent 
results presented here. It should be noted that our current investigation focuses on examining the injury response 
of neurons subjected to a single compression cycle, rather than a more complex compression loading profile, 
which is consistent with currently available literature data. As new findings become available documenting actual 
brain tissue impact loading time histories, our experimental impact procedure can be straightforwardly modified 
to investigate the cellular injury response to more complex wave forms. Using the results of this study as a foun-
dation, future studies should evaluate injury strain thresholds and associated correlations of the pathomorhology 
and cell death in neurons in mixed cell cultures including neurons, astroctyes and the various microglia58.
Conclusion
This study presents previously undocumented spatiotemporal details on the strain and strain rate dependent 
pathomorphology of 3D neurons undergoing compressive impacts. Specifically, we show that neurite swelling, 
the morphological representation of cellular TBI, is highly loading rate-dependent in compression. That is, in 
regions of the brain undergoing compression, bleb formation associated with cellular TBI may represent just one 
pathological subset of neuronal injury, specifically, ones that have been compressed at high strain rates (e.g., 
=
−

E
75s 1). Injured tissue containing neurons not exhibiting bleb formation may therefore go undetected if neu-
rite and axonal swelling are used as primary neuropathomorphology identifier, but may still represent an impor-
tant source of cellular TBI.
Through careful spatiotemporal 3D analysis, we provide the first quantitative description of the local and 
mean, i.e., cell-averaged, injury strains and associated death timeframe for neurons under compression. 
Interestingly, we find that this injury timeframe was only a function of the applied strain magnitude, rather than 
the rate of strain. Conversely, strain rate dictated the extent of injured cells across the population, and as discussed 
earlier, significantly influenced the pathomorphology of neuronal injury, rendering both strain metrics important 
injury effectors. Lastly, we show that mechanoporation, a common event preceding neuronal degeneration in 
tension and shear TBI assays, is absent in compression for our applied strain magnitudes and strain rates.
Given the prevalence of compressive loading during head impacts, the findings of this study should provide 
beneficial information for the detection and quantification of neuronal injuries in in vivo investigations, clinical 
diagnosis, and simulation of head impacts26–30. Furthermore, albeit simplistic, this study may provide a foun-
dation for quantitative experimental design to understand cellular thresholds and associated death timelines in 
3D in-vitro culture models. Future studies should expand the current investigation to address how differences in 
extracellular matrix composition, co-culture conditions (e.g., inclusion of astrocytes), and mechanotransduction 
across ligand-integrin linkages affect the reported injury threshold and injury timeframes.

Methods
3D Collagen Gel Preparation for Neuronal Compression. 
All procedures involving animals were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Brown University and in accordance with the 
guidelines set forth. Cortical neurons were isolated from neonatal rats (Sprague-Dawley; p0-p1) and then encap-
sulated in 3D collagen (2.2 mg/mL) hydrogels. Cylindrical gels were cast using custom Delrin molds. Experiments 
were initiated after an initial 7 day in vitro (DIV) growth and synaptogenesis period, during which they were 
maintained in humidified cell incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Culture medium was exchanged at 24 h and every 
2 days thereafter.
Confocal Microscopy and Live Cell Imaging. 
For all compression experiments, neuron viability and 
geometry were assessed using calcein AM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and acute alterations in 
plasma membrane permeability following compressive loading were assessed by evaluating uptake of Alexa 
Fluor 568 Hydrazide (AFH) (Life Technologies). Three-dimensional image volumes of neurons immediately 
after mechanical insult were acquired using a temperature-controlled Nikon A-1 confocal system mounted on 
a Ti-Eclipse inverted optical microscope controlled by NIS–Elements Nikon software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). 
Control experiments were conducted to confirm neuron population viability in the collagen hydrogels through 
9 DIV (Supplementary Fig. S1) using calcein AM as a live cell stain and Ethidium homodimer–1 (EthD-1; Life 
Technologies) as a dead cell stain. Control experiments to induce cell membrane poration were performed by 
introducing 0.1% Triton X-100 after staining with calcein AM and AFH.
3D Cell Compression Device and Strain Field Characterization. 
The cell compression device consists 
of a custom frame-mounted linear voice coil actuator (VCA; LAS 13–18, BEI Kimco, San Marcos, CA) attached 
to the confocal microscope stage. Uniaxial compressive strain is generated by linear motion of the VCA piston 
in contact with a glass cover slip resting on top of the collagen gel. The piston has a spherical tip to ensure nor-
mal contact with the cover slip. Motion of the piston is produced via a servo controller (SilverSterling S2-IG; 
Quicksilver Controls, Inc., Covina, CA) and integrated hall-based displacement transducer. The VCA was pro-
grammed to deliver strain magnitudes of 0.30 and peak strain rates of 10 s−1 and 75 s−1. The uniaxial compressive 
strain field was validated under quasistatic loading (2% strain increments with 2 min loading time, to a maximum 
of 38%) on 3D collagen neuron cultures (n = 
 7) containing 6 v/v% fluorescent microspheres (0.5 µm diameter, 
Fisher Scientific) using fast-iterative digital volume correlation34.
