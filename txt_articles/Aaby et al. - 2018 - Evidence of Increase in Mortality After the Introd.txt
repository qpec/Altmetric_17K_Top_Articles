Background: Whole-cell diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP) and oral polio vaccine 
(OPV) were introduced to children in Guinea-Bissau in 1981. We previously reported 
that DTP in the target age group from 3 to 5 months of age was associated with higher 
overall mortality. DTP and OPV were also given to older children and in this study we 
tested the effect on mortality in children aged 6–35 months.
Methods: In the 1980s, the suburb Bandim in the capital of Guinea-Bissau was 
followed with demographic surveillance and tri-monthly weighing sessions for chil-
dren under 3 years of age. From June 1981, routine vaccinations were offered at the 
weighing sessions. We calculated mortality hazard ratio (HR) for DTP-vaccinated and 
DTP-unvaccinated children aged 6–35 months using Cox proportional hazard models. 
Including this study, the introduction of DTP vaccine and child mortality has been studied 
in three studies; we made a meta-estimate of these studies.
results: At the first weighing session after the introduction of vaccines, 6–35-month-
old children who received DTP vaccination had better weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) 
than children who did not receive DTP; one unit increase in WAZ was associated with 
an odds ratio of 1.32 (95% CI = 1.13–1.55) for receiving DTP vaccination. Though 
lower mortality compared with not being DTP-vaccinated was, therefore, expected, 
DTP vaccination was associated with a non-significant trend in the opposite direction, 
the HR being 2.22 (0.82–6.04) adjusted for WAZ. In a sensitivity analysis, includ-
ing all children weighed at least once before the vaccination program started, DTP 
(±OPV) as the most recent vaccination compared with live vaccines or no vaccine 
was associated with a HR of 1.89 (1.00–3.55). In the three studies of the introduction 
of DTP in rural and urban Guinea-Bissau, DTP-vaccinated children had an HR of 
2.14 (1.42–3.23) compared to DTP-unvaccinated children; this effect was separately 
significant for girls [HR = 2.60 (1.57–4.32)], but not for boys [HR = 1.71 (0.99–2.93)] 
(test for interaction p = 0.27).

conclusion: Although having better nutritional status and being protected against three 
infections, 6–35 months old DTP-vaccinated children tended to have higher mortality 
than DTP-unvaccinated children. All studies of the introduction of DTP have found 
increased overall mortality.

KeY OBserVaTiOns
• DTP and oral polio vaccine (OPV) were first introduced to 
children aged 6–35 months in June 1981 in an urban area 
in Guinea-Bissau. Children who were DTP-vaccinated at 
the first weighing session after the introduction of DTP had 
significantly better weight-for-age z-scores than those not 
vaccinated.
• Although better survival was expected, the DTP-vaccinated 
children had twofold higher mortality than DTP-unvaccinated 
children.
• In a meta-analysis of the three studies of the introduction 
of DTP in urban and rural Guinea-Bissau, DTP-vaccinated 
children had twofold higher mortality than DTP-unvaccinated 
children.
inTrODUcTiOn
Whole-cell diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP) vaccine is the 
most commonly used vaccine in low-income countries with 
poor health infrastructure, and the coverage for the third dose 
of DTP-containing vaccines (DTP3) is the main performance 
indicator for vaccination programs (1). However, no prospective 
study has shown that receiving DTP is associated with better 
child survival (2, 3). On the contrary, in the past 20 years several 
studies have suggested that DTP is associated with increased 
child mortality, particularly for girls (2–4).
We recently examined what happened when DTP and oral 
polio vaccine (OPV) were introduced to infants aged 3–5 months 
in Guinea-Bissau in June 1981 in connection with tri-monthly 
weighing sessions in an urban community in Bandim (5). In 
this age group, the child’s date of birth determined whether a 
child was vaccinated early or late. Children who were just over 
3 months old at the time of the tri-monthly weighing sessions 
were vaccinated at that age; those who were just below 3 months 
old would only be vaccinated for the first time at almost 6 months 
of age. In this “natural experiment,” DTP-vaccinated children had 
fivefold higher mortality between 3 and 6 months of age than 
children not yet vaccinated with DTP (5).
When we initiated vaccination with DTP and OPV in 
Guinea-Bissau in June 1981, we also offered a catch-up program 
to children aged 6–35 months attending the weighing sessions. 
This situation provides an opportunity to compare the survival of 
older DTP-vaccinated and DTP-unvaccinated children.
In principle, children above 3 months of age attending the 
weighing sessions were offered vaccination if vaccines and 
equipment (syringes, sterilization stove) were available. However, 
nurses and mothers were reluctant to vaccinate sick or weak 
children. Other reasons for not being vaccinated were that the 
children were temporarily traveling, or that they stayed for 
prolonged periods in the rural areas where access to health care 
was limited and child mortality was higher. Thus, apart from the 
specific disease-protective effect of DTP, inherent biases would 
lead one to expect that DTP-vaccinated children had better 
survival than DTP-unvaccinated children.

Background
Bandim Health Project (BHP) has followed an urban community 
in the capital of Guinea-Bissau with a demographic surveil-
lance system since December 1978. The national immunization 
program in Guinea-Bissau started in 1986 with funding from 
UNICEF. From January 1980, BHP conducted tri-monthly 
weighing sessions of all children in the community to identify 
malnourished children. From June 1981, vaccinations were 
offered in connection with these weighing sessions.
Demographic surveillance
When the project started in 1978, child mortality was very high. 
Malnutrition was assumed to be the main cause and a study was, 
therefore, initiated to determine why children were malnour-
ished (6–8). The area was mapped and a census was conducted 
(5). Four female health workers identified pregnant women, 
encouraged women to attend the antenatal clinic in the study 
area, and followed children with anthropometric measurements 
to assess growth patterns and detect malnourished children. 
Each health worker followed a population of 1,500–2,000 indi-
viduals, the total number of individuals in Bandim being around 
6,300 at the beginning of the study. The health worker kept a list 
of children under 3 years of age in each of the eight sub-districts 
in Bandim. An expatriate nurse supervised the health workers. 
BHP had no computerized surveillance system when the study 
started, but BHP kept an A5 card (“BHP card”) for each child, 
where weights and vaccination dates were noted. With a birth 
rate around 5%, the annual birth cohort was around 300–350 
newborns.
The Bandim population was very mobile for many reasons. 
First, it was important to maintain contact with the natal vil-
lage for ceremonial purposes and to secure access to rice, often 
by helping the family during the rice production cycle. Second, 
many women tried to obtain cash income by growing fruits or 
vegetables in the rural areas or by producing cashew wine to be 
sold in Bissau. Third, mothers were not supposed to have sexual 
relations during breastfeeding as semen is believed to damage 
breastmilk causing diarrhea in the child (9). Breastfeeding

was prolonged in Guinea-Bissau, between 18 and 36 months 
in different ethnic groups. Thus, many women preferred to 
stay in the rural areas with their family while breastfeeding. 
These cultural patterns meant that some mothers and children 
were away for long periods. Typically, there would be family 
members in Bandim, who we could ask about the whereabouts 
of the child.
Tri-Monthly Weighing sessions
We arranged tri-monthly weighing sessions in each sub-district 
(8). The health worker in charge advised mothers the day before a 
session. If a child was not present, its vital status was ascertained 
by asking the family. The following morning, the child’s weight 
was measured on a hanging Salter scale and noted on the child’s 
health card and the BHP card.
Vaccinations
There was no community vaccination program in Guinea-Bissau 
when BHP started vaccinations. Mother could have taken their 
children to the clinic of the Mother and Child Health Program in 
town. This clinic was mainly attended by the urban elite so very 
few children from Bandim had received routine vaccinations 
(5). In June 1981, BHP started to provide vaccinations at the tri-
monthly weighing sessions. A health center nurse accompanied 
the nutrition team and vaccinated eligible children.
Eligible children were between 3 months and 3 years of the 
age. However, some children in this age group were not vacci-
nated. Both nurses and mothers thought that sick or otherwise 
weak children should not be vaccinated. The BHP card often 
indicated that the child was “sick,” “malnourished,” or “orphan” 
as an explanation of why an age-eligible child had not been vac-
cinated. Other reasons for not vaccinating an age-eligible child 
were temporary shortages of vaccines or syringes.
The three DTP and OPV doses could be given from 3 months 
of age with an interval of 1 month, but since we only performed 
weighing sessions every 3 months, most children had longer 
intervals between the three doses. Also, there were several peri-
ods where either OPV or DTP was missing [Ref. (5), Figure 1]. 
The expatriate nurse sometimes organized additional vaccination 
sessions in which the children were not weighed, but vaccinations 
were noted on the BHP cards.
Data control
Weights and vaccinations from the BHP cards were entered into 
a computerized system in 1990–1991. For the present analysis, 
information on dates of visit, weights, and vaccination dates was 
checked against the original cards in 2015.
The study cohort and Vaccination 
analyses
We included children born between June 1978 and December 
1980 and hence aged 6 and 35 months in June 1981 when DTP 
and OPV vaccines became available (Figure 1). Furthermore, it 
was an inclusion criterion that children were registered in the area 
before the vaccinations started. We excluded orphans, since they 
were not breastfed and were likely to have different care; their 
mortality was very high (10). Children who never attended a 
weighing session after birth registration were not included in the 
analysis, since their mothers had likely left for the rural areas. In 
the analyses, we restricted the data set to children taking part in at 
least one weighing session after October 1980, 8–9 months before 
vaccinations started. This was done to assure that the children had 
been seen fairly recently and were, therefore, likely to be around 
when the vaccinations started. Since the children were called 
every 3 months, the time of death or migration out of the area is 
fairly accurate.
Vaccination analyses
We conducted three complementary analyses to assess the effect 
of DTP on child survival.
Analysis 1
We compared DTP-vaccinated children and those who were 
not DTP-vaccinated when they came for their first weighing 
session after the introduction of vaccinations in June 1981. 
Since not all children were included, the analysis had less 
power. We followed children from their first weighing session 
and until they received their next vaccination or they migrated, 
died, or turned 3 years of age. Thus, children had to be present 
at a weighing session to be included in this analysis and we 
could adjust for the weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) obtained at 
that session.

Analysis 2
In this analysis, children were considered DTP-vaccinated 
from the date they received their first DTP vaccination (with 
or without OPV) in June 1981, or at one of the subsequent 
weighing sessions (Figure 2). Children were considered DTP-
unvaccinated from the date vaccination was first offered in 
their sub-district, irrespective of whether they were present at 
the weighing session, and until they were DTP-vaccinated at 
a subsequent session, migrated, died, or turned 3 years of age. 
(The difference between this analysis and Analysis 1 was that 
children were considered DTP-unvaccinated if they were age-
eligible, irrespective of whether they had attended a weighing 
session or not, and vaccination status could change during 
follow-up, so a child could contribute risk time first as DTP-
unvaccinated and then as DTP-vaccinated.)
Analysis 3
In the third analysis, we compared mortality of children accord-
ing to their most recent vaccination status; DTP-vaccinated 
children were compared with children who had received no 
vaccination or live vaccine only (MV, OPV, or MV + OPV) as 
their most recent vaccination.
statistical analyses
The survival of different vaccination groups was compared using 
a Cox proportional hazard model with age as underlying time. 
Thus, age was inherently controlled in this analysis. The WHO 
WAZ was used to assess nutritional status. In analysis 1 in which 
we compared children who had attended weighing sessions and 
been vaccinated or not vaccinated we adjusted the analysis for 
nutritional status (WAZ score). Since we provided almost all 
vaccines, most vaccinations were known from the date of vac-
cination, but a few children were vaccinated elsewhere. To avoid 
survival bias, we used a landmark approach in all analyses (11); 
hence, a child’s vaccination status was only updated from the day 
the information was collected.
studies of the introduction of DTP
Including this study, there are only three studies of the introduc-
tion of DTP, all from Guinea-Bissau (5, 12). We made a meta-
estimate for these studies, since they represent an unusual set of 
circumstances in relation to the discussion of potential biases in 
studies of the non-specific effects of vaccines (13–17). First, in 
all three studies the nutritional status was worse for children not 
vaccinated. Second, we administered nearly all vaccines, so most 
dates of vaccination were known precisely. Third, there were no 
campaigns with other vaccines or micronutrient supplements 
at the time of these studies. Fourth, they represent all the data 
sets available on the introduction of DTP in Guinea-Bissau, so 
reporting bias is not an issue (15).
resUlTs
Of the 890 children aged 6–35 months registered in Bandim in 
June 1981, we were not able to locate the BHP card of 107 (12%) 
children in 2015; most will not have attended an examination, 
but some cards may have been lost. A further 81 had a BHP card, 
but had not attended a weighing session since October 1980, 
had no precise vaccination dates, or were excluded due to other 
considerations (see Figure 1). Hence, 702 children were included 
in the study cohort; the number of deaths and person-years in 
the different vaccine groups was, therefore, limited (Table S1 in 
Supplementary Material).
The temporal distribution of weighing sessions in this 
cohort is shown in Figure 2. As documented in Table S2 in 
Supplementary Material, 82 and 84% received DTP1 and OPV1 
before they reached 3 years of age, the median ages of vaccina-
tion being 633 and 614 days, respectively. It should be noted 
that only 38 and 49% of the children received all three doses of 
DTP and OPV, respectively, before 3 years of age. Due to earlier 
MV campaigns (6, 7), 82% had received MV at a median age of 
348 days. There were 42 deaths between 6 and 35 months of age; 
14 had fever as the main symptom, 13 had diarrhea or diarrhea 
and vomiting, 6 died from measles, 1 had respiratory infection, 
1 was malnourished, 1 had anemia, 1 did not eat, and 5 had no 
information, most likely because the mother/family had moved.
We compared background factors for DTP-vaccinated chil-
dren and children who remained DTP-unvaccinated until at least 
3 years of age (Table 1). The DTP-vaccinated children were far 
more likely to have attended weighing sessions, to have received 
measles vaccine (MV) in the campaigns, or to have received DTP 
at the Mother and Child Clinic before June 1981 (6, 7). There were 
no differences in distribution of the sexes, twins, or ethnic groups.
analysis 1
At the first weighing session after the vaccinations started in June 
1981, the WAZ was much higher for the children who received 
DTP (WAZ −0.83) than for those children who did not receive 
DTP (WAZ −1.17) (Table 1). An increase of one z-score was 
associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 (95% CI = 1.13–1.55)

for being vaccinated at the first weighing session. Compared with 
not being DTP-vaccinated, DTP vaccination at the first weighing 
session was associated with a non-significant mortality hazard 
ratio (aHR) of 2.22 (95% CI = 0.82–6.04) adjusted for WAZ 
(Table 2), the aHR being 7.03 (0.88–56.04) for girls, and 1.28 
(0.38–4.25) for boys (test for interaction p = 0.17).
analysis 2
Including all children in the cohort, following them to 3 years 
of age and allowing children to change status during follow-up 
when new information was collected at a weighing session, hav-
ing received DTP was associated with a non-significant HR of 
1.48 (0.72–3.06) (Table 3). The HR was 2.91 (0.84–10.00) for girls 
and 0.88 (0.34–2.62) for boys.
analysis 3
Children who received DTP (with or without OPV) as the most 
recent vaccination had an HR of 1.77 (0.93–3.38) compared 
with children who had received a live vaccine or no vaccine 
at all and had a HR of 1.90 (0.92–3.94) if compared only with 
children who had received live vaccine only (Table 4). In a 
sensitivity analysis, including also the 47 children whose most 
recent weighing session had been before October 1980, the 
HRs for DTP was 1.89 (1.00–3.55) (Table 4), the HR being 2.76 
(1.07–7.07) for girls, and 1.34 (0.56–3.22) for boys.
Though the group was small, it is worth noting that children who 
received OPV-only had low mortality (Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material), the HR for DTP(±OPV)-vaccinated compared with 
OPV-only vaccinated children was 3.76 (0.89–15.83).
studies of the introduction of DTP
In the three studies of introduction of DTP in rural and urban 
Guinea-Bissau, DTP vaccination was associated with a HR of 
2.14 (1.42–3.23) compared with DTP-unvaccinated children 
(Figure 3). The negative effect was separately significant for girls 
[HR = 2.60 (1.57–4.32)], but not for boys [HR = 1.71 (0.99–2.93)] 
(Table S3 in Supplementary Material) (test for interaction 
p = 0.27).
DiscUssiOn
Although lower mortality was expected for DTP-vaccinated 
children compared with the frail unvaccinated children, DTP 
vaccination was associated with higher mortality, particularly in 
girls.
strength and Weaknesses
The home-visits preceding each of the tri-monthly weighing ses-
sions ensured that we had follow-up information for all children 
and relatively accurate information on the time of movement or 
death. In the initial analyses, we included only children who had 
attended the 3-monthly weighing sessions at least once within 
the last 8–9 months (5). This meant that children mostly living 
outside the area were not included; these children had no access 
to community vaccinations and they lived elsewhere where 
the mortality risk may well have been much higher. We had to 
exclude some children because their card could not be found 
(Figure 1). The excluded groups (Figure 1) did not have high 
mortality so the increased mortality of DTP-vaccinated children 
is not due to exclusion of unvaccinated children with a particu-
larly high mortality. When we increased the power of the study 
by including children only seen before October 1980 (Figure 1), 
 FigUre 3 | Meta-analysis of the three studies of the introduction of diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis. The fixed effects model gave an estimate of 2.14 (1.42–3.23) and

measurement, the HR of 1.48 (0.72–3.06) became 1.52 (0.74–3.15).

the HR estimate for DTP-vaccinated versus DTP-unvaccinated 
as most recent vaccine changed from 1.77 (0.93–3.38) to 1.89 
(1.00–3.55).
The inherent biases in this study are clearly in favor of the 
DTP-vaccinated children (2): first, the DTP vaccine protects 
against three severe diseases. Second, the DTP-unvaccinated 
children were usually children deemed too sick or too weak to be 
vaccinated, as evidenced by the nurse’s notes on the BHP card and 
by the fact that these children had worse nutritional status. Third, 
DTP-unvaccinated children attended the weighing sessions less 
frequently (Table 1) and were, therefore, more likely to be stay-
ing for longer periods in the rural areas where the mortality risk 
was higher (12). Noteworthy, we were able to obtain mortality 
information from these children because their father and other 
relatives stayed in the study area.
WHO experts have argued that the negative effect of DTP 
is exaggerated, because studies have only been conducted 
in situations with herd immunity against pertussis and where 
the benefit of preventing pertussis would not be seen (13). 
However, pertussis was endemic in the 1980s before the roll

out of the vaccination program in Guinea-Bissau, but all three 
studies of the introduction of DTP into urban and rural areas 
of Guinea-Bissau showed excess mortality associated with DTP 
vaccination (5, 12).
comparison With Previous studies  
of DTP and OPV
This study was small (Table S1 in Supplementary Material) and 
many results were not statistically significant; some variability 
was, therefore, also to be expected. Still the results were very 
similar to the previous studies of the introduction of DTP and 
OPV. All three studies have accurate assessment of vaccina-
tion status and prospective follow-up; all three studies have 
found that DTP is associated with an increase in all-cause 
mortality (3). A previous meta-analysis suggested twofold 
higher mortality for DTP-vaccinated children (3). However, 
this is probably an underestimation of the “true” effect since 
the unvaccinated group is usually affected by various nega-
tive health selection biases, including frailty bias. In the best 
studies, with no selection bias or good control for frailty bias, 
DTP has been associated with four to five times higher mortal-
ity (2, 5).
As in this study, we have previously found excess female 
mortality after DTP vaccination (4). In our previous meta-
analysis, we compared DTP-vaccinated females with DTP-
unvaccinated, but BCG-vaccinated females, and DTP was 
associated with an HR of 2.54 (1.68–3.86). In the three studies 
of the introduction of DTP very few of the DTP-unvaccinated 
had received BCG. Hence, DTP seems to have a marked nega-
tive effect for females irrespective of whether one compares 
DTP-vaccinated girls with totally unvaccinated or with BCG-
vaccinated girls.
There have been few studies of OPV administered alone (5). 
 
It is, therefore, worth noting that the small number of chil 
dren 
who received OPV only had lower mortality than DTP-vaccinated 
children in this study (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), 
although the difference was not statistically significant. We have 
recently been able to document marked beneficial effects of OPV 
on all-cause mortality in both randomized trials and in natural 
experiments with OPV campaigns (18, 19).
interpretation
Various WHO committees have previously reviewed the non-
specific effects of vaccines and have dismissed the possibility 
that DTP could have negative effects, and have suggested that the 
negative effect of DTP is likely to be explained by uncontrolled 
confounding or bias (13–17). Recently, the Strategic Advisory 
Group of Experts on Immunization sponsored a review of the 
potential non-specific effects of BCG, DTP, and MV (15, 16). 
Though it was noted that the majority of studies (7/10) showed a 
deleterious effect of DTP, the evidence was considered inconsist-
ent because two studies showed a beneficial effect. Furthermore, 
the review invoked “a high risk of bias” for all the observational 
studies (17).
However, it is important to consider the direction of bias. All 
documented biases favor the vaccinated group because vaccination 
is usually delayed in unhealthy children, and DTP-unvaccinated 
children should, therefore, have a higher mortality than vacci-
nated children (2, 3). The WHO review mentioned four potential 
biases, which would favor the unvaccinated group (15). First, sick 
children might come more often to a health center for consulta-
tion and, therefore, be more likely to receive DTP, since WHO 
has recommended vaccination of sick children; this bias was 
clearly not relevant in Guinea-Bissau, where neither nurses nor 
mothers thought that a sick child should be vaccinated. Second, 
starting follow-up from a survey sometime after the actual DTP 
vaccinations had been administered, as would often happen in a 
setting, where vaccination information is collected with intervals, 
could potentially mean that frail children in the unvaccinated 
group had already died, and that the DTP-vaccinated children, 
therefore, had an “unnaturally” high mortality (15). The one 
study testing this found no evidence for such a bias (20) and 
more importantly, several studies, including all three studies of 
the introduction of DTP in Guinea-Bissau, started observation at 
the date of vaccination for almost all children and found strong 
negative effects. Hence, this bias was not relevant in the present 
study. Third, censoring follow-up at subsequent MV would 
remove some of the best children from the DTP-vaccinated 
group and, therefore, gives higher mortality in the DTP group 
(15). Again, the studies that have tested this potential bias have 
not found evidence for such a bias (21) but, more importantly, 
several studies—like the present one—did not censor for MV 
and found equally strong negative effects for DTP (2). Hence, 
this bias was not relevant in this study. Fourth, it has been dis-
cussed whether a bias in reporting could have played a role (15). 
The observation of increased mortality after DTP was reported 
more than 15 years ago (22), and has not been contradicted by a 
properly conducted prospective study. In contrast, several other 
groups have reported that DTP was associated with increased 
overall mortality (23–25) or higher female than male mortality 
 
(23, 26–28). Hence, reporting bias is a very unlikely explanation. 
We have now reported all the possible data sets from when DTP 
was introduced in both urban and rural areas of Guinea-Bissau 
(5, 12); all showed a negative effect of DTP vaccination. Hence, 
reporting bias is not relevant in relation to the studies of the intro-
duction of DTP from Guinea-Bissau. Therefore, the three studies 
of the introduction of DTP from Guinea-Bissau (5, 12) are not 
affected by the theoretical biases used to recommend caution in 
the interpretation of observational studies suggesting deleterious 
effects from DTP (15–17).
The specific immunological mechanisms explaining why 
DTP and OPV have NSEs have not yet been identified. However, 
there is an increasing evidence that live vaccines (BCG, Vaccinia) 
induce innate immune training producing stronger pro-
inflammatory responses which may lead to protection against 
unrelated infections (29, 30). In contrast, studies of non-live 
vaccine have suggested that they may induce tolerance which 
could enhance the susceptibility to unrelated infections (31). The 
pattern of worse effects for females than for males have turned 
out to be systematic for several non-live vaccines, including DTP 
(4, 26), inactivated polio vaccine (32), hepatitis B vaccine (33), 
pentavalent vaccine (34), and RTS,S malaria vaccine (35). This 
pattern has not been studied from an immunological perspective 
and an explanation has still to be found.

implications and conclusion
Our data clearly showed that DTP vaccinations were delayed 
in unhealthy children. Hence, healthier children received DTP 
first, and DTP-unvaccinated children should, therefore, have 
had a higher mortality rate. Despite this, DTP was associated 
with increased child mortality, particularly for girls. All three 
studies of the introduction of DTP vaccine found negative 
effects which are different from what should have been expected 
due to the disease-preventive effects of the vaccine and the 
inherent biases favoring vaccinated children (5, 12). The results 
are also in stark contrast to the studies of the introduction of 
measles vaccine, which uniformly show very strong mortality 
reductions (6, 7, 15). Hence, the studies of the introduction of 
DTP constitute a clear danger signal that DTP may substantially 
increase all-cause mortality.
Adding to the danger signal, DTP is associated with increased 
female mortality relative to male mortality in all available 
studies. Girls did not have higher mortality than boys in the 
pre-vaccination era in West Africa (2). Hence, there is a need for 
further research to assess the overall mortality effect of DTP and 
how the negative effects of DTP can be removed or modified. 
For example, co-administration of BCG and DTP may reduce 
the negative effect of DTP (21). Randomized trials have also 
shown that MV or BCG administered shortly after DTP may 
reduce the negative effect of DTP and lower mortality (2). Such 
alternative immunization strategies should be further tested in 
randomized trials.
Given the threat from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis 
and the less-effective acellular pertussis vaccine used in many 
countries, it is understandable that there has been reluctance in 
accepting that DTP could have negative effects for overall health 
in low-income countries. However, the studies from low-income 
countries have been consistent in showing deleterious effect of 
DTP (3); furthermore, the first studies are now showing that 
non-live and live vaccines have differential NSEs on hospital 
admissions for infectious diseases in high-income countries 
 
(36, 37). Hence, it would seem to be high time to settle whether 
DTP has negative effects on overall child health and if it has nega-
tive effects to explore whether alternative vaccination schedules 
could remove the problem.
In the current global immunization system, the coverage for 
the third dose of DTP (DTP3) is used as the main performance 
indicator for national immunization programs. This will clearly 
lead to an emphasis on increasing the coverage for DTP3 (1) 
more than the coverage for other vaccines. Given that all studies, 
including the present one, suggest that DTP is associated with 
increased female mortality, this is really an illogical position. We 
need to use program performance indicators which are positively 
associated with better child survival.

The study of nutritional status was planned between the SAREC 
(Swedish Agency for Research Collaboration with Developing 
Countries) and the Ministry of Health in Guinea-Bissau. There 
were no ethical committees for approval of health research at the 
time of the study. The study was explained to the population in 
community meetings organized by the local committee and the 
researchers prior to initiation of data collection. Consent was not 
sought from individual mothers, since the project implemented 
intended national policies for nutritional surveillance and 
immunization.
