Introduction: Data on the safety of waterbirth in the United States are lacking.
Methods: We used data from the Midwives Alliance of North America Statistics Project, birth years 2004 to 2009. We compared outcomes of
neonates born underwater waterbirth (n = 6534), neonates not born underwater nonwaterbirth (n = 10,290), and neonates whose mothers
intended a waterbirth but did not have one intended waterbirth (n = 1573). Neonatal outcomes included a 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7,
neonatal hospital transfer, and hospitalization or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission in the first 6 weeks. Maternal outcomes included
genital tract trauma, postpartum hospital transfer, and hospitalization or infection (uterine, endometrial, perineal) in the first 6 weeks. We used
logistic regression for all analyses, controlling for primiparity.
Results: Waterbirth neonates experienced fewer negative outcomes than nonwaterbirth neonates: the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for hospital trans-
fer was 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.68; P �.001); the aOR for infant hospitalization in the first 6 weeks was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-0.88;
P � .001); and the aOR for NICU admission was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.46-0.76; P � .001). By comparison, neonates in the intended waterbirth group
experienced more negative outcomes than the nonwaterbirth group, although only 5-minute Apgar score was significant (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI,
1.40-2.93; P � 0001). For women, waterbirth (compared to nonwaterbirth) was associated with fewer postpartum transfers (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI,
0.50-0.84; P = .001) and hospitalizations in the first 6 weeks (aOR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.87; P � 0.001) but with an increased odds of genital tract
trauma (aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18; P = .002). Waterbirth was not associated with maternal infection. Women in the intended waterbirth group
had increased odds for all maternal outcomes compared to women in the nonwaterbirth group, although only genital tract trauma was significant
(aOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.49-1.87; P � .001).
Discussion: Waterbirth confers no additional risk to neonates; however, waterbirth may be associated with increased risk of genital tract trauma
for women.

INTRODUCTION
Waterbirth is highly controversial in the United States,1–8
despite being an accepted practice in other high-resource
nations.9–12 Proponents of waterbirth cite anthropological ev-
idence from Odent and Tjarkovsky regarding childbearing
traditions that include immersion13,14; the maternal benefits
of laboring in water, such as pain relief and reduced stress
on tissues secondary to buoyancy15,16; the potential benefits
to a neonate of being born into a warm, liquid environment
similar to the amniotic fluid17; and a series of studies, mostly
small and observational, suggesting no adverse effects for ei-
ther the laboring woman or the neonate.18,19 By contrast, in
the spring of 2014, the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Academy of Pedi-
atrics (AAP) jointly issued clinical recommendations advising
strongly against allowing women to labor in water after the
first stage of labor is complete.3
Waterbirth is generally defined as a neonate being in-
tentionally born underwater. Provided that the neonate is

promptly brought to the surface, it is thought that the diving
reflex, which mechanically blocks the airway of submerged
infants (although not older children or adults), will pre-
vent the newborn from aspirating the water.20 The category
waterbirth does not include women who labor in water but
give birth to their newborn into air. Laboring in water is con-
sidered safe; the current question in the literature is whether
waterbirth is safe.3
Published reports of outcomes following waterbirth in the
United States currently consist solely of case series1,2,4,5,21–24
rather than studies with robust designs and adequate power.
However, there are several cohort studies from Europe
describing waterbirth outcomes,25–35 nicely summarized by
Nutter et al in a recent review.19 The results of these studies
collectively suggest that waterbirth is not associated with
an increased risk of morbidity for the newborn (eg, low
Apgar score, neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] admission,
neonatal injury, or death), although small sample sizes hinder
comparisons for all but the most common events.18,19 Regard-
ing maternal outcomes, previous literature suggests women
do not experience an increase in perineal trauma, infection,
or hemorrhage.18,19 Nonetheless, it can be argued that both
the US population and US health care system are unique, and
thus results from Europe might not be generalizable to the

 ✦ Using data collected from the Midwives Alliance of North America Statistics Project (MANA Stats 2004-2009), this study
reports waterbirth outcomes for a large sample of midwife-attended births occurring at home and in birth centers in the
United States (N = 18,343 women); 35% of the women (n = 6521 women; 13 sets of twins) had a waterbirth.
✦ Neonates of women who had a waterbirth were less likely to experience a low 5-minute Apgar score, neonatal transfer to the
hospital, and hospitalization or neonatal intensive care unit admission in the first 6 weeks when compared to nonwaterbirth
neonates.
✦ For women, waterbirth was associated with decreased odds of hospitalization, either immediately postpartum or within
the first 6 weeks, but increased odds of genital tract trauma.
✦ Waterbirth was not associated with increased risk of maternal infection.
United States. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to re-
port waterbirth outcomes from a large sample of midwife-
led births occurring at home and in birth centers in the
United States.
METHODS
Data Source and Sample Description
The data for this study come from the Midwives Alliance
of North America Statistics Project, commonly referred to
as MANA Stats.36 MANA Stats is an ongoing, Web-based
data collection effort designed to capture complete courses
of care from the medical records of women who have had
midwife-led pregnancies and births. Any midwife, regardless
of birth setting, is eligible to contribute data. However, in
practice, most MANA Stats records are for planned home or
planned birth center births (97.6% for the years 2004-2009)
attended by certified professional midwives (CPMs) in the
United States. Of the births in the 2004 to 2009 MANA Stats
dataset, 73% of the births were attended by CPMs.36
A midwife who is a MANA Stats contributor enters data
on all women in her care from the first prenatal visit through
the final visit, which is usually at 6 weeks postpartum.
Midwives are required to preregister or log patients into the
MANA Stats system early in care, before the outcome of the
pregnancy is known. This prospective logging helps to ensure
that all births from participating midwives are captured,
regardless of outcome, thus reducing selection bias in the
sample.
Women give informed consent allowing their deidentified
data to be included in MANA Stats, and the consent includes
explicit permission for the data to be used for research. Should
a woman decline consent, her data are not included, but this
decision to decline consent would occur early in pregnancy
and thus could not be affected by pregnancy outcome. In prac-
tice, very few women decline this consent; based on practice
data reported by midwives, we estimate that MANA Stats cap-
tures 97% of births attended by midwife contributors.36 The
high rate of maternal participation in this population is not
unique to the MANA Stats dataset; it has also been reported
in other studies enrolling women planning home and birth
center births.37,38
The institutional review board at Oregon State University
approved this analysis, which uses MANA Stats data for births
that occurred between 2004 and 2009. Evidence of reliabil-
ity and validity of the MANA Stats 2004 to 2009 dataset,
as well as detailed data collection protocols, is presented
elsewhere.36
We limited our sample to births that were planned home
births or planned birth center births at the onset of labor
wherein the neonate was actually born in the intended set-
ting (ie, no intrapartum transfer to a hospital occurred). Thus,
excluded from the sample were the data from women who
planned a hospital birth and from those for whom a hospital
birth was not planned but occurred following an intrapartum
transfer (Figure 1).
These cases were excluded for 2 reasons. First, during the
research years (2004-2009), very few hospitals in the United
States offered the option of giving birth underwater.39 Second,
hospital births are almost always the most complicated preg-
nancies and labors in the MANA Stats database; the major-
ity of contributors to the project specialize in home or birth
center birth and transfer care to hospitals only when com-
plications arise.40 Thus, including women with more compli-
cated pregnancies or labors resulting in the transfer of care to
a hospital-based provider, either before or during labor, com-
bined with the reduced likelihood of encountering the expo-
sure, would have introduced bias in the direction of making
waterbirth appear safer relative to nonwaterbirth. Mother–
newborn dyads who transferred to the hospital during the
postpartum period were retained in the sample because, if
in fact waterbirth itself introduces risk (eg, infection, respi-
ratory distress), we would expect to see more women and
newborns with immediate postpartum newborn or maternal
complications requiring transfer and possible hospitalization
following waterbirth. We also excluded 12 singleton pregnan-
cies for which the waterbirth variable was missing. Apply-
ing these inclusion criteria resulted in a sample size of 18,397
neonates (N = 18,343 pregnancies), as shown in Figure 1.
Variables
The main exposure, waterbirth, was collected as a 3-level cat-
egorical variable. To the question “Baby born underwater?”
the midwife had 3 answer options: “no”; “yes”; or “intended,
but not born underwater.” Throughout this article, we refer
to these categories as nonwaterbirth, waterbirth, and intended
waterbirth, respectively.

Begins with all records entered into MANA Stats for birth years 2004 to 2009. Women who changed providers (ie, stopped receiving care from the
midwife filling out the data form) prior to the onset of labor are excluded. Some of these women may be included as separate records if they changed
providers to another MANA Stats contributor; however, many developed a complication requiring maternity specialty care and therefore would not
be included. Also excluded are women who did not give birth at home or at a birth center, and mother—fetus dyads if the fetus died prior to birth.
All numbers are counts of singleton pregnancies, unless otherwise indicated.

Neonatal outcomes included a 5-minute Apgar score of
less than 7 (yes/no), postpartum transfer to the hospital for a
newborn indication (referred to hereafter as neonatal trans-
fer, yes/no), any infant admission to the hospital during the
first 6 weeks of life (yes/no), and any NICU admission during
the first 6 weeks of life (yes/no). Although we knew the num-
ber of events would be small based on our previous work with
this dataset,33 we also included early (prior to 7 completed
days of life) and late (at least 7 completed days of life, but not
yet 28) neonatal deaths as end points.
Maternal outcomes included postpartum reproductive
tract infection at any time during the first 6 weeks postpar-
tum (presence of: uterine infection, urinary tract infection, or
delayed perineal healing/infection), postpartum transfer for
a maternal indication (referred to hereafter as postpartum
transfer; yes/no), any maternal admission to the hospital dur-
ing the first 6 weeks postpartum (yes/no), and genital tract
trauma. The degree of genital tract trauma was evaluated first
as a simple dichotomous variable and then further as a mul-
tilevel nominal variable with the following categories: none,
episiotomy only, first- or second-degree perineal only, third-
or fourth-degree perineal only, mild labial only, more severe
labial only (defined on the data collection form as required re-
pair), other trauma requiring repair, trauma at multiple sites,
and trauma not otherwise specified. The latter category con-
sisted of women for whom the midwife indicated that, yes,
there was trauma, but then did not answer the follow-up ques-
tions regarding location and severity.
For the neonatal and postpartum transfers, midwives were
able to indicate multiple indications for transfer. It is there-
fore possible that one mother–newborn dyad could have ex-
perienced both a postpartum transfer and a neonatal transfer
if, for example, the midwife indicated both “extensive lacera-
tion repair requiring anesthesia” and “evaluation of congenital
anomalies” as reasons for transfer.
Analysis
We used logistic regression to analyze all dichotomous out-
comes (5-minute Apgar score of �7, neonatal transfer, NICU
admission, infant hospitalization in the first 6 weeks, post-
partum transfer, postpartum reproductive tract infection,

 maternal hospitalization in the first 6 weeks, dichotomized
trauma). Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) methodology41,42
was used to determine potential confounders. Directed acyclic
graphs are a type of causal model that allow the researcher to
determine a complete set of potential confounders that maxi-
mizes use of available data while simultaneously reducing bias
that would result from adjusting for highly collinear covari-
ables. The DAG/causal model that we drew for this analysis is
available from the authors on request; as a result of the DAG
analysis, we controlled for primiparity in all models.
The 3-level waterbirth exposure variable was entered into
the models as a nominal variable, with nonwaterbirth as the
reference category. Our results are thus presented as adjusted
odds of a given outcome for waterbirth compared to nonwa-
terbirth and, separately, adjusted odds of a given outcome for
intended waterbirth compared to nonwaterbirth.
As expected, cell counts were very low for the neona-
tal death outcomes. Thus, for these outcomes we report the
raw data but did not calculate adjusted odds ratios and corre-
sponding 95% confidence limits.
For the multilevel nominal outcome (genital tract
trauma), we used multinomial (ie, not ordered) logistic
regression and controlled for primiparity. No trauma was the
reference category. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0.0.1
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and S-Plus Version 8.1 (Tibco
Spotfire, Seattle, WA).
RESULTS
We report results from 18,343 births, which included 18,397
neonates (see Figure 1). Of these, 10,252 women (10,290
neonates) were in the nonwaterbirth group, 6521 women
(6534 neonates) were in the waterbirth group, and 1570
women (1573 neonates) were in the intended waterbirth
group. Demographics of the women in this sample are shown
in Table 1. Briefly, the majority were white, married, and col-
lege educated. The mean age at conception was 29.9 years
(standard deviation 5.3). Our sample does include larger
proportions of both Amish/Mennonite (6.0%) and grand-
multiparous women (8.5%), relative to the US population as
a whole; as expected, there is a large overlap between these 2
groups. Additionally of note, 968 women had vaginal births
after cesarean (VBACs), 134 gave birth to a neonate in breech
presentation, and 54 women had twins. Because our sample
was limited to those women who gave birth at home or in a
birth center, all of these were vaginal births.
Neonatal Outcomes
Neonates born underwater (waterbirths) fared better than
their nonwaterbirth counterparts on all neonatal outcome
measures, when controlling for primiparity (Table 2). The ad-
justed odds ratio (aOR) for neonatal transfer to the hospital,
for waterbirth neonates compared to nonwaterbirth neonates,
was 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.68; P � .001).
The aOR for NICU admission during the first 6 weeks was
0.59 (95% CI, 0.46-0.76; P � .001); the aOR for any hospital
admission during the first 6 weeks was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-
0.88; P � .001) (Table 2). There was no evidence of 5-minute
Apgar scores below 7 being more common in the waterbirth
group (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65-1.19; P = .42).
By contrast, neonates whose mothers intended a water-
birth but did not have one (intended waterbirths) fared worse
than neonates whose mothers had not planned to give birth in
the water. Neonates in the intended waterbirth category had a
102% increase in the odds of a 5-minute Apgar score of less
than 7 (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI,1.40-2.93; P � 0.001).
Although the number of events was too small for firm
conclusions, we found no evidence of increased neonatal
deaths (early or late) among neonates in the waterbirth group.
There were 9 deaths (6 early, 3 late) in the nonwaterbirth
comparison group; these were attributed to hypoxia, congen-
ital anomalies, chorioamnionitis, cord accidents (3), and un-
known causes (3). Among the waterbirth group, there were
3 neonatal deaths (2 early, one late), attributed to hypoxic
ischemic encephalopathy, congestive heart failure, and un-
known causes. In the intended waterbirth group, there were
also 3 neonatal deaths (2 early, one late), attributed to placen-
tal abruption, shoulder dystocia with compressed cord, and
hypoxia (Table 2).
Maternal Outcomes
Women who completed the second stage while immersed in
water (waterbirths) had a 35% reduction in odds of postpar-
tum transfer (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84; P = .001) and a
28% reduction in odds of maternal hospitalization in the first
6 weeks (aOR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.87; P �.001) (Table 3). By
contrast, women who had a waterbirth also had an 11% in-
crease in odds of experiencing any genital tract trauma (aOR,
1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18; P = .002). When categories based
on trauma location and severity were assessed, however, there
was no discernible pattern between the women in the 3 co-
horts (Table 4). Women who planned a waterbirth but did not
have one (intended waterbirths) experienced substantially in-
creased odds of any genital tract trauma (aOR, 1.67; 95% CI,
1.49-1.87; P � .001) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Main Findings and Interpretation
This retrospective cohort study is the largest study on this
topic to date and one of the first to focus on a US population.
We found that waterbirth was not associated with an increased
risk of 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7, immediate neona-
tal transfer of care to a hospital, any neonatal hospitalization
in the first 6 weeks, or NICU admission in the first 6 weeks.
For women, we found that waterbirth was associated with re-
duced risk of both immediate postpartum transfer of care to a
hospital and any maternal hospitalization in the first 6 weeks.
However, waterbirth was associated in our data with an in-
creased risk of genital tract trauma. We found no evidence of
an association between waterbirth and uterine, endometrial,
or perineal infection.
A recent Cochrane review on waterbirth stated that: “Im-
mersion during the 2nd stage of labour needs further investi-
gation, but at present there is no clear evidence to support or
not to support a woman’s decision to give birth in water.”18

publications, focused exclusively on results of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), of which there are only a few compar-
ing waterbirth to nonwaterbirth43,44—and these were small
and underpowered. Another problem inherent in these stud-
ies, as well as in any large, future, hypothetical RCTs, is that
women in the waterbirth group whose labors become com-
plicated are often directed to discontinue immersion,45,46 but
women randomized to nonwaterbirth would not suddenly be
asked to get in the water. This one-way noncompliance with
the assigned intervention group could introduce differential
misclassification bias, making interpretation of intention-to-
treat results problematic. This bias is also apparent in obser-
vational studies: women who develop complications get out of
the tub, but rarely do women who never intended a waterbirth
suddenly decide to get in. To our knowledge, we are the first
to address this issue by reporting separately on the intended
waterbirth group.
These methodologic issues, taken together, led the
Cochrane review’s authors to state unprecedentedly (the
Cochrane Group is well known for their randomized trial
preference) that: “Large audits and cohort studies should be
undertaken in units which provide a pool facility to provide
evidence for practice.”18 In this article, we have presented re-
sults from just such a large cohort study: 18,397 neonates, 35%
(n = 6534) of who were born underwater. Furthermore, this is
the first waterbirth study to report results for a US population.
We found that neonates born underwater were not at in-
creased risk of adverse outcomes; on the contrary, they fared
better than their nonwaterbirth counterparts on all outcomes.
Rather than being a true benefit of waterbirth, however, this
finding is likely secondary to the misclassification bias de-
scribed above: outcomes in the intended waterbirth group
were uniformly worse than those observed in the (planned)
nonwaterbirth group. Taken together, these findings suggest

gCauses of death: 1) hypoxia (neonate never attempted to breathe; life support removed after 2 days; no autopsy); 2) patent ductus arteriosis was official cause but no autopsy;
3) prelabor brain damage (tight nuchal cord; neonate never attempted to breathe; life support removed after 2 days; no autopsy but brain damage was receiving obstetrician’s
diagnosis); 4) acute chorioamnionitis (autopsy-confirmed); 5) cord rupture/hemorrhage (autopsy-confirmed); and 6) unknown (no autopsy; official cause was cardiac
failure).
hCauses of death: 1) hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging on day 4; life support subsequently removed); and 2) congestive heart

that, when potential complications arose during labor, the at-
tending midwife recommended that the woman discontinue
water immersion, perhaps to allow for closer monitoring of
fetal heart tones or to visualize fetal scalp color, etc. Thus,
the intended waterbirth category reflects a cohort of women
who were experiencing more complicated labors or births. It
is not surprising that the outcomes for women and neonates in
the intended waterbirth category were worse. Following, it is
also not surprising that the neonates of women who remained
in the tub or pool (the waterbirth group) had better out-
comes: all of the nonstraightforward (ie, potentially elevated
risk) mother–newborn dyads had been asked to get out of the
tub. The substantially improved outcomes observed among
neonates who were born underwater is almost certainly an
artifact of this unavoidable but appropriate clinical manage-
ment. The nonwaterbirth comparison (reference) group con-
sists of women who never wanted (or who did not have access
to) waterbirth. It seems likely that some of these women would
have developed complications during labor that would have
led to discontinuing immersion, had they been laboring in

water. Therefore, the nonwaterbirth reference group contains
both women who could have had waterbirths and those whose
labors were more complicated, and who therefore would have
been asked to get out of the tub; for women who plan water-
births, these 2 exposure groups have been separated into wa-
terbirth and intended waterbirth.
Nonetheless, the neonates in the waterbirth group were
born underwater, and we found no evidence of any sub-
sequent increased risk for any adverse neonatal outcome.
Safety of waterbirth (as opposed to merely laboring in wa-
ter) is currently the issue under heaviest scrutiny in the recent
ACOG/AAP guidelines,3 as well as the evidence gap identi-
fied by the authors of the Cochrane Review.18 Based on the
strength of evidence presented here, we cannot conclude that
waterbirth is beneficial; however, based on our results, wa-
terbirth certainly is not harmful to the neonate. Our findings
also suggest that US midwives attending home and birth cen-
ter births on the whole are appropriately managing women as
they labor and birth in water.
Our newborn morbidity results are consistent not only
with those in the Cochrane review18 but also with those
of most other published observational studies, which al-
most universally report no adverse outcomes for waterbirth
neonates.26–35,46,47 By contrast, Carpenter et al48 reported an
increase in respiratory distress symptoms among waterbirth
neonates; however, the sample size was small (N = 38), and
the authors reflect that ascertainment bias may have played
a prominent role. Hawkins,49 in a small (N = 32), non-
randomized cohort study, reported more neonatal infections
(and therefore greater morbidity) in the waterbirth group, al-
though during the study period a lack of adherence to tub-
cleaning protocols required intervention by the hospital’s in-
fection control team, likely affecting the study’s results. All
other published reports of increased neonatal morbidity fol-
lowing waterbirth are case reports or case series without con-
trol groups.1,14,21–24,45,50–57
We lacked sufficient power to calculate reliable adjusted
odds ratios for early and late neonatal deaths. Nonetheless,
there was no evidence of elevated mortality among the wa-
terbirth group, a finding that is consistent with our morbidity
results as well as with those published by others.26,58 Further-
more, of the 3 neonatal deaths in the waterbirth group, none
were attributed to causes that might stem from the waterbirth
(ie, no drowning, no cord avulsion, no respiratory distress).
Women in our sample who gave birth while immersed in
water had no increased risk of adverse outcomes except for
genital tract trauma: they experienced an 11% increase in odds
of genital tract trauma, although without a discernible pattern
as to trauma location and severity. Cortes et al59 also reported
an increased risk of perineal trauma for women who gave
birth while immersed in water. The Cortes study, however,
contradicts the bulk of the literature, which has reported re-
duced risk of genital tract trauma, or no change in risk, among
women who had a waterbirth.26–28,32–34,44,46,47,60 Because ours
is the first large cohort study to report results in a US popu-
lation, and the largest cohort study to date, our finding of in-
creased risk of maternal genital tract trauma requires further
investigation. In the meantime, clinicians should discuss the
possible risk of genital tract trauma as part of shared decision
making and the informed consent process around waterbirth.
Other studies have also reported no increased risk
of infection among women who have waterbirths,26,29,32,61

although one study found an elevated risk.35 In our study, we
found no association between waterbirth and maternal per-
ineal, uterine, or endometrial infection.
Women in the intended waterbirth category had in-
creased odds of all adverse outcomes, although only genital
tract trauma was statistically significant. As discussed above,
this finding could be an artifact of the misclassification
bias wherein women experiencing complicated labors were
asked to discontinue water immersion. Alternatively, perhaps
midwives attempted to speed the second stage in cases of fetal
distress by cutting an episiotomy or allowing/encouraging
tearing by verbally coaching a woman to continue to push,
or push harder, in the final moments of birth. Alternatively,
some underlying condition or risk factor (eg, smoking or
poor nutrition) that predisposes to fetal complications could
also place the woman at risk for reduced tissue integrity.62
Strengths and Limitations
This research uses data from the MANA Stats Project, birth
years 2004 to 2009. Although this dataset has many strengths,
including evidence of reliability and validity, data collection
procedures that preclude a midwife from entering data only
from births with good outcomes, a large sample size, ex-
tremely high participation by women, and large numbers of
covariables,36 it does have limitations. Chief among these
is the fact that data are collected by a voluntary sample of
midwives. We previously estimated that approximately 30%
of midwives attending home or birth center births in the
United States contribute data,36 and it is certainly possible that
contributing midwives are not representative of all midwives
attending US home and birth center births. We cannot predict
how this would affect our results on waterbirth.
Additionally, our results are based on women who gave
birth at home or in a birth center. These women likely are not
representative of the US childbearing population as a whole.
Additionally, they by definition gave birth with minimal med-
ical intervention, which also is not the norm for US women,
for whom the majority of births occur in the hospital under
biomedical management.63,64 However, because the few US
hospitals that do offer birth tubs typically prohibit their use by
higher risk women and by women who utilize epidural anal-
gesia or other ongoing interventions,28 and because even in
hospitals the vast majority of laboring women are low-risk at
the onset of labor, it seems reasonable that our results could
be applied in US hospital settings where waterbirth is offered.
CONCLUSION
This study is the largest cohort study to date on waterbirth,
the first large study from the United States, and the first to re-
port separately on outcomes for mother–newborn dyads who
did not complete a planned waterbirth because of risk factors
that arose in the intrapartum period. Our results indicate that
waterbirth does not confer an increased risk of morbidity or
mortality for the newborn, but women completing the second
stage immersed in water may experience more genital tract
trauma. Our results are congruent with findings from studies
in other settings, and contrary to the recently published
ACOG/AAP clinical guidelines, suggest that waterbirth is a
reasonably safe option for use in low-risk, low-intervention
