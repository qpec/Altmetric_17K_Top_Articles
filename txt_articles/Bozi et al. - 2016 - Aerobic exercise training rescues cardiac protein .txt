Abstract
Cardiac endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through accumulation of misfolded proteins plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular diseases. In an
attempt to reestablish ER homoeostasis, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. However, if ER stress persists, sustained UPR acti-
vation leads to apoptosis. There is no available therapy for ER stress relief. Considering that aerobic exercise training (AET) attenuates oxidative
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium imbalance, it may be a potential strategy to reestablish cardiac ER homoeostasis. We test the
hypothesis that AET would attenuate impaired cardiac ER stress after myocardial infarction (MI). Wistar rats underwent to either MI or sham
surgeries. Four weeks later, rats underwent to 8 weeks of moderate-intensity AET. Myocardial infarction rats displayed cardiac dysfunction and
lung oedema, suggesting heart failure. Cardiac dysfunction in MI rats was paralleled by increased protein levels of UPR markers (GRP78, DER-
LIN-1 and CHOP), accumulation of misfolded and polyubiquitinated proteins, and reduced chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity. These results
suggest an impaired cardiac protein quality control. Aerobic exercise training improved exercise capacity and cardiac function of MI animals.
Interestingly, AET blunted MI-induced ER stress by reducing protein levels of UPR markers, and accumulation of both misfolded and polyu-
biquinated proteins, which was associated with restored proteasome activity. Taken together, our study provide evidence for AET attenuation of
ER stress through the reestablishment of cardiac protein quality control, which contributes to better cardiac function in post-MI heart failure
rats. These results reinforce the importance of AET as primary non-pharmacological therapy to cardiovascular disease.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of morbidity and mortal-
ity worldwide [1]. The mechanisms involved in pathogenesis and pro-
gression of cardiovascular diseases include renin angiotensin and
sympathetic systems hyperactivation, reduced mitochondrial function
and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, calcium imbalance and
increased reactive oxygen species production in hearts of patients
and animal models of cardiovascular diseases [2–5]. Such maladap-
tations disrupt the proper protein folding leading to accumulation of
misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which intensifies
cardiomyocyte and heart dysfunctions [6, 7]. This condition referred
as ER stress, triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Initially,
UPR inhibits protein synthesis and increases both ER protein folding
and degradation capacities, making an effort to reestablish the ER
homoeostasis [6]. However, if the ER stress persists, prolonged UPR
activation leads to apoptotic cell death [6]. Although progression
towards apoptotic phase of UPR seems to contribute to onset of heart
failure, there are no pharmacological or non-pharmacological strate-
gies available to counteract cardiac ER stress.
Aerobic exercise training (AET) is an efficient adjuvant therapy for
prevention and treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases,
since it improves exercise capacity, cardiac function and attenuates
cardiac remodelling [8–10]. In the last years, our lab has demon-
strated in heart failure animal models that AET promotes a broad
range of cardiac beneficial effects, such as attenuation of calcium
imbalance, renin angiotensin and sympathetic systems activation,
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress [2, 3, 11], being a

 potential therapeutic tool to attenuate ER stress. In fact, AET attenu-
ates ER stress in hepatic and adipose tissues of obese rats [12]. How-
ever, no information is provided about the impact of AET on ER
stress in cardiovascular diseases.
In this study, we tested whether AET would reduce cardiac ER
stress and UPR activation leading to improved protein quality control
and cardiac function in post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure
rats.
Materials and methods
Detailed methods are available in Data S1.
Results
Improved cardiac function by AET in post-MI
heart failure rats is associated with attenuation
of cardiac ER stress
To verify whether AET would blunt MI-induced ER stress and reestab-
lish cardiac contractility, we evaluated protein levels of key ER stress
markers, cardiac function and exercise tolerance in untrained and
trained MI rats. Sham-operated rats were considered as control
healthy group.
Myocardial infarction rats (12 weeks after MI surgery) showed
symptoms of heart failure, such as lung oedema, LV remodelling and
dysfunction (Fig. 1A and Table S1 and S2) despite no differences
were observed in exercise capacity between Sham and MI sedentary
animals (Fig. 1B). The LV dysfunction observed in MI rats was paral-
leled by increased ER protein levels of glucose-regulated protein 78
(GRP78), DERLIN-1 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (Fig. 1C,
D, F, and G). However, no differences were observed in Valosin-con-
taining protein (VCP) protein levels (Fig. 1E and G) among groups.
Together, these data demonstrate that MI leads to heart failure and
ER stress.
Eight weeks of AET (from 4th to 12th weeks after MI)
increased exercise capacity and attenuated LV dysfunction (Fig. 1A
and B) with no impact on lung oedema, heart-to-bw ratio and MI
extension (Table S1). Indeed, AET blunted ER stress by attenuating
protein levels of GRP78, CHOP and DERLIN-1 (Fig. 1C, D, F and
G). Of interest, a significant negative correlation between protein
levels of ER stress markers and LV fractional shortening (Fig. 1H)
further suggests that AET-induced improved cardiac function was
related to attenuated ER stress in MI rats. The impact of AET on
ER stress markers was specific for MI exercised group, since AET
in Sham animals displayed no effects on GRP78, VCP and CHOP
protein levels with a slight increase in DERLIN-1 (13%) mainly
because of ER protein turnorver induced by a AET (Fig. S1). These
findings corroborate previous findings that AET failed to induce any
changes on cardiac protein levels of ER stress markers in healthy
rodents [13].
AET-induced attenuation of cardiac ER stress is
related to reestablishment of cardiac protein
quality control
As we observed increased levels of DERLIN-1 in MI rats, a protein
involved in ER-associated protein degradation, we further investigated
whether cardiac protein quality control would be impaired in MI rats
and returned to sham levels by AET. To test this hypothesis, we evalu-
ated several steps involved in cardiac protein quality control, such as
misfolded and polyubiquitinated protein levels and chymotrypsin-like
proteasome activity in all groups studied.
Hearts of MI rats displayed accumulated cardiac misfolded pro-
teins and increased levels of polyubiquitinated proteins associated
with a drastic reduction in chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity
(Fig. 2A–C). These data suggest that MI impairs the cardiac protein
quality control through a reduction in proteasome activity, which is
known to contribute to ER stress. In fact, we have observed a signifi-
cant negative correlation between cardiac chymotrypsin-like protea-
some activity and protein levels of both misfolded and ER stress
makers (Fig. 2D). Conversely, a positive and significant correlation
was observed between cardiac chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity
and cardiac function (Fig. 2E).
Aerobic exercise training restored chymotrypsin-like proteasome
activity (Fig. 2C) in hearts of MI rats paralleled by a reduction in mis-
folded and polyubiquitinated protein levels (Fig. 2A and B). Altogether,
these results indicate that AET by improving cardiac proteasome activ-
ity reestablish cardiac protein quality control reducing ER stress,
which further attenuates MI-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Discussion
Over the last years, several studies have reported that ER stress is
involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases [14–16].
In fact, ER stress leads to cardiac remodelling and dysfunction [7],
and the use of chemical chaperones attenuating ER stress blunts MI-
induced cardiac dysfunction [16]. This calls the attention for thera-
peutic strategies driven to ER stress relief in cardiovascular diseases.
Our study shows, for the first time, that AET-induced attenuation
of cardiac ER stress in post-MI heart failure rats by recovering cardiac
proteasome activity, which is related to improved LV function and
exercise capacity. These findings highlight the importance of AET as
non-pharmacological primary therapy for cardiovascular diseases.
Aerobic exercise training-induced attenuation of LV dysfunction
in post-MI heart failure rats was not followed by a reduction lung
oedema. In fact, we cannot exclude that other alterations in cardiac
hemodynamic (e.g., diastolic dysfunction, fluid overload) might be
less affected by AET or could take longer AET period to reduce lung
oedema. It has been demonstrated that improved LV function by
AET in HF animals is associated with improved cardiac calcium han-
dling, mitochondrial function and reduced neurohumoural hyperac-
tivity [2, 3, 11]. Here, we provide evidence that AET-induced
attenuation of cardiac dysfunction is also related to reestablishment
of ER homoeostasis.

 Myocardial infarction-induced reduction in LVFS was associated
with increased cardiac levels of GRP78, DERLIN-1 and CHOP, which
are proteins involved in UPR-coordinated protein folding and degra-
dation, and cell apoptosis respectively [6, 15, 17]. However, no
changes were observed in VCP levels.
DERLIN-1 and VCP are misfolded protein transporters from ER
lumen to cytosol (DERLIN-1) and within cytosol (VCP) [15, 17].
Both DERLIN-1 and VCP are involved in ER protein degradation, a
process
known
as
ER-associated
protein
degradation
that
comprehends three steps by which misfolded proteins are: translo-
cated from ER to cytosol, ubiquitinated and further degraded by
proteasome [17]. In our MI model, we showed increased levels of
DERLIN-1, but not VCP. These results suggest that only DERLIN-1
is responsive to MI-induced UPR activation, which might be due to
its ER location while VCP is a cytosolic protein. In fact, DERLIN-3,
a DERLIN-1 homologue, drives misfolded protein clearance attenu-
ating ER stress in both mammal cell lineages and neonate cardiac
myocyte [15, 18].

 Despite increased DERLIN-1 protein levels in the hearts of MI
rats, we observed an impaired cardiac protein quality control through
reduced chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, recapitulating previ-
ous results from our lab in patients and animal models of heart failure
[2, 4]. These data suggest that increased levels of DERLIN-1 do not
suffice to relieve MI-induced cardiac ER stress in our model. Accord-
ingly, increased protein level of CHOP in the hearts of MI rats
indicates a shift from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic UPR signal.
We have previously demonstrated that AET changes several fea-
tures that can contribute to cardiac ER stress relief in cardiovascular
disease [2, 3]. We observed that AET attenuates renin angiotensin
and sympathetic system hyperactivation, cardiac calcium imbalance
and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice and rat models of heart failure
[2, 3, 11]. Presently, we extended this knowledge to cardiac ER
homoeostasis, since AET improved cardiac chymotrypsin-like protea-
some activity reestablishing the clearance of misfolded proteins. This
ultimately leads to ER stress relief demonstrated by AET-induced
reduction in levels of proteins considered markers of ER stress.
Study limitation
This study shows that exercise training reestablishes cardiac protein
quality control and attenuates ER stress, which was related to better
cardiac function in post-MI heart failure rats. Although this study
does not provide direct evidence to support cause-effect relationship
between ER stress and MI-induced cardiac deleterious effect, it is
already known that attenuation of ER stress blunts MI-induced
cardiac dysfunction and remodelling by modulating apoptosis and
fibrosis [16].
Our findings suggest that AET attenuates ER stress through the
reestablishment of proteasome activity in post-MI heart failure rats.
However, we cannot exclude that other beneficial effect of AET, such
as reduced neurohumoural systems activation, calcium imbalance,
and mitochondrial dysfunction, might contribute to ER stress relief
[2, 3, 11].
Collectively, our results provide evidence that AET is an available
non-pharmacological therapy to reestablish cardiac protein quality
