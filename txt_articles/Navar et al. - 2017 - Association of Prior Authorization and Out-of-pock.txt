IMPORTANCE Although PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) were approved in 2015, their high cost has
led to strict prior authorization practices and high copays, and use of PSCK9i in clinical
practice has been low.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate patient access to PCSK9i among those prescribed therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using pharmacy transaction data, we evaluated 45 029
patients who were newly prescribed PCSK9i in the United States between August 1, 2015,
and July 31, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The proportion of PCSK9i prescriptions approved and
abandoned (approved but unfilled); multivariable analyses examined factors associated with
approval/abandonment including payor, prescriber specialty, pharmacy benefit manager,
out-of-pocket cost (copay), clinical diagnoses, lipid-lowering medication use, and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
RESULTS Of patients given an incident PCSK9i prescription, 51.2% were women, 56.6%
were 65 years or older, and 52.5% had governmental insurance. Of the patients given a
prescription, 20.8% received approval on the first day, and 47.2% ever received approval. Of
those approved, 65.3% filled the prescription, resulting in 30.9% of those prescribed PCSK9i
ever receiving therapy. After adjustment, patients who were older, male, and had atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease were more likely to be approved, but approval rates did not vary by
patient low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level nor statin use. Other factors associated
with drug approval included having government vs commercial insurance (odds ratio [OR],
3.3; 95% CI, 2.8-3.8), and those filled at a specialty vs retail pharmacy (OR, 1.96; 95% CI,
1.66-2.33). Approval rates varied nearly 3-fold among the top 10 largest pharmacy benefit
managers. Prescription abandonment by patients was most associated with copay costs
(C statistic, 0.86); with abandonment rates ranging from 7.5% for those with $0 copay to
more than 75% for copays greater than $350.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the first year of availability, only half of patients prescribed
a PCSK9i received approval, and one-third of approved prescriptions were never filled owing
to copay.

ince 2015, 2 PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), alirocumab and
evolocumab, have been approved for adults with per-
sistently elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy and
those with familial hypercholesterolemia.1,2 The retail cost for
thesePCSK9icanbeasmuchas$14 000peryear,leadinghealth
insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to imple-
ment utilization management processes including prior au-
thorization and patient therapy copays. To date, limited em-
pirical information is available on how these preauthorization
processes and copays jointly are associated with access to
PCSK9i in community practice.
In this analysis, we evaluated what proportion of pa-
tients prescribed PCSK9i ultimately received therapy and fac-
tors associated with both approval and dispensing in the first
year after PCSK9i were approved by the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration. Specifically, we calculated the proportion of pa-
tients who received a rejection initially (within 24 hours) as
well as the proportion who ultimately received approval. We
also examined the proportion of approved prescriptions that
were filled vs left at the pharmacy (abandoned) and deter-
mined the duration between initial prescription and medica-
tion dispense. Next, we examined what factors were associ-
ated with an increased odds of receiving therapy. Finally, we
examined the association between patient copay and prescrip-
tion abandonment.
Methods
Data Description
Using pharmacy claims transactional data from Symphony
HealthSolutions,weevaluatednewPCSK9iprescriptionsfrom
August 1, 2015, through July 31, 2016. The Symphony Health
Solutionsdatabasecapturesfulllifecyclepharmacyclaimsdata
from initial submission of a prescription through its final dis-
position from more than 90% of retail, 60% of mail-order, and
70% of specialty pharmacies in the United States. Pharmacy-
level transmissions are date and time stamped and include
whether (1) the claim was rejected or approved; (2) the pa-
tient filled the prescription (dispensed) or left it at the phar-
macy after it was approved (abandoned); and (3) secondary in-
surance or a coupon program was used to defray the patient’
s
copay.Availablepatientcharacteristicsincludedsex,age,payor
(s), PBM(s), prescribing clinician taxonomy code, and phar-
macy type used. The payor associated with a patient was de-
terminedbyevaluatingallpayorsforwhichprescriptionclaims
were processed for a given patient during the prescription epi-
sode. Payor types were split into commercial or government
(including Veterans Affairs, Tricare, Medicare, Managed Med-
icaid, and Medicaid).
Pharmacy transaction data at the patient level were linked
to electronic health record and claims data for a subset of pa-
tients.Amongpatientswithelectronichealthrecordandclaims
linkages, we identified adults with a diagnosis of prior athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on the day of or prior
to the first prescription for a PCSK9i. Atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease was defined as a diagnosis of coronary ar-
tery disease, cerebrovascular disease (prior stroke, transient
ischemic attack, and carotid stenosis), peripheral arterial dis-
ease, or other atherosclerotic vascular disease on the day of
or prior to the PCSK9i prescription. eTable 1 in the Supplement
lists the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes used to clas-
sify patient diagnoses. Medication data were used to identify
adults with an active prescription for a statin, a high-
intensity statin (atorvastatin ≥ 40 mg or rosuvastatin ≥ 20 mg),
ezetimibe,orotherlipid-loweringtherapyatthetimeofPCSK9i
prescription. Follow-up was available from August 1, 2015,
through August 31, 2016.
The unit of analysis was at the patient level because pa-
tients could be issued multiple or redundant prescriptions for
the same medication or could be prescribed 2 different PCSK9i
types and because individual prescriptions were often sub-
mitted and resubmitted multiple times in succession, either
for administrative reasons (eg, wrong date of birth) or clinical
appeals. The first transaction for any PCSK9i prescription for
a patient was considered the prescribing date, with the first
prescription episode defined as the time between the prescrib-
ingdateandfirstPCSK9idispenseforthosewhoreceivedmedi-
cation, the time between the prescribing date and first ap-
proval for abandoned prescriptions, and the time between
prescribing date and last rejection for those who were never
approved.
This study was approved by the Duke University institu-
tional review board. Informed consent was not required be-
cause this analysis used deidentified data from Symphony
Health Solutions.
Factors Associated With Approval
We evaluated ultimate approval and dispense rates, as well as
approval rates in the first 24 hours after a prescription was sub-
mitted, for all prescriptions between August 1, 2015, and July
31, 2016. Approval rates in the first 24 hours were used to de-
termine the proportion of prescriptions filled on initial at-
tempt vs those that were approved later with appeals or re-
submissions of claims over time. Next, differences in approval
rates were evaluated by pharmacy type (retail, mail order, in-
stitutional, or specialty), payor type (government, commer-
cial, government and commercial, or other/none), and clini-
ciantype(cardiology,endocrinology,generalpracticeincluding
Key Points
Question What is the association of prior authorization and copay
with patient access to PCSK9 inhibitors among those who are
prescribed therapy?
Findings In this observational analysis, in the first year of PCSK9
inhibitors availability, only 47.2% of patients prescribed PCSK9
inhibitors received insurance approval for therapy, and of those,
34.7% never filled the prescription from the pharmacy. Prescription
abandonment was largely explained by out-of-pocket cost.
Meaning Less than one-third of patients prescribed PSCK9
inhibitors therapy never received therapy owing to a combination
of lack of insurance approval and cost sharing.

defined by clinician taxonomy codes. Multivariable logistic re-
gressionmodelingwasusedtoevaluatefactorsassociatedwith
receivingapprovalformedication,andincludedage,sex,payor
type, prescriber specialty, and pharmacy type. In addition, to
evaluate differences in approval rates by PBM, the model in-
cluded indicator variables for the top 10 PBMs volume of pa-
tients prescribed PSCK9i therapy in the sample.
To evaluate the association of clinical factors and medi-
cation use with approvals, the multivariable model of approv-
als was rerun for the subsample of patients on whom clinical
and medication data were available. A further subset of pa-
tients had linked laboratory data available with at least 1 LDL-C
value in the prior year. Approval rates by most recent LDL-C
level were evaluated for this subset of patients by evaluating
the odds of approval at different LDL-C levels adjusting for pa-
tient demographics, clinical characteristics, and payor fac-
tors as in prior logistic regression models. To assess the de-
gree to which clinical, medication, and laboratory data were
associated with approvals, the C statistics from this full model
and a model without diagnoses, laboratory, and medication
data were calculated.
Factors Associated With Dispensing After Approval
To allow for comparison of out-of-pocket costs when variable
medication quantities were issued to patients, copay was de-
fined as a patient’
s out-of-pocket cost for a 1-month supply of
medication after any insurance claim, coupon, or patient as-
sistance programs. To evaluate the relationship between co-
pay and abandonment (prescription approved but not picked
up at the pharmacy), the proportion of prescriptions dis-
pensed (vs abandoned) by percentile of copay was evaluated
for approved prescriptions. Next, a multivariable logistic re-
gression model was created to evaluate the association be-
tween copay and prescription dispensing (vs abandonment),
firstaloneandthenafteradjustingforage,sex,payortype,pre-
scriber specialty, pharmacy type, and time to first approval.
Owingtothenonlinearrelationshipbetweenpatientcopayand
prescriptionabandonment,theassociationbetweencopayand
prescription dispensing was modeled using restricted cubic
splines with knots at the 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. Be-
cause copay is modeled with restricted cubic splines, odds ra-
tios (ORs) for specific copays are displayed. The C statistic for
this full multivariable logistic regression model was calcu-
lated in addition to the C statistic for a model using only co-
pay to determine the degree to which copay alone affected pre-
scription abandonment.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and STATA SE 14.2 (STATACorp).
Results
Population Description and Rates of Rejection, Approvals,
and Dispensing
We analyzed 45 029 patients initially prescribed a PCSK9i be-
tween August 1, 2015, and July 31, 2016, in the Symphony
Health Solutions data. In the first day following submission of
the incident prescription, 35 658 patients (79.2%) were ini-
tially rejected and 20.8% were approved. Of those rejected,
73.5% (n = 26 193) were appealed or resubmitted, after which
an additional 11 888 (45.4% of appeals and 26.4% of all pa-
tients) received approval, leading to an ultimate approval rate
of 47.2% (Figure 1). Among 21 259 patients who received ap-
proval, 7368 (34.7% of those who received approval) never
pickedupthemedicationandthereforewereconsidered“aban-
doned.” Ultimately, 13 891 of 45 029 patients (30.9%) initially
prescribed a PCSK9i actually received therapy (Figure 1). The
median time between initial submission and approval was 3.9
days (interquartile range, 0-20.0). However, approval times
were more prolonged for other patients; 17.2% of patients
waited 30 days or more, the top 10% of patients waited at least
52 days, and the top 5% waited 87 days or longer for approval
(eFigure in the Supplement).

by those receiving initial (first-day) prescription approval and
those who received ultimate approval. Most patients (23 652;
52.5%) had government insurance, and of those with govern-
ment insurance, 89.8% had Medicare. Commercial insurers
covered 40.0% of patients (n = 17 999), and 4.5% (n = 2043)
had both commercial and government insurance. Retail phar-
macies were most commonly used (35 234; 78.2%), although
nearly one-fifth of prescriptions were filled through a spe-
cialty pharmacy. A total of 18 398 unique physicians wrote pre-
scriptions for PSCK9i, with median of 1 (interquartile range,
1-3) patient per physician. Nearly half of those patients were
prescribed therapy by a cardiologist (48.3%), followed by gen-
eral practitioners (36.8%).

 Among those with clinical data available (n = 17 851; 39.6%
of the sample), 68.3% had a diagnosis of atherosclerotic car-
diovascular disease (n = 12 186), the most common of which
wascoronaryarterydisease(n = 10 869;60.9%,Table1).Lipid-
lowering therapy use was infrequent at the time of PCSK9i pre-
scription, with only 23.1% receiving a statin (2071 [11.6%] re-
ceiving high intensity and 2053 [11.5%] receiving low/
moderate intensity), 10.5% receiving ezetimibe (n = 1874), and
11.6% receiving another form of lipid-lowering therapy
(n = 2072). In the subsample of patients with laboratory data
available and an LDL-C value within the last year (n = 5383),
16.6% had an LDL-C value greater than 190 mg/dL (n = 891),
17.5% between 160 and 189 mg/dL (n = 941), and 10.2% less
than 70 mg/dL (n = 548; to convert to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 0.0259). Of note, patient characteristics as well as ap-
proval rates were generally similar among those who had clini-
cal and/or laboratory data available as was seen in the overall
patient sample (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Factors Associated With Receiving
Ultimate Prescription Approval
In multivariable modeling, several demographic, clinical, and
payor factors were associated with the likelihood that a PCSK9i
prescription would be approved. Table 2 provides the ORs for
ultimate approval among the subsample of patients with labo-
ratory and clinical data available (n = 5383); however, the mag-
nitude and direction of these associations were similar in the
overall patient sample and among those with clinical data only
(eTable3intheSupplement).Patientswhowereolderandmen
were more likely to have their prescription approved than their
counterparts. Adults with prior ASCVD were more likely to re-
ceive approval for therapy than adults without a diagnosis of
ASCVD (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.35), yet there was no differ-
ence in odds of approval seen in those receiving a high-
intensity statin (vs no statin, OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2), a low/
moderate–intensity statin (vs no statin, OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-
1.4), nor by the patient’
s most recent LDL-C level to the time
of PCSK9i prescription. Those receiving ezetimibe were more
likely to receive approval (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6).
Patients with prescriptions written by general practition-
ers had the lowest approval rates, while those from cardiolo-
gists had the highest chance of success (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.24-
1.63 for cardiology vs general practice). Patients who had
prescriptions processed by specialty pharmacies were more
likely to be approved than retail pharmacies (OR, 1.96; 95% CI,
1.66-2.33). Patients with government insurance plans had a
higher odds of approval than those with commercial insur-
ance (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.79-3.83).
The likelihood for prescription approval also varied sig-
nificantly by which PBM was used (Table 2). In fact, knowing
patient age, sex, pharmacy type, prescriber type, payor, and
PBM could correctly discriminate ultimate approval in 72% of
cases (C statistic, 0.721). Including laboratory, medication, and
diagnoses data only increased the model prediction to a C sta-
tistic of 0.737.
Factors Associated With Abandonment
of Approved Prescriptions
Amongpatientswhoreceivedapprovalfortherapy(n = 21 259),
7368 (34.7%) never filled the prescription. Patient copays
ranged from $0 to $2822 per month supply, with a median of
$15 and interquartile range of $15 to $373. Figure 2 demon-
strates the association between patient copays and the pro-
portion of patients who had therapy dispensed. Overall, 23%
of patients with approved prescriptions had a $0 copay
(n = 4781); of these, 92.6% of patients (n = 4425) picked up the
medicationfromthepharmacy.Therateofdispensingdropped
as copays increased until around $350, after which, dispens-
ing rates were flat between 20% to 25%. Once the prescrip-
tion was approved, copay alone was highly predictive of
whether a patient would fill their prescription; the C statistic
was 0.86 for the logistic regression model evaluating the as-
sociation between copay and prescription abandonment with
copay alone. Including payor, clinician, time to approval, and
pharmacy type only marginally increased model perfor-
mance (C statistic for multivariable model, 0.87).
After adjusting for patient demographics, pharmacy,
prescribing clinician, and payor, copay remained highly

 predictive of whether a patient would pick up the medication
from the pharmacy after it was approved. Table 3 shows the
proportion of prescriptions dispensed after approval by sub-
group, and results from multivariable logistic regression of fac-
tors associated with prescription dispensing after approval.
Comparedwithpatientswhohadnoout-of-pocketcosts,those
with a $10 copay had a 19% lower odds of filling their prescrip-
tion (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.81-0.82), and those with a $100 co-
payhada84%lowerodds(OR,0.16;95%CI,0.15-0.17;Table3).
In addition to higher copay, women, those with government
insurance, use of a specialty pharmacy, and increased times
toapprovalwereassociatedwithlowerratesofmedicationdis-
pensing in multivariable modeling.
Discussion
The high retail cost of PCSK9i therapy has led to significant de-
bate about their cost-effectiveness and optimal price points.3-5
In response to these costs, payors have implemented various
utilization management strategies including prior authoriza-
tion requirements and patient cost-sharing (copays). While
these strategies have contained costs,6 our analysis suggests
thatthesepracticesmaybeabluntinstrumenttoidentifythose
at highest risk or those who may benefit the most.
Our study was not designed to address the appropriate-
ness of current drug prices; rather, our analyses address the
degree to which utilization management and patient out-of-
pocket costs were associated with the likelihood that a
patient prescribed therapy by their physician would ulti-
mately receive this therapy. In the first year of PSCK9i avail-
ability, fewer than 1 in 3 adults initially prescribed PCSK9i
therapy actually received it: 52.8% never received approval,
and 34.7% of those approved never filled the prescription.
While those with ASCVD were slightly more likely to receive
approval than those without, there was no difference in
approval rates by statin use or LDL-C levels. In contrast, non-
clinical factors, such as the patient’
s payor type, PBM, and
type of pharmacy used, all strongly were associated with the
likelihood that a prescription would be approved. Once
approved, out-of-pocket costs were the primary driver of
prescription abandonment.
Clinicians and pharmacy type both were associated with
thesuccessofinitialprescriptions.Cardiologistsweremoresuc-
cessful than other clinicians in obtaining approval for PCSK9i,
which may indicate that subspecialists were better able to se-
lect patients who met these criteria. Alternately, the in-
creased volume of prescriptions written by cardiologists may
have allowed them to develop support systems to better navi-
gate the complex application and appeal process for their pa-
tients.Specialtypharmaciesalsohadhigherapprovalrates,po-
tentially owing to systems to support clinicians in appealing
payor rejections.
However, one of strongest factors associated with
approval rates was which payor and PBM were involved.
This is likely owing to differences in both criteria required
for approval and the process itself. While we were unable to
determine the proportion of rejections that were clinically
appropriate, concerns have been raised by patients and pro-
fessional societies that the approval process may limit
therapy access to those who are clinically indicated.7,8 We

 did find that patients with established ASCVD and patients
receiving ezetimibe had a slightly higher odds of receiving
approval for PCKS9i. However, we found no difference in
approval rates among patients who were receiving any statin
or a high-intensity statin and those who were not, nor was
there any difference in approval rates by LDL-C levels. Addi-
tionally, even after adjusting for these factors, nonclinical
factors, such as payor type, PBM, prescriber type, and phar-
macy used, remained highly associated with of approval
success. One interesting finding was that 10.2% of patients
had a most recent LDL-C value less than 70 mg/dL, with
just more than half of those patients receiving approval.
Although the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research
With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk
(FOURIER) trial shows that PCSK9i are effective in those
with low-starting LDL-C, most payor criteria at the time
required LDL-C to be greater than 70 mg/dL.9 Whether this
represents potential inappropriate prescribing vs patients
who later developed statin intolerance remains unclear and
should be further studied.
After patients were approved for a medication, we found
that up to one-third abandoned the prescription at the phar-
macy. This high abandonment rate was almost fully ac-
countedforbydifferencesinpatientout-of-pocketcosts;fewer
than 1 in 10 patients with a $0 copay failed to fill their medi-
cation, whereas 3 of 4 patients with a copay exceeding $375
did not pick up their prescription. Furthermore, although the
“stickerprice”fortherapymaybethesameforallpatients,how
much patients actually paid out of pocket varied widely, from
$0 for the lowest quartile of patients to more than $300 per
month for the highest quartile. Although coupon and patient
assistance programs can help offset copay and were used by
38% of patients in this sample, coupon programs are largely
unavailable to those with government insurance. Addition-
ally, even after adjusting for copay, patients with government
insurance (which was mostly Medicare in this data set) had
higher abandonment rates than those with commercial insur-
ance; whether this finding is owing to socioeconomic factors
or older age needs further exploration. Although we only as-
sessed a patient’
s first fill of PSCK9i, copay also has potential
to affect medication persistence and refills and should be stud-
ied. This may be particularly relevant to Medicare beneficia-
ries, who often have fluctuating out-of-pocket costs based on
their phase of coverage (eg, before, during, and after the “do-
nut hole”).
Ourstudyalsofoundthattheapprovalprocessisoftenpro-
longed. In 17% of cases, approval was only obtained after more
than a month of appeals. This appeal and reapplication pro-
cess adds significant time to clinicians’workload. One study
estimatedthatpriorauthorizationrequestsandappealsingen-
eral consume up to 20 hours of staff and professional time per
week,permedicalpractice.10Additionally,wefoundthatthese
delays could affect patients’likelihood to fill their prescrip-
tionevenifultimatelyapproved.Specifically,thosewhowaited
longer for approval were less likely to pick up the prescrip-
tion from the pharmacy, even adjusting for copay.
Limitations
The biggest limitation of this study is that it is challenging to
fully adjudicate the complex clinical factors used in various
PBM approval processes. Thus, we could not fully determine
whether specific rejections met these criteria. However, our
results suggest that a person’
s likelihood of receiving
therapy is strongly influenced by payor and PBM dynamics,
including differences in payor and PBM policies for approval,
which we could not account for in this analysis. Our study
had some additional limitations. First, Symphony Health
Solutions data do not cover 100% of all pharmacies; how-
ever, given the large proportion of US pharmacies that are
covered by Symphony Health Solutions, the data we exam-
ined likely reflect the experience of most patients prescribed
PCSK9i. Second, we evaluated copay as the ultimate out-of-
pocket expense. Given the use of coupon cards and patient
assistance programs, our analysis reflects out-of-pocket
costs rather than the cost share that individual payors are
expecting from patients. Finally, we only evaluated
