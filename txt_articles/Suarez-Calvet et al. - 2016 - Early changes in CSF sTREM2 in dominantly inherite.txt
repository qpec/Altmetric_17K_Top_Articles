Abstract
Emerging evidence supports a role for innate immunity and microglia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
pathophysiology. However, no marker related to microglia has been included in the temporal

 selectively expressed by microglia and genetically linked to AD and other neurodegenerative 
disorders. Its ectodomain is released by proteolysis as a soluble variant (sTREM2) and can be 
detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In patients with autosomal dominant AD, we tested how 
many years before the expected symptom onset did CSF sTREM2 increase in mutation carriers 
(MCs) compared to noncarriers (NCs). We also determined the temporal sequence of changes in 
CSF sTREM2 and markers for amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration as well as cognitive 
performance. We included 218 participants consisting of 127 MC and 91 NC siblings from the 
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. We observed that CSF sTREM2 increased in MCs 
compared to NCs 5 years before the expected symptom onset and this difference remained 
significant until 5 years after the expected symptom onset. Changes in CSF sTREM2 occurred 
after alterations were observed in markers for brain amyloidosis and neuronal injury. We propose 
that microglial activation occurs several years before the expected symptom onset, but after 
amyloidosis and neuronal injury have already occurred.
INTRODUCTION
Twenty-five years after the amyloid hypothesis was proposed (1), multiple evidence supports 
the notion that the pathogenic sequence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is triggered by amyloid 
pathology, followed by neurofibrillary tangle degeneration and cognitive decline (2–5). 
However, inflammatory events and, specifically, activation of microglia have been observed 
in basically all neurodegenerative disorders including AD, suggesting that the immune 
response plays an important part in the pathological cascade of neurodegeneration (6). For 
AD, microglial involvement was already noted in the initial publication by Alois Alzheimer 
in 1907 (7). Since then, the role of microglia in AD pathology has been debated, and 
because of the lack of selective inflammatory markers, it is still unclear whether 
inflammation and microglial activation or β-amyloid (Aβ)– and tau-related abnormalities 
occur first in the cascade of pathological events. This is an essential question because its 
answer may have major consequences not only for the relevance of the amyloid cascade but 
also for therapeutic approaches. This debate was reinforced by the recent identification of 
AD-related gene variants in loci harboring immune-related genes (8–16). Among them, 
TREM2 gene mutations are of particular interest, because these are associated with an 
increase in the risk for AD to a similar extent as that observed for the APOE ε4 allele (9, 
14). TREM2 encodes an innate immune receptor that is expressed on the surface of cells of 
the myeloid lineage, such as monocytes, macrophages, osteoclasts, or microglia, in the 
central nervous system (17). Further studies have also reported that mutations in the TREM2 
gene may also increase the risk for Parkinson’s disease (18), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
(18–20), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (21). Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in 
TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease and FTD-like syndrome (22–24), rare 
neurodegenerative diseases with a predominant frontal lobe phenotype, but without amyloid 
or neurofibrillary tangle deposition. Moreover, systems biology studies have identified 
TREM2 and its adaptor protein DAP12 as central hubs in AD pathogenesis (25, 26). Loss of 
TREM2 also affects the outcome of traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and cuprizone-
induced demyelination (27–29). Thus, TREM2 plays a key role in a multitude of 
neurological disorders and may therefore not only hold a key for understanding disease 
progression but also be a new and unexpected therapeutic target, probably even for cases

 who have already progressed to overt disease. Functionally, TREM2 signaling affects 
microglial phagocytosis, migration, and chemotaxis (30–32). Therefore, it is tempting to 
speculate that the underlying cellular mechanisms of TREM2 mutations, which lead to an 
increased risk for AD and neurodegeneration, may involve phagocytosis and/or 
inflammatory defects. TREM2 is shed by ADAM10 (32, 33), releasing soluble TREM2 
(sTREM2) into the extracellular space. Certain mutations, such as the p.T66M TREM2 
mutation, prevent appropriate folding of the ectodomain and thus lead to the retention of the 
full-length immature protein within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (32). In vivo, sTREM2 
is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can be quantified by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mass spectrometry (32, 34–38). Consistent with its 
retention within the ER, sTREM2 is almost undetectable in the CSF and plasma of patients 
carrying the homozygous p.T66M TREM2 mutation (32, 38). Moreover, we recently 
demonstrated that the levels of CSF sTREM2 dynamically change during normal aging and 
during the progression of sporadic AD, where they peak at the early symptomatic stages of 
the disease (37).
Here, we use CSF sTREM2 as a marker to investigate the temporal order of pathological 
events early during the disease and even before the onset of clinical symptoms. We evaluated 
CSF sTREM2 levels in cases with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) enrolled within the 
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) cohort (www.dian-info.org/de/). DIAN is 
a multicenter observational study that follows individuals at risk for carrying an ADAD 
mutation. The unique design of the DIAN project enabled us to investigate AD in its pre-
clinical stages and to determine the trajectories of markers during the natural course of the 
disease. A seminal paper published in 2012 demonstrated that the first detectable 
pathological event in ADAD is the alteration of Aβ1–42 levels and the onset of brain 
amyloidosis [as measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-
PET)], followed by increased tau, enhanced brain atrophy, and decreased glucose 
metabolism (2). Only after these preclinical changes did cognitive impairment and 
eventually dementia appear. A similar model of dynamic marker changes in sporadic AD has 
been presented by Jack and colleagues (3, 4). Although increasing evidence supports the 
involvement of innate immunity in AD pathogenesis (39–41), no marker related to innate 
immunity has been included in the temporal evolution models of AD. Here, we use the 
DIAN cohort to address the pivotal question of whether microglial activation precedes or 
follows changes in Aβ and tau.
RESULTS
Association of CSF sTREM2 with mutation status and age
We analyzed data from 218 participants in the DIAN cohort, including 127 mutation carriers 
(MCs) and 91 noncarriers (NCs). The characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 
1. In the entire sample, CSF sTREM2 tended to be higher in males than in females (F1,199 = 
3.9, P = 0.051) but was not affected by the APOE ε4 status (F1,209 = 0.27, P = 0.603; table 
S1). CSF sTREM2 was increased in MCs compared to NCs after adjusting for gender, age, 
and APOE ε4 status (F1,201 = 4.6, P = 0.033; Fig. 1A and table S1). Among MCs, CSF 
sTREM2 levels were not different between the three ADAD mutations (PSEN1, PSEN2, and

 APP; F2,36 = 2.2, P = 0.125; Fig. 1B). Moreover, the amount of CSF sTREM2 was not 
associated with the clinical severity of mutation subtype, as measured by the mean age of 
symptom onset, which is specific for different mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP 
genes. (β = −0.159, SE = 0.097, P = 0.105; Fig. 1C). However, CSF sTREM2 was positively 
associated with age in both MCs (β = +0.526, SE = 0.075, P < 0.0001) and NCs (β = 
+0.330, SE = 0.109, P = 0.003; Fig. 1D).
Early increase of CSF sTREM2 in ADAD patients
To study changes in CSF sTREM2 during the asymptomatic and symptomatic progression of 
AD, we used a linear mixed model including mutation status, estimated years from expected 
symptom onset (EYO; and its quadratic and cubic terms, and the interactions with mutation 
status), and gender as fixed effects and family affiliation as a random effect. The interactions 
of the quadratic and the cubic terms with mutation status were significant predictors of CSF 
sTREM2 (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.008, respectively; table S2), suggesting a nonlinear 
relationship between EYO and CSF sTREM2 that differed between MCs and NCs. On the 
basis of the estimated trajectory of CSF sTREM2 levels across EYOs, we compared the CSF 
sTREM2 levels at 5-year EYO intervals by t tests, as described by Bateman et al. (2). CSF 
sTREM2 started to be significantly increased in MCs compared to NCs at EYO = −5, and 
this difference remained significant until EYO = +5 years (Fig. 2, Table 2, and fig. S1). In 
more advanced stages (EYO > +5), differences did not reach statistical significance, which 
might, however, be due to the low number of participants in later EYOs (Fig. 2). To confirm 
that our results were not influenced by age, APOE ε4 status, or education, we also computed 
the estimates of CSF sTREM2 for each 5-year EYO adjusting by age (table S3), APOE ε4 
status (table S4), and education (table S5), and the values were similar to those without 
including these covariables.
An increase in CSF sTREM2 follows initial changes in Aβ and tau
We compared the time course of alterations in CSF sTREM2 with changes in the temporal 
evolution of biochemical, neuroimaging, and cognitive markers along the range of −25 to 
+10 EYO (Table 2). We observed that levels of CSF sTREM2 followed Aβ deposition, as 
measured by PIB-PET imaging, a decrease in CSF Aβ1–42, and an increase in CSF T-tau, but 
were concurrent with precuneus FDG-PET SUVR, hippocampus volume, and cognitive 
(MMSE) changes (Fig. 3 and Table 2). These findings demonstrate that, at least in ADAD 
patients, microglial activity (as measured by an increase in CSF sTREM2) did not precede 
but rather followed Aβ and tau and associated neurodegenerative changes, which is in line 
with the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Of note, similar results were obtained when linear (fig. 
S2A), quadratic (fig. S2B), and cubic models were used (fig. S2C; for details, see the 
Supplementary Materials).
CSF sTREM2 association with CSF core markers of AD
The associations between CSF sTREM2 and each of the core CSF markers of AD were 
tested in linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 status. In the 
pooled sample of subjects, higher levels of CSF sTREM2 were associated with higher levels 
of CSF T-tau (β = +0.349, SE = 0.065, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A) and P-tau181P (β = +0.307, SE = 
0.060, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B), but no association was found with Aβ1–42 (β = −0.020, SE =

 0.065, P = 0.764; Fig. 4C). In NCs, higher CSF sTREM2 was associated with higher CSF T-
tau, P-tau181P, and Aβ1–42 (T-tau: β = +0.371, SE = 0.108, P = 0.001; P-tau181P: β = +0.360, 
SE = 0.122, P = 0.004; Aβ1–42: β = +0.313, SE = 0.099, P = 0.002; Fig. 4, D to F). In MCs, 
higher CSF sTREM2 was associated with both higher CSF T-tau and P-tau181P (T-tau: β = 
+0.298, SE = 0.088, P = 0.001; P-tau181P: β = +0.270, SE = 0.079, P = 0.001; Fig. 4, G and 
H), but not Aβ1–42 (β = −0.073, SE = 0.088, P = 0.409; Fig. 4I). The sample contained some 
extreme values of T-tau and P-tau181P; the analysis with and without these values yielded 
similar results.
CSF sTREM2 is selectively increased in patients with mild clinical symptoms
Next, we assessed the changes in CSF sTREM2 as a function of clinical stages (as measured 
using the CDR scale). We compared CSF sTREM2 levels between NCs (n = 91; CDR = 0, n 
= 88; CDR = 0.5, n = 3), asymptomatic MCs (CDR = 0, n = 52), MCs with very mild 
dementia (CDR = 0.5, n = 51), MCs with mild dementia (CDR = 1, n = 16), and MCs with 
moderate to severe dementia (CDR ≥ 2, n = 8). CSF sTREM2 differed between groups 
(F4,206 = 5.0, P = 0.001) adjusted for gender, age, APOE ε4 status, and education. CSF 
sTREM2 was increased in MCs with CDR = 0.5 and with a CDR = 1 compared to NCs (P = 
0.006 and P = 0.044, respectively) and to the MC group with CDR = 0 (P = 0.003 and P = 
0.021, respectively; Fig. 5). MCs with CDR ≥ 2 did not have significantly increased CSF 
sTREM2 compared to the rest of the groups, although this should be interpreted with care 
because of the low number of patients in this clinical stage.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have demonstrated that CSF sTREM2 increases early in the progression of ADAD, 
that is, before the expected onset of symptoms, but after amyloidosis and neuronal injury 
have already begun. This finding supports the amyloid cascade hypothesis and adds the first 
innate immunity marker to a temporal model of AD progression (see Fig. 3).
The strength of this study is the inclusion of a large and very well characterized cohort of 
people destined to develop AD. Moreover, studying ADAD has the advantage that the 
prevalence of other co-morbidities is lower than in sporadic AD, and hence, the changes in 
any marker can be mainly attributed to AD and not to other conditions. However, such 
analyses have their natural limitations. First, the changes of CSF sTREM2 through the 
course of the disease are analyzed in cross-sectional data. Second, more participants in the 
later stages of the disease (that is, EYO > +5) would be required for confirmation of the 
tendency of CSF sTREM2 to return to normal levels (Fig. 3). Third, the detection of markers 
in any study, not only in the one described here, depends on the relative sensitivity of the 
technique used to detect differences, which may not be equal between different markers 
(42). In regard to the sensitivity of sTREM2 detection, we have shown previously the 
potential of our ELISA assay to sensitively detect even minor changes in sTREM2 (32, 37). 
Fourth, ADAD and sporadic AD are different entities. However, both share major 
pathophysiological similarities, and both appear to be triggered by the amyloid cascade (43). 
Fifth, as we previously stated (32, 37), the overlapping values of CSF sTREM2 levels 
between patients and controls preclude its use as a diagnostic marker, but it provides a

 marker to track microglial activity throughout the evolution of the disease. Finally, the 
results presented here need to be confirmed with an independent microglia-related marker 
(for example, PET tracer 18F-GE180, a ligand of the 18-kDa translocator protein TSPO and 
a marker of activated microglia) (44, 45). Nonetheless, our previous results where we 
observed that TREM2 activity, as measured by phagocytic capacity, correlated with its 
surface transport and subsequent shedding support the notion that sTREM2 levels reflect 
microglia activation (32).
Although it is well established that microglial activation and neuroinflammation frequently 
accompany the early development of amyloid and tau pathology (39–41, 46), the temporal 
evolution of glia-related marker changes in AD has not been addressed. For decades, there 
was an intensive discussion about which comes first, inflammation triggering amyloid 
deposition or neuronal injury, or vice versa (47, 48). The unique design of the DIAN study 
allowed us to evaluate the dynamic changes of CSF sTREM2 and determine the temporal 
order of these changes compared to changes in markers of amyloid deposition and 
neurodegeneration and measures of cognitive performance. CSF sTREM2 levels start to 
significantly increase in MCs 5 years before the expected onset of symptoms and remain 
high until 5 years after the expected onset of symptoms. Thus, changes in CSF sTREM2 
occur later than alterations in brain amyloidosis and neuronal injury biomarkers, which 
occur at least 15 years before the expected symptom onset (Fig. 3 and Table 2). CSF 
sTREM2 changes are concurrent with the first signs of cerebral hypometabolism, 
hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive impairment (as measured by MMSE), which all become 
significant 5 years before the expected onset of the symptoms. Together, these findings 
support the notion that microglia involvement in AD is a relatively early event, which, 
however, follows changes in amyloid deposition and neuronal injury. This is consistent with 
the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which states that amyloid is the driving force of AD 
pathogenesis (5, 49). This may also explain why we and others do not observe clear 
associations between CSF Aβ1–42 and CSF sTREM2 in AD (35–38). Our results show that 
the CSF sTREM2 increase occurs after amyloidosis, when markers of neuronal injury have 
already become abnormal; thus, CSF Aβ1–42 and CSF sTREM2 change at two different 
stages of AD and do not evolve simultaneously. Instead, CSF sTREM2 changes are closely 
associated with CSF T-tau and P-tau181P, which are markers of neurodegeneration 
subsequent to the development of Aβ deposition. Thus, the increase of CSF sTREM2 may 
reflect an acute response to early and probably still subtle neuronal injury. These findings 
are in line with studies proposing that TREM2 recognizes apoptotic neurons and mediates 
their phagocytosis (50, 51). Detailed studies in large and well-defined cohorts using PET 
imaging techniques may be required to further support and extend the temporal evolution of 
disease progression proposed in our study. Currently available results of microglia PET 
imaging in AD are mixed and hampered by small sample sizes (52, 53). Nevertheless, a 
recent study using a second-generation TSPO PET tracer suggests microglial activation as 
early as the presymptomatic stages and further increasing in the prodromal stage of sporadic 
AD (54). These findings are in general agreement with our conclusions. In contrast, 
available data about astroglial activation in a small group of ADAD subjects using the 
astrocyte-specific PET tracer [11C]deuterium-L-deprenyl suggest a different course

 regarding changes in astrogliosis, with an initial peak at the presymptomatic stage and a 
subsequent decline (55, 56).
Increases in CSF sTREM2 plateaued in later symptomatic stages in MCs, although other 
markers of neurodegeneration, neuronal death, and dysfunction (for example, hippocampal 
atrophy, CSF T-tau, and FDG-PET hypometabolism) continued to increase. This observation 
may be explained by microglial senescence, which occurs during aging and progresses to a 
dystrophic pathological stage. Dystrophic but not activated microglia are abundant in later 
stages of AD (57, 58). The current results are consistent with our previous observation in 
sporadic AD dementia patients, who had lower CSF sTREM2 compared to patients in the 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, despite having higher CSF T-tau (37). Notably, 
Fagan et al. (59) described that CSF markers of neurodegeneration (T-tau, P-tau181P, and 
VILIP-1) decreased in symptomatic ADAD patients in a study including longitudinal CSF 
samples, a finding that was not observed in a previous cross-sectional study from the same 
group (2). It can be speculated that CSF sTREM2 may also follow a descending trajectory in 
later stages, in parallel to that observed with neuronal injury markers. Results from 
neuropathological studies suggest that the amyloid burden needs to exceed a certain 
threshold to trigger a glial response, but once this response is initiated, it is less dependent 
on amyloid plaques and more closely related to neurofibrillary degeneration (60, 61). The 
fact that microglial activation follows amyloidosis and neuronal injury does not exclude the 
possibility that dysfunctional microglia may in turn contribute to subsequent amyloidosis 
and neuronal injury, for example, by reduced amyloid plaque clearance (32) or reduced 
protection from amyloid plaque growth (62, 63).
Finally, our findings are also relevant to the design of secondary prevention clinical trials. 
CSF sTREM2 may be useful to monitor the efficacy of drugs targeting inflammation. Thus, 
CSF sTREM2 may not only be a marker of microglial activity in response to neuronal injury 
but also serve as a therapeutic marker. In this regard, it will be interesting to follow changes 
in sTREM2 during anti-Aβ immunotherapeutic studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We studied individuals carrying an ADAD mutation (PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP) and their NC 
siblings included in the DIAN. DIAN [National Institute on Aging (U19 AG032438); R.J.B., 
principal investigator] was initiated in 2008. The main goal of DIAN is to develop a registry 
of families with known ADAD mutations and investigate the pathophysiological changes 
that occur in the different stages of AD (2, 64). The study is coordinated from Washington 
University, with participation by 15 other centers worldwide. We measured CSF sTREM2 
for 221 participants, but 3 of them had no clinical information and were excluded from the 
analysis. Thus, the study sample consisted of a total of 218 participants, 127 MCs and 91 
NCs. The sample size was calculated while taking into account the effect size of the 
difference in CSF sTREM2 between healthy controls, MCI, and AD patients that we 
previously described (32, 37) to reach an 80% power and a 5% significance.

 DIAN study participants undergo a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological 
evaluation that has been described elsewhere (2, 65). EYO was calculated as the difference 
between the participant’s age at evaluation and the age of parental symptom onset (2). The 
presence of an ADAD mutation and the APOE genotype was determined using standard 
methods described elsewhere (66). CSF collection followed standard procedures (59, 67), 
and the measurements of CSF Aβ1–42, T-tau, and P-tau181P were performed using the 
Luminex bead–based multiplexed xMAP technology (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, Innogenetics) 
(59).
Measurement of sTREM2
CSF sTREM2 was measured by an ELISA previously established by our group using the 
MSD platform (see the Supplementary Materials) (32). CSF samples were randomly 
distributed across plates and measured in triplicate. The operator was blinded to the clinical 
information. Two dedicated CSF samples (ISs) consisting of pooled CSF were loaded onto 
all plates. To account for the interplate variability, all the measurements were expressed in 
relation to the IS with the highest sTREM2 concentration. The absolute values (ng/ml) are 
reported in Table 1, and the estimated absolute levels of CSF sTREM2 at different 5-year 
intervals of EYO are shown in fig. S1 and table S6; the results are similar to those for 
relative CSF sTREM2. The mean intraplate coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.1% (all 
triplicate measures had a CV of <15%), and the interplate CV for each of the IS was 11.0 
and 7.4%.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of demographic, clinical, and biochemical data between NCs and MCs were 
performed by Pearson’s χ2 tests, t tests, or Mann-Whitney tests, as appropriate. CSF 
sTREM2 values calculated by interpolation on the standard curve and normalized to an IS 
were subsequently square root–transformed to approach Gaussian normal distribution, where 
no significant deviation from normal was found after transformation (Shapiro-Wilk test, P = 
0.165). All subsequent analyses were done with the transformed CSF sTREM2 values.
To investigate the effect of mutation status (MCs versus NCs) on CSF sTREM2, we 
performed a linear mixed model regression analysis including the mutation status, age, 
gender, and APOE ε4 as independent fixed effects and family affiliation as a random 
intercept effect. APOE genotype was dichotomized into APOE ε4 carrier and noncarrier 
groups. In additional linear regression models, we compared the levels of CSF sTREM2 
between mutation subtypes including PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutations. The association 
between CSF sTREM2 levels and mean age of symptom onset caused by individual 
mutations on PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes [defined as the published mean age of 
symptom onset of a particular mutation (68)] was tested in a linear model adjusted for 
gender and APOE ε4 status.
To test how CSF sTREM2 and other biochemical, cognitive, and imaging markers change as 
a function of EYO (see Fig. 3 and Table 2), we used a similar approach to that previously 
published by Bateman et al. (2) for the sake of comparability of the current findings. That is, 
a linear mixed model with mutation status, EYO (and its interaction with mutation status),

 gender (fixed effects), and family affiliation (random effect) was computed for each of the 
markers and cognitive variables. Consistent with the approach by Bateman et al. (2), we 
performed a polynomial regression analysis including EYO quadratic (EYO2) and cubic 
(EYO3) terms and their interactions with mutation status. For each outcome variable, the 
model that best fitted the data was determined by forward selection of the predictors, and the 
final model was chosen on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (AIC; a lower AIC 
indicates a better fit; see table S7). To ensure that the results were not driven by extreme 
values of EYO, the analyses were repeated, this time excluding participants with EYO > +20 
(two NCs and one MC). The resulting models were similar to those calculated including 
these three participants. To determine differences in markers and clinical measurements 
between MCs and NCs at different EYOs, we computed the estimated levels of each variable 
at each 5-year interval of EYO on the basis of the established regression models. Group 
differences in the estimated values between MCs and NCs for each 5-year EYO interval 
were determined by t tests, as done by Bateman et al. (2). Consistent with the approach 
applied in previous DIAN studies (2, 59), comparisons between MCs and NCs were 
restricted at EYO ranging from −25 to +10, because of the low number of subjects at more 
extreme values of EYO (see Fig. 2). To assure that the sequence of marker changes was not 
dependent on our model selection procedure, we plotted the marker curves for each marker, 
with the model order (first, second, or third order) held constant across marker models (fig. 
S2). Table S8 depicts for each model order the earliest time point (EYO) at which a 
particular marker became different between MCs and NCs. The sequential order of marker 
changes remained consistent across different fixed model orders, confirming the robustness 
of our findings.
To plot the progression of CSF sTREM2 throughout the disease in the context of the other 
biomarkers and cognitive measures, we followed an approach first presented by Bateman et 
al. (2), that is, for each variable, the predicted difference between MCs and NCs at each 
EYO generated by the same final linear mixed effects model described above was divided by 
the SD of the respective variable within the pooled sample so that the scale of all variables 
was standardized (Fig. 3 and fig. S2). These figures were built with the SAS software (SAS 
Institute).
We compared CSF sTREM2 levels between NCs and MCs in different clinical stages 
(determined by global CDR) in a linear mixed model regression analysis adjusted for age, 
gender, APOE ε4 status, and education as independent fixed effects and family affiliation as 
random intercept. Individuals falling into CDR = 2 to CDR = 3 were grouped together 
because of the low number of subjects in these stages. Post hoc tests were used for pair-wise 
comparisons of CSF sTREM2 levels between CDR groups, using Bonferroni correction.
The association between CSF sTREM2 and the CSF core markers for AD (T-tau, P-tau181P, 
and Aβ1–42) was studied with a linear model adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 status. 
The analysis was performed in the whole sample of subjects and when stratifying for the 
mutation status. The standardized regression coefficients (β) are reported. To rule out that 
the associations were driven by extreme values, we performed the analysis both including or 
excluding outliers (defined as AD CSF core markers 3 SDs below or above the group mean), 
and the analysis yielded similar results.

 Fig. 1. Association of CSF sTREM2 with mutation status and age
(A) Comparison of CSF sTREM2 between NCs and MCs in the DIAN cohort. (B) 
Comparison of CSF sTREM2 in MC participants carrying a PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP 
mutation. PSEN2 MCs (black dots) were merged with PSEN1 MCs because of the low 
number of subjects. ns, nonsignificant. (C) Regression plot showing CSF sTREM2 as a 
function of the mean age of symptom onset for each individual mutation. (D) Regression 
plot showing CSF sTREM2 as a function of age in the NC and MC groups. The blue or red 
bars in (A) and (B) represent the mean and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Group 
comparisons were assessed by a linear mixed model adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 
status (fixed effects) and family affiliation (random effect). The solid lines in (C) and (D) 
indicate the regression line for each of the groups calculated by a linear model adjusted for 
gender and APOE ε4 status. The dashed lines indicate the 95% CI. The standardized 
regression coefficients (β) and the P values are also shown. In graph (D), the individual 
values are not shown to protect participants’ confidentiality.

 Fig. 2. CSF sTREM2 at specific EYOs
Estimated mean levels of CSF sTREM2 for NCs and MCs at successive 5-year intervals of 
EYO, based on the regression model that best fitted the data (see table S7 and “Statistical 
analysis”). The amount of CSF sTREM2 is expressed relative to an IS and has been square 
root–transformed (sqrt) to approach a Gaussian distribution. The error bars represent the SE. 
CSF sTREM2 was higher in MCs than in NCs from EYO = −5 to EYO = +5. **P < 0.01; 
***P < 0.001. The number (n) of NC and MC individuals studied for each EYO interval is 
tabulated below the x axis.

 Fig. 3. Cross-sectional comparison of CSF sTREM2, cognitive, structural, metabolic, and 
biochemical changes as a function of EYO
The graph represents the standardized differences between MCs and NCs as a function of 
EYO generated by the linear mixed effects model that best fit each marker (table S7). The 
order of differences suggests that the increase in CSF sTREM2 is preceded by changes in 
brain amyloidosis (that is, decreased CSF Aβ1–42 and fibrillar Aβ deposition) and alteration 
in brain injury markers (that is, CSF T-tau). Yet, CSF sTREM2 changes are concurrent with 
the first signs of cerebral hypometabolism, hippocampal atrophy, and clinical impairment. 
Individual data points are not displayed to prevent disclosure of mutation status. The shaded 
area indicates the EYO interval (from −5 to +5), in which CSF sTREM2 is increased in MCs 
compared to NCs.

 Fig. 4. Association between CSF sTREM2 and CSF core markers of AD
Scatter plots representing the associations of CSF sTREM2 with each of the CSF core 
markers of AD (T-tau, P-tau181P, and Aβ1–42) in all participants [green; (A) to (C)], in NCs 
[blue; (D) to (F)], and in MCs [red; (G) to (I)]. The solid lines indicate the regression line 
for each of the groups calculated by a linear model adjusted for age, gender, and APOE ε4 
status. The dashed lines depict the 95% CI. The standardized regression coefficients (β) and 
the P values are also shown. The sample contained some outliers (defined as 3 SDs below or 
above the group mean) of the CSF core markers of AD (2 T-tau and 1 P-tau181P value). To 
exclude that the associations were not driven by these extreme values, we performed the 
analysis with and without these values. The graphs are represented without the outliers.

(fixed effects) and family affiliation (random effect).

Table 2
Markers and clinical estimates in MCs and NCs as a function of EYO
Mean estimated levels of biomarkers, neuroimaging, and cognitive variables for each group and selected EYO. Estimates were obtained by a linear mixed 
model including mutation status, EYO (or higher-order terms and their interactions with mutation status), and gender as fixed effects and family affiliation 
as random effect. For each EYO, the group difference, 95% CI, and P value for the two-sample independent t test of each variable are reported. 
Differences are calculated from unrounded values. CSF sTREM2 is expressed relative to an IS and square root–transformed to approach a Gaussian 
distribution. Given that CSF sTREM2 levels are affected by age, we repeated the regression analysis introducing age as a covariate, and the pattern of 
group differences remained the same (table S3). Adjusting by APOE ε4 (table S4) or education (table S5) also yielded similar results. FDG,
