Cytomegalovirus(CMV)isthemostcommoninfectiouscauseofbraindefectsandneurologicaldysfunctionindevelopinghumanbabies.
Due to the teratogenicity and toxicity of available CMV antiviral agents, treatment options during early development are markedly
limited. Valnoctamide (VCD), a neuroactive mood stabilizer with no known teratogenic activity, was recently demonstrated to have
anti-CMV potential. However, it is not known whether this can be translated into an efficacious therapeutic effect to improve CMV-
induced adverse neurological outcomes. Using multiple models of CMV infection in the developing mouse brain, we show that subcuta-
neous low-dose VCD suppresses CMV by reducing the level of virus available for entry into the brain and by acting directly within the
brain to block virus replication and dispersal. VCD during the first 3 weeks of life restored timely acquisition of neurological milestones
in neonatal male and female mice and rescued long-term motor and behavioral outcomes in juvenile male mice. CMV-mediated brain
defects, including decreased brain size, cerebellar hypoplasia, and neuronal loss, were substantially attenuated by VCD. No adverse side
effectsonneurodevelopmentofuninfectedcontrolmicereceivingVCDweredetected.TreatmentofCMV-infectedhumanfetalastrocytes
with VCD reduced both viral infectivity and replication by blocking viral particle attachment to the cell, a mechanism that differs from
available anti-CMV drugs. These data suggest that VCD during critical periods of neurodevelopment can effectively suppress CMV
replication in the brain and safely improve both immediate and long-term neurological outcomes.

Introduction
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the developing brain can
cause a number of brain defects, including microcephaly, cortical
thinning, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Gandhi and Khanna, 2004;
Mocarski et al., 2007; Cheeran et al., 2009; Tsutsui, 2009). In the
United States, �30,000 children receive diagnoses of CMV infec-
tion every year, and lifelong neurological problems, including
cerebral palsy, seizures, motor impairment, intellectual disabil-

 ity, visual deficits, and deafness, will develop in one-fifth of these
children. This makes CMV the most common severely disabling
perinatal infectious agent (Kenneson and Cannon, 2007; James
and Kimberlin, 2016). A link between perinatal CMV infection
and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adolescents
has also been proposed (Stubbs et al., 1984; Yamashita et al.,
2003; Sakamoto et al., 2015; Garofoli et al., 2017). Another virus
that has recently raised considerable concern, and that can evoke
parallel dysfunction in the developing brain, is Zika virus; impor-
tantly, in the United States neurological dysfunction due to CMV
infections is �100-fold more prevalent than that from Zika virus
(Butler, 2016). CMV evokes more brain dysfunction than more
widely known diseases, including spina bifida, fetal alcohol syn-
drome, or Down’s syndrome (Cannon and Davis, 2005).
CMV can also generate problems in the CNS of adults with a
compromised immune system, including transplant recipients
and AIDS patients, who are at high risk for the development of
potentially life-threatening CNS complications (Mocarski et al.,
2007; Mercorelli et al., 2011). A key reason that CMV is particu-
larly damaging to the developing brain relates to the reduced
efficacy of the immature innate and systemic immune response
to CMV in the immature CNS (van den Pol et al., 2002, 2007;
Reuter et al., 2004).
Although drugs approved to treat CMV show some efficacy,
their use is not recommended during pregnancy or in the neona-
tal period due to potential teratogenicity, short-term and long-
term toxicity, and carcinogenicity. These serious side effects
relate to the mechanism of anti-CMV action, the inhibition of
DNA polymerase (Gandhi and Khanna, 2004; Mercorelli et al.,
2011; Rawlinson et al., 2016). The emergence of drug-resistant
CMV strains also poses a challenge (Mercorelli et al., 2011). No
effective CMV vaccine is currently available (James and Kimber-
lin, 2016; Rawlinson et al., 2016). Therefore, novel anti-CMV
strategies with alternative mechanisms of action and safer in vivo
profiles are urgently needed. Valnoctamide (VCD) has been mar-
keted since the early 1960s as an anxiolytic drug (Stepansky, 1960;
Goldberg, 1961) and subsequently was tested as a mood stabilizer
in patients with acute mania (Bersudsky et al., 2010). In animal
models, VCD shows efficacy in both attenuating epilepsy (Linde-
kens et al., 2000; Isoherranen et al., 2003; Mares
ˇ et al., 2013;
Pouliot et al., 2013; Shekh-Ahmad et al., 2014) and reducing
neuropathic pain (Winkler et al., 2005; Kaufmann et al., 2010), in
part by a mechanism that prolongs miniature IPSCs (Spampanato
and Dudek, 2014). VCD shows no teratogenic effects in developing
rodents (Radatz et al., 1998; Bersudsky et al., 2010; Shekh-Ahmad et
al., 2014; Mawasi et al., 2015; Wlodarczyk et al., 2015; Bialer et al.,
2017). Surprisingly, we recently found that VCD also inhibits CMV
outside the CNS (Ornaghi et al., 2016).
Here we asked whether low-dose VCD given subcutaneously
to CMV-infected neonatal mice can safely suppress CMV inside
the developing brain and exert beneficial effects on neurodevel-
opment and behavior. We infected newborn mice on the day of
birth (DOB) as a model where brain development in the newborn
mouse parallels human brain development during the early sec-
ond trimester of pregnancy (Clancy et al., 2001, 2007a,b; Branchi
et al., 2003; Workman et al., 2013). This is a critical period of
brain development where CMV can cause substantive dysfunc-
tion (Manicklal et al., 2013).
We show for the first time that VCD can protect the develop-
ing brain from CMV by both reducing the amount of virus en-
tering the brain and by blocking viral replication and dispersal
within the brain. VCD completely rescued the delayed acquisi-
tion of neurological milestones observed in infected neonatal
mice. VCD treatment exerted long-lasting beneficial effects, re-
storing normal motor and behavioral outcomes in adolescent
animals, and attenuating CMV-induced brain damage. VCD ad-
ministration during critical periods of mouse brain development
appeared safe and did not generate detectable adverse side effects
on the neurodevelopment of uninfected control mice.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines, viruses, and chemicals
Normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were obtained from Cambrex,
and primary human fetal brain astrocytes were obtained from ScienCell
Research Laboratories. HDF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin (Pen Strep; Invitrogen). Hu-
man fetal astrocytes were grown in poly-L-lysine-coated culture vessels and
maintained in Astrocyte Medium (from ScienCell Research Laboratories)
supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% Pen Strep. All cultures were kept in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.
For in vitro experiments, a recombinant human CMV (hCMV, Toledo
strain) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the
control of the EF1-� promoter (EGFP-hCMV) was used (Jarvis et al.,
1999). Normal human fibroblasts were used to test viral EGFP expres-
sion, replication capability, and propagation, and to determine viral ti-
ters by plaque assay (Vieira et al., 1998; Jarvis et al., 1999).
CMV replication is species specific, and to study CMV in vivo we used
a recombinant mouse CMV (mCMV; MC.55, K181 strain) that expresses
EGFP (van den Pol et al., 1999), as previously reported (Ornaghi et al.,
2016). NIH/3T3 cells (murine fibroblasts) were used for viral propaga-
tion and titering by plaque assay (van den Pol et al., 1999).
Recombinant CMVs were provided by Dr. E. Mocarski (Emory Univer-
sity, Atlanta, GA) and Dr. J. Vieira (University of Washington, Seattle, WA).
Green fluorescence was used to visualize infected cells and viral plaques.
Viral titers were determined by standard plaque assay using 25% carboxy-
methyl-cellulose (CMC) overlay (Zurbach et al., 2014). Viral stocks were
stored in aliquots at �80°C. For each experiment, a new aliquot of virus was
thawed and used.
Valnoctamide (catalog #V4765) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as
powder and was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to yield a 1 M
stock solution.
Quantification of infection
Effects of VCD on hCMV infection were assessed by viral infectivity assay
and viral yield reduction assay. For the infectivity assay, human fetal
astrocytes were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well in 48-well plates
and were incubated overnight before medium (0.2 ml/well) was replaced
for pretreatment with VCD or vehicle at 100 �M. After 1 h of drug
exposure, cells were inoculated with hCMV [multiplicity of infection
(MOI), 0.1] and incubated at 37°C for 2 h to allow viral adsorption.
Following incubation, cultures were washed twice with PBS and overlaid
with a viscous solution containing VCD/vehicle at 100 �M in supple-
mented astrocyte medium (75%) and CMC (25%). GFP-positive cells
were counted at 48 h postinfection (hpi).
In the virus yield reduction assay, after viral adsorption, cells were
washed twice with PBS and replenished with fresh medium containing
the compounds to be tested. At 72 hpi, medium was collected and titered
by plaque assay using HDF monolayers to assess the drug-mediated in-
hibition of virus replication in human fetal brain astrocytes.
The total number of fluorescent cells/plaques per well in each condi-
tion were counted using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope
(Olympus Optical) connected to a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic
Instruments) interfaced with an Apple Macintosh computer. Each con-
dition was tested in triplicate, and the whole experiment was repeated
twice. Camera settings (exposure time and gain) were held constant be-
tween images. The contrast and color of collected images were optimized
using Adobe Photoshop.
Viral entry analysis and quantitative real-time PCR assay
To evaluate the effects of VCD on hCMV attachment to human fetal
astrocytes, prechilled cultures at 90% confluency in a six-well plate were
treated with VCD or vehicle (100 �M) for 1 h at 4°C, followed by infection

Ornaghi et al. • Valnoctamide Blocks CMV in Developing Brain
 with precooled hCMV-GFP (MOI, 0.1). After 2 h of incubation at 4°C,
fetal astrocytes were rinsed three times with cold PBS to remove unat-
tached virions then were harvested by trypsinization for viral DNA quan-
tification using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay (Chan
and Yurochko, 2014). To assess hCMV internalization into fetal astro-
cytes, cultures plated in plain media were inoculated with hCMV-GFP
(MOI, 0.1) and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. Cells were then washed three
times to remove unbound viral particles and were exposed to VCD or
vehicle at 100 �M for 2 h at 37°C (to allow virus internalization) before
being harvested by trypsinization for DNA quantification by qRT-PCR.
DNA was extracted from cells using the QIAamp DNA mini kit
(Qiagen), and qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan assays (Life Tech-
nologies; Gault et al., 2001; Fukui et al., 2008) for hCMV UL132
(Pa03453400_s1) and human albumin (Hs99999922_s1) genes, as previ-
ously described (Ornaghi et al., 2016). Samples from uninfected cells and
without a template served as negative controls. Samples were run in dupli-
cate using a Bio-Rad iCycler-IQ instrument, and results were analyzed with
iCycler software. The amount of viral DNA in each sample relative to albu-
min was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method, and
hCMV DNA was expressed as the percentage of virus bound (the “attach-
ment”step)orinternalized(the“internalization”step)usingDMSO-treated
samples as 100%.
Animal procedures
All animal breeding and experiments were performed in accordance with
the guidelines of the Yale School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC). Research was approved by the IACUC.
Male and female BALB/c strain mice (6–8 weeks of age) from Taconic
Biosciences were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle under constant
temperature (22 � 2°C) and humidity (55 � 5%), with access to food
and water ad libitum. One to two females were cohabited with a male of
the same strain for at least 1 week to ensure fertilization. When advanced
pregnancy was seen, each pregnant female was caged singularly and
checked for delivery twice daily, at 8:30 A.M. and 6:30 P.M. Here we focus
on inoculation of the newborn mouse, similar to the strategy we recently
described for studying the actions of Zika virus in the developing mouse
brain (van den Pol et al., 2017).
Paradigms of mCMV infection. Newborns were inoculated intraperito-
neally with 750 pfu of mCMV-GFP in 50 �l of media on the DOB within
14 h of delivery. The DOB was considered to be postnatal day 0 (P0).
Control animals received 50 �l of media intraperitoneally. To avoid any
litter-size effect, large litters were culled to a maximum of eight to nine
pups (Tanaka, 1998). Infected and control pups were randomly assigned
to receive VCD or vehicle (DMSO) via subcutaneous injections, once a
day, at a dose of 1.4 mg/ml in 20 �l of saline (28 �g/mouse), starting after
virus inoculation and running from P1 to P21. Mice were monitored
daily for signs of mCMV-induced disease and to determine survival;
weaning occurred on P21 and mice of either sex were housed separately
until testing was completed, then killed.
In addition to the intraperitoneal route, intracranial injection was
performed in a group of newborn mice. Three days after birth, 2 � 10 4
pfu of mCMV-GFP in 1 �l of media was injected into the left cerebral
hemisphere of neonatal mice under cryoanesthesia using a 10 �l Hamil-
ton syringe with a 32-gauge needle from a midpoint between the ear and
eye. Infected pups were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of VCD or
vehicle (DMSO), starting 3 h after virus inoculation until P8. No deaths
occurred, and at P9 mice were killed and blood, liver, spleen, and brain were
collected, snap frozen, and stored at �80°C until viral titer analysis via qRT-
PCR (n � 8/experimental group) was performed.
Early neurobehavioral assessment. Intraperitoneally infected pups and
controls were assessed for neurobehavioral development according to a
slightly modified Fox battery, as previously described (Fox, 1965; St
Omer et al., 1991; Calamandrei et al., 1999). Evaluation was performed
without knowledge of the experimental group on every other day from
P2 to P14, in the light phase of the circadian cycle between 9:00 A.M. and
3:00 P.M. Each subject was tested at approximately the same time of the
day. Reflexes and responses were scored in the following order: righting
reflex, the time used by the pup to turn upright with all four feet when
placed on its back; cliff aversion, when placed on the edge of a cliff or table
top with the forepaws and face over the edge, the mouse will turn and
crawl away from the edge; Forelimb grasping reflex, when the forefoot is
stroked with a blunt instrument the foot will flex to grasp the instrument;
forelimb placing reflex, contact of the dorsum of the foot against the edge
of an object will cause the foot to raise and place itself on the surface of the
object when the animal is suspended and no other foot is in contact with
a solid surface; negative geotaxis, the time used by the pup to turn �180°
to either side when placed head down on a wire mesh screen (4 � 4 mm)

by the tail and lowered so that the vibrissae make contact with a solid object,
the head is raised and the forelimbs are extended to grasp the object.
Latencies were measured in seconds using a stopwatch for righting
reflex and negative geotaxis. The remaining behavioral variables were
rated semiquantitatively in the following way: 0 � no response or occur-
rence of the event (R/O); 1 � slight/uncertain R/O; 2 � incomplete R/O;
and 3 � a complete adult-like R/O. All timed responses were limited to a
maximum of 60 s; therefore, the absence of a milestone was scored as
0/60 s (semiquantitative rating/latencies) if the mouse did not exhibit
the behavior within 60 s.
This battery of tests provides a detailed assessment of functional and
neurobehavioral development throughout the neonatal period since the
behaviors measured are each expressed at different stages of development
during the first weeks of life. Specific information about vestibular func-
tion, motor development and activity, coordination, and muscle strength
can be obtained by execution of these tests (St Omer et al., 1991; Sch-
neider and Przewlocki, 2005).
Evaluation of motor coordination and balance in adolescent mice. Motor
performance of infected and control mice, with or without VCD treat-
ment, was assessed at P28–P30 by the hindlimb-clasping, vertical pole,
and challenging beam traversal tests.
In the hindlimb-clasping test, the mouse is gently lifted by the tail,
grasped near its base, and the hindlimb position is observed for 10 s and
scored as follows: if the hindlimbs are consistently splayed outward, away
from the abdomen, it is assigned a score of 0; if one hindlimb is retracted
toward the abdomen for �50% of the time suspended, it receives a score
of 1; if both hindlimbs are partially retracted toward the abdomen for
�50% of the time suspended, it receives a score of 2; and if its hindlimbs
are entirely retracted and touching the abdomen for �50% of the time
suspended, it receives a score of 3 (Tanaka et al., 2004; Guyenet et al.,
2010).
The vertical pole test was conducted according to previously estab-
lished protocols (Ogawa et al., 1985; Soerensen et al., 2008). Briefly, mice
were individually placed head downward at the top of a vertical rough-
surfaced pole (diameter, 8 mm; height, 55 cm) and allowed to descend in
a round of habituation. Then, mice were placed head upward at the top of
the pole. The time required for the animal to descend to the floor was
recorded as the locomotor activity time (TLA), with a maximum duration
of 120 s. If a mouse fell, was unable to turn downward, or was unable to
climb down, a default locomotor activity time value was recorded as
120 s. Each mouse was given three trials with a 30 s recovery period
between trials.
The challenging beam traversal test was performed as previously de-
scribed (Fleming et al., 2004, 2013). The beam consisted of four sections
(25 cm each, 1 m total length), each section having a different width. The
beam started at a width of 3.5 cm and gradually narrowed to 0.5 cm in the
last section. Underhanging ledges (1 cm width) were placed 1.0 cm below
the top surface of the beam to increase the sensitivity of the test and allow
detection of subtle motor deficits (Brooks and Dunnett, 2009). Animals
were trained to traverse the length of the beam starting at the widest
section and ending at the narrow most difficult section. The narrow end
of the beam led directly into the home cage of the animal. A bright light
illuminated the start of the beam to further encourage the mouse to walk
across the beam toward the home cage. Animals received 2 d of training
before testing, with five trials for each day. On the day of the test, a mesh
grid (1 cm squares) of corresponding width was placed over the beam

 surface leaving a 1 cm space between the grid
and the beam surface. Animals were then vid-
eotaped while traversing the grid-surfaced
beam for a total of five trials. Videos were
viewed and rated in slow motion for hindlimb
slips and time to traverse across five trials by an
investigator blind to the mouse experimental
group. A slip was counted when the mouse was
facing and moving forward and a hindlimb
slipped through or outside of the grid beyond
0.5 cm below the grid surface (halfway down).
Exploratory activity and social behavior anal-
ysis. The exploratory activity was assessed in
adolescent mice at P30–P40 in an adapted
small open field, as previously described (Shi et
al., 2003; Schneider and Przewlocki, 2005). The
apparatus consisted of a plastic rectangular box
measuring 20.5 � 17 � 13 cm 3 (l � width �
height) with regularly spaced holes in the short
(2) and long (3) walls, and illuminated by am-
bient fluorescent ceiling lights. The animal was
placed in the center of the apparatus and its
movements were video recorded over a 3 min
period. Exploratory behavior was scored for
the number of rearing and nose-poking (nose
of an animal put inside the hole) episodes.
Sociability and preference for social novelty
were investigated at 5 weeks of age in a three-
compartment apparatus (Crawley, 2007; Yang
et al., 2011). Initially, test and control animals
were allowed to explore the apparatus freely for
a 10 min period (habituation). For the social
approach paradigm, an unfamiliar conspecific
(same sex, similar age and weight) animal was
placed into one of the side compartments and
restrained by a small wire object (“social
cage”). The compartment on the other side
contained an empty wire object (“empty
cage”). The test subject was then released into
the center compartment and allowed to ex-
plore the three-compartment apparatus freely
for 10 min. Behavior was videotaped and as-
sessed for the times that the test subject spent in
the three compartments and in close proximity
to the social and empty cages. For the social-
novelty paradigm, another unfamiliar conspe-
cific animal was placed in the previously empty
wire object (“novel cage”). The behavior of the
test mouse was recorded for 10 min and as-
sessed for the time spent exploring the known
and novel conspecifics.
Assessment of mCMV distribution in the brain
and viral-mediated brain abnormalities. At spe-
cific time points after infection, mice were
killed by an overdose of anesthetic and tran-
scardially perfused with sterile, cold PBS fol-
lowed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were harvested and weighed.
Brains were then immersed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and
cryoprotected in 15% and then 30% sucrose for 24 h before inclusion in
Tissue Freezing Medium (General Data). Some intraperitoneally in-
fected mice became dehydrated and moribund and showed no sign of
recovery; these mice were killed before the predefined killing time points
and were recorded as having had a lethal response to the virus.
Fifteen-micrometer-thick sections cut with a Leica cryostat were used
for GFP reporter expression assessment and immunofluorescence anal-
ysis in the brain. Sections were dried for 4 h at room temperature, rehy-
drated in 1� PBS, and then used for immunofluorescence assays. Briefly,
tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with monoclonal mouse
anti-NeuN antibody (1:500; catalog #MAB377, EMD Millipore; RRID:
AB_2298772) for neuronal cells and polyclonal rabbit anti-calbindin
D-28K (1:500; catalog #AB1778, EMD Millipore; RRID: AB_2068336)
for cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Tissues were washed three times in
phosphate buffer plus 0.4% Triton X-100. Secondary antibodies, includ-
ing goat anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa
Fluor-594 (1:250; Invitrogen), were applied for 1 h at room temperature
and then washed off. Some sections were labeled with DAPI. Vectashield
Fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) was then used for
mounting.
Images were collected by using a fluorescence microscope (model IX
71, Olympus Optical).
Frozen sections were used for morphometric measurements, and cell
numbers were quantified after imaging using ImageJ software (https://
imagej.nih.gov/ij/; RRID: SCR_003070). The molecular layer (ML) and

 internal granular layer (IGL) were assessed using images of serial mid-
sagittal cerebellar sections stained with calbindin D-28K and DAPI. Three
measurements were taken at each side of the primary fissure in each section,
and four sections per animal were evaluated. For the cerebellar area, mid-
sagittalbrainsections(threesections/mouse)werestainedwithbluefluores-
cent Nissl stain (NeuroTrace, catalog #N21479, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and images were collected using a 2� objective. Cell counts were performed
on sections (four sections/mouse) stained with calbindin D-28K, and the
number of Purkinje cells was evaluated along 500 �m of the primary fissure
(both sides). All measurements and quantifications were performed on at
least five animals from three different litters.
Kinetics of virus spread and replication in vivo. For measurement of
mCMV replication in blood, liver, spleen, and brain, mCMV-infected
mice receiving either VCD or vehicle intraperitoneally or intracranially
were killed at multiple time points postinoculation, and samples were
collected under sterile conditions, snap frozen, and stored at �80°C until
viral titer analysis via quantitative real-time PCR (n � 7–10/experimen-
tal group) was performed. Mice used for viral load analysis in liver,

reaction mixtures using the iTaq Universal SYBR Probes Supermix (Bio-
Rad) and 100 ng of DNA. Samples were run in duplicate using a two-step
amplification protocol. Tissue samples from uninfected mice and sam-
ples without a template served as negative controls. Viral burden was
expressed as the copy number per ml per gram blood/tissue after com-
parison with a standard curve generated using serial 10-fold dilutions of
mCMV DNA.
Experimental design and statistical analysis
Statistical significance, unless otherwise specified, was determined by
one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Bonferroni’s and
Dunn’s post hoc test, respectively, for evaluation of motor performance,
exploratory behavior, and brain morphometry. Early neurobehavioral
development, social behavior, and viral load over time were assessed by a
mixed-model ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Newman–
Keuls test if there was a significant F value. Since no gender-related
differences were detected in early neurodevelopment, data from male
and female mice were combined. Only male mice were used for exami-
nation of motor performance and exploratory and social behavior. All
analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (RRID:
SCR_002798), with significance set at p � 0.05. Neurobehavioral assess-
ment was performed blindly with respect to the experimental group.
Results
Peripheral inoculation of CMV causes widespread infection
of the developing brain
First, we characterized the kinetics of CMV replication and dis-
semination after intraperitoneal inoculation of the virus in
newborn mice on the DOB (P0). Forty-eight hours after intra-
peritoneal injection, CMV was found in the blood and at lower
levels in the spleen and liver of infected mice, with only a small
amount detected in the brain (Fig. 1A). Analysis of viral kinetics
in these four organs over the course of 50 d revealed that CMV,
after entering the bloodstream, quickly gained access to periph-
eral target organs (i.e., the liver and spleen) and began replicating
to yield high viral titers by 4 d post-injection (dpi; Fig. 1B–D). In

 turn, similar viral titers were measured in the brain only after 8
dpi (Fig. 1E). After entering the brain, the virus could effectively
replicate in situ, as suggested by the measurement of CMV loads
similar to those found in the liver and spleen at the viral peak
between P8 and P12 (Fig. 1C–E).
Upon histological examination, CMV-GFP infection of the
developing mouse brain appeared widespread and scattered in
nature. Isolated infected cells and infectious foci containing up to
20–25 cells could be found in multiple distant areas within the
same brain. The pattern of infection also appeared heteroge-
neous, with different brains displaying infection in different re-
gions. These observations are consistent with a hematogenous
spread of CMV from the periphery into the developing brain of
neonatal mice. Infected cells were identified in the olfactory bulb
and nuclei, the cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, basal nu-
clei, choroid plexus, midbrain, superior and inferior colliculi,
sylvian aqueduct, pons, medulla, cerebellum, and meninges (Fig.
2A–I). No CMV was detected in the spinal cord. Infection of the
choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles was frequently associated
with evidence of infected cells in the brain parenchyma in close
proximity to the ventricle (Fig. 2E,F), a site of neural progenitor
stem cell localization (Semple et al., 2013). Infection of certain
brain areas, such as the thalamus and the hypothalamus, was
observed less frequently compared with other regions, including
the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex. The cerebellum was
the only site consistently displaying viral infection in all the brains
examined (n � 20), with robust GFP labeling in both Purkinje
cells and granule neurons (Fig. 3A,B). Viral GFP was also iden-
tified in neurons of the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex
(Fig. 3C–G). In cortical pyramidal cells, GFP was seen in both the

 apical dendrite extending toward the cortical surface and in basal
dendrites ramifying closer to the cell body. Some infected neu-
rons in the cortex displayed signs of degeneration, characterized
by abnormal swelling along the dendrites (Fig. 3F).
Together, these results indicate that intraperitoneally admin-
istered CMV, after replicating in peripheral target organs, enters
the developing brain of neonatal mice via the bloodstream or
immune cells in the blood, producing a scattered and widespread
infection with a highly heterogeneous pattern of propagation.
Nonetheless, CMV appears to display a particular preference for
the cerebellum as an infectious site.
Subcutaneous valnoctamide blocks CMV replication within
the brain
Mice were infected intraperitoneally on the day of birth, and we
compared the brains of infected mice treated subcutaneously
with VCD with nontreated CMV-infected mice. CMV load in the
brain was quantified at multiple time points after virus inocula-
tion. Cerebrum (cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus,
and striatum) and cerebellum were assessed separately to deter-
mine whether the viral preference for the cerebellar region, as
observed in the brain section analysis, was also accompanied by
higher levels of virus replication. VCD decreased the amount of
virus detected in both the cerebrum and cerebellum by a very
substantial amount, with an �100- to 1000-fold decrease at all
time points tested (Fig. 4A,B). The anti-CMV effect displayed a
rapid onset, suppressing the viral load after only 1 and 3 d of
treatment in the cerebellum and the cerebrum, respectively. In
untreated infected mice, higher viral titers were identified in cer-
ebellar samples compared with cerebrum at the beginning of
infection (P4: t � 3.704, p � 0.004, paired Student’s t test), sug-
gesting that the cerebellum may represent a preferential site for
initial CMV targeting in the brain. These data indicate that VCD
can attenuate CMV infection detected in the brain. The observed
antiviral effect of VCD in the CNS could be the consequence of a
drug-mediated decrease in viral replication in the periphery.
Along this line, we corroborated (Ornaghi et al., 2016) that VCD
also attenuated CMV in the blood, liver, and spleen, starting
quickly after therapy initiation and continuing to the end of the
experiment (Fig. 4C–E). This reduction of CMV outside the brain
would benefit the brain by reducing the amount of virus that
ultimately can enter the CNS.
To investigate whether VCD can act directly in the brain to
decrease CMV, we infected pups on P3 by direct intracranial
virus inoculation. Analysis of CMV load in the blood, liver, and
spleen of untreated infected mice at P9 showed no viral spread
outside the CNS (data not shown). Viral titers in the cerebrum
and the cerebellum were substantially lower by �100-fold in
CMV-infected animals receiving VCD treatment compared with
untreated CMV-infected mice (2.99 � 10 5 � 9.06 � 10 4 vs
2.47 � 10 8 � 1.22 � 10 8 copy number/g tissue, p � 0.004 in
cerebrum; 2.88 � 10 6 � 1.83 � 10 6 vs 3.41 � 10 8 � 1.52 � 10 8
copy number/g tissue, p � 0.0003 in cerebellum; Mann–Whitney
U test; Fig. 5). These results indicate that subcutaneously admin-
istered low-dose VCD can enter the brain at sufficient concentra-
tions to effectively suppress CMV replication in situ.
Reversal of early neurological dysfunction in CMV-infected
neonatal mice
Human infants with CMV infection during early development
can display substantial delays in the acquisition of neurological
milestones during the first months of life (Dollard et al., 2007;
Kimberlin et al., 2015). Since VCD showed a robust antiviral
activity in the CNS of infected mice with a rapid attenuation of
viral replication, we investigated whether this would translate
into a positive therapeutic effect on the early neurological out-
comes of neonatal mice.
Neurobehavioral assessments were performed using a battery
of tests to examine body righting and tactile reflexes, motor co-
ordination, and muscular strength. These tests provide a detailed
examination of neurontogeny throughout the neonatal period
since the behaviors measured are each expressed at different pe-
riods during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life (Fox, 1965; Scattoni
et al., 2008).
Here and in a number of experiments below, we compared
neurological function in the following four groups of mice: non-
infected controls; VCD-treated non-infected controls; CMV-
infected mice; and CMV-infected mice treated with VCD. VCD
was administered in a single daily subcutaneous dose (for addi-
tional details, see Materials and Methods).
CMV infection on the day of birth induced abnormal acqui-
sition of all the neurological milestones assessed, with infected
mice showing a delay of 6–10 d in the demonstration of re-
sponses similar to the uninfected controls (Fig. 6A–H). In
turn, infected VCD-treated neonatal pups displayed a timely
acquisition of neurological milestones in all the behaviors
measured. No differences were identified in the early neuron-
togeny of uninfected mice receiving VCD or vehicle. Together,
these data indicate that VCD treatment during early develop-
ment can safely improve the short-term neurodevelopmental
outcomes observed in infected neonatal mice.
Amelioration of long-term neurobehavioral outcomes in
infected juvenile mice
CMV infected infants with evidence of neurological delays during
the neonatal period are at increased risk of the development of
long-term permanent neurological and behavioral sequelae,
which manifest with a delayed onset after the first years of life
(James and Kimberlin, 2016). Abnormal motor function is a

 commonly observed long-term neurolog-
ical complication (Turner et al., 2014).
More recently, a link between ASD-like
behavioral disturbances in children and
adolescents and CMV infection during
early development has been proposed
(Sakamoto et al., 2015; Garofoli et al.,
2017). Given the substantial improve-
ment induced by VCD in the early neu-
rontogeny of CMV-infected neonatal
mice, we examined whether these beneficial
effects could also ameliorate late-onset neu-
robehavioral abnormalities, including mo-
tor performance and social and exploratory
behavior.
Motor performance
As indicated above, the cerebellum ap-
pears to be a preferential site for CMV
targeting in the mouse brain. We investi-
gated cerebellar-mediated motor func-
tions in infected and control juvenile mice
using a hindlimb-clasping test, a vertical
pole test, and a challenging beam traversal
test (Brooks and Dunnett, 2009; Guyenet
et al., 2010; Fleming et al., 2013).
The hindlimb clasping test is a marker
of cerebellar pathology commonly used
for severity scoring in mouse models of
cerebellar degeneration (Guyenet et al.,
2010). The majority of the CMV-infected
mice (9 of 13 mice) displayed an abnor-
mal response to the clasping test, with
both hindlimbs partially or entirely re-
tracted to the abdomen when the mice
were suspended by their tail for 10 s (Fig.
7A,B). VCD administration completely
reversed this altered behavior, restoring
a response similar to the uninfected
counterparts.
By placing a mouse head upward on a
vertical wooden pole, the vertical pole test
allows for the examination of the ability of
the animal to turn through 180° and suc-
cessfully climb down the pole (Brooks and
Dunnett, 2009). CMV-infected, untreated
juvenile mice required a longer period to
complete the task compared with both
uninfected controls and CMV-infected
VCD-treated animals (Fig. 7C). Three of
20 infected mice (15%) without treatment
failed the test (e.g., showed an inability to
turn the head downward or falling) in all
of the three trials given, whereas no VCD-
treated infected mice or uninfected con-
trols failed in performing the task (p �
0.03, � 2 test).
In addition, we evaluated fine motor
coordination and balance by the challeng-
ing beam traversal test, which assesses the
ability of a mouse to maintain balance
while traversing a narrow, 1-m-long beam

 to reach a safe platform (Carter et al.,
2001; Brooks and Dunnett, 2009; Luong et
al., 2011; Fleming et al., 2013). CMV in-
fection during early development in-
creased the time needed by the mice to
cross the beam and also the frequency of
slipping (Fig. 7D,E). VCD treatment sig-
nificantly improved the coordination and
balance of CMV-infected mice, reducing
both the beam traversal time and the
number of slips recorded.
Social and exploratory behavior
ASD is characterized by pervasive impair-
ments in social interactions coupled with
restricted and repetitive behaviors and de-
creased exploratory activity (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). To investi-
gate whether adolescent mice with perina-
tal CMV infection would display social
and exploratory behavioral disturbances,
we assessed social interaction and novel
environment exploration by means of the
three-chamber test and an adapted small
open field test.
Infected untreated mice showed nor-
mal sociability when exposed to a first
stranger mouse, preferring the conspecific
over the empty cage (novel object; Fig.
8A). However, a lack of preference for so-
cial novelty was found when a second
stranger mouse was introduced, with in-
fected untreated mice spending an equal
amount of time in investigating the
known and the novel animal (Fig. 8B).
VCD therapy restored social novelty re-
sponses similar to levels shown in unin-
fected
controls,
with
increased
time
devoted to examining the second stranger
mouse.
Exploratory activity was assessed by
quantifying the number of rearings and
nose pokings of mice exposed to a novel
environment over a 3 min test session
(Fig. 8C,D). A substantial reduction in
both rearing and hole-poking events was
identified in CMV-infected untreated
mice compared with control animals.
Normal levels of exploratory activity were
restored in infected mice receiving VCD
treatment.
Valnoctamide attenuates CMV-induced
brain defects in early development
Early-onset neurodevelopmental delays
and long-term permanent neurobehavioral disabilities are com-
monly observed in CMV-infected babies with evidence of virally
induced brain abnormalities, including decreased brain size and
cerebellar hypoplasia (Gandhi and Khanna, 2004; de Vries et al.,
2004; Cheeran et al., 2009; Oosterom et al., 2015; James and
Kimberlin, 2016). Since VCD showed a potent and fast-acting
anti-CMV activity in the brains of infected mice and appeared
beneficial to both short- and long-term neurobehavioral out-
comes, we investigated whether drug treatment during early de-
velopment could also exert therapeutic actions on CMV-induced
brain defects.
Brain size was analyzed in 1-month-old-mice by assessing the
brain-to-body weight ratio (Fig. 9A,B). This measurement al-
lows a more objective evaluation of the postnatal brain growth,

 compared with absolute brain weight, when somatic growth re-
striction is present. Subcutaneous VCD rescued the deficient
brain growth induced by CMV, restoring brain-to-body weight
ratio values similar to those in uninfected control mice.
Hypoplasia of the cerebellum is a
common radiological finding in CMV-
infected human babies (de Vries et al.,
2004; Oosterom et al., 2015). A temporary
delay in early postnatal cerebellar devel-
opment was reported in newborn mice in-
jected intraperitoneally with low titers of
CMV (Koontz et al., 2008). In our in-
fected mice, we identified the cerebellum
as a preferential site for viral localization
in the brain. We examined cerebellar
anatomy and histology in control and in-
fected mice with or without VCD therapy.
CMV infection of the developing brain re-
sulted in the disruption of cerebellar de-
velopment, with a 60% decrease in the
total area of this region compared with
uninfected controls (F � 8.56, p � 0.001
ANOVA; Fig. 10A,B). CMV-infected
mice displayed a substantial loss of PCs
and a thinner ML, which contains PC
dendritic trees, parallel fibers of the gran-
ule cells, Bergmann glia radial processes,
and basket and stellate cells (Fig. 10C–E).
Reduced thickness of the cerebellar IGL
was also found (Fig. 10F). PCs were not
only decreased in number but also
misplaced (Fig. 10G). In addition, the ex-
ternal granular layer (EGL), normally un-
detectable after P21 in rodent brains
(Ferguson, 1996), could still be identified
in CMV-infected untreated mice at P30,
whereas no EGL was visible in controls
(Fig. 10H). Alignment of PCs and matu-
ration of their dendritic trees, as well as
granule cell precursor proliferation and
inward migration from the EGL to the
IGL, occur during the first 3 postnatal
weeks of life in rodents (Inouye and Mu-
rakami, 1980; Ferguson, 1996). VCD
treatment rescued the altered cerebellar
development of infected animals, restor-
ing normal cortical layer thickness and
representation and markedly increasing
PC number (Fig. 10C–H). These drug-
mediated positive effects ultimately re-
sulted in normalization of cerebellar size
(Fig. 10A,B). No adverse side effects on
either brain growth or morphometric pa-
rameters were detected in uninfected con-
trols receiving VCD compared with their
vehicle-treated counterparts.
Block of CMV infection in human fetal
brain cells
Mouse and human forms of CMV share a
close similarity in their viral genomes, but
each retains species specificity (Rawlinson
et al., 1996; Mocarski et al., 2007). In the
experiments above, we used mCMV in mice. Here, to corrobo-
rate that the results we found above in our in vivo model with
mCMV generalize to hCMV, we examined the actions of VCD
on hCMV-infected human fetal astrocytes, a common cellular
Figure8.

 target that can play an important role in virus dispersal in the
brain (Lokensgard et al., 1999; van den Pol et al., 1999). VCD
substantially decreased hCMV infectivity of human fetal astro-
cytes as assessed by quantification of cells expressing the CMV-
GFP-reporter (Fig. 11A). Viral replication was also diminished in
the presence of the drug, with a reduction in viral titer by �100-
fold (4.92 � 10 5 � 5.84 � 10 4 pfu/ml in vehicle-treated cultures
vs 6.31 � 10 3 � 3.06 � 10 3 pfu/ml in VCD-treated cultures; p �
0.0001, Mann–Whitney U test; Fig. 11B).
VCD appears to act at an early stage of hCMV infection in
fibroblasts and has no antiviral effect on the unrelated vesicular
stomatitis virus (Ornaghi et al., 2016). To determine which step
of the hCMV replication cycle was inhibited by VCD in human
fetal astrocytes, we used a series of experiments to assess virus
attachment to the cellular surface and penetration into the cyto-
plasmic space. This was accomplished by shifting the incubation
temperature from 4°C (which allows virus attachment but not
fusion and internalization) to 37°C (which allows virus fusion
and internalization; Mocarski et al., 2007; Chan and Yurochko,
2014). Viral genome quantification by qRT-PCR showed that
VCD appeared to block hCMV attachment to fetal astrocytes
(Fig. 11C). In the presence of VCD, the amount of virus bound to
the cell surface was decreased by 60% compared with control
cultures not treated with VCD (p � 0.0007, unpaired Student’s
t test). VCD did not appear to block hCMV fusion/internaliza-
tion in the astrocytes. This also corroborates that the mechanism
of VCD block of CMV occurs at an early stage of infection and
appears unrelated to the genomic mechanisms of other approved
anti-CMV compounds.
Discussion
Our data show that low-dose VCD administered outside the
brain during early development effectively suppresses CMV in-
side the brain of infected mice via two different sites of action.
One is that VCD reduces peripheral levels of CMV, thereby de-
creasing the amount of virus available for entry into the brain. A
second is that VCD acts directly within the brain to block existing
brain CMV infection. These results are consistent with anti-CMV
activity of VCD outside the brain (Ornaghi et al., 2016). Impor-
tantly, the antiviral action of VCD begins shortly after adminis-
tration and effectively attenuates CMV levels throughout the
brain during the critical period of postnatal brain development.
This decrease in viral load is accompanied by a concomitant res-
toration of normal early neurological outcomes in infected
neonatal mice treated with VCD. Late-onset neurobehavioral
dysfunction, including motor impairment and social and explor-
atory behavior disturbances, as well as virally induced deficient
brain growth and disrupted cerebellar development, are substan-
tially attenuated in CMV-infected adolescent mice, which re-
ceived VCD during the neonatal period, suggesting long-lasting
beneficial effects. We detected no adverse collateral effects on the
neurodevelopment of uninfected control mice treated with VCD.
An important underlying rationale of our study is that the
newborn mouse brain is substantially less developed than the
newborn human brain. Based on the timing of the brain growth
spurt, initial neurogenesis, establishment and refinement of con-
nections, myelination, and gliogenesis, the mouse CNS at birth is
proposed to parallel the early second-trimester human fetal CNS
(Clancy et al., 2001, 2007a,b; Branchi et al., 2003; Workman et al.,
2013). This is a critical period for human brain development and
for hCMV infection (Manicklal et al., 2013). By infecting mouse
pups on the day of birth, this animal model provides an informa-
tive means to study the effects of CMV on the developing brain.
Infected newborn mice display similar brain pathology and neu-
rological symptoms to that reported in congenitally infected hu-
man infants, including microcephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia,
neuronal loss, neurodevelopmental delays, motor impairments,
and behavioral disturbances (Perlman and Argyle, 1992; de Vries
et al., 2004; Pass et al., 2006; Lipitz et al., 2013; Kimberlin et al.,
2015; De Kegel et al., 2016; James and Kimberlin, 2016). These
data support the validity of this in vivo model for investigating
CMV infection and novel anti-CMV treatments during early
brain development.
Despite being partially effective, currently available CMV an-
tiviral agents, including ganciclovir and its prodrug valganciclo-
vir, foscarnet, cidofovir, and fomivirsen, display both toxic and
teratogenic actions (Mercorelli et al., 2011; James and Kimberlin,
2016). For this reason, they are not approved or recommended
for the treatment of pregnant women or infected fetuses or neo-
nates, thus depriving those who may need it the most, or at best
delaying treatment and hindering potential prevention or ame-
lioration of CMV-induced brain defects during early develop-
ment (Kimberlin et al., 2015). Because less severely infected
human infants are also at risk for late-onset neurological compli-

 cations including cognitive and motor disabilities, behavioral
disturbances, visual deficits, and hearing impairment (James and
Kimberlin, 2016), the development of anti-CMV compounds
with safer in vivo profiles that can be used in all infected neonates
would be of substantive benefit.
VCD has shown no teratogenic or toxic activity in several
studies using different animal models of early development (Ra-
datz et al., 1998; Shekh-Ahmad et al., 2014; Mawasi et al., 2015;
Wlodarczyk et al., 2015) and has been safely used for many years
to treat neuropsychiatric disorders in adults (Stepansky, 1960;
Goldberg, 1961; Harl, 1964). Further confirmation of its safety
profile has derived from preclinical and clinical investigations of
drug-mediated anti-convulsant and mood-stabilizing actions
(Barel et al., 1997; Lindekens et al., 2000; Isoherranen et al., 2003;
Winkler et al., 2005; Bersudsky et al., 2010; Kaufmann et al., 2010;

level, a slightly reduced level of efficacy compared with ganci-
clovir (Ornaghi et al., 2016); nonetheless, we found substan-
tial CMV inhibition in vivo with subcutaneous delivery. We

 focused on newborn mice and identified potent anti-CMV
actions of VCD; further studies focusing on VCD anti-CMV
efficacy in fetal development and on the inhibition of trans-
placental transmission leading to brain infection will be
beneficial.
The species specificity of CMV replication prevents testing the
activity of novel antiviral agents on hCMV in animal models
(Mocarski et al., 2007). Murine and human CMV share similar
genomes, and anti-CMV drugs effective against mCMV are likely
to also be active against hCMV (Rawlinson et al., 1996). The
attenuation of hCMV infection of human fetal astrocytes by VCD
corroborates the utility of our in vivo mouse model and suggests
that VCD should also be effective against hCMV in the develop-
ing and adult human brain. In addition, VCD appears to act by
blocking hCMV attachment to the cell membrane as described
here in fetal astrocytes and previously in non-brain cells (Ornaghi
et al., 2016), a mechanism of action that is different from that of
currently available hCMV antiviral agents (Mercorelli et al.,
2011). This also suggests the potential of VCD as a therapeutic
option in immunocompromised adults, for whom the emergence
of drug-resistant CMV strains has become a substantial chal-
lenge. Combination therapies, which can include two or more
antiviral compounds, may help in controlling this problem, but
are limited by drug-related toxicity and CMV cross-resistance to
currently approved antiviral agents (Drew, 2000; James and
Prichard, 2011). By displaying a good safety profile and a novel
mechanism of anti-CMV activity, VCD may represent a valid
therapeutic choice for effective and safe combination treatments
potentially meriting testing in immunocompromised individu-
als. Other closely related molecules, for instance, valpromide,
may also attenuate CMV (Ornaghi et al., 2016), but because val-
promide can be metabolized to valproate, which can enhance
virus infections, VCD is a better alternative due to the absence of
conversion to valproate (Bialer et al., 1990; Bialer, 1991). That
both related compounds show anti-CMV properties suggests
that other structurally related compounds may also possess
antiviral potential. These compounds have not previously
been recognized as possessing anti-CMV actions; because
both valpromide and VCD not only have similar antiepileptic
actions and sedative properties in psychiatric patients, but also
block CMV infections, this raises the possibility that the
neurotropic and antiviral mechanisms of action may not be
unrelated.
The dose of VCD we use here, with a 6 g developing mouse
body weight, is 5 mg/kg. This amount is similar to or less than the
dose of existing compounds used to treat CMV in clinical set-
tings; for instance, assuming a 60 kg body weight, ganciclovir can
be used from 5 up to 20 mg/kg/d in patients with serious infec-
tions (Kotton et al., 2013; Choopong et al., 2016; Genentech USA,
2016). Furthermore, the 5 mg/kg dose of VCD for treating CMV
infection is lower than the dose used to attenuate seizures and
neuropathic pain in neonatal and adult rodent experiments
(Winkler et al., 2005; Kaufmann et al., 2010; Mares
ˇ et al., 2013;
Shekh-Ahmad et al., 2014) and is less than the 20 mg/kg dose that
can be used in humans to treat psychiatric dysfunction (Stepan-
sky, 1960; Goldberg, 1961; Harl, 1964; Bersudsky et al., 2010).
Together, these findings suggest that VCD may be able to atten-
uate CMV in the human brain at doses that should be both effec-
tive and tolerable.
CMV has been detected in a substantial number of brain tu-
mors and has been postulated to play a role in the initiation or
progression of malignant gliomas (Cobbs et al., 2007; Odeberg et
al., 2007; Mitchell et al., 2008; Knight et al., 2013), although the
possibility remains that CMV has a greater affinity for existing
glial-type cells than for normal brain cells (van den Pol et al.,
1999) rather than a causative role in oncogenesis. Although fur-
ther substantiation is merited (Lau et al., 2005), if CMV does play
a role in the enhancement of brain tumor growth, the use of VCD
to attenuate CNS CMV may prove beneficial in attenuating tu-
mor progression.
In conclusion, our study shows that subcutaneous low-dose
VCD effectively and safely attenuates mCMV replication in the
developing mouse brain and rescues these animals from virally
induced brain defects and adverse neurological outcomes. We
also show that VCD suppresses hCMV replication in human fetal
brain cells by blocking viral attachment to the cell surface. Con-
sidering that VCD is already clinically available, has proven to be
safe in multiple models of early development, and displays a
novel mechanism of anti-CMV action, it merits further clinical
testing for possible therapeutic utility in the treatment of CMV in
the mature and developing human brain.
