ABSTRACT
Habitual physical activity and regular exercise training improve cardiovascular health and longevity. A physically active
lifestyle is, therefore, a key aspect of primary and secondary prevention strategies. An appropriate volume and intensity
are essential to maximally benefit from exercise interventions. This document summarizes available evidence on the
relationship between the exercise volume and risk reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore,
the risks and benefits of moderate- versus high-intensity exercise interventions are compared. Findings are presented
for the general population and cardiac patients eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Finally, the controversy of
excessive volumes of exercise in the athletic population is discussed. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;67:316–29)

(3), because this exercise volume provides significant
health improvements for most people much of the
time. However, only one-half of Americans meet
these guidelines (4). In contrast, participation in
endurance exercise races has grown in popularity
among the most active individuals, as demonstrated
by the marked increase in the number of participants
in marathons, triathlons, and cycling races over the
past 3 decades (5,6). These individuals typically
engage in aerobic exercise volumes and intensities
well above the 2008 guideline recommendations.
Several recent reports surprisingly suggest that high
volumes of aerobic exercise may be as bad for CVD
outcomes as physical inactivity (7–10). The public me-
dia has embraced the idea that exercise may harm the
heart and disseminated this message, thereby divert-
ing attention away from the benefits of exercise as a
potent intervention for the primary and secondary
prevention of heart disease (11). This document will

tensity of aerobic exercise required for favorable

tion as to whether or not there is a volume that in-
creases CVD risk.
EXERCISE IN PRIMARY PREVENTION
GENERAL BENEFITS OF EXERCISE. The health ben-
efits of exercise have been recognized since the
epidemiological studies of Morris et al. (13), who in
the 1950s reported lower rates of coronary heart dis-
ease
among
the
conductors
of
London’s
double-decker
buses
compared
with
the
drivers.
Morris et al. (13) also reported a lower incidence of
coronary
heart
disease
among
English
postmen
compared with telephone operators working at the
same company. These data were the first to illustrate
an association between habitual physical activity and
cardiovascular health. Many subsequent epidemio-
logical studies confirmed this inverse relationship
between physical activity and CVD (14–16), but none
have proven causation because all such studies are
observational. To date, there are no randomized
clinical trials directly testing whether physical activ-
ity prevents CVD. Such a study would require an
enormous sample size and study duration because of
subject crossover among those volunteering for an
“exercise study” and because the progressively lower
rates of primary CVD in the general population would
reduce CVD endpoints. Powell et al. (17) evaluated the
possibly causative relationship between physical ac-
tivity and cardiovascular disease using the same
criteria used to document a causative relationship
between cigarette smoking and health (18), a rela-
tionship also lacking a randomized, controlled clinical
trial. They demonstrated that the relationship be-
tween physical activity and CVD was strong, was
consistent among studies, had a graded risk reduction
with increasing exercise volumes, and was coherent
with clinical studies showing a putatively beneficial
effect of exercise on CVD risk factors (17). They
concluded
that
increasing
physical
activity
was
causally related to lower rates of CVD despite
the absence of the classical clinical trial.
The CVD benefits of exercise are likely
mediated via multiple mechanisms. Regular
exercise training improves the CVD risk pro-
file by reducing triglycerides and increasing
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(19),
lowering
blood
pressure
(20),
improving
glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
(21), reducing body weight, and reducing in-
flammatory markers (22). These risk factor
improvements explain 59% of the reduction
in CVD (23). The remaining 41% may result
from
improved
endothelial
function
(24),
enhanced vagal tone producing lower heart
rates
(25),
vascular
remodeling
including
larger vessel diameters, and an enhanced nitric oxide
bioavailability.
DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY AND MORTALITY. The association between
exercise or physical activity and CVD outcome is most
frequently described as a curvilinear relationship
(Figure 1) (26). This indicates that a change from an
inactive to a mild or moderately active lifestyle yields
a relatively large risk reduction, whereas further
increasing exercise volumes produce smaller risk re-
ductions. Thus, any physical activity is better than
none, although higher volumes, even above the 2008
guideline recommendations, appear to further reduce
CVD.
Several studies have examined the minimum vol-
ume of aerobic physical activity required to produce
health benefits. The least active, but still effective,
behavior is standing. Standing >2 h/day is associated
with a 10% reduction of all-cause mortality (hazard
ratio [HR]: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.95) compared with
standing <2 h/day (27). Increased standing time was
associated
with
larger
risk
reductions,
with
the
lowest mortality in individuals standing $8 h/day
(HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.95), but standing time
could have also included light physical activity, such
as walking, in addition to only standing. The study
population included 221,240 Australians age $45
years and the results were independent of health
status and were not altered by sex, age, body mass
index, other physical activity, and sitting time (27).
Similar reductions in all-cause mortality with stand-
ing were observed prospectively in 16,586 Canadians
(28), but this study also showed that standing 25%
and 75% of the time was associated with 18% and 32%
reductions in CVD mortality, respectively (HR: 0.82;
95% CI: 0.68 to 0.99 and HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.50 to
0.92) (28). This dose–response relationship between
standing and CVD mortality informs on the lower end

 of the CVD benefit relationship and supports the
concept that even small amounts of physical activity
provide CVD benefit.
An additional benefit of the increase
in time
standing and performing light physical activity is the
simultaneous reduction of even less taxing activities
such as sitting. Prolonged sitting increases the risk for
all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent fashion (29).
Importantly, the detrimental effects of sitting appear
to be independent from the benefits of physical ac-
tivity (30). Recent studies demonstrate that breaking
up sitting time improves cardiovascular health (31)
and glucose homeostasis (32), and replacement of
sitting time effectively reduces all-cause mortality
(33). It is therefore recommended that future primary
intervention programs target both sedentary behavior
as well as habitual physical activity to maximize the
reduction in cardiovascular risk.
Studies of moderate- and vigorous-intensity ac-
tivity
below
the
recommended
exercise
volume
(34–36) confirm substantial health benefits from low
levels of activity. Americans running 51 min/week or
68% of the recommended volume experienced lower
CVD mortality (HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.66) and all-
cause mortality (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.85)
compared with nonrunners (34). Similarly, Taiwanese
engaging
in
moderate-intensity
exercise
92
min/
week, or 61% of the recommended volume, experi-
enced a reduction in CVD mortality (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:
0.71
to
0.93)
and all-cause
mortality
(HR:
0.86;
95% CI: 0.81 to 0.91) compared with their inactive
peers (35). A meta-analysis including 661,137 American
and European men and women also demonstrated
that individuals performing moderate- to vigorous-
intensity leisure time physical activity at a volume
below 2008 guideline recommendations had a 20%
reduction in CVD mortality (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.77 to
0.84) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.78 to
0.82) compared with inactive control subjects (36).
These data emphasize that even low exercise volumes
can effectively reduce CVD mortality, a message that
clinicians should communicate to stimulate vulner-
able populations to become physically active.
The volume of aerobic exercise to improve CVD
outcomes maximally is difficult to determine. The
metabolic equivalent of task (MET) score uses the
intensity of exercise (a multiple of the resting meta-
bolic rate) from the Compendium for Physical Activ-
ities
(37)
multiplied
by
an
assessment
of
the
frequency (sessions/week) and duration (h/week) to
calculate the exercise volume in MET-h/week. We
combined data from Taiwanese (35), American, and
European population studies (36) to assess the dose–
response relationship between physical activity and
CVD mortality (Figure 2). Maximal risk reduction for
cardiovascular mortality was found at a volume of
41 MET-h/week. This is 3.5� to 4� greater than the
recommended
volume
and
equals
547
min/week
of moderate-intensity exercise at 4.5 METs or 289
min/week of vigorous-intensity exercise at 8.5 METs.
Individuals
performing
exercise
at
this
volume
experienced a 45% lower risk for CVD mortality

A similar increase in physical activity yields different risk reductions across the activity
spectrum. Physical inactivity is associated with the highest risk, whereas high aerobic
exercise volumes are associated with the lowest risk (26).

 (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.66) compared with
inactive control subjects.
Only 3.5% of individuals included in the meta-
analysis mentioned exceed the exercise volume that
was associated with maximal health benefits (36).
These individuals experienced reductions in CVD
mortality comparable to the “maximal benefit” group
(HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.67; and HR: 0.71; 95%
CI: 0.56 to 0.91 for subjects performing 40 to 75
MET-h/week and >75 MET-h/week, respectively) (36),
but this difference was not statistically significant
in part because the small percentage of individuals
exercising at this volume creates large confidence
intervals. Performing exercise volumes at the upper
end
of
the
physical
activity
spectrum
therefore
appears to be safe because there is no evidence for
adverse CVD outcomes among these individuals.
DOES INTENSITY MATTER? Moderate-intensity ac-
tivities are defined as requiring 3.0 to 5.9 METs of
energy
expenditure,
whereas
vigorous
intensity
requires $6.0 METs. High-intensity interval training
produces larger improvements in cardiorespiratory
fitness,
expressed
as
VO2max,
compared
with
moderate-intensity, continuous training (38). Higher
fitness levels are associated with a reduction in CVD
(39) and all-cause mortality (40) in a curvilinear
fashion. The potential superior health benefits of
vigorous-intensity exercise are supported by epide-
miological data. Australians performing <30% of their
total physical activity in vigorous exercise, as well as
those performing >30% had reduced mortality rates
compared
with
individuals
performing
only
moderate-intensity exercise (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84
to 0.98 and HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.93, respec-
tively) after adjusting for total volume of moderate-
to vigorous-intensity activities (41). These observa-
tions are consistent with a systematic review of
epidemiological studies and clinical trials demon-
strating
a
larger
reduction
in
CVD
events
and
improvement in CVD risk factors for vigorous versus
moderate intensity physical activity (42).
Interestingly, the dose-response curve between
physical activity and mortality appears to be different
for
moderate
versus
vigorous-intensity
exercise
(Figure 3). Increasing levels of moderate intensity
physical activity progressively reduces CVD mortality,
whereas the response curve flattens for vigorous
physical activity in an excess of 11 MET-h/week (34,35).
Similar patterns exist for all-cause mortality, although
the
differences
between
moderate
and
vigorous
intensity
activity
were
less
pronounced
(34–36)
(Figure 3). These findings indicate that increasing
volumes of moderate-intensity exercise are associ-
ated
with
further
improvements
in
CVD
health,
whereas for vigorous intensity, lower volumes are
associated with maximal risk reduction.
This relationship may be due at least in part to the
repeated observation that vigorous-intensity exercise
acutely,
albeit
transiently,
increases
CVD
events
(43–45). A total of 122 sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs),
23 (18.9%) of which were exercise related, occurred in
a study of 21,481 male physicians (45). The absolute

 risk for a vigorous exercise-related SCD was low at
1 per 1.42 million hours, but 16.9% higher (95% CI:
10.5% to 27.0%; p < 0.001) than that during low/no
physical activity. Despite this acute increase in risk
during vigorous activity, the relative risk (RR) for SCD
decreased
progressively
with
increasing
habitual
vigorous exercise from an RR of 74.1 for those exer-
cising vigorously <1 session/week (95% CI: 22.0 to
249) versus an RR of 18.9 for those exercising vigor-
ously 1 to 4 sessions/week (95% CI: 10.2 to 35.1) versus
an RR of 10.9 for those exercising vigorously $5 ses-
sions/week (95% CI: 4.5 to 26.2) (45). The pattern is
similar for the association between vigorous exertion
and acute myocardial infarction (MI) in the general
population (44). Among 1,228 MI patients, the risk for
a vigorous activity-induced MI was markedly lower
for individuals regularly involved in vigorous activ-
ities ($5 sessions/week; RR: 2.4) compared with
sedentary individuals (no sessions/week, RR: 107)
(44). Such results demonstrate that vigorous physical
activity transiently increases the risk for acute cardiac
events, but reduces the overall risk.
In summary, volumes of moderate- and vigorous-
intensity exercise below the 2008 Physical Activity
Guideline recommendations result in a significantly
lower mortality risk in different populations around
the globe. Increasing volumes of moderate-intensity
exercise result in larger reductions of CVD mortality,
whereas no further reduction in CVD mortality is
observed for volumes of vigorous-intensity exercise
beyond 11 MET-h/week. Finally, there is no evidence
for an upper limit of exercise-induced health benefits.
Every volume of moderate- and vigorous-intensity
aerobic exercise results in a reduction of all-cause
and CVD mortality compared with physical inactivity.
EXERCISE IN SECONDARY PREVENTION
CURRENT
GUIDELINE
RECOMMENDATIONS. Exer-
cise is a key component in the management of pa-
tients with most established CVD because it reduces
recurrent CVD events. Guidelines from the American
College of Cardiology and American Heart Association
include specific recommendations for diverse pop-
ulations of cardiac patients (Table 2) (46–50). The
recommend exercise volume is generally similar to
that
for
healthy
adults:
30
to
60
min/day
of
moderate-intensity aerobic activities. Exercise can be
performed as a part of a clinical rehabilitation pro-
gram or at home and in the community. Patients are
advised to include resistance exercise training to
maintain strength and muscle mass. A meta-analysis
of 504 studies suggests that the combination of
aerobic
and
resistance
exercise
produces
greater
reductions in body fat and improvements in muscle
strength compared with aerobic exercise alone (51).
Adding strength training to aerobic programs tends to
produce larger increases in cardiopulmonary fitness
and improvements in quality of life (QOL) in patients
with CVD (51). Increased QOL may occur because
the
increases
in
exercise
capacity
and
strength
increase self-confidence and independence after a
CVD event.
CARDIAC REHABILITATION. Patients with stable angina
pectoris, systolic heart failure, MI, recent cardiac
surgery, or a percutaneous coronary intervention are
eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Contemporary car-
diac rehabilitation programs include not only exercise
training but also nutritional and psychological coun-
seling; weight, blood pressure, lipid, and diabetes
management; and smoking cessation (52). The goal is
to reduce CVD risk via pharmacotherapy, improved
health behavior, and a physically active life-style.
In contrast to the available evidence for primary
prevention,
there
are
randomized
clinical
trials
assessing the benefits of exercise training and car-
diac rehabilitation on CVD in select patient pop-
ulations.
A
Cochrane
review
of
47
randomized
controlled
trials
including
10,794
coronary
heart
disease
patients
(53)
demonstrated
that
cardiac
rehabilitation reduced all-cause (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75
to 0.99) and CVD mortality (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63
to 0.87) after >1 year of follow-up. Furthermore, a
decrease in hospital admissions was found in the
cardiac rehabilitation versus the standard care group
within 1 year of follow-up (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51 to
0.93). A meta-analysis including 6,111 post-MI patients
from 34 randomized controlled clinical trials showed
similar
results,
with
exercise-based
rehabilitation
demonstrating a lowered risk for all-cause mortality
(odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.95), CVD
mortality (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.91), cardiac
mortality (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.88), and rein-
farction (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.76) (54).
A Cochrane review of 33 randomized clinical trials
including 4,740 patients with predominantly systolic
heart failure (55) demonstrated that cardiac reha-
bilitation and exercise training reduced all-cause
(RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.92) and heart failure–
specific (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.80) hospitalization
rates. QOL also improved more in the cardiac rehabil-
itation patients. All-cause mortality was not different
between the exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and
no exercise control arms at 1 year of follow-up
(RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.27), but trended toward
significance in follow-up >1 year (RR: 0.88; 95% CI:
0.75 to 1.02) (55).

supervised thrice-weekly exercise training followed
by an at-home training program. The investigators
sought to enhance adherence to the home exercise by
providing treadmills or stationary cycles to partici-
pants. Despite such efforts, adherence to the exercise
training program was low and the average increase in
maximal oxygen uptake was only 0.7 ml/kg/min
(interquartile range [IQR]: –1.0 to 2.5 ml/kg/min), a
value lower than most prior, smaller studies of exer-
cise training in this population. Heart failure patients
receiving exercise training had a reduced incidence of
cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitali-
zation compared to the nonexercise training usual care
group (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00) (56). After
correction
for

prognostic

factors
and heart failure etiology, these findings became sta-
tistically significant (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99).
Patients receiving exercise training also reported an
earlier and larger improvement in self-reported health
status, which persisted over time (57).
THE VOLUME AND INTENSITY OF AEROBIC EXERCISE
TRAINING FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION. Most cardiac
rehabilitation
studies
and
programs
used
a
re-
latively standard exercise protocol. Subjects gener-
ally exercised 3� weekly for 30 to 40 min/session
at heart rates equal to 60% to 85% of their maximal
value
or
age-estimated
maximal
value.
The
risk
of
cardiac
arrest
during
vigorous
exercise
in
individuals with CVD was initially estimated at 6� to
164� greater than their risk at rest (58). The risk of a
cardiac event during contemporary cardiac rehabili-
tation is low: estimated at only 1 cardiac arrest
per
116,906
patient-hours
of
participation
and
1
fatality per 752,365 patient-hours (59). These event
rates apply to supervised cardiac rehabilitation where
trained
personnel
can
monitor
symptoms
and
administer resuscitation if needed. Comparing the
cardiac arrest and mortality rates suggests that the

rate
would

For all patients, the clinician should encourage 30 to 60 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such
as brisk walking, at least 5 days and preferably 7 days per week, supplemented by an increase in daily

There are few studies examining the effect of ex-
ercise volume on CVD outcomes in cardiac patients,
because most studies used standard and similar ex-
ercise training protocols. Data from the HF-ACTION
trial suggest a curvilinear response between the vol-
ume of exercise and the subsequent risk for cardio-
vascular events during 28 months of follow-up (60).
Heart
failure
patients
performing
exercise
$5
MET-h/week
had
a
higher
event-free
survival
compared with those performing lower volumes of
exercise (i.e., <1, 1 to 3, or 3 to 5 MET-h/week). How-
ever, after correction for peak VO2 values, a J-shaped
curve appeared, with the largest risk reductions in
patients exercising 3 to 7 MET-h/week and less benefit
for patients exercising $7 MET-h/week (60).
Several studies in CVD subjects exercising in un-
supervised settings reinforce the hypothesis that high
volumes of exercise may be deleterious in this patient
group. The National Runners’ and Walkers’ Health
studies of Williams et al. (10) recorded the baseline
exercise habits and health outcomes of 2,377 subjects
who were self-identified as heart attack survivors at
baseline. A total of 526 died over an average follow-
up of 10.4 years; 71.5% died due to CVD. CVD
mortality decreased progressively with increasing
amounts of exercise to a maximum mortality reduc-
tion of 63% in those running or walking at a volume of
38 to 50 MET-h/week compared with the least active
group (<8 MET-h/week). In the most active exer-
cisers, however, those running >7.1 km a day or
walking briskly >10.7 km a day, the reduction in CVD
mortality was only 12%, and was not different from
the least active group (Central Illustration).
These data from Williams et al. (10) show an
attenuation of mortality risk reductions in patients
with the highest levels of exercise. Studies by both
Wannamethee et al. (61) and Mons et al. (9) also show
an apparent reduction in the benefit of exercise in the
most active subjects. Among 772 British patients with
coronary heart disease (61), lightly and moderately
active patients had a significantly lower all-cause and
CVD-related mortality risk compared with inactive
patients, whereas moderately to vigorously active
patients did not (Central Illustration). Similarly, Mons
et al. (9) found that among 1,038 German coronary
heart disease patients, patients exercising 2 to 4 ses-
sions/week demonstrated the lowest all-cause (7.6
per 1,000 person-years) and cardiovascular mortality
(4.5 per 1,000 person-years), whereas higher or lower
exercise frequencies were associated with higher
mortality rates (Central Illustration). In contrast, the
examination
by
Moholdt
et
al.
(62)
of
3,504
Norwegian
patients
with
coronary
heart
disease
observed no attenuated mortality risk reduction in
the most active group (Central Illustration). These
current studies are limited by their observational
nature, their use of self-reported activity patterns,
and a potential selection bias of participating sub-
jects. The possibility that high levels of exercise
attenuate the reduction in CVD events warrants
additional examination because of the widespread
perception that more of a good thing is better. Hence,
the extrapolation of these observations is limited and
may only be of concern in a minority of patients.
Despite these concerns about the volume and in-
tensity of exercise in CVD patients, several studies
have explored strategies to optimize the effects of
cardiac rehabilitation using high-intensity interval
training (HIIT), modeled after athletic training pro-
grams. HIIT was introduced into cardiac rehabilitation
in 2007 and typically consists of a 10-min warm-up at
60% to 70% of peak heart rate, followed by 4 4-min
intervals at 90% to 95% of peak heart rate separated
by 3-min active pauses at 50% to 70% of peak heart
rate (63). The exercise session is ended by a 3-min
cool down at 50% to 70% of peak heart rate (Figure 4).
Heart failure patients receiving HIIT demonstrated
a
46%
improvement
in
cardiorespiratory
fitness
(VO2peak) compared with only a 14% improvement in
patients expending the same amount of energy dur-
ing
traditional,
moderate
intensity
continuous
training (MICT) consisting of a 47-min exercise bout
at 70% to 75% of peak heart rate (Figure 4) (63).
A meta-analysis including 229 patients with coro-
nary artery disease demonstrated that HIIT produced
a larger increase in VO2peak (weighted mean differ-
ence: 1.53 ml/kg/min; 95% CI: 0.84 to 2.23) compared
with MICT (64). Similarly, a meta-analysis comparing
changes in fitness in cardiac rehabilitation trials for
heart failure that included 5,877 patients found larger
improvements in VO2peak for training programs using
higher
exercise
intensities
(65).
Moreover,
fewer
heart failure patients withdrew from the studies in
the highest exercise intensity groups.
The greater increase in cardiorespiratory fitness
with more intense exercise training in CVD patients
does not necessarily mean that the more intense
training regimens will increase survival. There are
also potential risks to more intense exercise in CVD
patients especially if performed in the absence of
trained medical personnel. A comparison of adverse
CVD events between MICT and HIIT in 4,846 cardiac
patients revealed event rates of 1 per 129,456 and
1 per 23,182 patient-hours, respectively (66). These
data suggest a higher risk for adverse CVD outcomes
with HIIT, but there were only 1 fatal cardiac arrest

 and 2 nonfatal cardiac arrests with MICT and HIIT,
respectively,
so
there
were
too
few
events
and
insufficient power to compare risk.
Taken together, referral to an exercise rehabilitation
program is recommended for cardiac patients, because
participants benefit from a reduced risk for future
cardiovascular events and mortality. Supervised HIIT
protocols yield larger health improvements than MICT
protocols. The risk for cardiac arrest and SCD during
exercise is low but present. High-intensity activities
and high weekly exercise volumes may attenuate the
health benefits in cardiac patients, with risk rates
returning to the level of inactive peers. Moderate-
intensity exercise at volumes comparable to guide-
lines (46–50) should therefore be recommended for
cardiac patients by their clinicians to achieve maximal
cardiovascular benefits.

 than that required for cardiovascular health. Multiple
studies
have
reported
unexpected,
potentially
adverse cardiovascular outcomes in athletes. For
example,
some
athletes
demonstrate
exercise-
induced elevations in cardiac troponin levels (67),
evidence of myocardial fibrosis (68), post-exercise
cardiac dysfunction (69), an increased incidence of
arrhythmias (70), accelerated coronary artery calcifi-
cations (71), and an increased risk for cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality at high amounts of exercise
compared with light to moderate amounts of exercise
(7,8). These observations among marathon runners,
triathletes, cross-country skiers, and cyclists raise the
question of whether such athletes may experience
potentially detrimental cardiac side effects from their
exercise habits (72).
Exercise-induced,
acute
elevations
in
cardiac
troponin T and I are observed in athletes participating
in running races (15, 21, or 42 km) (73), triathlons (74),
endurance cycling (75), and ultra-endurance races
(76), but also in individuals from the general popu-
lation performing prolonged walking exercise (77).
Post-exercise troponin concentrations are related to
the covered distance (73) and exercise intensity (78),
and exceed the upper reference limit for an acute MI
in >50% of the athletic population (67). Although
these findings suggest cardiac damage due to exercise
performance, the kinetics of troponin release are
different between patients and athletes. Athletes
demonstrate modestly elevated peak troponin levels
that normalize within 72 h post-exercise in absence
of
any
signs
or
symptoms
of
ischemia
(79).
In
contrast, peak troponin concentrations can increase
up to 50� the upper limit of normal and remain
elevated for 4 to 10 days in acute MI patients in
conjunction with acute electrocardiogram changes
and imaging evidence of ischemia (80). It is therefore
hypothesized that troponin elevations in athletes
represent a physiological rather than a pathological
phenomenon (81), potentially caused by troponin
leaks from the cytosol of cardiomyocytes due to an
exercise-induced increase in membrane permeability.
Small cardiac foci of late gadolinium enhancement
have been found during cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging in some (68,82,83), but not all (84,85) studies
of endurance athletes. These observations provide
evidence of myocardial fibrosis, possibly increasing
the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and mortality (86,87).
The presence of myocardial fibrosis was observed in
12% to 50% of the athletes and was associated with
longer endurance exercise participation and higher
years of training and number of completed marathons
(68,82,83). Fibrosis was frequently found where the
right ventricle inserts into the septum, a location that
is
rarely
observed
in
ischemic
cardiac
patients.
Interestingly, comparable patterns are observed in
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients (88). Simi-
larly, faint late gadolinium enhancement has been
observed at the superior and inferior insertion points
of the right and left ventricles of patients whose right
ventricle was forced to produce systemic pressures
after atrial redirection surgery for transposition of the
great
vessels
(89).
This
suggests
a
nonischemic
etiology for the fibrosis found in athletes and that it is
possibly due to the increase in mechanical stress on
the right ventricle during exercise (90). Nevertheless,
athletes with late gadolinium enhancement demon-
strated a worse event-free survival compared with
those without imaging abnormalities (75% vs. 99%;
p < 0.001) in 1 study (82).
Post-exercise decreases in left and right ventricular
function are observed in some endurance athletes,
with a larger decrement in the right versus left ventricle
(76,91). The magnitude of the reduction in cardiac
function is associated with longer exercise duration
(68) and lower training status (92). This cardiac
dysfunction is mild and typically recovers within 48 h
after exercise cessation (93). Exercise-induced right
ventricular dysfunction appears to be more pro-
nounced in athletes with ventricular arrhythmias
compared with healthy athletes (94). Whether athletes
with a transient decline in cardiac function are at risk
for future arrhythmias is currently unknown.
The association between physical activity patterns
and incident atrial fibrillation is complicated. More
leisure-time activity, greater walking distance, faster
walking pace, and higher cardiorespiratory fitness

 were associated with a graded risk reduction for
atrial fibrillation in the Cardiovascular Health Study
(N ¼ 5,446) and Henry Ford Exercise Testing (FIT)
Project (N ¼ 64,561) (95,96). In contrast, a meta-
analysis (N ¼ 1,550) reported a 5-fold increase in the
relative risk for atrial fibrillation in athletes (OR: 5.3;
95% CI: 3.6 to 7.9) compared with the general popu-
lation (97). Also, a large Swedish study (N ¼ 52,755)
confirmed
these
findings
and
observed a
higher
incidence
of
atrial
fibrillation
in
participants
completing $5 versus 1 Vasaloppet cross-country ski-
races (HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.61) and in those with
faster finishing times (100% to 160% vs. >240% of
winning time; HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.55). A po-
tential explanation for these apparently contradictory
findings is that the relationship between physical
activity may be U-shaped, with moderate amounts of
exercise decreasing but large volumes of exercise
increasing atrial fibrillation risk (96,98).
The physically active lifestyle of athletes does not
prevent the development of central and peripheral
atherosclerosis (99). In fact, greater coronary artery
calcification (CAC) scores have been found in German
marathon
runners
(median
36;
IQR:
0
to
217)
compared with control subjects (median 12; IQR: 0 to
78) matched for age and Framingham risk score (71),
but this difference disappeared when the authors
corrected for age only (median 38; IQR: 3 to 187).
Alternatively, the elevated CAC scores may be the
result of plaque stabilization, as a higher CAC density
is
protective
for
future
cardiovascular
outcomes
(100). This hypothesis aligns with epidemiological
observations of reduced cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality in athletes compared with sedentary con-
trol subjects (101).
Two recent epidemiological studies reported a U-
shaped relationship between aerobic exercise vol-
umes and cardiovascular morbidity (8) and mortality
(7)
in
the
general
population.
A
British
study
(N ¼ 1,119,239) showed a lower incidence of cerebro-
vascular disease (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.84) and
venous thromboembolism (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.79 to
0.87) in women performing 2 to 3 sessions/week
of strenuous activities compared with inactive con-
trol subjects, but these health benefits disappeared
in
women
performing
daily
strenuous
activities
(RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.04; and RR: 1.08; 95% CI:
0.99 to 1.17, respectively) (8). In contrast, daily ac-
tivities regardless of the exercise intensity did reduce
the incidence of cerebrovascular disease (RR: 0.88;
95% CI: 0.86 to 0.91) and venous thromboembolism
(RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.00) compared with inac-
tive control subjects. Also, any volume of (strenuous)
exercise reduced the risk for incident coronary heart
disease, even in women performing daily strenuous
exercise (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.93) (8). An
important caveat of this study was the higher smoking
prevalence among daily strenuous exercisers (25.6%)
compared
with
all
other
exercise
groups
(13.7%
to 15.5%). This may partially explain the absence
of
exercise-induced
health
benefits
in
the
most
active individuals. A Danish study including joggers
(n ¼ 1,098) and nonjoggers (n ¼ 3,950) reported similar
findings for all-cause mortality (7). Arbitrarily classi-
fied “light” joggers (HR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.47) had
a lower mortality risk compared with nonjoggers,
whereas mortality rates in “moderate” (HR: 0.66;
95% CI: 0.32 to 1.38) and “strenuous” joggers (HR: 1.97;
95% CI: 0.48 to 8.14) were comparable to nonjoggers
(7). For any other classification of physical activity
(quantity, frequency, or pace), however, the most
active group always demonstrated a lower mortality
compared with nonjoggers. Other important study
limitations include the low number of subjects in the
strenuous jogger group and the fact that inclusion in
the nonjoggers group allowed participants to walk or
bike up to 2 h/week (102). Given the methodological
limitations of these 2 studies, it is premature to
conclude that high exercise volumes, compared with
light to moderate volumes, could increase CVD risk.
The exercise-induced changes in cardiac structure
and function are often related to the volume (late-
gadolinium enhancement, cardiac dysfunction, and
CAC) and intensity (troponin release and atrial fibril-
lation) of activities performed by athletes. For most
observations, the long-term clinical implications are
currently unknown, but it is unlikely that these are
similar to risk classifications in CVD patient pop-
ulations. For example, recreational marathon training
has been shown to have a positive effect on several
determinants of cardiovascular risk (103). Also, life-
long
patterns
of
“committed”
exercise
(4
to
5
sessions/week) and “competitive” Masters-level ath-
letes prevents most of the age-related left ventricular
stiffening changes implicated in the pathophysiology
of many cardiovascular disorders (104). Furthermore,
leisure-time runners have lower all-cause (HR: 0.70;
95% CI: 0.64 to 0.77) and cardiovascular mortality
rates (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.65) compared with
nonrunners (34). These observations are not limited
to amateur athletes, but include elite athletes, who
were engaged in high volumes of vigorous exercise
for many years, yet demonstrated a 3- to 6-year in-
crease in life expectancy compared with control
subjects from general (105–107) and military (108)
populations. Mortality risk reductions were larger
for older athletes and those who participated in
multiple races (101). These findings suggest that

 athletes performing exercise volumes at the upper
end of the physical activity spectrum do not demon-
strate an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular
outcomes on a population level.
Even though exercise and exercise training appears
to benefit the majority of people, there may be in-
dividuals with genetic predisposition for cardiac dis-
ease in whom exercise training is not beneficial.
Physically active individuals with genetic defects in
the desmosomal proteins associated with right ven-
tricular cardiomyopathy presented earlier in life and
had signs of more aggressive disease than less phys-
ically active individuals with similar genetic muta-
tions (109). Whether similar patterns exist for other
genetic mutations is worthy of investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
This review demonstrates that even small amounts of
physical activity, including activities such as stand-
ing, are associated with lower CVD risk. Exercise
volumes of 150 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75
min/week
of
vigorous-intensity
aerobic
exercise,
such as recommended in the 2008 Physical Activity
Guidelines
Advisory
Committee
Report,
further
reduce CVD mortality. The possibility that too much
exercise training could produce deleterious cardiac
effects including myocardial fibrosis, coronary calci-
fication,
and
atrial
fibrillation
is
interesting
and
worthy of scientific investigation; however, overall
the results, even for very active, life-long endurance
athletes, is that the benefits of exercise training
outweigh the risks. There may also be small subsets of
the population with genetic predispositions to cardiac
disease for whom vigorous exercise is not beneficial
and may even be deleterious, although this repre-
sents a very small subset of patients. Moreover, the
issue for most developed countries and the majority
of their citizens is not concern about too much exer-
cise, but rather the absence of any exercise among
most of the population and among patients with CVD.
For example, only 62% of 58,269 post-infarction
patients
were
referred
to
cardiac
rehabilitation
at
hospital
discharge
(110),
whereas
only
23%
attended $1 cardiac rehabilitation session and only
5.4% completed $36 sessions. This may reflect, in
part, a lack of clinician enthusiasm for such programs
despite the evidence that cardiac rehabilitation saves
lives. The available evidence should prompt clini-
cians to strongly recommend low and moderate ex-
ercise
training
for
the
majority
of
our
patients.
Equally important are initiatives to promote popula-
tion health at large through physical activity across
the life span, as it modulates behavior from childhood
into adult life.
