Abstract
Objective: We conducted a national survey to understand the impact of state-level density reporting laws on women’s level of density
risk awareness and their engagement in conversations with providers regarding supplemental screening.
Methods: In all, 1,500 US women aged 40 to 74 years who obtained a mammogram within 2 years were surveyed in February 2018.
The sampling design yielded 300 respondents in each of five groups categorized based on density reporting law features. Women were
asked about their breast density-related knowledge, importance of being notified, and sources of information and if conversations with
providers regarding density and supplemental screening occurred. Survey results were compared across groups and between women
residing in states with versus without density laws.
Results: The majority of respondents in all groups felt that it is important for women to know their breast density type (range, 85%-
90%). Women were most likely informed of breast density type by a health care provider (range, 68%-72%), followed by the
mammography result letter (range, 48%-68%), and then a radiologist (range, 46%-61%). Women from states with a density law were
significantly more likely to have learned of their breast tissue type from a mammogram results letter (60% versus 48%, P ¼ .011) and
discuss supplemental screening (67% versus 53%, respectively; P ¼ .008) than women from states without a law.
Conclusion: State-level density reporting laws are associated with increased breast density awareness and increased likelihood of
conversations between women and their providers regarding supplemental screening.
Key Words: Breast density, supplemental screening, patient advocacy, breast cancer

INTRODUCTION
Patient breast health advocacy organizations have promoted
greater awareness of risks related to dense breast tissue for
nearly a decade, culminating in state-level legislation to
standardize the reporting of dense breast tissue [1]. Their
goals in informing women about breast density to women
who undergo mammography are to improve early cancer
diagnosis and to prevent advanced disease through more

 personalized, risk-based screening. Later-stage tumors
confer fewer treatment options and worse survival out-
comes, including a greater likelihood of recurrence [2].
Furthermore, randomized control trials of screening
mammography demonstrate a corresponding reduction of
mortality with the reduction of advanced disease [3,4].
More recent studies suggest that supplemental screening
tools such as ultrasound can significantly increase detection
of small, node-negative cancers masked on mammography
[5-7]. In 2009, Connecticut became the first state in the
nation to report dense tissue to women as part of their
mammography reporting results [8]. Since then, a total of
36 states have enacted density reporting legislation [9].
These laws, which have been hailed by patient advocates,
have not been met with equal enthusiasm among other
stakeholders [10]. The language dictated by state-level
reporting laws has been criticized for its readability levels
and differences across states, potential for additional costs
and overdiagnosis, physician unpreparedness, and patient
and provider confusion [11]. Nevertheless, the intended
goals of increasing awareness of breast cancer risk and
informing women regarding options for supplemental
screening remain [12].
Are You Dense, Inc, and Are You Dense Advocacy,
Inc, both breast health patient advocacy groups, commis-
sioned Spectrum Associates Market Research to design and
conduct a survey to measure the impact of these laws from
the patient perspective. Objectives of the survey were to
enhance the ability of patient advocacy groups to continue
to provide education about breast health and risk and
develop patient-friendly breast health resources. Specif-
ically, the national survey aimed to understand the current
level of women’s knowledge regarding breast density, their
desire to be directly notified of their breast density, their
level of understanding of the implications of dense breasts
on breast cancer risk and risk-based screening, and the
impact of state-level density reporting laws on women’s
level of breast density awareness and their engagement in
conversations about supplemental screening with health
care providers.
METHODS
Study Population
We obtained a survey sample that included women from
all 50 US states. Inclusion criteria were the following:
women of screening age (40-74 years old), receipt of a
mammogram within 2 years, and US residence. A total of
1,500 women meeting these inclusion criteria completed
the survey, with 300 women surveyed in each of five
groups categorized based on the presence and language
used in state breast density reporting laws in effect as
of February 2018. These five survey sample groups
are described in detail in Table 1 and included the
following:
1. Connecticut (CT group)—The first state to mandate
that all women undergoing screening receive infor-
mation about dense breast tissue. The Connecticut law
does not require that patients be informed of their
density category (a, b, c, or d) or that density is
associated with increased breast cancer risk. Con-
necticut is the home state of Are You Dense, Inc and
Are You Dense Advocacy, Inc, and mandated sup-
plemental screening ultrasound insurance coverage
before the density reporting law.
2. Everyone, no density (E/ND group)—Five states
where all women undergoing screening receive infor-
mation about dense breast tissue. These states do not
require that patients be informed of their own density
category.
3. Only dense (OD group)—Sixteen states where only
women with dense breasts (category c or d) receive
information about dense breast tissue. These state laws
specify that density is associated with increased breast
cancer risk but do not require that patients be
informed of their own density category.
4. Everyone, dense breast categories (E/DB group)—
Nine states where all women undergoing screening
receive information about their own density category
(category a, b, c, or d). Those with dense tissue
(category c or d) receive added language that density is
associated with increased breast cancer risk and that
they consider supplemental screening.
5. No-law group—Nineteen states with no density
reporting law as of February 2018.

Women were asked if they were informed of their own
breast density type (eg, dense versus nondense). If they
answered yes, then they were asked how they were
informed (mammogram results letter, conversation with
provider, or a conversation with radiologist). In addition,
women with dense breasts were asked if a provider spoke
with them about supplemental screening as well as who
initiated conversations about breast density (eg, the
woman, provider, or radiologist).

 Data Collection and Statistical Analysis
The cross-sectional survey was distributed electronically
by Research Now, a leading online panel company.
Research Now routinely employs quality control checks
on panel participants, ensuring elimination of member
duplication and limiting the number of invitations
available to each panel member. Panelists are rewarded for
taking part in surveys according to a structured incentive
plan (ranging from gift cards, point programs, charitable
contributions, and partner products).
For this cross-sectional study, Research Now pro-
grammed, hosted, and obtained 1,500 completed surveys
(300 surveys from each of the five groups). All surveys
were completed by female panel members meeting in-
clusion criteria between February 8 and February 11,
2018. The survey invitation was sent only once to 20,873
women. Of these, 2,408 women opened the survey
invitation for an overall response rate of 11.5% (2,408 of
20,873), which is within normal range for similar mar-
keting panel surveys. Of those who opened the survey,
70% (1,686 of 2,408) met the survey inclusion criteria
and were included in our analysis.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
version 21.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). The
sampling method was designed to obtain a 95% confidence
level of �5.8% or smaller (based on the percentage of re-
spondents for a given survey question). Descriptive statistics
were compared across all five sample groups. The impact of
having a state density reporting law and the time period
since law enactment on women’s perceptions of breast
density issues were examined using cross-tabulations. To
determine whether any observed differences between
groups were statistically significant, the c2 test was used.
To determine the effect of having a state density
reporting law, data were categorized into two groups: states
with a density law and states without a law. To determine
the effect of time of density law enactment on women’s
knowledge and patient–provider discussions, states with
density laws were categorized into two groups: those with
laws enacted October 1, 2009, to January 30, 2014, and
those with laws enacted May 1, 2014, to January 1, 2018.
Data for these two-group analyses were weighted so that
surveys for each state within a group were reflective of the
state’s proportion of the overall population for the group.
RESULTS
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Sociodemographic (including race or ethnicity) and
clinical characteristics (personal history or family history
of breast cancer) of respondents were similar across all five
sample groups (Table 2). When women were divided into
two groups based on whether or not their states had a
density reporting law, sociodemographic characteristics
were similar.
General Density Knowledge and Importance
When asked how knowledgeable they felt about breast
density, over three-fourths of women in each of the five
groups felt that they were at least fairly knowledgeable
(range, 76%-81%). About one-fifth of women in each
group felt that they were not very knowledgeable (range,
18%-23%). The vast majority of respondents in all
groups completely agree or mostly agree that it is
important for every woman to know her own breast
density type (range, 85%-90%). Likewise, the vast ma-
jority of respondents in all groups completely agree or
mostly agree with the statement “I would prefer to know
my breast tissue type than not know” (range, 85%-90%).
The majority of women in all sample groups also knew
that dense breasts may mask cancers on mammography
(range, 67%-80%). In contrast, fewer than half of
respondents in four of the five sample groups (CT,
E/ND, OD, and no law; range, 42%-48%) knew that
dense breast tissue increases a woman’s risk for devel-
oping breast cancer.
Among respondents in the four groups with density
reporting laws, the vast majority of women were not
aware of their own state’s density reporting law (range,
10%-22%); however, respondents from Connecticut,
home to the longest standing reporting law, were twice as
likely to be aware of existing density legislation than
respondents in the other three groups. Across all five
sample groups, the primary source of breast density
information was women’s health care providers (range,
56%-71%), followed by online research (range, 14%-
20%), and talking with family, friends, and colleagues
(14%-20%) (Table 3).
Inform Method and Discussions About
Supplemental Screening
When asked if they knew their breast density type (dense
versus nondense), women in the CT and E/DB sample
groups (70% and 60%, respectively) were significantly
more likely to know their type than women in states with
no density law (51%; P ¼ .000 and P ¼ .023, respec-
tively). Across all five sample groups, a conversation with
their clinician was the most common method through
which women were informed of their tissue type (range,
142

Volume 16 n Number 2 n February 2019
 68%-72%), followed by the mammography result letter
(range, 48%-68%), and then their radiologist (range,
46%-61%).
Among women who indicated they knew their tissue
type, a clear majority (range, 70%-79%) across all five
groups reported that they had dense breasts. Women
who had a conversation with their health care provider
or radiologist about density indicated that the physician
initiated this conversation a majority of the time (range,
70%-82%). Women in states with no law were signif-
icantly more likely to indicate that they were the ones
who initiated the conversation than women in the CT
sample group (20% versus 11%; P ¼ .031). However,
there was wide variation across the five sample groups
regarding the proportion of women who reported
having
dense
breasts
that
discussed
supplemental
screening options with their provider (range, 53%-
86%) (Table 4).
Impact of Density Reporting Laws
In February 2018, 31 states had density laws and 18 did
not; one state, North Dakota, had a law that expired and
was excluded from the density law versus no-law group
comparison. In this two-group comparison analysis,
women in states with density laws were more likely to
have been informed by their mammography results
letter than women from states without density laws
(60% versus 48%, respectively; P ¼ .011) (Table 5). In
addition,
women
from
states
with
laws
were
significantly more likely to report that their provider
talked with them about supplemental screening (67%
versus 53%, respectively; P ¼ .008).
Although most women were not aware of density
reporting laws, women from states where laws were
enacted earlier were significantly more likely to be aware
of them (12% versus 8%; P ¼ .028). Women from states
with laws enacted earlier were also significantly more

 likely to know their own breast tissue type (59% versus
50%; P ¼ .004). Among women with dense breasts,
those from states whose laws were enacted earlier were
significantly more likely to report that their clinician
talked with them about supplemental screening (71%
versus 59%; P ¼ .026).
DISCUSSION
There are several novel and important findings from our
study. First, we demonstrate that state density reporting
legislation is significantly associated with higher rates of
conversations between women with dense breasts and
their providers regarding their dense breasts. Moreover,
women from states with density reporting laws were
significantly more likely to report that they discussed
supplemental screening options. These findings suggest
that state density reporting laws are associated with
increased awareness regarding density risks.
Next, women felt strongly that that they would like to
be informed of risks associated with dense breasts, as
well as be informed of their own density category (a, b, c,
or d). This is important because several state density
reporting laws currently do not require informing women

 of specific BI-RADS density categories. Because there is
growing evidence that women with extremely dense
breasts (category d) have higher risks than women with
heterogeneously dense breasts (category c), informing
women of their density category may lead to more refined
and personalized approaches for risk-based supplemental
screening.
Although the majority of women felt that they were
knowledgeable of breast density risks, women across the
sample groups knew less about the increased inherent risk
of developing breast cancer because of dense breasts
separate from the masking effect. Thus, greater efforts
may be needed to increase women’s knowledge of specific
breast tissue categories and associated higher risks of
developing breast cancer beyond what is currently
mandated by density reporting laws.
Our survey also demonstrated that women continue
to obtain the majority of their information regarding
breast density and breast cancer risks from conversations
with their health care provider or radiologist. Women
from the three samples in which all women get a notifi-
cation after their mammogram were also more likely to
indicate that they had learned their breast density type
from radiologist result letters. Moreover, the majority of
discussions to inform women about density and risks are
initiated by the clinician or radiologist. Thus, clinicians
and radiologists need to continue developing effective
tools for educating women about density and risk-based
screening approaches.
Finally, women from states where breast density laws
have been in place longer were significantly more likely to
know their own breast tissue category. Women with
dense breasts from states where breast density laws have
been in place longer were also significantly more likely to
report discussions about supplemental screening. These
temporal trends of increased awareness and discussions
with providers are important to note given that several
state laws are due to sunset (eg, California, Florida,
Kentucky, and Washington) in the coming years.
Renewing these density reporting laws for a longer period
of time may demonstrate further improvements in
women’s risk-based screening awareness.
There were limitations to our study. Our sampling
design utilized a convenience sample of an online panel
of women. There may be both selection bias among
panelists and response bias with pressure to choose
more socially acceptable answer choices. Online panel
sampling is now the most widely used survey method
given the rapid reduction in landline use. Nevertheless,
the online panel method may lead to coverage error
because the pool of potential respondents may not be
representative of each state’s actual screening popula-
tion. Four states (Iowa, Colorado, Nebraska, and
Kentucky) had density laws in effect for less than a year
at the time of this study, which may have dampened the
observed effectiveness of density reporting laws. Our
study also had several strengths. We surveyed women
from all 50 US states with a diverse distribution of
sociodemographic
characteristics
across
all
sample
groups. We obtained a relatively large number (n ¼
300) of respondents in each group, sampling from states
with and without density reporting laws, grouped by
varying language, statutes, and durations associated
with the reporting laws. In addition, our large sample
size allowed for robust 95% confidence levels for our
descriptive statistics of �5.8% or smaller for each
survey question.
In summary, our national survey demonstrates that
density reporting laws are associated with increased breast
density awareness and higher rates of conversations be-
tween women and their providers regarding supplemental
screening. Although most women are now familiar with
the masking effect of dense breasts on mammography,
they are less aware of density’s inherent increased breast
cancer risk. Radiologists and referring clinicians are both
involved in engaging women to inform them of their
density and risks. Moving forward, patient advocacy
groups should advocate for more refined and personalized
information about a woman’s specific breast tissue
category, associated risks, and discussions regarding
supplemental screening.
TAKE-HOME POINTS
- Nearly 90% of women, regardless of density law
status, completely or mostly agree that they would
prefer to know their breast tissue type than not
know.
- Women obtain most of their information regarding
breast density and risk from their health care pro-
viders and radiologists, with women in states with
density laws more likely to learn of their dense
breasts from the mammogram results letter.
- Women in Connecticut (which has the longest
active density reporting law) and women in states
where
individual
breast
tissue
composition
is
reported are more likely to know that having
dense breasts puts a woman at an increased risk for
breast cancer.

Health Services Research and Policy n Cappello, Richetelli, Lee n Breast Density Reporting Laws
 - Having a breast density reporting law enacted in a
state increased the likelihood that women learned of
their breast tissue type from a mammogram results
letter and health care providers spoke with women
about supplemental screening.
- Women from states where density reporting laws
have been in place longer were more likely to know
their own
density type and, for those with
dense breasts, were more likely to say their health
care provider talked to them about additional
screening.
