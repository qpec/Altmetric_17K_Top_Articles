IMPORTANCE Physician assistants (PAs) are increasingly used in dermatology practices to
diagnose skin cancers, although, to date, their diagnostic accuracy compared with
board-certified dermatologists has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVE To compare diagnostic accuracy for skin cancer of PAs with that of
dermatologists.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Medical record review of 33 647 skin cancer screening
examinations in 20 270 unique patients who underwent screening at University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center–affiliated dermatology offices from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015.
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code V76.43 and International
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code Z12.83 were used
to identify pathology reports from skin cancer screening examinations by dermatologists
and PAs.
EXPOSURE Examination performed by a PA or dermatologist.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number needed to biopsy (NNB) to diagnose skin cancer
(nonmelanoma, invasive melanoma, or in situ melanoma).
RESULTS Of 20 270 unique patients, 12 722 (62.8%) were female, mean (SD) age at the first
visit was 52.7 (17.4) years, and 19 515 patients (96.3%) self-reported their race/ethnicity as
non-Hispanic white. To diagnose 1 case of skin cancer, the NNB was 3.9 for PAs and 3.3 for
dermatologists (P < .001). Per diagnosed melanoma, the NNB was 39.4 for PAs and 25.4 for
dermatologists (P = .007). Patients screened by a PA were significantly less likely than those
screened by a dermatologist to be diagnosed with melanoma in situ (1.1% vs 1.8% of visits,
P = .02), but differences were not significant for invasive melanoma (0.7% vs 0.8% of visits,
P = .83) or nonmelanoma skin cancer (6.1% vs 6.1% of visits, P = .98).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with dermatologists, PAs performed more skin
biopsies per case of skin cancer diagnosed and diagnosed fewer melanomas in situ,
suggesting that the diagnostic accuracy of PAs may be lower than that of dermatologists.
Although the availability of PAs may help increase access to care and reduce waiting times for
appointments, these findings have important implications for the training, appropriate scope
of practice, and supervision of PAs and other nonphysician practitioners in dermatology.

dvanced practice professionals (APPs), a term refer-
ring to nonphysician clinicians including nurse prac-
titioners and physician assistants (PAs), provide an in-
creasing proportion of dermatologic care, with one recent
survey finding that 46% of dermatologists employed APPs in
2014.1,2 Advanced practice professionals can help reduce wait
times,improveaccesstodermatologycare,andcostlesstohire
than dermatologists.3 However, ensuring quality of care pro-
vided by APPs is difficult because there is no formal training
or certification program in dermatology for APPs.
The autonomy with which many APPs practice, includ-
ing diagnosing and treating skin cancers without a board-
certified dermatologist present, has drawn public criticism.4
One study found that APPs must perform more skin biopsies

APPs working in dermatology in our health care system, with

differed by clinician type.
Methods
We identified and analyzed medical records of 33 647 skin
screening examinations in 20 270 unique patients at Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center–affiliated dermatology
offices from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015, using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code
V76.43 and International Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code Z12.83:
“Encounter for screening for malignant neoplasm of the skin.
”
Skin cancer pathology reports from all visits in which a lesion
was removed for pathologic examination for diagnostic pur-
poses (on the day of or up to 1 month after the office visit), ex-
cluding reexcisions, were reviewed to categorize lesions as
pigmented or nonpigmented and to obtain the final diagno-
sis. Number needed to biopsy to diagnose 1 case of skin can-
cer of any type (melanoma or nonmelanoma) and NNB to
diagnose 1 case of melanoma were calculated by clinician type.
For each visit, patient sex, age, personal history of mela-
noma, personal history of skin cancer, and clinician type (PA
or board-certified dermatologist) were extracted. This
project was reviewed and approved by the University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, which granted a waiver
of informed consent.
Years of clinical experience were calculated for each cli-
nician as of the end date of the study period. Clinical experi-
ence was calculated from the start of employment in derma-
tology for PAs and from the year of dermatology residency
completion for dermatologists. Physician assistant training in
our system is not standardized and is at the discretion of the
supervisingphysicianbutgenerallyconsistsofshadowingwith
a physician and/or a more experienced PA. Financial support
for continuing education is available for dermatologists and
PAs. Physician assistants and dermatologists are encouraged
but not required to attend monthly grand rounds, and have
accesstodermoscopicequipment,althoughstandardizedtrain-
ingindermoscopybeyondthatgainedwhileshadowingorpur-
sued independently is not provided to PAs. Physician assis-
tants do not attend resident didactic sessions.
Statistical Analysis
Visit characteristics were compared between PAs and derma-
tologists using the unpaired, 2-tailed t test and χ2 tests. Num-
ber needed to biopsy was calculated as the inverse of the ab-
solute risk of skin cancer per biopsy in univariate regression
models.TocalculateNNB,onlypigmentedlesionbiopsieswere
used for melanoma; all biopsies performed for diagnostic pur-
poses were used as the denominator for any skin cancer. Num-
ber needed to biopsy for PAs and dermatologists was com-
pared, and significance was determined using generalized
linear regression, at α = .05. Years of experience for PAs and
dermatologistswerecomparedusinga ttestwithunequalvari-
ance. All statistical analyses were performed in R, version 3.3.1
(The R Foundation).
Results
Patient and Clinician Demographic Characteristics
Of 20 270 unique patients, 12 722 (62.8%) were female, the
mean (SD) age at the first visit was 52.7 (17.4) years, and 19 515
patients (96.3%) self-reported their race/ethnicity as
non-Hispanic white. Most patients (13 151 [64.9%]) had a single
screening visit during the study period. Patients with a history
of melanoma were more likely to see a dermatologist, whereas
those with a history of any type of skin cancer were more likely
to see a PA (Table 1). Thirty clinicians (15 dermatologists and 15
PAs) provided skin cancer screening during the study period.
Physicians had more years of experience (mean [SD], 13.5 [11.7]
years) than PAs (mean [SD], 6.9 [3.6] years) (P = .03).
Visit Analyses
Compared with those seeing a dermatologist, patients seeing
a PA were slightly older (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [17.5] vs 52.1 [17.5]
years), less likely to have a history of melanoma (333 patients
[4.1%] vs 565 [5.9%]), and more likely to have a history
of any skin cancer (2214 patients [26.3%] vs 1832 [19.0%])
Key Points
Question Are physician assistants and dermatologists equally
accurate in diagnosing skin cancer in patients undergoing
screening?
Findings In this medical record review of 33 647 skin cancer
screening examinations in 20 270 unique patients, physician
assistants needed to biopsy 39.4 pigmented lesions and
dermatologists needed to biopsy 25.4 pigmented lesions to
diagnose 1 case of melanoma. Patients screened by a physician
assistant were significantly less likely than those screened by a
dermatologist to be diagnosed with melanoma in situ.
Meaning Compared with dermatologists, physician assistants
have lower diagnostic accuracy for melanoma.

 (all P < .001). Physician assistants performed more biopsies
overall (3928 visits [22.9%] vs 3427 [20.8%], P < .001) and of
pigmentedlesions(2213visits[12.9%]vs1826[11.1%],P < .001)
than dermatologists. Screenings performed by dermatolo-
gists were more likely to result in a diagnosis of melanoma in
situ (58 visits [1.8%] vs 40 [1.1%], P = .02), but not invasive
melanomas (25 visits [0.8%] vs 26 [0.7%], P = .83) or nonmela-
noma skin cancer (993 visits [6.1%] vs 1031 [6.1%], P = .98).
Breslow depth for invasive melanomas did not differ signifi-
cantly by clinician type (Table 2). To diagnose 1 case of skin
cancer, the mean NNB was 3.9 (95% CI, 3.7-4.1) for PAs and 3.3
(95% CI, 3.2-3.5) for dermatologists (P < .001). To diagnose
1 case of melanoma, the mean NNB was 39.4 (95% CI, 31.1-
49.8) for PAs and 25.4 (95% CI, 20.6-31.3) for dermatologists
(P = .007) (Table 3).
Discussion
Physician assistants performed more skin biopsies to detect
melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer than did derma-
tologists. In addition, PAs were less likely than dermatolo-
gists to diagnose melanoma in situ during a skin cancer
screening visit.
Our findings are consistent with those of Nault et al,5 who
found a significantly higher NNB among APPs, primarily nurse
practitioners, compared with dermatologists submitting di-
agnostic specimens for dermatopathologic evaluation. How-
ever, our study included more patients and data from nearly
7 times as many biopsies. By focusing on visits coded as skin
cancer screenings, we could determine the NNB and the pro-
portion of visits resulting in skin cancer diagnosis. Although
few data are available on the NNB for PAs, a large German skin
cancer screening initiative, in which dermatologists made the
decisions to biopsy or not, reported an NNB of 28 to diagnose
1 case of melanoma,6 similar to our mean NNB of 25.4 for der-
matologists. However, both are higher than the NNB of 17.4 for
dermatologists reported by Nault et al.5
The lower detection rate among PAs of melanomas in situ,
which are often more challenging to diagnose than invasive
melanomas, likely reflects lower clinician sensitivity. Physi-
cian assistants and dermatologists had similar detection rates

 forinvasivemelanomasandnonmelanomaskincancers,which
tend to be more clinically obvious, suggesting that this differ-
ence is not the result of a difference in the risk pool of pa-
tients seen by each clinician type. This distinction is further
supportedbythefindingthat,incomparisonwithpatientsseen
by a dermatologist, patients seen by a PA were somewhat less
likely to have a history of melanoma but more likely to have a
history of skin cancer overall.
In terms of mortality, the consequences of diagnosing
melanoma in situ are unclear. However, assuming that some
fraction of these lesions will progress to ultimately fatal inva-
sive melanoma, early detection and treatment of melanoma
at the in situ stage should be beneficial to the patient in terms
of prognosis and decreased morbidity for the requisite surgi-
cal intervention. In addition to its likely favorable conse-
quences for patient outcomes, treatment of melanoma in situ
is significantly less expensive than treatment of invasive
melanoma.7
Dermatology is one of the highest employers of APPs in
medicine, and this trend is likely to continue, particularly as
more dermatology practices are acquired by private equity
firms with an obligation to shareholders to maximize profits.8
Most procedures performed independently by APPs are diag-
nostic skin biopsies, suggesting that a large portion of skin can-
cer diagnosis in the United States is being performed by these
practitioners.1 Measuring the quality of care delivered by prac-
titioners is challenging. The American Academy of Dermatol-
ogy recommends that APPs should provide care only after a
dermatologisthasevaluatedthepatient,madeadiagnosis,and
developed a treatment plan.9 Determining proficiency to prac-
tice when no objective measure, such as specialty certifica-
tion for PAs, exists means that dermatologists who use PAs
must take seriously the responsibility to train and supervise
them appropriately and monitor the quality of care deliv-
ered. We propose that measuring NNB for each clinician may
help to objectively assess performance. This undertaking may
not be practical for all settings, but if a practice sends all its pa-
thology specimens to a single laboratory, NNB could be esti-
mated by dividing the sum of the number of melanomas, nevi,
and seborrheic keratoses biopsied by the number of melano-
masbiopsiedperclinician.Thisquotientwouldgivesomefeed-
back about each clinician’
s performance, allowing dermatolo-
gists to identify outlier APPs (and dermatologists).
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the large number of visits
analyzed and the ability to measure NNB and rates of skin
cancer detection from screening visits. However, there are
some limitations to our approach. We may have missed skin
cancer screenings occurring during other visit types. How-
ever, this approach was previously validated with sensitiv-
ity analyses10 and missed less than 20% of skin examina-
tions occurring in other visit types. Although we attempted
to control for differences in patient risk factors for skin can-
cer retrospectively by stratifying results by patient history
of melanoma, we were not able to capture all risk factors
(eg, history of sun exposure, nevus count, and family his-
tory of melanoma), and patients who believed they were at
high risk for melanoma may have chosen to see a derma-
tologist rather than a PA. Physician assistants in our system
have dermatologists available for consultation; therefore, it
is likely that occasionally the decision to perform a biopsy
was made by the consulted dermatologist, and this would
not be captured because the PA would be listed as the visit
clinician. Our findings also may not be representative of all
practice settings. Physician assistants at University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center–affiliated dermatology offices are
likely better trained than most, as they have the opportu-
nity to attend some educational sessions and grand rounds
and are provided time and funding to attend educational
meetings; thus, we would expect that the differences we
observe would only be magnified in other practice settings,
such as those in which PAs receive limited training and
practice with no supervising dermatologist on-site.
Conclusions
In the age of cost-conscious medicine, it is important to con-
sider more than just clinician salary in determining cost of
care. Visits in which skin cancers are missed and/or biopsies
are performed on benign lesions owing to lower diagnostic
accuracy are low-value visits and increase the potential
harm to patients. This information should be factored into
policy decisions about scope of practice, hiring decisions,
supervision of APPs, and patient decisions about who
provides their dermatologic care.
