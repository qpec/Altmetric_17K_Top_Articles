Abstract
Background
Sex workers are at disproportionate risk of violence and sexual and emotional ill health,
harms that have been linked to the criminalisation of sex work. We synthesised evidence on
the extent to which sex work laws and policing practices affect sex workers’ safety, health,
and access to services, and the pathways through which these effects occur.
Methods and findings
We searched bibliographic databases between 1 January 1990 and 9 May 2018 for qualita-
tive and quantitative research involving sex workers of all genders and terms relating to leg-
islation, police, and health. We operationalised categories of lawful and unlawful police
repression of sex workers or their clients, including criminal and administrative penalties.
We included quantitative studies that measured associations between policing and out-
comes of violence, health, and access to services, and qualitative studies that explored
related pathways. We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the average effect of
experiencing sexual/physical violence, HIV or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and
condomless sex, among individuals exposed to repressive policing compared to those
unexposed. Qualitative studies were synthesised iteratively, inductively, and thematically.
We reviewed 40 quantitative and 94 qualitative studies. Repressive policing of sex workers
was associated with increased risk of sexual/physical violence from clients or other parties
(odds ratio [OR] 2.99, 95% CI 1.96–4.57), HIV/STI (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.60–2.19), and con-
domless sex (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03–1.94). The qualitative synthesis identified diverse
forms of police violence and abuses of power, including arbitrary arrest, bribery and extor-
tion, physical and sexual violence, failure to provide access to justice, and forced HIV test-
ing. It showed that in contexts of criminalisation, the threat and enactment of police

the UK Department for International Development
(DFID) as part of STRIVE, a 6-year programme of
research and action devoted to tackling the
 harassment and arrest of sex workers or their clients displaced sex workers into isolated
work locations, disrupting peer support networks and service access, and limiting risk reduc-
tion opportunities. It discouraged sex workers from carrying condoms and exacerbated
existing inequalities experienced by transgender, migrant, and drug-using sex workers. Evi-
dence from decriminalised settings suggests that sex workers in these settings have greater
negotiating power with clients and better access to justice. Quantitative findings were limited
by high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis for some outcomes and insufficient data to con-
duct meta-analyses for others, as well as variable sample size and study quality. Few stud-
ies reported whether arrest was related to sex work or another offence, limiting our ability to
assess the associations between sex work criminalisation and outcomes relative to other
penalties or abuses of police power, and all studies were observational, prohibiting any
causal inference. Few studies included trans- and cisgender male sex workers, and little evi-
dence related to emotional health and access to healthcare beyond HIV/STI testing.
Conclusions
Together, the qualitative and quantitative evidence demonstrate the extensive harms asso-
ciated with criminalisation of sex work, including laws and enforcement targeting the sale
and purchase of sex, and activities relating to sex work organisation. There is an urgent
need to reform sex-work-related laws and institutional practices so as to reduce harms and
barriers to the realisation of health.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• To our knowledge there has been no evidence synthesis of qualitative and quantitative
literature examining the impacts of criminalisation on sex workers’ safety and health, or
the pathways that realise these effects.
• This evidence is critical to informing evidenced-based policy-making, and timely given
the growing interest in models of decriminalisation of sex work or criminalising the
purchase of sex (the latter recently introduced in Canada, France, Northern Ireland,
Republic of Ireland, and Serbia).
What did the researchers do and find?
• We undertook a mixed-methods review comprising meta-analyses and qualitative syn-
thesis to measure the magnitude of associations, and related pathways, between crimi-
nalisation and sex workers’ experience of violence, sexual (including HIV and sexually
transmitted infections [STIs]) and emotional health, and access to health and social care
services.
• We searched bibliographic databases for qualitative and quantitative research, categoris-
ing lawful and unlawful police repression, including criminal and administrative penal-
ties within different legislative models.

 • Meta-analyses suggest that on average repressive policing practices of sex workers were
associated with increased risk of sexual/physical violence from clients or other partners
across 9 studies and 5,204 participants.
• Sex workers who had been exposed to repressive policing practices were on average at
increased risk of infection with HIV/STI compared to those who had not, across 12,506
participants from 11 studies. Repressive policing of sex workers was associated with
increased risk of condomless sex across 9,447 participants from 4 studies.
• The qualitative synthesis showed that in contexts of any criminalisation, repressive
policing of sex workers, their clients, and/or sex work venues disrupted sex workers’
work environments, support networks, safety and risk reduction strategies, and access
to health services and justice. It demonstrated how policing within all criminalisation
and regulation frameworks exacerbated existing marginalisation, and how sex workers’
relationships with police, access to justice, and negotiating powers with clients have
improved in decriminalised contexts.
What do these findings mean?
• The quantitative evidence clearly shows the association between repressive policing
within frameworks of full or partial sex work criminalisation—including the criminali-
sation of clients and the organisation of sex work—and adverse health outcomes.
• Qualitative evidence demonstrates how repressive policing of sex workers, their clients,
and/or sex work venues deprioritises sex workers’ safety, health, and rights and hinders
access to due process of law. The removal of criminal and administrative sanctions for
sex work is needed to improve sex workers’ health and access to services and justice.
• More research is needed in order to document how criminalisation and decriminalisa-
tion interact with other structural factors, policies, and realities (e.g., poverty, housing,
drugs, and immigration) in different contexts, to inform appropriate interventions and
advocacy alongside legal reform.
Introduction
Sex workers can face multiple interdependent health risks [1,2]. Between 32% and 55% of cis-
gender (cis) women working mostly in street-based sex work report experience of workplace
violence in the past year [3]. Across diverse settings, both cis and transgender (trans) women
and men in sex work are at increased risk of experiencing violence and homicide [4–6], HIV
infection [7–9], chlamydia and gonorrhoea [10,11], and poorer mental health than their non-
sex-working counterparts [12]. Yet there is considerable variation within sex-working popula-
tions [13,14]. The epidemiological context as well as social and structural factors and power
relations reproduce inequalities within sex-working populations [2,3,8,9]. For example, cis
women working in street-based sex work are more vulnerable to all these outcomes than those
working in off-street settings [15,16]. Many vulnerabilities faced by sex workers are multiplica-
tive, closely linked to poverty, substance use, disability, immigration, sexism, racism, transpho-
bia, and homophobia [17].

 Qualitative literature demonstrates how social policies and structural factors shape the
health and welfare of sex workers. The ‘risk environment’ concept, developed to understand
drug-related harms [18] and adapted to HIV and violence experienced by sex workers [19,20],
examines different types (physical, social, economic, and political) and levels of environmental
influence (micro and macro), in line with broader efforts to address structural determinants of
health [21]. This concept has been used to demonstrate how policing, stigma, and inequalities
interplay to shape sex workers’ vulnerability to HIV [22], violence [23], and lack of access to
healthcare [24] and justice [25,26], and the potential for sex-worker-led interventions to chal-
lenge these harms [27]. Epidemiological evidence documents the associations between macro-
structural factors (laws, housing and economic insecurity, migration, education, and stigma)
and work environment and community factors (policing, work setting and conditions, auton-
omy, and access to health and peer-led services) and sex workers’ risk of violence and HIV
transmission [2,3]. Criminalisation and repressive public health approaches to sex work (e.g.,
mandatory registration and HIV/sexually transmitted infection [STI] testing) have been
shown to hinder the prevention of HIV, where the focus of interventions and research has
been directed [28–30]. Conversely, mathematical modelling has estimated that decriminalisa-
tion of sex work could halve the incidence of HIV among sex workers and their clients over a
10-year period [2], and evidence from New Zealand indicates that sex workers in decrimina-
lised settings report improved workplace safety, health and social care access, and emotional
health [31,32].
Broadly, there are 5 legislative models used to manage, control, or regulate sex work
(Table 1) [33]. Full criminalisation prohibits all organisational aspects of sex work and selling
and buying sex. Partial criminalisation is where some aspects of sex work are penalised (e.g.,
soliciting sex in public for sex workers and/or clients, advertising services, collective working,
or involvement of third parties). In 1999, Sweden criminalised the purchase, but not the sale,
of sex, and various other countries have followed [34]. This ‘criminalisation of clients’ model
typically retains laws against ‘brothel-keeping’, which may in practice also target sex workers
working together. Regulatory models make the sale of sex legal in certain settings (e.g., in
licensed brothels or managed zones) or under certain conditions (e.g., mandatory registration
or HIV/STI testing) but illegal in other settings or for individuals who do not meet registration
requirements or eligibility criteria (e.g., migrants, cis men and trans sex workers, or people liv-
ing with HIV) [35]. Full decriminalisation, implemented in New Zealand in 2003, removes
criminal penalties for adult sex work, emphasises enforcing criminal laws prohibiting violence

 and coercion, and regulates the sex industry through occupational health and safety standards
[36]. All models criminalise coerced sex work and the involvement of minors, and almost all
models—including decriminalisation in New Zealand—prohibit migrants without permanent
residency from working legally or in a regulated environment. In practice the implementation
of these models through bylaws and enforcement practices is complex, and varies between and
within countries and even locally within cities [37,38].
The debate around sex work policy and legislation is highly polarised. Some argue that all
sex work is itself gendered violence and should be repressed—a notion that underpins the
criminalisation of sex workers’ clients [39,40]. Others argue that this fails to recognise the
diversity of experience and identity in the sex industry and the possibility that financial reim-
bursement for sex between adults can be consensual [41]. At a time of increasing political
interest in legislative reform [42–45], there is a critical need to bring together this evidence to
inform policies that protect sex workers’ safety, health, well-being, and broader rights. We con-
ducted a systematic review to synthesise evidence of the extent to which sex work laws and
their enforcement affect sex workers’ safety, health and access to services, and the processes
and pathways through which these effects occur, including in interaction with other macro-
structural, community, and work environment factors.
Methods
Data extraction and quality assessment
Following a protocol with pre-specified search terms, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psy-
chINFO, Web of Science, and Global Health for public health and social science literature on
studies that combined 3 search domains: (1) sex work, AND (2) legislation OR policing, AND
(3) health (physical or emotional, including violence/safety) OR access to services (including
health, risk reduction, and social care/support). The complete search terms and review proto-
col are attached (S1 Text). Meta-analyses were not pre-specified, since they were subject to
identifying sufficiently homogenous studies in relation to outcomes and definition of
criminalisation.
Three authors screened the sources for inclusion, discussing any uncertainties within the
team; a second person re-reviewed relevant sources when necessary. Quantitative data were
extracted and analysed by LP and JE, and qualitative data synthesised by PG and RM. For qual-
itative and quantitative studies, we defined quality-related criteria adapted from the Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) [46] that papers had to fulfil in order to qualify for inclu-
sion: methods and ethics processes described, appropriate study population clearly defined,
and conclusions supported by study findings. Quantitative studies were further assessed
according to appropriateness of study design, data collection methods, and analyses, using
assessment approaches adapted from the Newcastle–Ottawa scale and CASP [46,47]. A full
copy of the quality assessment process for the quantitative studies is available (S1 Table). For
qualitative evidence, confidence in review findings was assessed according to CERQual guid-
ance, taking account of methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy of data, and relevance
of included studies (S2 Text) [48]. Methodological limitations were assessed using CASP
guidelines for qualitative evidence.
Definitions
We included studies with sex workers of all genders who currently or have ever exchanged sex-
ual services for money, drugs, or other material goods. We included research on all models of
sex work legislation and used the following definition of the criminalisation of sex work: ‘a
model of intervention in which the criminal law is used to manage, control, repress, prohibit

 or otherwise influence the growth, instance or expression of prostitution’ [33]. We also
included the use of non-criminal penalties to target sex workers, such as fines and displace-
ment orders, including those that do not formally relate to sex work. Within the broad legisla-
tive models (Table 1), sex work legislation and policing was operationalised into 8 different
categories of police exposure: (1) police repression on an environment in which sex work takes
place (workplace raids, zoning restrictions, and displacement from usual working areas), (2)
recent (within last year) arrest or prison, (3) past arrest or prison, (4) confiscation of condoms
or needles or syringes, (5) extortion (giving police information, money, or goods to avoid
arrest), (6) sexual or physical violence from police (negotiated or forced), (7) fear of police
repression, and (8) registration as a sex worker at a municipal health authority. Where clear
from included papers, we recorded data on gender using the terms ‘cis’ and ‘trans’ to refer to
people who do and do not identify themselves with the gender they were assigned at birth,
respectively. Conscious of cultural diversity in gender identities, we use the term ‘transfemi-
nine’ to describe feminine-presenting trans populations that do not necessarily describe them-
selves as female/women [49]. We did not identify any papers that discussed the experiences of
people who identify their gender as trans male/masculine or non-binary.
Inclusion criteria
We included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies published in English, Rus-
sian, or Spanish, and included data specific to the experiences of sex workers. We included
papers that measured quantitative associations between criminalisation or decriminalisation
of sex work, or repressive policing practices within these contexts, and the following outcomes:
threatened or enacted violence, STIs, HIV, hepatitis B/C, overdose, stress, anxiety, depression,
risk practices/management (e.g., working with others, reporting violence, condom use, sharing
needles/syringes), and access to health/social care services (HIV/STI/hepatitis prevention, test-
ing, and treatment; contraception; abortion; opioid substitution therapy and other drug/alco-
hol services; mental health and counselling; primary and secondary care; psychosocial support
services; housing; and social security). We also included studies that reported qualitative data
on the relationships between experiences of criminalisation or decriminalisation and policing
and sex workers’ experiences of violence, safety, health, risk management, and/or accessing
health or social care services, from the perspectives of sex workers themselves.
Data synthesis
We synthesised estimates that adjusted for confounders to assess overall risk of experience of
physical or sexual violence, HIV/STI, and condomless sex, stratified by the categories of
repressive police activities described above. Where multiple policing practice exposures were
presented in the same study, we selected independent estimates in an overall pooled estimate
prioritising recent experience of arrest/prison and the most commonly occurring outcomes.
Studies including sex workers of different genders were pooled together. We applied random
effects models using the DerSimonian and Laird method for all analyses, allowing for hetero-
geneity between studies and converting all effect estimates into odds ratios (ORs) [50]. We
examined heterogeneity with the I2 statistic. We conducted sub-group analyses to describe dif-
ferences in experience of violence and condom use by partner type (client versus intimate part-
ner/other) and by type of violence (physical versus sexual or sexual/physical combined). We
conducted sensitivity analyses to look at overall associations between policing and our speci-
fied outcomes, excluding or pooling studies that did not adjust for confounders or reported
only STI outcomes (self-reported and biological) or composite HIV/STI, and altering the pri-
ority choice of police exposure (from recent arrest/prison to other). We conducted a narrative

 synthesis of outcomes that were too heterogeneous to pool, including access to services (both
mandatory and voluntary uptake of services), harms related to drug use, and emotional health.
Studies that measured associations with registration at the municipal health department were
also synthesised separately, since this policy was less comparable with all others that involved
direct police action. All analyses were conducted using the metafor package in R version 3.4.1
and RStudio version 1.0.143 [51].
For qualitative studies, data were synthesised inductively, iteratively, and thematically.
From the body of eligible papers we first focused on the ‘data-rich’ papers that contributed
substantive or moderate data and analyses relevant to our research questions. Among the body
of papers that had a limited focus on the topic, we then purposively sampled studies that
reported on an under-represented population, setting, legislative model, or health issue of
interest in this review [52] until no new themes emerged (thematic saturation). For the data-
rich papers, we reviewed and wrote summaries of the results and discussion sections, induc-
tively and iteratively drawing out author- and reviewer-identified themes and sub-themes. We
then linked sub-themes and themes to 4 core categories, informed by concepts of structural,
symbolic, and everyday violence that argue that mistreatment, stigma, exclusion, and ill health
often result from intersecting inequalities that become institutionalised and normalised
through policies, practices, and social norms [53]. We paid careful attention to the different
levels and forms of environmental influence within risk environments [18]. Finally, we
reviewed the less data-rich papers (relative to our research questions) against these emerging
categories until they required no further refining. We summarise the core categories narra-
tively with illustrative quotes (Box 1), drawing out findings that help to unpack the quantitative
associations and their causal pathways. Within each category, we pay close attention to pat-
terns by legislative model.
Results
From 9,148 papers identified, 134 studies met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 40 papers
included in the quantitative synthesis, of which 20 were included in the meta-analysis and 20
in the narrative synthesis. A total of 94 met the inclusion criteria for the qualitative synthesis,
of which 46 were included in the thematic analysis, 3 were excluded following quality assess-
ment, and 45 were excluded when thematic saturation had been reached (Fig 1).
Quantitative synthesis
Included quantitative studies.
We identified 40 studies that measured the association
between an aspect of police repression of sex workers or their clients and our outcomes of
interest. The majority of the studies were cross-sectional (28) or serial cross-sectional (2); there
were 9 prospective cohorts [27,54–61] and baseline data from 1 randomised control trial [62].
Studies were conducted in a variety of countries representing some but not all of the main sex
work legislative models (Table 1). Partial criminalisation was represented in 10 studies in Can-
ada, 6 studies in India, 3 studies in Russian Federation, 2 studies in Argentina, and 1 each in
Co
ˆte D’Ivoire, Spain and UK. Full criminalisation was represented in 3 studies in Uganda, 2
studies in China, and 1 each in Iran, Rwanda, and South Korea. Regulation models were repre-
sented by 8 studies in Mexico. No quantitative studies examined the effects of the criminalisa-
tion of sex purchase in isolation, or the effects of decriminalisation. Outcomes reported
included the following: sexual or physical violence (n = 10) [57–59,63–69], HIV and/or STI
prevalence (n = 15) [54,60,63,67,70–78], condom use (n = 5) [71,74,78–82], access to services
(n = 8) [56,61,63,71,80,83–85], aspects of drug use (n = 6) [27,46,62,63,66,86,87], and emo-
tional ill health (n = 3) [55,60,88]. Two studies focused on the association between

 criminalisation and social and criminal justice factors including further extortion by the
police or history of arrest [63], any contact with the criminal justice system, being a migrant,
and unstable housing [60]. The majority of studies focused on cis women, with the exception
of 6 that included trans women (n = 5) and cis men (n = 1) in Canada and Argentina
[27,55,56,60,61,70]. Location of sex work was diverse across street and off-street settings.
All studies reported an association between lawful or unlawful repressive police actions
towards sex workers and outcomes, of which 21 adjusted for confounders. We synthesised 4
studies that reported an effect estimate associated with a mandatory registration separately
[79,81,89,90] but considered lawful and unlawful repressive police activities within the regula-
tory system as part of the pooled analysis [63,72,91]. Three studies presented effect estimates
associated with a policy change, STIs, and rushing negotiation with clients, and were also con-
sidered separately [57,77,92]. Twenty studies reported on outcomes relating to HIV/STI preva-
lence, violence, and condom use, on which our primary meta-analyses are based.
Characteristics of all studies are summarised in Table 2.
HIV and STI outcomes.
Meta-analysis of 12 independent multivariable estimates showed
that any type of repressive police practice was associated with twice the odds of HIV/STI
(12,506 participants, OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.60–2.19), with little heterogeneity between studies
(I2 = 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0%–0.0%, p = 0.99). Sub-group analysis suggested that people who had
their needles/syringes or condoms confiscated had higher odds of HIV/STIs than those who
did not (2,924 participants, OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.76–3.37, I2 = 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0%–0.0%, p =
0.99). Sex workers who had experienced sexual or physical violence from police had higher
odds of HIV/STI compared to those who had not (1,827 participants, OR 2.27 95% CI 1.67–
3.08, I2 = 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0%–98.6%, p = 0.79) (Fig 2).
The overall effect estimate of repressive policing actions on HIV/STI outcomes was main-
tained across sensitivity analyses including those focusing on unadjusted estimates (OR 1.85,
95% CI 1.49–2.30, I2 = 14.0%, 95% CI 0.0%–81.1%, p = 0.32) (S1 Fig), those focusing on HIV
outcomes only (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54–2.28, I2 = 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0%–0.0%, p = 0.98), and those
excluding self-reported STI symptoms (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.58–2.31, I2 = 0.0%, 95% CI 0.0%–
0.0%, p = 0.99) (S4 Fig).
Violence.
We pooled data from 9 studies that measured the association between repres-
sive policing activities and experience of physical or sexual violence against sex workers by a
range of perpetrators, including clients, intimate (sex) partners, and police. Random effects
meta-analysis of 9 independent multivariable estimates showed that, overall, repressive polic-
ing was associated with substantially higher odds of any kind of violence (5,204 participants,
OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.96–4.57), but with high heterogeneity (I2 = 83.1%, 95% CI 65.3%–96.0%, p
< 0.001). Sub-group analysis suggested that those who had their needles/syringes or condoms
confiscated had higher odds of violence than those who did not (1,696 participants, OR 4.67,
95% CI 1.32–16.54, I2 = 93.9%, 95% CI 76.2%–99.8%, p < 0.01) (Fig 3).
This overall association between police repression and violence increased slightly, but was
still associated with substantially higher odds of violence, when all unadjusted estimates were
pooled from 6 studies (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.99–4.99, I2 = 78.7%, 95% CI 52.5%–97.4%, p < 0.001)
(S2 Fig). Odds of experiencing physical or sexual violence by other people (defined as anyone
other than paying clients, including the police) was higher for those who had experienced any
type of repressive police activity compared to those who had not (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.74–7.95,
I2 = 84.1%, 95% CI 53.5%–99.0%, p < 0.001). Similarly, physical or sexual violence from clients
was higher among those who had been exposed to repressive police activity compared to those

 multivariable estimates (9,447 participants) suggested that on average these practices were
associated with increased odds of not using a condom (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03–1.94), with mod-
erate heterogeneity across the studies (I2 = 63.34%, 95% CI 0.0%–98.2%, p = 0.04) (Fig 4).
The overall association between repressive policing activities and condom use increased
when pooling unadjusted estimates from 2 studies (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.30–2.38, I2 = 0.0%, 95%
CI 0.0%–0.98%, p = 0.46) (S3 Fig). Sub-group analysis suggested that the odds of condomless
sex with clients was higher following policing exposure (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03–1.94, I2 =
63.3%, 95% CI 0.0%–98.2%, p = 0.04) or when additional money was offered (OR 1.54, 95% CI
1.10–2.15, I2 = 66.7%, 0.0%–97.8%, p = 0.03). There was no difference in the odds of condom-
less sex with non-paying partners after police exposure (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.80–1.24, I2 = 0.0%,
95% CI 0.0%–17.7, p = 0.97) (S4 Fig).
Access to services and mandatory testing.
Five studies looked at the association between

 (including displacement, legal restrictions of sex work areas, and police harassment) was asso-
ciated with disrupted HIV treatment [56]. In Uganda, rushed negotiations with clients due to
police presence was associated with less frequent dual contraceptive use (OR 0.65, 95% CI
0.42–1.00, p = 0.05) [83]. In a study in China, where HIV testing is mandatory following deten-
tion, history of arrest was associated with increased odds of having an HIV test or taking up
HIV prevention interventions, but fear of arrest was associated with decreased odds of both
HIV testing (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55–1.12, p = 0.18) and accessing prevention interventions (OR
0.39, 95% CI 0.22–0.68, p < 0.001) [80].
Emotional ill health.
Three studies looked at indicators of emotional ill health. In India,
cis female sex workers mostly working on the street who had been arrested had increased odds
of major depression (defined through Patient Health Questionnaire–2) (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–
2.3, p = 0.05) compared to those who had not been arrested [88]. In Canada, recent incarcera-
tion was associated with poor emotional health outcomes among both cis and trans female sex
workers in a univariable analysis (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12–2.14, p < 0.10) [60]. Among the same
population, individuals who reported that the police had affected where they worked had
increased work stress compared to those who did not report this [55].

 Drug and alcohol use. Five studies examined the association between repressive policing
practices and drug use including injecting drug use [60,66,86,87], the use of non-prescription
opioids [27], and excessive alcohol drinking [60,66]. All of these studies showed a positive
association between exposure to repressive policing practices and drug/alcohol use. One study
among cis female sex workers in Mexico who inject drugs found a positive association between
police confiscation of needles/syringes and injecting in public places (linked to increased risk
of skin and soft tissue injuries but reduced risk of overdose) (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.4, p-value
not reported), as well as injecting in the groin area (linked to increased risk of overdose) (OR
1.9, 95% CI 1.2–2.9, p-value not reported), but reduced odds of injecting with clients (poten-
tially linked to sharing needles/syringes but reduced risk of overdose) (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44–
0.94, p-value not reported) [63]. Another study with the same population found that confisca-
tion of needles/syringes was associated with lower safe injection self-efficacy at 8 months
(−0.51, SE 0.25, p = 0.04) [62]. Recent history of incarceration was associated with use of crys-
tal methamphetamine among cis female sex workers in Iran [86].
Registration at a municipal health service. Four studies reported associations between
mandatory registration at a city health service in Tijuana, Mexico and health outcomes
[79,81,89,90]. One study suggested that registered sex workers had reduced odds of working in
a sex work venue with high prevalence of HIV or syphilis and testing positive for HIV or an
STI (syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chlamydia) univariably. These associations became insignificant
after adjusting for injecting risk behaviours, age, and time in sex work [79]. Of note, sex work-
ers who test positive for HIV in this system have their registration revoked, and sex workers
already living with HIV cannot work in the regulated sector; therefore, sex workers who know
or suspect they are living with HIV are unlikely to register. Registered sex workers had reduced
odds of ever injecting drugs and higher odds of being tested for HIV [81]. A final study sug-
gested that lack of registration was associated with increased odds of unprotected sex (OR 2.1,
95% CI 1.2–3.5, p-value not reported) [90].
Evaluation of sex work policies.
Two studies in Canada evaluated a new policing guide-
line that prioritised enforcement of laws against clients and third parties over arrest of sex
workers introduced in Vancouver in 2013. These studies found that there was no decrease in
physical and sexual violence (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.59–2.04, p = 0.78) among participants sur-
veyed after 2013 compared to those surveyed before, but there was increased report of rushed
negotiations with clients due to police presence (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.03–2.90, p-value not
reported) [57,92]. The introduction of an anti-trafficking policy in South Korea, accompanied
by brothel closures, in 2010 was associated with a decrease in prevalence of gonorrhoea and
antibodies to Treponema pallidum (indicating current or past infection), but also changes in
the demographic profile of sex workers. Sex workers were younger in surveys conducted after
the act compared to before, which may contribute to the lower prevalence of infection,
although sex workers reported receiving more clients [77].
Qualitative synthesis
Included qualitative studies.
From the 94 eligible papers including qualitative data, we
generated 4 core analytical categories over 37 unique analyses (papers) in different legislative
frameworks and geographical settings, refining these through the inclusion of a further 9 pur-
posively sampled papers (S3 Text). Studies were undertaken in a range of legislative models:
Full criminalisation models were represented in 3 papers in the US; 2 papers each in Cambo-
dia, Kenya, Serbia, South Africa, and Sri Lanka; and 1 paper each in Australia, China, Nepal,
Pakistan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Partial criminalisation models were represented in analyses
from 5 papers in Canada and 1 paper each in Hong Kong, India, Nigeria, Thailand, and the

 UK. Five papers focused on Canada following the introduction of criminalisation of clients,
and 1 on Sweden, where that model is in place. Regulatory models—which criminalise those
non-compliant with regulations including tolerance zones, regulated venues, and/or manda-
tory registration at a health care facility—were represented by 2 papers each from Australia,
Guatemala, Mexico, and the US and 1 from Turkey. Four papers related to New Zealand,
where sex work has been decriminalised. In total, interviews with 2,199 sex workers were ana-
lysed, representing a range of sex work locations (including street settings, truck stops, broth-
els, massage parlours, bars, night clubs, hotels, lodges, and homes) and means of meeting
clients (including organised in person, via phone or online, independently, and via third par-
ties). Most studies focused on cis women exclusively (n = 25), with a minority including sub-
samples of trans women or transfeminine people (n = 18) or cis men (n = 9). Just 2 papers
focused exclusively on the experiences of trans sex workers, and 1 on male sex workers. Ten
studies included interviews with other actors associated with sex work, including clients,
venue managers/owners, police, and outreach workers, but our analyses focused on data from
sex workers themselves. Characteristics of included studies (data-rich and purposively sam-
pled) [22,26,34–36,49,93–132] are summarised in Table 3, indicating which papers were pur-
posively selected. A list of the other papers that were identified but not included is available
(S3 Text).
Core analytical categories identified include disrupted workspaces and safety strategies;
institutionalised violence, coercion, and extortion, and restricted access to justice; reproduc-
tion of multiple stigmas and inequalities; and restricted access to health and social care and
support (S4 Text). Illustrative quotes from the core categories are summarised in Box 1.
Core category 1: Disrupted workspaces and safety strategies.
In contexts of full or par-
tial criminalisation, laws against soliciting or communication in public places for the purpose
of prostitution—and feared or actual arrest—compromised street-based sex workers’ safety by
rushing or displacing client screening and negotiations to secluded places, resulting in greater
vulnerability to violence and theft by clients and others (Quote 1) [22,98,121,122,125,130]. For
sex workers operating indoors, these laws impeded direct negotiations with clients and com-
munication between peers about safety and sexual health [121]. This pattern persisted in con-
texts where clients were criminalised. Since it was in clients’ and sex workers’ mutual interest
to avoid police detection, and because increased police presence and reduced number of cli-
ents led to the need to work longer hours [34,114], sex workers limited, rushed, or forewent
usual client screening and negotiation, and were displaced to more isolated areas, increasing
their exposure to violence and sexual health risks (Quotes 2, 3, 4a, and 4b) [34,114]. In Canada,
cis and trans female sex workers continued to be displaced by police in areas undergoing gen-
trification, and, even when they were not targeted, some still experienced police presence as
harassment [26,114]. Across diverse contexts, experience of possession of condoms being used
as evidence of sex work, and experience of police raids where condoms had been confiscated,
led to sex workers not carrying, using, or accessing condoms consistently [93,98,106,109] and
venues restricting or not providing them [93,98,109,118]. In South Australia, sex workers
attributed the latter to increased raids, closures, and the recent arrest of a venue owner [98].
Laws against brothel-keeping and bawdy houses left sex workers in the UK [123] and Can-
ada [102,121] having to choose between working safely with other sex workers and/or third
parties (e.g., security guards and drivers) and avoiding arrest by working in isolation (Quote
5), and deterred venue managers from providing sexual health training and supplies [93,121].
A lack of legal protection left sex workers vulnerable to exploitation by venue managers who
could restrict access to information on their working and legal rights [121,123].
Anti-trafficking policies in Cambodia and attempts to ‘eliminate’ sex work in China
resulted in police crackdowns on brothels, which displaced sex workers to unfamiliar and

 sometimes isolated locations (e.g., the street, bars, massage parlours, and private accommoda-

were more vulnerable to sexual and other violence both from police and perpetrators posing as

 but, in common with experiences in Sri Lanka [120], others encouraged them to provide offi-
cers free sexual services to avoid their prosecution [132]. In India, some brothel owners paid
police to avoid raids, or allowed pre-selected sex workers to be arrested [99]. Police harass-
ment, raids [35,110,120], undercover operations, entrapment, and pressure to act as infor-
mants [97,128] generated fear, anxiety, and stress, with media sometimes publicising sex
workers’ faces during raids [120].
Conversely, where certain indoor work places were informally approved by police in a
wider landscape of criminalisation, as occurred in low-barrier housing for women in Canada,
the removed threat of criminal penalties fostered venue-level safety strategies, in which sex
workers could refuse unprotected sex or call the police in the event of a client becoming violent
(Quote 7) [113]. Similarly, in the context of decriminalisation in New Zealand, cis female sex
workers working on the street reported greater police presence contributing to their protection
as well as increased time for screening clients (Quotes 8 and 9) [36,94–96]. Sex workers across
sectors reported being able to negotiate services more directly and refuse clients [36]. Police
became more focused on sharing information with women about violent incidents or individ-
uals, and when their presence was off-putting to clients, women could request that they left
[96]. Sex workers working outdoors no longer needed to move to isolated areas [94], although
they continued to experience verbal and physical abuse by passers-by [95]. Although sex
worker organisations objected to mandatory condom use within this model, some sex workers
felt that it helped them insist on condom use [36].
In contexts of regulation in Australia, Mexico, and the US, venue-level systems such as
alarms, fixed prices, intercoms, and condom use [100,124], as well as being able to work in
close proximity with other sex workers and third parties [35,100,101,124], improved control
and sense of safety for those able to work in regulated venues. Yet, in the US, some women
criticised such systems as a veiled means of surveillance and as protecting management and
clients’ interests above their own safety [100]. Across these settings, those unable to conceal
venue-prohibited substance use were excluded from these premises and left as the authors
note with ‘no choice but to work on the streets’ [124] or in the minority of venues where man-
agement overlooked these regulations [35,100,101]. In Canada, the cost of business licenses
and the ineligibility of those with criminal records restricted access to and mobility between
regulated venues [93,121]. In Mexico, only well-networked, resident, HIV-negative, cis female
sex workers gained access to tolerance zones and regulated venues, which offered fewer physi-
cal risks than unregulated indoor and outdoor settings but were often overcrowded, making
income less stable [35,101]. In Australia, Guatemala, and Mexico, the ineligibility of minors to
work in regulated venues meant that they had to work on the street [35,124,126]. In Australia
and Sri Lanka, sex workers operating in unregulated venues had less control over negotiations
with clients, and some owners encouraged women to provide sex without a condom [124,120].
Core category 2: Institutionalised violence, coercion, and extortion, and restricted
access to justice.
Studies showed that policing practices in contexts of criminalisation and
regulation institutionalised violence against sex workers, both directly through police inflicting
physical or sexual violence or demanding fines in lieu of arrest, and indirectly by restricting
access to justice and thus creating an environment of impunity for perpetrators of violence
[97,102,122,125,127–130].
Violence and abuses of power by police were reported across all genders and diverse politi-
cal and economic contexts, including Cambodia, Canada, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, India, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Uganda, the US, and Zimbabwe [49,97,99,104,106,111,112,118,119,122,125,127,128]. This
took the form of arbitrary arrest and detention, verbal harassment, intimidation, humiliating
and derogatory treatment, extortion, forcible displacement, physical violence, gang rape, and

 other forms of sexual violence during raids and in police custody [49,97,99,103,104,106,111,
112,118,122,127,128]. In Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, Serbia, Sri Lanka, and the US, sex
workers experienced extortion (unofficial ‘fines’, payments, or bribes) or provided sexual ser-
vices enforced through physical or sexual violence or under threat of detention, arrest, transfer
to rehabilitation centres, or forced registration (Quotes 10 and 11) [49,101,103,110,119,
122,128–130], with limited or no opportunity to negotiate condom use [128]. Similar extortion
and/or arbitrary fines were reported in China, India, Thailand, and Turkey (Quote 12)
[99,107,110,125]. In Nepal, cis female sex workers, including those hired as peer educators,
reported being arrested, beaten, and robbed by police upon being found in possession of con-
doms [106].
Reporting violence could result in sex workers’ being further criminalised [49,97,120–
122,127,128]. Sex workers were reluctant to report violence and theft to the police [98,125] for
fear of the following: arrest for prostitution-related activities, unrelated petty offences, or non-
payment of previous fines [97,98,116,120,124,131]; being accused of crimes they had not com-
mitted [49,103]; harsh treatment or moral judgement [97,120]; further extortion or violence
[35,101,112]; disclosure in court [97]; prohibitive costs [112]; or because no action would be
taken to address the crime [97,111,112,114,116]. Long-standing discrimination, and the sense
that police viewed them as criminals, made sex workers doubt the police would take com-
plaints seriously [114,115,128]. When reports were submitted to police, sex workers’ accounts
were dismissed as implausible, with police simultaneously blaming sex workers for the vio-
lence they had experienced [49,120,125], discrediting them as victims (Quote 13) [97,103,
121,127,128], and sometimes further attacking or extorting them [49]. Cis and trans women in
Canada and the US reported police questioning whether it is possible for a sex worker to be
raped [97,128]. (Quote 14). Similarly, in Kenya, one cis woman reported being asked by an
officer ‘how a prostitute like me could be raped as I was used to all sizes’, discouraging her
from going to the police in future: ‘Never will I again go to report a case’ [127]. This produces
an environment of impunity, where further violence, extortion, and theft from police and oth-
ers operate unchecked [98,103,120,121,125,127], perceived to be a major contributor in nor-
malising violence against sex workers [26,125].
Reluctance to report violence occurred even in contexts where the purchase but not the sale
of sex was criminalised, due to fears that information about where sex work takes place could
be used to target clients and harass sex workers (Quote 15) [34,114]. While some cis and trans
women in Canada felt that police were now more concerned for their safety [26,114], others
felt that officers continued to view them as ‘trash’, blame them for the violence they experi-
enced, and deprioritise their safety [97], despite laws and police guidelines constructing them
as victims [26]. In contexts of regulation, registered sex workers in Guatemala viewed their
health cards (recording compliance with mandatory testing) as protective against police and
immigration harassment [126,132], and registered sex workers in Mexico had better access to
police protection but rarely reported violence [35]. In Senegal, registered workers still experi-
enced being disbelieved when reporting physical or economic violence to police and so were
reluctant to report it as a result (Quote 16) [105]. Concerns about being exposed to family and
friends were paramount [35,105] and deterred some from registering [126]. Relationships with
police were precarious, conditional on maintaining registered status, which can vary each
month depending on compliance with mandatory screening requirements—with those whose
registration has (temporarily) lapsed facing arrest, detention, and/or fines (Quote 17) [35,126].
Those who were not registered were afraid they would be sent to jail or fined for working ille-
gally, or for active drug use [35], and were more heavily targeted by police for fines, arrest,
detention, extortion, and sometimes sexual violence [35,101,124]. In India, marked reductions
in police raids and violence were achieved through a peer-based intervention that facilitated

 access to justice and challenged power relations between sex workers and police, although
some officers cited lengthy procedures to dissuade reporting [99]. In Canada, Mexico, Thai-
land, and the US, some sex workers described certain officers’ concern for their safety and sup-
port, but such concern was the exception [35,97,103,125].
Since decriminalisation in New Zealand, sex workers describe having better relationships
with the police, and greater access to justice which—despite some prevailing mistrust in police
—makes them feel safer and more confident with clients [36,95,96] and more deserving of
respect (Quote 18) [36]. The removal of threat of arrest—which reduced police power and
afforded sex workers rights—gave sex workers, and particularly young people [95], greater
confidence to report violent incidents, exploitation by managers, and disputes with clients
[36,96]. However, some officers treated disputes with clients as breaches of contract rather
than crimes [96]. While there were still some reports of abuses of police power, there were also
examples of offending officers being prosecuted as a result, helping to challenge environments
of impunity [36,94,96].
Core category 3: Reproduction of multiple stigmas and inequalities.
Findings show
that repressive police treatment reinforced inequalities and entrenched marginalisation of sex
workers, as well as creating disparities within sex-working communities, with police targeting
specific settings or populations. In the context of full criminalisation in Sri Lanka, sex workers
reported experiencing harsher punishment than their clients or managers: both sex workers
and clients might be fined, but clients were not arrested or charged in the way that sex workers
were [49], nor were managers of flats arrested during police raids [120]. Across settings,
arrests, fines, extortion, and theft by police particularly targeted street-based sex workers
[101,103,120,128], resulting in loss of income and increased economic vulnerabilities (Quote
19) [49,99,103,118,125,127,129,130]. Findings from Canada, Sri Lanka, and the US also show
how criminalisation and police enforcement restricted freedom of movement, as sex workers
were targeted arbitrarily by police during and outside of sex work hours and environments
[49,97,103,120,128], and outed as sex workers by officers [97].
Studies showed how police targeting and mistreatment of sex workers, and inaccessibility
to justice, reproduced inequalities and discrimination against sexual and gender minorities
[26,49,116,119,127,129,130], people who use drugs [22,103,128,133], women, people of colour,
and migrants [26,34,97,98,128,129,132]. In Serbia, Roma trans sex workers were treated with
‘contempt’ both by police enacting ‘extreme violence’ against them and by clients who
expected cis women (Quote 20) [129]. In sub-Saharan Africa, male and trans sex workers
described the ‘double stigma’ they faced, which could result in humiliation, ostracisation, evic-
tion, and lack of access to micro-finance schemes, and this was worse in settings where homo-
sexuality is also criminalised (Quote 21) [127]. In Sri Lanka, where both sex work and
homosexuality are criminalised, trans sex workers were less likely to be charged than cis
women but they experienced extensive extortion, humiliation, false accusations of crime, and
verbal, physical, and sexual violence by officers targeting their gender expression (Quote 22)
[49,120]. Similar experiences were reported among feminine-presenting male and trans sex
workers in Pakistan and among trans women and sex workers of colour in Canada and the US
[26,119,128]. In Canada, trans sex workers attributed officers’ lack of response to their reports
of violence to the stigma and discrimination surrounding their gender, sex work, and drug
use, reinforcing their self-blame [116].
Long-standing racial discrimination and community mistrust reinforced black and indige-
nous sex workers’ doubts that the police would take their complaints of violence seriously
[26,128], and drug use was used to undermine sex workers’ testimony against their attackers
(Quote 23) [128]. In the US, one woman described what police said to an ex-boyfriend who
had beaten her up: ‘You can’t go hitting her, even though I’d hit her for being a junkie’ [128].

 In Canada, a cis female independent sex worker described a police officer calling her ‘just a
fat. . .native whore’ [97], while some white male independent sex workers attributed their lack
of police attention to their race and social and economic privilege [102].
In criminalised and regulated settings, the precarious legal status of undocumented or
unregistered migrant sex workers was used by clients [127] and venue owners [132] to refuse
payment, and by landlords to charge inflated rents for substandard rooms [107]. Migrant sex
workers did not report violence and other crimes to the police due to fear of deportation
[35,131,132] or language barriers [98]. In Guatemala, police officers sometimes rounded up
migrant sex workers whether or not they were registered [126], and in Turkey, police targeted
‘foreign-looking’ women presumed to be migrant sex workers [107]. In Sweden, immigration
legislation and anti-trafficking policies have been used to deport migrant sex workers, despite
their characterisation in national prostitution law as victims of violence, as a way of reducing
sex work [34].
Core category 4: Restricted access to health and social care and support. Research dem-
onstrates how criminalisation and police enforcement restrict sex workers’ access to health
and social care. In Cambodia and various sub-Saharan African countries, crackdowns on
brothels have reduced access to health services by disrupting peer networks and displacing sex
workers from usual places of work, making it difficult for outreach services to find people, and
hindering collective organisation (Quote 24) [118,127]. In China, sex workers were reluctant
to accept condoms from health services after police crackdowns, for fear of their use as evi-
dence [110]. In Sweden, the mandate to reduce sex work acted as a barrier to services, as sex
workers’ access became conditional on leaving the sex trade and conforming to a victim dis-
course, and health services no longer distributed condoms through outreach [34]. Based on
ethnographic observations, authors noted multiple difficulties experienced by sex workers as a
result of laws against renting property used for sex work, including problems with eviction as
well as with immigration, child custody, and tax authorities [34]. In Canada, some sex workers
had received referrals from supportive police to health, counselling, and legal aid services [97],
but indoor venue managers remained reluctant to allow outreach visits for fear of prosecution,
restricting access to sexual and broader healthcare—particularly disadvantaging migrant sex
workers who relied on outreach [93]. Trans sex workers in Canada [116] and sex workers of all
genders in South Australia [98] were fearful of accessing clinics [116], sex-worker-led outreach
services, and peer information and resources [98], for fear of being reported to the police.
Studies showed how registration and mandatory testing necessitated more frequent contact
with healthcare systems [100,108,115,132] and were viewed positively by authors in Nevada,
US, as a way of maintaining a low level of STIs [100] and by some sex workers as a form of
self-responsibility for health [108,126]. However, in Guatemala the decision to comply with
testing requirements was mostly motivated by fear of police harassment and detention rather
than health considerations [126,132]. In Turkey, unregistered migrant sex workers were forc-
ibly tested upon arrest [107], and in Australia, some sex workers experienced judgement and
were refused testing by health professionals [108]. Mandatory testing of sex workers is consid-
ered a rights violation by the UN Refugee Agency and the Joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS that can create barriers to sex workers accessing voluntary services and can
facilitate discrimination against sex workers living with HIV. In Nevada, sex workers who test
HIV positive can face up to 10 years in prison if they are found selling sex in a licensed or an
unlicensed environment [100]. Discrimination against sex workers in general was often rein-
forced, and mandatory registration was not only time-consuming but could lead to public dis-
closure of sex work, adversely affecting individuals’ credit rating and ability to obtain a loan
(Quotes 25–28) [108,115,127]. Regulation systems also restricted migrants’ access to sexual
health services [35], and those with undocumented status in Turkey lacked broader access to

 healthcare and banking services, leaving them vulnerable to theft [107]. In Canada, sex work-
ers’ fear of becoming known to the authorities left them dependent on cash and unable to
access loans [107,121].
Box 1. Quotes
Core category 1: Disrupted work spaces and safety strategies
Quote 1: ‘They couldn’t have designed a law better to make it less safe, even if they sat
for years! It’s like you have to hide out, you can’t talk to a guy, and there’s no discussion
about what you’re willing to do and for how much. The negotiation has to take place
afterwards, which is always so much scarier. And you’re in a parking lot somewhere with
some dude and all of a sudden he decides he doesn’t want to pay that, or pay anything at
all and what are you going to do about it? So, yeah, it’s designed to set it up to be danger-
ous. I don’t think it was the original intention, but that’s what it does.’—cis woman, sec-
tor and age unspecified, Canada [121]
Quote 2: ‘Twenty seconds, one minute, two minutes, you have to decide if you should go
into this person’s car. . .now I guess if I’m standing there, and the guy, he will be really
scared to pick me up, and he will wave with his hand “Come here, we can go here round
the corner, and make up the arrangement”, and that would be much more dangerous.’—
cis woman, internet escort/street, age unspecified, Canada [34]
Quote 3: ‘While they’re going around chasing johns away from pulling up beside you, I
have to stay out for longer.. . .Whereas if we weren’t harassed we would be able to be
more choosy as to where we get in, who we get in with you know what I mean? Because
of being so cold and being harassed I got into a car where I normally wouldn’t have. The
guy didn’t look at my face right away. And I just hopped in cause I was cold and tired of
standing out there. And you know, he put something to my throat. And I had to do it for
nothing. Whereas I woulda made sure he looked at me, if I hadn’t been waiting out there
so long.’—cis woman, street, age unspecified, Canada [114]
Quote 4a: ‘Sometimes the guy will drive up and just sort of wave or point to go down the
alley or something like that somewhere else where he can pick me up. [How does that
affect your safety?] You never know who it is, right? And you can’t really see his face,
can’t really see anything they could have a gun in their hand or. You know what I mean
they could be a little drunk or something if you can’t really see them very clearly, you
know. And you don’t you can’t say hi or whatever before you get in. You have to just
hurry up before the cops come.’—cis woman, street, age unspecified, Canada [114]
Quote 4b: ‘Clients are worried about police. To avoid police they wanna move to a different
area. I don’t want to go out of my zone right.. ..Once you get out there, like you know their
turf so it’s harder for me cause it’s their comfort zone so they act differently, you know what
I mean. Yeah it never ends up good’—cis woman, street, age unspecified, Canada [114]
Quote 5: ‘The ideal situation is where you. . .have a separate premises where you can
work from, and share those premises. . .Because then you’ve got companionship, added
security, there’s someone to interact with. Because of the legal situation you have to be
very, very careful. Because obviously it’s running a brothel, which has. . .really dangerous
consequences these days.’—cis man, independent, age unspecified, UK [123]

 Quote 6a: ‘In the past, we just stay in the brothel and no one dared to hurt us or beat us
because we are there in the brothel. But now [since police crackdowns] we cannot know
where they take us to. Such as taking us to Prek Ho [a village 15 km from Phnom Penh]
and hurt us. We don’t know in advance. There is no one to control us. So it is not safe
for us.’—cis woman, formerly brothel-based, age 26 years, Cambodia [118]
Quote 6b: ‘Now some clients may force us not to use condoms but when we lived in the
brothel we had more rights than clients and they dared not to force us because they come
into our house.’—cis woman, formerly brothel-based, age 22 years, Cambodia [118]
Quote 7: ‘One of the staff caught one [a violent client]. He was a visitor in the house, and
he came in as a date, and they called the police, and he got arrested.’—cis woman,
indoor, age unspecified, Canada [113]
Quote 8: ‘And the police weren’t around as much (before decriminalization). But when
it got legalised the police were everywhere. We always have police coming up and down
the street every night, and we’d even have them coming over to make sure that we were
all right and making sure our minders, that we’ve got minders and that they were taking
registration plates and the identity of the clients. So it was, it changed the whole street,
it’s changed everything.’—cis woman, street, age unspecified, New Zealand [36]
Quote 9: ‘You stand outside the car and talk. Don’t get in the car and talk—it’s best to
just get them to wind the window down, stand there, talk to them and judge them.
Yeah.’—cis woman, street, age unspecified, New Zealand [94]
Core category 2: Institutionalised violence, coercion, and extortion, and
restricted access to justice
Quote 10: ‘There was this time when I was arrested by six policemen. They afterwards
demanded sex from me. One of them threatened to stab me if I refused. I ended up hav-
ing sex with all of them and the experience was so painful.’—cis man, sector unspecified,
age 26 years, Kenya [127]
Quote 11: ‘It’s really pathetic taking money from us. I don’t know how they don’t under-
stand I struggled for that. I sold my body. I worked. The man, for instance, pardon me,
fucked me and everything, for the money. And they take the money. Why? I don’t know,
but so they say it goes into some fund, what do I know?’—cis woman, street, age not
specified, Serbia [129]
Quote 12: ‘Does the law limit how much they [police] charge [when fining sex workers]?
Today, 500, tomorrow 300. Why the law does not limit. . .the charges for this amount?
For gambling, 1000 charged, prostitution 500, isn’t there a limit? We don’t understand. I
feel like the charges just depend on their [police] mood.’—cis woman, focus group, sec-
tor and age not specified, Thailand [125]
Quote 13: [In a case where a participant reported being attacked by a client and the case
going to court.] ‘He ended up getting off even though I had photos of the bruises. This is
likely related to the institutional attitude that women who sell sex deserve what they get
from taking on a dangerous occupation—it’s such bullshit but so common! Also, I feared
prosecution myself as a prostitute so I was unable to be completely truthful in court and
my abuser was let off—even with the evidence’—cis woman, independent off street, age

be a sex worker. And it affects my work, I think. . .when I’m in a room with a client. . .I
feel like I am deserving of more respect because I’m not doing something that’s illegal.
So I guess it gives me a lot more confidence with a client because, you know, I’m doing
something that’s legal, and there’s no way that they can, you know, dispute that. And
you know, I feel like if I’m in a room with a client, then it’s safer, because, you know,

 Discussion
We estimate that, collectively, lawful or unlawful repressive policing practices linked to sex
work criminalisation (partial or full) are associated with increased risk of infection with HIV
or STIs, sexual or physical violence from clients or intimate partners, and condomless sex. The
qualitative synthesis clearly shows pathways through which these policing practices and health
risks are associated: enacted or feared police enforcement—targeting sex workers, clients, or
third parties organising sex work—displaces sex workers into isolated and dangerous work
locations and disrupts risk reduction strategies, such as screening and negotiating with clients,
carrying condoms, and working with others. Specific policing practices, including confiscation
of condoms or needles/syringes, are associated with increased odds of HIV, STIs, and violence

Quote 23: ‘Because it wasn’t a trial of rape, it was a trial of me being a heroin addict, me
being on methadone. It got thrown out of court. . ..’—cis woman, street, age unspecified,
Canada [22]
Core category 4: Restricted access to health and social care and support
Quote 24: ‘Since the new law was passed, fewer women access health care and prevention
services because we live at different places nowadays and NGOs could not find us. In the
past, women live in one place at the brothel. We also want to contact NGOs but we don’t
know the location of the NGOs. . .So we could not access to prevention services. . .Since
the brothel was closed I have never contacted it again.’—cis woman, brothel, age 22
years, Cambodia [118]
Quote 25: ‘Because the policemen crack down often we cannot earn money. We are
sleepless, so we sleep at day time, so I am lazy to go to check my health. I have no feeling
to go.’—cis woman, brothel, age 22 years, Cambodia [118]
Quote 26: ‘I think every month is stupid. It has to be every three months at least. Because
it’s a pain for owners, it’s a pain for girls, for everyone, because like you can’t go to your
family doctor and say, “Listen I need a certificate”. You have to go to a sexual health
clinic and wait all day to see a doctor.’—cis woman, brothel and escort, age unspecified,
Australia [108]
Quote 27: ‘[For] any insurance one of the questions is, “Have you been a prostitute?”
Whatever, now if they pulled your health records and they saw how many tests you’d
had, you can’t lie about that one and I think it should be totally illegal [insurance compa-
nies asking about sex work]. And I would like to see them do a bit of a study on girls in
the sex industry who have worked, that aren’t on drugs and how many diseases they
actually have, to see if this kind of discrimination is warranted, because it’s not.’—cis
woman, sector and age unspecified, US [108]
Quote 28: ‘I worked in a legal prostitution setting in Nevada. I did that for a couple of
weeks to see what it was like. The amount of controls and the lack of freedom was hor-
rendous. You know, I don’t want someone else telling me how to work. And I don’t
think it is necessary really. Yeah, I think decriminalization gives us the most freedom.’—

 by a range of actors. Repressive police practices frequently constitute basic violations of
human rights, including unlawful arrest and detention, extortion, physical and sexual violence
by law enforcement, lack of recourse to justice, and forced HIV testing—violations inextricably
linked to increased unprotected sex, transmission of HIV and STIs, increased violence from all
actors, and poorer access to health services [3,29,134]. The qualitative synthesis shows how
violence and stigma against sex workers are institutionalised, legitimised, and rendered invisi-
ble [26,35] in contexts of any criminalisation and regulation [26,35], as sex workers across set-
tings consistently report being further criminalised, blamed, or ignored when they report
crimes against them. This structural, symbolic, and everyday violence fosters climates of impu-
nity and under-reporting, and failure to recognise sex workers as citizens deserving protection,
care, and support [26]. Targeting and exclusion of the most marginalised sex workers rein-
forces and obscures the injustices they face.
Our findings build on previous reviews documenting the extent to which and how social
and structural factors influence sex workers’ safety and vulnerability to HIV. They do so by
showing how these factors interplay with criminalisation to further marginalise sex workers
and deprive them of civil, labour, and social rights [134–137]. Fear of prosecution and moral
judgement, due to laws against homosexuality and transgenderism [138] and drug use [135],
and, in the case of migrant workers [139], fear of deportation, further reduce willingness to
report violence and exploitation to the police. Other evidence has shown how evictions based
on landlords’ fears of brothel-keeping charges increase vulnerability to homelessness for sex
workers and their families, while arrest and criminal records or simply being identified as a
sex worker can lead to sex workers’ children being placed in institutional care [135,140].
Despite including search terms relating to broader health outcomes, the majority of epide-
miological literature focused on sexual health outcomes and, in more recent evidence, vio-
lence. We found few studies that focused on emotional health, but these show detrimental
associations with repressive policing and criminalisation. Qualitative and quantitative studies
demonstrate that police enforcement and its threat is a major source of anxiety [103,141],
whereas working in indoor, decriminalised environments is associated with improved mental
health outcomes [32,142]. A recent critical literature review demonstrates that criminalisation,
stigma, poor working conditions, isolation from peer and social networks, and financial inse-
curity have negative repercussions for sex workers’ mental health [13]. Only 1 quantitative
study reported on the associations between policing and violence from intimate or other part-
ners, and further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this relationship [58]. It
is clear that criminalisation and stigma interact to reproduce sex workers’ exposure to physical
and sexual violence, and limit possibilities to resist or challenge it, and interventions are
urgently needed to address violence against sex workers from all perpetrators. Successful sex-
worker-led approaches to improving access to justice and challenging institutional stigma in
South India offer important examples of what can be achieved with sustained funding and sup-
port [99].
Findings clearly show that criminally enforced regulatory models create major disparities
within sex worker communities, possibly enabling access to safer conditions for some but
excluding the large majority who remain under a system of criminalisation, including trans
women, cis men, people who use drugs, migrant populations, and often sex workers operating
in outdoor environments, who are at increased risk of HIV in many settings [81,90,126]. In
contexts of mandatory HIV testing following arrest, fear of enforcement can hinder voluntary
uptake of HIV testing and interventions [71,80], showing how this punitive approach to public
health ultimately reduces access to health services. More recent research from Senegal has
shown that while registration was associated with better physical health, the stigma attached to
being registered has a detrimental effect on well-being; only a minority of sex workers are

 registered, and those who test HIV positive are excluded [143]. As the qualitative synthesis
demonstrates, in New Zealand, following decriminalisation, sex workers reported being better
able to refuse clients and insist on condom use, amid improved relationships with police and
managers [36,144,145]. Other research in this setting indicates that decriminalisation has the
potential not only to reduce discrimination, denials of justice, denigration, and verbal abuse
but also to improve sex workers’ emotional well-being [31]. This concords with existing
modelling data that suggest a positive effect of decriminalisation on incidence of HIV [2].
We were unable to examine the effects of different legislative models in the quantitative
synthesis due to limited data, particularly for the models of decriminalisation and the crimina-
lisation of the purchase of sex. Evidence included in our qualitative synthesis clearly shows
that criminalisation of clients does not facilitate access to services, nor minimise violence. This
is supported by the epidemiological evidence from Vancouver that showed that sex workers
who were stopped, searched, or arrested were at increased risk of client violence despite the
introduction of more severe laws against the purchase of sex introduced in 2014 (alongside
fewer sanctions for sex workers working together and modelled on the Swedish law) [57]. In
addition, the practice of rushing negotiations due to police presence increased and was associ-
ated with increased client-perpetrated violence [92]. Findings from our qualitative synthesis
suggest that enforcement strategies that seek to reduce the numbers of sex workers [118] or cli-
ents [114] are unlikely to achieve these effects, since the economic needs of sex workers remain
unchanged, resulting in sex workers having to work longer hours, accept greater risks, and
deprioritise health. There is no reliable evidence from Sweden that the numbers of sex workers
have decreased since the law changed in 1999 [34].
Limitations
There are a number of limitations to this review. Findings from our pooled meta-analyses
examining condom use and violence were limited by high heterogeneity, although effect esti-
mates remained consistent across sensitivity analyses, suggesting we can be confident in their
robustness. By limiting the search to literature written in English, Russian, and Spanish, we may
have missed key studies. There was a lack of comparable quantitative data on outcomes such as
access to services, drug-related harms, and emotional ill health, which precluded the use of
meta-analysis. Similarly, few qualitative studies explored the emotional health effects of crimina-
lisation and enforcement, and its effects on access to health and broader services received less
attention relative to safety and health risks, within the rich body of evidence reviewed. Method-
ologically, some studies did not provide sufficient detail on sampling and analysis methods, and
few included reflexive discussions on the position of the researcher. Although a growing num-
ber involve sex workers as researchers or advisors, few included discussion of the challenges
and benefits of participatory approaches. We found few eligible studies that included trans
female or cis male sex workers, who experience particular inequalities in relation to HIV, access
to services, and—as the qualitative synthesis shows—police targeting and violence, limiting our
ability to generalise findings to these populations. It is also possible that some studies may not
have differentiated between trans women and cis men [146], or between cis and trans partici-
pants within samples of female and male sex workers, and few disaggregated experiences or out-
comes by gender. This is an important area of future research given the specific vulnerabilities
experienced by these populations, in contexts where gender and sexual minorities are crimina-
lised, inadequately protected against hate crimes, and, in the case of trans people, not legally rec-
ognised. There is particular need for research with trans women, who experience intense
violence, discrimination, and exclusion from education and employment, and whose health
needs have been obscured by their conflation with ‘men who have sex with men’ [146].

 Our review focuses on the implementation of enforcement practices linked to 5 broad legis-
lative models. While it is clear that sex work laws and enforcement practices are inextricably
integrated and it is key to link practice to legal frameworks to inform policy-making and advo-
cacy, our findings reinforce previous evidence [37,38] that shows wide variation in how laws
are enforced, which vary with sex work setting [126], visibility of sex work, sex workers’ and
managers’ relationships with individual officers [99,101], and political and media attention
[110,125], or arbitrarily by city [121]. We report on recent and past history of arrest or prison
based on the information available to us, but few studies reported whether the arrest was
related to sex work, was related to another offence, or had to do with social, gender, or racial
profiling. Assessing the extent to which the enforcement practice was lawful or unlawful is
beyond the scope of this review, but in some cases unlawful activities are clearly evidenced
(e.g., police violence) while in others they are less visible or evidenced. This limits our ability to
assess the specific contribution of sex work penalties to the health and safety of sex workers,
relative to the use of other penalties and abuses of police powers against sex workers in con-
texts of criminalisation. Lack of clarity on the lawfulness of police enforcement practices also
reflects the difficulties in measuring stigma and its interaction with criminalisation, and the
need for mixed-methods approaches to unpack these complexities in context. We found few
data on the interplay between criminalisation, collective organisation, and health outcomes.
Evidence from India has shown how tackling social injustice and mistreatment by the police as
part of a sex-worker-led HIV prevention intervention has resulted in fewer arrests, more
explanation of reasons for arrest, and fairer treatment by the police, as well as decreased
violence against sex workers [84,99]. However, most evaluations of community-led health
interventions have been limited to HIV prevention and have been implemented in India,
Dominican Republic, and Brazil [147,148]. Although there are numerous examples of active
sex worker organisations advocating for sex worker rights and evidence-based policy interna-
tionally, as well as developing guidelines for rights-based HIV programming with, for, and by
sex workers [149], the voices of sex workers continue to be dismissed and silenced in policy
debates in many settings as well as in the design and evaluation of public health interventions.
Conclusion
The public health evidence clearly shows the harms associated with all forms of sex work crimi-
nalisation, including regulatory systems, which effectively leave the most marginalised, and typi-
cally the majority of, sex workers outside of the law. These legislative models deprioritise sex
workers’ safety, health, and rights and hinder access to due process of law. The evidence available
suggests that decriminalisation can improve relationships between sex workers and the police,
increasing ability to report incidences of violence and facilitate access to services [36,95,96]. Con-
sidering these findings within a human rights framework, they highlight the urgency of reform-
ing policies and laws shown to increase health harms and act as barriers to the realisation of
health, removing laws and enforcement against sex workers and clients, and building in health
and safety protections [134]. It is clear that while legislative change is key, it is not enough on its
own. Law reform needs to be accompanied by policies and political commitment to reducing
structural inequalities, stigma, and exclusion—including introducing anti-discrimination and
hate crime laws that protect sex workers and sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic minorities.
Mixed-methods, interdisciplinary, and participatory research is needed to document the con-
text-specific ways in which criminalisation or decriminalisation interacts with other structural
factors and policies related to stigma, poverty, migration, housing, and sex worker collective
organising, to inform locally relevant interventions alongside legal reform. This research must
go alongside efforts to examine concerns surrounding decriminalisation of sex work within

 institutions and communities, which influence policy and practice, and sex workers must be
involved in decision-making over any such research and reforms [121,150]. Opponents of decri-
minalisation of sex work often voice concerns that decriminalisation normalises violence and
gender inequalities, but what is clear from our review is that criminalisation does just this by
restricting sex workers’ access to justice and reinforcing the marginalisation of already-margina-
lised women and sexual and gender minorities. The recognition of sex work as an occupation is
an important step towards conferring social, labour, and civil rights on all sex workers, and this
must be accompanied by concerted efforts to challenge and redress cultures of discrimination
and violence against people who sell sex. While such reforms and related institutional shifts are
likely to be achieved only in the long term, immediate interventions are needed to support sex
workers, including the funding and scale-up of specialist and sex-worker-led services that can
address the multiple and linked health and social care needs that sex workers may face.
