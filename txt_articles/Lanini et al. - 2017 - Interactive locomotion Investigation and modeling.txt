Abstract
In spite of extensive studies on human walking, less research has been conducted on
human walking gait adaptation during interaction with another human. In this paper, we
study a particular case of interactive locomotion where two humans carry a rigid object
together. Experimental data from two persons walking together, one in front of the other,
while carrying a stretcher-like object is presented, and the adaptation of their walking gaits
and coordination of the foot-fall patterns are analyzed. It is observed that in more than 70%
of the experiments the subjects synchronize their walking gaits; it is shown that these walk-
ing gaits can be associated to quadrupedal gaits. Moreover, in order to understand the
extent by which the passive dynamics can explain this synchronization behaviour, a simple
2D model, made of two-coupled spring-loaded inverted pendulums, is developed, and a
comparison between the experiments and simulations with this model is presented, showing
that with this simple model we are able to reproduce some aspects of human walking behav-
iour when paired with another human.
1 Introduction
Extensive studies have investigated the effect of sensory feedback on human walking gait. Zivo-
tofsky et al. [1, 2] have studied different types of sensory feedback, including tactile (e.g., hold-
ing hands) and have shown that different types of sensory feedback, such as visual, acoustic,
and tactile cause synchronous walking; the tactile feedback was found to be the most effective
in causing synchronization. Also, in [3] the interpersonal synchronization between pairs of
subjects walking side-by-side (without holding hands) on a treadmill was shown to have spells
of attraction to certain phase relations, but no strict phase locking was found, implying that
the interlimb coupling without haptic feedback is weaker.
Moreover, biomechanical properties of partners, such as leg length, influence the strength
of synchronization during unintentional gait entrainment. Nessler et al. [4] found that among
all the pairs walking side-by-side on two treadmills under different sensory feedback condi-
tions, those ones who exhibited unilateral step frequency locking (a.k.a. entrainment) had

 significantly lower leg length differences between the partners. Moreover, a significant correla-
tion was found between leg length difference and both difference in stepping frequency and
frequency locking.
Even though, as presented in some of the work above, side-by-side walking has been well
analyzed by considering different sensory feedbacks and anthropometric parameters, to the
best of our knowledge the effect of the haptic interaction through an object between two peo-
ple, one walking in front of the other, on their walking gaits has not been investigated yet.
In this paper, we will present a particular case of interpersonal coordination that occurs
when two persons walk while physically paired by carrying an object together (see Fig 1). This
configuration may be associated to quadrupedal locomotion.
The aim of this work is to investigate the implication of the coupling on the walking gaits of
each human subject and understand the mechanism of gait synchronization by studying a sim-
ple model consisting of two bipedal agents connected with a spring-damper. Through such a
study the following questions will be investigated:
• Do humans alter their gaits when they are physically paired with another human through an
object while one is walking in front of the other?
• Do humans temporally coordinate their gaits when they are physically paired? If yes, do they
exhibit typical “quadrupedal” gaits, and if so, which ones?
• To what extent the coordination is caused by the passive mechanical connection of the two
bipedal systems?
• Is it possible to replicate the experimental data with a paired Spring Loaded Inverted Pendu-
lums (SLIPs) model?
Fig 1. Paired trial. Two subjects were asked to walk while mechanically paired through a stretcher-like
object. Each subject was equipped by 34 reflective markers that were used in combination with a motion
capture system (VICON) to track the kinematic movements. A computer, placed on the center of the
stretcher-like object, was used to record the force data from four 3D force sensors integrated in each handle.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the results of human experiments
will be presented: Center of Mass (CoM) displacement, CoM velocity, Gait Cycle Time (GCT),
and step length in unconstrained walking and mechanically paired walking with another sub-
ject will be compared, and gait foot-fall patterns of the two paired bipeds will be analyzed. In
Section 3 a simple model of mechanically paired bipeds will be presented. The systematic
parameter search for finding periodic orbits of this mechanical model will be described in Sec-
tion 4. Finally, in Section 5 a comparison between the experimental data and simulation results
will be presented.
2 Human-human interactive locomotion: Experiments
In this section, we present and analyze the kinematic data collected in the paired-walking
experiments, where two subjects carry a stretcher-like object together (see Fig 1).
2.1 Methods
The experiments were conducted at gait laboratory of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire
Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland, according to the principles expressed in the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. Participants provided their written consent on the experiment protocol
approved by the EPFL human research ethics committee (HREC No 004-2015) (see S1 Ethic
Statement). Six healthy subjects with a mean age of 27 participated in the experiments. More
details about the subjects’ anthropometrics data can be found in Table 1.
As Table 2 shows, the same subjects were used to compose different pairs and perform dif-
ferent roles (i.e., walking in front (A) or behind (B) the object).
Each experiment consisted of two trials:

 • Solo trial
• Paired trial In the first case, the subjects were asked to walk for 12 m two times, back and
forth. Each of these sequences will be indicated as a ‘Trial’; as a result, for each pair of sub-
jects we will have 4 trials. In the second case, the same subjects were asked to walk two times
while paired by a stretcher like object with a total weight of 8 kg and a length of 150 cm.
The average number of steps for a subject changes depending on the type of trial: on aver-
age, a solo trial consists of 8.8 ± 1.06 number of steps per subject per trial, while the average
number of steps in a paired trial is 8.12 ± 0.49.
Overall, 7 pairs, made by a combination of 6 different subjects, performed the trials. A
motion capture system (VICON) was used to track the kinematic movements of each subject
with 34 markers placed on the subject’s body according to the Plug-In-Gait convention [5].
For the off-line data processing we used two commercial software packages: the Vicon Nexus
software and MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc.). Nexus software was used to label markers,
detect gaps in the data and filter them through a low-pass digital Butterworth filter that filters
out signal noise above 300 Hz. Finally, MATLAB scripts were used to compute all the gait
parameters of interest, described below:
Subjects’ CoM trajectories.
Anthropometric tables [6] are used to compute the CoM
position over time for each subject. In this way we can analyze the motion of the CoM along
the vertical direction for each subject in each pair and such a motion is compared between the
solo and paired trials.
Subjects’ GCT. GCT is defined as the time interval between the same walking event, such
as two consecutive contact events of the same foot (e.g., right or left) on the ground. Finding
the local minima of the heel trajectory, we estimate the times at which the heel strike happens,
and thus, we can compute the time difference between two consecutive heel strikes of the same
foot. For each subject the mean GCT and the standard deviation are computed for all the solo
and paired trials, and GCT variation among solo trials, paired trials in position A (front) and
paired trials in position B (back) is investigated.
Subjects’ step length.
Step length is defined as the distance between the heel position of
one foot and that of the other foot at the heel strike moment. For each subject the mean step
length is extracted from all the solo and paired trials. Subjects’ step length variation among
solo trials, paired trials in position A (front) and paired trials in position B (back) is
investigated.
Subjects’ CoM velocity.
By differentiating the CoM trajectory with respect to time, we
obtain the CoM forward velocity for each subject. For all subjects CoM forward velocity varia-
tion among solo trials, paired trials in position A (front) and paired trials in position B (back)
is investigated. Neither vertical nor lateral velocity has been analyzed.
Gait synchronization.
A pair is considered to have a synchronized gait when
• The subjects have the same stride durations,
• The phase lag between the two subjects is constant.
We assume that the first condition (i.e., same stride duration) is satisfied when the absolute
difference between stride durations of the two subjects within a pair is less then 4% of their
mean stride duration. Such a threshold was chosen to be comparable with the coefficient of
variation of a healthy subject during a 9-min walk, as presented in [7]. Regarding the second
condition for synchronization, in order to find the phase lag between the subjects, for each
trial the heel trajectories are first cut into n time windows, where n is the number of strides.
Then, the cross-correlation between the heel trajectory x(t) of Subject A and y(t) of Subject B

 in each time window (of length N) is computed according to the following formula:

:
Once the maximum cross-correlation is found, the corresponding lag scaled to [0˚, 360˚] is
denoted as the phase lag, ϕ. Intuitively, ϕ determines the shift between the two heel trajectories
that maximizes the correlation between the signals. The phase lag is considered to be constant
as long as its variation is within a tolerance of ±10˚.
Interlimb coordination.
Six markers are placed on the stretcher-like object in order to
analyze its position over time. Moreover, in order to have a measure of the upper limb motion,
we compute the relative displacement between the CoM of the stretcher-like object and the
CoM of each subject in the forward direction. Finally, we try to find a correlation between this
relative displacement and the step duration.
Repeated measures ANOVA is performed for each of the three dependent variables (GCT,
step length, and forward velocity) with three different conditions (solo trial, paired trial in
position A (front), and paired trial in position B (back)). A post-hoc multiple comparison
(Tukey’s HSD test with alpha = 0.05) is then applied to all the significant results.
Moreover, a statistical shape analysis (Procrustes analysis [8–10]) is performed in order to
compare the mean CoM trajectories in the vertical direction of the paired trials and those of
the solo trials. Procrustes analysis is based on the evaluation of the difference between the
shape of two curves (in our case, the CoM trajectory of the solo trial in the vertical direction
and that of the paired trial, normalized to percent gait cycle and interpolated at 1000 points).
After computing the sum of the squared distances (SSD) between the corresponding points of
the two curves, the square root of such SSD can be used as a statistical measure of the differ-
ence in shape, called Dissimilarity Measure (DM) (Eq (1)),

Finally, Pearson correlation coefficient between arms’ oscillations period and step period is
calculated in order to analyze the interlimb coordination.
2.2 Main results
In this subsection we will present the main results that were obtained from the experiments
using the methodologies explained in Subsection 2.1.
2.2.1 Subjects’ CoM trajectories.
Fig 2 shows Procrustes analysis results for the mean
CoM trajectories in the vertical direction of the solo and paired trials for each pair. According
to the DM value (see Eq (1)), we define the ‘closest match’ result as the one for which the DM
is lowest and the ‘furthest match’ result as the one with the highest DM value. The furthest
match results between the CoM vertical displacement of the solo trial and paired trial are
reported in Fig 2, on the right.

 As shown in Fig 2, the vertical CoM displacement of each subject is not affected by the
mechanical coupling (at least for the 8 kg object used for the experiments).
2.2.2 Subjects’ GCT.
On the top-left of Fig 3 it is shown that there is a significant ten-
dency (p = 0.02) for each subject to increase the GCT when paired compared to the solo case;
this increase on average is 0.12 s. Moreover, once paired, there is a statistically negligible differ-
ence of GCT when the subject is in position A (e.g., in front of the stretcher like object) or in
position B (e.g., behind the stretcher like object). These results are summarized in Table 3,
which reports Tukey HSD test results. Moreover, on the top-right of Fig 3, the overall GCT’s
mean and standard deviation for each subject within a pair during the solo and paired trials
are presented. From the previous plot it is also possible to notice that during the paired trials,
subjects within a pair have almost the same GCT; in particular, on average, the GCT difference
between subjects A and subjects B is 0.024 ± 0.068 s, which is less than 2% of the average GCT
in all trials.
2.2.3 Subjects’ step length.
In the middle-left of Fig 3 it is shown that, compared to the
solo case, once paired, the step length decreases by 7.62 cm on average (p = 0.0174). Moreover,
the difference between step lengths of each subject in position A (front) and position B (back)
are statistically negligible. These results are summarized in Table 3, which reports Tukey HSD
test results. An overall evaluation of the step length mean and standard deviation during the
solo and paired trials is also reported on the middle-right of Fig 3. The latter plot can be used
to evaluate how the step lengths of subjects within a pair converge to similar values; on average,
the step length difference between subjects A and subjects B is 0.023 ± 0.035 m which is 4% of
the average step length in all trials.

obtained from a comparison between the mean CoM trajectories of solo trial and paired trial for each subject in the vertical direction is presented. For each
pair, the yellow bar refers to the CoM trajectory of Subject A while the black bar is associated to Subject B. On the right, one example for the ‘furthest match’
result (Pair05) is shown.

 2.2.4 Subjects’ CoM velocity. The previous results in terms of the increase in the GCT
and reduction of the stride length, when paired, were also supported by the CoM velocity
analysis.
From the bottom-left of Fig 3, we notice a statistically significant (p = 0.0149) reduction
(by 0.24 m/s on average) in the forward walking speed as a consequence of the coupling. Also

variables (GCT on top, step length in the middle and forward velocity on bottom) with three conditions: solo trial (blue bars), paired trial when the subject is in
front (violet bars) or back (pink bars) with respect to the stretcher-like object. On the right, for each dependent variable, the mean values and standard
deviations over all the solo (blue bars) and paired (pink and violet bars) trials for each subject within a pair are shown.

 in this case subjects have statistically negligible different velocities when they are in position A
(front) or position B (back).These results are summarized in Table 3, which reports Tukey
HSD test results. Moreover, for each subject within a pair, the overall mean and standard devi-
ation of the forward velocity are shown, both for solo and paired trials (see Fig 3, on the bot-
tom-right). From the previous plot it is possible to evaluate how subjects within a pair agree in
terms of the forward velocity: the average difference between the CoM forward velocities of
subjects A and subjects B is very small (0:005 � 0:0127 m
s).
2.2.5 Gait synchronization.
Subjects within a pair tend to converge to the same GCT, as
explained in Subsection 2.2.2. Therefore, by definition of a synchronized gait as presented in
Subsection 2.1, in order to examine synchronization, phase lag needs to be analyzed. Based on
our phase lag estimation, as shown on the top left of Fig 4, on average, the subjects exhibit a
synchronized gait in 72.5 ± 19.9% of each trial.
Moreover, if we consider the original system, which is made up of an object and two sub-
jects connected, as a single body with four legs, we observe that some patterns, which can be
generally associated to quadrupedal gaits, such as ‘Diagonal-Sequence’, ‘Pace’, or ‘Trot’ [11],
can be associated with the emerging synchronized gaits (see Fig 4, on the right).
In ‘Diagonal-Sequence’ gait, two limbs alternate with three limbs in supporting the weight
of the system. Thus, eight different combinations of limb support occur during one stride: four
combinations of three-leg support interspersed with four combinations of alternating two-leg
Fig 4. Percentage of synchronization and corresponding types of the resulting gait. The plot on the top-left shows the percentage of the paired trials
with coordinated gaits versus those with not coordinated gaits. The plot on the bottom-left shows the percentage of different types of quadrupedal-like gaits
(e.g., trot, D-S, and pace) among all of the coordinated gaits. On the right an example of gait foot-fall pattern of Pair02 at three different trials is reported. Here
each segment represents the stance foot (the one on the ground) of one subject. Yellow segments represent the right foot of Subject A while the black
segments represent the right foot of Subject B. Given the symmetry between left and right foot-fall patterns, only one foot is represented for each subject.

 support (right/left diagonal and right/left lateral support). In the ‘Pace’ gait the two lateral
limbs are used alternately for weight support. For the ‘Trot’ gait, right and left diagonals alter-
nate in supporting the weight.
The phase lag ϕ, as defined in Subsection 2.1, can be used to classify the quadrupedal-
like gaits. More specifically, if ϕ � 0˚ the two subjects converge to a pace-like gait while if
ϕ � 180˚, the two subjects converge to a trot-like gait, and finally if ϕ � 225˚ a diagonal
sequence-like gait appears.
With the above definitions, among all the synchronized gaits pace gait (40.9%), trot gait
(36.4%) and diagonal-sequence (D-S) (22.7%) can be identified (see the bottom-left of Fig 4).
2.2.6 Interlimb coordination.
The interlimb coordination is presented here as the corre-
lation between subjects’ step periods and the arms’ oscillation periods during paired trials.
Arms’ oscillation is defined as the relative displacement over time between each subject’s CoM
and the object’s CoM, computed along the forward direction. From such a displacement,
which is almost periodic (see Fig 5, plot on the right), it is possible to extract the oscillation
period for Subject A and B in each pair as the time difference between two local maxima (or
two local minima) of the horizontal relative displacement between one subject’s and object’s
CoM. The plot on the left in Fig 5 shows that the period of arms’ oscillation is almost equal to
the step period. In this plot each point represents a pair step period-arms’ oscillation period
for each Subject A and Subject B within a pair during paired trials. For Subjects on the back
there is a larger dispersion of points that can be associated to the greater range of arms’
motions in the forward direction compared to the backward direction.
Fig 5. Interlimb coordination of Subject A/Subject B for each trial. The first two plots from the left show the relationship between arms’ oscillation
periods and step periods in each paired trial and for each subject (Subject A, on the left, and Subject B, on the right). Correlation coefficients for each plot
show that such a relationship between the aforementioned periods is linear (see black straight line obtained by a linear regression fitting) and that it is close to
the line y = x (red line in the plots). The last plot on the right shows the relative displacement on the forward direction between the subjects’ (Subject A and B
are represented in yellow and black, respectively) and object’s CoMs.

 3 The model
Several models can be used for bipedal locomotion, however, perhaps the simplest model that
can explain some key features of human walking, such as CoM displacement and Ground
Reaction Forces (GRF), is the SLIP model, initially designed to model running but then
extended to model walking as well [12, 13]. Because of its simplicity and explanatory power we
decided to use such a model as a constituent unit to describe two bipedal agents walking
together while mechanically paired.
As shown in Fig 6, in our model, two SLIP models are linked together with a spring-mass-
damper connection, where the following assumptions are made:
• Double support phase is included;
• The mass of each agent is concentrated at its CoM;
• The model has point feet;
• Arms effect in the coupling is represented as a spring and damper system with constant
impedance;
• The vertical interaction forces between the subjects and the object does not affect the walking
gaits of the subjects.
The first three points are directly related to the choice of using the SLIP model as a constitu-
ent unit, while the final two points refer to the coupling between the two bipedal agents. The
assumption of using a spring and damper system to model the coupling can be associated on
one side to the mechanical characteristics of human muscles and on the other side to the arms’
oscillatory behaviour observed from the experimental data. Finally, the last assumption is
related to a qualitative analysis of the interaction force data, where in the experiments, by
using Optoforce sensors integrated in each handle of the stretcher-like object, we observed
Fig 6. Paired SLIPs model. On the left one SLIP is in the single support phase (the swing leg is not
represented), while the SLIP on the right is in the double support phase. In the middle a mass is connected to

 that the variations of the force in the forward direction result to be greater than the vertical
ones (see for example S2 Fig).
3.1 SLIP model
The SLIP model is one of the simplest models that yields human-like results in terms of walk-
ing behaviour [13]. The SLIP model can be used to model both walking and running [12, 13].
As previously mentioned, with the SLIP model it is possible to reproduce the GRFs that point
towards the CoM and depend only on the leg length and stiffness. In such a model, in order to
be able to replicate human data, it is necessary to set appropriate values for the parameters
such as spring stiffness, angle of attack, and mass. Moreover, the only variables of the model
that have to be initialized with appropriate values are the CoM position at the apex (that is, the
point where the height of the CoM reaches its maximum value) and the CoM velocity or, alter-
natively, the initial energy of the system. To avoid dependency of the vertical position on the
leg length, the vertical position of the apex is always defined with respect to the one reached by
the CoM when the leg’s spring is at rest. The horizontal position at the apex is computed with
respect to the support point.
3.2 Paired SLIPs model
The paired model is made up of two SLIPs connected together by a parallel mass, spring and
damper system, as shown in Fig 6. This system can be described by the following equations of

For this model, the initial conditions are crucial; in particular, it is necessary to define
• xapexið0Þ, i = 1, 2, which is the horizontal position of each pendulum’s CoM at the apex with
respect to the foot position;
• zapexið0Þ, i = 1, 2, which is the vertical CoM position of each pendulum at the apex height
that is defined with respect to the CoM vertical position at rest;
• E0i, i = 1, 2, which is the initial energy of each pendulum.
Furthermore, in order to better replicate human gait, we choose the range of the following
parameters according to [6, 13]:
• Masses (m1, m2) and initial leg lengths (l01, l02) of each pendulum
• Legs’ stiffness (kleg) and angle of attack (α)
• Arms’ stiffness (k1, k2) and damping (b1, b2)
Table 4 shows the mechanical range of these parameters.
Regarding the arm equilibrium lengths (L01 and L02), we note that since we always assume
that at the beginning of the simulations the arms’ lengths (L1(0) and L2(0)) are equal to their
equilibrium lengths, and the only way L01 and L02 appear in the equations of motion is in the
form of (L1 − L01) and (L2 − L02), the specific values of L01 and L02 will not effect the results.

 Since the paired-SLIPs model described above has no means of injection of energy, but has
dissipation of energy, it generally does not possess periodic solutions. However, as we can see
in Section 4 and 5, it is possible to find approximate periodic orbits up to a very small thresh-
old (e.g., state values that vary less than 0.1% from step to step) in a relatively large window of
time (100 s). With this definition of an approximate periodic orbit, we are still able to study the
role of passive mechanism in achieving synchronized periodic solutions in paired walking.
To obtain periodic solutions as defined above, for given mi, li, and initial conditions
zapexið0Þ, and initial energy, E0i, by a systematic search (Subsection 4.1), we find legs’ stiffness
(klegi), angle of attack (αi), arms’ stiffness (ki), and damping (bi) such that the paired SLIP
model reaches a periodic walking gait as previously defined.
4 Periodic solutions of the model
4.1 Systematic search
In this section we present a method to find the system parameters (arms/legs stiffness and
angles of attack) which lead to solutions that respect the approximate periodic condition.
Because of the complexity of the model and the high dimensionality of the search grid
(NP, where P is the number of parameters to analyze), the analysis is completed in three steps
such that in each step we only search for two parameters.
In each step of the systematic search we evaluate the following Periodicity Score (SP) func-
tion:

 points are always less than the defined tolerance. If j does not exist, the gait is considered to
be not periodic, and its score is assigned as 0.
The periodicity score described above is defined based on the notion of the ‘return map’,
which sends the horizontal and vertical positions of each pendulum at the apex in the current
step to the ones in the next step. Intuitively, the higher the periodicity score is, the closer is the
apex to its value in the previous steps. In this way we are able to define a score that is capable of
measuring the periodicity of the solutions for our system.
The three steps of the systematic search are explained in details in the following:
• Step 1—Unpaired pendulums: Based on the periodicity score SP, the best value of the leg
stiffness and the angle of attack is found for the single bipedal agent (SLIP);
• Step 2—Paired system: Arms’ impedance (which is assumed to be the same for both pendu-
lums) that maximizes SP is found. Here, the angle of attack and the leg stiffness are fixed to
the values found in Step 1.
• Step 3—Paired system: Best values of the leg stiffness and the angle of attack for each pendu-
lum are found according to the periodicity score. Arms impedance is fixed to the value
found in Step 2.
An alternative approach could be searching for all four parameters (i.e., leg stiffness and
angle of attack, arm stiffness and damping) at the same time, however, with the above system-
atic search, at each stage only two parameters are searched for; this approach greatly reduces
the computation time.
We note that the first two steps of the systematic search are important to find the legs and
arms impedance able to guarantee a periodic walking behaviour of the paired system as
defined in Subsection 3.2: at the beginning, the two pendulums are unpaired, and we look for
individual locomotion periodicity by testing different leg stiffnesses and angles of attack; then
the paired system is analyzed by fixing the legs stiffness and angles of attack and testing the
walking gait for different arms impedance. Finally, Step 3 is necessary to better adjust legs stiff-
ness and angles of attack of each pendulum while paired compared to the values found in Step
1, which were optimized for the unpaired system.
Fig 7 presents the results of the three steps of the algorithm. It turns out that the system has
a higher periodicity score for higher stiffness values.
4.2 An example of a synchronized gait
Since in a periodic gait, as defined in Subsection 3.2, the trajectories and the velocities of the
two pendulums are almost identical (with a tolerance of 10−3), the periodic gaits found by the
systematic search are necessarily synchronized gaits as defined in Section 2. Here, we present
an example of such a synchronized gait found by the systematic search algorithm (see Fig 8
and S1 Video). In this simulation, the mass and leg length are assumed to be the same for both
pendulums (m1 = m2 = 80 kg, l1 = l2 = 1 m). With the initial conditions shown in Table 5, the
parameters are found using the systematic search method, the outcome of which is shown in
Table 6.
As expected from the systematic search, the convergence of the system to a synchronized
gait strongly depends on the right choice of parameters. By choosing a wrong set of parame-
ters, the two SLIPs that start with different initial conditions will fall after a few steps (see S2
Video). This could suggest that once coupled, each simulated bipedal agent has to properly
adjust its arms impedance and legs stiffness according to the behaviour of the other agent.

 5 Data comparison
As explained in the Section 1, we would like to understand whether the behaviour of two sub-
jects walking together while mechanically paired could be explained just by the passive
mechanics of the overall system. To this end, the paired SLIPs model which is introduced in
Section 3, is used in this section to replicate and predict the human experimental data. For
each bipedal agent we use anthropometric data to set the mass and leg length for data compari-
son. With this comparison two main questions have to be addressed:
1. Is the model capable of reproducing the behaviour of the real paired system?
2. How well can the model predict the behaviour of the real paired system?
There is a slight difference between these two questions. In the first one, we want to force
the model to capture the experimental data from the paired trials, while in the second one, just
by using the knowledge of the preferred walking gait parameters of each subject in solo trial,
we would like to check whether the model can predict the paired behaviour. To answer both
aforementioned questions, two different data fitting analyses are proposed in Subsections 5.1
and 5.2.
Fig 7. Systematic search. The figure shows the three main steps of the systematic search: in the first step (plot on the top-left) the best angle of attack (α)
and leg stiffness (kl) for each pendulum separately (no coupling) are found. In the step 2 (plot on the top-right) the best arms’ stiffness parameters (spring
stiffness k and damping parameter, b) for each pendulum in the paired system are found. Finally, in step 3 (plot on the bottom) the best angle of attack (α)
and leg stiffness (kl) for each pendulum while paired are found. Here, the arms’ stiffness and damping are fixed (k = 3.5 � 103 N/m, b = 320 Ns/m) according to
the best solution found in the previous step of the systematic search. In all cases yellow regions indicate pairs of parameters that guarantee a high periodicity
score while the blue regions represent pairs of parameters that result in a low periodicity score.

 5.1 Simulation of the paired behaviour by fitting the experimental paired
trial data
In this subsection we present a method to examine whether the model is capable of reproduc-
ing the behaviour of the real paired system. To this end, we search for sets of model parameters
that allow the system to reach a periodic walking gait as defined in Subsection 3.2 which is, at
the same time, consistent with the experimental paired data; such a search for model parame-
ters is referred to as ‘paired trial fitting’. To implement the ‘paired trial fitting’, it is necessary
to introduce a new systematic search that is slightly different from the one described in Subsec-
tion 4.1. In particular, the three main steps of the systematic search in Subsection 4.1 remain
the same, as well as the parameters we search for. However, since we want to constrain the
model to fit the experimental paired trial data, a new score, called Global Score (SG), which will
be evaluated at the end of each search step, is defined as follows:
SG ¼ SS � SR � SP;

In the top-left graph, the relative displacement, in the forward direction, between the two CoMs is presented. In the bottom-left graph, the
yellow curve refers to the first pendulum’s CoM displacement in the forward direction while the black curve represents the other pendulum’s
CoM displacement. In the top-right graph, the black curve refers to the forward velocity of the first pendulum while the yellow curve refers to
that of the second pendulum. Finally, in the bottom-left graph, the CoM vertical displacement is presented for both pendulums.

Table 5. Initial conditions in terms of energy, horizontal and vertical positions of the pendulums. Contrary to Step 1 and Step 3, different initial condi-
tions are selected in Step 2, where the two SLIPs are paired, and we look for arms’ impedance that maximizes SP. Such a choice is important since we can
allow the system to have dynamic interactions and to check whether, when starting with different conditions, the two modeled agents can reach a synchro-
nized gait.

 where SR is the Real Conditions Score and is used to evaluate how close are the apex position
and velocity of the modeled system to the experimental one, SS, is the Synchronization Score,
which is defined based on the ratio of the GCT of Subject A to that of Subject B by which we
measure how well synchronized the gaits are, and finally SP is the score defined in Subsection
4.1. Exact definitions of SR and SS can be found in S1 Appendix.
In the simulations, the mass and leg length of each pendulum are set to be the same as those
of the corresponding subject in the pair, while the mass of the object in between is set to be the
same as that of the stretcher-like object from the experiments.
5.2 Simulation of the paired behaviour by fitting the experimental solo
trial data
In order to evaluate the predictive power of the model presented in Section 3, the approach
adopted here is to fit each modeled agent (that is, each SLIP) to each subject’s features, such as
mass, leg length, initial velocity, apex height, etc. during the solo trial. We then search for sets
of parameters (angle of attack, arms’ impedance, and legs’ stiffness) as described in Subsection
4.1; we call this search for the model parameters ‘solo trial fitting’. Unlike Subsection 5.1, no
optimization for matching the simulations with the experimental data of the paired trial has
been taken into account. The score used for the systematic search in this case is the one intro-
duced in Subsection 4.1.
5.3 Methods and results
The implementations of the ‘solo trial fitting’ and the ‘paired trial fitting’ show that there exist
solutions which respect the periodicity condition introduced in Subsection 3.2 for a specific
set of impedance parameters. Several walking parameters of the paired model are compared
with the experimental results in order to evaluate whether the model is able to replicate and/or
predict humans’ behaviour.
In particular, the main evaluated variables are:
• CoM trajectory;
• GCT;
• Step length;
• Forward velocity;
• Gait foot-fall pattern.
We did not analyze the interlimb coordination since in the presented model the synchro-
nized gait is obtained so that the interactions between the modeled agents and the object
reduce over time in order to reduce energy dissipation.
With respect to the first parameter analyzed, the CoM vertical displacement of each mod-
eled agent is compared with that of the corresponding subject. Moreover, the CoM displace-
ment of each modeled agent is compared between the solo and paired trials through
Procrustes analysis [10]. Fig 9 shows that in both solo and paired trial fittings the model is able

 to reproduce CoM vertical displacement of the subjects during paired trials. Moreover, in the
solo trial fitting the model is able to reproduce human’s behaviour of keeping the same vertical
CoM displacement between the solo and paired trials. Indeed, by applying Procrustes analysis
[10] between each modeled agents’ CoM vertical displacement during the paired and solo tri-
als, we obtained a dissimilarity measure close to zero in all the cases.
For the GCT, step length, and forward velocity, we performed repeated measure ANOVA
with three different conditions, namely, solo trial, paired trial in position A (front), and paired
trial in position B (back), as evaluated for the experiments (see Subsections 2.1).
The graphs in Fig 10 show that, in contrast to human’s behaviour, in the solo trial fitting
results there is not a significant tendency for each modeled agent to either increase the GCT or
decrease the step length and the forward velocity when paired compared to the solo trial.
On the right side of Fig 10, we report the means and standard deviations of the forward
velocities in four different cases: paired and solo trial fitting results and experimental solo and
paired trials. We can observe that the forward velocity in the solo trial fitting is always higher
than the one expected in the experimental paired trials. Indeed, the value of the forward veloc-
ity in solo trial fitting remains close to those of the experimental solo trials of each subject.
A final comparison between the behaviour of the paired SLIPs model and the experimental
data is realized in terms of the gait foot-fall pattern. To perform such a comparison, just a
short window of time of the experimental foot-fall pattern data can be evaluated because of the
limitated size of the room where the experiments took place. As a consequence, the same time
window will be considered in the comparison of the gait foot-fall pattern between the experi-
ments and the simulations.
As an example, the foot-fall patterns in the experiments and the simulations are presented
in Fig 11 for Pair 02 (similar results are obtained for other pairs), where we can observe ‘Trot’
like gait (on the left) and ‘Pace’ like gait (on the right). Since the model is 2-dimensional, we

CoM vertical diplacements of the modeled agents.

 cannot distinguish between the trot and the pace gait. The distinction reported is based on the
initial configuration of the two SLIPs: by assuming, for example, that the two pendulums start
with the same leg (indicated as ‘right’), one can monitor such a leg with respect to the other
(indicated as ‘left’). In this way if the two SLIPs reach a periodic gait while moving forward the
same leg (‘right’ or ‘left’) at the same time, we can associate the resultant gait to a pace-like gait
and otherwise to a trot-like gait. In Fig 11 the foot-fall pattern results of the paired trial fitting
are presented. With the paired trial fitting we are able to reproduce trot and pace gaits
observed in the experimental data with the same stepping frequency of the analyzed subject.
To visualize how well the paired trial fitting can predict the experimental data, snapshots of the
simulations versus the experimental data for Trial 4 of Pair 02 are presented in Fig 12 (see also
S3 Video). With the solo trial fitting we are still able to reproduce the coordinated gaits (in par-
ticular, pace and trot gaits), but with a different stepping frequency compared to the one
observed in the experimental data. Such a discrepancy is due to the model limitation in repro-
ducing the reduction in forward velocity, as explained before for Fig 10.
6 Discussion
The presented work investigates the effects of a mechanical connection between two bipedal
agents on their walking gaits, aiming to answer the following questions:
• Do humans alter their gaits when they are physically paired with another human through an
object while one is walking in front of the other?

alpha = 0.05) is reported in order to clearly show the results of repeated measure ANOVA performed for three dependent variables (GCT on top, step length
in the middle, and forward velocity on the bottom) with three conditions: solo trial (blue bars), paired trial when the modeled agent is in front (violet bars) and
back (pink bars). The graphs on the right side show the means forward velocities and corresponding standard deviations for each pair for 4 different cases:
paired trial fitting (dark blue bars), solo trial fitting (dark pink bars), experimental paired trial (light blue bars), and finally experimental solo trial (pink bars).

 • Do humans temporally coordinate their movements when they are physically paired? If yes,
do they exhibit typical “quadrupedal” gaits, and if so, which ones?
• To what extent the coordination is caused by the passive mechanical connection of the two
bipedal system?
• Is it possible to replicate the experimental data with a paired Spring Loaded Inverted Pendu-
lums (SLIPs) model?
• Is it possible to predict the behaviour of the paired walking after fitting each pendulum
(SLIP) separately with data from the free (not paired) walking experiments?
To answer the above questions, we present human-human interactive locomotion experi-
ments showing how the mechanical coupling causes changes in the human walking gait; in
particular, we observe that such a mechanical coupling causes a statistically significant reduc-
tion in the preferred forward speed (p = 0.015), step length (p = 0.017), and a significant
increase of the GCT (p = 0.02). This adaptation of the gait through reduction of speed and
increase of GCT could be due to the fact that each subject tries to accomodate to the motion of
the other subject which is detected by interaction forces, visual and acoustic information.
The vertical component of the CoM trajectory of each subject does not significantly change
when paired (the worst dissimilarity measure value is d = 5.3 � 10−6). Moreover, we observe
coordination in the foot-fall patterns of the paired subject in 72.5 ± 19.9% of each trial, on
average. That is, on average in 72.5 ± 19.9% of each trial the subjects paired together through a
mechanical link while walking for few steps have the same stride frequency and establish a
constant phase lag between homologous legs. Indeed, the subjects reproduce some foot-fall
patterns generally associated to quadrupedal type gaits (e.g. pace, trot, and diagonal-sequence).

 This inter-subject coordination can be considered as a starting point for further investigation
through longer trials.
We also present a simplified model for the mechanical analysis of the interactive locomo-
tion. The model can be used to infer some properties of the real system and to evaluate
whether some human behaviours can be associated to passive mechanical properties. Perform-
ing the systematic search presented in Subsection 4.1, it is observed that the region of periodic
behaviour as defined in Subsection 3.2 presented in terms of angles of attack and legs stiffness,
enlarges once the two pendulums are paired compared to the case of solo walking (i.e., without
any mechanical connections). This observation suggests that the mechanical link may be used
by the bipedal agents as a way to make the system more robust.
Moreover, the simulation results show that the paired-SLIPs model can predict some char-
acteristics of the gaits during the interactive locomotion. In particular, it is able to:
• reproduce the vertical CoM diplacement of human subjects: Experimental CoM vertical dis-
placement has been reproduced by the model both with paired trial fitting optimization and
with solo trial fitting optimization. The best and the worst fittings of the experimental CoM
vertical displacement have been presented showing how well our simple model can repro-
duce the human behaviour in term of the CoM vertical displacement. Indeed, even in the
worst fitting, the dissimilarity measure is very small (d = 1.8 � 10−3);
• predict the statistically negligible differance between subjects’ CoM vertical displacement
during the solo and paired trials;
• predict and reproduce the emerging of some quadrupedal gait foot-fall patterns (in particu-
lar, pace and trot gaits);
• predict the preference for synchronized gaits in spite of different parameters of the agents;
• predict the different trends found in the experimental paired behaviours: if the two pendu-
lums have the same initial velocity, they can either converge to another common velocity or
they can keep the same walking speed. However, the latter case refers to identical modeled
subjects (SLIPs) that can hardly reflect the reality. Finally, if two pendulums have different
initial walking speeds, by choosing appropriate model parameters, they converge to another
walking speed that is not the same as any of their initial velocities due to the energy
dissipation.
However, the change in the forward velocity once the two subjects are paired, even for the
ones with similar preferred speed during the solo trials, cannot be explained just by a mechani-
cal effect with our simple model. As discussed before, according to the experiments, mechani-
cal coupling the system has the effect of reducing the mean forward velocity for at least one
subject within each pair. With the first algorithm, in which we optimize the system for the
paired system parameters, we obtain a very good match between the experimental data and the
simulation results even in terms of the forward velocity. However, when we do not optimize
for experimental paired data, we cannot match the level of reduction in the forward velocity
found in the experimental data for most of the subjects once paired with another one, and the
to the modeled CoMs, the pivot points and the carried mass, and they are all connected with single red lines. Blue dots represent the
CoMs of each subject and that of the table. Finally, grey dots represent subjects’ markers recorded during the experiments (dark grey
is used to show the right side of the subject while light grey indicates the left side). Only the lower limb grey dots have been connected
to better represents subjects’ legs and feet.

 forward velocity remains close to its value in the solo experimental trial, which was chosen to
be the initial condition of the simulated paired system.
Moreover, the model does not demonstrate the D-S gait mainly because the two SLIP mod-
els must have the same motion due to dissipation.
These results suggest that some behavior of humans while carrying objects with other
humans seem to be only due to the passive mechanical properties rather than high-level con-
trol strategies such as foot-placement. However, some other features of the emerging paired
walking gait might be related to cognitive and/or psychological effects, that in the model may
be represented by addition or subtraction of energy according to a specific control architec-
ture. Probably, more complex motor control actions have to be considered in order to better
understand this phenomenon.
