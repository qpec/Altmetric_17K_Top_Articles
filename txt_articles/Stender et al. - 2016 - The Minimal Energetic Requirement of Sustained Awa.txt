In Brief
Stender et al. show that positron emission
tomography measurement of whole-brain
glucose metabolic state allows accurate
diagnosis and prediction of disorders of
consciousness. Recovery from the
unresponsive wakefulness condition
occurs above a sharply defined brain
metabolic limit, reflecting the minimal
energetic requirements of
consciousness.

SUMMARY
Differentiation of the minimally conscious state
(MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome
(UWS) is a persistent clinical challenge [1]. Based
on positron emission tomography (PET) studies
with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) during sleep
and anesthesia, the global cerebral metabolic rate
of glucose has been proposed as an indicator of con-
sciousness [2, 3]. Likewise, FDG-PET may contribute
to the clinical diagnosis of disorders of conscious-
ness (DOCs) [4, 5]. However, current methods are
non-quantitative and have important drawbacks
deriving from visually guided assessment of relative
changes in brain metabolism [4]. We here used
FDG-PET to measure resting state brain glucose
metabolism in 131 DOC patients to identify objective
quantitative metabolic indicators and predictors of
awareness. Quantitation of images was performed
by normalizing to extracerebral tissue. We show
that 42% of normal cortical activity represents the
minimal energetic requirement for the presence of
conscious awareness. Overall, the cerebral meta-
bolic rate accounted for the current level, or immi-
nent return, of awareness in 94% of the patient
population, suggesting a global energetic threshold
effect, associated with the reemergence of con-
sciousness after brain injury. Our data further re-
vealed that regional variations relative to the global
resting metabolic level reflect preservation of spe-
cific cognitive or sensory modules, such as vision
and language comprehension. These findings pro-
vide a simple and objective metabolic marker of
consciousness, which can readily be implemented
clinically. The direct correlation between brain meta-
bolism and behavior further suggests that DOCs can
fundamentally be understood as pathological neuro-
energetic conditions and provide a unifying physio-
logical basis for these syndromes.
RESULTS
Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with [18F]-fluoro-
deoxyglucose (FDG) suggest that impaired consciousness
following brain injury is associated with overall brain metabolic
levels of 40%–60% of normal in conditions of coma, unrespon-
sive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), and minimally conscious
state (MCS) [5, 6]. Notwithstanding, relative regional variations
in metabolism correlate with the preservation of specific
behavioral or perceptual functions in MCS patients [7, 8], sup-
porting the claim that network activations cause local increases
in energy metabolism even in disorders of consciousness
(DOCs) [9]. Although assessment of relative cerebral metabolic
patterns with FDG-PET is a sensitive diagnostic tool in DOCs,
current methods are non-quantitative and inherently examiner
dependent. The development of diagnostic markers based on
quantitative measures of brain metabolism would enable a
more objective method for diagnosing DOCs, but they necessi-
tate the establishment of absolute energetic requirements of
awareness. However, no absolute cerebral metabolic criteria
exist that allow to distinguish between MCS and the more severe
UWS [1, 6], mainly because the presence of severe brain pathol-
ogy interferes with conventional non-invasive quantification
methods. We therefore employed a method of FDG uptake
normalization relative to extracerebral tissue, developed specif-
ically to accommodate difficulties in PET imaging of severe brain
injury patients. We hypothesized that global glucose metabolic
activity predicts the capacity for maintenance of conscious
awareness, while its regional variations reflect the integrity of
specific perceptual or cognitive functions. We also test the hy-
pothesis that the global cerebral metabolic rate predicts the pres-
ervation or reattainment of consciousness at 1-year follow-up.
FDG-PET data at rest were acquired in 131 DOC patients and
28 healthy controls (Table 1). The patient population was split
into independent cohorts for derivation and validation of the
diagnostic model (Table S1). PET images were normalized to
signal intensity in the extracerebral cephalic tissue, which is un-
affected by brain injury and stable across subjects, thus yielding
a pseudo-quantitative cerebral metabolic index. To perform the
normalization, a reference distribution was calculated from the
extracerebral tissue intensity distributions of the 28 control
subjects. Each individual image of the study population was
1494

 subsequently normalized, by selecting a global scaling factor of
the image intensity such that the Jensen-Shannon divergence
between the reference distribution and the subject’s extracere-
bral intensity distribution was minimized [10]. Metabolic activity
after normalization was assigned an index value, with average
extracerebral metabolism in the reference distribution set to
one (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Brain images
were then first segmented into entire cerebral cortex of left and
right hemispheres and then further according to Brodmann areas
(BA) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We extracted the
mean cortical FDG uptake in each hemisphere and BA volumes
of interest (VOIs). We used the mean cortical metabolism of the
best preserved hemisphere (with highest mean cortical meta-
bolism prior to lesion masking) to classify between UWS and
MCS and predict outcome at 1-year follow-up, using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Global Glucose Metabolism Rate as Diagnostic Marker
Mean cortical metabolic index was 7.59 ± 1.19 in healthy con-
trols, 2.88 ± 0.74 (38% of normal) in UWS, 4.23 ± 1.03 (56% of
normal) in MCS, and 4.76 ± 0.65 (63% of normal) in emergence
from MCS (EMCS). See Figure 1 for individual patient examples.
One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for three compari-
sons showed that average metabolic rates were significantly
higher in MCS than UWS (p < 0.001) and in healthy controls
compared to EMCS (p < 0.001), but not in EMCS compared to
MCS (p = 0.098). Metabolic rates were not influenced by any
of a range of possible confounders, including age, etiology,
time since onset, and use of sedation during imaging (Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures).
Average cortical glucose metabolism gave diagnostic discrim-
ination between MCS and UWS at an area under the ROC-curve
(AUC) of 0.84 (confidence interval [CI] 0.67–1) in the derivation
cohort and 0.91 (CI 0.84–0.98) in the validation cohort. The per-
formance of the classifier did not significantly differ between the
two cohorts (p = 0.45). The best classification rate in the deriva-
tion cohort was achieved at a metabolic index of 3.17 (41% of
normal activity; Figure 2), resulting in 89% correct classification
between UWS and MCS, with 95% sensitivity and 79% speci-
ficity to MCS, thus satisfying reasonable requirements for a clin-
ically useful diagnostic criterion. In the validation cohort, this
diagnostic threshold provided an 87% correct classification
rate between UWS and MCS, with 95% sensitivity and 77%
specificity to MCS. Post hoc inference suggested an optimal
metabolic cutoff at a metabolic index of 3.19 (42% of normal)
in the validation cohort; all patient classifications at this level re-
mained unchanged compared to the derivation cohort threshold,
i.e., performance of the diagnostic model was similar in the deri-
vation and validation cohorts (Table 2).
Diagnostic accuracy with the above diagnostic criterion pro-
vided an AUC of 0.89 across the pooled cohort (CI 0.82–0.96).
There was 88% correct classification between MCS and UWS,
with 95% sensitivity and 78% specificity to MCS. Every EMCS
patient and healthy control was correctly identified as conscious.
Outcome Prediction
Outcome data at 1-year follow-up were obtained for 91% of the
patients. Demographic and clinical data did not differ between
patients with known outcome data and those without follow-up
data. Group discrimination by the metabolic criterion correctly
predicted 88% of all known patient outcomes, with 95% sensi-
tivity and 76% specificity to manifest consciousness at follow-
up (Figure 2; Table S3). A total of 11 UWS patients had brain
metabolism above the 41% diagnostic threshold. Of these, eight
had recovered consciousness at follow-up, and the remaining
three had died. One UWS patient with sub-threshold metabolism
progressed to MCS on follow-up. Of the three MCS patients with
sub-threshold metabolism, one died, while another one had no
change of clinical condition. The third patient was lost to
follow-up (Figure 2).
Regional Metabolic Activity
No specific regional drivers of the patients’ condition could be
identified, as the metabolic group differences were present
in all VOIs (Figure 3). Relative regional variability around the
mean activity was low, with interregional coefficients of variance
(SD/mean) of 6% in UWS, 13% in MCS, 14% in EMCS, and 15%
in controls.
FDG uptake in peristriate visual cortex (BA 18) had the highest
individual regional classification rate across the pooled cohort,
with an AUC of 0.90. This value, however, did not differ signifi-
cantly from the overall hemispheric classification rate (0.89;
p = 0.11). BA 18 classification rate (86%), sensitivity to MCS
(94%), and outcome prediction (80%) were slightly inferior to
classification by the entire hemisphere.
In order to test the hypothesis that regional variations relative
to the resting baseline metabolism can reflect preservation of
specific cognitive and sensory functions, we first normalized all
images to their global best-hemisphere mean (GM). Next, we
calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between visual
awareness, defined by the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised
(CRS-R) as the capacity for visual tracking, and GM normalized

 activity and absolute mean activity within visual cortex BAs 17,
18, and 19. Along the same line, we tested whether the ability
to respond to verbal commands correlated with GM-normalized
activity as well as absolute mean activity in areas commonly
associated with receptive aphasia, i.e., the left primary and sec-
ondary auditory cortices (BAs 20–22) and Wernicke’s area (BAs
39 and 40). Only MCS patients were included in this analysis. The
presence of visual responsiveness correlated with GM-normal-
ized metabolic rate in the visual cortex (r = 0.24, p = 0.028),
but not with absolute metabolic rates (r = 0.12, p = 0.29). Capac-
ity for command following correlated with both GM-normalized
and extracerebral normalized metabolic index in the auditory
and language-related areas (r = 0.49, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.39,
p = 0.002, respectively).
DISCUSSION
We tested the capacity of FDG-PET to diagnose the presence
and to predict the recovery of consciousness in brain-injured
subjects, using a novel measure of cerebral metabolic activity
based on extracerebral tissue normalization. The model accu-
racy was determined in two independent cohorts, using both
behavioral diagnosis and outcome at 1-year follow-up as refer-
ences. We show that our index of cerebral metabolic activity dif-
ferentiates accurately between UWS and MCS patients, hence

providing a strong diagnostic and prog-
nostic marker for chronic DOCs.
Global Cortical Metabolism as
Predictor of Consciousness
We hypothesized that the average cortical
metabolic activity in the most intact cere-
bral hemisphere can be used to classify
patients suffering from chronic DOCs. As
large lateralized cerebral lesions are prev-
alentin thispopulation andmayselectively
impair functioning of the affected hemi-
sphere [11], global mean metabolic activ-
ity is a poor representation of preserved
cerebral function. Since there is ample ev-
idence that conscious awareness can be
maintained with only one hemisphere
[12, 13], we reasoned that an FDG-PET in-
dex of glucose metabolism of the least injured cortical hemi-
sphere would be a better indicator of consciousness than is
whole-brain cortical activity. This prediction was confirmed by
our finding that mean glucose metabolism index in the best pre-
served hemisphere is an accurate subject-level diagnostic
marker and that no individual brain region provided better classi-
fication than the average cortical signal. The diagnostic perfor-
mance of this method was equally good in the derivation and
validation samples, indicating that the method is valid across in-
dependent cohorts. ROC of the classification between MCS and
UWS gave a common ‘‘optimal’’ diagnostic threshold of 42% of
normal metabolic activity, resulting in excellent sensitivity and
adequate specificity to MCS. Moreover, all EMCS patients and
healthy controls were correctly identified as being conscious.
We conclude that this FDG-PET diagnostic threshold provides
reliable differentiation between conscious and unconscious sub-
jects, with a good balance between type I and type II error risks.
The FDG metabolic index in the MCS groups largely overlap-
ped with that in EMCS and was in a few cases within the range
of healthy control values. This is not surprising given the fluctu-
ating severity of MCS. Also, the mean cortical glucose metabolic
index was not dependent on etiology or any of the potential
confounders such as age or gender. Together, these results sug-
gest that cerebral glucose metabolism is strongly linked to the
expression of consciousness, irrespective of cause of injury
1496

 and time since onset. Cerebral metabolic activity also accurately
predicted the level of consciousness at 1-year follow-up. Group
separation along the 42% diagnostic threshold had an overall
88% correct outcome prediction in the mixed group of MCS
and UWS patients. This is all the more compelling considering
that the relatively high mortality rate over the long follow-up
period may have attenuated the predictive power. Nonetheless,
our method correctly predicted eight out of ten recoveries
among UWS patients.
The specificity of the metabolic level to both diagnosis and
prognosis suggests that the classification threshold represents
the minimal energetic requirements of sustained awareness.
Notably, our results indicate that transition between the uncon-
scious and conscious states takes place above a sharply defined
global (or hemispheric) metabolic boundary and point to a global
energetic threshold effect, which enables the reemergence of
consciousness after brain injury. This finding is consistent with
previous propositions [2, 14] that consciousness cannot solely
be attributed to activity in specific networks or areas but is asso-
ciated with a whole-brain high energetic state. As such, pre-
served glucose metabolic rate in at least one hemisphere appears
a necessary (but not sufficient) condition to regain awareness af-

ter brain injury. Overall, the cortical meta-
bolic level accounted for the actual state
or imminent recovery in 94% of the UWS
and MCS patients. This direct correlation
between brain metabolism and behavior
indicates that global reduction of cortical
neuronal work is a defining characteristic
of DOCs and may provide a unifying phys-
iological basis for these syndromes.
Significance of Regional Metabolic
Variations Relative to the Cortical
Hemispheric Average
All subjects had regional cerebral meta-
bolic variations relative to the global
mean signal. Brain activation in response to specific sensory or
cognitive tasks can cause 10%–30% local increases in the
magnitude of cortical glucose metabolism relative to resting
baseline [9]. We reasoned that regions of relatively spared
glucose metabolism in our patient groups reflect sustained activ-
ity in support of specific cognitive or sensory functions. Thus,
while all conscious groups showed interregional variations with
a coefficient of variance of 13%–15%, i.e., within the range of
the proposed modular activation effect, glucose metabolic activ-
ity was nearly uniform across all cortical regions in UWS patients.
Regional metabolic patterns in the MCS and EMCS groups were
qualitatively similar to that observed in normal subjects, i.e., rela-
tively higher in primary sensorimotor areas, although the peaks
had lower absolute values and less variability. This pattern differs
substantially from that of UWS patients, which was character-
ized by overall low FDG uptake, and is accordingly associated
with capacity for consciousness. Our previous findings of rela-
tively lowered frontoparietal metabolism in UWS patients [4, 6]
can therefore be explained by the absence of regional activa-
tions rather than by a specific decline or injury to these areas.
MCS patients with absence of overt visual awareness had
relatively lower activity in visual cortex, further supporting the
functional relevance of regional variations in residual meta-
bolism. Conversely, these patients’ ability of command respond-
ing correlated with FDG uptake in auditory and language areas.
Notably, these correlations emerged or became stronger after
global mean scaling and therefore indicate relative preservation
of energy metabolism in regions subserving preserved cognitive
domains. Thus, with the global effect accounted for, specific
regional differences between unconscious and conscious pa-
tients largely appear to reflect preserved sensory or cognitive
capacity.

 Clinical Implementation
The results indicate that assessment of cortical glucose meta-
bolism by non-invasive FDG-PET is a reliable method for detect-
ing the presence of, or potential for, consciousness and
cognition after brain injury. The method is objective and compu-
tationally simple and provides easily interpretable results.
Overall, this represents an important improvement to current
non-quantitative diagnostic approaches with FDG-PET.
Study Limitations
We here assume a direct correlation between the metabolic in-
dex and actual neuronal work. The accuracy of this assumption
should be evaluated in further studies (but see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for supporting data). The present
study was cross-sectional and did not allow evaluation of rapid
evolution of metabolic status or their potential effects on clinical
outcome. While we cannot attribute causation in the link be-
tween high brain glucose metabolism and conscious awareness,
the FDG-PET literature on anesthesia [2, 3] suggests causation.
We could not assess possible contributions of cerebral morbidity
prior to injury, nor did we consider the normal declines in cerebral
metabolism between childhood and adolescence [15] and
further into old age [16].
The method requires high standards in image quality and
registration. Current atlas-based approaches cannot precisely
describe subcortical changes in severely deformed brains [17].
Investigations of subcortical metabolic drivers, such as tha-
lamo-cortical [18] or mesocircuit loops [19], therefore fall outside
the scope of this study.
Conclusions
Hemispheric preservation of brain glucose metabolism predicts
the presence, or potential for recovery, of consciousness in brain
injury patients. Loci of regionally preserved metabolism sub-
serve specific cognitive and sensory functions. The threshold
of 42% of normal cortical hemispheric metabolic activity repre-
sents the minimal energetic requirement predictive of regaining
consciousness. FDG-PET thus constitutes a strong diagnostic
and prognostic marker in DOC arising from brain injury, irrespec-
tive of its pathogenesis.
