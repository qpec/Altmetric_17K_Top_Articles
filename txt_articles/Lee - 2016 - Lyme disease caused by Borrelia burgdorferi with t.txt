Abstract: Lyme disease (LD), the most common tick-borne disease in North America, is 
believed to be caused exclusively by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and is usually diagnosed 
by clinical evaluation and serologic assays. As reported previously in a peer-reviewed article, 
a 13-year-old boy living in the Northeast of the USA was initially diagnosed with LD based 
on evaluation of his clinical presentations and on serologic test results. The patient was treated 
with a course of oral doxycycline for 28 days, and the symptoms resolved. A year later, the boy 
developed a series of unusual symptoms and did not attend school for 1 year. A LD specialist 
reviewed the case and found the serologic test band patterns nondiagnostic of LD. The boy was 
admitted to a psychiatric hospital. After discharge from the psychiatric hospital, a polymerase 
chain reaction test performed in a winter month when the boy was 16 years old showed a low 
density of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the blood of the patient, confirmed by partial 16S rRNA 
(ribosomal RNA) gene sequencing. Subsequent DNA sequencing analysis presented in this 
report demonstrated that the spirochete isolate was a novel strain of B. burgdorferi with two 
homeologous 16S rRNA genes, which has never been reported in the world literature. This case 
report shows that direct DNA sequencing is a valuable tool for reliable molecular diagnosis of 
Lyme and related borrelioses, as well as for studies of the diversity of the causative agents of 
LD because LD patients infected by a rare or novel borrelial variant may produce an antibody 
pattern that can be different from the pattern characteristic of an infection caused by a typical 
B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain.
Keywords: Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, homeologous 16S rRNA genes, DNA 
sequencing
Introduction
Lyme disease (LD) is believed to be caused exclusively by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu 
stricto in North America.1 Its diagnosis is primarily based on signs and symptoms, as 
well as a history of possible exposure to infected blacklegged ticks.2 The two-tiered 
serology test, namely, a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test 
followed by a positive immunoglobulin (Ig) M or IgG Western blot, is a recommended 
laboratory test.3 An IgM immunoblot is considered positive if two of the following three 
bands are present: 24 kDa (OspC), 39 kDa (BmpA), and 41 kDa (Fla). It is further 
recommended that an IgG immunoblot be considered positive if five of the following ten 
bands are present: 18 kDa, 21 kDa (OspC), 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa (BmpA), 41 kDa 
(Fla), 45 kDa, 58 kDa (not GroEL), 66 kDa, and 93 kDa.4 However, in early LD, when 
the characteristic skin rash, erythema migrans, of the patient is ,7 days old, 87% of the 
ELISA and 74.5% of the immunoblot tests may have a negative, equivocal, or interme-

diate result.5 The two-tiered serology test has been the subject 
of debate when it is relied upon for making the diagnosis 
of LD for patient management.6,7 A single-tier C6 peptide 
ELISA test apparently increases the detection sensitivity, 
but with decreased specificity.8 Recently, strains of Borrelia 
other than B. burgdorferi sensu stricto have been identified 
in some patients in the USA, with clinical manifestations of 
LD or symptoms and signs mimicking those observed in LD, 
using nucleic acid-based testing methods for identification of 
the causative agents.9–12 This report presents another case in 
which the patient’s serologic test results were questionable in 
the diagnosis of LD and the patient’s whole blood was posi-
tive for a novel strain of B. burgdorferi, confirmed by direct 
DNA sequencing. This case report also shows the need for 
wide implementation of the DNA sequencing technology in 
hospital laboratories located in LD-endemic areas for timely 
accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of LD patients, 
in addition to studying the diversity of the causative agents 
of Lyme and related borrelioses.
Case presentation
A 16-year-old boy living in the northeast state of Massa-
chusetts (MA), USA, had flu-like symptoms in a summer 
at the age of 13 years and developed bilateral knee swelling 
in the following winter. A serology test was performed and 
interpreted as being positive for LD at that time. The patient 
was treated with a course of oral doxycycline for 28 days, 
and the arthritis resolved. Approximately 12 months after 
that treatment, the patient started to complain of periodic 
sweating, flushing, severe fatigue, migratory joint pains, 
nausea, stomach pain, insomnia, and blurry vision and 
had a skin rash that was described by a clinician as “typi-
cal Bartonella rash”. As the result of these symptoms, the 
patient did not attend school for 1 year. Finally, the patient 
was seen by a LD consultant who interpreted the ELISA 
serology test to be positive, but the Western blot test to be 
negative because the IgM blot was totally negative and in the 
IgG blot, only four bands were accepted as positive. Based 
on the consultant’s opinion, the patient was hospitalized 
for pure psychiatric disorders at a psychiatric hospital for 
7 weeks. In the following winter month at the age of 16 years, 
a newly performed C6 peptide serology test showed that the 
patient had a positive C6 peptide Borrelia burgdorferi IgG/
IgM Lyme Index of 3.46 (normal range: ,0.91). A venous 
blood sample was tested by DNA sequencing for low-density 
spirochetemia at the Milford Hospital-affiliated molecular 
diagnostic  
laboratory (now Milford Molecular Diagnostics 
Laboratory). A brief history of this case with a typographic 
error, which stated that the consultant found five bands 
instead of four bands in the IgG immunoblots, was published 
under case 3 in Table 2 in a previous report.12 Publication of 
laboratory data with blinded patient identities was approved 
by the Milford Hospital Institutional Review Board as an 
ongoing research project.
The history presented in this report is the corrected version 
provided by the treating physician coauthor of the previous 
paper.12 This report records a subsequent significant laboratory 
finding on one of many cases previously published within a 
table in a peer-reviewed article,11 with the treating physician 
of the patient, as the coauthor. The consent from the legal 
guardian of the patient to publish the information on this 
case was obtained by the treating physician coauthor prior 
to publication of the previous article. The clinical history 
presented in this report is a replica of the history of case 3 in 
Table 2 of the previous article11 with a minor, but significant, 
correction.
Because of the unusual DNA sequence with numerous 
unresolved base-calling regions in the electropherogram of 
this case, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons 
were resequenced with optimized Sanger reactions. Same-
nested PCR amplification with a pair of borrelial genus-
specific primers, followed by direct Sanger sequencing of the 
nested PCR amplicon using the M2 primer as the sequencing 
primer,11,12 confirmed that there were two partially homolo-
gous Borrelia burgdorferi 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) gene 
sequences in the sample isolated from the patient’s blood. 
Visual analysis of a 210-base DNA sequence revealed a 
110-base unambiguous sequence followed by an immediately 
downstream 100-base ambiguous segment. The ambiguous 
DNA sequence is  
obviously caused by a shift in the reading 
frame (Figure 1).
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm 
showed that the first unambiguous 110 bases, namely, 
TTAACCCAACACCTCACAGCACGAGCTGACGA-
CAACCATGCAGCACCTGTATATAGACCCCAAACGGG-
GAATAATTATCTCTAACTATATCCTATATATGTCAAGC-
CCTG, represent a signature sequence of the B. burgdorferi 
sensu lato 16S rRNA gene (GenBank sequence ID CP009656; 
range: 445,000–445,109). Visual analysis showed that the 
immediately downstream 100-base segment with numerous 
double peaks is a composite of two superimposed sequences,

Submission of the 100-base sequence A for BLAST 
 
alignment algorithm confirmed that this is an immediately 
downstream continuation of a B. burgdorferi sensu lato 
16S rRNA gene sequence, with ID CP009656, range: 445, 
110–445,209, with a 100% ID match.
BLAST alignment algorithm of the 100-base sequence 
B showed no 100% ID match with any sequences cataloged 
in the GenBank. Due to deletion of a single “G” base at the 
position equivalent to 445,110 of the B. burgdorferi 16S rRNA 
gene sequence ID CP009656, there is a shift in the reading 
frame in Figure 1, caused by a sequence B superimposed on 
a sequence A. Based on known sequences retrieved from the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information database, 
sequence B has a maximum 97% ID match with a highly 
conserved 16S rRNA gene segment commonly shared by 
numerous spirochete species, including B. burgdorferi 
(ID CP009656, range: 445,111–445,210), B. turicatae (ID 
KP861623, range: 237–336), B. afzelii (ID CP009058, 
range: 447,714–447,813), B. hermsii (ID CP011060, range: 
447,836–447,935), and Treponema pallidum (ID CP007548, 
range: 232,098–232,197). One of these examples was copied 
from the BLAST report returned from the GenBank and is 
illustrated in Figure 2.
BLAST alignment analysis of the 210-base sequence 
composed of the 110-base unambiguous sequence and the 
100-base sequence A confirmed that this 210-base sequence 
represents a B. burgdorferi sensu lato 16S rRNA gene region 
with a 100% ID match from position 445,000 to position 
445,209 (GenBank sequence ID: CP009656.1).
However, alignment of the 210-base sequence composed 
of the 110-base unambiguous sequence and the 100-base 
sequence B against the sequence ID CP009656.1 showed 
deletion of one “G” nucleotide at reference position 445,110 
and three single-base substitutions: one C→A at reference 
position 445,121; one G→T at position 445,146; and one 
C→G at position 445,161 (Figure 2). When sequencing 
from the homologous end of the PCR amplicon, the deletion 
of one “G” base and three single-base substitutions in this 
segment caused initial analytical difficulty due to a reading 
frame shift. A search of the nucleotide sequence database in 
the GenBank failed to find a 16S rRNA gene sequence having 
a 100% ID match with sequence B. Attempts to sequence 
from the opposite end resulted in total failures.
Based on the 110-base unambiguous 16S rRNA gene 
sequence, the blood sample of this patient was diagnosed as 
being positive for a strain of B. burgdorferi sensu lato.

PCR-based molecular diagnoses of B. burgdorferi 
 
infection are often criticized because of possible DNA cross-
contamination in the laboratory. In the author’s laboratory, 
the positive control is a strain of B. coriaceae whose target 
16S rRNA gene DNA can be amplified with the genus-
specific M1/M2 primers, but its interprimer DNA sequence 
is different from the pathogenic borrelial species.11 Because 
all positive PCR products generated in this laboratory are 
validated with Sanger sequencing and because the sample in 
this case was proven to contain two partially homologous 16S 
rRNA gene sequences that never existed in the environment, 
the positive results found in this case could not have been 
due to laboratory DNA contamination. After the molecular 
diagnosis was made, the patient was referred to the infectious 
disease unit of a large medical center for further treatment. 
Clinical follow-up was not available.
Permission to publish the data included in this paper 
without patient identity was granted to the author by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Milford Hospital. A spe-
cial ethical approval was not required by, and was not sought 
from, the IRB of Milford Hospital prior to the work included 
in the current report because the subsequent work reveal-
ing new information after the publication of the first article 
only consisted of computer and visual analysis of the DNA 
sequencing electropherograms generated and used to support 
the molecular diagnosis of infection by a B. burgdorferi sensu 
lato strain already reported in the first publication 
Discussion
When pure cultures grown in liquid media are used as the 
study materials, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is shown to 
have only one copy of 16S rRNA gene in the chromosome.13 
Among the members of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato com-
plex, B. afzelii and B. garinii, the two other B. burgdorferi 
sensu lato species found only in Europe and Asia, may contain 
two copies of 16S rRNA genes, which are heterogeneous.14 
When there is a second 16S rRNA gene sequence found in 
a pure culture that does not match with a 16S rRNA gene 
sequence known to exist in another borrelial strain, the second 
copy of the two 16S rRNA genes is usually considered to be 
“nonfunctional” rather than as evidence of a novel strain or 
a mutant of Borrelia in the culture.14
Because 16S rRNA genes are highly conserved and 
because the sequence B as demonstrated in the current 
isolate with one-base deletion and three-base substitutions 
within a 100-base region is significantly different from a 
highly conserved 16S rRNA gene segment that is commonly 
shared by numerous spirochetes, including B. burgdorferi, 
B. turicatae, B. afzelii, B. hermsii, and T. pallidum, the find-
ing of these two partially homologous 16S rRNA genes in the 
current case is interpreted as evidence for the presence of one 
isolate of B. burgdorferi with two homeologous 16S rRNA 
genes, rather than a mixed infection of a wild-type clone of 
B. burgdorferi and a novel B. burgdorferi mutant. Nonethe-
less, mixed borrelial infection by two species of Borreliae, ie, 
a B. burgdorferi sensu lato and a B. miyamotoi in one blood 
sample has been previously reported.12 Single-nucleotide 
mutations in the 16S rRNA gene of B. burgdorferi are only 
rarely observed, eg, in experiments in the in vitro setting 
when the spirochetes develop resistance to aminoglycoside 
and spectinomycin.15 A B. burgdorferi mutant with one base 
deletion and three base substitutions in a highly conserved 
100-base region of the 16S rRNA gene has not been reported 
in the literature. Therefore, the isolate detected in the blood 
sample of this case is interpreted as a B. burgdorferi with 
two homeologous 16S rRNA genes. However, the final con-
firmation of such a biological entity depends on securing 
a pure culture of the spirochete and performance of a full

Borrelia burgdorferi with two homeologous 16S rRNA genes
chromosome sequencing if the organism can be grown in 
an artificial medium.
The author of this case report focuses on DNA sequenc-
ing diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis and has no access to the 
serology test results of this patient. According to the pri-
mary care physician of the patient, there was only one set 
of ELISA and Western blot tests. The IgM Western blot was 
consistently interpreted as negative. But the IgG Western 
blot was apparently questionable, initially interpreted as 
positive by the testing laboratory, but subsequently reinter-
preted by a LD expert as negative because only four bands 
instead of five were accepted as positive. In real life, different 
interpretations by different observers of a weak band with 
a borderline intensity in Western blots are not uncommon. 
Such a questionable serologic test pattern may be consistent 
with a LD infection caused by a variant strain other than the 
“prototype” B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. A variant strain of 
B. burgdorferi with two homeologous 16S rRNA genes may 
have other biological characteristics, including a different 
set of epitopes, which might have contributed to the atypical 
immunoblot serologic test results in this case.
Because the DNA sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of 
all bacterial species contain their respective unique hyper-
variable regions, a pair of 21-base species-specific LD PCR 
primers has been used to amplify a unique 351 bp segment 
of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato 16S rRNA gene for DNA 
sequencing-based molecular diagnosis of LD.16 Shifting the 
species-specific LD primers upstream for three nucleotides on 
both ends of the target DNA created a pair of “genus-specific” 
M1/M2 primers, which can amplify a highly conserved 
357 bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene of all species of the 
B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and the corresponding 
358 bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene of the heterogeneous 
relapsing fever borreliae, including B. miyamotoi.11,12 After 
implementation of this DNA-sequencing protocol in a 
molecular diagnostic laboratory, a novel Borrelia (GenBank 
Seq ID KM052618) was identified in an archived serum 
sample of a treated patient with neurologic LD.11 A strain 
of B. burgdorferi and a strain of B. miyamotoi were found 
as coinfecting organisms in a single blood sample of a LD 
patient by direct DNA sequencing.12 This case report adds 
further evidence that there is a great strain diversity in the 
borreliae causing Lyme and related borrelioses in the USA, 
which warrants further exploration.
Conclusion
DNA-sequencing technology is a highly specific tool in 
the molecular diagnosis of the causative agents of Lyme 
borreliosis. Using a pair of genus-specific PCR primers to 
perform same-nested PCR for amplification of the borrelial 
16S rRNA gene, followed by direct Sanger sequencing of the 
PCR amplicon, can detect and validate a wide range of Bor-
relia species, including novel Borrelia strains causing Lyme 
and related borrelioses. Direct DNA sequencing should be 
implemented in hospital laboratories in LD-endemic areas 
for early reliable diagnosis of this infectious disease and for 
further studies of the diversity of the causative agents of 
Lyme borreliosis.
