Abstract
OBJECTIVES—The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associations between 
anal intercourse and fecal incontinence.
METHODS—Analyses were based on data from 6,150 adults (≥20 years) from the 2009–2010 
cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Fecal incontinence was defined 
as the loss of liquid, solid, or mucus stool occurring at least monthly on a validated questionnaire. 
A gender-specific sexual behavior questionnaire assessed any anal intercourse via an audio 
computer-assisted personal interview. Co-variables included: age, race, education, poverty income 
ratio, body mass index, chronic illnesses, depression, loose stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale 
types 6 or 7), and reproductive variables in women. Prevalence estimates and prevalence odds 
ratios (PORs) were analyzed in adjusted multivariable models using appropriate sampling weights.
RESULTS—Overall, 4,170 adults aged 20–69 years (2,070 women and 2,100 men) completed 
sexual behavior questionnaires and responded to fecal incontinence questions. Anal intercourse 
was higher among women (37.3%) than men (4.5%), P<0.001. Fecal incontinence rates were

 higher among women (9.9 vs. 7.4%, P=0.05) and men (11.6 vs. 5.3%, P=0.03) reporting anal 
intercourse compared with those not reporting anal intercourse. After multivariable adjustment for 
other factors associated with fecal incontinence, anal intercourse remained a predictor of fecal 
incontinence among women (POR: 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0–2.0) and men (POR: 
2.8; 95% CI: 1.6–5.0).
CONCLUSIONS—The findings support the assessment of anal intercourse as a factor 
contributing to fecal incontinence in adults, especially among men.
INTRODUCTION
Anal intercourse is a common practice among both heterosexual and homosexual couples 
where at least one of the partners is male. Approximately 20% of women engage in anal 
intercourse and among homosexual male populations, anal intercourse is common, yet little 
is known about the impact of anal intercourse on fecal continence (1–4). Men engaged in 
anal intercourse may have lower manometry pressures than men not engaged in anal 
intercourse; however, few studies have examined fecal incontinence (FI) symptoms and anal 
intercourse (5,6).
Although specific sexual practices of women with FI are undescribed, women with FI are as 
likely to be sexually active as women without FI but their sexual function scores are lower 
(7,8). Studies evaluating the impact of FI treatment on sexual function are limited to 
descriptions in small populations following sphincteroplasty, with most studies reporting 
improved function and less embarrassment with sexual activity following treatment for FI 
(9–11).
The primary aim of this study was to determine if anal intercourse is associated with reports 
of FI, defined as the accidental loss of liquid, solid, or mucus stool occurring at least 
monthly. Secondary aims were (i) to characterize the prevalence of anal intercourse in a 
nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized US adults aged 20–69 years and (ii) 
to assess the relationship of anal intercourse with other known factors associated with FI, 
such as age, comorbid diseases, depression, and stool consistency. We hypothesized that 
both women and men who engaged in anal intercourse would have higher rates of FI.
METHODS
Study population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) are cross-sectional 
surveys of a nationally representative sample of a non-institutionalized population sampled 
using a complex, stratified, multi-stage, probability cluster design. The National Center for 
Health Statistics (NCHS) ethics review board approved the survey protocols, and all 
participants provided written informed consent.
The NHANES cycle for 2009–2010 included 6,150 adults aged ≥20 years of age. Questions 
specific to anal intercourse were administered to men and women aged 18–69 years. Women 
who were pregnant were excluded from the analysis. Questions about bowel symptoms were 
ascertained in the mobile examination center interview room using a computer-assisted

 personal interview system. Questions about sexual behaviors were ascertained in a private 
mobile examination center interview room using an audio computer-assisted personal 
interview system. Our final analytic sample included 4,170 adults aged 20–69 years who 
answered questions about anal intercourse and FI (Figure 1).
FI definition
For purposes of this analysis, FI was defined as leakage of mucus, liquid, and/or solid stool 
occurring at least monthly as reported on the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). The 
FISI has subjects ranked according to the frequency of incontinence into four separate 
categories of gas, mucus, liquid, and solid stool, ranging from 1 to 20, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity (12). Stool consistency was assessed using the Bristol Stool Form 
Scale (color picture card with pictures and written descriptors of the seven stool types) and 
the following written question: “Please look at this card and tell me the number that 
corresponds with your usual or most common stool type” (13). Hard stool was defined as a 
Type 1 (separate hard lumps, like nuts) or Type 2 rating (sausage like, but lumpy). Normal 
stool consistency was defined as Bristol Stool Scale Type 3, Type 4, and Type 5, and, as in 
other NHANES publications (14), Type 6 and Type 7 Bristol Stool Scale Types defined 
loose stool consistency.
Sexual behavior measures
The NHANES sexual behavior questionnaire uses different questions to assess anal 
intercourse according to gender. For women, a positive response to the question, “Have you 
ever had anal sex? (the contact of a man’s penis with your anus or butt)” defined anal 
intercourse. For men, a positive response to the question, “Have you ever had any kind of 
sex with a man, including oral or anal?” defined having anal intercourse. To validate the use 
of this question to define anal intercourse in men, we analyzed the concordance for the men 
responding affirmatively to the question for anal intercourse who also answered the 
following question, “In your lifetime, with how many men have you had anal sex?” Women 
were not asked about the number of anal intercourse encounters. No questions queried the 
frequency of anal intercourse.
Other measurements
Sociodemographic measures included age categories (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60–
69 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic-Mexican 
American, Hispanic—other, Other—including multi-racial), education (less than high 
school, high school, or more than high school), and poverty income ratio categorized as <1 
(below the poverty threshold), 1 to 2 (1–2×the poverty threshold), and ≥2 (2×the poverty 
threshold). Participants’ weight and height were measured and body mass index was 
calculated as normal weight, over-weight, or obese (<25.0, 25.0–29.9, ≥30 kg/m2, 
respectively).
Other medical conditions were ascertained through the question “Has a doctor or other 
health professional told you that you had [disease]?” Disease types were examined and 
categorized as positive by self-report: hypertension, arthritis, cerebrovascular accident, 
chronic lower respiratory tract disease, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, liver

 disease, thyroid disease, cancer (other than skin), and diabetes mellitus (15). Chronic lower 
respiratory tract disease included self-reported emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or asthma; 
coronary heart disease included coronary artery disease, angina, or a myocardial infarction. 
Diabetes included participants who also were taking insulin and/or diabetic pills. The 
cumulative number of positive responses to the disease types was divided into four 
categories: 0, 1, 2, and ≥3. Depression was assessed using the validated Patient Health 
Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 yields scores from 0 to 27 and scores≥10 are used to 
define major depression (16).
Statistical methods
All estimates, standard errors, and association measures were derived using the sampling 
weights provided by the NCHS. These weights take into account unequal probabilities of 
selection resulting from the sample design, non-response, and planned over-sampling of 
specific racial and ethnic groups in the US population.
Appropriately weighted χ2 analysis and Pearson correlation coefficients according to gender 
were used to compare differences in those who reported anal intercourse and those who did 
not. Comparisons for those with and without FI have been published elsewhere (14). We 
used appropriate sample weighting for two-sample t-tests for testing differences in means. 
Survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis with step-wise backward 
elimination was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) estimates and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for variables associated with FI from a prior NHANES 
publication (14). The following variables associated with FI were included in the 
multivariable models: age, race/ethnicity, education, family income, body mass index, stool 
consistency, comorbidity count, and depression. P-values<0.05 were considered statistically 
significant (no adjustment for multiple testing). Statistical analyses were performed using 
STATA statistical soft ware version 12.0 (College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Of the 6,150 men and non-pregnant women aged 20 years or older from the NHANES 
2009–2010 cycle (Figure 1), 5,183 had data on FI. From the sexual behavior questionnaires, 
4,209 participants aged 20–69 years had data regarding anal intercourse. After exclusions for 
those who did not answer FI or sexual behavior questions, 2,100 men and 2,070 women had 
complete data and comprised the final analytic sample in the multivariable models.
Anal intercourse was higher among women (37.3%) than men (4.5%), P<0.001. Up to 42% 
of women and 6% of men affirmed a history of anal intercourse depending on the age group 
assessed (Table 1). Anal intercourse was reported more frequently among younger women 
(aged 20–49 years) with at least a high school education as well as women reporting 
symptoms of moderate-to-severe depression. Men reporting anal intercourse were more 
likely to have at least a high school education. Overall, FI prevalence was 8.3% (6.9–10.0%) 
for women and 5.6% (4.3–7.2%) for men. FI rates were higher among women (9.9 vs. 7.4%; 
P=0.05) and men (11.6 vs. 5.3%; P=0.03) reporting anal intercourse compared with those 
not reporting anal intercourse. For both genders, FISI scores were low and did not differ 
among those with or without a history of anal intercourse. As expected, FISI scores were

 higher among men and women with FI than without FI (men: 15.3 vs. 3.3, P<0.001; women: 
15.4 vs. 3.4, P<0.001). FISI scores were not higher in men or women (14.8 vs. 14.7, P=0.9) 
with FI who also reported anal intercourse.
After multivariable adjustment including other known FI clinical risk factors (Table 2), anal 
intercourse remained significantly associated with prevalent FI among both men and women. 
The adjusted odds of FI were higher in men reporting anal intercourse (OR: 2.8 (95% CI: 
1.6–5.0); P<0.001) than women (OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0–2.0)). A sensitivity analysis was 
performed to assess if the association changed among the group of men (n=69, 68%) who 
reported anal intercourse at least once in their lifetime (validation question only available for 
men). Men who confirmed anal intercourse at least once in their lifetime reported a higher 
prevalence of FI (12.0 vs. 5.4%; P=0.07) than men with no lifetime anal intercourse and the 
adjusted OR for anal intercourse and FI remained significant (OR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.02–4.6); 
P=0.04).
DISCUSSION
From a US population-based survey that involved private interviews with an audio-enabled 
computer-assisted questionnaire, women reported higher prevalence than men for anal 
intercourse (37 vs. 5%). Despite higher overall prevalence of anal intercourse in women, 
men reporting anal intercourse had a higher prevalence of FI than women (11.6 vs. 9.9%, 
P<0.001). After controlling for other known factors for FI in adults, anal intercourse was 
associated with an increased odds of having FI in both men and women. Better recognition 
of factors that may contribute to FI may open dialogue and improve discussion of two taboo 
topics in the healthcare setting: individual sexual practices and accidental bowel leakage 
(17).
In the lay press there is a common belief that anal intercourse is related to FI and other 
bowel symptoms, such as constipation; online forums on sexual practices and health often 
contain content regarding these associations (Websites accessed using the search terms, 
“anal intercourse” and “fecal incontinence” (http://www.salon.com/2011/12/30/
does_gay_sex_cause_incontinence/) and (http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/ate/
sexandrelationships/sex/200700.html)). Despite public concern, little work has examined 
anal intercourse as a possible risk factor for FI in the scientific community. Studies have 
mainly focused on the relationship between anorectal structure and function and anal 
intercourse among men with mixed results. Lower anal resting pressure has been noted 
among men who engaged in anal intercourse (5,6). However, studies have had inconsistent 
results regarding lower maximum squeeze pressures and the complaint of FI in men who 
practice anal intercourse (5,6). These studies had small numbers of men who had anal 
intercourse, 40 and 14—respectively. Data on the effects of anal intercourse on anorectal 
structure and function among women are lacking.
Biologic plausibility exists for anal intercourse as a risk factor for FI. The internal anal 
sphincter contributes to the majority of the anal resting pressure. Anal intercourse could 
dilate and eventually stretch the internal and external anal sphincters leading to damage of 
these structures, as demonstrated by the lower resting pressure. This lower pressure and

 possible damage to the internal and external anal sphincters could lead to FI via muscle 
atrophy and sensory deficits. Smaller clinical cohort studies have found than women with 
and without FI have lower anal pressures than men (18,19).
We did not see differences in the FISI scores among those with and without the self-report of 
anal intercourse. FI severity, as measured by the FISI scores, only measures the frequency of 
stool loss and the type of leakage (including flatus, mucus, liquid, or solid stool). FISI scores 
do not take into account fecal urgency or the conditions when FI occurs, such as passive 
leakage or urgency leakage. Anal intercourse may affect urgency or passive FI more than the 
type of leakage that occurs. In addition, anal intercourse may only have a small impact on 
fecal continence so that it lowers the threshold for occurrence without worsening severity. In 
addition, we were unable to quantify the frequency of anal intercourse in this population and 
it is possible that the majority of individuals rarely practice anal intercourse, which would 
have decreased the impact on FI severity. More data are needed to further test this 
hypothesis.
The strengths of this study include the population-based study design as well as a large 
sample size. Prior studies have been limited by gender and we were able to include both 
genders in this study. Finally, validated questions were used for both FI and stool 
consistency, which have been shown to be valid and reliable in the assessment of bowel 
symptoms. There are several limitations in this work. There are no validated questions for 
anal intercourse and we were unable to assess the frequency of anal intercourse among 
women. In addition, the definition utilized in this study for male anal intercourse is 
imperfect and limited to the questions asked in this NHANES cycle. We did, however, find 
concurrence between the two questions related to anal intercourse in 68% of our male 
population. A sensitivity analysis including only the 69 men who responded positively to 
both questions, revealed similar results. Although the definition of anal intercourse for men 
in this study may overestimate the number of men engaged in anal intercourse, studies have 
shown that men who report sex with men frequently report at least some experience with 
anal intercourse (20). In addition, other sexual practices that involve the rectum, such as 
“fisting” were not measured, and could impact the results of this current analysis. We could 
not distinguish between consensual anal intercourse and non-consensual anal intercourse in 
this cohort. Both men and women may be reluctant to divulge anal intercourse practices. We 
have previously found that women are more likely to respond positively to a written 
questionnaire than oral history taking with regard to FI; although the questions were 
administered in private, we do not know the concordance between oral and written history 
taking for anal intercourse (21).
When using cross-sectional data sets, such as NHANES, we are not able to prove causality 
between the outcome of interest (FI) and the exposure variables. We also did not adjust our 
analyses for multiple testing and all the potential confounding variables of the association 
between anal incontinence and FI may not have been queried in a broad study of health 
factors such as NHANES. Lastly, stool consistency assessment was only asked for the usual 
or most common type and may not represent the more episodic changes in stool consistency 
that may occur with FI episodes.

 These results provide initial epidemiologic evidence supporting a link between anal 
intercourse and FI among both men and women. These results provide evidence to inform 
discussions between patients and providers with regard to the association between FI and 
anal intercourse. Future studies evaluating multicomponent interventions to improve FI 
could consider counseling regarding the association of anal intercourse and FI as part of 
standard practice.

adults; with equal prevalence rates among older men and 
women.
•
Risk factors for fecal incontinence that are similar 
among women and men include comorbidity and loose 
stool consistency.
•
Decreased anal sphincter pressures may be related to 
anal intercourse in small clinical series data.
WHAT IS NEW HERE
•
Women and men who practice anal intercourse have 
higher rates of fecal incontinence.
•
Men who practiced anal intercourse had higher odds of 
having fecal incontinence than women.
•
Assessment of sexual behaviors may be important 
consideration among adults with fecal incontinence.
