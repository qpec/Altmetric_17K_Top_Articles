IMPORTANCE Clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of focused ultrasound (FUS)
thalamotomy in essential tremor, but its effectiveness and safety for managing
tremor-dominant Parkinson disease (TDPD) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To assess safety and efficacy at 12-month follow-up, accounting for placebo
response, of unilateral FUS thalamotomy for patients with TDPD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Of the 326 patients identified from an in-house
database, 53 patients consented to be screened. Twenty-six were ineligible, and 27 were
randomized (2:1) to FUS thalamotomy or a sham procedure at 2 centers from October18,
2012, to January 8, 2015. The most common reasons for disqualification were withdrawal (8
persons [31%]), and not being medication refractory (8 persons [31%]). Data were analyzed
using intention-to-treat analysis, and assessments were double-blinded through the primary
outcome.
INTERVENTIONS Twenty patients were randomized to unilateral FUS thalamotomy, and 7 to
sham procedure. The sham group was offered open-label treatment after unblinding.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The predefined primary outcomes were safety and
difference in improvement between groups at 3 months in the on-medication treated hand
tremor subscore from the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST). Secondary outcomes
included descriptive results of Unified Parkinson’
s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and
quality of life measures.
RESULTS Of the 27 patients, 26 (96%) were male and the median age was 67.8 years
(interquartile range [IQR], 62.1-73.8 years). On-medication median tremor scores improved
62% (IQR, 22%-79%) from a baseline of 17 points (IQR, 10.5-27.5) following FUS thalamotomy
and 22% (IQR, −11% to 29%) from a baseline of 23 points (IQR, 14.0-27.0) after sham
procedures; the between-group difference was significant (Wilcoxon P = .04). On-medication
median UPDRS motor scores improved 8 points (IQR, 0.5-11.0) from a baseline of 23 points
(IQR, 15.5-34.0) following FUS thalamotomy and 1 point (IQR, −5.0 to 9.0) from a baseline of
25 points (IQR, 15.0-33.0) after sham procedures. Early in the study, heating of the internal
capsule resulted in 2 cases (8%) of mild hemiparesis, which improved and prompted
monitoring of an additional axis during magnetic resonance thermometry. Other persistent
adverse events were orofacial paresthesia (4 events [20%]), finger paresthesia (1 event
[5%]), and ataxia (1 event [5%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Focused ultrasound thalamotomy for patients with TDPD
demonstrated improvements in medication-refractory tremor by CRST assessments, even in
the setting of a placebo response.

 T
remor is a cardinal motor feature of idiopathic Parkin-
son disease (PD) and occurs variably during its course.1
Tremor-dominant PD (TDPD) is a clinical subtype dis-
tinct from the akinesia/rigidity (AR) and postural instability/
gait disorder subtypes.2 Compared with those with other sub-
types, patients with TDPD may experience slower progression
of nonmotor symptoms of PD,3 but the tremor may be more
resistant to dopamine-replacement therapy than bradykine-
sia or rigidity. Although there are procedural risks with the po-
tential for adverse effects, especially with bilateral proce-
dures,deep-brainstimulation(DBS)andthalamiclesioningare
both effective invasive therapies for the treatment of motor
symptoms in essential tremor (ET) and PD.4-6

Methods
Overview
The study was designed as a prospective, sham-controlled ran-
domizedclinicaltrial(randomized2:1)withdouble-blindedas-
sessments through the 3-month primary end point analysis at
2 US academic medical centers (Figure 1). Patients assigned to
a sham procedure were offered open-label treatment after the
3-month blinded assessment. All treated patients were fol-
lowed unblinded to 1 year. Study oversight was provided by
InSightec(Haifa,Israel).Clinicaloversightwasprovidedbyone
of us (W.J.E., the principal investigator) and an independent
data safety monitoring board.
Computer randomization was performed by one of us
(A.W., study coordinator) and stored electronically. All pa-
tients presented on the day of their procedure and were pre-
pared identically with scalp shave, stereotactic frame place-
ment, MR imaging (MRI), and stereotactic planning. Before the
initiation of sonications, the treatment team was orally in-
formed of the randomization assignment by the study coor-
dinator. The patient and evaluators remained blinded to the
assignment until after the 3-month assessment.
Institutional review board approval of the study protocol
(available in Supplement 1) was obtained at both the Univer-
sity of Virginia, Charlottesville, and the Swedish Neurosci-
ence Institute, Seattle, Washington, under an investigational
device exemption granted by the FDA. All patients signed
informed consent prior to enrollment.
Patients
Adult patients with idiopathic TDPD were included if the
disease was deemed medication-refractory, severe, and
disabling.22 The diagnosis was confirmed using the UK Brain

Key Points
Questions How safe and efficacious is focused ultrasound
thalamotomy for managing medically refractory, tremor-dominant
Parkinson disease, and what is the magnitude of the placebo
response?
Findings In this 2-center, double-blind, sham-controlled, pilot
randomized clinical trial of 27 patients with tremor-dominant
Parkinson disease, on-medication Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor
A+B treated hand tremor subscores improved a median of 7 points
(62%) at 3 months following focused ultrasound thalamotomy and
2 points (22%) following sham procedures, a statistically
significant difference. Two cases of transient hemiparesis occurred
owing to unrecognized capsular heating.
Meaning This initial pilot investigation of focused ultrasound
thalamotomy suggests preliminary efficacy for the management of
medication-refractory, tremor-dominant Parkinson disease;
however, a substantial placebo response was observed.

Procedures
The procedure for performing an MR-guided FUS thala-
motomy has been described.17-19 The detailed steps of the pro-
cedure are available in eMethods 2 in Supplement 2. In brief,
patients were prepared with scalp shaving and application of
a stereotactic head frame under local anesthesia. The pa-
tients were positioned supine with a rubber scalp membrane
sealed to the midfrequency transducer (InSightec) that oper-
ates at 710 kHz with a 3-T MRI system (GE Healthcare).
Initial targeting for FUS thalamotomy was posterior to the
midcommissural point by 25% and lateral to midline by 14.0
to 14.5 mm. Therapeutic sonications were administered to the
target with incrementally increasing energy. Clinical monitor-
ing of the patient was obtained after each sonication. Tremor
was assessed in the resting and postural states as well as with
finger-to-nose and drawing tasks. Potential neurologic ad-
verse effects were monitored with sensory and motor test-
ing. Tremor suppression or neurologic signs and symptoms
were not typically observed until tissue temperatures ex-
ceeded 50°C, at which point the final target ablation was ad-
justed based on clinical feedback. The goal during treatment
was to achieve tremor suppression and an adequate thermal
dose to the target. An MRI was performed the following day,
after which the patient was discharged.
Patients who received sham treatment were randomized
after positioning and stereotactic planning and underwent all
stagesoftreatment,withthesonicationpowersettozerowatts.
Patients were clinically assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 12
months following treatment. Posttreatment MRI was per-
formed at postprocedure day 1, day 30, and 1 year.
Outcomes
All motor assessments were performed in the on-medication
state, after FDA review of the protocol, to establish the medi-
cation-refractory nature of the tremor. Follow-up assess-
ments were blinded at 1 month and 3 months and unblinded
at 1 year. The assessments were timed 1 hour after adminis-
tration of the patients’morning dose of PD medications after
at least 12 hours without medication.
The primary efficacy outcome was determined by compar-
ing the change from baseline to 3 months in the on-medication
treated upper-limb tremor subscore (Clinical Rating Scale for
Tremor[CRST]A+B)betweenFUSthalamotomyandshampro-
cedures using intention-to-treat analysis. The CRST A assesses
tremoratrest,posture,andintention;theCRSTBassessestasks
including handwriting (dominant hand only), wide and narrow
spiraldrawings,straightlines,andpouring.TheCRSTA+Btreated
handtremormaximumsubscoreis32pointswhenthedominant
hand is treated and 28 points when the nondominant hand is
treated. A higher score indicates more severe tremor.24
Primary safety outcome was assessed by monitoring the
incidenceandseverityoftheprocedure-relatedadverseevents
from the procedure through 1 year after treatment for all pa-
tients. Cognition and mood were monitored with comprehen-
sive neuropsychological assessments, including the Beck
Depression Inventory and Montreal Cognitive Assessment at
baseline, 3 months, and 12 months.
Predefined, secondary outcomes were also assessed in the
on-medication state and included the following: treated hand
tremor at rest (Unified Parkinson’
s Disease Rating Scale
[UPDRS] item 20), treated hand postural or action tremor
(UPDRS item 21), UPDRS III motor score (items 18-31), total
CRST, level of disability (CRST-C), and quality of life (39-item
Parkinson’
s Disease Questionnaire [PDQ-39]).
Statistical Analysis
This study was intended to be a pilot study to assess the safety
and potential efficacy of FUS thalamotomy in TDPD. A formal
power analysis was not performed before initiating the study
because we had no information regarding the variability and
effect size of the outcome measure. In conjunction with FDA
review, a sample size of 30 was planned, with 10 randomized
to a sham procedure. A sham procedure arm was imple-
mented to account for potential placebo response in PD.21
Baseline characteristics were compared between the 2
groups using the Fischer exact test for categorical variables,
and the exact Wilcoxon 2-sample test for continuous vari-
ables. Comparative statistics were used for the primary effi-
cacy outcome to gain more insight into the potential treat-
ment and placebo effects in this population. Descriptive
statistics were planned for the remainder of the analyses, as
this investigation was an early-stage pilot study in 27 pa-
tients.Fortheprimaryefficacyoutcome,thechangefrombase-
line in on-medication CRST A+B treated hand tremor sub-
score between the sham and treatment groups at 3 months, an
exact Wilcoxon 2-sample test was performed using intention-
to-treat analysis. For safety outcomes, a Fisher exact test was
usedtoassesswhethertherewasadifferenceinadverseevents
between the 2 treatment groups.
The statistical analysis was performed using SAS, version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) or R 3.4 (The R Foundation for Statisti-
calComputing).Two-sidedstatisticalsignificancelevelwasset
at P < .05. An independent data safety monitoring board re-
viewed adverse events and severe adverse events through-
out the trial.
Results
Twenty-seven patients were enrolled from October 18, 2012,
to January 8, 2015, with 20 patients randomized to FUS thala-
motomy and 7 patients to sham procedures (Figure 1). There
were 26 screening failures, most commonly due to patient
withdrawal (8 patients [31%]) and failure to prove medication-
refractory status (8 patients [31%]) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Twenty-six patients were male (96%), and the median age was
67.8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62.1-73.8 years). Base-
line characteristics between the treatment and sham groups
were not statistically different (Table 1).

in the on-medication state, improved 62% (IQR, 22%-79%)

 motomy and 22% (IQR, −11% to 29%) from a baseline of 23
points (IQR, 14-27) after sham procedures. The between-
group difference was significant (exact Wilcoxon 2-sample test
between groups, P = .04) (Figure 2 and Table 2).
Three-month improvements in the predefined second-
ary outcomes from FUS thalamotomy and sham procedures
are reported as descriptive results (Table 2). We observed im-
provements in all secondary-outcome CRST, UPDRS, and
PDQ-39 scores in the treatment group. Following sham pro-
cedures, there were lesser improvements in total CRST,
UPDRS motor (part III), total UPDRS, and PDQ-39 and no im-
provements in the UPDRS treated hand resting tremor (item
20) and postural or action tremor (item 21). Montreal Cogni-
tive Assessment and Beck Depression Inventory II score
changes were similar in both groups. Complete descriptive re-
sults from all assessments can be found in eTable 2 in
Supplement 2.
Adverse events are segregated into 2 categories: thala-
motomy-related (owing to the creation of a thalamic lesion)
and MRI/ultrasound-related (owing to the procedure environ-
ment) (Table 3 and eTable 3 in Supplement 2). There were no
statistical differences in the adverse events between the
blinded thalamotomy and the blinded sham procedure groups

 (Fisherexacttest:allP > .05).Themostcommonthalamotomy-
related adverse events for all 26 patients treated (blinded FUS
thalamotomy [20 patients] and open-label FUS thalamotomy
[6 patients]) were finger paresthesia (10 patients [39%]), ataxia
(9 patients [35%]), and orofacial paresthesia (7 patients [27%]).
Paresthesia persisted to 1 year in 19% of patients and ataxia,
in 4%. Headache (65%) and dizziness/vertigo (42%) were
common MRI/ultrasonography-related events, and these re-
solved by the completion of the procedure. Eight severe ad-
verse events were reported in 4 patients, and 3 were thala-
motomy-related.Twopatientshadpersistentmildhemiparesis
with gradual improvement almost to their baseline during the
study but exhibited tone asymmetries at last follow-up. One
of these patients also had an associated persistent mild ataxia.
Unrelated serious adverse events included cholecystitis, wors-
ening degenerative knee disease, and a transient ischemic
attack. One patient with a history of stable treated depres-
sion experienced worsening depressive symptoms that were
attributed to the discontinuation of his antidepressant medi-
cation within the first month following FUS thalamotomy.
Although this pilot study was initially designed for ran-
domization of 30 patients, slow enrollment limited the study
to 27 randomized patients. All the patients were available for
the primary analysis at 3 months. After unblinding, 6 of the 7
patients who received sham procedures crossed over to un-
dergoopen-labeltreatmentandtheotherpatientoptedforDBS
at a more local institution. Six of 20 patients in the treatment
group did not complete 1-year assessments. Two patients had
successful outcomes at 3 months but did not return for their
1-yearassessment(theiron-medicationCRSTA+Btreatedhand
tremor subscores were reduced from 28 to 0 and from 31 to 1).
One patient had a marginal improvement in tremor (30 to 27)
and sought treatment at another facility. Three patients had
inadequate improvement or worsening tremor scores (their
scores changed from 26 to 25, 27 to 29, and 11 to 7 from base-
line to 3 months), and underwent DBS (2 unilateral subtha-
lamic nucleus, 1 bilateral ventral intermediate) (Figure 1).
We performed a responder analysis and arbitrarily de-
fined a successful outcome as having a 50% reduction in the
on-medication CRST A+B treated hand tremor subscores from
baseline to 1 year. Of the 20 patients in the treatment arm, 14
patients were available for unblinded 1-year assessments. With
the use of intention-to-treat analysis with the last observa-
tion carried forward, 13 patients (65%) had a positive out-
come. According to a worst-case analysis that assumes that
treatment failed in all 6 patients not assessed at 1 year, 11 pa-
tients (55%) would have a successful outcome. Similar re-
sults were noted in the open-label crossover group (eTable 4
in Supplement 2).
Discussion
ThisrandomizedclinicaltrialofunilateralFUSthalamotomyfor
patients with TDPD, controlled with sham procedures and
double-blinded assessments, demonstrated a 62% median im-
provement in contralateral hand tremor CRST subscores in the
FUS thalamotomy group and 22% median improvement in the
sham group. The between-group difference, predefined as the
primary efficacy outcome, was similar to findings from a re-
cent randomized clinical trial of FUS thalamotomy for ET
(47%).20 This TDPD trial measured a placebo effect in the sham
group that was not present in the ET study20 but which is con-
sistent with observations from other sham surgery–controlled

 trials in PD in which improvements have been shown in UPDRS
assessments.21 As noted, this was a pilot study to assess safety
and feasibility and to obtain estimates of variability and effect
size of the outcome measures in a TDPD population. Because
comparative statistics were only planned for the primary out-
come variable, efficacy conclusions are not claimed.
The CRST, originally proposed as a scale for both ET and
Parkinson tremor, has been used for the evaluation of hyper-
kinetic disorders and in some DBS studies of PD.25,26 The CRST
has not been widely used in Parkinson disease because the
UPDRS is a multidomain assessment.27 We selected the CRST
as our primary outcome measure because the TDPD subtype
is primarily disabled by tremor, and the use of the CRST pro-
vides a good measure of the disability associated with tremor
in these patients.
The UPDRS motor subscore (part III) was used as a second-
ary outcome measure. For completeness, CRST and UPDRS are
reportedtomostfullyassessallclinicalaspectsofpatientswith
TDPD and their response to FUS thalamotomy. On-medication
median UPDRS motor scores improved 8 points following FUS
thalamotomy and 1 point after sham procedures. This differ-
ence between treatment and sham cohorts, although not sta-
tisticallyanalyzed,exceedstheminimalclinicallyimportantdif-
ference of 2.5 for the UPDRS motor scores.28 Furthermore,
median UPDRS tremor scores (items 20 and 21) improved fol-
lowing the treatment but not following sham procedures.
ThemostcommonadverseeffectsoftheFUSthalamotomy
procedure were finger paresthesia, ataxia, and orofacial pares-
thesia. Most of these effects were mild or transient, but persis-
tentparesthesiaandataxiaoccurredin19%and4%,respectively.

implementedfrequenttemperaturemeasurementsinorthogo-
nal planes during the procedure to mitigate the risk for heating
outside of the MR thermometry plane.
As an early-stage pilot study, this trial was conducted in a
rigorous fashion as a double-blind randomized clinical trial.
The control arm involved sham procedures to assess for pla-
cebo responses. The cohorts were well matched, with no sig-
nificant differences in their demographic or baseline charac-
teristics. All patients were available for the primary analysis.
Neuropsychologicalassessmentsconfirmedthattherewereno
significant changes in mental status, global cognitive abili-
ties, or depression from the FUS thalamotomy procedure.

dural treatment in patients with PD owing to its demonstrated

sequent internal globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus DBS if
additional symptoms develop with disease progression. There
may be cases for which DBS may not be a preferred option. As a
therapy dependent on implanted devices, DBS has some issues

The rationale for targeting the thalamus in PD initially with
this technology is intended to build on our initial experience
with successfully lesioning this structure for ET.17 We believe
that the ventral intermediate thalamus is the safest target to
manage PD tremor compared with the internal globus palli-
dusorthesubthalamicnucleus.ThefutureapplicabilityofFUS
thalamotomyinthepopulationofpatientswithPDislikelylim-
ited to a well-selected subset of patients in whom unilateral
tremor reduction is sufficient to improve quality of life. This
can include patients in whom bradykinesia, rigidity, or gait
dysfunction due to PD is well controlled with dopamine-
replacement therapy but medication-refractory tremor re-
mains problematic, or in patients with advanced PD and co-
morbidmedicalconditionsinwhompalliativetremorreduction
and avoidance of general anesthesia is indicated.
Limitations
The trial was limited by small size, and the planned study en-
rollment of 30 patients was not reached. Medication dose was
not fixed during the trial, potentially confounding the re-
sults. The trial was not designed to compare FUS thala-
motomy with other treatments, such as DBS or gamma knife
radiosurgery.
Conclusions
Preliminary results from this randomized clinical trial on the
efficacy of unilateral FUS thalamotomy for the treatment of
patients with TDPD are encouraging. A notable placebo re-
sponse was observed with sham procedures, necessitating a
larger study to prove efficacy. Adverse events were similar to
those of other thalamotomy procedures and will likely fur-
ther improve as the technology for monitoring the FUS thala-
motomy procedure improves.
