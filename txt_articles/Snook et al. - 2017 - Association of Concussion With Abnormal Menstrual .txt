IMPORTANCE Brain injury may interrupt menstrual patterns by altering
hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function. Investigators have yet to evaluate the
association of concussion with menstrual patterns in young women.
OBJECTIVE To compare abnormal menstrual patterns in adolescent and young women after a
sport-related concussion with those after sport-related orthopedic injuries to areas other
than the head (nonhead).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study of adolescent and young
women with a sport-related concussion (n = 68) or a nonhead sport-related orthopedic injury
(n = 61) followed up participants for 120 days after injury. Patients aged 12 to 21 years who
presented within 30 days after a sport-related injury to a concussion or sports medicine clinic
at a single academic center were eligible. Menstrual patterns were assessed using a weekly
text message link to an online survey inquiring about bleeding episodes each week. The first
patient was enrolled on October 14, 2014, and follow-up was completed on January 24, 2016.
Inclusion criteria required participants to be at least 2 years postmenarche, to report regular
menses in the previous year, and to report no use of hormonal contraception.
EXPOSURES Sport-related concussion or nonhead sport-related orthopedic injury.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Abnormal menstrual patterns were defined by an
intermenstrual interval of less than 21 days (short) or more than 35 days (long) or a bleeding
duration of less than 3 days or more than 7 days.
RESULTS A total of 1784 survey responses were completed of the 1888 text messages
received by patients, yielding 487 menstrual patterns in 128 patients (mean [SD] age, 16.2
[2.0] years). Of the 68 patients who had a concussion, 16 (23.5%) experienced 2 or more
abnormal menstrual patterns during the study period compared with 3 of 60 patients (5%)
who had an orthopedic injury. Despite similar gynecologic age, body mass index, and type of
sports participation between groups, the risk of 2 or more abnormal menstrual bleeding
patterns after injury was significantly higher among patients with concussion than among
those with an orthopedic injury (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.61-21.22).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescent and young women may have increased risk of
multiple abnormal menstrual patterns after concussion. Because abnormal menstrual
patterns can have important health implications, monitoring menstrual patterns after
concussion may be warranted in this population. Additional research is needed to elucidate
the relationship between long-term consequences of concussion and the function of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

oncussion is the most common type of brain injury and
is particularly prevalent in sports and recreational ac-
tivities.Recentestimatessuggestthatasmanyas1.9mil-
lion children younger than 18 years have a sport- or recreation-
related concussion each year in the United States.1 This injury

cussionsexdifferencesarepoorlyunderstoodbuthavebeenat-

In girls, functional disruption of the neuroendocrine hy-
pothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, which governs the
menstrual cycle, could lead to dysregulation of the men-
strual cycle as reflected by irregular bleeding patterns. In fact,
development of neuroendocrine disorders related to hypopi-
tuitarism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is well estab-
lished, with most evidence in adult men.18-20 By contrast, a
single case report21 has been published on the effect of TBI on
menstrual patterns in young women that involved an adoles-
cent who presented with amenorrhea after a severe TBI and
was found to have traumatic disruption of the pituitary infun-
dibulum. Two small retrospective studies conducted in adult
women22,23 reported a high incidence of amenorrhea and oli-
gomenorrhea after moderate and severe TBI, with the sever-
ity of injury predicting the degree of menstrual dysfunction.
To date, researchers have yet to examine the role of concus-
sion on menstrual patterns in adolescent and young women
(hereinafter referred to as young women).
Early identification and management of menstrual irregu-
larities among young women is important because menstrual
irregularities such as amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea can be
associated with hypoestrogenism and decreased bone min-
eral density,24,25 which may not be recoverable over time.26 If
concussion contributes to menstrual irregularities in young
womenviadisruptionoftheHPOaxis,assessingmenstrualsta-
tus in the early postconcussive state could help clinicians iden-
tify individuals with abnormal menses and initiate or refer
them for appropriate management. Although the American
Academy of Pediatrics27,28 and American College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynecologists29 advocate for clinicians to regard the
menstrual cycle as a vital sign in adolescents because of
the importance of estrogen in bone health and other tissues,
theassessmentofmenstrualstatusisneitherastandardofcare
nor routine practice after a concussion.
The aim of the present study was to perform a prospec-
tive comparison of menstrual patterns in young women with
sport-related concussion and those with sport-related ortho-
pedic injuries in areas other than the head (nonhead). The lat-
ter was chosen as a control group to attribute any differences
inoutcometoconcussionspecificallyratherthaninjuryingen-
eral, because injury and removal from sport and/or school are
stressful events and psychological and physical stress are
known to affect menstrual cyclicity.30-32 We hypothesized that
young women with concussion would be more likely to have
abnormal menstrual bleeding patterns after their injuries than
would those with sport-related orthopedic injuries.
Methods
Study Participants and Eligibility
Female patients aged 12 to 21 years presenting to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Concussion Clinic or
CenterforSportsMedicine,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,forevalu-
ation of a closed head injury or nonhead orthopedic injury that
occurred during a sport- or recreation-related activity (catego-
rized as aesthetic, endurance, or other sport types33,34 in the
preceding 30 days were eligible for the study. Patients re-
ceived compensation to participate in the study ($10 at enroll-
ment and $20 at completion). A single board-certified obste-
trician gynecologist (M.L.S.) performed all participant
screening, consenting, and enrollment procedures. The insti-
tutional review board of the University of Pittsburgh ap-
proved the study design and consent forms before data col-
lection.Allpatientsyoungerthan18yearsprovidedassent,and
their parents provided written informed consent. Patients 18
years and older provided written informed consent.
Clinical confirmation of a concussion was made using a
neurologic examination and evaluation with confirmatory fol-
low-up assessments of balance, cognitive, vestibular, and ocu-
lomotor impairment. Concussion was defined based on guide-
linesfromtheCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention35and
the Fourth International Consensus Statement on Concus-
sion in Sport.36 According to these criteria, a concussion was
defined as any mild (ie, Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥13) closed
head injury involving altered cognitive functions (eg, confu-
sion, memory loss, or disorientation), signs or symptoms (eg,
headache,dizziness,balanceproblems,ornausea),orbriefloss
of consciousness lasting no more than 1 minute after a direct
or indirect blow to the head. Patients with head injuries in-
volving any structural damage or abnormality (eg, skull frac-
ture,subduralhematoma)basedonabnormalfindingsoncom-
puted tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans, if
performed, were excluded.
Inclusion criteria required each patient to be at least 2
years postmenarche and to report regular menses in the
Key Points
Question Is concussion associated with the development of
abnormal menstrual bleeding patterns in young women?
Findings In this cohort study of 129 adolescent and young women
with a sport- or recreation-related concussion or nonhead
orthopedic injury who were followed up for 120 days after their
injuries, the risk of having 2 or more abnormal menstrual bleeding
patterns after injury was significantly higher among patients with
concussion.
Meaning Menstrual patterns should be monitored after
concussion.

 previous year. This postmenarche point was chosen because
irregular bleeding patterns are common immediately after
menarche as the HPO axis is maturing, whereas 70% to 90%
of girls will develop regular menses within 2 years.37-39
Regular menses was defined by self-reported monthly men-
strual cycles with 11 to 12 menstrual cycles in the preceding
year. Inclusion criteria also required patients to be English
speaking and have access to a smartphone to receive text
messages. Patients were excluded from participation if they
had any known condition that may affect menstrual func-
tion, including subjective report of pregnancy; any use of
hormonal contraception in the preceding 6 months; a hypo-
thalamic or pituitary disorder; a brain tumor; an endocrine
disorder that may cause menstrual dysfunction (eg, thyroid
disease, hyperandrogenemia); a diagnosis of delayed or pre-
cocious puberty, anxiety, depression, eating disorder, or epi-
lepsy; or history of a severe TBI.
Study Design
At the time of enrollment, each patient’
s height and weight
wererecordedusingadigitalcolumnweightscale(SECAmodel
769; SECA), which included a height-measuring rod (SECA
model 220). Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire
that inquired about demographic characteristics, such as self-
identified race, injury history, menstrual and sexual history,
and a preferred and reliable mobile telephone number to re-
ceive text messages.
Patients received an automated, weekly text message con-
taining a link to an online Qualtrics survey (https://www
.qualtrics.com).TextmessagesweresenteverySundayevening
usingEZtexting.com(SMSMarketing).Theonlinesurveyasked
patients whether in the last week they (1) experienced any
bleeding episodes and if so, the day bleeding began and the
duration; (2) experienced any new injury for which medical
attention was received and if so, to classify the injury type; (3)
started or continued to use any hormonal contraception; and
(4) were or could be pregnant. After enrollment, patients
received weekly text messages to 120 days after injury (range,
90-120 days). The rationale for assessing bleeding patterns for
120 days after injury was to allow for capture of approximately
3 to 4 menstrual cycles for each patient—a time frame in which
amenorrhea, if identified (intermenstrual interval, >90 days),
would typically prompt clinical evaluation.40
If a patient did not complete a survey after 3 weeks, the
primary investigator (M.L.S.) contacted her and inquired about
her desire to continue with the study. If the patient wished to
continue, she was asked to verbally respond to the questions
in the survey for all weeks missed. Patients were also con-
tacted when submitted surveys were incomplete or sug-
gested they no longer met eligibility criteria (eg, the patient
used hormonal contraceptives or believed that she was preg-
nant). For patients who started using hormonal contracep-
tives (n = 2), individual data were included in the analysis un-
til the week before they met exclusion criteria. For the 1 patient
who became pregnant at the end of follow-up, data were in-
cluded until approximately 4 weeks before the confirmed con-
ception date. Menstrual diaries were then prospectively cre-
ated for each patient based on her baseline questionnaire
menstrual history (which included the start date and dura-
tion of the last sure menstrual period) and each weekly sur-
vey response.
Outcome Variable
The primary outcome of interest was the development of an
abnormal postinjury menstrual pattern, as defined by an in-
termenstrualintervaloflessthan21days(short)orgreaterthan
35 days (long) or a bleeding duration of less than 3 days or
greater than 7 days. These criteria were chosen because 70%
to90%ofbleedingpatternsinadolescentsarewithinthisrange
for longer than 2 years after menarche, and approximately 95%
of cycles will have bleeding durations of 3 to 7 days.37-39 Be-
cause having 1 abnormal menstrual pattern could be consid-
ered to be normal variation,38,39 we considered having 2 or
more abnormal patterns within the relatively short study pe-
riod (120 days, with an expected 3-4 menstrual cycles) to be
indicative of dysfunction.
Statistical Analyses
Sample size was determined by assuming 20% to 25% preva-
lence of menstrual irregularities in high school athletes.33,41-43
A priori power analysis indicated that recruitment of 59 pa-
tients with concussion and 59 patients with nonhead ortho-
pedicinjurieswouldprovide80%powertodetecta50%preva-
lence of menstrual irregularities among patients with
concussion. Recruitment was initially set at 75 patients in each
group based on a dropout rate of 20%; however, retention
proved to be unexpectedly high, and therefore enrollment was
halted with 68 patients in the concussion group and 61 in the
orthopedic injury group.
Descriptive statistics (means, SDs, and frequencies) were
used to define the total patient population and compare the
injurygroupsondemographicandinjury-relatedfactors.Com-
parisons were made between groups using 2-tailed indepen-
dent t tests (continuous) or χ2 tests (categorical). Subsequent
χ2 analyses with odds ratios and 95% CIs were performed to
compare the likelihood and risk of abnormal bleeding pat-
terns after injury in both groups. Statistical significance was
considered to be P < .05. Analyses were performed using SPSS
software, version 22.0 (IBM).
Results
Study Participants and Survey Response
From October 14, 2014, through September 29, 2015, a total
of 792 patients aged 12 to 21 years who presented consecu-
tively for evaluation of an injury underwent screening for eli-
gibility (Figure). A total of 309 patients (39%) fit eligibility cri-
teria, but 180 of these (58.3%) were not included in the study
because they did not meet 1 or more inclusion criterion, met
an exclusion criterion, or declined participation. The remain-
ing 129 patients (mean [SD] age, 16.2 [2.0] years) were en-
rolled in the study, with 68 (52.7%) having had concussion and
61 (47.3%) having had an orthopedic injury. Eight of 61 ortho-
pedic injuries (13.1%) were characterized as bone or stress frac-
tures; 41 (67.2%), muscle or ligament strains or tears; and 12

 (19.7%), other injuries. Study retention was high, with 1 pa-
tient being excluded during the study period, 3 patients with
fewer than 120 days of follow-up, and no voluntary withdraw-
als. All data from 1 patient in the orthopedic injury group were
excluded when she disclosed that she inaccurately recorded
bleeding episodes from study enrollment. In the concussion
group, 1 patient became pregnant after 10 weeks and 2 initi-
atedoralcontraception(oneat7weeksandanotherat16weeks
after concussion).
The weekly survey response rate was 94.5% (1784 survey
responses of 1888 text messages received by patients) across
all weeks, yielding a total of 487 bleeding patterns recorded
in 128 patients. Eighty-three of all 487 menstrual patterns were
considered to be abnormal, with a prolonged intermenstrual
interval being the most common type of abnormality re-
ported (64 of 83 [77.1%]).
Baseline Characteristics
Comparisons of baseline and injury characteristics between
groups are presented in Table 1. Patients in the concussion
group were statistically younger than those in the orthopedic
injury group (mean [SD] age. 15.7 [1.8] vs 16.6 [20] years;
P = .01), but gynecologic age (an indicator of HPO axis matu-
rity, calculated as result of age of menarche subtracted from
current age) was not statistically different (mean [SD], 3.9 [1.9]
vs 4.1 [1.8]; P = .49). A higher proportion of patients with con-
cussion had a prior concussion (29 of 68 [42.6%]) compared
withthosewithanorthopedicinjury(10of61[16.4%];P = .001).
Theconcussionandorthopedicinjurygroupsweresimilarwith
regard to body mass index, race/ethnicity, sport, and time from
injury to enrollment. We found no statistical difference in
demographic variables between patients who developed 2 or
more abnormal menstrual patterns during the study interval
and those who maintained regular menses or had 1 abnormal
pattern (Table 2).
Comparison of Menstrual Patterns After Injury
Patients reported 2 to 6 bleeding patterns after injury. Fifty-
seven of 128 patients (44.5%) had at least 1 abnormal bleed-
ing pattern during the study period, with no difference be-
tween injury groups. Of the 68 patients who had a concussion,
16 (23.5%) experienced 2 or more abnormal bleeding patterns
during the study period compared with 3 of 60 patients (5%)
who had orthopedic injuries. Patients with a concussion had
increased risk of having 2 or more abnormal menstrual bleed-
ing patterns after injury compared with those with an ortho-
pedic injury (5.58; 95% CI, 1.61-21.22) (Table 3). Among pa-
tients with concussion, we found no statistical difference
between those who developed 2 or more abnormal men-
strual patterns and those who did not in terms of presence of

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to prospectively char-
acterizeabnormalmenstrualpatternsafterconcussioninyoung
women. Our results demonstrate that young women have sig-
nificantly increased risk of multiple abnormal menstrual pat-
terns after concussion compared with orthopedic injury. The
present findings extend previous research on TBI to concus-
sion because head injury can affect and alter menstrual cycles.
Traumatic brain injury contributing to the development
of abnormal menstrual patterns has been reported.22,23,44 In
a letter to the editor, Cytowic et al44 first reported lack of men-
ses for 1 to 6 months in 11 of 84 women who sustained mild to
moderate head injury after motor vehicle crashes. In a retro-
spective survey of 30 adult women with TBI in the preceding
1 to 3 years, Ripley et al23 reported a median duration of amen-
orrheaof61days,and90%ofwomenskippedmenstrualcycles.
The severity of TBI, determined by Glasgow Coma Scale score
and posttraumatic amnesia, predicted the duration of amen-
orrhea. Similarly, Colantonio et al22 performed a retrospec-
tive survey of 104 women 5 to 12 years after TBI and com-
pared results with those of a matched control group. Those
authors reported that 46% of patients experienced amenor-
rhea and 68% developed irregular cycles after TBI vs 8% and
27% of controls, respectively, during the same period. Amen-
orrhea was significantly associated with lower Glasgow Coma
Scale scores, higher Injury Severity index score, and longer
acute hospital stay.
Although our study found significantly increased risk of
multiple abnormal menstrual cycles after concussion com-
pared with orthopedic injury, none of the patients developed
amenorrhea. Discrepancy may hinge on prospective vs retro-
spective study designs, with associated biases and injury type
and severity.
Thepresentfindingssuggestthatmoresubtleformsofbrain
injury,suchasconcussion,mayadverselyaffectHPOaxisfunc-
tion and therefore menstrual cycles through a number of pro-
posedmechanismsleadingtodisruptedgonadotropinsecretion.
These mechanisms may include transient ischemic damage to
the hypothalamus, infundibulum, and/or pituitary gland20,45;
acutehyperprolactinema18,31;andactivationofthehypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenalaxis31owingtothestressresponseofaninjury.
Concussions are known to be associated with emotional
responses,46includingdepressionandanxiety,thatmayfurther
exacerbate a psychological stress response.
With these circumstances, the downstream conse-
quences in young women include inadequate stimulation of
the ovarian follicles and less than optimal estrogen produc-
tion. Estrogen is especially important in young women to

 stimulate the development of secondary sexual characteris-
tics and is critical for building bone mass, because peak bone
mineral density is attained in late adolescence47 and may not
be recoverable over time.26 Specifically, women who devel-
oped menstrual irregularity at younger than 20 years were al-
most 3 times more likely to have bone mineral density below
normalfortheiragecomparedwiththosewhodevelopedmen-
strual irregularity at older than 20 years.48
Based on the present findings and as an extension of
the recommendations from the American Academy of Pedi-
atrics 27,28 and American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists,29 we believe that clinicians treating patients
with concussion should inquire about menstrual patterns to
identify those patients who may develop abnormal menses.
Early identification of menstrual abnormalities and appropri-
ate referral for further evaluation and treatment may im-
prove potential health concerns in adulthood.29
Limitations
We recognize limitations to the present study, including that
subjective report of a regular menstrual pattern does not
confirm the quality of that menstrual cycle, that is, whether
ovulation is occurring and/or whether ovarian estrogen pro-
duction is appropriate. Given the present study design and
population, we relied on self-reported menstrual history
before enrollment and chose weekly surveys to minimize
error in patient recall of bleeding patterns. Obtaining serial
biological specimens for hormonal assays was not feasible.
Therefore, weekly self-reported menstrual bleeding pat-
terns during the 120 days after injury served as a proxy for
normal and abnormal HPO axis function. We did not assess
long-term menstrual status to determine any effects of con-
cussion on more chronic end points, such as bone health.
Because of the strict inclusion criteria for this study, results
may not be applicable to prepubescent girls, individuals

 who are within the first 2 years of menarche, those with
preexisting abnormal menstrual cycles, or those previously
diagnosed with anxiety or depression. Perhaps the imma-
ture HPO axis, or one not functioning appropriately or
under significant baseline psychological stress, is more sus-
ceptible to the metabolic and psychological effects of con-
cussion. Along those lines, we do not have empirical mea-
surements of anxiety, mood, or psychological stress
between groups. We were also unable to account for the sea-
sonal or training effect of the patients, because a change in
training intensity could also affect menstrual patterns and
disturbances.49 Moving forward, researchers should expand
the present study by including a noninjured control group
of young women playing sports.
Conclusions
The present findings suggest that young women have in-
creased risk for multiple abnormal menstrual patterns after
concussion compared with orthopedic injury. We recom-
mend monitoring menstrual patterns after concussion. In so
doing, patients with abnormal menstrual patterns could be
identified and subsequently referred for appropriate evalua-
tion and possible treatment. Larger studies with hormonal as-
sessments and long-term follow-up are needed to better un-
derstandtheeffectofconcussionontheHPOaxisandpotential
implications for menstrual patterns, estrogen production, and
any persistent consequences.
