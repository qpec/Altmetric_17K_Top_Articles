The global tuberculosis epidemic and progress in care, 
prevention, and research: an overview in year 3 of the 
End TB era
Katherine Floyd, Philippe Glaziou, Alimuddin Zumla, Mario Raviglione
Tuberculosis is the number one cause of death from infectious disease globally and drug-resistant forms of the disease 
are a major risk to global health security. On the occasion of World Tuberculosis Day (March 24, 2018), we provide an 
up-to-date review of the status of the tuberculosis epidemic, recommended diagnostics, drug treatments and vaccines, 
progress in delivery of care and prevention, progress in research and development, and actions needed to accelerate 
progress. This Review is presented in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO’s End TB 
Strategy, which share the aim of ending the global tuberculosis epidemic. In 2016, globally there were an estimated 
10·4 million new cases of tuberculosis, and 600 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin (the most powerful first-
line drug). All countries and age groups are affected by tuberculosis, but most cases (90%) in 2016 were in adults, and 
almost two-thirds were accounted for by seven countries: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, South Africa, 
and Nigeria. The sex ratio (male to female) was 1·9 and 10% of patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis were also 
HIV-positive. There were 1·7 million deaths from tuberculosis in 2016, including 0·4 million deaths among people 
co-infected with HIV (officially classified as deaths caused by HIV
/AIDS). Progress in care and prevention means that 
the global mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 people per year) is decreasing by 3·4% per year and incidence (new cases 
per 100 000 people per year) is decreasing by 1·9% per year. From 2000 to 2016, the annual global number of 
tuberculosis deaths decreased by 24% and the mortality rate declined by 37%. Worldwide, an estimated 53 million 
deaths were averted through successful treatment. Nonetheless, major gaps in care and prevention remain. For 
example, the 6·3 million new cases of tuberculosis reported globally in 2016 represented only 61% of the estimated 
incidence; only one in five of the estimated number of people with drug-resistant tuberculosis was enrolled in 
treatment. Pipelines for new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines are progressing, but slowly. Actions needed to accelerate 
progress towards global milestones and targets for reductions in the burden of tuberculosis disease set for 2020, 2025, 
2030, and 2035 include closing coverage gaps in testing, reporting of cases, and overall access to health care, especially 
in countries that account for the largest share of the global gap; multisectoral efforts to reduce prevalence of major 
risk factors for infection and disease; and increased investment in research and development.
Introduction
Every year, World Tuberculosis Day marks the announce­
ment by Dr Robert Koch on March 24, 1882, that he had 
identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the cause of the 
disease.1 At that time, cause of death data from national 
vital registration systems in European countries and 
Japan show tuberculosis mortality rates of more than 
100 per 100 000 people per year. With no drug treatment 
available, about 70% of people with sputum smear­
positive pulmonary tuberculosis could be expected to die 
within 10 years, and about 40% of people with all clinical 
forms of tuberculosis disease could be expected to die 
overall.2 Studies of human skeletons show that tuber­
culosis has affected humans for thousands of years.3
A slow decline in tuberculosis incidence and mortality 
started around the turn of the twentieth century; from 
the 1940s the combination of social and economic 
development and discovery, development, and use of 
effective drug treatments resulted in rapid declines in the 
number of cases and deaths in western Europe, Japan, 
North America, and other parts of the world,4,5 to the 
extent that tuberculosis is often regarded as a disease of 
the past. However, for many countries this idea has 
remained a distant reality. Tuberculosis was declared a 
global health emergency by WHO in 19936 and despite 
major progress in subsequent years and the fact that 
tuberculosis can usually be cured with the right treatment 
regimen, in the second decade of the 21st century this 
disease remains the top cause of death from an infectious 
disease globally.7 Intensified national and global efforts 
are needed to reduce this burden and achieve the 
ambitious global targets and milestones set for 2016–35.
In November, 2017, WHO and the Government of 
Russia hosted the first global ministerial conference on 
tuberculosis,8 which will be followed by the first session 
for heads of state to discuss tuberculosis at the UN 
General Assembly in September, 2018.8 Almost exactly 
halfway between these two unprecedented events and on 
the occasion of World Tuberculosis Day 2018, this article 
provides an up­to­date review of global strategy and 
targets for tuberculosis, the status of the epidemic, 
recommended 
diagnostics, 
drug 
treatments 
and 
vaccines, progress in delivery of care and prevention, 
progress in research and development, and actions 
needed to accelerate progress towards the goal of ending 
the global tuberculosis epidemic.
Our Review draws extensively on the 2017 edition of 
WHO’s global tuberculosis report,7 complemented by 
information from other publications and documents 
from the global ministerial conference, and follows

Global End TB Strategy and Sustainable 
Development Goal targets
From 2000 to 2015, national and global efforts to reduce 
the burden of tuberculosis were focused on achieving 
targets set within the context of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). Established by the UN in 
2000, MDG target 6C was to halt and reverse tuberculosis 
incidence (defined as the number of new cases per 
100 000 population per year).11 The Stop TB Partnership 
set two additional targets—to reduce tuberculosis 
prevalence and mortality by 50% by 2015, compared with 
numbers in 1990. The global tuberculosis strategies 
recommended by WHO between 2000 and 2015 were the 
DOTS strategy (until 2005), followed by the Stop TB 
Strategy (2006–15), which had the overall goal of reaching 
all three targets.12 WHO’s assessment of whether the 2015 
tuberculosis targets were achieved at global, regional, and 
country levels was published in October, 2015.13
In 2016, the MDGs were succeeded by the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were adopted by 
the UN in September, 2015, and cover the period 2016–30.14 
WHO developed a post­2015 global tuberculosis strategy 
between 2012 and 2014—the End TB Strategy—which was 
endorsed by all WHO Member States in 2014 and applies 
for the period 2016–35.15,16
The aim of both the SDGs and the End TB Strategy is to 
end the global tuberculosis epidemic. This is expressed as 
the goal of the End TB Strategy, and is part of Target 3.3 in 
the SDGs, which also includes ending the epidemics of 
HIV, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases.17 The 
tuberculosis indicator for Target 3.3 is incidence per 
100 000 population per year. Tuberculosis is also part of an 
indicator that will be used to assess progress towards the 
SDG target of achieving universal health coverage 
(Target 3.8). The WHO and World Bank definition of 
universal health coverage is that all people receive the 
health services they need, while ensuring that use of these 
services does not expose the user to financial hardship.18 
An indicator for Target 3.8 is the coverage of 16 essential 
prevention, treatment, and care interventions, one of 
which is tuberculosis treatment.
The End TB Strategy includes quantitative targets 
(for 2030 and 2035) and milestones (for 2020 and 2025) 
for three high­level indicators (table 1). These indicators 
are tuberculosis incidence (new cases per 100 000 people 
per year), the number of tuberculosis deaths, and the 
percentage of tuberculosis patients and their households 
that face catastrophic costs due to the disease. For 2030, 
the targets are to reduce the annual number of tuberculosis 
deaths by 90% and to reduce tuberculosis incidence 
by 80%, compared with 2015. For the third indicator, a 
milestone of zero households facing catastrophic costs 
due to tuberculosis is set for 2020, to be sustained 
thereafter. The trajectories of tuberculosis incidence and 
numbers of deaths required to achieve the milestones and 
targets are shown in figure 1.
To achieve the 2020 and 2025 milestones, the global rate 
of decline in tuberculosis incidence must accelerate from 
1·5% per year (in 2015) to 4–5% per year by 2020 (similar 
to what is being achieved in some high tuberculosis 
burden countries),7 and to 10% per year by 2025 
(emulating the fastest national declines of the past).4,5 The 
proportion of people with tuberculosis who die from 
disease must be reduced from 17% (in 2015) to 10% 
by 2020, and to 6·5% by 2025 (comparable to numbers in 
high­income countries).7 Such reductions require pro­
vision of diagnostic and treatment services within the 
context of broader progress towards universal health 
coverage, so that all those in need can access care by 2025, 
and multisectoral efforts to reduce prevalence of major 
Key messages
• 
Tuberculosis is one of the top causes of ill-health and death worldwide and the leading 
cause of death from an infectious disease. The UN Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) and WHO’s End TB Strategy include ambitious global targets for enormous 
reductions in this burden, including a 90% reduction in deaths and an 80% reduction 
in incidence between 2015 and 2030.
• 
The latest WHO estimates show important global progress between 2000 and 2016: 
the number of deaths fell 24%, the mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 people per year) 
declined by 37%, incidence (new cases per 100 000 people per year) decreased at an 
average rate of 1·4% per year, and 53 million deaths were averted through successful 
treatment.
• 
The pipelines for new diagnostics, drugs, treatment regimens, and vaccines are 
progressing, but slowly. Several new diagnostics have emerged from the research 
pipeline in recent years, and 17 drugs, several new treatment regimens, and 12 vaccine 
candidates are in clinical trials.
• 
The pace of progress is not fast enough to reach the SDG and End TB Strategy targets 
and intensified efforts are needed at national and global levels. Gaps in testing of 
tuberculosis cases for HIV and drug susceptibility, reporting of detected cases to 
national authorities, and overall access to health care must be closed, broader 
underlying social and economic determinants of infection and disease should be 
addressed, and investments in research and development increased.
• 
Commitments made in the Declaration from the Global Ministerial Conference on 
Tuberculosis in November, 2017, and the upcoming United Nations General Assembly 
(UNGA) high-level meeting on tuberculosis in New York in September, 2018, provide 
hope that the intensified efforts required to put countries (and the world) on the path 
to achieving the targets set for 2030 can be galvanised.

risk factors for infection and disease, including poverty, 
undernutrition, housing quality, HIV infection, diabetes, 
and smoking. Achieving the targets set for 2030 and 2035 
depends on technological breakthroughs by 2025, such as 
the development of a vaccine capable of preventing 
disease in adults so that incidence can decline at much 
faster rates (on average, 17% per year) in the period 
2025–35. These requirements provide the rationale for 
the three pillars of the End TB Strategy: integrated, 
patient­centred tuber 
culosis care and prev 
ention, bold 
policies and supportive systems (including universal 
health coverage, social protection, and action on deter­
minants), and intensified research and innovation.16
Status of the tuberculosis epidemic
Tuberculosis incidence and deaths
Global estimates of tuberculosis incidence and the 
number of tuberculosis deaths in the period 2000–16 are 
shown in figure 2. In 2016, there were an estimated 
10·4 million (95% uncertainty interval 8·8–12·2 million) 
new (incident) cases, a number that has been relatively 
stable since 2000. Of these, 1 million (10%) were 
HIV­positive. Relative to the population, the number of 
incident cases (per 100 000 people per year) has been 
falling slowly, by 1·4% per year in 2000−16 and 1·9% in 
2015–16. The number of tuberculosis deaths has also 
been falling, from a best estimate of 1·7 million in 2000 
to 1·3 million in 2016 among people who were HIV­
negative (a reduction of 24%), and from 0·5 million to 
0·4 million among people who were HIV­positive 
(officially, these deaths are classified as caused by 
HIV/AIDS).19 Between 2015 and 2016, the tuberculosis 
mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 people per year) among 
people who were HIV­negative decreased by 3·4% per 
year (4% when deaths among people who were HIV­
positive were included), and decreased by 37% between 
2000 and 2016.
Regionally, the fastest declines in tuberculosis incidence 
were in the WHO European region (4·6% from 
2015 to 2016). Since 2010, reductions of at least 4% per 
year are estimated to have occurred in several countries 
with a high burden of tuberculosis, including Ethiopia, 
Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Russia, Tanzania, Zambia, and 
Zimbabwe. From 2010 to 2016, the fastest declines in 
mortality were in the European (6% per year) and western 
Pacific (4·6% per year) regions.
Tuberculosis is found in every country in the world, but 
18 countries had more than 100 000 new cases in 2016 
(figure 3). Of these, seven accounted for 64% of the 
global total: India (27%), Indonesia (10%), China (9%), 
Philippines (5%), Pakistan (5%), South Africa (4%), and 
Nigeria (4%). Three WHO regions accounted for 87% of 
cases: southeast Asia (45%), Africa (25%), and the western 
Pacific (17%). The European region and the Americas 
each accounted for 3% of the total, with the remaining 7% 
in the eastern Mediterranean region. Of the estimated 
1 million new tuberculosis cases among people who were 
HIV­positive in 2016, 74% were in the African region. 
The number of incident cases relative to population size 
varied widely, from less than 10 per 100 000 people 
in most high­income countries to more than 500 per 
100 000 in Kiribati, Lesotho, Mozambique, North Korea, 
Philippines, and South Africa (figure 3). Tuberculosis 
affects men, women, and children in all age groups 
(figure 4), but most cases are in adults (90%) and in men 
(65%).
Although the number of deaths due to tuberculosis is 
declining globally (figure 2), it remains one of the 
top ten causes of death worldwide (figure 5). In 2015, the 
last year for which WHO has published estimates for all 
causes of death, tuberculosis ranked as the ninth cause of 
death worldwide. From 2012 to 2016, it was the number 
one cause of death from a single infectious agent, ranking 
above HIV
/AIDS. In 2016, about 82% of tuberculosis 
deaths among people who were HIV­negative were in the 
WHO regions of Africa and southeast Asia, as were 85% 
of the combined total of deaths among people who were 
HIV­negative and people who were HIV­positive. India 
alone accounted for 33% of global tuberculosis deaths 
among people who were HIV­negative, and for 26% of the 
combined total deaths in HIV­negative and HIV­positive 
people.

The proportion of people with tuberculosis who die 
from the disease (approximated as the estimated 
numbers of deaths in a given year divided by the 
estimated number of incident cases in the same year) 
was 16% globally in 2016. However, this number varied

in 2016, an estimated 4·1% of newly infected patients and 
19% of previously treated patients had rifampicin­resistant 
tuberculosis and thus required treatment with second­
line drugs. Worldwide, an estimated 600 000 people 
developed rifampicin­resistant tuberculosis in 2016; this 
number included 490 000 (82%) people with multidrug­
resistant tuberculosis (ie, resistance to at least rifampicin 
and isoniazid). 45 countries had at least 1000 incident 
cases of rifampicin­resistant tuberculosis in 2016 
(figure 7), and three countries accounted for almost half of 
the global total: India (25%), China (12%), and Russia 
(10%).
Improvements in data
Tracking the tuberculosis epidemic in terms of numbers 
of cases and deaths is best done using data from national 
systems for notification of diseases and vital registration 
that meet quality and coverage standards.20 Periodic 
surveys of tuberculosis prevalence and mortality provide 
an interim solution for directly measuring the burden of 
disease. The WHO Global Task Force on TB Impact 
Measurement has provided guidance and support 
on these topics since 2006, with strategic areas of work 
focused on strengthening routine surveillance in all 
countries and periodic surveys of prevalence of disease in 
a specific subset of countries, as well as regular review of 
the data and analytical methods used to produce estimates 
of disease burden.7,21
There is some way to go before all countries have robust 
surveillance systems or repeat survey data, but there 
has been considerable progress in recent years.7,22 In 2016, 
WHO 
estimates 
of 
tuberculosis 
incidence 
were 
based on direct measurements from national surveys 
of tuber 
cu 
losis prevalence for 24 countries that 
accounted for 68% of the global burden, and on routine 
notification data (with a standard adjustment to allow for 
under­reporting and underdiagnosis) for 134 countries 
with 15% of the global burden. During 2007–16, 
25 national prevalence surveys (13 in Asia and 12 in Africa) 
were completed using methods recommended by WHO,23 
compared with only a handful of such surveys in the 
previous decade (all of which were in Asia). In 2016, WHO 
estimates of tuberculosis deaths were based on national 
vital registration, with coding of cause of death, for 
129 countries that collectively accounted for 57% of 
estimated tuberculosis deaths (for 18 countries, WHO 
used estimates produced by the Institute of Health 
Metrics and Evaluation [IHME]). Data on drug resistance

were available for 160 countries (based on routine 
diagnostic testing in 90 countries and nationally 
representative survey data from 70 countries) that 
accounted for more than 99% of tuberculosis cases 
globally. About 200 countries report case notification data 
to WHO each year, with close to 100% of global 
notifications disag 
gregated by age and sex since 2013 (up 
from less than 50% in 2005).
Further required improvements include closing gaps in 
notification of detected cases (these gaps might be 
especially large in countries in which many tuberculosis 
patients seek care in the private sector or in public 
hospitals that are not linked to the reporting systems of 
national tuberculosis programmes), systematic and rep­
resentative audits of data quality, and establishment or 
strengthening of national vital registration systems with 
coding of causes of death according to international 
standards.
With continued improvements to the availability and 
quality of data, estimates of the burden of tuberculosis 
disease will also improve, and those published by WHO 
should converge with estimates produced by other 
agencies. To date, the other entity publishing estimates of 
the burden of tuberculosis is IHME, as part of the Global 
Burden of Disease project.24 Globally, estimates for 2016 
are very similar; IHME estimated there were 1·2 million 
tuberculosis deaths among people who were HIV­negative 
in 2016 (compared with the WHO estimate of 1·3 million), 
and the incidence estimates were the same (10·4 million). 
General consistency exists for mortality estimates in 
countries with vital registration systems and good quality 
standard coding of causes of death, and in incidence 
estimates in countries with strong health­care and noti­
fication systems. Discrepancies are most apparent for 
countries in which the underlying data are weaker because 
of differences in the indirect estimation methods used.
Latent tuberculosis infection
Estimates of latent tuberculosis infection burden were 
recently updated.25 Globally, 23% (uncertainty interval 
20–26) of the world’s population was estimated to be 
infected with M tuberculosis in 2014, equivalent to 
1·7 billion people.25 Of these, 80% were in the WHO 
regions of southeast Asia, the western Pacific, and Africa. 
The lifetime risk of developing disease if infected is 
5–15%.26 In high burden settings, recent transmission 
probably accounts for most new cases of tuberculosis 
disease. By contrast, in some low burden countries, 
reactivation of previous infections can account for about 
80% of new cases of disease.27
Currently recommended diagnostics, 
treatments, and vaccines for tuberculosis
The main diagnostic tests for tuberculosis are rapid 
molecular assays, sputum smear microscopy (developed 
more than 100 years ago), and culture­based methods. 
A few other tests using novel technologies have been 
approved by WHO for use in specific patient groups or 
settings, including lateral flow lipoarabinomannan 
antigen detection (for people with HIV who have very low 
CD4 cell counts) and microscopic observation drug 
susceptibility testing. The only rapid molecular test 
recommended by WHO that can simultaneously test for 
tuberculosis (with much better accuracy than smear

This assay was first recommended by WHO in 2010 
for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults;28 
in 2013, the recommendation was widened to include 
children and testing for some forms of extrapulmonary 
tuber 
culosis.29 Culture­based methods are the reference 
standard, but these require more sophisticated lab 
oratory 
capacity and can take up to 3 months to obtain results.7
In addition to Xpert MTB/RIF, tests for drug­resistant 
tuberculosis recommended by WHO include rapid line 
probe assays that test for resistance to first­line drugs 
(rifampicin and isoniazid),30 a rapid line probe assay that 
tests for resistance to second­line drugs (fluoro

and injectables),31 and sequencing tech 
nologies. Despite 
advances in diagnostics, culture­based methods are still 
the reference standard for drug susceptibility testing.7
The recommended treatment for drug­susceptible 
tuberculosis is a 6 month combination regimen of four 
first­line drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and 
pyrazinamide.32 The Global Drug Facility supplies a 
complete 6 month course for about US$40 per person. 
Since 2000, the treatment success rates reported to WHO 
show a global mean of 80–86%.7 For people with HIV 
who are not already on antiretroviral therapy, WHO 
recommends initiation of antiretroviral drugs within 
2–8 weeks (depending on CD4 count) of starting 
tuberculosis treatment.
Drug regimens to treat rifampicin­resistant and 
multidrug­resistant tuberculosis are longer and require 
more expensive and toxic second­line drugs. Before 2016, 
the regimens recommended by WHO typically lasted for 
20 months and cost $2000–$5000 per person. Since 2016, 
a shorter (9–12 months), standardised regimen has been 
recommended for patients (other than pregnant women) 
with pulmonary tuberculosis that is rifampicin­resistant 
or multidrug­resistant, provided there is no resistance to 
second­line drugs.30,33 Drug susceptibility testing is 
necessary to establish if these criteria are met. The 
shortened regimen consists of seven drugs (kanamycin, 
moxifloxacin, protionamide, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, 
plus high­dose ethambutol and high­dose isoniazid) and 
costs about $1000 per person. Clinical trials show cure 
rates of 80% can be achieved for drug­resistant 
tuberculosis using this shortened regimen,34 but 
programmatic data generally show much worse out­
comes because of high rates of loss to follow­up, 
unevaluated treatment outcomes, and treatment failure.7
Drug regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis 
infection include isoniazid once daily for 6 or 9 months, 
isoniazid plus rifampicin once daily for 3–4 months, 
rifampicin once daily for 3–4 months, and isoniazid plus 
rifapentine once a week for 3 months.35–37 WHO guidance 
defines two priority risk groups in all countries: people 
with HIV who do not have active tuberculosis (but who 
are at much higher risk of developing it compared with 
people who are HIV­negative), and children aged 
under 5 years who are household contacts of people with 
bacteriologically­confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis.35
The BCG vaccine is the only licensed vaccine available 
for prevention of tuberculosis. First used in the 1920s, 
it is mostly effective in preventing severe forms of 
tuberculosis in infants and young children. Evidence for 
BCG protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in older 
children and adults is more variable, ranging from 0 to 
80%.38 Although the HIV status of most infants is 
unknown at birth, and routine BCG administration 
continues in many countries, BCG should not be used in 
children who are HIV­positive.39,40
Progress in care and prevention service delivery
Increased diagnosis, reporting, and treatment
Global progress in diagnosis and treatment of 
tuberculosis, drug­resistant tuberculosis, and HIV­
associated tuberculosis is shown in figures 2, 8, and 9. In 
2016, 6·3 million new cases of tuberculosis were reported 
(up from 6·1 million in 2015), equivalent to 61% of the 
estimated incidence of 10·4 million. Most of the global 
increase in tuberculosis notifications since 2013 was due 
to a 37% increase in reporting in India during 2013–16. 
In 2016, 476 774 cases of tuberculosis among people who 
were HIV­positive were reported, equivalent to 46% of 
the estimated incidence. Of these cases, 85% were on 
antiretroviral therapy. In 2016, 129 689 people were 
started on treatment for drug­resistant tuberculosis,

Review
Making large inroads into the gaps between the 
estimated burden and the actual number of cases detected 
and treated requires major progress in a small subset of 
countries (figure 10). In 2016, 76% of the total global gap 
between tuberculosis incidence and reported cases was 
accounted for by ten countries—the top three were 
India (25%), Indonesia (16%), and Nigeria (8%). In the 
same year, ten countries accounted for 75% of the global 
gap between estimated incidence and enrolment in 
treatment for drug­resistant tuberculosis; India and China 
accounted for 39% of this gap. The African region 
accounted for most of the gaps related to detection and 
treatment of tuberculosis in people who were HIV­
positive. Actions required to close these gaps are discussed 
further below.
Treatment outcomes
Between 2000 and 2015, 56 million people were 
documented as notified cases with successful treatment 
outcomes, with the annual number reaching 5 million in 
2015. Tuberculosis treatment (combined with anti­
retroviral therapy for people with HIV) is estimated to 
have averted 53 million deaths in 2000–16. According to 
the latest data reported to WHO in 2017, the treatment 
success rate globally was 83% for new cases registered 
in 2015 (78% for those co­infected with HIV) and 54% 
for people enrolled in treatment for drug­resistant 
tuberculosis (rifampicin­resistant or multidrug­resistant) 
in 2014 (30% for those with extensively drug­resistant 
tuberculosis).
Tuberculosis prevention services
Provision of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection 
has improved in recent years, especially in the 
two priority risk groups (ie, people who are HIV­
positive without active tuberculosis, and children aged 
less than 5 years who are household contacts of people 
with bac 
teriologically­confirmed pulmonary tuber­
culosis). The number of HIV­positive people who were 
newly enrolled in HIV care and started on treatment 
for latent tuberculosis infection was almost 1 million 
across 60 countries in 2016, up from negligible 
numbers in 2006. South Africa accounted for the 
largest share of the total (41%) in 2016, as in previous 
years, followed by Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and 
Malawi. Data on the number of children aged under 
5 years who were started on treatment for latent 
tuberculosis infection have only been compiled by 
WHO since 2016, but show an increase of 85% between 
2015 and 2016 (from 87 242 to 161 740).7 Despite this 
progress, major gaps in prevention services remain. Of 
the 30 countries with high tuberculosis and HIV 
burden, 18 did not report any provision of treatment for 
latent tuberculosis infection in 2016 to people who 
were HIV­positive and in the 12 countries that did, 
coverage ranged from 2·4% in Indonesia to 73% in 
Zimbabwe. The number of children who were treated

Progress in research and development
A comprehensive review of research on tuberculosis was 
recently published by WHO,41 with a focus on the period 
since 2005. This review showed that between 2009 and 
2016 a total of $4·6 billion was invested into tuberculosis 
research, mostly for development of new diagnostics, 
drugs, and vaccines (61%). The remaining money was 
allocated to basic research (21%), operational research 
(10%), and infrastructure or unspecified projects (8%). 
Most funding was from a few regions, led by the USA 
($1·8 billion), followed by the European Union and UK 
($269 million each). Contributions from other countries 
were less than $62 million each. The leading recipients 
of funding were product development partnerships, 
agencies, and universities in the USA; other recipients in 
the top 15 were the UK Medical Research Council, FIND 
(Geneva, Switzerland), University of Cape Town 
(Cape Town, South Africa), the International Union 
Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (Paris, France), 
and the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis 
(Chennai, India). In 2015, the total investment in 
tuberculosis research was 0·25% of global expenditures 
on medical research.42
The pipelines as of August, 2017, for new diagnostics, 
drugs, treatment regimens, and vaccines are shown in 
panels 1 and 2, and table 2.43–46 Overall, pipelines are 
progressing, but slowly. Various diagnostic tech­
nologies are in development and evaluation of 
GeneXpert Omni, a platform for rapid molecular 
testing close to the point of care, is expected in 2018. 
There are 17 drugs in phase 1, 2, or 3 trials, including 
eight new compounds (delpazolid, GSK­3036556, 
OPC­167832, PBTZ169, pretomanid, Q203, SQ109, and 
sutezolid), two drugs that have received accelerated or 
conditional regulatory approval based on phase 2b 
results (bedaquiline and delamanid), and seven re­
purposed drugs (clofazimine, linezolid, levofloxacin, 
moxifloxacin, nitazoxanide, rifampicin [high dose], and 
rifapentine). Various new combination regimens are in 
phase 2 or phase 3 trials. 12 vaccine candidates are in 
clinical trials, with three in phase 1 and nine in phase 2 
or phase 3.
In addition to trials related to new diagnostics, drugs, 
and vaccines, topics being investigated in clinical trials 
include treatment for latent tuberculosis infection among 
migrants in the UK, the long­term sequelae of pulmonary 
tuberculosis in four African countries, use of a high 
protein supplement to treat wasting due to tuberculosis 
in Guinea­Bissau, use of biomarkers to predict treatment 
duration, specificity of screening in diagnostics in people 
who are HIV­positive, diagnostic accuracy of platforms 
for breath­based testing for tuberculosis, and the effect of 
enhanced glycaemic monitoring on treatment outcomes 
for tuberculosis patients with diabetes (table 3).
Topics covered by investment in operational research 
included treatment access and delivery, public and 
private collaboration, how to address the joint epidemics 
of tuberculosis and HIV, community par 
ticipation, 
infection control, and measurement of disease burden.

research and development in the context of the SDGs and 
the End TB Strategy is provided elsewhere.41,47

Review
Actions needed to accelerate progress
Closing coverage gaps in testing for HIV and drug 
susceptibility
Insufficient coverage of testing for HIV infection and 
drug susceptibility in people already diagnosed with 
tuberculosis is part of the reason for gaps in detection and 
treatment of HIV­associated and drug­resistant tuber­
culosis (figures 8, 9). In 2016, global coverage of testing 
for rifampicin resistance was 33% for people with newly 
diagnosed tuberculosis and 60% for those previously 
treated (41% overall). This low coverage  explains why 
most of the estimated 350 000 cases of drug­resistant 
tuberculosis among notified cases went undetected 
in 2016. Figures for testing and documentation of HIV 
status were better—57% globally and 82% in the African 
region, in which the burden of HIV­associated 
tuberculosis is highest—but were still short of what is 
needed.

forms) and reported cases (figure 2), both under­reporting 
and underdiagnosis of all forms of tuberculosis must 
be addressed.
Under­reporting could explain a large part of the gap 
between incidence and notification, especially in countries 
with large private sectors or where public hospitals are 
detecting large numbers of tuberculosis cases, but not 
reporting them (figure 10). India and Indonesia are good 
examples, and studies suggest that as much as half of 
detected cases might go unreported to national authorities 
in these countries.7 Studies to quantify the amount of 
under­reporting of detected tuberculosis cases are 
underway in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam and are 
planned in Mongolia, South Africa, and a few European 
countries.7
Underdiagnosis is either due to failure to detect disease 
in people that do present for care at health facilities, or 
because of people with tuberculosis not seeking care, for 
example because of geographical or financial barriers. 
Data from recent national tuberculosis prevalence surveys 
show that many patients identified by these surveys had 
previously sought care, and that there were also people 
who reported symptoms and had relatively advanced 
disease (based on chest x­ray results) who had not sought 
care. In Nigeria, recommendations from the national 
tuberculosis prevalence survey included strengthening 
basic dia 
gnostic and treatment services.48 National 
prevalence 
surveys 
are 
currently 
underway 
in 
Mozambique, 
Myanmar, 
Namibia, 
South 
Africa, 
Swaziland, and Vietnam.
From a global perspective, closing detection and treat­
ment gaps in certain countries will have the biggest effect 
on reducing incidence and mortality from tuberculosis 
(figure 10). Identifying the main reasons for these gaps, 
and addressing them through actions included in national 
strategic plans (for tuberculosis specifically and the health 
sector as a whole), is required in these and other countries.
Increased and sustained financing for health service 
delivery
Addressing gaps in detection, reporting, and treatment 
requires increased and sustained financing, both for

Review
tuberculosis­specific interventions and to enable progress 
towards universal health coverage.
Financing for tuberculosis prevention and care has been 
increasing for more than 10 years, mostly from domestic 
sources, reaching an estimated $6·9 billion in low­
income and middle­income countries in 2017
.7 However, 
this number was $2·3 billion short of the estimated 
$9·2 billion required in 2017, and was much less than the 
$12 billion estimated to be required in 2020.49
WHO has monitored funding for tuberculosis since 
2002 and specific studies of resource needs and potential 
sources of funding have also been done. These studies 
have consistently shown that most of the funding required 
for tuberculosis care and prevention could be mobilised 
domestically in middle­income countries (84% of global 
cases in 2017), whereas international donor funding of 
around $2 billion per year (compared with the $1 billion 
provided in 2017) is required to support low­income 
countries and some middle­income countries that are 
making the financial transition from mixed sources of 
funding (domestic and donor) to full domestic funding.49,50 
For example, in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South 
Africa, 95% of funding for tuberculosis in 2017 was from 
domestic sources, whereas international donors accounted 
for 56% of funding for tuberculosis in low­income 
countries. India is an example of the potential for increased 
domestic commitments in middle­income countries given 
a favourable political context.7 In 2017, the Indian national 
government announced substantial increases in domestic 
funding for tuberculosis, following com 
mitment from the 
Prime Minister to a strategic plan with the goal of ending 
the country’s tuberculosis epidemic by 2025.
A much broader 2017 analysis51 compared estimates of 
the resources required to expand health services towards 
universal health coverage and achieve other SDG health 
targets in low­income and middle­income countries, with 
projections of total health expenditures in the same 
countries. In most middle­income countries, total health 
expenditures projected for the period 2016–30 exceeded 
the funding needed, but in low­income countries they fell 
far short.51
Growth in total health expenditure is necessary but not 
sufficient to achieve universal health coverage. Financing 
for health care needs to be generated via pooling of 
contributions across the population, using mechanisms 
such as insurance or taxation, otherwise excessive 
financial burdens will be faced by those in need. 
Although some countries with a high burden of 
tuberculosis are building or expanding insurance 
systems that include tuberculosis in the benefit package 
(eg, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam), in most 
countries there is a long way to go. Out­of­pocket 
expenditures on health care account for more than 30% 
of total health expenditures in most countries with a 
high burden of tuberculosis, and the first surveys of costs 
faced by tuberculosis patients and their households 
implemented since the launch of the End TB Strategy 
are revealing a high financial and economic burden.7
Greater attention to underlying determinants of 
tuberculosis infection and disease
Reducing gaps in service delivery should substantially 
reduce the overall number of tuberculosis deaths, both by 
reducing deaths among people who develop tuberculosis 
and by reducing the period during which people are 
infectious and can transmit the disease, thereby having 
an effect on incidence. However, in the absence of a new 
vaccine or equivalent drug treatment that is effective at 
preventing new cases in adults, history shows that 
accelerating 
reductions 
in 
tuberculosis 
incidence 
requires addressing the broader, underlying determinants 
of infection and disease.
WHO has developed a tuberculosis SDG monitoring 
framework (panel 3) that identifies 14 indicators for which 
there is evidence of an association with tuberculosis 
incidence, linked to seven of the SDGs.52–55 The latest 
status of a selection of these indicators for WHO’s list of 
30 high tuberculosis burden countries is shown in 
figure 11. Many countries have major challenges ahead to 
address determinants such as poverty, undernutrition, 
HIV infection, and smoking (particularly among men). 
Search strategy and selection criteria
We extracted most of the information used in this review from the WHO Global Tuberculosis 
Report 2017. This report is largely based on WHO’s global tuberculosis database, which is 
managed by the Global TB Programme and contains data from annual rounds of data 
collection implemented from 1995 to 2017. Around 200 countries that account for over 
99% of the world’s population and tuberculosis cases report data each year. Data from 
global databases maintained by other WHO departments, UNAIDS, and the World Bank 
were also used. The report’s chapter on research and development was based on recent 
publications, particularly those by Unitaid and Treatment Action Group, and 
communications with staff at the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development and the 
secretariats of the Stop TB Partnership’s working groups on diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. 
The production of the Global Tuberculosis Report 2017 was led by KF. The estimates of 
tuberculosis disease burden published in the report were primarily produced by PG.
We used our existing knowledge of publications about tuberculosis and supplemented this 
with a specific search and review of the latest (published between Jan 1, 2016, and 
Jan 1, 2018) publications in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and abstracts 
through PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase, and websites of tuberculosis 
related international organisations (WHO, Stop TB Partnership, Treatment Action Group, TB 
Alliance, National Institutes of Health—National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
and The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership [EDCTP]). We used 
the search terms “tuberculosis” and “Mycobacterium tuberculosis”, combined with each of the 
terms “review”, “epidemiology”, “prevalence”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, and “prevention”. 
We reviewed studies cited by articles identified in this search strategy and selected those 
that were relevant. Some review articles are cited to provide readers with more detail and 
references than this paper can accommodate.
The Review was also informed by the authors’ participation in the preparations for, and 
outcomes of, a Global Ministerial Conference on tuberculosis held in Moscow in 
November, 2017, and at the 2nd meeting of the WHO Global Task Force on TB Research held 
in Geneva in February, 2018.

Review
Globally, of the 10·4 million incident cases of tuberculosis 
in 2016, an estimated 1·9 million were attributable to 
undernutrition, 1·0 million to HIV infection, 0·8 million 
to smoking, and 0·8 million to diabetes.7
Increased investment in research and development
Achieving the 2030 targets set in the SDGs and WHO’s 
End TB Strategy will only be possible if the rate of 
reduction in tuberculosis incidence accelerates from 
2025 onwards beyond anything achieved at national level 
in the past. A new vaccine or equivalent treatment that 
will substantially lower the probability of latent 
tuberculosis infection developing into active disease 
among the almost 2 billion people already infected is 
needed by 2025. For there to be any chance of such a 
breakthrough, increased investment in research and 
development is essential. Recent data show that just over 
$0·7 billion was invested in research in 2016,56 compared 
with an annual requirement estimated at $2 billion per 
year,49 which itself might be too conservative.
Multisectoral accountability framework
Since acceleration of progress requires action across the 
health sector and beyond, the declaration adopted at 
the WHO Global Ministerial Conference held in 
November, 2017, calls for the development of a multi­
sectoral accountability framework. Such a framework can 
be used to galvanise and sustain political commitment 
and activity based on a regular cycle of monitoring, review, 
and action, including review at the highest political levels 
nationally and globally (eg, as in the unified accountability 
framework that has been developed for women’s, 
children’s, and adolescents’ health).57 Development of a 
draft version of an accountability framework for 
tuberculosis is anticipated in 2018, in advance of the UN 
General Assemnly high­level meeting on tuberculosis 
scheduled for September, 2018.
Conclusion
Despite usually being curable, tuberculosis remains one 
of the leading causes of death, and is the infectious 
disease that causes the most deaths worldwide. The 
burden of ill­health and death due to tuberculosis has 
decreased in recent decades, but progress in care and 
prevention must substantially accelerate in the next few 
years if there is to be any chance of reaching the 
ambitious targets of the SDGs and the End TB Strategy. 
This acceleration will require closing detection, report­
ing, and treatment gaps in the context of overall progress 
towards universal health coverage, actions to address 
the broader, underlying determinants of tuberculosis 
infection and disease (such as poverty, undernutrition, 
smoking, HIV infection, and diabetes), and much larger 
investments in research and development.
Commitments made in the Declaration from the WHO 
Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Tuberculosis 
in the Sustainable Development Era that was held 
in November, 2017, and the UN General Assembly 
high­level meeting on tuberculosis scheduled for 
September, 2018,8,58 provide hope that the efforts required 
to put countries and the world on the path to ending the 
tuberculosis epidemic can be galvanised.
