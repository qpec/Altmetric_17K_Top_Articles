INTRODUCTION
A
rating
of
perceived
exertion
(RPE) scale is a tool used to
monitor the perceptual response
to training, which has been well estab-
lished as a method of determining
exertion during exercise (21). The orig-
inal RPE scale was developed by
Gunnar Borg over 40 years ago (5)
and has been primarily used to monitor
aerobic exercise. The original scale
rated exertion from 6–20 to roughly
match heart rate, and therefore its
application to resistance training may

 have been limited. Its creation was fol-
lowed shortly by the development of
Borg’s category (C) ratio (R) scale.
The Borg CR10 Scale was the first
scale to provide exertion ratings from
1 to 10, and it was followed by the
creation of a visually aided 1–10
RPE scale known as the OMNI scale
(14). However, more recently RPE has
been used through these 3 aforemen-
tioned scales to gauge effort during
resistance
training
(29).
Although
there are slight differences in the
nomenclature and numerical ranges
of these scales, all have been deter-
mined valid methods of quantifying
perceived exertion (14).
There are different ways to use RPE
scores in resistance training. Scores
can be obtained from the lifter after
each exercise or group of exercises,
or
alternatively
using
the
session
RPE method, whereby 30 minutes
after a session is completed an RPE
score for the entire training bout is
obtained (15). Session RPE can be
used to prescribe intensity for an
entire training session or to monitor
the global response to training over
time to make adjustments to a period-
ization plan (9). However, if a strength
and conditioning practitioner wishes
to prescribe intensity using RPE on
a set-to-set basis, the traditional RPE
scale has limitations. Arguably the
most important limitation is that less
than maximal RPE scores are often
reported even when
the maximal
number of repetitions are performed
at a given load (19,33,42).
In fact, Hackett et al. (2012) explored
this limitation by measuring both the
estimated
repetitions
remaining,
actual repetitions remaining, and the
RPE in bodybuilders performing the
bench press and squat. To do so, the
researchers had the participants per-
form 5 repeated sets at 70% of one
repetition maximum (1RM) for 10
repetitions (or to failure if 10 repeti-
tions could not be completed) with
5 minutes rest between sets. At full
extension in both the squat (standing
at full extension) and bench press
(arms extended with elbows locked),
on completion of the 10th repetition
of each set, participants verbalized
either how many more repetitions
they believed they could perform
before reaching failure or a 1–10
RPE score (whether remaining repe-
titions or RPE was reported was
randomized). Then, while receiving
verbal encouragement from spotters
they continued the set to muscular
failure to determine actual repetitions
remaining.
Hackett et al. discovered that not only
did participants report RPE ratings that
fell short of maximal (less than 10) even
when sets were taken to volitional fail-
ure (no further repetitions could be per-
formed), but that the participants had
a high degree of accuracy in estimating
their number of repetitions remaining
on a set. The actual and estimated num-
ber of repetitions performed by the
lifters were highly related for both the
bench press (r 5 0.95) and squat (r 5
0.93). In addition, with each subsequent
set the participants were able to more
accurately gauge the number of repeti-
tions
remaining.
Meaning,
that
as
fatigue mounted from previous sets
and the closer to failure a set was taken,
the more accurate the estimation of rep-
etitions remaining became (19). How-
ever, a disconnect remained as Hackett
et al. (2012) had athletes use two differ-
ent scales to assess RPE and repetitions
remaining, thus it may be more appro-
priate to present 1 scale to athletes for
feasibility and ease of use.
For this reason, Zourdos et al. recently
investigated the use of a 1–10 scale in-
which
RPE
value
corresponds
to
a number of repetitions in reserve
(RIR) (i.e., 10 RPE 5 1 RIR; 9
RPE 5 2 RIR, and so forth) in experi-
enced (those who had .1 year experi-
ence
performing
the
barbell
back
squat) and novice (those who had ,1
year
experience)
squatters
(48).
Because Hackett et al. (2012) found
athletes’ estimates of repetitions re-
maining were more accurate when
a set was closer to failure, this scale
was developed using RIR descriptors
for scores of 5–10 and descriptors of
perceived effort to describe scores from
1 to 4. In addition, scores of 5–6 were
grouped as 4–6 RIR as it is easier for
athletes to give a range of RIR when
RIR is greater than 3. Zourdos et al.
also
found
substantial
differences
between novice and experienced squat-
ters which have important implications
for the use of this scale. The scale intro-
duced by Zourdos et al. can be seen in
Table 1. It must be noted that although
Zourdos et al. have introduced an RIR-
based scale into the scientific literature,
a scale of this type was originally
created in “The Reactive Training Sys-
tems Manual” in 2008 to be used in
powerlifting-type training (45). Based
on these recent studies, it seems that
a scale based on RIR has a number of
potential
applications
in
resistance
training, which this review will examine.

 BENEFITS OF USING A
REPETITIONS IN RESERVE–BASED
SCALE FOR PRESCRIBING
INTENSITY
Although it may be a more accurate
method
of
determining
near-limit
loads for resistance training compared
with the traditional RPE scales (19),
the RIR-based scale also shares many
of the beneficial traits associated with
traditional RPE. There is inherent var-
iation in human performance because
of normal biological and psychological
variability and factors such as sleep (6),
nutrition (23), and life stress (4) all may
affect strength during training or dur-
ing testing. In addition, rates of prog-
ress and recovery are highly individual
(16,44). Methods of determining inten-
sity such as percentage of 1RM and
RM are based on a previous perfor-
mance that may not be representative
of an athlete’s current status. 1RM is
not stable in novice populations (36)
and can be suppressed by fatigue from
previous
training
mesocycles
(28).
Thus, if a 1RM or RM test happens
to be reflective of an abnormal perfor-
mance, positive or negative, subse-
quent training loads would be lighter
or heavier than intended. Likewise,
even if a test does accurately reflect
current strength, subsequent percent-
age 1RM loading does not account
for day-to-day fluctuations in perfor-
mance. Also, despite the common use
of tables showing “repetitions allowed”
at different percentages of 1RM in
professional texts (3), there are inter-
individual variations in how many rep-
etitions can be performed at the same
percentage of 1RM (35). To conclude,
the RIR-based scale not only shares the
benefit of putting all individuals on
a “level playing field” that traditional
RPE enjoys but also has the unique
advantage of being more valid than
traditional RPE for sets performed
with near-limit loading (19).
If a practitioner decides to use an RIR-
based scale to prescribe intensity, care
must be taken to ensure it is properly
implemented. The ability to accurately
gauge traditional RPE is greater in
those
experienced
with
resistance
training
compared
with
novices
(13,43), and this seems to hold true
when using an RIR-based scale as well.
In a recent study by Zourdos et al.,
comparing the use of an RIR-based
scale in experienced and novice squat-
ters, not only were experienced squat-
ters
more
often
able
to
provide
accurate scores at 1RM (9.80 6 0.18
versus 8.96 6 0.43, p 5 0.023), but
the inverse association between scores
and velocity was stronger in experi-
enced compared with novice squatters
(r 5 20.88 versus r 5 20.77) (48). This
relationship between RIR and velocity
is important; as per the load-velocity
relationship, as intensity increases the
speed of movement decreases. For
example, in competitive powerlifting,
a sport where one of the goals of the
competitor is to squat as heavy a load
as possible for a single repetition, it has
been said that an attempted lift that is
just barely completed at the slowest
speed possible is indicative of the best
performance capable by that lifter (17).
This is not to say that loads are inten-
tionally moved slow, but rather that
experienced lifters due to their exten-
sive neuromuscular adaptations and
their ability to hold form at very heavy
loads, can “grind” through heavier at-
tempts than novice lifters at slower
speeds without failing. For this reason,
the ability to complete maximal lifts
at very slow speeds can be viewed as
a sign of neuromuscular efficiency,
with regard to maximal strength, and
indicative of an experienced lifter (48).
Thus, for this RIR-based scale to be
seen as a valid measure of assessing
intensity, final-repetition velocity should
decrease as the score of a given set in-
creases. Therefore, the stronger inverse
relationship observed in experienced
squatters seems to indicate that experi-
enced lifters are more accurate in gaug-
ing RIR.
Similar to previous data (19), Zourdos
et al. also observed that experienced
lifters are more consistent at gauging
RIR as they approach failure (48). This
is indicated by a decrease in the vari-
ability of scores as lifters performed
single repetitions at increasing intensi-
ties. The standard deviation of the
scores reported for single repetitions
at 100, 90, 75, and 60% of 1RM were
0.32, 0.92, 0.97, and 1.18, respectively,
for the experienced squatters (48). The
data from Zourdos et al. clearly sug-
gests experienced lifters to record more
accurate scores than novice lifters.
Therefore, novice lifters should prac-
tice recording RIR, but likely not base
training intensity or progression solely
on the RIR-based scale until increased
accuracy is achieved. A possible way to
gauge this is to take a submaximal set
short of failure and record a score fol-
lowed by a subsequent set at the same
load that is taken to failure to test if the
score was accurate. Once accuracy is
established, RIR scores should primar-
ily be used for training goals that
require sets to be completed near, or
a few repetitions short of volitional fail-
ure (RPE 7–10). Therefore, the use of
the RIR-based scale should primarily
be relegated to training goals such as
strength,
hypertrophy,
muscular
endurance, or heavy power training.
To conclude, implementation of the
RIR-based scale with novice and expe-
rienced lifters for various training goals
is possible. However, the RIR-based
scale should be implemented only as
an additional variable to be tracked
alongside normal training data with
novice lifters. This serves to increase
the awareness of how close each set
is performed to failure, and to there-
fore familiarize the user with the scale.
Once the lifter has advanced past the
novice stage, the use of this scale for
intensity prescription can be consid-
ered. However, before implementing
the scale in this manner, a session
dedicated to testing the lifter’s rating
accuracy with the scale should be
performed.
Furthermore,
prescribing
intensity
using an RIR-based scale is not mutu-
ally exclusive with prescribing inten-
sity using percentage 1RM or RM
values. If a practitioner wishes to use
these arguably more objective meas-
ures of intensity, they can also use
RIR in conjunction with a RM or per-
centage 1RM prescription to ensure
the
intended
stress
matches
the

44
 experienced stress of the lifter. For
example, if a practitioner prescribes 3
sets of 3 repetitions at 90% 1RM, they
might expect on a good day for the
lifter to be able to complete the initial
2 sets with 1 repetition remaining, and
for the final set to be near maximal. To
ensure that this intended intensity is
what is experienced, they can concur-
rently prescribe “0–1 RIR on all sets” so
that the lifter knows to reduce the
intensity if they are unable to complete
3 repetitions, or to increase the inten-
sity if they are able to complete sets
with more than 1 RIR. This approach
could also be used with an RM pre-
scription if the practitioner wishes for
the lifter to stop short of muscular fail-
ure. For example, a “5RM with 1 RIR”
could be prescribed so that the lifter
knows to use the heaviest load they
can lift for 5 repetitions, while stopping
the set with 1 RIR.
RELATIONSHIP OF PERCENTAGE
ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM,
REPETITIONS PERFORMED, AND
REPETITIONS IN RESERVE
For practitioners used to prescribing
intensity based on percentage 1RM
(and RM) and its relationship with
repetitions allowed, we direct them to
Table 2, which is a conversion chart
based on the mean RIR-based RPE
scores reported by the experienced
squatters for the single repetition sets
at 90 and 100% 1RM, and the 8 repe-
tition set at 70% 1RM in the publica-
tion by Zourdos et al. (48). This chart is
not without limitations as it is based on
the mean scores specific to the trained
lifters in this study only. Values for per-
centage 1RM repetition combinations
besides single repetitions at 90 and
100% 1RM and 8 repetitions at 70%
1RM are estimations. In addition, as
previously stated, there are significant
differences in how many repetitions
can be performed at the same percent-
age of 1RM by different individuals
(35). Furthermore, this chart is based
on the barbell back squat, and this rela-
tionship may change with machine-
based, single-joint, or upper-body exer-
cises. Finally, this chart is based on the
mean scores from Zourdos et al. (48).
Statistically, this is important to note
due to individual differences in the abil-
ity to perform repetitions at different
percentages of 1RM. For example,
the standard deviation reported at 8
repetitions at 70% of 1RM was 1.2.
Meaning, that roughly two-thirds of
lifters when performing a set of 8 rep-
etitions at 70% of 1RM may report an
RIR between 2 and 4, whereas some
lifters may report an RIR as low as 1 or
as high as 5. Therefore, this chart
should be primarily used to conceptu-
alize the relationship between repeti-
tions performed, percentage of 1RM
and RIR scores in trained lifters. It
should not be viewed as an absolute
conversion tool because of individual
differences and day-to-day variations
in strength that were discussed earlier
in this review.
INCORPORATING THE SCALE INTO
PROGRAMMING
Once an athlete is determined to be
adequately experienced with resistance
training and has been familiarized
using the scale, it can be integrated
into any training plan designed to
maximize
hypertrophy,
muscular
endurance, strength, or power at rela-
tively heavy loads. Because of the in-
accuracy of gauging RIR when a set is
completed far from volitional failure, it
would not be appropriate to use this
scale for low to moderate intensity,
high-velocity power training (under
80% 1RM) if the goal is to have an
accurate gauge of RIR (3). However,
the development of power in the
high-force
portion
of
the
force-
velocity curve could be targeted using
this scale (20). That said, a potential use
for this scale for low to moderate inten-
sity, high-velocity power training may
exist by setting an “intensity cap” on
sets performed. Because the scale has
subjective descriptors of effort for val-
ues below 5 (1–2 RPE 5 “little to no
effort,” 3–4 RPE 5 “light effort”), it could
be used to determine if high-velocity
power training is being performed in
an explosive enough manner, by limiting
sets to loads that can be performed at an
RPE no higher than 4. Thus, this illus-
trates the additional advantage of a com-
bined RPE/RIR scale rather than solely
focusing on one or the other.
As previously mentioned, intensity can
be prescribed using percentage 1RM
or as an RM with a reference RIR
value, or if the lifter is appropriately
familiarized with this scale a practi-
tioner can prescribe only a repetition
target (or range) and a target RIR (or
RIR range). For example, if the practi-
tioner wishes for the lifter to perform 3

 sets of 10 repetitions, 1 or 2 repetitions
short of failure, they would prescribe:
“3 3 10 at RPE 8–9 (i.e., 2 or 1 RIR).”
The lifter would then select a load with
which they believe they could com-
plete 10 repetitions, 1–2 repetitions
short of failure (based on previous
training experience, perceived readi-
ness on the day of, and RPE scores
on warm-up sets). To further aid prac-
titioners who wish to prescribe inten-
sity using RIR, the following sections
cover how the scale functions for dif-
ferent training goals.
MUSCULAR HYPERTROPHY
Recent investigations into the determi-
nants of muscular hypertrophy have
revealed that total volume of training
is of primary importance for stimulat-
ing muscle growth rather than a spe-
cific repetition range (22,37,40,41,47).
Although low intensities (;20RM or
higher)
can
produce
appreciable
hypertrophy (41), if the intensity is
too light it may not completely opti-
mize muscle growth. Even when low-
intensity (30% 1RM) training is per-
formed until volitional failure, the same
degree of muscle activation that occurs
with heavier intensities (75% 1RM) is
not
attained
(38).
Campos
et
al.
observed that when a matched volume
of moderate (9–11RM) and high inten-
sity (3–5RM) training is performed,
a similar magnitude of hypertrophy oc-
curs, which is greater than hypertro-
phy induced by low-intensity training
(20–28RM)
also
performed
at
a matched volume (8). This may be
because light loads, even when force-
fully accelerated and matched for vol-
ume, do not produce the same force
output over the course of a session as
moderate loads as indicated by a lower
average impulse (27). However, the
utility of high repetition low-intensity
training for hypertrophy should not be
completely dismissed. Recent research
compared an equated number of sets at
25–35RM to 8–12RM and found sim-
ilar levels of hypertrophy (39). Unlike
Campos’ research, volume (resistance
3 sets 3 reps) in the 25–35RM group
was approximately twice that of the 8–
12RM group, so the comparative utility
of high repetition low-intensity train-
ing is still in question. However, given
the recommendation of some research-
ers to use a mixture of high, moderate,
and low-repetition training to optimize
not
only
global,
but
fiber-specific
hypertrophy (40), a direct comparison
between RM training zones might not
be the appropriate research question.
Rather, future research should examine
the utility of a combination of high,
moderate, and low RM training zones
within a periodized plan because it
could prove optimal for maximizing
hypertrophy.
To summarize, loads that are “heavy
enough” (,20RM) and are performed
with an adequately high volume seem
to optimize hypertrophy. Thus, for
most of the training, both heavy and
moderate loads can be used to effec-
tively stimulate muscle growth. How-
ever, it seems that the repetition range
typically associated with hypertrophy
of 6–12 may not be inherently superior
to heavier training for hypertrophy for
any mechanistic reason (26). Rather,
the 6–12 repetition range could poten-
tially have an advantage from a time
efficiency stand point. Specifically, data
has shown 3RM training to yield sim-
ilar biceps hypertrophy to 10RM train-
ing (40), and undulating periodization
of a low-repetition group (2–6 repeti-
tions) versus a high-repetition group
(8–12 repetitions) to result in similar
hypertrophy of the chest and quadri-
ceps (26); and in both cases, high-
repetition training took less total time
per session. Performing sets with very
heavy
loads
(3RM)
requires
sub-
stantially
longer
to
perform
than
matched-volume training with moder-
ate intensities (10RM) (40). Therefore,
we advise primarily (but not exclu-
sively) using repetitions in the range
of 6–12, with an RIR-based RPE of
8–10 (RIR 0–2) depending on phase
of training. Training at an RIR of
0 (to failure) should be implemented
in a manner so as not to potentially
reduce volume on subsequent sets
due to fatigue, and therefore limited
to the final set performed for a given
body part and primarily relegated to
exercises with a low biomechanical
complexity and risk of injury (i.e., iso-
lative
assistance
movements)
(22).
Thus, for main movements (squats,
bench press, etc.) primarily performing
sets within the RPE range of 6–8 (i.e.,
2–4 RIR) may be an appropriate strat-
egy to avoid excessive muscle damage
and reductions in intensity can be im-
plemented as needed on subsequent
sets. Likewise, to avoid decrements to
volume performed on subsequent sets,
rest periods should not be restricted for
hypertrophy training despite the com-
mon recommendation to do so. With
only 1 exception (46), most of the
research
has
not
supported
the
hypothesis that restricted interset rest
periods
provide
an
advantage
for
hypertrophy (1,11,22,24,40). In fact,
in one study, a significant increase in
hypertrophy was reported only in the
group using a longer versus shorter rest
interval (7). Indeed, short rest intervals
can
compromise
the
volume
per-
formed on repeated sets (10), which
some authors have theorized could
harm hypertrophy and thus subse-
quent sets should be performed when
the athlete is ready (24).
MUSCULAR ENDURANCE
Muscular endurance training is per-
formed in a similar manner as hypertro-
phy training except with a focus on
developing
fatigue
resistance
rather
than training to maximize volume at
a moderate intensity. In this case, and
in contrast to hypertrophy-type train-
ing, rest periods can be purposely
restricted to promote the adaptation of
faster interset recovery if desired (10).
Higher repetition training (25–35RM)
has been shown to result in a greater
number of repetitions performed than
hypertrophy training (8–12RM) on the
50% 1RM bench press to failure test
(39).
Very
high
repetition
training
(100–150RM) can also be used to
develop muscular endurance, depend-
ing on the training goals of the individ-
ual, as shown by seminal research by
Anderson and Kearney (2). Also, while
training to failure is not always advised
for hypertrophy because of the potential
to harm performance on subsequent
Evidence-Based Personal Training
VOLUME 38 | NUMBER 4 | AUGUST 2016
46
 sets, training to failure does seem to
more effectively enhance local muscular
endurance than stopping short of failure
(25). Therefore, sets of 12 repetitions
and higher (3) performed with shorter
rest intervals (,2 minutes) at an RIR-
based RPE of 9–10 (RIR 0–1), with rest
periods and repetition ranges specific to
the needs of the athlete, should consti-
tute most of a session targeting muscular
endurance.
MAXIMAL STRENGTH
For the development of strength, it
seems that training intensities of 80–
100% of 1RM provide the largest mean
effect for those with resistance-training
experience (32,34). For this reason, it is
recommended when training athletes
to use intensities in the 1–6RM range
for sessions with the goal of maximiz-
ing muscular strength (3). When using
RIR-based scores, this could translate
into a large number of RPE-repetition
combinations. As displayed in Table 2,
83% of 1RM is roughly equal to 6RM,
therefore 6 repetitions with 0 RIR,
5 repetitions with 1 RIR, 4 repetitions
with 2 RIR, or 3 repetitions with 3 RIR
would all be roughly equivalent in load
and representative of the lower end of
the intensity threshold for maximal
strength development. However, it is
worth repeating
the limitations
of
Table 2 as it is based on the mean val-
ues of trained lifters performing the
barbell back squat, and thus a perfect
relationship between percentage 1RM
and RIR should not be expected.
Inherently,
the
term
“maximal
strength” is indicative of a performance
representative of an athlete’s maximal
force output. Therefore, per the princi-
ple of specificity, some training at an
RPE 10 (RIR 0) should occur to accli-
mate an athlete for this goal, especially
if a training cycle is concluded with
RM
testing.
However,
caution
is
advised when training to failure regu-
larly as it may cause alterations in rest-
ing hormone concentrations consistent
with overreaching in the absence of
superior strength enhancement versus
submaximal training (i.e., 2 or 1 RIR)
(25). In addition, when a large portion
of an athlete’s training volume is per-
formed to near maximal intensities (i.e.,
.90% of 1RM), increases in strength
may be compromised compared with
performing only a moderate amount of
volume in this range (18). Thus, train-
ing at the higher end of the intensity
spectrum should be carefully planned
and cycled into a periodized program.
POWER
As was previously stated, determining
actual RIR for low intensity high-
velocity power training is most likely
not possible because of the inability to
determine RIR far from failure. How-
ever, using an “intensity cap” of RPE 4
could be implemented for low intensity
high-velocity power training to ensure
movement speed remains appropri-
ately high. Meaning, that if the lifter
can accurately estimate RIR, the load
is likely inappropriately heavy for this
type of training and should be reduced
to maintain velocity.
For power training with the goal of
developing the high-force end of
the power spectrum, the RPE scores
determined by RIR may be appropri-
ate. Force-dominant power training
using
relatively
heavy
intensities
(.80% 1RM) should be performed
with maximal intent to accelerate
the load while also managing fatigue
by performing low repetition sets
(1–5) stopping sufficiently short of
volitional failure (RIR 2–3) (20,30).
Like maximal strength training, rest
interval between sets should be ade-
quate to allow for complete recovery
and should mostly fall in the range of
3–5 minutes (10).
A visual schematic of the relationship
between training goal, repetitions,
and RIR-based RPE is shown in
Figure 1.

 PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The creation of an RIR-based scale is
the most recent iteration of RPE that
specifically addresses the needs of
resistance training. It provides a valid
measure of intensity, based on RIR,
which retains its reliability when sets
are taken near and to volitional failure.
While there is a potential advantage in
the use of this scale, it should also be
pointed out that at this early stage of
RIR-based research, a great many
questions still remain.
At present, RIR data are available only
on novice and experienced male and
female lifters performing free weight
barbell squats (48) and experienced
male lifters performing free weight bar-
bell bench presses and squats (19).
Research that specifically examines
potential differences between sexes, ex-
amines
muscle
actions
other
than
dynamic (such as eccentric-only train-
ing), compares single-joint to multi-
joint exercises, machine-based to free
weight exercises, and open to closed-
chain exercises is lacking at this devel-
opmental stage. Although it should not
be assumed that the RIR-based scale
will prove invalid for comparing males
to females or assessing other forms of
resistance
training,
rare
differences
between
sexes
(31)
and
also
resistance-training
mode
(12)
have
been observed when using traditional
RPE that could theoretically extend to
an RIR-based scale.
Therefore, while we encourage the
appropriate
implementation
of
this
scale, until more research is performed,
practitioners should be well aware of
the limitations of the available research
before doing so. For those considering
using an RIR-based RPE scale, this
article serves to outline its uses, limita-
tions, and how the scale relates to
other methods of prescribing intensity
such as percentage of 1RM and RM.
It must be stated that this scale is not
a stand-alone method of training, how-
ever, by following the strategies out-
lined in this article, this scale can be
successfully implemented to prescribe
and progress training intensity and
load within a periodized model to
achieve
the
desired
physiological
adaptations.
