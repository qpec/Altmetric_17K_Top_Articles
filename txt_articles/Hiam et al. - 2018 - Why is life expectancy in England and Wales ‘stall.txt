Several independent analyses, by both epidemiologists 
and actuaries, have concluded that the previous rate of 
improvement of life expectancy in England and Wales 
has now slowed markedly, and at older ages may 
even be reversing. However, although these findings 
have led the pension industry to reduce estimates of 
future liabilities, they have failed to elicit any significant 
concern in the Department of Health and Social Care. 
In this essay, we review the evidence on changing life 
expectancy, noting that the problems are greatest among 
older women. We then estimate the gap between what 
life expectancy is now and what it might have been 
had previous trends continued. At age 85, the gap is 
0.34 years for women and 0.23 for men. We argue that 
recent changes cannot be dismissed as a temporary 
aberration. While the causes of this phenomenon are 
contested, there is growing evidence to point to the 
austerity policies implemented in recent years as at least 
a partial explanation. We conclude by calling for a fully 
independent enquiry to ascertain what is happening to 
life expectancy in England and Wales and what should 
be done about it.
InTroduCTIon
In July 2017, the UK’s Institute of Health Equity, 
using data from the Office for National Statistics 
(ONS), released a briefing on faltering improve-
ments in life expectancy at birth in England. It 
showed that the previous increases of 1 
year every 
5 years for women, and 1 
year every 3.5 years for 
men, had slowed since 2010 to 1 
year in every 10 
for women, and 1 in every 6 for men.1 The head 
of the institute, Professor Sir Michael Marmot, 
said he was ‘deeply concerned’ and called for work 
to discover what had happened as a ‘matter of 
urgency’.2 In particular, he noted that this could not 
be dismissed as the population reaching the biolog-
ical limits of longevity, as life expectancy in the UK 
continues to lag behind that achieved in many other 
affluent countries.
The response by the UK Department of Health 
(DoH) failed to address his specific points, instead 
stating that ‘Life expectancy continues to increase, 
with cancer survival rates at a record high whilst 
smoking rates are at an all-time low’.2 Their first 
point was not disputed; Marmot’s concern was 
that the rate of improvement had slowed markedly 
rather than stopped. The second point was at best 
only partly relevant, and the third completely failed 
to address the concerns raised.
This is not the first time such concerns have been 
reported, or that the DoH has dismissed them so 
abruptly. In early 2017, our research in the Journal 
of the Royal Society of Medicine (JRSM) raised the 
alarm about an increase in deaths in England and 
Wales, particularly in the older population, an anal-
ysis complicated by delays in publication of the 
necessary data.3 4 Although some of the increase 
could be explained by changes in the age struc-
ture of the population, there remained a substan-
tial increase, concentrated among older people, 
that could not be. After reviewing other possible 
causes, like Marmot, we concluded that it was not 
possible to offer a complete explanation and that 
an urgent, thorough investigation was needed. We 
too received a dismissive response from a DoH 
spokesperson who stated: ‘this report is a triumph 
of personal bias over research’.
These concerns have not been assuaged by the 
most recent data on life expectancy for England 
and Wales, released by ONS in September 2017. 
Figure 1 is based on data from the ONS decennial 
supplement,5 compiled at 10-year intervals coin-
ciding with censuses, which maximises the preci-
sion with which rates are calculated. It has been 
brought up to date using the very latest estimates 
of life expectancy published by ONS in September 
2017.6 ONS life expectancy estimates are now 
based on age-specific mortality by individual year 
of age up to age 100, and so these estimates are not 
affected by any issues of ‘ageing within bands’.7
The most recent period has seen one of the 
greatest slowdowns in the rate of improvement 
for both sexes since the 1890s (although there was 
also a marked slowdown for men in the 1960s) 
(figure 1).
Specifically, the most recent rate of improvement 
in life expectancy for either women or men in the 
most recent years (2010/2 to 2014/16) was between 
2.1 and 3.5 times lower than at any time between 
1981 and 2011. The previous decade that was most 
similar to the current one is 1881–1891. So far, 
we only have life expectancy data up until 2016. 
We will not be able to compare the whole of the 
current decade until 5 
years from now. However, 
the current picture should be seen as sufficiently 
alarming to warrant serious investigation before 
then (before 2022). The most recent data on total 
number of deaths rising in 2017 (see below) and 
the response of the pensions industry add weight 
to this claim.
Although what is now the Department of Health 
and Social Care appears unperturbed by these 
recent trends, the pension industry has certainly 
taken note.8 Price Waterhouse Cooper estimates 
that ‘[a] sharp slowdown in the improvement to life 
expectancy could wipe £310bn from the pension

deficits of thousands of UK companies with final salary schemes’, 
equivalent to a 15% reduction.9 There is some dispute over the 
final figure, but there appears to be no dispute in the pension 
industry that future life expectancies are likely to be lower than 
expected.10 This is especially important, given that those covered 
by this industry tend to be healthier than average.11 If we no 
longer expect people in the UK to live as long as we thought they 
would a few years ago, we need to know why.
We now consider the trends in life expectancy in the older 
population, compared with what could have been expected if 
previous trends continued, presenting evidence to refute claims 
by some that the trends seen are merely a ‘blip’. We argue that 
this demands an urgent independent investigation, with adequate 
resources and the power to obtain the necessary data for the 
detailed analyses we believe are required and to summon minis-
ters and officials to give evidence.
LIfE ExpECTAnCy for ELdErLy pEopLE
Before 2012, life expectancy for elderly people was rising at an 
almost constant rate each year with some acceleration in the 
period immediately prior to 2011. This can be seen clearly in 
table 1, showing the change between consecutive 3-year aver-
ages (to smooth annual fluctuations). A very similar trend is seen 
for men and women and for life expectancy as measured from 
either age 65, age 75 or age 85. In every case, what had been 
consistent improvements declined markedly after ‘2008–2010’ 
and ‘2009–2011’. Given the consistency of the earlier trends, 
this reflected a marked increase in death rates in 2012. Worry-
ingly, in the most recent period, in the oldest groups. there were 
actual declines. The worsening of life expectancy for women 
over 85 years was first raised as an issue of immediate concern 
over 3 
years ago,12 yet it received little attention then and little 
since, despite becoming much worse year on year.
Table 1 shows that there is no sign at all of the decelera-
tion slowing down. What started in 2012 worsened dramati-
cally in 2015, when deaths rose by 5.6%—the largest annual 
percentage increase since the 1960s.13 While there has been a 
slight recovery in the most recent data, the improvements are 
still less than half the size of those observed up until 2010/11. To 
explore this further, we now compare observed life expectancy 
with predicted trends calculated using regression techniques or 
‘expected’ life expectancy.
TrEnds In LIfE ExpECTAnCy for ThE ovEr 65s
The over 65s have borne the brunt of the deceleration in life 
expectancy gains. We have shown this in the crude differences 
in life expectancies and now examine the gap between expected 
life expectancy, if trends up to 2009–2011 had continued, and 
observed life expectancy, using data reported by the ONS, for 
people of ages 65, 75 and 85 years (figure 2).14 Note the axes in 
figure 2 do not start at zero.
The gap between the expected and the observed values varies 
from 0.49 years in women at age 65 years to 0.20 years in men 
at age 85 years.
However, it is not the slowing that is the most concerning. 
Although that should be considered an amber warning light, 
demanding investigation at least, any reversal in life expectancy 
should be considered a red danger sign. This can now be seen 
clearly for three groups following the change between 2012–
2014 and 2013–2015. For female life expectancy at 75 years, 
there was a fall from 13.11 to 13.09 years; for women at age 85 
years, a fall from 6.85 to 6.80 years and for male life expectancy 
at 85 years, a fall from 5.85 to 5.84 years. Life expectancy was 
not ‘continuing to increase’ for everyone at the time the DoH’s 
made its assertions.
A TEmporAry ChAngE?
Politicians’ attempts to reassure the public that these changes are 
only temporary may be overly optimistic. Table 2 presents the 
same data but only reports changes between non-overlapping 
figure 1 Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales, 1840–2016.

3-year periods. The changes in the first two periods are very 
similar. In every case, there were rapid improvements in life 
expectancy for elderly people, which either stayed the same or 
improved slightly until 2012. Then, in the most recent 3-year 
period, the improvement for men from age 65 has more than 
halved (0.65 to 0.27). That for women aged 65 has reduced to 
just a quarter of what it had been (0.55 to 0.13). The most recent 
changes are worst for the very elderly (who are presumably the 
most frail or otherwise disadvantaged and potentially most 
susceptible to what is causing this recent trend). For men, aged 
from 85, the most recent improvement (0.02 years in 3 
years) is 
a tenth of the previous rate of improvement. For women aged 
from 85, what had been a greater rate of improvement than 
among men of the same age (0.17 and 0.22 years) suddenly 
became a fall in life expectancy after 2011.
The final column in table 2 shows the very latest data made 
available in September 2017. It compares 2011–2013 with 
2014–2016 and shows that there has been no end to the slow-
down in improvements. The latest provisional weekly deaths 
for England and Wales from January to October 2017 show a 
crude increase of 15 
605 deaths compared with the average of 
the corresponding weeks over the past 5 years.15
There is, therefore, no sign yet that the pattern that emerged 
in 2012, and which worsened in 2015, is temporary. Evidence 
from a longer period in the USA shows that there are no grounds 
for confidence that such deceleration in improvements, or even 
declines, will be as short-lived as some policy makers in the UK 
seem to assume.
The fact that the changes have systematically harmed women 
more than men, and the very elderly more than the younger 
elderly, suggests that it is those who have less access to resources 
of all kinds that have been hardest hit. Elderly women are far 
more likely to live alone and to be poor as compared with elderly 
men. People aged over 85 tend to be more frail, and, crucially, 
more likely to be dependent on a well-functioning health and 
social care system. As a Professor of Biogerontology has recently 
suggested ‘…it can be argued that the oldest people are highly 
vulnerable and that excess deaths among them – from under-
funded services – are a major cause of the stalled life expectancy 
increases’.16
ThE sEArCh for CAusEs
Any very large change in mortality trends must be taken 
extremely seriously. Life expectancy is the most important 
social statistic that any country produces about itself and it is 
often an early sign of wider societal problems, as in the former 
USSR in the 1980s17 or in the USA more recently. American 
life expectancy at birth stalled between 2010 and 2014 and, in 
2015, actually declined, with rising rates from causes that have 
been described as ‘deaths of despair’18 concentrated among the 
poor in states that had experienced the greatest economic and 
social decline.19 This has political consequences; those counties 
in which life expectancy stagnated or declined experienced the 
largest increases in Republican votes in the 2016 Presidential 
election.20
Some other European countries have seen slowing of improve-
ments in life expectancy but, crucially, not all, and not to the 
extent seen in England and Wales. Whether comparison of the 
economic choices made by those countries whose life expec-
tancy has continued to improve, such as Norway and Finland, to 
those who have seen stalling, such as France21 and Germany, may 
help understand this remains to be seen, although some caution 
is required given differences in recording of deaths occurring 
among people temporarily abroad, a particular issue for older 
people from some Northern European countries. For now, we 
are only able to hypothesise.
Our previous search for causes of these reversals in trends in 
England considered the possibilities of data artefact; environ-
mental events such as war, natural disaster or unusually cold 
weather; influenza and failings of the health and social care system.

Essay
One argument sometimes advanced is that, in the UK, life 
expectancy is reaching a theoretical maximum, so some slowing 
in the rate of improvement is inevitable. Yet, other countries, 
such as Japan, show that the UK is still far from what can be 
achieved with existing knowledge. Moreover, the overall slowing 
conceals how life expectancy is actually falling in some parts 
of England.22 Influenza is likely to have played some role, but 
even if it did, questions remain as to why, as with excess winter 
mortality, people living in the UK seem to have been more likely 
to die from it than in some other European countries. Impor-
tantly, others have suggested that influenza may be overstated as 
a cause of otherwise unexplained premature deaths, at least in 
the USA,23 where reversals in life expectancy have been similarly 
poorly addressed.24
Those most affected by the rise in mortality and stalling, and 
in some cases reversing, of life expectancy, the elderly, are also 
the group most reliant on a well-functioning health and social 
care system. In the context of the relentless underfunding of the 
health and social care system since 2010, we pointed to evidence 
that suggested a possible link between these two factors, 
requiring urgent review. As long ago as February 2014, we wrote 
that ‘The 2012–2013 rise appeared to be more of a trend’ and 
suggested austerity as the mostly likely immediate cause.12 Subse-
quent research noted how the narrowing gap in life expectancy 
between the most and least deprived local authorities, which 
coincided with the government strategy to reduce inequalities 
that ended in 2010, began to widen between 2012 and 2015.25
There are alternative suggestions, including a possible infective 
agent other than influenza.26 However, the main debate is about 
whether it is still too early to conclude that what is observed is 
the beginning of a trend that should cause concern. The situ-
ation is complicated by delays in publication of detailed data 
and questions of how it should be interpreted.7 In July 2017, 
Public Health England reviewed possible causes, including popu-
lation changes and influenza, including international compari-
sons, concluding there was not enough evidence as yet to show 
a change in trends.27 Yet, as noted above, the Institute and 
Faculty of Actuaries disagrees and has revised its projection of 
life expectancy downwards, reducing predicted pension liabili-
ties by billions of pounds.8 Furthermore both the life expectancy 
data released by ONS in September 2017 and the continued high 
raw death counts (recognising the need for more detailed anal-
ysis when the necessary data on deaths by detailed age category 
become available), adds more weight to the argument that we 
have now seen enough to know that something very important 
has changed.  
It is essential, for many reasons, that the divergent views 
over what the causes might be are resolved. The answer has 
implications for fiscal, health and social policies, among many 
others. Most recently, Sir Michael Marmot has called for an 
urgent investigation into whether spending cuts are impacting 
length of life, with evidence that they have already impacted on 
quality of life.28 Other research has found a link between cuts in 
payments to pensioners and mortality29 and delay in National 
Health Service discharges and mortality.30 Most recently, 
research implicated ‘spending constraints’ as contributing to 
45 
368 (95% CI 34 
530 to 56 206) extra deaths from 2010 to 
2014, compared with pre-2010 trends, predominantly in people 
aged over 60 years and living in care homes.31 Correlation is not 
proof of causality, as all epidemiologists know. However, in the 
absence of a clear explanation or simple research method that 
could confirm a causal relationship between underfunding and 
increased mortality, simply dismissing the possibility is not justi-
fiable. Correlation is not always coincidence.
All this strengthens the case for inquiring into a possible rela-
tionship between underfunding and mortality. The need for 
answers is now even more urgent than it was last year, given the 
likely impact of Brexit on government finances and the threat to 
recruitment of health and social care staff already being expe-
rienced.32 The question then is who should do this inquiry? 
Researchers can, and must contribute to the analyses, but the 
questions raised go beyond what can be answered by demo-
graphic analyses, raising important political issues. However, 
researchers, whether in non-governmental organisations or 
universities, lack the power to require production of the neces-
sary data to answer the key questions.
Once, questions of this nature might have been addressed by 
a Royal Commission, but these have gone out of favour and, 
anyway, they would have to be convened by ministers who show 
little inclination to do so in this case. The urgency of finding an 
answer suggests that public inquiries, such as those into the Iraq 
War or Bloody Sunday, are unlikely to be appropriate or speedy. 
The one body that does have the legitimacy to conduct such an 
inquiry, coupled with the necessary powers to summon witnesses 
and require data to be made available, is parliament, with the 
health committees of the Commons and the Lords providing the 
obvious mechanisms.
ConCLusIon
Concerns about life expectancy have been raised by academics 
at least twice in 2017, and twice the DoH’s responses have been 
disappointing, even attacking the researchers involved. Life 
expectancy in England and Wales has stalled, and in some cases 
reversed, yet there is no consensus as to why. There is a growing 
suspicion that prolonged austerity is likely to matter greatly. 
Opinions as to the cause range from cuts in health and social 
care,3 4 epidemic disease26 and statistical artefact.7 All of these 
must be explored. What is indisputable is what the data now 
clearly show. This is not temporary. An independent investiga-
tion is urgently needed, requiring time, resource and authority 
to be carried out. If ministers are not prepared to ask the appro-
priate questions, someone else must.
