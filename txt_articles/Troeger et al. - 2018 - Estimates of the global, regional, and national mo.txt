Estimates of the global, regional, and national morbidity, 
mortality, and aetiologies of lower respiratory infections 
in 195 countries, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Lower Respiratory Infections Collaborators*
Summary
Background Lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. The Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016, provides an up-to-date analysis of the burden of 
lower respiratory infections in 195 countries. This study assesses cases, deaths, and aetiologies spanning the past 
26 years and shows how the burden of lower respiratory infection has changed in people of all ages.
Methods We used three separate modelling strategies for lower respiratory infections in GBD 2016: a Bayesian 
hierarchical ensemble modelling platform (Cause of Death Ensemble model), which uses vital registration, verbal 
autopsy data, and surveillance system data to predict mortality due to lower respiratory infections; a compartmental 
meta-regression tool (DisMod-MR), which uses scientific literature, population representative surveys, and health-
care data to predict incidence, prevalence, and mortality; and modelling of counterfactual estimates of the population 
attributable fraction of lower respiratory infection episodes due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae 
type b, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. We calculated each modelled estimate for each age, sex, year, and 
location. We modelled the exposure level in a population for a given risk factor using DisMod-MR and a spatio-
temporal Gaussian process regression, and assessed the effectiveness of targeted interventions for each risk factor in 
children younger than 5 years. We also did a decomposition analysis of the change in LRI deaths from 2000–16 using 
the risk factors associated with LRI in GBD 2016.
Findings In 2016, lower respiratory infections caused 652 572 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 586 475–720 612) 
in children younger than 5 years (under-5s), 1 080 958 deaths (943 749–1 170 638) in adults older than 70 years, and 
2 377 697 deaths (2 145 584–2 512 809) in people of all ages, worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading cause 
of lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality globally, contributing to more deaths than all other aetiologies 
combined in 2016 (1 189 937 deaths, 95% UI 690 445–1 770 660). Childhood wasting remains the leading risk factor for 
lower respiratory infection mortality among children younger than 5 years, responsible for 61·4% of lower respiratory 
infection deaths in 2016 (95% UI 45·7–69·6). Interventions to improve wasting, household air pollution, ambient 
particulate matter pollution, and expanded antibiotic use could avert one under-5 death due to lower respiratory 
infection for every 4000 children treated in the countries with the highest lower respiratory infection burden.
Interpretation Our findings show substantial progress in the reduction of lower respiratory infection burden, but this 
progress has not been equal across locations, has been driven by decreases in several primary risk factors, and might 
require more effort among elderly adults. By highlighting regions and populations with the highest burden, and the 
risk factors that could have the greatest effect, funders, policy makers, and programme implementers can more 
effectively reduce lower respiratory infections among the world’s most susceptible populations.

Introduction
Lower respiratory tract infections, defined in the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, are a leading 
cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Nearly 
2·38 million deaths resulted from lower respiratory 
infections in 2016, making lower respiratory infections 
the sixth leading cause of mortality for all ages and the 
leading cause of death among children younger than 
5 years.1 Historically, lower respiratory infection burden 
varies substantially across the globe, disproportionately 
affecting the young and the impoverished.2 People at 
highest risk for contracting or dying from lower 
respiratory infections often come from households with 
inconsistent or insufficient access to adequate nutrition, 
clean cooking fuel, vaccines, and sanitation, or have 
immunocompromising conditions.3 Although there has 
been a substantial decrease in lower respiratory infection

mortality since 1990 (23·0% decrease, 95% uncertainty 
interval [UI] 15·7–29·4),1 the majority of the remaining 
deaths could be avertable and require increased global 
investment in prevention and treatment interventions.
A handful of global initiatives have been developed 
to combat lower respiratory infections and other 
common illnesses, including the Global Action Plan for 
Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD), Every Breath 
Counts, and the Stop Pneumonia Initiative. The GAPPD, 
created by WHO and UNICEF in 2013, is a global 
initiative focusing on the prevention and treatment of 
lower respiratory infections.4 Among other initiatives, 
the GAPPD promotes interventions to address the most 
evident risks for contracting and dying from lower 
respiratory infections. It aims to reduce the burden of 
lower respiratory infection in every country by 2025, by 
lowering mortality to three deaths per 1000 people and 
lower respiratory infection incidence to 75% of the 
country-specific levels in 2010. Such goals were developed 
with an emphasis on childhood mortality and the 
substantial burden of lower respiratory infections among 
adults might not be fully appreciated. Understanding 
and quantifying trends in lower respiratory infection 
burden among people of all ages is crucial to develop 
plans that accelerate improvement and to provide timely 
and appropriate investment in interventions to reduce 
lower respiratory infection burden and to track progress 
toward global goals.
Estimates of the burden of lower respiratory infections 
and their aetiologies are produced annually as part of the 
GBD Study. This paper presents the results of GBD 2016 
for lower respiratory infections and four high-burden 
aetiologies 
(Haemophilus 
influenza 
type 
b 
[Hib], 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza, and respiratory 
syncytial virus [RSV]), including deaths, episodes, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and risk factors, 
the relationship between lower respiratory infections and 
social development, and intervention strategies for 
195 countries, from 1990 to 2016, by age, for men and 
women. We build on previous descriptions of the global 
burden of lower respiratory infection by incorporating 
more than 287 000 additional cause of death and non-
fatal datapoints. Further, this study provides greater 
emphasis on exploring the trends in morbidity and 
mortality, such as the relationships between cases and 
fatality, by highlighting the burden across all ages, and by 
identifying risks and interventions that have the greatest 
potential to reduce lower respiratory infection disease 
burden.
Methods
Overview
Detailed methods for the GBD study and on lower 
respiratory infection estimation in GBD have been 
previously published.1,5 We describe these methods 
briefly, focusing on changes from previous GBD 
methods. There were no substantial modelling changes 
between GBD 2015 and GBD 2016. lower respiratory 
infections are defined as diseases of the lower airways, 
including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Uncertainty in 
the lower respiratory infection estimates are maintained 
through the modelling process using draws, and are 
reflected as the 2·5 and 97·5 percentiles of the 
distribution. In compliance with the Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting,6 
data and code for the GBD 2016 cycle will be made 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Lower respiratory infections are responsible for a substantial 
number of deaths, particularly among children younger than 
5 years (under-5). Most other studies that have attempted to 
quantify the burden of lower respiratory infections have 
focused on children younger than 5 years or on subpopulations, 
such as immunocompromised children and adults. Other 
studies have attempted to quantify respiratory pathogens, 
such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or influenza, and have found 
a wide range of results depending on modelling assumptions 
and input data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015, showed lower respiratory 
infections 
being responsible for over 2·74 million deaths 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·50–2·86) in 2015, and the 
third leading cause of under-5 mortality worldwide. 
Furthermore, an estimated 291·8 million episodes
(276·3–307·0) of lower respiratory infections occurred in 2015, 
and were the second leading cause of disability-adjusted 
life-years (103 million DALYs; 95% UI 96·1–109·1).
Added value of this study
This GBD analysis includes new data sources, new covariates, 
and various advances in the modelling methods. Furthermore, 
we produce estimates of hospitalisations due to lower 
respiratory infection (for all ages), highlight the 
underappreciated and growing burden of lower respiratory 
infections on elderly populations, and do a novel analysis of the 
effect of changes in risk factors over time on the lower 
respiratory infection mortality rate, allowing for targeted 
strategies unique to each location to reduce lower respiratory 
infection risk and mortality.
Implications of all the available evidence
The epidemiology of lower respiratory infections is changing, 
and large reductions in lower respiratory infection mortality, 
particularly among young children have occurred in the past 
16 years. Still, air pollution, childhood undernutrition, and 
access to timely and appropriate health care represent 
challenges and opportunities for continuing to avert mortality 
due to this preventable cause of death.

publicly available. The appendix shows more information 
about the data included in this study (pp 3–5, 9–13).
Modelling
We modelled lower respiratory infection mortality 
using the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) 
platform. CODEm is a Bayesian, hierarchical, space-
time, ensemble model designed to predict cause-specific 
mortality by age, sex, location, and year.1,7 CODEm 
produces a wide variety of submodels designed to explore 
a diverse set of covariates (eg, childhood undernutrition, 
air pollution, and Socio-demographic Index) and model 
types. We added several new covariates for GBD 2016, 
including prevalence of childhood wasting (low 
weight-for-height) and underweight (low weight-for-age), 
vitamin A deficiency, zinc deficiency, health-care access 
and quality, and safe handwashing. A full list of covariates 
used in the CODEm modelling can be found in the 
appendix (pp 7–8). Each submodel is weighted on the 
basis of out-of-sample predictive validity, and contributes 
to a final set of 1000 draws that is composed of draws 
sampled from the submodels based on each model’s 
statistical performance. These predictive regression 
models produce estimates of lower respiratory infection 
mortality for age, sex, location, and year on the basis of 
vital registration, verbal autopsy data, and surveillance 
system data.
The GBD 2016 used more than 30 000 datapoints from 
more than 700 sources. Compared with the GBD 2015, the 
GBD 2016 cycle expanded its data sources by adding 
169 country-years of vital registration and 24 new verbal 
autopsy studies, including Sample Registration System 
data from the Government of India for each state, stratified 
by urban or rural residence.1 Detailed information about 
the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes that 
were used to identify lower respiratory infections is 
available in the appendix (p 3). To ensure consistency and 
interpretability across GBD cause-specific estimations, we 
adjusted the sum of the all-cause-specific mortality 
estimates to equal the all-cause mortality estimate. We did 
this using CoDCorrect, in which the modelled values 
for lower respiratory infection and all other causes of 
mortality were scaled on the basis of the uncertainty of 
those values. A new process in GBD 2016 reassigned some 
lower respiratory infection deaths for which the underlying 
cause of death was because of disorders in elderly adults, 
such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, 
reducing the number of deaths among people aged 
65 years and older.1 This reassignment was based on the 
prevalence and mortality of those diseases for each 
location, year, sex, and people older than 65 years, and was 
designed to correct for systematic under-reporting of 
dementias as the underlying cause of death in the ICD 
death registry data.
We modelled lower respiratory infection incidence in 
DisMod-MR version 2.1 (DisMod). DisMod is a Bayesian, 
hierarchical meta-regression tool.8 Similar to CODEm, 
DisMod uses space-time information and country-level 
covariates to produce modelled estimates for each age, 
year, location, and sex. DisMod also contains a 
compartmental model that enforces a consistent re- 
lationship between incidence, prevalence, and mortality in 
a series of ordinary differential equations. Input data for 
these models include scientific literature, population 
representative surveys, and hospital and health-care 
utilisation records. We also modelled hospital admissions 
due to lower respiratory infection in DisMod using 
inpatient records exclusively. We expanded the database 
for lower respiratory infection modelling in the 2016 cycle 
to include 133 of these new sources and 9844 new 
datapoints by updating our systematic review from 
Jan 1, 2016, to May 31, 2017
. Because lower respiratory 
infection is seasonal in many places, we introduced a 
method to adjust for data sources that were shorter than a 
year by fitting a sine and cosine model with a period of 
6 months for each GBD region and adjusting the lower 
respiratory infection prevalence on the basis of the 
predicted deviation from the mean. More information on 
this process can be found in the appendix (pp 14–18).
We attributed lower respiratory infection episodes and 
deaths to four aetiologies: S pneumoniae (pneumococcal 
pneumonia), Hib, influenza, and RSV, which were 
identified by expert review for GBD 2010 on the basis of 
the aetiological burden and the available data. 
Aetiologies were estimated population attributable 
fractions (PAFs), which represent the proportional 
reduction in lower respiratory infection morbidity or 
mortality that would be observed if the exposure to the 
pathogen was zero. Aetiological attribution, based on 
counterfactual estimates, accounted for co-infection 
between pathogens and for the distribution of pathogens 
in healthy individuals. Our conterfactual approach to 
aetiological distribution allowed for co-attribution 
between aetiologies, and so PAFs do not sum to 100%. 
We did not attribute aetiologies to neonatal lower 
respiratory infection cases or deaths because of an 
absence of reliable data in this age group, and we did 
not consider Hib in age groups older than 5 years old 
because there were no data on vaccine effectiveness for 
the Hib vaccine in children older than 5 years.
Aetiological attribution
We used a vaccine probe design to estimate the PAF for 
pneumococcal pneumonia and Hib by first calculating 
the ratio of vaccine effectiveness against non-specific 
pneumonia to pathogen-specific pneumonia at the study 
level.9–11 We then adjusted this estimate by vaccine 
coverage, and for pneumococcal pneumonia we adjusted 
for the proportion of pneumococcal serotypes covered by 
the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (ten-valent and 
13-valent), and vaccine effectiveness to estimate country-
specific and year-specific PAF values.12,13 A detailed 
explanation of these calculations is provided in the 
appendix (pp 23, 24). We did not account for

herd immunity in our estimates. We used separate 
pneumococcal pneumonia and Hib age distributions, 
modelled in DisMod, to determine the PAF by age. 
Finally, we estimated PAFs for location and year using 
vaccine coverage modelled estimates.
We estimated the PAF for influenza and respiratory 
syncytial virus by calculating an attributable fraction 
using the following equation:
where OR is the odds ratio of lower respiratory infection 
given pathogen detection14 and Proportion is the 
percentage of lower respiratory infection episodes that 
test positive for influenza (A and B) or RSV.15 We used 
both PCR and non-PCR diagnostic data, and adjusted the 
non-PCR data to be comparable with the PCR data in the 
modelling process (appendix pp 29, 30). We updated a 
systematic literature review to include all data from GBD 
2015 and for papers published between Jan 1, 2015, and 
Dec 31, 2016, and used DisMod to model the proportion 
of lower respiratory infection cases that are positive for 
influenza and RSV, separately, by location, year, age, and 
sex. Because the case fatality ratio for viral lower 
respiratory infection is lower than for bacterial lower 
respiratory infection, we determined a scalar of this 
relationship and adjusted the PAFs accordingly (appendix 
pp 27–30).
Risk factor attribution and decomposition
Methods for risk factor attribution to lower respiratory 
infection are described in detail elsewhere.16,17 Briefly, risk 
factors also followed a PAF counterfactual approach, in 
which we modelled the prevalence of exposure using 
scientific literature and population representative surveys, 
and we modelled the relative risk of lower respiratory 
infection given exposure to that risk factor using 
published meta-analyses. We modelled the exposure level 
in a population for a given risk factor using DisMod and a 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, depending 
on the risk factor.
To assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions for 
each risk factor among children younger than 5 years, we 
took advantage of the counterfactual definition of risk 
factor burden such that the lower respiratory infection 
mortality rate due to each risk factor was equivalent to the 
reduction expected in the complete absence of the risk 
factor. The number needed to treat is an epidemiological 
concept in which the rate of disease in two populations is 
compared.18 Since the counterfactual rate of disease is 
simply the difference between the lower respiratory 
infection mortality rate and the mortality rate due to the 
risk factor, the number needed to treat is the inverse of 
the lower respiratory infection mortality rate due to that 
risk factor (ie, the difference between the observed and 
counterfactual lower respiratory infection mortality rate 
in the absence of the risk factor). We did a decomposition 
analysis of the change in lower respiratory infection 
deaths from 2000–16 using the 12 risk factors associated 
with lower respiratory infection in GBD 2016. We chose 
this time period to show recent changes. We decomposed 
each risk factor independently; the decomposition 
assessed the change in lower respiratory infection 
mortality due to the risk factor, population growth, 
population ageing, and any remaining unexplained 
change in the lower respiratory infection mortality rate. 
This assumed independence overlooks well known 
correlation between risk factors. A combinatorial process 
determined the relative contribution of each component 
to the change in lower respiratory infection DALYs.5,16,19 
We did not incorporate uncertainty into our risk factor 
decomposition.

Results
We estimated that in 2016, lower respiratory infections 
were a leading infectious cause of mortality worldwide in 
children younger than 5 years (under-5; 652 572 deaths, 
95% UI 586 475–720 612), in adults older than 70 years 
(1 080 958 deaths, 943 749–1 170 638), and in people of all 
ages (2 377 697 deaths, 2 145 584–2 512 809; table 1). In 
2016, lower respiratory infections caused 13·1% of all 
deaths in children younger than 5 years (95% UI 
11·8–14·3) and 4·4% of all deaths in people of all ages 
(95% UI 3·9–4·6). Most of the deaths due to lower 
respiratory infection in children younger than 5 years 
occurred in the first year of life (491 900 deaths, 95% UI 
444 000–541 400). Among children younger than 5 years, 
we estimated that there were 68·06 million episodes 
(95% UI 55·29–82·72) in 2016, equivalent to 0·11 cases 
per child-year (95% UI 0·09–0·13; table 1). We estimated 
there were 5 133 000 hospital admissions because of 
lower respiratory infections in 2016, among children 
younger than 5 years (95% UI 3 860 800–6 260 200), and 
65 982 807 hospital admissions due to lower respiratory 
infections among all ages 56 813 819–75 511 038). The 
highest incidence of lower respiratory infection episodes 
among children younger than 5 years occurred in 
Oceania (171·5 per 1000 children, 95% UI 132·2–217·9; 
table 1) and the greatest number of lower respiratory 
infection episodes among children younger than 5 years 
occurred in south Asia (18·76 million [95% UI 
15·58–22·04]). For people of all ages, we estimated that 
there were 336·46 million episodes of lower respiratory 
infection (95% UI 313·08–361·62) in 2016 (table 1). 
Lower respiratory infections were responsible for 
56 107 300 DALYs (95% UI 50 447 100–61 890 000) among

children younger than 5 years, corresponding to 61% of 
the 
total 
91 844 600 
DALYs 
(84 674 400–98 252 600) 
attributable to lower respiratory infections across all ages 
in 2016. The number of deaths due to lower respiratory 
infections decreased by 54·1% (95% UI 48·7–58·9) 
among children younger than 5 years and 13·4% among 
all ages (7·8–13·4) between 2000 and 2016.
Lower respiratory infection mortality in all ages was 
highest in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and southeast 
Asia (figure 1). The highest rates of lower respiratory 
infection mortality among children younger than 
5 years, in 2016, were in the Central African Republic 
(460 per 100 000 people, 95% UI 300–688), Chad (425 per 
100 000 people, 305–576), and Somalia (417 per 
100 000 people, 257–613; appendix p 45). Because of their 
large populations and high absolute mortality, nearly a 
third of all lower respiratory infection deaths in children 
younger than 5 years occurred in India (149 826 deaths, 
95% UI 132 370–167 643) and Nigeria (57 446, 39 276–82 081; 
appendix p 43). The global lower respiratory infection 
mortality rate among children younger than 5 years 
decreased by 57·1% since 2000 (95% UI 52·0–61·5), while 
the incidence of lower respiratory infection decreased 
by 21·4% (18·8–24·3%) over the same time period.
Lower respiratory infection mortality is also high in the 
elderly (table 1, figure 1C). The number of lower respiratory 
infection deaths among adults aged 70 years and older 
increased from 746 700 (95% UI 672 300 to 806 700) 
in 2000, to 1 080 958 (943 749 to 1 170 638) in 2016. However, 
this increase has not been due to an increase in the lower 
respiratory infection mortality rate, which remained 
relatively constant in this age group between 2000 and 2016 
(278·1 deaths per 100 000 people, 95% UI 250·4 to 
300·5 in 2000; 267·4 deaths per 100 000 people, 233·4 to 
290·6 in 2016). Globally, the number of adults older than 
70 years increased by 50·6% between 2000 and 2016, from 
268 522 838 to 404 287 666. Although the mortality rate in 
this age group has not changed appreciably in places like 
Brazil (18·1% increase, 95% UI 9·5 to 26·9) and India 
(7·1% increase, –9·3 to 25·2), or substantially in Thailand 
(78·5% increase, –25·9 to 161·8), the number of adults 
older than 70 years increased by 95·8% in Brazil, 71·2% in 
India, and 89·1% in Thailand between 2000, and 2016, 
and lower respiratory infection death counts have 
increased substantially in the past 16 years (131·2% in 
Brazil, 95% UI 114·5 to 148·5; 83·4% in India, 55·3 to 
114·4; and 237·5% in Thailand, 40·1 to 395·0). As 
countries transition from low-middle to high-middle 
sociodemographic index, the under-5 lower respiratory 
infection mortality rate decreases, but a parallel 
improvement in lower respiratory infection mortality rate 
among the elderly is generally not observed.20
At the global level, the case fatality ratio due to lower 
respiratory infections decreased sharply among under 
5s, from 2·33% (95% UI 2·12–2·55) in 1990, to 0·96% 
(0·87–1·06) in 2016. The countries with the highest case 
fatality ratios were western sub-Saharan Africa (Burkina

and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (Somalia 3·60%, 
2·82–4·24), whereas the lowest occurred in the Balkan 
countries and a few high-income countries (Slovenia 
0·015%, 0·014–0·016; Bosnia and Herzegovina 0·025%, 
0·023–0·027%; and Croatia 0·027%, 0·024–0·029; 
figure 2).
Our analysis showed that, of the four aetiologies 
studied, pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause 
of lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality 
globally and caused more deaths than all other aetiologies 
combined: it was responsible for 1 189 937 deaths 
(95% UI 690 445–1 770 660) and 197·05 million episodes 
(112·83–287·64) in 2016 (table 2). RSV was the second 
leading aetiology of lower respiratory infection deaths 
overall (76 612, 95% UI 55 121–103 503) and 54% of lower 
respiratory infection deaths attributable to RSV occurred 
in children younger than 5 years (41 026, 22 922–65 851), 
similar to the number of under-5 lower respiratory 
infection deaths attributable to Hib (48 011, 13 404–88 744; 
table 2). Hib was not attributed to deaths or episodes in 
people older than 5 years. Influenza is more frequently 
associated with non-fatal lower respiratory infection 
episodes than with fatal episodes. It was responsible 
for the second fewest number of deaths but it was the 
second most common aetiology among LRI episodes 
(39·1 million episodes, 95% UI 30·5–48·4; table 2). 
Hib was not attributed to deaths or episodes in people 
older than 5 years because of insufficient data in these 
age groups. Because of expanded coverage of Hib and 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, in children younger 
than 5 years lower respiratory infection mortality due to 
Hib 
decreased 
by 
5·86% 
and 
LRI 
mortality 
due to pneumococcal pneumonia decreased by 7·24% 
worldwide, with variation in super-region depending on 
the introduction and coverage of the vaccine (figure 3).
Childhood wasting remains the leading risk factor for 
lower respiratory infection mortality among children 
younger than 5 years, responsible for 57·1% of lower 
respiratory infection deaths (95% UI 30·1–66·7) in 2016 
(appendix p 65). However, between 2000, and 2016, a 
decomposition of the contribution of the leading risk 
factors for lower respiratory infection mortality among 
children younger than 5 years showed that the largest 
reduction in lower respiratory infection mortality was due 
to improvements in childhood wasting, which was 
responsible for a 10·3% decrease (146 000 fewer deaths 
than if the prevalence of wasting had remained at the 
same level as in 2000; figure 3). Prevalence of childhood 
wasting improved in most locations; the largest decreases

occurred in Algeria (where a 32·2% decrease in wasting 
prevalence from 2000 to 2016, resulted in 800 fewer deaths 
than if no decrease had occurred) and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (31·1% decrease, 10 700 fewer 
deaths; appendix p 66). We found an exception in 
Madagascar, where a greater prevalence of wasting 
contributed to a 36·0% increase in deaths (4100 excess 
deaths; appendix p 66). The second leading risk factor 
contributing to the reduction of under-5 lower respiratory 
infection mortality was a reduction in household and solid 
fuel air pollution, which were responsible for a 9·6% global 
decrease in deaths (135 000 fewer deaths; appendix p 66). 
Despite this decrease, this shift coincided in many 
locations with an increased exposure to ambient 
particulate matter pollution, which was responsible for a 
3·7% increase in under-5 lower respiratory infection 
mortality (figure 3). In several rapidly developing countries 
in south Asia (Bangladesh, India, and Nepal), reduced 
household pollution contributed to a decrease in lower 
respiratory infection mortality, but ambient particulate 
matter pollution contributed to an increase in lower 
respiratory infection mortality (figure 3; appendix p 66). 
The region as a whole reflected this (5·0% increase due to 
particulate matter pollution and 12·4% decrease due to 
reduced indoor air pollution), with large differences in 
Bangladesh (7·3% increase due to particulate matter 
pollution and 7·5% decrease due to indoor air pollution) 
and India (5% increase due to particulate air pollution and 
13·4% decrease due to indoor air pollution).
Among the countries with the highest lower respiratory 
infection mortality rate, interventions to reduce childhood 
wasting prevalence, improve household and ambient 
particulate matter pollution, and expand antibiotic 
treatment could avert an under-5 death due to lower 
respiratory infection for every 4000 children treated 
(figure 4; appendix p 45). Specifically, for every 1576 children 
who improve their weight-for-height Z score to the global 
mean, one death due to lower respiratory infection could be 
averted (95% UI 1319–2117; figure 4). Household air 
pollution has the second lowest number needed to treat 
globally (2527 needed to treat to avert one death, 95% UI 
1999–3410; figure 4). Despite the fact that antibiotic 
treatment improved in most locations, being responsible 
for a 1·94% global decrease in under-5 lower respiratory 
infection mortality between 2000, and 2016, 30·2% of lower 
respiratory infection deaths among children younger than 
5 years were attributable to lack of antibiotic treatment 
(95% UI 14·4–43·8; appendix p 65), and appropriate 
antibiotic treatment could avert one under-5 death due to 
lower respiratory infection for every 3200 children with 
lower respiratory infection who are treated (95% UI 
2000–7470; figure 4; appendix p 75). Although the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine prevented 52 000 under-5 
lower respiratory infection deaths in 2016, the large 
remaining burden of pneumococcal pneumonia reflects 
the vaccine’s low coverage in high-burden locations and the 
large attributable fraction of pneumococcal pneumonia in 
nearly every geography. Although reducing non-exclusive 
breastfeeding and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke 
are the least efficient interventions at the global level, they 
are more efficient than targeting stunting, underweight, 
and handwashing in central Europe, central Asia, east Asia, 
and Latin America and the Caribbean (figure 4).
Discussion
Summary of findings
Substantial progress has been made to reduce the global 
burden of lower respiratory infections. However, this 
reduction has not been equal across locations, has been 
driven by decreases in several primary risk factors, and 
the burden in elderly adults could be growing and 
requires attention.
Our results suggest that the case fatality ratio among 
children younger than 5 years decreases rapidly with 
increasing sociodemographic development. There are 
several possible explanations for this observation, 
including improved access to health care, decreased 
exposure to disease risk, improved nutrition, and 
possibly improved case management.21 A key goal of the 
GAPPD was universal access to appropriate lower 
respiratory infection case management.3 More than

50% of lower respiratory infection deaths in 2016 were 
attributable to bacterial aetiologies. We found that 
antibiotic use has increased in most locations and 
contributed to a 1·94% decrease in under-5 lower 
respiratory infection mortality. Since the global number 
needed to treat is relatively small (3200), increased access 
to appropriate antibiotics could be an efficient 
intervention in many countries. We estimate that

increased antibiotic availability could still prevent 30·2% 
(95% UI 14·4–43·8) of lower respiratory infection deaths. 
However, 
appropriate 
antibiotic 
use 
remains 
challenging—in large part because of the absence of 
reliable clinical signs and symptoms that can accurately 
predict bacterial pneumonia22,23—and universal use of 
antibiotics for lower respiratory infections could lead to 
antimicrobial resistance.24 Although interventions to 
expand judicious antibiotic use and improve diagnostic 
accuracy might help to mitigate this risk, these efforts 
must be accompanied by interventions to prevent cases 
of lower respiratory infection.

Pneumococcal pneumonia is by far the leading 
aetiology responsible for lower respiratory infection 
incidence and mortality in children and adults. There is 
increasing evidence that S pneumoniae might be a co-
infection or a follow-up infection to viral infections.25 
However, 
given 
our 
counterfactual 
approach 
to 
aetiological attribution, it is possible to interpret our 
results as the expected reduction in lower respiratory 
infection burden in the total absence of an aetiology. 
Because our approach treats aetiological attribution 
independently, it is difficult to assess co-infections. The 
vaccine probe approach to aetiological attribution might 
miss indirect effects of the vaccine in protecting non-
vaccinated people, a phenomenon that has been observed 
for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Despite this 
limitation, we observed a moderate reduction in lower 
respiratory infection mortality in children younger than 5 
years after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine in many countries, and the results suggest that a 
great deal of lower respiratory infection burden could be 
avertable if pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage 
was universal.
Risk factors for childhood undernutrition (stunting, 
wasting, and underweight) are among the leading risk 
factors for lower respiratory infection mortality in 
children younger than 5 years, and are strongly 
associated 
with 
poor 
health 
outcomes.17,26 
This 
association is probably due to impaired immunity 
caused by poor micronutrition and macronutrition. 
There are several reasons why many children in low-
income countries, born underweight or not, tend to 
move further away from the global mean as they age. 
One reason might be a positive reinforcement loop that 
exists between infectious disease incidence, including 
lower respiratory infection and diarrhoea, which leads 
to poor physical growth, subsequently predisposing 
children to future episodes of infectious diseases.27–29 
Breaking these interactions has proved challenging, but 
some countries, such as Algeria, and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, have improved more than others 
with respect to childhood nutrition. This success might 
be due in part to improved maternal education, prenatal 
care, and interventions that target mothers and 
children.30–32 Because lower respiratory infections can 
predispose (through undernutrition) or be concurrent 
with other underlying causes of death, such as HIV, 
there could be an even greater burden of the disease 
since the GBD attributes each death to only one 
underlying cause, which is consistent with the core 
principle of ICD codes reflecting the condition 
responsible for the causal pathway that ends in 
mortality.1,20
Exposure to indoor household solid fuel use and 
ambient particulate matter—the two key components 
of air pollution—varies widely, and they might be 
trending in opposite directions.33 As countries develop 
in sociodemographic index, indoor air pollution tends 
to decrease as cooking shifts from biofuels to natural 
gas and electricity.34 At the same time, rapid proliferation 
of cheap fossil-fuel-based energy has led to much 
greater exposure to ambient particulate matter 
pollution. This paradox is a challenge of development. 
Reducing exposure to both types of air pollution is 
likely to be an efficient means to reduce lower 
respiratory infection mortality among children younger 
than 5 years. These risk factors, while ubiquitous in 
prevalence, have small associations with lower 
respiratory infection risk.33,35–37 Several studies have 
identified only small effects, if any, of household air 
pollution on lower respiratory infection risk, and trials 
investigating indoor air pollution interventions have 
not shown major reductions in lower respiratory 
infection incidence.38–40 Even if the improvements in 
lower respiratory infection mortality are lower than we 
estimated, improving air quality is a worthwhile goal 
for 
cognitive 
development, 
asthma, 
and 
other 
respiratory and cardiac outcomes.33
Our results suggest that nearly three-quarters of lower 
respiratory infection deaths occurred in older children 
and adults, with a particularly high burden in adults 
older than 70 years. Mortality rates in adults older than 
70 years have remained remarkably consistent in most 
regions of the world since 1990, while the population of 
elderly adults has increased globally; there are twice as 
many adults older than 70 years in 2016, compared 
with 1990. Much of the global initative to reduce the 
lower respiratory infection burden has been focused in 
children younger than 5 years, but our results suggest a 
growing need to expand this focus to include elderly 
populations. Further exploration of the effect of 
comorbidities and other risk factors that put older 
adults at risk of lower respiratory infection should be 
investigated, 
and 
exploration 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in elderly populations 
in low-income and middle-income countries LMICs is 
warranted.
Comparison with other estimates
The GBD 2016 estimates of lower respiratory infection 
mortality in children younger than 5 years in 2015 
(700 554, 95% UI 635 081–767 610) were nearly identical to 
the estimates produced for GBD 2015 in the same year 
(703 918, 651 385–763 039; appendix p 32). However, the 
number of lower respiratory infection deaths among 
people of all ages in 2015 (2 388 748, 95% UI 
2 157 662–2 520 283) was smaller than the number of 
deaths estimated for GBD 2015 (2 736 714, 2 500 318–
2 860 843; appendix p 33).5 This discrepancy is partly due 
to changes in the data sources used for lower respiratory 
infection mortality modelling. Notably, in India, reliable 
Sample Registration System data covering all states were 
introduced for GBD 2016. Moreover, a new process 
introduced in GBD 2016 to maintain consistency in 
estimates between cognitive diseases in elderly adults, 
 Articles

www.thelancet.com/infection   Vol 18   November 2018
such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, re-
distributed more lower respiratory infection deaths in 
age groups of adults older than 65 years to those causes 
of death than previously.
Our estimates of lower respiratory infection mortality in 
children younger than 5 years differ from those produced 
by the WHO Department of Evidence, Information and 
Research, and the Maternal and Child Epidemiology 
Estimation (MCEE) group, which estimates deaths due to 
pneumonia. The GBD 2016 estimates for under-5 mortality 
due to pneumonia in 2016 (700 554, 95% UI 635 081–767 610) 
are lower than those from the MCEE (920 136).41,42 The 
source of much of this discrepancy is due to differences in 
the number of deaths in the two highest burden countries, 
India and Nigeria, where differences arise from input data 
and modelling approach (appendix pp 36–38). Our 
estimates of the number of lower respiratory infection 
episodes among children under-5 in 2010 (74 130 000, 
95% UI 60 610 000–89 700 000)43 are about half that of the 
numbers estimated by the MCEE group (120 400 000, 
60 800 000–277 000 000) but with overlap in the 95% 
uncertainty intervals (appendix p 40). The estimates 
produced by the MCEE are informed by the incidence of 
pneumonia in 35 cohort studies, which informed an overall 
incidence of pneumonia that was related to the prevalence 
of five risk factors for pneumonia to estimate country-level 
incidence.44 Although there is overlap in the risk factors 
used in both studies, GBD 2016 used more than 
30 000 datapoints from more than 700 sources to produce 
internally consistent estimates of lower respiratory 
infection incidence, prevalence, and mortality.
Estimates for the aetiologies of lower respiratory 
infection also differ from other recently published 
estimates. Shi and colleagues45 used a modelling strategy 
to estimate RSV incidence using 76 studies and several 
different approaches to defining a case fatality ratio. They 
estimated 59 600 (95% UI 48 000–74 500) deaths due to 
RSV among children younger than 5 years in 2015, and 
potentially 
as 
many 
as 
118 200 
(94 600–149 400), 
depending on model assumptions. By contrast, we 
estimated 41 000 deaths (95% UI 22 900–65 900) in 2016, 
with overlap in the uncertainty intervals. Iuliano and 
colleagues46 estimated between 291 200 and 645 800 deaths 
associated with influenza among people of all ages 
in 2015, much higher than the GBD 2016 estimate 
of 58 200 (44 000–74 200). Although there are several 
differences in the approach to make these estimates, a 
major difference is the definition of an influenza death. 
In GBD 2016, we report the number of lower respiratory 
infection deaths attributable to influenza, whereas 
Iuliano and colleagues reported the number of respiratory 
deaths associated with influenza.46
Data limitations
Our estimates of lower respiratory infection burden are 
limited by data availability. In particular, the regions of 
the world with the highest lower respiratory infection 
morbidity and mortality tend to be the places with the 
poorest data coverage, particularly for lower respiratory 
infection mortality and aetiological attribution. A detailed 
analysis done for GBD 2016 found that nearly all 
countries in Africa had poor vital record data, as 
measured by indices such as completeness and detail,1 
with only Egypt receiving a 3/5 grade (where 1 is worst 
and 5 is best, and 3/5 was the best grade received). Better 
surveillance systems, including standard reporting 
mechanisms and case definitions, in Africa and south 
and southeast Asia would substantially reduce a major 
source of uncertainty in the lower respiratory infection 
mortality 
estimates.47 
The 
predictive 
modelling 
approaches used in GBD 2016 rely on covariates and 
shared information across space and time to fill in these 
areas and the data gaps. Uncertainty is carried through 
each step of the lower respiratory infection modelling 
process and is represented in the uncertainty intervals 
for the results.
In recent years, PCR has become the gold standard for 
respiratory pathogen detection. However, even with the 
improved sensitivity of PCR diagnostic techniques, data 
about lower respiratory infection aetiologies remain 
sparse, partly because of challenges in obtaining 
appropriate samples from the site of infection, detection 
in healthy individuals, and relatively few data about 
aetiologies in adults.48,49 Because of an absence of data in 
older children and adults, we assumed that the relationship 
between RSV and influenza and lower respiratory 
infections are the same in children younger than 5 years 
and in adults, which might not be true. Each iteration of 
the GBD study adds additional data that were either 
previously unidentified or have been published since the 
previous study, and GBD 2016 had an increase of 38% in 
available data for RSV and 20% more for influenza. 
Additionally, the relationship between disease severity, 
disease mortality, and aetiological attribution has not been 
well characterised for all pathogens and settings. 
Additional studies on lower respiratory infection 
aetiologies, including those in adults, which give detailed 
information on diagnostics, sample site, illness severity 
and co-infections, and with more discrete age ranges, are 
needed.
Next steps
The GBD study will be updated annually, with the most 
recent results superseding previous results. This 
approach provides a unique opportunity to be readily 
adaptable to changes in methods, to incorporate new or 
previously unidentified data sources, and to be timely 
with estimates of mortality and morbidity due to lower 
respiratory infection. Lower respiratory infections can be 
frequently associated with sepsis, which has not yet been 
estimated for the GBD. Recommended treatment for 
bacterial lower respiratory infections, with or without 
sepsis, is antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial resistance is 
becoming more widely recognised as a leading global

1207
health threat, and antimicrobial resistant will be 
quantified.
There might be substantial subnational variation in the 
burden of lower respiratory infection within countries. 
For example, an analysis of GBD 2016 focusing on India50 
found a seven-fold variation in lower respiratory infection 
mortality between states. To further investigate such 
variation, work to estimate the burden of lower 
respiratory infection at very fine spatial resolutions, 
similar to estimates of malaria and under-5 mortality,51,52 
will provide detailed evidence to guide policy at the local 
level and direct interventions to where they could affect 
the most change. This type of precision public health 
requires strong surveillance systems, sophisticated 
analytical approaches, and the capacity to act on the 
results.53
Conclusions
Despite noteworthy decreases in the number of deaths 
due to lower respiratory infections since 2000, there 
remains an urgent need to accelerate efforts to reduce 
the burden of disease in the most susceptible populations, 
particularly those with high prevalence of childhood 
undernutrition, exposure to air pollution, and poor 
access to health care. The GBD study provides a 
comprehensive, comparable, scientific set of estimates 
for the burden of lower respiratory infections and these 
estimates provide both a description of the epidemiology 
of the disease and a potential roadmap for continuing to 
reduce the burden of the disease.
