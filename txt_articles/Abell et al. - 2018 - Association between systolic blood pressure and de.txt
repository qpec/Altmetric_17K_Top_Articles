Aims
To examine associations of diastolic and systolic blood pressure (SBP) at age 50, 60, and 70 years with incidence of
dementia, and whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the follow-up mediates this association.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured on 8639 persons (32.5% women) from the Whitehall II co-
hort study in 1985, 1991, 1997, and 2003. Incidence of dementia (n dementia/n total = 385/8639) was ascertained
from electronic health records followed-up until 2017. Cubic splines using continuous blood pressure measures
suggested SBP >
_130 mmHg at age 50 but not at age 60 or 70 was associated with increased risk of dementia, con-
firmed in Cox regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, and time varying
chronic conditions [hazard ratio (HR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.11, 1.70]. Diastolic blood pressure
was not associated with dementia. Participants with longer exposure to hypertension (SBP >
_ 130 mmHg) between
mean ages of 45 and 61 years had an increased risk of dementia compared to those with no or low exposure to
hypertension (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00, 1.66). In multi-state models, SBP >
_ 130 mmHg at 50 years of age was associ-
ated with greater risk of dementia in those free of CVD over the follow-up (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15, 1.87).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Systolic blood pressure >
_130 mmHg at age 50, below the conventional >
_140 mmHg threshold used to define hyper-
tension, is associated with increased risk of dementia; in these persons this excess risk is independent of CVD.

Introduction
Randomized trials on older adults show no effect of lowering of blood
pressure on the risk of dementia.1,2 Age is known to modify the
association between hypertension and dementia.3–6 Observational
data suggest that hypertension in mid-life increases the risk of demen-
tia in later life,7–9 leading it to be included as a putative risk factor in de-
mentia prevention guidelines.10 Nonetheless, there are several

outstanding questions. One, ‘mid-life’ remains poorly characterized in
studies, ranging from 35 to 68years.8,11–13 Two, few studies have
attempted to assess the impact of duration of hypertension using meas-
ures of blood pressure rather than reported use of antihypertensive
medication. Three, it is unclear whether the 140mmHg systolic blood
pressure (SBP) threshold to define hypertension14 in mid-life is appropri-
ate for dementia risk, given age-specific treatment targets recommended
in recent reports aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD).15,16
To address some of these limitations, we examined the association
between measured SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and de-
mentia, focusing on the effects of age, duration of high blood pres-
sure, and threshold of blood pressure to define hypertension in a
large prospective cohort followed for 30 years. We hypothesize that
hypertension in mid-life (at age 50) but not at older ages (age 70), is
associated with risk of dementia. Given evidence of silent strokes and
white matter lesions in those with hypertension,3 a second hypoth-
esis we tested is that the association between hypertension at age 50
and incidence of dementia is only partially explained by clinical CVD
over the follow-up.
Methods
The Whitehall II study is an ongoing study of 6895 men and 3413 women,
aged 35–55 in 1985; follow-ups examinations were conducted in 1991
(n = 8815), 1997 (n = 7870), 2003 (n = 6967), 2007 (n = 6967), 2012
(n = 6318), and 2015 (n = 5632) with each wave taking 2 years to com-
plete. Written informed consent from participants and research ethics
approvals were renewed at each contact; the most recent approval was
from the University College London Hospital Committee on the Ethics
of Human Research, reference number 85/0938.
Blood pressure
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured in the sitting pos-
ition after 5 min of rest, using the Hawksley random-zero sphygmoman-
ometer in 1985, 1991, and 1997 and an OMRON HEM 907 digital
sphygmomanometer in 2003, 2007, and 2012. At each wave, two meas-
ures of SBP and DBP were taken and their mean was used in the analysis.
Use of antihypertensive medication was self-reported at each contact.
Dementia
A comprehensive tracing of electronic health records, involving three data-
bases, was used for dementia ascertainment: hospital episode statistics
(HES) database, the Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS), and the
mortality register using The International Classification of Disease, Tenth
Revision (ICD-10) codes (F00–F04, G30, and G31), record linkage until 31
March 2017. These are national databases: HES and MHSDS contain infor-
mation on both in- and out-patient care, with the latter also including data
on care in the community. The validity of dementia cases in our study is
supported by modelling changes in the global cognitive score in the 10years
before dementia diagnosis (Supplementary material online, Figure S1) as in
studies that use a ‘gold-standard’ dementia ascertainment procedure.17
Covariates
Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, ethnicity (white, non-white),
education, and occupational position.
Health behaviours included smoking status (current, ex-, and never-
smoker); alcohol consumption: non-drinkers, moderate alcohol consumption
(1–14 units/week in women or 1–21 units/week in men), and heavy alcohol
consumption (>14 units/week in women or >21units/week in men), one
unit of alcohol (UK) is defined as 10ml (8g) of pure alcohol; physical activ-
ity (h/week of moderate or vigorous physical activity, categorized as low
<1h, moderate between 1 and 2.5h and high>
_2.5h); and frequency of fruit
and vegetable consumed per week (<once/day, once/day, or >once/day).
Health status. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated from meas-
ured height and weight. Diabetes was determined by fasting glucose
>
_7.0 mmol/l, a 2-h post-load glucose >
_11.1mmol/l, doctor-diagnosed
diabetes, or use of diabetes medication. Coronary heart disease (CHD) by
study specific assessments (12-lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG)
recording, coded using the Minnesota system), self-reported CHD (veri-
fied in medical records), and linkage to HES (The International
Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 410–414, ICD10
codes I20–I25, or procedures K40–K49, K50, K75, U19). Stroke using the
MONICA-Ausburg stroke questionnaire, corroborated in HES (ICD9
430, 431, 434, 436 and ICD10 I60–I64). Atrial fibrillation assessment was
based on data from a 12-lead resting ECG (Mingorec, Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), Minnesota code 8.3 and data from HES
(ICD9 code 427.3 and ICD10 code I48). Heart failure, based on HES
records (ICD10 code I50). Use of medication for CVD was self-reported.
Statistical analysis
We extracted data on blood pressure at ages 50, 60, and 70years for
each participant across the data waves, allowing a ±5year margin for
each age category. The analysis of blood pressure at age 50, 60, and
70years was based on 8639, 7558, and 4989 participants, respectively:
the numbers differ due to non-response, death before age 60 or 70 or
participants not having reached 70years at the end of follow-up. We
used inverse probability weighting (IPW)18 to ensure that analyses at ages
50, 60, and 70 reflected the same set of individuals. The probability of
remaining in the study sample was estimated using data on sociodemo-
graphic, behavioural, cardiometabolic risk factors, chronic conditions,
antihypertensive medication, and dementia status including its interaction
with SBP and DBP and antihypertensive medication. The inverse of these
probabilities were used to weight the data in Cox regression. The analy-
ses, described below, were undertaken using STATA 14.1; the null hy-
pothesis was rejected for two-sided values of P < 0.05.
Age and threshold of blood pressure and incidence of
dementia
We used Cox regression with separate models for age 50, 60, and
70years; the proportional hazard assumption was verified using
Schoenfeld residuals. Date of entry was the date of clinical assessment
from which the hypertension measure was drawn. Participants were cen-
sored at record of dementia, death, or 31 March 2017, whichever
occurred first. We first examined the threshold of blood pressure at ages
50, 60, and 70 using restricted cubic spline regressions with Harrell
knots19; the command xblc20 was used to estimate adjusted HRs for the
association of blood pressure (continuous measure in mmHg) with the
risk of dementia. Once the threshold was identified, we used a dichotom-
ous definition of hypertension to assess associations with dementia. The
basic analysis was adjusted for sociodemographic (Model 1), then behav-
ioural (Model 2), and finally also health-related factors (Model 3).
Duration of hypertension and incidence of dementia
Duration of hypertension status was estimated using data from 1985, 1991,
1997, and 2003 (mean age of participants 44.9years in 1985 and 61.1years
in 2003) on 8313 participants who were alive and free of dementia in 2003
and had at least two assessments of hypertension status. Duration was sum-
marized using group based trajectory modelling, fitted using the command
traj in STATA. The association between hypertension trajectories (low,

increasing, and high) and subsequent incidence of dementia was examined
using Cox regression, with age as the time-scale. Participants were censored
at date of record of dementia, death, or 31 March 2017, whichever
occurred first. The covariates in Models 1, 2, and 3 were as in the previous
analyses and IPW was used to account for missing data.
Role of cardiovascular disease in the association between
hypertension at age 50 and dementia
We examined the mediating role of CVD (stroke and CHD) over the
follow-up in the association between hypertension and incidence of de-
mentia using multi-state models with a Weibull distribution. These mod-
els are an extension of competing risks survival analysis, allowing
simultaneous estimation of the risk associated with hypertension in (i) the
incidence of CVD, (ii) the risk of dementia in those with CVD, and (iii)
the risk of dementia in those free of CVD. Age was used as the timescale,
and models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors. These analyses
were undertaken using R (mstate).
Results
Characteristics of 8639 participants at age 50 are presented in
Table 1 as a function of dementia status over the follow-up. Mean age
at dementia diagnosis was 75.2 (standard deviation= 5.4) years.
Incidence of dementia was associated with lower education, higher
blood pressure, and co-morbidities.
Age and threshold of blood pressure and
incidence of dementia
Continuous measures of blood pressure using cubic splines suggested
increased risk of dementia with higher SBP starting from 130 mmHg
at age 50 (Figure 1, Panel A). In contrast, no association was seen with
SBP at age 60 (Figure 1, Panel B) or age 70 (Figure 1, Panel C). In order
to ensure results were robust to overfitting we categorized SBP
(<110, 110–119, 120–129, 130–139, >
_140) and obtained similar
results (Supplementary material online, Table S1). There was no asso-
ciation between DBP at age 50, 60, or 70years and incidence of de-
mentia (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
In further analyses using Cox regression, SBP >
_130 mmHg at age
50 was associated with increased hazard of dementia in the fully
adjusted model [hazard ratio (HR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.11, 1.70; Table 2]. No association was observed when SBP was
measured at ages 60 or 70 years (Table 2). Further analysis using DBP
threshold >
_90mmHg in addition to SBP to define hypertension
revealed similar results (Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Adding use of antihypertensive medication to SBP to define hyper-
tension yielded results (Supplementary material online, Table S3)
broadly similar to those presented in Table 2. In mutually adjusted mod-
els (data not tabulated), SBP >
_130mmHg at age 50 was associated
with risk of dementia (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.11, 1.70), while use of medica-
tion was not (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75, 1.80). However, at age 60, SBP

_130mmHg was not associated with dementia (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.81,
1.30) but use of antihypertensives was associated with increased risk
(HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.21, 2.18). At age 70, SBP >
_130mmHg was not
associated with dementia (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85, 1.54) and neither was
use of antihypertensives (HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96, 1.82).
Sixteen-year hypertension trajectories
(systolic blood pressure �130 mmHg)
and incidence of dementia
Three hypertension trajectories were identified (model fit statistics in
Supplementary material online, Table S4 and graphical representation
in Supplementary material online, Figure S3): low, increasing, and high
trajectories comprising 48.8%, 18.6%, and 32.7% of participants, re-
spectively. Table 3 shows a higher hazard of dementia (Model 3, HR
1.29, 95% CI 1.00, 1.66) in the high trajectory group compared to
those with low prevalence of hypertension with associations in the
increasing trajectory group (Model 3, HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84, 1.57) not
statistically significant. In trajectories using SBP >
_ 130mmHg and anti-
hypertensive medication to define hypertension results were similar
(Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Role of cardiovascular disease in the
association between hypertension at age
50 and dementia
Figure 2 shows that in multi-state models, hypertension at age 50 was
associated with a 1.34 times increased hazard of CVD (95% CI 1.22,
1.47). The association between hypertension at age 50 and dementia
was not fully explained by CVD as demonstrated by the increased
hazard of dementia in those free of CVD over the follow-up (HR
1.47, 95% CI 1.15, 1.87).
Discussion
The findings of this longitudinal observational study of over 8000
men and women support the hypothesis that hypertension in mid-life
but not late life is associated with increased risk of dementia.3,5 We
show that high SBP at age 50 was associated with increased risk of de-
mentia, much under the conventional 140mmHg threshold used to
define hypertension. In our data, the excess risk was apparent at
around 130mmHg of SBP. Hypertension at age 70 was not associ-
ated with incidence of dementia. Longer exposure to hypertension in
mid-life was associated with increased hazard of dementia. Although
adjustment for CVD attenuated associations between hypertension
at age 50 and dementia; multi-state models show this association to
be present in those free of CVD, suggesting that clinical CVD does
not fully account for the association between hypertension and de-
mentia. These findings, highlighting the importance of elevated systolic
pressure at age 50 as a risk factor for dementia need to be repli-
cated in larger studies to allow elaboration of evidence based
prevention.
The age-specific association between hypertension and dementia
is widely acknowledged.3–5 Several prospective studies show high
blood pressure in mid-life to be associated with increased risk of
dementia,7,9,13 while the evidence of an association between hyper-
tension in late life and dementia is less consistent.21–27 The age
related variation in the association was shown within a single study in
The Adult Changes in Thought Study, where high SBP was associated
with dementia in the youngest age group but no association was
found in older subjects.4 However, previous studies on mid-life
hypertension cover a wide range of ages. In the Honolulu Asia Aging
study, for example, mid-life was defined as ages between 45 and

68years, an age-range greater than two decades.12 Poor character-
ization of the age when hypertension carries a risk is also reflected in
dementia guidelines as they only use the generic term ‘mid-life’.10
Our data show considerable differences in dementia risk over the
two decade age-span, elevated SBP at age 50 but not at age 60
increased risk of dementia.
One of the key reasons proposed for the importance of mid-life
hypertension on brain health is due to duration of exposure, as those
with hypertension at age 50 are likely to be ‘exposed’ for longer.3
Direct assessment of duration of hypertensive status over many years
is rare; many studies use a single measure of hypertension. An excep-
tion is the AGES study which used two measures of hypertension to
examine the interaction between mid-life hypertension and late-life
hypertension, separated by 26years.28 They found that mid-life
hypertension modifies the relationship between late-life blood pres-
sure and cognitive performance.28 However, this study had no infor-
mation on hypertension status between these two assessments and
therefore the protective effects of later life hypertension may reflect
a shorter duration of hypertension.29
Hypertension is currently classified by SBP or DBP >
_140/
90mmHg although in the majority of studies in this area a higher
threshold (160/95 mmHg) has been used to define hypertension.5
However, age-specific treatment targets are being suggested for the
reduction of CVD
risk
with
a
recent
recommendation
of
SBP < 120mmHg for those 50years and younger.16 Trial data on the
benefits of reducing SBP on cognitive outcomes is not conclusive;
however, all the research in this domain is based on older adults and
whether better control of blood pressure at younger ages modifies
risk for dementia is unknown.
Hypertension is known to be associated with silent strokes, white
matter lesions, and impairment of cerebral circulation leading to is-
chaemic injury.3 This suggests that part of the association of hyper-
tension with dementia may not be explained by clinical CVD, a
hypothesis that we were able to test using multi-state models which
allow incorporation of both incident CVD and dementia over the
follow-up. Our results show excess risk of dementia is also present in
those free of CVD. These results suggest that subclinical or ‘silent’
vascular brain lesions (i.e. infarcts, microbleeds, white matter
changes), which are common in those with hypertension may be
involved in increased dementia risk in those with high blood pressure
who do not have clinical CVD.3 Thus, cerebral small vessel disease is
likely to be an important mechanism underlying the association of
high blood pressure and cognitive dysfunction.
A limitation of the study is use of linkage to electronic health
records for dementia ascertainment, a method that has high specifi-
city but is likely to miss milder cases of dementia.30 There was no evi-
dence in our data that hypertension affected age of dementia
diagnosis, it was 75.3 and 75.2years in groups defined by
SBP>
_ 130 mmHg (yes/no) at age 50 (P = 0.85). Thus, any misclassifi-
cation of dementia status is likely to be random, i.e. the probability of
dementia status being misclassified is independent of hypertension at
age 50. Under conditions of high specificity, the association between
risk factor and outcome is unlikely to be biased by under-
ascertainment of the outcome.16 Furthermore, under-ascertainment
of dementia is unlikely to lead to the age-specific patterns observed
in our study. Another limitation is that we were not able to examine
whether the association of hypertension was stronger with
Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia due to small numbers. Random
measurement error in the blood pressure readings may have diluted
associations but it is unlikely to lead to the pattern of results
observed for SBP at 50, 60, and 70 years. Finally, residual confounding
cannot be ruled out in observational studies but it is unlikely that bias
would lead to the pattern of results observed in our study.
Strengths of the study are linked to the availability of repeat data
on blood pressure and a long follow-up for dementia. Thus, both
‘timing’ and ‘duration’ which seem to be key to understanding the
role of hypertension in dementia,3 could be examined. However,
some misclassification is possible as blood pressure was assessed
only every 4 years, and we did not have data on ambulatory blood
pressure. A further strength is use of measured blood pressure ra-
ther than self-reported antihypertensive use to define hypertension,
ensuring that reporting or non-compliance which can be consider-
able in observational studies do not bias our results. This approach
also allows the development of clear neuroprotective guidelines,
contributing to the debate on the correct target for blood pres-
sure.16 Finally, the use of IPW ensures that missing data do not affect
results, as they are known to be more common in those at greater
risk of adverse health outcomes.18
Conclusion
Hypertension is a known risk factor for CVD, renal failure, and pre-
mature mortality. It is also highly prevalent; number of persons with
elevated SBP continues to increase globally and may affect dementia
risk either directly or via processes related to CVD. Our study high-
lights the detrimental effects of mid-life hypertension, here at age
50 years, and increase in risk at levels below that used to treat SBP.

ease (stroke or coronary heart disease). Analyses with age as time-
