ABSTRACT
Background: Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) onset-persistence is thought to
vary significantly by trauma type, most epidemiological surveys are incapable of assessing
this because they evaluate lifetime PTSD only for traumas nominated by respondents as their
‘worst.’
Objective: To review research on associations of trauma type with PTSD in the WHO World
Mental Health (WMH) surveys, a series of epidemiological surveys that obtained representa-
tive data on trauma-specific PTSD.
Method: WMH Surveys in 24 countries (n = 68,894) assessed 29 lifetime traumas and
evaluated PTSD twice for each respondent: once for the ‘worst’ lifetime trauma and separately
for a randomly-selected trauma with weighting to adjust for individual differences in trauma
exposures. PTSD onset-persistence was evaluated with the WHO Composite International
Diagnostic Interview.
Results: In total, 70.4% of respondents experienced lifetime traumas, with exposure aver-
aging 3.2 traumas per capita. Substantial between-trauma differences were found in PTSD
onset but less in persistence. Traumas involving interpersonal violence had highest risk.
Burden of PTSD, determined by multiplying trauma prevalence by trauma-specific PTSD risk
and persistence, was 77.7 person-years/100 respondents. The trauma types with highest
proportions of this burden were rape (13.1%), other sexual assault (15.1%), being stalked
(9.8%), and unexpected death of a loved one (11.6%). The first three of these four represent
relatively uncommon traumas with high PTSD risk and the last a very common trauma with
low PTSD risk. The broad category of intimate partner sexual violence accounted for nearly
42.7% of all person-years with PTSD. Prior trauma history predicted both future trauma
exposure and future PTSD risk.

 Conclusions: Trauma exposure is common throughout the world, unequally distributed, and
differential across trauma types with respect to PTSD risk. Although a substantial minority of
PTSD cases remits within months after onset, mean symptom duration is considerably longer
than previously recognized.
1. Introduction
The fact that only a small minority of people in the
population develops post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) (Atwoli, Stein, Koenen, & McLaughlin,
2015) even though the vast majority are exposed to
traumas at some time in their life (Benjet et al., 2016)
has raised questions about individual differences in
psychological vulnerability to PTSD. These questions
are the subject of considerable research (Liberzon &
Abelson, 2016; Sayed, Iacoviello, & Charney, 2015;
Smoller, 2016). One prior consideration is the possi-
bility that PTSD risk varies significantly by trauma
type. Such differences have been documented, with
highest PTSD risk thought to occur after traumas
involving
interpersonal
violence
(Caramanica,
Brackbill, Stellman, & Farfel, 2015; Fossion et al.,
2015). A related line of research suggests that trauma
history is a risk factor for subsequent PTSD, with
prior traumas involving violence again possibly of
special importance (Lowe, Walsh, Uddin, Galea, &
Koenen, 2014; Smith, Summers, Dillon, & Cougle,
2016). Few studies estimating these differences across
trauma types did so using unbiased methods, raising
questions about the validity of results regarding these
differences. The issue of biasedness comes up because
of a common data collection convention in general
population epidemiological studies of PTSD whereby
respondents are asked about lifetime exposure to each
of a wide range of traumas but then assessed for
PTSD only for the one trauma nominated by the
respondent as their worst or most upsetting lifetime
trauma. This approach makes it impossible to esti-
mate conditional risk of PTSD after trauma exposure
without upward bias because the traumas for which
PTSD is assessed are atypically severe.
One approach to deal with this problem is to assess
PTSD twice for epidemiological survey respondents
who report experiencing multiple lifetime traumas:
once for the trauma nominated by the respondent as
their worst lifetime trauma and a second time for a
random trauma (i.e. one randomly-selected occur-
rence of one randomly-selected trauma type). By
weighting the random trauma reports by the inverse
of their probabilities of selection at the individual level
and combining these weighted reports with reports
about the worst lifetime trauma, a representative sam-
ple can be generated of all lifetime traumas experi-
enced by all survey respondents. The weight would
be 1 for respondents who reported lifetime exposure
to only one occurrence of one trauma type.
This weighted sample of trauma occurrences can
then be used to obtain estimates both of the distribu-
tion of trauma exposure in the population and the
conditional probability of PTSD after exposure to
traumas of different types. These estimates are
unbiased if the model is correct, although they will
still be subject to the biases of recall error. The
current paper reports data on between-trauma differ-
ences in the distribution of trauma exposure by
trauma type and the risk of PTSD associated with
each trauma type in the WHO World Mental Health
(WMH) surveys. The WMH Surveys are a series of
community epidemiological surveys that used this
weighting scheme to generate a representative sample
of trauma occurrences in the general population of
participating countries (Liu et al., 2017).
We begin by reporting results on overall lifetime
prevalence and basic socio-demographic correlates of
trauma exposure in the population. We break down
traumas into a number of different types for this
purpose. We then examine conditional risk of PTSD
after trauma exposure and compare this risk across
trauma types. We also examine a number of predic-
tors of PTSD risk among people exposed to traumas
controlling for trauma type, including socio-demo-
graphic predictors, information about prior trauma
exposure, and information about history of mental
disorder before exposure to the focal trauma. Next,
we examine data on the typical course of PTSD; that
is, on the duration of PTSD episodes. We examine
the same range of predictors of duration as for onset.
Finally, we combine all of the above information into
a consolidated portrait of the population burden of
PTSD broken down by trauma type. This consoli-
dated portrait takes into consideration differences
across traumas in prevalence, conditional risk of
PTSD, and the duration of PTSD.
2. Methods and materials
2.1. Sample
The WMH Surveys are a coordinated series of cross-
national community epidemiological surveys using
consistent sampling, field procedures, and instru-
ments designed to facilitate pooled cross-national
analyses of prevalence and correlates of common
mental disorders (Kessler & Ustun, 2008). The subset
of 26 WMH Surveys considered in this paper are
those that assessed lifetime PTSD after both worst
and random traumas. Five of the surveys were carried

 out in low/lower-middle income countries (People’s
Republic of China [PRC], Colombia, Nigeria, Peru,
Ukraine), seven in upper-middle income countries
(Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia [administered after the
previously-mentioned Colombian survey, when the
country income rating had increased], Lebanon,
Mexico, Romania, South Africa), and 14 in high
income
countries
(Australia,
Belgium,
France,
Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Spain [separate
national and regional surveys], USA). Each survey
was based on a multi-stage clustered area probability
sample of adult household residents. Three of the 26
surveys included the urbanized area of their countries
(Colombia, Mexico, Peru), and five were based in
specific Metropolitan areas (Beijing and Shanghai,
PRC; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Medellin, Colombia; Murcia,
Spain; six cities in Japan). The Nigerian survey was
restricted to specific regions and the other 17 the
entire country. More details about the samples are
presented in Table 1 (Stein, de Jonge, Kessler, &
Scott, in press).
WMH interviews were administered face-to-face
in respondent homes by trained lay interviewers
after obtaining informed consent using procedures
approved by local Institutional Review Boards. The
response rate had a weighted (by sample size) mean
of 70.4% across surveys (between 45.9% in France
and 97.2% in Medellin). The interviews were in two
parts.
Part
I,
administered
to
all
respondents
(n = 125,718), assessed core DSM-IV mental dis-
orders. Part II, administered to all Part I respon-
dents
with
core
disorders
and
a
probability
subsample of other respondents (n = 68,894),
assessed
additional
disorders
and
correlates.
Traumas and PTSD were assessed in Part II. The
analysis sample considered here includes the 50,855
Part II respondents who reported lifetime trauma
exposure. As detailed elsewhere (Heeringa et al.,
2008), this sample was weighted to match popula-
tion
geographic/socio-demographic
distributions
and to adjust for under-sampling of Part I non-
cases.
2.2. Measures
Traumas: A total of 29 trauma types were assessed,
with reports of lifetime exposure followed by ques-
tions about number of lifetime occurrences and age at
first occurrence of each type. Traumas were divided
into seven categories for purposes of analysis: seven
related to war (e.g. combatant, civilian in war zone,
relief worker, refugee); four related to physical vio-
lence (e.g. physically abused by a caregiver as a child,
mugged); four related to intimate partner or sexual
violence (raped, sexually assaulted, stalked, physically
abused by a romantic partner); seven related to acci-
dents (toxic chemical spill, other man-made disaster,
natural disaster, life-threatening motor vehicle colli-
sion, other accident where the respondent acciden-
tally caused serious injury to another person, other
life-threatening
accident,
life-threatening
illness);
unexpected or traumatic death of a loved one; four
related to traumas that happened to other people
(child had life-threatening illness, other traumas that
occurred to loved ones, witnessed physical fights at
home as a child, witnessed any other trauma); and a
residual category of ‘other’ traumas. The latter cate-
gory included responses to two questions: (i) an
open-ended question: Did you ever experience any
other extremely traumatic or life-threatening event
that I haven’t asked you about? that was backcoded
into the other six categories whenever possible and
the residual reports coded in an ‘other’ category; and
(ii) a question about a ‘private’ trauma: Sometimes
people have experiences they don’t want to talk about
in interviews. I won’t ask you to describe anything like
this but, without telling me what it was, did you ever
have a traumatic event that you didn’t tell me about
because you didn’t want to talk about it? As shown
below, a surprisingly large number of respondents
answered this question affirmatively.
PTSD: DSM-IV PTSD was assessed with the
Composite
International
Diagnostic
Interview
(CIDI) (Kessler & Ustün, 2004), a fully-structured
lay interview that assesses a wide range of common
mental disorders. As noted in the Introduction, PTSD

cMost WMH Surveys are based on stratified multistage clustered area probability household samples in which samples of areas equivalent to counties or
municipalities in the US were selected in the first stage followed by one or more subsequent stages of geographic sampling (e.g. towns within
counties, blocks within towns, households within blocks) to arrive at a sample of households, in each of which a listing of household members was
created and one or two people were selected from this listing to be interviewed. No substitution was allowed when the originally sampled household
resident could not be interviewed. These household samples were selected from Census area data in all countries other than France (where telephone
directories were used to select households) and the Netherlands (where postal registries were used to select households). Several WMH Surveys
(Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain-Murcia) used municipal or universal health-care registries to select respondents without listing households. The
Japanese sample is the only totally un-clustered sample, with households randomly-selected in each of the 11 metropolitan areas and one random
respondent selected in each sample household: 17 of the 27 surveys are based on nationally representative household samples.
dThe response rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of households in which an interview was completed to the number of households originally
sampled, excluding from the denominator households known not to be eligible either because of being vacant at the time of initial contact or
because the residents were unable to speak the designated languages of the survey. The weighted average response rate is 70.4%

 was assessed separately for one random occurrence of
one randomly-selected trauma type reported by each
respondent selected using a random numbers table
for
that
respondent
(the
respondent’s
random
trauma) and separately for the respondent’s self-
reported worst trauma. When DSM-IV/CIDI criteria
for PTSD were met, the respondent was asked how
long symptoms persisted and if the symptoms were
still present at the time of interview. Clinical reap-
praisal interviews with the SCID (Haro et al., 2006)
blinded to CIDI diagnoses of PTSD (but instructed to
focus on the same trauma as the one assessed in the
CIDI in order to guarantee valid comparison of diag-
noses) documented moderate CIDI–SCID concor-
dance
(Landis
&
Koch,
1977)
(AUC
=
.69).
Sensitivity and specificity were 38.3% and 99.1%,
respectively, resulting in a likelihood ratio positive
(Sensitivity/[1-Specificity]) of 42.0 that is well above
the 10.0 typically considered definitive for a positive
screen (Gardner & Altman, 2000). Based on these
operating characteristics, a very high proportion of
CIDI cases (86.1%) were confirmed by the SCID.
2.3. Analysis methods
Cross-tabulations were used to estimate the distribu-
tion of lifetime trauma exposure at the individual
level and to examine the distribution of trauma expo-
sure as well as conditional risk of PTSD associated
with each trauma type in this trauma-level dataset.
Means were calculated within subsamples to estimate
average number of trauma occurrences given any.
Discrete-time survival analysis with time-varying pre-
dictors was used to examine the socio-demographic
and prior trauma predictors of each type of trauma
exposure and the predictors of persistence of PTSD
among cases. As noted in the Introduction, random
trauma reports were weighted by the inverse of ran-
dom trauma probability of selection multiplied by the
respondent’s Part II weight to generate a sample
representative of all traumas experienced by all
respondents. Logistic regression analysis was used to
examine predictors of conditional risk of PTSD
among the trauma-exposed. Design-adjusted stan-
dard errors were used to assess significance of indi-
vidual predictors and design-based Wald χ2 tests to
evaluate the significance of predictor sets.
3. Results
3.1. Prevalence and distribution of trauma
exposure
Lifetime exposure to one or more traumas was reported
by a weighted 70.4% of Part II WMH respondents
(n = 50,855, with 51,196 random and/or worst events;
Table 2). Mean number of lifetime trauma types among
those with any was 2.9, for 2.0 trauma types for capita
(i.e. .704 × 2.9). The distribution of number of types
among respondents with any was 32.1% one, 23.4%
two, 16.6% three, 10.7% four, 6.5% five, 3.9% six, 2.5%
seven, and 4.3% more than seven. By far the most
common trauma types were unexpected death of a
loved one (reported by 31.4% of respondents) and
direct exposure to (i.e. witnessing or discovering)
death or serious injury (23.7%). The next most common
trauma types at the respondent level were muggings
(14.5%),
life-threatening
automobile
accidents
(14.0%),
and
life-threatening
illnesses
(11.8%).
‘Private’ traumas were reported by 4.9% of respondents.
When considered in terms of broader categories, the
most common traumas at the respondent level were
those that either occurred to a loved one or were wit-
nessed (35.7% of respondents), those involving acci-
dents (34.3%), and unexpected death of a loved one
(31.4%) followed by physical violence (22.9%), intimate
partner sexual violence (14.0%), war-related traumas
(13.1%), and ‘other’ traumas (8.4%).
The above results do not take into consideration the
fact that mean number of exposures varies significantly
across trauma types for the 20 traumas that were
assessed for frequency (χ2
19 = 11,729.9, p < .001). (The
other trauma types were not assessed for frequency
because they represented ongoing situations rather
than discrete events.) When we multiply the proportion
of respondents with any lifetime exposure to a given
trauma type by mean number of exposures among
those with any, we find a mean number of exposures
to any trauma among people with any of 4.6. This
translates into 3.2 lifetime trauma exposures per capita
(i.e. .704 with any exposure × 4.6). The distribution of
number of trauma occurrences among respondents
with any was 25.8% one, 18.0% two, 12.9% three, 9.6%
four, 7.0% five, 5.4% six, 4.2% seven, 3.2% eight, 2.4%
nine, 2.2% 10, 4.7% 11–14, and 4.5% 15 or more. The
most common traumas are those that happen to other
people, either unexpected death of a loved one (16.5%
of all traumas) or other traumas that happened to a
loved one or that the respondent witnessed (25.0%),
collectively accounting for over 40% of all trauma expo-
sures. Another 24.6% are accidents and another roughly
one-quarter involve either intimate partner sexual vio-
lence (9.8%) or physical violence (13.8%). The remain-
ing categories of war-related (7.4%) and ‘other’ (2.8%)
traumas are much less common.
3.2. Socio-demographic predictors of trauma
exposure
Socio-demographic predictors of trauma exposure in
the WMH data have been reported previously (Benjet
et al., 2016). Using survival analysis, these analyses
showed that women are much more likely than men
to be exposed to intimate partner sexual violence (OR
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
5
 2.3), roughly equal to men in odds of unexpected
death of a loved one (OR 1.1), and significantly less
likely than men to experience any of the other spe-
cific trauma types considered in our analysis (OR
0.4–0.8). Currently married respondents have signifi-
cantly reduced odds of the vast majority of trauma
types (OR 0.5–0.9) compared to the never married,
while low education is associated with somewhat
elevated risk of some (e.g. violence, accidents, natural
disasters) but not all (e.g. unexpected death of a loved
one) types of trauma.
Perhaps the most interesting socio-demographic
correlate of trauma exposure is age. Age-of-occur-
rence curves in Figure 1 show that traumas associated
with interpersonal violence have earliest median age-
of-occurrence (age 17) followed by intimate partner
sexual violence (age 18), war-related traumas (age
20), and traumas that happened to other people
(age 20). Accidents, unexpected death of loved ones,
and other traumas have later median ages-of-occur-
rence (ages 24–31).
3.3. Differential risk of PTSD depending on
trauma type
As detailed in another recent WMH report (Liu et al.,
2017), conditional risk of DSM-IV/CIDI PTSD after
trauma exposure is 4.0%, but varies significantly by
Table 2. Prevalence and distribution of lifetime traumas in the WMH Surveys (n = 68,894).

 trauma type. (Table 3) The highest conditional risk is
associated with being raped (19.0%), physical abuse
by a romantic partner (11.7%), being kidnapped
(11.0%), and being sexually assaulted other than
rape (10.5%). In terms of broader categories, the
traumas associated with the highest PTSD risk are
those involving intimate partner sexual violence
(11.4%) and other traumas (9.2%), with aggregate
conditional risk much lower in the other broad
trauma categories (2.0–5.4%).
Prevalence of trauma exposure and conditional risk
of PTSD both need to be considered in evaluating the
trauma-specific population burden of PTSD. Given
that 3.2 trauma exposures occur per capita in the
population, the 4.0% aggregate conditional risk of
PTSD translates into 12.9 lifetime episodes of PTSD
per 100 people in the population. The trauma type
associated with by far the highest number of these
PTSD cases is unexpected death of a loved one (2.9
episodes of PTSD/100 population; 22.2% of all lifetime
episodes of PTSD), with rape (1.1 episodes of PTSD/
100 population; 8.6% of all lifetime episodes) and sex-
ual assault other than rape (1.2 episodes of PTSD/100
population; 9.5% of all lifetime episodes) together
accounting for another 18.1% of lifetime episodes.
Unexpected death is a very common type of trauma
(53.2 lifetime occurrences/100 population; 16.5% of all
lifetime traumas) with a high-average conditional risk
of PTSD (5.4%), whereas rape and other sexual assault
are less common (5.8–11.7 lifetime occurrences/100
population; 1.8–3.6% of all lifetime traumas) with
much higher conditional risks of PTSD (19.0–10.5%).

 Four of the six trauma types associated with high-
est population proportions of lifetime PTSD episodes
are in the category of intimate partner sexual vio-
lence. These include 4.1% of all lifetime PTSD epi-
sodes associated with physical abuse by a romantic
partner, 8.6% with rape, 9.5% with other sexual
assault, and 5.6% with being stalked, for a total of
27.8% of all lifetime episodes of PTSD. Intimate part-
ner sexual traumas account for 9.8% of all lifetime
trauma exposures and are associated with compara-
tively high conditional risk of PTSD. The only other
trauma types accounting for as many cases of PTSD
are the two most commonly-occurring traumas con-
sidered here: unexpected death of a loved one (22.2%
of all cases of PTSD) which, as noted above, is the
second most common trauma (16.5% of all traumas)
associated with high-average conditional risk of
PTSD, and direct exposure to death or serious injury
(5.5% of all cases of PTSD), which is the most com-
mon trauma (16.8% of all traumas) and is associated
with a comparatively low risk of PTSD (1.3%).
3.4. Socio-demographic predictors of PTSD
conditional on trauma exposure
Controlling for trauma type, conditional PTSD risk is
significantly associated with age, with risk highest dur-
ing childhood–adolescence and ages 65+. Consistent
with much previous research (reviewed by Olff,
Langeland, Draijer, & Gersons, 2007; Tolin & Foa,
2006), women are significantly more likely to develop
PTSD than are men exposed to the same traumas. We
also looked at socio-economic status and marital status
but found that they are not significant predictors of
PTSD after controlling trauma type and respondent
age–sex.
3.5. Associations of prior trauma exposure with
subsequent PTSD
The literature suggests that people with a history of
prior trauma exposure are more likely than others to
develop PTSD after exposure to subsequent traumas
(Breslau, Peterson, & Shultz, 2008; Caramanica et al.,
2015). Consistent with this evidence, a previous
WMH report found that the vast majority of prior
trauma types are significantly and positively asso-
ciated with subsequent trauma exposure (Benjet
et al., 2016). The strongest of these associations
(OR = 2.0–2.5) are for one type of physical violence
(e.g. physical abuse in childhood) predicting other
types of subsequent physical violence (e.g. being
mugged) and intimate partner sexual violence.
As detailed in a recent WMH report (Liu et al.,
2017), the WMH random trauma analysis replicated
earlier studies in showing that history of prior trauma
exposure predicts increased vulnerability to PTSD
after subsequent traumas, but also went beyond pre-
vious studies in several important ways. First, this
association was found to be limited to prior traumas
involving physical or sexual violence (OR = 1.3–2.5).
Second, the vulnerability to future PTSD associated
with these prior traumas was found to be ‘generalized’
in the sense that it existed across the full range of
random trauma types considered in the analysis.
Third, there was evidence for two more specific types
of vulnerability associated with prior lifetime exposure
to the same trauma types as in the random traumas.
One involved history of traumas involving physical
violence, which was associated with significantly ele-
vated odds of PTSD after subsequent re-exposure to
the same trauma types (OR 3.2). This means that it is
recurrent physical violence that is most strongly asso-
ciated with high PTSD risk. The other involved history
of traumas involving participation in sectarian vio-
lence (e.g. combat experience, purposefully injured
or killed someone), which was associated with signifi-
cantly reduced odds of PTSD after subsequent re-
exposure to the same trauma types (OR 0.3). The last
of these results might seem counter-intuitive given
that military personnel and first responders working
in situations of high trauma exposure are known to be
at elevated risk of PTSD (Gates et al., 2012; Wilson,
2015). However, it is important to recognize that the
result refers to PTSD after re-exposure, which is quite a
different thing than PTSD after initial exposure. As
reviewed below in the discussion section, this finding
of prior experience helping to protect against the
effects of sectarian violence is consistent with previous
literature.
3.6. Persistence of PTSD symptoms
The results reported up to now focused on lifetime
prevalence. However, population burden is more
directly a function of point prevalence. And point
prevalence is a joint function of lifetime prevalence
and persistence. A recent comprehensive review of the
literature on PTSD remission concluded that roughly
half of PTSD cases remit within six months and that
probability of remission does not vary dramatically
across trauma types (Morina, Wicherts, Lobbrecht, &
Priebe, 2014). We were able to investigate this issue in
the WMH data by asking respondents with a history of
PTSD associated with randomly-selected traumas to
report on duration of symptoms and whether they still
had symptoms at the time of interview. Mean duration
of PTSD symptoms (Table 4) averages approximately
six years (72.3 months) across all traumas but varies
greatly depending on trauma type from a high of over
13 years for traumas involving combat experience in
war to a low of about one year for traumas involving
exposure to a natural disaster. It is noteworthy that
WMH
respondents

asked

 continued to have any symptoms, so these duration
estimates are for symptoms rather than for meeting
full PTSD criteria. Speed-of-recovery curves (Figure 2)
show that means in Table 4 are influenced by long
right tails, with 25–40% of cases of PTSD recovering
within one year, many of them within six months, the
major exception being a much lower rate of rapid
recovery among people with war-related PTSD. A
smaller proportion of cases persists for many years.
The longest median duration is five years for PTSD
symptoms associated with war-related traumas fol-
lowed by three years for traumas involving physical
or intimate partner sexual violence. Median durations
are one to two years, in comparison, for PTSD symp-
toms due to the other broad trauma categories.
We also looked for socio-demographic predictors
of PTSD symptom duration. None were significant in
the total sample of cases. However, we lacked the
statistical power to investigate the possibility that
these predictors vary depending on trauma type.
Such variation has been documented in focused stu-
dies. For example, a large prospective study of victims
of Hurricane Katrina found that socio-economic sta-
tus was a significant predictor of speed of PTSD
recovery after that natural disaster (McLaughlin
et al., 2011). Previous research on the predictors of
recovery in trauma-specific samples have focused lar-
gely on trauma characteristics and prior psycho-
pathology (Atwoli et al., 2017; Bromet et al., 2017;
Stein et al., 2016), neither of which was considered in

aThe mean duration (in months) of PTSD episodes associated with the trauma type indicated in the row heading. Recovery was defined as the number
of months until the respondent stopped having any symptoms. For example, respondents with a history of PTSD due to combat experience reported
that symptoms continued for a mean of 161.7 months (13.5 years).
bThe number of lifetime episodes of PTSD due to the trauma type indicated in the row heading per 100 respondents from the third column in Table 3
multiplied by the mean duration (in years) from the first column of Table 4. For example, the 0.7 lifetime episodes of PTSD due to war-related traumas
per 100 respondents multiplied by the mean 6.8 years per episode results in 5.7 (0.8 × 6.8) years of PTSD due to this category of traumas per 100
respondents.
cThe ratio of the entry in the cell of the previous column to the total 77.7 years of PTSD due to any trauma for every 100 respondents. For example, the
5.7 years of war-related PTSD represent 7.3% of the 77.7 total.

 the aggregate WMH analyses due to the small num-
bers of cases associated with each trauma type.
Our most direct estimate of the population burden
of PTSD associated with each trauma type is the num-
ber of years of PTSD at the population level associated
with that trauma type. An estimate of the latter can be
obtained by multiplying number of lifetime PTSD
episodes/100 population by mean duration. When
this is done and the trauma-specific products are
summed across all trauma types we estimate that
there are 77.7 lifetime person-years of PTSD in the
population per 100 respondents. The four trauma
types with the highest proportions of these person-
years are rape (13.1%; 10.2 person-years per 100
respondents), other sexual assault (15.1%; 11.7 per-
son-years per 100 respondents), being stalked (9.8%;
7.6 person-years per 100 respondents), and unex-
pected death of a loved one (11.6%; 9.0 person-years
per 100 respondents). The broad category of intimate
partner sexual violence accounts for nearly 42.7% of all
person-years with PTSD in the population (33.2 per-
son-years per 100 respondents).
4. Discussion
The WMH results are limited in a number of ways.
For one, lifetime prevalence estimates of trauma
exposure are likely to be conservative due to recall
error (Belli, 2014). In addition, some traumas are
likely to be systematically under-reported because
they are embarrassing or otherwise culturally sensi-
tive (Schaeffer, 2000). Both types of problems can
be reduced, although not entirely overcome, with
data collection enhancements. Recall failure can be
reduced by using memory priming strategies and
event history calendars to focus memory search
(Drasch & Matthes, 2013). Conscious nondisclosure
can be reduced by increasing anonymity; for exam-
ple, by having respondents privately record sensi-
tive information in a self-report booklet that is
sealed before returning it to the interviewer or via
private computerized self-administration (Gnambs
& Kaspar, 2015). There is some concern that
complete
anonymity
can
reduce
motivation
to
report accurately (Lelkes, Krosnick, Marx, Judd, &
Park, 2012). These strategies were not used in the
WMH Surveys, so we have to consider the WMH
trauma exposure prevalence estimates as lower-
bound estimates.
Another limitation of the WMH results involves
the diagnoses of lifetime PTSD. These diagnoses are
limited by being based on retrospective reports
obtained in a cross-sectional survey using a fully-
structured
lay-administered
diagnostic
interview
rather than a semi-structured clinician-administered
diagnostic interview. The WMH clinical reappraisal
study shows that PTSD prevalence is under-estimated
in the CIDI compared to blinded semi-structured
clinical interviews but that the vast majority of CIDI
cases are confirmed in these clinical reappraisal inter-
views (Haro et al., 2006), suggesting that the WMH
prevalence estimates are conservative. WMH results
regarding PTSD persistence, in comparison, are anti-
conservative because they assess persistence of any
symptom rather than of the full PTSD syndrome.
Results regarding predictors, finally, are limited by
excluding prior psychopathology, which is known to
be the strongest predictor of PTSD onset given
trauma type (DiGangi et al., 2013; Sayed et al.,
2015), and trauma characteristics-sequelae, which
are known to be strong predictors of persistence
(Morina et al., 2014).
Within the context of these limitations, our find-
ing that 70.4% of respondents were exposed to one or
more traumas at some time in their life is broadly
consistent with previous research reviewed elsewhere
(Benjet et al., 2016) documenting that the majority of
people in the general population have experienced
traumas. However, WMH went beyond previous stu-
dies in assessing frequency of exposure, documenting
that trauma exposure is even more common than
previously known, with a per capita mean of 2.0
trauma types and 4.6 trauma exposures. These esti-
mates are conservative as they are based on calcula-
tions in which some ongoing traumas, such as
physical abuse at the hands of a caregiver during
Figure 2. Speed of recovery of DSM-IV/CIDI PTSD by trauma category in the WMH Surveys.1

R. C. KESSLER ET AL.
 childhood, are counted as only ‘one occurrence’ even
though they often persisted over many years.
WMH results regarding the most common types
of trauma are consistent with previous research in
finding that unexpected death of a loved one and
motor vehicle accidents are the two most common
types of trauma in the general population (reviewed
by Benjet et al., 2016). We went beyond these pre-
vious results to show that traumas occurring to other
people account for over 40% of all reported qualifying
(for a diagnosis of PTSD) traumas (16.5% involving
unexpected death of a loved one and an additional
25.0% other traumas that either occurred to a loved
one or were witnessed), that accidents are the most
common type of trauma occurring to people directly
(24.6%), and that traumas involving intimate partner
sexual violence (9.8%) and physical violence (13.8%)
account for the bulk of other traumas. It is note-
worthy that the objective occurrence of traumas to
loved ones is clearly under-reported by WMH
respondents in that we would expect each loved one
of each respondent to have as many traumas as the
respondent himself or herself, but this is not the case
in respondent reports, implying that respondent
reports about traumas occurring to loved ones are
limited to the people and traumas most psychologi-
cally salient to respondents.
We also found that trauma exposure is not dis-
tributed randomly in the population. Our results are
consistent in this regard with a previous study that
reviewed the literature on basic socio-demographic
correlates
of
trauma
exposure
(Hatch
&
Dohrenwend, 2007) in finding that women are sig-
nificantly more likely than men to experience inti-
mate partner sexual violence and men more likely
than women to experience physical violence and acci-
dents. We found that traumas involving violence and
accidents are more likely to occur in adolescence and
early adulthood that other parts of the life course. We
also found that being married is the most consistent
socio-demographic factor associated with reduced
risk of many types of trauma exposure, while traumas
involving violence and accidents (including natural
disasters) are inversely associated with socio-eco-
nomic status. And we found that trauma exposures
are correlated over time, with people exposed to ear-
lier traumas at significantly increased risk of subse-
quent traumas. The latter pattern presumably reflects
individual
differences
in
predispositions,
coping
resources, life circumstances, and lifestyles that influ-
ence risk of trauma exposure. The WMH data were
too coarse to search for modifiable risk factors that
might be targeted to prevent future trauma exposure,
but the strong inter-temporal patterning of exposure
suggests that such an investigation might make sense.
Preventive interventions with this focus already exist
for recurrences of drunk driving (Miller, Curtis,
Sønderlund, Day, & Droste, 2015), intimate partner
violence (Ramsay et al., 2009), and sexual violence
(Marques, Wiederanders, Day, Nelson, & Ommeren,
2005), but our results raise the possibility of also
developing risk models to target broader types of
secondary preventive interventions.
Our estimates of conditional PTSD risk among
people exposed to traumas are for the most part
lower than in previous studies due to our focus on
representative samples of traumas in comparison to
the worst traumas examined in most other commu-
nity epidemiological studies and in samples that over-
represent help-seekers focused on particular trauma
types (e.g. Campbell, Dworkin, & Cabral, 2009;
Goldmann & Galea, 2014).
Our finding that conditional PTSD risk is ele-
vated after traumas involving violence is broadly
consistent with previous research (see reviews in
Atwoli et al., 2015; Ozer, Best, Lipsey, & Weiss,
2003). We also found that prior exposure to some
traumas involving violence was associated with gen-
eralized
vulnerability
to
subsequent
PTSD.
Although ongoing research is investigating path-
ways
leading
to
such
generalized
vulnerability
(Daskalakis, Bagot, Parker, Vinkers, & de Kloet,
2013; Levy-Gigi, Richter-Levin, Okon-Singer, Kéri,
& Bonanno, 2016; Rutter, 2012), we know of no
work on differential effects of trauma types in this
regard. However, suggestive related evidence exists
on differences in associations of childhood adver-
sities with adult mental disorders across different
childhood adversity types (Kessler et al., 2010;
Pirkola et al., 2005) and profiles (McLafferty et al.,
2015; Putnam, Harris, & Putnam, 2013).
Our finding that prior same-type physical violence
victimizations predict elevated PTSD risk after re-
victimization means that these types of victimization
are especially impactful when they are recurrent. That
being the case, a question can be raised about our
failure to find a similar pattern for intimate partner
sexual violence, as the latter seems to contradict stu-
dies showing that sexual assault re-victimization is
associated with poor mental health (Classen, Palesh,
& Aggarwal, 2005; Das & Otis, 2016; Miner, Flitter, &
Robinson, 2006). However, these studies focused lar-
gely on victims of childhood sexual assault who were
versus were not re-victimized as adults, whereas our
analysis compares adult sexual assault victims who
were versus were not previously victimized.
Our finding that prior same-type participation in
sectarian violence is associated with low PTSD risk
after subsequent re-exposure to the same trauma is
consistent with research showing low PTSD preva-
lence among policemen (Levy-Gigi et al., 2016) and
other first responders (Levy-Gigi & Richter-Levin,
2014)
and
among
Israeli
settlers
exposed
to
repeated
bombings
(Palgi,
Gelkopf,
&
Berger,
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
11
 2015; Somer et al., 2009). These results could be
due either to selection and/or to prior exposures
promoting resilience (Wilson et al., 2009). Both
experimental animal studies (Liu, 2015) and obser-
vational human studies (Rutter, 2012) support the
resilience possibility, although research showing
that intervening psychopathology due to prior trau-
mas mediates the association between trauma his-
tory and subsequent PTSD (Sayed et al., 2015)
confirms that prior traumas are more likely to cre-
ate vulnerability than resilience. Research on the
‘healthy warrior effect’ supports the selection possi-
bility (Larson, Highfill-McRoy, & Booth-Kewley,
2008; Wilson et al., 2009). As a result, we suspect
that both processes are at work (i.e. both selection
and environmental causation), although we have no
way to estimate their relative importance with the
WMH data.
Our results regarding persistence are broadly con-
sistent with previous studies in showing that a sub-
stantial minority of PTSD cases remits within months
after onset. However, we found that median duration
of symptoms was longer than the six months found
in a recent review of the literature (Morina et al.,
2014). This reflects upward bias in the WMH data
due to the very narrow definition of remission used
in WMH, which required the respondent no longer
to have any PTSD symptoms, leading to artificially
high estimates of duration. This means that duration
of sub-threshold PTSD is considerably longer than
generally appreciated. Given that sub-threshold PTSD
has been shown to be associated with considerable
distress, impairment, and comorbidity (McLaughlin
et al., 2015), the latter possibility is worthy of future
investigation in prospective studies.
5. Conclusions
The WMH data document clearly that trauma expo-
sure is common throughout the world, that this expo-
sure is unequally distributed in the population, and
that PTSD risk differs substantially across trauma
types due to traumas involving interpersonal violence
(especially relationship–sexual violence) carrying the
highest PTSD risk. There is also high population-level
burden of PTSD associated with unexpected death of
a loved one, a very common trauma type that is
associated
with
low
individual-level
PTSD
risk.
Although a substantial minority of PTSD cases remits
within months after onset, mean symptom duration
is considerably longer than previously recognized.
The WMH Surveys were designed as needs assess-
ment surveys to help governments gain insights into
the population burden of mental disorders. Because
of this, the most important implications of the results
are for policy planners in recognizing that PTSD is a
very commonly-occurring condition. Although we
did not present any results about severity of illness,
other WMH results document clearly that PTSD is a
seriously impairing disorder (Kessler et al., 2009).
PTSD causes substantial loss of human capital from
a societal perspective both in the form of days out of
role (Alonso et al., 2011) and in the form of decreased
productivity on days in role (Ormel et al., 2008).
Roughly half of people with PTSD in high income
countries and about half that number in low or mid-
dle income countries seek some type of treatment
(Koenen et al., 2017), but the type and duration of
treatment seldom meet even minimal standards for
treatment adequacy (Wang et al., 2007). These results
suggest that outreach efforts are needed to increase
the proportion of people with PTSD who obtain
treatment and that treatment quality improvement
efforts are needed for patients in treatment.
