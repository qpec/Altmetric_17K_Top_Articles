Objective: To assess 12-month mortality and patterns of out-
patient and inpatient treatment among young people experi-
encing an incident episode of psychosis in the United States. 
Method: Prospective observational analysis of a population-
based cohort of commercially insured individuals aged 16–30 
receiving a first observed (index) diagnosis of psychosis in 
2008–2009. Data come from the US Department of Health 
and Human Services’ Multi-Payer Claims Database Pilot. 
Outcomes are all-cause mortality identified via the Social 
Security Administration’s full Death Master File; and inpa-
tient, outpatient, and psychopharmacologic treatment based 
on health insurance claims data. Outcomes are assessed for 
the year after the index diagnosis. Results: Twelve-month 
mortality after the index psychosis diagnosis was 1968 per 
100 
000 under our most conservative assumptions, some 24 
times greater than in the general US population aged 16–30; 
and up to 7372 per 100 000, some 89 times the corresponding 
general population rate. In the year after index, 61% of the 
cohort filled no antipsychotic prescriptions and 41% received 
no individual psychotherapy. Nearly two-thirds (62%) of the 
cohort had at least one hospitalization and/or one emergency 
department visit during the initial year of care. Conclusions: 
The hugely elevated mortality observed here underscores that 
young people experiencing psychosis warrant intensive clinical 
attention—yet we found low rates of pharmacotherapy and 
limited use of psychosocial treatment. These patterns reinforce 
the importance of providing coordinated, proactive treatment 
for young people with psychosis in US community settings.

Introduction
Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of adults in the 
United States, around 2.5 million individuals.1 Onset 
typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood, 
with recurrent episodes of psychosis and impaired func-
tioning over time. Alarmingly, Americans diagnosed 
with mental disorders such as schizophrenia die about a 
decade earlier than the general population, largely due 
to co-occurring medical problems like diabetes and heart 
disease and to suicide.2–4 The national economic burden 
of schizophrenia alone is conservatively estimated at tens 
of billions of dollars annually.5
Reducing the burdens of schizophrenia and related 
disorders depends on early and effective intervention. 
Evidence from clinical trials suggests that intervention 
close to the onset of psychosis improves patient out-
comes, and at least one longitudinal cohort study has 
observed lower suicide risk among first-episode psychosis 
(FEP) patients enrolled in early intervention programs.6–11 
Several countries have implemented comprehensive treat-
ment programs for young people with psychosis via low-
dose antipsychotic medications, cognitive behavioral 
psychotherapy, family education and support, and voca-
tional recovery services.12,13 The United States has been 
slower to focus on early intervention, so little is known 
about how young people with FEP or other incident 
psychosis utilize pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and 
supportive interventions available here, or how many 
receive care consistent with established guidelines.14
This study examines longitudinal patterns of outpatient 
and inpatient treatment, emergency department visits, 
and all-cause mortality, respectively, in a national cohort 
of young persons with incident psychosis. We focus on 
patients with health insurance at the time of the index 
diagnosis, since being uninsured is an obvious barrier to 
psychosis treatment.15 Data from the Multi-Payer Claims 
Database (MPCD) Pilot were analyzed to explore pat-
terns in mental health care within the year following an

Psychosis, Mortality, and Health Care Use
incident psychosis diagnosis. The MPCD includes linked 
information from the Social Security Administration’s 
full Death Master File (DMF, https://www.ssa.gov/data-
exchange/request_dmf.html), allowing documentation of 
all-cause mortality associated with FEP or other incident 
psychosis in young people, a noted gap in the literature.16 
Prior research from Europe and Australia has found ele-
vated mortality associated with the first episode of psy-
chosis, but under different social, economic, and clinical 
conditions than prevail in the United States.11,17–25
Methods
Data
The MPCD Pilot was sponsored and tested by the US 
Department of Health and Human Services and devel-
oped under contract by OptumInsight with funds 
from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009.26,27 The MPCD includes insurance enrollment 
information and healthcare claims from OptumInsight’s 
Normative Health Information database covering utiliza-
tion from 2007 to 2010, which included 63.4 million com-
mercially insured individuals. MPCD also covers samples 
from fee-for-service Medicare from 2007 to 2010 (7.64 
million individuals) and Medicaid from 2007 and 2008 
(9.35 million individuals). For individuals who transition 
between different participating commercial plans, and/or 
between commercial and public insurance, MPCD data 
can be linked at the individual level across types of cover-
age. Individuals without health insurance are outside the 
scope of MPCD.
For each individual in the dataset, the MPCD includes 
basic demographic information; insurance enrollment; 
and institutional, professional, and pharmacy healthcare 
claims, including Current Procedure Terminology (CPT), 
International Classification of Disease (ICD-9), and 
National Drug Code (NDC) codes. The MPCD includes 
information on fact (i.e., date) of death from the DMF, 
linked using Social Security number, name, sex, state of 
residence and date of birth by OptumInsight for people 
with commercial insurance and by CMS for Medicare 
and Medicaid. The DMF does not contain informa-
tion on cause or manner of death, and the MPCD was 
not linked to the only national source for such data, the 
National Center for Health Statistics’ National Death 
Index (NDI; http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi.htm). The 
research team accessed the MPCD as an approved beta 
tester; the National Institutes of Health Office of Human 
Subjects Research Protections determined that this study 
was exempt from Institutional Review Board review.
Study Cohorts
Health Care Service Utilization. Following prior 
claims-based studies of FEP or newly diagnosed schizo-
phrenia, we identified all (N = 154 322) individuals in 
the MPCD with any inpatient, emergency department 
(ED), or outpatient claim with an ICD-9 diagnosis for 
schizophrenia (295.xx), brief psychotic disorder (298.8), 
or psychotic disorder NOS (298.9); and who were aged 
16–30, the typical age of onset of these disorders, at the 
initial diagnosis.28–30 To focus on incident psychosis—and 
possibly FEP, especially at younger ages—we limited 
the sample to persons with ≥12 months of continuous 
insurance coverage prior to the first observed psycho-
sis diagnosis, which we refer to as the “index” diagnosis 
(N = 14 910); and then to those with commercial (vs pub-
lic, eg, Medicaid/CHIP/Medicare) insurance at the index 
event (N = 5488). Because developing a psychosis disor-
der often leads to public insurance coverage, we excluded 
individuals with public coverage at index out of particu-
lar concern that they might have a prior psychosis history 
we could not observe due to left censoring. Finally, to 
increase confidence that individuals experienced psycho-
sis, we restricted the sample to persons with at least one 
additional psychosis-related ICD-9 diagnosis in the year 
after the index diagnosis (N = 1973); and then, to avoid 
censored utilization data, to those with continuous insur-
ance coverage in the year after index (N = 1357). Both 
the index and subsequent psychosis diagnoses could be 
recorded by general medical or mental health specialty 
providers. Details about each sample selection step are 
shown in figure 1.
Mortality. For mortality, we focused on individuals 
with an index psychosis diagnosis while aged 16–30, and 
continuous insurance coverage for 12 months before and 
commercial insurance at the time of the index diagno-
sis; among these, mortality cases were those who died 
within 12 months after index (N = 108). Out of concern 
for right-censoring (ie, a shorter period of observation 
due to death), we did not require mortality cases to have 
a second psychosis diagnosis, nor continuous insurance 
coverage, after the index diagnosis; correspondingly, our 
primary mortality analyses also do not require these cri-
teria of survivors (N = 5380; figure 1). These criteria were 
modified in sensitivity analyses, as described below.
Period of Analysis
MPCD covers at most 4 years of observation on any given 
individual, 2007–2010, and fewer depending on the timing 
of insurance coverage, age, and the index psychosis diag-
nosis. Based on these factors, and our cohort inclusion 
criteria, we examine mortality and health care service use 
over the 12 months after the index psychosis diagnosis.
Measures
Pharmacotherapy. Following a recent report on pre-
scription practices for early psychosis observed in US 
community mental health clinics, we focus on filled 
prescriptions within 4 categories of psychotropic

medications: antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (including 
anti-convulsants), antidepressants, and anxiolytics.31 The 
primary pharmacotherapy outcome is proportion of days 
covered (PDC), calculated as the number of prescription-
days of filled prescriptions in the respective drug catego-
ries in a given analysis period, divided by the number of 
days in the period. We count each prescription regardless 
of potential overlap. Potential gaps in pharmacotherapy 
occur during inpatient hospitalizations or other institu-
tionalizations where separate pharmacy claims are not 
generated.
Outpatient, Inpatient, and Emergency Care. Health ser-
vices use is based on institutional and professional claims 
from the index psychosis diagnosis through the subse-
quent 12 months. Inpatient care assessed by the number 
of hospitalizations (medical and psychiatric combined) 
and number of inpatient days. Hospitalizations exceed-
ing the 12-month follow-up period are truncated to 
365 days. We count the number of ED visits; and men-
tal health outpatient evaluation and management visits, 
categorized via CPT code into psychiatric medical man-
agement, individual psychotherapy, family therapy, and 
group psychotherapy visits.
Results
The primary study cohort includes the 1357 individuals 
who meet inclusion criteria for an index psychosis diag-
nosis while aged 16–30; commercial insurance at the index 
diagnosis; continuous insurance coverage for 12 months 
before and 12 months following the index diagnosis; and 
a second psychosis-related diagnosis during the follow-
up period (figure 1). For primary mortality analyses, we 
use the 5488 individuals who meet all these criteria except 
the last two. Table 1 presents demographic and diagnostic 
information obtained at the index episode, and insurance 
status over time. In the primary study cohort, approxi-
mately 84% of patients were ≤25 years old at the time of 
the index diagnosis; 61% were male. The modal diagnosis 
was psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (63%), fol-
lowed by schizoaffective disorder (15%), paranoid schizo-
phrenia (6%), unspecified schizophrenia (5%), and other 
psychosis-spectrum disorders (all < 5%). Less than 2% 
of the cohort switched from commercial to Medicaid/
Medicare insurance coverage during the 12-month fol-
low-up period.
All-Cause Mortality
Table 2 reports 12-month mortality for the psychosis 
cohort and the US general population in corresponding 
age and gender categories. Twelve-month mortality for 
the entire psychosis cohort was 2.0% [1968 per 100 000 
people; 108/(5380 + 108)]; 12-month mortality in the cor-
responding general population is <0.1% (89 per 100 000 
people).
Mortality varied significantly by age, with rates an 
order of magnitude higher in those with incident psy-
chosis after age 25 compared with those with an incident 
diagnosis between ages 16 and 20. Even so, mortality in 
the youngest group was 531 per 100 000 [15/(2808 + 15)]; 
by comparison, 12-month mortality in the corresponding 
general population aged 16–20 is only 66 per 100 000.32,33 
For persons in the psychosis cohort aged 26–30, mortal-
ity was 5263 per 100 000 [61/(1098 + 61)], compared to 
97 per 100 000 in the corresponding general population. 
Mortality in the psychosis cohort is 8 times the general

population rate for people aged 16–20, 21 times the rate 
for ages 21–25, and 54 times the rate for ages 26–30. In 
absolute terms, mortality rates were lower for females 
than males within each age category, in both the psycho-
sis cohort and the general population; in the 2 older age 
categories, however, the gender differential was smaller

in the psychosis cohort than in the general population, 
so standardized mortality ratios were actually higher for 
females than males in those categories.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses of mortality. 
To estimate an upper bound on mortality, we required 
that survivors—but not decedents, due to right censor-
ing—have a second psychosis diagnosis and continuous 
insurance coverage after the index diagnosis (N = 1357, 
ie, the service use cohort); this yields 12-month mortal-
ity of 7.4% [108/(1357 + 108)], some 89 times the corre-
sponding general population rate. From there, requiring 
that mortality cases also have at least one observed psy-
chosis diagnosis after the index event (ie, between index 
and death), the number of deaths drops by 34% (N = 71), 
yielding 12-month mortality of 5.0% [71/(1357 + 71)]. 
Lifting the requirement of continuous commercial insur-
ance after index for survivors yielded 12-month mortality 
of 3.7% [71/(1973 + 71)].
Although information on cause of death was not avail-
able for this study, we examined the medical diagnoses 
received in the 12 months prior to the index psychosis 
diagnosis by the decedents (N = 108) in our mortality 
cohort. We identified 25 who had medical conditions that 
are associated with substantial near-term mortality: 15 
with cancer, 9 with end-stage renal disease, and 1 with 
cystic fibrosis. As a final sensitivity analysis, we excluded 
these from the mortality cohort, which yields 12-month 
mortality of 1.5% [83/(5380 + 83)], still 18 times higher 
than mortality in the corresponding general population. 
Details are reported in supplemental table 1.
Health Care Service Utilization
Pharmacotherapy. Members of the health care service 
utilization cohort (N = 1357) filled a total of 19 061 pre-
scriptions during the 12-month follow-up, across all drug 
classes. Of these, 58.5% were for these types of psycho-
tropic medications: antipsychotics (23.2%), antidepres-
sants (14.5%), mood stabilizers and anti-convulsant 
medications (12.2%), and anxiolytics (5.9%). Remaining 
prescriptions (41.5%) were mainly for nonpsychotropic 
drugs, plus a small amount of ADHD drugs.
Table 3 reports receipt of psychotropic medications, 
overall and by quarter. Overall, 39% of the cohort filled 
at least one antipsychotic prescription in the year after 
index; on average, filled prescriptions for antipsychotic 
medications covered just 20% of the follow-up year. The 
fraction of patients receiving other psychotropic medica-
tions was lower: 27% filled at least one prescription for 
an antidepressant, 21% for a mood stabilizer, and 14% 
for an anxiolytic. Mean PDC for medications other than 
antipsychotics ranged from 5% (anxiolytics) to 13% (anti-
depressants). The proportion of the cohort receiving any 
prescription in a given class did not vary significantly 
by age or gender for any of the 4 psychotropic classes. 
Women had higher PDC than men for mood stabilizers 
and anti-convulsants (F[1, N = 1355] = 17.64, P < .01), 
while age was positively associated with higher PDC for 
anxiolytics (F[2, N = 1354] = 7.42, P < .01).
Only 36% of the cohort had any medication manage-
ment visits with a psychiatrist or other mental health 
specialty prescriber in the year following index psychosis 
diagnosis (Table 4). On average, those with any medica-
tion management visits had 4.5 (SD = 5.1) such sessions 
during the year. Patterns of medication management did 
not vary significantly by age or gender.
Outpatient Mental Health Services. Table 4 reports 
on outpatient mental health treatment, overall and by 
quarter. Overall, 69% of the cohort had at least one visit 
with a mental health specialty provider for medication 
management and/or psychotherapy during the follow-
up year; on average these individuals had approximately 
one outpatient contact per month. The modal type of 
specialty visit was individual psychotherapy, with nearly 
60% of the cohort having at least one such session. Those 
with any individual psychotherapy had an average of 12.2 
(SD = 13.9) such visits over the year. Patterns of indi-
vidual psychotherapy did not vary substantially by age 
or gender. In contrast, use of family therapy, while very 
low overall (13%), was more common among younger 
patients (χ2[2, N = 1357] = 12.79, P < .01). Mean num-
ber of family therapy sessions differed significantly 
among age groups (F[2, N = 1354] = 6.72, P < .01), with 
the youngest patients receiving more services than older 
members of the cohort. Participation in group psycho-
therapy was exceedingly rare (2%), with no significant dif-
ferences by age or gender.
Inpatient and Emergency Department Care. Per Table 5, 
23% of the health care service utilization cohort was hos-
pitalized in the year after the index diagnosis, including 
106 members of the cohort (7.8%) whose index psychosis 
diagnosis occurred while hospitalized; the mean number 
of hospitalizations was 1.3 among those hospitalized 
at least once, covering an average of 32 inpatient days 
during the year. Intensity of inpatient use did not differ 
by gender, but those with an index diagnosis after age 
25 were substantially less likely to be hospitalized than 
younger patients (χ2[2, N = 1357] = 9.3, P < .01). More 
than half (55%) of individuals in this cohort had at least 
one ED visit in the year following the index diagnosis; 
those with any ED contact averaged 2.2 visits during 
the year. Overall, nearly two-thirds (62%) of psychosis 
patients had at least one hospitalization and/or at least 
one ED visit in the year after index diagnosis.
Health Care Service Use Among Psychosis Decedents. We 
examined health care utilization for the cases (N = 108) 
who died within 12 months of the index psychosis diag-
nosis. We imputed “annualized” use by rescaling observed 
use using the fraction of the year each decedent survived.

Psychosis, Mortality, and Health Care Use
On an annualized basis, decedents had more hospital-
izations than survivors (mean of 4.3 vs 1.3, respectively; 
P < .01), and more ED visits (mean of 4.2 vs 2.2; P < 
.01); while they had lower medication use in all psy-
chotropic categories, as well as lower use of all types of 
psychotherapy.
Discussion
Our findings raise substantial concerns about conditions 
for young people experiencing psychosis in the United 
States. Most strikingly, we found 12-month mortality 
among young people after an incident psychosis diagno-
sis that was at least 24 times higher than the age-matched 
general population. In the general population, only indi-
viduals over 70 years of age have all-cause 12-month mor-
tality approaching the rates we observed among young 
psychosis patients here.32 No sensitivity analysis lowered 
our overall findings of excess mortality below an order of 
magnitude (although standardized mortality ratios were 
somewhat below 10 for the youngest group, ages 16–20, 
in our most conservative analyses). Moreover, mortality 
in this cohort is substantially higher than the rates associ-
ated with serious mental illness (SMI) overall—perhaps 
because the period and population assessed here only 
partially overlaps with studies of SMI mortality.2–4
The high death rate for this cohort argues strongly for 
intensive clinical intervention in the early stages of psy-
chotic illness.11 Yet the patterns of treatment we observed 
were far from intensive, with surprisingly low rates of 
medical oversight and only modest involvement by psy-
chosocial treatment providers. Moreover, the individu-
als who proved to be most vulnerable—those who died 
within 12 months of the index diagnosis—received even 
less outpatient treatment, and relied more heavily on 
intermittent hospital and emergency care. These find-
ings stand in stark contrast to recent recommendations 
for multi-modal, coordinated, and proactive outpatient 
treatment programs for FEP and other incident psychosis 
in US community settings, ie, coordinated specialty care 
programs.14,34
This study has several limitations. First, the MPCD was 
not constructed to be representative of the general popu-
lation. However, we can think of no reason why the cohort 
studied here should be disproportionately disadvantaged 
relative to psychosis cases outside the MPCD; indeed, it 
represents a kind of best-case scenario regarding access 
to treatment, since inclusion required continuous health 
insurance coverage both before and after the index psy-
chosis diagnosis.35,36 Second, our methods for identify-
ing psychosis cases lack the diagnostic precision found 
in prospective studies of early psychosis, including that 
some index diagnoses, particularly of unspecified psycho-
sis (ICD-9 298.9), might be attributable to medical illness 
and/or medical treatment; and we lacked the information 
on patient history necessary to identify FEP definitively.

However, sensitivity analyses using both stricter and less 
strict cohort inclusion criteria did not alter the principal 
findings substantially. Third, the claims data used here 
do not support assessment of whether any given patients’ 
care was appropriate or not; this would require review of 
clinical records, which we leave to future research. Fourth, 
the absolute size of the study cohort is small, which could 
reduce the precision of our findings. However, any such 
effect should be most substantial for generally rare out-
comes such as mortality in adolescents and young adults. 
In practice, we observe so many deaths in the study sam-
ple—identified via the full DMF, an authoritative data 
source on mortality—that we are very confident in our 
conclusions regarding excess premature death. At the 
same time, the sample is clinically heterogeneous, with 
respect to initial and subsequent psychosis diagnosis as 
well as to comorbidity, which the scale and scope of the 
current data do not enable us to examine in detail.
Fifth, the MPCD restricted access to data on cause and 
manner of death. Intervention efforts will likely benefit 
from knowing whether young people with psychosis die 
principally from the same unnatural causes—substance-
related and other accidents, and suicides—that are most 
common in the corresponding general population, albeit 
at much higher rates, as prior studies from other coun-
tries suggest may be the case;11,18,21–25 and/or from the car-
diometabolic disorders and cancers that underlie much 
of the excess mortality in older people with psychosis.37 
Substance use problems commonly co-occur with psycho-
sis disorders, including in the study cohort; for instance, 
43 of the 108 decedents in this study had a substance use 
disorder diagnosis (ICD-9 303.X, 304.X, or 305.X) in the 
30 days prior to the index psychosis diagnosis, and 20 of 
the decedents had such a diagnosis on the date of death.
Finally, MPCD data do not permit evaluation of possi-
ble causal links between low rates of treatment, the qual-
ity of services, and high mortality or manner of death 
among psychosis patients.38,39 However, it is very hard for 
us to imagine that the low intensity and quality of care 
observed here is unrelated to excess mortality, particu-
larly considering evidence of multiple crises (ie, ED visits 
and inpatient episodes) experienced by many patients in 
the year following index diagnosis.
In light of these limitations, and given relatively little 
published evidence on the healthcare trajectories and 
mortality patterns of young people with FEP or other 
incident psychosis in the United States, replication of 
all analyses reported here is important. Ideally, such 
analyses would use population-based data covering a 
truly national/representative cohort of young persons 
with FEP; follow them beyond the first year after psy-
chosis onset; and include precise instruments for defin-
ing FEP caseness, the quality of pharmacologic and 
psychosocial treatments, key clinical and functional 
outcomes, and timing, cause and manner of death for 
decedents.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the current findings 
are consistent with other studies describing deficiencies in 
the quality of early psychosis care provided in US com-
munities. Recent reports suggest unacceptably long delays 
in the initiation of psychosis treatment after the onset of 
symptoms, questionable psychotropic prescription prac-
tices in approximately 40% of cases, and elevated car-
diometabolic risk factors and abnormalities among FEP 
patients that go largely untreated.31,40,41 Taken together, 
these findings provide a strong rationale for initiatives to 
improve early identification and integrated treatment for 
psychotic disorders in US treatment settings. Such efforts 
are already underway, supported by recent actions by the 
US Congress, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, and the National Institute of Mental 
Health that are accelerating implementation of evidence-
based treatments for FEP
.34,42–44 Given accumulating evi-
dence associating timely FEP treatment with positive 
clinical, social, and employment outcomes, the present 
findings reinforce the need for widely available coordinated 
specialty care programs, and strategies to provide them as 
early in after psychosis onset as possible.6,8 Such programs 
are needed to improve outcomes for people experiencing 
FEP, and might help mitigate the extraordinarily high 
rates of mortality observed in this vulnerable population.
