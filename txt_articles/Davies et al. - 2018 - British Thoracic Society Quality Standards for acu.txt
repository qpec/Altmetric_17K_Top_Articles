Quality Standards
ABSTRACT
Introduction The purpose of the quality standards 
document is to provide healthcare professionals, 
commissioners, service providers and patients with a guide 
to standards of care that should be met for the provision 
of acute non-invasive ventilation in adults together with 
measurable markers of good practice.
Methods Development of British Thoracic Society (BTS) 
Quality Standards follows the BTS process of quality 
standard production based on the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence process manual for the 
development of quality standards.
Results 6 quality statements have been developed, 
each describing a standard of care for the provision of 
acute non-invasive ventilation in the UK, together with 
measurable markers of good practice.
Conclusion BTS Quality Standards for acute non-invasive 
ventilation in adults form a key part of the range of 
supporting materials that the Society produces to assist 
in the dissemination and implementation of guideline’s 
recommendations.
INTRODUCTION
The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has been 
at the forefront of the production of guide-
lines for best clinical practice in respiratory 
medicine since the Society was established 
over 30 years ago. The Society was awarded 
National Institute for Health and Clinical 
Excellence (NICE) Accreditation for its 
guideline production process in November 
2011, and the Society’s Guideline Produc-
tion Manual1 setting out the detailed meth-
odology and policy to produce guidelines is 
reviewed annually by the BTS Standards of 
Care Committee (SOCC).
A statement on quality standards based 
on each BTS Guideline is a key part of the 
range of supporting materials that the 
Society produces to assist in the dissemina-
tion and implementation of a Guideline’s 
recommendations.
A quality standard is a set of specific, concise 
statements that:
 
► act as markers of high-quality, cost-effec-
tive patient care across a pathway or clini-
cal area, covering treatment or prevention
 
► are derived from the best available evidence.
NICE Quality Standards and the NICE 
Quality Standards Process Guide2 were used 
as a model for the development of BTS 
Quality Standards.
The rationale for these quality standards 
is drawn from evidence and recommenda-
tions summarised in the BTS Guidelines for 
the Ventilatory Management of Acute Hyper-
capnic Respiratory Failure3 and is informed 
by the 2017 National Confidential Enquiry 
into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) 
report on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), 
‘Inspiring Change’.4
The purpose of the Quality Standards docu-
ment is to provide commissioners, healthcare 
professionals, planners and patients with a 
guide to standards of care that should be met 
for provision of acute NIV in the UK, together 
with measurable markers of good practice.
BTS Quality Standards are intended for:
 
► Service providers: to be able to quickly 
and easily examine the clinical perfor-
mance of their organisation and assess the 
standards of care they provide;
 
► Health care professionals: to allow deci-
sions to be made about care based on the 
latest evidence and best practice;
 
► Commissioners: so that they can be confi-
dent that the services they are purchasing 
are high quality and cost effective;
 
► People who receive acute NIV: to enable 
understanding of what services they should 
expect from their healthcare provider.
METHOD OF WORKING
A Quality Standards Working Group was 
convened in February 2017 and met in May 
2017, with the following membership given in 
table 1.

Members of the Quality Standards Group submitted 
Declaration of Interest forms in line with the BTS Policy, 
and copies of forms are available on request from BTS 
Head Office.
The draft document was considered in detail by the 
BTS Standards of Care Committee and the BTS Quality 
Improvement Committee initially in June 2017.
The document was made available on the BTS website 
for public consultation for the period from 1 August to 
13 September 2017.
Following further revision, the document was submitted 
for approval to the BTS Standards of Care Committee in 
December 2017.
The Quality Standards document will be reviewed in 
2023 or following the publication of a revised Guideline, 
whichever is the sooner.
Each Quality Standard includes the following:
 
► A Quality Statement, which describes a key marker of 
high-quality, cost-effective care for this condition.
 
► Quality Measures, which aim to improve the struc-
ture, process and outcomes of healthcare.
The quality measures are not intended to be new sets 
of targets or mandatory indicators for performance 
management that need to be collected. The quality 
measures are specified in the form of a numerator and 
a denominator, which define a proportion or ratio 
(numerator/denominator). It is assumed that the 
numerator is a subset of the denominator population. 
The suggested numerator and denominator are provided 
to allow healthcare professionals and service providers to 
examine their clinical performance in relation to each 
quality standard. It is recognised that no national quality 
indicators will be available for this condition, and insti-
tutions will need to agree locally what information is 
required for the denominator to be used in each case, 
and what the expected level of achievement should be, 
given local circumstances. A brief description about the 
quality standard in relation to each audience is given.
The main source references for these quality standards 
are:

Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure in Adults (2016).3

and Death. Inspiring Change. London: NCEPOD; 2017.4
There is no specific order of priority associated with 
the list of quality statements.

LIST OF QUALITY STATEMENTS
1: Acute non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be offered to all patients who meet evidence-based criteria. Hospitals must 
ensure there is adequate capacity to provide NIV to all eligible patients.
2: All staff who prescribe, initiate or make changes to acute NIV treatment should have evidence of training and maintenance 
of competencies appropriate for their role.
3: Acute NIV should only be carried out in specified clinical areas designated for the delivery of acute NIV.
4: Patients who meet evidence-based criteria for acute NIV should start NIV within 60 
min of the blood gas result associated 
with the clinical decision to provide NIV and within 120 
min of hospital arrival for patients who present acutely.
5: All patients should have a documented escalation plan before starting treatment with acute NIV. Clinical progress should 
be reviewed by a healthcare professional with appropriate training and competence within 4 
hours and by a consultant with 
training and competence in acute NIV within 14 
hours of starting acute NIV.
6: All patients treated with acute NIV should have blood gas analysis performed within 2 
hours of starting acute NIV; failure of 
these blood gas measurements to improve should trigger specialist healthcare professional review within 30 
min.
Quality statement 1
Acute non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be offered to all patients who meet evidence-
based criteria. Hospitals must ensure there is adequate capacity to provide NIV to all eligible 
patients.
Rationale:
Acute NIV reduces mortality by 50% and shortens hospital length of stay when used to treat COPD 
exacerbations complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF).5 6 Non-randomised 
studies also show that NIV benefits patients with AHRF in association with obesity hypoventilation, 
chest wall disorders and neuromuscular disease. However, national audit data confirm suboptimal 
uptake; in the 2014 COPD audit, 34% of patients with persistent or new respiratory acidaemia on 
serial blood gases did not receive NIV.7 NCEPOD also reported that 40% of hospitals had insufficient 
capacity to meet the demand for acute NIV.4
A clinical decision to start acute NIV should be based on diagnostic criteria as described above, 
patient wishes and other factors. These include an assessment of stable state performance status 
and degree of frailty, such as needing assistance washing and dressing. Other clinical indices 
that may influence outcome, for example, late development of AHRF following optimal inpatient 
treatment, should also be considered. Poor performance status alone is not an exclusion criterion 
for acute NIV and therapeutic nihilism should be avoided; for a similar patient population, the CAOS 
study showed that 80% of clinician estimates of outcome were unduly pessimistic.8 9 Accurate 
information that takes all of the above into account should be provided to patients to enable an 
informed discussion of treatment options.
Failure to provide acute NIV when it is indicated is an omission of care that places the patient at risk 
of moderate or serious harm. Measures should be in place via routine clinical governance to review 
all cases of morbidity and mortality associated with NIV, including investigation as a Serious Incident 
if omission of care is believed to have caused unexpected or avoidable death.
Quality measure:
Structure:
Acute hospitals and trusts should ensure:
 
► Patients who meet evidence-based criteria are offered acute NIV.
 
► There should be sufficient ventilators and bed capacity in designated areas to provide acute NIV 
when required.
 
► At all times, there should be sufficient trained staff on-site with appropriate expertise to decide 
whether to initiate acute NIV following an objective review and discussion with the patient.
 
► There should be an available on-call consultant with expertise in the use of acute NIV to discuss 
and review the patient if necessary when clinical decisions are uncertain (eg, use of acute NIV for 
non-evidence-based indications).
 
► There is a robust governance structure to investigate acts or omissions in care.
Process:
 
► Measure 1 quantifies patients with COPD alone on the basis that they represent the most frequent 
indication for NIV and are easier to define as a single patient population. To show variation in 
practice that may reflect undue nihilism, the denominator includes patients in whom NIV was 
judged futile or who decline NIV following discussion with clinicians.
 
► Measure 2 quantifies all patients not treated with NIV who, on review (eg, morbidity and mortality 
review), should have been treated with NIV.
Numerator 1: number of patients with COPD exacerbation and an indication for acute NIV who are 
treated with acute NIV.
Denominator 1: total number of patients with COPD exacerbation and a clinical indication for NIV.*
*Including all patients who meet evidence-based criteria but do not start acute NIV due to patient 
wishes or a clinical decision that NIV would be futile.

What the quality 
statement means for 
each audience:
Service providers:
 
► Should ensure there are adequate systems, staffing and capacity in place to provide acute NIV to 
all eligible patients
 
► Should ensure that there is a robust and responsive clinical governance process to investigate 
acts or omissions in care.
Healthcare professionals:
 
► Should ensure that patients with a clinical need for NIV are reviewed by a specialist healthcare 
professional with the necessary NIV competence to make the decision to start acute NIV.
Commissioners:
 
► Should ensure that they commission services with sufficient capacity and resources to provide 
acute NIV to all patients with a clinical indication for its use.
People who receive acute NIV:
 
► Access to acute NIV should not be restricted due to either nihilism or lack of infrastructure.
 
► Should receive a fully informed discussion around treatment options with a specialist healthcare 
professional with the necessary NIV competence to make such decisions.

Quality statement 2
All staff who prescribe, initiate or make changes to acute NIV treatment should have evidence 
of training and maintenance of competencies appropriate for their role.
Rationale:
Acute NIV is an effective treatment provided it is delivered correctly. Key to this is training staff to 
ensure they have both the knowledge and the practical skills commensurate with their role.
NCEPOD’s study4 highlighted important deficiencies in the training of staff involved in NIV services. 
It found that 45% of hospitals permitted staff without competency to directly supervise the care of 
patients receiving NIV.
Effective acute NIV treatment can be delivered by a range of specialist healthcare professionals 
(eg, nurse, physiotherapist and doctor) provided that they are competent to deliver the aspect of 
treatment they are responsible for. For example:
 
► Staff responsible for the clinical decision to start acute NIV must demonstrate evidence of training 
and ongoing competence in the theory and practice of acute NIV.
 
► Staff responsible for the practical application of acute NIV (including starting and adjusting 
treatment) should demonstrate current competence in the practical application of NIV.
 
► Consultants responsible for the care and escalation decisions of patients treated with acute NIV 
should be able to demonstrate competence in all aspects of acute NIV care. This includes starting 
and maintaining treatment as well as practical and theoretical knowledge.

Quality measure:
Structure:
Evidence that the practical delivery of NIV is only by staff who are competent to do so, and those 
individuals with clinical responsibility demonstrate competence in NIV clinical decision making.
Process:
Proportion of staff delivering acute NIV with evidence of training and competencies together with 
evidence of annual updates.
Numerator 1: number of healthcare professionals with direct responsibility to initiate and make 
changes to acute NIV treatment who have evidence of competence in the practical use of acute NIV.
Denominator 1: total number of healthcare professionals with direct responsibility to initiate and

acute NIV who have evidence of competence in the theory and practice of acute NIV treatment.
Denominator 2: total number of healthcare professionals with responsibility for the clinical decision 
to start acute NIV.
What the quality 
statement means for 
each audience:
Service providers:
 
► Should ensure that all staff delivering NIV are competent to do so with evidence of initial training 
and annual updates. This should be provided via a mandatory rolling competency assessment 
commensurate with the role undertaken.
 
► Should ensure that training and competency assessments are standardised for all areas in which 
acute NIV is delivered, recognising that NIV services typically span multiple clinical divisions.
 
► Should ensure the Clinical Lead for the acute NIV service is supported in mandating training 
across all designated areas of the hospital where acute NIV may be delivered.
Healthcare professionals:
 
► Who are involved in any aspect of delivering acute NIV should have evidence of training in the 
theory and practice of NIV, commensurate of their role.
Commissioners:
 
► Should ensure that any service commissioned to provide acute NIV has staff who are trained, 
competent and receive annual knowledge updates.
People who receive acute NIV:
 
► Should have this delivered by trained and competent staff, commensurate with their role in the 
service.

Table 2 – NIV service staff training checklist.
Quality statement 3
Acute NIV should only be carried out in specified clinical areas designated for the delivery of 
acute NIV.
Rationale:
Acute NIV is delivered as a ward-based service for most patients treated in the UK. National audit 
data confirm that patients treated with acute NIV should be considered at high risk of death; 
national averages for in hospital mortality exceed 30%. Use of acute NIV in non-specialised areas is 
associated with poorer outcomes.10
Levels of trained staff, patient monitoring and near-patient point of care testing must be sufficient to 
manage such patients effectively. Accepting that there are differences in hospital size and provision, 
defining appropriate areas for acute NIV is the function of a local operational policy. Nevertheless, 
there are key infrastructure requirements for acute NIV treatment that apply regardless of area. These 
are provided in table 3.
Areas should be specified according to their capacity to provide effective NIV care, not the name of 
the area. Suitable areas may include emergency departments (EDs), acute medical units, respiratory 
wards, high dependency units and critical care. As stated in quality statement 1, capacity for acute 
NIV should match expected demand. As stated in quality statement 1, NCEPOD’s study showed 
insufficient capacity for acute NIV in 40% of hospitals who provide an NIV service. This indicates a 
need for additional resource for some hospitals to meet the needs of this high-risk patient population 
with AHRF
. The severity of AHRF and evidence of other organ dysfunction should influence the 
choice of care environment and staffing requirement.
This quality statement links to recommendations 6 and 7 of the NCEPOD ‘Inspiring Change’ report.

Quality measure:
Structure:
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that acute NIV is delivered in clinical areas that are 
specified in local operational policy.
Process:
Proportion of adults who receive acute NIV treatment in an appropriate clinical area as defined in 
a local operational policy. This area should meet the recommendations of the BTS/ICS Guidelines 
for the Ventilatory Management of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory failure in Adults (2016)3 and 
NCEPOD’s ‘Inspiring Change’ report.4
Numerator 1: number of patients who start acute NIV treatment in a designated NIV area* of the 
hospital.
Denominator 1: total number of patients treated with acute NIV.
Numerator 2: number of patients who receive continuous oximetry monitoring during the first 
24 
hours of treatment with acute NIV.
Denominator 2: total number of patients treated with acute NIV.
*A hospital’s local operational policy must specify appropriate clinical areas for acute NIV. Designated 
areas must meet all key infrastructure requirements as defined in table 3. Dedicated outreach teams 
may start acute NIV prior to transfer to a designated area, provided that patients receive the same 
provision of staffing and monitoring. Transfer to an appropriate area should occur within 4 
hours. If these 
criteria (table 3 and/or transfer) are not met, then the patient should not be included in numerator 1.
What the quality 
statement means for 
each audience:
Service providers:
 
► Should ensure systems are in place for all appropriate patients to be treated with NIV in an 
appropriate clinical area. This includes specifying clinical and operational pathways to ensure that 
such areas are identified and provide sufficient ventilators, masks and monitoring equipment to 
meet the expected demands of the service.
 
► Should ensure that designated acute NIV areas have an appropriate trained staff/patient 
ratio (as 
set out in table 3).
Healthcare professionals:
 
► Should ensure that patients treated with NIV are cared for in an appropriate clinical area.
 
► Senior healthcare professionals should work with operational managers to ensure that their NIV 
service meets BTS/ICS criteria and NCEPOD recommendations (table 3).
Commissioners:
 
► Should ensure they commission acute NIV services that can demonstrate clinical pathways and 
effective delivery of care.
People who receive acute NIV:
 
► Should only be treated in an appropriate clinical area that is configured to provide safe, effective care.

Quality statement 4
Patients who meet evidence-based criteria for acute NIV should start NIV within 60 
min of 
the blood gas result associated with the clinical decision to provide NIV and within 120 
min of 
hospital arrival for patients who present acutely.
Rationale:
Consensus expert opinion is that prompt application of acute NIV substantially reduces the risk of 
death in appropriately selected patients with AHRF
.5 6 9 Clinical deterioration due to treatment delay 
may result in worsening acidaemia which, in turn, is associated with a poorer outcome.4 10 As such, 
there should be no delay in starting acute NIV once the decision to treat with NIV is made. The 
‘defining’ blood gas measurement is the result that informs the clinical decision to start acute NIV 
treatment and is consistent with recommendation 5 of the NCEPOD study.4
Prompt and effective clinical management is also essential prior to the decision to start NIV.4 10 The 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)11 and NCEPOD12 highlight the importance 
of physiological track and trigger systems to triage and assess acutely ill patients. However, 
NCEPOD show that an early warning score was not recorded for 47% of patients treated with acute 
NIV.4 When used, 56% of patients had a National Early Warning Score of 6 or more, indicating the 
need for urgent clinical assessment.

Open Access
When a blood gas shows AHRF
, a time-limited trial of standard medical therapy (eg, controlled 
oxygen and drugs) may be appropriate provided the patient is not in extremis.13 BTS guidance on 
the use of oxygen in the emergency setting states ‘if the patient is hypercapnic and acidotic, start 
NIV with targeted oxygen therapy if respiratory acidosis persists for more than 30 
min after initiation 
of standard medical management’.14 If the clinical indication for acute NIV remains, then acute NIV 
should start without delay.
In setting a 120 
min target from arrival to mask application, this statement intends to establish that 
recognition and treatment of AHRF are time-critical events for patients admitted acutely, without 
bypassing the necessity for specialist clinical decision making. It permits adequate time for triage, 
blood gas sampling, clinical assessment, initial management and planning for acute NIV. Minimum time 
to assessment and treatment targets are commonplace in EDs and acute medical units. They serve to 
prioritise interventions most likely to improve outcomes. Patients who develop AHRF at a later stage in 
their admission should be receiving controlled oxygen and medical therapy already. Late development 
of AHRF is associated with poorer outcomes, and careful clinical review is recommended. 
Nevertheless, if there is a clinical decision to start NIV, then it should start without further delay.
This statement does not define the blood gas sampling method (arterial vs capillary vs venous). An 
arterial blood gas is the recommended method for the blood gas measurement that defines the need 
for NIV. At other times, such as initial triage or monitoring treatment response, other methods may 
provide advantages such as easier access, improved staff availability and reduced pain.
Quality measure:
Structure:
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that all patients meeting evidence-based criteria for NIV 
therapy are treated in a timely fashion, including:
 
► Rapid clinical assessment to establish presence of respiratory distress or requirement for 
supplemental oxygen
 
► Performing a blood gas measurement within 1 
hour of arrival to hospital in patients with 
respiratory distress
 
► Recognition of qualifying blood gas criteria for treatment with NIV
 
► Understanding of evidence-based criteria for starting treatment with NIV
 
► Starting NIV within 60 
min of the blood gas that identifies the need for NIV treatment.
Process:
Proportion of patients treated with acute NIV who start NIV within 60 
min of the first blood gas result 
that confirms the clinical indication for acute NIV. This includes both acute presentation of AHRF on 
admission to hospital and late-onset AHRF following admission.
For patients presenting acutely to hospital, the proportion of patients treated with acute NIV who (A) 
have a blood gas performed within 60 
min of hospital arrival and (B) start acute NIV within 120 
min of 
hospital arrival.
Numerator 1: number of patients meeting evidence-based criteria for acute NIV and treated with 
acute NIV within 60 
min of the blood gas result associated with the clinical decision to provide NIV.*
Denominator 1: total number of patients with AHRF who are treated with acute NIV.
*The blood gas measurement defining the decision for acute NIV may be the presenting gas or one 
obtained after a period of controlled oxygen. Includes patients with AHRF due to COPD, obesity, 
neuromuscular disease and chest wall disorders. Includes emergency admissions and patients who 
develop AHRF at a later stage during a hospital admission.
Numerator 2: number of patients meeting evidence-based criteria for acute NIV and treated with 
acute NIV within 120 
min of hospital arrival.**
Denominator 2: total number of patients meeting evidence-based criteria for acute NIV who are 
treated with acute NIV.
**Excludes patients who develop AHRF at a later stage during a hospital admission. They should be 
included in numerator and denominator 1 only.
Numerator 3: number of patients meeting evidence-based criteria for acute NIV and treated with 
acute NIV whose first blood gas measurement is performed within 60 
min of hospital arrival.
Denominator 3: total number of patients meeting evidence-based criteria for acute NIV on 
admission to hospital who are treated with acute NIV.

Quality statement 5
All patients should have a documented escalation plan before starting treatment with acute 
NIV. Clinical progress should be reviewed by a healthcare professional with appropriate 
training and competence within 4 
hours of starting NIV and by a consultant with training and 
competence in acute NIV within 14 
hours of starting acute NIV.
Rationale:
There is a high mortality in this patient population, and the initial response to NIV provides key 
insights into treatment outcome. Failure to demonstrate at least partial physiological improvement 
after 2 
hours of therapy is associated with poorer outcomes15 and should prompt the need to 
consider invasive ventilation.8 9 Delivering effective care therefore requires clear escalation plans at 
the onset of treatment with acute NIV. The escalation plan should include appropriateness of invasive 
ventilation, ceiling of treatment and CPR status.
Careful clinical review is essential for successful patient outcomes. As a minimum, all patients treated 
with acute NIV should be reviewed by a competent healthcare professional (as defined in quality 
statement 2) within 4 
hours of starting acute NIV. A consultant with expertise in acute NIV should 
review the patient and initial escalation decision within 14 
hours of admission and daily thereafter 
until NIV treatment stops. Changes to the escalation plan should be made on the basis of review by a 
clinician with appropriate expertise and include critical care review if required.
This quality statement links to recommendations 9, 10 and 11 of the NCEPOD ‘Inspiring Change’ 
report,4 and recommendations 2 and 3 of the Clinical Quality Indicators for Acute Medical Units 
(Society for Acute Medicine, 2011).16
Quality measure:
Structure:
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that all patients treated with acute NIV have:
 
► A documented treatment plan that includes decisions around escalation to critical care, 
appropriateness of invasive ventilation and CPR status before starting acute NIV.
 
► Review by a specialist healthcare professional (as defined in quality statement 2) within 4 
hours of 
starting acute NIV.
 
► Review by a consultant with expertise in NIV (as defined in quality statement 2) within 14 
hours of 
starting acute NIV; this includes review of the initial escalation and ceiling of treatment decision.
Daily review by a consultant with expertise in NIV until treatment with NIV stops.
Process:
Proportion of patients treated with acute NIV who have documented escalation plans and decisions 
regarding ceiling of treatment prior to starting treatment with acute NIV.
Proportion of patients reviewed by a consultant with expertise in acute NIV within 14 
hours of starting 
treatment with acute NIV.

Quality statement 6
All patients treated with acute NIV should have blood gas analysis performed within 2 
hours 
of starting acute NIV. Failure of these blood gas measurements to improve should trigger 
specialist healthcare professional review within 30 
min.
Rationale:
In addition to continuous monitoring of oxygen saturations and measurement of respiratory rate, 
blood gas sampling is used to assess the response to acute NIV. Routine analysis 1 
hour after 
starting treatment with NIV is recommended, with additional sampling at 4 
hours and in the event of 
clinical deterioration.3
Studies show that improvements in pH and PaCO2 values, and a reduction in respiratory rate after 
2 
hours of NIV are strong predictors of treatment success.13 Conversely, failure of physiological 
improvement is associated with poor outcome and should prompt urgent clinical review by a 
healthcare professional with the necessary NIV competence to make clinical decisions. In the 
event of uncertainty, there should be access to a consultant with expertise in acute NIV to aid 
decision making.
NCEPOD’s study4 provides evidence of inadequate patient monitoring; case note reviewers found 
that blood gas sampling was too infrequent for 32% and that overall monitoring could have been 
improved for 54% of patients treated with NIV. Where sampling took place, the clinical response was 
often suboptimal; ventilator management was rated as inappropriate for 35% of patients. Clinical 
review did not take place for 31% of patients who deteriorated after starting acute NIV.
This quality statement aims to quantify the adequacy of the response to the deteriorating patient who 
is treated with acute NIV. It focuses on the first blood gas sample obtained after starting acute NIV 
as this is a stronger predictor for treatment failure than routine sampling at a later stage.14 However, 
other factors such as change in respiratory rate, heart rate, conscious level or clinical impression 
should be taken into account; an improving blood gas measurement should not deter a call for 
urgent clinical review if this is felt to be appropriate.

Quality measure:
Structure:
Evidence that all patients treated with acute NIV have a routine blood gas performed within 2 
hours 
of starting NIV. Failure of these blood gas results to improve (pH the same or worse/or PaCO2 the 
same or worse) should trigger review by a specialist healthcare professional (as defined in quality 
statement 2) within 30 
min.
Process:
 
► Proportion of patients who have a blood gas measurement within 2 
hours of starting acute NIV.
 
► Proportion of patients whose blood gas reveals a failure to improve and are seen by an 
appropriately trained specialist healthcare professional within 30 
min.
Numerator 1: number of patients who have a blood gas measurement within 2

acute NIV.
Denominator 1: total number of patients treated with acute NIV.
Numerator 2: number of occasions when specialist healthcare professional review takes place 
within 30 
min of a blood gas result that fails to improve in comparison with the pre-NIV blood gas 
measurement.
Denominator 2: number of occasions in which there is a blood gas result that fails to improve in 
comparison with the pre-NIV blood gas measurement.
What the quality 
statement means for 
each audience:
Service providers:
 
– Should ensure that all sites with an NIV service have a local operational policy that describes:A 
system that delivers timely blood gas analysis.
 
– Clear pathways to enable prompt upward titration of ventilation pressures and troubleshooting 
of common ventilator or mask-related issues.
 
– Access to a specialist able to review patients treated with NIV within 30 
min if needed.
 
– A method to record the time the specialist is called and attends, and a means to record their 
assessment and changes in management.
Healthcare professionals:
 
► Should ensure that the response to NIV is assessed early. Furthermore, the treating clinician 
should have access to an appropriate specialist colleague in a timely fashion to maximise the 
chance of delivering optimal care.
Commissioners:
 
► Should ensure that commissioned services have local policies and standards of care that will 
facilitate timely identification of patients whose treatment needs to be changed.
People who receive NIV:
 
► Should be assessed by a qualified healthcare professional within a short period of time if initial 
treatment is not having the desired effect.

The purpose of this specification is to improve the quality of care provided to patients receiving acute NIV. Issues in relation to the timeliness, appropriateness, location, 
level of care and competency of staff treating patients with acute NIV have been highlighted.
1
Provision of an NIV training programme for staff with responsibility to start or 
continue NIV.
2
Training portfolios of nurses/physiotherapists/ 
doctors/physiologists 
confirm that 
they have attended such training.
3
Staffing arrangements such that new/untrained 
members of staff with any 
responsibility for the care of patients treated with NIV are directly supervised by a 
trained member of staff until NIV competence is achieved and documented.
4
A rolling competency maintenance framework that is appropriate for their 
continued practice. This will differ according to role with the recommended 
approach as follows:
(1) Healthcare professionals with responsibility to make practical changes to 
NIV (eg, setting up NIV, adjusting ventilator settings and mask):
 
► annual review of competence, ideally observed by the trust lead for training.
(2) Healthcare professionals with responsibility for clinical decisions 
regarding NIV therapy:
 
► New staff (eg, rotating ST3+ grade) should receive a review of the theory and 
evidence base for NIV as part of their induction.
 
► Existing staff (eg, consultant with on-call responsibility for NIV) should review 
their competence annually via appraisal/mandatory 
training and should 
ensure attendance at an acute medical update that includes NIV within each 
revalidation cycle.

The purpose of this specification is to improve the quality of care provided to patients receiving acute NIV. Issues in relation to the timeliness, appropriateness, location, 
level of care and competency of staff treating patients with acute NIV have been highlighted.
1
Area: acute NIV should only be used in clinical areas equipped with:
a. Continuous pulse oximetry for all patients.
b. Continuous ECG monitoring for all patients with a clinical indication 
(pulse rate >120 
bpm, dysrhythmia or possible cardiomyopathy).
c. Point of care blood gas analyser within or adjacent to the NIV area.
d. An oxygen supply
2
Leadership: there should be a clinical lead for the NIV service with time 
allocated in their job plan, a designated lead nurse and, where appropriate, a 
designated lead physiotherapist.
3
Staffing: 1:2 nursing care should be provided for all patients treated with acute 
NIV until NIV requirements reduce to nocturnal use only. The local operational 
policy should include a management/escalation 
plan for critically ill patients 
who require increased (1:1) nursing care.
4
Equipment: all ventilators used to deliver acute NIV should be designed for 
this purpose. There should be sufficient quantity of masks and ventilators to 
meet the expected demand for NIV.
5
Service capacity: designated NIV area(s) should have sufficient capacity to 
meet the demand for acute NIV. If NIV starts in other areas, NIV trained staff 
should remain with the patient during delivery of NIV; the same monitoring 
should be provided and transfer to a designated NIV area should occur within 
4 
hours.
6
Governance: the NIV service should have:
a. A locally developed NIV protocol (based on published best practice 
guides) uniformly applied across all areas.
b. A process of regular audit (continuous rolling audit is recommended), 
including participation in national audits.
c. A robust morbidity and mortality process including rapid review of 
all inpatient deaths of patients treated with (or considered for) acute 
NIV including a respiratory physician or intensivist. Cases in which an 
omission in care is likely to have contributed to an avoidable death 
should be investigated as serious incidents.
