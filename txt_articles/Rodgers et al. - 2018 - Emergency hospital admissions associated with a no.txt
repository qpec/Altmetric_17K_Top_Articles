background We investigated tenant healthcare 
utilisation associated with upgrading 8558 council 
houses to a national quality standard. Homes received 
multiple internal and external improvements and 
were analysed using repeated measures of healthcare 
utilisation.
Methods The primary outcome was emergency 
hospital admissions for cardiorespiratory conditions and 
injuries for residents aged 60 years and over. Secondary 
outcomes included each of the separate conditions, 
for tenants aged 60 and over, and for all ages. Council 
home address and intervention records for eight 
housing cointerventions were anonymously linked to 
demographic data, hospital admissions and deaths for 
individuals in a dynamic cohort. Counts of health events 
were analysed using multilevel regression models to 
investigate associations between receipt of each housing 
improvement, adjusting for potential confounding factors 
and regional trends.
results Residents aged 60 years and over living in 
homes when improvements were made were associated 
with up to 39% fewer admissions compared with those 
living in homes that were not upgraded (incidence rate 
ratio=0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.72). Reduced admissions 
were associated with electrical systems, windows and 
doors, wall insulation, and garden paths. There were 
small non-significant reductions for the primary outcome 
associated with upgrading heating, adequate loft 
insulation, new kitchens and new bathrooms.
Conclusion Results suggest that hospital admissions 
can be avoided through improving whole home quality 
standards. This is the first large-scale longitudinal 
evaluation of a whole home intervention that has 
evaluated multiple improvement elements using 
individual-level objective routine health data.
InTroduCTIon
This paper examines changes in healthcare utili-
sation following improvements to bring council 
homes up to a national quality standard.1 2 People 
living in social housing generally have poorer health 
and other outcomes than the general population.3 
Poor housing quality has been associated with nega-
tive health impacts globally.4 It is recommended 
that policy to reduce health inequalities focuses 
on the wider determinants of health, including 
housing.5 6 Quantifiable evidence of the health 
impact and associated costs of healthcare utilisa-
tion as a result of poor housing quality is needed to 
ensure sufficient investment.
A systematic review of improvements to housing 
found evidence of health benefits following 
changes to thermal conditions, particularly where 
these interventions were targeted towards those 
with chronic respiratory conditions.7 8 Evidence 
of health improvements following interventions 
that were not specifically targeted at vulnerable 
groups were less clear; the impacts for everyone 
in a housing improvement area may conceal 
health improvements for vulnerable population 
subgroups. The studies included were predom-
inantly cross-sectional, had relatively limited 
follow-up periods and used self-reported health in 
most cases.9 10 The review concluded that precise 
housing conditions and mechanisms causing poor 
health need further investigation using robust 
study designs.
Evidence on whole home, housing-led inter-
ventions remains unclear.8 Multiple elements of a 
national housing intervention and their impact on 
self-reported physical and mental health have been 
evaluated previously using a quasi-experimental 
design using three waves of cross-sectional survey.10 
The study reported positive associations with mental 
health (kitchens and bathrooms, front doors) and 
physical health (building fabric works) but a nega-
tive association on physical health following instal-
lation of central heating.10 The ability to assess 
changes in well-being directly from participants 
rather than waiting for changes in healthcare util-
isation has certain advantages but introduces bias 
and restricts follow-up duration.8 10 Previously 
reported randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have 
evidenced health benefits using self-reported health 
data, or reduced healthcare utilisation, associated 
with an insulation or fall prevention intervention, 
respectively.11–13
We used more than a decade of linked individ-
ual-level data to investigate whether emergency 
hospital admission rates were associated with 
tenants whose homes were improved to meet 
national quality standards. To our knowledge there 
has been no evaluation of multifaceted housing 
interventions using data linkage and routinely 
collected data. We have followed the RECORD

study design
A longitudinal panel design was used to study multiple non-ran-
domised housing interventions and associations with health-
care utilisation. Each cointervention was observed at monthly 
intervals for all tenants for up to 123 months of follow-up. The 
study design provided, for each cointervention, a counterfac-
tual condition of living in a home that did not meet the housing 
quality standard (reference group). We compared changes in the 
health of tenants living in homes that received a housing cointer-
vention during their tenancy (exposure 1) with the reference. We 
also compared with the reference group changes in the health 
of tenants living in homes that already met the housing stan-
dard (exposure 2). Eight cointerventions were analysed using the 
monthly healthcare utilisation of all tenants, adjusting for trends 
in the wider population.
Intervention delivery was determined by the Council according 
to logistical constraints and was irrespective of health need. In 
total, there were 2047 possible intervention combinations, and 
homes were equally likely to receive each of the cointerventions 
during the decade intervention period.
Interventions
The type and date of improvements for each housing interven-
tion were sent from the Council to our trusted third party who 
anonymised these data into the Secure Anonymised Informa-
tion Linkage Databank.15 The eight cointerventions were new 
(1) windows and doors, (2) kitchens, (3) bathrooms, (4) heating 
systems, (5) wall insulation, (6) loft insulation, (7) electrical 
systems and (8) garden paths. The electrical systems cointer-
vention comprised smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detec-
tors, security lights, kitchen and bathroom extractor fans, and 
internal rewiring.1 16
Participants
Anonymisation of home addresses and intervention data was 
completed by a trusted third party.17 Subsequently, researchers 
had access to all the anonymised datasets to complete data 
linkage. Tenants were linked to council homes using the Welsh 
Demographic Service (WDS) dataset, containing patient-pro-
vided address and start and end dates, to determine who lived 
in each home throughout the study.18 Individuals who moved 
between homes were treated as separate observations; condi-
tions of their previous homes were not taken into account in 
analysing observations recorded at subsequent addresses. Start 
and end dates of tenancies were obtained for all residents to 
censor for migration and death, allowing derivation of a single 
exposure per person for each cointervention. The primary inclu-
sion criterion was that tenants were registered in one of the 
homes for at least 60 days between January 2005 and March 
2015. The WDS dataset was also used to determine who lived in 
all other properties in the region using the same rules to create a 
regional comparator group.
Variables
Emergency admissions were extracted from the Patient Episode 
Dataset for Wales, containing complete hospital admissions for 
all residents of Wales.19 Monthly counts of emergency admis-
sions for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, and inju-
ries for falls and burns, were generated and combined to form 
the primary outcome (see online supplementary appendix). 
The secondary outcomes were each of the emergency admissions 
separated into (1) cardiovascular, (2) respiratory conditions and 
(3) injuries (falls and burns). The primary outcome of combined 
admissions was analysed for a subpopulation group of tenants 
aged 60 years and over, before analysing the secondary outcomes 
of each admission type separately. The secondary outcomes were 
then analysed for tenants of all ages.
Potentially confounding variables included age (<25 years 
old, 25–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 and 80+), sex (male, 
female), comorbidity (0, 1+; see online supplementary appendix, 
table 1), income deprivation (Welsh Index of Multiple Depri-
vation Income Domain tertiles, 1=least deprived to 3=most 
deprived), rurality (Office for National Statistics classification, 
1=village 
and hamlet, 2=town 
and fringe, 3=urban) and year 
of study (2005, 2006,…, 2015). Age, comorbidity, rurality and 
deprivation were updated monthly. Monthly counts of emer-
gency admissions were also derived for the regional comparator 
group to adjust for background admission trends. Codes for 
selection of conditions contributing to comorbidities are listed 
in the online supplementary appendix.
We followed the three groups, comprising one reference and 
two exposure groups, for each of the eight cointerventions 
before housing improvements were made from 2005, and during 
the intervention period from 2007 to 2015. Individuals were 
categorised differently, and analysed separately, for each of the 
eight cointerventions.
statistical analysis
Separate effect estimates were obtained for each cointervention 
incorporating counts of emergency admissions within negative 
binomial models, using random effects (to adjust for autocor-
relation of observations for the same individuals over time) and 
adjusting for potential confounders. Repeated measures multi-
level models with 123 monthly observations over time (level 
1) nested within tenants (level 2) allowed us to take account of 
clustering of observations over time. This also helped to handle 
unbalanced data, where the number of observations varied for 
individuals, an artefact of dynamic cohorts. In order to adjust 
for the non-constant observation periods among individuals, 
we included a log offset of the number of person days observed 
in each month as an offset in the modelling framework. The 
observation periods were used to convert results to a person-
time rate.20 Model coefficients were converted to incident rate 
ratios (IRRs) to aid interpretation. The IRRs represent the effect 
estimate of change in outcome intervention groups as compared 
with the reference group, for each of the different cointerven-
tions. We have discussed these effect estimates in terms of associ-
ations in our Results and Discussion sections. All other variables 
in the model were held constant. We report the 95% CI and 
exact p values to four decimal places. The results are displayed 
graphically with their 95% CIs to help with interpretation.
resulTs
Over the study period, 32 
009 tenant participants were registered 
to a study home. The study population remained stable over the 
study period, providing 183 
553 person years of follow-up, with 
an average of 18 
031 observed per year. Over 45% of tenants 
were registered to a study home for the entire observation 
window, contributing to all 123 monthly records in the study 
period. Healthcare utilisation was intentionally captured only 
for the time of their tenancy; therefore, there was no loss to 
follow-up of outcomes for registered data linked tenants. The

research report
regional comparator provided a large number of person years of 
follow-up to adjust for background trends (231 
200 people and 
1 628 554 person years). Descriptive statistics are presented in 
table 1.
The number of people in the reference and two exposure 
groups varied for each cointervention. For the electrical systems 
cointervention, there was one home with missing information 
about electrical systems (6 tenants, 0.02%), leaving 32 
003 
tenants out of a total 32 
009 study tenants. Tenants who left 
the home prior to work completion, and a small number living 
in homes that had not yet received the cointervention by the 
end of the study period, were assigned to the reference group 
(n=12 
726, 40%). In total, 13 
358 tenants (42%) had their elec-
trical systems upgraded during their tenancy and were assigned 
to exposure 1, and 5919 tenants (18%) whose homes already 
met the standard before their tenancy began were assigned to 
exposure 2.
outcome data
There were 7296 primary outcome admissions for 27% of 
the study group tenants aged 60 years and over (table 2). Ten 
per cent of the study group participants of all ages contributed 
to 10 
524 emergency admissions to hospital for the primary 
outcome admissions. The adjusted results for the primary 
outcome population of tenants aged 60 and over are presented 
in tables 3 and 4, and for tenants of all ages in tables 5 and 
6. The adjusted and unadjusted results for tenants aged 60 years 
and over and tenants of all ages are presented in online supple-
mentary appendix tables 2 and 3.
Tenants aged 60 years and over
Primary outcome, exposure 1
All cointerventions were associated with a reduction in admis-
sions for tenants aged 60 years and over receiving the upgrades 
during their tenancy (table 3, figure 1A, circles). The largest 
association was for the electrical system cointervention (−39%). 
Large associations were also found for new windows and doors 
(−29%), wall insulation (−25%) and garden paths (−27%). 
Smaller associations were found for loft insulation (−2%), 
heating systems (−9%), kitchens (−2%) and bathrooms (−7%).
Primary outcome, exposure 2
Several cointerventions were associated with a reduction in 
emergency hospital admissions for tenants aged 60 years and 
over who moved into a home that already met the housing stan-
dard for different cointerventions. The largest reduction (−34%) 
was again associated with electrical systems (table 4, figure 1A, 
triangles). Large associations were also found for windows 
and doors (−20%), wall insulation (−27%) and garden paths 
(−17%). New heating systems and kitchens were associated 
with small increases in emergency admissions (+3% 
and +9%, 
respectively).
Secondary outcomes, exposure 1
When we separated our primary outcome into its component 
conditions and repeated our analyses, we saw widening CIs but 
a similar pattern overall, with most cointerventions associated 
with reductions in admissions (table 3, figure 1B–D, circles). The 
largest association was a 57% reduction in respiratory condition 
emergency admissions with the electrical system cointervention. 
Heating systems were associated with a smaller 15% decrease 
in respiratory admissions. Increased respiratory admissions were 
associated with loft insulation (+18%) and kitchens (+17%).
Secondary outcomes, exposure 2
For cardiovascular admissions there were associated reductions 
for all cointerventions, apart from those tenants who moved 
into a home with a heating system or kitchen already meeting 
the housing standard (+12% 
and +18%, respectively). Similar 
to exposure 1 tenants, heating systems were again associated 
with a small decrease in respiratory admissions (−8%). Injury 
admissions had associations in different directions for kitchens 
(−25% for exposure 1, +18% 
for exposure 2), which reversed 
for bathrooms (+18% 
for exposure 1, −44% for exposure 2).

Tenants of all ages
Primary outcome, exposure 1
Six out of the eight cointerventions were associated with reduced 
admissions for current tenants of all ages. Large associations were 
found for windows and doors (−22%), wall insulation (−20%), 
electrical systems (−34%) and garden paths (−19%) (table 5, 
figure 2A, circles). Smaller reductions in hospital admissions were 
associated with heating systems (−8%) and bathrooms (−1%). In 
contrast to tenants aged 60 years and over, there were increases in 
hospital admissions associated with loft insulation (+2%) and new 
kitchens (+1%) for tenants of all ages.
Primary outcome, exposure 2
There were reductions associated with five of the cointer-
ventions for tenants in homes that were already considered 
up to standard. The reductions were comparable with those 
for current tenants, with loft insulation associated with a 1% 
increase and kitchens with a 2% increase (table 6, figure 2A, 
triangles). The heating system cointervention was notable for 
associations in different directions; the small (−8%) reduc-
tion in admissions for current tenants changed to an increase 
(+23%) in admissions for tenants who moved into homes with 
existing heating systems.

research report
Secondary outcomes, exposure 1
The degree of association and direction was generally maintained 
when the cardiovascular, respiratory and injury emergency 
admissions were separated into their component conditions 
(table 6). However, exposure 1 tenants living in homes that 
received new bathrooms were associated with an increase in 
injury admissions (+27%).
Secondary outcomes, exposure 2
There was a large increase (+31%) (figure 2B, triangles) asso-
ciated with cardiovascular admissions for tenants moving into 
homes with a heating system already up to standard. Similar 
associations were found for respiratory admissions (figure 2C). 
In contrast to a new bathroom, people whose homes had existing 
bathrooms meeting the housing standards were associated with a 
reduction in injury admissions (−20%, figure 2D).
dIsCussIon
The main results of this study were that the housing inter-
vention was associated with a decrease in emergency hospital 
admissions within the decade-long evaluation period. There was 
a reduction in the primary outcome of combined emergency 
admissions for cardiorespiratory conditions and injuries, asso-
ciated with all cointerventions. When we examined emergency 
admissions for the separate conditions, the largest reduction 
was for respiratory conditions. There were also decreases for 
admissions relating to cardiovascular conditions and fall and 
burn injuries.
We used the ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised 
Studies - of Interventions) assessment for Non-Randomised 
Studies of Interventions to assess the study design and highlight 
strengths and weaknesses.21 Lack of participant randomisation 
means some confounding and selection bias may be present; 
however, the intervention design was independent from health 
need and researcher influence. In line with the ROBINS-I assess-
ment tool, we concluded there was moderate bias compared 
with a well-designed RCT.
In addition to lack of randomisation, other study limitations 
included a lack of information on the initial housing quality. We 
were limited to a binary status of meeting or not meeting the 
housing standard. We recommend that data on initial housing 
conditions are collected in future, and analyses take this, and 
the magnitude of improvement variations between homes, into 
account. Although we treated each cointervention separately in 
the same statistical model, in practice, there are likely to have 
been correlations between each, for example kitchen and bath-
room improvements. As such the results of associations should 
be read in terms of their relative magnitude and used to increase 
understanding of the potential mechanisms for health improve-
ment as a result of a whole home intervention.

research report
The strengths of our study included our use of routinely 
collected data for a complete housing cohort, removal of recall 
bias, a long follow-up time and the adjustment for multiple 
confounders. We had complete data for hospital admissions and 
death registrations and were able to censor people who moved 
out of intervention homes, allocating exact exposures to the 
intervention by the number of days registered to a property. We 
were able to examine council housing population subgroups 
using individual-level data, removing the possibility of concealing 
health improvements within areas for the total council housing 
population receiving the intervention.22 We analysed all people 
living in council intervention homes for whom we had health 
records within the databank, which was close to 100%. Our 
study design allowed us to estimate health utilisation associated 
with each cointervention, for tenants aged 60 years and over and 
tenants of all ages, allowing direct comparisons between groups 
depending on their exposure status.
Our results support evidence from previous RCT studies. 
A cluster RCT found reduced odds of self-reported health, 
including wheezing (−43%) and less frequent visits to a 
general practitioner, and a trend for reduced hospital admis-
sions for respiratory conditions (adjusted OR 0.53, 95% CI 
0.22 to 1.29).23 A randomised home heating intervention 
evaluating the health of children with asthma found that

having received a more effective non-polluting heater was 
associated with reduced visits to a general practitioner 
(adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62).13 Another study 
randomised low-income participants to receive a home modi-
fication intended to reduce falls. Administrative data were 
used to evaluate randomly allocated low-income participants 
to a fall reduction home modification resulting in a 26% 
reduction in injury rate for the treatment group compared 
with the control group. When injuries were more narrowly 
specified to the home modification, the intervention group 
injury rate was reduced to 39% (adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 
0.41 to 0.91).11
This is the largest, most comprehensive analysis to date 
of a concentrated programme bringing housing quality to 
national standards and its associations with healthcare utilisa-
tion. This was made possible using data linkage at household 
and individual levels, and findings highlight a substan-
tial potential for multicomponent housing programmes to 
improve health overall as evaluated using the proxy of emer-
gency healthcare utilisation.18 24 We analysed health service 
utilisation for population subgroups and several conditions 
anticipated to change as a result of several housing quality 
improvements. The results shown here provide evidence of 
health benefits, indicated by a reduction in emergency admis-
sions to hospital, following improvements in social housing 
conditions that could be achieved through the implementa-
tion of a similar programme of work.
These results have important policy implications. First, 
they highlight the reduction in health service utilisation 
through a large decrease in hospital admissions, one of 
the most expensive components of healthcare costs. 
Evidencing a reduction in admissions due to housing 
condition improvements may encourage an integrated 
housing, health and social care system.25 Second, the costs 
incurred through providing the housing improvements 
may be partially offset by the reduction in hospital admis-
sions, or would release a number of hospital beds for other 
admissions. Third, the provision of adequate housing is 
likely to impact on other health, social and educational 
outcomes. We recommend that research is undertaken 
to evaluate if children living in improved homes have 
improved their school attendance and educational attain-
ment. This would likely lead to improved labour market 
chances and improved health literacy, and to narrowing 
inequalities in the long term. Progress is under way to 
improve social housing to meet the Welsh Housing Quality 
Standard (WHQS) throughout Wales by 2020, and the 
results here provide compelling evidence to extend this 
housing quality standard to all low-income households in 
maritime temperate regions.

What is already known on this subject
 
► Ecological studies are insufficiently targeted at the residents 
receiving home improvements to evidence changes in health.
 
►  Two randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies investigated 
separately home improvements for insulation or fall 
prevention modifications, and showed improvements in 
respiratory conditions and fall-related healthcare utilisation, 
respectively. 
 
►  To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated a complex 
multipart housing intervention using a decade of routinely 
linked objective data. 
What this study adds
 
► Using up to a decade of household improvements linked to 
individual level data, we found that social housing quality 
improvements were associated with substantial reductions in 
emergency hospital admissions for cardiovascular conditions, 
respiratory conditions, and fall and burn injuries. 
 
► We assessed potential bias in this non-randomised study of 
a complex intervention and concluded that despite a lack 
of randomisation, there was only a moderate level of bias 
compared with a well-designed RCT. 
 
► Our results emphasise the importance of using routine 
linked data to evaluate interventions as a result of policy 
or economic changes; large-scale system change data may 
be used to follow up long-term healthcare utilisation for 
individuals.
