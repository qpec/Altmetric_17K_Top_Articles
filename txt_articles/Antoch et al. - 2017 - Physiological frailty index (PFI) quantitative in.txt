INTRODUCTION 
 
Mammalian aging is characterized by a gradual 
decline of numerous health parameters with multiple 
biochemical, physiological and behavioral manifest-
tations [1].  These include reduced muscle strength, 
bone degeneration, osteoporosis, an increase in 
systemic inflammation, vascular calcification, hair 
loss, cataracts, cognitive decline, etc. [2]. Several 
animal models including C.elegans, yeast, Drosophila 
and rodents (rats and mice) have been successfully 
used over the last several decades to address 
mechanistic aspects of aging and development of age-
related diseases. In most of these studies the major 
metric  parameter for  assessing  pro-/anti-aging  effect 
 
 
of genetic, nutritional or pharmacological manipulation 
has been the animals’ lifespan.   
 
While being informative, longevity by itself however, 
cannot provide an assessment of the animal’s health 
status, which, like in humans, can significantly decline 
at older ages and therefore reduce the quality of life. 
This concern is particularly relevant to research focused 
on developing the “healthspan”-extending pharma-
ceuticals , efficacy of which may not be necessarily 
translated in increased longevity but rather in 
prolongation of healthy life and require quantitative 
objective assessment. Clinical studies in humans 
measure  age-related declines  in performance  by  quan-

ABSTRACT 
 
The development of healthspan‐extending pharmaceuticals requires quantitative estimation of age‐related
progressive physiological decline. In humans, individual health status can be quantitatively assessed by means
of a frailty index (FI), a parameter which reflects the scale of accumulation of age‐related deficits. However,
adaptation of this methodology to animal models is a challenging task since it includes multiple subjective
parameters. Here we report a development of a quantitative non‐invasive procedure to estimate biological age
of an individual animal by creating physiological frailty index (PFI). We demonstrated the dynamics of PFI
increase during chronological aging of male and female NIH Swiss mice. We also demonstrated acceleration of
growth of PFI in animals placed on a high fat diet, reflecting aging acceleration by obesity and provide a tool for
its quantitative assessment. Additionally, we showed that PFI could reveal anti‐aging effect of mTOR inhibitor
rapatar (bioavailable formulation of rapamycin) prior to registration of its effects on longevity. PFI revealed
substantial sex‐related differences in normal chronological aging and in the efficacy of detrimental (high fat
diet) or beneficial (rapatar) aging modulatory factors. Together, these data introduce PFI as a reliable, non‐
invasive, quantitative tool suitable for testing potential anti‐aging pharmaceuticals in pre‐clinical studies.

tifying 
the 
frailty 
index 
(FI), 
which 
reflects 
accumulation of health deficits during chronological 
aging [3].  
 
Since numerous studies have shown that many age-
associated changes that occur in humans are also 
present in aged mice, FI was recently introduced as a 
measure of mouse aging to pre-clinical models [4]. 
However, standardized and comprehensive approaches 
for FI measurements, which will address changes in a 
broad spectrum of physiological functions, are still 
missing. Here we describe development of an 
alternative scoring system, based on a selected set of 
non-invasive quantitative and physiological parameters, 
which could be repetitively used in the same animal 
over the course of its entire lifespan. We refer to this set 
of parameters as physiological frailty index (PFI). We 
show that similar to results of human studies older mice 
have 
much 
greater 
PFI 
reflecting 
age-related 
accumulation of deficits. We also validated our 
approach of PFI by testing detrimental (feeding high fat 
diet, HFD) and beneficial (treatment with mTOR 
inhibitor rapamycin) factors on animals’ longevity and 
healthspan and revealed significant sex-dependent 
differences, thus emphasizing the importance of 
including both male and female animals in pre-clinical 
studies. The results of our study provide a feasible tool 
applicable for pre-clinical studies to test the efficacy of 
anti-aging pharmaceuticals.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Choosing informative parameters for creating PFI 
 
To select which physiological parameters to choose for 
creating reliable FI we used several criteria. First, we 
wanted them to be diverse to reflect the status of 
different health-related physiological systems. Second, 
we wanted them to be objective and quantitative and not 
to involve any visual scoring. Finally, we wanted them 
to be minimally invasive so they can be applied in 
longitudinal studies.  Based on these considerations, we 
selected 29 variables reflective of physical fitness (body 
weight and grip strength), cardiovascular system 
(systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, heart rate, 
tail blood flow and tail blood volume), total blood cell 
composition (white and red blood cell counts and 
differentials), plasma concentration of CXCL1/KC, 
triglycerides and glucose.  All variables were measured 
in male and female NIH Swiss mice of different 
chronological ages (CA) of 26, 52, 78 and 104 weeks in a 
cross-sectional study. Next, using one-way ANOVA 
analysis, we identified those variables that demonstrate 
statistically significant changes during aging (p-value 
<0.05). Out of total of 29 parameters, 16 and 18 qualified 
these criteria in males and females respectively. These 
parameters and corresponding mean values for each age 
group are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.  Interestingly, 
the two lists have only partial overlap pointing to sex-
specific differences in the process of aging.

Quantification of PFI in chronologically aged male 
and female NIH/Swiss mice 
 
To quantitatively evaluate age-dependent accumulation 
of health deficits, male and female NIH Swiss mice 
were allowed to age in the animal facility under normal 
husbandry conditions. Separate groups of male and 
female mice were tested for their overall health status at 
the ages of 26, 52, 78, and 104 weeks as described in 
Materials and Methods section. PFI was created using 
the 26-week old mice as a reference so that deviation of 
each parameter from the mean value was calculated. As 
shown in Fig.1A, PFI demonstrates gradual increase 
with age in both males and females; however, dynamics 
of this process was different. Consistent with previous 
studies, both in mice and humans [5], females show a 
more rapid accumulation of health deficits than males 
and average PFI values were higher compared to the 
males of the corresponding age.  
 
Although average value of PFI showed highly 
statistically significant increase with age, within each 
age-matched group it demonstrated considerable 
individual variability (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with 
widely accepted concept originated from human and 
animal model studies stating that chronological age 
(CA, the actual age from the date of birth) and 
biological age (BA, reflecting individual’s health status) 
are different [6-8]. To test whether PFI value can be 
used as a predictor of an individual animal’s BA, 
polynomial regression of order 3 was fit to the data 
using a stepwise regression approach.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The best fitting models were given as:  
 
PFI=0.00684+0.0034�BA for males and 
FI=-0.67372+0.04277�CA-0.00057899�CA2 
+0.00000263 �CA3 for females.    
 
Next, we used these equations to calculate BA of each 
individual animal based on its PFI. Fig. 1C presents 
results of this analysis showing high degree of 
variability of estimated BA within the group of 
chronologically age-matched male and female mice. 
Overall these data indicate that our scoring system 
allows for an unbiased and reliable quantitation of age-
related accumulation of deficits. They also suggest that 
PFI may be used as a tool for evaluating health status of 
an individual animal and determining its BA. This tool 
may be applied for quantitative assessment of the 
effects of various environmental, nutritional and 
pharmacological interventions on healthspan.  
 
Sex-dependent effect of high fat diet on PFI and 
longevity  
 
To validate our approach for assessing animal’s BA, we 
subjected them to two treatments known to cause 
detrimental (feeding high fat diet, HFD) or beneficial 
(administration of rapamycin) effects on health and 
longevity. Fifty two week old male and female NIH 
Swiss mice were randomly assigned to four groups.    
Group 1 remained on regular chow and drinking water; 
group 2 remained on regular chow but started receiving 
rapamycin in drinking water. Group 3 started receiving 
HFD in combination with normal drinking water and 
group 4 was fed HFD in combination with rapamycin.

It is well established that HFD-induced obesity has a 
detrimental effect on health increasing the risk of 
diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and cancer 
[9]. As shown in Fig. 2A, feeding HFD results in 
significant increase in body weight in both males and 
females (40% and 30% for males and females 
respectively). Nevertheless, effect on longevity was 
very different. Whereas feeding HFD reduced lifespan 
of male NIH Swiss mice from 121.1+9.2 to 91.5+5.9 
weeks (p=0.008, Kaplan-Meier log-rank test), it had no 
effect on longevity of female mice (109.6 +6.9 and 
104.9+7.7 weeks for mice fed regular or high fat chow 
respectively; Fig. 2B).  This result is consistent with 
previous studies showing that female mice are protected 
against HFD-induced metabolic changes by maintaining 
an anti-inflammatory environment in the intra-
abdominal adipose tissue, whereas HFD-fed male mice 
develop adipose tissue inflammation, glucose into-
lerance, hyperinsulinemia, and islet hypertrophy [10]. 
 
To further test whether reduction in lifespan in males 
correlates with an increase in accumulation of health 
deficits, after 26 weeks of feeding HFD (at the age of 78 
weeks) we created PFI for each individual animal.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with longevity data, feeding HFD significant- 
ly increased PFI in male but not in female mice (Fig. 
2C). These data indicate that HFD-induced obesity 
produces stronger damaging effect in male mice 
affecting both their longevity and health status and that 
our approach can reliably detect overall health decline 
in a quantitative manner.  
 
Chronic treatment with rapamycin increases the 
lifespan of female NIH Swiss mice without affecting 
their health status 
 
To further validate our method, we decided to test 
whether we can reliably measure the beneficial effects 
of lifespan increasing approaches on animals’ health. 
For this we chose to use rapamycin, which has been 
shown to extend lifespan of inbred and genetically 
heterogeneous mice [11, 12] as well as of mice that 
develop syndrome of premature aging [13]. Several 
studies performed in cancer-prone animal models 
suggest that rapamycin extends lifespan by delaying 
tumor development and progression [11, 14, 15].  In our 
previous work, we successfully used nanoformulated 
water soluble rapamycin (rapatar), which  can  be  admi-

nistered with drinking water and demonstrated high 
bioavailability [14]. In concurrence with the previous 
study, chronic administration of rapatar did not cause 
any toxicity as both male and female mice in control 
and experimental groups maintained similar body 
weight (Fig. 3A).  However, there was a significant 
difference in the effect of rapamycin on longevity 
between the sexes. Chronic rapamycin treatment had no 
effect on longevity of male mice (mean survival 
113.91+6.98 and 100.8+6.96 weeks for control and 
rapamycin-treated 
mice respectively) whereas in 
females, it increased lifespan from 110.09+7.12 to 
131.23+8.29 weeks (p=0.05, Kaplan-Meier log-rank 
test; Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, this effect was not 
translated into improved health status between the 
groups as monitored by PFI (Fig. 3C). Thus, our data 
provides an additional support for the concept that 
chronological and biological aging may not be 
intrinsically identical and that other factors besides time 
may affect the pace of age-dependent functional decline.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rapamycin alleviates detrimental effect of high fat 
diet on male mice longevity and healthspan 
 
Our data show that HFD-induced obesity shortens 
lifespan and deteriorates health status of NIH Swiss 
male mice (Fig. 1). It has been previously demonstrated 
that 
in 
rodents 
HFD-induced 
obesity 
increases 
activation of mTOR pathway in liver and skeletal 
muscle [16]. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment 
with rapamycin can ameliorate detrimental effects of 
HFD. Comparison of the dynamics of body weight 
change showed that chronic treatment with rapamycin 
did not affect HFD-induced obesity in male mice but 
did prevent it in females (Fig. 4A). Longevity was not 
affected in mice of both sexes (Fig. 4B) constituting 
91.45+5.87 and 100.55+6.26 weeks for male (p=0.26) 
and 105.01+7.74 and 110.50+7.58 weeks for female 
mice (p=0.6). Strikingly, rapamycin administration 
significantly alleviated detrimental effects of HFD in 
male mice as judged  by  a  significant  decrease  in  PFI

AGING 
To further illustrate the complex effects of diet and 
rapamycin on animal’s health, we calculated projected 
biological age of each 78 week old male and female 
mouse based on their PFI. Results of this analysis are 
presented in Fig. 5. Similar to our data for 
chronologically aged mice, we observed a significant 
individual variability within each experimental group 
of age-matched animals. The data showed that feeding 
HFD increases mean BA of male mice by 34 weeks 
(from 62.7+13.3 to 96.4+8.8 weeks; p=0.03,  Student’s

improves animals’ health status and reduces their BA 
to values characteristic for control group (from 
96.4+8.8 to 71.5+9.6 weeks (p=0.04, Student’s t-test; 
Fig. 5B).   No difference between groups was detected 
in female mice, in which BA was very close to their 
CA in all groups. Slight reduction of BA in rapa-

was not statistically significant (p=0.3 Student’s t-

Figure 5. Sex‐specific effects of detrimental (HFD) and beneficial (rapamycin) factors on BA of NIH Swiss mice. Feeding
HFD accelerates aging of NIH Swiss male mice whereas rapamycin counteracts this process.  Projected biological age of individual
mice (shown by circles) and mean BA for the group (black marker) were calculated from the corresponding FI value using the fitting
model predictions. Red line designates chronological age of all mice at the time of testing (78 weeks). Data show that projected BA of
all mice that received HFD (green circles) is significantly higher that their actual chronological age and mean BA age for control group
on regular diet (62.7+13.3 and 96.4+8.8 weeks for RDW and HFDW groups respectively (p=0.03, Student’s t‐test). Chronic
administration of rapamycin reduces BA of males fed HFD to values characteristic for control group (from 96.4+8.8 to 71.5+9.6 weeks;
p=0.04, Student’s t‐test).   No difference between groups was detected in female mice, in which BA was very close to their CA. Slight
reduction in BA in rapamycin treated group from 71.8+7.8 to 62.6+7.0 weeks was not statistically significant (p=0.3 Student’s t‐test).

AGING 
To confirm the preventive role of rapamycin in the 
development of diet-induced obesity, at completion of 
the experiment we performed hematoxylin-eosin and 
Oil Red O staining of livers of male mice fed HFD in 
combination with either normal water or rapamycin. 
Fig. 6A shows examples of H&E staining that were 
graded from the best to the worst within each group 
demonstrating 
larger 
and 
more 
lipid 
droplet 
accumulation in liver parenchyma in high-fat diet group 
and significant improvement of hepatic steatosis by 
rapamycin administration. These conclusions were 
consistent with the results of the Oil Red O staining 
(Fig. 6B).  Taken together, these data suggest that our 
approach for frailty assessment allows for reliable and 
quantitative evaluation of animal’s health status both 
during normal aging process as well as after various 
interventions. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Aging is characterized by accumulation of deficits and 
increased frailty, which in turn increases vulnerability 
of an older organism to various stressors. In clinical 
gerontology two major tools were developed to evaluate 
frailty in elderly: the phenotype model and FI (reviewed 
in [17]). The phenotype model describes frailty as a 
phenotype that can be scored using 5 criteria of 
patient’s physical performance [18]. In contrast, FI 
represents cumulative score of a degree of deviation that 
multiple 
behavioral, 
physical 
and 
physiological 
parameters developed with age compared to normal 
values characteristic to healthy young individuals [3]. 
Since FI was introduced to human gerontology, it was 
used in many epidemiological and clinical studies to 
evaluate the risk of adverse health events in elderly. 
These include a decline in overall activity, reduced 
muscle strength, bone degeneration, osteoporosis, an 
increase in inflammation, vascular calcification, hair 
loss, cataracts, cognitive decline, etc.  
 
The strategy of estimating FI as a measurement of 
health status has been also applied to the mouse models 
[19, 20]. However, the majority of frailty assessment 
tools use multiple observational approaches such as 
recording and scoring of visible pathologies (eye 
inflammation or cataracts, high respiratory rate, visible 
tumors, alopecia, dermatitis, distended abdomen etc.), 
or behavioral signs (circling behavior, reduced or 
excessive grooming, etc.). Although informative, this 
approach 
has 
some 
significant 
limitations 
and 
researcher bias.  First, these parameters are subjective 
by nature and require scoring by several independent 
raters in consistent manner [21-23]. Secondly, many 
health problems start a lot earlier than could be detected 
by their visual manifestation. Therefore, the goal of our 
study was to develop a reliable, quantitative scoring 
system, physiological frailty index (PFI) that would be 
based on non-invasive quantitative measurements of 
various physiological parameters, which could be 
repetitively used in the same animal during the course 
of its entire lifespan and would represent its overall 
health status.   
 
Several previous studies suggest that the more diverse 
variables are used for creating the FI, more reliable FI 
value is [24]. At the same time to optimize the 
robustness of the procedure in order to make it 
applicable to a large number of animals, we were 
inclined to minimize the number of variables. This 
rationale was supported by several previous studies, 
which reported good correlation between FI calculated 
with 8 and 31 items [24]. Therefore, after measuring 29 
diverse physiological parameters including physical 
(body weight and grip strength), blood cell composition, 
metabolic, and immune, we selected those that show 
statistically significant change with age. These 
parameters were used to create PFI of individual mice 
of different chronological age. The observed gradual 
increase in mean PFI values with age suggests that our 
approach can reliably detect the scale of age-dependent 
health deterioration in a quantitative manner.  
 
Interestingly, the dynamics of deficit accumulation 
appeared to be very gender-specific. Thus, in male NIH 
Swiss mice increase in PFI can be approximated by 
linear function suggesting that health deficits are evenly 
accumulated with age. In females the dynamics of 
increase in PFI is more complicated with sharp increase 
observed between 26 and 52 weeks of age followed by a 
period of almost no change (between 52 and 78 weeks) 
and a second increase after 78 weeks. This is an 
important observation that has to be considered in both 
pre-clinical and clinical studies. First, it points to 
fundamental sex-related differences in the process of 
aging and consequently, has to be taken into account 
when developing strategies for treatment of aging and 
age-related diseases. Second, our data provide an 
additional explanation for numerous examples of sexual 
dimorphism in response to life-extending genetic or 
pharmacological interventions. Although clear mecha-
nistic details of this phenomenon are still not 
understood, most of the previous reports linked it to 
interactions of the interventions with sex hormones, sex 
differences in immune function or in distribution of 
adipose tissue  and accordingly differences in the effects 
of its secretory activity (reviewed in [25]).  Our results 
suggest that in addition to basic gender differences, 
females’ response to treatments may vary depending on 
the age at which it is applied. Thus, based on observed 
sex-related differences in the pattern of deficits 
accumulation, the lack of effects of both detrimental 
and beneficial interventions on the health status of 
 www.aging‐us.com 
623 
AGING 
female mice may be explained by the fact that 
treatments started at 52 weeks of age (beginning of “no-
change” period in females) and the FI was measured at 
the end of this phase (78 weeks).   
 
Our results in the experiment with chronic rapamycin 
treatment showing an increase in lifespan of female 
NIH Swiss mice without improvement in their health, 
underscores the importance of using health status as the 
major 
metrics 
in 
development 
of 
anti-aging 
therapeutics. These data are consistent with previous 
observations 
made 
in 
different 
model 
systems 
demonstrating that increase in longevity is not 
necessarily accompanied by improved health status. 
Such as, caloric restriction extends lifespan in 
Drosophila without improving their cognitive function 
[26]. Long-lived calorie-restricted mice and IGF-1 
knockout mice develop multiple health deficits [27, 28]. 
Recent 
work 
in 
C. 
elegans, 
which 
measured 
simultaneously worms’ longevity and health status,   
demonstrated that four different long-lived mutants that 
were used in the study increased the proportion of time 
spent in a frail state [29].  Altogether, we suggest that 
our approach allows for unbiased and reliable 
assessment of healthspan by quantitation of age-related 
accumulation of deficits during chronological aging 
than may serve as a valuable tool in a variety of pre-
clinical 
aging 
studies. 
Importantly, 
experimental 
validation of this approach demonstrated its ability to 
quantitatively evaluate detrimental effect of HFD on 
animal’s health as well as the ability of rapamycin to 
mitigate it, thereby providing an alternative age-
accelerated model for testing the effects of various 
environmental, 
nutritional 
and 
pharmacological 
interventions on healthspan.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Animals 
 
Male and female Cr:NIH(S) Mice (NIH Swiss) mice 
were purchased from Charles River at the age of 6-8 
weeks and were allowed to age at the RPCI Animal 
Facility. During this time mice were housed 1-3 per 
cage and were fed ad lib with standard chow (Tekland 
Global 18% Pretein Rodent Diet). To quantitatively 
evaluate age-dependent decline in animals’ health, FI 
was created for individual male and female mouse at 26, 
52, 78 and 104 weeks of age as described below using 
cross-sectional experimental design (10-14 mice per 
group). In a separate experiment, male and female mice 
(9-14 per group) were randomly assigned to four 
groups. Group 1 remained on regular chow and drinking 
water; group 2 remained on regular chow but started 
receiving rapamycin in drinking water. Group 3 started 
receiving high fat diet (Harlan Laboratories, TD.03584, 
35% Lard Diet) in combination with normal drinking 
water and group 4 received HFD in combination with 
rapamycin.  Rapamycin was delivered in the form of 
Rapatar (polymeric formulation developed by Everon 
Biosciences as previously described [14] at a 
concentration of 125 mg/L (corresponds to 2.5 mg/L 
rapamycin).  Based on the assumption that mice drink 
3-5ml water per day, we estimated that in average each 
animal received 7.5-12.5 µg rapamycin daily. To 
preserve rapamycin stability in was delivered in non-
acidified water in light-protected water bottles, which 
were replaced twice/week. When mice were 78 weeks 
of age FI was created for each individual animal as 
described below. Mice remained on their designated 
feeding/water schedules for the rest of the experiments 
and their longevity was recorded. Data for males and 
females were analyzed separately. All animal studies 
were conducted in accordance with the regulations of 
the Committee on Animal Care and Use at Roswell 
Park Cancer Institute.  
 
Grip strength measurement 
 
Fore limb grip strength measurements were performed 
using Animal Grip Strength System (San Diego 
Instruments). Five measurements were recorded for 
each individual animal and the average value was 
assigned.  
 
Non-invasive 
measurement 
of 
hemodynamic 
parameters 
 
Non-invasive measurement of hemodynamic parameters 
was performed using CODA apparatus (Kent Scientific) 
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Mice were placed 
into cylinder-shaped restraint devices and allowed to 
acclimate for 5 min on a heating platform before blood 
pressure measurements begin.  Body temperature was 
continuously monitored by observation of animal 
behavior, tail blood volume and an infrared thermo-
meter. Recorded hemodynamic parameters include 
systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, heart rate, 
tail blood flow and tail blood volume.  
 
Blood samples collection 
 
To 
evaluate 
age-dependent 
changes 
in 
blood 
composition, blood samples were collected using the 
least invasive method that does not require anesthesia or 
restraining. Twenty µl of blood was collected from a 
single submandibular vein bleed into EDTA-treated 
Vacutainer tubes (BD) and used for whole blood cell 
counts and glucose measurements. Another 75ul of 
blood was collected into Li-Heparin treated plasma 
separator tubes; plasma was purified by centrifugation 
at 5000 x g for 5 min and used for measuring con-

centration of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and triglycerides.  
 
Whole blood cell counts, blood chemistry and 
inflammatory cytokines 
 
Whole blood cell analysis was performed in 20 µl  of 
blood using Hemavet 950 Analyzer (Drew Scientific). 
The following parameters were measured: while blood 
cell counts (WBC), neutrophil (NE), lymphocyte (LY), 
monocyte (MO) and eosinophil (EO) counts and 
percentage,  red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin 
(Hb), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume 
(MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration  (MCHC), red 
cell distribution width (RDW), platelet (PLT) counts 
and mean platelet volume (MPV). Plasma concentration 
of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1(CXCL1/KC) was 
measured using ELISA kit (R&D) according to 
manufacturer’s protocol. Plasma concentration of tri-
glycerides 
was 
measured 
using 
triglyceride 
quantification Kit (Abcam) according to manufacturer’s 
protocol. In both assays reactions were run in duplicates 
and concentrations were calculated from a calibration 
curve generated for each experiment. Glucose con-
centration was measured using AlphaTRAK 2 Blood 
Glucose Monitoring Kit (Abbott Laboratories). 
 
Creating physiological Frailty Index  
 
Frailty Index was created for each individual mouse as 
previously described [20] using 26 week-old group as a 
“young mouse” reference. For each parameter mean 
value and standard deviation were calculated. Animals 
differing in more than one standard deviation (STDEV) 
from mean value in any single parameter were excluded 
from the reference group. Value for each parameter 
measured for mice of older ages (52, 78 and 104 weeks) 
was compared with corresponding value for the 
reference group and assigned a score. Values that differ 
less than 1 STDEV were assigned the score of 0 (no 
deficit, within the range of the reference group). Values 
that were different for one STDEV were scored as 0.25 
(minimal deficit). Values that differ from the 
corresponding values in the reference group by 2 STDEV 
were scored as 0.5 and those that differ by 3 STDEV 
were scored as 0.75. If the value is above 3 STDEV it 
was scored as 1 (extreme deficit). The number of deficits 
the individual mouse is expressed was calculated as a 
ratio of total number of parameters measured and was 
referred to as Physiological Frailty Index (PFI).  
 
Histological evaluation 
 
After completion of the experiment mouse livers were 
fixed in 10% neutral formalin for 24 h. For 
morphological observations samples were transferred to 
70% ethanol and processed in an automated processor 
(Leica ASP 300) and embedded in paraffin using 
LEICA EG 1150H embedding unit according to 
manufacturer’s protocols. Five micron sections were 
obtained using rotary microtome (LEICA RM 2235) 
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Neutral 
lipids were revealed by Oil Red O staining according to 
standard protocol on 12 micron cryo-sections prepared 
from formalin-fixed material using CM1900 cryostat. 
Histopathological examination was performed using 
Zeiss AxioImager A1 with Axiocam MRc digital 
camera. 
 
Statistics 
 
Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier 
estimators and compared using the log-rank test. 
Continuous data are expressed as mean + SEM. 
Statistical analyses were performed using one or two-
way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests for multiple 
comparisons, ANOVA on ranks with Dunn’s tests or 
Student’s t-test where appropriate. P-values <0.05 were 
considered significant. To generate a trend line that 
would best describe age-dependent increase in FI, a 
cubic regression was fit regressing the PFI on chrono-
logical age (CA), CA2 and CA3.  A stepwise selection 
procedure was then used to eliminate unnecessary terms 
for any or all of the higher order polynomial terms. The 
models were fit individually by sex.
