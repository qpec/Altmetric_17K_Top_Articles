Overriding motor impulses instigated by salient perceptual
stimuli represent a fundamental inhibitory skill. Such motor
self-regulation facilitates more rational behaviour, as it brings
economy into the bodily interaction with the physical and
social world. It also underlies certain complex cognitive
processes including decision making. Recently, MacLean et al.
(MacLean et al. 2014 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 111, 2140–2148.
(doi:10.1073/pnas.1323533111)) conducted a large-scale study
involving 36 species, comparing motor self-regulation across
taxa. They concluded that absolute brain size predicts level
of performance. The great apes were most successful. Only a
few of the species tested were birds. Given birds’ small brain
size—in absolute terms—yet flexible behaviour, their motor
self-regulation calls for closer study. Corvids exhibit some
of the largest relative avian brain sizes—although small in
absolute measure—as well as the most flexible cognition in the
animal kingdom. We therefore tested ravens, New Caledonian
crows and jackdaws in the so-called cylinder task. We found
performance indistinguishable from that of great apes despite
the much smaller brains. We found both absolute and relative
brain volume to be a reliable predictor of performance within
Aves. The complex cognition of corvids is often likened to that
of great apes; our results show further that they share similar
fundamental cognitive mechanisms.

conditioned processes [1]. These functions require cognitive effort: not only do they inhibit prepotent
responses, but also they sometimes guide choice among several options. Some are cognitively more
taxing than others. Self-control—commonly defined as the ability to decline an immediate small reward
in favour of a larger future one—ranks among the most demanding. It requires deciding among options
of differing values in relation to a temporal dimension. At the other end of the taxation spectrum,
one finds, e.g. motor self-regulation, which requires only the hindering of a movement: one that is not
immediately rewarding but does not infer major cost [2].
Self-control is essential to such complex cognitive skills as decision-making and planning [3,4].
Without that competence, an animal becomes—in Roberts’ [5] words—stuck in time. Currently, those
groups of non-human animals that stand out for their levels of self-control are great apes, corvids and
parrots [6–8].
Because self-control is an underlying cognitive process enabling spatio-temporal detachment across
various contexts, its evolution and expression in different taxa inform a broader view on cognitive
evolution. Self-control is underpinned by—among other things—motor self-regulation. Without
well-developed regulation, self-control will not come about easily. Studying such basic inhibition
comparatively across closely and distantly related taxa has its merits. It helps establish whether there
is a link between levels of motor self-regulation and levels of self-control, and other cognitive skills.
MacLean and co-workers [9] compared motor self-regulatory tasks for 36 species, mostly primates.
The tasks were designed to make certain motor responses tempting to execute but counterproductive
to the goal. Although the authors refer to these tasks as tests of self-control, this does not conform
to definitions found in the literature, as the tasks did not involve decisions between two options, one
resulting in an immediate small reward and another in a larger but delayed one. We agree with Beran
[2] that what they actually tested was motor self-regulation, as the tasks required only the inhibition of
prepotent responses. Performance levels were investigated for correlation with absolute versus relative
brain size, dietary breadth and social complexity. Great apes showed the highest levels of inhibition.
Across all species, absolute brain size was the best predictor of success; brain size relative to body mass
had no significant effect. That said, relative brain size did predict performance among the primates,
though not as strongly as absolute size.
Of the 36 species tested, 29 were mammals out of which 23 were primates. Only seven were birds. The
authors cautioned that, as the findings were primate dominated, they might not generalize. We therefore
believe that testing more bird species would be helpful in at least two ways. Firstly, to establish whether
the relationship between absolute brain size and inhibition performance holds across taxa (i.e. whether
birds perform more poorly due to smaller absolute brain size) and, secondly, whether a similar pattern
emerges between brain size and motor self-regulation within Aves.
MacLean and co-workers [9] included two species from corvid genera—Eurasian jays (Garrulus
glandarius) and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma californica)—but no members of the genus Corvus. We
tested three species of crows belonging to the genus Corvus: ravens (Corvus corax), New Caledonian
crows (Corvus moneduloides) and jackdaws (Corvus monedula).
Including more corvids is informative for several reasons. Corvids have one of the largest relative
brain sizes among birds [10], while ravens have the largest absolute brain size among corvids: roughly
three times that of the jackdaw and twice that of the New Caledonian crow. Corvids have often been
likened to the great apes in terms of complex cognition involved in physical, social and memory skills [11]
as well as self-control tasks [7]. By comparing primate and corvid data, one can approach the question
whether the complex cognition seen in these phylogenetically distant taxa can be explained in part by
similar underlying proximate mechanisms, such as basic motor self-regulatory skills [12].
MacLean and co-workers used two tasks: the cylinder task and the A-not-B task. In the cylinder task,
subjects are familiarized with an opaque hollow cylinder with openings at both ends and a reward in
the middle. Once subjects learn to take the reward through the openings, a transparent cylinder replaces
the opaque one. A direct reach for the visible reward—as opposed to detouring to one of the openings—
counts as inhibition failure. The task was originally developed to study ontogeny of inhibition skills in
humans and rhesus monkeys [13] and later adopted for other animals [14].
Piaget designed the A-not-B task [15] to study infants’ developing concept of object permanence. It
was subsequently adapted to investigate a wide range of skills including means–end reasoning, short-
term memory use and inhibitory control [16,17]. Subjects get repeated experience retrieving a reward
placed under opaque container A. In test trials, the experimenter moves the reward from A to container
B in full view of the subject, and then lets it search for the reward. The choice of A instead of B marks an
error. Some regard this as an inhibition failure built on preceding habit: the habit of retrieving the reward
from A must be inhibited when the reward is moved to B.

We did not use the A-not-B task for two main reasons: it is not clearly a motor self-regulatory task,
and MacLean et al’s study had methodological shortcomings regarding its use. Solving the task is an
exceedingly dynamic process affected by such contextual features as the delay between hide and search,
the visual distinctiveness—as well as number—of containers, and the level of attention directed towards
the baited container [18,19]. Given this dynamic complexity, the A-not-B task has been widely questioned
as an inhibitory task [18]. In the same vein, Jelbert and colleagues recently showed that New Caledonian
crows who received training in tracking human hand actions were significantly better at solving the
A-not-B task than those who were not trained [20].
MacLean et al. also implemented the task unsatisfactorily. Firstly, they conducted only a single trial
per individual, compared to 10 trials per individual in the cylinder task. Inhibitory control is not a
binary skill but a continuum—as shown in the cylinder task. Secondly, they used three containers, of
which the middle container was never rewarded. As we understand it, every failure to retrieve the
reward—including searching the middle container—was regarded as inhibitory failure. The middle
location should not be regarded as an inhibition failure as no habit was formed in relation to it. Thirdly,
as many as nine of the species examined could not be tested in the A-not-B task. Only four of the seven
bird species received the A-not-B task. Overall the task does not provide much informative data.
We therefore replicated only the cylinder task conducted by MacLean and co-workers [9], comparing
the performance on it in the same species, with particular focus on the birds. It must be noted, however,
that MacLean and co-workers’ findings regarding the correlation between absolute and relative brain
size holds for this task alone. In our replication, we followed the experimental procedures described
in MacLean et al.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Subjects and housing
Five adult ravens (three females), 10 adult New Caledonian crows (four females) and 10 adult jackdaws
(five females) participated in the study. The ravens were tested at Lund University Corvid Cognition
Station in Sweden, the other birds at the Avian Cognition Research Station associated with the Max
Planck Institute for Ornithology, Seewiesen, Germany. All were housed in environmentally enriched
outdoor aviaries. The New Caledonian crows had access to heated indoor compartments (6 m2). The
ravens and jackdaws were housed as a social group in 400 m2 (ravens) and 120 m2 (jackdaws) spaces,
and the New Caledonian crows as pairs in 18–32 m2 spaces. All birds had ad libitum access to food and
water. Subjects were tested individually in familiar testing compartments.
2.2. Set-up and materials
The cylinder task employed two apparatuses: an opaque and a transparent hollow cylinder. The
cylinders were open on both sides and attached to a wooden base. The openings allowed the subjects
to insert their heads and retrieve a highly desirable food reward from the middle of the cylinder.
2.3. Procedure
First the birds were habituated to the opaque cylinder by having it placed inside the aviary. A bird was
defined as habituated when it interacted with the cylinder. All subjects except two jackdaws and one
raven habituated after 2 days. It took 3 days for two jackdaws and 6 days for one raven to habituate.
Familiarization trials ensued 1 day after the habituation. In these trials, the birds were familiarized with
the opaque cylinder and its particular shape. The experimenter hid the reward at the centre of the tube
while the subject observed; then the subject was allowed to retrieve the reward. Correct responses were
coded, for the first responses, as reaching through either opening to get the reward. Regardless of their
first response, subjects were eventually allowed to obtain the reward. To proceed to the test trials, subjects
had to succeed on four out of five consecutive trials. All birds completed the familiarization trials within
one session in 1 day and they did not have any incorrect responses. Testing trials followed 1 day after the
familiarization trials.
In the test trials, a transparent cylinder replaced the opaque cylinder. Ten trials were administered
for every subject. The baiting procedure was identical to that used in the familiarization trials. Correct
responses were coded, again for the first responses, when one of the openings was used to retrieve the
reward (detour through the side), and an incorrect response was coded if physical contact was made

eventually allowed to retrieve the reward regardless of the accuracy of their first responses.
3. Results
All ravens succeeded on all trials (100%). The jackdaws averaged 97% success (min = 8, max = 10), the
New Caledonian crows 92% (min = 7, max = 10). The results are comparable with those of the great apes:
chimpanzees (100%), orangutans (99.1%), bonobos (95%) and gorillas (94.4%) (table 1).
To perform detailed comparison, we obtained unpublished trial-level results on the seven bird species
from MacLean et al., along with endocranial brain volume and body mass data from the literature
concerning the three Corvus species [21–23] analysed together with the mass and volume data for the
other seven bird species reported in the replicated study (MacLean et al. supporting information table
S1). Two generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) were constructed to investigate the effect of
absolute and residual brain volume on performance, with the latter calculated as the residual from a
phylogenetic regression of absolute-brain-volume predicted body mass. For both models, trial number
was added as a fixed effect. Both absolute and residual brain volume as well as trial number were found
to be significant predictors of performance on the cylinder task (table 2). Comparison of the two models
using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) provided stronger support for the absolute brain volume
model (table 2). In addition, we investigated the effect of the trial number on performance separately
for all bird species tested. We found a trial effect on performance in four of the bird species examined
by MacLean et al., with no such effect in the Corvus species we examined. Performance improved
significantly over successive trials for the zebra finches (p = 0.037), song sparrows (p = 0.014), swamp
sparrows (p = 0.008) and orange amazons (p = 0.029; electronic supplementary material, table S1).

The Corvus species performed on a similar level to the great apes, despite vastly smaller absolute brain
sizes. A chimpanzee brain is roughly 26 times larger than a raven’s; nevertheless, both species achieve
100% success. The jackdaws were more successful than either the bonobos or gorillas, despite a brain
70–94 times smaller. Clearly, absolute brain size is no overall predictor of motor self-regulation across
a wider range of animal taxa. However, as among primates, absolute brain size does appear to be a
significant predictor across bird species (figure 1), but on the other hand relative brain size is as well a
significant predictor within birds.
Recent findings indicate the existence of different scaling relationships between total number of
neurons and absolute brain size across mammalian taxa [24]: bigger brains do not necessarily contain
more neurons than smaller ones. Neuronal numbers might perhaps better explain corvids’ and apes’
similar performance in the cylinder task than absolute or relative brain size, but such investigations have
to await studies on neuronal counts in bird brains. Furthermore, the crude comparisons made both in
our study and MacLean et al.’s may miss the importance of the relative or absolute sizes of certain brain
regions related to inhibitory skills. The lack of data on different brain regions across bird species meant
that we could not perform the requisite analysis.
Regardless of any comparisons of various brain measurements, one can conclude that the similarities
between corvids and great apes in complex cognitive skills [11] also hold for at least one less taxing skill:
motor self-regulation.
Some of the bird results from the cylinder task in MacLean et al.’s study are difficult to interpret.
For example, we found a significant positive trial effect for four of the bird species; see the electronic
supplementary material for details. This might indicate that the subjects representing these species
lacked sufficient initial experience of the task but gained experience across trials. The cylinder task is
not suitable if adequate experience is lacking: i.e. failures might result from other causes than limited
inhibition. It has also been shown in human children that previous experience with transparent objects
is crucial for this task [19]; therefore, one should not administer the cylinder task if it is not clearly
established that the subject has sufficient experience about transparent surfaces. Recently, it was shown
that Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) perform better in the last five, out of the 10, trials in the

cylinder task, even if they have passed the familiarization trials with an opaque cylinder; the authors
concluded that this was an effect of learning about transparent surfaces [25]. We do not know whether
similar trial effects hold for some of the mammalian species. Here it is worth mentioning that all our
birds have had previous experience of transparent surfaces, both from various enrichment activities and
experiments since they were young.
One might reasonably ask not only for reports on failures and successes, but also for information on
the behavioural dynamics of how the tasks were solved by different species. Not all of the few failures
reported from the Corvus species in our study were ‘clean’ failures such that the bird tried to reach the
reward directly as if the barrier was air. Instead, some birds nudged the cylinder, while others behaved
as if exploring the attachment of the cylinder. Without details of possible exploratory behaviour across
species, it might be premature to make the far-reaching conclusions about evolution and brain size that
MacLean et al. do [26]. What is without doubt is that great apes and Corvus corvids have pronounced
motor self-regulatory behaviour in relation to the cylinder task, despite very different absolute different
brain sizes.
Ethics. The study was conducted in accordance with national and EU legislation and guidelines for animal research.
The Swedish regional ethical board approved the raven testing. According to German law, no such similar approval
was necessary for the New Caledonian crows and the jackdaws, as the studies do not fall under the definitions of
animal research.
Data accessibility. The datasets supporting this article have been uploaded as part of the electronic supplementary
material.
