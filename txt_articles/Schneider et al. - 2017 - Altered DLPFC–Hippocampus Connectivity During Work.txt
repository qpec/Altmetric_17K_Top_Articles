Altered connectivity of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) and hippocampus during working memory is 
considered an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia 
(SCZ), but the relevance for other mental disorders with 
shared genetic background remains unknown. Here we 
investigated its presence in unaffected first-degree relatives 
of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive 
disorder (MDD). Furthermore, we aimed to provide an 
independent replication of this phenotype in first-degree 
relatives of SCZ patients. We acquired functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 309 healthy controls 
and 218 healthy first-degree relatives of index patients 
with SCZ (n = 62), BD (n = 66) and MDD (n = 90), who 
completed the n-back working memory paradigm. We 
observed a significant group effect on DLPFC–hippocam-
pus coupling (PFWE = .031, all P-values region of interest 
[ROI] corrected). Post hoc comparisons revealed that this 
effect was driven by the SCZ relatives, who showed a sig-
nificant increase in the negative functional connectivity of 
the DLPFC and right hippocampus compared to controls 
(PFWE = .001), BD relatives (PFWE = .015) and trend-wise 
also MDD relatives (PFWE = .082). Comparison of BD and 
MDD relatives to the controls revealed no difference (PFWE-
values > .451). Supplementary analyses suggested that the 
SCZ relatives finding is robust to a range of potential con-
founds, including structural differences. Our data further 
support altered DLPFC–hippocampus connectivity during 
working memory as an intermediate phenotype for SCZ. 
This suggests that this phenotype is relatively specific to 
SCZ and does not translate to other genetically related 
disorders in the mood-psychosis spectrum.

Introduction
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe brain disorder with a 
heritability of up to 80% and a complex genetic archi-
tecture.1,2 Etiological models of SCZ propose that clini-
cal symptoms emerge as a result of a complex interplay 
of genetic and environmental risk factors which impact 
neural trajectories and functional integration during 
development.3–6 A popular strategy for dissecting the 
complex pathophysiology of SCZ is to investigate genetic 
influences on “brain-based” imaging phenotypes, which 
should, in principle, be closer to the genetic mechanisms 
of a disorder than the clinical phenotype itself.6,7 In par-
ticular, considerable research efforts have focused on the 
neuroimaging investigation of working memory deficits, 
which are a heritable part of the disorder and linked to 
poorer long-term outcomes.8–10
A critical prerequisite for an imaging intermedi-
ate phenotype is that the link to the increased genetic 
risk for the illness is convincingly established. One line 
of evidence is the demonstration that the phenotype is 
present in an intermediate form in healthy first-degree 
relatives of patients.11,12 Within the domain of working

DLPFC–Hippocampus Coupling and Schizophrenia Risk
memory research, a particularly promising finding is that 
of altered functional connectivity of the dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (DLPFC) and the hippocampus in patients 
with SCZ. First demonstrated in 2001,13 this phenotype 
has been reported in prodromal, first-episode and chronic 
SCZ patients,13–15 their unaffected siblings,15 healthy carri-
ers of genome-wide supported psychosis risk variants,15–19 
and animal genetic models.20 More recent investigations 
using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) meth-
ods have provided evidence of a link of this genetic risk-
related phenotype to neural plasticity.21
Taken together, these data suggest that DLPFC–hip-
pocampus coupling is a phenotype suitable for the dis-
section of the genetic contributions to SCZ. In this work, 
we aimed to add to this evidence in 2 ways. First, we per-
formed an independent replication of a link to SCZ famil-
ial risk, which is crucial in supporting the establishment 
of any intermediate phenotype. To this end, we aimed to 
replicate the presence of abnormalities in DLPFC–hippo-
campus connectivity in unaffected first-degree relatives of 
SCZ patients, as previously reported.15 Since the reliable 
measurement of quantitative trait markers is of crucial 
importance in imaging genetics,22 we closely followed the 
methodological approach of this group but restricted our 
analysis to a “seeded connectivity” approach, which showed 
superior reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 
(2,1): 0.50) as compared to psychophysiological interaction 
analysis (ICC (2,1): 0.05) based on earlier work.21
Furthermore, despite increasing evidence for shared 
genetic variance between SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD),23 
and to a lesser degree with major depressive disorder 
(MDD),24 the question to which degree altered DLPFC–
hippocampus coupling is specific to the diagnosis of SCZ 
has yet to be addressed. On the one hand, shared genetic 
variance could support a presence of this intermediate 
phenotype across diagnostic boundaries and would argue 
for a relationship of clinical features shared between these 
disorders, such as psychosis.25 If, on the other hand, the 
phenotype is present only in relatives of patients with SCZ, 
this could indicate a relationship, on the level of genetics, 
to a unique portion of the genetic variance, and on the 
level of behavior to symptoms that are not as prominent 
in BD and MDD, such as cognitive symptoms. This would 
stimulate further transdiagnostic inquiries and inform con-
ceptual considerations. Therefore, we tested the question 
of disorder specificity by extending our analysis in SCZ 
relatives to the assessment of unaffected first-degree rela-
tives of patients with BD and MDD.
Methods and Materials
Subjects
We studied 527 subjects comprising 309 healthy volun-
teers and 218 unaffected first-degree relatives (ie, parents, 
siblings and children) of index patients with SCZ (n = 62), 
BD (n = 66) and MDD (n = 90). All subjects were between 
18 and 63 years of age, of European ancestry and were 
recruited from the cities of Mannheim, Berlin and Bonn 
(see table 1 for demographic details). None of the healthy 
volunteers had a first-degree relative with a history of men-
tal illness. For the relatives groups, a trained psychiatrist 
or psychologist established ICD-10 and DSM-IV diagno-
ses of the index patients. None of the subjects fulfilled any 
exclusion criteria such as a lifetime history of significant 
general medical, psychiatric, or neurological illness, cur-
rent or past psychotropic pharmacological treatment, or 
head trauma. Clinical assessments included the Symptom 
Checklist-90 (SCL-90)26 and the schizotypal personal-
ity questionnaire (SPQ).27 Intelligence was assessed with 
the German multiple-choice vocabulary intelligence test 
(Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatz-Test-B 
[MWTB]).28 
Trail 
Making Tests (TMT-A, TMT-B) were used for the assess-
ment of processing speed and executive functioning.29,30 
All participants provided written informed consent for a 
protocol approved by the local ethics committees of the 
Universities of Heidelberg, Bonn and Berlin.
Working Memory Task, Imaging Data Acquisition and 
Preprocessing
We studied brain function during working memory using 
the well-established n-back functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) paradigm15,16,22,31 (supplementary materi-
als). Whole-brain fMRI was performed on three 3T MR 
systems (Siemens Trio) using identical scanner protocols 
(supplementary materials). Functional data were acquired 
using echo planar imaging sequences with the follow-
ing specifications: 28 axial slices, 4 mm slice thickness, 1 
mm gap, repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 2000/30 
ms, 80° flip angle, 192 × 192 mm field of view (FOV), 64 
× 64 matrix. Images were preprocessed following previ-
ously published procedures15,16 using standard process-
ing routines in SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). 
Briefly, all images were realigned to the first image, slice-
time corrected and spatially normalized into a standard 
stereotactic space (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] 
template) with volume units (voxels) of 3 × 3 × 3 mm, 
and smoothed with a 9 mm full width at half maximum 
(FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Quality control analyses sug-
gested stable scanner performance and no systematic dif-
ferences of image quality between groups (supplementary 
materials). Head motion parameters were quantified as 
previously detailed,32,33 including frame-wise displace-
ment according to Power et al.34 Furthermore, we acquired 
structural data, which were analyzed using voxel-based 
morphometry (supplementary materials).
First-Level Modeling of DLPFC Functional 
Connectivity
We extracted the first eigenvariate of the seed time series 
from 6 mm spheres centered on the individual activa-
tion maximum in the “2-back > 0-back” contrast in the

right DLPFC. A predefined anatomical mask (BA 46 and 
lateral BA 9) from the Wake Forest University (WFU) 
PickAtlas (www.fmri.wfubmc.edu/downloads) served as 
a spatial constraint. Individual first-level models were 
defined with the subject-specific DLPFC time series as 
regressors of interest, and the following regressors of 
no interest: (1) movement parameters from the realign-
ment step, (2) first eigenvariates derived from cerebral 
spinal fluid and white matter masks,16,19 and (3) regres-
sors encoding for the experimental conditions. The model 
estimation step included a high pass filter of 128 seconds 
and an adjustment for the global brain signal.
Association of DLPFC–Hippocampus Connectivity 
With Familial Risk for Psychiatric Disorders
Group differences in the calculated seeded DLPFC func-
tional connectivity maps were examined using random-
effects group statistics at the second level. Since we aimed 
at the independent and regionally specific replication of 
the previously reported link between DLPFC–hippocam-
pus connectivity and SCZ genetic risk,15 we defined an a 
priori hypothesized region of interest (ROI) within the 
anterior hippocampus based on the significant regional 
finding reported in Rasetti et al.15 To this end, we defined

DLPFC–Hippocampus Coupling and Schizophrenia Risk
a 15 mm sphere at the peak voxel coordinate of the Rasetti 
et al intermediate phenotype finding (x = 15, y = −6, 
z = −15), and intersected this region with an anatomical 
mask of the hippocampus derived from the Automated 
Anatomical Labeling Atlas,35 resulting in an ROI compris-
ing 49 voxels. We evaluated both research questions, ie, the 
replication of the link to SCZ genetic risk and the diag-
nostic specificity of the previously reported finding within 
this ROI using small volume correction at PFWE < .05 fam-
ily-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons.
Statistical analysis was performed using an Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) model with group as between-
subject factor, and age, sex, and site as nuisance covari-
ates. In a first step, we assessed the main effect of group 
(F test: controls vs SCZ relatives vs BD relatives vs MDD 
relatives). Given that this analysis uncovered a significant 
group effect (reported below), we further performed spe-
cific post hoc tests to (1) replicate the finding of stronger 
negative connectivity (ie, anti-correlation of time-courses 
between hippocampus and DLPFC) in SCZ relatives 
compared to the controls (t test: controls > SCZ rela-
tives), and to (2) assess the specificity of this finding rela-
tive to the other diagnostic groups (t test: controls > BD 
relatives, controls > MDD relatives, BD relatives > SCZ 
relatives, MDD relatives > SCZ relatives).
Confirmatory Analyses
Since we observed significant differences in DLPFC–
hippocampus coupling between controls and SCZ rela-
tives (see results section), we further wanted to rule out 
the possibility that this finding related to differences in

the demographics, task performance or head movement 
between groups. To this end, we performed additional, 
confirmatory SPM analyses in which we compared 
the 62 SCZ first-degree relatives with a subset of 186 
healthy controls that were matched based on age, sex, 
task performance, and movement (table 2), using the 
“optimal” matching algorithm from the MatchIt pack-
age (version 2.4, https://cran.r-project.org/web/pack-
ages/MatchIt/MatchIt.pdf) in R (version 3.1.3). The 
“optimal” matching algorithm requires a case-control 
ratio as an input variable and only accepts integers. 
We decided to match 3 controls for every SCZ relative 
because this gave us the most controls while also pro-
viding sufficient degrees of freedom to match all of the 
above-described covariates. The confirmatory analysis 
was calculated as ANCOVA, with group as between-
subject factor and age, sex, and site as nuisance covari-
ates. In a second confirmatory analysis, we aimed at 
assessing whether our result related to differences in 
neuropsychological variables that could not be matched 
between groups (table 2). We thus estimated another 
second-level SPM model that also controlled for these 
variables in addition to the standard age, sex and site 
covariates (complete data were available for 61 SCZ rel-
atives and 183 healthy controls). For both confirmatory 
analyses, results were evaluated within the hippocam-
pus ROI using small volume correction and were con-
sidered significant at a FWE corrected P value < .05.
For consistency reasons and in order to substanti-
ate the null findings for BD and MDD relatives (see 
Results section), we performed the same confirmatory 
analyses for BD and MDD relatives (supplementary 
materials).
Results
Comparison of Sample Characteristics
With respect to demographic variables, age (P < .001) and 
kinship status (P < .001) were significantly different between 
groups (tables 1 and 2). Regarding (neuro)psychological 
variables, we observed group differences for intelligence as 
measured by the MWTB as well as the somatization and 
phobic anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist ques-
tionnaire. Post hoc t tests revealed that SCZ relatives showed 
significantly higher somatization (P = .012) than controls 
and BD relatives performed significantly better on the 
MWTB intelligence test compared to controls (P = .014). 
Lastly, MDD relatives exhibited a lower level of phobic 
anxiety than controls (P < .001). With respect to measure-
ment-related variables, SCZ relatives showed higher trans-
lational movement during the scan (P = .018). With respect 
to regional hippocampal volume, we detected no signifi-
cant differences between study groups at the replication site 
of the functional connectivity intermediate phenotype (all 
 
P values > .13, tables 1 and 2). However, DLPFC vol-
ume was significantly different between groups (P = .018), 
with BD relatives showing higher values (table 1). For the 
samples of the first confirmatory analysis in SCZ relatives 
(n = 62) and the algorithmically matched healthy controls 
(n = 186), significantly higher scores for the SCZ relatives 
were detected for the SCL somatization (P = .015), anxi-
ety (P = .024) and psychoticism (P = .009) subscales. The

relatives group also performed worse on the TMT-B test 
(P = .021).
Alterations in DLPFC Seeded Functional Connectivity 
in First-Degree Relatives
The ANCOVA model revealed a significant main effect 
of group within the a priori defined hippocampus ROI 
(x = 21, y = −13, z = −12; Z = 3.02, PFWE = .031, ROI cor-
rected). The follow-up t-tests suggested that this effect was 
driven by the SCZ relatives group (figure 1A). Specifically, 
replicating the initial report of the Weinberger group,15 
we detected a significantly stronger negative functional 
connectivity of the DLPFC with the right hippocampus 
ROI in SCZ relatives compared to the controls (controls 
> SCZ: x = 21, y = −13, z = −12; Z = 3.89, PFWE = .001, 
ROI corrected, figures 1A and B). Notably, no similar 
effect was observed when the other 2 relatives groups 
were compared to the control group (controls > BD, con-
trols > MDD; all Z values < 1.51, all PFWE-values > .452, 
ROI corrected). In addition, we detected a significant dif-
ference between the SCZ and BD relatives (BD > SCZ: 
x = 18, y = −13, z = −15; Z = 3.19, PFWE = .015, ROI cor-
rected) and a similar trend-level difference between the 
SCZ and MDD relatives (MDD > SCZ: x = 24, y = −10, 
z = −15; Z = 2.55, PFWE = .082, ROI corrected). Finally, 
we observed no significant differences between BD and 
MDD relatives (BD > MDD: x = 18, y = −13, z = −18; 
Z = 1.24, PFWE = .561, ROI corrected). Supplementary 
analyses suggest that the main effect of group was unlikely 
influenced by potential confounds, such as kinship status 
(ie, parent vs sibling vs child), DLPFC and hippocam-
pus volume, DLPFC activation, task performance, intel-
ligence, and subject motion (supplementary materials). 
These observations indicate that the previously reported 
connectivity abnormality in SCZ first-degree relatives is 
indeed replicable and relatively specific to the genetic risk 
for SCZ.
Confirmatory Analyses
Our confirmatory analyses of the algorithmically matched 
SCZ and control samples (table 2) revealed an even stron-
ger difference between the SCZ relatives and controls 
in the functional connectivity between the DLPFC and 
the right hippocampus ROI (x = 21, y = −13, z = −12; 
Z = 4.37, PFWE < .001, ROI corrected). Moreover, in the 
second confirmatory analysis, we additionally controlled 
for all psychological variables for which group differences 
were observed (ie, TMT-B, SCL subscales for somatiza-
tion, anxiety and psychoticism). The observed connec-
tivity difference remained stable in this analysis as well 
(x = 21, y = −13, z = −12; Z = 4.09; PFWE = .001, ROI 
corrected). These observations confirm the outcome of 
our initial analysis and argue against a confounding influ-
ence of these variables on the detected group difference.
Results of the analogously performed analyses in the 
other 2 relatives groups similarly confirmed the findings 
obtained by the full sample, ie, no difference in functional 
DLPFC–hippocampus coupling between BD or MDD 
relatives and the algorithmically matched controls (sup-
plementary materials).
Discussion
The first objective of this study was to replicate the 
association of altered DLPFC–hippocampus connec-
tivity in healthy first-degree relatives of SCZ patients. 
Demonstration of an association in healthy first-degree 
relatives is a core principle of the intermediate phenotype 
concept, since the relatives carry an enriched set of SCZ 
susceptibility variants36 but lack many of the confound-
ing factors that complicate the interpretation of patient 
data (eg, medication). The influence of these risk variants 
may emerge at the level of “intermediate” neural circuits 
that result in altered brain function without overt symp-
toms observed in affected individuals. In the second part 
of the study, we further explored a hitherto unaddressed 
question for this phenotype, namely whether altered 
DLPFC–hippocampus coupling is specific to the genetic 
predisposition to SCZ or, alternatively, is indicative of 
vulnerability to a broader spectrum of genetic disorders 
in the mood-psychosis spectrum.
In the first part of this study, we report significant alter-
ations in the functional connectivity of the DLPFC with 
the right hippocampus in unaffected first-degree relatives 
of SCZ patients. This observation provides an indepen-
dent replication of Rasetti et al15 and supports the con-
tention that this phenotype is indeed related to genetic 
risk for the disorder. Our finding is supported by a con-
firmatory analysis in an algorithmically matched group 
of 62 first-degree relatives and 186 healthy controls con-
trolling for influence of other between-group differences 
(eg, in site or task performance) in this analysis.34,37 The 
balanced study groups in this analysis, which accounted 
for several motion parameters, including the sum of rota-
tional and translational movement and frame-wise dis-
placement,34 yielded even stronger statistical results than 
our initial analysis with unmatched groups, suggesting 
that our findings in SCZ relatives is unlikely explained 
by subject motion. In addition, we could show that the 
effect was not influenced by grey matter volume in the 
hippocampus or DLPFC, suggesting that the detected 
functional group differences are unlikely due to differ-
ences in local brain structure. Moreover, our result was 
also robust to correlation with DLPFC activation, sev-
eral psychopathological variables and measurable deficits 
in executive functioning as defined by the TMT-B.
Taken together, these observations support the idea 
that alterations in DLPFC–hippocampus connectivity 
indeed reflect a physiological network deficit and are not 
an epiphenomenon of differences in overt task behavior,

measurable neuropsychological differences or pre-existing 
structural alterations. Finally, the localization and direc-
tionality of our finding is highly consistent with that of 
the healthy siblings of SCZ patients in a prior study using 
the same fMRI task and analogous data processing rou-
tines.15 Our findings thus provide an independent replica-
tion of this prior work, thereby corroborating the notion 
that altered DLPFC–hippocampus seeded connectivity 
reflects a functionally relevant aspect of SCZ familial risk, 
and further highlight the value of this imaging phenotype 
for the dissection of the genetic basis of the disorder.
In the second, transdiagnostic part of our study we 
showed that the phenotype of altered DLPFC–hippocam-
pus coupling in SCZ relatives is not detectible in healthy 
first-degree relatives of patients with BD or MDD. This 
observation suggests that altered DLPFC–hippocam-
pus connectivity is relatively specific to the genetic risk 
for SCZ and less related to the part of the genetic risk 
variance that is shared with the other 2 diagnostic condi-
tions of the mood-psychosis spectrum. The lack of phe-
notype association with BD familial risk, in particular, 
is somewhat surprising given the reported association of 
this phenotype with common genetic variants that con-
fer risk to both SCZ and BD,16–19 the high shared genetic 
variance between these disorders,23 and the evidence for a 
mutual phenotype in an episodic memory task.25 On the 
clinical level, this observation argues against the notion 
that altered DLPFC–hippocampus connectivity is more 
generally related to the risk for psychosis, the most promi-
nent shared symptom between BD and SCZ. Rather, 
cognitive domains prominent in SCZ but not in BD and 
MDD should be studied. In this context recent evidence 
suggests an association of altered DLPFC–hippocampus 
coupling with the genome-wide supported risk variant for 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the bridging integrator 1 gene 
(BIN1).38 While speculative, this might suggest that the 
phenotype rather relates to persistent cognitive impair-
ment, a core feature of both SCZ and AD but not BD and 
MDD. Further transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype 
research is needed to substantiate or refute this hypothesis.
Several limitations of our study merit discussion. 
Firstly, functional connectivity is correlative and thus 
should not be interpreted to show group differences in 
the causal interaction of regions, or actual anatomical 
connections. Secondly, while we went to great length to 
ensure our samples were balanced for a range of demo-
graphic, psychological, task and data quality-related 
confounds, given the large number of variables consid-
ered, not all variables could be properly matched between 
groups (ie, SCL subscale “phobic anxiety”). However, 
our confirmatory analyses revealed no direct association 
between these variables and our outcome measure. More 
importantly, we cannot fully exclude that our results were 
influenced by variables that we did not account for in our 
sample matching or modeling procedures. Specifically, 
although prior genetic studies15,16 suggest that this 
phenotype indeed reflects a trait phenomenon linked to 
the genetic (rather than familial) risk for SCZ, we cannot 
fully rule out that our connectivity finding in SCZ rela-
tives was influenced by the effects of a shared environ-
ment. Moreover, the slightly lower heritability for BD39–41 
and the considerably lower heritability for MDD41–43 
compared to SCZ23,40,41 could have led to a reduction in 
statistical power, which might in turn have contributed 
to the observed null finding in BD and MDD relatives. 
Finally, although the relatives groups were comparable in 
age, they might not be comparable in terms of genetic 
risk or resilience. More precisely, since the age at onset for 
SCZ and BD is earlier than for MDD,44,45 the findings in 
our SCZ and BD relatives (mean age > 30 y) might reflect 
effects of resilience to a higher degree than in MDD rela-
tives (mean age < 30 y). Conversely, effects of genetic risk 
might be more prounced in the MDD relatives group.
In conclusion, we replicate prior data15 in an inde-
pendent sample by showing that DLPFC–hippocampus 
functional connectivity during working memory is com-
promised in healthy first-degree relatives of SCZ patients. 
This observation further corroborates the notion that 
altered DLPFC–hippocampus coupling is indeed an 
intermediate connectivity phenotype signaling a specific 
neural system mechanism of the neurogenetic risk archi-
tecture of SCZ. We further extend prior knowledge by 
showing that this phenotype appears to be rather specific 
to SCZ genetic risk, and does not appear to reflect a trait 
phenomenon linked to the genetic risk for psychosis in 
general but to persistent cognitive impairment.
