IMPORTANCE Although high body mass index (BMI) is associated with adverse
birth outcomes, the association with severe maternal morbidity is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between prepregnancy BMI and severe
maternal morbidity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective population-based cohort study including
all singleton hospital births in Washington State, 2004-2013. Demographic data and
morbidity diagnoses were obtained from linked birth certificates and hospitalization files.
EXPOSURES Prepregnancy BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)
categories included underweight (<18.5), normal BMI (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9),
obesity class 1 (30.0-34.9), obesity class 2 (35.0-39.9), and obesity class 3 (�40).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Composite severe maternal morbidity or mortality included
life-threatening conditions and conditions leading to serious sequelae (eg, amniotic fluid
embolism, hysterectomy), complications requiring intensive care unit admission,
and maternal death. Logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and
adjusted rate differences with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for confounders
(eg, maternal age and parity).
RESULTS Overall, 743 630 women were included in the study (mean age, 28.1 [SD, 6.0] years;
41.4% nulliparous). Prepregnancy BMI was distributed as follows: underweight, 3.2%; normal
weight, 47.5%; overweight, 25.8%; obesity class 1, 13.1%; obesity class 2, 6.2%; and obesity
class 3, 4.2%. Rates of severe maternal morbidity or mortality were 171.5, 143.2, 160.4, 167.9,
178.3 and 202.9 per 10 000 women, respectively. Adjusted ORs were 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.3)
for underweight women; 1.1 (95% CI, 1.1-1.2) for overweight women; 1.1 (95% CI, 1.1-1.2) for
women with class 1 obesity; 1.2 (95% CI, 1.1-1.3) for women with class 2 obesity;
and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.3-1.5) for women with class 3 obesity compared with women with normal
BMI. Absolute risk increases (adjusted rate differences per 10 000 women, compared
with women with normal BMI) were 28.8 (95% CI, 12.2-47.2) for underweight women, 17.6
(95% CI, 10.5-25.1) for overweight women, 24.9 (95% CI, 15.7-34.6) for women with class 1
obesity, 35.8 (95% CI, 23.1-49.5) for women with class 2 obesity, and 61.1 (95% CI, 44.8-78.9)
for women with class 3 obesity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among pregnant women in Washington State, low and high
prepregnancy BMI, compared with normal BMI, were associated with a statistically significant
but small absolute increase in severe maternal morbidity or mortality.

increased from 15.8% in 1960 to 40.4% in 2014.1,2 In
2014, half of pregnant women were either overweight
(25.6%) or obese (24.8%).3 Overweight and obesity are asso-
ciated with elevated risks of preterm birth, large-for-
gestational-agelivebirth,macrosomia,shoulderdystocia,con-
genital anomalies, birth injury, stillbirth, cerebral palsy, and
neonatal and infant death,4-11 while underweight is associ-
ated with preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and
neonatal intensive care unit admission.11 Less is known about
the association between body mass index (BMI) and poten-
tially life-threatening maternal morbidity. Some studies have
shown an association between obesity and pregnancy com-
plicationsincludinghypertensioninpregnancyandpreeclamp-
sia, gestational diabetes, thromboembolism, and cesarean
delivery,4,11-15 although 1 study suggested that the overall risk
of severe maternal morbidity does not increase with BMI.11
The objective of this study was to examine the associa-
tion between prepregnancy BMI and severe maternal morbid-
ity or mortality.
Methods
All analyses in this study were performed using publicly ac-
cessible deidentified data. An exemption from ethics ap-
proval was granted by the Department of Social and Health
Services, State of Washington.
Data Sources
Information on all singleton hospital births at 20 to 45 weeks’
gestation in Washington State between January 1, 2004, and
December 31, 2013, was obtained from 2 linked data sources:
the live birth and fetal death certificates database and the
hospitalization database (Comprehensive Hospital Abstract
Reporting System [CHARS]). Information obtained from the
birth and fetal death certificates was abstracted by trained
abstractors using standardized forms (Supplement 1) and
included infants’sex and maternal characteristics such as
prepregnancy BMI, age, race, education, marital status, par-
ity, smoking during pregnancy, assisted conception, and year
of childbirth. Information on gestational age at delivery,
obstetric history (previous infant death, preterm birth, or
small-for-gestational-age birth in parous women), labor char-
acteristics (eg, prolonged labor), mode of delivery, gestational
hypertension, gestational diabetes, and congenital anomalies
was also obtained from birth certificates. CHARS data
included up to 9 diagnostic and 9 procedure codes (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi-
fication [ICD-9-CM]) related to maternal hospitalization,
information on death during hospitalization, the type of
health insurance coverage, and intensive care unit admis-
sion. Prepregnancy hypertension and prepregnancy diabetes
mellitus were identified from both data sources; the condi-
tion was deemed present if indicated in at least 1 data set (see
eTable 1 in Supplement 2 for details).
Completeness and accuracy of birth certificate and CHARS
datawasmonitoredbyWashingtonStateDepartmentofHealth
through annual assessments and consistency checks.16-18
Records flagged with inconsistent or out-of-range entries were
addressed systematically through hospital review and correc-
tion. The frequency of diagnostic and procedure codes was
monitored in annual reports.18 Previous validation studies of
the linked data set19,20 showed that for the majority of labor
and delivery information, the positive and negative predic-
tive values were greater than 80% and 98%, respectively, in
birth certificates and in CHARS, compared with a gold stan-
dard of manually abstracted and reabstracted data from medi-
cal charts.20 Although some preexisting medical conditions
had excellent reporting in birth certificates (eg, prepreg-
nancy diabetes mellitus), a combination of both data sources
was found to improve underreporting for most chronic dis-
eases (eg, chronic hypertension).19
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared, using the mother’
s self-reported
height and prepregnancy weight (US standard certificate of
birth, 2003 revision). BMI data were checked for consistency,
and maternal BMI values outside the expected range were
flagged as potentially erroneous and rectified.3,16 Maternal
prepregnancy BMI was classified in the following categories:
normalBMI(18.5-24.9),underweight(<18.5),overweight(25.0-
29.9), and obesity class 1 (30.0-34.9), class 2 (35.0-39.9), and
class 3 (≥40). Gestational age at delivery was based on ultra-
sound dating; date of last menstrual period was used for
women with missing ultrasound data. Multiple births were ex-
cluded, because members within a twin or triplet set could not
be identified in the data source.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of severe maternal morbidity or mor-
tality was defined as a composite outcome that included life-
threatening conditions, conditions leading to serious se-
quelae, complications requiring intensive care unit admission,
and maternal death during the hospitalization for childbirth.
Life-threatening conditions and conditions leading to serious
sequelae were identified using a list of such conditions previ-
ously developed by the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance
System.21 This included maternal conditions associated with
a high case-fatality rate (eg, amniotic fluid embolism), those
Key Points
Question Is prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) associated with
severe maternal morbidity?
Findings In this cohort study that included 743 630 pregnant
women in Washington State between 2004 and 2013, low and
high prepregnancy BMI, compared with normal BMI, were
significantly associated with increased risk of a composite adverse
outcome of severe maternal morbidity or mortality that included
maternal death and conditions leading to serious sequelae
(eg, adjusted absolute risk increase of 28.8 per 10 000 for
underweight and 61.1 per 10 000 for class 3 obese women).
Meaning Low and high prepregnancy BMI were associated with
a statistically significant but small increase in the risk of severe
maternal morbidity or mortality.

 involving organ failure (eg, acute renal failure) or leading to
adverse sequelae (eg, intracranial hemorrhage), and those re-
quiring high resource use (eg, peripartum hysterectomy)
(Table 1; eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
ICD-9-CM codes for potentially lifesaving interventions
that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recog-
nize as indicative of severe maternal morbidity (eg, invasive
hemodynamic monitoring) were also included.22 All se-
vere morbidity was grouped into the following categories:
(1) antepartum hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion,
eg, placenta previa, placental abruption; (2) respiratory
morbidity, eg, obstetric pulmonary embolism, respiratory
arrest; (3) thromboembolism, eg, deep venous thrombosis;
(4) cerebrovascular morbidity, eg, cerebral venous thrombo-
embolism; (5) cardiac morbidity, eg, acute myocardial
infarction; (6) eclampsia; (7) severe postpartum hemorrhage
requiring transfusion; (8) sepsis, eg, major puerperal in-
fection; (9) acute renal failure; (10) obstetric shock; (11) dis-
seminated intravascular coagulation; (12) uterine rupture;
(13) complications of anesthesia and obstetric intervention,
eg, shock due to anesthesia; (14) severe morbidity requir-
ing potentially lifesaving intervention, eg, transfusion,
mechanical ventilation, invasive hemodynamic monitoring;
and 15) other, eg, acute liver failure (Table 1; eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). These categories defined specific severe mor-
bid conditions and were not mutually exclusive.
Statistical Analyses
Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios
(ORs)and95%CIsexpressingtheassociationbetweenBMIand
severe maternal morbidity or mortality. Associations be-
tween BMI and severe maternal morbidity or mortality were
adjusted for demographic and prepregnancy characteristics,
includingmaternaleducation(highschoolgraduationorhigher
vs less than high school graduation), marital status (single,
widowed, or separated vs married or common law), race/
ethnicity (Hispanic, African American, Native American, and
other vs non-Hispanic white), parity (nulliparous, parity ≥4 vs
parity 1-3), assisted conception (no vs yes), smoking during
pregnancy (no vs yes), type of health insurance (Medicaid, pri-
vate vs other), year of birth, and fetal sex (female vs male).
Race/ethnicity was included as a potential confounder in
regression analyses because race/ethnicity is associated with
both BMI and adverse pregnancy outcomes3,23 and is not in the
causal pathway between BMI and these outcomes. Race/
ethnicity was recorded in the birth certificate as mother’
s self-
identified race/ethnicity with the categories non-Hispanic
white, black or African American, Native American or Alaska

 Native, and other categories (eg, Asian Indian, Chinese, Fili-
pino, Japanese, also including “other” as an open-ended cat-
egory). Hispanic origin was also self-reported and recorded as
a separate category (Supplement 1).24
Except for BMI, the proportion of missing values for all
covariates in the primary analyses did not exceed 3% (eTable
1 in Supplement 2). Complete-case regression analyses were
performed. Estimated associations between BMI and severe
maternal morbidity or mortality were also expressed in terms
of absolute increases in rates using adjusted rate differences
and 95% CIs.
Sensitivity Analyses
In the first sensitivity analysis, regression models were used to
adjust for underlying chronic hypertension and prepregnancy
diabetes mellitus in addition to other factors. These 2 condi-
tions were not included in the primary analyses because they
represent potential mediators in the causal pathway between
BMI and severe maternal morbidity. However, the data source
did not contain sufficient detail to ascertain the temporal di-
rectionality between these chronic conditions and BMI.
Mode of delivery was not included as a potential con-
founder because cesarean delivery is in the causal pathway be-
tween high BMI and severe morbidity and because in some
clinical situations cesarean delivery is a sequela of the out-
come, eg, severe antepartum hemorrhage is a severe mater-
nal morbidity and an indication for cesarean delivery.25-27
In the second sensitivity analysis, the problem of missing
values for prepregnancy BMI (approximately 9% of eligible
women) was addressed with multiple imputation (proc MI)
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, whereby prepreg-
nancy demographic and clinical factors were used to impute
missing BMI values.
In another sensitivity analysis, lower- and higher-than-
recommended weight gain during pregnancy were added
as covariates to the regression analyses because weight gain
is a potentially modifiable risk factor. Weight gain was calcu-
lated by subtracting prepregnancy weight (self-reported)
from the weight at delivery (measured by a clinician and re-
corded in birth or fetal death certificates). BMI category–
specific weight gain during pregnancy as recommended by the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists28 was
used to identify women outside the optimal range (12.7 to
18.1 kg for underweight women, 11.3 to 15.9 kg for normal-
weight women, 6.8 to 11.3 kg for overweight women, and 5.0
to 9.1 kg for obese women).28
Another sensitivity analysis examined opioid drug depen-
denceasapotentialconfounderoftheassociationbetweenBMI
and severe maternal morbidity or mortality.
All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
Study Population
There were 952 212 live births and stillbirths in Washington
State between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013.
Births that occurred out of state, multiple births, births be-
fore 20 weeks’ gestation, and births to women younger
than 15 years or older than 60 years were excluded (35 598
mothers [3.7%]), as were births that occurred out of hospital
(24 716 mothers [2.6%]) and births that could not be matched
with hospital records (64 609 mothers [6.8%]). Women with
missing information on BMI (83 659 mothers [8.8%]) were ex-
cluded from the primary analyses. The study population
included 743 630 women.
Overall, 49.3% of women were overweight or obese (25.8%
were overweight, 13.1% obese class 1, 6.2% obese class 2, and
4.2% obese class 3), while 47.5% were of normal BMI and 3.2%
were underweight. Underweight women and those with nor-
mal BMI were younger and included a higher proportion of
women of Hispanic and other race/ethnicity and a higher pro-
portionofnulliparouswomen.Obeseandunderweightwomen
had a higher rate of smoking during pregnancy, and obese
women had higher rates of preexisting diabetes and chronic
hypertension (Table 2). Obese women also had higher rates of
cesarean delivery, labor induction, previous cesarean deliv-
ery, prior infant death, preterm birth or small-for-gestational-
age birth, hypertension in pregnancy, and gestational diabe-
tes (Table 3). Women with class III obesity had higher rates of
breech presentation and lower rates of chorioamnionitis and
precipitous labor than women with normal BMI.
Therateofseverematernalmorbidityormortalitywaslow-
est in women with normal BMI (143.2 per 10 000 women) and
highest among women with class 3 obesity (202.9 per 10 000)
(Table 4). Crude odds ratios and rate differences are reported
in eTable 3 in Supplement 2.
Multivariable Analyses
Adjusted odds ratios showed that severe maternal morbidity
or mortality rates were significantly higher among under-
weight, overweight, and obese women compared with
women who had normal BMI (adjusted OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-
1.3] for underweight women; 1.1 [95% CI, 1.1-1.2] for over-
weight women; 1.1 [95% CI, 1.1-1.2] for women with class 1
obesity; 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3] for women with class 2 obesity;
and 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5] for women with class 3 obesity
(Table 5).
Absolute increases in rates of severe maternal morbidity
or mortality were small, with adjusted rate differences
of 28.8 (95% CI, 12.2-47.2) per 10 000 for underweight
women; 17.6 (95% CI, 10.5-25.1) per 10 000 for overweight
women; 24.9 (95% CI, 15.7-34.6) per 10 000 for women with
class 1 obesity; 35.8 (95% CI, 23.1-49.5) per 10 000 for women
with class 2 obesity; and 61.1 (95% CI, 44.8-78.9) per 10 000
for women with class 3 obesity (Table 5).
Compared with women with normal BMI, underweight
women had significantly higher rates of antepartum hemor-
rhage and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive
potentially lifesaving interventions, while overweight
women had higher rates of acute renal failure (Table 5).
Women with class 1 obesity had statistically significantly
higher rates of thromboembolism, cerebrovascular morbid-
ity, sepsis, acute renal failure, and complications of obstet-
ric interventions, while women with class 2 obesity had

 significantly higher rates of respiratory morbidity, eclamp-
sia, sepsis, acute renal failure, and complications of obstet-
ric interventions (Table 5). Women with class 3 obesity had
higher rates of respiratory morbidity (including pulmonary
embolism [Table 1]), thromboembolism, cerebrovascular
morbidity, cardiac morbidity, eclampsia, sepsis, acute renal
failure, complications of obstetric interventions, and ICU
admission (Table 5). On the other hand, women with class 3
obesity had significantly lower rates of severe antepartum
and postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion (Table 5).
Sensitivity Analyses
Although the association between BMI and severe maternal
morbidity or mortality was attenuated after additional adjust-
ment for chronic hypertension and prepregnancy diabetes
mellitus, it remained statistically significant. The largest
changes were in the associations between class 3 obesity and
cardiac morbidity (adjusted OR decreased from 3.5 [95% CI,
2.5-5.0] to 2.0 [95% CI, 1.4-2.9]; adjusted rate difference,
3.8 [95% CI, 1.4-7.3] per 10 000) and acute renal failure (ad-
justed OR decreased from 3.9 [95% CI, 2.0-7.7] to 2.5 [95% CI,

10 000) (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Compared with the women included in the primary analy-
ses, women with missing BMI were older, included higher pro-
portions of women who were African American, Hispanic, and
other race/ethnicity; higher proportions of women with low
educationandwomenwithMedicaidinsurance;andlowerpro-
portions of married women and nulliparous women (eTable 5
in Supplement 2). Women with missing BMI had higher rates
of severe maternal morbidity or mortality (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2). Results of logistic regression after multiple im-
putation for missing BMI were similar to results from the pri-
mary analyses, except for the association between class 3 obe-
sity and antepartum hemorrhage, which was no longer
statistically significant (adjusted OR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.4-1.1]; ad-
justed rate difference, −2.2 [95% CI, −3.8 to 0.6] per 10 000)
(eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Approximately 47% of women had a higher-than-
recommendedweightgainduringpregnancy,whereas19%had
alower-than-recommendedweightgain.Adjustingforlowand
high gestational weight gain did not substantially alter the as-
sociationsbetweenBMIandseverematernalmorbidityormor-
tality (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). Additional adjustment for
opioid drug dependence yielded results similar to those from
the primary analyses (eTable 9 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this study of pregnant women in Washington State, low
and high prepregnancy BMI, compared with normal BMI,
were associated with a statistically significant but small abso-
lute increase in severe maternal morbidity or mortality.
Rates of severe maternal morbidity or mortality showed a

 dose-response pattern among women with above-normal
BMI, with adjusted odds ratios increasing with BMI from nor-
mal to class 3 obesity compared with women with normal
prepregnancy BMI. Underweight women had an increased
risk of antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage with blood
transfusion and renal failure and were more likely to require
a potentially lifesaving intervention. Women with BMI in the
overweight category and obese women had significantly
higher rates of several different subtypes of severe maternal
morbidity. Although relative measures showed higher rates
of severe maternal morbidity or mortality among under-
weight, overweight, and obese women compared with
women who had a normal BMI, the absolute risk of severe
maternal morbidity or mortality was small.
Two studies have examined the association between BMI
andseverematernalmorbidity.11,29 Lindquistetal29 carriedout
a case-control study (with severe maternal morbidity defined
as including eclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism, acute fatty
liver, peripartum hysterectomy, postpartum hemorrhage
with therapy, and uterine rupture) and reported no associa-
tion between BMI and severe maternal morbidity. A study
by Schummers et al11 reported no association between BMI

a Underweight defined as body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared) less than 18.5; normal weight as BMI 18.5 through 24.9; overweight as BMI 25.0 through
29.9; obese class 1 as BMI 30.0 through 34.9; obese class 2 as BMI 35.0 through 39.9; obese class 3
as BMI 40 or greater.
bAdjusted for adjusted for race, marital status, maternal age (5-year categories), smoking, parity (nullipara, para 1-3,
grand multipara [�4]), assisted conception, low education, type of health insurance, year of childbirth,
and male fetus.
c Severe morbidity includes conditions presented in Table 1. Severe morbidity subtypes are not mutually exclusive
(eg, women who had eclampsia and acute renal failure would be included both categories). Pulmonary
thrombosis due to blood clot is included in both the respiratory morbidity and the thromboembolism categories.
dDoes not include superimposed eclampsia.

 and a composite outcome of severe maternal morbidity or
mortality and a significant inverse association between BMI
and postpartum hemorrhage requiring intervention. It is pos-
sible that anemia, which is more common among under-
weightwomen,7exacerbatestheeffectsofhemorrhageandleads
to higher rates of blood transfusion. The association between
high BMI and eclampsia is consistent with a previously re-
ported 2- to 4-fold increased incidence of preeclampsia among
obese women.4,12,14,15,30,31
This study has several strengths, including its large sample
sizeandthebreadthofinformationonmaternalcharacteristics
collectedconsistentlyoverthestudyperiod.Thisfacilitatedthe
analysis of a wide variety of specific clinical conditions.
This study has limitations. First, the observational de-
sign precludes causal inferences. Second, despite the large
study size, there was insufficient statistical power to assess as-
sociations between BMI and rare severe morbidity subtypes
and maternal death. This latter concern necessitated the cre-
ationofcompositemorbidityormortalityoutcomes.Third,the
number of maternal deaths in this study was low compared
with reports on US maternal mortality (including deaths dur-
ing pregnancy and 42 days postpartum).32 The smaller num-
ber of deaths was because this study focused on maternal
deaths during the delivery hospitalization only.
Fourth, reliance on ICD-9-CM codes meant that not all
severely morbid conditions could be captured (eg, use of
ICD-9-CM codes precluded the identification of eclampsia
superimposed on chronic hypertension). As a result, the
reported rates and odds ratios for eclampsia and for the com-
posite severe morbidity or mortality may be underestimated
among overweight and obese women. Fifth, errors and
omissions in diagnostic coding that are inevitable in large
databases may have led to underreporting and nondifferen-
tial misclassification and may have biased results toward the
null. Sixth, data on income were not available, and results
were therefore adjusted for characteristics of socioeconomic
status such as marital status, education, race, and type of
medical insurance.
Seventh, information on maternal education, race, and
BMI was self-reported and potentially inaccurate. Although
self-reported BMI has not been validated in US birth certifi-
cates, patterns of obesity among women from various ethnic
backgrounds described in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey are consistent with patterns from birth
certificate data,3,33 and patterns of prepregnancy obesity by
state obtained from birth certificates are generally consistent
with patterns obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-
veillance System.33,34 Proportions of women in each BMI cat-
egory in this study were consistent with BMI data previously
reported among mothers in the United States.3,33,34 Rates of
gestational weight gain that were less or more than recom-
mended values were also similar to those recently reported.35
Eighth, the study population only included women aged 15 to
60 years with singleton births and with linked birth certifi-
cates and hospital delivery data, and these restrictions may
have affected the generalizability of the findings. Ninth, in-
formation on visceral adiposity, which is not entirely cap-
tured by BMI and may be the primary characteristic associ-
ated with adverse health outcomes in obese women,36 was not
available in the data source.
Conclusions
Among pregnant women in Washington State, low and high
prepregnancy BMI, compared with normal BMI, were associ-
ated with a statistically significant but small absolute in-
crease in severe maternal morbidity or mortality.
