Abstract
Traumatic peripheral nerve damage is a major medical problem
without effective treatment options. In repurposing studies on
4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker that provides
symptomatic relief in some chronic neurological afflictions, we
discovered this agent offers significant promise as a small mole-
cule regenerative agent for acute traumatic nerve injury. We
found, in a mouse model of sciatic crush injury, that sustained
early 4-AP administration increased the speed and extent of
behavioral recovery too rapidly to be explained by axonal regener-
ation. Further studies demonstrated that 4-AP also enhanced
recovery of nerve conduction velocity, promoted remyelination,
and increased axonal area post-injury. We additionally found that
4-AP treatment enables distinction between incomplete and
complete lesions more rapidly than existing approaches, thereby
potentially addressing the critical challenge of more effectively
distinguishing injured individuals who may require mutually exclu-
sive treatment approaches. Thus, 4-AP singularly provides both a
new potential therapy to promote durable recovery and remyelina-
tion in acute peripheral nerve injury and a means of identifying
lesions in which this therapy would be most likely to be of value.

Introduction
One of the most exciting opportunities for efficient development of
new medical interventions is by repurposing existing therapeutic
agents for novel applications. A particularly promising approach to
such repurposing is to discover situations in which known proper-
ties of existing agents can be exploited to provide clinically relevant
benefits in settings that are qualitatively different than their estab-
lished use.
We have applied such a repurposing approach to the medical
problem of enhancing functional recovery after traumatic peripheral
nerve injuries. Such injuries occur in ~3% of all trauma patients
(Taylor et al, 2008; Asplund et al, 2009; Fex Svennigsen & Dahlin,
2013; Sakuma et al, 2015) and can cause severe loss of both motor
and sensory functions. A significant subset of injuries [representing,
e.g. 45% of peripheral nerve injuries in British soldiers injured in
Iraq or Afghanistan between 2005 and 2010 (Birch et al, 2012)]
exhibit eventual spontaneous recovery, while others require surgical
intervention if recovery is ever going to occur. Those injuries in
which recovery can occur spontaneously, categorized as neura-
praxic lesions, are thought to represent instances in which at least
some axons retain continuity through the lesion site. In contrast, if
all axons are transected, then recovery depends upon surgical inter-
ventions that require cutting of the nerve to present clean ends for
rejoining as quickly as possible after injury (Campbell, 2008; Niver
& Ilyas, 2014; Ljungquist et al, 2015). The decision whether to
perform a surgical intervention or not poses a challenging situation
for any surgeon. If the surgery is performed too early, any potential
for spontaneous recovery is lost. On the other hand, categorization
of an injury as neurapraxic is equally risky as the validity of such a
diagnosis depends on a spontaneous recovery after weeks or
months post-injury (e.g. Shah & Jebson, 2008; Bishop & Ring, 2009;
Birch et al, 2012). If no recovery occurs, the opportunity for prompt
surgical intervention has been lost. Thus, the approaches of
extended patient observation and surgical intervention present
options that are effectively mutually exclusive.
There are two possible ways to address the above challenges: One
is to enhance the speed of recovery in neurapraxic lesions, thus
shortening the time required for spontaneous recovery to be
observed, while a second is to provide prospective methods of identi-
fying lesions in which axonal continuity exists. Enhancing the speed

 and/or extent of recovery in neurapraxic lesions is by itself an impor-
tant medical goal that would improve the quality of life for injured
individuals while decreasing costs of medical care and also poten-
tially decreasing the secondary consequences that occur when nerve
function is lost (e.g. lost wages, worker productivity). Moreover, the
present inability to enhance recovery in neurapraxic lesions, or at
least to identify such lesions more quickly, compromises the possible
implementation of therapies to improve axonal regeneration in cut
nerves by delaying the utilization of such therapies.
The importance of enhancing functional recovery after peripheral
nerve injury has spurred multiple research efforts on this topic (e.g.
Wan et al, 2010a,b; Makoukji et al, 2012; Fex Svennigsen & Dahlin,
2013; Stassart et al, 2013; McLean et al, 2014; Nishimoto et al, 2015;
Tang et al, 2015) with one of the most extensively studied and
promising approaches being transient electrical stimulation of the
nerve. Electrical stimulation was first reported to increase the speed
of functional recovery after experimental peripheral nerve injury
over 30 years ago and can promote both axonal regeneration and
repair of damage to myelin (e.g. Nix & Hopf, 1983; Pockett & Gavin,
1985; Al-Majed et al, 2000; Brushart et al, 2002; Ahlborn et al, 2007;
English et al, 2007; Geremia et al, 2007; Vivo et al, 2008; Haastert-
Talini et al, 2011; Huang et al, 2012; Singh et al, 2012). Despite the
long-standing interest in electrical stimulation as a potential therapy
for peripheral nerve injury, however, implementing this approach
has proven challenging (see e.g. Sakuma et al, 2015) and it remains
relatively unused as a therapeutic strategy.
We hypothesized that if the benefits of electrical stimulation are
due to promoting nerve conduction, then pharmacological promotion
of impulse conduction should also prove beneficial. We investigated
this hypothesis by repurposing of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potas-
sium channel blocker that has not previously been investigated in the
context of acute application for traumatic nervous system injury,
despite over three decades of study as a potential means of restoring
neurological function in a variety of chronic afflictions (e.g. Lundh
et al, 1977, 1979; Jones et al, 1983; Stefoski et al, 1987; Hayes et al,
1994; Polman et al, 1994; Segal & Brunnemann, 1998; Wolfe et al,
2001; DeForge et al, 2004; Grijalva et al, 2010; Claassen et al, 2013;
Kremmyda et al, 2013; Jensen et al, 2014; Strupp et al, 2014).
In contrast to all previous published studies on 4-AP, we now show
that 4-AP is a potent small molecule neuroregenerative agent that
enhances both the speed and extent of functional recovery following
acute peripheral nerve injury, promotes remyelination, and uniquely
among experimental therapies, also enables rapid identification of
lesions with axonal continuity. We thus provide a new approach to
both treatment and diagnosis of peripheral nerve injuries, based on the
discovery of unanticipated benefits of 4-AP in such a setting. The fact
that 4-AP is already approved for clinical use for other purposes makes
this a compelling candidate to consider for potential clinical studies.
Results
4-AP rapidly enhances functional recovery in acute peripheral
nerve injury
As restoration of motor function is the primary goal in treatment of
peripheral nerve injury, we first examined the effects of 4-AP admin-
istration on this outcome. We employed a standard compression
model of sciatic nerve injury (e.g. Magill et al, 2007; Elfar et al,
2008; Savastano et al, 2014) so as not to prejudice experiments
toward an absolute requirement for axonal regeneration. To test the
clinical relevance of this approach, we initiated treatment 24 h post-
injury in order to provide a clinically relevant window of therapeu-
tic opportunity. Mice were treated daily (in the afternoon) with a
single injection of 10 lg 4-AP (which approximates a relevant
human dose calculated by body weight, but is only ~10% of the
mouse body surface area equivalent (Reagan-Shaw et al, 2008) of
the dosage of 20 mg/day used in treating multiple sclerosis (e.g.
Dunn & Blight, 2011; Krishnan & Kiernan, 2013). Motor function
was assessed with standard sciatic function index (SFI) analysis
(Inserra et al, 1998), using measurements of total footprint length,
toe spread, and intermediate toe spread. To determine whether
improvements
were dependent on the
presence of
drug, all
measurements were conducted 20–22 h post-treatment, when the
estimated biological half-life of 4-AP in rodents would have caused
levels to decrease to < 0.01% of initial dosage (Capacio et al, 1996)
and effects requiring the presence of 4-AP are no longer observable.
We found that once-daily administration of 10 lg 4-AP enhanced
the speed of recovery from crush injury (Fig 1A). As early as 3 days
post-injury, mice treated daily (beginning 24 h post-injury) already
showed a significant > 25% improvement in gait function over vehi-
cle-treated animals. At 5 and 8 days post-injury, 4-AP-treated mice
showed statistically significant twofold greater levels of improve-
ment than vehicle-treated controls.
Daily 4-AP administration enhances recovery of nerve conduction
velocity and does not enhance neuropathic pain responses
As recovery of motor function was too rapid to be explained by axonal
regeneration (which occurs at a speed of about 1 mm/day), we consid-
ered the possibility that recovery was due to restoration of nerve
conduction by other means. To examine this possibility, we first investi-
gated the effects of daily 4-AP administration on restoration of nerve
conduction velocity (NCV) after sciatic nerve crush. NCV decreases as a
consequence of injury, and restoring the speed of impulse conduction
to normal levels is a desired outcome of a regenerative therapy.
Daily 4-AP treatment increased both the speed of improvement
in NCV after sciatic nerve crush and the total amount of recovery
seen over 35 days (Fig 1B). Nerve crush caused a > 80% decrease
in NCV at 7 days post-injury, with only partial recovery over
35 days to 55% of pre-injury NCV. Small, but not yet significant,
increases in NCV were seen as early as 7 days after initiation of
4-AP treatment. By 21 days post-injury, 4-AP-treated mice recovered
64% of the normal velocity of conduction followed by 73 and 82%
of normal NCV at 28 and 35 days post-injury, respectively (all of
which improvements were statistically significant as compared with
vehicle-treated mice at all time points).
As peripheral nerve damage often causes neuropathic pain
syndromes, and the injury model used in our studies is a standard
model for causing such syndromes in the laboratory (e.g. Barriere
et al, 2009), we also examined the effects of 4-AP treatment on pain
responses, with a primary concern of determining whether treat-
ment worsened such responses. In these experiments, injured mice
treated
with
4-AP
were
examined
for
thermal
hyperalgesia
(Hargreaves assay) or mechanical allodynia (von Frey assay) at
3, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 21 days post-injury.

 4-AP treatment did not worsen symptoms of neuropathic pain
and instead appeared to improve symptoms of thermal hyperalgesia
(Fig 1C). Saline-treated injured mice showed significantly increased
thermal sensitivity at days 3, 5, and 8 post-injury and returned to
baseline sensitivity by day 11, while mice treated with 4-AP only
showed increased sensitivity on day 3. Both 4-AP and saline-treated
mice showed significantly increased sensitivity to mechanical stim-
uli at days 3 and 5 post-injury before returning to baseline values,
with no differences between the two experimental groups (Fig 1D).
Moreover, there were no changes in response to either type of
stimulus in the uninjured limb.
Localized slow-release administration of 4-AP promotes
enhanced recovery
As one of the common features in studies on electrical stimulation is
that each treatment period is limited in length (usually for 30 min,
even when administered on multiple days (e.g. Wan et al, 2010a,b;
McLean et al, 2014), it is possible that the pulsatile effects of
transient stimulation are required to obtain benefit. As the short
half-life of 4-AP would effectively constitute a pulsatile stimulation,
we next utilized localized slow-release formulations of 4-AP to
provide continuous administration.
To examine effects of sustained administration of 4-AP, we
developed localized slow-release approaches to 4-AP delivery based
on encapsulation of 4-AP in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA,
50:50) microparticles and films, which exhibit different loading
capacities and release rates. Loading capacities were 0.8–1.0 lg
4-AP/mg PLGA for particle carriers and 60 lg 4-AP/mg PLGA for
films. The releasing profile of (4-AP)-PLGA microparticles in vitro
was
25.8 lg/mg/day
with
continued
release
over
~30 days
(Appendix Fig S1). This dosage, released over the course of 24 h, is
< 1% of the already low daily dosages delivered by intraperitoneal
injections in our first experiments. (4-AP)-PLGA films demonstrated
a higher rate of release, with 70% of the 4-AP (i.e. 210 lg) released
over the first few days followed by a release rate of ~143 lg/mg/
day. We also confirmed that (4-AP)-PLGA carriers labeled with
rhodamine and implanted directly onto the crushed nerves (using

 PEG hydrogel to hold them in place) remained in place for at least
2 weeks as detected by noninvasive imaging (Appendix Fig S2).
Recovery surgery at 3 weeks post-implantation confirmed the
continued presence of the PLGA carriers despite the natural motion
and inflammatory response to crush injury over the treatment
period (Appendix Fig S2). Finally, the bioactivity of 4-AP released
from the PLGA delivery systems was confirmed by in vitro collection
of 4-AP released from PLGA formulations, followed by administra-
tion in vivo. The 4-AP released in vitro after encapsulation appeared
to be identical in efficacy to 4-AP that was freshly made up before
administration (Appendix Fig S3). Further details on carrier fabrica-
tion, loading and analysis are provided in the Appendix.
Sustained release administration of 4-AP was also effective in
restoring function after crush injury to the sciatic nerve (Figs 2A and
EV1A), even when the total amount of 4-AP delivered was < 0.1% of
the total daily dosage applied in our first experiments. In these experi-
ments, either of the two PLGA formulations of 4-AP or identical PLGA
formulations not containing 4-AP were placed on the lesion site at the
time of injury (so as not to subject mice to a second surgery). As for
i.p. administration, we examined motor recovery and NCV recovery.
At 5 days post-injury, mice treated with (4-AP)-PLGA carriers
demonstrated significantly improved gait function compared to
vehicle-treated controls. Animals implanted with (4-AP)-PLGA films
(containing 300 lg 4-AP in 5 mg of PLGA film) had a 40% improve-
ment compared to vehicle-implanted control mice at 3 days post-
injury (not statistically different at this time point), while mice
implanted with 4-AP-containing particles showed a statistically
significant 45% improvement at this time point. Mice implanted
with 4-AP-containing films showed a steady improvement in motor
function over 14 days, while those implanted with particles showed
a brief plateau before an improved recovery. Mice implanted with
4-AP-containing films showed a threefold improvement by day 5
and a 3.5-fold improvement by day 8 post-injury (which was statisti-
cally significant for both time points; Fig 2A). Administration of
4-AP in PLGA films showed a trend toward being more effective
than delivery in PLGA particles (Fig EV1A).
NCV in mice treated with local 4-AP administration also
improved more rapidly than in mice treated with vehicle alone. As
with i.p. delivery of 4-AP, the total amount of improvement in NCV
in 4-AP-treated mice was greater than that seen in vehicle-treated
mice. Significantly greater improvement in NCV was apparent in
mice treated with (4-AP)-PLGA particles by the third week post-
treatment, indicating that benefit was provided by local activity of
4-AP (as the amount of drug released was so low that systemic effects
would not have occurred). Larger improvements were seen in mice
treated with (4-AP)-PLGA films (Figs 2B and EV1B; 14.6 � 1.3 m/s
versus 19.2 � 2.1 m/s versus 27.9 � 3.2 m/s, respectively, with
differences being statistically significant for both Ctl versus particles
and Ctl versus films). By 5 weeks post-injury, mice treated with
4-AP-containing films had a 65% faster NCV than vehicle-treated mice
(39.2 � 2.9 m/s versus 25.4 � 3.6 m/s, a significant difference). As
for systemic 4-AP administration, and as expected from patterns of
recovery from nerve injury seen clinically, the restoration of near-
normal NCV took longer to achieve than restoration of normal SFI.
Sustained 4-AP treatment enhances neuronal area and
myelination and number of myelinated axons
Changes in NCV require changes in axonal structural properties,
and the two axonal properties known to contribute to the speed of
impulse conduction are cross-sectional area and myelination (e.g.
Sanders & Whitteridge, 1946; Waxman, 1980; Ikeda & Oka, 2012
and references therein). We therefore next examined the effects of
4-AP treatment on these parameters.
Injured mice treated with 4-AP films (the most effective of our
treatments) showed small but significant increases in average
axonal area in nerves examined 21 days after injury and film appli-
cation (as detected by ultrastructural analysis; Fig 3). This time

 point was examined because this was the earliest time point at
which we observed significant NCV changes (Fig 2B). We measured
axonal area rather than diameter due to the changes in cross-
sectional circularity associated with injury, and we focused atten-
tion on myelinated axons because of the role of these fibers in motor
function. In uninjured axons, the average area of a myelinated axon
(excluding the myelin) was 11.2 � 1.3 lm2. In injured nerves
treated with PLGA film only, the average area of myelinated axons
decreased to 5.7 � 0.2 lm2 (Fig 3B). In contrast, in nerves treated
with 4-AP-containing films, the average area of myelinated axons
was 6.7 � 0.4 lm2, a significant improvement versus mice treated
only with film. In addition, the proportion of axons with areas
above the average value for uninjured nerves was 5 � 3% in
injured nerves treated with vehicle alone but showed a statistically
significant threefold increase to 15 � 2% in nerves treated with
4-AP-containing films.
Ultrastructural analysis also revealed that localized 4-AP treat-
ment caused significant changes in myelination post-injury. Mice
treated with 4-AP-containing films exhibited an increased myelin
thickness and area compared with mice treated with PLGA alone.
On day 21 after injury, the average thickness of the myelin within
the injured area was 0.53 � 0.03 lm but showed a statistically
significant increase to 0.95 � 0.14 lm with localized 4-AP adminis-
tration, as compared with an average myelin thickness in uninjured
nerves of 1.26 � 0.08 lm. In 4-AP-treated mice, 21.4 � 10.8% of
axons had a myelin thickness above the average for uninjured
nerve, while vehicle-treated mice had no axons with a myelin thick-
ness above the average. We also measured myelin area (Fig 4A)
and found the average cross-sectional area of myelin per myelinated
large axon in uninjured nerve was 14.8 � 1.7 lm2, was decreased
to 4.9 � 0.3 lm2 in injured nerve, and was significantly increased
to 10.1 � 0.7 lm2 with localized 4-AP administration. In 4-AP-
treated mice, 21.2 � 9.3% of axons had myelin areas that were
above the average for uninjured nerve, while this value in vehicle-
treated mice was only 1.9 � 1.4%.
Benefits of treatment were also observed by analysis of the ratio
of the area of the axon to the area of the axon plus associated
myelin. This garea-ratio, a variant of the usually employed g-ratio,
was calculated due to the decreased circularity in injured nerves.
We found that, at 21 days after injury, the average garea-ratio in
crushed nerves increased significantly from 0.43 � 0.01 (healthy
sciatic nerve) to 0.54 � 0.06 (crushed and vehicle-treated sciatic
nerve). However, with local 4-AP treatment, the garea-ratio improved
significantly and was in the normal range of 0.43 � 0.09 (Fig 4B).
In addition, in 4-AP-treated mice, 54.4 � 18.5% of myelinated
axons showed a garea-ratio less than the average for uninjured mice,
while this value in vehicle-treated mice was 14.4 � 1.4%.
Increases in myelin were also observed by immunofluorescence
and Western blot analysis for the myelin-specific P0 protein. Analy-
sis of tissue lysates at 21 days post-injury/treatment (Fig 4C and D)
showed that 4-AP-treated nerves contained 61 � 15% more P0
protein in the lesion area than seen in the nerves in vehicle-treated

 animals, a significant increase. Levels of P0 protein increased over
time as determined by immunofluorescence analysis in sections of
crushed nerves treated with vehicle alone or with 4-AP (Fig 4E).
The number of myelinated axons was also significantly greater in
4-AP-treated mice examined at 21 days post-injury, as determined
by ultrastructural analysis (Fig 4F). The number of total myelinated
axons per TEM grid examined (2,310 lm2) was 82 � 5 axons in
undamaged nerve, as compared with 55 � 4 axons in injured vehi-
cle-treated mice and 71 � 4 axons in 4-AP-treated mice, a signifi-
cant increase over vehicle-treated mice) Similar trends were seen for
total axons (Fig 4F; 259 � 42 versus 140 � 22 versus 190 � 21,
respectively) and for unmyelinated axons (177 � 44 versus 86 � 18
versus 118 � 19, respectively; not shown), but these differences did

4-AP treatment increased the number of myelinated axons (**P = 0.002; ANOVA with post hoc comparisons using two-tailed unpaired t-test; n = 4). Even though
the 4-AP-treated group also exhibited a greater number of total axons, this difference was not statistically significant. All myelinated and total axons were counted
in five randomly chosen grids from each of 4 nerves for each group. This experiment represents a single group of mice of one of three replicates on NCV recovery.

4-AP promotes peripheral nerve remyelination

Published online: November 14, 2016 
 4-AP administration in acute injuries enables rapid identification
of lesions with axonal continuity
We also examined the possibility that activities of 4-AP could be
harnessed to provide a novel solution to the problem of prospectively
identifying individuals with axonal continuity. Specifically, in trau-
matic injuries, it would be valuable to discriminate quickly between
patients in which some axonal continuity exists and those for whom
complete axonal transection has occurred because these two groups
represent distinct clinical populations that require mutually exclusive
interventions. In the former case, preservation and/or enhancement
of function of existing axonal connections (e.g. by promoting remyeli-
nation) may be able to bring significant benefits. In contrast, in the
latter case, benefit can only be achieved if some form of axonal regen-
eration occurs. Current electro-diagnostic approaches to categorizing
nerve injury typically distinguish neurapraxia retrospectively. In the
best circumstances, diagnosis can be made 1–6 weeks post-injury,
but often requires still longer times (e.g. Robinson, 2000; Lee et al,
2004; Perry, 2005; Campbell, 2008; Shah & Jebson, 2008; Bishop &
Ring, 2009; Birch, 2010; Birch et al, 2012; Kimura, 2013; Ljungquist
et al, 2015). This delay in diagnosis eliminates opportunities for
prompt surgical intervention when such treatment is required.
In comparison with the long periods needed to analyze axonal
continuity by electrophysiological approaches, when we examined
mice within 1 h of a single injection of 10 lg 4-AP (i.p. 24 h post-
injury), we observed significantly improved SFI function in mice
with crush injuries, but not in mice with transected nerves (Fig 5).
All effects were transient (< 4 h), as predicted from known clear-
ance rates for 4-AP (Uges et al, 1982). To examine whether these
short-term effects might be the result of 4-AP’s ability to enhance
synaptic efficacy (e.g. Vizi et al, 1977; Lundh, 1978), we also treated
mice with neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor that causes
increased concentrations of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular
junction (e.g. Treffers et al, 1988). Neostigmine treatment, however,
did not cause any changes in SFI (Fig 5C).
Thus, acute administration of a single treatment with 4-AP
enables a rapid distinction to be made between injuries in which the
damaged nerve contained axons that traversed the lesion site and
those in which all axons were transected.
Discussion
Sustained administration of 4-AP after acute traumatic peripheral
nerve injury offers a novel approach to addressing currently unmet
medical needs and provides new uses of this therapeutic agent in
settings qualitatively different from its established utility. Despite the
lack of prior indications for utility of 4-AP in acute injuries or for
enhancing tissue repair, we found that acute initiation of sustained
4-AP treatment enhanced both the speed and extent of recovery of
normal motor behavior after crush injury to the sciatic nerve, as
analyzed by SFI. Moreover, sustained 4-AP treatment enhanced both
the speed and extent of restoration of normal NCV and caused regen-
erative increases in axonal area, myelin thickness, and levels of the
myelin-specific P0 protein. These benefits were not associated with
increases in neuropathic pain, as determined by analysis of response
to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Indeed, 4-AP treatment appeared
to enhance recovery of a normal response to thermal stimuli. Acute
transient administration of 4-AP additionally provides a new approach
to the identification of nerve injuries in which at least some axons still
traverse the lesion site, and thus has additional potential utility as a
new approach to diagnosis of peripheral nerve injuries in a manner
relevant to initiation of appropriate therapeutic approaches.
Despite being studied for over 30 years in settings of chronic
neurological illness, there are no prior indications that 4-AP would

 provide durable improvements that are essential for regenerative
applications (e.g. Lundh et al, 1977, 1979; Jones et al, 1983;
Stefoski et al, 1987; Hayes et al, 1994; Polman et al, 1994; Segal &
Brunnemann, 1998; Wolfe et al, 2001; DeForge et al, 2004; Grijalva
et al, 2010; Claassen et al, 2013; Kremmyda et al, 2013; Jensen
et al, 2014; Strupp et al, 2014). Moreover, the only two published
examinations of 4-AP in acute settings provide no evidence for util-
ity in experimental SCI (Haghighi et al, 1995) or in acute vestibular
failure (Beck et al, 2014).
We hypothesized that if the widely observed benefits of electrical
stimulation in models of peripheral nerve injury are due to simulating
nerve conduction, then pharmacologically enabling impulse conduc-
tion should also prove beneficial. The only pharmacological agent
that is clinically approved for other purposes and that might be useful
to achieve this outcome is 4-AP, which enables impulse conduction
in demyelinated axons, theoretically by blocking K+ channels that
allow leakage of K+ from these axons and thereby enabling axons to
restore the level of depolarization required for propagation of action
potentials (e.g. Sherratt et al, 1980; Bostock et al, 1981; Targ &
Kocsis, 1985; Blight, 1989; Davis et al, 1995; Hayes, 2004).
Several of our findings suggest that 4-AP treatment is an attractive
candidate for clinical consideration as a treatment for acute peripheral
nerve injury. First, durable and significant improvements in motor
function occurred very rapidly (within 3 days post-injury and after just
2 days of treatment), with a speed much greater than could be
explained by axonal regeneration. These improvements are unlikely to
be due to the presence of residual 4-AP as a single dose of this agent
only caused a transient functional improvement, after which SFI
returned to pretreatment values. Improvements in NCV also occurred
more quickly and were greater than seen in vehicle-treated mice.
Although improvements in NCV occurred more slowly than behavioral
improvements, such an outcome is consistent with clinical observa-
tions. Electro-diagnostic improvement may depend on a greater
proportion of neurons acting in a particular way than is required to
observe changes in motor function. If 4-AP improved motor function
by enabling activity of a relatively small number of demyelinated
neurons, this may not be observable by electrophysiological analysis.
The observations that the time course of recovery was too rapid
to be due to axonal regeneration led to the unexpected discovery
that sustained 4-AP treatment promoted remyelination after crush
injury. Remyelination was observed by TEM and by analysis of P0
expression, and improvements in NCV were also consistent with
remyelination. Improvements in NCV might also be due, at least in
part, to increases in axonal area. As axonal area is increased during
myelination (Starr et al, 1996), however, it might be that this
change in area is primarily due to repair of myelin damage.
Still a further clinically relevant benefit provided by 4-AP was the
ability to cause improved motor function even after a single dose of
this agent, delivered 24 h after injury, an observation that could have
important consequences for classification and treatment of injuries.
The ability of 4-AP to so rapidly improve motor function requires the
presence of axonal continuity through the lesion site and appears
more likely to be due to enabling axonal conduction than increasing
synaptic efficacy, as treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor
neostigmine had no effect on motor behavior. Use of 4-AP to identify
lesions with such properties offers the possibility of complementing
current approaches to lesion diagnosis, which are dependent on retro-
spective analysis of recovery,
with a means
of prospectively
identifying lesions in which at least some axonal continuity exists.
This would have the dual benefits of being able to assign appropriate
patients for treatment with remyelination therapies and also could
enable more rapid identification of patients for whom recovery is
dependent on surgical intervention. Even if a single 4-AP treatment
did not provide these outcomes in clinical settings, shortening the time
required to observe recovery would also improve the ability to identify
lesions that warrant surgical intervention. Such improvements would
be of great importance, as current approaches to diagnosis that rely on
a combination of electrodiagnosis and observation of lesions over an
extensive period can delay clinical management decisions for as long
as 4–6 months, with electrodiagnosis at 7 weeks considered to be an
early time point for use of electrodiagnosis in radial nerve injury
caused by bone fracture, for example (Shah & Jebson, 2008; Bishop &
Ring, 2009). As more rapid repair yields superior outcomes over
delayed repair (Campbell, 2008; Niver & Ilyas, 2014; Ljungquist et al,
2015), this also would be a useful application of 4-AP in acute injury.
The use of 4-AP to identify lesions with axonal continuity more
quickly than is currently possible may also offer a valuable comple-
mentary diagnostic classification system to the Seddon and Sutherland
classifications originally proposed in 1943 and 1978, respectively (e.g.
Campbell, 2008).
Thus, 4-AP administration appears to provide a solution to two of
the biggest challenges in treating peripheral nerve injury, by enhanc-
ing the speed of recovery in neurapraxic lesions and providing a
potential means of even more rapidly identifying lesions in which
axonal continuity exists. 4-AP is unique in providing an ability to
achieve both of these goals with a single agent and thus differs from
other attempts to promote remyelination (e.g. Makoukji et al, 2012;
Stassart et al, 2013). Moreover, even if it is correct that 4-AP promotes
remyelination by pharmacologically causing similar effects as electri-
cal stimulation (Wan et al, 2010a,b; McLean et al, 2014), there are
several reasons why 4-AP may offer a more attractive candidate for
clinical studies. First, implantation of sustained release formulations
of 4-AP provides clear benefit, while repeated application of electrical
stimulation may cause adverse outcomes (Gigo-Benato et al, 2010).
4-AP also is already approved for clinical use, and the studies leading
to this approval provide extensive information relevant to potential
use of 4-AP in new settings. 4-AP also has the advantage of distribut-
ing effectively throughout the body and thus could be used to treat
injuries in multiple locations with a single intervention, while use of
electrical stimulation has to be applied to defined lesion sites. Even
when the location of a lesion is established, our discovery that local-
ized slow-release administration of 4-AP is also therapeutically effec-
tive may provide advantages over electrical stimulation by virtue of
being applicable as a one-time treatment without requiring multiple
clinical visits. We do not yet know if 4-AP can, like electrical stimula-
tion, promote axonal regeneration (a topic of future studies), but even
if it does not provide this benefit, its use still would promote remyeli-
nation and would enable more rapid identification of lesions in which
the surgical interventions required to enable axonal regeneration to
occur can be conducted.
Finally, it is important to consider that 4-AP provides a potent
example of the greater importance of the activity of an agent, as
contrasted with the exact mechanism of action, in developing novel
therapeutic interventions. Despite over 30 years of clinical and
research studies, it is still unclear whether the benefits provided to
individuals with multiple sclerosis are due to enabling conduction in

 demyelinated axons, enhancing synaptic efficacy, or both. Indeed, it
is not yet clear if the concentrations of 4-AP achieved in vivo are high
enough to bind to the K+ channels thought to be 4-AP’s targets
(Dunn & Blight, 2011). Yet, 4-AP has proven to be a safe and effec-
tive therapy for many individuals with multiple sclerosis (e.g. Dunn
& Blight, 2011; Blight et al, 2014; Jensen et al, 2014). If its use were
held back until such mechanism-related questions were satisfactorily
solved, patients would be denied such benefits. We suggest the same
considerations are likely to apply to the potential use of 4-AP in treat-
ing and diagnosing acute traumatic injury to peripheral nerves.

poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)
(50:50, acid terminated, average MW 38,000–54,000) were from
Sigma-Aldrich, anti-P0 monoclonal antibodies from Aves Labs Inc.;
anti-b-actin antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Hydrogel
PEGDM was kindly provided by Danielle S.W. Benoit (University of
Rochester).
Mouse model of peripheral nerve injury
All animal experiments described were approved by the University
Committee on Animal Resources (IACUC) at the University of
Rochester Medical Center. Anesthetized 10-week-old female C57BL6
mice had the sciatic nerve bluntly exposed directly posterior to the
femur. Mice randomly then underwent wound closure without
manipulation of the nerve (sham-surgery group), or crush injury of
30-s duration (crush-injury group), as described in, for example
(Magill et al, 2007; Elfar et al, 2008). All experiments were repeated
at least three times with a minimum of 5 mice (and generally 8
mice) per experimental group.
For systemic application of 4-AP, drug or saline was injected (10 lg
once per day, i.p.) for the duration of the experiment. For localized
application of 4-AP, 5 mg of (4-AP)-PLGA particles (containing ~10 lg
4-AP) were suspended in 20 ll PEG hydrogel then photopolymerized
in a plastic tube mold (0.02 inches in diameter) to form a (4-AP)-PLGA
particles/PEG hydrogel ribbon. This ribbon was placed at the crushed
site of the injured nerve immediately after the surgery. For (4-AP)-
PLGA films, 5 mg of film (containing 300 lg 4-AP) was shredded to
yield fragments of ~1 mm × 3 mm size, which were placed at the
crushed site of the sciatic nerve in 20 ll PEG hydrogel, followed by
wound closure procedure. Fabrication and release kinetics of (4-AP)-
PLGA carriers are discussed in the Appendix.
Sciatic function index (SFI) determined by walking track analysis
Assessment of motor function recovery was performed by calculat-
ing the sciatic function index (SFI) (de Medinaceli et al, 1982), as
described previously (Elfar et al, 2008). Briefly, individual footprints
were obtained by painting each foot prior to mice walking a 50 cm
path down a narrow corridor lined with paper. Gait was measured
from the metrics of resulting footprints: (i) toe spread (TS) (first
through fifth toes), (ii) total print length (PL), and (iii) intermediate
toe spread (ITS) (second, third, and fourth toes) of both limbs. If
motor dysfunction was so severe as to cause overlap of toe prints,
footprints were magnified to enable analysis. All three measure-
ments from three clearly inked randomly chosen footprints per trial
were taken from the normal (N) and experimental (E) sides, and the
SFI was calculated using the following formula: SFI = �38.3((EPL �
NPL)/NPL) + 109.5((ETS � NTS)/NTS) + 13.3((EIT � NIT)/NIT) –
8.8, where E is the injured limb and N is the control limb as in
previous studies (Gladman et al, 2012).
Nerve conduction velocity and response to noxious stimuli
Nerve conduction studies were performed by electrical stimulation
of a nerve and recording the compound muscle action potential
(CMAP) from needle electrodes overlying a muscle supplied by that
nerve, as in, for example (Gupta & Steward, 2003; Osuchowski et al,
2009). The EMG method was performed with subdermal stainless
steel needle electrode placed into the hindlimbs (6 V, 0.1 ms, 1 Hz,
5–15 mA). The stimulating electrode was placed in resting muscle
on gluteal fold to obtain the first CMAP. Then, the stimulating elec-
trode was moved to popliteal fossa with a 10 mm fixed distance
from gluteal fold to get the second record of CMAP. Nerve conduc-
tion velocity (NCV) was determined from the latencies of the poten-
tials and the distance between two stimulating positions (10 mm).
Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were determined in
injured and uninjured limbs by Von Frey and Hargreaves analyses,
as described in the Appendix. Uninjured limbs showed no effect of
4-AP treatment.
Transmission electron microscopy
Sciatic nerves were immersion fixed and processed by standard
procedures (see Appendix). Grids were examined using a Hitachi
7650 TEM and photographed using an attached Gatan Erlangshen
11 megapixel digital camera system.
Immunofluorescence analyses
Experimental and contralateral (uninjured) sciatic nerves from each
test group were harvested at specific time points during healing and
recovery and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (3 h) and embedded in
paraffin. Slides were pretreated with 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for antigen retrieval. Nonspecific blocking was performed with 1:20
diluted serum for 30 min. Sequentially sectioned slides were incu-
bated with primary antibody overnight, followed by incubation with
a fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h.
Immunoblotting analyses
The crushed site of the sciatic nerve at 21 days post-injury was
collected and lysed in cell extraction buffer (Invitrogen). Samples
were
resolved
on
SDS–PAGE
gels
and
transferred
to
PVDF
membranes (PerkinElmer Life Science, Wellesley, MA, USA). After
blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20, membranes were incubated with a primary antibody,
followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Problem
Traumatic peripheral nerve damage is a major medical problem with-
out effective treatment options and in which diagnostic approaches
have been static for decades. Even in lesions with the potential for
spontaneous
recovery, functional
restoration
occurs
slowly,
thus
impacting quality of life for these individuals and increasing the time
to identification of individuals in whom prompt surgical intervention
is needed if recovery will ever occur.
Results
Results provided in this manuscript indicate that 4-aminopyridine
(4-AP), a potassium channel blocker long studied in the context of
chronic neurological afflictions, offers significant promise as a small
molecule regenerative agent following acute traumatic nerve injury.
In crush injuries of the mouse sciatic nerve, 4-AP treatment acceler-
ated behavioral
and electrophysiological
recovery
and enhanced
remyelination post-injury. In addition, 4-AP treatment enabled distinc-
tion between incomplete and complete lesions more rapidly than
existing approaches, thus offering the possibility of more effectively
distinguishing between injuries that may require distinct therapeutic
approaches.
Impact
The ability of 4-AP to promote durable recovery and remyelination
following acute traumatic nerve injury offers a potentially valuable
new use of this agent as a small molecule regenerative agent able to
enhance endogenous repair. As constant daily 4-AP administration is
already approved to improve chronic walking disability in multiple
sclerosis, transient use for regenerative purposes offers a compelling
opportunity for future clinical studies. The additional ability of 4-AP
to enable rapid distinction between incomplete and complete nerve
injuries means this one drug can potentially be used to identify
lesions in which short-term treatment with 4-AP to promote durable
recovery would be most likely to be beneficial and also to more
rapidly identify individuals for whom timely surgical intervention is
required to enhance the likelihood of recovery.
