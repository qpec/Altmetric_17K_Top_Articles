Abstract: It is unclear whether consumption of low-calorie beverages (LCB) leads to compensatory
consumption of sweet foods, thus reducing benefits for weight control or diet quality. This analysis
investigated associations between beverage consumption and energy intake and diet quality of
adults in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (2008–2011; n = 1590), classified
into: (a) non-consumers of soft drinks (NC); (b) LCB consumers; (c) sugar-sweetened beverage
(SSB) consumers; or (d) consumers of both beverages (BB), based on 4-day dietary records.
Within-person data on beverage consumption on different days assessed the impact on energy
intake. LCB consumers and NC consumed less energy and non-milk extrinsic sugars than other
groups.
Micronutrient intakes and food choices suggested higher dietary quality in NC/LCB
consumers compared with SSB/BB consumers. Within individuals on different days, consumption
of SSB, milk, juice, and alcohol were all associated with increased energy intake, while LCB and
tea, coffee or water were associated with no change; or reduced energy intake when substituted
for caloric beverages. Results indicate that NC and LCB consumers tend to have higher quality
diets compared with SSB or BB consumers and do not compensate for sugar or energy deficits by
consuming more sugary foods.

1. Introduction
In the latest results from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey [1], 44% by weight of all soft
drinks consumed by adults aged 19–64 years were low-calorie beverages (LCB), a higher proportion
than in other European countries [2]. In the United States, where per capita consumption of beverages
is roughly double that in the UK [3], results of NHANES 2003–2010 showed that LCB constituted
32% of beverages among adults and 19% among children [4]. As a substitute for sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSB), LCB offer the potential to satisfy both thirst and an innate desire for sweetness [5]
with minimal caloric load [6]. Replacing an energy-containing beverage with an energy-free one may
reduce energy intake, depending on the extent of compensation, both short-term and long-term [7–9].
The majority of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) among adults suggest that using LCB instead
of caloric beverages over several weeks or months results in modest weight loss [10–13], although
results vary by age, sex, ethnicity, or weight status groups [14]. Trials in overweight adolescents [15]
and normal weight children [16] have found that replacing SSB with drinks like water or LCB may

prevent weight gain. One adult weight loss trial found greater weight loss with LCB compared to
water [17] and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of ad libitum studies also concluded
that use of low energy sweeteners (LCS) in place of sugar leads to reduced energy intake (EI) and
bodyweight, possibly also when compared with water [18].
While most expert committees advise reduced consumption of SSB to reduce energy
intake [19,20], they vary in advice about substituting with LCB. One reason may be a fear that LCB
may encourage compensatory overeating of sweet foods or foods lower in nutrients. The impact
on dietary quality should be included in assessing the overall balance of benefits and risks for LCS
and LCB [21], but data are limited.
In a review of the impact of LCS on weight management,
Anderson et al. found that users of LCB or LCS reported higher quality diets than non-users [22],
although not all studies were consistent. Using NHANES data from 1999 to 2008, Drewnowski and
Rehm found that consumers of LCS, were more likely to be female, white, older, and of higher
socio-economic status, to be non-smokers and more physically active than non-consumers of LCS,
suggesting that LCS consumption is a marker for a healthy diet and lifestyle [23]. Moreover, users of
LCB as well as LCS had significantly higher quality diets than non-users.
The effect of LCB on diet quality will depend on the way such beverages are used in the context
of the overall diet. In order to target policy and advice appropriately there is a need to explore the
dietary composition of those who drink LCB, SSB or no soft drinks. The NDNS rolling programme,
with recent data from a representative sample of the UK population, provides an opportunity to
conduct such a study. A novel aspect of our paper is the use of 4 days of data for within-person
analysis of beverage consumption and energy intake.
2. Methods
2.1. Sample
The NDNS is the most authoritative source of quantitative information on the food habits and
nutrient intake of the UK population.
Jointly funded by the Department of Health in England
(now Public Health England) and the Food Standards Agency, the results are used by Government
to develop policy and monitor trends in diet and nutrient intakes [1].
Data files from 3 years
(2008–2011) of the NDNS Rolling Programme [24] were obtained under license from the UK Data
Archive (http://www.esds.ac.uk). Households were sampled from the UK Postcode Address File,
with one adult and one child (18 months or older), or one child selected for inclusion.
2.2. Interview
Participants completed a detailed computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) to obtain
background information (age, gender, ethnicity, region) and eating and lifestyle behaviours such
as smoking, dieting to lose weight, medication and supplement use. Education was classified into
eight categories, consolidated into two groups for analysis (any qualifications vs. none). Participants
were also classified by employment status:
full or part-time employment, school or college
full-time, or not working at present. Their National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC)
was determined, based on occupation and degree of supervisory responsibility (8 categories),
consolidated into four categories for analysis:
(a) Higher professional/managerial; (b) Lower
professional/managerial; (c) Intermediate/small employer; and (d) Routine/manual/not working.
Information was also collected on household income band.
2.3. Diet Record
Following the questionnaire respondents were asked to complete a dietary record for
4 consecutive days, giving a detailed description of each item consumed, time of consumption, and
amount, using household measures and photographs. Repeat visits were made by interviewers to
check records and probe for missing items. Fifty-five percent of those eligible to participate completed
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 9
3 of 15
at least 3 days of the 4 days of dietary assessment. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height,
waist circumference), taken by trained nurses, were obtained for 90% of those completing a diet
record. Trained diet coders entered the food intake data from completed records using an in-house
dietary assessment system at MRC Human Nutrition Research, DINO (Data In, Nutrients Out) [25]
and using a databank of more than 7000 foods, regularly updated and extended for the survey.
Volumes of tea, coffee and concentrated soft drinks included water added as diluent. In NDNS files,
tea and coffee excluded contribution from milk and sugar (except for premixed tea and coffee from
takeaway/vending sources). Milk was listed separately, while discretionary sugar was treated as a
food. Nutrients were calculated using the food composition databank. Sugars (nutrient) are defined
in NDNS as total sugars and also as non-milk extrinsic sugars; the latter includes all sugars added by
the consumer or in processing plus sugars in fruit juice and 50% of sugars in dried and processed fruit.
2.4. Classification of Beverages
Beverages were classified as:
1.
Low calorie beverages (LCB): all low- and no-calorie beverages, carbonated and still, ready to
drink and diluted (weight of added water included). Excludes water.
2.
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB): beverages with a range of sugar contents, carbonated and
still, ready to drink and diluted (weight of added water included).
3.
100% fruit juices (FJ), not including fruit drinks.
4.
Tea, coffee and water (TCW), excluding added milk (unless takeaway/vending beverage).
5.
Milk: all liquid milk, including that added to hot beverages.
6.
Alcoholic beverages: beer, cider, wine, spirits, alco-pops.
2.5. Classification of Respondents
Adults aged 16 years and over were classified into four groups according to whether or not they
consumed LCB, SSB, both types (BB) or neither (NC) at any time over the 4 days of survey, as shown
in Table 1.

2.6. Statistical Methods
Differences in food and nutrient intake between beverage consumer groups were evaluated
using ANOVA and multiple comparison tests with Bonferroni correction.
In addition, planned
contrasts (based on the null hypothesis that diets of LCB consumers did not differ from others) were
used to compare LCB with each of the other groups for greater power. Homogeneity of variances
between beverage groups was assessed using Levene’s test. Linear models were used to estimate
the mean difference in EI between beverage categories, adjusted for covariates (age, sex, BMI status,
ethnicity, education, social class, income, smoking and dieting practice). Weighting (NDNS variable:
wti_adY12316) was used to adjust for sampling and non-response bias. Variation within individuals
between different days (n = 6328 days) was studied using fixed effects models with individual
identity, day of the week and day number (day 1 to days 4) as fixed effects to evaluate the impact
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 9

on EI of varying consumption of LCB from day to day, using each individual as their own control.
Beverages were entered as linear covariates (g/day). Two types of models were explored: (1) an
unconstrained model of the impact of each beverage on EI if all other beverages and foods were
allowed to vary as they do in practice; and (2) a substitution model of the effect of replacing LCB
with other beverages. All data were analysed using SPSS version22 (IBM Statistics Inc., Portsmouth,
Hants, UK).
3. Results
3.1. Subject Characteristics
Non-consumers (NC) were older than other groups, BB were youngest and there was no
difference in mean age between LCB consumers and SSB consumers (Table 2). There were similar
proportions of men and women in each beverage group. LCB consumers were more likely to be white
(Caucasian) than SSB consumers. NC were least likely to have formal educational qualifications and
were more likely to be non-working/retired. There was no significant difference in socio-economic
classification overall, although a slightly higher proportion of LCB consumers had higher professional
and managerial occupations, compared with those consuming both LCB and SSB (BB). Similarly, there
was no significant difference in household income classification but a slightly higher proportion of
LCB consumers had a household income over £30K compared to SSB consumers. In regard to health
behaviours reported at interview, current smoking habits did not differ but LCB consumers and NC
were more likely to be ex-smokers (p = 0.001), and LCB consumers were most likely to drink some
alcohol (p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of dieting between groups.
LCB consumers had a higher mean BMI compared with SSB consumers (mean 28.4 vs. 26.3 kg/m2;
p < 0.0001) and were more likely to be obese (33% vs. 22%) (p = 0.001).

3.2. Beverage Consumption
Mean consumption of LCB was 297 g/day (LCB group) and of SSB 253 g/day (SSB group), while
consumers of both types drank on average 548 g/day, with almost equal amounts of LCB and SSB
(Table 3). Total fluid intake from beverages (i.e., excluding water in foods) was slightly lower among
NC compared with other groups (mean 1679 g/day vs. >1800 g/day; p = 0.008). NC drank more tea
than SSB and BB, and less alcohol than SSB. There was no significant difference in the consumption
of milk, fruit juice or plain water between the four groups.

3.3. Food Consumption
In terms of food choices, NC appeared to have the most health conscious diets and BB the
least (Table 4). NC ate significantly more fruit and vegetables and fish than SSB or BB, while LCB
consumers had similar intakes to NC, and ate significantly more fruit, vegetables and fish than BB.
BB consumers ate significantly more meat and meat products, chips and white bread than either LCB
or NC. NC ate more high-fibre breakfast cereal and less confectionery than all other groups. There
were fewer significant differences between LCB and SSB consumers although LCB consumers ate
less sugar and jam than SSB. However the total amount of processed sugary foods, excluding drinks,
(i.e., biscuits, cakes, puddings and ice cream, confectionery, sugar and sweet spreads) was similar
across all beverage groups (mean: 72, 71, 79, 75 g/day in NC, LCB consumers, SSB consumers, BB
consumers, respectively; p = 0.37).

Values sharing the same postscript or none are not significantly different (multiple comparison t-test with
Bonferroni correction). Italics denote food subgroups. Planned contrasts of LCB vs. each of the other beverages
as specified a priori. Tests assume equal/unequal variance based on Levene’s test. No significant differences
in consumption of fats, cheese, eggs.
3.4. Energy and Macronutrient Intake
Adults consuming LCB had a mean total energy intake (TEI) identical to NC (1719, SE 21 vs.
1718 kcal/day, SE 42) and significantly lower than SSB consumers (1958 kcal/day SE 29), or BB
(1986 kcal/day, SE 35) (Table 5), with a mean difference of 239 kcal, SE 51 between LCB consumers

and SSB consumers (p < 0.0001). NC and LCB consumers had lower energy intakes from food as well
as from beverages, compared to SSB consumers and consumers of both types (Figure 1). Overall,
approximately 40%–50% of the total energy difference between groups was attributable to foods
rather than beverages. NC and LCB consumers had significantly lower intakes of (non-milk extrinsic)
sugars (both as g/day and % energy) compared with SSB and BB consumers (p < 0.0001) (Table 5).
Intakes of fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were lower on an absolute basis (g/day) (p < 0.01) but not
as a percentage of energy. Protein intakes were higher (as a percentage of energy) in LCB consumers
than any other group.

3.6. Energy Intake: Adjustment for Covariates
Lower energy intakes in LCB and NC (compared with SSB and BB consumers) remained
significant after adjustment for sex, age group, ethnicity, BMI status, dieting, smoking, education,
social class and income (Table 7). There were no significant interactions. Adjusted means for energy
intake were 1620, 1604, 1794, 1846 kcal/day in NC, LCB, SSB and BB consumers, respectively, with a
difference of 190 kcal between LCB consumers and SSB consumers (p < 0.001; Pairwise comparison
test with Bonferroni correction).

Univariate GLM using weighted least squares. B (beta) coefficients are the difference in total energy intake
associated with belonging to each group compared to the reference, after adjustment for all other factors in the
model. There were no significant interactions. Adjusted difference between LCB and SSB = 190 kcal (SE 48)
p = 0.001 with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparison.
3.7. Within- Person Analysis
Table 8 shows the coefficients estimating the impact of consuming 100 g of each beverage on
total energy intake (7.1) energy from beverages (7.2) and food energy (7.3) if all other beverages and
foods are allowed to vary (as they do in practice). Each 100 g of SSB was associated with an energy
difference of +41 kcal (95% CI 33, 49); coefficients for other energetic beverages (milk, fruit juice,
alcoholic beverages) ranged from +31 to +51 kcal. Consumption of LCB was not associated with
any significant change in energy intake (0.6 kcal/100 g (p = 0.89), neither was the coefficient for tea,
coffee and water significantly different from zero (´3 kcal/100 g; p = 0.073). By comparison the
energy density of beverages (kcal/100 g based on total volume consumed) were as follows: LCB = 1;
tea/coffee/water ď1; SSB = 33; FJ = 37; milk = 52; alcoholic beverages = 48.
In Table 9, models 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 are substitution models of the effect on TEI, beverage energy and
food energy, respectively, when replacing LCB with each of the other beverages, whilst keeping other
beverage amounts constant. The coefficients can be compared with the true energy density of the
beverages to estimate compensation, whether positive or negative. Consuming LCB instead of SSB
(with other beverages constant) was associated with a 39 kcal reduction in total energy per 100 g
substituted (8.1: TEI). In 8.2 (beverage energy) the coefficient for SSB (32 kcal/100 g) was similar to
the actual energy density of all SSB consumed (33 kcal/100 g), suggesting weak or no compensation
in beverage energy. 8.3 shows that food energy increased slightly by 7 kcal/100 g when consuming
SSB instead of LCB (or food intake was 7 kcal lower when LCB was consumed); however this was not
significant (p = 0.15).
This analysis suggests that LCB has no independent association with energy or food intake.
Consuming more LCB on any one day does not appear to be associated with a lower energy intake
that day. Strict 1:1 substitution of LCB in place of SSB could save an estimated 32 kcal/100 g (beverage
energy model) assuming no change in intake of food or other beverages. This is equivalent to 106 kcal
for a standard can of soda (330 g).

* Models show estimated caloric changes on consuming 100 g each beverage type instead of 100 g LCB whilst keeping total beverage intake constant (reverse sign applies for
substituting LCB in place of each beverage).

4. Discussion
Our findings do not support the assertion that LCB negatively affect diet because adults who
drink LCB compensate by eating more sugary or fatty foods [26,27].
Sugar intakes were lower
among LCB consumers than SSB consumers owing mainly to the contribution from beverages in
the SSB consumers, and there was no evidence of a reciprocal relationship with fat (or “sugar: fat
see-saw”) [28] between LCB and SSB consumer groups; fat intakes were lower in LCB consumers on
a g/day basis, and percentage energy from fat was not significantly different. Protein intakes (as a
percentage of energy) were higher among LCB consumers than other groups, and the diets of NC and
LCB consumers contained similar amounts of micronutrients for fewer calories than other groups. In
all main respects (energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intakes), the diets of the LCB group were
similar to those who consumed no soft drinks at all (NC), except that total fluid intakes were lower
in NC. Consumption of fruit, vegetables and fish declined across the groups (NC > LCB > SSB >BB)
with the reverse trend for meat; however not all differences were statistically significant. NC were
significantly older than LCB and SSB consumers, while BB consumers were younger. Hence some
of the observed differences may be age-related; for example older people are more likely to achieve
recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption [1].
Our conclusions are similar to those of Drewnowski and Rehm, who reported higher healthy
eating index scores among users of low calorie sweeteners (LCS) and LCB compared with
non-consumers, as well as healthier behaviours such as not smoking and taking more exercise [23].
The counter-intuitive observation in both studies that LCB users are more likely to be overweight
despite a lower reported EI than non-users is most likely attributable to reverse causality [29]. Unlike
Drewnowski and Rehm we did not find LCB consumers to have higher intakes of saturated fat and
sodium. Methodological differences between our studies may explain this: LCB users may include
some participants who consumed SSB in addition to LCB (our BB group), and LCB non-users may
include those who consume neither LCB nor soft drinks (our NC group), whereas our classification
discriminated on both classes of beverage.
Findings contrast with those of Piernas et al. who reported that overall diet quality was lower in
LCB-only consumers as well as in SSB consumers, compared with non/low consumers [30] and also
that purchases of either LCB or SSB were associated with more energy from food, more sugar and
fat and more desserts [27]. An acknowledged limitation of purchase studies is the indirect measure
of consumption and omission of unpackaged foods and out-of-home eating occasions. Furthermore,
stronger evidence (from the CHOICE randomised control trial) indicated that those who replaced
caloric drinks with either LCB or water also reduced their consumption of added sugar and desserts,
with the LCB group sustaining a larger reduction in desserts than the water group [31].
Our within-person results show some similarities with other studies using multiple records
in American populations.
Wang et al.
reported no significant association between LCB intake
and total energy in children when LCB was added to the diet [32]. In models replacing SSB they
only found a significant energy reduction with plain water and not LCB, however low numbers of
children consuming diet drinks may have limited the statistical power. Stookey et al., in a study
of 118 overweight women followed up for 12 months, reported that replacing SSBs by LCBs was
associated with a reduction in energy intake but this was 30% smaller than if replaced by water [33].
Finally in a recent study using within-person data (2 days) from NHANES, consuming SSB was
associated with an energy increment of 226 kcal/day, compared with 69 kcal associated with LCB
(net difference of 157 kcal/day) [34]. Although there was a small increase in food calories this did
not negate the energy saving associated with consuming LCB instead of SSB. From within-person
analysis of NDNS, we found that substitution of SSB by LCB or by water/tea/coffee was associated
with a reduction in total energy, and this was attributable to lower energy from beverages, with no
evidence of increased food energy.

Strengths and Limitations of the Present Study
Most work on the effects of beverages on intakes and on health focuses on the adverse impacts of
SSB, while less has addressed potential benefits of LCB. A major strength of this study is the NDNS
data, which is nationally representative of the UK and of high quality. The 4-day diary provides a
better representation of usual consumption than the more common 24-h dietary recall. Four days of
records also allowed us to estimate the impact of dietary change on energy intake whilst controlling
for inter-personal differences.
Causality cannot be inferred from the associations found in this analysis due to its cross-sectional
design.
However, the results are consistent with other data suggesting that beverages tend to
supplement food choices in an independent manner, so that the benefit of LCB in terms of energy and
sugars intake derives from substitution of SSB. Misreporting is a known weakness of self–reported
diet records [35] and unfortunately there is no reliable means of correcting for this or reliably
identifying individuals who misreport [36].
However, our conclusions regarding lower NMES
intakes are based on energy-adjusted values, less susceptible to misreporting effects [37,38].
In
energy intake regressions we included an adjustment for dieting, smoking, BMI and other covariates
often associated with energy intake or underreporting, although residual confounding can never be
ruled out. The within-person analysis further reduces distortions caused by mis-reporting because
individuals tend to be consistent in this regard [39].
5. Conclusions
LCB provide a palatable source of water with minimal sugar and energy content. Their caloric
benefits derive from their role as substitutes for SSB and meta-analyses have demonstrated that
replacing SSB with LCB leads to reduced energy intake and modest weight loss [18]. Maintaining
good diet quality during weight loss is important in order to meet nutrient requirements at a lower
energy intake. In UK adults we found that LCB consumers and NC consumed less energy and sugars
than consumers of SSB, or both types. NC and LCB consumers tended to have higher quality diets
compared with SSB and BB consumers and did not compensate for the sugar or energy deficit by
consuming more sugary foods.
