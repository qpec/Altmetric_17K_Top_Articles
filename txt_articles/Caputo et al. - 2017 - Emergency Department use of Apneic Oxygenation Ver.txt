ABSTRACT
Objectives: Desaturation leading to hypoxemia may occur during rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Apneic
oxygenation (AO) was developed to prevent the occurrence of oxygen desaturation during the apnea period. The
purpose of this study was to determine if the application of AO increases the average lowest oxygen saturation
during RSI when compared to usual care (UC) in the emergency setting.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at an academic, urban, Level I trauma center. All
patients requiring intubation were included. Exclusion criteria were patients in cardiac or traumatic arrest or if
preoxygenation was not performed. An observer, blinded to study outcomes and who was not involved in the
procedure, recorded all times, while all saturations were recorded in real time by monitors on a secured server.
Two-hundred patients were allocated to receive AO (n = 100) or UC (n = 100) by predetermined randomization in
a 1:1 ratio.
Results: A total of 206 patients were enrolled. There was no difference in lowest mean oxygen saturation between
the two groups (92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 91 to 93 in AO vs. 93, 95% CI = 92 to 94 in UC; p = 0.11).
Conclusion: There was no difference in lowest mean oxygen saturation between the two groups. The
application of AO during RSI did not prevent desaturation of patients in this study population.

ypoxia may occur during emergent endotracheal
intubation of patients.1–4 Hypoxia, in general, is a
condition that may increase the risk of patients suffering
from cardiac arrest. An important part of rapid
sequence intubation (RSI) is preoxygenation, which is
defined as placing the patient on supplemental oxygen
with a goal of administering 100% FiO2 for 3 minutes
prior to administering the induction agent and paralytic
(i.e., sedative and neuromuscular blocker [NMB]) to
increase the amount of oxygen present in the functional
residual capacity of the patients lungs to prolong the
maintenance of acceptable oxygen saturation during the
apneic period of endotracheal intubation.5–8 In the past
decade, physicians have developed a technique known
as apneic oxygenation (AO), which is theorized to pre-
vent the occurrence of desaturation during the apneic
period. The process entails leaving the patient on nasal
cannula (NC) oxygen during the act of visualizing the
vocal cords and placing the endotracheal tube.8,9 The
practice has become increasingly utilized in emergency
and critical care departments in the United States and
Australia.10–15 A recent randomized controlled trial
(The FELLOW Trial) demonstrated no difference in
desaturation rates between those patients that received
AO and those that did not (usual practice) in patients
in the intensive care unit.10 AO has been retrospectively
and prospectively studied in prehospital, emergency
department (ED), critical care, and operating room set-
tings, and these studies refute the results of the FEL-
LOW Trial.11–15
Although studies have begun investigate the efficacy
of AO in preventing desaturation during RSI, ran-
domized controlled trial evidence is still lacking in the
ED patient population. Therefore, acquiring a further
understanding of the implications of this technique on
patient care by performing a randomized controlled
trial can help clarify its place in RSI.
The primary outcome of this investigation was to
determine if the use of AO increases the average low-
est oxygen saturation during RSI when compared to
usual care (UC). We also sought to determine if the
use of AO not only increased first pass success rates,
but decreased the rates of desaturation, time to desatu-
ration, and mortality.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
A randomized controlled trial was conducted at an
urban, academic, Level I trauma center in New York
City. The annual census of the ED is approximately
175,000 patients. The department performs approxi-
mately
450
intubations
a
year.
This
study
was
approved with waiver of consent by the institutional
review board. Waiver was obtained as the intervention
was deemed to be minimal risk and every patient was
receiving standard of care RSI regardless of group
allotment. This study was registered with ClinicalTri-
als.gov (NCT02737917).
Selection of Participants
Any adult patient (age > 18 years old) presenting to the
ED requiring endotracheal intubation was screened for
inclusion into the study. Patients were excluded from
the study if they were not preoxygenated to the standard
RSI protocol of a goal of 3 minutes with 100% FiO2 by
means of BVM, BiPAP, and/or NRB; if they were in
cardiac or traumatic arrest; or if they were intubated
without an apneic period (i.e., awake intubation).
Patients who did not undergo preoxygenation were
excluded to avoid a potential confounding variable.
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1
ratio to receive AO (intervention) or UC (control).
The sequence of study group assignments was gener-
ated via a computerized algorithm using permuted
blocks of 4, 8, and 12.16 Study group assignments
were placed in a secured binder and sequentially num-
bered in opaque envelopes. The data collectors were
blinded to our study design and outcome, and we feel
that no bias was introduced by the use of these
trained data collectors.
Interventions
All adult patients undergoing endotracheal intubation
in the ED were randomized to receive supplemental
oxygen via NC; CareFusion AirLife) and NC EtCO2
(Phillips, Smart Capnoline), both at flush flow rates
≥15 LPM (providing intra and extra nasal oxygen) dur-
ing laryngoscopy (AO) or no supplemental oxygen dur-
ing laryngoscopy (UC). All patients received standard of
care for endotracheal intubation that is RSI. An inter-
nally validated intubation checklist was used on all intu-
bations. Choice of preoxygenation technique (flush flow
rate NRB vs. BiPAP vs. BVM), RSI medications and
technique (video vs. direct laryngoscopy) was left to the
discretion of the attending physician caring for the
patient. Preoxygenation was conducted with flush flow
rate NRB, with BVM connected to 100% oxygen wall
supply, or with BiPAP on 100% FiO2. Patients on
BiPAP
or
BVM

 administration of induction agents. A jaw thrust was
given to patients after administration of induction
agents and prior to laryngoscopy. Patients randomized
to receive AO had the NC oxygen started with the initia-
tion of preoxygenation.
Methods and Measurements
To minimize observer bias, data collection during intu-
bation
was
performed
by
independent
observers
(research assistants, nurses, and residents) who under-
went training for data collection and were not directly
involved in the performance of the procedure. The
observers used a data collection tool to collect data in
real time (see Data Supplement S1, available as sup-
porting information in the online version of this
paper, which is available at https://doi.org/onlinelibra
ry.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.13274/full,
for
data
collection sheet). Vital signs were obtained from the
patient’s monitor (Philips Intellivue), which is trans-
mitted to a central monitoring system that can be
accessed to print out timed reports. The time of O2
saturations and the saturations themselves were col-
lected and written down on the data collection sheet
and then reconciled with the centrally stored monitor
data to confirm accuracy. Apnea time was defined as
time from first look (defined as insertion of the laryn-
goscope blade into the patients mouth) to confirma-
tion of endotracheal tube placement by waveform
capnography (EtCO2). Insertion of blade into the
patients mouth was used as the starting point for
apnea time instead of administration of NMB because
this is the most distinct sign that the patient is para-
lyzed (i.e., it would be difficult to determine the exact
onset of paralysis after administration of the NMB
before the initiation of the first look). Intubation
attempts (number of times the patient had the endotra-
cheal tube placed in their mouth) were counted for
each patient. In those patients where first pass failed
and subsequent attempts were made without assisted
ventilation, the apnea time was defined as above. In
those attempts where first-pass intubation failed and
the patient was ventilated prior to subsequent attempt
(i.e., the laryngoscope was taken out of the mouth and
the patient ventilated), the apnea time was defined as
time of first look to time of assisted ventilation. To
confirm the accuracy of data collected by the indepen-
dent observers, the primary investigators conducted a
concurrent assessment of the same outcomes for a
convenience sample of the first 20 consecutively
enrolled patients (10% of study intubations).
Subjective assessments of Cormack-Lehane grade of
view, difficulty of intubation, and airway complications
during the procedure were self-reported by the opera-
tor to the observer for recording on the data collection
tool. All other data on baseline characteristics, pre-
and post-laryngoscopy management, and clinical out-
comes were collected from the medical record by study
personnel.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the average lowest oxygen
saturation recorded during the apnea period or in the
2 minutes after. The secondary outcomes were to
determine the difference, if any, in rates of first-pass
success, desaturation below SpO2 90%, and desatura-
tion below SpO2 80%. The final endpoint was to
determine the difference, if any, of the average time to
desaturation between the two groups.
Data Analysis
Based on a previous study of desaturation during RSI
by the FELLOW trial, which demonstrated a differ-
ence of the median lowest arterial saturation of 2%
between the intervention and control group, and not
knowing whether our data set would be abnormally
distributed; we calculated a Cohen’s d statistic of 0.4
for moderate effect size to detect a difference in oxygen
saturation of 5% in our study.10 With this, an enroll-
ment of 200 patients (100 in each arm) provided a
80% statistical power (at a two-sided alpha level of
0.05) to detect a moderate difference between groups
for the primary outcome.
Continuous variables were reported as mean with
95%
confidence
interval
[CI]
or
median
with
interquartile
range, and categorical variables were
reported as frequencies and proportions. Between-
group differences were analyzed with the Student’s
t-tests for continuous variables and Mann-Whitney
rank
sum
tests
for
ordinal
and
nonnormally
distributed continuous variables.
The primary analysis was a comparison of patients
randomized to AO versus UC with regard to the pri-
mary outcome of lowest arterial oxygen saturation. A
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed on saturation at different time intervals to
determine if there was a difference between the treat-
ment group and control group over time. A two-
sided p-value of less than 0.05 and 95% CIs are
reported. All analyses were performed using XLStat
(Addinsoft).

 RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Subjects
A total of 206 (79%) patients were enrolled out of a pos-
sible 262 during the study period between May and
December of 2016. Figure 1 demonstrates the enroll-
ment flow of the patients. Six patients received the
wrong intervention early in the study period (two
patients assigned to the UC group received AO, and
four patients assigned to the AO group received UC),
but were excluded from the analysis because data collec-
tion was incomplete as the observers stopped recording.
The remaining 56 patients were excluded per criteria.
Baseline demographics of the two groups were simi-
lar in all instances (see Table 1). Patients were intu-
bated a majority of the time in both groups for
primary pulmonary etiologies (Table 1). There was no
difference in operator experience between the groups
(Table 1). There was a kappa of 0.9 � 1.6 for agree-
ment between the observers for the first 10% of cases
enrolled for observer quality assurance.
Main Results
There was no difference in lowest average oxygen satura-
tion during the periprocedural period (Table 2). Fig-
ure 2 demonstrates the average SpO2 and successful
intubations over time. The repeated-measures ANOVA
demonstrated no difference overtime between the
groups (see Table 2, Mauchly’s statistic 0.08, Huynt-
Feldt Epsilon 0.58, between-group effect p = 0.1). Over
70% of patients were successfully intubated by 60 sec-
onds, 80% by 80 seconds, 90% by 100 seconds, and
100% by 195 seconds. There was a subgroup of

 patients with prolonged apnea times (>130 seconds)
that did not desaturate to an average SpO2 less than 90
(n = 22). There was no difference in oxygen saturation
between the groups at any of these time intervals. First-
pass intubation success was not obtained in 22 patients.
Fifteen patients in this group had multiple subsequent
attempts made without assisted ventilation between
attempts. Interestingly, all 15 patients had prolonged
apnea times (mean = 144 seconds) without desatura-
tion and indications for intubation were for etiologies
other than pulmonary.
DISCUSSION
In this first randomized controlled trial investigating
the use of AO during the intubation of ED patients,
we found that the application of AO offered no bene-
fit in terms of preventing desaturation, increasing the
time to desaturation, or the lowest mean oxygen satu-
ration. The demographics of our patient population
and of the physicians who performed the intubations,
as well as the first-pass success rates, are similar to
other reported studies.17,18 The indications for intuba-
tion, mainly pulmonary, were also similar to other
studies.19 We found similar results of desaturation as
has been previously reported with about one in four
patients desaturating (defined as SpO2 < 93% in a
recent cross-sectional study utilizing continuous vital
signs during the peri-intubation period).20 The results
of the primary outcome are similar to the FELLOW
trial, the only other randomized controlled trial of sim-
ilar size. This study is different from the FELLOW

 trial in that all patients received preoxygenation to
accepted standards to minimize impact of failure to
denitrogenate the lungs on apnea time and control for
this confounding variable, which affects periprocedural
desaturation rates.
Previous studies on the use of AO in the prehospi-
tal and ED settings have been retrospective or observa-
tional.13–15 These studies used self-reporting by the
intubating physician, and we chose to use real-time
data collection by trained independent observers to
eliminate
the
underestimation
of
periprocedural
adverse events. Furthermore, our limited exclusion cri-
teria prior to randomization support the generalizabil-
ity of our findings to any ED patient who can be
adequately preoxygenated for the standard of care
(RSI) for ED patients requiring intubation.
The fact that no difference was found between the
two groups does not mean that the application of
apneic oxygen does not work, especially for patients
with prolonged apnea times. As this was a real-world
application of potentially therapeutic supplemental oxy-
genation during the apneic period, deliberately pro-
longing apnea time would be unethical, and patients
were intubated with the shortest achievable apnea
time. The majority of patients were intubated with low
C-L graded views within 1 minute after confirmation
of apnea, and since all patients received proper preoxy-
genation, this study demonstrates that AO may not be
useful in the majority of patients that can be fully pre-
oxygenated and intubated in a reasonable amount of
time. Our results also demonstrate that patients may
not suffer a precipitous a drop in oxygen saturation as
was previously thought.8,9,20 This is further supported
by our results that showed no difference in rates of
moderate (SpO2 < 90) or severe (SpO2 < 80%) desatu-
ration between the two groups. This is an important
point because it remains unknown whether apneic
oxygen
could
benefit

 intubations which preclude preoxygenation with a goal
of an FiO2 of 100% for 3 minutes. As stated earlier,
there was a subgroup of patients with prolonged
apnea times (>130 seconds) that did not desaturate to
an average SpO2 less than 90 (n = 22). Seven of these
patients received assisted ventilations to be resaturated
before subsequent attempt. In those 15 patients that
did not receive assisted ventilations and had multiple
attempts causing apnea times greater than 2 minutes,
it remains unclear whether their ability to maintain
their oxygenation was a function of the preoxygena-
tion, the lack of pulmonary indication for intubation,
or a combination of both.14 It also remains unclear
how these patients age, metabolic rates, whether they
were obesity or severity of their underlying illness
impacted on this as well.
LIMITATIONS
There are several limitations to this study. First, we uti-
lized a real-time data collection form for most of our
study outcomes as self-reporting by emergency provi-
ders has been shown to underestimate adverse events
and the time to intubation.20 Furthermore, because
this was a single-center study at an academic ED with
a residency training program, our results may not be
generalizable to nonacademic centers.
CONCLUSION
In summary, this study demonstrated that in patients
that are properly preoxygenated during rapid sequence
intubation in the ED, the application of apneic oxy-
genation did not lead to any differences in lowest
mean oxygen saturation, desaturation rates between
the two groups, or intubation success without hypox-
emia. The application of apneic oxygenation during
rapid sequence intubation did not prevent oxygen
desaturation of patients in the ED who could be pre-
oxygenated appropriately. In light of these findings,
apneic oxygenation may be used on all patients requir-
ing rapid sequence intubation in the ED but with the
understanding that it likely has little no impact on
patient desaturation rates.
