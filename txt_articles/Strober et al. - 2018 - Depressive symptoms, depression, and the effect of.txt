 Methods: We defined a study population within the Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry and
measured the incidence of depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression ScaleeDepression
score $8) and adverse events (AEs) of depression within cohorts receiving biologics, conventional
systemic therapies, or phototherapy. Patients were evaluated at approximately 6-month intervals.
Multivariate modeling determined the impact of treatment on risk.
Results: The incidence rates of depressive symptoms were 3.01 per 100 patient-years (PYs) (95%
confidence interval [CI], 2.73-3.32), 5.85 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 4.29-7.97), and 5.70 per 100 PYs (95% CI,
4.58-7.10)
for
biologics,
phototherapy,
and
conventional
therapy,
respectively.
Compared
with
conventional therapy, biologics reduced the risk for depressive symptoms (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.59-0.98), whereas phototherapy did not (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.71-1.54). The incidence rates for
AEs of depression were 0.21 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 0.15-0.31) for biologics, 0.55 per 100 PYs (95% CI,
0.21-1.47) for phototherapy, and 0.14 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 0.03-0.55) for conventional therapy; the fact that
there were too few events (37 AEs) precluded modeling.
Limitations: Incomplete capture of depression and confounders in the patients on registry.
Conclusion: Compared with conventional therapy, biologics appear to be associated with a lower
incidence of depressive symptoms among patients with psoriasis. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2018;78:70-80.)

Several studies have documented an increased
risk for depression and suici-
dality among patients with
psoriasis.
Cross-sectional
studies with relatively small
sample sizes have noted a
high prevalence of depres-
sion ([60%) and suicidality
([7%) among patients with
psoriasis.1,2 A large cohort
study
in
the
General
Practice Research Database
found an increased risk for
depression,
anxiety,
and
suicidality
among
patients
with
psoriasis;
depression
and suicidality risks were
higher
for
patients
with
severe
disease.3
Another
large cohort analysis, using
data from the Nurses’ Health Study, found an
increased
risk for depression
in women with
psoriasis
and
psoriatic
arthritis.4
A
recent
meta-analysis reported similar findings, indicating
that patients with psoriasis were at least 1.5 times
more likely to experience depression than patients
without psoriasis.5
Depressive
symptoms,
as
opposed
to
depression, are assessed by the Hospital Anxiety
and
Depression
ScaleeDepression
(HADS-D)
(Table I). Data from clinical trials support a reduction
in depressive symptoms with psoriasis treatment.
In
the
pivotal
clinical
trials
for
adalimumab,
etanercept, ustekinumab, and infliximab, depressive
symptoms were decreased.6-10 However, beyond
clinical
trials,
there
is
a
paucity of well-controlled or
real-world data addressing
the effect of systemic therapy
on
comorbid
depression
and suicidality among pa-
tients with psoriasis. Herein
we report findings on the
prevalence, incidence, and
impact of systemic therapy
on
comorbid
depression
and
depressive
symptoms
among patients in Psoriasis
Longitudinal Assessment and
Registry (PSOLAR).11
METHODS
Study design
A
full
description
of
PSOLAR
has
been
reported
previously.11,12
Briefly, PSOLAR is a prospective, longitudinal,
disease-based
registry
designed
to
collect
safety, efficacy, and health outcomes data from
approximately 12,000 patients with psoriasis in
16 countries who are receiving, or are eligible
to receive, conventional systemic or biologic
therapies. All patients provided written informed
consent before the start of the study, and an
institutional review board or ethics committee
approved the registry protocol at participating
sites. This cohort analysis used data obtained
through August 23, 2015.
CAPSULE SUMMARY
d Patients with psoriasis have an increased
risk for depression/suicidality.
d Biologic agents for psoriasis were
associated with a decreased incidence of
depressive symptoms versus
conventional systemic therapies in the
real-world Psoriasis Longitudinal
Assessment and Registry.
d Further exploration of the relationship
between biologics and depression
among patients with psoriasis is
warranted to optimize treatment
management.

 Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis were
to
calculate
the
prevalence
and
incidence
of
depression
and
symptoms
suggestive
of
depression
among
PSOLAR
patients
with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis and to assess the
effect of systemic treatment on the risk for
development
of
these
outcomes.
Symptoms
suggestive of depression were evaluated using
the HADS-D (Table I).13 Incidence of depression
was based on reports of adverse events (AEs) of
depression.
An
additional
objective
was
to
describe suicidality, including completed suicide,
suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation.
Cohorts, exposures, outcomes, and statistical
methods
To
study
the
incidence
of
depression
and
symptoms of depression,
the study
population
was defined by using the following criteria: no
medical history of depression, a HADS-D score lower
than 8 at baseline, and exposure to only 1 study
therapy
(ie,
monotherapy).
Exposure
cohorts
were defined as patients treated with (1) biologics
(etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, and ustekinu-
mab), (2) phototherapy (including ultraviolet B
and psoralens plus ultraviolet A light), or (3) conven-
tional
systemic
agents
(including
methotrexate,
cyclosporine, systemic corticosteroids, fumarates,
mycophenolate mofetil, and oral retinoids).
Exposure started at the date of the first dose of a
cohort-defining therapy on registry (or at enrollment
for those who entered the registry while undergoing
therapy)
and
ended
at
the
date
of
the
last
cohort-defining therapy dose, the date of switching
to
a
different
therapy,
discontinuation
from
the registry, data extraction (August 23, 2015), or
death. Outcomes included symptoms suggestive of
depression (HADS-D score $8) and an AE of
depression (according to the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory
Activities
[MedDRA],
version
17.1,
Standardized
MedDRA
Queries
for
Depression
and
Suicide/Self-injury).
These
outcomes
were
considered separately, and patients were followed
only until the first occurrence of either outcome.
HADS-D data were to be collected at baseline, every
6 months for the next 18 months, and every
12 months thereafter. AEs were to be collected every
6 months; depression was considered an AE of
special interest and subjected to enhanced reporting
efforts. Suicidality was assessed on the basis of
reporting of terms from the Suicide/Self-injury
Standardized
MedDRA
Query;
individual
cases
were
classified
as
completed
suicide,
suicide
attempt, or suicidal ideation.
Incidence
rates
(IRs)
were
calculated
for
depressive symptoms (an initial HADS-D score $8)
or AE of depression for each of the 3 cohorts
(combined biologics, phototherapy, or conventional
systemic therapy) and for each individual biologic
agent. Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to estimate risk on the basis of time to first
outcome for each of the treatment cohorts after
adjustment
for
a
predefined
list
of
potential
confounders as discussed in the Results. Each
covariate was independently tested for association
with each outcome (univariate P value \ .20) and
included in the final model if an association was
confirmed. Hazard ratios (HRs), confidence intervals
(CIs), and P values (based on a Wald x2 test) were
calculated independently for the combined biologics
and phototherapy cohorts versus the conventional
therapy reference cohort. Each biologic was also
separately compared with the conventional therapy
reference
cohort.
To
evaluate
their
potential
confounding effect, a post hoc analysis excluding
patients with concomitant oral retinoid (acitretin and
etretinate) use from the conventional systemics
cohort was conducted. Missing values for covariates
were imputed (ie, means for continuous factors and
medians for categoric factors).
RESULTS
The demographic and clinical characteristics of
the 7490 patients in the study population (Table II)
were generally similar to those of the overall PSOLAR
population
(data
not
shown).
The
following
characteristics were enriched among patients who
developed
symptoms
suggestive
of
depression

 education level, and public insurance. Among
patients who reported an AE of depression, the
following characteristics were enriched: psychiatric
comorbidities (anxiety), lower education level, pri-
vate insurance, current/past smoking, and less se-
vere psoriasis as assessed by body surface area and
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA).
Incidence of depression
A total of 532 study patients developed symptoms
suggestive
of
depression
(HADS-D
score
$8
[Table III]). The IR was lower for the biologics cohort
(IR,
3.01;
95%
CI,
2.73-3.32)
than
for
the
phototherapy cohort (IR, 5.85; 95% CI, 4.29-7.97)
and the conventional systemic cohort (IR, 5.70; 95%
CI, 4.58-7.10). The IRs for the individual biologic
therapy cohorts (ustekinumab, infliximab, etaner-
cept, and adalimumab) were similar to those for the
overall biologic cohort and lower than those for the
phototherapy and conventional systemic cohorts.
A total of 37 AEs of depression were reported in
the study population (Table IV). The IRs for the
biologic (IR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.15-0.31), phototherapy
(IR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.21-1.47), and conventional
systemic agent cohorts (IR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.55)
were lower than those for depressive symptoms. The
IRs of AEs of depression were similar among groups;
however, the analysis was limited by the low
numbers of events and the wide CIs.
Factors predictive of symptoms suggestive of
depression
On the basis of the Cox model, treatment with
biologics reduced the risk for depressive symptoms
(HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59e0.98) compared with
conventional systemic therapy, whereas photo-
therapy did not affect risk (HR, 1.05; 95% CI,
0.71-1.54])
(Table
V).
Among
the
individual
biologics, only adalimumab significantly lowered
the risk for depressive symptoms (HR, 0.63; 95%
CI, 0.46-0.86). Ustekinumab and infliximab did not
lower risk, but the upper limits of the CIs were only
slightly higher than 1.00 (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60e1.06
and HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47-1.03, respectively).
Etanercept did not appear to lower risk (HR, 0.91;
95% CI, 0.67-1.23). Given that oral retinoids have
been associated with depressive symptoms and
depression,14 we conducted a sensitivity analysis
excluding patients with concomitant retinoid use
from all cohorts. The results of the primary analysis
were
minimally
affected.
Although
combined
biologics treatment was no longer associated with
reduced risk for depressive symptoms (HR, 0.77; 95%
CI, 0.58-1.00; P = .0542 [data not shown]), the point
estimate and CI were very similar to those in the
primary analysis (HR, 0.76 and 95% CI, 0.59-0.98,
respectively). Furthermore, the reduced risk for
depressive symptoms with adalimumab treatment
persisted (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87; P = .0053 [data
not
shown]).
Factors
that
increased
risk
for
depressive
symptoms
included
increasing
age,
nonwhite race, history of anxiety, psoriatic arthritis,
higher baseline PGA score, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Factors that decreased the risk
included the following: having a college/university
education; increasing years since psoriasis began;
having a decreased, stable, or 1-point or less increase
in PGA; and having private insurance. The low
numbers of events precluded Cox modeling of the
AEs of depression.
Suicidality
A total of 21 patients in the overall PSOLAR
population completed suicide, attempted suicide, or
experienced suicidal ideation (IR, 43.0 per 100,000
patient-years [PYs]) (Table VI). Of note, not all of
these patients met the inclusion criteria for the study
population in the analysis of IRs and HRs reported
earlier. Of these 21 patients, 3 completed suicide (IR,
6.1 per 100,000 PYs), 8 attempted suicide, and 10
experienced suicidal ideation (Table VI). All 3 patients
who completed suicide were male; 1 patient was
being treated with ustekinumab at the time of suicide
(within 91 days) and 1 each had been treated
previously
with
ustekinumab
and
adalimumab,
etanercept, or alefacept, respectively (see Table VI
for additional details). Of the 8 patients who
attempted suicide, 3 were receiving etanercept, 2
infliximab, and 1 adalimumab and 2 were not
receiving any systemic psoriatic treatment at the
time of the event. All but 1 of the patients who
attempted suicide had previously received biologics.
Of
the
10
patients
with
suicidal
ideation,
5
were receiving ustekinumab, 2 etanercept, and 1
adalimumab and 2 were not receiving any treatment
at the time of the event. All patients who experienced
suicidal ideation had previously received biologic
therapy.
DISCUSSION
Our
study
indicates
that,
compared
with
conventional systemic therapy, biologic therapy is
associated with a decreased risk for development
of
depressive
symptoms
among
patients
with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Of the biologics exam-
ined, adalimumab had the strongest association with

 lower risk, with the findings for ustekinumab and
infliximab trending toward lower risk but not
achieving statistical significance. We were unable to
assess risk for AEs of depression on account of the
low number of events.
In addition, socioeconomic factors appeared to be
important considerations. The modeled analysis
showed that having achieved a higher level of
education
appears
to
reduce
the
risk
for
development of depressive symptoms, as has been
demonstrated in other studies.15,16 Having private
insurance also decreased the risk for development of
depressive symptoms in our analysis.
Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the
HADS-D instrument (Table I). The sensitivity and
specificity of this instrument for capturing true
depression is estimated at around 0.8 when a cutoff
score of 8 or higher is used. However, the HADS-D
has not been validated in psoriasis, and it is
important to note that responses to some of the
questions may reflect aspects of psoriasis rather than
frank depression.
Given the relatively high incidence of depressive
symptoms (occurring in 532 patients), it is surprising
that relatively few patients reported an AE of
depression (37 events). There are several possible
explanations
for
this
discrepancy,
including
potential
under-reporting
or
underdiagnosis
of
depression, the impact of treatment on depression,
and elements of the study design. In particular,
patients
were
followed
only
until
their
first
occurrence of either depressive symptoms or AE of
depression.
Some
patients
who
developed
depressive symptoms may have progressed to also
have an AE of depression; however, the latter would
not have been captured in this analysis. In addition,
clinical depression may be underdiagnosed or
under-reported in a dermatology setting. PSOLAR
does not capture whether patients with elevated
HADS-D scores were specifically evaluated for
depression by a mental health specialist or primary
care provider. An earlier review noted that the
2-question Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (‘‘Over
the past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or
hopeless?’’ and ‘‘Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt
little interest or pleasure in doing things?’’) may be as
effective as more complex tools for depression
screening.17
A
simple,
practical
approach
for
depression screening may be more feasible than
use of the HADS-D instrument in an outpatient
dermatology setting and may promote appropriate
referrals for patients at risk.
Despite possible confounding factors or study
design, it is possible that biologic therapy reduces
the risk for frank depression in patients with
psoriasis. We were unable to model this risk on
account of the low numbers of AEs of depression.
Two potential reasons could explain why biologics
may reduce these risks. First, dysregulated systemic
inflammation may promote depression.18 Cytokines
can access the central nervous system and elevated
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels have been
detected in the serum of patients with depression.19
Consequently,
neutralization
of
inflammatory
mediators
that
are
common
to
psoriasis
and
depression could alleviate depressive symptoms
and prevent progression to depression. Second,
various
psychosocial
factors
associated
with
psoriasis may promote depression. For example,
the visibility of psoriasis lesions may lead to social
stigmatization.20 Furthermore, the overall impact of
psoriasis on health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
has been shown to be similar to that of other
major chronic illnesses.21 Thus, improvement in
psoriasis
may
be
expected
to
enhance
social
functioning and HRQoL, which may in turn reduce
risk for development of depressive symptoms and
depression.
Our data are in line with the data from pivotal
clinical trials for etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab,
and ustekinumab, which show improvement of
depressive
symptoms
with
treatment.

include
longer
duration
of
follow-up,
a
representative

population, and an observational real-world setting
design. Weaknesses include the following: the
inherent limitations of the HADS-D instrument, as
noted earlier; patient self-reporting of AEs of
depression;
possible
inadequate
capture
of
depressive events; and lack of data regarding alcohol
consumption
and
other
medications
(such
as
antidepressants). Of note, although oral retinoids
have been associated with depression, the results of
a sensitivity analysis provided evidence against
confounding by retinoid use. In addition, there are
biases inherent to the longitudinal cohort design,
such as the inability to account for all baseline
differences
between
cohorts
that
might
affect
outcome. Lastly, smaller sample sizes may limit the
ability to interpret some analyses, (eg, the post hoc
analysis
excluding
patients
with
concomitant
retinoid use).
We also presented a descriptive analysis of
suicidality among patients enrolled in PSOLAR.
Overall, the IR of suicidal ideation, attempted
suicide, or completed suicide was low (43.0 per
100,000 PYs). Although it is difficult to directly
compare this rate with other published data, the

 suicide rate among patients with psoriasis in the
General Practice Research Database was 90 per
100,000 PYs.3
Although biologic therapies have been associated
with a low risk for suicidality,22 an imbalance in
suicide and suicidal ideation has been previously
observed among patients treated with an interleukin
17 receptor inhibitor.23 It is important to note that
causality remains uncertain22 and differences in
study design could be contributing to the perceived
imbalance. Our studies do not assess interleukin 17
inhibitors, and more data from other registries that
capture the use of this class of drug are needed to
understand this potential risk. With consideration of
the role of TNFea in depression, further study may
be
beneficial
to
determine
whether
biologic
therapies targeting other cytokines may have a
different impact on depression and suicide relative
to antieTNFea agents.19
Overall, this study contributes to the body of
literature suggesting that treatment with biologic
agents may reduce the risk for development of
depressive
symptoms
among
patients
with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis. It also provides a
longitudinal description of depressive symptoms,
depression events, and suicidality in a large cohort
of patients with psoriasis. Further studies are needed
to fully understand how biologics, including novel
agents, affect the risk for depression and suicide
among patients with psoriasis.

*Patients had an elevated HADS-D score (baseline) if their HADS-D score was 8 or higher at enrollment, and they had an elevated HADS-D
score (registry) if their HADS-D score was 8 or higher at any other time point.
yA history of depression was based on medical history at the time of enrollment. Depression (registry) was defined as an adverse event of
depression during enrollment.
zPatients who were ever exposed to biologics (ADA, ETN, IFX, UST, ALE, EFA, and/or golimumab), nonbiologic immunomodulators (MTX,
CsA, oral tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, retinoids [ACT, etretinate, isotretinoin], and/or systemic steroids), and
phototherapy (psoralens plus ultraviolet light and/or UVB) may have been treated before and/or during enrollment.
xBiologic and other treatments at time of event were defined as those received by the patient if the last dose occurred within the past
91 days.
kThis patient had a history of alcohol use (quantity and frequency unknown) and was suspected of drug intoxication. The last dose of a
biologic (UST) was received 34 days before the suicide.
{This patient had a history of anxiety, depression, and alcoholism. The last dose of a biologic (ADA) was received 216 weeks before the
suicide.
#This patient had a history of alcohol use and depression. The last dose of a biologic (UST) was received 17 weeks before the suicide.
