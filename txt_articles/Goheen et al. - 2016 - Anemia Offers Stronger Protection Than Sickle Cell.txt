Background: Iron deficiency causes long-term adverse consequences for children and is the most common nutri-
tional deficiency worldwide. Observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia protects against Plasmo-
dium falciparum malaria and several intervention trials have indicated that iron supplementation increases
malaria risk through unknown mechanism(s). This poses a major challenge for health policy. We investigated
how anemia inhibits blood stage malaria infection and how iron supplementation abrogates this protection.
Methods: This observational cohort study occurred in a malaria-endemic region where sickle-cell trait is also
common. We studied fresh RBCs from anemic children (135 children; age 6–24 months; hemoglobin b11 g/dl)
participating in an iron supplementation trial (ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN07210906) in which they re-
ceived iron (12 mg/day) as part of a micronutrient powder for 84 days. Children donated RBCs at baseline, Day
49, and Day 84 for use in flow cytometry-based in vitro growth and invasion assays with P. falciparum laboratory
and field strains. In vitro parasite growth in subject RBCs was the primary endpoint.
Findings: Anemia substantially reduced the invasion and growth of both laboratory and field strains of P. falciparum in
vitro (~10% growth reduction per standard deviation shift in hemoglobin). The population level impact against eryth-
rocytic stage malaria was 15.9% from anemia compared to 3.5% for sickle-cell trait. Parasite growth was 2.4 fold higher
after 49 days of iron supplementation relative to baseline (p b 0.001), paralleling increases in erythropoiesis.
Interpretation: These results confirm and quantify a plausible mechanism by which anemia protects African children
against falciparum malaria, an effect that is substantially greater than the protection offered by sickle-cell trait. Iron sup-
plementation completely reversed the observed protection and hence should be accompanied by malaria prophylaxis.
Lower hemoglobin levels typically seen in populations of African descent may reflect past genetic selection by malaria.

1. Introduction
Malaria and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) impact the same geo-
graphic and demographic groups and the pathophysiological relation-
ship between the two is complex. Acute malaria can cause severe
anemia due to hemolysis of infected and uninfected RBCs, and chronic
or subclinical malaria can induce anemia of inflammation (Clark et al.,
2014a). There is clear epidemiological evidence in both children
(Gwamaka et al., 2012; Jonker et al., 2012; Nyakeriga et al., 2004) and
pregnant women (Kabyemela et al., 2008; Senga et al., 2011) that,
once established, IDA is protective against malaria infection. In fact, in
pregnant women, iron deficiency has been shown to reduce risk of

 placental malaria to a greater extent than multiparity (Kabyemela et al.,
2008).
Multiple studies have raised concern that iron supplementation in
malaria-endemic areas may put people at increased risk of acquiring
malaria (Murray et al., 1978, 1975; Oppenheimer et al., 1986; Smith et
al., 1989; Veenemans et al., 2011). Most importantly, a large childhood
nutritional supplementation study in Zanzibar was halted due to in-
creased morbidity and mortality in children receiving iron (Sazawal et
al., 2006). Subsequently, WHO modified its recommendation for univer-
sal iron supplementation and now recommends that, in malarious re-
gions, iron supplements be given where malaria management and
prevention services are present (Neuberger et al., 2016; World Health
Organization, 2016). This has severely disrupted iron supplementation
campaigns in malaria endemic areas, despite IDA being the leading
cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents ac-
cording to the 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study (Global Burden of
Disease Pediatrics Collaboration et al., 2016). Reducing the prevalence
of anemia is one of the six priorities of the WHO's Comprehensive Im-
plementation Plan on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition
(World Health Organization, 2014). Further complicating research in
this area, it is now difficult to ethically study the safety of iron supple-
mentation in malarious areas. In most developing countries iron supple-
ments cannot be withheld during a study and all children in iron
supplementation studies must be provided malaria prevention services
and monitored closely for illness. As a result, recent studies evaluating
the safety of iron supplementation have done so in the context of pro-
viding malaria prevention services and extensive medical care
(Mwangi et al., 2015; Zlotkin et al., 2013) – a scenario that would not
necessarily exist in reality.
In an effort to assess the magnitude of protection from anemia and
the safety of iron supplementation in a malaria endemic area where
sickle-cell trait is common, we have systematically characterized P.
falciparum growth in vitro in RBCs from anemic African children before,
during, and after 12 weeks of iron supplementation.
2. Methods
2.1. Subject recruitment, study design, and blood samples for parasite
assays
The blood samples for the parasite assays were taken from children
enrolled in the control arm of a randomized trial testing the efficacy and
safety of a hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat strategy for combatting
anemia (see published protocol for full details) (Wegmüller et al.,
2016). (Note we also assayed RBCs from children in the other two
arms of this trial, but only for observation at baseline, pre-randomiza-
tion/pre-intervention.) Study participants were recruited from 12 com-
munities in Jarra West (Soma, Karantaba, Kani Kunda, Sankwia,
Mansakonko, Pakalinding, Jenoi and Si Kunda) and Kiang East
(Toniataba, Jiffin, Kaiaf and Genieri), in the Lower River Region of The
Gambia. The study took place from May 2014 through December 2015
in five cohorts. In total 407 healthy young children, aged 6–23 months,
were identified during child welfare clinics at the health facilities of
Jarra West and Kiang East. After informed consent was obtained, chil-
dren had to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria to be enrolled. For in-
clusion children must have been apparently healthy, 6–23 months old,
not severely malnourished (z-scores for Height-for-Age, Weight-for-
Age, Weight-for-Height N −3 SD), 7 g/dl ≤ Hgb b 11 g/dl, free of malaria,
resident in the study area, able and willing to comply with the study
protocol, have had no congenital disorders or chronic disease, and
must not have been taking regular medication nor participating in an-
other study. Sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint
in the parent study (Wegmüller et al., 2016).
As per current WHO recommendations, children in the control arm
received 12 mg/d iron as ferrous fumarate, given orally within a micro-
nutrient powder (modified MixMe™ supplied by DSM Nutritional
Products). Field workers visited children daily in order to supervise
the micronutrient powder administration and check the children's
health status. For baseline population characteristics, see Supplemental
Table 1. Fresh RBCs were obtained from these anemic (Hgb b 11 g/dl)
but otherwise healthy children (6–23 m) living in rural Gambia
(Wegmüller et al., 2016). Blood was collected at Days 0 (baseline), 49,
and 84 during 12 weeks of iron supplementation (Fig. 1) with the pri-
mary objective of evaluating in vitro P. falciparum growth characteristics
to model malaria susceptibility in anemic subjects before and after iron
supplementation. We compared subject characteristics of those whose
blood was and was not able to be used for growth rate data to ensure
no sampling bias occurred (Supplemental Table 2). For a full description
of this embedded observational study, please see the published protocol
(Wegmüller et al., 2016).
2.2. P. falciparum Culture
Parasite lines FCR3-FMG (MR4, MRA-736) and 3D7 (MR4, MRA-
102) were routinely cultured in RBCs from healthy donors using stan-
dard methods (Clark et al., 2014a). Parasite strains 952, 998, and 1029
were isolated from patients presenting with symptomatic malaria infec-
tions at the Jammeh Foundation for Peace hospital in Serekunda and the
Fig. 1. Description of subjects and flow chart of sample collection and assays performed.
Blood samples for hematological, biochemical, and parasite growth analyses were drawn
at Day 0, as well as Day 49 and Day 84 for those taking iron. A full hematology panel
was measured in EDTA-stabilized blood (Medonic M20M GP). We also assayed plasma
ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), C-
reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) (Cobas Integra 400 plus); and
hepcidin (Hepcidin-25 (human) EIA Kit (Bachem)). Genotyping for hemoglobinopathies
was performed using hemoglobin electrophoresis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) enzyme activity was measured by commercial kit (R&D Diagnostics Ltd). For
malaria assays, 2.5 ml of venous blood was drawn directly into microvette tubes
containing CPDA-1 (Sarstedt, Germany). Unavailable donors include safety exclusion
(Hgb b 7 g/dl or positive malaria test, RDT pos) or general loss to follow up (withdrawal
and travel). Failure to collect blood from subjects (e.g. from phlebotomy failure, subject
moved or withdrew, or became significantly ill) was 7.8% (32/407) at Day 0, 17.0% (23/
135) at Day 49, and 20.7% (28/135) at Day 84. RBCs from study subjects were evaluated
with in vitro P. falciparum growth assays (using strain FCR3-FMG) as a proxy measure
for malaria susceptibility. In order to standardize the growth assays, control for inter-
assay variability and variability between parasite preparations, assays on clinical
samples were run in parallel with and reported relative to growth assays done using
RBCs from non-anemic donors. Each available blood sample at every time point was
subjected to growth assays but not all produced growth data, as some blood was
unusable (e.g. clotted, hemolysed, contaminated). Further growth data exclusions (e.g.
parasites died or control blood did not provide a readable output for comparison) do not
represent population sampling bias, as subject characteristics are the same between
those with and without corresponding growth data (Supplemental Table 2).

 outpatient clinic at MRC Fajara, both located within the urban/periurban
coastal area of The Gambia. Isolates were collected as part of a larger
study during the annual malaria transmission seasons (September–Jan-
uary) from 2005 to 2011, as described in (Gomez-Escobar et al., 2010).
2.3. 2.4
Growth Assay
In vitro growth was assessed in fresh, washed RBCs as in (Clark et al.,
2014a) for 96 h (performed in triplicate for RBCs from each study partic-
ipant). RBCs from healthy, iron replete adult donors of normal hemoglo-
bin genotype and G6PD status not undergoing iron supplementation
served as controls for inter-assay variability. Growth rates represent
final 96 h parasitemia divided by initial 0 h parasitemia (Clark et al.,
2014a), analyzed by flow cytometry (see Supplemental methods).
Growth rates in subjects' RBCs were normalized to that in control
RBCs assayed simultaneously.
2.4. RBC Barcoding Invasion Assay
The assay was performed and analyzed as in (Clark et al., 2014b)
using two different concentrations of CellTrace Far Red DDAO
(Invitrogen Life Technologies/Molecular Probes): 1uM (high) or 0.1uM
(low) (see Supplemental methods and Supplemental Fig. 2 for flow cy-
tometry analysis).
2.5. Reticulocyte Quantification
Reticulocyte (CD71+) levels in fresh subject RBCs were assessed
using PE-conjugated anti-human CD71 antibody (Clone M-A712, BD)
and isotype control (Clone G155-178, BD), and analyzed by flow cytom-
etry (see Supplemental methods) for reticulocyte percent relative to
non-anemic control.
2.6. Statistics
All experiments were done in triplicate. Growth rates, invasion as-
says, and hematological data were compared by two-tailed Student's
t-test, one-way ANOVA, and/or 95% CI values using GraphPad Prism 5.
2.7. Multivariate Modelling
We employed linear regression to estimate the effect of hematolog-
ical characteristics on in vitro parasite growth rates. First, bivariate asso-
ciations and their respective 95% CI were calculated between growth
rates and hematological and patient characteristics at Day 0. We then
used multivariate linear regression. We used directed acyclic graphs to
identify potential confounders and controlled for them in our modelling
approach (Rothman et al., 2008). An a priori alpha of 0.05 was used to
determine statistical significance. Analyses were performed using R
software (RStudio Version 0.99.902).
2.8. Population Level Impact Equation
Using our in vitro data on the erythrocytic stage growth of the malar-
ia parasite as a proxy measure for malaria susceptibility, we compared
the relative protection offered by sickle-cell trait carriage and anemia
using the following formula: pp(RG-1)/RG, where pp is the percentage
of the population exposed to the protective factor and RG is the relative
in vitro parasite growth rate associated with that factor. The RG values
for sickle-cell trait and hemoglobin were based on the standardized β
coefficients from our multivariate modelling results. In this population
of Gambian children, the pp for anemia is 0.75 (derived from 688 chil-
dren b3y in the Kiang West Longitudinal Population Study) (Hennig
et al., 2015) and the pp of AS is 0.159, (Cox et al., 2008). This calculation
does not give an epidemiological measure of disease risk, it is a simple
calculation designed to illustrate the relative magnitudes of the impacts
of sickle-cell trait and anemia in our study population.
2.9. Ethics Approval
The trial from which children were recruited was approved by the
MRCG Scientific Coordinating and The Gambia Government/MRC Joint
Ethics Committees (SCC 1358) and the UNC IRB (14-1551) which con-
form to Declaration of Helsinki standards. Parents/guardians were
given a full description of the study in their native language and provid-
ed written signed consent.
3. Results
3.1. P. falciparum Growth Is Reduced in RBCs from Anemic Children
Evaluating in vitro parasite growth in RBCs from anemic children at
baseline, we consistently found lower parasite growth rates than in
RBCs from iron replete individuals. Furthermore, growth was lower in
RBCs from those donors with the lowest hemoglobin concentrations
(Hgb 7–9 g/dl = mean relative growth rate (GR) 32.6%; Hgb 9.1–
10 g/dl = GR 45.9%; Hgb 10.1–11 = GR 55.9%; p b 0.05 by ANOVA)
(Fig. 2A). Iron panel data indicated some degree of iron deficiency in
most participants (Table 1). However, as the diagnosis of iron deficiency
in children with ongoing inflammation is controversial, we grouped
subjects using several common definitions of IDA in an attempt to un-
cover any further differential impacts on malaria susceptibility. We ob-
served decreased parasite growth in all anemic children independent of
the type (e.g. with inflammation or without) and severity of iron defi-
ciency, with no significant differences between groups (Supplemental
Fig. 1).
To further investigate potential confounding effects of inflammation
and host genetics on parasite growth, we performed bivariate analysis
using P. falciparum in vitro growth, hematological, iron, and inflammato-
ry data obtained for subjects prior to iron supplementation to determine
which variables influenced parasite growth in anemic children (Table
2). Several key variables commonly assumed to affect anemia and/or
blood-stage malaria growth were tested. Hemoglobin genotype influ-
ence was evaluated solely based on β-globin sickle-cell trait (AS) muta-
tion versus normal β-globin (AA), as other β-globin genotypes
(homozygous sickle-cell anemia (SS), hemoglobin C (AC), and a hetero-
zygous combination (SC)) were rare. Hemoglobin concentration, hemo-
globin genotype, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) all significantly
influenced parasite growth. G6PD status (normal versus deficient) did
not significantly affect parasite growth, nor did age, sex, ferritin,
hepcidin, or CRP (Table 2). Parasite growth rate decreased 10.7% for
every 1 g/dl hemoglobin decrease. Additionally, we found parasite
growth rate decreased 1.4% for every 1 fl decrease in MCV and 18.3%
in RBCs from children carrying sickle-cell trait. In order to compare
the magnitude of these growth rate effects, we standardized the growth
rate differences per standard deviation (SD) of each exposure variable,
finding 8.6% and 10.8% decreased parasite growth per SD of hemoglobin
and MCV, respectively (Table 2). Next, we performed multivariate anal-
ysis to determine if the effect of hemoglobin on malaria growth rate was
confounded by hemoglobin genotype and vice versa. These variables
retained significant effects on malaria growth independently of one
other, highlighting the independent impact of both microcytic anemia
and sickle-cell trait on malaria growth.
3.2. The Population Level Impact on Parasite Growth Is Greater from Ane-
mia than Sickle-Cell Trait Genotype
Using our multivariate modelling results, we estimated the popula-
tion level impact on parasite growth from both sickle-cell trait genotype
and anemia in order to assess overall the risk of malaria infection in our
study population. Given the prevalence of AS (15.9%) (Cox et al., 2008)
125
M.M. Goheen et al. / EBioMedicine 14 (2016) 123–130
 and anemia (75%) (Hennig et al., 2015), we thus calculated the popula-
tion level impact of malaria growth reduction to be 3.5% from sickle-cell
trait and 15.9% from anemia in these Gambian children. Note that this
underestimates the protection by anemia because it simply compares
anemic (defined as Hgb b 11 g/dl, 2 SD below the mean) versus non-
anemic children. In fact, our population mean Hgb is 3.6 standard devi-
ations below normative data (mean 12 g/dl) from healthy African-
American children (Sandoval, 2016); using this comparator the protec-
tion offered to the average Gambian child would be a 31% reduction in
parasite growth rate (see Table 2).
Fig. 2. Parasite growth and invasion in RBCs from anemic children (Hgb b 11 g/dl) at baseline. A) P. falciparum (strain FCR3-FMG) growth rates are proportional to hemoglobin
concentration. Growth assays were performed in RBCs drawn from anemic children at baseline (Day 0) and values are presented relative to growth in RBCs from non-anemic donors.
Each dot represents the mean result of triplicate growth assays from each donor and the error bars represent 95% CI. One-way ANOVA indicates the means are significantly different
between Days (p b 0.05); specifically, post-hoc analysis with Tukey's test indicates significant differences between Hgb levels 7–9 g/dl and 10.1–11 g/dl (*p b 0.05). B) P. falciparum
clinical isolates from The Gambia exhibit decreased growth in RBCs from anemic children at Day 0. Growth of 3 different clinical strains (952, 998, 1029) was compared to growth of a
laboratory strain (FCR3-FMG) in RBCs from five anemic children. Each dot represents the mean result of triplicate growth assays from each donor relative to growth in non-anemic
RBCs and error bars represent the 95% CI. The mean relative growth rate in anemic RBCs for each strain is decreased compared to 100% growth in non-anemic RBCs. C) Direct
comparison of invasion into RBCs from anemic and non-anemic donors using P. falciparum laboratory strains. Invasion experiments for RBCs from all anemic donors (drawn at Day 0)
were performed independently and each experiment was performed in triplicate. Data show the mean SI using RBCs from 10 anemic donors for strain 3D7 and 15 for FCR3-FMG. The
SI defines the relative susceptibility to invasion of two different types of RBCs. The marker represents the SI point estimate and the bar represents the 95% CI. An SI of 1.0 indicates no
difference in parasite invasion of two RBC populations. Both strains 3D7 and FCR3-FMG give SI values significantly decreased from the control value of 1.0. D) Direct comparison of
invasion into RBCs from either anemic or non-anemic donors using clinical strains of P. falciparum. Invasion experiments for RBCs from all anemic donors (drawn at Day 0) were
performed independently and each experiment was performed in triplicate. Data show the mean SI using RBCs from 5 anemic donors for all strains (FCR3-FMG, 952, 998, 1029). The
marker represents the SI point estimate and the bar represents the 95% CI. An SI of 1.0 indicates no difference in parasite invasion of two RBC populations.

 3.3. P. falciparum Clinical Isolates Exhibit Decreased Growth in RBCs from
Anemic Children
We additionally evaluated the growth of Gambian clinical P.
falciparum isolates (952, 998, and 1029) to ensure the observed de-
creased parasite growth in anemic RBCs was not solely a phenomenon
of laboratory adaptation. These field isolates assayed in parallel in
RBCs from 5 randomly chosen anemic subjects at baseline (with normal
hemoglobin genotype and CRP b 5 mg/ml) all exhibited decreased
growth compared to RBCs from non-anemic individuals (Fig. 2B).
Mean growth rates for all strains were consistently below 100%
(FCR3-FMG = 51.88% CI = 29.33–74.43%; 952 = 74.43%, CI = 55.04–
93.83%; 998 = 59.34%, CI = 42.51–76.16%; and 1029 = 74.94%, CI =
53.31–96.57%).
3.4. RBCs from Anemic Children Are Resistant to Invasion by Laboratory and
Field Strains of P. falciparum
Next, we used a RBC barcoding assay (Clark et al., 2014b) adapted for
field use (Supplemental Fig. 2) to directly compare parasite invasion
into RBCs from anemic children (n = 15 for strain FCR3-FMG and
n = 10 for strain 3D7) versus non-anemic donors. Susceptibility Indices
(SI) of RBCs from the anemic donors were significantly decreased using
both strains (FCR3-FMG SI = 0.77, CI = 0.70–0.84; 3D7 SI = 0.66, CI =
0.54–0.78) (Fig. 2C). P. falciparum clinical isolates from The Gambia
(strains 952, 998, and 1029) also exhibited decreased invasion into
RBCs from anemic donors (952 SI = 0.65, CI = 0.58–0.73; 998 SI =
0.57, CI = 0.42–0.77; and 1029 SI = 0.62, CI = 0.49–0.75) (Fig. 2D).
These assays confirm the clinical relevance of previous in vitro work ex-
amining laboratory parasite strains and iron deficient RBCs (Clark et al.,
2014a).
3.5. P. falciparum Growth in vitro Increases Transiently with Iron
Supplementation
In order to assess malaria susceptibility following iron supplementa-
tion, we investigated in vitro parasite growth 49 and 84 days after daily
iron supplementation compared to baseline. The children were moni-
tored daily for changes in health status and underwent weekly malaria
testing. Consistent with the fact that malaria incidence is now low in
The Gambia (Mwesigwa et al., 2015), only two malaria cases occurred
during our study. Hence, in vitro assays offered a way to examine the
relationship between growth of malaria parasites in RBCs and changing
hematological parameters and capture the window of increased suscep-
tibility. Parasite growth rates in RBCs from study subjects were low on
Day 0 (n = 158, mean GR 48.51%, CI = 42.88–54.14%), increased mark-
edly by Day 49 (n = 91, mean GR 120.3%, CI = 106.6–133.9%), and then
by Day 84 decreased back to levels closer to those seen in non-anemic
individuals (n = 87, mean GR 80.26%, CI = 57.27–103.3%). One-way
ANOVA confirmed significant differences in parasite growth rates across
Days 0, 49 and 84 (p b 0.0001) and post-hoc analysis using Tukey's test
indicated significant differences between Days 0 and 49 (p b 0.001),
Days 0 and 84 (p b 0.01), and Days 49 and 84 (p b 0.001) (Fig. 3A).
Restricting the analysis to paired comparisons within the 35 children
with growth measurements at all 3 timepoints, we confirmed the in-
creased growth rate from Day 0 to Day 49 (p b 0.001) (Supplemental
Fig. 3A).
To further confirm changes in malaria pathogenesis in RBCs from
anemic children taking iron, we performed invasion assays to assess
subjects' RBC susceptibility before and after iron supplementation in a
subset of randomly selected subjects (n = 8). The mean SI values of
these donors before iron supplementation (SI = 0.72; CI = 0.60–0.84)
and post iron (SI = 1.58, CI = 1.17–1.99) were significantly different
by student's t-test (p b 0.01) (Supplemental Fig. 3B).
3.6. The Population of Young RBCs Increases in Anemic Children Undergoing
Iron Supplementation
To assess RBC population age structure, we evaluated levels of CD71-
positive early reticulocytes in circulation at Days 0, 49, and 84 for a sub-
set of anemic children undergoing iron supplementation. Relative per-
cent of CD71-positive cells at Day 0 (mean = 129%, CI = 82–175%)
was comparable to non-anemic controls (standardized as 100%), and in-
creased at Day 49 (mean = 224%, CI = 166–286%) and Day 84
(mean = 180%, CI = 148–211%). Means were significantly different
by one-way repeated measures ANOVA (p b 0.01), and Tukey's test
showed significant difference between Days 0 and 49 only (p b 0.01)
(Fig. 3B; Supplemental Fig. 3C).
Further probing host factors which could increase parasite growth
rates in RBCs from children undergoing iron supplementation, we
assessed RBC surface markers from the same children over time (n =
8). We examined changes in surface expression of: glycophorin A
(GPA), a sialoglycoprotein affecting RBC charge; CD47, an anti-phago-
cytic RBC marker; C3b deposition on RBC surfaces; CD35, complement
receptor 1; CD55, a decay accelerating factor regulating complement

Effect of host hemoglobin, iron status, and other hematological characteristics on in vitro P. falciparum growth in RBCs from anemic children (Hgb b 11 g/dl) at baseline. Growth rates (GR)
were calculated relative to growth in healthy, non-anemic donors. Growth assays were performed in triplicate for each donor and the average value was used for linear regression model-
ling; multivariate analyses represent the estimated association for a given variable while controlling for potential confounders. Hgb genotype was evaluated solely based on AA vs. AS clas-
sification (too few individuals for statistical evaluation of SS genotypes) and G6PD status was evaluated solely based on normal vs. deficient classification. For continuous variables, the β1
value represents the %GR change (×100) for every 1 unit increase in the primary variable. For categorical variables, the β1 value represents the %GR change (×100) based on yes-no ge-
notype. For example, for Hgb AS, the %GR change is −18.3% relative to Hgb AA. Significant p values (b0.05) are bolded. The standardized %GR change for Hgb and MCV is calculated based
on the SD for the exposure variable of interest (see Table 1) multiplied by β1 (×100%), to give the %GR change for every 1 SD change in the exposure variable; for Hgb genotype the stan-
dardized %GR change is simply β1 (×100%).

 on the cell surface; CD147; and sialic acid, all of which can reflect RBC
age and overall membrane integrity and/or have been implicated in ma-
laria merozoite invasion. We found significantly increased GPA, CD47,
CD35 and CD147 levels and significantly decreased C3b deposition at
Day 49 (p b 0.01 for all, analyzing means between Day 0 and Day 49
by ANOVA and Tukey's test) (Supplemental Fig. 4). We were unable to
detect differences in CD55 and sialic acid levels. Taken together, these
surface marker findings support the idea that overall RBC population
age and membrane physiology has shifted towards a younger, healthier
RBC population following iron supplementation of anemic children.
4. Discussion
Use of in vitro growth assays as our primary outcome provided a rare
opportunity to systematically examine the cellular determinants of par-
asite growth in anemic and iron-supplemented children. We demon-
strate here that blood stage in vitro P. falciparum growth is decreased
in RBCs from anemic children and this effect is reversed by iron
supplementation.
Defining iron deficiency in children with ongoing infections or in-
flammation is difficult, and has confounded previous clinical studies try-
ing to determine the protective effect of iron deficiency on malaria
susceptibility. Here we show protection offered by anemia is substantial
(~10% per standard deviation shift in hemoglobin), and RBCs from chil-
dren with iron deficiency – no matter the definition criteria nor the
presence of potential confounders such as inflammation – consistently
reduce parasite growth compared to RBCs from non-anemic individuals.
Additionally, the use of clinical parasite isolates from The Gambia con-
firms that this is not merely an artefact of laboratory strains. Notably,
at the population level, anemia was estimated to confer at least four
times as much protection against blood stage parasite growth than sick-
le-cell trait. Taken together, this data is evidence that anemia exhibits a
profound natural influence on parasite growth beyond even the mostly
commonly studied and referenced RBC polymorphisms which evolved
due to malaria pressure.
Furthermore, we demonstrate parasite growth increases dramatical-
ly relative to baseline in RBCs taken from children during iron supple-
mentation, transiently rising at Day 49 to exceed growth rates in non-
anemic controls and remaining elevated at Day 84 relative to baseline.
Iron deficient RBCs have a shorter circulation lifetime (90 vs 120 days,
on average) and exhibit physiological differences such as microcytosis,
decreased deformability, and increased oxidative membrane stress,
among other effects – similar to changes in aged RBCs (Brandão et al.,
2009). As parasites preferentially infect young RBCs and reticulocytes
(Clark et al., 2014a; Lim et al., 2013), we assessed surface markers
reflecting RBC age and integrity to provide a picture of the overall health
of RBCs in anemic children undergoing iron treatment. Our data sug-
gests that erythropoiesis increased in response to iron, creating a youn-
ger population of circulating RBCs. These younger RBCs are most
prevalent at Day 49, which matches the largest shifts in malaria growth
rates and supports our hypothesis that parasite growth transiently in-
creases following iron supplementation due to P. falciparum's prefer-
ence for young RBCs (Clark et al., 2014a). The study was constrained
by the wide intervals between venous bleeds selected for the interven-
tion. At Day 49, it is possible the main iron-induced erythropoietic surge
already passed, in which case our data would underestimate the true
extent of increased malaria risk.
We also examined merozoite invasion into RBCs from anemic and
non-anemic individuals, as our previous work found invasion differ-
ences contributed significantly to reduced malaria pathogenesis in
iron deficient RBCs (Clark et al., 2014a). We expanded our previous
findings to show that RBCs from anemic African children were resistant
to invasion with both laboratory and clinical P. falciparum strains and
that iron supplementation increased invasion susceptibility. Our RBC
surface marker data corroborating a shift towards younger, healthier
RBCs corresponds with our hypothesis that changes in RBC population
structure influence overall malaria risk.
Fig. 3. Malaria susceptibility increases transiently during iron supplementation and anemic children receiving iron supplements have increased numbers of young RBCs. A) P. falciparum in
vitro growth rates in RBCs from anemic children increase over time with iron supplementation (12 mg iron daily for 84 d). Parasite growth assays were conducted in RBCs from children at
Day 0, Day 49, and Day 84 using strain FCR3-FMG. Growth rates are reported relative to growth in RBCs from non-anemic donors. Each dot represents the mean of triplicate assays and
error bars represent the 95% CI. Differences between growth rates at the different timepoints were significant (p b 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA); specifically, post-hoc analysis with Tukey's
test indicates significant differences between Day 0 and Day 49 (***p b 0.001) and Day 49 and Day 84 (***p b 0.001), as well as Day 0 and Day 84 (**p b 0.01). n = 158 children at Day 0, n =
91 children at Day 49, and n = 87 children at Day 84. B) Levels of CD71 positive RBCs increase over time in anemic children undergoing iron supplementation. Percent CD71-positive RBCs
was measured by flow cytometry analysis of CD71 surface expression. Error bars represent the 95% CI; one-way repeated measures ANOVA indicates the means are significantly different
between Days (p b 0.01, n = 31); post-hoc analysis with Tukey's test indicates significant differences between Day 0 and Day 49 (**p b 0.001) but not between Day 49 and Day 84, nor Day
0 and Day 84.

 The public health implications of our study are significant, shedding
light on the overarching question of whether iron supplements cause
harm. We acknowledge that in vitro parasite growth might not translate
directly to malaria susceptibility. Yet there are no other viable alterna-
tives for addressing this safety aspect regarding iron supplementation
in malarious regions. While our system only examined the RBC impact
of anemia on malaria growth, eliminating the impact of serum iron or
immune cells, the fact that we still observe such profound growth ef-
fects highlights the protection afforded by anemia and the need for cau-
tion regarding iron supplementation. Furthermore, our results provide
insight into why other clinical studies on this topic produce such vari-
able results – given we find increased malaria susceptibility is transient,
other studies may miss the window of enhanced susceptibility. We de-
tect significant changes in parasite growth rates despite relatively small
changes in hemoglobin levels, emphasizing the impact of iron and RBC
population dynamics on P. falciparum pathogenesis. Our data clearly
show that the safety of iron supplementation must be addressed, even
if additional unknown mechanisms contribute to increased malaria sus-
ceptibility. We thus advocate temporary malaria prophylaxis should al-
ways accompany iron supplementation for anemic children in malaria
endemic areas, though the period of enhanced susceptibility has not
been accurately identified by this study. Finally, quantifying the sizeable
contribution of anemia to population level protection against malaria,
our research raises the question of whether consistently reduced hemo-
globin and MCV values in people of African descent are genetic signa-
tures of evolution under significant malaria pressure, much like the
hemoglobinopathies.
