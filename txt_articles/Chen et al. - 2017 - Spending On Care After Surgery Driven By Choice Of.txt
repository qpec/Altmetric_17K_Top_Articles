Abstract
Episode-based payment models are increasing in popularity for surgery. We evaluated how much 
variation in post-acute care (PAC) spending after surgery is explained by: PAC choice (i.e., choice 
of home health, outpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing, or inpatient rehabilitation) versus PAC 
intensity (amount of spending in a chosen setting). PAC spending varied widely between hospitals 
in low versus high PAC spending quintiles (total hip replacement (THR): $5,112 to $11,708, or 
129% difference; coronary bypass grafting (CABG): $4,143 to $8,403, or 103% difference; 
colectomy: $3,345 to $6,104, or 82% difference). This variation persisted after adjusting for PAC 
intensity, but diminished considerably after adjusting for choice of PAC setting (THR 109% vs. 
16% difference; CABG 108% vs. 4% difference; colectomy 62% vs. 21% difference). Health 
systems aiming to improve surgical episode efficiency should focus on working with patients to 
choose the highest value PAC setting.
Introduction
Post-acute care (PAC) is one of the fastest growing areas of US healthcare spending (1, 2). 
About 40% of older Americans discharged from a hospital utilize PAC (i.e., home health, 
skilled nursing facility, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation), and the National Academy of

 Medicine identified PAC as the component of care most responsible for wide variation in 
total per capita Medicare spending (3–5). In this context, the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) are holding hospitals accountable for care that occurs after 
discharge. In the Hospital Value-based Purchasing Program (HVBP), CMS is penalizing 
hospitals that spend more than their peers on episodes of care that start 3 days prior to 
hospital admission and end 30 days after discharge (6). CMS is also evaluating or proposing 
bundled payments around acute care hospitalization for several programs – Comprehensive 
Care for Joint Replacement (CCJR),the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) 
initiative, and recently proposed cardiac and orthopedic bundled payment models (7–10). In 
each of these programs, participating hospitals can accept payments for longitudinal, 
condition-specific episodes of care that include PAC.
While hospitals have been charged with identifying ways to decrease PAC spending, factors 
responsible for current variation in PAC spending are incompletely understood. After major 
inpatient surgery in older adults, hospitals have a range of choices regarding post-discharge 
care. Patients may be discharged without services; with home health care with or without 
outpatient physical therapy; or with inpatient skilled nursing or rehabilitation. Despite vastly 
different costs attributable to these services, there are little clinical outcomes data to guide 
decision-making around choice of post-acute care setting or intensity of services in a given 
setting. Furthermore, how discharge decisions impact post-acute care spending for surgical 
conditions has not yet been fully defined.
In this context, we sought to identify factors that explain variation in total PAC spending 
after three common, costly surgical procedures: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 
colectomy, and total hip replacement (THR). What patient and hospital characteristics are 
associated with variation in total PAC spending? To what degree are price and case mix 
responsible? Finally, are differences in PAC spending due primarily to the choice to use any 
PAC, the choice to use certain types of PAC, or utilization once at a PAC facility?
Methods
Data source and study population
To create cohorts of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 years or older undergoing 
total hip replacement, CABG, or colectomy from January 2009 to June 2012 at a US acute 
care hospital, we used Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR), Part B, 
Outpatient, and Home Health Agency files. To describe hospital characteristics, we used 
data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey.
University of Michigan determined that Institutional Review Board approval was not 
required for this study.
THR, CABG, and colectomy cohorts
We started with 353,434 patients (in 3,383 hospitals) who underwent total hip replacement 
(ICD-9 81.51) between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2012. We then excluded patients who 
had been in hospice care, a long term hospital, an inpatient rehabilitation facility, or a skilled 
nursing facility within 90 days prior to the index hospitalization. After excluding patients

 who were not Parts A&B eligible, hospitals that performed fewer than 10 THR cases per 
year, and patients with select clinical conditions (see Appendix Exhibit A),(11) we had 
231,744 patients (1,831 hospitals) in our final sample.
For CABG, we started with 397,732 patients (1,218 hospitals) who underwent cardiac artery 
bypass grafting (ICD-9 3610, 3611, 3612, 3613, 3614, 3615, 3616, 3617, 3619, 362) 
between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2012. After applying exclusions, we had a final 
sample of 218,940 patients in 1,056 hospitals.
For colectomy, we started with 283,194 patients in 3,926 hospitals who underwent 
colectomy (ICD-9 1731, 1732, 1733, 1734, 1735, 1736, 1739, 4571, 4572, 4573, 4574, 
4575, 4576, 4579, 4581, 4582, 4583). After applying exclusions, we had 189,229 patients 
(1,876 hospitals) in our final sample.
Post-acute care
We defined use of post-acute care as the presence of claims for any of four types of services 
within 90 days of discharge: home health, outpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility 
(SNF), and inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). We chose to examine PAC during a 90-day 
episode, because many of CMS’ current initiatives around bundled payments use 90-day 
episodes of care (12). We chose these four types of care because they may partially 
substitute for each other (13, 14).
Each PAC setting requires a different set of patient social supports and has different 
implications for payment. Patients discharged home with outpatient rehabilitation must be 
able to attend regular therapy sessions outside the home. Outpatient therapy is reimbursed on 
a per-service basis tied to relative value units (RVUs)(15). In contrast, patients discharged 
with home health have limited ability to leave their home, yet require services such as 
intermittent skilled nursing, or physical or occupational therapy. Home health agencies are 
reimbursed for a 60-day episode of care if at least 5 visits are provided. (16). Both SNFs and 
IRFs have on-site nursing, and therapy sessions take place in the facility. SNFs are 
reimbursed on a per diem basis, and payments account for a patient’s clinical and functional 
status and the therapy provided (17). IRFs are reimbursed per stay, and payments account a 
patient’s clinical, functional, and cognitive status (18). Patients who are discharged to IRFs 
must be able to receive three hours of therapy per day, while patients discharged to SNF do 
not need to meet this therapy threshold.
We identified each of the four types of PAC in claims data using information about the 
claims data source and/or specific codes. Of note, for most beneficiaries who used SNF or 
IRF during a 90-day episode, the first claim for these services occurred within a day of 
hospital discharge (sensitivity analyses; results not displayed).
Statistical analyses
Our overall goal is to determine the causes for differences across PAC spending quintiles, 
defined by the average PAC spending per patient at a given hospital. To address whether 
observable patient and hospital characteristics explain differences in PAC spending, we first 
described differences in patient and hospital characteristics across those PAC spending

 quintiles (See the Methods Appendix).(11) We used the Cochran Armitage test for trend and 
F-tests to test the hypothesis that the mean of each characteristic is the same between the 
first, second through fourth, and fifth quintiles.
We next assessed how variation in PAC spending was affected by a series of factors. We 
started with “actual cost,” which represents actual Medicare payments for post-acute care. 
We next adjusted for prices; this accounts for any differences in payments due to regional 
differences in prices (e.g., due to wages being different in different parts of the country)(19). 
We next additionally adjusted price-standardized payments for case mix. This quantifies how 
much PAC spending would differ across hospitals if all hospitals treated patients with the 
same severity of illness. To estimate price- and case-mix adjusted spending, we ran patient-
level regressions to predict price-standardized PAC spending,(19) controlling for patient-
level variables, including 28 Elixhauser co-morbidities (20), sex, race, age, admission type, 
prior 6-month spending, and post-operative complications.
We next described whether the remaining variation in PAC spending could be explained by 
differences in PAC intensity vs. choice of PAC setting. We defined PAC intensity as amount 
of spending in a chosen setting, or average risk-adjusted, price-standardized spending for a 
given PAC setting. For example, since SNFs are paid on a per diem basis, a SNF stay that is 
30 days long would have a higher intensity than a SNF stay that is 20 days long, all other 
things being equal. To evaluate the relative effects of intensity vs. choice, we alternately 
assigned the same spending to all patients in a given PAC setting (to evaluate the relative 
contribution of PAC intensity), or held choice of PAC setting constant across hospitals (to 
evaluate the relative contribution of PAC choice). The remaining source of variation then 
was either the choice of PAC setting (if intensity was held constant), or spending once in a 
PAC setting (if choice of PAC setting was held constant).
To further quantify the amount of variation in PAC spending attributable to intensity versus 
choice of setting, we used the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition (21, 22) and estimated the 
proportion of overall PAC spending differences attributable to the choice of each PAC 
setting, and the proportion attributable to the intensity of use in each PAC setting.
Finally, to assess whether hospital-level, price-standardized, risk-adjusted PAC spending is 
similar across the three studied conditions, we evaluated within-hospital correlations. P-
values<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were conducted in 
Stata Version 12.1 and SAS version 9.4.
Our study had several potential limitations. First, we examined use of PAC among fee-for-
service Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, our findings may not be generalizable to other 
populations. Second, we examined PAC use after three common procedures, so our findings 
may not apply to patients hospitalized for medical conditions. Third, with our price-
standardization,(19) we were not able to disentangle how much variation in SNF intensity 
was due to differences in length of stay vs. Resource Utilization Group (RUG). Fourth, we 
did not have information about functional status on hospital discharge, as these data do not 
yet exist with national Medicare claims data. Fifth, it is important to note that we did not 
include readmissions in our definition of PAC, nor did we adjust our PAC intensity measure 
Chen et al.

 for any potential differences in readmissions across PAC spending quintiles. Finally, it is 
well-known that IRFs are unequally distributed across the country (23). Differential distance 
to PAC settings likely impacts the joint patient and hospital decision about discharge, but 
with our data we could not quantify how much any variability due to choice of PAC setting 
was due to differences in PAC availability.
Results
Utilization of and Spending on Post-Acute Care
Approximately 93% of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who underwent THR utilized 
some type of PAC in the 90 days after surgery, with modest variation across total PAC 
spending quintiles (Exhibit 1). Although at least half of patients utilized PAC after all three 
procedures, total PAC spending varied widely among hospitals (Exhibit 1).
Patient and Hospital Characteristics and Post-Acute Care Spending
Patient and hospital characteristics differed across PAC spending quintiles (Exhibit 1 and 
Appendix Exhibit B).(11) Compared to patients undergoing THR at hospitals in the lowest 
PAC spending quintile, patients undergoing THR at hospitals in the highest PAC spending 
quintile were more likely to be older and more likely to have a post-operative complication 
(Appendix Exhibit B).(11) Hospitals in the highest cost quintile for THR were more likely to 
be teaching hospitals, for-profit hospitals, and to be located in the Northeast (Exhibit 1). 
Results were similar for CABG and colectomy. All differences between the highest and 
lowest cost quintiles were statistically significant at the p<0.05 level.
Type and Intensity of Post-Acute Care Utilization
When we examined components of variation in price-standardized total PAC payments (i.e., 
averaged across all patients at a hospital, whether or not they used any PAC), IRF payments 
showed the largest increase across cost quintiles (Exhibit 2 and Appendix Exhibits C-H).
(11) Spending on home health and outpatient rehabilitation made up a relatively small 
proportion of average total PAC spending, with little increase across cost quintiles.
Variation in price-standardized, risk-adjusted PAC payments was largely due to choice of 
PAC setting, rather than PAC intensity (Exhibit 3). For THR, actual Medicare payments 
averaged $4,608 in Q1 to $12,765 in Q5, for a difference of $8,157. When payments were 
price-standardized, the difference shrunk to $7,345 or 153% of Q1. This was because 
hospitals in Q1 were more likely to be in regions where prices for a given service were lower 
than hospitals in Q5. Thus, holding prices across regions constant, payments in Q1 increased 
and payments in Q5 decreased, and the difference between Q5 and Q1 narrowed. Similarly, 
when additionally holding case mix constant, the difference between PAC payments in Q1 
and Q5 shrunk further to $6,596 or 129% of Q1. This was because hospitals in Q1 were 
more likely to care for patients that were not as sick as patients in Q5. Additionally adjusting 
for intensity once discharged to a PAC setting marginally decreased the difference across 
PAC spending quintiles ($5,856, or 109% of Q1). In contrast, adjusting for choice of PAC 
setting substantially reduced hospital variation in PAC spending ($1,162 or 16% of Q1). 
Similarly, for CABG and colectomy, adjusting for PAC intensity reduced variation

 considerably less than adjusting for choice of PAC setting (CABG: 108% vs. 4%; 
colectomy: 62% vs. 21%).
We further examined how choice vs. intensity affected overall PAC spending for each PAC 
setting (Exhibit 4). The proportion of patients utilizing an IRF explained one-quarter to one-
half of the variation in total PAC spending (THR: $2,513 or 32% of the total variation in 
PAC spending between the highest and lowest cost quintiles; CABG: $2,809 (52%); and 
colectomy: $979 (26%)). Together, the choice to use an IRF or SNF explained one-half to 
three-quarters of all variation in total PAC spending. In contrast, differences in payment once 
at a given PAC setting were small.
The correlation of PAC spending was moderate for all procedure pairings (Appendix Exhibit 
I).(11) That is, hospitals that had high PAC spending for colectomy also tended to have high 
PAC spending for THR and CABG.
Discussion
Utilization of PAC after major inpatient surgery is common, but there is wide variation 
between hospitals in what types of care are provided, and how much is spent. While we 
found that the majority of patients undergoing THR, CABG, or colectomy utilized some 
type of PAC in the 90 days following hospital discharge, spending on PAC varied threefold 
between the highest and lowest spending quintiles of hospitals. Choice of PAC setting 
explained the majority of total variation in risk-adjusted, price-standardized PAC spending. 
High-cost hospitals and their patients preferentially chose skilled nursing and inpatient 
rehabilitation settings. Subsequent to the decision to use a particular PAC setting, the 
intensity of utilization did not explain meaningful differences in spending.
We found that hospitals that send more of their patients to IRFs, and to a lesser extent SNFs, 
have higher PAC spending. Our findings make sense in the context of the current PAC 
payment system. With traditional fee-for-service Medicare, hospitals have not been 
responsible for payments that occur after hospital discharge. Moreover, for patients 
discharged to a PAC setting, spending is relatively fixed at IRFs, the most expensive type of 
PAC. IRFs are paid prospectively per discharge, with adjustments for age, functional and 
cognitive status, diagnoses, and area prices (24). Although SNFs are paid on a per diem 
basis,(25) the cost to Medicare of an extra SNF day is small relative to the cost of an extra 
patient being sent to a SNF. Thus, even though the number of days at a SNF affects total 
PAC spending via per diem payments (or “intensity”), SNF length of stay still matters less 
than the choice to send a patient to a SNF in the first place.
These findings – that PAC spending depends more on the type, rather than the intensity of 
care chosen – provide insight into the causes of PAC spending variation after three common 
surgical procedures. Prior research has described how PAC spending and variation in PAC 
spending contributes to condition-specific total episode payments, growth in these payments, 
and overall national Medicare spending (1, 2, 23, 26–28). Others have examined the value of 
different PAC settings,(13) and described factors that might lead to higher-value PAC (29–
31). Most recently, Huckfeldt et al. examined PAC spending for eight medical conditions

 and two orthopedic procedures (32) performed in 2007 and 2008. They assessed how much 
of PAC spending was due to choice of IRF vs. SNF, as opposed to intensity. We build on this 
work by using more recent data (2009 to 2012) to compare results for total hip replacement 
(included in their sample) and two other common surgical conditions not included in their 
sample (i.e., colectomy and CABG)
Finally, our work is also new in that we quantify how much setting vs. intensity contributes 
to variation in PAC spending, and we include home health and outpatient rehabilitation, two 
types of care that may partially substitute for SNF or IRF care.
For providers, our findings have at least three implications. First, it is known that SNF length 
of stay varies, and some health systems have begun efforts to reduce SNF length of stay. Our 
findings suggest that efforts to reduce SNF length of stay (or “intensity”) will generally have 
a more modest impact on total PAC spending than efforts to identify which patients will 
benefit (vs. not benefit) from a SNF or IRF stay in the first place. As noted above, others 
have found similar patterns in PAC spending with earlier data, albeit for different conditions 
and a different group of PAC settings. However, providers may now have more incentive to 
reduce variation in discharges to PAC, given strong interest in ACOs and more widespread 
adoption of bundled payments. Second, choice of IRF is much more important than choice 
of SNF in explaining variation in total PAC spending for THR and CABG. This is primarily 
due to the fact that choice of IRF varies more widely than choice of SNF. The higher 
reimbursement of IRFs vs. SNFs plays a secondary role. Third, while choice of setting is 
important, there are differences across conditions. For example, for colectomy, variation in 
PAC spending is equally explained by choice of IRF, choice of SNF, and intensity of SNF. 
Thus efforts to reduce SNF LOS may be more effective for certain conditions than other 
conditions.
For payers and policymakers, our findings regarding the importance of choice of PAC 
setting, suggest that episodes of care aimed at reducing PAC spending should include the 
transition from hospital to PAC setting. Episodes of care that include both the index hospital 
stay and PAC have the best potential to reduce wide variation in PAC spending; episodes of 
care that include only PAC settings may be less effective. In addition, uniform measures of 
functional status on hospital discharge and PAC discharge will become increasingly 
important as patients and providers seek to make high-value PAC choices. CMS has taken 
the first step in this work by testing the Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation 
(CARE) Item Set, a uniform measure set(33). Given differences in length of stay across PAC 
providers and settings, fixed time points for measurement would be useful. Finally, patients 
play an important role in the choice of PAC setting and claims data do not capture the 
myriad factors that may influence patient preference (e.g., social support, availability of 
high-quality PAC settings). Thus, policymakers should monitor the effects of efforts to 
reduce PAC utilization, in order to prevent unintended consequences for vulnerable 
populations, whose need for PAC may not be fully accounted for in existing risk-adjusted 
measures of PAC utilization.

 Use of PAC after major surgery is common for older Americans, but average PAC spending 
varies widely among hospitals. Understanding when use of IRF or SNF care has value will 
be critical to reducing any unnecessary variation in PAC spending.
