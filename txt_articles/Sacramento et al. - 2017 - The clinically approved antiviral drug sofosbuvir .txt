Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, along with other agents of clinical significance 
such as dengue (DENV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses. Since ZIKV causes neurological disorders during 
fetal development and in adulthood, antiviral drugs are necessary. Sofosbuvir is clinically approved for 
use against HCV and targets the protein that is most conserved among the members of the Flaviviridae 
family, the viral RNA polymerase. Indeed, we found that sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV RNA polymerase, 
targeting conserved amino acid residues. Sofosbuvir inhibited ZIKV replication in different cellular 
systems, such as hepatoma (Huh-7) cells, neuroblastoma (SH-Sy5y) cells, neural stem cells (NSC) 
and brain organoids. In addition to the direct inhibition of the viral RNA polymerase, we observed 
that sofosbuvir also induced an increase in A-to-G mutations in the viral genome. Together, our data 
highlight a potential secondary use of sofosbuvir, an anti-HCV drug, against ZIKV.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes several agents of clinical signifi-
cance, such as dengue (DENV), hepatitis C (HCV), West Nile (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. 
This emerging pathogen is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Although ZIKV is an 
arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by mosquitos of the genus Aedes1, transmission through sexual 
 
contact has been described2. The perception that ZIKV causes a mild and self-limited infection3,4 has been jeop-
ardized in recent years, with outbreaks in the Pacific Islands and the Americas1,5. For instance, ZIKV spread 
explosively across the Brazilian territory and to neighboring countries in 2015, infecting more than 4 million peo-
ple6. As the ZIKV epidemic has scaled up, the virus has been associated with congenital malformations, including 
microcephaly, and a broad range of neurological disorders in adults, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)7,8. 
These morbidities associated with ZIKV infection led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the Zika 
outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern.

Antiviral treatments against ZIKV are therefore necessary not only to mitigate ZIKV-associated morbidities 
but also to impair the chain of transmission. Some broad-spectrum antivirals, such as interferons (IFNs), riba-
virin and favipiravir, are not suitable for use against ZIKV because they can be harmful to pregnant women9. 
Alternatively, others have studied the use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecule 
drugs against ZIKV10–15. Overall, these drugs might exert their anti-ZIKV activity at least in part by interfering 
with the cellular pathways important for ZIKV replication10–15.
The gene encoding the viral RNA polymerase shows the highest degree of conservation among the members 
of the Flaviviridae family16, and the clinically approved anti-HCV drug sofosbuvir targets this protein. Sofosbuvir 
is an uridine nucleotide prodrug, which is triphosphorylated within cells to target the viral RNA polymerase17. 
Sofosbuvir is a class B FDA-approved drug. Moreover, Australia’s regulatory agency on drug administration, 
the Therapeutic and Goods Administration (TGA), categorizes sofosbuvir as class B1: “Drugs which have been 
taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the 
frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed.” 
Altogether, this information motivated us to investigate whether the chemical structure of sofosbuvir possesses 
anti-ZIKV activity. In the interest of disseminating public health information, we disclosed a preprint of our data 
showing the anti-ZIKV activity of sofosbuvir18. In the present investigation, we further studied the pharmacology 
of sofosbuvir in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We observed a direct inhibition of the viral RNA polymer-
ase and an increase in A-to-G mutations in the viral genome due to sofosbuvir treatment, highlighting a potential 
secondary use of sofosbuvir.
Materials and Methods
Reagents. 
The antiviral sofosbuvir (β 
-d-2′ 
-deoxy-2′ 
-α 
-fluoro-2′ 
-β 
-C-methyluridine) was donated by the 
BMK Consortium: Blanver Farmoquímica Ltda; Microbiológica Química e Farmacêutica Ltda; Karin Bruning 
& Cia. Ltda, (Taboão da Serra, São Paulo, Brazil). Ribavirin was received as a donation from the Instituto de 
Tecnologia de Farmacos (Farmanguinhos, Fiocruz). Sofosbuvir triphosphate (STP) (β 
-d-2′ 
-deoxy-2′ 
-α 
-fluoro-2′ 
-β 
-C-methyluridine triphosphate), ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) and AZT triphosphate (AZT-TP) were pur-
chased (Codontech.org, CA and Sierra Bioresearch, AZ). Interferon-alpha was purchased from R&D Bioscience. 
All small molecule inhibitors were dissolved in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently diluted at 
least 104-fold in culture or reaction medium before each assay. The final DMSO concentrations showed no cyto-
toxicity. The materials for cell culture were purchased from Thermo Scientific Life Sciences (Grand Island, NY), 
unless otherwise mentioned.
Cells. 
Human neuroblastoma (SH-Sy5y; ATCC) and baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were cultured in 
MEM:F-12 (1:1) and MEM, respectively. African green monkey kidney (Vero) and human hepatoma (Huh-7) 
cells were cultured in DMEM. Aedes albopictus cells (C6/36) were grown in L-15 medium supplemented with 
0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.75 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1.4 mM glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. 
The culture medium of each cell type was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, 
Utah), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μ 
g/mL streptomycin19,20. The mammalian cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% 
CO2, whereas the mosquito cells were maintained at 26 °C. Passages of the SH-sy5y cells included both adherent 
and non-adherent cells.
Virus. 
ZIKV was isolated from a serum sample of a confirmed case from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This sample 
was received and diagnosed by the Reference Laboratory for Flavivirus, Fiocruz, Brazilian Ministry of Health, 
as part of the surveillance system against arboviruses3. Brazilian ZIKV was originally isolated in C6/36 cells, 
titered by plaque-forming assays and further passaged at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The virus was 
passaged by inoculating C6/36 cells for 1 h at 26 °C. Next, the residual virus particles were removed by washing 
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were cultured for an additional 9 days. After each period, the 
cells were lysed by freezing and thawing and centrifuged at 1,500 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to remove cellular debris.
ZIKV was purified between fractions of 50% and 20% sucrose. The sucrose gradients were made in 40 mL 
ultracentrifuge tubes (Ultra-clear; Beckman, Fullerton, CA) in PBS without Ca++ and Mg++ (pH 7.4). The tubes 
were allowed to stand for 2 h at room temperature. Up to 20 mL of virus was added to each tube and centrifuged 
in an SW 28 rotor (Beckman) at 10,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C. The fractions were collected and assayed for total 
protein and for virus-induced hemagglutination (HA) analysis using turkey red blood cells (Fitzgerald Industries 
International, North Acton, MA). The fractions displaying HA activity (≥ 
16 UHA/50 μ 
L) were pooled and dia-
lyzed against PBS without Ca++ and Mg++ (pH 7.4) and 10% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. The virus pools were 
filtered through 0.22-μ 
m membranes (Chemicon, Millipore, Bedford, NY). The infectious virus titers were deter-
mined by plaque assays in BHK-21 cells, and the virus was stored at − 
70 °C for further studies.
Cytotoxicity assay. 
Monolayers of 104 BHK-21, 5 × 104 SH-Sy5y, 1.5 × 104 Vero or 1.5 × 104 Huh-7 cells in 
96-well plates were treated for 5 days with various concentrations of sofosbuvir or ribavirin as a control. Then, 
5 mg/ml 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) in DMEM was 
added to the cells in the presence of 0.01% of N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate (PMS). After incubating 
for 4 h at 37 °C, the plates were read in a spectrophotometer at 492 nm and 620 nm21. The 50% cytotoxic concen-
tration (CC50) was calculated by a non-linear regression analysis of the dose–response curves.
Plaque-forming assay. 
Monolayers of BHK-21 cells in 6-well plates were exposed to different dilutions of 
the supernatant from the yield-reduction assays for 1 h at 37 °C. Whenever virus yields were extremely low, viral 
particles from the supernatants were concentrated through 80-kDa centrifugal exclusion filters (Merk Millipore, 
Darmstadt, Germany) prior to plaque-forming assay. Next, the cells were washed with PBS, and culture medium 
containing 1% FBS and 3% carboxymethylcellulose (Fluka) (overlay medium) was added to cells. After 5 days at

37 °C, the monolayers were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with a 0.1% solution of crystal violet 
in 70% methanol, and the virus titers were calculated by scoring the plaque-forming units (PFU).
Yield-reduction assay. 
Monolayers of 104 BHK-21, 5 × 
 104 SH-Sy5y, 1.5 × 
 104 Vero or 1.5 × 
 104 Huh-7 cells 
in 96-well plates were infected with ZIKV at the indicated MOIs for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS 
to remove residual viruses, and various concentrations of sofosbuvir, or interferon-alpha as a positive control, 
in culture medium with 1% FBS were added. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, the cellular debris was cleared by 
centrifugation, and the virus titers in the supernatant were determined as PFU/mL. A non-linear regression anal-
ysis of the dose-response curves was performed to calculate the concentration at which each drug inhibited the 
plaque-forming activity of ZIKV by 50% (EC50).
Preparation of ZIKV RNA polymerase. 
ZIKV RNA polymerase (ZVRP) was obtained from 
ZIKV-infected BHK-21 cells. The cells were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 10 for 24 h, lysed with buffer 
A [containing 0.25 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% 
Triton X-100, 0.5 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 20% glycerol], sonicated and centrifuged at 
10,000 × 
 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × 
 g for 90 min at 4 °C 
and passed through two ion-exchange columns, DEAE- and phospho-cellulose19. Alternatively, the ZIKV NS5 
region encoding the nucleotides responsible for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity were 
cloned into the pET-41b+ 
 vector (Novagen) between the BamHI and SacI sites. ZVRP expression was induced 
by adding isopropyl β 
-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the E. coli strain BL21. The cells were lysed in buffer 
A, and the N-terminal GST-tag was used to purify the protein using a GST spin purification kit (ThermoFisher 
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA polymerase inhibition assay. 
ZVRP inhibition assays were adapted from a previous publication22. 
The reaction mixture for ZVRP activity measurements was composed of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.4 mM of 
each ribonucleotide (ATP, GTP, CTP and labelled UTP), 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM MgCl2, and 500 ng of 
ZIKV genomic RNA or cell extracts. The ZIKV RNA was obtained using a QIAmp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, 
Dusseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except for the use of the RNA carrier. The 
reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of the drugs. The reactions were 
stopped with addition of EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mM.
The labeled UTP mentioned above represents an equimolar ratio between biotinylated-UTP and 
digoxigenin-UTP (DIG-UTP) (both from Roche Life Sciences, Basel, Switzerland). The detection of incorporated 
labeled UTP nucleotides was performed by an amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (ALPHA; 
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). In brief, streptavidin-donor and anti-DIG-acceptor beads were incubated with the 
stopped reaction mixture for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the plates containing the mixtures were read in an 
EnSpire® 
 multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer). Different types of blank controls were used, such as reaction 
mixtures without cellular extracts and a control reaction mixture without inhibitor and beads. In addition, the 
extract from mock-infected cells was also assayed to evaluate the presence of RNA-dependent RNA polymer-
ase activity unrelated to ZIKV. Non-linear regression curves were generated to calculate the IC50 values for the 
dose-response effects of the compounds.
Antiviral activity in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) 
and brain organoids. 
NSCs and brain organoids derived from human iPS cells were prepared as previously 
described23. The NSCs (20 × 
 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were infected at MOIs of either 1.0 or 10 for 2 h at 
37 °C. Next, the cells were washed, and fresh medium containing sofosbuvir was added. The cells were treated 
daily with sofosbuvir at the indicated concentrations. The NSCs were observed daily for 8 days after infection. 
Virus titers were determined from the culture supernatant using a plaque-forming assay. The cell supernatant was 
also used for ZIKV genome analysis. Cell death was measured by adding 2 μ 
M CellEvent caspase-3/7 reagent and 
the fluorescent dye ethidium homodimer23 at days 4 and 8, when the culture supernatants were collected. Images 
were acquired with an Operetta high-content imaging system with a 20x objective and high numerical apertures 
(NA) (PerkinElmer, USA). The data were analyzed using the high-content image analysis software Harmony 5.1 
(PerkinElmer, USA). Seven independent fields were evaluated from triplicate wells per experimental condition.
Brain organoids were infected with ZIKV at 3 × 
 105 PFU/mL for 2 h, and the medium containing virus par-
ticles was then replaced with fresh medium. Sofosbuvir was added to the fresh medium daily for one week. The 
culture supernatant was collected to monitor virus infectivity and for RNA sequencing.
Comparative molecular modeling. 
The amino acid sequence encoding ZVRP (UniProtKB ID: B3U3M3) 
was obtained from the EXPASY proteomic portal24 (http://ca.expasy.org/). The template search was performed 
using the Blast server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with the Protein Data Bank25 (PDB; http://www.
pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do) as the database and the default options. The T-COFFEE algorithm was used to gen-
erate a multiple alignment between the amino acid sequences of the template proteins and ZVRP. Subsequently, 
the construction of the SFV-ZVRP complex was performed using MODELLER 9.16 software26, which employs 
spatial restriction techniques based on the 3D-template structure. The preliminary model was refined in the same 
software, using three cycles of the default optimization protocol. The structural evaluation of the model was then 
performed using two independent algorithms in the SAVES server (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES_3/): 
PROCHECK software27 (stereochemical quality analysis) and VERIFY 3D28 (compatibility analysis between the 
3D model and its own amino acid sequence by assigning a structural class based on its location and environment 
and by comparing the results with those of crystal structures).

Genome assembly. 
A 0.3-mL aliquot of supernatant containing ZIKV (at least 2 × 
 105 PFU) was filtered 
through 0.22-μ 
m filters to remove residual cells. The viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit 
(Qiagen®) with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen®) treatment, omitting carrier RNA. Double-stranded cDNA libraries 
were constructed using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT kit (Illumina®) with Ribo-zero treatment according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The library size distribution was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent®) 
with a High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent®), and the quantification was performed using a 7500 Real-time PCR 
System (Applied Biosystems®) with a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Paired-end sequenc-
ing (2 × 
 300 bp) was performed with a MiSeq Reagent kit v3 (Illumina®). The sequences obtained were preproc-
essed using the PRINSEQ software to remove reads smaller than 50 bp and sequences with scores of lower quality 
than a Phred quality score of 20. Paired-End reAd merger (PEAR) software was used to merge and extend the 
paired-end Illumina reads using the default parameters29,30. The extended reads were analyzed against the Human 
Genome Database using the DeconSeq program, with an identity and coverage cutoff of 70%, to remove human 
RNA sequences31. Non-human reads were analyzed against all GenBank viral genomes (65 052 sequences) using 
the BLAST software with a 1e-5 e-value cutoff. The sequences rendering a genome were assembled with SPAdes 
3.7.1 software32 followed by a reassembly with the CAP3 program33.
Sequence comparisons. 
The sequences encoding the C-terminal portion of the RNA polymerase from 
members of the Flaviviridae family were acquired from the complete sequences deposited in GenBank. An align-
ment was performed using the ClustalW algorithm in the Mega 6.0 software. The sequences were analyzed using 
the neighbor-joining method with pairwise deletion and a bootstrap of 1,000 replicates, and the P distances were 
registered. The sequences were also analyzed for the mean evolutionary rate.
Statistical analysis. 
All assays were performed and codified by one professional. Subsequently, a different 
professional analyzed the results before the identification of the experimental groups. This approach was used 
to keep the pharmacological assays blind. All experiments were carried out at least three independent times, 
including technical replicates in each assay. The dose-response curves used to calculate the EC50 and CC50 values 
were generated by Excel for Windows. The dose-response curves used to calculate the IC50 values were produced 
by Prism GraphPad software 5.0. The equations to fit the best curve were generated based on R2 values ≥ 
 0.9. 
ANOVA tests were also used, with P values < 
 0.05 considered statistically significant. The statistical analyses 
specific to each software program used in the bioinformatics analysis are described above.
Results
Sofosbuvir fits into the ZVRP predicted structure. 
The RNA polymerase structures from WNV (PDB 
#2HFZ)34, JEV (PDB #4K6M)35, DENV (PDB #5DTO)36 and HCV (PDB #4WTG)37 share 72, 70, 68, and 25% 
sequence identity, respectively, with the orthologous ZIKV enzyme. Despite its relatively low sequence identity to 
ZIKV, the HCV enzyme structure is complexed with sofosbuvir, and the amino acids residues that interact with 
the drug are highly conserved (approximately 80%) among the members of the Flaviviridae family37. The region 
encoding the C-terminal portion of the Flaviviridae RNA polymerase contains around 800 amino acid residues. 
Of these, we have highlighted in yellow those that are identical among members of the Flaviviridae family (see 
Supplementary Material 1). The residues critical for RDRP activity are conserved among different viral species 
and strains, including an African ZIKV strain from the 1950 s and those circulating currently, DENV and differ-
ent genotypes of HCV (see Supplementary Material 1)38.
Based on the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains, we constructed a 3D model of the orthologous 
ZIKV enzyme (Fig. 1). Sofosbuvir was predicted to be located among the palm and fingers region of ZIKV RNA 
polymerase (Fig. 1A), an area important for coordinating the incorporation of incoming nucleotides into the new 
strand of RNA37. Consequently, the amino acid residues relevant to the sofosbuvir interaction are some of those 
critical for natural nucleotide incorporation and thus RDRP activity (Fig. 1B)37.
Sofosbuvir inhibits ZVRP in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Next, we evaluated whether sofosbuvir 
triphosphate (STP), the bioactive compound, could inhibit ZIKV RDRP activity. Fractions containing the ZIKV 
RDRP activity were partially purified from infected cells19. STP inhibited ZIKV RDRP activity with an IC50 value 
of 0.38 ± 
 0.03 μ 
M (Fig. 2A). Ribavirin-triphosphate (RTP) and AZT-TP were used as positive and negative con-
trols, respectively (Fig. 2A). RTP and AZT-TP exhibited IC50 values of 0.21 ± 
 0.06 and > 
10 μ 
M, respectively 
(Fig. 2A). Moreover, the recombinant expression of the C-terminal portion of ZVRP confirmed the STP antiviral 
activity, with an IC50 value of 0.61 ± 0.08 μ 
M (Fig. 2B). The AZT-TP and RTP IC50 values for recombinant ZVRP 
were > 
10 and 0.62 ± 
 0.05 μ 
M, respectively (Fig. 2B). Of note, the small discrepancy observed in the STP IC50 
values against the partially purified and recombinant ZVRP could be because the total protein content was used 
to normalize the assay conditions; therefore, the purified recombinant preparation possessed a higher specific 
activity. Altogether, the data from Fig. 2 confirmed the molecular modeling prediction that sofosbuvir docks onto 
the ZVRP structure, revealing that the chemical structure of sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV RDRP activity.
Sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in a cell lineage-, MOI- and dose-dependent manner. 
 
Before investigating ZIKV susceptibility to sofosbuvir using cell-based assays, a Brazilian ZIKV isolate was char-
acterized for further use as a reference strain for the experimental virology. The full-length viral genome was 
sequenced (GenBank accession #KX197205), and the characteristic plaque-forming units (PFU) and cytopathic 
effects (CPE) were determined in BHK-21 cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Another concern was to establish 
whether another plaque-forming viral agent was co-isolated with ZIKV, which could result in a misleading inter-
pretation of the antiviral activity. A metagenomic analysis revealed that ZIKV was the only full-length genome of 
a plaque-forming virus detected in BHK-21 cells (see Supplementary Material 2).

Figure 1. Putative ZIKV RNA polymerase in complex with sofosbuvir. Based on the crystal structure of the 
HCV RNA polymerase in complex with sofosbuvir diphosphate (PDB accession #4WTG), the putative structure 
of the ZVRP was constructed. Using the T-COFFEE server, the amino acid sequence of the ZVRP (UniProtKB 
ID: B3U3M3) was aligned with orthologous RNA polymerases from other members of the Flaviviridae family, 
specifically hepatitis C virus (HCV; PDB #4WTG, West Nile virus (WNIV; PDB #2HFZ), Japanese encephalitis 
virus (JEV; PDB #4K6M), and dengue virus (DENV; PDB #5DTO). The MODELLER 9.16 software was used to 
build a 3D model of ZIKV RNA polymerase, with subsequent refinement performed using three cycles of the 
default optimization protocol. The structural evaluation of the model was performed using two independent 
algorithms, PROCHECK software and VERIFY 3D. (A) The 3D model of ZIKV RNA polymerase is presented. 
(B) The residues presumably required for the interaction of ZVRP with sofosbuvir and Mg++ ions.
Figure 2. Sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV RDRP activity. Cell extracts from ZIKV-infected cells (A) or recombinant 
ZVRP (B) were assayed for RDRP activity using viral RNA as the template and labeled UTP as the tracer. 
Biotinylated-UTP and digoxigenin-UTP were detected by ALPHA technology using an EnSpire® multimode 
plate reader (PerkinElmer). The molecules assayed were sofosbuvir triphosphate (STP), ribavirin triphosphate 
(RTP) and AZT triphosphate (AZT-TP). As a control, the RDRP activity was measured in extracts from mock-
infected cells (mock). The data represent means ± SEM of five independent experiments.

The sofosbuvir phosphoramidate prodrug must be converted to its triphosphate analog in the cellular envi-
ronment to become active. Despite a general perception that this process is an exclusive feature of hepatocytes17, 
sofosbuvir may also become active within neuroepithelial stem cells39. Indeed we investigated whether sofosbuvir 
inhibits ZIKV replication in different cellular systems. BHK-21, SH-Sy5y, Huh-7 or Vero cells were inoculated at 
different MOIs and treated with various concentrations of sofosbuvir. The supernatants from these cells were col-
lected, and the infectious virus progeny were titered. Sofosbuvir induced an MOI- and dose-dependent inhibition 
of ZIKV replication (Fig. 3A, Tables 1 and 2, and see Supplementary Fig. S2A–D). The potency and efficiency to 
inhibit ZIKV replication were higher in Huh-7 and SH-Sy5y cellsthan in BHK-21 cells (Fig. 3A and Table 1 and 
2, and see Supplementary Fig. S2A–C). Of note, even high concentrations of sofosbuvir did not inhibit ZIKV rep-
lication in Vero cells, indicating a cell-dependent inhibition of ZIKV replication (Fig. 3A and Tables 1 and 2, and

The sofosbuvir cytotoxicity was also cell type-dependent (Tables 1 and 2). Our results indicate that the selec-
tivity index (SI; which represents the ratio between the CC50 and EC50 values) for sofosbuvir varied from 184 to 
1191 (Tables 1 and 2) – being safer at an MOI of 0.5 in the hepatoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. For compar-
ison, the SI values for sofosbuvir were almost 30 times higher than for ribavirin (Table 1). Our data indicate that 
the sofosbuvir chemical structure possesses anti-ZIKV activity.
Sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in human primary NSCs and brain organoids. 
Since the 
results regarding the pharmacologic activity of sofosbuvir against ZIKV replication in lineage cells were promis-
ing, we next investigated whether sofosbuvir could be neuroprotective in a cellular model that corresponds to the 
early stages of brain development23. Human iPS cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) were infected with ZIKV 
and treated with sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir produced a pronounced inhibition of ZIKV replication in NSCs chal-
lenged with MOIs of 1.0 or 10 after 4 to 8 days of infection (Fig. 4A), as only marginal virus titers were detected 
in sofosbuvir-treated cells. This drastic reduction in viral replication in sofosbuvir-treated NSCs impaired 
ZIKV-mediated neuropathogenesis by inducing cell death. Whereas ZIKV-infected NSCs exhibited considerable 
levels of caspase-3/7 activation and plasma membrane permeability at 8 days post infection, sofosbuvir signifi-
cantly protected these cells from death (Fig. 5, and see Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).
Subsequently, we used ZIKV-infected brain organoids as a three-dimensional model to assess the antiviral 
activity of sofosbuvir. Brain organoids have been used as a sophisticated cellular model to evaluate the impact 
of ZIKV on early brain development and as a translational system for in-depth investigations of the cellular and 
molecular events related to microcephaly23. We again observed a pronounced reduction of ZIKV production 
due to sofosbuvir treatment (Fig. 4B). Altogether, these data indicate that sofosbuvir is effective against ZIKV in 
neuronal cell systems relevant to the physiopathology of the virus.
Observational analysis of mutations in the ZIKV genome associated with sofosbuvir treatment. 
 
Systematically, we observed that sofosbuvir was more effective in reducing ZIKV infectivity than viral RNA 
levels in the supernatant of the cultures (Fig. 6). Independent of whether sofosbuvir activity was measured in 
ZIKV-infected Huh-7 cells, NSCs or BHK-21 cells, a concentration of 2 μ 
M of this drug was in general almost two 
times more potent in inhibiting ZIKV-induced cell death and viral infectivity than viral RNA production (Fig. 6). 
These data suggest that virus particles containing genomic RNA may be produced under sofosbuvir treatment but 
that these particles are unable to efficiently infect new cells and produce cytopathogenicity.
We thus sequenced the ZIKV genome from infected Huh-7 cells, NSCs and brain organoids treated with 
sofosbuvir at 2 μ 
M, a concentration that does not allow for viral RNA extinction. The frequencies of the over-
all transition mutations in sofosbuvir-treated sequences was significantly increased when compared to 
Figure 4. Sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in human iPS cell-derived NSCs and brain organoids. NSCs 
(A) were infected at the indicated MOIs and brain organoids (B) were infected with 5 × 107 PFU/mL of ZIKV. 
The ZIKV-infected cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of sofosbuvir for different periods of 
time post infection. At the indicated time points, the culture supernatants were collected, and the virus was 
titered by plaque-forming assays. The data represent means ± SEM of five independent experiments. The virus 
production in the presence of the treatments was significantly reduced when compared to untreated cells 
(P < 0.01).

control sequences (P < 
 0.05) for all infected host cell models (Table 3). More specifically, the increased muta-
tion frequency was greater for A-to-G changes, which represented 80 ± 
 5% of all transition mutations in the 
sofosbuvir-treated sequences (Table 3). In addition, A-to-G mutations were approximately five times more abun-
dant in sofosbuvir-treated sequences than in control sequences (Table 3). Of note, there were no significant differ-
ences in the frequencies of other transitions and transversions between sofosbuvir-treated and control sequences. 
Our observations indicate that in addition to its direct inhibition of the ZIKV RNA polymerase, sofosbuvir may 
also increase mutations in the viral genome.
Discussion
ZIKV is a member of the Flaviviridae family, along with other clinically relevant viruses such as DENV, WNV, 
JEV and HCV. In this family, ZIKV was considered to be a virus causing only mild and self-limited infec-
tions4. However, based on clinical evidence and experimental data, ZIKV infection has been associated with 
Figure 5. Sofosbuvir protects human iPS cell-derived NSCs from ZIKV-induced cell death. NSCs were 
labeled for activated caspase-3/7 (A,C) and cell permeability (B,D) 4 or 8 days after infection. The data 
represent means ± SEM of five independent experiments. ***indicates P < 0.001 for the comparison between

neurological-related morbidities, with impacts on the development of the human nervous system and neurologi-
cal complications in adults7,8,23,40–43. Antiviral treatment options are thus required to block viral replication. Here, 
we show that uridine nucleotide analog anti-HCV drug sofosbuvir possesses anti-ZIKV activity.
Several ongoing studies have demonstrated the anti-ZIKV activity of clinically approved drugs10–15,18. Here, we 
show that sofosbuvir-triphosphate inhibits ZVRP in a dose-dependent fashion. The predicted ZVRP structure sug-
gests that sofosbuvir binds to amino acid residues that are critical for ribonucleotide incorporation, such as Arg473, 
Gly538, Trp539, and Lys691. The fluoride radical in the sofosbuvir ribosyl moiety is coordinated by Asn612, an 
interaction that is involved with the drug selectivity to the viral RDRP, which may avoid nonspecific effects towards 
the cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Lys458 seems to be the docking residue for the uridine analog.
Next, using cell-based assays, we demonstrated that sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in BHK-21, SH-Sy5y 
and Huh-7 cells. Although ZIKV replication was susceptible to sofosbuvir in these cells, the magnitude of antivi-
ral potency and efficiency varied among these cells. Taking as a reference an MOI of 1.0, the potency of antiviral 
activity observed in hepatoma cells was five times higher, and in neuroblastoma cells was two times higher, than 
that observed in BHK-21 cells. This is consistent with the demonstration that sofosbuvir converts to its bioactive 
form in liver cells17. Most recently, another group also demonstrated that sofosbuvir may become active in human 
neuroepithelial stem cells using functional assays against ZIKV39. Indeed, we further confirmed that human iPS 
cell-derived NSCs and brain organoids can be protected by sofosbuvir, even when these cells are challenged with 
exceedingly high MOIs. Brain organoids represent a translational three-dimensional cell culture model for the 
study of ZIKV-associated microcephaly23. Therefore, the antiviral activity observed by sofosbuvir using human 
neural progenitors and brain organoids represents a pragmatic demonstration of the potential secondary use of this 
clinically approved anti-HCV drug, because it impairs ZIKV neuropathogenesis, as shown here and by others39.
On the other hand, we observed no inhibition of viral replication with even 50 μ 
M of sofosbuvir in Vero cells. 
Similarly, in a recent study from Eyer et al.12, African ZIKV susceptibility to sofosbuvir was screened in Vero 
cells, and this compound did not emerge as a potential hit. Although Eyer et al.12 and our group used different 
viral strains, we obtained similar results in Vero cells. Interestingly, sofosbuvir is a substrate for glycoprotein-P44. 
Proteomic data indicate that Vero cells express this multi-drug resistance ABC-transporter, which may cause the 
efflux of sofosbuvir from the cell45–47.
Using different read outs to monitor sofosbuvir anti-ZIKV activity, we observed that this drug reduced virus 
infectivity more than it inhibited the production of viral RNA. Unlike most antiviral nucleoside analogs48 and 
despite the presence of the 3′ 
-OH radical in its chemical structure37, sofosbuvir acts as a chain terminator. To 
impair the incorporation of the incoming nucleotides, the 2′ 
-F radical disrupts the hydrogen bonding network37. 
Similarly, the 2′ 
-F in sofosbuvir forms a hydrogen bond with Asn612, which may disrupt the hydrogen bonding of 
incoming nucleotides to ZIKV RNA polymerase. Indeed, our results indicate that sofosbuvir directly inhibits the 
viral RNA polymerase. In addition to this mechanism, ZIKV genome sequences from sofosbuvir-treated cells had 
an increased rate of A-to-G mutations when compared to untreated cells. It is plausible to interpret that both the 
direct inhibition of ZIKV RNA polymerase and induction of mutations in the viral genome may be triggered by 
sofosbuvir. For instance, ribavirin, another ribonucleoside analog, may inhibit viral replication by direct targeting 
the viral RNA polymerase and by the induction of error-prone replication49,50.
ZIKV-associated microcephaly and GBS highlight that antiviral interventions are urgently needed. Our data 
reveal that a clinically approved drug possesses antiviral activity against ZIKV and is active in cells derived from 
peripheral organs and the CNS. Sofosbuvir may induce error-prone ZIKV replication. Together, our data high-
light the potential secondary use of sofosbuvir, an anti-HCV drug, against ZIKV.
