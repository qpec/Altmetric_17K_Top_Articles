Purpose
The incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV)–positive oropharyngeal cancers has risen rapidly in
recent decades among men in the United States. We investigated the US population–level effect of
prophylactic HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV infection, the principal cause of HPV-positive
oropharyngeal cancers.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study of men and women 18 to 33 years of age (N = 2,627) within the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 to 2014, a representative sample of the US
population. Oral HPV infection with vaccine types 16, 18, 6, or 11 was compared by HPV vaccination
status, as measured by self-reported receipt of at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. Analyses
accounted for the complex sampling design and were adjusted for age, sex, and race. Statistical
significance was assessed using a quasi-score test.
Results
Between 2011 and 2014, 18.3% of the US population 18 to 33 years of age reported receipt of at
least one dose of the HPV vaccine before the age of 26 years (29.2% in women and 6.9% in men;
P , .001). The prevalence of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated
versus unvaccinated individuals (0.11% v 1.61%; Padj = .008), corresponding to an estimated 88.2%
(95% CI, 5.7% to 98.5%) reduction in prevalence after model adjustment for age, sex, and race. Notably,
the prevalence of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated versus un-
vaccinated men (0.0% v 2.13%; Padj = .007). Accounting for vaccine uptake, the population-level effect
of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was 17.0% overall, 25.0% in women,
and 6.9% in men.
Conclusion
HPV vaccination was associated with reduction in vaccine-type oral HPV prevalence among young
US adults. However, because of low vaccine uptake, the population-level effect was modest overall
and particularly low in men.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer caused by
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has in-
creased rapidly in recent decades in men in the
United States as well as numerous other developed
countries worldwide.1 Furthermore, HPV-positive
oropharyngeal cancer is projected to become the
most common HPV-caused cancer in the United
States by 2020, with the majority of the burden in
men.1 More than 70% of the approximately 12,000
oropharyngeal cancers diagnosed annually in the
United States are caused by HPV, with approxi-
mately 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal can-
cers caused by HPV16 and the remainder caused
by other oncogenic HPV types.1-3 Given the
absence of screening and secondary prevention
strategies, prophylactic HPV vaccination has the
greatest potential to prevent HPV-positive oro-
pharyngeal cancers.4
Prophylactic HPV vaccination with the biva-
lent (HPV16/18), quadrivalent (HPV16/18/6/11),
or nonavalent (HPV16/18/6/11/31/33/45/52/58)
vaccine is currently recommended for US females
and males (quadrivalent and nonavalent) ages 9 to

 26 years.5 HPV vaccination was recommended for routine use in US
females in 2006, permissive use in US males in 2009, and routine use
in US males in 2011. These vaccines are indicated for the prevention
of genital warts (caused by HPV types 6 and 11) and cervical, anal,
vulvar, and vaginal precancers and cancers in females and genital
warts and anal precancer and cancer in males.5 Randomized clinical
trials demonstrate . 90% vaccine efficacy in the prevention of
anogenital HPV infections and precancerous lesions.5,6 Surveillance
studies also show significant population-level reductions in genital
HPV prevalence among young US females in the postlicensure era.7,8
In contrast, few studies have evaluated the population-level effect of
HPV vaccination on oral HPV infections.9-11
Herein, we provide a surveillance report of the population-
level effect of prophylactic HPV vaccination on the burden of oral
HPV infections in young US women and men.
METHODS
We compared oral HPV prevalence in vaccinated versus unvaccinated men
and women 18 to 33 years of age within the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014.12
The NHANES is a representative cross-sectional, stratified, multistage
probability sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US population.12
In the NHANES Mobile Exam Center (MEC),13 all participants 14 to
69 years of age provided a 10-mL scope/saline oral rinse and gargle sample.
DNA from oral rinses was evaluated for the presence of 37 HPV genotypes
using PGMY09/11 polymerase chain reaction and Roche Linear Array
genotyping.13 Demographic and behavioral factors were collected through
an audio computer-assisted self-interview during the MEC visit.12 Infor-
mation on HPV vaccination (receipt, age at vaccination, and doses) was
collected from participants 9 to 59 years of age by interviewers during the
household visit.12 Public-use data on both oral HPV infection and vac-
cination were available in individuals 18 to 59 years of age (Appendix Fig
A1, online only).
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were restricted to 2,627 individuals 18 to 33 years of age;
33 years was the oldest observed age for individuals who were vaccinated
through 26 years of age, the oldest recommended age for vaccination in the
United States. Individuals who received at least one dose were considered
vaccinated.
All analyses were conducted in SAS (Cary, NC) and SAS-Callable
SUDAAN (RTI International, Raleigh, NC). The primary outcome was oral
HPV16/18/6/11 prevalence, given the predominant use of the quadrivalent
vaccine in the United States through 2014.5,7 Analyses accounted for the
complex sampling design and potential bias from exclusions (Fig A1)
through use of MEC sample weights, repost-stratified to match the age-by-
sex-by-race US population distribution. Because of the inclusion of two
NHANES cycles in the analyses, per NHANES analytic guidelines, we used
the sample weights of each NHANES cycles divided by two. Given the
nonrandomized comparisons, the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups dif-
fered by demographic and behavioral factors (Table 1), which substantially
diminished upon adjustment for age (at NHANES participation), sex, and
race (Appendix Tables A1 and A2, online only). Thus, oral HPV comparisons
by vaccination status were conducted using binary logistic regression, with
model adjustment for age, sex, and race. As alternative analyses, we also
used propensity weighting (for vaccination by age, sex, and race), which
incorporates fewer assumptions but may have lower statistical power than
model adjustment.14 Additional adjustment for socioeconomic status factors,
such as education, did not materially change the results (data not shown).
Comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are
presented as infection prevalence and percent reduction in prevalence
([unvaccinated minus vaccinated/unvaccinated] 3 100). Prevaccine-era
oral HPV prevalence data are not available in the US population; thus, we
used the observed prevalence in unvaccinated individuals as the best-
available surrogate for prevaccine-era oral HPV prevalence. We then es-
timated the total number of infections in the absence of HPV vaccination
in the US population (US population size 3 prevalence in unvaccinated),
the number of preventable infections at 100% vaccination levels (US
population size 3 prevalence in vaccinated), and the number of potentially
vaccine-prevented infections at current HPV vaccine–uptake levels (US
population size of vaccinated individuals 3 prevalence difference between
unvaccinated and vaccinated). As a measure of the population-level effect
of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV infection, we estimated the
proportion of potentially vaccine-prevented infections at the current HPV
vaccine–uptake levels (number of potentially vaccine-prevented infections/
total number of infections in the absence of HPV vaccination).
Given the sparsity of oral HPV outcomes in the vaccinated group,
statistical comparisons were conducted using a quasi-score test.15 Spe-
cifically, the score test and the corresponding P value were computed under
the null hypothesis of no difference in oral HPV prevalence between the
vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, which allowed pooling of the two groups,
thus ameliorating small event rates in either group. Prior simulation studies
showed better performance of the score test compared with standard Wald
tests for obtaining accurate P values under studies using logistic regressionwith
small event rates, while also accounting for clustered sampling designs.15 We
used logistic regression modeling through either model adjustment or pro-
pensity adjustment to account for the imbalance in confounders between the
vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals; we then computed the score test
P value for the comparison of oral HPV prevalence between vaccinated and
unvaccinated individuals. Using the model-adjustment approach, predicted
margins were computed to obtain adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios
(vaccinated v unvaccinated), which are directly standardized to the distribution
in the United States of the covariates used in the logistic modeling. Statistical
significance was assessed at a two-sided P , .05.
RESULTS
Between 2011 and 2014, 18.3% of the US population 18 to 33 years
of age reported receipt of at least one dose of HPV vaccine through
the age of 26 years. Vaccination rates were significantly higher in
women than men (29.2% v 6.9%; P , .001). Vaccinated and
unvaccinated individuals significantly differed by demographic and
behavioral characteristics in unadjusted analyses (Table 1). However,
characteristics were similar upon adjustment for age, sex, and race
through either model adjustment (Appendix Table A1) or pro-
pensity weighting (Appendix Table A2).
Oral HPV prevalence was assessed at an average of 4.1 years
after vaccination. The prevalence of vaccine-type oral HPV in-
fections (HPV16/18/6/11) was significantly reduced in vaccinated
versus unvaccinated individuals 18 to 33 years of age (0.11% v
1.61%; model-adjusted P = .008; Table 2). This corresponded to an
adjusted (model adjustment for age, sex, and race) prevalence ratio
of 8.45 for unvaccinated versus vaccinated individuals (95% CI, 1.06
to 67.22) and an estimated 88.2% (95% CI, 5.7% to 98.5%) re-
duction in vaccine-type infections among vaccinated individuals.
Prevalence of oral HPV16, which accounts for approximately 90% of
HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers, was also nonsignificantly re-
duced in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals (0.11% v 0.94%;
model-adjusted P = .063). In contrast, prevalence of 33 nonvaccine
HPV types was similar between vaccinated versus unvaccinated
individuals (Table 2: 3.98% v 4.74%; model-adjusted P = .24). Event

*Binary logistic regression modeling was initially conducted with oral HPV infection as the outcome and age, sex, and race as predictors to account for the imbalance in confounders between vaccinated and
unvaccinated individuals, after which the score test P value was computed for the comparison of oral HPV prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The binary logistic regression models were
adjusted for age (linear), sex, and race (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other races). Models in women and men were adjusted for age (linear) and race (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and other races). Models for HPV16 in men were adjusted for age (linear) and race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other races) to avoid zero cells.
†The logistic propensity model had vaccination as the outcome and age (linear), sex, and race (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other races) as the predictors. Predicted odds from the propensity
model were used to modify the poststratified National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mobile Exam Center weights of the unvaccinated individuals, which were then used as weights for the comparison of oral
HPV prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals using a quasi-score test. Sex-specific propensity models included age (linear) and race (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other
races).

Effect of HPV Vaccination on Oral HPV Infections in the US
 protection (HPV31/33/45) were too low for reliable estimation
(Appendix Table A3, online only).
Results were similar in sex-stratified as well as propensity-
adjusted analyses, albeit at lower significance levels (Table 2).
Notably, prevalence of vaccine-type oral HPV infections (HPV16/
18/6/11) was significantly reduced in vaccinated men versus un-
vaccinated men (Table 2: 0.0% v 2.13%; model-adjusted P = .007).
We estimated the population-level effect of HPV vaccination
on the burden of vaccine-type oral HPV infections between 2011
and 2014 in the US population of individuals 18 to 33 years of age.
These estimates combined the reduction in prevalence among vac-
cinated individuals with current HPV vaccination rates (Fig 1). HPV
vaccination potentially prevented an estimated 169,650 (95% CI,
90,668 to 248,862) oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections, including 76,570
(95% CI, 7,665 to 145,770) among women and 44,403 (95% CI,
19,919 to 68,750) among men. The corresponding estimate of
population-level effect was 17.0% overall, 25.0% in women, and 6.9%
in men. For HPV16, an estimated 93,873 (95% CI, 27,749 to 158,298)
infections were potentially prevented (52,585 [95% CI, 210,185 to
115,241] among women and 23,348 [95% CI, 4,301 to 42,315] among
men), corresponding to a population-level effect of 16.2% overall,
23.4% in women, and 6.9% in men.
DISCUSSION
We evaluated the effect of HPV vaccination on the population-level
burden of oral HPV infections in the United States. HPV vacci-
nation was associated with an estimated 88% reduction in prev-
alence of vaccine-type oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections among
vaccinated young adults in the United States. However, because of
a vaccination rate of only 18.3% between 2011 and 2014 among
individuals 18 to 33 years of age, the population-level effect of HPV
vaccination on oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was a modest 17.0%.
Our results are similar to a prior study in Costa Rica that reported
a 93% reduction in HPV16/18 prevalence in women who received the
bivalent HPV vaccine.9,11 A recent study by Hirth et al10 also used
NHANES data (2009 to 2014, individuals ages 18 to 30 years) and
concluded that vaccine-type oral HPV prevalence was lower in in-
dividuals who received the HPV vaccine compared with unvaccinated
individuals.10 Compared with the study by Hirth et al,10 the unique
aspects of our study include the use of statistical methods optimal for
the sparse sample sizes of oral HPV infections, adjustment for
important confounders (such as age, sex, and race), the conduct of
sex-stratified analyses, and an evaluation of the population-level
effect of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV infections.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to report a significant
reduction (100%) in prevalence of vaccine-type oral HPV infections
in vaccinated men. This reduction in vaccine-type oral HPV in-
fections in vaccinated men is of particular importance because HPV-
positive oropharyngeal cancer incidence is three to five times higher
in men than inwomen worldwide.4 HPV vaccination is currently the
most promising prevention option to stem the rising tide of HPV-
positive oropharyngeal cancers in men. Unfortunately, low vaccine
uptake in adult men between 2011 and 2014 translated to a low
population-level effect of HPV vaccination (approximately 6.9%) in
men. We note that vaccine uptake in US boys 14 to 17 years of age
increased in 2015, reaching 49.8%.16 Nonetheless, uptake in males
has remained significantly lower than in females, which in turn has
not achieved the high rates needed for herd immunity to males.16
We note the limitations of our study. The nonrandomized
comparisons of infection prevalence between vaccinated and un-
vaccinated individuals preclude a causal interpretation of our results.
Despite the inclusion of two NHANES cycles, our analyses were
performed on the basis of sparse sample sizes for oral HPV infections,
particularly in vaccinated individuals. These sparse sample sizes partly
reflect the restriction of analyses to a narrow age range (predefined on
the basis of HPV vaccination recommendations),5 the rarity of oral
HPV prevalence compared with anogenital HPV prevalence,7 and
importantly, the high efficacy of HPV vaccination in reducing HPV
infections.6 The low oral HPV prevalence also precluded key sub-
group analyses, such as analyses stratified by age at vaccination,
vaccine doses, and time since vaccination as well as analyses of cross
protection against nonvaccine HPV types. Because of the sparsity of
data, we could not calculate adjusted estimates of the number of oral
HPV infections (in the absence of vaccination and at current vac-
cination levels) as well as of population-level effect. Also, our analyses
were performed on the basis of self-reported receipt of vaccination,
which may have resulted in misclassification.17 Nevertheless, this
misclassification would be expected to be nondifferential by oral HPV
prevalence status, which may have biased the effect of vaccination

Fig 1. Effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on the burden of vaccine-
type oral HPV infections in the US population of individuals 18 to 33 years of age,
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 to 2014. The bar graph shows
the estimated effect of prophylactic HPV vaccination on the burden of vaccine-type
oral HPV infections (HPV16/18/6/11) among individuals 18 to 33 years of age at
participation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 to 2014.
Results are shown overall as well as separately in men and women. Results are
presented as the total number of infections in the absence of HPV vaccination in
the US population: (US population size 3 prevalence in unvaccinated) = blue bars;
the number of preventable infections at 100% vaccination levels (US population
size 3 prevalence in vaccinated) = gold bars; and the number of potentially vaccine-
prevented infections at current HPV vaccine–uptake levels (US population size of
vaccinated individuals 3 prevalence difference between unvaccinated and vac-
cinated) = gray bars. As a measure of the population-level effect of HPV vaccination
on the burden of oral HPV infection, we estimated the proportion of potentially
vaccine-prevented infections at the current HPV vaccine–uptake levels (number of
potentially vaccine-prevented infections/total number of infections in the absence
of HPV vaccination). Prevalence estimates used for these computations were not
adjusted for any factors. The prevalence of individual vaccine-type HPV infections in
the US population of individuals 18 to 33 years of age was as follows: HPV16 = 0.79%,
HPV18 = 0.20%, HPV6 = 0.29%, and HPV11 = 0.14%.

 toward the null. Unlike cervical/vaginal HPV infection, for which
prevaccine-era prevalence estimates are available in NHANES and
other national surveys, there are no prevaccine-era prevalence data for
oral HPV infection in the US population. Consequently, we used the
observed prevalence of oral HPV infection in unvaccinated individuals
as the best-available surrogate for the prevaccine-era prevalence of
oral HPV infection, and then modeled the population-level effect of
vaccination on oral HPV infections. Despite these limitations, our
results have high global public health significance given the rapid
increases in recent decades in the incidence of oropharynx cancers,
particularly in men in the United States and numerous other de-
veloped countries, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan,
Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.1
Because of the absence of vaccine-efficacy trials, HPV vaccines
are not currently indicated for the prevention of oral HPV infection
and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Previous efforts to conduct
efficacy trials were thwarted by regulatory policy that required
clinically identifiable surrogate end points, such as precancers, which
are difficult to detect in the oropharynx. However, a recent report
from a US National Cancer Institute–International Agency for Re-
search on Cancer joint workshop endorsed prevention of incident
and persistent oral HPV16 as an acceptable end point for efficacy
trials.6 Such efficacy trials would support evidence-based recom-
mendations for the prevention of HPV-positive oropharyngeal
cancer and potentially enhance vaccine uptake in males.
In conclusion, HPV vaccination was associated with reduction
in vaccine-type oral HPV prevalence among young US adults.
However, because of low vaccine uptake, the population-level effect
was modest overall and particularly low in men.

*Binary logistic regression modeling was initially conducted with oral HPV infection as the outcome and age, sex, and race as predictors to account for the imbalance in confounders between vaccinated and
unvaccinated individuals, after which the score test P value was computed for the comparison of oral HPV prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Because vaccination status was pooled in the
score test P value computation, we did not derive adjusted prevalence estimates or measures of association, such as adjusted odds ratios. Binary logistic regression models were adjusted for age (linear), sex, and race
(Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other races), unless noted otherwise.
