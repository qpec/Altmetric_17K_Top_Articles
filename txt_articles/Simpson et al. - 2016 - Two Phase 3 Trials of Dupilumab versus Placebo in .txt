BACKGROUND
Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhib-
its signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be impor-
tant drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.
METHODS
In two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials of identical design (SOLO 1 
and SOLO 2), we enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose 
disease was inadequately controlled by topical treatment. Patients were randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive, for 16 weeks, subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg) 
or placebo weekly or the same dose of dupilumab every other week alternating 
with placebo. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had both 
a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator’s Global Assessment 
and a reduction of 2 points or more in that score from baseline at week 16.
RESULTS
We enrolled 671 patients in SOLO 1 and 708 in SOLO 2. In SOLO 1, the primary 
outcome occurred in 85 patients (38%) who received dupilumab every other week and 
in 83 (37%) who received dupilumab weekly, as compared with 23 (10%) who received 
placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The results were similar in 
SOLO 2, with the primary outcome occurring in 84 patients (36%) who received du-
pilumab every other week and in 87 (36%) who received dupilumab weekly, as com-
pared with 20 (8%) who received placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons). In addition, 
in the two trials, an improvement from baseline to week 16 of at least 75% on the 
Eczema Area and Severity Index was reported in significantly more patients who re-
ceived each regimen of dupilumab than in patients who received placebo (P<0.001 for 
all comparisons). Dupilumab was also associated with improvement in other clinical 
end points, including reduction in pruritus and symptoms of anxiety or depression 
and improvement in quality of life. Injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis were 
more frequent in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In two phase 3 trials of identical design involving patients with atopic dermatitis, 
dupilumab improved the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, including 
pruritus, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life, as compared 
with placebo. Trials of longer duration are needed to assess the long-term effec-
tiveness and safety of dupilumab. (Funded by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceu-

A
topic dermatitis is a chronic, re-
lapsing inflammatory skin disease that is 
characterized by the up-regulation of type 
2 immune responses (including those involving 
type 2 helper T cells),1,2 an impaired skin barrier, 
and increased Staphylococcus aureus colonization.3,4 
In patients with moderate-to-severe atopic der-
matitis, skin lesions can encompass a large body-
surface area and are frequently accompanied by 
intense, persistent pruritus, which leads to sleep 
deprivation, symptoms of anxiety or depression, 
and a poor quality of life.5-7 For patients with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, topical ther-
apies have limited efficacy, and systemic treat-
ments are associated with substantial toxic effects. 
Thus, there is an unmet need for effective and safe 
long-term medications for these patients.8,9
Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal an-
tibody that binds specifically to the shared alpha 
chain subunit of the interleukin-4 and interleu-
kin-13 receptors, thereby inhibiting the signaling 
of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, which are 
type 2 inflammatory cytokines that may be im-
portant drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such 
as atopic dermatitis and asthma.10-14 In support 
of this premise, early-phase trials of dupilumab 
showed efficacy in patients with atopic dermati-
tis,10,11,14,15 those with asthma,16,17 and those with 
chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis18 — all of 
which are conditions that have type 2 immuno-
logic signatures.13 Clinical improvements were 
associated with improvement of inflammatory 
pathways, including type 2 pathways, and nor-
malization of epidermal-barrier abnormalities.10,11 
Here we present the results of two phase 3 trials 
of dupilumab monotherapy (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2) 
in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermati-
tis whose disease was inadequately controlled by 
topical treatment or for whom topical treatment 
was medically inadvisable.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted two independent, randomized, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials 
of identical design to evaluate dupilumab in adults 
with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in North 
America, Europe, and Asia. The two-trial concept 
was designed to provide replication of results. We 
enrolled patients from October 28, 2014, to July 8, 
2015, in SOLO 1 and from December 3, 2014, to 
June 17, 2015, in SOLO 2. Data were not analyzed 
until after the statistical analysis plans were fi-
nalized on January 26, 2016.
Dupilumab or placebo was injected subcuta-
neously weekly or every other week for 16 weeks 
after a 35-day screening and washout period. 
Patients who were assigned to receive dupilumab 
every other week were given matching placebo 
on the off weeks in order to preserve the blind-
ing (see the Methods section in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org). Patients were required to 
apply moisturizers twice daily for at least 7 con-
secutive days before randomization and through-
out the trial period.
Topical or systemic rescue treatment to con-
trol unacceptable symptoms of atopic dermatitis 
could be used at the investigators’ discretion. 
Dupilumab or placebo was discontinued in pa-
tients who received systemic rescue treatment.
During the treatment period, patients had 
weekly clinical and safety assessments and collec-
tion of blood samples. After the treatment period, 
eligible patients could enter an ongoing main-
tenance trial (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02395133) or an 
open-label extension trial (LIBERTY AD MAINTAIN; 
NCT01949311). (Details about the follow-up stud-
ies are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.) 
For patients who were ineligible or unwilling to 
enter either trial, safety follow-up continued 
through week 28. The maintenance and open-
label extension studies are not yet complete, so 
data from those studies are not included in this 
report.
These trials were conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, In-
ternational Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable regu-
latory requirements. An independent data and 
safety monitoring committee conducted unblinded 
monitoring of patient safety. All the patients pro-
vided written informed consent before participa-
tion in the trial. The local institutional review 
board or ethics committee at each trial center 
oversaw trial conduct and documentation.
All the authors participated in interpretation of 
the data and provided input into the drafting of the 
manuscript, critical feedback, and final approval 
for submission of the manuscript for publication.

Two Trials of Dupilumab in Atopic Dermatitis
ceuticals. Editorial support was provided by medi-
cal writers who were paid by the sponsors. The 
authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness 
of the data and data analyses and for the fidelity 
of the trials to the protocols, available at NEJM.org.
Patients
Patients were eligible to participate in the trial if 
they were at least 18 years of age, had moderate-
to-severe atopic dermatitis — including a score of 
3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) on the Investigator’s 
Global Assessment (IGA; scores range from 0 to 4, 
with higher scores indicating more severe disease) 
— for which topical treatment provided inade-
quate control or was medically inadvisable, and 
had chronic atopic dermatitis (according to the 
consensus criteria of the American Academy of 
Dermatology19) for at least 3 years before screen-
ing. (Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio 
to receive, for 16 weeks, weekly subcutaneous 
injections of dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo or 
the same dose of dupilumab every other week 
alternating with placebo. Patients in the dupil-
umab groups received a 600-mg loading dose of 
dupilumab on day 1. Randomization was con-
ducted by means of a central interactive voice-
response system and was stratified according to 
disease severity (IGA score, 3 vs. 4) and region. 
Blinded, coded kits containing dupilumab or pla-
cebo were used to mask the assigned treatment.
Prohibited concomitant medications included 
topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors, 
immunomodulating biologic agents, systemic 
glucocorticoids, and nonsteroidal systemic im-
munosuppressants. Rescue treatment for atopic 
dermatitis could be provided to patients if 
medically necessary (i.e., to control unacceptable 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis). If the rescue 
medication was topical, the patient could con-
tinue the assigned regimen; however, if the rescue 
medication was systemic (e.g., systemic glucocor-
ticoids or nonsteroidal systemic immunosup-
pressive drugs), the trial regimen was immedi-
ately discontinued. (Detailed information about 
rescue treatment and prohibited concomitant 
medications is provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
End Points
End points were analyzed according to a pre-
specified hierarchy (see the Statistical Analysis 
section). The primary end point was the propor-
tion of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 (clear 
or almost clear)20 and a reduction from baseline 
of at least 2 points in the score at week 16. The 
proportion of patients who had an improvement 
from baseline at week 16 of at least 75% on the 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) was a 
key secondary end point (and was identified as a 
coprimary end point by regulators in the Euro-
pean Union and Japan). The EASI score assesses 
the severity and extent of erythema; induration, 
papulation, and edema; excoriations; and licheni-
fication.21,22 EASI scores range from 0 to 72, with 
higher scores indicating greater severity and ex-
tent of atopic dermatitis. (End-point descriptions 
are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
Other key secondary end points in the hierar-
chy were the proportions of patients with an 
improvement of at least 4 points at weeks 2, 4, 
and 16 or of at least 3 points at week 16 in the 
weekly average of peak scores for pruritus on a 
numerical rating scale that ranged from 0 to 10, 
with higher scores indicating more severe pruri-
tus, and the mean percent change in the peak 
score on the numerical rating scale for pruritus 
from baseline to week 16.23,24 Peak scores on the 
pruritus numerical rating scale were self-assessed 
by patients daily and were averaged over a week to 
create a weekly measurement; patients used an 
interactive voice-response system to record the 
peak score at screening and daily through week 16.
Additional secondary end points in the hier-
archy were the mean percent change from base-
line to week 16 on the EASI score, the Scoring 
Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score,25 and the 
Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) and the 
mean percent change from baseline to week 2 
on the pruritus numerical rating scale; the pro-
portion of patients with an improvement on the 
EASI of at least 50% (EASI-50) or at least 90% 
(EASI-90) at week 16; and the mean change from 
baseline to week 16 on the pruritus numerical 
rating scale, percent body-surface area affected, 
the score on the Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI),26,27 the score on the Patient-Oriented 
Eczema Measure (POEM),22,28 and the total score 
on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale

(HADS).29,30 Additional prespecified end points 
were the proportion of patients with an improve-
ment of at least 4 points (i.e., the minimal clini-
cally important difference) from baseline to 
week 16 in the scores on the DLQI (scores range 
from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating 
greater effect on quality of life) and the POEM 
(scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores 
indicating a greater symptom burden) and the 
proportion of patients with HADS anxiety 
(HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) subscores 
of less than 8 (on a scale from 0 to 21, with 
higher scores indicating a greater burden of anxi-
ety or depression symptoms) at week 16 among 
patients who had had a baseline HADS-A or 
HADS-D subscore of 8 or more, which is the cutoff 
for identifying patients with anxiety or depres-
sion.29 (A list of all efficacy end points is pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Over the 16-week treatment period, we evalu-
ated safety outcomes, including adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and adverse events lead-
ing to treatment discontinuation. Adverse events 
were defined as the occurrence of any untoward 
medical condition during the treatment period.
Statistical Analysis
For binary outcomes, we used the Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel test after adjustment for ran-
domization strata (disease severity and region). 
For the primary analysis of binary variables, we 
categorized data at time points after the use of 
rescue medication (either topical or systemic), 
withdrawal from the trial, or other missing data 
as indicating no response at all subsequent time 
points, including week 16. For continuous end 
points, we treated data that were collected after 
the use of rescue medication as missing, and 
subsequently we performed multiple imputation 
of missing data using the Markov-chain Monte 
Carlo algorithm and a regression model to gener-
ate multiple complete data sets at each time point. 
We then used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
to evaluate data sets, with a model that included 
the assigned treatment, stratification factors 
(region and disease severity), and relevant base-
line values. Results were then combined to gen-
erate statistical inferences.
We performed three prespecified sensitivity 
analyses for binary outcomes using the Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel test, with various methods to 
handle missing data. In the first sensitivity analy-
sis, patients who had received rescue treatment 
or had withdrawn from the trial were considered 
to have had no response, and other missing values 
were imputed by means of the last-observation-
carried-forward method. In the second sensitiv-
ity analysis, we included all observed values re-
gardless of the use of rescue medication, with 
patients who had missing data treated as having 
had no response. In the third sensitivity analy-
sis, we included all observed values regardless of 
the use of rescue medication, with no imputation 
of missing data.
We performed prespecified sensitivity analy-
ses for continuous end points using the follow-
ing methods to account for missing data: mul-
tiple imputation in which all observed data were 
included regardless of the use of rescue medi-
cation; use of a mixed-effect repeated-measures 
model, with data collected after the use of rescue 
medication treated as missing; treating data that 
were collected after the use of rescue medication 
as missing, followed by the last-observation-car-
ried-forward method and ANCOVA; treating data 
that were collected after the use of rescue medi-
cation as missing, followed by the worst-obser-
vation-carried-forward method and ANCOVA; 
and ANCOVA on all observed values without 
imputation. (Additional statistical methods are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)
To control for the overall type I error rate at 
0.05 for primary and secondary end points across 
dose regimens, we used a significance level of 
0.025 for comparisons of each dose of dupilumab 
with placebo according to the prespecified hier-
archical order. If there were no significant be-
tween-group differences for a particular end point, 
testing would stop at that end point. All reported 
P values are two-sided. The significance of differ-
ences between dose groups was not investigated.
Results
Trial Patients
A total of 671 patients underwent randomization 
in SOLO 1 and 708 in SOLO 2 (Figs. S1 and S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The random-
ized groups were well balanced with respect to 
baseline characteristics (Table 1, and Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Approximately half 
of all patients had moderate atopic dermatitis 
(IGA score, 3), and half had severe atopic derma-
titis (IGA score, 4). In each of the groups, a me-

Two Trials of Dupilumab in Atopic Dermatitis
dian of approximately 50% of the patients’ body-
surface area was affected (Table 1). Before 
enrollment, 32.9% of the patients in SOLO 1 and 
33.0% of those in SOLO 2 had received systemic 
glucocorticoids, and 25.9% and 31.4%, respec-
tively, had received systemic immunosuppressant 
agents (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
For both dupilumab regimens in the two trials, 
there were significant differences in all com-
parisons with placebo regarding the prespeci-
fied efficacy end points in the hierarchy (Table 2 
and Figs. 1 and 2, and Figs. S4 through S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). At week 16, signifi-
cantly more patients receiving dupilumab than 
receiving placebo had an IGA score of 0 or 1 and 
an improvement of 2 points or more on the IGA 
from the baseline score (primary end point). In 
SOLO 1, the primary outcome occurred in 85 pa-
tients (38%) receiving dupilumab every other week 
and in 83 (37%) receiving weekly dupilumab, as 
compared with 23 (10%) receiving placebo 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). 
The results were similar in SOLO 2, with the 
primary outcome occurring in 84 patients (36%) 
receiving dupilumab every other week and in 87 
(36%) receiving weekly dupilumab, as compared 
with 20 (8%) receiving placebo (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) (Table 2 and Fig. 1A).
Clinical Severity
In the two trials, an improvement of at least 75% 
on the EASI (EASI-75) at week 16 was reported 
in significantly more patients receiving each 
regimen of dupilumab than among those receiv-
ing placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Ta-
ble 2 and Fig. 1B). The least-squares mean (±SE) 
percent change in the EASI score from baseline 
to week 16 was significantly greater among pa-
tients receiving dupilumab than among those 
receiving placebo, with reductions of 72.3±2.6 
among those receiving dupilumab every other 
week and 72.0±2.6 among those receiving week-
ly dupilumab, as compared with a reduction of 
37.6±3.3 among those receiving placebo in 
SOLO 1; there were least-squares mean percent 
reductions of 67.1±2.5, 69.1±2.5, and 30.9±3.0, 
respectively, in SOLO 2 (P<0.001 for all compari-
sons) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A and 2B). Results in the 
two dupilumab groups in the two trials were sig-
nificantly better than those in the placebo groups 
in additional measures of clinical severity, includ-
ing EASI-50, EASI-90, body-surface area affected, 
and scores on SCORAD and GISS (P<0.001 for 
all comparisons) (Table 2).
Measures of Pruritus
At week 16, an improvement of at least 3 points 
or at least 4 points in the peak score on the 
pruritus numerical rating scale occurred in sig-
nificantly more patients receiving dupilumab than 
in those receiving placebo (P<0.001 for all com-
parisons) (Table 2). By week 2, patient-reported 
scores with respect to itching were significantly 
better among patients receiving dupilumab than 
among those receiving placebo (Table 2 and 
Fig. 2C and 2D).
Patient-Reported Symptoms and Quality of Life
In the two trials, dupilumab significantly reduced 
patient-reported symptoms of atopic dermatitis 
and its effect on sleep, symptoms of anxiety or 
depression, and quality of life (Table 2, and Ta-
ble S4 and Figs. S6 and S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). For both the DLQI and POEM scores, 
significantly more patients in the two dupilu-
mab groups than in the placebo groups had a 
reduction of at least 4 points (considered to be 
the minimal clinically important difference22,27) 
in the total score (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Among patients who had had 
symptoms of anxiety or depression (HADS-A or 
HADS-D score, ≥8) at baseline, significantly 
more dupilumab-treated patients than those re-
ceiving placebo had HADS-A and HADS-D scores 
of less than 8 at week 16 (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Use of Rescue Medication
In the two trials, more patients in the placebo 
group than in either dupilumab group received 
rescue treatment. In SOLO 1, the rates of rescue 
treatment were 21% among those receiving du-
pilumab every other week and 23% among those 
receiving dupilumab every week, as compared with 
51% among those receiving placebo; in SOLO 2, 
the rates were 15%, 21%, and 52%, respectively 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Pa-
tients in the placebo groups were more likely to 
receive systemic rescue therapies (glucocorticoids 
or immunosuppressant agents) (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) and tended to receive 
rescue treatments earlier than dupilumab-treat-

Two Trials of Dupilumab in Atopic Dermatitis
ed patients (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Overall, among patients receiving dupilumab, 
similar results were observed in the primary analy-
sis and with all observed values regardless of the 
use of rescue medication (Figs. S4 and S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Outcomes of sensitivity 
analyses were similar to those of the primary 
analysis (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
The overall incidence of adverse events was simi-
lar in the dupilumab groups and the placebo 
groups in the two trials (Table 3). Serious ad-
verse events and adverse events leading to treat-
ment discontinuation were uncommon in the 
two trials (Table 3, and Tables S7 and S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The only serious ad-
verse event that was reported in more than 2 pa-
tients in any treatment group was a serious ex-
acerbation of atopic dermatitis, which was reported 
in 2 patients receiving dupilumab every other 
week and 3 receiving placebo in SOLO 1 and in 
1 patient receiving weekly dupilumab and 5 pa-
tients receiving placebo in SOLO 2 (Table S7 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse events that were categorized as “infec-
tions and infestations” in the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class 
(which includes any type of infectious adverse 
event, regardless of cause or organ system) devel-
oped in 35% of the patients receiving dupilumab 
every other week and in 34% of those receiving 
dupilumab every week, as compared with 28% of 
those receiving placebo in SOLO 1 and in 28%, 
29%, and 32%, respectively, in SOLO 2. (Common 
adverse events that are categorized as MedDRA 
preferred terms in this class included nasopharyn-
gitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and con-
junctivitis, including conjunctivitis of unspecified 
cause.) Skin infections were observed in 6% of 
patients receiving each dose of dupilumab in the 
two trials and in 8% of those receiving placebo 
in SOLO 1 and 11% in SOLO 2. All “infections 
and infestations” that were not reported as skin 
infections could be classified as “non-skin” in-
fections; these were reported in 30% of the pa-
tients receiving dupilumab every other week, in 
31% of those receiving dupilumab every week, and 
in 22% of those receiving placebo in SOLO 1 and 
in 25%, 26%, and 24%, respectively, in SOLO 2 
(Table 3, and Table S9 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Herpes infections were reported in 7%, 
4%, and 4% of patients, respectively, in SOLO 1 
and in 4%, 5%, and 3% of patients, respectively, in 
SOLO 2 (Table 3, and Table S9 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Additional details regarding se-
rious, severe, and opportunistic infections are 
provided in Table S10 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
There were two deaths in SOLO 2: a 49-year-old 
woman who was not receiving an asthma-control 
medication died of an asthma attack 84 days after 
the last dose of dupilumab, and a 31-year-old man 
with a history of depression, including hospital-
ization for depression, and suicidal ideation com-
mitted suicide, an event that occurred 8 days after 
the most recent dose of dupilumab. (Detailed nar-
ratives are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
The most common adverse events in the two 
trials were exacerbations of atopic dermatitis, in-
jection-site reactions, and nasopharyngitis (Ta-
ble 3). The incidence of nasopharyngitis was gen-
erally balanced across dupilumab and placebo 
groups. Dupilumab-treated patients had a higher 
incidence of injection-site reactions, most of which 
were mild or moderate. Exacerbations of atopic 
dermatitis and most types of skin infections 
were more common in the placebo groups. The 
rates of conjunctivitis with an unspecified cause 
and allergic conjunctivitis were higher in the 
dupilumab groups than in the placebo groups 
(Table 3); bacterial or viral conjunctivitis (Med-
DRA preferred term) was reported in less than 
2% of the patients in any group (Table S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Laboratory values, vital signs, and electrocar-
diographic assessments did not indicate notewor-
thy differences among treatment groups. Small 
transient increases in eosinophil levels from base-
line were observed in the dupilumab groups at 
weeks 4 and 8, with subsequent decreases toward 
or below baseline levels by week 16 (Table S11 
and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, both dose regimens of 
dupilumab resulted in better results than pla-
cebo over 16 weeks of treatment across multi-
ple outcome measures that reflected objective 
signs of atopic dermatitis, subjective symptoms 
(e.g., pruritus), important aspects of mental

Two Trials of Dupilumab in Atopic Dermatitis
health (i.e., anxiety and depression), and quality 
of life. The mean efficacy results were similar 
for both dupilumab regimens. SOLO 1 and 
SOLO 2 were designed to provide replication of 
results, and patient populations and results were 
highly consistent in the two trials.
Our findings confirm and expand on the re-
sults of previous early-phase trials of dupilumab 
in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic der-
matitis.10,11,14,15 Improvement in the primary out-
come was supported by improvement in all other 
measures of clinical severity and extent of involve-
ment. The between-group difference was signifi-
cant for all prespecified efficacy end points that 
were listed in the statistical hierarchy. In addi-
tion, significant improvement was observed with 
respect to patient-reported symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis (including the effect on pruritus and 
sleep), symptoms of anxiety or depression, and 
health-related quality of life, with a significant 
reduction in itching apparent by week 2. These 
data suggest that the amelioration of signs and 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis by treatment with 
dupilumab may reduce the disease burden as-
sociated with moderate-to-severe atopic dermati-
tis across multiple domains that are important 
to patients.
Sensitivity analyses showed that the primary 
efficacy outcome was not driven by the categori-
zation of the use of rescue medication as no re-
sponse. Indeed, the between-group difference in 
this outcome remained significant when patients 
who received rescue medication were included in 
the analysis, even though considerably more pa-
tients in the placebo groups than in the dupilumab 
groups received rescue treatment.
The incidence of conjunctivitis was higher 
among patients receiving dupilumab than among 
those receiving placebo. The cause of conjuncti-
vitis in patients with atopic dermatitis is not yet 
fully understood. In contrast to our findings in 
the current trials, the incidence of conjunctivitis 
was not increased in dupilumab-treated patients 
in early studies of dupilumab involving patients 
with asthma16,17 or with chronic sinusitis with 
nasal polyposis,18 which suggests that character-
istics specific to atopic dermatitis may contrib-
ute to its cause. Further studies on the causes of 
conjunctivitis are warranted.
In phase 1 and phase 2a studies of dupilumab 
in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic der-
matitis, the most frequent serious adverse events 
were exacerbation of atopic dermatitis and skin 
infections, both of which were more frequent in 
the placebo groups, whereas in the phase 2b trial, 
there was no apparent imbalance in the rates of 
serious adverse events across treatment groups.10,14 
In SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, infections were reported 
in 28 to 35% of patients receiving dupilumab 
and in 28 to 33% of those receiving placebo. Her-

Point.
Panel A shows the proportions of patients with the pri‑
mary end point (both a score of 0 or 1 [clear or almost 
clear] on the Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA; 
scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating 
more severe disease] and a reduction from baseline of 
2 points or more on the IGA at week 16) among pa‑
tients who received dupilumab every week, dupilumab 
every other week, or placebo in SOLO 1 and SOLO 2. 
Panel B shows the proportions of patients with the key 
secondary end point (which was considered to be a 
coprimary end point by regulators in the European 
Union and Japan) of an improvement from baseline of 
at least 75% on the Eczema Area and Severity Index 
(EASI‑75) at week 16 in the two trials. P<0.001 for all 
comparisons between dupilumab and placebo. For bi‑
nary end points, patients who received rescue medica‑
tions or withdrew from the study were categorized as 
having had no response, as were those with all other 
missing values.

pes viral infections of any type were reported in 
4 to 7% of patients receiving dupilumab and in 
3 to 4% of those receiving placebo. The patients 
receiving placebo had a higher incidence of skin 
infections (8 to 11%) than did dupilumab-treat-
ed patients (approximately 6%), a finding that 
was consistent with an improvement in skin-
barrier integrity and function associated with 
dupilumab,10,11 whereas non-skin infections were 
observed in 25 to 31% of patients receiving du-
pilumab and in 22 to 24% of those receiving 
placebo. There is evidence that reducing type 2 
skin inflammation helps normalize skin antimi-
crobial responses.31-36 Two deaths were reported 
in the dupilumab groups. These trials were not 
long enough or large enough to exclude uncom-

Shown are the least‑squares mean percent changes from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 
score (Panels A and B) and in the weekly average of peak scores on the numerical rating scale (NRS) for pruritus  
(a key secondary end point) (Panels C and D) in SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 at 16 weeks (P<0.001 for all comparisons with 
placebo). The I bars represent standard errors. For the pruritus NRS, the baseline peak score was the average of the 
daily scores for maximum itch intensity during the 7 days immediately preceding randomization (minimum of four 
scores required). For continuous end points, data from patients who received rescue medications were categorized 
as missing at all time points after the receipt of the rescue medication; missing data were imputed with the use of a

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
mon adverse events, and results from larger stud-
ies of longer duration are needed to assess the ef-
fectiveness and safety of long-term treatment with 
dupilumab.
Patients with atopic dermatitis, particularly 
moderate-to-severe disease, are at increased risk 
for depression.37,38 Five patients had various seri-
ous adverse events related to depression (four in 
the placebo group and one in the group receiv-
ing weekly dupilumab); of these patients, one in 
the dupilumab group committed suicide. Symp-
toms of anxiety or depression were reduced to a 
significantly greater extent with dupilumab than 
with placebo among patients who had these symp-
toms at baseline (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). These data underscore the substantial 
psychosocial effect of moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis on quality of life and aspects of mental 
health and the potential for improvement in these 
areas associated with amelioration of the signs and 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis with dupilumab.
These trials have several limitations. First, 
neither trial was planned to allow statistical sepa-
ration of the two doses of dupilumab. However, 
in each trial, the two regimens showed similar 
efficacy and safety. Second, the 16-week treat-
ment period did not address efficacy and safety 
of longer-term treatment. Third, concomitant topi-
cal glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors were 
allowed only as rescue therapy; another phase 3 
trial (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS) has evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomi-
tant topical glucocorticoids with or without topical 
calcineurin inhibitors.39 Fourth, we evaluated dupi-
lumab in adults, but not children, in whom atopic 
dermatitis is more prevalent. A recently completed 
study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pre-
liminary efficacy and safety of dupilumab in 
children.
These results show that the type 2 cytokines 
interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are key drivers 
of atopic dermatitis; they further support the 
possibility, suggested by earlier studies in related 
diseases, that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 are 
important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases in 
general, including asthma and chronic sinusitis 
with nasal polyposis.16-18
In conclusion, in two phase 3 trials of identi-
cal design involving patients with moderate-to-
severe atopic dermatitis that was inadequately 
controlled with topical medications, both regi-
mens of dupilumab (every other week and weekly) 
were superior to placebo in ameliorating the signs 
and symptoms of atopic dermatitis (including 
pruritus and the effect on sleep), causing clini-
cally meaningful reductions in patient-reported 
symptoms of anxiety and depression, and im-
proving health-related quality of life. Injection-
site reactions and conjunctivitis were more fre-
quent in patients receiving dupilumab than in 
those receiving placebo. The results of these trials 
confirm and extend findings on dupilumab from 
earlier studies involving patients with moderate-
to-severe atopic dermatitis.10,14,15
