BACKGROUND
Bococizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase sub-
tilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. 
We sought to evaluate the efficacy of bococizumab in patients at high cardiovascular risk.
METHODS
In two parallel, multinational trials with different entry criteria for LDL cholesterol levels, 
we randomly assigned the 27,438 patients in the combined trials to receive bococizumab 
(at a dose of 150 mg) subcutaneously every 2 weeks or placebo. The primary end point 
was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina 
requiring urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular death; 93% of the patients were 
receiving statin therapy at baseline. The trials were stopped early after the sponsor 
elected to discontinue the development of bococizumab owing in part to the development 
of high rates of antidrug antibodies, as seen in data from other studies in the program. 
The median follow-up was 10 months.
RESULTS
At 14 weeks, patients in the combined trials had a mean change from baseline in LDL 
cholesterol levels of −56.0% in the bococizumab group and +2.9% in the placebo group, 
for a between-group difference of –59.0 percentage points (P<0.001) and a median reduc-
tion from baseline of 64.2% (P<0.001). In the lower-risk, shorter-duration trial (in which 
the patients had a baseline LDL cholesterol level of ≥70 mg per deciliter [1.8 mmol per 
liter] and the median follow-up was 7 months), major cardiovascular events occurred in 
173 patients each in the bococizumab group and the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.99; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.22; P 
= 
0.94). In the higher-risk, longer-duration 
trial (in which the patients had a baseline LDL cholesterol level of ≥100 mg per deciliter 
[2.6 mmol per liter] and the median follow-up was 12 months), major cardiovascular 
events occurred in 179 and 224 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 
0.97; P 
= 
0.02). The hazard ratio for the primary end point in the combined trials was 0.88 
(95% CI, 0.76 to 1.02; P 
= 
0.08). Injection-site reactions were more common in the boco-
cizumab group than in the placebo group (10.4% vs. 1.3%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
In two randomized trials comparing the PCSK9 inhibitor bococizumab with placebo, 
bococizumab had no benefit with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events in the 
trial involving lower-risk patients but did have a significant benefit in the trial involving 
higher-risk patients. (Funded by Pfizer; SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, 
NCT01975376 and NCT01975389.)

onoclonal antibodies that in-
hibit proprotein convertase subtilisin–
kexin type 9 (PCSK9) lower levels of 
plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
and are promising agents for vascular risk reduc-
tion.1 Patients who have received the fully human 
monoclonal antibodies evolocumab and alirocu-
mab, for example, have had reductions in cardio-
vascular events in preliminary analyses; these 
drugs are under evaluation in large-scale trials 
involving patients with known cardiovascular 
disease.2,3
Bococizumab is a third inhibitor of PCSK9 
that, unlike evolocumab and alirocumab, is a 
humanized monoclonal antibody in which ap-
proximately 3% of the murine sequence remains 
in the antigen-binding complementarity-deter-
mining region. As part of the Studies of PCSK9 
Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events 
(SPIRE) program, two large-scale trials to evalu-
ate cardiovascular outcomes (designated SPIRE-1 
and SPIRE-2) were initiated in October 2013 with 
the intent of evaluating the clinical efficacy and 
safety of bococizumab administered at a dose of 
150 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks among pa-
tients who had evidence of cardiovascular disease 
or who were at high risk for a first vascular 
event.4 However, during the conduct of these two 
outcomes trials, data became available from the 
six SPIRE lipid-lowering trials indicating that boco-
cizumab was commonly associated with the devel-
opment of high-titer antidrug antibodies that 
resulted in substantive attenuation of LDL-cho-
lesterol lowering over time. In addition, the trials 
showed that bococizumab was associated with a 
wide variation in LDL-cholesterol lowering, even 
among patients who were antibody negative.5
On the basis of the SPIRE lipid-lowering data, 
the sponsor elected to discontinue further devel-
opment of bococizumab on November 1, 2016. 
As a consequence of that decision, the sponsor 
also elected to prematurely stop the ongoing 
SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 outcome trials. That deci-
sion was made with no knowledge by the sponsor 
or investigators of any unblinded data in SPIRE-1 
or SPIRE-2.
Methods
Trial Design
The SPIRE bococizumab development program 
consisted of two parts: the six SPIRE lipid-lowering 
studies,5 as reported elsewhere in the Journal, and 
the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 event-driven cardiovas-
cular outcome trials; the results of the latter two 
trials are reported here. The SPIRE program was 
sponsored by Pfizer. The protocols for SPIRE-1 
and SPIRE-2 (available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org) were collaboratively designed 
by the academic members of the executive and 
steering committees and physician and statisti-
cian employees of the sponsor. Each protocol was 
approved at participating centers by the respon-
sible institutional review board or ethics commit-
tee, as applicable in the 35 countries involved. In 
addition, the sponsor supervised data collection. 
A single independent data and safety monitoring 
committee oversaw the trials. The first author 
and an independent academic statistician at 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital had full access 
to the trial databases, generated trial analyses, 
prepared the first draft of the manuscript, and 
made the decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication. All the authors critically reviewed 
the manuscript and vouch for the completeness 
and accuracy of the data and all analyses and for 
the fidelity of the trials to the protocols.
Patient Enrollment
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had 
had either a previous cardiovascular event (second-
ary prevention cohort) or a history of diabetes, 
chronic kidney disease, or peripheral vascular dis-
ease with additional cardiovascular risk condi-
tions or a history of familial hypercholesterolemia 
(high-risk primary prevention cohort). To aug-
ment the risk criteria for the primary prevention 
cohort, patients were also required to have one 
or more additional risk factors (smoking history, 
a high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol 
level of <40 mg per deciliter [<1.0 mmol per li-
ter], a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 
>2.0 mg per liter, a lipoprotein(a) level of >50 mg 
per deciliter, microalbuminuria, or evidence of 
asymptomatic coronary stenosis on cardiac im-
aging) and an age of at least 50 years for men 
and more than 60 years for women; the age 
cutoff for patients who had familial hypercho-
lesterolemia was at least 35 years for men and 
45 years for women.4
All the patients were required to have re-
ceived treatment for at least the previous 4 weeks 
with a statin (atorvastatin, ≥40 mg daily; rosuv-
astatin, ≥20 mg daily; or simvastatin, ≥40 mg

daily) unless they could not take those doses 
without side effects, in which case they received 
a lower-intensity statin regimen. The only excep-
tion to this regimen was the use of no statin 
therapy among the patients in SPIRE-2 who had 
complete statin intolerance, which was defined 
as a documented inability to tolerate at least two 
different statin agents, including one at the low-
est available daily dose, or having a documented 
history of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis or aller-
gic reaction that precluded rechallenge.
Patients were required to have a directly mea-
sured LDL cholesterol level of at least 70 mg per 
deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in SPIRE-1 and of

Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab in High-Risk Patients
Randomization and Follow-up
Eligible patients entered a 6-week placebo run-in 
period that was designed to ensure adherence to 
the subcutaneous drug administration. Patients 
were then randomly assigned in a double-blind 
manner to receive either 150 mg of bococizumab 
subcutaneously every 2 weeks or matching pla-
cebo. Protocol-driven dose reductions of bocociz-
umab from 150 mg to 75 mg every 2 weeks (and, 
if needed, a further reduction to every 4 weeks) 
were triggered by the observation of LDL cho-
lesterol levels of less than 10 mg per deciliter 
(0.3 mmol per liter) on two consecutive visits, 
with sham dose modifications made in the pla-
cebo group to maintain the trial blinding.
End Points

diovascular events until November 1, 2016 (when

Figure 1. Percent Reduction in LDL Cholesterol and the Primary End Point in SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2.
A waterfall plot shows wide variability in percent reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels at 14 weeks for each patient in the bococizumab group in SPIRE-1 
and SPIRE-2 combined (median reduction in LDL cholesterol levels from baseline at 14 weeks, 64%) (Panel A). Also shown is the cumulative incidence of the primary end point 
(nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular death) in the bococizumab group and the 
placebo group in SPIRE-1 (Panel B), SPIRE-2 (Panel C), and the two trials combined (Panel D). In Panels B, C, and D, the insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.

Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab in High-Risk Patients
continued by the sponsor), and were followed for 
adverse events through the last patient visit. This 
report includes all cardiovascular events that oc-
curred by November 1, 2016, and that were ad-
judicated and confirmed by February 20, 2017. 
The prespecified primary end point of the two 
trials was a composite of adjudicated and con-
firmed nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal 
stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina requir-
ing urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular 
death. The prespecified secondary composite end 
points are described in Section C in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. All incident events that were 
components of these end points were adjudicated 
by a committee in which the members were un-
aware of study-drug assignments.
Statistical Analysis
As originally planned, the trial sample size for 
SPIRE-1 (17,000 patients for an anticipated 844 
patients with an adjudicated and confirmed pri-
mary end point) would provide approximately 
90% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction 
in the trial primary end point, whereas the trial 
sample size for SPIRE-2 (11,000 patients for an 
anticipated 508 patients with an adjudicated and 
confirmed primary end point) would provide ap-
proximately 90% power to detect a 25% relative 
risk reduction in the trial primary end point. At 
the time that the sponsor discontinued the trials, 
enrollment was nearly complete, but neither of 
the two trials had continued long enough for the 
occurrence of the prespecified number of pri-
mary end point events. However, the virtually 
identical designs of the two trials permitted 
them to be easily combined. As such, after trial 
discontinuation but before unblinding, the execu-
tive committee and the sponsor prepared an inte-
grated statistical analysis plan to allow for such 
a combination.
Cardiovascular outcomes were analyzed with 
the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model 
and a log-rank test within each trial and for the 
combined trials. After trial discontinuation but 
before unblinding, the decision was made to per-
form two subgroup analyses for the combined 
trials for the primary end point stratified ac-
cording to the date of randomization (before the 
median or on or after the median) and the per-
cent and absolute difference in LDL cholesterol 
levels at 14 weeks (below the median value or at 
or above the median value). For the combined 
trials, we used a Poisson regression model to 
analyze adverse events and a logistic-regression 
model to analyze laboratory measurements. We 
used a mixed-model repeated-measures approach 
to analyze the percent changes from baseline at 
weeks 14 and 52 for a panel of lipid biomarkers 
and for glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Water-
fall plots were used to examine the individual 
biologic variability in the response of LDL cho-
lesterol levels to bococizumab (Section D in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Results
Patients
Before the sponsor terminated the two trials, 
16,817 patients had enrolled in SPIRE-1 and 
10,621 had enrolled in SPIRE-2 (Section E in 
the Supplementary Appendix). At baseline, the 
mean LDL cholesterol level was 94 mg per deci-
liter (2.4 mmol per liter) in SPIRE-1 and 134 mg 
per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter) in SPIRE-2, with 
the different values reflecting design differences 
in the two trials (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The rate of familial 
hypercholesterolemia was higher in SPIRE-2 
than in SPIRE-1 (7.3% vs. 1.8%), as was the use 
of ezetimibe (13.4% vs. 7.9%); the rate of statin 
use was lower (83% vs. 99%). In the combined 
trials, the mean age was 63 years, 30% of the 
patients were women, 48% had diabetes, 25% 
were current smokers, and 85% had received a 
diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. At the time 
of trial termination, the median follow-up time 
was 7 months in SPIRE-1 and 12 months in 
SPIRE-2.
Effects on Lipid Levels
At 14 weeks, the mean percent change from 
baseline in the LDL cholesterol level was −56.0% 
among patients in the bococizumab group and 
+2.9% among those in the placebo group, for a 
between-group difference of –59.0 percentage 
points (P<0.001) and a median reduction from 
baseline of 64.2% (P<0.001) (Table 2, and Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). At 14 weeks, 
28% of the patients in the bococizumab group 
had LDL cholesterol levels of 25 mg per deciliter 
or less. Bococizumab, as compared with placebo, 
also had substantial early effects on levels of total 
cholesterol (−37.0%), apolipoprotein B (−55.3%), 
non-HDL cholesterol (−53.6%), lipoprotein(a)

Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab in High-Risk Patients
(−30.9%), and triglycerides (−19.4%) (P<0.001 for 
all comparisons) (Table 2). There was no signifi-
cant change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.
Consistent with findings in the SPIRE lipid-
lowering trials,5 attenuation in the reduction in 
LDL cholesterol levels was observed over time, 
so that the mean percent change among the 
patients in the bococizumab group was −41.8% 
at 52 weeks and −38.3% at 104 weeks (Table 2, 
and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). As 
was also observed in the SPIRE lipid-lowering 
trials, there was wide individual variation in the 
patients’ response with respect to LDL-cholesterol 
lowering (Fig. 1A, and Figs. S2 and S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). During follow-up, 
46% of the patients in the bococizumab group 
had at least one LDL cholesterol measurement of 
25 mg per deciliter or less.
Effects on Clinical Outcomes
In SPIRE-1, among the patients who had LDL 
cholesterol levels of 70 mg per deciliter or more 
at baseline, the primary end point of nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospi-
talization for unstable angina requiring urgent 
revascularization, or cardiovascular death oc-
curred in 173 patients each in the bococizumab 
group and the placebo group (hazard ratio, 
0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.22; 
P 
= 
0.94) (Table 3 and Fig. 1B). By contrast, in 
SPIRE-2, among the patients with LDL choles-
terol levels of 100 mg deciliter or more at base-
line, the primary end point occurred in 179 
patients in the bococizumab group and in 224 
patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 
0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; P 
= 
0.02) (Table 3 and 
Fig. 1C). In the combined analysis, the primary 
end point occurred in 352 patients in the boco-
cizumab group and in 397 in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.02; 
P 
= 
0.08) (Table 3 and Fig. 1D). Similar effects 
were observed for the prespecified secondary 
composite end points. No significant between-
group differences were observed in the rates of 
death from cardiovascular causes or from any 
cause.
We observed no significant difference in the 
primary end point in analyses that were strati-
fied according to age, sex, smoking status, or the 
presence or absence of diabetes or clinical evi-
dence of cardiovascular disease. However, effects 
were significant across both trials among the 
patients who had percent reductions in LDL cho-
lesterol levels that were greater than or equal to 
the median value at 14 weeks or absolute reduc-
tions in LDL cholesterol levels that were greater 
than or equal to the median value at 14 weeks; 
there were no significant differences among the 
patients who had lesser degrees of reduction in 
LDL cholesterol levels. Effects were also signifi-
cant for the patients who were randomly assigned 
to a study group before the median date of ran-
domization (mean exposure period, 13.8 months) 
but not for those who were assigned on or after

Efficacy and Safety of Bococizumab in High-Risk Patients
the median date of randomization (mean expo-
sure period, 5.7 months) (Table 3, and Figs. S4 
and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events
The rates of serious adverse events were similar 
in the two groups. Adverse events leading to 
drug discontinuation were more frequent in the 
bococizumab group than in the placebo group, 
and there was a higher rate of injection-site reac-
tions (10.4% vs. 1.3%, P<0.001) (Table 4). Reports 
of newly diagnosed diabetes and of cataracts 
were similar in the two groups and did not vary 
according to the magnitude of the reduction in 
LDL cholesterol levels. In the bococizumab group, 
there was a small increase in blood glucose levels 
but no change in glycated hemoglobin levels at 
52 weeks.
Discussion
In SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2, patients at high cardio-
vascular risk with two different baseline levels of 
LDL cholesterol were randomly assigned to re-
ceive either the PCSK9 inhibitor bococizumab or 
placebo. The two trials were stopped prematurely 
owing to the decision of the sponsor to discon-
tinue further development of the study drug. In 
SPIRE-1, no significant benefit of bococizumab 
was observed on the primary end point. In con-
trast, in SPIRE-2, there was a significant benefit 
associated with bococizumab.
In the combined analysis of data from the two 
trials, no significant benefit was seen with respect 
to the primary end point. However, the pooled ef-
fect estimate and associated confidence intervals 
in the combined analysis, in which the reduction 
in the LDL cholesterol level at 52 weeks was 1.4 
mmol per liter (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76 
to 1.02; P 
= 
0.08), overlap with the values in a 
meta-analysis of previous lipid-lowering trials, in 
which the hazard ratio for patients with 1 year of 
follow-up or less was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.97) 
for each reduction of 1.0 mmol per liter in LDL 
cholesterol levels.6
There were several differences between the 
two trials. The baseline LDL cholesterol level was 
70 mg per deciliter or more in SPIRE-1, as com-
pared with 100 mg per deciliter in SPIRE-2. The 
absolute risk of a primary end point event was 
lower in SPIRE-1 than in SPIRE-2 (3.02 vs. 4.19 
events per 100 person-years). The median fol-
low-up time at the time of trial termination was 
7 months in SPIRE-1 and 12 months in SPIRE-2. 
Therefore, the patients in SPIRE-2 were at higher 
risk and were treated for a longer period on 
average than were the patients in SPIRE-1.
The idea that the magnitude of risk and the 
duration of treatment may explain the differ-
ences between the two trials is supported by 
three additional analyses that were planned after 
the trial was stopped but before unblinding. In 
analyses of the pooled data from both trials, 
there was a significant reduction in the rate of 
the primary end point among patients who had 
a percent reduction in LDL cholesterol levels that 
was greater than or equal to the median value at 
14 weeks and among those who had an absolute 
reduction in LDL cholesterol levels that was 
greater than or equal to the median value at 14 
weeks, whereas those with lesser reductions in 
LDL cholesterol values did not have such reduced 
rates. In addition, patients with a randomization 
date before the median date had a significant 
event-rate reduction, whereas those with a ran-
domization date after the median did not have 
such a reduction, which indicates a benefit for a 
longer duration of therapy.
In the SPIRE lipid-lowering program, antidrug 
antibodies developed in nearly half the patients 
who received bococizumab and neutralizing anti-
bodies developed in 29%, which in some affected 
patients substantially attenuated LDL-cholesterol 
lowering over time. These effects would be an-
ticipated to reduce clinical efficacy. Although an 
attenuation in LDL-cholesterol lowering was also 
seen in SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2, the status with re-
spect to antidrug antibodies is not yet known in 
these trials, and therefore further work in analyz-
ing these effects is needed. However, our findings 
suggest that the formation of antidrug antibod-
ies is limited to bococizumab and is not an issue 
with the fully human monoclonal antibodies evo-
locumab and alirocumab. This immunologic dif-
ference among PCSK9 inhibitors also provides 
an explanation of the high rate of injection-site 
reactions observed only with bococizumab.
Other than such reactions, we observed few

adverse effects and no significant increase in 
cataracts or new-onset diabetes. This latter issue 
is of particular interest, since statin therapy is 
associated with a modest increase in diabetes,7,8 
and genetic variations in HMGCR (the primary 
target for statin therapy) and in PCSK9 (the target 
of PCSK9 inhibitors) have been associated with 
protective effects with respect to atherosclerosis 
but adverse effects with respect to diabetes.9-11 
However, our trials had a short duration and thus 
a limited ability to address adverse effects on glu-
cose metabolism.
In the two trials, we also confirmed that there 
is wide individual variability in the response to 
bococizumab with respect to LDL cholesterol lev-
els, a variation that was similar to that observed 
with statin therapy.12,13 In the SPIRE lipid-lower-
ing trials, this effect was present even among 
patients in whom antidrug or neutralizing anti-
bodies did not develop.5 As shown here, variabil-
ity in LDL-cholesterol response influenced clinical 
outcomes. If similar variability is found to exist for 
other PCSK9 inhibitors, the individual LDL-cho-
lesterol response may be a useful measure to 
monitor as physicians seek to find the most ap-
propriate selection criteria for the use of these 
agents.
In conclusion, the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 trials 
of PCSK9 inhibition with bococizumab were ter-
minated early by the sponsor owing to the devel-
opment of antidrug antibodies in other studies in 
the program. In SPIRE-1, in which there was a 
shorter observation period of lower-risk patients 
than in SPIRE-2, no benefit of bococizumab was 
seen with respect to the primary end point of 
major adverse cardiovascular events. In contrast, 
in SPIRE-2, after a longer duration of observation 
of higher-risk patients, a significant benefit of 
bococizumab was shown.
