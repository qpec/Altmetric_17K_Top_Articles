Abstract
Misfolded α-synuclein amyloid fibrils are the principal components of Lewy bodies and neurites, 
hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we present a high-resolution structure of an α-
synuclein fibril, in a form that induces robust pathology in primary neuronal culture, determined 
by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and validated by electron microscopy and X-ray fiber 
diffraction. Over 200 unique long-range distance restraints define a consensus structure with 
common amyloid features including parallel in-register β-sheets and hydrophobic core residues, 
but also substantial complexity, arising from diverse structural features: an intermolecular salt 
bridge, a glutamine ladder, close backbone interactions involving small residues, and several steric 
zippers stabilizing a novel, orthogonal Greek-key topology. These characteristics contribute to the 
robust propagation of this fibril form, as evidenced by structural similarity of early-onset PD 
mutants. The structure provides a framework for understanding the interactions of α-synuclein 
with other proteins and small molecules to diagnose and treat PD.
Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy 
neurites (LNs)1, intracytoplasmic aggregates containing α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils1. 
Exogenous α-syn fibrils seed LB- and LN-like inclusions in cell culture models2,3, and 
neuron-to-neuron α-syn transmission propagates PD-like pathology4. Inoculation of 
preformed α-syn fibrils into wild-type (WT) non-transgenic mice seeds aggregation of 
endogenous mouse α-syn and reproduces key features of the neurodegenerative cascade5. 
Additionally, recent rat model studies have established that α-syn fibril strains cause distinct 
synucleinopathies with differing toxicity profiles6.
Although secondary structures have been examined for several α-syn fibril forms by solid-
state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy7–10, thus far there is no reported high-resolution three-
dimensional (3D) structure. The α-syn monomer (14.5 kDa) is substantially larger than other 
amyloid peptides or proteins whose structures have been solved, such as HET-s (8.7 kDa)11, 
a β2-microglobulin fragment (2.5 kDa)12, amyloid-β(1–40) (Aβ(1–40), 4.3 kDa)13–15 and 
amyloid-β(1–42) (4.5 kDa)16. In addition to size, the highly repetitive secondary structure 
and residue type degeneracy in α-syn present major challenges for high-resolution structure 
determination. To address these challenges, we performed a comprehensive structural study 
of an α-syn fibril form previously reported by our group8,17,18. Utilizing extensive sample 
preparation (six isotopically labeled samples), data collection (68 multidimensional spectra), 
and computational analysis (interpretation of >7,500 cross peaks), we determined a single 
unique conformation in which the core residues are arranged in parallel, in-register β-sheets 
with a Greek-key topology. The structure was validated with measurements of fibril width, 
intermolecular stacking and β-sheet spacing by electron microscopy (EM) and X-ray fiber 
diffraction. These structural insights establish the basis for an improved understanding of α-
syn fibril nucleation, propagation, and interactions with small molecules of potential utility 
for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.

 Results
In vitro α-syn fibrils are pathogenic to neuronal cells
To determine if the α-syn fibrils used in this study for high-resolution 3D structural 
determination were pathophysiologically indistinguishable from those previously evaluated 
using cell-based models, we added fibrils to primary hippocampal neurons and showed the 
induction of insoluble, phosphorylated α-syn (pSyn) inclusions2,3 as indicated by 
immunostaining with 81A, an antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser129 (Fig. 1a–e). 
Under these conditions, untreated neurons show no pSyn signal. Importantly, exposure of the 
coverslips to a second α-syn antibody, HuA, also labeled the insoluble material identified by 
81A (Fig. 1f–g) as well as the exogenously added material (Fig. 1h). A dose-dependent 
effect of fibril treatment on the development of misfolded, neuronal α-syn was confirmed by 
quantitation of the insoluble pSyn (Fig. 1i). Furthermore, treatment at doses >250 nM 
showed neuronal injury or death as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into 
the culture media (Fig. 1j). This result is consistent with our previously published data using 
fibril preparations in primary culture and WT mice3,5. To ensure that LDH release was not 
from residual endotoxin present from the protein expression in E. coli, we measured the 
endotoxin level in the fibrils and determined a range of 0.0094–0.0452 endotoxin units (EU) 
per treatment (0.0031–0.0151 EU per μg α-syn fibrils), a level below the threshold 
contributing to α-syn pathology and astrogliosis in α-syn toxicity assays19. Thus, the α-syn 
fibrils used in this study act as pathological seeds capable of initiating a disease-like 
cascade.
Long-range distance restraints from solid-state NMR spectra
We then proceeded to prepare and validate isotopically labeled WT human α-syn fibril 
samples (Supplementary Fig. 1) for magic-angle spinning (MAS) SSNMR spectroscopy 
studies (Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, the fibril samples consistently reproduced the 
morphology observed in our prior reports8,17,18, enabling us to prepare several ~20 mg 
samples of identical form but with different 13C and 15N isotopic labeling patterns, 
customized in each case to enable collection of the crucial SSNMR data sets containing 
unique structural restraints (Table 1). Specifically, we utilized the uniformly-13C, 15N-
labeled (U-13C,15N) α-syn fibril (sample A) to confirm and extend the resonance 
assignments using well-established pulse sequence methods20. We employed the α-syn fibril 
samples, which we had prepared with 1,3-13C-glycerol or 2-13C-glycerol (samples B and C) 
as the primary 13C sources in the growth medium21, to enhance spectral resolution and 
sensitivity; we identified many new long-range restraints in a series of 2D 13C-13C and 
3D 15N-13C-13C spectra using dipolar-assisted rotational resonance (DARR) mixing22. We 
prepared a sample of U-13C, 15N α-syn monomer diluted in natural abundance α-syn prior 
to fibrillization (sample D), facilitating SSNMR measurements that detect unambiguously 
intramolecular 13C-13C correlations23 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Finally, we generated 
mixtures of 13C-labeled α-syn monomer (from each of the glycerol sources) with 15N-
labeled monomer (samples E and F), yielding isotopically mixed fibril samples that 
permitted the unambiguous determination of intermolecular restraints with 15N-13C 
transferred-echo double resonance TEDOR according to protocols24 (Supplementary Fig. 
2b–e).

 In total, we collected 52 2D and 16 3D SSNMR spectra (Supplementary Table 1), exhibiting 
7,704 total assigned cross peaks, from which hundreds of long-range distance restraints were 
identified (Table 1). Most critically, we collected the 3D 15N-13C-13C and 2D 13C-13C 
spectra with samples B and C at a series of DARR 13C-13C mixing times from 50 ms to 500 
ms, to enable the identification of 180 unambiguous and 80 ambiguous long-range 
correlations; the ambiguous cross peaks each exhibited less than six possible assignments 
within the guessing thresholds of ±0.2 ppm. We also assigned 30 unambiguous and five 
ambiguous long-range 15N-13C correlations in TEDOR experiments24. Taken together, many 
of the unambiguous correlations reported on the key structural features of the folded 
monomer within the fibril: residues G68 and A69 are packed close to the G93 carbonyl (Fig. 
2a); G47 and V48 are close to the A78 β-carbon (Fig. 2b); the sidechains of I88, A91 and 
F94 exhibit a number of correlations defining a hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 2c); Q79 is 
positioned centrally in the core, with backbone interactions to E46, G47, A76, V77 and V82 
(Fig. 2d), sidechain 13C-13C correlations with A89 and A90 (Fig. 2e), and a sidechain 15N 
exhibiting correlations to methyl groups of V77, V82 and A89 (Fig. 2f). Notably, many of 
these diagnostic correlations were clearly evident at high sensitivity even at short mixing 
times in the TEDOR (Supplementary Fig. 2b–e) and DARR (Supplementary Fig. 2f–k) data 
sets. We converted the cross peak intensities into internuclear distance restraints according to 
our prior studies24,25. In addition, TALOS-N analysis provided 90 backbone dihedral 
restraints26.
A novel Greek-key topology
To determine a unique 3D structure consistent with all NMR data, we implemented 
simulated annealing calculations on a set of ten monomers of α-syn within XPLOR-NIH27. 
We specifically configured the distance potential to consider the explicit contributions from 
intramolecular as well as intermolecular distances from each of the ten monomers, for the 
restraints that were measured on undiluted samples. This approach avoids the bias of 
assuming that individual pairs of nuclei give rise to the observed correlations, and resulted in 
a single backbone fold consistent with the available experimental data.
The resulting structure adopts a β-serpentine arrangement with a Greek-key β-sheet 
topology (Fig. 3a–d). In detail, the fold here exhibits hydrogen bonds in register along the 
fibril axis, which is orthogonal to the hydrogen bond geometry in a standard Greek-key 
motif28 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). The innermost β-sheet of the core includes 
residues 71–82, which are necessary for fibril formation29. Sidechains in the core are tightly 
packed (Supplementary Fig. 3c–f) and well-defined in the ensemble (Fig. 3d). Although the 
stagger of individual sidechains is not uniquely determined13, the lowest energy structures 
(e.g., Fig. 3a) exhibit short distances between E46 and K80 (Supplementary Fig. 3c,g,h) and 
among I88, A91 and F94 (Supplementary Fig. 3f,i,j) of neighboring molecules. In two 
instances, compact residues facilitate an especially close backbone-backbone interaction: (1) 
A69-G93 bridges the distal loops of the Greek key, and (2) G47-A78 adopts a geometry in 
which a stable intermolecular salt bridge can be formed between E46 and K80. Hydrophobic 
sidechain packing among I88, A91 and F94 establish the innermost portion of the Greek key 
(Supplementary Fig. 3f,i,j). V77, V82, A89, and A90 comprise a hydrophobic pocket within 
which the Q79 sidechain forms a glutamine ladder along the fibril axis (Supplementary Fig.

 3k,l). The turns consist mostly of glycine and alanine residues (G67-G68-A69, G73, G84-
A85-G86, A89-A90-A91). Residues 55–62 are disordered, consistent with the incomplete 
resonance assignments and slightly reduced order parameters in this region as measured by 
Comellas et al.8. The fibril core (residues 46–54 and 63–96) exhibits a 1.5 Å backbone root-
mean-squared deviation (RMSD) and 2.0 Å heavy atom RMSD (Table 2). The structure is 
consistent with all observed NMR restraints (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and torsion angles for 
restrained residues (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c).
Structural validation
Low-resolution structural characterization by bright-field negatively stained transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 4a) of single, isolated fibrils demonstrated features of 
highly homogeneous, microscopically ordered fibrils with a width of 4.6 ± 0.4 nm. This 
observation was consistent with our prior results8 and other α-syn fibril studies30–32. 
Further, we applied scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements (Fig. 
4b) to obtain a mass-per-length (MPL) ratio33 of 34.5 ± 3.0 kDa/nm (Fig. 4c), supporting an 
in-register parallel β-sheet structure with one monomer per β-sheet spacing. The high 
precision of MPL ratio data, combined with narrow SSNMR linewidths (~0.2 ppm) and only 
one set of resonance assignments, indicated that the fibril samples were highly homogenous 
and adopted a single core conformation. To test whether the fibrils used in the STEM 
measurements were in the same conformation as those used in the SSNMR study, we 
prepared a sample of fibrils using the same buffer and sonication conditions as used for the 
EM sample preparation and confirmed that the chemical shifts were identical to those 
throughout the rest of this study (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b).
X-ray fiber diffraction patterns (Fig. 4d) from our fibril form exhibited the archetypal 
amyloid meridional diffraction at 4.8 Å indicating a cross-β structure. Strong intensity on 
the equator at about 10 Å resolution is typical of diffraction patterns from amyloids in which 
β-sheets are stacked together. For our α-syn fibril, the intensity was divided into three strong 
peaks, whose center of mass corresponds to an average β-sheet separation of 9.1 Å. The 0.02 
Å−1 spacing of the three peaks indicates an average diameter of the diffracting unit of ~50 Å. 
The width of the structured fibril core from Figure 3 is 4.5 nm, and the average β-sheet 
separation is ~8.9 Å, in excellent agreement with the STEM and fiber diffraction results. A 
diffraction pattern (Fig. 4d) calculated from the SSNMR structure (Fig. 3) agreed well with 
the observed pattern at resolutions between 13 Å and 2.5 Å, including the three peaks near 
10 Å (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5c). Agreement was not as good at lower resolution, 
near the center of Fig. 4d, but this result is not unexpected, since this part of the pattern was 
heavily influenced by the disordered terminal segments of the protein, whose structure is not 
known. The correlation coefficient for the intensities between 0.075 and 0.25 Å−1 (~13 and 4 
Å resolution) was 0.77. This is strong support for the SSNMR structure, bearing in mind that 
a substantial part of the structure, including not only disordered parts but parts expected to 
have an intermediate degree of order, is uncertain. For comparison, the correlation 
coefficient is 0.85 between the pattern predicted from the SSNMR structure of the fungal 
prion HET-s11 and the observed fiber diffraction pattern equator34. Correlation coefficients 
between computed and experimental patterns for samples of HET-s under reduced humidity 
are also very close to the correlation coefficient that we observed for α-syn.

 Discussion
The α-syn fibril structure exhibits many of the stabilizing features of common amyloid 
folds11,14,16,35, including parallel in-register β-sheet hydrogen bonding, an intermolecular 
salt bridge (E46-K80), steric zippers involving the hydrophobic sidechains (such as V49, 
V77 and V82), a glutamine ladder (Q79) along the fibril axis, and hydrophobic packing of a 
methyl-bearing and aromatic residues (I88, A91 and F94). Nevertheless, the α-syn fibril 
structure here is considerably more complex than the earliest predicted β-serpentine models 
of α-syn fibrils32 and recent computational models36. Most recently, a structural model for 
the core of α-syn fibrils was proposed by Rodriguez et al.37, on the basis of micro-electron 
diffraction structures of short peptides simulating the core of α-syn fibrils; this model 
contains a steric zipper as is commonly found in amyloid fibril structures, but it is comprised 
of mostly extended β-sheets. In this case, the peptides used lack the residues that most 
predominately contribute to the folding of the Greek key, including E46, Q79, K80, I88, A91 
and F94. Indeed, structural complexity has been identified in general as an important factor 
in the stability of self-propagating amyloid fibrils38. For α-syn in particular, we note that the 
especially compact Greek-key topology is facilitated by a large fraction of small, flexible 
amino acid residues (glycine, alanine or serine) in the core of the fibril. Not only within the 
KTKEGV repeats, but also in the intervening residues, these sequence motifs enable α-syn 
to adapt from an intrinsically unstructured protein in solution to a well ordered hairpin of 
tightly pitched helices in complex with micelles39 or broken helices on lipid vesicles40, to 
the particular arrangement in the fibril core as observed here. Specifically, more than 40% 
structured residues in the α-syn fibril core (18 out of 43) are glycine, alanine or serine. We 
therefore attribute the novel yet highly specific ordering of the fibril core in part to the 
prevalence of small residues. Thus, the long β-sheets identified in our prior study8 are not 
fully extended, but adopt a more compact arrangement due to this high prevalence of 
residues with small sidechains that can maintain dihedral angles characteristic of β-sheet 
residues while relieving the energetic strain of extended parallel β-sheets, which are rarely 
longer than seven amino acid residues41.
α-Syn fibrils isolated from the substantia nigra of PD patient brains have a diameter of ~5 
nm for single untwisted fibrils42, consistent with the value of 4.6 nm in our structure and 
further supported by our EM and fiber diffraction data (Fig. 4). The spacing of the three 
distinct strong peaks on the equator in our fiber diffraction pattern (Fig. 4d and 
Supplementary Fig. 5c) corresponds to a single, narrow fibril unit. Bousset et al. identified 
cylindrical fibrils that are substantially wider (13±2 nm)10, which could be attributable to the 
lateral association of two to three individual protofilaments, as observed in amyloid-β13,35. 
Other α-syn fibril forms examined by SSNMR exhibit different secondary structure 
elements from the form studied here, most notably near residues K45, V74 and V82 which 
in our form are in β-sheets, while in other forms are in turn or loop regions10,43. Based on 
these observations, it is likely that the additional fibril forms adopt tertiary core structures 
that differ from the one in this work, accounting for the observed SSNMR, EM, and fiber 
diffraction data10.
Several missense mutations of α-syn, including A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D and A53T, have 
been implicated in autosomal-dominant PD inheritance44–48. Previous work by some of us

 presented the SSNMR chemical shift assignments of three early-onset PD mutants—A30P 
(Ref. 49) and E46K and A53T (Ref. 50)—and fibrils grown in the presence of 
phospholipids51. In the cases of A30P and A53T, we observed that the chemical shifts and 
secondary structures were nearly identical to those of this form with only small perturbations 
to sites proximal to the mutation49,50 (Supplementary Fig. 6). In the presence of 
phospholipids, we again noted that the chemical shifts of the core residues were largely 
unchanged, with differences localized to the N-terminal residues that are known to directly 
interact with lipids51. The lack of perturbations in the chemical shifts revealed that the 
structure of these different fibril samples must be very similar. A previous SSNMR study of 
fibrils formed from mouse α-syn52 also identified a secondary structure that is highly similar 
to the form examined in the present study. With the E46K mutant, however, we noticed large 
chemical shift perturbations for many sites throughout the core of the fibril, suggesting a 
substantial change in fibril structure50, which is understood readily in the context of our 3D 
structure, which demonstrates that residues E46 and K80 form an intermolecular salt bridge 
that is not compatible with the E46K mutant.
We envision that the α-syn fibril structure presented here will enable the systematic 
development of improved ligands for diagnosis of PD and development of biomarker assays. 
This idea has been demonstrated in the case of Aβ fibrils implicated in Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), where seeding monomeric Aβ with material from AD patients’ brains can produce 
different strains with structural changes that are associated with different disease progression 
patterns14. Such high-resolution Aβ fibril structures have enabled structure-based discovery 
of small molecule ligands that bind longitudinally53. In the case of α-syn fibrils, 
phenothiazine derivatives have been identified as lead compounds for positron emission 
tomography imaging54. In the structure, we see exposed surfaces on β-sheets surrounding 
the central non-amyloid component of the core, including residues 46–67 and 82–86, that 
may be potential binding regions for such ligands, although a majority of the residues in the 
non-amyloid component are inaccessible, consistent with proteinase-K digestion studies of 
α-syn fibrils55. Prior studies have established that two other strains of α-syn fibrils possess 
different secondary structures, levels of toxicity, and propagation properties,6 which may be 
due to different exposed regions in their fibril structures10. The detailed 3D structures of 
these forms therefore will be highly beneficial for comparison in the future. Meanwhile, the 
structure reported here establishes a basis for understanding of the structural differences 
among α-syn fibril strains, for improving the mechanistic understanding of templated 
recruitment and propagation in α-synucleinopathies, and for developing imaging agents and 
PD drug candidates.
Methods
α-Synuclein fibril sample preparation for solid-state NMR studies
Samples of α-synuclein (α-syn) protein used in this study were expressed and purified as 
described previously17. The expression protocol of Marley et al.56 was modified for sparse 
labeling using a glycerol carbon source57 as follows: A pre-culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/
pET28a-AS was prepared in Studier medium M (Ref. 58) containing 2 g/L ammonium 
chloride, 2 g/L glycerol, 1 mL/L BME vitamins (Sigma-Aldrich no. B6891), and kanamycin.

 The culture (200 mL/2-L baffled flask) grew with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C to a cell 
density of near saturation (absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 2.2–2.7). Cells were then 
collected by centrifugation at 25 °C and resuspended in half the original culture volume of 
fresh medium M containing 2 g/L 15N-ammonium chloride, and either 4 g/L 1,3-13C-
glycerol and 1 g/L natural abundance sodium carbonate or 4 g/L 2-13C-glycerol and 1 g/L 
sodium 13C-carbonate. The sodium carbonate was added to prevent isotopic dilution due to 
reversible carboxylase activity57. The resuspended culture (100 mL/1-L flask) was shaken 
for 30 min at 25 °C, and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells 
were harvested at 13 h. The cell density (A600) at induction was in the range 5–6 and at 
harvest in the range 7–9. Protein was purified using hydrophobic interaction 
chromatography and size exclusion chromatography17 with a yield of 130–150 mg α-syn 
per L culture medium. Isotopically-labeled (1,3-13C and 2-13C) glycerol, 15N-ammonium 
chloride and sodium 13C-carbonate were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 
Andover, MA. The monomer solution was concentrated to a solution of 15 mg/mL in 
sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) with 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDTA) and 0.02% sodium azide (w/v), and was fibrillized at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm 
for 3 weeks, after which the fibrils were pelleted, washed with deionized water, dried under 
nitrogen gas overnight and packed into 3.2 mm rotors as described by Comellas et al.8.
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy and data processing
Magic-angle spinning (MAS) SSNMR experiments were conducted at 11.7 T (500 MHz 1H 
frequency), 14.1 T (600 MHz), and 17.6 T (750 MHz) on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Santa 
Clara, CA) VNMRS (500 and 750 MHz) and Varian Inc. (formerly of Palo Alto, CA and 
Fort Collins, CO) InfinityPlus (600 MHz) spectrometers using 3.2 mm Balun probes 
(Varian). Spinning was controlled with a Varian MAS controller to 11,111 ± 3 Hz (500 
MHz 1H frequency), 10,000 kHz or 13,333 kHz (600 MHz 1H frequency), and 12,500 Hz 
(750 MHz 1H frequency). Typical pulse widths were ~2–2.5 μs for 1H, ~3 μs for 13C, and ~5 
μs for 15N. We used 75–80 kHz small phase incremental alternation (SPINAL) decoupling 
during evolution and acquisition optimized according to Ref. 59. Experiments were 
performed at a variable-temperature (VT) setting of 10 °C, which is calibrated by ethylene 
glycol to a sample temperature of 12–17 °C. Chemical shifts were externally referenced 
using adamantane with the downfield peak set to 40.48 ppm60. Chemical shifts for each 
sample were confirmed to agree with those previously reported8 using 2D 13C-13C, 
3D 15N-13C-13C, 13C-15N-13C and 13C-13C-13C correlation experiments.
Spectra were processed with NMRPipe61 with back linear prediction with a polynomial 
baseline correction to the first dimension. Lorentzian-to-Gaussian apodization, phase-shifted 
cosine bells, and zero filling were applied in each dimension prior to Fourier transformation 
and phasing. Spectra were analyzed in Sparky (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/;

XPLOR-NIH structure calculations
XPLOR-NIH version 2.33.4 was used for structure calculations. Ten extended monomers of 
full-length α-syn were aligned along the z-axis with a 20 Å separation from one monomer to 
the next. Since we observed a single chemical shift for each residue in the core region

 (residues 30 to 95), these residues were restrained in each monomer using non-
crystallographic symmetry restraints implemented using PosDiffPot term in XPLOR-NIH. 
NOE restraints from samples where it was not possible to determine whether a correlation 
was inter- or intramolecular were included in a separate potential by setting nMono to 10 
within the NOE potential; this approach avoids the bias of assuming that individual pairs of 
nuclei give rise to the observed correlations. Restraints that were explicitly intermolecular or 
intramolecular were included in NOE potentials with nMono set to one with a copy of each 
restraint for each monomer. Because the distance restraints were applied to all subunits, 
translational symmetry was thus implicitly applied. The initial annealing calculation of 256 
structures started at 5,000 K with a high temperature dynamics run for 10 ps or 5,000 steps, 
whichever comes first, beginning with a 0.001 ps timestep that self adjusts depending on 
energy conservation from one step to the next. After the high-temperature calculation, the 
temperature was reduced to 20 K in steps of 20K. At each temperature step, a trajectory was 
run 0.4 ps or 500 steps, whichever came first, with an initial 0.001 ps timestep. A gyration 
volume term62 was applied to residues 46–94 of all subunits.
The empirical hydrogen bond database63 and a statistical torsion angle potential64 were 
utilized in addition to terms for bond lengths, bond angles and improper angles. After the 
initial structure calculation phase, each structure was refined using slow annealing from 
3000 K to 20 K in 4 K steps. Force constants for the restraint terms were ramped as follows: 
ambiguous distance restraints were ramped from 0.01 to 40 kcal/mol/Å2 in the initial phase 
and from 40 to 50 kcal/mol/Å2 in the refinement phase; unambiguous distance restraints 
were ramped from 0.01 to 20 kcal/mol/Å2 in the initial phase and from 20 to 25 kcal/mol/Å2 
in the refinement phase; dihedral restraints were ramped from 10 to 150 kcal/mol/rad2 in the 
initial phase and from 150 to 300 kcal/mol/rad2 during refinement; the gyration volume was 
scaled from 10−3 to 0.1 during the initial phase and from 0.1 to 5.0 during refinement. From 
the resulting 256 structures we took the best 32 structures based on their relative energies for 
further analysis. In each of the structures the backbone and relative sidechain orientations 
were identical, but because the XPLOR-NIH calculation did not explicitly specify whether a 
restraint was intermolecular or intramolecular, there was a differing degree of structurally 
distinct intermolecular sidechain packing (the intrafibril quaternary structural features). 
Similar quaternary contacts have been observed in previous studies with Aβ (Ref. 13). For 
instance, the data support an intermolecular sidechain interaction between K80 and E46, but 
we could not uniquely determine whether the stagger of those sidechains would be +1 or −1. 
We observed this same phenomenon with the I88-A91-F94 interactions, with three different 
populations of intermolecular sidechain orientations, one with moderate sidechain 
interactions with a + orientation, as well as the +1 and −1 sidechain stagger. The structure 
presented in the main text corresponds to the most highly populated state in the XPLOR-
NIH calculations, with a moderate + stagger for the aromatic sidechain of F94 and a +1 
stagger for K80. The resulting structure had 77.2% of residues in the most favored 
Ramachandran space, 18.1% in allowed regions, 3.1% in generous regions, and 1.6% in 
disallowed regions. All residues with disallowed Ramachandran conformations were in 
disordered regions or unrestrained termini, which is consistent with the MolProbity65 clash 
score (4.76) and overall score (1.95) showing that the structure is of high quality except in 
these few disallowed Ramachandran conformations.

 Primary neuronal cultures and fibril treatment
Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from E15–E17 embryos of CD1 mice (Charles 
River). All procedures were performed according to the US National Institutes of Health 
Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and were approved by the University 
of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Dissociated hippocampal 
neurons were plated onto poly-D-lysine coated 13 mm coverslips in a 24 well plate at 
100,000 cells/coverslip and allowed to mature for 10 days. Pre-formed fibril (PFF) treatment 
was performed at 10 days in vitro, whereby α-syn PFFs were diluted to 2.3 μM or 0.23 μM 
(33.3 μg/mL or 3.3 μg/mL) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), calcium and 
magnesium-free, and sonicated for 5 min on the high setting with a Diagenode Biorupter™ 
(30 s on, 30 s off, 10 °C bath temp). In total, 11 samples of each dilution were independently 
prepared. Neurons were then treated with PBS or sonicated PFFs to give final α-syn 
concentrations of 0, 9.4, 17.3, 34.6, 69.2, 138, 277, and 415 nM. Three coverslips were 
treated at each concentration. Beginning at 4 days post treatment, 200 μL of the media was 
carefully removed from each well and transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen for later 
cytotoxicity testing. Fresh, pre-warmed neuronal media (200 μL) was then added back to 
each well. Treated neurons were harvested for immunocytochemistry at 18 days post 
treatment (28DIV). Endotoxin levels were measured for the fibrils in this study using the 
PierceTM LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit per the manufactures instructions 
and found to be between 0.0094–0.0452 endotoxin unit (EU) per treatment (0.0031–0.0151 
EU per μg α-syn).
Immunocytochemistry
Neurons were fixed and permeabilized with pre-warmed 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 
PBS containing 4% sucrose and 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min to remove soluble proteins. 
After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% fetal bovine serium in PBS for at 
least 1 hr at room temperature, neurons were incubated with 81A (pSer129 α-syn, 
ab184674, Abcam®) and HuA (total synuclein, doi: 10.1083/jcb.200403061) overnight at 
4 °C followed by staining with appropriate Alexa fluor 594 or 488-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA, A-11032 
and A-11034, 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on to 
glass slides with eBioscience Fluoromount G™ with deoxyribonucleic acid binding dye 2-
(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine (DAPI) and scanned on a Perkin Elmer 
Lamina™ scanner. Quantification was performed using Indica Labs HALO™ software 
((area occupied × average intensity)/DAPI count) and data is reported as an average of three 
coverslips. Graphing (Figure 1i) was performed with Graphpad Prism 4™, Error bar, S.E.M.
Cytotoxicity assay
Toxicity was assessed using media sampled from neurons every other day beginning at 4 
days post-treatment through 18 days post-treatment using the Pierce™ LDH Cytotoxicity 
assay kit per the manufacturer’s instructions. Data was recorded using a Molecular Devices 
Spectramax™ plate reader. Graphing (Figure 1C) was performed using Graphpad Prism 4 
and statistical significance was determined with the same software using a two-way analysis 
of variance with Bonferroni correction. * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, Error bar, s.e.m.

 Preparation of the fibril samples for electron microscopy
After ultracentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-
piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.4, 0.02 % sodium azide and 0.1 mM 
EDTA) and ultracentrifuged. This cycle was repeated several times and the final solution 
was sonicated (600 volts, 5 amps) three times using 1 min pulses.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Negatively stained α-syn samples for TEM were prepared by resuspending the fibrils in 20 
mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide and 0.1 mM EDTA); Karnovsky’s fixative 
was added and a drop was placed over Parafilm. A formvar carbon coated grid (300 mesh) 
was positioned face down on the drop for 15 min to adsorb the fibrils. The grid was then 
placed for 2.5 min in a drop of 0.2% ammonium molybdate (w/v) for negative staining, 
wicked in a drop of water and allowed to dry. Electron micrographs were recorded in a 
Hitachi H600 Transmission Electron Microscope, operating at 75 kV.
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)
α-Syn samples for STEM were prepared using the wet film approach with freeze-dried 
specimens. Titanium grids (2.3 mm) were coated with thick holey carbon film that supported 
a thin carbon film. The thin carbon film was prepared by ultra-high vacuum evaporation onto 
a freshly cleaved crystal of rock salt and floated on a dish of clean water to avoid non-
specific absorption of material. Grids were then positioned face down on the floating thin 
carbon films and picked so that the thin carbon film retained a droplet of water. This water 
was exchanged by washing with injection buffer containing 2 μL of tobacco mosaic virus 
(TMV) as quantitative internal control at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, incubated for 1 min 
and washed four times. Three different grids were prepared by adding 2 μL of α-syn fibrils 
at the concentrations of 120 μg/mL, 300 μg/mL and 1200 μg/mL in 20 mM HEPES buffer, 
respectively, incubated for 1 min and washed ten times with the buffer and water. After the 
final wash, the grid was pinched between two pieces of paper filters and immediately 
plunged into liquid nitrogen slush. The grids were then transferred under liquid nitrogen to 
an ion-pumped freeze dryer with an efficient cold trap, freeze-dried overnight by gradually 
warming to −80°C and transferred under vacuum to the STEM. Dark-field micrographs were 
recorded on a custom-built STEM, operating at 40 kV, with a probe focused at 0.25 nm and 
a sample temperature of −150° C.
Mass-per-length measurement and analysis of STEM images
Dark-field STEM micrographs with 512 × 512 points and a dwell of 30 μs per pixel were 
analyzed using the PCMass software available from the Brookhaven STEM resource (ftp://
ftp.stem.bnl.gov/pub/PCMass32)66. The mass-per-length (MPL) measurements were 
conducted using boxes of 30 nm length and the appropriate widths from the #21 (TMV) and 
#55 (amyloid) fitting functions, respectively, from PCMass31. The fitting function was used 
for alignment and quality control only and had no effect on measured MPL. The resulting 
data were normalized to the known MPL of TMV (131.4 kDa/nm). Histograms of the α-syn 
fibril MPL measurement were calculated with 1-kDa/nm bins and the main peak was fitted 
to a Gaussian distribution using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm, as implemented in 
Tuttle et al.

 Sigma Plot (Systat Software; https://systatsoftware.com/products/sigmaplot/). STEM images 
were also used to measure the variation of the fibril widths in steps of 5-nm along the fibrils 
using the PCMass software66. At each step, the fibril density was determined by averaging 
each point with the 5 nm length of fibril in each direction to increase the signal-to noise. As 
previously demonstrated for HET-s (Ref. 67), fibrils composed of multiple single fibrils 
wound around each other vary systematically in projected diameter along their length, while 
for double fibrils consisting of two singlet fibrils, the projected diameters varies from a 
single fibril diameter to twice that measurement.
X-ray fiber diffraction
Fibers were prepared68 by suspending a 5–10 μl drop of fibril suspension between two glass 
rods approximately 1.5 mm apart. The fibers were allowed to dry for several days in a closed 
chamber under high humidity (nominally 100% in equilibrium with water). Diffraction data 
were collected at beamline 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Fibers 
were dusted with calcite and specimen-to-detector distances were determined from the 012 
calcite diffraction ring at 3.8547 Å resolution69. Diffraction data were transformed into 
reciprocal space70 and background subtracted using the program WCEN71. Equatorial 
intensity plots were produced from processed patterns using WCEN by integrating over a 
20° angle centered on the equator. Plots from each diffraction pattern were linearly scaled 
using a coefficient determined by least-squares fitting of the continuous equatorial 
diffraction data between 0.075 and 0.25 Å−1 (~13−4 Å).
Diffraction patterns were calculated using DISORDER, a program that calculates Fourier-
Bessel transforms72 and simulates disorientation73. DISORDER and its associated 
documentation are available on request. B-factors of 4000 Å2 were used for disordered 
regions (residues 1–29 and 114–140) to simulate large disorder. B-factors of 30 Å2 were 
used for the ordered core (residues 42–98). B-factors of 100 Å2 were used for the remaining 
residues, to simulate an intermediate degree of order.
