Aims: We aimed to determine whether the levels of total serum IgM and IgG, together with specific antibodies
against malondialdehyde-conjugated low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL), can improve cardiovascular risk dis-
crimination.
Methods and Results: The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) randomized 9098 patients in the
UK and Ireland into the Blood Pressure-Lowering Arm. 485 patients that had cardiovascular (CV) events over
5.5 years were age and sex matched with 1367 controls. Higher baseline total serum IgG, and to a lesser extent
IgM, were associated with decreased risk of CV events (IgG odds ratio (OR) per one standard deviation (SD)
0.80 [95% confidence interval, CI 0.72,0.89], p b 0.0001; IgM 0.83[0.75,0.93], p = 0.001), and particularly events
due to coronary heart disease (CHD) (IgG OR 0.66 (0.57,0.76); p b 0.0001, IgM OR 0.81 (0.71,0.93); p = 0.002).
The association persisted after adjustment for a basic model with variables in the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) as
well as following inclusion of C-reactive protein (CRP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
(NtProBNP). IgG and IgM antibodies against MDA-LDL were also associated with CV events but their significance
was lost following adjustment for total serum IgG and IgM respectively. The area under the receiver operator
curve for CV events was improved from the basic risk model when adding in total serum IgG, and there was im-
provement in continuous and categorical net reclassification (17.6% and 7.5% respectively) as well as in the inte-
grated discrimination index.
Conclusion: High total serum IgG levels are an independent predictor of freedom from adverse cardiovascular
events, particularly those attributed to CHD, in patients with hypertension.

1. Introduction
Efforts to improve the predictive capacity of existing cardiovascular
risk-scoring models have been intense and have included the study of
both novel blood and imaging biomarkers (Hoefer et al., 2015). Despite
this, better and affordable tools to predict cardiovascular risk are still
needed to avoid misclassification of “high risk” patients and resultant
over- or under-treatment (Yeboah et al., 2015).
Atherosclerosis, the main pathological entity that leads to cardiovas-
cular events, is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the innate and
adaptive immune systems can play pathological or protective roles, de-
pending on context (Hansson and Libby, 2006). Although total serum
immunoglobulins (Igs) are not normally considered as relevant to clin-
ical CV disease, there is abundant evidence in the preclinical literature to
suggest links with atherosclerosis. Our group established that mice de-
ficient in IgM develop marked acceleration of atherosclerosis (Lewis et
al., 2009). Moreover, passive immunization of mice with polyclonal
IgM or IgG, or adoptive transfer of IgM-secreting B-1 cells, retards ath-
erosclerosis progression (Nicoletti et al., 1998; Yuan et al., 2003; Kyaw
et al., 2011; Cesena et al., 2012; Rosenfeld et al., 2015). On the other
hand, depletion of IgG-secreting B cells reduces atherosclerosis and

 their adoptive transfer accelerates it (Ait-Oufella et al., 2010; Kyaw et al.,
2010). Whilst the weight of evidence favors IgM being protective, there
is still uncertainty as to how IgG antibodies influence atherosclerosis, in
view of the pathogenic potential of IgG Fc-mediated pro-inflammatory
effector functions.
A previous study found that serum IgG but not IgM was associated
with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in dyslipidemic patients
(Kovanen et al., 1998), whilst another failed to show any association be-
tween IgG or IgM and risk of myocardial infarction in a general popula-
tion (Muscari et al., 1995). However, the roles of specific antibodies as
biomarkers in atherosclerosis have been more extensively studied.
These include antibodies directed against epitopes induced by oxidative
modifications of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in particular antibodies
reacting with phosphorylcholine or adducted malondialdehyde (MDA),
as well as many less well-defined epitopes (Leibundgut et al., 2013;
Tsiantoulas et al., 2014). In the Bruneck study, IgG antibodies against
copper-oxidized LDL (heavily-oxidized LDL that includes MDA-LDL epi-
topes) were associated with higher risk of CV events, whilst IgM anti-
bodies were associated with lower risk (Rosenfeld et al., 1990;
Tsimikas et al., 2012). In contrast, the EPIC Norfolk study implicated
IgG and IgM anti-MDA-LDL antibodies as possible modifiers of the risk
associated with oxidative biomarkers, rather than independent predic-
tors of coronary artery disease events (Ravandi et al., 2011). Recently,
a study from Sweden has reported that individuals with low levels of
antibodies against MDA-adducted LDL peptides are associated with sig-
nificantly higher coronary acute event rate (Bjorkbacka et al., 2016).
The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) was an in-
dependent, investigator-led, multicenter, randomized trial designed to
compare two anti-hypertensive treatment strategies for the prevention
of CV events in more than 19,000 hypertensive patients without a clin-
ical history of CHD. Using a nested case-control substudy of ASCOT, we
set out to test the hypothesis that total serum IgM and IgG levels, as
well as antibodies to MDA-LDL, are negative risk factors for cardiovascu-
lar events in a hypertensive population. Our analyses incorporated ad-
justments for levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and N-terminal pro-B-
type natriuretic peptide (NtProBNP), which have previously been stud-
ied in the ASCOT population (Sever et al., 2012; Welsh et al., 2014).
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Subjects
ASCOT was an independent, investigator-led, multicenter, random-
ized trial designed to compare two anti-hypertensive treatment strate-
gies for the prevention of CV events in more than 19,000 hypertensive
patients without a clinical history of CHD (9098 were randomized in
the UK or Ireland). Hypertensive patients with three or more other
risk factors for CV disease were eligible for inclusion in ASCOT. The de-
tailed ASCOT protocol has been published previously and further infor-
mation is available at http://www.ascotstudy.org (Sever et al., 2001).
Informed consent was obtained from each patient and the study proto-
col conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsin-
ki as reflected in a prior approval by the participating institutions
research ethics committees. In the main cohort, the ASCOT-Blood Pres-
sure-Lowering Arm (BPLA), subjects received a beta-blocker with a thi-
azide diuretic as required or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker
(CCB) with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as required
(Sever et al., 2006). In addition to randomization into ASCOT-BPLA,
those with a fasting total cholesterol of ≤6.5 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)
were further randomized, using a factorial design, to either 10 mg ator-
vastatin daily or matching placebo (ASCOT-LLA) (Sever et al., 2003;
Dahlof et al., 2005). Baseline characteristics of participants and primary
outcomes of each arm of the trial have been reported previously (Sever
et al., 2001; Dahlof et al., 2005).
For the purposes of this case-control study (CCS), all events of fatal
coronary heart disease (CHD), symptomatic non-fatal myocardial
infarction (MI), coronary revascularization, and fatal and non-fatal
stroke occurring in the UK and Ireland during the ASCOT-BPLA study pe-
riod between February 1998 and October 2005 were identified as cases.
Subjects with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline (in-
cluding peripheral vascular disease and previous history of stroke, tran-
sient ischemic attack and recorded other relevant CVD) were excluded
from this CCS. Hence, the present report is based on a nested CCS
drawn from ASCOT participants in the UK and Ireland, 485 of whom de-
veloped CV events (355 CHD and 130 strokes) during a median follow-
up period of 5.5 years. Further details of the selection process into the
study are shown in Fig. 1.
Subjects who were alive and free from CV events during the study
period were selected from the same study population as controls. Up
to three controls were matched to each case by age (±1 year), sex
and study entry time (±90 days), with one control being used with
two different cases to facilitate matching. The study population was re-
stricted to those self-defined as of white European ethnicity.

 2.2. Endpoint Adjudication
All cases suspected of fulfilling criteria for the fatal and non-fatal
events were classified by the Endpoint Committee. This included end-
points notified by investigators and potential silent MIs identified by
the core ECG laboratory. All the documentation for each potential end-
point was reviewed independently by two of the Endpoint Committee
members. In the event of disagreement, a third member the Endpoint
Committee adjudicated. Final classification required agreement be-
tween two members of the Endpoint Committee. The Endpoint Com-
mittee met to resolve such disagreements and “grey cases.”
2.3. Measurements
All major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors incorporated in
the FRS were determined at baseline (Sever et al., 2001). Sera were pre-
pared and aliquoted at entry to the study, and stored at −70 °C prior to
analysis. Serum IgM and IgG, and anti-MDA-LDL antibodies, were mea-
sured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (see below).
Other laboratory tests (including CRP and NtProBNP) were performed
as previously described (www.ascotstudy.org) (Sever et al., 2012;
Welsh et al., 2014).
2.4. Immunoglobulin and Anti-MDA-LDL Antibody Level Measurements by
ELISA
All ELISAs were conducted blindly with both cases and controls
mixed according to random laboratory sample number. Personnel
conducting assays were blind to patient-specific data and not aware of
the statistical analysis plan. The intra-plate variability for all assays
was below 3% and inter-plate variability below 13%, with assay ranges
that span well above and below expected normal ranges for total IgG
and IgM and well below and above the study range for IgG and IgM
anti-MDA-LDL (Supplementary Methods Table 1).
Total IgG and IgM antibody levels were measured using capture
ELISA. Briefly, either goat anti-human IgG or mouse anti-human IgM
(Southern Biotech, Birmingham AL) was used to capture either IgG or
IgM respectively. Detection antibodies used were either biotinylated
goat F(ab')² anti-human IgG or biotinylated mouse anti-human IgM
(both Southern Biotech). Detection was with HRP-conjugated
streptavidin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by 3,3′,5,5′-
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma Aldrich, UK), and the reaction
was stopped with 0.5 M H2SO4. Optical densities were measured with
a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek, USA) at wavelength 450 nm.
Once background was subtracted, results were expressed in Units (U).
Cut off and tertile as well as interquartile values in mg/mL for total IgG
and IgM were interpolated via standard curve fit using standard ELISA
methodology in PRISM 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, Ca).
IgG and IgM anti-MDA-LDL antibody levels were estimated by ELISA
against solid phase MDA-LDL. Briefly, MDA-LDL was prepared as de-
scribed (Palinski et al., 1990). The extent of modification was deter-
mined by the relative electrophoretic mobility of the LDL using pre-
cast 0.6% agarose, 1.0% barbital buffer gels (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
Ca) and with a carbonyl assay (Chang et al., 2012). IgG and IgM antibody
binding to solid phase antigens was identified by mouse anti-human
IgG (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) or biotinylated mouse
anti-human IgM (Cambridge Bioscience) followed by horse radish per-
oxidase (HRP) conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako, Cambridgeshire,
UK) or as above with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The plates were read
as above at an optical density of 450 nm (OD450), after which the back-
ground was subtracted. All serum anti-MDA-LDL sample values were
corrected to a reference serum with a standard curve used on all plates
and results expressed in Units (U).
All assays were optimized for serum concentration, secondary anti-
body concentration and timing of TMB reactions using representative
sera. Standard curves were established for each of the assays on several
representative sera and selected serum dilution was at the steepest part
of the curve to achieve the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, standard
curves were included for a control serum on each ELISA plate for quality
control. The lower and higher limit of assay sensitivity for all assays are
shown in Supplementary Methods Table 1. The intra-plate and inter-
plate coefficients of variation (CoV) for all assays are in Supplementary
Methods Table 2.
2.5. Statistical Methods
Continuous variables are presented as means ± standard deviation
(SD), and non-normally distributed variables as medians with inter-
quartile range (IQR). Crude comparisons between cases and controls
with regard to baseline characteristics were explored by t-tests,
Mann-Whitney U or χ2 tests. Age- and sex-adjusted correlations be-
tween continuous variables were assessed using the Spearman rank-
correlation coefficient (rho). The association between each of the anti-
bodies and the risk of CV events was reported as an odds ratio (OR) ob-
tained from a conditional logistic regression model: first by treating
each log-transformed baseline antibody as a continuous variable giving
an odds with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of having an event per 1 SD
change; and, secondly, by categorizing variables into tertiles with the
low tertile as reference. To assess the predictive role of Igs and specific
antibodies beyond conventional risk factors, we established five statisti-
cal models. Model 1 was matched for age and sex but was otherwise un-
adjusted; model 2 was adjusted for traditional CV risk factors based on
an extended Framingham risk model (smoking, baseline systolic blood
pressure (SBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC),
body mass index (BMI), creatinine), as well as randomized anti-hyper-
tensive and statin treatment; model 3 included paired antibody levels
and serum Ig (i.e. IgM anti-MDA-LDL with IgM and IgG anti-MDA-LDL
with IgG) to assess the effect of adjustment for total serum Ig; model
4 adjusted for log CRP and log NtProBNP in addition to the covariates
in model 2. Collinearity was tested using the variance inflation factor
(VIF), and model goodness-of-fit and calibration was assessed using a
likelihood ratio test and the Hosmer Lemeshow statistic. To examine
the extent to which baseline log-transformed variable improved dis-
crimination and reclassified participants over risk thresholds, model 2
plus further adjustment for age and sex was used in an unconditional lo-
gistic model. This reference model was compared with models includ-
ing each log-transformed variable using area under receiver operator
curves (AUROC), net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated dis-
crimination index (IDI) (Pencina et al., 2011).
All statistics were conducted independently by a statistician that is
blinded to the laboratory techniques, using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata release 12 (Stata Corp, College Station,
TX). A two-tailed p value b0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Discrimination of the different risk models was assessed by the areas
under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) using the
nonparametric approach of DeLong et al. (DeLong et al., 1988). Likeli-
hood ratio tests were performed to evaluate whether the global model
fit improved after the addition of each of the antibody in turn. Model
calibration was assessed with the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit
test. We also computed the NRI as a continuous and category-based
NRI and an integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis. IDI
is defined as the difference in the mean predicted probability of being
a case and being a control in the model with the addition of antibody
minus the difference in the mean predicted probability of being a case
and being a control in the model without the antibody level included.
We also investigated whether the use of combinations of total serum
Igs and anti-MDA-LDL antibodies would improve risk prediction. In
these analyses, each of these study antibodies was treated as a continu-
ous variable. Further NRI analyses for the most significant independent
markers was undertaken to test reclassification within FRS with

 categories (b10%, 10–20% and N20% risk) were selected to define as low,
intermediate and high risk of CVD.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline Characteristics
1753 subjects (mean age 65.3 ± 7.62 years; 1486, 84.8% male) were
included in this nested case-control analysis (Fig. 1 and Table 1) and had
a median follow-up of 5.5 years (interquartile range, 5.0–6.0). Of the
470 cases that were analyzed (Fig. 1), there were 343 with CHD and
127 who had a stroke (see breakdown in Table 1 footnote). Those
with a CV event had a worse cardiovascular profile, including traditional
risk factors (SBP, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] and LDL), as well as
higher CRP and NtProBNP as previously shown (Table 1) (Sever et al.,
2012; Welsh et al., 2014). Significantly higher total serum IgG and IgM
levels were found in controls compared to cases (Table 2). Levels of
anti-MDA-LDL antibodies were also higher in controls, although this
was not as pronounced as with total serum Igs, and indeed was only sig-
nificant at p b 0.05 for IgG anti-MDA-LDL antibodies (Table 2).
3.2. Correlations and Interactions Between Variables
IgM anti-MDA-LDL antibody levels correlated strongly with total
serum IgM (rho = 0.78, p b 0.0001), and there was a weaker but still
highly significant correlation for IgG anti-MDA-LDL with total serum
IgG (rho = 0.36, p b 0.0001) (Table 3). Though statistically significant,
correlations between serum IgM and IgG and between IgM anti-MDA-
LDL and IgG anti-MDA-LDL were modest (Table 3). Total IgG and IgG
anti-MDA-LDL antibodies correlated weakly with CRP (rho = 0.13 and
rho = 0.09 respectively). There was also a weak inverse correlation of
IgG anti-MDA-LDL antibodies with LDL cholesterol (rho = −0.085,
p b 0.001).
Serum Ig and anti-MDA-LDL antibodies among the controls did not
strongly correlate with age, SBP, DBP or mean arterial pressure (MAP)
(Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, there was a clear correlation
with sex, with total serum IgM and IgG, as well as IgM anti-MDA-LDL

 antibodies, being higher in women than in men (p b 0.05 for each) (Sup-
plementary Table S2).
3.3. Total Serum IgG and IgM Are Inversely Associated With CV Events
Unadjusted, all Ig and specific antibody levels measured were in-
versely associated with risk of CV events (Table 4, model 1). In the
highest third compared with the lowest, total serum IgG levels had
the strongest association with CV events (OR = 0.62 [95% confidence in-
terval, CI 0.47, 0.81]; p = 0.0004), and the weakest association was seen
with IgM anti-MDA-LDL (OR 0.76 [0.58, 0.98]; p = 0.037). Trends were
similar when the data were evaluated as continuous variables per 1 SD.
Associations between IgM anti-MDA-LDL antibodies and CV events
were modestly attenuated by adjustment for the basic risk variables
and were no longer statistically significant, but associations with total
serum IgG and IgM, or with IgG anti-MDA-LDL, were little affected and
retained significance (Table 4, model 2). Thus, for total serum IgG,
there was an OR of 0.62 (0.46, 0.82) comparing highest and lowest
total IgG levels (p = 0.0007) or an OR of 0.81 (0.72, 0.91) per 1 SD in-
crease in total IgG levels (p = 0.0003). Associations between IgG and
IgM anti-MDA-LDL antibody levels and CV events were abolished after
adjustment for total serum IgG and IgM levels respectively (Table 4,
model 3). The significant inverse associations of total serum Ig levels
with events remained even after adjustment for the basic risk variables
plus log-transformed CRP and NtProBNP (Table 4, model 4). Total serum
IgG remained the strongest predictor of protection after full adjustment
in model 4 (OR 0.81 [0.72, 0.91] per one increase in SD, p = 0.003; OR
0.61 [0.46, 0.82] comparing upper and lower thirds, p = 0.0008).
When exploring the ability of Igs and specific antibodies to predict
events linked to either CHD or stroke, it became clear that the relation-
ships described above for total serum Ig levels are only significant for
CHD (Table 5) and not stroke (Supplementary Table S3). The unadjust-
ed OR for the highest tertiles in predicting CHD was 0.42 for total IgG
(p b 0.0001) and 0.57 for total IgM (p = 0.001) (Table 5). Further ad-
justments in models 2, 3 and 4 demonstrated that again anti-MDA-
LDL antibodies were dependent on total IgG and IgM, and that total
serum Ig levels are independent of basic risk variables, CRP and
NtProBNP as predictors. A further analysis of all CV events excluding
hemorrhagic stroke did not appreciably alter the results shown in

3.4. Total Serum IgG Significantly Improves Prediction of CV Risk
Addition of each of total serum IgG, total serum IgM and IgG anti-
MDA-LDL antibodies significantly improved model fit (Table 6). The
AUROC was significantly improved by total serum IgG (0.6391 vs.
0.6213, p = 0.009), whereas IgG anti-MDA, IgM anti-MDA or total
serum IgM did not significantly increase AUROC. Addition of all four

 measures to the basic model improved model fit and AUROC (0.6421 vs.
0.6213, p = 0.011), but there was no difference in AUROCs between the
basic model including just total serum IgG and the basic model contain-
ing all four measures (Table 6).
The addition of total serum IgG to the basic model resulted in an ab-
solute IDI of 0.9 (p b 0.0001), and the highest NRI (17.6% and 7.5% for
continuous and category-based NRI, respectively) (Table 6). Total
serum IgG also led to the greatest absolute number of subjects with
CV events correctly reclassified: 52 (11.1%) to a higher risk category
and 25 (5.3%) to a lower risk category (Fig. 2). Of the 1284 controls,
71 (5.5%) were correctly reclassified using total serum IgG to a higher
risk category and 94 (7.3%) to a lower risk category (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 dem-
onstrates the clinically relevant reclassification into and out of the b10%
risk category for CVD, with a clear advantage of adding in total serum
IgG to the model. Total serum IgG also performed best for CV event
risk reclassification (18.6 and 8.3%, for continuous and category-based
NRI, respectively) in the extended basic model (basic model + CRP
and NtProBNP) (Supplementary Table S5).
There was a much more pronounced improvement in model perfor-
mance when studying CHD alone. The most significant increase in
AUROC, and highest NRI and IDI were after the addition of total IgG to
either the basic model or the extended model (Supplementary Tables
S6 and S7). The finding that total serum IgG results in a continuous
NRI of a 29.6% (p b 0.0001) despite adjustment for the basic model,
log CRP and log NtProBNP puts this measurement in the forefront of
risk prediction of CHD in this hypertensive population (Supplementary

not perform better than the basic model plus only total IgG (Supple-
mentary Table S6).
4. Discussion
The main novel finding in this paper is that in patients with hyper-
tension the total IgG serum level, and to a lesser extent the total
serum IgM level, is an independent predictor of freedom from CV events
in general and from CHD in particular. Furthermore, total serum Ig levels
significantly improved risk classification for CV events. High IgG and
IgM levels were not associated with freedom from stroke, probably
reflecting its more heterogeneous underlying pathology.
Although IgG and IgM anti-MDA-LDL antibodies were also signifi-
cantly associated with freedom from CV events, these correlated signif-
icantly with their respective total serum Ig levels. Indeed, total serum
IgM and IgG were much stronger indicators of freedom from events,
and the univariate significance of anti-MDA-LDL antibodies was lost
after adjusting for total serum levels of the respective Ig class. It is
clear however that our comparison of specific antibodies with total
IgG and IgM levels was restricted to those against just one form of oxi-
dized LDL (i.e. MDA-LDL) and it remains possible that other specific au-
toantibodies against modified LDL or other antigens could have greater
negative or positive predictive ability. Nevertheless, our results indicate
that adjustment for total Ig levels will need to form part of further anal-
yses investigating specific antibodies as prognostic markers of CVD.
We postulate that the greater predictive power of total Ig levels re-
flects a broad role of the polyreactive antibody repertoire in cardiovas-
cular protection. On the one hand, the composite antibody repertoire
can be expected to contribute to the safe disposal of a variety of other
endogenous atherogenic autoantigens besides modified LDL, including
apoptotic cells and microparticles (Chang et al., 1999; Chou et al.,
2009; Tsiantoulas et al., 2015). On the other hand, the conventional
role of antibodies in preventing bacterial infection may also be impor-
tant for reducing the rate of atherosclerosis progression and reducing
infection-triggered acute cardiac events (Smeeth et al., 2004). In this
light, the greater predictive capacity of the total IgG level compared to
IgM argues for the importance of a robust adaptive immune response.
Certainly the relative roles of genetic and environmental influences in
setting Ig levels merits further study (Chen et al., 2011; Paavola et al.,
2012), and in this light it is interesting that serum IgG and IgM levels
in our study were significantly higher in women, consistent with previ-
ous observations (Gonzalez-Quintela et al., 2008).
The strong negative association between IgG and IgM levels and CHD
events needs to be considered in the context of other biomarkers that
have been evaluated as adjuncts to traditional risk assessments. Al-
though the ASCOT-CRP substudy concluded that measuring CRP had

statin treatment.

 little utility in refining CV risk assessment beyond classical risk factors in
the study population (Sever et al., 2012), a meta-analysis concluded that
adding CRP to the risk assessment led to predicting one additional event
over a period of 10 years for every 400–500 people screened (Kaptoge et
al., 2012). Not only did IgG levels remain highly significant in predicting
protection from events after adjustment for CRP, they were also inde-
pendent from NtProBNP which was previously shown to be a predictor
of events in ASCOT (Welsh et al., 2014).
A particularly important outcome of the study was the reclassifica-
tion of more cases and less controls into the clinically relevant N10%
risk categories and more controls with less cases in the b10% risk cate-
gory by incorporating total serum IgG in the analysis. If confirmed in fur-
ther cohorts, this has the potential to be used for more robust risk
stratification in hypertension, thus redirecting primary prevention ther-
apies towards those who would benefit the most.
Our findings are at odds with those of Kovanen et al. who showed
that serum IgG levels (as well as IgA and IgE), but not IgM, were predic-
tive of MI (Kovanen et al., 1998). However the two studies differ in en-
trance requirements, with that of Kovanen et al. being selected for
dyslipidemia whilst ours was based on hypertension. It is possible that
IgG levels in our study population might have been affected by hyper-
tension, although we did not detect any correlations with SBP, DBP or
MAP (Chan et al., 2014). It therefore remains to be seen to what degree
our findings on the ASCOT population generalize to wider populations.
In particular, raised Ig levels are probably not associated with freedom
from CV events in patients with autoimmune conditions such rheuma-
toid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in which there is a dis-
ease-related increase in risk of CV events and in which a polyclonal
expansion of Ig levels signifies disease activity. Furthermore, our study
has focused on the prediction of first adverse cardiovascular incidents
in a high risk population, and does not address the relevance of immu-
noglobulins or specific antibodies during and after acute coronary
events.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, our study suggests total serum IgG levels are strongly
and independently associated with lower risk of CHD events in individ-
uals with hypertension. Furthermore, IgG levels appear to significantly
improve prediction beyond established risk predictors, even when in-
cluding CRP and NtProBNP. As the measurement of total serum IgG is
readily available to clinicians and relatively cheap, our findings have
high potential for future clinical translation.
