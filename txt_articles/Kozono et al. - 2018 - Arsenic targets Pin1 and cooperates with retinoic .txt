Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) combination safely cures fatal
acute promyelocytic leukemia, but their mechanisms of action and efficacy are not fully
understood. ATRA inhibits leukemia, breast, and liver cancer by targeting isomerase Pin1, a
master regulator of oncogenic signaling networks. Here we show that ATO targets Pin1 and
cooperates with ATRA to exert potent anticancer activity. ATO inhibits and degrades Pin1,
and suppresses its oncogenic function by noncovalent binding to Pin1’s active site. ATRA
increases cellular ATO uptake through upregulating aquaporin-9. ATO and ATRA, at clinically
safe doses, cooperatively ablate Pin1 to block numerous cancer-driving pathways and inhibit
the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells and tumor-initiating cells in cell and animal
models including patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, like Pin1 knockout, which is sub-
stantiated by comprehensive protein and microRNA analyses. Thus, synergistic targeting of
Pin1 by ATO and ATRA offers an attractive approach to combating breast and other cancers.

 A
ggressive solid tumors are often resistant to targeted
therapies aiming at blocking individual pathways largely
due to the simultaneous activation of a wide range of
interactive
and/or
redundant
pathways
and/or
oncogene
switching1,2. To meet this challenge, it has been proposed to use
various “-omic” techniques to identify all activated pathways in
each tumor and then to use a cocktail of drugs to inhibit indi-
vidual targets/pathways identified1,2. However, individual cancer
cells within a tumor are highly heterogeneous and evolving3, and
many cancer drivers, notably transcription factors, are non-
druggable1,2. Moreover, current therapies do not effectively target
tumor-initiating cells/cancer stem cells (TICs/CSCs), which are
suggested to be responsible for tumor initiation, growth, metas-
tasis, and drug resistance4,5. Identifying and inhibiting single
targets driving multiple signaling mechanisms in cancer cells and
TICs
may
offer
a
promising
strategy
to
overcome
drug
resistance6,7.
As one of the oldest drugs, arsenic has been used to treat a
variety of ailments, ranging from infection to cancer8,9. In the
nineteenth century, arsenic, in the form of Fowler’s solution,
served as an anti-leukemic remedy until its replacement by
radiation and chemotherapy in the early twentieth century8,9. In
1970s, the use of arsenic to treat cancer resurfaced with the dis-
covery of the arsenic-rich traditional Chinese medicine called
“Ai-Ling #1” (magic bullet for cancers #1) for treating acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other cancers8,9. Arsenic tri-
oxide (ATO) was identified as the active component of Ai-Ling #1
and it was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
APL treatment in 19958,9. ATO, when combined with all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, has transformed
APL from being highly fatal to highly curable, with minimal
toxicity even in children10–12. The drug mechanism has long been
attributed to their combined ability to induce degradation of the
disease-causing
oncoprotein
promyelocytic
leukemia-retinoic
acid receptor α (PML-RARα) by acting on the two fusion part-
ners; ATO covalently interacts with Cys in PML, whereas ATRA
activates RARα receptor to induce cell differentiation10–12.
However, their mechanisms of action and efficacy, especially in
other cancers, remain elusive.
ATO has also shown efficacy against other hematologic
malignancies and various solid tumors including breast and liver
cancer9,13. Epidemiological studies have shown that although
drinking water contamination with low ATO levels might
increase cancer risk14, high level ATO drinking water con-
tamination markedly reduces overall breast cancer mortality in
the large affected population by over 50% during a 15-year
contaminating period and in women under 60 by 70%15. How-
ever, the mechanisms mediating these anticancer effects of ATO
are not clear. This question is important because ATO, at ther-
apeutic doses, has an excellent safety profile for treating APL even
in children10–12, although it has notorious toxicity at high doses
due to its covalent binding to cellular targets9,16.
Similarly, regular ATRA, even with a half-life of 45 min, has
moderate but detectable efficacy against solid tumors in clinical
trials, but its second and third generation supposedly much more
potent analogs to target RARs or RXRs show little efficacy in
clinical trials17–19. Even in APL, ATRA’s ability to activate RARs
and induce leukemia cell differentiation can be uncoupled from
its activity to induce PML-RARα degradation, inhibit APL stem
cells, and treat APL20,21. Moreover, ATRA’s ability to activate
RARs cannot explain its activity to destabilize oncoproteins22 and
stabilize tumor suppressors23. These puzzling findings may be
explained by our recent unexpected discovery of ATRA, but its
second-generation and third-generation analogs, as an inhibitor
of Pin124, a major common regulator of oncogenic signaling
networks7,25.
A central signaling mechanism in regulating numerous onco-
proteins and tumor suppressors is Pro-directed Ser/Thr phos-
phorylation (pSer/Thr-Pro) that is regulated by many kinases and
phosphatases7,26, and further controlled by a single proline iso-
merase Pin16,7,25. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that Pin1 is
a critical “driver” and a unique drug target in cancer6,7,25. Pin1 is
hyperactivated in most human cancers and correlates with poor
clinical outcome6,7,25, whereas humans with genetic polymorph-
isms that reduce PIN1 expression have a lower risk for multiple
cancers6,7,25. Pin1 knockout (−/−, KO) mice are highly resistant
to tumorigenesis even amid overexpression of oncogenes such as
HER227, RAS27, Myc28, or after mutation29 or ablation30 of
tumor suppressors such as p53. Conversely, Pin1 overexpression
disrupts cell cycle coordination leading to chromosome instability
and cancer development31. Pin1 activates at least 43 oncopro-
teins, inactivates over 20 tumor suppressors, and downregulates
global microRNAs, acting as the “master” post-phosphorylation
regulator of oncogenic signaling networks7,25,32. Moreover, Pin1
is highly enriched in breast TICs/CSCs to drive their self-renewal
and tumor initiation33–35. Finally, Pin1 has a critical role in viral,
bacterial, and parasitic infections and their related malig-
nancies36. Notably, Pin1−/− mice display no obvious defects
over half lifespan7,37. Thus, targeting Pin1 represents a novel
non-toxic strategy to simultaneously block multiple cancer-
driving pathways and also eliminate TICs7,25. However, Pin1
inhibitors identified previously lacked the specificity, potency,
and/or cell permeability38.
Our recent mechanism-based drug screens have identified
ATRA as a Pin1 inhibitor24. ATRA binds, inhibits, and induces
Pin1 degradation, thereby destabilizing its substrate PML-RARα
and treating APL in cell and animal models and human
patients24. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation also exerts antitumor
activity against breast cancer by blocking multiple oncogenic
pathways. The ability of ATRA to inhibit Pin1 function has been
confirmed in breast cancer24,39 and liver cancer24,40,41 even using
a different ATRA controlled release formulation42, and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML)43, as well as in lupus44 and asthma45.
However, regular ATRA formulation has a half-life of only 45
min in humans46 and biodegrabable longer half-life of ATRA
formulations that might be used in humans are under develop-
ment42. Thus, more effective and clinically usable Pin1 inhibitors
are urgently needed.
In this manuscript, we report the surprising findings that ATO
inhibits and induces Pin1 degradation and suppresses cancer cell
growth via noncovalently binding to the Pin1 active site, as cor-
raborated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and co-crystal
structure. ATO, at clinically relevant and safe doses, ablates Pin1
to inactivate multiple oncoproteins and activate many tumor
suppressors and global microRNAs, as well as inhibit triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor growth. Disrupting the
ability of Pin1 to bind to ATO results in ATO resistance in vitro
and in vivo. Moreover, the anticancer effects of ATO are potently
amplified by co-treatment with ATRA, which induces aquaporin-
9 (AQP9) to increase cellular ATO uptake, in addition to
directly inhibiting and degrading Pin1. Consequently, ATO and
ATRA work cooperatively to ablate Pin1, thereby blocking mul-
tiple oncogenic pathways and eliminating TICs and their drug
resistance in TNBC in human cells and in animal models
including patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs). This
ATO-ATRA
cooperative
phenotype
closely
resembles
Pin1
CRISPR KO, which is also substantiated by comprehensive ana-
lyses of protein and microRNA expression. Thus, Pin1 is a novel
drug target for ATO, and synergistic targeting of Pin1 by ATO
and ATRA offers an attractive approach to block multiple cancer-
driving pathways and eliminate TICs, which are the two major
sources of drug resistance in current cancer therapy.

 Results
ATO induces Pin1 degradation and inhibits cell growth. ATO,
especially in combination with ATRA, effectively cures the fatal
disease APL10–12. Since ATRA inhibits APL, AML, breast cancer,
and liver cancer by targeting Pin124,40–43, we wondered whether
ATO has any effects on Pin1. Using concentrations (0.1–2 µM)
that have widely and safely been used in APL cells47–49, we
surprisingly found that ATO dose-dependently downregulated
Pin1 protein levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
(Fig. 1a, b), human TNBC MDA-MB-231 (231) cells (Fig. 1c, d)
and many other breast cancer cells (see below). ATO had no
effects on Pin1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1e, f), and ATO-induced Pin1
degradation was rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Fig. 1g, h and Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Moreover, ATO dose-
dependently reduced Pin1’s protein half-life in MEFs and
231 cells (Fig. 1i, j and Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). Thus, ATO
induces proteasome-dependent Pin1 degradation.
To determine whether ATO inhibits Pin1 function in cells, we
examined its effects on the growth of Pin1 KO (Pin1−/−) and
wild-type (WT, Pin1+/+) MEFs, which display a differential

Fig. 1 ATO induces Pin1 degradation and inhibits cell growth at clinically relevant concentrations. a–d ATO dose-dependently reduces Pin1 in MEFs
(a, b) and 231 cells (c, d). Pin1 WT and KO MEFs or 231 cells, or Pin1 KO MEFs or 231 cells reconstituted with Pin1 were treated with different
concentrations of ATO for 3 days, followed by Pin1 immunoblot (a, d) and quantification (b, d). e, f ATO does not affect Pin1 mRNA levels in MEFs (e) and
231 cells (f). MEFs and 231 cells were treated with different concentrations of ATO for 3 days, followed by assaying Pin1 mRNA using real-time PCR
analysis. g, h ATO-induced Pin1 downregulation is rescued by proteasome inhibition in MEFs (g) and 231 cells (h). MEFs or 231 cells were treated with
different concentrations of ATO in the absence or presence of MG132, followed by Pin1 immunoblot. i, j ATO dose-dependently reduces Pin1 protein
stability in MEFs (i) and 231 cells (j). MEFs or 231 cells were treated with different concentrations of ATO in the absence or presence of cycloheximide,
followed by Pin1 immunoblot. k, l ATO dose-dependently inhibits cell growth of Pin1 WT, but not Pin1 KO MEFs and 231 cells, which can be rescued by re-
expressing Pin1. Pin1 WT and KO MEFs (k) or 231 cells (l) or Pin1 KO MEFs or 231 cells reconstituted with Pin1 were treated with different concentrations of
ATO for 3 days, followed by assaying cell growth. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. and the P values (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001) were

 response to Pin1 inhibition by ATRA24. ATO dose-dependently
inhibited Pin1 WT MEF growth, but was less effective against
Pin1 KO MEF growth, and the effect was restored by stably re-
expressing Pin1 (Fig. 1k). To confirm these results, we generated
Pin1 KO 231 cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and verified
them using DNA sequencing and protein analysis (Fig. 1c).
Again, Pin1 CRISPR KO cells were more resistant to ATO,
except when Pin1 levels were brought back to endogenous levels
using a lentiviral vector containing an altered Kozak sequence
(Fig. 1c, l)34. Thus, ATO inhibition of Pin1 contributes to its anti-
proliferative effects.

 ATO directly and noncovalently binds to and inhibits Pin1. It
has been shown that ATO exerts its cellular effects by covalently
interacting with vicinal Cys residues in its targets including PML-
RARα9,16,50,51. Pin1 has two Cys residues, Cys113 and Cys57. To
examine whether they are required for ATO to induce Pin1
degradation, we mutated them to Ala or Ser individually or in
combination, and stably expressed the Pin1 mutants in Pin1
CRISPR KO 231 cells at levels similar to endogenous Pin1
(Fig. 2a). ATO equally degraded the single and double Pin1 Cys
mutants (Fig. 2a) as WT protein (Figs. 1c, 3c), indicating that
Pin1’s Cys residues are not necessary for ATO-induced Pin1
degradation.
To examine whether ATO would affect Pin1 catalytic activity,
we used the standard chymotrypsin-coupled peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase (PPIase) assay52. ATO dose-dependently inhibited
Pin1
PPIase
activity
(Ki = 0.116 µM)
(Fig.
2b),
which
is
phosphorylation-specific, but had minimal effects on cyclophilin
(Cyp18) or FKBP12 (Fig. 2b), members of the two major non-
phosphorylation-specific
PPIase
families,
cyclophilins
and
FK506-binding proteins52. To examine whether ATO would
directly bind to Pin1 and to determine its binding affinity, we
synthesized a biotinylated arsenate compound (biotin-ATO) and
performed a binding assay using recombinant Pin1. Biotin-ATO
directly bound to Pin1 in a concentration-dependent manner
(apparent Kd = 0.238 µM) (Fig. 2c), consistent with the PPIase
results (Fig. 2b), and was dose-dependently competed by ATO
(Fig. 2d). Biotin-ATO also pulled down Pin1 from 231 cells, and
binding was competed by ATO (Fig. 2e). Thus, ATO directly
binds and inhibits Pin1 catalytic activity with an affinity of
0.1–0.2 µM.
To understand how ATO binds and inhibits Pin1 catalytic
activity, we assessed the dynamics of ATO binding to 15N-labeled
Pin1 PPIase domain using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy. Upon addition of ATO, select cross-peaks in the
1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Pin1 shifted and broadened in a dose-
dependent manner, indicating binding. The residues perturbed
upon ATO binding were located in the Pin1 active site, with
particularly significant changes observed for Leu60, Leu122,
Gly123, Met130, Gln131, and His157 (Fig. 2f, g and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2a). Notably, ATO titration did not affect the cross-peaks
for Cys57 or Cys113 (Fig. 2f, g and Supplementary Fig. 2a),
further supporting that Pin1 binding of ATO is not Cys-
mediated.
A search in the NCBI structure database showed several dozens
of arsenic–protein complexes with covalent interactions between
arsenic compounds and vicinal Cys or Cys-like cofactors or
functional groups in targets, as per the commonly known
mechanism16. A similar covalent interaction has been proposed
to mediate ATO binding to PML-RARα50,51. To explore our
unexpected noncovalent binding mode of ATO to Pin1, we co-
crystallized excess ATO with the Pin1 PPIase domain and refined
the
structure
to
1.6 Å
resolution
with
excellent
statistics
(Supplementary Table 1). We noted well-defined novel electron
density in the prolyl binding pocket of the Pin1 active site that
was trigonal in shape with significant Fo-Fc values at 4σ (Fig. 2h,
i). Although anomalous signal at 1.0438 Å was weak, isomor-
phous Fo-Fo maps calculated from ATO-soaked and Apo data
sets showed clear density for what appeared to be ATO with
central arsenic density peak >6σ. The electron density was nicely
situated within the Pin1 catalytic active site positioned within van
der Waals or hydrogen bonding distances of Leu122, Met130,
Gln131, Thr152, Ser154, and His157 (Fig. 2j and Supplementary
Fig. 2b). This model of ATO binding was consistent with the
degree of change in chemical shift for all backbone amides in Pin1
revealed by NMR analysis. Again, neither Cys57 nor C113 were
close to the ATO-binding pocket. Thus, ATO inhibits and
induces Pin1 degradation via a novel noncovalent mechanism,
distinct from the previous action modes of ATO on PML-RARα
and others16,50,51.
Disruption of Pin1 binding to ATO leads to ATO resistance.
To demonstrate the significance of the novel interaction between
Pin1 and ATO, we sought to identify a Pin1 point mutant that
would disrupt ATO binding and determine the importance of
direct ATO-Pin1 binding in vitro and in vivo. Since most of the
ATO-binding residues are also involved in binding of Pin1 to
proline residue in its substrate53, we were careful to select a
mutation that would not severely impair Pin1 enzymatic activity.
Indeed, point substitutions at T152 or H157 almost completely
inactivated Pin1 PPIase activity (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). We
did manage to generate a pair of enzymatically active Pin1 M130
mutants, albeit with slightly lower activity than the WT protein
(Supplementary Fig. 2c, d), likely caused by altered proline
binding of the substrate. The Pin1-ATO co-crystal structure
predicted that an M130V mutation would disrupt ATO binding,
whereas an M130I mutant would bind to ATO like the WT
protein (Fig. 3a). Indeed, Pin1 M130I mutant-bound biotin-ATO
with a similar affinity to the WT protein, whereas Pin1 M130V
mutant had a much reduced affinity for Biotin-ATO (Fig. 3b).
ATO dose-dependently inhibited the PPIase activity of Pin1
M130I, but not Pin1 M130V mutant (Supplementary Fig. 2e).
Thus, the M130V, but not M130I, mutation in Pin1 disrupts Pin1
binding to ATO, as predicted.
If direct binding to Pin1 is critical for ATO to target Pin1 in
TNBC, we would expect expression of the Pin1 M130V mutant in
Fig. 2 ATO directly binds to specific residues in the Pin1 active site via a previously unknown mechanism. a Cys residues in Pin1 are not required for ATO to
degrade Pin1. Pin1 KO cells stably expressing Cys single or double Pin1 Ala or Ser mutants were treated with different concentrations of ATO, followed by
Pin1 immunoblot. b ATO inhibits PPIase activity of Pin1, but not Cyp18 or FKBP12. Pin1, Cyp18, or FKBP12 was incubated with different concentrations of
ATO, followed by chymotrypsin-coupled PPIase assay. c Biotin-ATO binds to Pin1. Pin1 was incubated with biotin-ATO, followed by isolating biotin-ATO-
bound Pin1 for immunoblot (top) and plotting against ATO concentrations (bottom). d ATO binding to recombinant Pin1 can be competed by ATO. Biotin-
ATO was incubated with recombinant Pin1, followed by incubation with ATO before subjecting biotin-ATO pulldown assay and Pin1 immunoblot. e ATO

followed by Pin1 immunoblot, along with Pin1 imputs. f, g NMR analysis of ATO-Pin1 binding. Weighted average chemical shift difference Δ of 15N-Pin1
upon addition of 5× ATO was calculated as |ΔH| + (1/5)|ΔN| in p.p.m. and plotted as a function of residue number (f). Upon addition of 2.5× or 5× ATO to
Pin1, total six residues in Pin1 show significant chemical shift changes at both ATO concentrations, with two Cys that show no obvious chemical shift
changes being highlighted (g). h–j The co-crystal structure of the Pin1-ATO complex. ATO was mixed and co-crystallized with 500 µM Pin1, followed by

 Pin1 KO cells to reduce the sensitivity to ATO in vitro and
in vivo. To test this possibility, we stably expressed Pin1, Pin1
M130V, and M130I mutants in Pin1 CRISPR KO 231 cells at
endogenous levels (Fig. 3c), and then assayed their response to
ATO. Pin1 CRISPR KO cells were used to avoid the potential
effects of endogenous Pin1. As expected, cells expressing the Pin1
M130V mutant showed impaired ATO-induced Pin1 degradation
and inhibition of cell growth, whereas cells expressing the Pin1
M130I mutant behaved similarly to the WT protein (Fig. 3d–f).
To confirm these results, we orthotopically xenografted Pin1
CRISPR KO 231 cells expressing Pin1 or its mutants into mice,
and 1 week later when tumor growth was notable, the xenografted
mice was treated with ATO at 2 mg/kg 3 times/week, a standard
concentration that has widely and safely been used for treating
APL in mouse models and human patients47–49. Pin1 CRISPR
KO 231 cells failed to grow any tumors in mice (Fig. 3g–i),
consistent with the findings that Pin1 KO mice are highly
resistant to cancer development27–30. In contrast, tumors did
develop in Pin1 CRISPR KO 231 cells expressing Pin1 or its
M130I or M130V mutant, although the tumors of the Pin1
mutants were slightly smaller than WT Pin1 tumors (Fig. 3g–i),
consistent with their lower PPIase activity (Supplementary Fig. 2c,
d). Importantly, ATO treatment effectively inhibited the growth
of tumors derived from Pin1 or its M130I mutant, but not at all
from the M130V mutant (Fig. 3g–i). Moreover, ATO reduced the
levels of Pin1 and its substrate oncoproteins such as NF-κB/
p6554, β-catenin55, and Rab2A34, and increased the levels of
Pin1 substrate tumor suppressors such as Fbw756 in breast
tumors derived from xenografts expressing Pin1 or M130I
mutant, but not M130V mutant (Fig. 3j). Thus, ATO binding
to Pin1 is essential for ATO to induce Pin1 degradation, block
oncogenic pathways, and inhibit tumor growth.

Fig. 3 Disrupting ATO binding to Pin1 impairs its ability to induce Pin1 degradation and to inhibit breast cancer tumor growth. a The co-crystal structure of
ATO and Pin1 complexes suggests that the M130V, but not M130I Pin1 mutation, would prevent ATO from binding to the Pin1 active site (arrows). b Biotin-
ATO binds to the M130I, but not M130V Pin1 mutant. Pin1 and its mutants were incubated with different concentrations of biotinylated ATO, followed by
isolating biotin-ATO-bound Pin1 or its mutants using NeutrAvidin beads. ATO-bound Pin1 were detected by immunoblot and plotted against ATO
concentrations. c–f The M130V, but not M130I, Pin1 mutation impairs ATO’s ability to induce Pin1 degradation and inhibit cell growth. Pin1 CRISPR cells
stably expressing Pin1 or its M130V or M130I mutant (c) were treated with ATO, followed by assaying Pin1 levels (d, e) or cell growth (f). g–j The M130V,

and selected Pin1 substrate (j). The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. and the P values (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001) were determined by ANOVA

 ATO uptake via AQP9 regulates its ability to inhibit Pin1. To
further support ATO’s potent anticancer activity via targeting
Pin1, we examined the effects of ATO on cell growth using 10
different human breast cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of ATO and assessed for Pin1 levels
(Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3a) and cell growth (Fig. 4b).
ATO-induced Pin1 degradation was tightly and positively cor-
related with ATO-inhibited cell growth (Fig. 4c). However, ATO
sensitivity was surprisingly variable among different cell lines. To
identify the underlying mechanisms, we examined expression of
AQP9, a membrane transporter that mediates cellular uptake of
ATO known to correlate with ATO sensitivity in APL57,58.
Indeed, AQP9 was readily detected in ATO-responsive cells, but
not in ATO-resistant cells (Fig. 4f), with AQP9 expression being
inversely correlated with Pin1 level and cell growth (Fig. 4d, e).
Thus, ATO’s ability to inhibit breast cancer is positively corre-
lated with Pin1 degradation and AQP9 expression.
To demonstrate the functional significance of AQP9 expression
in determining ATO sensitivity, we stably knocked down
AQP9 in two ATO-sensitive cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and

 overexpressed AQP9 in three ATO-resistant cells (Supplementary
Fig. 3e). Two different AQP9 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
constructs effectively silenced AQP9 (Supplementary Fig. 3b),
and also abrogated the ability of ATO to induce Pin1 degradation
(Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 3c) and inhibit cell growth
(Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 3d) in both cell lines, with
shAQP9-2 being more effective. In contrast, AQP9 overexpres-
sion (Supplementary Fig. 3e) converted all three ATO-resistant
cells to become ATO-sensitive cells in terms of Pin1 degradation
(Fig. 4j and Supplementary Fig. 3f) and growth inhibition (Fig. 4k
and Supplementary Fig. 3g). These results are further supported
by
measuring
cellular
ATO
uptake
using
inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Whereas AQP9
knockdown (KD) reduced ATO uptake in ATO-sensitive cells
(Fig. 4i), and AQP9 overexpression increased ATO uptake in
ATO-resistant cells (Fig. 4l). Thus, ATO uptake via AQP9
regulates its ability to induce Pin1 degradation and inhibit cancer
cells.
ATO and ATRA cooperately inhibit Pin1 and oncogenic
pathways. To demonstrate the cooperation and translational
significance of ATO and ATRA in targeting Pin1 for treating
cancers, we chose TNBC as a model system because unlike APL,
which is basically cured by ATO and ATRA10–12, TNBC has the
worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes and no targeted
therapy is available59. Furthermore, Pin1 plays an essential
oncogenic role in breast cancer27,31,60,61, and chemical ablation of
Pin1 by ATRA exerts antitumor activity against TNBC24. Finally,
as shown in APL57,58, ATRA dose-dependently increased both
AQP9 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) and protein expression
(Fig. 4m and Supplementary Fig. 4c) in TNBC cells, likely due to
activation of the AQP9 promoter activity by ATRA, as shown by
promoter reporter and mutagenesis analyses (Supplementary
Fig. 4d). Moreover, ATRA and ATO combination increased time-
dependent ATO uptake (Fig. 4n), and cooperately ablated Pin1 in
two TNBC cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).
To independently confirm the cooperative effects of ATO and
ATRA on Pin1 levels, we established an in-cell enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify Pin1 protein levels
after drug treatments, which correlated well with the Pin1 levels
quantified using immunoblotting (Supplementary 5c–e). Impor-
tantly, the in-cell ELISA confirmed that, while either ATO or
ATRA
alone
dose-dependently
reduced
Pin1
levels,
their
combination displayed strong synergy (Supplementary Fig. 5f),
as calculated by the CalcuSyn program with the Chou–Talalay
method62. As single agents, ATO and ATRA caused dose-
dependent inhibition of cell growth in two TNBC cells, but their
combination
displayed
synergistic
effects
(Fig.
4o,
p
and
Supplementary Fig. 5g, h). To confirm the potential effects of
ATRA on ATO response, we treated two AQP9 KD TNBC cells
with either ATO, ATRA, or their combination. AQP9 KD did not
affect the ability of ATRA to induce Pin1 degradation (Fig. 4q and
Supplementary Fig. 5i) or inhibit cell growth (Fig. 4r and
Supplementary Fig. 5j), but did largely abrogate its ability to
synergize with ATO, which prevented additional Pin1 degrada-
tion (Fig. 4q and Supplementary Fig. 5i) and cell growth
inhibition (Fig. 4s and Supplementary Fig. 5k). Thus, ATO
cooperates with ATRA to promote Pin1 degradation and inhibit
cell growth by inducing AQP9 expression in TNBC.
Pin1
simultaneously
activates
and
inactivates
numerous
oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, respectively7,25, as well as
globally downregulates microRNAs in cancer cells by inhibiting
their biogenesis32. We next assessed the extent to which ATO
and/or ATRA affect protein levels of a selected subset of
Pin1 substrate oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, whose
protein stability is regulated by Pin1 in TNBC25. ATO and
ATRA alone caused the dose-dependent reduction of Pin1
protein and its substrate oncoproteins, including cyclin D161,
NF-κB/p6554, β-catenin55, Akt63, c-Jun64, c-Myc65, Rab2A34, and
caused the dose-dependent induction of Pin1 substrate tumor
suppressors such as Fbw756 and Smad2/366 in two TNBC cell
lines (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5l). Moreover, their
combination displayed cooperative effects, with the phenotypes
similar to those resulting from Pin1 KO using CRISPR (Fig. 5a
and Supplementary Fig. 5l). Thus, ATO and ATRA cooperately
ablate Pin1 to simultaneously block multiple cancer-driving
pathways.
To independently confirm the cooperative ablation of Pin1 by
ATO and ATRA in TNBC cells, we performed global analyses of
protein and microRNA expression after treating 231 cells with
ATO and/or ATRA for 3 days. Global alterations in proteins and
microRNAs in mock-treated cells were compared to the positive
control Pin1 CRISPR KO 231 cells using a tandem mass tag
(TMT9plex)-based proteomic approach67 and an NanoString
nCounter microRNA Expression Assay32, respectively. Out of the
7003 proteins quantified across all 10 samples, 3758 proteins
passed the abundance filter and were reliably quantified. Among
them, 209 were altered by 1.5-fold in abundance in Pin1 CRISPR
231 cells compared with the parental WT control cells. Although
ATO, ATRA, and Pin1 KO had some difference in overall
expression pattern, ATO and ATRA conferred similar effects at
the proteomic level, but their cooperation was obvious, with their
combination most closely resembling the Pin1 KO effect
(Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.69, P value <2.2e−16)
(Fig. 5b–d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Similarly, although
Fig. 4 ATRA cooperates with ATO to induce Pin1 degradation and inhibit cancer cell growth by increasing cellular ATO uptake via the induction of AQP9
expression. a–c Correlation between the ability of ATO to induce Pin1 degradation and to inhibit cell growth. Ten human breast cancer cells were treated

expression and the ability of ATO to degrade Pin1 and to inhibit cell growth. AQP9 expression were assayed by immunoblot (f) and their correlations with

ATO-sensitive cells. Stable AQP9 KD 231 cells generated using two unrelated shRNA vectors were treated with different concentrations of ATO for 3 days,

Mass Spec (i). j–l AQP9 OX reverses ATO resistance in ATO-resistant cells. Stable AQP9 OX MCF7 cells were treated with different concentrations of
ATO for 3 days, followed by assaying Pin1 levels (j), cell growth (k), or with 1 µM ATO for different times, followed by assaying cellular ATO concentrations
by ICP-Mass Spec (l). m–p ATRA induces AQP9 protein expression, increases ATO uptake, and cooperates with ATO in inhibiting cell growth in TNBC
cells. The 231 cells were treated with different concentrations of ATRA for 7 days, followed by AQP9 immunoblot (m) or with 1 µM ATO for different times
before subjecting to ATO concentrations by ICP-Mass Spec (n), or with different concentrations of ATO and/or ATRA for 3 days, followed by counting cell
number (o) and determining their synergy using CalcuSyn (p). q–s AQP9 KD abolishes ATRA cooperation with ATO, but does not affect ATRA sensitivity.

 ATO, ATRA, and Pin1 KO also had some different effects on
individual microRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 6b), ATO and ATRA,
especially in their combination, globally upregulated microRNA
expression, similar to Pin1 KO (Fig. 5e). Strikingly, many of the
consistently downregulated proteins across all treatments are
oncogenic, and many of the consistently upregulated proteins are
tumor suppressive (Supplementary Table 2). Global upregulation
of microRNAs in Pin1 KO or inhibited cancer cells is also
consistent with the findings that Pin1 regulates microRNA
biogenesis32,68. Thus, multiple independent analyses demonstrate
that ATO and ATRA synergistically target Pin1 to inhibit its
numerous cancer-related pathways.
ATO and ATRA cooperately inhibit Pin1 and tumor growth.
Given the striking anticancer effects of ATO and ATRA in vitro, a
critical question is whether they have any cooperative effects on
Pin1 levels, Pin1-regulated oncogenic pathways, and tumor

Fig. 5 ATO and ATRA cooperatively ablate Pin1 and inhibit multiple Pin1-regulated oncogenic pathways and tumor growth in TNBC in vitro and in vivo
including PDOXs. a ATO and ATRA cooperatively turn off many oncoproteins and on many tumor suppressors, like Pin1 KO. The 231 and 159 cells were
treated with different concentrations of ATO and/or ATRA for 72 h, followed by IB, with Pin1 KO cells as controls. b–d ATO and ATRA cooperatively
induced global protein expression like Pin1 KO. The 231 cells were treated with ATO and/or ATRA or DMSO for 72 h, followed by quantitative mass
spectrometry analyses, with Pin1 KO 231 cells as a control. Three thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight proteins passed the abundance filter (b), and 209
proteins were altered by >1.5-fold (c). The log 2 transformed ratio of treated versus control was used to generate the heatmap in GENE-E. The Spearman's
correlation matrix for the 209 altered proteins are shown and their P values are all below 2.2e−16, except P value for ATO and Pin1 KO being 3.5e−12
(d). e ATO and ATRA globally upregulates microRNA expression like Pin1 KO. MicroRNAs of ATO-treated and/or ATRA-treated 231 cells and Pin1 KO
231 cells were profiled by NanoString. Data are presented as relative to microRNA expression of DMSO-treated (Ctrl) 231 cells or vector CRISPR 231 cells
through the dot density plot. The P values were determined by Student’s t test. f–h ATO and ATRA cooperatively inhibit tumor growth in TNBC 231
orthotopic xenografts. The 231 cells were transplanted into mammary fat pads, and 1 week later, treated with ATO and/or ATRA. Tumor sizes were
measured (f) and mice were sacrificed after 6 weeks to collect tumor tissues (g) and measure their weights (h). i–n ATO and ATRA cooperatively inhibit
tumor growth in TNBC PDOXs. TNBC patient-derived tumors were transplanted, followed by treating mice with ATO and/or ATRA 2–3 weeks after
xenograft when tumors were notable (i–k) or reached about 360 mm3 (l–n). o ATRA induces AQP9 to cooperate with ATO to downregulate Pin1 and Pin1
oncogenic substrates and upregulate Pin1 tumor-suppressive substrates in human cells and PDOXs, assayed by immunoblot. The results are expressed as
mean ± SD and the P values were determined by ANOVA or Student’s t test. n = 4–5 mice

 growth of TNBC in vivo. We thus orthotopically xenografted
TNBC 231 cells into cleared mouse mammary fat pads and then
treated them with ATO, ATRA, or their combination 1 week after
xenograft when tumor growth was notable. Since regular ATRA
has a half-life of only 45 min in humans46, we used 5 mg 21-day
slow-releasing pellets21. For ATO, we used 2 mg/kg 3 times/week,
a standard concentration that has widely and safely been used for
treating APL in mouse models and human patients47–49. While
ATRA and ATO alone inhibited tumor growth, their combina-
tion displayed cooperative activity, markedly inhibiting tumor
growth (Fig. 5f–h).
To better recapitulate human TNBC tumors and their
microenvironment,
we
established
PDOX
models
for
two
different human TNBC tumors and treated them with ATO
and/or ATRA at the same doses as above. Again, ATRA and ATO
alone inhibited tumor growth, but their combination displayed

tumor
growth
was
notable
(Fig. 5i–k), or tumor volume reached 270 mm3 (Fig. 5l–n), or
even 360 mm3 (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). Notably, ATRA also
induced AQP9 expression and cooperated with ATO to induce
Pin1 degradation, destabilization of Pin1’s substrate oncopro-
teins, and stabilization of Pin1’s substrate tumor suppressors, in
both TNBC cell orthotopic and PDOX tumors (Fig. 5o and
Supplementary Fig. 6f). Thus, ATO and ATRA cooperatively
ablate Pin1 to block multiple cancer-driving pathways and inhibit
tumor growth in TNBC cell xenografts and PDOXs.
ATO and ATRA cooperatively inhibit Pin1 and TIC self-
renewal. As an independent approach to demonstrate that ATO
has anticancer activity by targeting Pin1 oncogenic function and
cooperating with ATRA, we chose to study TICs/CSCs of TNBCs,
which are a proposed source of tumor initiation, growth, and
metastasis, but are not effectively targeted by current cancer
drugs4,5. Moreover, Pin1 is highly enriched in breast TICs and
drives TIC self-renewal and tumor initiation and growth33–35, but
whether Pin1 inhibitors would effectively target TICs is not known.
To examine the effects of ATO and ATRA on TICs in TNBC, we
first treated 231 and 159 cells with ATO (1 µM), ATRA (10 µM), or
their combination, followed by assaying the breast TIC-enriched
CD24−CD44+ or ALDH+ population using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS)33,34 While ATO and ATRA both significantly
reduced
breast
TIC-enriched
population,
their
combination
cooperatively reduced the TIC population to the levels (Fig. 6a, b)
close to Pin1 CRISPR cells (Fig. 6e, f). To examine the effects of
ATO and ATRA on self-renewal of breast TICs, we treated TNBC
cells with ATO, ATRA, or their combination, followed by a serial
mammosphere formation assay. Both TNBC 231 and 159 cells
formed very fast-growing spheres that did not decrease when
propagated to M4 (Fig. 6c, d), indicating that mammosphere-
forming cells were self-renewing at a constant rate35. However, after
treatment with ATO or ATRA, the cells formed fewer and smaller
mammospheres displaying strongly impaired mammosphere for-
mation efficiency at M2–4. Moreover, their co-treatment displayed
cooperative effects, almost completely inhibiting mammosphere
formation efficiency at M1 (Fig. 6c, d), similar to Pin1 CRISPR KO
(Fig. 6g). Similar results were also obtained in TNBC MDA-MB-
468 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Moreover, ATO effectively
inhibited mammosphere formation efficiency at M1 in Pin1
CRISPR 231 cells expressing Pin1 or the M130I mutant, but not
the M130V mutant (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f), consistent with their
ATO binding (Fig. 3) Thus, Pin1 binding to ATO is required for
ATO to target TICs.
Since the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pheno-
type is another breast TIC property69, and is reversed by Pin1 KD
or KO33, we also examined the effects of ATO and/or ATRA on
EMT. ATO and ATRA, especially in combination, strongly
induced the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), as
displayed by upregulation of epithelial markers, such as E-
cadherin (Fig. 6h–j), and downregulation of mesenchymal
markers, such as slug, vimentin, and ZEB-1 (Fig. 6i–j), as well
as reduced cell migration and invasion equivalent to Pin1 KO
using CRISPR (Fig. 6k, l and Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Thus,
ATO and ATRA cooperatively reduce the population, self-
renewal, and EMT of TICs in TNBC, similar to Pin1 KO.
ATO and ATRA cooperatively inhibit Pin1 and TIC tumor
growth. Breast TICs are notoriously resistant to cytotoxic che-
motherapy drugs such as taxol4,5, commonly used to treat
TNBC70. Since ablation of Pin1 by ATO and ATRA eliminates
breast TICs, we expected that taxol-resistant TNBC cells would
still be sensitive to ATO and ATRA co-treatment. To test this, we
generated taxol-resistant 231 and 159 cells (Fig. 7a), followed by
drug treatments. Compared with parental cells, taxol-resistant
231 and 159 cells had increased population of TICs (Fig. 7b),
elevated levels of multiple CSC regulators (Fig. 7c), and increased
migration
and
invasion
(Supplementary
Fig.
8a–d),
as
expected4,5. Importantly, these TIC-related phenotypes were
drastically inhibited by ATO and ATRA, and particularly their
combination (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Fig. 8a–d). Moreover,
ATO and ATRA, especially in their combination, potently
inhibited the growth of taxol-resistant cells (Fig. 7d), and also
effectively inhibited self-renewal of taxol-resistant breast TICs
(Fig. 7e and Supplementary Fig. 8e). Thus, ATO and ATRA
combination eliminates resistance of TICs to taxol.
This
raises
the question
of whether
ATO
and ATRA
combination would inhibit tumor initiation and growth of breast
TICs in vivo. We assayed the effects of ATO and ATRA
combination therapy on tumor initiation of TNBCs using a
limiting dilution assay in mice, a standard approach to determine
tumor initiation71. Importantly, ATO and ATRA co-treatment
not only effectively reduced breast TIC frequency by ~90-fold
(P < 0.0001), but also dramatically reduced tumor growth (Fig. 7f
and Table 1), similar to Pin1 KO (Fig. 7g and Table 1). Moreover,
ATO and ATRA co-treatment potently downregulated multiple
CSC regulators in tumors (Fig. 7h), like Pin1 KO (Fig. 7i). Finally,
ATO and ATRA co-treatment also cooperatively reduced breast
TIC-enriched population (Fig. 7j) and multiple CSC regulators
(Fig. 7k) in PDOX tumors. Thus, ATO and ATRA cooperatively
ablate Pin1 to inhibit the self-renewal, drug resistance, tumor
initiation, and growth of TICs in TNBC, similar to Pin1 KO.
Discussion
ATO is approved by the FDA exclusively for the treatment of
APL because it is the only leukemia that expresses the ATO
presumed target PML-RARα. We have now discovered that, at
clinically relevant and safe concentrations, ATO directly and
noncovalently binds, inhibits, and induces degradation of Pin1, a
major common regulator of cancer signaling networks, thereby
inhibiting TNBC, and that these anticancer effects are abolished

mammosphere formation assay, followed by calculating the average area of all mammospheres formed (e). f–i ATO and ATRA cooperatively reduce
tumor initiation and growth, and CSC regulators of TNBC cells in mice similar to Pin1 KO using CRISPR. TNBC cells were treated with ATO (1 µM) and
ATRA (10 µM) for 3 days, followed by being injected into subcutaneous sites of nude mice in limiting dilutions and treated with ATO (2 mg/kg, i.p., 3
times/week) and ATRA (5 mg in 21-day slow release) (f, h). Pin1 CRISPR and vector control 231 cells were used in parallel as a control (g, i). Mice were
sacrificed and evaluated for tumor weight (f, g), and expression of selected CSC regulators (h). Pin1 CRISPR cells were analyzed for CSC regulators by
immunoblot (i). j, k ATO and ATRA cooperatively reduce TIC population and CSC regulators in PDOXs. TNBC patient-derived tumors were transplanted

 by disrupting ATO’s binding to Pin1. ATRA, another Pin1
inhibitor, increases cellular uptake of ATO by inducing the ATO
transporter AQP9. Used together, ATO and ATRA cooperatively
ablate Pin1, thereby blocking numerous cancer-driving pathways
and inhibiting TICs and tumor growth of TNBC, similar to Pin1
KO in human cells and in orthotopic tumor models, including
PDOX. ATO and ATRA combination not only potentiates their
anticancer efficacies, but also reduces drug toxicity, which is
especially important given ATO’s well-known toxicity at high
doses. Thus, cooperative Pin1 inhibition by ATO and ATRA
potently blocks numerous oncogenic pathways and eliminates
TICs, offering a promising non-toxic approach to fighting TNBC
and likely many other cancers.
A central signaling mechanism in oncogenesis is pSer/Thr-
Pro7,26. Many oncoproteins and tumor suppressors are directly
regulated by Pro-directed phosphorylation and/or trigger signaling
pathways involving such phosphorylation7,26. Proline in a protein
can exist either in the cis or trans conformation, and cis–trans
conversion encounters a sufficiently high energy barrier that effi-
cient isomerization requires catalysis by PPIases72. Pin1 is the only
known PPIase specific to pSer/Thr-Pro motifs, which is critical as
phosphorylation increases the isomerization energy barrier52,72.
Pin1-catalyzed cis–trans isomerization can profoundly impact
protein structure and function, as confirmed by cis-specific and
trans-specific antibodies73,74. Since kinases, phosphatases, and
proteases are trans-specific or cis-specific7, pSer/Thr-Pro motifs
create a powerful logic gate dependent upon Pin1 for the maximal
activity. Pin1 serves as a unified hub that is exploited in cancer to
simultaneously turn oncoproteins on and turn tumor suppressors
off7. Indeed, Pin1 is a master post-phosphorylation regulator of
oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and global microRNAs7,25,32.
ATRA binds, inhibits, and induces Pin1 degradation, thereby
exerting anticancer activity against APL, AML, and breast and liver
cancer by blocking multiple cancer pathways24,40–43. Slow-releasing
ATRA formulations can be used in animal studies24,40–42, but not
in humans. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a longer half-
life ATRA formulation or Pin1-targeted ATRA derivatives, or to
identify clinically usable Pin1 inhibitors.
We have now made the unexpected discovery that ATO targets
Pin1 and cooperates with ATRA to exert potent anticancer
activity. Alone, ATO dose-dependently induced proteasome-
dependent Pin1 degradation and inhibited cancer cell growth.
Pin1 KO cells were more resistant to ATO, which was rescued by
re-expressing Pin1. Thus, Pin1 inhibition contributes to ATO’s
anticancer effects. ATO directly bound and inhibited Pin1 PPIase
activity with an affinity of 0.1–0.2 µM, without affecting other
PPIases. Importantly, ATO interacted with Pin1 active site resi-
dues, but not Cys residues, though covalent interactions with Cys
have previously been proposed as the mechanism action of ATO
on its targets including PML-RARα50,51. Furthermore, mutations
of Pin1’s Cys residues had no effect on ATO binding to Pin1,
whereas replacing the ATO-binding residue Met130 with Val, but
not Ile, impaired ATO’s ability to bind and degrade Pin1, inhibit
multiple oncogenic pathways, and inhibit TNBC cell and TIC
growth in vitro and in vivo, as predicted from their co-crystal
structure. Thus, noncovalent ATO binding to Pin1 is required for
its ability to induce Pin1 degradation, block numerous oncogenic
pathways, and inhibit TICs (Fig. 8).
The role of Pin1 in mediating ATO’s anticancer activity is
further supported by the findings that human breast cancer cells
were differentially susceptible to ATO and highly correlated with
the rate of ATO-induced Pin1 degradation and with the expres-
sion of the ATO transporter AQP9. Importantly, AQP9 KD
reduced ATO uptake and sensitivity in inducing Pin1 degradation
and cell growth inhibition in ATO-sensitive cells, whereas AQP9
overexpression increased ATO uptake and reversed ATO resis-
tance. These surprising findings led us to probe the role of ATRA,
which increases AQP9 expression and enhances ATO sensitivity
in APL57,58. Indeed, ATRA activated AQP9 promoter, increased
AQP9 mRNA and protein expression, as well as enhanced ATO
uptake, suggesting that ATRA may cooperate with ATO to
enhance their anticancer activity. Indeed, ATO and ATRA
together displayed cooperative effects leading to potent ablation
of Pin1, inhibition of multiple oncogenic pathways, and inhibi-
tion of cell and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The synergistic
effects were largely abrogated by AQP9 KD, which did not affect
the ability of ATRA to reduce Pin1 and inhibit cell growth in
TNBC cells. Moreover, ATO and ATRA co-treatment more
potently inhibited the self-renewal, chemoresistance, and tumor
initiation and growth of TICs in TNBC in vitro and in vivo. ATO
and ATRA also cooperatively ablates multiple Pin1-regulated
CSC regulators even in PDOXs. Significantly, these phenotypes of
ATO and ATRA cooperation are similar to those resulting from
Pin1 KO using CRISPR, which is also substantiated by compre-
hensive analyses of protein and microRNA expression. Notably,
the cooperative ability of ATO and ATRA to eliminate TICs in

 TNBC by targeting Pin1 is consistent with the previous findings
that genetic or chemical inhibition of Pin1 induces PML/RARα
degradation to eradicate leukemia stem cells and treat APL
without inducing myeloid differentiation20,21,24. Thus, ATRA
cooperates with ATO to ablate Pin1 and enhance anticancer
activity directly and acting indirectly on Pin1 to increase ATO
uptake through AQP9 (Fig. 8). Although ATO and ATRA each
have other anticancer mechanisms16,50,51, their cooperative Pin1
inhibition likely plays a major role in mediating their ability to
block multiple cancer-driving pathways and eliminate TICs in
TNBC, two major sources of drug resistance in current cancer
therapy (Fig. 8).
We show that ATO directly and noncovalently binds to the
common cancer signaling regulator Pin1 to block multiple cancer-
driving pathways and eliminate CSCs in TNBC. These results are
consistent with the previous findings that ATO shows efficacy
against various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors9,13,
given prevalent Pin1 overexpression in human cancers6,7,25. They
are also consistent with the recent epidemiological findings that
exposure to ATO-contaminated drinking water dramatically redu-
ces overall breast cancer mortality in the affected population15.
Moreover, we have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the
striking cooperation between ATO and ATRA that gives rise to
their potent anticancer effects (Fig. 8). This unique drug combi-
nation not only potently increases the efficacy of ATO, but also
effectively reduces its notoriously high toxicity9,16. Notably, Pin1
KO in mice has no obvious defects for an extended period of
time7,37, but prevents cancer development by overexpression of
various oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors27–30. Thus, ablation
of Pin1 by ATO, especially when combined with longer half-life
ATRA, along with AQP9 expression as a potential marker for ATO
sensitivity, offers an exciting new non-toxic approach to overcome
cancer drug resistance in solid tumors, as demonstrated by its safety
and efficacy against APL.
In summary, our results not only reveal a novel anticancer
mechanism for ATO, but also provide the first evidence that
ATO, particularly in combination with ATRA, blocks multiple
cancer-driving pathways and eliminates TICs in TNBC by tar-
geting Pin1. This offers a promising, low-toxicity option for
treating a broad range of cancers.
Methods
Cell culture and reagents. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Cell
Collection (ATCC, USA). The 293T, BT549, HCC1937, HCC1806, MCF7, MDA-
MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, and T47D cells (originally obtained from ATCC
and maintained in the Lu laboratory) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Hs578t, NB4,
and HL60 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI)
with 10% FBS. SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium with 5% FBS,
insulin (5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml). All the cells used for the experi-
ments were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using 4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) staining. ATO, ATRA, MG132, and cycloheximide were
purchased from Sigma and ATRA-releasing pellets were from Innovative Research
of America. N15-NH4Cl was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.
BME vitamins were purchased form MP Biomedicals. All Pin1 mutations,
including C57A−, C57S−, C113A−, C113S−, C57AC113A−, C57SC113S−,

Supplementary Figures 9–12.
Establishment of PIN1 KO cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Pin1
guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using the online CRISPR design tool (http://
CRISPR.mit.edu/). The gRNA sequences were as described in Table 275.
The pLentiCRISPR construction was performed according to the protocol
provided by the Zhang Lab (http://genome-engineering.org/gecko/). Oligos, (F)—
5′-CACCC-gRNA and (R) AAAC-gRNA-C, were cloned into the gRNA Cloning
Vector (Addgene, plasmid #49536). To obtain single clones of Pin1 KO cells, cells
were transfected with the pLentiCRISPR plasmid containing each target gRNA
sequence or empty vector, selected with puromycin for 3 days and isolated by
colony formation assay. The single clones were validated by immunoblotting
analysis and DNA sequencing.
Inhibition of cell proliferation. Breast cancer cells were seeded at a density of
3000 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottomed plates and incubated for 72 h in culture
medium. Cells were then treated with ATO, ATRA, or their combination. Control
cells received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration equal to that of drug-
treated cells. At 72 h, cells were counted after trypsin digestion, or medium con-
taining 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bro-
mide was added to each well for a 2 h incubation at 37 °C, followed by removing
the media before adding 200 μl DMSO. Absorbance was determined at 570 nm.
Leukemia cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well in 96-well flat-
bottomed plates, and incubated for 72 h in the culture medium. The number of
cells was determined by CellTiter-Glo® 2.0 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Generation of stable cell lines. To establish stable cell lines, cells were infected by
lentivirus. For overexpression, Pin1 and Pin1 mutants were subcloned into a len-
tiviral vector with less optimal Kozak sequences, as described33,34. All shRNA
constructs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The target sequences of
AQP9 shRNAs are GCGAACGCATTTGCAGATCAA and GCTGTGTCTTTAG
CAATGTGT. To overexpress AQP9 in cells, human AQP9 cDNA was subcoloned
from pEGFP-AQP9 (Plasmid #48808, Addgene) into a lentiviral vector. The
293FT cells were co-transfected with the package, envelop, and various lentivirus-
expressing constructs. The virus-containing supernatant was harvested and filtered
by 0.45 μm filter. For infection, the viral stock was supplemented with 8 mg/ml of
polybrene.
Intracellular arsenic concentration analysis. MDA-MB-231 treated with ATRA
(10 μM), AQP9 knocked down MDA-MB-231, and AQP9 overexpressed MCF7
cells were treated with ATO (1 μM) for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Cells were collected by
Cell Lifter (Corning, NY, USA) and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) twice. Cell pellets were lysed in 0.9 ml double-distilled water by
sonication for 10 min. Nitric acid was added to a final concentration of 10% to be
used as an internal standard. After centrifuging at 3000 × g for 10 min, the
supernatants were analyzed with ICP-MS as previously reported58.
Evaluation of combined effects of ATO and ATRA. To evaluate the combined
effect of ATO and ATRA, data were analyzed by the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK), using the Chou–Talalay method62. The combination index (CI) is
calculated by the formula: CI = [D]1/[Dx]1 + [D]2/[Dx]2. [D]1 and [D]2 are the
concentrations of drug 1 and drug 2 to show a certain effect when treated with two
drugs together. [Dx]1 and [Dx]2 are the concentrations that show the same effect
with a combination of drug 1 and drug 2 when treated with each drug alone. CI
values <1 indicate synergy/cooperation, whereas values >1 indicate antagonism.
Synergism can be defined as follows: CI <0.1 indicate very strong synergism;
0.1–0.3 indicate strong synergism; 0.3–0.7 indicate synergism; 0.7–0.85 indicate
moderate synergism; 0.85–0.90 indicate slight synergism; 0.9–1.1 indicate nearly
additive effect.
Protein stability assay. For Pin1 stability assays, cells were treated with ATO for
24 h and followed the treatment with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) up to 36 h without
ATO to block new protein synthesis, as described24. When cells were treated with
ATO and MG132, we treated the cells with ATO for first 48 h and for following last
12 h treated them with MG132 (10 μM for MEF, 1 μM for MDA-MD-231), as
described24. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and cell lysates were
analyzed by immunoblotting.
Immunoblotting analysis. Culture cells and in vivo tumor samples were lysed in
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP40,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 50 mM NaF) con-
taining proteinase inhibitors and then mixed with the SDS sample buffer and

 loaded onto a gel after boiling. The proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane. The transblotted membrane
was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST).
After blocking with TBST containing 5% milk for 1 h, the membrane was incubated
with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted 1:1000) in 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA)-containing TBST (Fbw7 in 5% milk) at 4 °C overnight. After
incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed three times with
TBST for a total of 30 min followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:5000) for 1 h at room
temperature. After three extensive washes with TBST for a total of 30 min, the
immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoblotting
results were quantified using ImageJ from NIH24.
PPIase assay. The PPIase activity on GST-Pin1, GST-FKBP12, or GST-cyclophilin
in response to ATO were determined using the chymotrypsin-coupled PPIase
activity assay with the substrate Suc-Ala-pSer-Pro-Phe-pNA, Suc-Ala-Glu-Pro-
Phe-pNA, or Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (50 mM) in buffer containing 35 mM
HEPES (pH 7.8) and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 10 °C as described52, with the exception
that the compounds were preincubated with enzymes for 12 h at 4 °C. Ki value
obtained from PPIase assay is derived from Cheng–Prusoff equation [Ki = IC50/
(1 + S/Km)], where Km is the Michaelis constant for the used substrate, S is the
initial concentration of the substrate in the assay, and the IC50 value of the
inhibitor, as described24.
Co-crystallization, data collection, and structure determination. A near twofold
excess of ATO (from a 100 mM stock) was mixed with 500 µM protein and crys-
tallized by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C in the following crystallization buffer:
2 M NH4 citrate, pH 6.5. Crystals were transferred briefly into crystallization buffer
containing 25% glycerol prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data
from complex crystals were collected at beamline 24ID of the NE-CAT at the
Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). Data sets were integrated
and scaled using XDS76. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using the
program Phaser77. The ligand was positioned manually and refined using Buster and
Rhofit. Iterative manual model building and refinement using Phenix and Coot led to
a model with excellent statistics (Supplementary Table 1). The ATO-Pin1 co-crystal
structure is being deposited into the NCBI Database (PDB ID is 6DUN).
NMR analysis. Uniformly 15N-labeled PIN1 catalytic domain covering residues
51–163 (77KQ, 82KQ) was prepared at 100 μM in 50 mM sodium phosphate/100
mM sodium sulfate pH 6.6 buffer which contained 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithio-
threitol, and 10% D2O; ATO was added to 0×, 1×, 2.5×, or 5× final concentration
relative to protein. Standard methods were used to acquire 1H-15N HSQC spectra
at 25 °C on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a BBO probe,
using 2048 (1H) x 256 points (15N) and 32 scans per increment (total time
approximately 3 h per experiment), linear-predicted 1× in the indirect dimension,
and zero-filled to a final 2048 × 1024 dataset. Data were processed in Topspin
(Bruker) and analyzed using CcpNmr analysis78. The weighted average chemical
shift difference was calculated as Δ ¼

is the change in p.p.m. of 1H or 15N for the indicated crosspeak. The significance
threshold for the chemical shift changes was calculated based on the average
chemical shift across all residues plus the standard deviation, in accordance with
standard methods79.
Nanostring microRNA profiling. After 3 days’ treatments with DMSO, ATO, and/
or ATRA, cell pellets were collected, along with Pin1 CRISPR KO cells, followed by
isolating total RNA using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instruction, as described32. Expression profiling of global micro-
RNAs in these samples was determined by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular
Biology Core Facilities using NanoString nCounter microRNA Expression Assays,
followed by data analysis using the NanoString nCounter software32. Dot plots
were created using GraphPad PRISM7.0a (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). The
NanoString data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and are
accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE116264.
Quantitative protein analysis using multiplex quantitative proteomic analysis.
After 3 days’ treatments with DMSO, ATO and/or ATRA, cell pellets were col-
lected, along with Pin1 CRISPR KO cells. Expression profiling of global proteins in
these samples was determined by the Thermo Fisher Scientific Center at Harvard
Medical School for Multiplexed Proteomics (TCMP@HMS), using a tandem mass
tag-based approach, as described67. Each protein was normalized to the summed
amount of quantified proteins within the sample, and changes of the relative
proteins abundance were computed by normalizing each treatment to the
untreated control. Proteins with <0.01% abundance were filtered out given their
high variance. A second threshold of 1.5-fold change was chosen to focus on the
proteins with largest alterations, as previously described67. Heatmaps showing
relative protein abundance changes were generated using GENE-E (3.0.215).
Correlation plots and correlation matrix heatmap were created by customized R
script using reshape2, LSD, and ggplot2 packages. The RAW format data have been
deposited in the ProteomeXchange via the PRIDE partner repository, with dataset
identifier PXD010224. The identified proteins and peptides are included in Sup-
plementary Data 1. Both unnormalized and processed data are included.
ATO doses. The doses used for ATO in our in vitro and in vivo studies have been
widely used for previous studies on APL cells and APL mice47–49. These doses are
clinically relevant and safe in treating APL patients. The current dosing recom-
mendation for ATO in APL patients is 0.15 mg/kg per day. According to the FDA
guidelines, to convert mouse dose in mg/kg to human equivalent doses in mg/kg,
either divide mouse dose by 12.3 or multiply mouse dose by 0.0880. Therefore, we
treated mice with 2 mg/kg/ intraperitoneally (i.p.), 3 times/week. From a phase 1
trial and pharmacokinetic study of ATO in children and adolescences, at 0.15 mg/
kg per day, the median (range) plasma arsenic maximum concentration (Cmax) is
0.28 μM (0.11–0.37 μM); area under the plasma concentration time curve
(AUC0–24) is 2.5 μM-h (1.28–3.85 μM-h)81. According to this study, we treated cells
with a range from 0.125 to 2 μM ATO. In this range, the max dose is closed to the
average of AUC0–24.
Flow cytometric analysis. To assess cell surface expression of CD44 and CD24,
cells were washed with PBS, harvested by non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution,
and resuspended in blocking solution (Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS containing 1% fetal
calf serum (FCS)). Cells were then incubated with antibodies for 20 min at 4 °C,
washed with PBS, and labeled with secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells
were washed and analyzed on a BD LSRII cytometer. To assess high ALDH activity,
it was performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (STEMCELL Tech-
nologies). CSC populations were identified as CD44hi/CD24− in MDA-MB-231
and MA-MB-468 cells and as ALDH+ in SUM159 cells.
Mammosphere formation. Single-cell suspensions were plated on ultra-low
attachment plates (Corning), at a density of 500 cells per well in 3:1 serum-free
DMEM/MammoCult medium (STEMCELL Technologies) with 0.8% methylcel-
lulose (Sigma). After 8–10 days in culture, mammospheres were collected by
centrifugation and dissociated enzymatically (5 min in 1:1 TrypLE/DMEM at 37°C)
and mechanically by passing through 26 G needles. Single cells were counted and
replated at a density of 500 cells per well for subsequent passages. We took entire
images of mammosphere-culturing wells and then calculated the total area and
number of all mammospheres formed using ImageJ, followed by calculating the
average area of all mammospheres as described82.
Cell migration and invasion. For migration assay, the underside of Transwell
(Millipore) polycarbonate membrane was coated with fibronectin. Cells resus-
pended in 10% FCS medium were plated onto the upper chamber, and the medium
containing 20% FCS was added to the lower chamber. Cells were incubated at 37 °C
for several hours. At the endpoint of incubation, cells that had migrated to the
lower membrane surface were fixed by 4% formaldehyde and stained with DAPI
for counting. For invasion assay, the Transwell membrane was coated with Geltrex
(Invitrogen).
Animal studies. For xenograft experiments, 5 × 105 of MDA-MB-231 cells or Pin1
CRISPR 231 cells stably re-expressing Pin1 or its mutants were injected orthoto-
pically into the cleared mammary fat pads of 8-week-old NOD.Cg-
prkdcscidll2rgtm1Wjl/Szj (termed NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratories). One week later,
tumor growth was just about notable by sight, mice were randomly selected to
receive treatments with ATO (2 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times/week, Sigma) and/or sub-
cutaneous implantation of 5 mg 21-day ATRA-releasing pellets (Innovative
Research of America) or placebo. For limiting dilution xenograft experiments, cells
were treated with ATO (1 µM) and ATRA (10 µM) for 3 days and injected sub-
cutaneously into flank of 8-week-old BALB/c nude mice (Jackson Laboratories)
and continuously treated with ATO (2 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times/week) and 5 mg 21 day
ATRA-releasing pellets. Two patient-derived models of human breast cancer
(model ID: TM00089 and TM00096) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.
Tumors were diced to 4 × 2 × 1 mm3 sized fragments and implanted into the
mammary fat pads of NSG mice as previously reported83. When PDX tumors
reached to the size as described in the text, mice were randomly selected to receive
treatments. Tumor sizes were measured by a caliper and tumor volumes were
calculated using the formula L x W2 × 0.52, where L and W represent length and
width, respectively. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC of the
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.
Statistical analysis. Experiments were routinely repeated at least three times, and
the repeat number was increased according to effect size or sample variation. We
estimated the sample size considering the variation and mean of the samples. No
statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No animals or samples
were excluded from any analysis. Animals were randomly assigned groups for
in vivo studies; no formal randomization method was applied when assigning
animals for treatment. Group allocation and outcome assessment was not done in a
blinded manner, including for animal studies. Limiting dilution data were analyzed
by the single-hit Poisson model using a complementary log–log generalized linear
