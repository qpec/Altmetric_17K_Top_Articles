A systematic comparison of sugar content in low-fat vs regular
versions of food
PK Nguyen1,2, S Lin2 and P Heidenreich1,2
Obesity remains a significant public health concern. One of the primary messages from providers and health-care organizations is
to eat healthier foods with lower fat. Many in the lay press, however, have suggested that lower fat versions of foods contain more
sugar. To our knowledge, a systematic comparison of the sugar content in food with lower fat alternatives has not been performed.
In this study, we compared fat free, low fat and regular versions of the same foods using data collected from the USDA National
Nutrient Database. We found that the amount of sugar is higher in the low fat (that is, reduced calorie, light, low fat) and non-fat
than ‘regular’ versions of tested items (Friedman P = 0.00001, Wilcoxon P = 0.0002 for low fat vs regular food and P = 0.0003 for
non-fat vs regular food). Our data support the general belief that food that is lower in fat may contain more sugar.

BACKGROUND
Obesity remains a significant public health concern in the United
States (US). Conventional thinking suggests that obesity is caused
by an imbalance between calories consumed and calories
expended; thus, any excess of calories will result in obesity. The
solution is simple in theory: eat less and exercise more. Despite
numerous recommendations on how to achieve this goal, a third
of adults and 17% of children are obese.1 Perhaps it is not only
how much we are eating, but also what we are eating that may be
encouraging our bodies to store fat.
The impetus for creating low-fat foods can be traced to the
McGovern Committee, which issued a report in 1977 recommend-
ing that Americans eat less fat and more complex carbohydrates
to
prevent
diabetes,
heart
disease
and
stroke.
Over
the
subsequent decades, several health advocacy groups have echoed
these same recommendations, giving rise to America’s current
aversion to fatty foods. However, the food industry may have
replaced fat with sugar, which may be more obesogenic even if
the calories per portion are less.2,3 The purpose of this study is to
determine whether these ‘healthier’ versions of common foods
have more sugar than their ‘regular’ counterparts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We evaluated the nutrient value of the list of foods recommended
by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute on a website
entitled ‘Low-calorie, lower fat alternative foods’ (http://www.
nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/eat/shop_lcal_fat.htm).
The site lists high-calorie/high-fat foods that have low-calorie,
non-fat alternatives. We compared the nutritional content of the
same foods listed on the USDA National Nutrient Database for
Standard Reference released in 2004 (SR17)4 and 2014 (SR27).5
SR17 was chosen as the initial data set for comparison because it
is
the
earliest
version
with
the
most
complete
nutrient
information. This database lists the nutritional content of over
8000 generic and brand name food products and is the major
source of food composition data in the US. The database includes
information on the mean nutrient values per 100 g of the edible
portion of food including the amount of protein, fat and
carbohydrates. Continuous variables were represented as medians
with interquartile range. Differences among and between food
groups were analyzed using the Friedman test, followed by post
hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively. Statistical analysis was

Low-fat vs regular versions of food

 performed using STATA, version 12.1 (STATA, College Station,
TX, USA). Significance level was set at Po0.05.
RESULTS
On the basis of the information collected by the USDA, we found
that the amount of sugar is higher in the low-fat (that is, reduced
calorie, light, low fat) and non-fat than regular versions of tested
items (Friedman P = 0.00001, Wilcoxon P = 0.0002 for low-fat vs
regular food and P = 0.0003 for non-fat vs regular food). Subgroup
analysis revealed that sugar content was higher in lower calorie
versions of the following food categories: (i) dairy products,
(ii) baked goods, (iii) meats, fish and poultry, and (iv) fats, oils and
salad dressings (Figure 1 and Table 1). Results did not significantly
differ between 2004 and 2014 (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Findings from this study suggest that consuming foods lower in
fat have higher sugar content despite having lower calories.
Although the increase in added sugar per serving appears to be
small, the cumulative effect of consuming ‘empty calories’ over
several years could have important health consequences.
Consuming excess sugar even in small amounts (⩾10% of total
calories) has been shown to be harmful, leading to weight gain,
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.2,3 The major sources of
added sugar in the diet include the obvious culprits like sugar-
sweetened beverages, desserts, fruit drinks and candy.2,3 Ironically,
individuals who believe they are choosing healthier versions of
their favorite foods are trading fat for less healthy sugar. Although
exchanging sugar for fat alone may not increase rates of obesity as
shown in a recent systematic review,6 eating food high in sugar
may promote consumption of excess calories by inducing leptin
resistance and increasing the risk of obesity.7
