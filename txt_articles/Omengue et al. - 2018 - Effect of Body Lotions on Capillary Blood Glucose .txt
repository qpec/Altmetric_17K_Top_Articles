he reliability of capillary blood glucose measurements is tremendously important for patients’ care and follow-up. Some factors 
independent of glucose control could however affect readings during ambulatory monitoring of capillary glucose levels in patients 
with diabetes mellitus. We sought to evaluate the impact of three body lotions commonly used in Cameroon on different strata of 
glycaemia. We explored their influence over time on measured capillary glucose values. We enrolled 16 participants. Eligible individuals 
were adult patients with diabetes (n=12) stratified into three levels of capillary glucose values (100 ± 40 mg/dL [5.55 ± 2.22 mmol/L], 
 
200 ± 40 mg/dL [11.1 ± 2.22 mmol/L] and 300 ± 40 mg/dL [16.65 ± 2.22 mmol/L]) and normoglycaemic individuals (n=4). We measured 
capillary blood glucose before application, immediately after, then 5, 30 and 60 minutes after application of sweet almond oil, corticosteroid 
cream and hydroquinone lotion. The measurements made on impregnated body lotion-permeated fingers were compared to that of a clean 
finger. We observed a significant increase (delta [95% confidence interval, CI]: 119.5% [77.4–222.1]) of capillary glucose level immediately 
after administration of hydroquinone-containing body lotion (p<0.001). Capillary glucose values after the use of corticoid cream and sweet 
almond oil was stable 5, 30 and 60 minutes after application (p=0.875 and p=0.883 respectively). In the case of the hydroquinone-containing 
body lotion, there was a significant difference between capillary glucose level at 5 minutes (delta [95%CI]: 81.6% [55.3–214.2]; p<0.001), 
30 minutes (delta [95%CI]: 71.6% [21.8–134.6]; p<0.001) and 60 minutes (delta [95%CI]: 58.3% [2.8–133.3]; p=0.013) after application compared 
to the value obtained from the clean finger. We observed from our study that there were significant variations in capillary blood glucose 
measurements induced by the use of hydroquinone lotion.

Diabetes mellitus is a major global health problem owing to its increasing 
prevalence, morbidity and mortality. Blood glucose control is paramount 
in patients with diabetes to optimise treatment and therefore delay the 
onset of acute and chronic complications and subsequent death. Capillary 
blood glucose measurement is the commonly used method to reflect 
daily glycaemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus.1 It is a useful 
and relatively accessible tool to evaluate and adapt therapy with the 
aim to achieve optimal glycaemic control.2 In patients under continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections, 
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) increases patients’ awareness 
of hypoglycaemia and provides strategies to improve prevention of both 
hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic events.3,4 However, the accuracy of 
point-of-care devices in the evaluation of capillary glucose values can be 
impacted by a number of factors, including the characteristics of the device 
and the skills of the involved patients with diabetes.5 Other factors, such as 
blood sample, strips, devices, environmental parameters (altitude and/or 
temperature) and patient behaviours, are linked to SMBG and may impact 
yield of capillary glucose readings.6,7 Self-monitoring of blood glucose often 
has significant errors that are poorly understood by patients and health 
care providers, particularly the effect of some substances such as sugary 
fruits8 and body lotions.9
We hypothesised that the use of body lotion could significantly influence 
the results of capillary glycaemia. We therefore sought to evaluate the 
impact of three body lotions commonly used in Cameroon on different

strata of glycaemia and we explored their influence over time on 
measured capillary glucose values.
Methods
Study design and setting
Study population
We enrolled 16 participants attending the National Obesity Centre, 
Yaoundé Central Hospital, Cameroon. Eligible participants were 
adult patients with diabetes (n=12) spanning three strata of capillary 
glucose values (100 ± 40 mg/dL [5.55 ± 2.22 mmol/L], 200 ± 40 mg/dL 
 
[11.1 ± 2.22 mmol/L] and 300 ± 40 mg/dL [16.65 ± 2.22 mmol/L]) and 
a control group (n=4) of healthy normoglycaemic individuals (without 
diabetes). Individuals with long-term glucocorticoid use, patients 
with severe hyperglycaemia (hyperosmolar state, isolated ketosis or 
ketoacidosis), hypoglycaemia and/or coagulopathy were excluded.
Study procedures
In order to identify the influence of the studied body lotions, we measured 
capillary blood glucose before, immediately after application (T0), then 5, 
30 and 60 minutes after the application. We used three types of body 
lotions most frequently used in sub-Saharan Africa, and specifically in 
Cameroon, including sweet almond oil (4.8% per 100 mg carbohydrates, 
80% oleic acid, 20% linoleic acid and other fatty acid), corticosteroid 
cream (0.1% hydrocortisone 17 butyrate per 100 ml) and hydroquinone 
skin-lightening lotion (2.0% hydroquinone per 100 ml). A swab prepared 
for 3 seconds by dipping in each body lotion was used to apply one thin 
layer on the distal phalanx of third and fourth fingers of the left and right 
hands of all participants. Reference values used to compare capillary 
measurements were plasma glucose and capillary glucose of clean finger 
(fifth finger of left hand after a careful hand washing). Capillary blood 
glucose was measured using a drop of whole capillary blood obtained by 
pricking a fingertip with a lancet and then placed on the reagent bonded 
to the strip, analysed by glucometer (Accu-Chek® Performa Roche, 
Mannheim, Germany), which uses glucose dehydrogenase enzyme to 
convert the glucose in the blood to gluconolactone in the presence of 
pyrroloquinoline quinone coenzyme. The coefficient of variation of the 
device was <2% at the low, medium and high glucose levels. There was 
no difference between capillary glucose values before applications of 
sweet almond oil, corticosteroid cream or hydroquinone skin-lightening 
lotion compared to the clean finger. Therefore, we describe capillary 
glucose variations over time after application of the various cosmetics in 
comparison to the clean finger (control).
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using Stata 14.0 for Windows (StataCorp, TX, US). 
Figures were represented using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 for 
Windows (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, US). Wilcoxon sign rank or Kruskal-
Wallis test was used to explore the glycaemia before and after body 
lotion administration. The magnitude of the difference from baseline 
was further assessed using the corrected variation of capillary glucose 
from baseline values. This difference was expressed as percentage of the 
baseline capillary glucose value. A probability of p<0.05 was set as the 
threshold of statistical significance.
Results
The mean age in our study was 41.68 ± 15.80 years, and nine out of the 
16 participants were women. The mean value for capillary glycaemia of 
clean finger was 244 ± 161 mg/dL (13.54 ± 8.94 mmol/L).
Unlike the corticoid cream and sweet almond oil (delta [95% CI]: -0.2% 
[-7.9–2.6] and 0.5 [-5.7–6.9] respectively, both p-values >0.05), there was 
a significant increase (delta [95% CI]: 119.5% [77.4–222.1]) of capillary 
glucose level immediately after administration (T0) of hydroquinone-
containing body lotion (p<0.001) (Figure 1A). Capillary glucose values 
after the use of corticoid cream (p=0.873) and sweet almond oil (p=0.883) 
was stable over time (5, 30 and 60 minutes after application). In the case 
of the hydroquinone-containing body lotion, there was a significant 
difference between capillary glucose level 5 minutes (delta [95% CI]: 
81.6% [55.3–214.2]; p<0.001), 30 minutes (delta [95% CI]: 71.6% [21.8–
134.6]; p<0.001) and up to 60 minutes (delta [95% CI]: 58.3% [2.8–133.3]; 
p=0.013), after administration compared to the value obtained from the 
clean finger (Figure 1B).
Discussion
The body lotions used for this study are the most commonly 
commercialised ones in Cameroon and in many other sub-Saharan African 
countries. Skin-lightening is a very common practice in sub-Saharan African 
populations especially among women; for this purpose, hydroquinone and 
corticosteroids are the most commonly used cosmetics. A number of 
complications associated to the use of these products has been previously 
reported and include local and systemic complications.10 In this study, we 
focused on the immediate effects of sweet almond oil, a corticosteroid

cream and a hydroquinone-containing skin-lightening lotion on the 
accuracy of capillary glucose measurement over time.
We found that capillary blood glucose obtained after application of sweet 
almond oil and corticoid cream compared to clean finger showed no 
significant difference. These results were similar to those obtained by 
Ginsberg who found that there was no difference in capillary blood glucose 
from fingers soaked with a moisturising lotion rich in sweet almond compared 
to clean fingers.6 The use of the hydroquinone-containing body lotion on the 
other hand significantly increased the measured value of capillary glucose 
level. This overestimation was persistent up to 1 hour after application of 
this latter cosmetic. A similar observation has been reported by Bouche 
et al. after the use of a 1% hydroquinone-containing body lotion, half the 
concentration used in our study.9 Bouche et al. observed discrepant capillary 
glycaemic values in two insulin-treated patients with diabetes. An elevated 
capillary glucose was observed in the first case despite previous insulin 
adjustments in the absence of glycosuria. In the second case, a discrepancy 
was obtained with a clinical presentation suggestive of hypoglycaemia. This 
shows the clinical relevance of capillary glucose measurements which could 
be affected by inaccurate readings related to the use of hydroquinone-
containing body lotions. Furthermore, one could easily imagine the negative 
impact of falsely elevated values on patients’ management with an 
accretion of the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with CSII or MDI.11 
Furthermore, this could yield discrepant results in patients under continuous 
glucose monitoring devices requiring calibration or verification, at high or low 
interstitial glucose levels, with capillary glucose measurements.
Our study has the merit of enrolling participants in a broad range 
of glycaemia with the aim to evaluate the influence of the three 
commonly used body lotions in sub-Saharan Africa. It is, however, likely 
that the margin of error (delta) from the baseline glucose value, used 
to estimate deviation from the value obtained from the clean finger, 
would be smaller in high glucose range. We therefore acknowledge that 
the limited number of participants per glucose strata does not enable 
us to further explore the impact of the explored body lotions at the 
different levels of glucose values. It is obvious however that as opposed 
to the patients with very high capillary glucose value, falsely elevated 
capillary glucose could likely lead to more clinically relevant deleterious 
consequences in patients in the medium or low glucose level (75% of 
our study population). In this range of glucose values, falsely elevated 
glucose measurements could eventually induce an additional challenge 
to the diagnosis of hypoglycaemic episodes especially in patients with 
problematic hypoglycaemia.12 Hand washing prior to capillary glucose 
measurement should therefore strongly be recommended to patients 
with diabetes mellitus.9
Conclusion
Hydroquinone-containing body lotions induce falsely elevated capillary 
glucose measurements that persisted up to 60 minutes after usage. 
Education of both health practitioners and patients on this potential 
influence 
of 
hydroquinone-containing 
cosmetics 
could 
reduce 
misinterpretation of inappropriately high capillary glucose levels in daily 
clinical practice.
