Key points
r Despite an attenuated fluctuation in ovarian hormone concentrations in well-trained women,
one in two of such women believe their menstrual cycle negatively impacts training and
performance.
r Forthcoming large international events will expose female athletes to hot environments, and
studies evaluating aerobic exercise performance in such environments across the menstrual
cycle are sparse, with mixed findings.
r We have identified that autonomic heat loss responses at rest and during fixed-intensity exercise
in well-trained women are not affected by menstrual cycle phase, but differ between dry and
humid heat.
r Furthermore, exercise performance is not different across the menstrual cycle, yet is lower in
humid heat, in conjunction with reduced evaporative cooling.
r Menstrual cycle phase does not appear to affect exercise performance in the heat in well-trained
women, but humidity impairs performance, probably due to reduced evaporative power.
Abstract
We studied thermoregulatory responses of ten well-trained [ ˙
VO2max, 57 (7) ml
min−1 kg−1] eumenorrheic women exercising in dry and humid heat, across their menstrual
cycle. They completed four trials, each of resting and cycling at fixed intensities (125 and
150 W), to assess autonomic regulation, then self-paced intensity (30 min work trial), to
assess behavioural regulation. Trials were in early-follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases
in dry (DRY) and humid (HUM) heat matched for wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT, 27°C).
During rest and fixed-intensity exercise, rectal temperature was �0.2°C higher in ML than EF
(P < 0.01) independent of environment (P = 0.66). Mean skin temperature did not differ between
menstrual phases (P � 0.13) but was higher in DRY than HUM (P < 0.01). Local sweat rate and/or
forearm blood flow differed as a function of menstrual phase and environment (interaction:
P � 0.01). Exercise performance did not differ between phases [EF: 257 (37), ML: 255 (43) kJ, P =
0.62], but was 7 (9)% higher in DRY than HUM [263 (39), 248 (40) kJ; P < 0.01] in conjunction
with equivalent autonomic regulation and thermal strain but higher evaporative cooling [16
(6) W m2; P < 0.01]. In well-trained women exercising in the heat: (1) menstrual phase did
not affect performance, (2) humidity impaired performance due to reduced evaporative cooling
despite matched WBGT and (3) behavioural responses nullified thermodynamic and autonomic
differences associated with menstrual phase and dry vs. humid heat.

Introduction
In eumenorrheic women the approximate monthly
rhythm of the reproductive cycle is divided into follicular
and luteal phases based on the function of the uterus
and ovary, and corresponding fluctuations in hormonal
concentrations (Stephenson & Kolka, 1993). Progestogens
and oestrogens, the steroidal ovarian hormones, influence
several non-reproductive organs and systems including
thermoregulation (Charkoudian & Stachenfeld, 2014).
Oestrogens generally promote heat dissipation and lower
body temperature whereas progestogens have the opposite
effect (Charkoudian & Stachenfeld, 2014). Core body
temperature (Tcore) is regulated approximately 0.3 –
0.5°C higher during the luteal phase (Harvey & Crockett,
1932; Stephenson & Kolka, 1993). The notion of a
shift in thermoregulatory set-point is supported by an
elevated Tcore at rest and during passive and active
heat stress, and by an increased Tcore threshold for
thermoregulatory effector responses such as sweating
and cutaneous vasodilatation (Stachenfeld et al. 2000;
Kuwahara et al. 2005a,b). This shift in set-point and
threshold results in higher Tcore during the luteal phase
particularly when women exercise with environmental
heat stress (Avellini et al. 1980; Carpenter & Nunneley,
1988; Kolka & Stephenson, 1997; Tenaglia et al. 1999; Janse
de Jonge et al. 2012), leading several authors to suggest that
women should avoid competition or face a disadvantage
when performing exercise with environmental heat stress
during their luteal phase (Stephenson & Kolka, 1993;
Janse de Jonge, 2003; Charkoudian & Joyner, 2004; Janse
de Jonge et al. 2012). Yet there is a need for norms
and recommendations specific to these differing exercise
responses (Charkoudian & Joyner, 2004), especially as
there remains an under-representation of women in sport
and exercise research (Costello et al. 2014) and that > 40%
of women believe that their menstrual cycle has a negative
impact on training and performance (Bruinvels et al.
2016).
Only five published investigations appear to have tested
the notion of a reduced exercise heat-stress tolerance or
performance during the luteal phase of the menstrual
cycle. Two earlier investigations, which employed a
fixed-intensity (constant power) approach, identified that
exercise heat stress tolerance was reduced by �11 and
�16% during the mid-luteal compared to early follicular
phase (Avellini et al. 1980; Tenaglia et al. 1999), whereas
Kolka & Stephenson (1997) found no difference between
early and late follicular or mid-luteal phases. More
recently, Sunderland & Nevill (2003) demonstrated that
high-intensity intermittent running performance in the
heat remained unaltered between the mid-follicular and
mid-luteal phases, whereas Janse de Jonge et al. (2012)
reported a �6% reduction in endurance time in the
mid-luteal phase during an incremental test to exhaustion
in the heat.
From a thermoregulatory standpoint, the limited and
conflicting results above cannot be directly applied to
a well-trained, competitive woman for several reasons.
First, training status markedly alters effector responses,
with trained women demonstrating enhanced sweating
and cutaneous vasodilatation compared to untrained
women, and aerobic training per se improving these
effector responses (Roberts et al. 1977; Drinkwater, 1984;
Kuwahara et al. 2005a,b). Trained and competitive female
endurance athletes typically display a maximal aerobic
uptake ( ˙
VO2max) of > 3 l min−1 or > 55 ml kg−1 min−1
(Drinkwater, 1984), so it can be reasoned that in only
two (Avellini et al. 1980; Sunderland & Nevill, 2003) of
the above-mentioned investigations would participants
fit these criteria. Second and relatedly, trained women
have reduced reproductive hormone concentrations and
fluctuation between menstrual phases and associated
smaller difference in the bi-phasic Tcore (Dale et al. 1979;
Bullen et al. 1984; Kuwahara et al. 2005a,b). Indeed,
Kuwahara et al. (2005a,b) have observed less phase-related
differences in effector and Tcore responses for trained
than untrained women. Third, all previous investigations
have used a bout of fixed-intensity (constant power),
sub-maximal exercise to exhaustion as their mode of
investigation. These protocols have poor face-validity,
but more importantly they deprive us of our most
effective, powerful and nearly limitless (Benzinger, 1969;
Parsons, 2014) form of thermoregulation: behaviour.

Thermoregulatory behaviour in trained women across the menstrual cycle
2825
During (face-valid) exercise heat stress when able to
self-pace (variable intensity), we have demonstrated
that men ‘behave’ by reducing exercise intensity, and
therefore metabolic heat production, which modifies heat
exchange and allows for an improved compensability of
the thermal environment principally via a reduction in
required evaporation, that ultimately results in a reduced
thermoregulatory strain (Schlader et al. 2011a,b). There
is, however, evidence from passive heat stress models
indicating that such thermoregulatory behaviour is altered
by the menstrual cycle, with reports that the threshold
for an affective/behavioural response is shifted during the
luteal phase (Cabanac et al. 1971; Scarperi & Bleichert,
1983; Shoemaker & Refinetti, 1996); this remains untested
during exercise.
Forthcoming (at the time of writing) large international
events (2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 2018
Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, 2018 Asian
Games in Jakarta, 2019 IAAF World Championships in
Doha) will expose athletes to high levels of environmental
heat stress and the number of women participating at this
elite level is ever increasing, with the latest editions of
the above-named international events reporting 39–44%
of competitors as women. However, these environments
differ in their ambient thermal profile, from warm-humid
to dry-hot, with the latter usually permitting greater (full)
evaporation of sweat whilst the former does not and thus
high rates of evaporative cooling are not possible. Pre-
vious investigations have determined that when exposed
to approximate environmental heat but humid versus dry
in nature, women sweat less but more efficiently upon
exercising when exposed to humid heat as demonstrated
by similar Tcore responses (Morimoto et al. 1967; Frye
& Kamon, 1983) although no effect of the menstrual
phase was apparent (Shapiro et al. 1980). However, the
same limitations as discussed above apply to these studies
(training status and fixed-intensity exercise) and these
potential differences in thermoregulatory control across
menstrual phase may interact with differences in the
thermal environment (i.e. dry vs. evaporative heat trans-
fer), which would warrant examining in highly trained
women (i.e. by virtue of higher heat loss requirement).
Furthermore,toourknowledgenopublishedinvestigation
has compared how women perform when exposed to
equivalent dry and humid heat during exercise.
From the above, it can be concluded that research into
how well-trained women respond to environmental heat
stress across the menstrual cycle is markedly sparse. Given
these limited and conflicted findings, a hypothesis-driven
experiment was not possible. Instead, we sought to
characterise and compare the behavioural and auto-
nomic
thermoregulatory
responses
of
well-trained,
eumenorrheic women to exercise when exposed to
equivalent dry and humid heat stress during the early
follicular and mid-luteal phase of their menstrual cycle.
Methods
Ethical approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human
Ethics Committee: Southern A (14/99), and performed
in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration
of Helsinki, with each participant providing informed,
written consent.
Participants
Thirteen eumenorrhoeic, aerobically well-trained and
competitive women cyclists and triathletes volunteered
for this study. The participants’ mean (SD) characteristics
were: age, 34 (9) years; height, 1.65 (0.05) m; mass, 64
(6) kg; body surface area (BSA), 1.70 (0.09) m2; ˙
VO2max,
58 (9) ml min−1 kg−1; per cent body fat, 24 (5)%; and
peak aerobic power, 270 (35) W.
Experimental overview
All trials were during autumn to spring in Palmerston
North, when temperatures rarely exceed 22°C. No
participant had spent time in warmer climates or training
environments within the month preceding testing. All
participants attended the laboratory on six occasions:
(1) preliminary submaximal and maximal tests, (2)
experimental familiarization and (3–6) experimental
trials. The four experimental trials were a full cross-
over of menstrual phase (early follicular and mid-luteal)
and environment [dry and humid, at matched wet bulb
globe temperature (WBGT)]. All trials were counter-
balanced except that the same order of dry or humid
environmentwasretainedforeachmenstrualphasewithin
participants. Experimental trials were conducted at the
same time of day (± 1 h), and following > 24 h
of dietary and exercise control. Each trial consisted
of 12 min fixed-intensity cycling followed immediately
by a 30 min self-paced cycling performance trial. All
exercise was on an electronically braked cycle ergometer
(Lode Excalibur, Groningen, The Netherlands) with
participant-specific set up for the seat, handle bars and
pedals.
Preliminary testing and familiarisation
Submaximal and maximal capacity tests were undertaken
in the follicular phase to minimise potential physiological
effects of the menstrual cycle on ˙
VO2max performance.
Following body mass and height measurement, pre-
liminary testing was conducted in a temperate laboratory
environment (18–22 °C) with a fan-generated airflow
of 19 km h−1 facing participants. The submaximal test
consisted of four consecutive 6 min power outputs,

100, 125, 150 and 175 W, at comfortable but constant
cadence. Oxygen consumption was measured during the
last 2 min of each stage. Following 10 min rest, a maximal
capacity test was undertaken to measure ˙
VO2max. Work
rate began at 100 W and consisted of increments at
25 W min−1 until volitional fatigue. The linear relation
between power output and ˙
VO2 was subsequently used to
calculate workload for experimental trials, as 75% ˙
VO2max
(Jeukendrup et al. 1996).
At least 24 h following preliminary testing, the
familiarisation trial was undertaken to ensure participants
were accustomed to the experimental procedures and to
minimise learning effects. These trials replicated entirely
the experimental trials outlined below.
Dietary and exercise control
The day of and prior to any experimental trial was marked
by abstinence from alcohol, exercise and only habitual
caffeine use (as abstinence would in itself confound
from withdrawal effects). Additionally, participants were
provided with a standardised dinner [two Watties Snack
Meals, Heinz Watties, Hastings, New Zealand: 1363
(247) kJ providing 53 (6) g carbohydrate, 12 (4) g protein
and 8 (0.3) g fat] the night preceding the trial and were
asked to consume the same light meal (consisting of
toast or cereal) between 2 and 4 h prior to visiting the
laboratory for the trial. This dietary and exercise control
minimised variation in pre-trial metabolic state. Fluid was
encouraged and a euhydrated state was further ensured by
instructing the participants to drink 500 ml of water 2 h
prior to each trial.
Menstrual cycle phase and type of heat stress
Participants were tested during the early follicular (EF)
and mid-luteal (ML) phases, to maximise differences in
oestrogen and progesterone concentrations and permit
comparison with results of previous studies (Avellini et al.
1980; Kolka & Stephenson, 1997; Tenaglia et al. 1999;
Sunderland & Nevill, 2003; Janse de Jonge et al. 2012).
Testing occurred on days 3 (1) and 6 (1) (EF), and 18
(2) and 21 (3) (ML) following start of menses, with 12
(2) days separating the second EF and first ML trials.
Hatcher et al. (1988) suggested that a progesterone level
of > 9.5 nmol l−1 is good evidence that ovulation has
occurred. Using this criterion, three participants were
excluded from all data analysis whilst another had lower
[progesterone] in her first ML trial (4.1 nmol l−1). This
participant’s results were examined and found to be
consistent in magnitude and direction with those of other
participants. Furthermore, all statistical analyses were
completed with and without this participant and omitting
her had no impact on the magnitude or direction of
statistical results other than reducing observed power.
Therefore, we included her data in the final analyses for
n = 10.
In accordance with previous studies investigating
the influence of humid (HUM) versus dry (DRY)
environmental heat in women (Morimoto et al. 1967;
Shapiro et al. 1980; Frye & Kamon, 1983) heat stress
was indexed using WBGT because, while limited, it is
the most widely used empirical index (Brotherhood,
2008; Budd, 2008). Our decision-making was guided
by what typical or possible extreme conditions athletes
would encounter at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018
Commonwealth Games (humid) compared to the 2019
IAAF World Championships (dry), so a WBGT equivalent
to 27°C was chosen to elicit our HUM [29 (1)°C, 81 (3)%
relative humidity] and DRY [34 (0.2)°C, 41 (3)% relative
humidity] environments. Absolute humidity in these two
environments was 3.4 (0.1) and 2.2 (0.3) kPa, respectively.
Within each menstrual phase, exposure to DRY and HUM
environments was separated by 3 (1) days.
Experimental procedure
These four sessions were conducted in the same
environmental chamber with the 19 km h−1 airflow
mentioned above; however, the fan was turned off
for each �2 min data collection period (of each
6 min stage/interval) to minimise interference of air-
flow on measurement. On arrival to the laboratory
participants voided to produce a urine sample to confirm
a urine-specific gravity < 1.010 and hence euhydration,
nude weight was recorded and they then self-inserted
a rectal thermistor. A blood sample was obtained from
the antecubital vein, following which participants entered
the environmental chamber wearing only cycling shorts
and top, shoes and socks. Participants rested seated
on the ergometer for 20 min during which they were
instrumented and baseline measurements were recorded.
Participants then completed 6 min cycling at each
of 125 and 150 W, to allow sufficient warm-up and
fixed-intensity responses to be recorded. Physiological
measurements taken during the final 2 min of each
intensity included expired gas, heart rate (HR), blood
pressure (BP), forearm blood flow (FBF), cardiac output
( ˙
Q) and perceptual responses, whilst rectal (Trec) and skin
(¯
Tsk) temperatures as well as local sweat rate (LSR) were
measured continuously. Immediately on completion of
the 150 W bout, the ergometer was set to linear mode
based on the formula of Jeukendrup et al. (1996), where
participants were instructed to perform as much work as
possibleover30min.Duringthis30minself-pacedperiod,
work completed (kJ), HR, expired gas and perceptual
responses were recorded every 6 min, whilst Trec, ¯
Tsk and
LSR were measured continuously. Total work completed
was used as our performance criterion, whereas the time
profile of power output was used as our behavioural

criterion. Immediately following the 30 min self-paced
exercise, FBF was measured and following towel-drying
participants’nudeweightwasrecordedtoallowestimation
of whole-body sweat rate (WBSR). Tap water at 20°C and
in aliquots of 3 ml kg−1 bodyweight was provided to drink
ad libitum either at 15 min intervals or when requested
throughout each trial to minimise dehydration.
Measurements
Anthropometric. Participant
height
and
mass
were
measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany;
accurate to 0.1 cm) and scale (Jadever, Taipei, Taiwan;
accurateto0.01kg),fromwhichsurfaceareawasestimated
(Dubois & Dubois, 1916). Body composition was
measured using multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance
analysis (InBody 230, Seoul, Korea) using a standard
procedure (Kyle et al. 2004).
Respiratory. Expired respiratory gases were collected and
analysedfor ˙
VO2 andcarbondioxideelimination( ˙
VCO2),
ventilation ( ˙
VE) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER)
using an online, breath-by-breath system (VacuMed Vista
Turbofit, Ventura, CA, USA) using a 30 s average. The
system was calibrated before each trial using a zero and
β-standard gas concentrations, and volume (VacuMed 3l
Calibration Syringe).
Cardiovascular. HR was recorded from detection of R–R
intervals (Polar Vantage XL, Polar Electro, Kempele,
Finland) whilst BP was measured using a stethoscope
and a sphygmomanometer over the right brachial artery,
in duplicate and by the same experienced operator.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as diastolic
blood pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure. FBF was measured
using venous occlusion plethysmography (Whitney, 1953)
with a mercury-in-silastic strain-gauge on the widest
part of the forearm, supported at heart level. The
voltage output was acquired (PowerLab, ADInstruments,
Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed (Labchart Pro,
ADInstruments) in real time, as well as for offline
analysis. The venous occlusion pressure was 50 mmHg.
Forearm vascular resistance (FVR) was calculated as
FBF/MAP.
˙
Q was measured using CO2 rebreathing
(Defares, 1958), as described previously in our laboratory
(Schlader et al. 2010). End-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) during
the rebreathing procedure was measured (O2/CO2 gas
analyser, ADInstruments), with data acquisition and
displayasmentionedabove(ADInstruments).Differences
between PETCO2 and venous and arterial PCO2 were
corrected according to Paterson & Cunningham (1976)
and Jones et al. (1979). The CO2 content difference was
calculated according to McHardy (1967). Stroke volume
(SV) was calculated from the Fick equation.
Body
temperatures. Tcore
was
indexed
from
Trec,
measured using a calibrated rectal thermistor (Covidien
Mon-a-Therm, USA; accurate to 0.1°C) inserted 10 cm
beyond the anal sphincter. ¯
Tsk was measured at four sites
using calibrated skin thermistors (Grant Instrument Ltd,
Cambridge, UK; accurate to 0.2°C) fastened on calf, thigh,
chest and forearm using surgical tape (3M Healthcare,
USA). Area-weighted mean ¯
Tsk was calculated according
to the equation of Ramanathan (1964). Core and skin
temperatures were recorded using TracerDAQ software
(Measurement Computing Corporation, Norton, MA,
USA). To account for the relative influence of Tcore and
¯
Tsk on the activation of heat loss responses (Hertzman
et al. 1952) mean body temperature ( ¯
Tb) was calculated
as: 0.8 × Trec + 0.2 × ¯
Tsk (Stolwijk & Hardy, 1966).
Sweat rates. LSRwasmeasuredusingaventilatedcapsule
(Graichen et al. 1982). The capsule (3.5 cm2) was attached
to the neck dorsally and ventilated with dry air at
0.4 litres min−1. The effluent gas was sensed for humidity
(Honeywell Ltd, New Zealand) and temperature (National
Semiconductor, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The neck was used
because all limbs were used for other measures and it was
not exposed directly to the fan. WBSR was estimated from
body mass loss, corrected for fluid consumed.
Thermodynamics. Heat
stress
compensability
was
estimated using the heat strain index (HSI), with > 1.0
indicating uncompensable heat stress (Cheung et al.
2000). HSI was calculated as the ratio of the required
evaporative cooling for heat balance (Ereq; in W m2) and
the maximal evaporative capacity of the environment
(Emax; in W m2) (Belding & Hatch, 1955). Ereq was
calculated as Ereq = M − W ± (C + R) ± (Cres − Eres),
where: M is the rate of metabolic heat production
(W
m2),
calculated
as
follows
(Kenney,
1998):
M = (352 · (0.23 · RER + 0.77) · ˙
VO2)/BSA. W is the
rate of energy lost as external work (W m2). C
+ R is the rate of heat transfer from convection
(C; W m2) and radiation (R; W m2), calculated as
the sum of: C = hc · (TSk − TA)(Kerslake, 1972) and
R = 4.7 · (TA − TSk)
(Kenney,
1998)
where:
hc
is
the convective heat transfer coefficient (W m2 °C)
(Kerslake, 1972) and TA is the ambient temperature
(°C). Cres + Eres is the rate of respiratory conductive
(Cres) and evaporative (Eres) heat transfer, and was
calculated as follows (Kenney, 1998): Cres + Eres =
(0.0012 · M · (34 − TA)) + (0.0023 · M · (44 − PA),
where PA is ambient vapour pressure (kPa). Emax was
calculated as Emax = LR · hc∗(PSk − PA), where LR is
the Lewis Relation (16.5°C kPa) and PSk is the saturated
vapour pressure at the skin (in kPa). Additionally, the
rate of evaporative heat loss (E; in W m2) was estimated
according to the following equation (Kerslake, 1972):

E = (PSk − PA) · √v · 124 where v is air velocity (0.5 m
s−1). The rate of body heat storage (S, in W m2) at
every recording interval was calculated as follows:
S = M − W + E + C + R + Cres + E res.
Perceptual. Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was
measured using the 15-grade scale, from 6 to 20 (Borg,
1970), whilst thermal sensation (TS) and discomfort (TD)
were measured using seven and four point scales, as
described by Gagge et al. (1967).
Hormonal. Blood was collected by venipuncture into a
vacutainer (Becton-Dickinson, Oxford, UK) containing
clot activator. Following inversion and clotting, the whole
blood was centrifuged at 4°C and 805 g for 12 min and
aliquots of serum were transferred into Eppendorf tubes
(Genuine Axygen Quality, USA) and stored at −80 °C
until further analysis. Serum samples were analysed
using enzyme-linked immune assays for 17β-oestradiol
(DemeditecDiagnostics,Kiel,Germany)andprogesterone
(IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) with a sensitivity
of 22.7 pmol l−1 and 0.14 nmol l−1, respectively, and an
intra-assay variation of 4 and 6%, respectively.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software
for windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY, USA).
Descriptive values were obtained and reported as means
and standard deviation (SD) unless stated otherwise.
Levene’s test was used to ensure data did not differ
substantially from a normal distribution. Data were
analysed by three-way (menstrual phase × heat stress
× time) ANOVA for repeated measures. Resting and
fixed-intensity exercise data were analysed separately from
self-paced exercise data. Sphericity was assessed and where
the assumption of sphericity could not be assumed,
adjustmentstothedegreesoffreedomweremade(ε>0.75
= Huynh-Feldt; ε < 0.75 = Greenhouse-Geisser). Where
main or interaction effects occurred, post hoc pairwise
analyses were performed using a paired samples t-test
(Bonferroni correction where relevant), with statistical
significance set at P � 0.05. To examine how menstrual
phase and type of heat stress affected the thermal control
of the effector responses (LSR and FBF), the visually
determined linear portion of each response against ¯
Tb
was analysed using simple linear regression [y = y0+a∗x]
and compared using two-way (menstrual phase × heat
stress) ANOVA. The onset threshold was defined as the
y-intercept (y0) of the regression line with values at base-
line, while the thermosensitivity was defined as the slope
(a) of the regression line. Given its putative role in the shift
in thermoregulatory set-point and threshold for effector
responses between menstrual phases, we sought to further
determine whether [progesterone] was associated with
or predicted the key variables of exercise performance
and resting Trec, FBF and LSR. First, we described the
form and strength of bivariate association using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient for both the absolute values and
change (�) between menstrual phases. Next we used
hierarchical multiple regression to estimate the effect of
[progesterone] on these key variables while controlling
for potential confounding from [oestrogen].
Results
Ovarian hormone concentrations
Progesterone [EF: 1.7 (1.2) vs ML: 53.5 (51.8) nmol l−1]
and 17β-oestradiol [EF: 185 (166) vs ML: 364 (259)
pmol l−1] concentrations were significantly higher in the
luteal phase (both P < 0.001) but not different for each
environment (P = 0.43 and P = 0.24, respectively).
Exercise performance and behaviour
Work capacity was similar between menstrual phases
[EF: 257 (37) vs ML: 255 (43) kJ, P = 0.62] but was
7 (9)% higher in DRY than in HUM [263 (39) vs 248
(40) kJ; P = 0.001] (Fig. 1). Accordingly, mean power
output was unaffected by menstrual phase (P = 0.87)
but 5 (8)% higher in DRY than in HUM [146 (22)
vs 139 (22) W; P < 0.01]. When viewing behaviour
as the self-paced exercise profile, behaviour differed
between environments as a function of menstrual phase
(environment × phase × time: P = 0.03). Specifically,
participants reduced workload more rapidly in HUM,
which was more pronounced in EF than in ML.
Thermoregulatory measures
Body temperatures. Trec when resting was 0.21 (0.14)°C
higher in ML than in EF (P < 0.01) and remained
higher by 0.16 (0.10)°C during fixed-intensity exercise
(P < 0.01) (Fig. 2). The rise in Trec throughout this
exercise (P < 0.01) was not dependent on menstrual
phase or environment (interaction: P = 0.66). During
self-paced exercise Trec differed between environments as
a function of menstrual phase (environment × phase
× time: P = 0.02). Specifically, the between-phase
differences seen at rest [0.13 (0.14)°C] and fixed-intensity
exercise [0.45 (0.24)°C] during DRY were not evident
during self-paced exercise [−0.04 (0.21)°C], whilst the
resting [0.29 (0.29)°C] and fixed-intensity [0.25 (0.14)°C]

Participants felt similar TS at rest between menstrual

Discussion
Research into how well-trained women respond to either
dry or humid heat stress across the menstrual cycle
remains sparse despite it being known that women sweat
more efficiently than men, and that ovarian hormones
exert multiple physiological effects including on sweating
function. Therefore, this investigation characterised and
compared the behavioural and autonomic thermo-
regulatory
responses
of
well-trained,
eumenorrheic
women to exercise when exposed to equivalent dry and
humidheatstressduringtheearlyfollicularandmid-luteal
phases of their menstrual cycle. The novel results are that:
(1) self-paced exercise performance (i.e. total work) was
not affected by menstrual phase but was impaired by a
humid environment, (2) whilst the autonomic (thermo-
effectoronsetthresholdsandthermosensitivities)thermo-
regulatory responses were similar between menstrual
phases and environments, the behavioural response (i.e.
exercise pacing) differed between environments as a
function of menstrual phase, and (3) the ovarian hormone
concentrations
and
fluctuations
between
menstrual
phases were not attenuated in these well-trained women
relative to values previously reported in less-trained
women. These results indicate that under the conditions of
this investigation, trained women behaviourally thermo-
regulate to minimise autonomic differences but at the
expense of their exercise performance under humid heat
stress.
Performance was unaffected by menstrual phase in either
environment. Our performance data (Fig. 1) support
some earlier findings that menstrual phase does not
affect heat-stress tolerance (Kolka & Stephenson, 1997;
Sunderland & Nevill, 2003), but are in contrast to other
reports in which tolerance/performance was reduced
by �6–16% in ML compared to EF (Avellini et al.
1980; Tenaglia et al. 1999; Janse de Jonge et al. 2012).
Importantly, however, these previous investigations did
not allow participants to pace themselves and were
performed to exhaustion, thereby limiting their ecological
validity for performance requirements.
Thermoregulatory differences across menstrual phases
and ambient conditions were nullified by thermoregulatory
behaviour. We have previously demonstrated in men
that reductions in work-rate in the heat are a form
of behavioural thermoregulation that serve to improve
heat exchange (Schlader et al. 2011b) that cannot be
achieved when the work-rate is constant (Schlader et al.
2011a). The current results extend these observations to
women. This is perhaps best illustrated by the impact

of changing from one exercise modality to the other
(constant vs. variable intensity). For instance, at rest
or during fixed-intensity exercise (125 or 150 W) the
effector (LSR, FBF, FVR; Fig. 3 and Table 1) and thermo-
dynamic (M, S, Ereq; Fig. 4) responses display differences
between menstrual phase and/or environments, but these
differences disappear when allowed to self-pace. At its
most pronounced this exercise behaviour constituted a
reduction in power output �31 W or �12% of peak
aerobic power (Fig. 1). Such a sustained (6 min) reduction
in work-rate resulted in a �238 W m2 lower M that
required �219 W m2 less evaporative cooling for heat
balance. It has been shown previously that total heat loss,
predominantly from E, during exercise in compensable
environments, such as those in this study (Fig. 4, HSI),
is dependent on Ereq, and M largely determines Ereq
(e.g. Gagnon et al. 2013). Thus, it follows that in our
participants the behavioural adjustments during exercise
minimised autonomic differences (LSR, WBSR). The
behavioural adjustments displayed by our participants in

thecurrentstudy(Fig.1)display‘classic’pacingintheheat,
whereby physiological strain is constrained and allows a
‘reserve’ for an end-spurt that reduces the likelihood of
exhaustion and heat illness (Schlader et al. 2011c). That
this behaviour/pacing is probably mediated, at least in
part, by perceptual cues appears likely and is supported
by there being no differences between all three scales used
in the current study (Fig. 5), as discussed elsewhere (see
Flouris & Schlader, 2015).
Thermoregulatory
behaviour
differed
between
environments as a function of menstrual phase. Another
novel result is that these women reduced workload more
rapidly and performed worse in HUM compared to
DRY, despite matched WBGTs. This is probably due
to low(er) rates of evaporative cooling (Fig. 4) driven
by the reduced vapour pressure gradient between skin
and environment, which is consistent with previous
observations (Morimoto et al. 1967; Shapiro et al. 1980;
Frye & Kamon, 1983). However, it should be noted
that whilst this performance decrement in humid versus
dry heat has been demonstrated previously in men
(e.g. Sen Gupta et al. 1984) it was unknown whether
this would be replicated in women due to their greater
sweating efficiency in this environment (Morimoto
et al. 1967; Shapiro et al. 1980; Frye & Kamon, 1983).
Furthermore, our observation that the initiation of
thermal behaviour in HUM occurred earlier in EF than
in ML (Fig. 1) supports previous investigations that
used passive-heating behavioural models to determine
that the threshold for affective/behavioural response
is menstrual phase-dependent (Cabanac et al. 1971;
Scarperi & Bleichert, 1983; Shoemaker & Refinetti, 1996).
Nevertheless, it should be highlighted that this behaviour
during HUM was not sufficient to completely diminish
the differences observed for Trec (from rest) in spite of no
differences for S.
Phase-related differences in Tcore
but not ovarian
[hormone] were not attenuated compared to less trained
women. Our finding of an elevated Tcore at rest and

Thermoregulatory behaviour in trained women across the menstrual cycle
2835
EF is consistent with those of others (Avellini et al.
1980; Carpenter & Nunneley, 1988; Kolka & Stephenson,
1997; Tenaglia et al. 1999; Janse de Jonge et al.
2012). Our results also support previous observations
that trained women have a smaller difference in the
bi-phasic Tcore and no phase-related difference for the
Tcore threshold for sweating or cutaneous vasodilatation
(Kuwahara et al. 2005a,b). Yet, our participants did not
have the reduced ovarian hormone concentrations or
between-phase fluctuations that were evident in pre-
vious studies (Dale et al. 1979; Bullen et al. 1984;
Kuwahara et al. 2005a,b). However, when examining
our participant data further by separating into greater
(n = 5, 59–70 ml min−1 kg−1) and lesser (n = 5,
48–56 ml min−1 kg−1) trained, a clear difference in
the absolute and relative (�) hormone concentrations
appeared such that a posteriori analysis confirmed ˙
VO2max
correlated with [oestrogen] (r = 0.79, P < 0.01) but not
[progesterone] (r = −0.14, P = 0.55).
Considerations
The design of comparing the responses of women
between EF and ML used within this study has the
specific advantage of being applicable to competitive
women experiencing their natural, endogenous hormonal
changes. Furthermore, our rationale was based on
(1) maximising the differences in [oestrogen] and
[progesterone] occurring naturally/endogenously, (2)
permitting comparison with and therefore expansion
beyond
previous
results,
and
(3)
the
previous
research indicating that women self-report training and
performance to be impacted negatively by their menstrual
cycle. However, whilst this approach ‘captures’ the phases
of lowest hormone exposure and peak [progesterone]
it does not include for comparison the late-follicular
(pre-ovulatory) phase, when [oestrogen] peaks and
during which it has been demonstrated that resting
Tcore and the threshold for thermoregulatory effector
responses are shifted to a lower Tcore (Stephenson
& Kolka, 1999). However, the same authors did not
observe any exercise performance change between this
late-follicular, EF and ML phases (Kolka & Stephenson,
1997). It must also be noted that women are in EF
and ML for �50% of their reproductive lives, and that
hormone exposure does not determine effect, i.e. receptor
activity (Stachenfeld & Taylor, 2014). Moreover, the
ovarian and other reproductive (luteinising and follicle
stimulating) hormones exert independent effects, and
in combination their effects on the body’s systems are
complex and multi-faceted, and extend beyond thermo-
regulation. Thus, other experimental designs are required
(e.g. hormonal contraception or suppression) to allow
causal inferences to be made (Stachenfeld & Taylor,
2014).
Many elite athletes often have irregular menstrual cycles
or take the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) for reasons of
contraception and/or to negate pre-menstrual symptoms
and manipulate the menstrual cycle timing for travel,
training and competition (Bennell et al. 1999). Pre-
vious investigations on OCP-users have reported that
the phase-related elevation in Tcore is maintained during
exercise in the heat (Tenaglia et al. 1999; Sunderland
& Nevill, 2003). However, this increased resting and
exercising Tcore and the concomitant increase in the
Tcore threshold for sweating differs according to the
type of OCP used, i.e. combined synthetic oestrogen +
progesterone versus progesterone only (Stachenfeld et al.
2000). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, only two published
studies have measured exercise performance with heat
stress using matched groups (OCP vs. eumenorrheic)
and the same limitations apply of not having used
self-paced protocols or well-trained women (Tenaglia
et al. 1999; Sunderland & Nevill, 2003). Therefore,
whether well-trained women using OCP differ in their
thermo-behavioural and performance responses from
matched eumenorrheic or to different thermal stress (dry
vs. humid) remains unknown.
One (de)limitation includes the lack of an untrained
cohort. They were not included because – at least in
a sporting context – performance is less imperative,
and hence they may rely on behavioural thermo-
regulation to a relatively greater extent (i.e. reduce
power output) and may introduce other confounding
effects by exhibiting different perceptual and behavioural
tolerance and motivation (e.g. McLellan, 2001; Tikuisis
et
al.
2002).
One
limitation
was
not
including
other physiological measures that are impacted by
ovarian (and other reproductive) hormones and could
contribute to performance/behaviour or homeostasis
during exercise in the heat (especially leg blood flow
and arterial oxygenation). Our focus was on autonomic
and behavioural thermoregulation, and even during
more prolonged and severe hyperthermia with marked
dehydration, oxygen delivery to the active musculature
is preserved despite a reduced blood flow – at least
in men (e.g. Gonzalez-Alonso et al. 1998, 2008).
Furthermore, using our PETCO2 data (not shown) as
an indication of alveolar ventilation, arterial oxygenation
seems unlikely to have been influenced by menstrual
phase or environment, as no significant main or inter-
action effects were evident. Finally, the current design
includedaperiodoffixed-intensityexerciseandaperiodof
variable-intensity exercise that were unequal in duration,
and it is unlikely that a thermoregulatory steady state
had been achieved during the fixed-intensity exercise;
therefore, as per our previous observations in men
(Schlader et al. 2011a,b), a longer (> 20 min) and
duration-matched protocol would strengthen the current
results.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates that when well-trained women
are allowed to behaviourally thermoregulate (self-pace)
during exercise in heat-stressful environments, thermo-
dynamic and autonomic differences associated with
menstrual cycle phase (early follicular vs. mid-luteal) and
the type of heat stress (dry vs. humid) were abolished.
However, this is to their performance detriment during
humid heat and in this environment the phase-related
(post-ovulation) increase in Trec persists.
