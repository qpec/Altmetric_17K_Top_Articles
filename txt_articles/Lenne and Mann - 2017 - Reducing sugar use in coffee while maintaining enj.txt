 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
2 
 
 
Abstract 
Consuming coffee without (or with less) sugar may help people lower their daily calorie intake 
without restrictive dieting. We tested two theory-based interventions to help people do so. One 
involved gradually reducing sugar over time, and the other was based on mindfulness theory. 
These interventions were compared to a repeated exposure (to sugar-free coffee) group. 
Participants in all conditions had significant increases in consumption of sugar-free coffee that 
lasted six months. The mindfulness group had a larger increase than the others. Unexpectedly, 
the gradual reduction intervention led to a decrease in liking for sugar-free coffee, and was the 
least effective.

Reducing Sugar Use in Coffee While Maintaining Enjoyment: A Randomized Trial 
 
 
Levels of obesity have increased rapidly in the last forty years (Flegal et al., 2016), and 
efforts to treat it with calorie-restricting diets have had short-term, but not long-term success 
(Mann et al., 2007). Making several small changes to one’s everyday eating habits (e.g., 
switching to diet soda instead of full-calorie soda; Miller and Perez, 2014) may be a more 
effective way to induce small but sustainable weight loss. 
One part of many people’s diets that has yet to be tapped for recurring calorie reduction is 
the sugar and fat that they add to their coffee. Over half of adult Americans drink coffee every 
day, averaging 3.1 cups per day (LaComb et al., 2011; An, 2016). Only a third of U.S. coffee 
consumers drink their coffee black. The rest add a sweetener, fat in the form of milk or cream, or 
both, resulting in an average daily caloric increase of 69 calories (An and Shi, 2017). 
There are 48 calories in one tablespoon of sugar, and over the course of a day, some 
coffee drinkers may use their entire recommended daily allotment of added sugar (100 calories 
for women/150 for men; American Heart Association, 2014) just in their coffee. In addition, 
excess sugar consumption is not only linked to increased risk for obesity, it also increases risk for 
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, independent of obesity (Malik et al., 2010). 
Entirely removing coffee from one’s diet is not an optimal solution to this problem, as 
most individuals are not inclined to give up their daily coffee. One survey found that among 
people who had been regular coffee drinkers, only 20% no longer drank it (Hughes and Oliveto, 
1997). Plus, correlational studies show an inverse relationship between coffee consumption and 
type 2 diabetes (Kempf et al., 2010; Salazar-Martinez, 2004; van Dam and Hu, 2005), although 
confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic status) cannot be ruled out. Regardless of whether the 
specific chemical components of black coffee have a causal benefit for health, if it is used as a 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
4 
substitute for a sugary beverage, on balance it will be a healthier tradeoff. Indeed, research has 
shown that replacing one sugar-sweetened beverage with black coffee daily leads to a 17% 
reduced risk for type 2 diabetes (De Koning et al., 2011). 
Substituting low-calorie artificial sweeteners for sugar is also not an ideal solution for 
reducing calories (and sugar) in coffee because these sweeteners carry their own risks. Additions 
of commercial formulations of saccharin, sucralose, or aspartame have been shown to lead to the 
development of glucose intolerance, a precursor to diabetes, in both humans and mice (Suez et 
al., 2014). Introducing saccharin into the diets of healthy individuals led to disruptions in 
glycemic response in just one week. Further bolstering the causal relationship, these researchers 
discovered the mediational pathway (gut microbiota) through which artificial sweeteners led to 
glucose intolerance in mice (Suez et al., 2014). 
Strategies for Reducing Sugar in Coffee 
In this pre-registered randomized controlled trial, we devised and tested two interventions 
aimed at helping coffee drinkers stop adding sweeteners to their daily coffee. One intervention 
involves gradually and just barely detectably decreasing the amount of sugar added to coffee over 
time. This method has been used to reduce the salt in tomato juice, and liking for the juice did not 
decrease as salt was removed over fourteen weeks (Bobowski et al., 2014). Similar methods have 
been created for increasing the whole-wheat content of bread (Delk and Vickers, 2007). We 
expect this intervention to have the same effect: liking for coffee should not decrease as sugar is 
gradually reduced, and participants should drink their coffee sugar-free more often after the 
intervention ends than participants in the control group. 
The second intervention is based on mindfulness theory (Brown et al., 2007), which 
encourages the moment-by-moment awareness of life with the goal of preventing people from 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
5 
getting so caught up in their thoughts that they scarcely notice life as it is passing by them. 
Mindful eating interventions teach participants to 1) eat with great attention and focus so that 
they notice all sensory aspects of their food, and 2) increase their awareness of bodily sensations 
of hunger and fullness, so that they can regulate their appetite and consumption (Kristeller et al., 
2013; Papies et al., 2011). These interventions have been successfully used to increase enjoyment 
of a typically avoided food (i.e., prunes; Hong et al., 2014), a food that evokes mixed feelings 
(i.e., raisins; Arch et al., 2016) and a liked food (chocolate; Arch et al., 2016). Our aim was not to 
train awareness of hunger and fullness, so we did not include those aspects of the training. 
Instead we focused on taste experience and taste satisfaction. Because coffee is a complex 
beverage, we also included a brief introduction to coffee tasting, so that when participants pay 
attention to their coffee, they are able to detect and appreciate its flavor, aftertaste, and other 
attributes. We expect that individuals who use this strategy will like unsweetened coffee more, 
and consume unsweetened coffee more often, than participants in the control condition. 
In the control condition, participants are asked to give up sweeteners in their coffee for 
the duration of the study, without being given any strategy. This condition allows us to test 
whether the other interventions lead to increased liking of sugar-free coffee beyond what may 
result from being repeatedly exposed to it (Anzman-Frasca et al., 2012; Birch, 1990; Zajonc, 
2001). These “mere exposure” effects, while small, have been documented in the literature with a 
host of stimuli (Zajonc, 2001), but they have not been consistently found with food. In particular, 
they have been found for some novel foods tested (Pliner, 1982; Stein et al., 2003; Mattes, 1994), 
as well as foods that, while not novel, were rarely eaten by the participants (Wardle et al., 2003a, 
2003b; but see Bingham et al., 2005). Studies that test familiar foods tend to find decreased 
liking with repeated exposure (Pliner et al., 1980; Rolls et al., 1981).

Although coffee is familiar to participants in this study, coffee without sugar tastes quite 
different and is likely novel to them. We expect repeated exposure to lead to small but 
statistically significant increases in liking and consumption of unsweetened coffee over the 
course of the study, but we expect the other two interventions to lead to significantly larger 
increases. 
Methods 
Participants 
Participants were recruited through flyers and online postings for a “study on how to 
reduce consumption of added sugar in coffee.” The flyer indicated that they would be asked to 
attend a one-hour session and complete brief surveys on their phone for two weeks. Flyers were 
posted at local coffee shops. People in the subject pools of the food science department and the 
business school at a large Midwestern university were informed of the study over email, and 
participants in the psychology department’s subject pool were notified via an online posting. 
Interested subjects visited a link containing a screener survey. 
Individuals were accepted into the study if they indicated on the screener that they: (1) 
consumed at least 1 cup of coffee a day with added sugar, (2) drank regular cups of coffee or 
Americanos (rather than cappuccinos or lattes) most of the time, (3) were willing to remove sugar 
from their coffee for the 2-week study, (4) were 18 to 65 years old, (5) had a smartphone with 
internet access, (6) were confident (i.e., 7+ on a 9-point scale) in their ability to complete a brief 
survey each day for 14 consecutive days, and (7) were available during one of the nine study 
session dates. Eligible participants were then presented a list of available sessions, all on 
weekday mornings between February 11 and February 19, 2016, and they signed up for 
whichever was convenient for them. Although each session included only one of the study 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
7 
conditions, participants were unaware of this and were blind to the condition to which they 
registered. Participants were compensated $40 at the end of the two-week study period, and 
entered into a raffle for one of two $50 Target gift cards at the six-month follow-up. 
There were 254 individuals who started the screener, of whom 198 were eligible to 
participate. Of these, 193 scheduled a session online and 129 showed up for the session (see 
Figure 1 for consort diagram).  
 
[Insert Figure 1] 
 
Two subjects were removed for providing incomplete data based on a pre-registered exclusion 
rule (missing data on seven or more of the 14 intervention days), leaving a final sample of 127 
participants (76% female) ranging in age from 18 to 62 years (n =126, M = 26.62, SD = 9.83), 
and body mass index from 17 to 41 (n = 125, M = 24.24, SD = 3.93). The sample is 76% White, 
16% Asian, 4% Hispanic, 2% Black, and 2% Other. One participant failed to complete gender, 
age, and ethnicity questions. Two failed to complete BMI questions. Sample size, exclusion 
criteria, and stopping rules were pre-registered (osf.io/yq52s) and determined by balancing time 
and monetary constraints with power constraints. The Institutional Review Board of the 
university approved the study protocol. 
Design 
The study uses a mixed design. There is one between-subjects factor: subjects are 
randomly assigned (by session, using block randomization) to one of three sugar removal 
conditions. There is also a within subjects factor: Participants provide repeated measures on two 
variables (e.g., coffee enjoyment and attention to coffee) each day for 14 days, allowing the 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
8 
examination of within-person changes over time. 
Procedure 
Subjects completed a screener for eligibility (T0), attended a training session (T1), 
responded to daily questions during a 14-day intervention period (T2), and responded to follow-
up questionnaires at the end of the 14th intervention day (T3), and one-month (T4) and six-
months (T5) after the 14-day intervention period ended. 
Training (T1). Nine study sessions of 10 to 20 participants were conducted. Upon arrival 
subjects were seated, given a consent form, and were told about the study by a research assistant. 
Once participants had asked any questions and had them answered, they signed the consent form.  
Then they responded to demographic and personality questions, an assessment of their coffee 
consumption behavior over the last month, and their enjoyment of coffee as they normally drink 
it. Subjects were then poured a cup of coffee and instructed to add their normal amount and type 
of milk, cream, or creamer to the coffee. Subjects then tasted it and responded to measures of 
liking for this sugar-free coffee, and for the coffee after adding their usual amount of sugar. Next 
subjects were trained on how to complete the study questionnaire for T2 on their mobile device, 
and were instructed to respond to that survey after their first cup of coffee every day for the next 
two weeks. They were shown how to set a daily reminder for this task, and they were reminded 
that throughout the study, they were to continue to use their normal type and quantity of whitener 
(e.g., milk, cream) in their coffee. Once this standard training was finished, participants were 
given specific instructions based on their assigned condition. Once participants asked any 
questions and understood their instructions, they were provided a summary of their condition’s 
procedures, thanked, and released. 
Condition 1: Control. Participants in the control condition were instructed to drink their 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
9 
coffee without any sweetener for the next two weeks. To keep expectations equivalent with 
the other conditions, they were told: “This might be challenging, but research shows that if you, 
for example, stop adding salt to your food, you will get used to it that way. We are trying this 
with sugar in coffee.” This condition allows us to assess the effects of merely repeating exposure 
to sugar-free coffee (Anzman-Frasca et al., 2012; Birch, 1990; Zajonc, 2001). 
Condition 2: Gradual Sugar Reduction. Participants in this condition were asked to 
gradually reduce the amount of sugar in their coffee. They were told that they would drink coffee 
with their normal amount of sugar on the first intervention day, and subsequently reduce the 
amount of sugar they add to their coffee every two days until they were drinking it with no sugar. 
To keep expectations about the effectiveness of all three interventions equivalent, participants 
were told: “This might be challenging, but research shows that if you, for example, gradually 
reduce the amount of salt in your food, you will get used to it that way. We are trying this with 
sugar in coffee.”  
Sugar was reduced by units of ⅙  
of each participant’s starting sugar amount. For 
example, if they normally put 3 teaspoons of sugar into their coffee, their standard deduction was 
½ teaspoon. Thus, on day 2 they reduced by ½ teaspoon, thereby using 2 ½ teaspoons in their 
coffee that day. After two days at this sugar quantity, they reduced by another ½ teaspoon to 2 
teaspoons. This reduction every two days continued until day 12, when their last reduction 
resulted in them having no sugar in their coffee at all for the final three days of the study. 
Subjects were given individually-tailored packets with the exact amount of sugar they 
would need for each cup of coffee for each day of the intervention. Each packet contained the 
sugar for one cup of coffee and was labeled with the date to use it. The type of sugar and the 
amount required for each day was determined prior to the session using responses to three items 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
10 
from the screening (T0) questionnaire. Those items assessed (1) how many separate cups of 
coffee they typically had in a day (M = 2.31, SD = 0.78, Range = 1.0 – 5.0); (2) how many 
teaspoons or packets of sugar they usually add to their cup of coffee (M = 2.17, SD = 1.26, 
Range = 0.5 – 9.0); and (3) the type of sugar they usually add to their coffee (85% used some 
type of sugar, the rest used a sugar substitute). Ambiguous or implausible responses were 
clarified over email. 
Condition 3: Mindfulness Training. Participants were given a brief version of one 
component (mindfully eating a raisin) of the standardized Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness 
Training (MB-EAT) (Kristeller et al., 2013; Papies et al., 2011), adapted for coffee consumption. 
In addition, a coffee professional gave a 10-minute training on five key features to notice in 
coffee (flavor, acidity, sweetness, mouth-feel, and aftertaste) to help participants become more 
mindful of various sensory aspects of coffee. Three different coffees were poured, their five key 
features were described, and subjects were guided through the mindful “raisin” activity as they 
tasted each one. The tasting activity involved taking time to slowly and deliberately (1) hold the 
cup of coffee and notice its warmth, (2) see the steam rise from the cup and the liquid move 
about, (3) smell the aroma and notice how it makes one feel, (4) place the cup against one’s 
mouth and take a sip, noticing how one moved and prepared to take the sip, (5) take several small 
sips and further notice new sensations and textures, and (6) reflect on how the experience made 
you feel. After the training, participants were asked to use those techniques to drink their coffee 
sugar-free over the next 14 days. To equalize expectations, they were told “this might be 
challenging, but research shows that if you, for example, stop adding salt to your food and start 
eating that food mindfully, you will get used to it that way. We are trying this with sugar in 
coffee.”

Intervention Period (T2). Subjects used their strategy for 14 consecutive days following 
training. After drinking their first cup of coffee each day, participants responded to the 
questionnaire they had placed on their phone. 
Follow-ups (T3,T4,T5). Participants received questionnaires by email on the last day of 
the 14-day intervention period (T3), and also one-month (T4) and six-months (T5) later. Attrition 
was low, and equal across conditions (Figure 1). 
 Primary Measures 
Actual Sugar Use. At T1, T4, and T5 sugar-free coffee consumption over the prior month 
was measured in two ways. One measure was of self-reported frequency (0 = “never” to 4 = “all 
the time”), and the other was of the percent of all coffees consumed that were sugar-free. 
Daily Enjoyment. During the 14-day intervention period (T2), enjoyment of coffee was 
measured daily after the first cup of coffee with two items (averaged into one overall enjoyment 
rating). One item asked participants how much they liked the coffee, and the other asked how 
unpleasant it tasted. Both items used 7-point scales (1 = “Not at All”; 7 = “Very Much”), and 
unpleasant ratings were reverse coded. 
Intention to drink coffee sugar-free. Intentions were assessed at T3, T4, and T5. All items 
were presented on 7-point scales. At T3 two items were used (and averaged to create an overall 
intentions score), “how likely are you to continue drinking your coffee sugar-free?”, and “I 
intend to continue drinking my coffee without sugar for the foreseeable future.” At T4 and T5, 
only the second item was asked. Higher scores represent stronger intentions to drink coffee sugar-
free.  
Daily Attention. Attention was measured each day of the 14-day intervention period (T2) 
after the first cup of coffee with the item: “How much attention were you paying to the taste and 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
12 
feel of the coffee as you drank it?” The item used a 7-point scale (1= “Not at All Attentive”; 7= 
“Very Attentive”). 
MEQ. The awareness subscale of the Mindfulness Eating Questionnaire (MEQ; Framson 
et al., 2009) was adapted for coffee drinking, and administered at T1,T3, T4, and T5. It measures 
the extent to which individuals are aware of their internal states and senses while drinking coffee. 
The scale has 7 items using 4-point scales (1 = “never/rarely”; 4 = “usually/always”), including 
“I notice when there are subtle flavors in the coffee I drink.” 
Software 
The computational software, R version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21) and RStudio version 1.0.136 
(RStudio Team, 2016), were used for all analyses and figures. Linear mixed effects models were 
fit using the lmer function in the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2016). Maximum 
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was used for all models.  
Results 
Results are reported for all pre-registered analyses, and all analyses reported here were 
pre-registered unless stated otherwise. See Table 1 for means and standard deviations of each 
measure.

Behavior: Sugar Use. We hypothesized that one month and six months after the 
intervention ended, participants in the mindfulness and gradual reduction conditions would be 
more likely to consume their coffee sugar-free than participants in the control condition. 
According to our pre-registered one-tailed t-tests, mindfulness participants consumed their coffee 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
13 
sugar-free more frequently than control participants one month after the intervention ended (Mm 
= 2.89, Mc = 2.25, 95% CI [.168, ∞], t(66) = 2.27, p = .013, d = .56), and this difference 
remained marginally significant six months after the intervention (Mm = 3.03, Mc = 2.62, 95% 
CI [-.071, ∞], t(72) = 1.42, p = .080, d = .34; Figure 2, left panel).  
 
[Insert Figure 2] 
 
They also consumed a marginally greater percentage of their coffee sugar-free one month later 
(Mm = 69.49, Mc = 55.84, 95% CI [-.304, ∞], t(66) = 1.63, p = .054, d = .40) and six months 
later (Mm = 72.18, Mc = 60.71, 95% CI [-2.52, ∞], t(72) = 1.37, p = .088, d = .32; Figure 2, right 
panel). Contrary to our predictions, we did not find these effects with participants in the gradual 
reduction condition compared to the control condition for either measure, at either time point 
(frequency and percent at one-month, p’s = .701 and .796, and six-months, p’s = .919 and .855).  
To explore these same effects longitudinally (which we neglected to pre-register), we also fit 
linear mixed effects models interacting condition and time (reported at osf.io/yq52s, see analysis 
script). Results are consistent with the pre-registered effects reported above—mindfulness 
participants increased sugar-free consumption more than did control participants. 
Daily Enjoyment. We hypothesized that both interventions would produce increases in 
enjoyment of sugar-free coffee compared to the control condition. As pre-registered (see 
osf.io/yq52s for model fit details), we first fit a linear mixed effects model with random intercept 
and slope to examine changes in enjoyment of sugar-free coffee over the 14-day intervention 
period between mindfulness and control participants, excluding gradual reduction participants 
because they did not have sugar-free coffee until days 12-14. Counter to our hypothesis, there 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
14 
was not a significant difference between mindfulness and control participants in their overall 
level of enjoyment (β 
= 0.095, p = 0.658), nor was there a more rapid increase in enjoyment over 
time for mindfulness participants compared to control participants (β 
= 0.007, p = 0.738, see 
Figure 3).  
[Insert Figure 3] 
 
Participants in both conditions experienced a significant increase in their enjoyment for sugar-
free coffee (β 
= 0.071, p < 0.0001), even after controlling for baseline enjoyment of it (β 
= 0.071, 
p < 0.0001). 
The second pre-registered test of enjoyment included participants in the gradual reduction 
condition, and involved only the time points in which they consumed coffee without sugar 
(intervention days 12-14). Unexpectedly, participants in this condition enjoyed sugar-free coffee 
less than participants in the control condition, according to independent samples t-tests (Mr = 
4.56, Mc = 5.33, 95% CI [-1.25, -.298], t(83) = -3.326, p = .002), and their enjoyment decreased 
from baseline to days 12-14, relative to control participants’ increase in enjoyment over that same 
period (M2r - M1r = -.262, M2c - M1c = .860, 95% CI [-1.68, -.563], t(83) = -4.046, p = .0001). 
For participants in the gradual reduction condition, enjoyment steadily declined as sugar was 
gradually removed from their coffee (Figure 3). 
Intentions. We hypothesized that participants in the two interventions would have 
stronger intentions to continue drinking sugar-free coffee in the future than participants in the 
control condition. Although intentions were high for both mindfulness and control participants, 
mindfulness participants only reported significantly stronger intentions than control participants 
at the one-month (T4) follow-up (Mm = 5.66, Mc = 4.91, 95% CI [.108, ∞], t(66) = 1.953, p = 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
15 
.028, d = .481), and not on the 14th intervention day (T3), or 6 months (T5) after the intervention 
(p’s = .397 and .177). There were no differences between gradual reduction and control 
participants in intentions at any of the follow-ups (p = .858, p = .668, and p = .882 for T3, T4, 
and T5 respectively). 
Attention. As hypothesized, mindfulness participants paid closer attention to the taste and 
feel of their coffee when they drank it than control subjects did. This was tested with a linear 
mixed effects model with random intercept and slope (β= .543, p = .022, see Figure 4, 
Supplement), using the ratings of attention that participants reported after consuming their first 
cup of coffee each day. 
 
 
Mindful Awareness (MEQ.) We predicted that participants in the mindfulness condition 
would show a larger increase in mindful awareness than control participants. Both mindfulness 
and control participants significantly increased in mindful awareness of coffee from the 
beginning to the end of the study (β= .070, p = .019 for the main effect of time across these 
conditions), but unexpectedly, participants in the mindfulness condition did not increase at a 
faster rate (T3 minus T1; M3m - M1m = .118, M3c - M1c= .132, 95% CI [-.176, ∞], t(78) = -
.144, p = .557). 
Discussion 
Reducing the amount of sugar used in coffee is a sensible and healthy dietary change, and 
as shown here, participants in all three of our brief study conditions were able to make this 
change and sustain it for six months, although in varying amounts. The most effective approach 
was the mindfulness intervention, which trained individuals to consume coffee with close 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
16 
attention and focus, but repeated exposure alone was nearly as effective. 
We estimated the number of calories participants “saved” solely from sugar over the 
course of the study from their pre-intervention reports of the number of cups of coffee they 
consumed per day and the amount of sugar they used per cup, and their final reported percentage 
of cups consumed sugar-free. Participants in the mindfulness condition consumed about 53 fewer 
calories per day in the six months after the intervention than they did before the intervention, 
whereas control participants consumed 36 fewer calories per day, and gradual reduction 
participants consumed 21 fewer calories per day. 
The changes in sugar usage generally favoring the mindful intervention over the control 
condition were not entirely reflected in the other outcomes we measured, primarily because 
repeated exposure alone led to larger effects than we expected. Participants in the control and 
mindfulness conditions experienced a significant and substantial increase in their daily 
enjoyment for sugar-free coffee over time. They also had significant increases in intentions to 
consume their coffee sugar-free, and in their reports of overall mindfulness about coffee, but the 
mindfulness intervention did not lead to changes beyond those found in the control group. 
Mindfulness participants did, however, pay closer attention to the taste and feel of their 
coffee when they drank it than control subjects did. This variable was measured daily, 
immediately after drinking coffee, and may have been more sensitive to attentional differences 
than the broader mindful awareness measure, which participants completed just at the beginning 
and end of the intervention. 
The second intervention we tested, gradually reducing the amount of sugar used, was not 
effective in maintaining enjoyment. As less sugar was used in their coffee over 14 days, the less 
these participants enjoyed it. This finding contradicted our hypothesis, as well as prior research 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
17 
with salt (Bobowski et al., 2014). In that research, however, salt was reduced in smaller amounts 
(in 12 increments instead of our six) over a longer period of time (16 weeks compared to our 
two). It is possible that our reduction was too big and too quick to be effective. 
Our results suggest that people may be better off giving up sugar in their coffee all at 
once, rather than gradually, which does not appear to fit with common suggestions for adopting a 
sugar-free lifestyle. According to the first ten links from an internet search for “how to reduce 
sugar in your diet,” six websites recommended gradually reducing sugar and none recommended 
quitting abruptly (plus two recommended something in between these two strategies and two 
recommended neither.   
The primary limitation of these results is that participants were selected partly because 
they reported on the screening questionnaire that they were willing to reduce the sugar in their 
coffee for two weeks, so they may have been more motivated to do so than other coffee drinkers. 
We may not find such encouraging results with a less motivated population, such as individuals 
who were instructed by other people (such as a physician) to reduce sugar in their diet (although 
a doctor’s orders or threat of disease may also be motivating).  
Another limitation is that the mindfulness intervention was made up of two distinct 
components, and it is not possible to assess which aspect of it was potent. It is possible that 
training in mindful consumption of coffee on its own would lead to the effects found here, or that 
training in detecting salient features of coffee on its own would lead to these effects. Future 
research will be needed to test the separate and combined effects of these two components. 
Consuming excess sugar has been linked to weight gain and increased risk for diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease. Helping people reduce their sugar intake is an important goal for 
promoting health, and removing sugar from coffee appears to be a change that people can 
 REDUCING SUGAR USE IN COFFEE 
18

Figure 3. Enjoyment of the first cup of coffee consumed each day during the 14-day 
intervention period, rated immediately after consumption, by condition. Mean and 
standard error are depicted at each time point. The gradual reduction condition rated 
sugar-free coffee only at baseline, and days 12-14. Days 1 to 11 their sugar is being 
reduced by 1/6 of their starting amount every two days. Mindfulness and control 
conditions rated sugar-free coffee at all time points. The colored dashed lines represent 
change slopes from baseline to the mean of days 12-14.
