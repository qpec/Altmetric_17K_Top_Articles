Abstract
Background: The current recommendation of using transrectal ultrasound-guided bi-
opsy (TRUSB) to diagnose prostate cancer misses clinically significant (CS) cancers. More
sensitive biopsies (eg, template prostate mapping biopsy [TPMB]) are too resource
intensive for routine use, and there is little evidence on multiparametric magnetic
resonance imaging (MPMRI).
Objective: To identify the most effective and cost-effective way of using these tests to
detect CS prostate cancer.
Design, setting, and participants: Cost-effectiveness modelling of health outcomes and
costs of men referred to secondary care with a suspicion of prostate cancer prior to any
biopsy in the UK National Health Service using information from the diagnostic Prostate
MR Imaging Study (PROMIS).
Intervention: Combinations of MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, using different definitions
and diagnostic cut-offs for CS cancer.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Strategies that detect the most CS
cancers given testing costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in quality-
adjusted life years (QALYs) given long-term costs.
Results and limitations: The use of MPMRI first and then up to two MRI-targeted TRUSBs
detects more CS cancers per pound spent than a strategy using TRUSB first (sensitivity =
0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.92–0.98] vs 0.91 [95% CI 0.86–0.94]) and is cost
effective (ICER = £7,076 [s8350/QALY gained]). The limitations stem from the evidence
base in the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy and the long-term outcomes of men with CS
prostate cancer.
Conclusions: An MPMRI-first strategy is effective and cost effective for the diagnosis of
CS prostate cancer. These findings are sensitive to the test costs, sensitivity of MRI-
targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with cancer, which warrant more
empirical research. This analysis can inform the development of clinical guidelines.

Introduction
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI) is
increasingly being recommended for the diagnosis of
clinically significant (CS) prostate cancer, if the initial
biopsy proves negative [1,2]. An alternative approach is to
begin with MPMRI imaging to inform who needs a biopsy
and, in those who need it, how it might be best conducted
[3]. Recent studies have reported encouraging results on the
performance of MPMRI in detecting CS prostate cancer [3–
5]. The Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS) was the largest
accuracy study on the use of MPMRI and transrectal
ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSB) in the diagnosis of
prostate cancer [4]. Using template mapping biopsy (TPMB)
as the reference standard, it was found that MPMRI had
better sensitivity for CS prostate cancer compared with
TRUSB but worse specificity [4]. It is therefore necessary to
explore
how
best
to
combine
these
tests
and
the
consequences of incorrect diagnosis on health outcomes.
This study aims to identify the combinations of tests—
diagnostic strategies—that detect the most CS cancers per
pound spent in testing and achieve the maximum health
given their cost to the healthcare service.
2.
Patients and methods
The target population was men at risk of prostate cancer referred to
secondary care for further investigation [4,6]. The perspective was the
UK National Health Service (NHS). Costs were expressed in pound
sterling from a 2015 price base. The time horizon is the population’s
predicted lifetime. Costs incurred and health outcomes attained in the
future were discounted to present values at 3.5% per annum [7].
2.1.
Diagnostic strategies
The diagnostic strategies consisted of clinically feasible combinations of
MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, in addition to the use of TRUSB and TPMB in
isolation (Table 1; details in the Supplementary material, section 1.1).
These included strategies using MPMRI to decide whether a TRUSB or
TPMB is necessary and target the TRUSB, and strategies starting with
TRUSB and using MPMRI to decide whether a repeat biopsy is warranted.
A diagnosis of CS cancer requires a biopsy, hence strategies were defined
to always end with a confirmatory biopsy. Within each test combination,
there are alternative ways each test can be used, following the definitions
used in PROMIS (see Tables 2 and 3). Each of the 32 test combinations
were tested for the alternative classifications and cut-offs, returning a
total of 383 strategies.
2.2.
Model structure
The model had a diagnosis and a long-term component (Supplementary
Fig. 1). For diagnosis, a decision tree combined the information on
diagnostic accuracy of the tests to determine the accuracy of the test
combinations (Fig. 1). The long-term outcome component calculated the
long-term health outcomes and costs of men with CS cancer, non-CS
cancer, and no cancer, by whether they were correctly diagnosed or
missed. Their diagnosis determined their clinical management, as either
immediate radical treatment if CS cancer is diagnosed or surveillance if
not. The long-term outcome component was a cohort Markov, with two
health states for men with no cancer (alive and dead) and three states for
men with cancer: localised cancer, metastatic cancer, and death. The
decision model was developed in Microsoft Excel.
2.3.
Diagnostic performance
The model explicitly reflects the sensitivity and specificity of TRUSB and
MPMRI in detecting prostate cancer. Tables 2 and 3 show the diagnostic
performance of the tests, calculated from the individual level data
collected in the PROMIS [4] (details in the Supplementary material,
section 2). The men’s true disease status was classified in four subgroups,
according to the TPMB results and their serum prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level [1]:
1. No cancer
2. Low risk: PSA �10 ng/ml and Gleason score �6, who should be
classified as having non-CS cancer
Patient summary: We found that, under certain assumptions, the use of multiparametric
magnetic resonance imaging first and then up to two transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy
is better than the current clinical standard and is good value for money.

prior MPMRI. All TRUSB post-MPMRI are assumed to be MRI-targeted TRUSB.
Diagnostic strategies were labelled according to their test combination first
(M1–M7, N1–N7, T1–T9, P1–P9), and then their biopsy TRUSB definition (1 or
2), MPMRI definition (1 or 2), and cut-off (2 to 5). T strategies start with
TRUSB, M strategies start with MPMRI, P strategies are the same as T
strategies, and N strategies are the same as M strategies but have TPMB as
the last biopsy. For example, strategy M1 125 refers to test combination M1,
in which all men were first assessed using MPMRI definition 2 and cut-off
5 and then followed up with biopsy definition 1 for those with a suspicion of
CS cancer. See the Supplementary material, section 1, for full details on the
test sequences for each diagnostic strategy.

4. High risk: Gleason score �8, who should be classified as having CS

2.4.
Management post diagnosis
The long-term outcomes of men with cancer were based on the Prostate
Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) [8], a randomised
controlled trial comparing radical prostatectomy and watchful waiting
in men with localised prostate cancer, by risk subgroup as defined
above. The information from PIVOT was combined with that from the
STAMPEDE study (metastatic subgroup) [9] in a calibration model in
order to estimate the probability of transition between the Markov
model health states. Since the diagnostic strategies are perfectly specific,
only men with intermediate- or high-risk cancer are classified as having
CS cancer and receive treatment. Details are provided in the Supple-
mentary material, section 3.
2.5.
Health-related quality of life and costs
For health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the model considers the direct
impact of TPMB, obtained from the patient-reported EQ-5D collected in
the PROMIS [4]. TRUSB is assumed to have no impact on HRQoL given
that no effect was found in a large European screening study
[10]. Regarding costs, the model included the direct cost of the tests
and the costs associated with managing their related complications
[11,12].
In the long term, the model considers the reduction in HRQoL from
any metastatic disease [13] and ageing [14]. The model included the
direct cost of radical prostatectomy and surveillance, the costs of their
complications, and the costs of metastatic disease [8]. Details are

The diagnostic performance of MPMRI was obtained from the individual patient data of the PROMIS [4]. For interpretation of MPMRI, the definitions for CS
cancer were a radiologist estimation of (1) lesion volume �0.5 cc and/or Gleason score �4 + 3, and (2) lesion volume �0.2 cc and/or Gleason score �3
+ 4. Suspicion of a lesion meeting these definitions was scored on a Likert scale (1–5, 1 being highly likely benign and 5 being highly likely malignant). This scale
was also used to score the image for whether any cancer (whether considered CS or not) is present.

The diagnostic performance of the first TRUSB (i.e. TRUSB type 1) was obtained from the individual patient data of the PROMIS [4]. For TRUSB and TPMB, the
histological CS cancer definitions were (1) dominant Gleason pattern �4 and/or any Gleason pattern �5 and/or cancer core length �6 mm (histology definition
1) and (2) any Gleason pattern �4 and/or cancer core length �4 mm (histology definition 2). Since the PROMIS collected information on blind first TRUSB,
external evidence was used on the sensitivity of repeat TRUSB and MRI-targeted TRUSB, as either first or second TRUSB [16,22,23].

Main outcomes and measures
The main outcomes were cost effectiveness of diagnosis, defined as the
strategies that detect the most CS cancers for a given pound spent in
testing, and long-term cost effectiveness, defined as the strategies that
achieve the most health outcomes given their costs, for alternative cost-
effectiveness thresholds: £13 000 (s15 398), £20 000 (s23 689), and
£30 000 (s35 534)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained [7,15]. The
results are probabilistic in that they are the average of over 1000 Monte
Carlo simulations. A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted on
the aspects of the short- and long-term components of the model (see
the Supplementary material, section 6, for details).

3.1.1.
Detection of CS cancers per pound spend in diagnosis
Figure 2A plots the detection of CS cancers and cost of
testing for each of the 383 strategies defined (see the
Supplementary material, section 8, for details, including
costs in euro). Out of all the 383 strategies, the figure
highlights the 14 strategies that are expected to detect the
most CS cancers per pound spent in testing (red circles).
These define a frontier of valuable diagnostic options. The
remaining strategies are not expected to represent a good
value. Owing to the uncertainty around diagnostic accuracy
and costs, some of these retain the possibility of being in the
frontier, that is, of being valuable (black circles).
Four of 14 red strategies detect at least 80% of the CS
cancers: M7 223, T7 223, M7 222, and P4 2 (strategies 10–14
in Fig. 2A). In M7, all men receive MPMRI and men with a
suspicion of CS cancer receive an MRI-targeted TRUSB. Men
in whom MRI-targeted TRUSB did not detect CS cancer
receive a second MRI-targeted TRUSB. M7 223 detects 85%
(95% confidence interval [CI] 81–89%) of CS cancers and
costs £628 (95% CI £597–660); M7 222 detects 95% (95%CI
92% to 0.98%) and costs £807 (95%CI £777 to £833). This
MPMRI definition and cut-off refer to MRI-targeted TRUSB
in 96% of men: all men with high-risk CS cancer, 98% with
intermediate-risk CS cancer, 92% with low-risk non-CS
cancer, and 93% with no cancer. T7 consists of testing all
men with TRUSB, followed by MPMRI in men in whom CS
cancer was not detected, and a repeat MRI-targeted TRUSB
in men with negative TRUSB if there is a suspicion of CS
cancer at the MPMRI. T7 223 detects 91% (95% CI 86–94%) CS
cancers and costs £709 (95% CI £688–730); P4 2 consists of
TRUSB for all men and TPMB for those in whom TRUSB did
not detect CS cancer. It has perfect sensitivity but costs
£1332 (95% CI £1278–1385).

Fig. 1 – Schematic of decision tree. The diagram represents the decision tree used to predict the outcomes of the diagnostic strategies. The diagram
shows only the general structure of the tree for diagnostic strategies composed of MPMRI and TRUSB; a similar tree was used for strategies including
TPMB. In the model, men can have a sequence of up to three tests. The black lines represent the possible test classifications. The red lines with a
question mark represent decisions. Different decisions constitute different sequences of tests and hence different strategies. The diagram highlights
strategies M7 (left side) and T7 (right side). In M7, men receive MPMRI and are classified as having no suspicion of cancer (no cancer; NC), suspicion of
non-CS cancer, or suspicion of CS cancer. Men with a suspicion of CS cancer receive an MRI-targeted TRUSB, and are classified as having no cancer
(NC), non-CS cancer, and CS cancer. Men in whom CS cancer was not detected, but had a suspicion of CS cancer at the MPMRI, receive a second
MRI-targeted biopsy. In T7, men receive a TRUSB, and are classified as having no cancer (NC), non-CS cancer, and CS cancer. Men in whom CS cancer
was not detected receive an MPMRI, and are classified as having no suspicion of cancer (NC), suspicion of non-CS cancer, or suspicion of CS cancer.
Men classified as having a suspicion of CS cancer based on MPMRI results receive a second TRUSB—this time MRI-targeted TRUSB since there is now
information from the MPMRI. CS = clinically significant; MPMRI = multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; TPMB = template mapping biopsy;
TRUSB = transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.

Fig. 2 – (A) Detection of CS cancers per pound spent in diagnosis. (B) Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per NHS spend. Each bubble represents one of
the 383 diagnostic strategies evaluated; their size is directly related to the probability that the strategy is cost effective and therefore forms the
frontier (ie, forms the red line). The red bubbles represent the 14 diagnostic strategies that form the frontier at expected values. This means that, on
average, these are the best strategies per pound spent. The black bubbles represent the strategies that do not form the frontier at expected values, but
that have some probability of being in the frontier given their distribution of costs and outcomes. The grey bubbles represent the strategies that do
not form the efficiency frontier at any simulation. Given the distribution of parameter inputs, these strategies are never efficient or cost effective.

Table 4. The strategy attaining the greatest expected health
outcomes was P4 2, and the next best strategy is M7
222. The ICER of P4 2 versus M7 222 was £30 084/QALY.
Next best to M7 222 is T7 223, and the ICER of M7 222 versus
T7 223 is £7076/QALY gained, making it a cost-effective
strategy in the UK setting. These results are consistent with
the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (Supplementa-
ry Fig. 1), in which M7 222 is the strategy most likely to be
cost effective for cost-effectiveness thresholds between
£7250 and £30 000/QALY.
3.2.
Sensitivity analysis
The cost-effective strategy changed from M7 222 to T7 222,
T9 222, or P4 2 in response to a reduction in the sensitivity
of MRI-targeted TRUSB and an increase in the sensitivity of
the MRI-targeted second TRUSB. The cost-effective strategy
changes to P4 2 if the sensitivity of the MRI-targeted second
TRUSB reduces, as this does not reduce its the CS cancer
detection rates. Increases in the cost of MPMRI coupled with
reductions in the cost of TRUSB result in strategies starting
with TRUSB becoming cost effective, while reductions in the
cost of TPMB favour strategies involving TPMB for all or a
large
proportion
of
men.
The
cost-effective
strategy
changed
to
less
costly,
less
sensitive
strategies
(T7
223 and T6 222) if radical prostatectomy is less cost
effective, for example, due to reduced effectiveness, higher
HRQoL burden or greater costs. Conversely, the cost-
effective strategy changed to more sensitive strategies
(P4 2) in men incorrectly classified as no cancer has worse
health outcomes. For full results, see the Supplementary
material, section 9.

Discussion
A diagnostic strategy consisting of MPMRI first and up to two
MRI-targeted TRUSB at the more sensitive definitions
(definition 2) and cut-offs is more likely to be cost effective
at cost-effectiveness thresholds at and below £30 000. For
MPMRI, this is lesion volume �0.2 cc and/or Gleason score
�3 + 4 (likely benign or above); for TRUSB this is any Gleason
pattern �4 and/or cancer core length �4 mm. The most
clinically effective strategy is testing all men with TRUSB
at definition 2 and retesting men in whom CS cancer
was not detected with TPMB; however, this is not cost
effective at current cost-effectiveness thresholds and will
not be clinically feasible to deliver across the board in
any healthcare setting. These findings can directly inform
UK policy, but they can also be generalised to similar,
international,
settings.
The
extent
to
which
the
cost
effectiveness results can be generalised to other jurisdictions
depends on the similarities of the population, outcomes,
health systems, and pricing.

 The sensitivity of MPMRI and TRUSB depends on their
definitions and cut-offs. An MPMRI cut-off of 2 and above
refers 96% of men to biopsy, but ensures that only 2% of men
with intermediate-risk cancer and none of the men with
high-risk cancer are missed. Furthermore, it means that
most men receive a more sensitive TRUSB, since MRI-
targeted TRUSB is thought to be more sensitive than the
standard [16]. The recent guidance based on the Prostate
Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) suggests that
men with PI-RADS 1 or 2 should not be referred for biopsy
given concerns about overdiagnosis [17]. This may not be
equivalent to the cut-off recommended here, since the
PROMIS diagnostic study did not use PI-RADS, which is a
limitation. Nonetheless, higher MPMRI cut-offs, whilst
reducing the proportion of men receiving biopsy, also
reduce the proportion of CS cancers detected and treated.
This is the first study comparing all possible ways of
using MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB to diagnose CS prostate
cancer, using data from PROMIS, the largest study on
MPMRI and TRUSB [4]. A limitation of PROMIS, and of this
study, is that it did not include other tests, such as
transperineal biopsies, or the combination of additional
clinical and genetic characteristics for diagnosis and risk
stratification. This is an area for future research. Another
area for future research is the sensitivity of the first and
second MRI-targeted TRUSBs, since these parameters were
key cost-effectiveness drivers. Previous cost-effectiveness
studies compared up to two ways of using MPMRI, either
as a first test to determine which men should receive
MRI-targeted TRUSB [1,18], as MRI-targeted TRUSB for all
men [1], or for men with previous negative biopsy
[19]. For these reasons, this study is the most comprehen-
sive cost-effectiveness
analysis to date of alternative
diagnostic strategies for prostate cancer.
The appropriate MPMRI cut-off, and ultimately the
optimal diagnostic strategy, depends on the cost effective-
ness of early diagnosis and treatment. Although this study
did not include radiotherapy, it tested the impact of changes
on the cost effectiveness of treatment. If cost effectiveness
of radiotherapy is similar to or more favourable than that of
radical prostatectomy, highly sensitive strategies such as
M7 222 are cost effective. Highly sensitive diagnostic
strategies may not be cost effective if radical treatment is
not as cost effective in the manner modelled here. The cost
effectiveness of treatment is less favourable if (1) treatment
is less effective, (2) it impacts negatively on HRQoL, or (3)
it is costlier than that assumed for this study.
Management of men classified as having no cancer or
non-CS cancer also has an impact on the scope for
investment in diagnosis. More sensitive monitoring proto-
cols improve the cost effectiveness of less sensitive and less
costly diagnostic strategies. There is a dearth of evidence on
the effectiveness of repeated testing protocols, which
constitutes an important limitation of the current evidence
base in support of policy, and meant that these analyses
could not formally evaluate the use of such protocols.
In order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of diagnostic
tests, evidence is required on the long-term outcomes of
patients who are correctly diagnosed and those who are
misclassified, given their true disease status. The extensive
literature searches conducted for this study did not identify
evidence on the outcomes of patients and the effectiveness
of treatments when true disease status is known (eg, using
TPMB to identify and risk stratify patients). The existing
studies used TRUSB to diagnose and risk stratify patients
[8,20,21]; hence, some individuals may have been under-
diagnosed. As a consequence, their long-term quality-
adjusted survival may have been overestimated, and the
cost effectiveness of treatment may have been under-
estimated. This issue can only be resolved with better-
quality evidence on the outcomes of men with prostate
cancer, based on a perfect test such as TPMB for their
diagnosis and classification.

Conclusions
MPMRI is cost effective as the first test for the diagnosis of
prostate cancer, when followed by an MRI-targeted TRUSB
in men in whom the MPMRI suggests a suspicion for CS
cancer, and a second TRUSB if no CS cancer is found, under
the most sensitive CS cancer definitions and cut-offs. These
findings are sensitive to the cost of each test, sensitivity of
MRI-targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with
cancer, which warrant more empirical research.
