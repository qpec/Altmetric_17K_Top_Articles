Summary
Background Controversy exists about the diff
 erences in air pollution exposure and inhalation dose between mode of 
transport. We aimed to review air pollution exposure and inhaled dose according to mode of transport and pollutant 
 
and their eff
 ect in terms of years of life expectancy (YLE).
Methods In this systematic review, we searched ten online databases from inception to April 13, 2016, without 
language or temporal restrictions, for cohort, cross-sectional, and experimental studies that compared exposure to 
carbon monoxide, black carbon, nitrogen dioxide, and fi
 ne and coarse particles in active commuters (pedestrian or 
cyclist) and commuters using motorised transport (car, motorcycle, bus, or massive motorised transport [MMT—
ie, train, subway, or metro]). We excluded studies that measured air pollution exposure exclusively with biomarkers or 
on the basis of simulated data, reviews, comments, consensuses, editorials, guidelines, in-vitro studies, meta-analyses, 
ecological studies, and protocols. We extracted average exposure and commuting time per mode of transport and 
pollutant to calculate inhaled doses. We calculated exposure and inhaled dose ratios using active commuters as the 
reference and summarised them with medians and IQRs. We also calculated diff
 erences in YLE due to fi
 ne particle 
inhaled dose and physical activity.
Findings We identifi
 ed 4037 studies, of which 39 were included in the systematic review. Overall, car commuters had 
higher exposure to all pollutants than did active commuters in 30 (71%) of 42 comparisons (median ratio 1·22 
[IQR 0·90–1·76]), followed by those who commuted by bus in 57 (52%) of 109 (1·0 [0·79–1·41]), by motorcycle in 
16 (50%) of 32 (0·99 [0·86–1·38]), by a car with controlled ventilation settings in 39 (45%) of 86 (0·95 [0·66–1·54]), 
and by MMT in 21 (38%) of 55 (0·67 [0·49–1·13]). Overall, active commuters had higher inhalation doses than did 
commuters using motorised transport (median ratio car with controlled ventilation settings 0·16 [0·10–0·28]; car 
0·22 [0·15–0·30]; motorcycle 0·38 [0·26–0·78]; MMT 0·49 [0·34–0·81]; bus 0·72 [IQR 0·50–0·99]). Commuters 
using motorised transport lost up to 1 year in YLE more than did cyclists.
Interpretation Proximity to traffi
  c and high air interchange increased the exposure to air pollution of commuters 
using motorised transport. Larger inhalation rates and commuting time increased inhaled dose among active 
commuters. Benefi
 ts of active commuting from physical activity are larger than the risk from an increased inhaled 
dose of fi
 ne particles.

Levels of ambient air pollution according to mode of 
transport: a systematic review
Introduction
Worldwide, air pollution exposure is a public health issue 
associated with various health eff
 ects, including cardio-
vascular and respiratory disease, cancer, pregnancy 
complications, and adverse birth outcomes.1 Air pollution 
exposure can be considered a function of the concentration 
of pollutants in a microenvironment and the time spent 
by individuals in that microenvironment.2 Traffi
  c 
emissions contribute the major part of air pollution 
in traffi
  c-related microenvironments.3 Commuters are 
exposed to high levels of pollutants,4 which often do not 
meet air quality standards.
Findings from two previous systematic reviews5,6 
suggested that commuters using motorised transport 
 
(ie, private or public car, train, metro, tram, bus, or 
subway) have a higher exposure to air pollution than do 
active commuters (ie, pedestrian or cyclist). However, 
if the higher breathing parameters and trip time of an 
active commute than of a motorised commute are 
considered, inhaled and deposited doses of pollutants 
become higher among cyclists and pedestrians than 
among commuters using motorised transport.7–10 
Authors of a systematic review11 of health impact 
assessment studies concluded that consensus exists that 
despite the increased health risks associated with the 
higher inhaled dose of traffi
  c-related pollutants among 
active commuters than among commuters using 
motorised transport, the benefi
 ts of physical activity 
from active commuting remain larger. Nevertheless, 
to our knowledge, no previous review of a modal 
comparison of air pollution exposure has systematically 
addressed the diff
 erences in inhaled dose of pollutant

per mode of transport or the diff
 erential eff
 ect on years 
of life expectancy (YLE).
Therefore, we aimed to systematically review studies 
that compared air pollution exposure by mode of transport 
to examine diff
 erences in inhaled dose according to mode 
of transport and pollutant. Furthermore, we estimated 
the trade-off
  in YLE while taking into account the inhaled 
dose of fi
 ne particles and physical activity levels according 
to transportation.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In this systematic review, we searched ten databases 
(Embase, MEDLINE, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library, 
Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, 
ProQuest, and Scielo) in cooperation with a medical 
information specialist (WMB) to identify relevant studies 
that compared air pollution exposure between mode of 
transport among adult commuters from inception to 
April 13, 2016, with no language or temporal restrictions. 
We combined terms related to air pollution (eg, “air 
pollution”) or specifi
 c air pollutants (eg, “PM10”, “PM2·5”, 
or “CO”) with terms related to mode of transport 
(eg, “traffi
  c”, “subway”, “car”, “bicycle”, or “walk”). Full 
search strategies are provided in the appendix.
We included all studies (cohort, cross-sectional, and 
experimental) that measured personal air pollution 
exposure while commuting by at least one active and 
one motorised mode of transport. We excluded studies 
that measured air pollution exposure exclusively 
with biomarkers or on the basis of simulated data, 
reviews, comments, consensuses, editorials, guide-
lines, in-vitro studies, meta-analyses, ecological 
studies, and protocols. We selected data only for 
carbon monox 
ide (CO), black carbon (BC), nitrogen 
dioxide (NO₂), fi
 ne (particulate matter of <2·5 μm) and 
coarse (particulate matter of 2·5–10 μm) particles, and 
six modes of transport: walking, cycling, bus, massive 
motorised transport (MMT—ie, subway, metro, and 
train), car (private or public), and motorcycle 
(motorcycle, scooter, and auto rickshaw). We stratifi
 ed 
cars into two categories: cars that had controlled

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a systematic review of reviews published 
before June 18, 2014, without language or temporal restrictions. 
We used combinations of keywords related to “mode of 
transport” and “air pollution”. We searched in Embase, 
MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Web of science, Scopus, and 
PubMed. We found 1887 references, among which we found 
three reviews. A non-systematic review published in 2007 
addressed the evidence for the determinants of exposure to 
carbon monoxide and fi
 ne particles according to mode of 
transport. Additionally, a systematic review published in 2014 
included only studies done in Europe of exposure in four modes 
of transport: car, bicycle, bus, and subway. On the basis of these 
two reviews, car, bus, and subway commuters have higher 
exposure than do cyclists and pedestrians to particulate matter, 
carbon monoxide, and black carbon. However, these reviews did 
not address the eff
 ect on the inhalation dose of the increased 
respiratory parameters among active commuters. Another 
non-systematic review published in 2010 assessed if the benefi
 ts 
of the modal shift from motorised to bicycle commuting 
outweigh the associated risks. Despite cyclists having increased 
inhaled doses of pollutants and a high risk of traffi
  c injuries, 
these risks were found to be outweighed by the benefi
 ts of 
increased physical activity, by contrast with commuters using 
motorised transport. These fi
 ndings were consistently supported 
by a systematic review published in 2016 that included studies 
that addressed the balance of the health risks and benefi
 ts of 
active commuting through health impact assessment. 
Added value of this study
Through a rigorous and comprehensive systematic review, 
we have addressed the evidence that compared air pollution 
exposure according to mode of transport. We provide 
estimations of the diff
 erences in exposure, but also in inhaled 
dose, which was not systematically addressed in previous 
reviews. We also calculated the potential trade-off
  in years of 
life expectancy (YLE) using fi
 ne particle exposure levels 
purposely measured to compare between mode of transport 
at specifi
 c study settings. We compared the eff
 ect on YLE of 
inhaled dose of pollutants, by contrast with physical activity 
levels, per mode of transport. We have addressed 
heterogeneity between studies by calculating ratios of 
exposure and inhaled dose within each study. Also, 
heterogeneity in YLE eff
 ect estimates was reduced by use of 
standard assumptions to calculate inhaled pollutant doses and 
levels of physical activity. Our study addresses transport 
microenvironments that were not consistently addressed in 
previous evidence, like motorcyclists and pedestrians. We also 
account for heterogeneous settings by including Asian and 
West Pacifi
 c cities 
Implications of all the available evidence
The trade-off
  in health outcomes according to mode of 
transport depends largely on local context attributes. However, 
consensus exists that despite the harmful eff
 ects of air pollution 
exposure, physical activity from active commuting provides 
more gains in health outcomes than air pollution exposure 
provides losses. More research is required to account for other 
long-term and short-term risk factors associated with traffi
  c. 
To stimulate a shift from motorised to active and public 
transport, policies should address traffi
  c-related pollution of 
commuters’ microenvironments. Large societal benefi
 ts can be 
obtained from environments that increase active and public 
transport commuting.

ventilation settings (windows closed, air conditioning 
on or off
 , or air recirculation modes on or off
 ) and 
those without controlled ventilation settings.
Working in pairs, three authors (MC, CMK, and KD) 
reviewed titles and abstracts of the entire list of studies 
identifi
 ed by the search to select those that fulfi
 lled the 
selection criteria. After initial appraisal, we retrieved full 
texts of selected titles. Full texts were appraised 
independently by two authors (MC and RF-P) to select 
those that fulfi
 lled the selection criteria. Disagreements 
were solved through discussion and with consultation 
with a third independent author (OHF). We reviewed 
reference lists of the retrieved articles and previous 
systematic reviews for additional publications. We 
contacted experts in the fi
 eld to identify additional 
references that should be considered. Selection criteria 
and study selection procedures, data extraction, and 
quality assessment are described in detail in the 
appendix. The study protocol is available online.
Data analysis
We registered extracted data from each article in 
a purposely designed form, including for study design, 
measurement period, mode of transport, monitoring 
device, commuting time, and number of measurements. 
We extracted summary and dispersion measurements of 
exposure according to mode of transport and pollutant. 
If available, we extracted summary measurements 
stratifi
 ed by season, day, period of monitoring, type of 
route, and city. If more than one summary measurement 
was reported for the same stratum, we preferably 
extracted arithmetic means, then geometric means, and, 
fi
 nally, medians. We extracted summary measurements 
of inhalation and uptake dose (per h or trip), the model, 
and the parameters used for the estimation. We used the 
most complete report when multiple papers of the same 
study were available. We addressed quality of the studies 
in terms of the comparability of the exposure measured 
between mode of transport (ie, time and route standards), 
external validity (ie, background and meteorological 
conditions and commuting standards), measurement 
standardisation, and data reporting. We used a modifi
 ed 
version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing the 
quality of observational studies (appendix). 
To uniformly summarise the exposure data extracted, 
we standardised the units of concentrations by applying 
standard conversion factors.12 We calculated the median 
and IQR of averages of exposure concentration per mode 
of transport and pollutant and the percentage of 
exposure averages above the European Union ambient 
air quality standards13 (except for BC because no standard 
has been defi
 ned). Within each study, we calculated the 
exposure ratio according to mode of transport using 
cyclists’ exposure as the reference. We summarised 
exposure ratios as medians and IQRs per mode of 
transport and pollutant and calculated the percentages 
of ratios above 1. Also, we meta-analysed exposure ratios 
using random-eff
 ects models.14 We assessed hetero-
geneity with I².15 We assessed variability within studies 
by estimating the SE from the variance for ratios of the 
mean.14 We visually inspected publication bias with 
funnel plots and used Egger’s tests to assess asymmetry. 
All tests were two-tailed and we considered p values 
of 0·05 or less signifi
 cant. For 13 studies that did not 
include cyclists, we used pedestrians’ exposure as the 
reference (reported separately to the studies that 
included cyclists). For two additional studies, we used 
pedestrians’ exposure as the reference because for some 
comparisons in these studies only comparisons with 
pedestrians were possible.
We calculated inhaled doses of pollutants (in-
haled amount per trip) as the average exposure 
concen 
tration (reported by authors) multiplied by minute 
ventilation (m³/h) multiplied by trip time (min; reported 
by authors) multiplied by a conversion factor, if applicable. 
We used minute ventilation as suggested by the 
US Environmental Protection Agency16 for each mode of

transport (appendix). Then, we calculated the inhalation 
dose ratio between mode of transport using the inhaled 
dose of cyclists (or pedestrians, accordingly) as the 
reference. We summarised ratios as medians and IQRs. 
Finally, we estimated the trade-off
  in YLE due to fi
 ne 
particle inhaled dose and physical activity, according to 
mode of transport. We used fi
 ne particles because it has 
the most consistent evidence for all-cause mortality risk.17 
We calculated the loss or gain of YLE due to fi
 ne particle 
inhaled dose and physical activity levels for a person 
commuting by a given mode of transport. We based 
calculations on fi
 ne particle exposure and a set of 
assumptions regarding weekly levels of physical activity 
per mode of transport (appendix). We built the assumptions 
for a given scenario where one hypothetical person spends 
7 days in four microenvironments: at work, at home, 
sleeping, and commuting by one of the modes of transport 
over a 7 km route twice a day. We did a sensitivity analysis

calculated the net gains or losses by comparing each mode 
of transport to a reference scenario (cyclists or pedestrians,

excluded three duplicate studies from the systematic 
review but included them in the table of study 
characteristics). The studies were done in European 
(n=24), west Pacifi
 c (n=11), American (n=3), and 
southeast Asian (n=1) countries. Further characteristics 
are provided in the appendix.
Irrespective of pollutant, car commuters had higher air 
pollution exposure than did active commuters in 30 (71%) 
of 42 comparisons (median 1·22 [IQR 0·90–1·76]), 
followed by those who commuted by bus in 57 (52%) 
of 109 (1·0 [0·79–1·41]), by motorcycle in 16 (50%) 
of 32 (0·99 [0·86–1·38]), by a car with controlled 
ventilation settings in 39 (45%) of 86 (0·95 [0·66–1·54]), 
and by MMT in 21 (38%) of 55 (0·67 [0·49–1·13]). 
We observed diff
 erences in exposure ratio per mode of 
transport and pollutant (fi
 gure 2). We obtained similar 
estimations by meta-analysing the exposure ratios, but 
we identifi
 ed a large heterogeneity (higher than 90% in 
most comparisons; appendix). We did not fi
 nd evidence 
of publication bias (appendix).
Inhalation or uptake pollutant dose was available in 
12 of the studies included in the systematic review 
(appendix). Cyclists followed by pedestrians had the 
highest uptake dose of pollutants. Minute ventilation as 
a breathing parameter was heterogeneous across 
studies. Five studies7,9,10,25,55 used surrogates of activity 
intensity to derive minute ventilation, whereas the 
remaining studies8,26,28,37,41,46,51 used published parameters. 
In Figure 3, we compare the distribution of exposure 
and inhaled dose ratios on the basis of our calculation of 
inhalation dose. For all motorised modes of transport, 
the median of the inhaled dose ratio was lower than the 
exposure ratio. Active commuters had a higher 
inhalation dose of pollutants than did commuters who 
used motorised transport (median ratio car with 
controlled ventilation settings 0·16 [IQR 0·10–0·28]; car 
0·22 [0·15–0·30]; motorcycle 0·38 [0·26–0·78]); MMT 
0·49 [0·34–0·81]; bus 0·72 [0·50–0·99]) due to increased 
respiratory parameters. A ratio of inhaled dose lower 
than the ratio of exposure, with respect to the y axis, 
suggests that the relative inhaled dose of pollutant 
among cyclists, in the denominator, is higher than their 
relative exposure. We observed small diff
 erences 
between exposure and inhaled dose ratios for the 
comparison of pedestrians with cyclists.
Figure 4 shows the diff
 erence in YLE due to fi
 ne 
particle exposure and physical activity per mode of 
transport. Median losses in YLE were up to 1 year larger 
among commuters using motorised transport than 
among cyclists because of less physical activity, despite 
the lower inhaled dose of fi
 ne particles (appendix). Losses 
were larger among people commuting by car, by a car 
with controlled ventilation settings, and by motorcycle 
than among bus and MMT commuters because of the 
active stages attributed to public transport commuters. 
Losses of commuters using motorised transport 
compared with pedestrians were larger than of those 
using motorised transport compared with cyclists 
because of the longer commuting time of pedestrians 
than of cyclists. In a sensitivity analysis, we tested varying 
commuting times and consistently observed YLE gains 
in favour of active transport (appendix), as the diff
 erence 
between life-years lost due to fi
 ne particle exposure and 
life-years gained due to physical activity remained 
roughly the same for a 3·5 km route as for a 7 km route 
with the relative risk of physical activity of 0·8056 (age 
20–30 years: median –1·50 years [IQR –1·69 to –1·08]; 
age 40–64 years: –1·26 [–1·44 to –0·77]; age ≥65 years: 
–0·59 [–0·82 to –0·26]).
Regarding quality of studies, comparability of exposure 
between mode of transport was high (at least three 
stars according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) in 
16 experimental studies (appendix). We noted a very low 
comparability in 13 experimental studies (two or fewer 
stars). Ten studies were observational, which aimed to 
measure rather than compare exposure between mode 
of transport. Irrespective of pollutant, exposure levels to 
CO, NO₂, and fi
 ne and coarse particles were above 
ambient air quality standards13 among cyclists in 
50 (56%) of 89 exposure averages, among pedestrians 
in 22 (46%) of 48, among those who commuted by car in 
22 (55%) of 40, among those who commuted by a car 
with controlled ventilation settings in 45 (52%) of 87, 
among those who commuted by MMT in 25 (48%) of 52, 
and among those who commuted by motorcycle in 
24 (65%) of 37
. The distribution of pollutant exposure 
level per mode of transport is shown in the appendix. 
Fine particles were more frequently above ambient air 
quality standards than were the other pollutants 
(155 [83%]) of 187 exposure averages). Detailed 
information about ascertainment of air pollution 
exposure was provided in 33 (85%) studies. Sample size 
or dispersion measure 
ments were not reported in four 
(10%) studies. Complete reporting of background and 
meteorological conditions was found in 21 (54%) studies. 
Standardisation of all modes of transport measured and 
reporting of it was found in 20 (51%) studies.
Discussion
Car and bus commuters had the highest levels of air 
pollution exposure, followed by those commuting by a 
car with controlled ventilation settings, cyclists, and 
pedestrians, whereas the lowest was experienced by MMT 
commuters and motorcylists. Cyclists, followed by 
pedestrians, had the highest inhalation and uptake dose 
of pollutants because of increased minute ventilation and 
trip time. Compared with people commuting by car, by a 
car with controlled ventilation settings, and by motor-
cycle, the negative eff
 ect on YLE of increased inhaled dose 
did not overcome the positive eff
 ect of physical activity 
when commuting actively. Commuter exposure can be 
reduced by increasing the distance from traffi
  c emissions, 
reducing air exchange with use of ventilation settings in 
motorised mode of transport, and choice of routes with

low emissions and high dispersion of pollutants 
(eg, parks), as well as eff
 orts to reduce local and regional 
emissions. We observed a large heterogeneity across the 
evidence. Further research should consider inhaled and 
uptake dose while commuting to address air pollution 
eff
 ects on health. 
In agreement with previous systematic reviews,5,6 the 
diff
 erences in air pollution exposure between mode of 
transport in this study can be explained mainly by the 
position of the commuter with respect to the gradient of 
pollutant concentration8,18,20,25,28,38,41,49 and the commuter’s 
microenvironment sensitivity to surrounding pollutant 
concentration. The gradient of pollutant concentration 
depends on the rate of emissions and the dispersion and 
decay of pollutants in the air,1,57 which is infl
 uenced, among 
others, by meteorological58,59 and route25,39,41 attributes. The 
close contact of commuters using motorised transport to 
the traffi
  c line explains their higher levels of air pollution 
exposure than those for active commuters.5,6,46 Indeed, bus 
commuters and cyclists have lower exposure when they 
travel via separated bus lanes or cycle routes or travel close 
to kerb than when they do not.2,5,25,38,46 Also, pedestrians, 
who usually travel on the pavement, have a lower exposure 
than do cyclists.6,38 We observed the lowest exposure among 
MMT commuters, except for exposure to BC, most 
probably because they often travel on railways or through 
tunnels separated from ground traffi
  c.26 The main sources 
of exposure for MMT commuters involve walking stages, 
when approaching the stations,49 and while waiting inside 
the stations.5,41,53 Commuters using ground motorised 
transport (ie, car and bus) on overcongested routes with 
high emission levels had high pollutant exposure because 
of high emissions, long trip time, and frequent idling.5,6,37 
Additionally, canyon-like street confi
 guration reduces the 
dispersive and catalytic action of environmental and 
meteorological factors, thus trapping the pollutants.8,31,41
Commuters’ microenvironment sensitivity to surr 
ound-
ing pollutants depends on the rate of air interchange of the 
microenvironment. Active commuters, and commuters 
using motorised transport with open windows, have a high 
rate of air interchange, increasing their exposure to high 
pollutant concen 
trations41,36,53 and pollutant hotspots like 
intersections and traffi
  c lights.26,36,41,45,54,59 This leads to 
a pattern of concentration peaks in active commuters’ 
exposure, whereas commuters using motorised transport 
have a constant concentration exposure. Physical barriers 
like controlled ventilation settings in cars help to extract 
and fi
 lter fi
 ne and coarse particles from the vehicle 
microenvironment.22,36,48,53 Moreover, physical barriers make 
a large diff
 erence in highly contaminated environments,37

where both commuters using motorised transport and 
active commuters have similar exposure levels to fi
 ne and 
coarse particles.22,35,37 Nevertheless, people commuting with 
a car with controlled ventilation settings had an increased 
exposure to CO,10,29,37,38,46,48 attributed to self-pollution due to 
fi
 ltration of surrounding emissions and products from 
engine combustion.
Commuters’ microenvironment sensitivity to traffi
  c-
related air pollution is largely determined by built 
environment attributes that increase their proximity to 
traffi
  c emissions, by an absence of physical barriers like 
ventilation settings, and by increased respiratory para-
meters leading to increased airway deposition of pollutants. 
Therefore, active commuters might benefi
 t from air 
pollution forecasting and on-road advice to actively protect 
themselves from exposure—eg, by choosing uncongested 
routes. Incentives to shift from private motorised to active 
and public transport should be accompanied by urban 
planning standards and policies, such as dedicated lanes, 
separated cycle routes and pavements, improved 
ventilation in vehicles and at stops and stations for public 
transport, a boosted transition to environmentally friendly 
vehicles, and other eff
 orts aimed to reduce both combustive 
and non-combustive traffi
  c-related emissions.3 Moreover, 
large societal benefi
 ts are obtained from an active 
commuter-friendly environment, which aff
 ects additional 
traffi
  c-related risk factors, like noise, traffi
  c injuries, quality 
of life, and social cohesion, among others.60,61
By contrast with overall exposure, the inhaled dose of 
pollutants was higher among active commuters than 
among commuters using motorised transport. This 
fi
 nding is mainly explained by the increased minute 
ventilation, leading to increased air volume and frequency 
of breathing, deeper inhalation, and larger inhalation of 
pollutants in active commuters than in commuters using 
motorised transport.7 Active commuters, especially 
pedestrians, also have a longer trip time than do 
commuters using motorised transport and thereby have 
increased exposure time.7,8,22,37,55
In agreement with previous studies,11 the large losses in 
YLE among commuters using motorised transport due 
to less physical activity than in active commuters were 
not off
 set by the modest gains due to lower inhaled fi
 ne 
particles. YLE losses of commuting by car, by a car with 
controlled ventilation settings, and by motorcycle were 
larger than were the losses observed among public 
transport commuters (bus and MMT). This fi
 nding can 
be explained by the contribution of physical activity 
during the active stages of the trip, like when approaching 
stations or stops, despite additional sources of air 
pollution inhalation.9,25,55,62 
To our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst systematic 
review of air pollution exposure and inhaled dose 
according to mode of transport. Our fi
 ndings are in 
agreement with the systematic review by Mueller and 
colleagues,11 which included 30 studies that assessed the 
net health benefi
 ts of active transport through health 
impact assessment, 17 of which addressed the negative 
eff
 ect of air pollution exposure. Nevertheless, none of the 
studies included by Mueller and colleagues11 were 
included in our study as they did not comply with our 
selection criteria and research question. Also, all but one 
study analysed by Mueller and colleagues11 were done 
with data from European countries, the USA, 
New Zealand, and Australia, with mostly indirect air 
pollution exposure levels, and with heterogeneous 
assumptions and modelling frameworks. By contrast, 
we used fi
 ne particle exposure levels purposely measured 
for modal comparison in 23 studies and applied standard 
assumptions for inhaled and physical activity doses. 
Also, because of our selection criteria, we included 
further settings, also adding Asian and west Pacifi
 c cities, 
with higher ambient air pollution than in the USA and 
most European countries. Under very high air pollution 
concentrations, the trade-off
  between air pollution 
exposure risks and active transport benefi
 ts has been 
suggested to not benefi
 t active transport anymore.63 Yet, 
our fi
 ndings are consistently in favour of active transport. 
Limitations of our analyses deserve attention. First, the 
external validity of the studies included in this report was 
aff
 ected by the heterogeneity of settings and methodological 
approaches. Nevertheless, on the basis of the observed 
heterogeneity, this systematic review encompasses various 
environmental conditions and makes our fi
 ndings 
generalisable. Second, despite our comprehensive search, 
only eight studies were done in countries other than 
European and North American countries (China,37,41,53,54 
India,34 Taiwan,42 Vietnam,48 and Chile49). Although we did 
not fi
 nd evidence of publication bias, these regions are 
under-represented in our review. Third, we did not take 
into account the additional toxicity of other pollutants. 
However, fi
 ne particle levels are a strong marker of traffi
  c-
related air pollution, and we found that fi
 ne particles were 
more frequently above ambient air quality standards than 
were the other pollutants. Fourth, we assumed a rather 
unlikely scenario of pedestrians commuting daily for 
longer than 2 h. Walking is an important source of physical 
activity, and a large proportion of active commuters are 
pedestrians.64 With a sensitivity analysis, we tested varying 
commuting times and consistently observed YLE gains in 
favour of active transport. Fifth, we focused on the long-
term mortality eff
 ect of physical activity and fi
 ne particle 
exposure. However, examination of other short-term and 
long-term health eff
 ects would be benefi
 cial, as well as 
other exposures, like noise and traffi
  c injuries. Findings 
from previous studies suggest that regardless of the 
expected increment of traffi
  c injuries along the shift from 
motorised to active commuting, the reduction in motorised 
traffi
  c volume and the increment of an active commuter-
friendly environment would contribute to a reduction of 
the burden of traffi
  c incidents.11 Finally, we assumed a total 
replacement of mode of transport at each scenario 
modelled and a linear association of fi
 ne particle exposure 
and physical activity with mortality, by contrast with

previous fi
 ndings.11,60,56 However, our approximation is 
intended to build on previous eff
 orts to summarise air 
pollution exposure according to mode of transport to 
examine the eff
 ect of commuting parameters on inhaled 
doses and potential population-level eff
 ects. Health 
benefi
 ts strongly depend on specifi
 c local attributes,11,60 
such as the off
 er of mode of transport, apportionment of 
emissions, and built environment attributes, besides local 
policies and normative behaviour. Decision making based 
on health impact assessment should take into account 
such local attributes.
