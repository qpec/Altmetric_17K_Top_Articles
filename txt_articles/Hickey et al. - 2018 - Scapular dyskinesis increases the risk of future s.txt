background It is unclear whether the presence of 
scapular dyskinesis increases the risk of developing 
shoulder pain in asymptomatic athletes.
Objectives To determine whether the presence of 
scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic athletes increases 
the risk of developing shoulder pain by systematic review 
and meta-analysis.
Methods A systematic search was conducted in the 
Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index 
to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and 
Complementary Medicine Database and SPORTDiscus. 
Prospective studies that assessed athletes for scapular 
dyskinesis and recorded incidents of shoulder pain were 
included. Study quality was assessed using the Downs 
and Black checklist. Meta-analysis was conducted to 
derive a pooled risk ratio (RR) for the development 
of shoulder pain in athletes with scapular dyskinesis 
compared with those without scapular dyskinesis.
results Five studies were included with a total of 
419 athletes. Of the athletes with scapular dyskinesis, 
35% (56/160) experienced shoulder pain during the 
follow-up, whereas 25% (65/259) of athletes without 
scapular dyskinesis experienced symptoms. The presence 
of scapular dyskinesis at baseline indicated a 43% 
increased risk of a shoulder pain event over a 9 to 24 
months follow-up (RR=1.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.93).
conclusions Athletes with scapular dyskinesis have 
43% greater risk of developing shoulder pain than those 
without scapular dyskinesis.
IntrOductIOn
Racket and overhead sports require substantial 
kinetic energy transference through the shoulder at 
rapid speeds through large ranges of motion with 
high precision.1 2 These demands may explain the 
high prevalence of shoulder pain in these popula-
tions, with reports of 12% in amateur golf,3 16% in 
volleyball,4 22% to 36%% in elite handball4 5 and 
24% in high-level adolescent tennis, which increases 
to 50% in middle-aged tennis players.6 Even higher 
is the prevalence of shoulder pain in swimmers, 
ranging between 40% and 91%.7 In collision 
sports such as rugby and American football, 6.7% 
and 15.2% of all injuries involve the shoulder.8 9 
These collision sport statistics are not inclusive of 
non-traumatic sources of shoulder pain, and may 
under-represent the true prevalence of all shoulder 
pain in these populations.10
The traditional approach to understanding the 
mechanisms of shoulder pain has involved specific 
anatomical diagnostic labels. The validity of using 
specific anatomical diagnostic labels has been chal-
lenged extensively, particularly regarding non-acute 
shoulder pain.11–13 Clinical features of specific 
anatomical diagnoses, such as reduced external 
rotation or an external rotation lag, indicative of 
frozen shoulder and rotator cuff tear, respectively, 
are inconsistent predictors of outcome.14 Specific 
anatomical diagnostic labels provide limited clin-
ical guidance in patient management or estimating 
prognosis.15 For these reasons, experts are calling 
for a paradigm shift away from these labels and 
encouraging identifying modifiable risk factors 
associated with onset of shoulder pain or that influ-
ence prognosis, such as abnormal motor patterns or 
movement impairments.16
One potential risk factor for shoulder pain is scap-
ular dyskinesis. Scapular dyskinesis refers to altered 
position and motion of the scapula.1 Scapular dyski-
nesis may reduce subacromial space,17 although the 
evidence for this is mixed.18 Scapular dyskinesis can 
also reduce rotator cuff strength,19 20 increase the 
strain within the rotator cuff and promote apop-
totic changes in tenocytes within the rotator cuff 
tendons.1 Rotator cuff weakness may impair motor 
control, resulting in superior translation of the 
humeral head and further mechanical abrasion of 
the structures of the subacromial space.21 Despite 
these plausible mechanisms that may cause shoulder 
pain, clinical evidence to support these hypotheses 
remains limited.
Scapular dyskinesis has been associated with 
shoulder pain, specifically shoulder impingement 
syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and 
multidirectional impairments.1 22 The cross-sec-
tional nature of the studies in previous reviews 
means one cannot determine whether scapular 
dyskinesis contributed to the development of 
shoulder pain or whether it arose subsequent to 
shoulder pain. Scapular dyskinesis is highly prev-
alent in the asymptomatic general population23 
and substantially higher in overhead athletes.23 It 
remains unclear if dyskinesis is a sports-specific 
adoption that is potentially beneficial for maximal 
performance and protective against injury. Alterna-
tively, it may be a risk factor that identifies athletes 
at greater risk of injury, requiring a preventative 
intervention. T
wo prospective studies attempted 
to identify whether scapular dyskinesis in asymp-
tomatic athletes increased their risk of developing 
shoulder pain and results were mixed.24 25 There-
fore, we aimed to systematically review whether 
the presence of scapular dyskinesis in asymptom-
atic athletes increased the risk of developing future 
shoulder pain.

shoulder pain by 43% in asymptomatic athletes: a

MethOds
search strategy
This review has been registered in the PROSPERO database 
(CRD42016046247) and conducted according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines.26
The following databases were used for searching existing liter-
ature (from their inception to August 2016): Cochrane Library, 
Embase (via Ovid), PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (via Elton B Stephens Co (EBSCO)), Allied 
and Complementary Medicine Database (via Ovid) and SPORT-
Discus (via EBSCO). The full Embase search strategy is outlined 
in online supplementary appendix 1 and was adapted for the other 
databases. The reference lists of the included studies were checked 
for additional studies that were not identified with the database 
search. T
o identify recent research that was not yet published, a 
hand search was undertaken of abstracts presented at conferences 
(last 3 
years) of; the Australian Physiotherapy Association, Sports 
Medicine Australia and American College of Sports Medicine.
study selection
The search was conducted by two authors (DH, VS). Articles 
were exported to EndNote,27 and duplicates removed. The 
remaining articles were exported into Covidence,28 where the 
same two authors independently screened titles and abstracts 
to determine their eligibility based on the criteria outlined in 
table 1. Once agreement was reached, the full text of each article 
was reviewed to determine their inclusion or exclusion. Disagree-
ments between the review authors (DH, VS) were resolved by 
discussion with a third review author (LM).
data extraction
T
wo authors (DH, VS) independently extracted data of the 
included studies using a standardised form. Disagreements were 
resolved through discussion with a third review author (LM). 
Participants were classified according to whether scapular dyski-
nesis was observed at the initial assessment, and whether they 
had shoulder pain during the follow-up. Where only continuous 
data for measurements of scapular position were present, the 
authors were contacted to investigate if the data could be dichot-
omised, that is, categorised into with or without scapular dyski-
nesis. Where this was not possible, the studies were excluded. 
Authors were also contacted where there were missing data or 
where only partial data met the inclusion criteria, for example if 
some of the included population had shoulder pain at baseline 
or were non-athletic. The characteristics of the included studies, 
such as number of participants, patient characteristics and 
sporting participation, outcomes, findings and major strengths 
and weaknesses, were extracted.
Quality assessment
The included studies were assessed for methodological quality 
using the Downs and Black Checklist.29 The Downs and 
Black Checklist is recommended in the Cochrane Handbook 
for appraisal of non-randomised studies.30 It contains 27 yes/
no questions, with a total maximum score of 30. The score is 
distributed over five sections: Study quality, external validity, 
study bias, confounding and selection bias and power of the 
study. Question 4, 8, 14, 19, 23, 24 and 27 were not applicable 
to prospective study designs, and were therefore excluded. This 
was based on the recommendations of a previous systemic review 
investigating risk factors using prospective study designs.31 The 
modified checklist had a maximum score of 20.
Outcome measures
The main outcome of this review was shoulder pain recorded via 
any questionnaire, scale or tool that detected the dichotomised 
outcome of ‘shoulder pain’ or ‘no shoulder pain’ during the 
follow-up period. The outcome measures identified as accept-
able measures of shoulder pain were the Visual Analogue Scale, 
the Numerical Rating Scale, the Shoulder Pain and Disability 
Index, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, Shoulder 
Disability Questionnaire, direct questioning, direct report to 
medical professionals and any other valid outcome measure of 
shoulder disability and/or pain. Visual observation, 3-D analysis 
of scapular position or use of any other measurement tool to 
determine the presence of scapular dyskinesis was accepted, as 
long as the data could be dichotomised as ‘scapular dyskinesis’ 
or ‘no scapular dyskinesis’.
heterogeneity assessment
Clinical and methodological heterogeneity across all included 
studies was examined and reported. Methodological heteroge-
neity was reported in a summary table. Statistical heterogeneity 
across studies was assessed by visual analysis of forest plots and 
the I² test. The I² test assessed the percentage of inconsistency 
(ie, variability) due to heterogeneity, and values greater than 
50% were considered substantial heterogeneity.30
data analysis
Review Manager (RevMan) V
.5.3 was used to perform statistical 
analyses and to generate forest plots (Copenhagen: The Nordic 
Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).32 The 
primary outcome measure was shoulder pain, and the pooled risk 
ratio (RR) and 95% CI were calculated. A random effects model 
was applied if substantial heterogeneity was found, otherwise, a 
fixed effects model was used. The meta-analysis was performed 
using the Mantel-Haenszel method.33 Sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken to determine if the outcome was affected by different 
classification methods from individual studies.

study selection
The full search strategy and selection process are outlined in 
figure 1. The initial database search was completed on 9 August 
2016, with a hand search of conference abstracts conducted 
the following day. This search identified 1099 study titles that 
potentially met inclusion/exclusion criteria. After duplicates

were removed, the remaining 565 studies were screened, with 
nine studies reviewed in full text. After successfully contacting 
three authors,24 34 35 five studies met the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.36 37 Of 
the four studies excluded at full-text review, one text was 
not available in full text,38 one was cross-sectional in study 
design,39 one did not distinguish between shoulder and elbow 
injuries25 and one measured scapular muscle strength but not 
 
scapular dyskinesis.40
study characteristics
Table 2 outlines the characteristics of the five included studies. 
A total of 419 participants were included in the meta-analysis, 
with the mean age ranging from 14 to 34. The cohorts used by 
the included studies ranged from recreational to elite athletes. 
T
wo cohorts consisted of adolescents,34 35 while the remaining 
studies included adults.24 36 37 Studies predominantly investi-
gated athletes participating in overhead sports, from swimming 
to throwing and racket sports,24 34 35 37 with one investigating a 
population of rugby players.36 T
wo studies included participants 
with self-reported shoulder pain at baseline, and these partici-
pants were excluded from the analysis.24 34
Four of the five studies used different variations of visual 
dynamic assessment.24 34 36 37 The visual dynamic qualitative 
assessment method was initially described by Kibler et al41 
using a four-part classification, which utilised three different 
types of scapular dyskinesis, with a fourth classification repre-
senting cases without scapular dyskinesis.41 More recently, this 
method has been simplified to a dichotomous classification(with 
or without scapular dyskinesis)42 or an obvious/subtle/no scap-
ular dyskinesis trichotomous classification43 44 or a winging/
tilting/normal trichotomous classification.45 Where a study 
used multiple classifications, this was dichotomised into with or 
without scapular dyskinesis for meta-analysis.24 36 37 Only one 
study differed substantially from these methods of visual clas-
sification, using measurement of distance between anatomical 
landmarks.35 The author of that study provided dichotomised 
data (with or without scapular dyskinesis) using receiver oper-
ating characteristic analysis. This process is outlined in detail 
in  online supplementary appendix 2.
In the included studies, participants were followed up for 
either 1 
year or one season. However, one study performed 
follow-up at 12 and 24 months.37 All studies utilised self-re-
porting of shoulder pain/injuries. A single end of season ques-
tionnaire was used in three studies.34–36 One of these studies 
also used self-report at medical check-ups.34 Serial administra-
tion of standardised questionnaires was used in two studies. The 
Shoulder Disability Questionnaire was administered at 12 and 
24 months by Struyf et al.37 The Oslo Sports Trauma Research 
Centre injury questionnaire was administered every 2 
weeks 
throughout the season by Clarsen et al.24
T
wo studies classified shoulder pain as reporting pain at any 
point during the follow-up, lasting at least a day.35 37 One study 
classified shoulder pain as pain lasting at least 2 
weeks, but not 
necessarily requiring withdrawal from sport.36 One study classi-
fied shoulder pain as requiring greater than 7 
days of withdrawal 
from participation.34 One study administered 15 questionnaires 
and an average score called the Cumulative Severity Score (CSS) 
was calculated.24 In their analysis they used a cut-off of >40% 
to 
define shoulder injury. This cut-off was used because it had the 
greatest predictive value. For the purpose of this study, a cut-off 
point of a CSS >0 was used. This would detect the presence of 
any shoulder pain during the follow-up and increase similarity 
with the other studies. The total prevalence of shoulder pain was 
121/419 (26.95%, range 18.2% to 40.3%).
risk of bias
The critical appraisal of the included studies using the Downs 
and Black checklist is detailed in figure 2 and summarised 
using a stacked bar chart in figure 3. Generally, studies 
performed well, with four obtaining greater than 75% scores 
and a mean score of 81%.24 34–36 However, some risks of bias 
were common. No study reported the results of the baseline 
assessment of scapular dyskinesis of drop-outs, and it cannot 
be determined if scapular dyskinesis was equally prevalent 
in those who dropped out and those that did not. No study 
made between-group comparisons between those with and 
without scapular dyskinesis at baseline. Only two studies 
compared other risk factors between cases and controls to 
further explain their findings.34 35 Only one study fully met 
the external validity criteria by clearly outlining their recruit-
ment process.24 By not reporting the proportion of the source 
population from which the patients were derived and propor-
tion of the sample who were included, it could not be accu-
rately established whether the cohorts were representative of 
the source population in the other four studies.34–37 Outside of 
the checklist, no study reported if participants were blinded to 
their baseline assessment of scapular dyskinesis.

synthesis of results and meta-analysis
All five studies were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis, 
of which the results are presented in figure 4. Of the 419 partic-
ipants, 160 (38.19%) presented with scapular dyskinesis. In 
relation to the overall risk, 35% of athletes with scapular dyski-
nesis (56/160) experienced shoulder pain over a 9 to 24-month 
follow-up. In comparison, 25% of athletes without scapular 
dyskinesis (65/259) experienced shoulder pain in this time 
period.
The presence of scapular dyskinesis at baseline was indicative 
of a 43% increased risk of shoulder pain over a 9 to 24-month 
follow-up (RR=1.43, 95% 
CI 1.05 to 1.93, I2=40%). To deter-
mine the effects of a different classification of shoulder pain, 
Shitara et al34 was excluded. The results of this sensitivity anal-
ysis demonstrated that the presence of scapular dyskinesis at 
baseline was indicative of a 54% increased risk of shoulder pain 
(RR=1.54, 95% 
CI 1.13 to 2.10, I2=40%). To determine the 
effects of a different assessment of scapular dyskinesis, McKenna 
et al35 was excluded. The results of this sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that the presence of scapular dyskinesis at base-
line was indicative of a 28% increased risk of shoulder pain 
(RR=1.28, CI 0.93 to 1.76, I2=17%). However, this result did 
not reach statistical significance.
dIscussIOn
This review extends knowledge of the linkage between scap-
ular motion and pain, and found that asymptomatic athletes 
with scapular dyskinesis have a 43% greater risk of developing 
shoulder pain over a 9 to 24-month follow-up period compared 
with counterparts who did not have scapular dyskinesis. This 
adds weight to the argument that scapular dyskinesis may 
contribute to the development of shoulder pain. Scapular dyski-
nesis might be considered a ‘culprit’ rather than a ‘victim’ in 
some cases of shoulder pain. However, these results should be 
interpreted with caution due to the variance in the 95% CIs, 
methodological heterogeneity and some risk of bias across the 
included studies.
Analysis of key factors—classification of shoulder pain and 
measurement of scapular dyskinesis
Both the classification of shoulder pain and the measurement of 
scapular dyskinesis varied across the included studies. Regarding 
shoulder pain, the classification used by Shitara et al34 included 
a complete withdrawal from participation in training or compe-
tition of greater than 7 
days; a stricter definition than those used 
by the other included studies.24 35–37 Sensitivity analysis excluding 
the study by Shitara et al34 increased the RR and narrowed the 
95% 
CI for increased risk of shoulder pain in asymptomatic 
athletes with scapular dyskinesis (RR 1.54, 95% 
CI 1.12 to 2.10). 
This analysis suggests that scapular dyskinesis may not be a risk 
factor for injuries that require complete withdrawal from short-
term participation, that is, severe and disabling injuries. It may 
be a more important risk factor for lower grade shoulder inju-
ries. Lower grade injuries still cause athletes to seek treatment 
and frequently cause reductions in performance and participa-
tion without being severe enough to cause complete withdrawal 
from sport.4
Measurement of scapular dyskinesis varied, as one included 
study35 reported scapular dyskinesis using continuous data,

review
which required dichotomisation for the current meta-analysis. A 
sensitivity analysis excluding this study highlighted homogeneity 
among the remaining four studies (I2=17%).24 34 36 37 While the 
remaining studies found a 28% increased risk of developing 
shoulder pain in athletes with scapular dyskinesis, this result 
was not statistically significant (RR=1.28, CI 0.93 to 1.76). 
This sensitivity analysis identifies that caution should be taken in 
interpreting these results and further confirmation studies would 
be beneficial.
It is possible that the importance of scapular dyskinesis as a risk 
factor may vary according to age or competitive level. Based on 
the forest plot (figure 4), there does not appear to be a consistent 
difference in the effects of dyskinesis within age or competitive 
level. For example, the results of the two studies performed on 
adolescent athletes are contrasting.34 35 Likewise, the one study 
performed on recreational athletes has a similar point estimate, 
although with wider 95% 
CI, when compared with the pooled 
RR.37 However, due to the small number of studies overall 
subgroup analysis is not appropriate. At this point, conclusions 
cannot yet be made regarding the variance of the importance of 
scapular dyskinesis on different populations.
Of the four studies excluded at full-text review, only one 
study prospectively investigated the effect of scapular dyskinesis 
on injury risk.25 That study was excluded because it included 
both shoulder and elbow injuries.25 Of note, the authors found 
no significant difference in injury risk between those with and 
without scapular dyskinesis.25 This is not surprising as the elbow, 
being more distant from the scapula than the shoulder, is less 
likely to be affected by scapular dyskinesis. Additionally, a low 
shoulder pain incidence of 3.7% was observed; a much lower 
incidence than that observed consistently in the current review 
(range between 18.2% and 40.3%), decreasing the power of the 
study to establish risk factors. It is unlikely that the inclusion of 
that study in the current review would have affected the overall 
results of the current analysis.
Mechanisms by which scapular dyskinesis could contribute to 
the development of shoulder pain
The association between scapular dyskinesis and shoulder 
pain has been previously examined by cross-sectional studies, 
which have been summarised by two conflicting systematic 
reviews.22 46 While the earlier review22 demonstrated that SIS 
was associated with less scapular upward rotation and external 
rotation, and greater elevation and protraction, the other 
review46 did not. The first study22 conducted a meta-analysis, 
whereas the latter46 was a narrative review, which may explain 
their conflicting conclusions. Neither review was able to deter-
mine whether scapular dyskinesis was involved in the mecha-
nism of developing shoulder pain or whether it developed as a 
consequence of shoulder pain.22
However, this current review suggests that asymptomatic 
athletes with scapular dyskinesis have a higher risk of developing 
future shoulder pain than those without scapular dyskinesis. It 
is not yet clear exactly how scapular dyskinesis contributes to 
shoulder pain and whether scapular dyskinesis may be consid-
ered a direct or indirect contributing factor. As a direct factor, 
previous theories have suggested that scapular dyskinesis could 
result in subacromial pain syndrome via reduction of the 
subacromial space,1 17 or that scapular dyskinesis reduces rotator 
cuff functional strength, thereby increasing the likelihood of the 
tendon overload with subsequent tendinopathic symptoms.19 20 
However, scapular dyskinesis may be an indirect interactive risk 
factor, as recent prospective research has demonstrated that 
scapular dyskinesis is not a risk factor in isolation but increases 
risk of shoulder pain the presence of excessive increases in 
load.47 Moreover, this current review demonstrated that dyski-
nesis can be present in the absence of shoulder pain (65% of 
athletes) and shoulder pain can be present in the absence of 
dyskinesis (25% of athletes). Thus, scapular dyskinesis may only 
be important, as an interactive risk factor. Alternatively, it is 
possible that scapular dyskinesis may not be a risk factor at all, 
but an early warning indicator of future shoulder pain, acting 
as the canary in a mineshaft.48 Previous research has indicated 
that immediate (short-term) fatigue49–52 and excessive increases 
in training load,53 54 can induce scapular dyskinesis without 
shoulder pain and separately can also independently induce 
shoulder pain. Further investigation is warranted to confirm 
or refute these hypothesis to determine what other factors are 
involved and how the factors interact to contribute to shoulder 
pain. However, with the currently available evidence, it appears 
that scapular dyskinesis acts as an indirect factor that increases 
the risk of shoulder pain in the presence of other risk factors, but 
this may change once untested theories are explored.
screening
The purpose of investigating risk factors for shoulder pain 
is twofold; to better understand the mechanisms of shoulder 
pain and to develop strategies to prevent shoulder pain.55 A 
commonly proposed strategy is screening to identify those with 
a risk factor and intervene with a preventative programme. The 
question is: should screening for scapular dyskinesis be included 
as common practice? To answer this question, the prevalence 
of scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic athletes and the risk of 
shoulder pain in athletes without scapular dyskinesis must be 
taken into account.33 Recent evidence suggests a 54% prevalence 
of scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic overhead athletes.23 
According to the results of the current review, the 46% of 
athletes without scapular dyskinesis would be exposed to a 25% 
risk, leading to 11 athletes in 100 developing shoulder pain. The 
54% of athletes with scapular dyskinesis would be exposed to

What are the new findings?
 
► The presence of scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic 
overhead athletes indicated a 43% increased risk of 
developing shoulder pain.
 
► This finding in isolation has minimal use in screening but 
may be useful as part of a battery of tests that includes other 
known risk factors.
review
a 35% risk (43% increased risk than those without), leading to 
19 athletes in 100 developing shoulder pain. In this instance, 35 
athletes would correctly be classified as unlikely and 19 athletes 
correctly classified as likely to develop shoulder pain. This 
scenario presents a diagnostic accuracy of 54%, which is essen-
tially the same as a coin toss. The validity of screening in sports 
has recently been challenged extensively.55 56 The current review 
would support these challenges, highlighting that screening 
for scapular dyskinesis is not a useful approach to predict 
 
shoulder pain.
On the other hand, the presence of scapular dyskinesis does 
indicate an increased risk of developing shoulder pain. The time 
and financial cost of assessing for scapular dyskinesis is minimal.1 
The information obtained could be used as part of a battery of 
tests including other known predictive risk factors such as gleno-
humeral rotational range,57 rotator cuff strength58 and previous 
injury57 to determine an individualised injury risk profile. In the 
screening example above, the positive and negative likelihood 
ratios of 1.26 and 0.73, respectively, can be calculated.59 These 
figures indicate that shoulder pain is 1.26 times more likely in 
athletes who have scapular dyskinesis than those that do not 
have scapular dyskinesis. They also indicate that shoulder pain 
is only 0.73 times as likely to occur in people who do not have 
scapula dyskinesis in comparison to those that do have scapular 
dyskinesis. Thus, it would seem that screening for shoulder pain, 
would best be conducted using several predictive risk factors, 
including scapular dyskinesis.
The presence and extent of scapular dyskinesis has been 
shown to be influenced by acute and chronic fatigue.50–52 54 
Scapular dyskinesis is more prevalent directly after a session 
and typically increases as a season progresses.50–54 It is possible 
that athletes may develop scapular dyskinesis postinitial 
screening, over the course of a season, and then later develop 
symptoms, which could explain the number of false nega-
tives.49 54 Future studies should consider investigating if 
serial screening has any superior benefit to baseline screening 
 
in isolation.
Injury prevention
Despite the limitations in screening and targeted preventative 
interventions, the understanding of risk factors can be useful in 
injury prevention programmes if implemented on a wider scale. 
For example, eccentric hamstring weakness has been established 
as a risk factor for hamstring injuries.60 61 Rather than specifi-
cally targeting only athletes with eccentric weakness, eccentric 
training exercise interventions applied with high compliance in 
a non-targeted fashion have been very successful at reducing the 
incidence of hamstring injuries.62–64 The current review demon-
strates that scapular dyskinesis may increase the risk of shoulder 
pain, and this suggests that scapular-focused exercises may be 
of value for injury prevention. However, as discussed earlier, it 
remains unclear if scapular dyskinesis is directly or indirectly 
involved in the mechanism of shoulder pain. Addressing scapular 
dyskinesis in isolation is unlikely to be effective if the scapular 
dyskinesis is, for example, an adaptive compensation secondary 
to excessive training load, whereby loading issues should first 
be addressed. Moreover, evidence from two recent systematic 
reviews highlights inconsistencies in outcomes of scapular-fo-
cused interventions on scapular positioning.65 66 Thus, it cannot 
be assumed that addressing scapular dyskinesis directly will 
reduce injury risk. In these instances, screening scapular dyski-
nesis in athletes may still be useful to identify those with an 
increased injury risk where intervention is appropriate, even if 
the intervention addresses other modifiable factors to ‘offset’ the 
risk. T
wo randomised control trials in swimmers67 and handball 
athletes68 have demonstrated that a shoulder injury prevention 
programme using a combination of rotator cuff strength, scap-
ular stability, kinetic chain mobility and energy transfer exercises 
can be effective in reducing the incidence of shoulder pain.67 68 It 
is impossible to determine from those studies, if scapular-focused 
interventions, non-scapular focused interventions or a combi-
nation is the most effective. There is always inherent overlap 
between exercises, and it is impossible to isolate rehabilitation of 
the scapula without some transfer into the kinetic chain.1 Based 
on current evidence, it appears that clinicians should continue 
to consider scapular position during holistic shoulder exercises 
designed to promote upper limb robustness and reduce injury 
susceptibility.
strength and limitations
The main strength of this study was its meta-analysis of over 400 
participants and the high prevalence of shoulder pain across the 
included studies, providing greater power to detect risk factors, 
than given in individual studies. The all-encompassing definition 
of shoulder pain and the dichotomisation of scapular dyskinesis 
improves the external validity of the findings, which can be 
applied from recreational to elite athletes across a multitude of 
sports.
On the other hand, wide definitions of shoulder pain limit the 
extrapolation of this study directly to mechanisms of shoulder 
pain. Additionally, the quality appraisal identified several factors 
which allow the potential risk of bias. No study reported on 
whether participants were blinded to the results of their baseline 
testing. Informing patients of their testing may cause them to 
alter behaviours, especially if they feel at risk due to ‘impaired 
scapular control’. This may have in turn affected their injury 
risk, confounding the results observed. The majority of studies 
did not adequately compare between groups for confounding 
factors and thus it cannot be determined if scapular dyskinesis 
is directly or indirectly involved in the mechanism of shoulder 
pain development.
Future studies
It is unclear if scapular dyskinesis is directly or indirectly related 
to the mechanisms of shoulder pain. Future studies should aim 
to clarify this relationship. It is also worth investigating if scap-
ular dyskinesis interacts with other risk factors through the 
calculation and combination of likelihood ratios for different 
What do we already know?
 
► Scapular dyskinesis is common in asymptomatic overhead 
athletes.
 
► Scapular dyskinesis is associated with poorer outcome in 
patients with shoulder pain.

risk factors. Finally, future studies should investigate if scapular 
focused treatment can effectively reduce injury risk. It is imper-
ative that any future study investigating scapular dyskinesis as a 
risk factor for shoulder pain use prospective study design, blind 
participants to the results of their baseline assessment, and make 
clear between-group analysis of potential confounding factors at 
baseline and at end point.
conclusion
The presence of scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic athletes 
appears to increase the risk of developing shoulder pain by 
43% (CI). This information may be useful as part of the peri-
odic health examination and in the design of injury prevention 
 
programmes.
