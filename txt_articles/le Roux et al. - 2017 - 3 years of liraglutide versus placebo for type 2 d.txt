Summary 
40 
Background: 
41 
Liraglutide 3·0 mg reduced body weight and improved glucose metabolism after the 56-week period 
42 
of this trial, one of four trials comprising the SCALE programme. The primary objective of the 3-
43 
year SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial was to evaluate the proportion of individuals with 
44 
prediabetes who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  
45 
Methods: 
46 
In this 3-year double-blind trial, 2254 adults with prediabetes and a body-mass index of at least 30 
47 
kg/m2, or at least 27 kg/m2 with comorbidities, were randomised 2:1, using a telephone or web-based 
48 
system, to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg or placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie 
49 
diet and increased physical activity. Time to diabetes onset after 160 weeks was the primary 
50 
endpoint, evaluated in randomised treated individuals with at least one post-baseline assessment. The 
51 
trial was conducted at 191 sites in 27 countries and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
52 
NCT01272219. 
53 
Findings:  
54 
The study ran between June 1, 2011, and March 2, 2015; 791 of 1505 (52·6%) participants 
55 
randomised to liraglutide and 337 of 749 (45·0%) randomised to placebo completed 3 years. By 
56 
week 160, 26 of 1472 individuals in the liraglutide group vs 46 of 738 in the placebo group were 
57 
diagnosed with diabetes while on treatment. For the 26 individuals in the liraglutide group, the mean 
58 
time from randomisation to diagnosis was approximately 99±47 weeks vs 87±47 weeks for the 46 
59 
individuals in the placebo group. Taking the different diagnosis frequencies between the treatment 
60 
groups into account, the time to onset of diabetes over 160 weeks among all randomised individuals 
61 
was 2·7 times longer with liraglutide than with placebo (95% CI, 1·9 to 3·9, p<0·0001), 
62 
corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0·21 (95% CI, 0·13 to 0·34). Liraglutide induced greater weight 
63 
  
4 
loss than placebo at week 160 (-6·1±7·3% vs -1·9±6·3%, estimated treatment difference -4·3% [95% 
64 
CI, -4·9 to -3·7], p<0·0001). Serious adverse events were reported by 15·1% of randomised treated 
65 
individuals in the liraglutide group vs 12·9% in the placebo group. 
66 
Interpretation:  
67 
This trial provides results for up to 3 years of treatment, with the limitation that withdrawn 
68 
individuals were not followed up after discontinuation. Liraglutide 3·0 mg may provide health 
69 
benefits in terms of reduced diabetes risk in individuals with obesity and prediabetes.

Research in context 
73 
Evidence before this study 
74 
We searched PubMed from Jan 1, 1990, to April 30, 2016, using the terms “obesity” and 
75 
“liraglutide” and “randomised clinical trial”. We found 45 articles assessing liraglutide treatment, 
76 
including one phase 1 study, seven randomised controlled studies and seven review articles that 
77 
evaluated liraglutide at a dose of 3·0 mg for weight management. Of those, one randomised 
78 
controlled study was performed in individuals with and without prediabetes over a 56-week 
79 
treatment period. According to study design, individuals who had prediabetes at screening continued 
80 
on treatment for a further two years, and are the subject of the current report.  
81 
Added value of this study 
82 
Few trials of anti-obesity medications have been performed over 3 years. This study provides 
83 
clinically important long-term data on the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 3·0 mg in individuals 
84 
with prediabetes treated for 3 years followed by a 12-week off-treatment follow-up period. 
85 
Treatment with liraglutide 3·0 mg over 3 years was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, 
86 
weight loss and improvements in glycaemic control in individuals with prediabetes. Liraglutide 3·0 
87 
mg was generally well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed as compared to the 
88 
previous evaluation after 56 weeks of treatment. 
89 
Implications of all the available evidence 
90 
Treatment with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg for 3 years, combined with a reduced-
91 
calorie diet and increased physical activity, may not only provide a sustained clinically relevant 
92 
weight loss, but also additional health benefits in terms of reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as 
93 
improvements in glycaemic control in a high-risk group of individuals with prediabetes and 
94 
overweight/obesity.

Introduction 
97 
Prediabetes and obesity are risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus1–3 and its complications.3 The 
98 
prevalence of diabetes is increasing,1–3 and 5–10% of people with prediabetes develop diabetes 
99 
yearly.4 Weight loss through lifestyle intervention, with or without pharmacotherapy, can reduce the 
100 
risk of developing diabetes.4–9 
101 
 
102 
Once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased 
103 
physical activity, is approved for weight management in several regions including North America 
104 
and Europe. Liraglutide promotes weight loss through reduced appetite and energy intake.10 The 56-
105 
week part of the current trial was reported previously and evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
106 
liraglutide 3·0 mg for weight loss over 56 weeks.11 Liraglutide 3·0 mg provided substantial weight 
107 
loss in individuals with or without prediabetes who had obesity or overweight with comorbidities, 
108 
and reduced type 2 diabetes incidence. Individuals who had prediabetes at screening continued on 
109 
treatment in the trial for a further two years, and are the subject of the current report. 
110 
 
111 
This 3-year trial aimed to evaluate the effect of liraglutide 3·0 mg in delaying the onset of type 2 
112 
diabetes in individuals with prediabetes, as well as on weight loss and safety over 3 years. 
113 
 
114 
Methods 
115 
Study design 
116 
SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes was conducted as part of a large global phase 3a clinical 
117 
development programme of 4 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with over 5000 
118 
participants that was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 3·0 mg, a 
119 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA), for weight management .11-14 We conducted 
120 
the study at 191 sites in 27 countries in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and 
121 
  
7 
Australia. The study design is shown in the appendix p 9. The protocol was approved by local ethics 
122 
committees or institutional review boards and is available with the full article text at thelancet.com. 
123 
The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki15 and Good Clinical Practice.16 
124 
The 56-week period of the trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 3·0 mg for weight 
125 
management in individuals with and without prediabetes.11 The methodology is summarised below. 
126 
From week 56, individuals with prediabetes at screening continued on treatment for a further two 
127 
years, with a 12-week off-treatment follow-up period. Thus individuals with prediabetes were on 
128 
treatment for up to 3 years.  
129 
 
130 
Participants 
131 
We enrolled adults aged ≥18 years with stable body weight and a body-mass index (BMI) of 
132 
≥30 kg/m2, or ≥27 kg/m2 with treated or untreated dyslipidaemia and/or hypertension. Each 
133 
individual provided written informed consent before participation. Key exclusion criteria were type 1 
134 
or 2 diabetes, medications causing significant weight gain or loss, bariatric surgery, history of 
135 
pancreatitis, major depressive or other severe psychiatric disorders, and family or personal history of 
136 
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Detailed eligibility and 
137 
exclusion criteria are provided in the appendix p 31. 
138 
 
139 
Randomisation and masking 
140 
Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive liraglutide 3·0 mg or placebo. 
141 
Randomisation was performed using a sponsor-provided telephone or web-based system. The 
142 
sponsor generated the random allocation sequence, and the trial investigators enrolled individuals, 
143 
and assigned them to treatment. Participants were stratified at screening by BMI (≥30 vs <30 kg/m2) 
144 
and according to whether or not they had prediabetes. Those who had prediabetes and completed 56 
145 
weeks of treatment continued for an additional 104 weeks of treatment, allowing for a total of 160 
146 
  
8 
weeks of treatment. Participants without prediabetes were on treatment for 56 weeks, followed by a 
147 
12-week re-randomised period; results for this period of the trial have been reported previously.11 
148 
Participants without prediabetes are not included in the current report, thus the stratification factor 
149 
was not included in the statistical analysis. Participants and investigators were blinded to treatment 
150 
allocation during the entire trial (160 weeks plus the 12-week off-treatment follow-up period), 
151 
whereas the sponsor was unblinded to treatment allocation at week 56.  
152 
 
153 
Procedures and treatments 
154 
The current report covers participants with prediabetes who were randomised to treatment for the full 
155 
3-year period. The diagnosis of prediabetes was based on fulfilment of at least one of the three 
156 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2010 criteria: glycated haemoglobin 5·7−6·4% both 
157 
inclusive and/or fasting plasma glucose ≥5·6 mmol/L and ≤6·9 mmol/L and/or 2-hour post-challenge 
158 
plasma glucose ≥7·8 mmol/L and ≤11·0 mmol/L.17 Diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by two 
159 
consecutive measurements of the same type of criteria: glycated haemoglobin ≥6·5% and/or fasting 
160 
plasma glucose ≥7·0 mmol/L and/or 2-hour post-challenge plasma glucose ≥11·1 mmol/L.17 
161 
Liraglutide and placebo were provided in prefilled FlexPen devices (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, 
162 
Denmark), starting at 0·6 mg with weekly 0·6-mg incremental increases to 3·0 mg. All trial 
163 
participants received standardised lifestyle intervention counselling from randomisation to end of 
164 
follow-up, at approximately monthly intervals (appendix p 3). Participants were advised to achieve at 
165 
least 150 minutes of physical activity per week and to reduce their daily energy intake to 500 kcal 
166 
below their individualised energy requirement.  
167 
 
168 
Efficacy and safety endpoints 
169 
The primary objective was to evaluate the proportion of individuals with type 2 diabetes at 160 
170 
weeks, with time to onset of diabetes as the primary endpoint. This was the fourth coprimary 
171 
  
9 
endpoint of the trial; the first three coprimary endpoints, mean weight loss and the proportion of 
172 
participants losing ≥5% and >10% of their baseline body weight, were met at week 56.11 Secondary 
173 
endpoints included changes from baseline to week 160 in glycaemic control parameters, mean and 
174 
categorical body weight, BMI, waist circumference, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and health-related 
175 
quality of life, assessed using validated questionnaires.18-20 Additional methodology, including 
176 
timing of assessments, is described in the appendix p 3. 
177 
 
178 
Specific adverse events with increased prevalence among people with obesity, or of relevance to the 
179 
GLP-1 drug class were assessed (as described in the appendix p 33). Independent medical experts 
180 
prospectively adjudicated 9 of 17 event types in a blinded manner. We report adverse events that 
181 
occurred during the 160-week trial period, from the first treatment day to 14 days after the last 
182 
treatment day, unless otherwise stated. 
183 
 
184 
Statistical analysis 
185 
A sample size of 3600 randomised individuals, 2400 to liraglutide 3·0 mg and 1200 to placebo, was 
186 
chosen to provide an assessment of the safety and efficacy of liraglutide 3·0 mg over 3 years. This 
187 
provided enough power for the primary endpoint of the 3-year trial, the fourth coprimary endpoint, 
188 
which was the long-term efficacy of liraglutide 3·0 mg in delaying onset of diabetes in individuals 
189 
with a diagnosis of prediabetes at screening, as reported here. Superiority for liraglutide 3·0 mg vs 
190 
placebo was tested in a hierarchical manner with respect to the four coprimary endpoints to control 
191 
for multiple testing, whereby the second, third and fourth endpoints were tested only if the previous 
192 
endpoint had achieved statistical significance. 
193 
 
194 
  
10 
For the power estimation, a conservative approach was chosen using the binary endpoint type 2 
195 
diabetes “yes vs no” assessed in completers during the 160 weeks of treatment and analysed with a 
196 
two-sided Chi-square test with a 5% significance level.  
197 
 
198 
It was assumed that the annual conversion rate to type 2 diabetes of the individuals with prediabetes 
199 
would be 7% in the placebo group and 2·1% in the liraglutide 3·0 mg group, i.e., 70% lower. After 
200 
160 weeks of treatment, the percentage of individuals with diabetes was therefore estimated to be 1-
201 
(1-0·07)3 or 20% among individuals in the placebo group, and 1-(1-0·021)3 or 6% among those in the 
202 
liraglutide group. The drop-out rate during the 160 weeks of treatment was assumed to be 65% in 
203 
both groups.  
204 
 
205 
The prespecified efficacy analyses used data from the full-analysis set of all randomised individuals 
206 
who received at least one treatment dose and had at least one post-baseline assessment. The safety-
207 
analysis set included all randomised individuals who received at least one treatment dose. Missing 
208 
values were imputed using last-observation-carried-forward for post-baseline measurements. The 
209 
primary endpoint of the 3-year trial was analysed using a Weibull model, using methods for the 
210 
analysis of interval-censored time-to-event data. The Weibull model included treatment, sex and 
211 
baseline BMI stratum as fixed effects, and baseline fasting glucose value as a covariate. Mean 
212 
changes in continuous endpoints were analysed using an analysis of covariance. Categorical changes 
213 
for dichotomous endpoints were analysed with logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses were 
214 
performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis, and the analyses for mean and categorical 
215 
weight loss (appendix p 36).  
216 
 
217 
The handling of missing data has progressed since the prespecified analyses were defined,21 therefore 
218 
additional post-hoc analyses were specified to further address the issue. A post-hoc Cox regression 
219 
  
11 
analysis was done at week 172 in which diabetes status was imputed for all withdrawn individuals. It 
220 
was firstly assumed that 1% of withdrawn individuals in the liraglutide 3·0 mg group had 
221 
undiagnosed diabetes at withdrawal (based on the five additional cases observed in the 12-week off-
222 
treatment follow-up period), whereas it was assumed that none of those withdrawn in the placebo 
223 
group did so. It was secondly assumed that the risk of developing diabetes after withdrawal in 
224 
individuals who did not have diabetes at withdrawal (diagnosed or undiagnosed) was the same in 
225 
both treatment groups.  
226 
 
227 
Five prespecified subgroup analyses were performed to investigate whether baseline BMI (four 
228 
categories) had any effect on weight or glycated haemoglobin level (see the appendix p 4). All 
229 
statistical analyses in the trial were performed with SAS software, version 9·3 (SAS Institute). 
230 
Additional statistical analysis details are included in the appendix. The trial is registered with 
231 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01272219. 
232 
 
233 
Role of the funding source 
234 
The sponsor, Novo Nordisk, participated in discussions regarding study design and protocol 
235 
development, and provided logistical support during the trial. The sponsor collected the data, and 
236 
planned and performed the statistical analyses, which were assessed by both authors and sponsor. 
237 
The authors interpreted the data in collaboration with the sponsor, and wrote the report together with 
238 
medical writing services provided by the sponsor. The corresponding author had full access to all 
239 
data and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results 
242 
  
12 
Trial population 
243 
The study was conducted between June 1, 2011, and March 2, 2015. A total of 2254 individuals with 
244 
prediabetes, based on ADA 2010 criteria,17 were randomised to 3 years of lifestyle intervention plus 
245 
treatment with liraglutide 3·0 mg (n=1505) or placebo (n=749); see the trial profile in figure 1. In the 
246 
liraglutide group, 791 of 1505 participants (52·6%) completed 160 weeks of treatment, as did 337 of 
247 
749 participants (45·0%) in the placebo group. A greater proportion of participants in the liraglutide 
248 
group than the placebo group withdrew owing to adverse events (13·3% [199 of 1501 participants] vs 
249 
6·2% [46 of 747]). A smaller proportion of participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo 
250 
group withdrew owing to ineffective therapy (1·9% [29 of 1505 participants] vs 4·8% [36 of 749]) or 
251 
withdrew their consent to remain in the trial (21·5% [324 of 1505] vs 31·1% [233 of 749]). 
252 
Individuals who withdrew were slightly younger than the average trial population; otherwise, no 
253 
noteworthy differences in baseline characteristics or medical history were observed (appendix p 35). 
254 
The full-analysis set comprised 1472 participants in the liraglutide group and 738 participants in the 
255 
placebo group. 
256 
 
257 
Baseline characteristics of each group were similar (table 1; additional characteristics are shown in 
258 
the appendix p 35).  
259 
 
260 
Type 2 diabetes diagnosis 
261 
By week 160, 26 of 1472 individuals in the liraglutide group vs 46 of 738 in the placebo group were 
262 
diagnosed with diabetes while on treatment. Figure 2A shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of cumulative 
263 
probability of a diagnosis of diabetes taking censoring into account; 3% of individuals in the 
264 
liraglutide group vs 11% in the placebo group were diagnosed with diabetes by week 160.  
265 
 
266 
  
13 
For the 26 individuals in the liraglutide group, the mean time from randomisation to diagnosis was 
267 
approximately 99±47 weeks vs 87±47 weeks for the 46 individuals in the placebo group, in a post-
268 
hoc analysis. Taking the different diagnosis frequencies between the treatment groups into account, 
269 
the time to onset of diabetes over 160 weeks among all randomised individuals, while on treatment, 
270 
was 2·7 times longer with liraglutide than with placebo (95% confidence interval [CI], 1·9 to 3·9, 
271 
p<0·0001) (appendix p 10). Hence the time to any specific percentile (for instance 1% or 10%) of the 
272 
randomised population that will be diagnosed with diabetes is prolonged by a factor of 2·7 for 
273 
individuals treated with liraglutide instead of placebo, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0·21 (95% 
274 
CI, 0·13 to 0·34) and a risk reduction of approximately 80% for liraglutide vs placebo.  
275 
 
276 
Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses, and the treatment difference remained 
277 
statistically significant after the 12-week off-treatment follow-up period, with five vs one additional 
278 
individuals being diagnosed with diabetes with liraglutide vs placebo, respectively (appendix p 11). 
279 
An additional post-hoc analysis was done at week 172 that addressed the lack of follow-up 
280 
information for withdrawn participants, and assumed that 1% of those withdrawn in the liraglutide 
281 
group had undiagnosed diabetes at withdrawal, whereas none of those in the placebo group did. The 
282 
analysis provided a hazard ratio of 0·34, 95% CI, 0·22 to 0·53, p<0·0001, corresponding to a risk 
283 
reduction of approximately 66%. 
284 
 
285 
Regression to normoglycaemia 
286 
While on treatment, more individuals in the liraglutide 3·0 mg group (970 of 1472; 66%) than the 
287 
placebo group (268 of 738; 36%) had regressed from prediabetes to normoglycaemia by week 160 
288 
(odds ratio 3·6 [95% CI, 3·0 to 4·4], p<0·0001; figure 2B), corresponding to a number-needed-to-
289 
treat of 3. After a 12-week treatment cessation, some individuals in the liraglutide group reverted to 
290 
prediabetes but 740 of 1472 randomised and exposed individuals (50%) still had normoglycaemia at 
291 
  
14 
week 172 compared to 263 of 738 (36%) of those in the placebo group (odds ratio 1·9 [95% CI, 1·6 
292 
to 2·3], p<0·0001). 
293 
 
294 
Glycaemic control 
295 
While on treatment, measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell function improved in the liraglutide 
296 
group vs the placebo group at week 160 (appendix p 37), and glycated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, 
297 
and fasting insulin levels were lower with liraglutide than with placebo (table 2). Effects on fasting 
298 
insulin and HOMA-IR were sustained after treatment cessation from week 160–172; effects on 
299 
fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin were not (figure 2C).  
300 
 
301 
Body weight 
302 
Liraglutide induced greater weight loss than placebo at week 160 while on treatment (-6·1±7·3% vs 
303 
-1·9±6·3%, estimated treatment difference -4·3% [95% CI, -4·9 to -3·7], p<0·0001). Weight loss 
304 
with liraglutide treatment was sustained over 3 years (figure 3A). Greater mean and categorical 
305 
weight loss were achieved in the liraglutide group vs the placebo group (table 2 and figure 3). After 
306 
treatment cessation at week 160, some weight was regained in the liraglutide group, although the 
307 
treatment difference was still significant at week 172 (-3·2% [95% CI, -4·3 to -2·2], p<0·0001; 
308 
appendix p 38). 
309 
 
310 
Several sensitivity analyses confirmed the superiority of liraglutide over placebo on mean weight 
311 
loss, as presented in the appendix p 37. Treatment effects for weight-related endpoints and glycated 
312 
haemoglobin were consistent across BMI subgroups (appendix p 18). 
313 
 
314 
Of note, more than 90% of individuals in each treatment group who were diagnosed with diabetes 
315 
lost less body weight than the treatment group mean at the time of diagnosis (appendix p 20). 
316 
  
15 
 
317 
Cardiometabolic variables 
318 
Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased with liraglutide vs placebo at week 160 while on 
319 
treatment; diastolic blood pressure was not (table 2). Effects on fasting lipids and cardiovascular 
320 
biomarkers were generally modest (appendix p 39), but levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
321 
were substantially lower with liraglutide vs placebo (-36·9% vs -11·0%; estimated treatment 
322 
difference -29% [95% CI, -34 to -23], p<0·0001). 
323 
 
324 
Health-related quality of life 
325 
Liraglutide 3·0 mg was associated with higher mean scores on the SF-36 physical component 
326 
summary score and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life–Lite total score, indicating improved 
327 
health-related quality of life vs placebo (appendix p 39). 
328 
 
329 
Safety and tolerability 
330 
Gastrointestinal disorders, 93% of mild or moderate severity, were the most common side effects in 
331 
the liraglutide 3·0 mg group (table 3), and also the most common cause of withdrawal (118 of 1501 
332 
individuals [7·9%] in the liraglutide group vs 11 of 747 [1·5%] in the placebo group) (see the 
333 
appendix p 23 for adverse events leading to discontinuation of ≥0·2% individuals in either group). 
334 
More serious adverse events were reported in the liraglutide group than the placebo group (table 3). 
335 
Adverse event incidence generally declined during the trial (appendix p 25). Four individuals died — 
336 
two in the liraglutide group (due to cardiac arrest and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma) and two in the 
337 
placebo group (pulmonary failure and cancer, primary tumour unknown). 
338 
 
339 
As previously reported,11 gallbladder-related events were more common with liraglutide than with 
340 
placebo (occurring in 74 of 1501 individuals [4·9%], 2·9 events per 100 patient-years of observation 
341 
  
16 
(PYO) vs 13 of 747 individuals [1·7%], 1·2 events per 100 PYO). More cases of cholelithiasis and 
342 
cholecystitis occurred at relatively constant rates over 3 years in the liraglutide group. Weight loss 
343 
among individuals with gallbladder-related events in the liraglutide group was generally greater than 
344 
the treatment group mean (appendix p 28). 
345 
 
346 
Pancreatitis and neoplasms were assessed over 172 weeks, as described in the appendix p 5. Overall, 
347 
12 pancreatitis cases (eleven graded as mild, one as moderately severe),22 were confirmed by 
348 
adjudication, occurring in ten of 1501 individuals in the liraglutide group (0·7%; 0·3 events per 100 
349 
PYO), and in two of 747 placebo-group individuals (0·3%; 0·1 events per 100 PYO). Eight events in 
350 
the liraglutide group occurred in the first year, (appendix p 26). Five individuals (four in the 
351 
liraglutide group) had gallstone-related pancreatitis, with liver enzyme levels at least three times the 
352 
upper limit of the normal range; three individuals (two in the liraglutide group) had gallstones on 
353 
imaging.23 
354 
 
355 
The incidence of adjudicated and confirmed neoplasms was similar in both treatment groups (2·2 vs 
356 
2·4 events per 100 PYO). As reported previously,11 a numerical imbalance was observed for 
357 
malignant and pre-malignant breast neoplasms: ten events in nine women in the liraglutide group, 
358 
seven occurring in the first year, and no events in the placebo group (appendix p 27). Most women 
359 
with events had above-average weight loss (appendix p 42). There were no cases of medullary 
360 
thyroid carcinoma or C-cell hyperplasia. Liraglutide treatment did not increase median serum 
361 
calcitonin concentrations. 
362 
 
363 
Resting pulse increased in the liraglutide group at week 160 by approximately 2 beats per minute 
364 
(table 2). Increases of >5, 10 and 20 beats per minute on at least two consecutive visits are shown in 
365 
the appendix p 42. Prespecified cardiovascular events (appendix p 33) occurred in 242 of 1501 
366 
  
17 
individuals in the liraglutide group (16·1%; 12·1 events per 100 PYO) vs 142 of 747 individuals in 
367 
the placebo group (19·0%; 15·1 events per 100 PYO). The incidence of adjudication-confirmed 
368 
major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal 
369 
stroke) was similarly low in both treatment groups (0·19 vs 0·20 events per 100 PYO). 
370 
 
371 
No between-group differences were observed for psychiatric disorders, or questionnaire-based 
372 
depression or suicidal behaviour scores. However, seven individuals treated with liraglutide (vs none 
373 
treated with placebo) reported eight suicidal ideation events and one individual in the placebo group 
374 
(vs none in the liraglutide group) reported suicidal depression. There was one suicide attempt in each 
375 
treatment group (appendix p 6). 
376 
 
377 
Results from the 12-week observational follow-up period and additional safety information, 
378 
including results on hypoglycaemia, anti-liraglutide antibodies and pregnancies, are provided in the

381 
Discussion 
382 
In individuals with overweight or obesity and prediabetes, 3 years of continued treatment with once-
383 
daily liraglutide 3·0 mg, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, was associated with lower risk of a type 2 
384 
diabetes diagnosis and greater sustained weight loss compared with placebo. 
385 
 
386 
Generally, lifestyle intervention can induce a 40-70% diabetes relative-risk reduction, and enhance 
387 
insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in individuals with prediabetes at high-risk of developing 
388 
type 2 diabetes.4 In both the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and Finnish Diabetes Prevention 
389 
Study (DPS), lifestyle intervention compared with placebo was associated with a 58% reduction in 
390 
the risk of diabetes after 3 years.6,7 Furthermore, the DPP showed that metformin treatment was 
391 
  
18 
associated with a 31% risk reduction compared with placebo.6 In a  pharmacotherapy trial in 
392 
individuals with obesity, four years of treatment with orlistat was associated with a 37% reduced risk 
393 
of diabetes , concomitant with a mean 5·8 kg weight loss vs 3·0 kg with placebo.8 Moreover, two 
394 
years of treatment with phentermine/topiramate provided a reduction vs placebo in the annualised 
395 
incident rate of type 2 diabetes of 71% or 79%, depending on the dose, in individuals with 
396 
prediabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome.9 Mean weight loss was 10·9 and 12·1% for the two 
397 
phentermine/topiramate doses vs 2·5% with placebo. Finally, pioglitazone reduced the conversion of 
398 
impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes by 72% compared with placebo after a median 2·4 year 
399 
follow-up period, though was associated with significant weight gain.24 The present study addresses 
400 
both weight-loss mediated and direct glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects of liraglutide 3·0 mg 
401 
on the progression to type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide was associated with an approximate 80% risk 
402 
reduction relative to placebo (hazard ratio 0·21) in the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, the 
403 
primary analysis did not take into account the lack of follow-up information for withdrawn 
404 
individuals. Therefore, a post-hoc analysis was done that made assumptions about those withdrawn 
405 
individuals, and provided a risk reduction of approximately 66% relative to placebo (hazard ratio 
406 
0·34).  
407 
 
408 
Whether the lack of a response to treatment for some individuals in the current trial was related to 
409 
individual participant characteristics, or due to other factors, is unclear. Most individuals who were 
410 
diagnosed with diabetes lost less body weight than the treatment group mean at the time of diagnosis. 
411 
 
412 
Regression from prediabetes to normoglycaemia was observed in 66% of individuals in the 
413 
liraglutide group while on treatment over 160 weeks, and was associated with a lower risk of 
414 
diabetes.5 Similar results have been observed previously with liraglutide and other GLP-1 RAs.11, 25–
415 
27 The combination of weight loss and glycaemic improvements achieved with liraglutide and 
416 
  
19 
lifestyle intervention likely contributed to the greater regression to normoglycaemia and  longer time 
417 
to onset of diabetes observed. Furthermore, findings from the DPP Outcomes Study demonstrate that 
418 
regression to normoglycaemia by any means is associated with a 56% lower risk of diabetes.5,28 
419 
Collectively these results support the beneficial use of pharmacotherapy to lower the risk of diabetes 
420 
with the potential to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with obesity and prediabetes.4  
421 
  
422 
Compared to the DPP, which recruited individuals with impaired fasting glucose and impaired 
423 
glucose tolerance, we enrolled a lower-risk, less progressed population as we allowed for fulfilment 
424 
of any one of three ADA 2010 diagnostic criteria17 at enrolment. This, together with the weight loss 
425 
achieved, may partly explain the lower diabetes incidence of 11% observed in our lifestyle placebo 
426 
group, compared to the cumulative incidence of 14·4% at 3 years seen in the DPP for the lifestyle 
427 
intervention group and 28·9% in the placebo group.6 
428 
 
429 
The improvements previously observed11 in body weight, glycaemia and cardiometabolic risk factors 
430 
were generally sustained over 3 years. Similar improvements in many of these parameters, such as 
431 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, have been observed with several GLP-1 receptor agonists,29,30 
432 
including liraglutide.12-14 After 12 weeks of treatment cessation, effects on glycated haemoglobin and 
433 
fasting glucose disappeared with liraglutide, whereas fasting insulin remained low and unchanged, 
434 
supporting differential (direct vs indirect) effects of liraglutide on glucose metabolism and diabetes 
435 
risk. As the participants lost more weight with liraglutide than placebo, it will be important for future 
436 
studies to quantify the relative contributions of weight loss vs the direct effects of liraglutide on 
437 
glucose homeostasis with respect to diabetes risk reduction. 
438 
 
439 
The safety profile over 3 years was in line with that observed over the initial 56-week period.11 The 
440 
numerical imbalance in gallbladder-related events, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis events 
441 
  
20 
that occurred at relatively constant rates over 3 years in the liraglutide group, is currently under 
442 
investigation. Obesity and weight loss are both associated with an increased risk of gallstone 
443 
formation.31 Greater weight loss was generally observed among individuals in the liraglutide group 
444 
who reported gallbladder-related events compared to the overall liraglutide population mean. The 
445 
cause of the greater number of breast neoplasms in the liraglutide group, 70% of which occurred 
446 
during the first year, is still unclear, but weight loss may have increased detection. The underlying 
447 
mechanism for the increased resting pulse with liraglutide is also unknown; a direct chronotropic 
448 
effect of liraglutide on the sino-atrial node has been suggested.32 
449 
 
450 
The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes and their associated major comorbidities and 
451 
healthcare costs highlight the need for effective treatments. Adverse events in the current trial were 
452 
mostly predictable based on the known effects of GLP-1 RAs, including more gastrointestinal 
453 
disorders with liraglutide than with placebo, notably nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting. 
454 
Furthermore, the increased pulse associated with liraglutide, as observed with other GLP-1 RAs, did 
455 
not lead to an increased cardiovascular risk in a large cardiovascular-outcomes trial with liraglutide 
456 
doses up to 1·8 mg.33 In general, liraglutide has a well-documented safety profile based on clinical 
457 
trials in over 5000 individuals with obesity and a large clinical development programme in 
458 
individuals with diabetes, 33 including extensive post-marketing data. While the frequencies of 
459 
gallbladder-related events and pancreatitis were greater in the liraglutide group than in the placebo 
460 
group, the incidence of both was relatively low and will be monitored regularly in the post-marketing 
461 
setting by routine pharmacovigilance. Overall, the long-term efficacy and safety results for the 
462 
current trial support that the benefits of treatment with liraglutide 3·0 mg outweigh the risks in this 
463 
already at-risk population of individuals with obesity or overweight with comorbidities. Data 
464 
provided here will enable clinicians to attenuate the risks of individuals while optimising the 
465 
benefits. 
466 
  
21 
 
467 
Although the 3-year retention rate of 53% in the liraglutide group and 45% in the placebo group can 
468 
be considered successful and comparable to another long-term obesity trial,8 the missing data due to 
469 
participant withdrawal is a limitation when interpreting the primary endpoint and reported adverse 
470 
events. However, a post-hoc analysis accounting for the lack of follow-up information demonstrated 
471 
an approximately 66% lower risk of diabetes with liraglutide compared to placebo, the magnitude of 
472 
which compares favourably with the 58% lower risk observed in the DPP6 and DPP Outcomes 
473 
Study,28 with higher retention and longer follow-up.  
474 
 
475 
In conclusion, 3 years of treatment with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg, as an adjunct to 
476 
a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes in 
477 
individuals with overweight or obesity and prediabetes, and promoted greater weight loss and 
478 
improvements in glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk factors compared with placebo. 
479 
Liraglutide 3·0 mg, as a GLP-1 RA, provides a different treatment option for individuals with obesity 
480 
or overweight, with or without type 2 diabetes, having direct glucose-dependent effects on insulin 
481 
secretion and weight-loss mediated effects on improved insulin resistance. Liraglutide 3·0 mg was 
482 
generally well tolerated. However, post-market surveillance will be exercised to ensure detection of 
483 
potential side effects with a very low incidence.

last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation. For insulin and C-peptide, data were log-transformed for 
622 
analysis and presented as the relative changes from baseline and relative treatment differences. Post-hoc 
623 
analysis was performed for weight loss greater than 15%. Changes from baseline to week 172, after a 12-week

†Estimated treatment differences for all endpoints, except pulse, are from an analysis of covariance with 
627 
available data from the full-analysis set, with LOCF imputation. The full-analysis set comprised individuals 
628 
who underwent randomisation, were exposed to at least one treatment dose, and had at least one assessment 
629 
after randomisation (44 individuals were excluded from the full-analysis set: 38 due to lack of an assessment 
630 
and 6 due to no exposure). Data on pulse are based on the safety-analysis set, which included all individuals 
631 
who underwent randomisation and were exposed to at least one treatment dose.  
632 
‡Loss of at least 5%, more than 10%, and more than 15% of body weight were analysed by logistic regression 
633 
with data from the full-analysis set (n=1467 in the liraglutide group and n=734 in the placebo group), with 
634 
LOCF imputation, and are presented as the proportions of participants (%) and odds ratios.

The 3-year trial population consisted of all individuals with prediabetes, except for those that were 
incorrectly stratified: 37 entered the re-randomised period of the 56-week part of the trial, reported 
previously,15 and are not included below, and 6 with normoglycaemia entered the 3-year part of the 
trial and are included below.  
Figure 2: Liraglutide 3·0 mg and glycaemic status. 
Panel A shows Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of participants who received a diagnosis of 
type 2 diabetes during the course of the trial. Glycaemic status was defined according to American 
Diabetes Association 2010 criteria.21 All individuals for whom diabetes was diagnosed had 
prediabetes at screening, except for one in the placebo group, who had normoglycaemia. The 
numbers along the graph lines show the cumulative number of individuals who received a diagnosis 
of diabetes over the course of 172 weeks. The time until 1% were diagnosed with diabetes was 90 
weeks with liraglutide 3·0 mg and 24 weeks with placebo (post-hoc analysis). Participants were off 
treatment during the 12-week observational follow-up period, but still on diet and exercise. The 
numbers of participants at risk (i.e., remaining in the trial) are shown below the week numbers on the 
x axis. Panel B shows the proportion of participants with prediabetes at screening who regressed to 
having normoglycaemia over the course of 172 weeks. Panel C shows changes in fasting plasma 
glucose (left) and fasting serum insulin (right) over the course of 172 weeks. Relative changes in 
fasting glucose (%) are shown in the appendix p 15. Changes in fasting glucose translated into a 
similar corresponding pattern for glycated haemoglobin changes. Changes in HOMA-IR followed a 
similar pattern as fasting insulin changes. Data shown are the observed means with standard error 
bars (fasting glucose) or with 95% confidence intervals (fasting insulin), and the separate symbols 
represent the 160-week changes using last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation.

Figure 3: Liraglutide 3·0 mg and body weight. 
Panel A shows the mean relative change in body weight for individuals in the full-analysis set who 
completed each scheduled visit. Data shown are the observed means with standard error bars, and the 
separate symbols in the boxes represent the 160-week weight change using last-observation-carried-
forward (LOCF) imputation. The full-analysis set comprised individuals who underwent 
randomisation, were exposed to at least one treatment dose, and had at least one assessment after 
randomisation (44 participants were excluded from the full-analysis set: 38 due to lack of an 
assessment and 6 due to no exposure). Panel B shows the proportions of participants who lost at least 
5%, more than 10%, and more than 15% of their baseline body weight at week 160. Data shown are 
the observed means for the full-analysis set, with LOCF. Findings from a logistic-regression analysis 
showed an odds ratio of 3·2 (95% CI, 2·6 to 3·9) for at least 5% weight loss and an odds ratio of 3·1 
(95% CI, 2·3 to 4·1) for more than 10% weight loss. The analysis for achieving more than 15% 
weight loss was performed post-hoc (odds ratio 4·0 [95% CI, 2·6 to 6·3]).
