Abstract
Introduction: We forecast the prevalence of preclinical and clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
evaluated potential impacts of primary and secondary preventions in the United States.
Methods: We used a multistate model incorporating biomarkers for preclinical AD with US popu-
lation projections.
Results: Approximately 6.08 million Americans had either clinical AD or mild cognitive impair-
ment due to AD in 2017 and that will grow to 15.0 million by 2060. In 2017, 46.7 million Americans
had preclinical AD (amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, or both), although many may not progress to
clinical disease during their lifetimes. Primary and secondary preventions have differential impact
on future disease burden.
Discussion: Because large numbers of persons are living with preclinical AD, our results underscore
the need for secondary preventions for persons with existing AD brain pathology who are likely to
develop clinical disease during their lifetimes as well as primary preventions for persons without pre-
clinical disease.

1. Introduction
Knowledge of the pathogenesis of preclinical Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD) has grown enormously. Several
National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association
(NIA-AA) joint working groups have developed guidelines
for the stages of preclinical AD and revised criteria for
diagnoses [1–3]. The preclinical period begins years
before onset of clinical disease [4,5]. The diagnosis of
persons with preclinical disease is potentially important
because persons may be more likely to benefit from
disease-modifying treatments if interventions occur before
the occurrence of significant brain damage [6]. We use the
terms primary prevention to refer to interventions designed
to be implemented before the occurrence of brain pathology
and secondary preventions to refer to interventions designed
to slow progression to clinical disease (e.g., mild cognitive
impairment [MCI] or AD) among persons who already
have some brain pathology [7]. A recent consensus report
that reviewed the current state of evidence on interventions
to prevent cognitive decline and onset of dementia
concluded that although at present no specific prevention in-
terventions are strongly supported by the available scientific
evidence, cognitive training, blood pressure management,
and increased physical activity may provide some preven-
tion benefit [8]. Recently a number of promising drugs failed
to show clinical benefit in double-blind placebo-controlled
trials in persons with mild-to-moderate dementia due to
R.B. reports fees from Takeda Inc. for serving as a member of a data
safety monitoring board. N.A. has nothing to disclose. C.H.K. has nothing

 AD, and one hypothesis for those disappointing findings is
that the drugs were administered too late in the disease
course [9]. The development of prevention interventions is
a rapidly evolving field especially with increased under-
standing of biomarkers and the preclinical course of AD.
Forecasts of preclinical and clinical disease stages are
important from a number of perspectives. First, the resources
needed to care for patients vary considerably by clinical
stage. Second, prevalence estimates by disease stage are
important for planning as they provide information about
the numbers of persons who could benefit from potential pri-
mary and secondary preventions.
Two approaches have been described for estimating na-
tional AD prevalence [10]. The first approach is based on
probability-based nationally representative prevalence sur-
veys such as the Aging, Demographics and Memory Study
[11]. The second approach, called forward calculation,
uses AD incidence rates from epidemiological cohort (longi-
tudinal) studies, mortality rates, and population projections
in a multistate model to forecast AD prevalence and inci-
dence numbers [12–14]. An advantage of the forward
calculation method is that it can be used to evaluate the
potential impact of preventive and therapeutic advances
that delay progression of disease. Here, we generalize the
forward calculation method to incorporate preclinical
disease and MCI states into a multistate model. We use the
model to forecast US prevalence of preclinical and clinical
disease and to evaluate the potential impact of primary and
secondary preventions on those forecasts.
2. Methods
2.1. Multistate model
An NIA-AA workgroup proposed a framework for the
preclinical stages of AD [1]. The framework posits that the
AD process typically begins with asymptomatic amyloidosis
which refers to amyloid b (Ab) deposition which can be de-
tected by specific biomarkers for Ab accumulation such as
positron emission tomography amyloid imaging or low Ab
42 in the cerebrospinal fluid. The framework postulates
that sometime after the onset of amyloidosis, the disease
process advances to neurodegeneration which can be de-
tected by biomarkers including elevated cerebrospinal fluid
tau, neuronal dysfunction based on fluorodeoxyglucose
positron emission tomography, or hippocampal atrophy/
cortical thinning on volumetric magnetic resonance imag-
ing. Neurodegeneration is followed by subtle cognitive
decline, onset of MCI due to AD [2], and ultimately clinical
AD [3].
We use a multistate model largely based on the NIA-AA
framework for the preclinical stages of AD [1]. Our model
includes nine states: eight preclinical or clinical disease
states plus the death state (Fig. 1). Persons can die in any
state. The model allows several pathways to AD. One
pathway (red pathway in Fig. 1) assumes persons progress
sequentially through the following: normal (state 1), preclin-
ical amyloidosis (state 2), amyloidosis with neurodegenera-
tion (state 4), MCI due to AD with both amyloidosis and
neurodegeneration (state 5), early clinical AD (state 7),
and late (or advanced) clinical AD (state 8). Persons in states
7 and 8 have reached the threshold for a clinical diagnosis of
AD, that is, dementia due to AD. While the red pathway is
the primary pathway posited by the NIA-AA working group
and most consistent with the amyloid hypothesis of AD [15],
evidence supporting the occurrence of AD in the absence of
amyloidosis has also been described [16]. While such path-
ways have been termed suspected non-AD pathophysiology,
there is controversy as to whether such pathways should or
should not be considered part of the AD pathological pro-
cesses
[17,18].
Here
we
allow
for
such
alternative
pathways
including
occurrence
of
neurodegeneration
before amyloidosis and occurrence of MCI due to AD in
the presence of neurodegeneration but not amyloidosis
(blue pathways in Fig. 1).
The model in Fig. 1 differs from the NIA framework in
that we do not include a stage of amyloidosis and neurode-
generation with subtle cognitive decline (called stage 3 in
[1]) because we do not believe there are adequate data at
this time to provide reliable estimates of transition rates to
and from that stage. Instead, this stage is subsumed into state
4 in Fig. 1. The model in Fig. 1 differs from the model of
Fig. 1. Multistate model of the progression of Alzheimer’s disease through preclinical and clinical disease states. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease;
MCI, mild cognitive impairment.

 Jack et al. [19] in that we include MCI states due to AD;
specifically, an MCI state with both amyloidosis and
neurodegeneration (state 5) and an MCI state with only neu-
rodegeneration (state 6). We refer to the states before the
onset of MCI (states 1–4) as preclinical although we recog-
nize that subtle cognitive impairment may be present in
some of these states.
We use a Markov model that allows the transition rates
from one state to another state to depend on person’s current
age and calendar year. The dependence on calendar year is to
allow for the introduction of prevention interventions. The
Markov model does not allow the transition rate to depend
on the duration of time the person has already spent in a
state, but rates are allowed to depend on chronological
age. The model is implemented as a discrete-time model
in which transitions occur at the end of calendar years.
Discrete-time models rather than continuous-time models
are adequate approximations to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis
because of difficulties in establishing exact ages of state
transitions and AD diagnoses.
Here, we provide an overview of the model inputs and
methods. The Supplementary Material gives the technical de-
tails including the transition rates used in the model and their
sources, definitions of biomarker-defined states, sensitivity
analysis methods, and the underlying forecasting equations.
2.2. Transition rates
2.2.1. Preclinical and clinical transition rates
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a longitudinal
population-based cohort study of cognitive aging in Olmsted
County, Minnesota [20]. Using data from 1541 participants
from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, Jack et al. provided a
thorough analysis of the preclinical transition rates into states
2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 1 [19]. We used the study by Vos et al. [21] to
estimate transition rates from MCI to AD (i.e., transitions
from states 5 to 7, and from states 6 to 7). The Vos study re-
cruited subjects from 13 cohorts in Europe and the United
States and is the largest published study of progression (i.e.,
transition) rates from MCI to clinical AD that measured neu-
rodegeneration and amyloidosis at baseline with at least
3 years of follow-up that performed time-to-event (survival)
analyses. The study included follow-up of 353 persons in
the MCI state 5 and 222 persons in the MCI state 6.
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging did not separate out
MCI in their analyses of transition rates in the study by
Jack et al. [19] but did report transition rates from the com-
bined states 4 and 5 to AD (state 7) and transition rates from
the combined states 3 and 6 to AD (state 7). We used those
estimates in combination with the progression rates from
MCI to AD from the Vos study [21] to determine transition
rates into the MCI states using statistical analyses described
in Supplementary Material.
The clinical course of AD is generally progressive. Over
the course of illness, the level of care required for a patient
can range from adult day care in the early stage of the clin-
ical illness to intensive nursing home care in late stage of
illness. We divided the clinical period of disease into two
states: the early clinical and late clinical stages of AD (states
7 and 8 in Fig. 1). We used an annual transition rate of
1/6 5 0.167 years of progressing from early to late clinical
AD based on studies that suggested AD patients require an
intensive level of care similar to that of a nursing home after
an average of approximately 6 years from clinical diagnosis
[22,23]. Although the clinical progression rates from early
clinical AD (state 7) to late clinical AD (state 8) may
depend on age and gender, we do not believe at this point
in time there are adequate clinical data to more precisely
characterize
rates
of
progression
for
our
modeling;
however, we do report a sensitivity analysis to this
parameter.
2.3. Death rates
Mortality rates among persons with AD are higher than
those among the general population. Previous analyses indi-
cated that excess mortality associated with AD can be
described by an additive model whereby death rates for
patients with late-stage clinical AD (state 8) are the back-
ground age-gender-specific mortality rates plus an addi-
tional excess mortality of 7.8% per year, but there is no
excess in mortality rates during early-stage clinical disease
(state 7) [24]. The mortality rates predicted by this model
are in good agreement with empirical studies [25,26]. We
used that model in conjunction with US background death
rates by age, gender, and calendar year [27]. We also report
a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of excess mortal-
ity over background rates in the MCI states and early clinical
AD state (i.e., states 5, 6, and 7) as well as the late clinical
AD state (state 8).
2.4. Modeling prevention interventions
We considered potential impacts of disease-modifying
prevention interventions on prevalence of preclinical and clin-
ical AD. Transition rates before the introduction of the inter-
vention, which are called the baseline rates rij(a), refer to the
annual rate of transitioning from state i at age a to state j
(see Supplementary Material). After introduction of the inter-
vention, the model assumes that the baseline rates are multi-
plied by proportionality constants (i.e., the relative risks):
specifically, transition rates become qijrij(a). The proportion-
ality constants (or the relative risks) qij characterize the effec-
tiveness of the interventions and specify which transition rates
are altered by the interventions. We considered the three sce-
narios described in the following.
First, we considered a primary prevention (I) that lowered
risks of amyloidosis. We modeled the effects of such an
intervention by choosing values for q12 (transition from state
1 to state 2) and q34 (transition from state 3 to state 4) that are
less than 1 (namely, q12 5 q34 5 0.25,0.50,0.75,0.90) and
setting other values for qij equal to 1. For example,
R. Brookmeyer et al. / Alzheimer’
s & Dementia 14 (2018) 121-129
123
 q12 5 q34 5 0.25 corresponds to a primary prevention that
reduces the annual risk of transitioning to amyloidosis
from either state 1 or state 3 by 75% (i.e., risk with interven-
tion for transitioning or amyloidosis from state 1 or state 3
relative to no intervention is 0.25).
Second, we considered a secondary prevention (II) that
delays progression to MCI from a preclinical state of neuro-
degeneration without or with amyloidosis (state 3 or state 4).
We modeled the effects of such an intervention by choosing
values for the parameters q45 and q36 that are less than 1 and
setting other values for qij equal to 1 (namely, q45 5 q36 5
0.25,0.50,0.75,0.90).
Third, we considered a secondary prevention (III) that de-
creases the progression from MCI to clinical AD. We modeled
effects of such an intervention by choosing values for parame-
ters q57 and q67 that are less than 1 and setting other values for
qij equal to 1 (namely, q57 5 q67 5 0.50,0.75,0.90,0.95). For
this scenario, we considered a modest relative risk (0.95)
because the intervention is acting late in the disease course.
2.5. Forecasting prevalence of preclinical and clinical
disease
We used the multistate model to forecast the age- and
gender-specific prevalence rates by disease state through cal-
endar year 2060. Persons are assumed to be in the healthy
state before the age of 30. We calculated prevalence rates
by matrix multiplication of the one-step transition matrices
(see Supplementary Material). We forecast numbers of indi-
viduals living in each disease state by multiplying age- and
gender-specific prevalence rates by US Census population
projections [28]. Our calculations also stratified on gender
because US death rates and census population projections
depend on gender.
2.6. Sensitivity analyses and corroboration
To address uncertainties in transition rates, we performed
sensitivity analyses. We calculated ranges for prevalences by
using a high and low series of transition rates. The high and
low series of transition rates were based on 95% confidence
intervals for each transition rate.
To provide some independent corroboration for our
model, we compared age-specific AD incidence rates
derived from the multistate model with age-specific AD inci-
dence rates from a worldwide systematic review of cohort
studies [14]. The systematic review of AD incidence rates
was based only on direct empirical observations of ages of
AD diagnoses among members of 27 cohorts from around
the world and were not based on any biomarker assessments
or multistate modeling.
3. Results
Table 1 shows prevalence estimates of preclinical and
clinical AD in the United States. In 2017, there were
3.65 million cases of clinical AD in the United States
(range, 1.70–7.62 million). We estimate that approxi-
mately 1.54 million (42%) of the 3.65 million cases
living today have late-stage clinical AD who need level
of care equivalent to nursing homes. We predict by
2060, US prevalence of clinical AD will grow to 9.30
million (range,
4.60–17.82 million).
We
estimate
in
2017, there were 2.43 million Americans afflicted with
MCI due to AD (range, 1.41–4.02 million), which will
grow to 5.70 million by 2060 (range, 3.61–8.34 million).
Approximately 73% of those MCI cases in 2017 have
both neurodegeneration and amyloidosis, whereas the re-
maining 27% have only neurodegeneration. In 2017, 6.08
million Americans were in one of the clinical disease
states (MCI due to AD, early clinical AD, or late clinical
AD) (range, 3.11–11.64 million) and that will grow to
15.0 million by 2060. In 2017, 46.7 million Americans
were in one of the preclinical AD states (range, 36.23–
57.79 million): 22.14 million persons had amyloidosis,
8.33 million persons had only neurodegeneration, and
16.23 million persons had both amyloidosis and neurode-
generation. The number of persons with preclinical AD
will increase to 75.68 million by 2060. We estimate
that the annual incidence of new cases of clinical AD
in
2017
was
540,000
(range,
280,000–973,000)
of
whom approximately 89% arose from a state of MCI
with both amyloidosis and neurodegeneration (range,
82%–93%) while 11% arose from an MCI state with
only neurodegeneration.
Fig. 2 shows the prevalence (in millions) in 2017 by sin-
gle year of chronological age for each preclinical and clin-
ical disease state. More than half of those persons
currently living with only amyloidosis are under the age of
70 years. The modes of the prevalence curves in Fig. 2 in-
crease in the following order: amyloidosis only, neurodegen-
eration only, amyloidosis and neurodegeneration, MCI due

and late-stage clinical AD. Fig. 2 illustrates that the vast ma-
jority of persons who are living with some AD pathophysi-
ology (amyloidosis or neurodegeneration or both) are in
one of the preclinical states (states 2–4 in Fig. 1), whereas
only a small percentage (11.5%) are in one of the clinical
states (states 5–8).

 to 5.01) and the prevalence of AD by 2.35 million persons
(from 9.3 to 6.95). A secondary prevention aimed at
reducing annual risk of progression to MCI by 50% would
in 2060 decrease the prevalence of MCI by 2.14 million
(from 5.70 to 3.56) and the prevalence of AD by 3.84 million
persons (from 9.3 to 5.46). A secondary prevention aimed at
reducing the annual risk of progression from MCI to AD by
50% would in 2060 actually increase the prevalence of MCI
by 2.85 million persons (from 5.70 to 8.55) but would
decrease the prevalence of AD by 2.54 million (from 9.30
to 6.76).
Fig. 3 illustrates the impact of three prevention interven-
tions in Table 2 on AD prevalence for the years 2017 to 2060:
(I) highly effective primary prevention (red curve) that
lowers annual risks of onset of amyloidosis by 75%
(i.e., q12 5 q34 5 0.25); (II) moderately effective secondary
prevention (green curve) that lowers annual risks of progres-
sion to MCI by 50% (i.e., q45 5 q36 5 0.50); (III) modestly
effective secondary prevention (blue curve) that lowers
annual risks of progression from MCI to AD by 25%
(i.e., q57 5 q67 5 0.75). Fig. 3 also illustrates no intervention
(black curve). We find that the highly effective primary pre-
vention strategy (I) resulted in the lowest AD prevalence by
the year 2060. However, that primary prevention (I) was
associated with the largest AD prevalence in the 15 years
immediately after its introduction compared to interventions
II or III. The explanation for this finding is that the full ben-
efits of delaying amyloidosis in terms of reduced AD preva-
lence are not realized for many years because of the long lag
time between amyloidosis and clinical AD. A take-home
message of Fig. 3 is that the full impact on disease burden
of primary prevention that targets the early stages of the
pathogenesis of AD on clinical disease burden may not be
realized for decades.
The moderately effective secondary prevention in Fig. 3
(green curve, II) resulted in the greatest reduction in AD
prevalence for most of the years illustrated in the figure
but was ultimately surpassed by the primary prevention
(red curve, I) beginning in 2054. The modestly effective sec-
ondary prevention (blue curve, III) resulted in the greatest
AD prevalence by year 2060 compared to interventions I
and II. Intervention III yielded a slightly lower AD preva-
lence for 3 years immediately after its introduction
compared to interventions I and II. The explanation for
that finding is that MCI is proximate to clinical AD

 diagnosis, and thus, the impact of delaying progression of
MCI will be seen relatively quickly on AD prevalence
compared to interventions that delay onset of amyloidosis
or MCI.
We sought to determine if AD incidence rates derived
from the multistate model are consistent with worldwide
literature. A systematic review of the worldwide literature
of
AD
incidence
found
that
annual
age-specific
incidence rates grow exponentially and is given by
0.117e.127(a260)% per year at age a (for ages � 60) [12].
The systematic review was based only on direct observa-
tions of ages of diagnoses of AD in cohorts and not on
any biomarker assessments or multistate modeling. Fig. 4
compares age-specific incidence rates of AD from the sys-
tematic review (red curve) with that from the multistate
model (black curve). Annual age-specific incidence rates
(in % per year) from the multistate model at ages 70, 75,
80, 85, 90, and 95 years were 0.31, 0.77, 1.77, 3.54,
6.65, and 10.33, respectively. Annual incidence rates (in
% per year) from the systematic review at the same ages
were 0.42, 0.79, 1.48, 2.80, 5.28, and 9.96, respectively.
The incidence rates produced by the multistate model are
in good agreement with those from the systematic review.
Fig. 4 also shows AD incidence rates produced by the
multistate model based on low and high series of transition
rates used in the sensitivity analyses (black dotted lines).
Estimates from the systematic review are well within the
bounds produced by the high and low series of transition
rates. We recognize that these comparisons should not be
construed to validate each individual transition rate used
in the model; nevertheless, they provide some corrobo-
rating evidence that transition rates used in the multistate
model produce AD incidence rates consistent with world-
wide literature.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis to the progres-
sion rate from early clinical AD (state 7) to late clinical
AD (state 8). We find that if the mean durations of early
clinical AD were 4, 6, and 8 years, then the percentage
of prevalent clinical AD cases in 2017 (states 7 or 8)
with late clinical AD (state 8) are 53%, 42%, and 35%,
respectively; however, the total prevalence of clinical AD
(states 7 plus 8 combined) changes by no more than 5%.
The prevalence estimates of the preclinical and MCI states
(i.e., states 1 through 6) are unaffected by changing the
progression rate from state 7 to state 8. In addition, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of
excess mortality over the background rates in the MCI
states (states 5 and 6) and the early clinical AD state (state
7). To obtain mortality rates in states 5, 6, and 7, we added
half of the excess over background mortality that was used
in state 8 (i.e., we added 7.8%/2 5 3.9% per year to the
background mortality). We found with the adjustment
that the estimated 2017 prevalence of the clinical states
(MCI due to AD, early clinical AD, and late clinical
AD; i.e., states 5–8 combined) is decreased by approxi-
mately 11%.
4. Discussion
We find that most persons currently living with AD brain
pathology (i.e., amyloidosis or neurodegeneration or both)
are preclinical. Many of these persons may never progress
to either MCI or AD during their lifetimes because of the
increasing risks of death with age and long preclinical pe-
riods.
The prevention intervention scenarios we considered in
Table 2 were disease-modifying interventions and by that
we mean they delayed the onset of clinical AD. For example,
the primary prevention we considered reduced the transition
rates to amyloidosis but did not alter any of the other transi-
tion rates. However, suppose an intervention simply masked
or removed amyloid without changing the underlying dis-
ease process. In that case, q12 and q34 would be less than 1
but conceivably q13, q36, and q67 would be greater than 1.
We could find that there would be a decrease in numbers
of persons following the red pathway to AD in Fig. 1, a cor-
responding increase in numbers of persons following the
lower blue pathway to AD in Fig. 1 (suspected non-AD path-
ophysiology), and no net delay in ages of onset of clinical
AD. Table 2 considered the potential public health impact
under hypothetical intervention scenarios. As the field of
AD prevention develops and new candidate prevention inter-
ventions become available, the multistate modeling frame-
work can be used to evaluate their potential public health
impact.
The main sources of uncertainty in our results are tran-
sition rates. We based transition rates on two of the largest
studies of their kind published to date. The ranges we cited
on prevalence numbers were based on sensitivity analyses
using confidence limits of transition rates. Nevertheless,
there are other systematic sources of potential bias in our
results. We recognize that the participants in the studies
may not be representative of the underlying populations.
However, the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging did not report
any significant difference between participants who were
imaged and those who were not or with regard to demo-
graphic characteristics or dementia rates [19]. The transi-
tion rates based on the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging [19]
did not distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from other de-
mentia types, although the investigators of that study noted
most of their cases of incident dementia were AD. If the
transition rates in the study by Jack et al. [19] were based
solely on incident AD, presumably the transition rates
would decrease which would decrease our AD prevalence
estimates.
An additional complication is the impact of vascular pa-
thology on our results. For example, consider the possibility
that vascular pathology in the presence of AD pathology ac-
celerates progression to clinical AD. If the study populations
in studies by Jack et al. [19] and Vos et al. [21] adequately
represented the prevalence of such mixed pathologies, then
the transition rates we used would account for that possible
complication.
However,
for
populations

 prevalence of vascular pathology than those in the study pop-
ulations in studies by Jack et al. [19] and Vos et al. [21], it is
possible that the transition rates could be higher than those
used here. Furthermore, vascular pathology could affect
our results on the impact of interventions. For example, in-
terventions that are designed to target both AD and vascular
pathology could have a synergistic effect on decreasing tran-
sition rates to clinical AD, and as such, the efficacy of such
interventions would depend on the prevalence of mixed pa-
thologies in populations.
We also recognize that preclinical transition rates depend
on the specific biomarkers and cut points used to define pre-
clinical states, although one study suggested that different
definitions of the states of amyloidosis or neurodegeneration
(cut points and biomarkers) yield similar findings [29]. In
spite of these concerns about systematic biases in the transi-
tion rates used in the multistate model, we find that AD inci-
dence rates produced by the multistate model were
consistent with a worldwide systematic review of clinical
AD incidence. Our prevalence estimates also rely on the ac-
curacy of US Census population projections of the aging of
the US population.
Ongoing studies will provide improved and more detailed
estimates of the transition rates allowing future refinements
to the multistate model. For example, multistate models that
subdivide states by quantitative levels of biomarkers (e.g.,
high, medium, low, and negative) rather than dichotomize
(e.g., biomarker positive vs. negative) may prove to be use-
ful. Future studies of transition rates from ethnically diverse
populations are important.
Primary preventions offer the greatest potential for
reducing AD prevalence. However, the benefits of primary
prevention for reducing disease burden would not be fully
realized for decades because of the long preclinical period.
Because large numbers of persons are currently living with
preclinical disease, our results highlight the public health
importance of the development of secondary interventions
targeted at persons most likely to progress to clinical dis-
ease during their lifetimes, the need for improved diagnos-
tics for identifying such persons, as well as development of
primary interventions for persons who do not yet have any
AD brain pathology.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: The authors searched PubMed
for articles on forecasting prevalence of preclinical
and clinical Alzheimer’s disease. No previous study
has provided population forecasts of preclinical dis-
ease or evaluated potential impacts of primary and
secondary prevention on disease burden.
2. Interpretation: Although primary prevention offers
the greatest potential in the long run for reducing
Alzheimer’s disease prevalence, its full impact on
reducing disease burden would not be realized for de-
cades because of the long preclinical period of dis-
ease and large numbers of people currently living
with Alzheimer’s disease brain pathology.
3. Future directions: Because large numbers of persons
are currently living with preclinical disease, our re-
sults highlight the public health importance of devel-
opment of secondary interventions targeted at those
persons with preclinical disease most likely to prog-
ress to clinical disease during their lifetimes together
with improved diagnostics for identifying them as
well as primary interventions for persons who have
not yet developed preclinical disease.
