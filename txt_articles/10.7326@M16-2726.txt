Background: Physicians in the emergency department (ED)
need additional tools to stratify patients with acute heart failure
(AHF) according to risk.
Objective: To predict mortality using data that are readily avail-
able at ED admission.
Design: Prospective cohort study.
Setting: 34 Spanish EDs.
Participants: The derivation cohort included 4867 consecutive
ED patients admitted during 2009 to 2011. The validation cohort
comprised 3229 patients admitted in 2014.
Measurements: Eighty-eight candidate risk factors and 30-day
mortality.
Results: Thirteen independent risk factors were identified in the
derivation cohort and were combined into an overall score, the
MEESSI-AHF (Multiple Estimation of risk based on the Emer-
gency department Spanish Score In patients with AHF) score.
This score predicted 30-day mortality with excellent discrimina-
tion (c-statistic, 0.836) and calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow P =
0.99) and provided a steep gradient in 30-day mortality across
risk groups (<2% for patients in the 2 lowest risk quintiles and
45% in the highest risk decile). These characteristics were con-
firmed in the validation cohort (c-statistic, 0.828). Multiple sensi-
tivity analyses did not find important amounts of confounding or
bias.
Limitations: The study was confined to a single country. Partic-
ipating EDs were not selected randomly. Many patients had
missing data. Measurement of some risk factors was subjective.
Conclusion: This tool has excellent discrimination and calibra-
tion and was validated in a different cohort from the one that was
used to develop it. Physicians can consider using this tool to
inform clinical decisions as further studies are done to determine
whether the tool enhances physician decision making and im-
proves patient outcomes.

A
nnual hospitalizations due to acute heart failure
(AHF) in Europe and the United States exceed 1
million in each region and account for most of the costs
of heart failure–related care (1, 2). The emergency de-
partment (ED) has a central position in the manage-
ment of AHF because about 90% of patients with this
condition visit an ED for their symptoms (3, 4). Once
initial treatments have been administered in the ED and
their effects have been checked, decisions are made
about subsequent patient management; specifically,
does the patient need to be hospitalized, or can they
be discharged to home with proper treatment and
follow-up? As a result of a mainly subjective, empirically
driven assessment, a highly variable proportion of pa-
tients with AHF are discharged directly to home from
the ED (16.3% in the United States [5], 23.9% in Spain
[4], and 36.2% in Canada [6]).
Although decision making in the ED is critically im-
portant, emergency physicians currently do not stratify
patients by risk during this process. Some biomarkers,
including heart-specific markers (such as natriuretic
peptides and troponin) and nonspecific markers (such
as glucose or creatinine), are associated with prognosis
but cannot by themselves predict outcomes with suffi-
cient reliability to aid decision making (7, 8). Several
AHF risk scores have been developed (9, 10), but these
scores were based on hospitalized patients, thus ignor-
ing the many patients with AHF (more than a third in
some countries [6]) who are managed entirely in the ED
and discharged to home. To our knowledge, only 3 risk
scores have been developed specifically for use in the
ED: 2 in Canada (the Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Scale
[OHFRS] and the Emergency Heart Failure Mortality
Risk Grade [EHMRG] [11, 12]) and 1 in the United States
(the Improving Heart Failure Risk Stratification in the
Emergency Department [STRATIFY] scale [13]). How-
ever, the OHFRS and the STRATIFY scale were not ex-
ternally validated, the OHFRS and the EHMRG were
constructed from administrative data, the EHMRG was
based on a sample that excluded palliative patients, the
OHFRS was based on a nonconsecutive sample with
multiple exclusion criteria, and the OHFRS and the
STRATIFY scale were derived from databases of limited
size (n = 557 and 1033 patients, respectively). There-
fore, we believe that additional tools are needed to

 help physicians in the ED stratify patients with AHF ac-
cording to risk.
METHODS
The Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in
Emergency Departments (EAHFE) Registry
The EAHFE registry collects detailed information
on consecutive patients attending 34 Spanish EDs with
a final diagnosis of AHF (14, 15). University and com-
munity hospitals; EDs with high, medium, or low patient
volume (>300, 200 to 300, or <200 patients per day,
respectively); and hospitals from all areas of the country
participate in the EAHFE registry voluntarily. Attending
emergency physicians use Framingham clinical diag-
nostic criteria (16) to identify patients for the registry.
The diagnosis is then double-checked by the principal
investigator at each center, who makes the final adjudi-
cation of AHF diagnosis on the basis of a review of
medical charts and all complementary tests done dur-
ing the ED stay and hospitalization. The diagnosis was
confirmed by natriuretic peptide measurement or
echocardiography (17) in the 92% of patients included
in the EAHFE registry. We excluded patients who had a
concurrent diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocar-
dial infarction (approximately 3%).
For every patient, data on demographic character-
istics, clinical history, presentation, and treatments were
routinely collected on specific case record forms. Inter-
ventions, treatments, and patient placements (hospital
admission or discharge) were based entirely on the de-
cision of the attending emergency physician. Subse-
quent follow-up through telephone contact and consul-
tation of medical records was performed between days
31 and 90. The EAHFE registry complies with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical
committees of all participating centers, and all patients
gave informed consent. About 2% of patients who met
the inclusion criteria declined to participate.
Study Design
During the design of the EAHFE registry, we
planned to develop a model that could stratify patients
according to their risk for adverse outcomes. We
wanted this model to be used as soon as possible after
arrival in the ED by the first emergency physician who
saw the patient, using variables routinely available in
most EDs. When developing the model, which we
named MEESSI-AHF (Multiple Estimation of risk based
on the Emergency department Spanish Score In pa-
tients with AHF), we selected registry patients admitted
during May 2009 and between November and Decem-
ber 2011 for the derivation cohort and patients admit-
ted in January and February 2014 for the validation co-
hort (Appendix Figure 1, available at Annals.org). We
used patients in the derivation cohort to generate a
30-day mortality risk model and patients in the valida-
tion cohort to measure the robustness of the model.
Statistical Analysis
We first identified 88 candidate predictor variables
(Appendix Table 1, available at Annals.org) that de-
scribed baseline demographic characteristics, medical
history, and status at admission and could have prog-
nostic implications. To develop the risk score, we used
logistic regression (without interaction terms) with
checks for nonlinearity and forward stepwise variable
selection, with an entry criterion of a P value less than
0.010. We used multiple imputation with chained equa-
tions (18) to produce 50 imputed data sets for estimat-
ing missing values. Once we identified a predictor, we
then identified a cutoff value based on clinical informa-
tion about the predictor'
s value (for example, serum
potassium level) or the linear trend (for example, serum
creatinine level and systolic blood pressure). In the
final model, we placed each continuous variable into
ordered categories to facilitate their use in practice.
We measured the model'
s discrimination with the
c-statistic and the model'
s calibration by comparing ob-
served versus model-derived mortality risk using the
Hosmer–Lemeshow statistic. We conducted sensitivity
analyses by type of hospital (university vs. community);
by daily ED census (low to medium vs. high volume);
and for alternative models that did not include values
for Barthel index score, N-terminal pro–B-type natri-
uretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, or troponin level (in
any combination) because these values were unavail-
able for many patients. We compared our model with
the EHMRG model (12) in a merged data set of both
derivation and validation cohorts by comparing the ar-
eas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves
for 30-day mortality with the DeLong test. We used
Stata, version 13.1 (StataCorp), for all analyses.

RESULTS
The derivation cohort comprised 4897 consecutive
patients admitted to an ED with AHF during May 2009
and from November to December 2011 (Appendix Fig-
ure 1). Thirty patients were excluded from the analysis
due to lack of follow-up, and 48 patients with censored
data (<30 days of follow-up) were included. At arrival in
the ED, mean age of the patients was 79.7 years; 57.1%
were female; comorbidities were frequent (83.4% had
hypertension, 42.2% had diabetes mellitus, 39.4% had
dyslipidemia, and 29.9% had ischemic heart disease);
89.5% had New York Heart Association class III or IV
disease; 56.5% had some dependency for activities of
daily living (Barthel index score <100 points); and
41.5% had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than
0.50, with 52.4% of them receiving �-blockers, 62.9%
receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin II–receptor blockers, and 29.1% receiving
mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. Patients who

* Quantitative predictor variables have been grouped into appropriate categories. The odds ratio for each category is the change in the odds of
death within 30 d relative to the reference category (e.g., age <75 y). The coefficient for each variable is the log of the odds ratio. Multiple
imputation using chained equations was used for missing data. The intercept was −5.40, which is the log of the odds of death within 30 d for a
patient in the reference category for each variable. Such a patient has the most favorable characteristics and a low probability (0.5%) of death within
30 d. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.

 were subsequently hospitalized (75.6%) had a median
length of stay of 7 days. The remaining characteristics
of the study population are presented in Table 1.
Within 30 days of ED admission, 500 patients
(10.3%) died. We used a logistic regression model with
forward stepwise variable selection to identify 13 highly
significant independent predictors of death that we
then included in the MEESSI-AHF risk score. These vari-
ables are listed in Table 1 in descending order of their
statistical strength of prediction (Barthel index score at
admission was the most highly significant), and each
odds ratio is adjusted for all other variables. Appendix
Figure 2 (available at Annals.org) displays the indepen-
dent effect of each predictor on mortality risk based on
the model in Table 1, and Appendix Table 2 (available
at Annals.org) shows comparisons of key predictor vari-
ables in patients with and without missing values.
The multivariable risk score for a specific patient
can be determined by summing the relevant risk coef-
ficients and the intercept coefficient in Table 1, which is
the log of the patient'
s predicted odds of death within
30 days. The distribution of this risk score for all 4867
patients is shown in Figure 1. Also, the curve in Figure 1
relates a patient'
s risk score to their probability of death
within 30 days of ED admission (median, 0.051 [range,
0.005 to 0.898]). We have created a Web site to facili-
tate the calculation of any patient'
s risk for death within
30 days, including those who do not have values for
Barthel index score, troponin level, or NT-proBNP level
(http://MEESSI-AHF.risk.score-calculator-ica-semes
.portalsemes.org). On the Web site, values for the rele-
vant items can be entered, and the percentage of pa-
tients with these values who are predicted to die within
30 days will be calculated.
Figure 2 shows cumulative mortality over 30 days
for patients classified into 6 risk groups based on the
bottom 4 quintiles and the top 2 deciles of the risk
score'
s distribution in the derivation cohort. Good dis-
crimination of the model was achieved, with a c-statistic
of 0.836 (95% CI, 0.818 to 0.853). There was a steep
gradient in 30-day mortality across risk groups, with
45% mortality for the top decile and about 0.7% for the
bottom quintile. Similar discrimination was observed in
university and community hospitals and in low- to
medium-volume and high-volume EDs (Table 2). Figure
3 (top) depicts the goodness of fit of the model in this
derivation cohort, comparing observed and model-
predicted 30-day mortality risk across the 6 risk groups.
A useful nomenclature is “low risk” for the first and sec-
ond quintiles, “intermediate risk” for the third and
fourth quintiles, “high risk” for the second-highest de-
cile, and “very high risk”for the highest decile. Sensitiv-
ity and specificity of every possible risk threshold are
plotted on the receiver-operating characteristic curve
in Appendix Figure 3 (available at Annals.org). Models
that did not include Barthel index score, troponin level,
or NT-proBNP level (in any combination) also showed
good discrimination, with c-statistics ranging from
0.784 to 0.829 (Appendix Table 3, available at Annals
.org).
Finally, we validated our risk score in a cohort of
3229 patients recruited during January and February
2014. In this validation cohort, 299 (9.26%) patients
died within 30 days of ED admission. Four patients
were excluded from the analysis because of lack of
follow-up, and 6 patients with less than 30 days of
follow-up were included. Comparisons of key predictor
variables between the derivation and validation cohorts
are provided in Appendix Table 4 (available at Annals
.org). Appendix Figure 4 (available at Annals.org)
shows the distribution of the MEESSI-AHF score in the
validation cohort. Figure 3 (bottom) compares the ob-
served and model-predicted mortality in the validation
cohort. The model fit and extent of risk discrimination
were similar in the derivation and validation cohorts.
For example, the c-statistic in the validation cohort was
0.828 (CI, 0.802 to 0.853), and the Hosmer–Lemeshow
test for the validation cohort yielded a P value of 0.122.
When we compared the EHMRG score, which was de-
veloped to predict 7-day mortality (12), with the
MEESSI-AHF score for predicting 30-day mortality, the
MEESSI-AHF score had superior discrimination overall
(c-statistic, 0.830 vs. 0.750; P < 0.001) (Appendix Fig-
ure 5, available at Annals.org).
DISCUSSION
Our findings are based on a large prospective
population-based cohort of consecutive patients with
AHF who were admitted to 34 hospital EDs across
Spain. Patients with many types of AHF were included,
except those developing AHF during ST-segment ele-
vation myocardial infarction, and all data were re-

Risk Score
For a patient in the reference category of each variable in Table 1, the
log of the estimated odds of death within 30 d is �5.40 (intercept of
the logistic model), meaning that the risk for death within 30 d for a
patient at the lowest risk (�5.40) is 0.5%. The log of a patient'
s odds of
death within 30 d (referred to as “x”) is equal to the sum of their
relevant coefficients in Table 1 and this intercept value. Their proba-
bility of death within 30 d can then be calculated as ex/(1 + ex). This
calculation can be done for any patient at http://MEESSI-AHF.risk

 corded shortly after arrival at the ED. The 13 predictors
of 30-day mortality we identified should be readily
available in routine clinical practice worldwide, and we
have provided a Web-based calculator (http://MEESSI
-AHF.risk.score-calculator-ica-semes.portalsemes.org)
to make it easier for physicians to calculate risk for a
specific patient. Using such a calculator, emergency
physicians will now be able to determine whether a pa-
tient is at high (or low) risk for death within 30 days,
which in turn might allow for better patient manage-
ment. Our score may be particularly useful in the 10%
of patients at very high risk (around 45%) for death at
30 days and in the 40% of patients at low risk (<2%).
Identification of both groups has important manage-
ment implications. For a patient with very high risk, at-
tention should be focused on ensuring that the patient
and their relatives are aware of the severity of the situ-
ation. In addition, the patient should receive prompt
and aggressive treatment if appropriate, with an em-
phasis on early admission to an intensive care unit. For
a patient with low risk, attention should be focused on
treatment that will lead to early discharge from the ED
to home, which is consistent with a recent consensus
opinion about patients with less than 2% all-cause mor-
tality who undergo sufficient observation in the ED (19).
In the United States, the overall rate of heart failure
hospitalization decreased by 29.5% between 1998 and
2007 (20). We suggest that this decrease could be due
to better ambulatory care that avoids patient decom-
pensation and allows proper treatment of less severe
AHF episodes without hospitalization. There is an in-
creasing perception that more patients with AHF who
are at low risk for adverse outcomes should avoid hos-
pitalization (4, 21), and recent consensus opinions by
clinical experts advocate this approach (19, 22). Specif-
ically, one group recommends that 20% to 40% of pa-
tients diagnosed with AHF should be discharged di-
rectly from the ED (depending on whether the ED has a
specific observation area) (19). These figures match
well with patients in our low-risk category.
Avoiding hospitalization is not only a matter of im-
proving health care system efficiency and saving costs.
Hospitalization could expose the patient to such haz-
ards as nosocomial infection, medication errors, acute
reactive psychosis, and deteriorating functional status,
all of which are distressingly common among elderly
patients in the hospital. Patients with AHF are typically
of advanced age, with a median age around 80 years in
most series (4, 12). However, we are not aware of any
formal tools that are currently being used to aid risk
stratification for patients with AHF in the ED. Thus,
some have argued that direct discharge of patients
without objective risk stratification puts some patients
at an unacceptably high risk for adverse events (6, 23).
This situation contrasts with improvements achieved in
other prevalent ED conditions, such as community-
acquired pneumonia and acute coronary syndromes,
for which risk scores have been developed (24, 25) and

 are being widely applied to discharge patients with less
severe disease who previously would have been hospi-
talized. We believe that the MEESSI-AHF score can pro-
vide similar help in the management of patients with
AHF, especially elderly patients who are more challeng-
ing to evaluate (15).
The 13 variables we found to be predictive have
been reported to influence the prognosis of patients
with AHF (1, 11–13, 15, 26–28). However, in our study,
more than 25% of values were missing for 4 of these
variables. We adjusted for these missing values by us-
ing multiple imputation. Moreover, to match our score
to real-world practice, our Web site calculator provides
a risk score even when values for Barthel index score,
troponin level, and NT-proBNP level are not available,
and we have shown that these risk scores perform as
well as the regular ones (Appendix Table 4).
Our model compares favorably with other risk
models. For example, it had c-statistics of 0.836 in the
derivation cohort and 0.828 in the validation cohort,
which were higher than when we calculated the
EHMRG score in 2137 patients who had all of the data
necessary to calculate it. The EHMRG model focuses on
a shorter-term perspective (7-day mortality) (12); we
believe that a longer perspective (30-day mortality)
provides a better framework to create a model to aid
emergency physicians. Moreover, palliative patients
(who have a higher risk for adverse events) were ex-
cluded when the EHMRG score was developed, which
could limit its generalizability. Patients receiving only
palliative care are not uncommon; 10.2% of our pa-
tients had a Barthel index score of 0 to 20 points (indi-
cating complete dependence for activities of daily liv-
ing), and an additional 32.8% had a Barthel index score
between 21 and 60 points (indicating severe depen-
dence), and palliative care may be appropriate for
many of them, although this was not directly recorded
in our study. However, we have previously shown that
excluding patients for whom palliative care may be ap-
propriate did not significantly change the discrimina-
tory capacity of the model (c-statistic decreased from
0.741 to 0.729) (29). Our findings, in line with previous
work in this field (30), affirm that the Barthel index is a
key outcome predictor, adding value to previously de-
veloped risk scores. Thus, it is important to recognize
that patient frailty and dependence are key aspects that
should be considered in every disease affecting elderly
persons, including AHF. Finally, our model was devel-
oped with data that were prospectively recorded using
a standardized pro forma at the time of admission to
the ED instead of using retrospective extraction from
administrative reports, as was done for the EHMRG
model. The latter strategy could limit reliability and
completeness of the data. All of the aforementioned
limitations also apply to the OHFRS model, which was
developed using more extensive patient exclusion cri-
teria and a smaller sample and had a c-statistic of 0.77
(11). On the other hand, although the STRATIFY scale
(13) was developed using prospectively recorded data,
it was derived from a limited number of cases and was
not externally validated, and discriminatory capacity
was moderate (c-statistic, 0.68) (13).
Our study has important limitations. Some signifi-
cant predictors had a high number of missing values,
which we have addressed with multiple imputation
techniques and sensitivity analyses. A false-positive
predictor may have entered the risk model, although
use of a P value less than 0.010 as an entry criterion
minimized this risk. Some variables, such as Barthel in-
dex score, New York Heart Association class, associa-
tion with acute coronary syndrome, or low cardiac out-
put, are partially based on subjective interpretation, but
we tried to reduce this problem by providing all study
centers with a dictionary of variables and holding meet-
ings with all researchers before each recruitment
phase. In addition, the precision of our model might
change in the future, especially if new treatments for
heart failure modify mortality, such as the combined
Figure 3. Assessment of risk discrimination and goodness
of fit of the model in 6 risk groups (4 quintiles and the top
2 deciles) from low to very high risk for the derivation
cohort ( top) and the validation cohort (bottom).

 use of inhibitors against neprilysin and angiotensin II
receptors, which were not available when this study
was done. Finally, as with any study done in a single
country, caution should be used in extrapolating find-
ings to other countries. Moreover, EDs were not ran-
domly selected but were participants in the EAHFE reg-
istry with special interest in AHF, so results could differ
when applied to other EDs. We encourage others to
validate our risk model in other countries and regions,
although we believe it has the potential for widespread
use.
In conclusion, our study shows that physicians can
use 13 readily available items to estimate individual risk
for death within 30 days for patients with AHF who are
admitted to the ED. The tool we have developed has
excellent discrimination and calibration and was vali-
dated in a different cohort from the one that was used
to develop it. We believe that physicians can consider
using this tool to inform clinical decisions as we con-
duct further studies to determine whether the tool
enhances physician decisions and improves patient
outcomes. To facilitate its use, we have provided access
to a user-friendly calculator for specific patients (http:
//MEESSI-AHF.risk.score-calculator-ica-semes.portal
semes.org). We believe that this tool will be especially
useful for identifying persons at lower risk, for whom
further hospitalization may not be required.

Of note, the EHMRG score was conceived to predict death at 7 d,
whereas the MEESSI-AHF score predicts death at 30 d. Between both
validation and derivation cohorts, 2137 patients had available data to
calculate the EHMRG score and perform the comparison between risk
scores. The c-statistic was 0.830 (95% CI, 0.804 to 0.857) for our model
and 0.750 (CI, 0.719 to 0.783) for the EHMRG score (DeLong test P <
0.001). EHMRG = Emergency Heart Failure Mortality Risk Grade;
MEESSI-AHF = Multiple Estimation of risk based on the Emergency
department Spanish Score In patients with AHF.
