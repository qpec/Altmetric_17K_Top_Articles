Aims
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease and
mortality across a range of concentrations, but genetic evidence suggest that extreme high concentrations may
paradoxically lead to more cardiovascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that extreme high concentrations of
HDL cholesterol are associated with high all-cause mortality in men and women.

Methods
and results
A total of 52268 men and 64 240 women were included from the two prospective population-based studies, the
Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study. During 745 452 person-years of follow-
up, number of deaths from any cause were 5619 (mortality rate, 17.1/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI):
16.7–17.6)) in men and 5059 (mortality rate, 12.1/1000 person-years (11.8–12.4)) in women. The association between
HDL cholesterol concentrations and all-cause mortality was U-shaped for both men and women, with both extreme
high and low concentrations being associated with high all-cause mortality risk. The concentration of HDL cholesterol
associated with the lowest all-cause mortality was 1.9mmol/L (95% CI: 1.4–2.0) (73mg/dL (54–77)) in men and
2.4mmol/L (1.8–2.5) (93mg/dL (69–97)) in women. When compared with the groups with the lowest risk, the multi-
factorially adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.09–1.70) for men with HDL cholesterol
of 2.5–2.99mmol/L (97–115mg/dL) and 2.06 (1.44–2.95) for men with HDL cholesterol >
_3.0mmol/L (116mg/dL). For
women, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.10 (0.83–1.46) for HDL cholesterol of 3.0–3.49mmol/L (116–134mg/dL)
and 1.68 (1.09–2.58) for HDL cholesterol >
_3.5mmol/L (135mg/dL).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Men and women in the general population with extreme high HDL cholesterol paradoxically have high all-cause
mortality. These findings need confirmation in other studies.

Introduction
Through observational studies it has been established that high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is inversely associated with
both cardiovascular disease and mortality across a wide range of con-
centrations.1–3 This association does however not appear to be
causal, as raising HDL cholesterol pharmacologically has not proven
beneficial in randomized clinical trials,4 and has even paradoxically
been associated with increased mortality in one study.5
Furthermore, certain genetic variants associated with higher con-
centrations of HDL cholesterol have been associated paradoxically
with high risk of cardiovascular disease.6–8 One of these studies refers
to elevated HDL cholesterol associated with a polymorphism of the
CETP gene leading to low activity of the cholesteryl ester transfer

protein (CETP),6 however, in a subsequent study on the same cohort
another genetic deficiency of CETP activity was associated with
reduced (not increased) cardiovascular risk.9 Most recently, a loss of
function mutation in a major HDL receptor, Scavenger Receptor B1
(SCARB1), which lead to high concentrations of HDL cholesterol, was
associated with high risk of coronary heart disease.10 Despite these in-
dications that extreme high HDL cholesterol concentrations might not
be associated with low morbidity and mortality, the association be-
tween extreme high HDL cholesterol and mortality is not well-
described. This is in part because only few individuals have extremely
high HDL cholesterol concentrations11 and therefore often are
grouped together with individuals with only modestly high concentra-
tions, in for example quintiles.1 If those with extreme high HDL choles-
terol have high mortality, like those with low concentrations, this could
have implications for clinical risk assessment in those with extreme
high concentrations of HDL cholesterol, and consequences for devel-
opment of compounds aimed at increasing HDL concentrations.
We tested the hypothesis that men and women with extreme high
HDL cholesterol have high all-cause mortality, using two separate
studies of the Danish general population. Furthermore, we deter-
mined the concentration of HDL cholesterol associated with the
lowest all-cause mortality.
Methods
A detailed description of endpoints, covariates and statistical analyses is
given in the Supplementary material online, Appendix (Methods).
Study cohorts
White individuals of Danish descent (according to the Danish Civil
Registration System, that is, the person and both parents were born in
Denmark and were Danish citizens) were included from two studies of
the Danish general population. Written informed consent was obtained
from all. Studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and approved by local institutional reviews boards and Danish
Ethics Committees (KF-100.2039/91 and H-KF-01-144/01).
The Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS)
Individuals aged 20–100 years were invited randomly from the general
population of Copenhagen using information from the Danish Civil
Registration System. Information on health, lifestyle etc. was obtained from
questionnaires, which were reviewed with an investigator on the day of at-
tendance, and from a physical examination. Blood was drawn for biochem-
ical measurements. For this study 9387 individuals from the 1991 to 1994
examination of the CCHS were included (participation rate, 61%).12
The Copenhagen General Population Study
(CGPS)
The study was initiated in 2003 with ongoing recruitment similar to that
of the CCHS, but from a geographically separate area around
Copenhagen. No individuals were included in both studies. Examinations
were conducted as described for the CCHS. 107 121 individuals were
included from the CGPS (participation rate, 43%).13
Endpoints
Death from any cause was ascertained using the Danish Civil Registration
System and the cause of death was retrieved from the Danish Register of
Causes of Death. For this study, cause of death was classified into three
major categories, as done previously.14 If one of the three first ranked
causes of death was cancer (ICD-8:140-209, ICD-10:C00-C97) it was
classified as cancer related. The remaining deaths were classified as car-
diovascular if one of the three first ranked causes of death was cardiovas-
cular disease (ICD-8:390-458, ICD-10:I00-I99), or classified as other
mortality if neither a cancer nor a cardiovascular diagnosis were among
the three first ranked causes of death. Secondary endpoints in the form
of ischaemic heart disease (ICD-8:410-414, ICD-10:I20-I25), myocardial
infarction (ICD-8:410, ICD-10:I21-I22) and ischaemic stroke (ICD8:431-
438, ICD10:I60-I69 þ G45) were ascertained in the national Danish
Patient Registry.
Laboratory analyses
Blood samples were collected non-fasting.15 HDL cholesterol and trigly-
cerides were measured using colorimetric assays (Konelab). LDL choles-
terol was calculated using the Friedewald equation when triglycerides
were below 4 mmol/L (352mg/dL) or otherwise measured directly
(Konelab).
Covariates
Covariates for statistical adjustment were chosen a priori according to
known associations with all-cause mortality and HDL cholesterol and
included: age, study, body mass index, current smoking, cumulative to-
bacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, systolic blood
pressure, diabetes mellitus, lipid-lowering therapy, LDL cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, birth year, and menopausal status and hormone replacement
therapy for women.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 13.1. Missing information
on covariates was imputed based on age and sex using multivariable linear
regression for continuous variables, whereas categorical variables where
assigned a separate category.
The association between HDL cholesterol and endpoints was exam-
ined using Cox proportional hazards regression with 95% confidence
intervals (CI) and age as the underlying time scale (referred to as age ad-
justment) with delayed entry (left truncation) and censoring at emigration
(n = 478 (0.4%)) or end of follow-up. As women on average have higher
concentrations of HDL cholesterol, analyses were conducted separately
for men and women.
In primary analyses, the association between mortality and HDL chol-
esterol on a continuous scale was examined using restricted cubic splines
incorporated in Cox proportional hazards models. The concentration of
HDL cholesterol associated with the lowest mortality was the concentra-
tion with the lowest hazard ratio in the spline Cox regression. 95% CIs
were non-parametric from bootstrap estimation with 5000 repetitions,
as done previously.14
The association between extreme high concentrations of HDL choles-
terol and mortality was further examined using a priori selected groups
of clinically meaningful HDL cholesterol concentrations. These were con-
centration cut points with 0.5 mmol/L intervals starting from 1.0 mmol/L.
For men the highest group was >
_3.0 mmol/L, and as women on average
have higher HDL cholesterol than men, the highest group for women
was>
_3.5 mmol/L. Individuals were also divided into predefined groups
based on percentiles. Reference groups were the ones containing the
concentration of HDL cholesterol associated with the lowest risk of
death determined using multifactorially adjusted spline regression.
Risk estimates and confidence intervals were corrected for regression
dilution bias using a non-parametric method,16 as done previously.17,18
Regression dilution is a phenomenon where random measurement error
and long-term fluctuations in the exposure variable will lead to

underestimation of the actual association. Using measurements of HDL
cholesterol from 4196 individuals from the CCHS, who attended both
the 1991–94 examination and the 2001–03 examination and did not use
lipid-lowering therapy at either time point, a regression dilution ratio of
0.73 was calculated for HDL cholesterol.
Results
A total of 52268 men and 64240 women were included from the
CGPS and CCHS combined and were followed for 745 452 person-
years. Median follow-up was 6.0 years (range: 0–23), with 5.7 years
(0–11), and 19.9 years (0–23) for the CGPS and CCHS, respectively.
During follow-up, 5619 men and 5059 women died from any cause
giving crude mortality rates of 17.1 (95% CI: 16.7–17.6) and 12.1
(11.8–12.4) per 1000 person-years. Baseline characteristics for men
and women separately are shown in Table 1 and further divided by
study and concentration cut points in Supplementary material online,
Tables S2, S3, S4, and S5.
The distribution of HDL cholesterol concentrations in the general
population was wider for women compared with the distribution in
men, and on average women had higher HDL cholesterol (Figure 1).
The distributions were similar in the two studies (Supplementary ma-
terial online, Figure S1).
HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality
The association between HDL cholesterol on a continuous scale and
all-cause mortality was U-shaped for men and women, as both low
and high concentrations were associated with high all-cause mortality
(Figure 2). The association between extreme high HDL cholesterol
and high mortality was most pronounced for men. The concentration
of HDL cholesterol associated with the lowest all-cause mortality in
men was 1.9 mmol/L (95% CI: 1.4–2.0 mmol/L) (73 mg/dL (54–77 mg/
dL)) in age and study adjusted analyses, 1.9mmol/L (1.4–2.0 mmol/L)
(73 mg/dL (54–77mg/dL)) in age, study, and triglyceride adjusted ana-
lyses, and 1.9 mmol/L (1.1–2.0 mmol/L) (73 mg/dL (42–77mg/dL)) in
multifactorially adjusted analyses. For women the corresponding con-
centrations of HDL cholesterol associated with the lowest all-cause
mortality were 2.4mmol/L (1.8–2.5mmol/L) (93 mg/dL (69–97 mg/
dL)), 2.4mmol/L (1.8–2.5 mmol/L) (93 mg/dL (69–97mg/dL)), and
2.4 mmol/L (1.7–6.2mmol/L) (93 mg/dL (66–239 mg/dL)), respect-
ively. For the multifactorially adjusted analyses in women the upper
CI limit could not be definitively determined.
Similar to restricted cubic spline analyses, a U-shaped association
between HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality was seen in both
sexes using concentration cut points (Figure 3). Men with HDL chol-
esterol
of
2.5–2.99 mmol/L
(97–115mg/dL)
and
>
_3.0mmol/L
(116 mg/dL) had multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios of 1.36 (95%
CI: 1.09–1.70) and 2.06 (1.44–2.95) when compared with men in
the reference group (1.5–1.99 mmol/L (58–76 mg/dL)). Men with
HDL cholesterol <1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) had a corresponding
hazard ratio of 1.27 (1.12–1.45). Women with HDL cholesterol
of 3.0–3.49 mmol/L (116–134mg/dL), >
_3.5 mmol/L (135mg/dL)
and <1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) had hazard ratios for all-cause mortality
of 1.10 (0.83–1.46), 1.68 (1.09–2.58) and 1.78 (1.43–2.22), respect-
ively, when compared with the reference group (2.0–2.49 mmol/L
(77–96 mg/dL)).
In percentile-based analyses, multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios
for all-cause mortality for the top percentile (100th) were 1.94
(1.47–2.55) for men and 1.36 (0.99–1.85) for women, when com-
pared with men and women in the reference groups (81st–95th
percentile).
HDL cholesterol and cause-specific
mortality
A U-shaped association between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascu-
lar mortality was also seen for both men and women (Figure 4). For
cancer mortality, lower concentrations of HDL cholesterol were
associated with high risk in both sexes. Risk of other mortality
showed a U-shaped association with HDL cholesterol in men, but no
association in women. These findings were confirmed when using
concentration cut points (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
The extreme high HDL group in both men and women had high car-
diovascular mortality with multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios of
2.53 (95% CI: 1.24–5.18) and 2.89 (1.33–6.24), respectively, com-
pared with men and women in the reference groups. For cancer

1.33 (0.56–3.19), and for other mortality 1.90 (0.95–3.82) and 1.51
(0.66–3.46), for men and women, respectively.
HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular
disease
For cardiovascular disease endpoints ischaemic heart disease and
myocardial infarction, a high risk was observed for low concentra-
tions of HDL cholesterol (Figure 5). There was a plateau around HDL
cholesterol of 1.5 mmol/L (58 mg/dL) and 2.0mmol/L (77 mg/dL) for
men and women, respectively, with no further decrease in risk with
concentrations of HDL cholesterol higher than that. No significant in-
crease in these risks were observed with extreme high concentra-
tions of HDL cholesterol. For ischaemic stroke similar patterns of
association were observed.
Sensitivity analyses
Results from complete-case analyses including only individuals with
complete information on all covariates were similar to analyses using
the full dataset (compare Figure 3 with Supplementary material
online, Figure S3). Individuals included in the main analyses were com-
bined from two independent studies; however, results were similar
for the two studies separately (compare Figure 3 with Supplementary
material online, Figure S4). Hence, we were able to obtain confirm-
ation of the results in two independent studies.
Results for the extreme high HDL cholesterol group vs. the refer-
ence group were robust across different strata of risk factors for all-
cause mortality and medication use affecting all-cause mortality
(Supplementary material online, Figures S5 and S6). However, number
of individuals and events were small in some extreme groups in strati-
fied analyses generating risk estimates with wide CIs. There was,
however, no clear evidence for statistical interaction in the stratified
analyses.
To assess possible effects of reverse causation from severe disease
likely leading to death and high HDL cholesterol, we examined asso-
ciation with all-cause mortality for the extreme high HDL vs. the ref-
erence group excluding individuals with less than 1 to 5 years of
follow-up (Supplementary material online, Figure S7). Overall hazard
ratios were similar, except for a slight attenuation for women when
excluding those with less than 4 and 5 years of follow-up, indicating
Figure 4 HDL cholesterol on a continuous scale and risk of cardiovascular, cancer, and other mortality in the general population. Based on 52 268
men and 64 240 women from the Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study combined. Hazard ratio (solid line)

that results were not caused by reverse causation. Analyses of cause-
specific mortality using underlying cause of death resulted in more
deaths being classified as other mortality, however, results were simi-
lar to the primary analyses (compare Figure 4 with Supplementary
material online, Figure S8).
Discussion
In this study of 116 508 individuals from the general population, the
association between HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality was U-
shaped, with both extreme high and low HDL cholesterol concentra-
tions being associated with high mortality (Summarizing Figure). The
same was observed in men with moderately elevated HDL choles-
terol. The HDL cholesterol concentration associated with the lowest
risk of all-cause mortality was 1.9 mmol/L (73 mg/dL) for men, and
2.4 mmol/L (93 mg/dL) for women, which are novel findings.
A possible explanation for the association between extreme high
HDL cholesterol and higher mortality is that extreme high concen-
trations often are due to genetic variants.19 Genetic variants may
have detrimental effects causing high risk of disease and death, which
is the case for certain mutations in CETP, ABCA1, LIPC, and SCARB1,
which are associated with both high risk of coronary heart disease
and high concentrations of HDL cholesterol.6–8,10 These studies,
done mainly in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, only overlap with
10–20% of individuals included in the present study, where the ma-
jority of individuals were from the Copenhagen General Population
Study. The observed associations in this study could also be an epi-
phenomenon where there is a pathophysiologic abnormality, perhaps
genetic, which increases risk in ways we do not understand and also
increases HDL, suggesting that the physiology of HDL is complex and
perhaps not well understood. Conformation and functional proper-
ties of the HDL particle may also be altered in individuals with ex-
treme high HDL cholesterol and an alternative hypothesis could be
that in individuals with extreme high HDL cholesterol, the functional-
ity of HDL may be compromised such that HDL no longer function
normally but rather cause harm. Another possible explanation in-
cludes differences in risk factors associated with both high HDL chol-
esterol and mortality. Although our multifactorially adjusted analyses
included the most important risk factors for all-cause mortality,20

torially adjusted for age, study, body mass index, current smoking, cumulative tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, systolic blood
pressure, diabetes mellitus, lipid-lowering therapy, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, birth year, and menopausal status and hormone replacement ther-
apy for women. The HDL cholesterol concentration associated with the lowest risk was used as reference, except for the endpoint ischaemic stroke
in men, where the median value was used as the lowest risk was observed at the extreme high end. Graphs were truncated at 0.4 and 4.0 mmol/L
due to limited number of individuals and events outside these cutpoints. The light blue area indicates the distribution of HDL cholesterol concentra-
tions in men and women. CI, confidence interval; HDL, high-density lipoprotein.

residual confounding cannot be discarded completely. Whether the
association between extreme high HDL cholesterol and increased
mortality is causal is an important unresolved question in relation to
the findings in this study.
Most observational studies investigating the association between
HDL cholesterol and mortality have categorized individuals in larger
groups, such as quintiles, and focus has been on low concentrations of
HDL cholesterol, thereby failing to elucidate associations at extreme
high concentrations. Two recently published studies based on routinely
collected health data support our findings, as they indicated that the as-
sociation between HDL cholesterol and mortality is not linear over the
entire concentration range of HDL cholesterol.21,22 Specifically, in the
study by Ko et al. age-standardized all-cause mortality was lowest in the
strata of HDL cholesterol from 51 to 70mg/dL (1.3–1.8mmol/L; 7.2/
1000 person-years) in men and from 61 to 70mg/dL (1.6–1.8mmol/L;
5.6/1000 person-years) in women, and all-cause mortality increased to
12.1/1000 person-years in men with HDL cholesterol >90mg/dL
(>2.3mmol/L) and to 6.8/1000 person-years in women with HDL
cholesterol >90mg/dL (>2.3mmol/L). The study by Bowe et al.
showed a similar U-shaped association between all-cause mortality and
HDL cholesterol in men, with the lowest risk at HDL cholesterol of
30–50mg/dL (0.8–1.3mmol/L). However, both studies were based on
selected populations as individuals were included because they had a
previous contact with the health care system that included obtainment
of a lipid panel, and either focused on men and the association between
HDL cholesterol and mortality as modified by kidney function, or
excluded individuals with cardiovascular disease and other comorbid-
ities. Hence, results of these studies are not necessarily representative
for the general population.
Results from this study may have clinical implications for individuals
with extreme high concentrations of HDL cholesterol. First, when
HDL cholesterol is used for risk assessment, clinicians should be
aware that those with extreme high HDL cholesterol may be a high-
risk group for all-cause mortality. Current guidelines recommend
measuring HDL cholesterol for risk estimation and before initiation of
lipid-lowering therapy.23 Our results indicate that the common belief
that, the higher the concentration of HDL cholesterol the better,
does not hold for extreme high concentrations, as the relationship be-
tween HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality was not linear over
the entire range of HDL concentrations. Secondly, if the association
between extreme high HDL cholesterol and high risk of death is
causal, these findings would add to the uncertainty regarding elevating
HDL cholesterol pharmacologically to extreme high concentrations.
Some of the developed CETP inhibitors can increase HDL cholesterol
to extreme high concentrations,24 that in this study were associated
with higher mortality. Interestingly, the development of the CETP in-
hibitor torcetrapib was discontinued as it increased mortality, al-
though this could be due to off-target effects.5 However, the present
findings point toward an alternative explanation, namely that extreme
high HDL cholesterol could in itself be the cause of high mortality.
As this study was observational, it could not determine if the associ-
ation between extreme high HDL cholesterol and higher mortality
was causal. The association may be due to unmeasured confounding
or reverse causation. However, results from analyses excluding indi-
viduals dying within the first 1 to 5 years of follow-up did not seem to
indicate reverse causation. Another limitation was the relative rarity
of extremely high HDL concentrations; however, the �2.5% of men
with the highest HDL cholesterol were all at increased risk of mortal-
ity. Despite the very large number of individuals included in this study,
numbers in extreme high HDL cholesterol groups were small, limiting
statistical power, especially in stratified analyses and in analyses of
cause-specific mortality, and affecting model fit at these extremes.
Finally, as we only included white individuals of Danish descent, results
may not necessarily be generalizable to other geographical regions or
ethnicities; however, we are unaware of studies indicating that the
present findings would not apply elsewhere and in other ethnicities.
A primary strength of the present study is the large number of pro-
spectively recruited individuals from the general population. Second,
we investigated the full range of HDL cholesterol concentrations,
using both splines and categories based on concentrations and per-
centiles. Third, we had detailed information on several confounders
with known effect on mortality. Fourth, use of the Danish registries
ensured complete follow-up and complete information on death.
Last, in the main analyses, data from two studies was combined to ob-
tain maximum statistical power; however, results were similar in the
Summarizing Figure HDL cholesterol and risk of all-cause
mortality in the general population. Based on 52 268 men and 64
240 women from the Copenhagen General Population Study and
the Copenhagen City Heart Study combined. Hazard ratio (solid
line) and 95% confidence interval (dashed lines) from age and study
adjusted Cox regression using restricted cubic splines. The concen-
tration of HDL cholesterol associated with lowest mortality was
used as reference. The light blue area indicates the distribution of
HDL cholesterol concentrations in men and women. CI, confidence
interval; HDL, high-density lipoprotein.

two studies separately. This indicates that the findings are robust, as
they were confirmed in two independent cohorts, with inclusion of
individuals in two different time periods.
Conclusions
The association between HDL cholesterol concentrations and all-
cause mortality was U-shaped, and men and women from the general
population with extreme high HDL cholesterol had high all-cause
mortality. This was most pronounced in men, and for cardiovascular
mortality. These findings need confirmation in future studies.
