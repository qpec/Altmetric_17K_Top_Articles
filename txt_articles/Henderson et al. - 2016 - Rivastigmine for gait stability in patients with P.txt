Introduction
Falls are a common and devastating event in individuals 
with Parkinson’s disease. Prospective studies report that 
70% of people with Parkinson’s disease have at least one 
fall in a year and 39% fall recurrently;1 median survival in 
patients that have recurrent falls is 6 years.2 Even in those 
who have not previously fallen, 21% will fall in the next 
3 months.3 Consequences of falls include fractures and 
injury,4 fear of future falls,5 hospital admission,6 and 
increased caregiver burden,7 with falls cited as one of the 
worst aspects of the disease.8 Despite increased 
understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies risk 
of falls, few effi
  cacious interventions are available. There 
is therefore an urgent and unmet need to identify 
eff
 ective treatment strategies.
Parkinson’s disease is associated with slowing of gait 
due to reductions in step length9 and a loss of gait 
automaticity, manifesting as increased gait variability.9–11

Summary
Background Falls are a frequent and serious complication of Parkinson’s disease and are related partly to an underlying 
cholinergic defi
 cit that contributes to gait and cognitive dysfunction in these patients. Gait dysfunction can lead to an 
increased variability of gait from one step to another, raising the likelihood of falls. In the ReSPonD trial we aimed to 
assess whether ameliorating this cholinergic defi
 cit with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine would reduce 
gait variability.
Methods We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial at the North Bristol NHS Trust 
Hospital, Bristol, UK, in patients with Parkinson’s disease recruited from community and hospital settings in the UK. 
We included patients who had fallen at least once in the year before enrolment, were able to walk 18 m without an aid, 
had no previous exposure to an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and did not have dementia. Our clinical trials unit 
randomly assigned (1:1) patients to oral rivastigmine or placebo capsules (both taken twice a day) using a computer-
generated randomisation sequence and web-based allocation. Rivastigmine was uptitrated from 3 mg per day to the 
target dose of 12 mg per day over 12 weeks. Both the trial team and patients were masked to treatment allocation. 
Masking was achieved with matched placebo capsules and a dummy uptitration schedule. The primary endpoint was 
diff
 erence in step time variability between the two groups at 32 weeks, adjusted for baseline age, cognition, step time 
variability, and number of falls in the previous year. We measured step time variability with a triaxial accelerometer 
during an 18 m walking task in three conditions: normal walking, simple dual task with phonemic verbal fl
 uency 
(walking while naming words beginning with a single letter), and complex dual task switching with phonemic verbal 
fl
 uency (walking while naming words, alternating between two letters of the alphabet). Analysis was by modifi
 ed 
intention to treat; we excluded from the primary analysis patients who withdrew, died, or did not attend the 32 week 
assessment. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 19880883.
Findings Between Oct 4, 2012 and March 28, 2013, we enrolled 130 patients and randomly assigned 65 to the 
rivastigmine group and 65 to the placebo group. At week 32, compared with patients assigned to placebo (59 assessed), 
those assigned to rivastigmine (55 assessed) had improved step time variability for normal walking (ratio of geometric 
means 0·72, 95% CI 0·58–0·88; p=0·002) and the simple dual task (0·79; 0·62–0·99; p=0·045). Improvements in 
step time variability for the complex dual task did not diff
 er between groups (0·81, 0·60–1·09; p=0·17). Gastrointestinal 
side-eff
 ects were more common in the rivastigmine group than in the placebo group (p<0·0001); 20 (31%) patients in 
the rivastigmine group versus three (5%) in the placebo group had nausea and 15 (17%) versus three (5%) had 
vomiting.
Interpretation Rivastigmine can improve gait stability and might reduce the frequency of falls. A phase 3 study is 
needed to confi
 rm these fi
 ndings and show cost-eff
 ectiveness of rivastigmine treatment.

results in a highly unstable gait and falls become more 
likely. Therefore, gait variability serves as a marker of fall 
risk in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, as well as in 
those with Alzheimer’s disease12 and in older adults.13 To 
compensate for the reduced gait stability, people with 
Parkinson’s disease need additional attentional cognitive 
resource.14,15 Higher demands on attention are made when 
negotiating complex walking environments or when 
walking while undertaking concurrent cognitive tasks. 
When attentional demands outweigh capacity, gait 
performance and ability to do concurrent tasks, or both, 
are impaired. Dysexecutive syndrome in Parkinson’s 
disease16 adds to this problem in that attentional resources 
are inappropriately prioritised away from gait and towards 
concurrent 
tasks.17 
Postural 
stability 
is 
therefore 
compromised in situations in which concurrent motor 
and cognitive demands compete for limited and impaired 
attentional resource; consequently falls occur.18 Dual task 
paradigms that explore this cognitive-motor interface 
have revealed strong associations between gait variability 
and disease severity,14,19 complexity of dual tasks,20 
cognitive defi
 cits,19,21 and history of falls.10,11,22
An underlying loss of cholinergic function contributes 
to freezing23 and other gait changes, postural instability, 
and cognitive dysfunction.24 The increasing importance of 
the role of the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus 
(PPN) in gait and falls has been shown by neuroimaging,25,26 
lesioning,27 and deep-brain stimulation studies.28 Not only 
is Parkinson’s disease associated with loss of cholinergic 
cell bodies in the PPN,25 but also cholinergic output loss in 
the thalamus (the main target for cholinergic projection 
from the PPN) is greater in individuals who fall than in 
non-fallers.26 Similarly, cholinergic loss in the nucleus 
basalis of Meynert, which projects to the cortex,29 is 
purported to contribute to cognitive dysfunction in 
Parkinson’s disease. The resultant impairment of 
attention aff
 ects the successful execution of complex 
motor behaviours; in rats a dual dopaminergic–cholinergic 
hit seems to confer propensity to falls during complex 
motor movement.30 The cholinergic defi
 cit that contributes 
to gait and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease 
provides a rationale on which to base and target drug 
treatment. We hypothesised that treatment with an 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would improve gait stability 
and therefore prevent falls in people with Parkinson’s 
disease. Here we aimed to assess whether this hypothesis 
was correct in patients that had fallen in the last year.
Methods
Study design and participants
We carried out this randomised placebo-controlled, 
double-blind, parallel-arm, trial at North Bristol NHS 
Trust Hospital, Bristol, UK. The protocol has been 
published previously.31 Patients were eligible if they had 
moderate (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2–3) idiopathic 
Parkinson’s disease (diagnosed by a movement disorder 
specialist) and had been stable (no drug adjustments 
needed) on antiparkinsonian drugs for 2 weeks before 
enrolment. Patients were taking dopaminergic drugs, 
along with a wide range of drugs for comorbidities. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for randomised controlled trials with 
“Parkinson disease” and “cholinesterase inhibitors” as MeSH 
terms and without any language or date restrictions. We 
identifi
 ed 20 studies, of which fi
 ve reported a fall-related 
outcome. Only one randomised crossover trial sought to 
determine the eff
 ect of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 
donepezil, on falls in Parkinson’s disease (Chung et al, 2010). In 
this trial, 23 patients who reported falling or near-falling more 
than two times a week were given donepezil or placebo for 
6 weeks and then crossed over. Donepezil treatment was 
associated with a reduction in fall rate from 0·25 falls per day 
on placebo to 0·13 falls per day on donepezil (p=0·49). 
However, frequent fallers drove the observed benefi
 t and the 
fi
 nding was reported only in patients who had adhered to the 
protocol. The study was small and of short duration. Two 
randomised controlled trials of rivastigmine versus placebo 
reported falls as adverse events. Both reported lower 
proportions of falls occurring in the acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitor groups than in the placebo groups (seven [3%] of 
211 vs nine [7%] of 123 patients; and 21 (6%) of 362 vs 11 (6%) 
of 179 patients), although in both studies the absolute 
numbers were small. One study reported that galantamine was 
associated with a decrease in falls, freezing, and gait domains of 
the Unifi
 ed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Another trial 
stated that “increased number of falls” contributed to 
withdrawal of a participant. 
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst randomised controlled trial to 
examine the eff
 ect of rivastigmine on gait stability and falls in 
Parkinson’s disease. Rivastigmine improved measures of gait 
stability and reduced fall frequency in people with Parkinson’s 
disease without dementia. Rivastigmine is already licensed for 
Parkinson’s disease dementia, hence its effi
  cacy to enhance 
cognition is established, along with its tolerability and safety 
profi
 le. Our trial design provides some insight into the 
mechanisms by which rivastigmine improves gait and reduces 
fall rates, and might inform future interventions and trial 
designs.
Implications of all available evidence
These fi
 ndings support the role for acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors in ameliorating gait dysfunction and fall prevention 
in Parkinson’s disease. These fi
 ndings need to be reproduced in 
a large phase 3 trial with falls as the primary outcome measure 
and that will collect evidence on cost-eff
 ectiveness.

Patients had to demonstrate the ability to walk 18 m 
without a walking aid and had to have reported at least one 
fall in the previous year; the best predictor of future falls.3 
Patients were excluded if they did not speak English; had 
an absolute contraindication to, or had previously taken, 
acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors; 
or 
had 
any 
other 
neurological, visual, or orthopaedic problem that 
meaningfully interfered with gait. We excluded patients 
with dementia, classifi
 ed using the Movement Disorder 
Society Task Force defi
 nition of decreased cognition of 
suffi
  cient severity to impair daily life.32 
We recruited participants from community and 
hospital settings in the UK (mostly in southeast England). 
Patient Identifi
 cation Centres were set-up to identify 
patients in other local centres and Dementias and 
Neurodegenerative 
Diseases 
Research 
Network 
(DeNDRoN) nurses did pre-screening of potential 
participants in hospital clinics. We also recruited 
participants from the Parkinson’s Register of the 
Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research 
Network 
(ProDeNDRoN) 
database 
and 
the 
trial 
recruitment details were publicised via the Parkinson’s 
UK charity research network and local media. All 
participants gave written informed consent.
Ethics approval was granted by the South West Research 
Ethics Committee on Sept 28, 2011, and a Clinical Trial 
Authorisation granted from the Medicines and Healthcare 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on June 18, 2012. 
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral rivastigmine 
or placebo capsules matched to those for rivastigmine in 
colour and weight. We intended to randomise using a 
minimisation approach; however, during recruitment 
and while assignments remained blinded, it became 
apparent that a technical problem with the randomisation 
system (human error) had led to participants being 
randomised using simple randomisation. We therefore 
chose to continue with simple randomisation because 
the anticipated sample size (>100 people) would most 
likely result in balance between known and unknown 
confounders. Participants were enrolled and tested by an 
investigator who had no access to the randomisation 
sequence, which was computer generated by the Bristol 
Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC) clinical trials 
unit using a web-based program and accessed by the 
research team via a secure webpage. A treatment pack 
number was issued via a secure website that matched 
the number to a drug pack held in the pharmacy to 
ensure concealment of allocation. We assessed whether 
participants were aware of their treatment group status 
by asking them at the 32 week follow-up visit to guess 
which treatment they had received.
Procedures
A full description of the assessments used in the trial is 
in the published protocol.31 Baseline measures of general 
health status and sociodemographics were recorded by 
EJH. We assessed gait and balance, cognition, mood, and 
fall risk factors at baseline (pre-treatment) and at the end 
of the 32 week treatment period. We measured 
occurrence of falls with use of monthly falls diaries, 
which patients posted monthly to the investigators. We 
telephoned participants every month to corroborate fall 
information, titrate medication, and to record adverse 
events. Our methods were consistent with guidelines 
from the Prevention of Falls Network Europe,33 which 
recommend 
“prospective 
daily 
recording 
and 
a 
notifi
 cation system with a minimum of monthly 
reporting” and the use of telephone interviews for 
verifi
 cation.
For assessment of the primary endpoint, participants 
were asked at the baseline and 32 week visit to walk along 
a 22 m, fl
 at, outdoor, covered walkway while wearing a 
triaxial accelerometer (DynaPort Hybrid, McRoberts, 
Netherlands). Patients were assessed in the on-drug state 
in repect to their standard dopaminergic drugs. The 
middle 18 m, marked by external triggers, was used to 
assess steady state walking performance. We used three 
conditions: normal walking, simple dual task with 
phonemic verbal fl
 uency (walking while naming words 
beginning 
with 
a 
single 
letter), 
and 
complex 
dual task switching with phonemic verbal fl
 uency 
(walking while naming words, alternating between two 
letters of the alphabet). Each condition was done three 
times, yielding nine walks in total, to ensure accurate 
assessment of gait performance. Using a computer-
generated random list generated by BRTC we randomly 
ordered the conditions to minimise fatigue and practice 
eff
 ects. Gait analysis used accepted standards known to 
be sensitive to both a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease34 
and predictive of falls.35 
Rivastigmine (or equivalent as placebo) dose was 
started at 3 mg per day (1·5 mg tablet taken twice a day) 
and was uptitrated in 3 mg per day (or placebo) 
increments every 4 weeks to a maximum of 12 mg per 
day at week 13 onwards. Participants were given suffi
  cient 
capsules of all four strengths (1·5 mg, 3 mg, 4·5 mg and 
6 mg rivastigmine or matched placebo) for the study 
period and were advised on which to take by the trial 
team (overseen by EJH) via telephone. Identical titration 
was performed for those taking placebo to maintain 
masking. The highest tolerated dose was maintained for 
the following 16 week period, yielding a total treatment 
period of 32 weeks. Participants were instructed to 
downtitrate to the last tolerated dose or stop the drug, 
which was decided according to clinical judgment when 
unacceptable side-eff
 ects occurred. 
Surveillance for adverse events took place over 
12 months, which included the 4 months beyond the 
intervention period to detect any events with a prolonged 
latency. Patients were provided with a leafl
 et detailing 
potential side-eff
 ects and could telephone the study team 
to report adverse events at any time. Blinded researchers

established seriousness, causality, intensity, expectedness, 
and severity of adverse events according to established 
criteria36 and events were coded post hoc using the 
MedDRA dictionary, version 17
.1.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was diff
 erence in step time 
variability between the two groups at 32 weeks and 
adjusted for baseline age, cognition, step time variability, 
and number of falls in the previous year. Secondary 
outcomes were the rate per month of falls defi
 ned as an 
unexpected event in which participants come to rest on the 
ground, fl
 oor, or lower level,33 and functional mobility 
through gait speed in each condition (time taken to walk 
the 18 m). Other pre-specifi
 ed secondary outcomes were 
fall risk (Physiological Profi
 le Assessment falls risk score); 
fear of falling (short-form Iconographical Falls Effi
  cacy 
Scale [ICON-FES] total score); controlled leaning balance; 
episodes of freezing of gait in the past month; cognition 
and mood (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] total 
score, Frontal Assessment Battery total score, Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS-15) total score, and Cognitive 
Failures Questionnaire total score); disease severity (via 
Movement Disorder Society-Unifi
 ed Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] total score); levodopa dose;37 
and quality of life (measured by EuroQol’s EQ-5D-5L and 
described in the visual analogue score and index score, 
derived using Offi
  ce of Health Economics UK value set38). 
Statistical analysis
We had little evidence to guide the power calculation 
since no data were available on the eff
 ect of rivastigmine 
on step time variability. A sample size of 130 was chosen 
on the basis of an anticipated 30% drop-out rate,39 
resulting in about 90 patients (45 per arm). This sample 
size would enable a treatment eff
 ect diff
 erence of 
0·6 standardised (Z score) units for the primary outcome 
measure to be detected with 80% power and at a 
two-sided 5% signifi
 cance level. This sample size was 
similar to that used in a study of patients without 
Parkinson’s disease but with mild cognitive impairment.40
Gait variability was assessed using the SD of step times. 
We established step time from consecutive heel strike 
peaks in the acceleration trace. We calculated the SD of 
step times for each walk and used the mean of these SDs 
across all three walks, for each condition, as the primary 
endpoint of step time variability in the statistical analysis. 
We specifi
 ed the SD of step times and not the SD of stride 
times because it includes assessment of within-stride gait 
asymmetry in people with Parkinson’s disease and 
provides more data points, which enables more reliable 
measurement of gait variability (appendix).41
The primary analysis was done in a modifi
 ed intention-
to-treat population, whereby we included all patients 
except those who withdrew, did not attend assessment, 
or died. Secondary analyses were done in participants in 
the modifi
 ed intention-to-treat population from whom 
data were available. Adverse event and safety analyses 
were done in the full trial population. 
When outcomes were positively skewed (primary 
outcome included) we log-transformed the outcome, 
hence the coeffi
  cients from our models represent the 
proportional change (geometric ratio means) in 
outcome between the treated and placebo groups. The 
percentage reduction was calculated by 100 – geometric 
ratio mean. When transformation could not achieve 
normality, we categorised data and used ordinal logistic 
regression models. We used multivariable linear models 
to adjust for a-priori specifi
 ed determinants of gait 
variability measured at baseline (centred around the 
mean if appropriate); age, cognitive function (MoCA), 
previous falls (ordinal variable 1, 2–3, 4–6, 7–19, ≥20) 
and baseline log step time variability.
For the primary outcome, we did pre-specifi
 ed 
subgroup analyses for age group, cognitive function 
(MoCA), and Parkinson’s disease duration, measured as 
time in years from onset of fi

multivariable regression models. We made no formal 
correction for multiple testing. We used negative 
binomial regression for the analysis of fall rates as 
recommended,42 because these data are known to cluster 
within individuals and an initial exploratory model using 
Poisson regression confi
 rmed that the data were 
over-dispersed. We used the same covariates as for the 
primary outcome analysis for the falls analysis. Where 
data could not be transformed to meet the assumptions 
of normality it was categorised (appendix). We use 
descriptive statistics to report adverse events from all 
patients, irrespective of medication and protocol 
adherence. A planned sensitivity analysis of the primary 
outcome was done with use of multiple imputation for 
missing data. All analyses were done with Stata 
version 13.1.
We did not convene a data monitoring committee 
because rivastigmine is in widespread use. However, 
an independent advisor (a clinical academic) was 
appointed to review all serious adverse events 
(unblinded if necessary) and advise the trial team. The 
trial was registered with ISRCTN, 19880883; WHO 
universal trial number U1111–1124–0244.
Role of the funding source
The funder (Parkinson’s UK) had no role in the study 
design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, 
or writing of the report. Novartis provided feedback 
about the dosing of the trial drug, but had no other input 
into the design or implementation of the study and did 
not participate in preparing this manuscript for 
publication. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data and had fi
 nal responsibility to submit for 
publication.
Results
Between Oct 4, 2012, to March 28, 2013, we enrolled 
130 patients, randomly assigning 65 to the rivastigmine 
group and 65 to the placebo group (fi
 gure 1). Baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics were similar 
between groups, although there were more women in the 
rivastigmine group and the daily levodopa equivalent dose 
was higher in the placebo group (table 1). Of the 
130 participants enrolled, three died, four withdrew, and 
three were too unwell to attend the 32 week assessment. 
One additional participant provided some verbal outcome 
data via telephone.
We assessed 59 patients in the placebo group and 55 in 
the rivastigmine group for step time variability; some 
patients were excluded from certain conditions because 
they were unable to complete the walk or because of 
problems with the accelerometry data (fi
 gure 1). Step 
time variability was 28% lower (geometric mean ratio 
0·72, 95% CI 0·58–0·89; p=0·002) in the normal walking 
task and 21% lower (0·79, 0·62–0·99; p=0·045) during 
the simple dual task in those assigned to rivastigmine 
compared with those assigned to placebo (table 2). The 
19% improvement in step time variability shown in the 
rivastigmine group during the complex dual task was not 
signifi
 cant (0·81, 0·60–1·09; p=0·17). There was no 
evidence of any eff
 ect modifi
 cation with age, cognition, 
or disease duration in any of the three walking conditions 
(all interaction p>0·05), although we recognise that these 
analyses were probably underpowered to detect a 
diff
 erence. In a sensitivity analysis with multiple imputed 
datasets for missing data (appendix) the results for 
normal walking became more conservative (geometric 
mean ratio 0·77, 95% CI 0·61–0·97; 0·027) and the 
diff
 erence between the groups in the simple dual task 
was no longer signifi
 cant (0·84, 0·65–1·07; p=0·15).
One participant in the rivastigmine group had an 
extremely high number of falls (1122 falls during the 
treatment period) and so was removed from the analysis 
of fall rate. Median fall rate in the rivastigmine group 
(n=64; one outlier excluded) was 0·50 (IQR 0·14–0·89), 
compared with 1·14 (0·27–2·6) in the placebo group 
(n=65; fi
 gure 2). After adjustment for age, baseline 
cognition (MoCA score), falls in the previous year

(quintiles 1, 2–3, 4–6, 7–19, ≥20), and baseline step time 
variability during normal walking, participants in the 
rivastigmine group had a reduction of 45% in the rate 
of falls per month (table 3). We did two post-hoc 
sensitivity analyses to account for exclusion of the 
outlier from the calculation of fall rate. We repeated the 
negative binomial regression model but including the 
outlier, who was assigned the next highest value of falls 
(number of falls plus one of next highest participant in 
that group). The adjusted diff
 erence in fall rate 
remained signifi
 cant (incident rate ratio 0·58, 95% CI 
0·58–0·85; p=0·005; appendix). Using multinomial 
logistic regression, fall rates were categorised as low, 
intermediate, high, or very high, with the outlier in the 
very 
high 
category 
(appendix). 
Treatment 
with 
rivastigmine was associated with a reduced chance of 
being in the high fall rate or very high fall rate categories 
compared with the low fall rate category (appendix). On 
visual inspection, fall rates increased over time in the 
placebo group, but not in the rivastigmine group 
(fi
 gure 3). 
Rivastigmine was associated with a small but 
signifi
 cant improvement in gait speed in all three task 
conditions, with the greatest eff
 ect seen in normal 
walking (table 3). Improvements in controlled leaning 
balance were present in the rivastigmine group (more 
people in the rivastigmine group belonged to the low 
score group [good performance] vs medium and high 
score groups [poorer performance]; table 3). All other 
secondary outcomes—ie, fall risk, fear of falling, 
freezing of gait in the past month, cognition and mood 
measures, disease severity, levodopa requirement, and 
quality of life measures—did not diff
 er between patients 
assigned 
to 
rivastigmine 
and 
those 
assigned 
to placebo (table 3).
At 32 week follow-up or withdrawal, 39 (60%) of 
65 participants in the rivastigmine group versus 46 (71%) 
of 65 participants in the placebo group were still taking the 
study drug. Three participants in the rivastigmine group 
stopped for reasons not related to adverse events 
(participant choice, n=2; additional drug started that was 
contraindicated with rivastigmine, n=1); all other stoppages 
(n=23 in rivastigmine group, n=19 in placebo group) were 
due to adverse events. At 32 weeks, participants in the 
placebo group were taking a higher median treatment 
dose per day (10·0 mg, IQR 6·0–10·5) than were those in 
the rivastigmine group (6·3 mg, 2·7–8·7).
We did a post-hoc analysis to assess masking success 
using Bang’s Blinding Index.43 The null value of the 
Bang Blinding Index is 0, with a value greater than 0 
representing failure in masking and a value lower than 
0 suggesting that the failure in blinding is reversed. 
Bang’s blinding index was 0·6 (95% CI 0·8–0·3) for the 
rivastigmine group and 0·2 (95% CI 0·4–0·0) for the 
placebo group, indicating that more participants in the 
rivastigmine group guessed their allocation correctly 
than would be expected by chance.
During the treatment period, 2184 adverse events 
occurred, of which 1875 were falls (1197 falls in placebo 
group, 678 falls in rivastigmine group). 27 adverse events 
were classifi
 ed as serious (14 in the rivastigmine group 
and 13 in the placebo group; appendix). Of the 14 serious 
adverse events that occurred in the rivastigmine group, 
only two were assessed as being probably or defi
 nitely 
related to the treatment, both of which were worsening 
of parkinsonism. About a third of participants in the 
rivastigmine group experienced nausea (n=20 [31%]; 
table 4), which was similar to the reported frequency of 
nausea with rivastigmine in a larger clinical trial.39 Nearly

three-times more participants assigned to rivastigmine 
(11 [17%]) than to placebo (n=3 [15%]) had vomiting. Most 
adverse events were considered to be mild (1175 [89%] of 
1319 events in rivastigmine group; 663 [77%] of 865 
events in placebo group) and unrelated to the 
interventions (778 [90%] of 865; 1302 [99%] of 1319). 
Three deaths occurred; all were unrelated to the trial 
drug—one patient each died from known malignancy, 
peritonitis, 
and 
previously 
unknown 
pancreatic 
malignancy. No adverse events that we considered to be 
related to the study drug occurred between end of the 
treatment period and the 52 week follow-up. 
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst trial to show that 
rivastigmine can improve gait stability and might 
reduce falls in patients with Parkinson’s disease, and 
has acceptable tolerability and safety consistent with 
previous work. Because we did not adjust for multiple 
testing, the benefi
 cial eff
 ect on step time variability for 
the simple cognitive task should be interpreted with 
caution and a sensitivity analysis with an imputed 
dataset rendered this association not signifi
 cant.

recom 
mendations to reduce fall risk were published in 
2014 but with a small evidence base.44 Acknowledging the 
multifactorial aetiology of falls, guidance advocates 
targeting interventions at age-specifi
 c and disease-specifi
 c 
risk factors. Early trials of physiotherapy based 
interventions were hampered by inadequate power and 
heterogeneity of the intervention delivered. However, 
trials of strength, balance, and cueing therapy in early 
disease45 and of Tai chi46 have shown signifi
 cant reductions 
in fall rates (69% and 67%, respectively). The eff
 ect of 
deep-brain stimulation on gait, balance, and falls has 
produced confl
 icting results.47 Extrapolation of results 
from these studies is limited by the small sample sizes, 
diff
 erent targets, and the insuffi
  cient detail involved in 
reporting falls outcomes from the Unifi
 ed Parkinson’s 
Disease 
Rating 
Scale 
(UPDRS) 
part

item. 
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment with donepezil 
was shown to reduce falls frequency in a cross-over trial 
of 23 patients.48 Although this eff
 ect appears to be driven 
by individuals who fell most frequently, this result is 
congruent with our fi
 ndings and supports the potential 
role for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in decreasing falls 
in Parkinson’s disease.
The benefi
 t of rivastigmine treatment on falls is likely to 
have resulted from improvement in gait variability, 
velocity, and balance. This gain might or might not be 
mediated via improved cognition, specifi
 cally improved 
attention to compensate for impaired gait resulting from 
striatal dopaminergic loss, or via a direct eff
 ect on gait.27,30 
Future analysis is needed to assess the mechanism of 
cognitive–gait 
interference, 
especially 
whether 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment ameliorates loss 
of attentional resource or whether it refocuses attentional 
priority to gait and movement control.49 The apparent 
absence of signifi
 cant improvement in the secondary 
measures of cognitive and executive function could have 
resulted 
from 
insensitivity 
of 
the 
measurement 
instruments in our population, which was not cognitively 
impaired. Additionally, these fi
 ndings might have been a 
type 2 error because previous randomised controlled trials 
that have showed a benefi
 t at treating patients with 
Parkinson’s disease dementia were much larger in size.39
The high number of adverse events in both groups 
likely refl
 ects the high burden of comorbidity seen in our 
older cohort, coupled with the fact that patients were 
primed and screened monthly for adverse events. The 
observed profi
 le of adverse events is similar to that 
shown in previous reports and only a small proportion of 
the total events were likely to be related to the 
intervention. In future, administration of rivastigmine 
via patches, as is common in current clinical practice for 
Parkinson’s disease dementia, might improve tolerability 
because use in Alzheimer’s disease dementia is 
associated with lower rates of nausea and vomiting than 
with oral administration.50 The occurrence of drug side-
eff
 ects or positive outcomes for the actively treated group 
is likely to account for the observations that participants

in this group were more likely to correctly guess their 
allocation than would be expected by chance.
The strengths of this trial include its randomised 
placebo-controlled design, objective outcome measure, 
and high retention rate of participants. Because this was a 
phase 2 study, we choose a surrogate marker of fall risk, 
gait variability, because we were uncertain as to whether 
the trial would be suffi
  ciently powered to detect a diff
 erence 
in fall rate, a more commonly used clinical outcome. 
Despite our double-blind design, there was some evidence 
that participants in the treatment group might have 
guessed allocation group and this might have biased our 
results. Use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for gait and 
balance might not be eff
 ective for all patients with 
Parkinson’s disease. In excluding those who were 
dependent on walking aids, we might have excluded 
people with more marked gait dysfunction who would 
have had potentially greater benefi
 t from the intervention. 
Alternatively, effi
  cacy might be attenuated by the greater 
cholinergic deaff
 erentation present in patients with more 
advanced disease. The single-site nature of the trial might 
also decrease the generalisability of these fi
 ndings. Future 
studies with larger sample sizes will allow analyses to 
identify subgroups of patients that will benefi
 t most from 
rivastigmine.
We believe it is now necessary to undertake a larger 
phase 3 randomised controlled trial with falls as the 
primary outcome and with a cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis 
before we can confi
 dently advise on the routine use of 
rivastigmine in the management of falls in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease.
