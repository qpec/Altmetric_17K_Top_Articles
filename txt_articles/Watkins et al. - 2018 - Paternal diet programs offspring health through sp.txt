The association between poor paternal diet, perturbed embryonic
development, and adult offspring ill health represents a new focus
for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis.
However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains
ill-defined. We have developed a mouse paternal low-protein diet
(LPD) model to determine its impact on semen quality, maternal
uterine physiology, and adult offspring health. We observed that
sperm from LPD-fed male mice displayed global hypomethylation
associated with reduced testicular expression of DNA methylation
and folate-cycle regulators compared with normal protein diet (NPD)
fed males. Furthermore, females mated with LPD males display
blunted preimplantation uterine immunological, cell signaling, and
vascular remodeling responses compared to controls. These data
indicate paternal diet impacts on offspring health through both
sperm genomic (epigenetic) and seminal plasma (maternal uterine
environment) mechanisms. Extending our model, we defined sperm-
and seminal plasma-specific effects on offspring health by combining
artificial insemination with vasectomized male mating of dietary-
manipulated males. All offspring derived from LPD sperm and/or
seminal plasma became heavier with increased adiposity, glucose
intolerance, perturbed hepatic gene expression symptomatic of non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered gut bacterial profiles. These
data provide insight into programming mechanisms linking poor pa-
ternal diet with semen quality and offspring health.

here is growing evidence that paternal diet, physiology, and
environmental factors impact on sperm quality, post-
fertilization development, and adult offspring health (1). Studies
into mechanisms of paternal programming have identified both
direct (sperm quality, epigenetic status, and DNA integrity) and
indirect (seminal plasma composition) pathways linking paternal
fitness with offspring health (2). Elevated body mass index in
men is associated with reduced serum testosterone (3), increased
sperm-DNA fragmentation (4), and poor postfertilization de-
velopment (5). Animal models of paternal high-fat-diet–induced
obesity and diabetes also reveal significant increases in sperm-
DNA fragmentation (6), impaired embryo development (7), and
offspring glucose intolerance and defective insulin secretion (8).
Mirroring the programming effects of paternal high-fat diet,
paternal undernutrition impacts significantly on embryonic me-
tabolism, fetal growth, and adult cardiometabolic health (9–11).
Epigenetic mechanisms are potential mediators linking pa-
ternal environment to sperm quality and adverse offspring de-
velopment. Changes in the patterns of histone variants (12),
DNA methylation (13), and RNA transcripts (14) have been
observed in sperm from infertile men. However, it is still
unknown whether sperm epigenetic changes are a direct cause or
consequence of male infertility. In mice, diets high in fat or low
in folates have detrimental effects on sperm-DNA methylation
and tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) levels impacting on fetal
development and adult offspring glucose tolerance (15, 16). Sepa-
rate from sperm, seminal plasma can influence postfertilization
development through its central role in initiating maternal re-
productive tract immunological responses, essential in the estab-
lishment and maintenance of pregnancy (17, 18). In mice, absence
of seminal plasma at the time of conception retards preimplantation
embryo development, programming hypertension, obesity, and
glucose intolerance in adult offspring (19).
While our understanding of the impact of suboptimal paternal
diet on offspring health is increasing, the mechanisms underlying
these changes remain to be defined fully. To date, studies have
focused on individual sperm-specific epigenetic changes (DNA
methylation, histone modifications, and RNA populations) or
Significance
Parental health and diet at the time of conception determine
the development and life-long disease risk of their offspring.
While the association between poor maternal diet and off-
spring health is well established, the underlying mechanisms
linking paternal diet with offspring health are poorly defined.
Possible programming pathways include changes in testicular
and sperm epigenetic regulation and status, seminal plasma
composition, and maternal reproductive tract responses regu-
lating early embryo development. In this study, we demon-
strate that paternal low-protein diet induces sperm-DNA
hypomethylation in conjunction with blunted female re-
productive tract embryotrophic, immunological, and vascular
remodeling responses. Furthermore, we identify sperm- and
seminal plasma-specific programming effects of paternal diet
with elevated offspring adiposity, metabolic dysfunction, and
altered gut microbiota.

 seminal plasma-mediated programming of offspring health in
isolation. However, the precise and relative sperm- and seminal-
plasma specific contributions to offspring programming in vivo are
unknown. Male mice in this study were fed normal or low-protein
diets as described previously (10, 11). In this model, the low-protein
diet does not affect male reproductive fitness (testis weight, sperm
number, pregnancy rates, or litter size) but programs elevated off-
spring growth and perturbed cardiometabolic health. Here, we re-
port that paternal diet modifies sperm-DNA methylation levels and
cytokine-associated uterine inflammation and vasculogenesis. Fur-
thermore, we characterize sperm- and seminal plasma-mediated
effects of paternal diet on adult offspring growth, adiposity, and
metabolic function, including measures of nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease and gut microbiota population.
Results
Paternal LPD Leads to Sperm Global DNA Hypomethylation. We fed
male mice either a control normal protein diet (NPD 18% ca-
sein) or isocaloric low-protein diet (LPD; 9% casein) for a
minimum of 8 wk (see SI Appendix, Table S1 for composition). In
line with our previous studies (10, 11), LPD had no impact on
male body weight, testis weight, or the total number of mature
epididymal sperm collected (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). However, anal-
ysis of testicular histology revealed increased mean tubule and
seminiferous epithelium area (Fig. 1 A–C; P ≤ 0.0001). Testes from
LPD-fed males displayed reduced expression of the de novo and
regulatory DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3L, re-
spectively (Fig. 1D; P = 0.023 and 0.05, respectively) and altered
folate-cycle enzymes Dhfr (dihydrofolate reductase), Mthfr (meth-
ylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), and Mtr (methionine synthase)
expression (Fig. 1E; P = 0.036, 0.022, and 0.0012, respectively).
Analysis of sperm-DNA methylation status revealed LPD sperm
to be comparatively hypomethylated compared with NPD sperm
(Fig. 1F). We identified 972 hypomethylated loci in LPD sperm but
only 99 hypermethylated loci (Log2 reads per million fold-
change <0 or >1, respectively). (See Dataset S1 file for all dif-
ferentially methylated loci.) LPD differentially methylated loci
were present on all chromosomes (Fig. 1F) and associated within
several different classes of DNA-repetitive elements (Fig. 1G).
Pathway analysis identified calcium-signaling, GnRH-signaling,
and apoptosis pathways to be the most enriched, with 24, 14,
and 7 genes showing differentially methylated loci, respectively
(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1H). Previously, we identified differential tran-
script expression of several calcium-signaling, apoptosis, and
metabolic regulators (Adcy5, Bcl2l1, Plcb, Prkcb, and Fto) in
hearts of offspring derived from LPD-fed males (10). Each gene
displayed differential methylation in LPD sperm (Dataset S1).
However, in stud sperm, Adcy5 and Fto were the only genes with
reduced expression (Fig. 1I; P = 0.05 and 0.043, respectively).
Finally, we observed no impact of paternal LPD on sperm ca-
pacitation (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) or seminal plasma cytokine
levels (SI Appendix, Table S2).
LPD Semen Blunts Maternal Uterine Cytokine and Immunological
Responses. We demonstrated previously that paternal LPD re-
duced expression of multiple AMPK pathway genes in day 3.5
blastocysts (11). To determine if changes in embryonic gene ex-
pression were associated with an altered maternal uterine environ-
ment, we analyzed uterine cytokines at day 3.5 post coitus. Here, we
observed significant reductions in proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines in females mated with LPD-fed males (Fig. 2A). Specif-
ically, we observed reductions in the levels of TNF, IL-1β, CSF3
MIP-1α, and IFN-γ (Fig. 2 B–F; P < 0.05). Expression analysis of
genes involved in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway revealed
reductions in the expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase
(Alox5), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), prosta-
glandin E synthase (Ptges), and thromboxane-A synthase (Tbxas1)
in females mated with LPD males (Fig. 2G; P < 0.05). Further-
more, we observed significant reductions in uterine expression of
CD3 antigen, epsilon polypeptide (Cd3e), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3),
and histocompatibility 2, class II antigen A, beta 1 (H2-Ab1) (Fig.
2H; P < 0.05). Finally, analysis of uterine vascular morphology
at day 3.5 post coitus revealed significant reductions in uterine blood
vessel area and perimeter (Fig. 2 I and J; P < 0.001) in females
mated with LPD-fed males.
Sperm- and Seminal Plasma-Specific Effects on Offspring Health. Our
results indicated paternal diet programs offspring development
through both sperm (direct genomic or epigenetic effects on the
embryo) and seminal plasma (perturbed maternal uterine envi-
ronment) mechanisms. To define the relative sperm and seminal
plasma programming contribution to offspring health, we com-
bined artificial insemination and vasectomized male mating. We
generated four groups of offspring mice termed NN (NPD sperm
and NPD seminal plasma), LL (LPD sperm and LPD seminal
plasma), NL (NPD sperm and LPD seminal plasma), and LN
(LPD sperm and NPD seminal plasma). No significant difference
in maternal gestational weight gain or gestation length, litter size,
or weight at birth were observed between treatment groups (SI
Appendix, Table S3). For all treatment groups, we observed that
approximately one third of inseminated females did not become
pregnant (as defined by sustained weight gain over the first
10 d of gestation). Similarly, only two thirds of pregnant females
went on to deliver live offspring. However, both pregnancy and

 live birth rates were similar for all groups. Postnatally, LL, NL,
and LN males all became significantly heavier then NN offspring
from 5 wk of age and remained heavier for up to 16 wk of age
(Fig. 3A; P < 0.001). Female offspring displayed a growth profile
similar to that of the males, with the LL, NL, and LN offspring
all becoming heavier than the NN females (Fig. 3E; P < 0.05).
Furthermore, LN females displayed a significantly heavier growth
profile than LL females (P = 0.009). Analysis of 15-wk-old offspring
glucose tolerance revealed elevated responses in LL males and fe-
males at 30 min post bolus (P = 0.013 and 0.023, respectively); LL
males, LN males, and LN females at 60 min (P = 0.04, 0.05 and
0.024, respectively); and LN males, NL males, LL females, LN fe-
males, and NL females at 120 min (P = 0.003, 0.004, 0.00, 0.001,
and 0.0032, respectively) compared with NN offspring (Fig. 3 B and
F). Analysis of mean area under the glucose tolerance test curve
revealed increased responses in LL and NL males (P = 0.022 and
0.012, respectively) and females (P = 0.034 and 0.010, respectively)
compared with NN offspring (Fig. 3 C and G). At the time of cull
(16 wk of age), male and female LL offspring displayed increased
gonadal:body weight ratios compared with NN offspring (P = 0.021
and 0.046, respectively; Fig. 3 D and H).
Increased obesity and poor glucose regulation are central
markers for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). As we
observed no impact of offspring sex on any of the NAFLD pa-
rameters measured, data for male and female offspring within
each treatment group were combined. Liver Acetyl-CoA and
serum IL-6 showed no difference between treatment groups (Fig.
4 A and B). However, NL and LN offspring displayed a reduced
level of serum TNF compared with NN offspring (P = 0.011 and
0.002, respectively; Fig. 4C). NL and LN offspring also displayed
increased hepatic expression of the central NAFLD-regulating
genes adiponectin 1 receptor (Adipor1; P = 0.019 and 0.033,
respectively), AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (Akt2; P = 0.001
and >0.001, respectively), protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha
1 catalytic subunit (Prkaa1; P = 0.002 and >0.001, respectively),
sirtuin 3 (Sirt3; P > 0.001 for both), and sterol regulatory element
binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1; P = 0.001 and 0.002, re-
spectively) (Fig. 4 D–H) compared with NN offspring. Further-
more, NL and LN offspring displayed reduced expression of the
cellular tumor antigen p53 (Trp53; Fig. 4I; P = 0.002 and 0.032,
respectively) compared with NN offspring. Interestingly, there
were no significant differences between the LL and NN offspring
for any of the genes studied.
Finally, using universal primers, we observed no significant
difference in mean total bacterial content between treatment
groups or sexes (Fig. 5 A–C). However, analysis of individual
bacterial genus revealed LL males to have a higher Enterococcus
profile compared with NN and NL males (P = 0.049 and 0.024,
respectively; Fig. 5B). We also observed that LL offspring displayed
higher levels of Lactobacillus compared with LN offspring (Fig. 5A;
P = 0.043). Analysis of fecal Streptococcus levels revealed NN and
LN males to have significantly higher profiles compared with LL
and NL males (Fig. 5B). Finally, LL offspring displayed a signifi-
cantly reduced profile of fecal Biffidobacterium compared with NL
and LN offspring (Fig. 5A; P = 0.041 and 0.024, respectively). No
difference in fecal Enterobacter or Bacteroides was observed between
groups. As only six specific bacterial groups within the total pop-
ulation were analyzed within the current study, further sequencing
of the bacterial 16s ribosomal region would be required to de-
termine fully how paternal diet affects offspring gut microbiota.
Discussion
While the association between poor paternal diet and offspring
metabolic dysfunction is now established, the underlying mech-
anisms remain poorly defined. We now show that feeding male

 mice an LPD results in perturbed testicular epigenetic status and
globally hypomethylated sperm. Furthermore, in females mated with
LPD males, we observe blunted uterine immunological signaling re-
sponses and vascular remodeling. Using artificial insemination with
vasectomized male mating we show that offspring growth, metabo-
lism, adiposity, and gut bacteria are programmed by paternal diet in a
sperm- or seminal plasma-specific manner. Significantly, all offspring
derived from either LPD sperm and/or seminal plasma developed
phenotypic characteristics of metabolic dysfunction. These results
provide insights into links between poor paternal diet at the time of
conception and the programming of metabolic health in his offspring.
Diets high in fat and/or protein (28% protein) have been
shown to impair testicular steroidogenesis, increasing rates of
apoptosis and sperm-DNA damage in rodents (20, 21). In re-
sponse to LPD, we observed increased mean testicular seminif-
erous tubule and epithelium area. However, the mechanisms
underlying these changes in tubule morphology remain unknown
at present. We also observed paternal LPD perturbed testicular
expression of the folate-cycle enzymes Dhfr, Mthfr, and Mtr and
of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3L. In rodents,
maternal LPD has been associated with elevated plasma homo-
cysteine levels, modifying s-adenosylmethionine levels for epi-
genetic regulation of gene expression (22, 23). Male Mthfr
knockout mice display altered testicular histology, loss of germ
cell number, and reduced sperm-DNA methylation profiles (15,
24), while pharmacological reduction in cellular Dnmt1/3L levels
impact negatively on spermatogenesis and sperm-DNA methyl-
ation levels (25, 26). Therefore, disruption of the testicular folate
cycle in LPD males may impact the provision of methyl donors
for the establishment of appropriate epigenetic marks within the
developing sperm, although this remains to be confirmed.
To determine the impact of paternal LPD on sperm epigenetic
status, we performed global analysis of sperm-DNA methylation.
We observed that sperm from LPD-fed males displayed global
hypomethylation aligned within gene body locations. However,
minimal changes in DNA methylation at promoter regions or
CpG islands were detected. Similar minimal impacts on pro-
moter DNA methylation (as determined by MeDIP-Seq) have
been observed in sperm from mice fed LPD (9). However, gene
body methylation status was not reported. In sperm, DNA
methylation at non–CpG-dense gene–body regions has been
reported and correlates positively with gene expression (27). It is
believed to regulate gene transcription from alternative in-
tragenic promoters (28). Therefore, further studies are required
to elucidate fully the impact of paternal diet on additional sperm
epigenetic modifications including histone modifications (29)
and RNAs (15) in addition to DNA methylation.
Previously, we have shown offspring of LPD males display
cardiovascular dysfunction associated with reduced cardiac ex-
pression of calcium-signaling (Adcy5, Plcb, and Prkcb), fat mass-
and obesity-associated (Fto), and antiapoptotic (Bcl2l1) genes
(10). As Adcy5, Bcl2l1, Plcb, and Fto displayed differential
methylation in LPD sperm, we assessed their expression at the
transcript level. While Adcy5 and Fto expression were reduced in
LPD sperm, no difference in Bcl2l1, Plcb, or Prkcb was observed.
These observations indicate a nondirect association between
DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms in sperm
(9). Future studies will define further the associations between
paternal diet, testicular function, and sperm epigenetic status.
We also observed that paternal LPD suppressed normal ma-
ternal uterine inflammatory responses. Following mating, de-
position of seminal plasma within the female reproductive tract
initiates secretion of embryotrophic and immune-modulatory
cytokines as well as initiating regulatory T cell expansion and
leukocyte infiltration (30). Disruption to the balance of oviductal
and uterine-signaling molecules during preimplantation devel-
opment has been linked to perturbed embryonic and offspring
development (19). We observed reduced uterine TNF, IL-1β,
IFN-γ, MIP-1α, and CSF3 levels following mating with LPD
males. IL-1β has been linked to embryo development with levels
correlated to blastocyst cell number in humans (31). Uterine
MIP-1α and CSF3 regulate paternal antigen-presenting cells,
which are essential for uterine immune response suppression
ahead of blastocyst implantation (32), while uterine natural killer
cell-derived IFN-γ and TNF regulate the remodeling of the
uterine vasculature. We also observed significantly decreased
uterine expression of Alox5, Ptgs2, Ptges, Tbxas1 genes in females
mated with LPD males. ALOX5 regulates the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines including TNF (33) and IL-1β (34),
while Ptges is involved in the maternal recognition of pregnancy
(30). These observations may be explained by blunted uterine
inflammatory and regulatory T cell (Tregs) mediated responses

 post mating. Our observation of significantly reduced uterine
expression of Cd3e, Foxp3, and H2-Ab1 supports this interpretation.
H2-Ab1 is involved in the presentation of paternal antigens by
dendritic cells to T cells via the T cell receptor (TCR). Signaling via
Cd3e, a component of the TCR, results in the activation of Treg
cells and the induction of Foxp3 gene transcription (35). However,
further studies are needed to characterize uterine Foxp3+ Treg cell
populations.
Our data reveal the impact of paternal diet on both sperm
epigenetic status and the preimplantation uterine environment.
As both mechanisms have the potential to program post-
fertilization development and offspring health, we define their
respective impacts on adult offspring well-being. We combined
artificial insemination with vasectomized male mating to gener-
ate four groups of offspring (NN, LL, NL, LN; where the first
and second letters denote the diet of the sperm and seminal
plasma, respectively). All offspring generated using LPD sperm
and/or seminal plasma displayed characteristics associated with
metabolic syndrome including elevated adiposity, glucose in-
tolerance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered gut bac-
terial profiles. We observed that the greatest impacts on
offspring phenotype occurred when the dietary origin of the
sperm and seminal plasma are mismatched (NL and LN groups).
This was most evident in our analysis of offspring nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is the most common form
of chronic liver disease in Western societies and is characterized
typically by increased levels of inflammatory markers, hepatic
lipids, metabolites, and apoptosis (36). We observed no impact
of paternal diet on hepatic acetyl-CoA or serum IL-6 levels,
while levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF were reduced
in NL and LN offspring. Studies have shown that obese pre-
pubescent children display lower levels of serum TNF than
nonobese children (37). These studies suggest that in younger
individuals the relationship between obesity and inflammatory
status may be different to that in adults. As our offspring were
only 16 wk of age, they may only be at an early stage of NAFLD
before the chronic elevation of proinflammatory markers. Fur-
thermore, we observed significantly increased expression of
Adipor1, Akt2, Prkaa1, Sirt3, and Srebf1 in NL and LN offspring,
while Tp53 was decreased. Such patterns have been linked with
obesity (38), increased hepatic fatty acid synthesis (39), and in-
creased lipid deposition (40).
There is increasing interest in the interaction between lifestyle,
gut microbiota, and liver function (41). Our initial analysis of
offspring gut bacterial profiles revealed significant changes in the
levels of Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Biffido-
bacterium between groups. Collectively and individually, these
bacteria are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty
acids, and bile acids (42). Probiotic treatment of obese children
with Lactobacillus and Biffidobacterium has been shown to re-
duce the severity of NAFLD (43). It is interesting to speculate if
the changes in offspring gut microbiota were established in early
neonatal life or occurred in response to their perturbed meta-
bolic status. Recent studies have established seminal plasma
possess its own microbiota, which can be modified by paternal
high-fat diet (44). Whether the seminal microbiota can influence
the maternal reproductive tract microbiota and so alter offspring
gut microbiota at birth remains to be established. However, this
identifies another mechanism by which paternal diet could in-
fluence the health and metabolism of offspring.
In contrast to our previous study (10), we observed no effect of
paternal LPD on weight at birth, but we did observe a significant
effect on postnatal growth affecting both male and female off-
spring. One key difference between the current study and our
previous studies is the use of superovulation and artificial in-
semination. Ovarian hyperstimulation can impact negatively on
embryo quality, endometrial receptivity, and perinatal outcomes
(45, 46), masking or exaggerating offspring phenotypic effects in
a sex-specific manner separate to other programming mechanisms,
for example, paternal diet (10) and absence of seminal plasma
(19). In the current study we are not able to define the potential
impact of the superovulation and/or artificial insemination tech-
niques used on offspring health. However, as all treatment groups
were generated using the same manipulation techniques, we be-
lieve that differences in postnatal phenotype between treatment
groups can be attributed to the dietary status of the male from
which the sperm and/or seminal plasma originated.
Our study provides insights into the mechanism linking pa-
ternal nutrition to the early origins of offspring health. Separate
studies have shown that offspring metabolic health can be im-
paired either via sperm-specific programming of the preimplantation
embryo (15, 47) or seminal plasma-specific modifications to the
uterine environment (19). Our study suggests that a mismatch in the
origin of the sperm and seminal plasma between dietary treatments
has a greater impact on offspring metabolic health than when both
semen components originate from the same suboptimal dietary
treatment group. We hypothesize that when both sperm and seminal
plasma originate from the same dietary background, the seminal
plasma-primed uterine environment is appropriate for the sperm-
programmed preimplantation embryo, impacting minimally on off-
spring health. When the seminal plasma-mediated programming of
the embryo and uterus is mismatched, adaptive changes initiated
within the embryo/fetus elevate metabolic disease risk in adult life (1).
However, further studies are needed to determine precisely how mis-
matched sperm and seminal plasma affect offspring metabolic health.
We believe our study has relevance for both human- and large
animal-assisted reproduction where embryos are routinely gen-
erated and develop in a seminal plasma-free environment and
where embryos are transferred to a nonseminal plasma-primed
uterus. This is an important context for this phase of our work. It
will, therefore, be of interest to determine in humans and large
animals the extent to which a mismatch between the pro-
gramming of the embryo and the optimal priming of the uterus
direct the development and well-being of offspring.
Materials and Methods
Animal Treatments. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the UK
Home Office Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and local ethics com-
mittees. Virgin 8-wk-old males, both intact (n = 32 in total) and vasectomized
(n = 16 in total), and 5- to 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice (Harlan Ltd) were
maintained either at the University of Nottingham’s Bio Support Unit or at
Aston University’s biomedical research facility. Males were allocated either
control normal protein diet (NPD; 18% casein) or isocaloric low-protein diet
(LPD; 9% casein) for a minimum of 8 wk as described previously (10, 11) and
detailed in SI Appendix, Table S1.
Stud Sperm MBD2-Seq Analysis. Methylated DNA from NPD and LPD male
epididymal sperm was isolated ahead of library preparation, sequencing, and
bioinformatics analysis detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Uterine and Seminal Plasma Cytokine Array. Virgin 7- to 9-wk-old C57BL/6
females were caged overnight with NPD or LPD studs. At day 3.5 post coitus,
whole uteri were homogenized for the analysis of cytokine levels using a Bio-Plex
Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-plex immunoassay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and analyzed as
detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods. Using the same
Bio-Plex assay, we also analyzed stud male seminal plasma cytokine levels as
detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Paternal and Maternal Tissue Histology. Day 3.5 post coitus uteri from females
mated with NPD- or LPD-fed males and whole NPD- and LPD-fed male testes
were processed into paraffin wax and sectioned and analyzed as detailed in SI
Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Stud Sperm CapacitationAssay. Motile epididymal spermwereisolated fromNPD and
LPD males for analysis of capacitation by chlortetracycline (CTC) staining and cho-
lesterol efflux as detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.

 Offspring Generation. Female C57BL/6 mice were superovulated and artifi-
cially inseminated using sperm from NPD- or LPD-fed males as detailed in SI
Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods. Following artificial in-
semination, females were housed overnight with an NPD- or LPD-fed va-
sectomized male. Four groups of offspring were generated, termed NN (NPD
sperm and NPD seminal plasma), LL (LPD sperm and LPD seminal plasma), NL
(NPD sperm and LPD seminal plasma), and LN (LPD sperm and NPD seminal
plasma). A minimum of eight litters per treatment group were generated.
Offspring Glucose Tolerance Test. Offspring glucose tolerance at 15 wk of age
was determined as described previously (10). Offspring were fasted over-
night before an i.p. glucose bolus (2 g/kg body weight in PBS) as detailed in
SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Offspring Tissue Sampling. Offspring were culled at 16 wk of age for the
collection and analysis of tissues as detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
RNA and DNA Extraction for Gene Expression and Bacterial Profile Analysis.
RNA was extracted from stud sperm, day 3.5 post coitus maternal uterine
tissue, and offspring kidney tissues, and DNA was extracted from offspring
fecal samples as detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and
Methods. RT-qPCR was performed using primer sequences provided in SI
Appendix, Table S5 and as detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Statistical Analyses. Stud male (excluding MBD-Seq data) and maternal data
were analyzed using independent samples or repeated measures t tests,
where appropriate (SPSS version 23). For each litter, only one sperm donor
male and one vasectomized male were used, and no male was used more
than once. All offspring data were analyzed using a multilevel random ef-
fects regression model (SPSS version 23) (10) with paternal origin of litter
incorporated as a random effect in addition to litter size and body weight as
detailed in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.
