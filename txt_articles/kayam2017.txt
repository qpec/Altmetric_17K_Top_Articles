The Readability and Simplicity 
of Donald Trump’s Language
Orly Kayam
Abstract
The purpose of this study is to identify the readability and simplicity of Donald J. Trump’s speech 
in his media interviews and debates during the 2016 US presidential primary campaign. A total of 
10 interviews and debates broadcast on different television networks were analyzed using three of 
the most commonly used readability formulas: Flesch–Kincaid, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook 
(SMOG), and Gunning-Fog. The analysis revealed that a fourth- to fifth-grade level of education 
(9- to 11-year-olds) is required to understand Trump’s language. In total, 10 additional interviews 
and debates of other candidates in the presidential election of 2016, from both the Republican 
and the Democratic parties, were analyzed, using the same readability formulas, in order to shed 
additional light on Trump’s results. This analysis showed that the average score of all the other 
candidates was at a ninth-grade level (14- to 15-year-olds). Furthermore, the study reveals that 
Trump’s sentences and words were significantly shorter and less complex than those of any other 
candidate. This study suggests that Trump uses low readability and simplicity of language as a 
rhetorical strategy to gain popularity, in accordance with the trend of anti-intellectualism.

On 16 June 2015, Donald J. Trump, who until then was “only” a successful businessman 
and television celebrity, announced his candidacy for president of the United States. Less 
than a month later and despite the lack of support of many key Republicans (Gibbons-
Neff, 2016), including former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain 
(Burns and Barbaro, 2016), and alongside countless articles and unfavorable coverage in 
the press and media (e.g. Abramson, 2016; Feldenkirchen et al., 2016; Kristof, 2016), 
Trump had managed to trounce his fellow candidates, and after they dropped out of the 
primaries he remained the only presidential candidate of the Republican Party.

Political Studies Review 
In November 2016, against the polls, projections and estimations, Trump was elected 
President of the United States. In less than a year and a half and with no previous political 
experience, he did what many considered “the impossible”—he turned from an amusing 
anecdote and the most discussed and controversial phenomenon in modern politics into 
the leader of the most powerful country in the world.
In many ways, Trump represents an exceptional pattern that differentiates him from the 
typical American politician. According to Street (2004), the rise of the celebrity politician has 
seen the displacement of traditional political skills (e.g. bargaining, compromise) and their 
replacement by those of media management and fundraising. “Politicians become stars, poli-
tics becomes a series of spectacles, and the citizens become spectators” (Street, 2004: 441).
While the media has frequently covered Trump’s language and style (e.g. Denby, 
2015; Ross, 2015), there has not been sufficient academic research analyzing Trump’s 
rhetoric (see, however, Jones, 2016). Research on the language and rhetoric of present 
and former US presidents has been conducted, for example, by Degani (2015) and Kayam 
(2013) on President Barack Obama, and in Lim’s (2008) book The Anti-Intellectual 
Presidency: The Decline of Presidential Rhetoric from George Washington to George W. 
Bush. Lim’s corpus includes an analysis of the reading ease of all the American presidents 
from George Washington to George W. Bush and shows a trend toward language simplic-
ity and anti-intellectualism since 1789. According to Lim (2008), while most eighteenth- 
and nineteenth-century presidents spoke at a university/college graduate level, throughout 
the twentieth century the average readability level of presidential speech declined to an 
eighth-grade level (13- to 14-year-olds), and the average sentence length dropped from an 
average of 50 words per sentence in the 1780s to less than 20 in the 1980s.
In October 2015, the Boston Globe analyzed the candidacy announcement speeches of 
candidates from both the Republican and Democratic parties using the Flesch–Kincaid 
formula and concluded that Trump’s speech scored the lowest grade level among all the 
other candidates (4.1 grade level; 9- to 10-year-olds), while candidates Ted Cruz and 
Bernie Sanders scored significantly higher (8.9 and 10.1, respectively; 14- to 15- and 15- 
to 16-year-olds). According to DuBay (2004), the National Adult Literacy Study (Doak 
et al., 1996; Weiss and Coyne, 1997) stated that the average adult in the US reads at the 
seventh-grade level (12- to 13-year-olds). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that using 
language that is understood at lower grade levels will appeal to wider audiences. Eric 
Ostermeier, who has tested various candidates since 2009, comments regarding Trump “I 
haven’t seen a fourth-grade one before” and adds “but if he was speaking more like politi-
cians, would he be doing as well in the polls? I don’t think so” (in Viser, 2015: para. 23).
The fact that Trump speaks at a readability level that is lower than the level of the aver-
age adult in the US means that he is understood by almost every American voter. In this 
way, Trump appeals to wider audiences. However, the fact that he speaks in simple col-
loquial language does not mean that this is what necessarily brought Trump more sup-
porters.1 In other words, I do not argue that people with low readability levels are more 
likely to support a candidate who speaks at a similar level, or that people with high read-
ability levels are likely to reject candidates with lower readability levels. This may reveal 
a certain tendency, but it needs to be explored by systematic research. Exit polls that were 
released after the 2016 US elections clearly show this tendency. In fact, one of the widest 
gaps in the 2016 elections emerged between voters with and without a college degree. 
According to the exit poll conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool 
and reported on CNN on election day, 9 November 2016,2 college graduates supported 
Clinton by a nine-point margin (52%–43%), while those without a college degree backed 
 Kayam

Trump 52%–44%. As to White voters without a college degree, 67% supported Trump, 
while only 28% backed Clinton. Even among women, 62% of White non-college edu-
cated supported Trump, while only 34% supported Hillary. As Cody Cain wrote in Salon.
com just a week before the election, “Trump ‘dumbs down’ his messages in order to 
appeal to low-information voters, or, as Trump calls them, the ‘poorly educated’” (para. 
3). Cain (2016) describes Trump’s statements as “shockingly simplistic” (para. 9) that 
“sound wonderful to a fourth-grader.”
In other words, it is possible that voters with low readability levels support Trump 
because he speaks at their level, but it is not necessarily so. However, what is relevant to 
the current research is that Trump’s low readability level and his use of simple language 
are in accordance with the trend of anti-intellectualism. People may support this trend 
regardless of their readability levels or years of education. Not only is it a rejection of 
intellect and those who are supposed to represent and possess knowledge, but more spe-
cifically in politics, it is a rejection of the conventional politician and the search for some-
thing different—a politician who says what he or she really thinks, without conforming to 
the rules of political correctness.
According to Colvin (2016: para. 2), “Trump is completely unlike all other candidates, 
as he is far more relevant because he’s real—he talks naturally, not like a politician, and 
he says out loud what a segment of voters is thinking.” Swaim (2015: para. 5) adds:
to get at what makes Trump’s language different, take a look at the shape of his sentences. They 
don’t work the way modern political rhetoric does - they work the way punchlines work: short 
(sometimes very short) with the most important words at the end (Swaim, 2015: para. 5).
Furthermore, Swaim (2015: para. 13) claims that “for people who’ve grown weary of poli-
ticians using vague and convoluted language to lull or impress their listeners, to preserve 
their options and to avoid criticism, Trump sounds refreshingly clear and forthright.”
Simplicity and brevity are the first two rules of Frank Luntz’s “Ten Rules of Effective 
Language”: use small words and use short sentences (Luntz, 2007). According to Luntz, 
who worked for New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani from 1993 through 2001 and wit-
nessed the collapse of his 2008 presidential campaign, a candidate should avoid words 
that might force someone to reach for the dictionary. Luntz (2007: 7) suggests that “the 
most memorable political language is rarely longer than a sentence.”
The simplicity and readability of Trump’s language will be the focus of this study, which 
is the first of two complementary studies (the second article addresses Trump’s anti-political 
rhetoric). The purpose of this study is to analyze, from a linguistic perspective, Trump’s phe-
nomenal success in becoming the nominee of the Republican Party and the President-elect in 
less than a year and a half. The study focuses on Trump’s language readability and other 
aspects of linguistic simplicity, such as the use of complex (polysyllabic) words and sentence 
length, and compares these findings with those of other candidates from both parties.
Although the study does not take the political context into account, its findings and 
consequences can make a significant contribution to the analysis of the rhetoric of presi-
dential campaigns and the research of political anti-intellectualism. As I will show, Trump’s 
rhetorical strategy of using simple language with a low readability level helped pave the 
way to his becoming the Republican Party nominee for President in the 2016 election, by 
appealing to larger audiences and conforming to the trend of anti-intellectualism. In other 
words, this study seeks to explore the rhetorical grounds that helped Trump market himself 
and address a wider American audience.

Political Studies Review 
In the following two sections, I will elaborate on the trend of anti-intellectualism and 
the history of readability test formulas.
Anti-Intellectualism
In its political sense, anti-intellectualism is an approach that minimizes the value of 
knowledge, intelligence, science, academia and intellectuals. In 1980, Isaac Asimov 
wrote in his essay “A Cult of Ignorance,” published in Newsweek, that “anti-intellectual-
ism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, 
nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is just as good as 
your knowledge’” (Asimov, 1980: 19).
Hofstadter (1963: 19) defines anti-intellectualism as a “resentment and suspicion of 
the life of the mind and of those who are considered to represent it; and a disposition 
constantly to minimize the value of that life.” Lim (2008: 20) adds that anti-intellectual-
ism consists of “disapprobation attitudes toward elitism, sophistry, effeminacy, and arti-
fice and approbative attitudes toward sincerity, modesty, accessibility, and democracy, 
making it a potent political stance and weapon.”
Regarding anti-intellectualism in the US, journalist Charles Pierce (2010) writes in his 
book Idiot America that the rise of this trend
represents—for profit mainly, but also and more cynically, for political advantage in the pursuit 
of power—the breakdown of a consensus that the pursuit of knowledge is a good. It also 
represents the ascendancy of the notion that the people whom we should trust the least are the 
people who best know what they are talking about. In the new media age, everybody is an expert 
(Pierce, 2010: 8).
From a rhetorical perspective, Lim (2008: 22) argues that political anti-intellectualism 
leads to “the rejection of rhetorical or linguistic complexity and in its valorization, in 
practice and by example, of linguistic simplicity.” Therefore, as he shows in his seminal 
research, it is measurable by readability tests that detect linguistic simplicity.
Nevertheless, Lim (2008) stresses that the trend of anti-intellectualism does not imply 
that citizens are turning “dumber”:
When presidents lie to us or mislead us, when they pander to us or seduce us with their words, 
when they equivocate and try to be all things to all people, or when they divide us with wedge 
issues, they do so with an arsenal of anti-intellectual tricks, with rhetoric that is linguistically 
simplistic, reliant on platitudes or partisan slogans, short on argument, and long on emotive and 
human-interest appeals (Lim, 2008: 6).
Under the growing trend of anti-intellectualism, it is not surprising that Trump managed 
to gain such massive support in a relatively short period of time. His rhetorical style, his 
use of simple language, his straightforwardness and simple messages match this trend and 
basically give the public what they are looking for—a new politician who renounces the 
traditional rules of politics and says what he really means.
Readability and Grade Level
In order to analyze the level of education required to comprehend a text, educators in the 
1920s developed several formulas that predict the difficulty level (or reading ease) of a 
 Kayam 
5
text. By the 1980s, there were 200 formulas, and over a thousand studies had been pub-
lished on the readability formulas. Most of the studies attested to their strong theoretical 
and statistical validity.
George Klare (1963) defines readability as “the ease of understanding or comprehen-
sion due to the style of writing” (DuBay, 2004: 3). In 1976, a study commissioned by the 
US Navy and carried out by Rudolf Flesch and J. Peter Kincaid modified the reading ease 
formula to produce a grade-level score. This popular formula is known as the Flesch–
Kincaid formula, the Flesch Grade-Scale formula, or the Kincaid formula (DuBay, 2004).
The Flesch–Kincaid Formulas
The Flesch–Kincaid formulas (Figures S5 and S6 in the Online Appendix) were origi-
nally designed to indicate difficulties in understanding and comprehension of contempo-
rary and academic English. Although the Flesch reading ease and the Flesch–Kincaid 
grade level formulas use the same core measures (word length and sentence length), they 
have different weighting factors. Therefore, scores in these formulas show results 
inversely: a text with a comparatively high score on the reading ease test should have a 
lower score on the grade-level test. In 1978, the US Department of Defense authorized 
this formula in new procedures for validating the readability of technical manuals for the 
Armed Services (DuBay, 2004).
In order to determine the reading ease of texts by the Flesch–Kincaid formula, the 
number of words in the text is divided by the number of sentences. The result, which is 
the average sentence length of the text, is multiplied by 1.015, then subtracted from 
206.835 (Figure S5 in the Online Appendix). Then, 84.6 multiplied by the number of 
average syllables in the text is subtracted from the result. The given result is the text’s 
readability score, ranging from 0 to 100. This number can predict the estimated level of 
education required to understand the text.
Flesch’s index (Table S1 in the Online Appendix) shows that only 4.5% of American 
adults are capable of understanding texts that have readability scores of 0–30, which is 
described as a scientific college/university graduate level, while 93% of American 
adults are able to understand texts that scored 90–100, or fifth-grade level (10- to 
11-year-olds).
In 1949, Flesch also suggested a table that classifies types of magazines according to 
reading ease scores and grade levels (DuBay, 2004; Table S2 in the Online Appendix). 
Flesch based this table according to the average readability scores of popular magazines 
in several fields. The table suggests that readability scores of 90–100, which are suitable 
for fourth graders, are parallel to comic books/magazines and are understood by 93% of 
American adults. Readability scores of 0–30, which are suitable for college graduates, 
are parallel to scientific magazines and are understood by only 4.5% of the population 
(DuBay, 2004).
The Flesch–Kincaid grade level formula (Figure S6 in the Online Appendix) is used in 
order to arrive at the estimated American education system grade level required to under-
stand a text; this formula uses the average sentence length and the average number of 
syllables of the text and the given result is the estimated grade level.
A more recent comparison, which includes modern means of communications such as 
email and television shows, is suggested by Lim (2008) (Figure S9 in the Online 
Appendix). In his research, Lim (2008) used the Flesch reading ease formula to analyze 
the Annual Message (the “State of the Union Address”) of all American presidents from 
 6 
Political Studies Review 
1790 to 2006 (Figure S10 in the Online Appendix). The results indicate that most of the 
Annual Messages in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were below the readability 
score of 40 (college graduate level), but in the twentieth century the average readability 
rose to 50–60 (eighth-grade level). A comparison of the Inaugural Address speeches of all 
presidents (Lim, 2008) (Figure S11 in the Online Appendix) resulted in even more signifi-
cant differences: from an average readability score of 20 (college graduate) in 1789 to an 
average that is higher than 60 (seventh grade).
Another interesting diagram shows Lim’s average sentence length of the Annual Message 
(Figure S12 in the Online Appendix) and indicates a clear trend of shorter sentences during 
the 200 years of the American presidency, from 40–50 words per sentence in George 
Washington’s era to less than 20 nowadays. The diagram shows that this trend increased 
in the twentieth century, specifically after 1913 when the average sentence length dropped 
from 35.2 words per sentence to only 22. Lim (2008) also indicates that the average sen-
tence time in 1968 was 42 seconds, in comparison with only 7 seconds in 2000. The aver-
age sentence length of the Inaugural Address (Figure S13 in the Online Appendix) also 
suggests unambiguous results, showing that sentence length dropped sharply from 60 
words per sentence in 1790 to less than 20 words in 2006 (Lim, 2008).
Further evidence for the increase in language simplicity, but in a shorter period of time, 
can be found in Drutman and Drinkard’s (2012) analysis (Figure S14 in the Online 
Appendix), which shows a decline in the average grade level of Congress members’ 
speeches—from 11.4 in 1996 to 10.6 in 2012. According to Jeff Shesol, a historian and 
former speechwriter for Bill Clinton:
It’s tempting to read this as a dumbing down of the bully pulpit, but it’s actually a sign of 
democratization. In the early republic, presidents could assume that they were speaking to 
audiences made up mostly of men like themselves: educated, civic-minded landowners. These, 
of course, were the only Americans with the right to vote. But over time, the franchise expanded 
and presidential appeals had to reach a broader audience (in Thompson, 2014: para. 8).
Lim (2008) offers a similar observation. He states that “a stronger justification of anti-
intellectualism posits that speaking the language of the people increases democratic par-
ticipation” and “distills the complexity of government into a form that is digestible to the 
mass citizenry” (Lim, 2008: 102).
Although Flesch–Kincaid is the most commonly used formula, there are dozens of 
other readability and reading ease formulas; some of them are popular in other fields such 
as computing or medicine. Although this study focuses on the Flesch–Kincaid grade level 
formula, I will relate to two other commonly used formulas for grade-level prediction: 
Gunning-Fog and SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook).
The Gunning-Fog Index
Like the Flesch–Kincaid grade level, the Gunning-Fog index predicts the formal US 
grade level that is required to understand a text in a first reading. Developed by 
Robert Gunning (1968), the formula (Figure S7 in the Online Appendix) uses the 
percentage of complex words (polysyllables, not including inflectional suffixes like 
ing, ed, or es) alongside the average sentence length of the text. The result of the 
Gunning-Fog index is a numeric value by which the reading grade level is estimated 
(Table S3 in the Online Appendix).

SMOG
During the 1960s, researchers kept improving the existing readability formulas, as a 
result of public attention and consumer demand for simple language documentation 
(DuBay, 2004). In 1969, G. Harry McLaughlin developed the SMOG. McLaughlin, who 
defines readability as “the degree to which a given class of people find certain reading 
matter compelling and comprehensive” (Zamanian and Heydari, 2012: 43), wanted to 
estimate the required grade level more accurately than that achieved by the Gunning-Fog 
index (Figure S8 in the Online Appendix). The SMOG formula is widely used in the field 
of medicine (Hedman, 2008; Ley and Florio, 1996).
Method
In order to analyze Trump’s readability and language simplicity, and to compare them 
with other presidential candidates, 20 transcripts of different television networks 
were chosen: 10 interviews/debates of Trump and a total of 10 interviews/debates of 
five other candidates. After analyzing several transcripts for each candidate, and see-
ing that the results of readability level and language complexity were similar, a sam-
ple of two transcripts were chosen for each candidate, resulting in a total of 10 
transcripts, equaling Trump’s 10 transcripts. Each chosen transcript was over 1000 
words and was taken only from the official website of the network on which it was 
broadcast. Furthermore, the two transcripts of each candidate were chosen from two 
different networks.
The analysis focuses on spontaneous language rather than written speech; therefore, 
the transcripts that were analyzed are of various interviews and debates where the candi-
dates responded extemporaneously. For this purpose, 20 transcripts were analyzed via 
Flesch–Kincaid, SMOG, and Gunning-Fog readability formulas. A total of 10 transcripts 
were taken from different interviews and debates of Donald Trump from different TV 
networks and 10 transcripts of another five candidates (two transcripts for each): Jeb 
Bush, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Bernie Sanders. The research relates 
to the period prior to the Republican National Convention in July 2016, when many still 
thought it inconceivable that Trump, a man who had never held elected office, would 
actually receive the nomination.
The transcripts were retrieved from the official internet website of each network, 
and were verified with the video itself, to assure compatibility. To make sure that the 
corpus was as varied as possible, Trump’s chosen interviews and debates were taken 
from different networks and over a 9-month time span, starting from 8 July 2015 to 3 
March 2016. The reason for choosing transcripts from different time periods during 
the primaries was to ensure that the results would reflect Trump’s rhetoric over the 
entire 9-month period.
Readability Measurement
Each transcript was cleaned manually of any text that was not the candidate’s own, such 
as the interviewer’s questions, audience comments, and notes like LAUGHTER or 
APPLAUSE. After the cleaning process, each transcript was analyzed by three different 
Flesch–Kincaid formula calculation engines:

Biagini (2007).
2. 
The Readability Test Tool—by David Simpson (2009).
3. 
Readability-Score.com by Added Bytes (Child, 2004).
The results of each engine were recorded, and then an average grade level of the three 
engines was recorded for each transcript, to provide an as accurate as possible Flesch–
Kincaid grade level. In addition, the average grade level of all Trump’s transcripts was 
calculated, as well as for each of the other candidate’s average separately.
After recording and calculating all the Flesch–Kincaid results, each transcript was 
analyzed in a similar method in three different SMOG engines: read-able.com, readabil-
ity-score.com, and readabilityformulas.com. After recording and calculating the results in 
the same method as the Flesch–Kincaid results, the transcripts were analyzed in the same 
three websites, which provided Gunning-Fog indexes as well. After recording and calcu-
lating, the average scores of all three grade-level formulas were calculated and recorded.
Simplicity
In addition to the readability and grade level analysis, four other aspects of language 
simplicity were examined in each of the 20 transcripts:
1. 
The percentage of complex words (polysyllables—words which consist of more 
than three syllables).
2. 
The average number of words per sentence (sentence length).
3. 
The average number of syllables per word.
4. 
The average number of characters per word (word length).
Data were collected using the two following engines: Readability-Score.com and the 
Readability Test Tool. Similar to the grade-level analysis, the average of each result for 
each candidate was calculated as well.

Results
In the first stage of the research, 20 transcripts were analyzed by three Flesch–Kincaid 
grade level formula calculation engines—10 transcripts of Donald Trump (total of 31,459 
words) and 10 of five other candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco 
Rubio, and Jeb Bush (total of 38,200 words). The results (Table S4 in the Online Appendix) 
show that the average grade level of all Donald Trump’s analyzed transcripts is 3.96—a 
readability level of a fourth grader (9- to 10-year-olds). The highest grade-level score 
Trump reached is 4.73 (almost fifth grade, 10- to 11-year-olds), in his ABC News inter-
view on 22 November 2015. Trump’s lowest grade level, 3.66, can be found in three 
interviews. Table S4 in the Online Appendix also shows that Trump’s grade level remained 
the lowest among all candidates throughout the time period of the research.
In comparison, the average Flesch–Kincaid grade-level score of all the other candi-
dates combined (Table S5 in the Online Appendix) is 8.03—a readability level of eighth 
grade (13- to 14-year-olds). The transcript that resulted in the highest grade-level score 
was Hillary Clinton’s interview on NPR (20 January 2016), which scored a grade level of 
9.24 (15- to 16-year-olds). Clinton’s other transcript, from the PBS Democratic Debate on 
11 February 2016, received 9.12, meaning that Clinton’s average grade level was 9.18, 
more than half a grade above Bernie Sanders, who scored an average grade level of 8.57, 
still more than four grades above Trump. The results also indicate that the Republican 
candidates tend to score lower grade-level scores (see Figure 1 and Table S6 in the Online 
Appendix). The average Flesch–Kincaid grade level of the two Democratic candidates 
(Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) is 8.87, in comparison with only 7.47 for the three 
Republican candidates other than Trump (Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio), more 
than a whole grade level lower.
The second stage of the research included an analysis of the 20 transcripts by three 
engines (read-able.com, readability-score.com, and readabilityformulas.com), which 
provided the grade-level scores for both the SMOG and Gunning-Fog formulas. The 
results in Table S7 (in the Online Appendix) show the average of each formula, in com-
parison with the Flesch–Kincaid grade-level formula and the total average of all three 
grade-level formulas for each candidate.
The average grade-level score of Donald Trump in all 10 transcripts for the SMOG 
index is 5.17 (1.2 grade level above the Flesch–Kincaid average) and 6.40 in the 
Other candidates’ transcripts

Gunning-Fog index (2.4 above Flesch–Kincaid and 1.23 above SMOG). The average of 
Donald Trump’s grade level in all three grade-level formulas is 5.18, or fifth-grade read-
ing ease (Figure 2), in comparison with a calculated average of 8.95 for all other candi-
dates. This comparison shows that there is still a gap of almost four grade levels (3.77) 
between the total score of Donald Trump (5.18) and the total score of the other candidates 
(8.95). Figure 2 and Table 1 (Table S8 in the Online Appendix) also show that there are 
almost five grade levels between Hillary Clinton (10.03) and Trump (5.18).

The candidate who scored the lowest total average among the other candidates, Marco 
Rubio (8.35), is still more than three grade levels above Trump. These results also show 
that the Democratic candidates (Clinton and Sanders) tend to speak at a higher grade 
level, in general, than the Republican candidates—an average of 9.65 for Clinton and 
Sanders together, in comparison with 8.47 for the three Republican candidates together, 
or 7.65 if Trump is included.
In comparison, the average of all other candidates in the SMOG index is 8.17 (0.14 
above Flesch–Kincaid) and 10.63 in the Gunning-Fog grade level (which is 2.6 above 
Flesch–Kincaid and 2.46 above SMOG). The average of all the other candidates in all 
three grade-level formulas is 8.95 or ninth-grade reading ease.
Donald Trump’s interview on FOX (13 December 2015) scored the lowest total aver-
age grade level of all three formulas, 4.82, while Hillary Clinton’s interview on NPR (20 
January 2016) scored the highest total grade level in all three formulas, 10.28.
The results of other aspects that were analyzed, including the percentage of complex 
words, the average number of words per sentence, the average number of syllables per word, 
and the average number of characters per word for Trump and each of the other candidates 
(Table S10 in the Online Appendix), show that Trump’s transcripts scored significantly lower 
than all the other candidates, in all aspects. The average percentage of complex words in 
Donald Trump’s transcripts is 7.32%, in comparison with 11.38% for all the other candidates. 
A more significant gap was measured in the average words per sentence: Trump’s average 
sentence length is only 9.91 words, in comparison with 16.89 for all the other candidates. It 
is interesting to note that Hillary Clinton’s average sentence length (19.99) is more than twice 
as long as Trump’s (9.91) (Figure 3 and Table 2, or Table S10 in the Online Appendix).
In terms of the average number of syllables per word and characters per word (word 
length), Trump also scored lower numbers than all the other candidates. Trump’s average 
number of syllables per word is 1.33, in comparison with 1.44 for the other candidates, 
and his average number of characters per word is 3.78, in comparison with 4.2 for all 
other candidates (see Table 2, or Table S10 in the Online Appendix).
Discussion
The results of this research confirm that Trump’s language is significantly simpler and 
consists of shorter sentences and words than any other candidate in the 2016 US

Presidential Primaries. In the Flesch–Kincaid formula, Trump scored an average grade 
level of fourth grade (3.96), in comparison with a calculated average of eighth grade 
(8.03) for all the other candidates. The weighted average of all three grade-level formu-
las (Flesch–Kincaid, SMOG, and Gunning-Fog) resulted in higher scores, but the four-
grade gap remained: 5.18 for Donald Trump, in comparison with 8.95 for the other 
candidates. These results mean that Trump’s language is accessible to and understood 
by wider audiences than that of his fellow candidates. According to Flesch’s reading 
ease index (Table S1 in the Online Appendix), the estimated percentage of American 
adults who can understand a fifth-grade text is 93%, in comparison with 83% who can 
understand an eighth-to ninth-grade level text. This means that Trump’s language is 
more accessible and understood by approximately 10% more American adults than the 
average of all the other candidates.

It is notable that Hillary Clinton’s average grade level (10.03—almost twice that of 
Trump’s) is estimated to be understood by even fewer American adults—only 54%, 
according to Flesch. As mentioned in the introduction, the National Adult Literacy 
Study (1993, the most recent that was carried out with an association with grade levels), 
also indicated that the average adult in the US reads at a seventh-grade level (DuBay, 
2004). It can thus be concluded that Trump’s language enables him to address signifi-
cantly broader audiences. Hillary Clinton’s results reflect an opposite approach from 
Trump’s in all other analyzed aspects as well. Clinton scored an average of 19.99 
words per sentence, more than twice Trump’s (9.91), an average of 11.35% complex 
words (Trump: only 7.32%), 1.44 syllables per words (Trump: 1.33), and an average 
of 4.2 characters (letters) per word (Trump: 3.78). In most aspects, Clinton and 
Sanders, the Democratic leading candidates, scored higher than the Republican 
candidates.
The results reveal significant differences in readability and simplicity in accordance 
with party affiliation: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have an average of 18.94 words 
per sentence combined, while the Republican candidates’ (Bush, Cruz and Rubio) aver-
age words per sentence is only 15.5 (if Trump is included, the average drops to 14.1). 
Republican candidates also scored lower grade levels in all grade level formulas—9.96 
compared with 8.47 (or 7.65 if Trump is included), which means that the Democratic 
candidates tend to speak at more than a whole grade-level higher than the Republicans. 
Further research may shed more light on these differences between the parties in terms of 
their language simplicity and anti-intellectualism. However, the differences between the 
Republican and Democratic candidates are minor in comparison to the differences 
between each candidate and those of Donald Trump.
The results also suggest that Donald Trump represents a radicalization of the anti-
intellectualism trend. As Lim (2008) shows, there has been a decline in the readability 
level of leaders—from a college graduate level in the 1800s to less than an eighth-grade 
level in the 2000s. Lim (2008) also shows a sharp decline in sentence length from 40–60 
words in the 1790s to less than 20 words in the 2000s (see Figures S12 and S13 in the 
Online Appendix). Trump’s words, as this study shows, are significantly shorter and less 
complex than any of his fellow candidates (only 7.32% complex words, in comparison 
with 11.38% for all other candidates), and Trump’s average number of syllables per word 
(1.36) and characters per word (3.78) are also lower than any other candidate (see Table 
2, or Table S10 in the Online Appendix). These results suggest that Trump is ahead of his 
time in his level of simplicity and continues the trend of anti-intellectualism.
Conclusion
Trump is not a typical politician. Coming from the business world, where he had already 
proved his skills and success, he entered the world of politics and asked the public to sup-
port him. In less than a year, he left his Republican rivals behind and was formally nomi-
nated to represent the Republican Party in the 2016 presidential election. A few months 
later, he was elected as the 45th President of the United States.
His phenomenal success is overwhelming. How did an American billionaire with no 
previous political experience become, in a less than a year and a half, the president of the 
most powerful country in the world? This will probably be a question for future research 
in many different academic fields, including political science, social science, rhetoric, 
and more. The current study explores this success from a linguistic perspective.

Political Studies Review 
By tracing the readability and simplicity of Trump’s language during his presiden-
tial primary campaign, the study reveals that Trump speaks at a fourth- to fifth-grade 
level, which was shown to be four to five grade levels below the average score of the 
other analyzed candidates. Furthermore, the findings reveal that Trump chooses to 
speak in significantly simpler language by using short sentences and words. These 
findings suggest that, among other aspects, Trump’s language differentiated him from 
any other politician America has seen and helped convey his message to a higher per-
centage of people. The findings are also in accordance with Lim’s (2008) findings that 
show a gradual decline in the readability level of American presidents, from a univer-
sity/college level in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to an eighth-grade level in 
the twentieth century, as well as a decline in the average number of words per 
sentence.
Trump’s usage of simple, straightforward and anti-intellectualist rhetoric was an 
intrinsic part of his campaigning strategy. His overwhelming success in the political 
field suggests that using simple, low-grade-level language may benefit some politi-
cians in terms of addressing a wider audience and conveying clearer and simpler mes-
sages that sound more colloquial and less politically oriented. Furthermore, the fact 
that this kind of rhetoric proves its effectiveness also says something about the public, 
or at least about American society. It implies that the public today appreciates straight-
forwardness and the use of simple, or even colloquial, language. It is weary of the 
“old” politics and what it stands for and has come to admire the anti-intellectual leader.
