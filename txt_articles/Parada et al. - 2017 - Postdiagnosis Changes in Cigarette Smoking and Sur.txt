Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study was to examine whether at-diagnosis smoking and postdiagnosis changes in smoking
within five years after breast cancer were associated with long-term all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality.
Methods: A population-based cohort of 1508 women diagnosed with first primary in situ or invasive breast cancer in 1996 to
1997 were interviewed shortly after diagnosis and again approximately five years later to assess smoking history. Participants
were followed for vital status through December 31, 2014. After 18þ years of follow-up, 597 deaths were identified, 237 of
which were breast cancer related. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
Results: Compared with never smokers, risk of all-cause mortality was elevated among the 19% of at-diagnosis smokers
(HR ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 1.36 to 2.11), those who smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day (HR ¼ 1.85, 95% CI ¼ 1.42 to 2.40), women
who had smoked for 30 or more years (HR ¼ 1.62, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 2.05), and women who had smoked 30 or more pack-years
(HR ¼ 1.82, 95% CI ¼ 1.39 to 2.37). Risk of all-cause mortality was further increased among the 8% of women who were at-/post-
diagnosis smokers (HR ¼ 2.30, 95% CI ¼ 1.56 to 3.39) but was attenuated among the 11% women who quit smoking after diag-
nosis (HR ¼ 1.83, 95% CI ¼ 1.32 to 2.52). Compared with never smokers, breast cancer–specific mortality risk was elevated 60%
(HR ¼ 1.60, 95% CI ¼ 0.79 to 3.23) among at-/postdiagnosis current smokers, but the confidence interval included the null value
and elevated 175% (HR ¼ 2.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.26 to 5.99) when we considered postdiagnosis cumulative pack-years.
Conclusions: Smoking negatively impacts long-term survival after breast cancer. Postdiagnosis cessation of smoking may re-
duce the risk of all-cause mortality. Breast cancer survivors may benefit from aggressive smoking cessation programs starting
as early as the time of diagnosis.
Breast cancer is a serious public health problem in the United
States, with more than 250 000 new breast cancer cases expected
in 2017 (1). Although there have been vast improvements in breast
cancer treatment over the last few decades (2) and breast cancer
survival rates are high, estimated at 90% at five years after diagno-
sis, approximately 40000 women will die from breast cancer in
2017 (1). This makes breast cancer the second leading cause of
cancer-related death among women (1). The high incidence of
breast cancer together with the high rate of survival contribute to
an estimated 3.1 million breast cancer survivors (3).
After breast cancer diagnosis, survivors may be motivated to
make behavioral and lifestyle changes if they believe it will help

 improve prognosis, quality of life, and survival (4). For the 10%
to 20% of women who are smokers at the time of breast cancer
diagnosis (5,6), smoking cessation is one important behavioral
change
that
may
improve
survival
after
breast
cancer.
Cigarettes are known to contain more than 7000 chemicals, in-
cluding 69 known carcinogens such as benzene, arsenic, formal-
dehyde, vinyl chloride, N-nitrosamines, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) (7). Therefore, it is not surprising that the
association between smoking and breast cancer incidence has
been extensively studied; at least 130 epidemiologic studies
have examined this association, yet there is no scientific con-
sensus (8). In addition to differences in study design and expo-
sure
assessment,
the
conflicting
results
may
in
part
be
explained by both the carcinogenic and estrogenic effects of cig-
arette smoke constituents on breast epithelial cells (9,10) and
the anti-estrogenic effects of smoking on menstrual function
(11,12). In their meta-analysis of more than 991 100 women
from 15 cohort studies, Gaudet and colleagues reported a 12%
increase in breast cancer incidence, which was further elevated
among women who initiated smoking before a first birth and
among
women
who
developed
estrogen
receptor–positive
(ER þ ) tumors (8). The few studies of smoking at the time of di-
agnosis and survival after breast cancer conducted to date con-
sistently report a positive association between smoking and
breast cancer–specific mortality (6,13–23). However, to date only
one study (24) has prospectively considered the impact of post-
diagnosis changes in smoking on survival.
This current study aimed to examine whether smoking at
the time of diagnosis and changes in smoking within five years
after diagnosis were associated with long-term all-cause and
breast cancer mortality among a population-based sample of
women diagnosed with first primary breast cancer.
Methods
We used resources from the Long Island Breast Cancer Study
Project (LIBCSP), a population-based study of newly diagnosed
breast cancer cases who were residents of Nassau and Suffolk
counties on Long Island, New York, at the time of diagnosis.
Details of the LIBCSP design have been published previously
(25,26). Institutional review board approval was obtained from
all participating institutions and in accordance with an assur-
ance filed with and approved by the US Department of Health
and Human Services.
Study Population
English-speaking women with a first primary diagnosis of in
situ or invasive breast cancer were identified for inclusion using
rapid-case ascertainment via active daily or weekly contact
with local hospitals and confirmed by a physician and medical
records. Additional eligibility criteria included being older than
age 20 years and a resident of Nassau or Suffolk county on Long
Island, New York, at the time of diagnosis between August 1,
1996, and July 31, 1997. The study reported here includes the
1508 case women who were interviewed at baseline, on average
within three months of diagnosis (mean ¼ 3.19 months). These
women were primarily white (94%), with a mean age of 59 years
(range ¼ 25–98 years), and postmenopausal (68%) at diagnosis
(Table 1).
Of the 1508 women who provided signed informed consent
and completed the 100-minute, in-home, interviewer-adminis-
tered,
structured
baseline
questionnaire,
1414
agreed
to
continued contact. Approximately five years after the initial di-
agnosis of breast cancer, these 1414 women were recontacted
for the follow-up interview. Informed consent was obtained by
telephone from 1120 of the 1414 women (ie, 143 refused by mail
or telephone, no proxy was identified for 96 women who were
not alive at follow-up, and 55 could not be located). Of the 1120
consenting women, 65 were only able to provide limited infor-
mation and 22 were refusals after consent and were therefore
excluded. A 45-minute interviewer-administered, structured
questionnaire
that
assessed
information
similar
to
that
obtained at the time of diagnosis but regarding the time period
since the initial diagnosis of breast cancer was completed by
telephone by 1033 (68.5%) women, on average 5.48 years after
diagnosis (range ¼ 4.39–7.34 years) (27).
Smoking Assessment
Smoking history, including smoking status, intensity, and dura-
tion, was determined via interviewer-administered question-
naires at baseline and at five-year follow-up (28). Smokers were
defined as women who smoked at least one cigarette a day for
six months or longer. Smoking status at baseline was defined as
never, former, and current smoking in the year before diagnosis,
and smoking status at the follow-up was similarly defined, but
in the year before the follow-up interview. Intensity of smoking,
or the number of cigarettes smoked per day, was categorized as
fewer than 20 cigarettes per day and 20 or more cigarettes per
day. Duration of smoking, or the total number of years of smok-
ing excluding any time periods the women reported having not
smoked, was categorized as less than 15 years, 15 to less than
30 years, and 30 or more years of smoking. Cigarette pack-years
was calculated by multiplying the average number of cigarette
packs smoked per day and the total number of years of smoking
and was categorized as less than 15 pack-years, 15 to less than
30 pack-years, and 30 or more pack-years. At baseline, smoking
cessation (recency) among former smokers was categorized as
less than five years, five to less than 10 years, and 10 or more
years. In the analyses of postdiagnosis changes in smoking,
each combination of at-diagnosis/postdiagnosis smoking was
examined (ie, never/never smokers, former/former smokers,
current/former smokers, and current/current smokers).
Covariate Assessment
Covariates were assessed by interviewer-administered ques-
tionnaire. Potential confounders were selected using directed
acyclic graphs (29) and putative relationships based on previous
studies of smoking and breast cancer survival. These covariates
included age at diagnosis (years), total annual household in-
come (<$15 000–$24 999, $25 000–$49 999, and �$50 000), educa-
tion (<high school or high school graduate, some college or
college graduate, and postcollege), marital status (married or
living as married vs not married, divorced, or widowed), body
mass index (continuous, kg/m2), at-diagnosis recreational phys-
ical activity (never, former, and current physical activity of least
one hour per week for three months or more), and at-diagnosis
intake of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, or liquor
(never, former, and current intake at least once a month for six
months or more).
Estrogen receptor status and nodal involvement were deter-
mined by medical record review, and tumor size was obtained
from the New York State Cancer Registry. At baseline, women
were interviewed after surgery but before initiation of most

 other components of the first course of treatment for the first
primary breast cancer. Therefore, treatment received (radiation
therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy) was assessed by
self-report at the follow-up questionnaire, which showed high
agreement with medical record data (radiation therapy j ¼ 0.97,
chemotherapy j ¼ 0.96, hormone therapy j ¼ 0.92) (30) but was
more complete.
Outcome Assessment
We used the National Death Index (NDI) (31) to ascertain date of
death and cause of death. Breast cancer–related deaths were
identified
using
International
Statistical
Classification
of
Diseases 9 (174.9) and 10 (C-50.9) codes for deaths occurring be-
fore and after 1999, respectively, listed on the death certificate.
Follow-up for mortality occurred from the date of diagnosis in
1996 to 1997 until December 31, 2014. The median duration of
follow-up was 17.61 years (range ¼ 0.23–18.41 years). Among the
1508 women, 597 deaths occurred by the end of follow-up at
18þ years, 237 of which were breast cancer related.
Statistical Analysis
We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to esti-
mate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
the associations between at-diagnosis as well as at-/postdiagno-
sis cigarette smoking and all-cause and breast cancer–specific
mortality. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed
by visual inspection of Kaplan-Meier curves and by testing
exposure-by-time interactions in Cox models; no violations of
the proportional hazards assumptions were observed. All analy-
ses were done using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression func-
tion in IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)
and used never smokers as the referent group.
In the analyses of at-diagnosis smoking, survival time began
at the date of breast cancer diagnosis and continued until the
earlier of date of death or December 31, 2014. Age-adjusted and
multivariable-adjusted models were fit for each of the expo-
sures separately and for all-cause and breast cancer–specific
mortality. The analyses of at-diagnosis smoking were not ad-
justed for disease and treatment characteristics, which occur
and are ascertained after diagnosis and therefore do not meet
the
temporal
condition
necessary
to
be
confounders.
Furthermore, disease and treatment characteristics could be
mediators if, for example, smoking influences the likelihood of
estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, which influences
treatment and subsequent prognosis (8).
The analyses of postdiagnosis change in smoking were re-
stricted to the 1339 women who survived at least five years after
diagnosis. Accordingly, survival time began at the date of com-
pletion of the follow-up questionnaire to the date of death or
December 31, 2014, if alive. After excluding an additional seven
women who reported being former smokers before diagnosis
and current smokers at the follow-up questionnaire, the analytic
sample consisted of 1332 women. Of these, 377 (28%) were lost to
follow-up. Because a complete case analysis when data are not
missing completely at random is inefficient and can potentially
lead to biased results (32), we employed multiple imputation to
account for the missing data. Missing values were imputed using
SPSS, which employs a fully conditional specification (FCS)
algorithm (33). The FCS method is an iterative Markov Chain
Monte Carlo procedure that sequentially imputes missing values
for all covariates included starting from the first variable with
missing values by specifying a linear regression or logistic regres-
sion model for each continuous or categorical variable, respec-
tively. We used 25 imputations with 1000 iterations and included
demographics (age at diagnosis, menopausal status, income, ed-
ucation, marital status, body mass index, physical activity, and
alcohol intake), postdiagnosis smoking exposures (smoking sta-
tus, number of cigarettes smoked per day at follow-up [mini-
mum ¼ 0], cumulative years of smoking [minimum ¼ 0], and
cumulative pack-years of smoking [minimum ¼ 0]), disease char-
acteristics (stage, tumor size, nodal status, estrogen receptor sta-
tus), treatment (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone
therapy), and the outcome (the event indicator and the Nelson-
Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard) (34). The analyses of
postdiagnosis smoking were additionally adjusted for stage, tu-
mor size, nodal status, ER status, and chemotherapy treatment.
In this report, we present the results from the full case analysis;
however, the results of the complete case analysis for the age-
adjusted estimates are available in the Supplementary Material
(Supplementary Table 1, available online).
Results
Prevalence of Smoking Among Women With Breast
Cancer
Among the LIBCSP population-based sample of women diag-
nosed with first primary breast cancer in 1996 to 1997, 19%
reported smoking within a year of their diagnosis About five
years after diagnosis, 8% of women reported continued smoking
and 11% reported that they had quit smoking since diagnosis.
At-Diagnosis Smoking and Survival After Breast Cancer
Compared with never smokers, current smoking at the time of
breast cancer diagnosis was associated with a 69% increased
hazard (HR ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 1.36 to 2.11) of all-cause mortality
after covariate adjustment (Table 2). Risk of all-cause mortality
was increased 50% for current smokers who smoked fewer than
20 cigarettes per day and 85% for current smokers who smoked
20 or more cigarettes per day (HR ¼ 1.85, 95% CI ¼ 1.42 to 2.40).
Current smokers who had smoked for 15 to less than 30 years
had a 107% increased risk, and women who smoked 30 or more
years had a 62% increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR ¼ 1.62,
95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 2.05). All-cause mortality was also increased
among former smokers and current smokers who had smoked
30 or more pack-years (HR ¼ 1.82, 95% CI ¼ 1.39 to 2.37).
Additionally, risk of all-cause mortality was elevated among for-
mer smokers who had quit smoking within five years of diagno-
sis, but not among women who had quit smoking five or more
years before diagnosis. At-diagnosis smoking was not associ-
ated with breast cancer–specific mortality.
At-/Postdiagnosis Smoking and Survival After Breast
Cancer
Table 3 shows the results of the full case analyses utilizing the
imputed data, and Supplementary Table 1 (available online)
shows the results of the complete case analysis for the age-
adjusted estimates. Overall, the results of both analyses are
consistent. As shown in Table 3, the risk of all-cause mortality
was elevated 130% among women who continued smoking after
diagnosis as compared with never smokers, after covariate

 adjustment (HR ¼ 2.30, 95% CI ¼ 1.56 to 3.39). However, risk of
all-cause mortality was attenuated among women who quit
smoking after diagnosis (HR ¼ 1.83, 95% CI ¼ 1.32 to 2.52). This
pattern of association for women who quit smoking after diag-
nosis and women who continued smoking was consistent
across high smoking intensity and high cumulative duration of
smoking. However, women with 30 or more cumulative pack-
years of smoking who quit after diagnosis had a slightly greater
risk of mortality as compared with women who did not quit af-
ter diagnosis. These findings were similar among women with
invasive breast cancer only (Supplementary Table 2) and stron-
ger among women with ERþ breast cancer (Supplementary
Table 3), though data were sparse.
At-/postdiagnosis smoking status, intensity, and duration
were
not
statistically
significantly
associated
with
breast
cancer–specific mortality. However, we noted elevations in the
breast cancer–specific mortality rate among women who con-
tinued smoking after diagnosis (HR ¼ 1.60, 95% CI ¼ 0.79 to 3.23)
and among women who continued smoking fewer than 20 ciga-
rettes per day. Risk of breast cancer–specific mortality was ele-
vated among women who continued smoking and who had
smoked less than 30 cumulative pack-years (HR ¼ 2.75, 95% CI ¼
1.26 to 5.99). Due to small numbers, we were unable to estimate
the risk of mortality among women who continued smoking
and who had smoked 30 or more cumulative pack-years.

 with a 69% increase in the risk of long-term all-cause, but not
breast cancer–specific, mortality. Among women who contin-
ued smoking after breast cancer, the risk of all-cause mortality
was elevated 130%. However, among the approximately 20% of
women who quit smoking after diagnosis, the elevated mortal-
ity risk was attenuated. Additionally, among women who con-
tinued smoking, less than 30 cumulative pack-years of smoking
was associated with more than a twofold increase in the risk of
breast cancer–specific mortality.
While the carcinogenic constituents in tobacco smoke have
been hypothesized to increase the risk of incident breast cancer
(8), little is known about how these chemicals may increase risk
of recurrence and subsequent mortality. PAHs, which are
present in tobacco smoke, for example, can exert estrogenic as
well as anti-estrogenic effects (35) and may be important in
influencing survival in women with hormonally sensitive breast
tumors. Our findings of an association between at-diagnosis
smoking and all-cause, but not breast cancer–specific, mortality
are inconsistent with most studies conducted to date, which re-
port approximately a 30% increased risk (6); however, the confi-
dence interval, which ranged from 0.77 to 1.51, suggests that
these data may in fact be consistent. Among former smokers,
we observed a suggestive inverse association with breast cancer
mortality, which is consistent with at least two prior studies
(36,37). One possible explanation for this finding is that success-
ful
quitters

also

 including an increase in the use of routine clinical preventive
services such as mammographic screening (38).
Studies examining smoking and mortality after breast can-
cer have primarily examined at-diagnosis smoking only (6).
However, one recently published study (24) prospectively evalu-
ated changes in smoking status approximately six years after
breast cancer diagnosis, which is an approach similar to that
used in the study reported here. Although there were several
differences in the study population in the study by Passarelli
and colleagues, including the exclusion of women with in situ
disease and women with stage IV disease in their study,
Passarelli and colleagues reported similar estimates that were
slightly larger in magnitude than those reported here for
women who continued smoking after breast cancer for all-
cause (HR ¼ 2.57, 95% CI ¼ 2.06 to 3.21, vs 2.30, 95% CI ¼ 1.56 to
3.39, respectively) and breast cancer–specific (HR ¼ 1.73, 95%
CI ¼ 1.13 to 2.60, vs HR ¼ 1.60, 95% CI ¼ 0.79 to 3.23, respectively)
mortality.
These
differences
may
arise
from
different
approaches in addressing missing data. The response rate for
the completion of our follow-up assessment was approximately
70%, which is better than the 40% in the study by Passarelli
et al., and we addressed the missing data due to potential biases
that may arise from a complete case analysis only (32).
Similar to prior studies of smoking and mortality among
breast cancer survivors, our study has several limitations. First,
our assessments of smoking relied on self-report; however,
smoking history has been shown to be reliably recalled and self-
reported (39). Although women with newly diagnosed breast
cancer may misreport their smoking status, our prevalence esti-
mates for at-diagnosis (19%) (6) and postdiagnosis smoking (8%)
are consistent with prior studies (5,40). Second, although our
study shows that smoking may adversely impact survival, we
can only hypothesize about the underlying biological mecha-
nisms given the complex nature of tobacco smoke. It is possible
that our findings are confounded by changes in other behaviors
such as alcohol intake after diagnosis, which we were unable to
consider in the same models due to insufficient power; how-
ever, most studies of alcohol intake and breast cancer mortality
have been null (41). We also lacked information on specific
stage at diagnosis, an important determinant of survival, as
well as the reasons women quit smoking after diagnosis, both
of which could potentially confound the associations with post-
diagnosis smoking reported here. Third, the low number of
breast cancer–specific deaths, in particular for the analyses ex-
amining postdiagnosis changes in smoking, resulted in esti-
mates that were imprecise and may be one reason for any
discrepancies in our results with previous studies. Fourth, we
did not consider causes of death other than breast cancer, and
thus the results from breast cancer–specific analysis do not nec-
essarily translate into the absolute risk of this outcome (42).
However, our approach does accurately estimate the relative
hazard (rate) of breast cancer–specific death and thus addresses
how death from breast cancer is associated with smoking
(42,43). This is an etiologically relevant question given the po-
tential of cigarette smoke chemicals to disrupt the endocrine
system. Last, while our prospective study design allowed us to
assess changes in smoking status several years after breast can-
cer, a proportion of women were lost to follow-up and thus did
not complete the follow-up assessment; however, we addressed
the missing data using multiple imputation, resulting in valid
statistical inferences that properly reflect the uncertainty due to
missing values (44).
The results of our study show that smoking negatively
impacts long-term survival after breast cancer. These findings
support clinical opportunities for promoting smoking cessa-
tion
programs
targeted
to
women
newly
diagnosed
with
breast cancer and continued throughout the survivorship con-
tinuum in order to reduce the risk of mortality associated
with continued smoking. Emphasis should also be placed on
systematically assessing the impact of smoking history, smok-
ing status, and postdiagnosis changes in smoking on out-
comes in clinical trials, which often fail to account for this
important exposure (45).
