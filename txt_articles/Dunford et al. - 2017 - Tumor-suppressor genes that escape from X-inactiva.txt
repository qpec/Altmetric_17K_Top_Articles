Abstract
There is a striking and unexplained male predominance across many cancer types. A subset of X 
chromosome (chrX) genes can escape X-inactivation, which would protect females from complete 
functional loss by a single mutation. To identify putative “Escape from X-Inactivation Tumor 
Suppressor” (EXITS) genes, we compared somatic alterations from >4100 cancers across 21 
tumor types for sex bias. Six of 783 non-pseudoautosomal region (PAR) chrX genes (ATRX, 
CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) more frequently harbored loss-of-function 
mutations in males (based on false discovery rate <0.1), compared to zero of 18,055 autosomal 
and PAR genes (P<0.0001). Male-biased mutations in genes that escape X-inactivation were 
observed in combined analysis across many cancers and in several individual tumor types, 
suggesting a generalized phenomenon. We conclude that biallelic expression of EXITS genes in 
females explains a portion of the reduced cancer incidence compared to males across a variety of 
tumor types.

 Introduction
Based on SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program) data from 2008–
2012, US males carry an age-adjusted excess risk of 20.4% for developing any cancer (516.6 
versus 411.2 for females per 100,000 person-years) and ≥2:1 male predominance for some 
individual cancer types1. This excess risk results in approximately 153,000 additional new 
cases of cancer in US men annually. Yet, the male predominance in cancer incidence 
remains largely unexplained2. The disparities between men and women occur across the 
world, even after adjusting for differences in gross domestic product, geographical region, 
and environmental risk factors including tobacco exposure1, 3. In fact, changes in tobacco 
use among males and females over the past two decades have resulted in a marked reduction 
in the male:female (M:F) ratio of lung and bronchus cancer (Figure 1a). However, over the 
same time period, the M:F ratios for several cancers have remained >2:1, including those 
associated with tobacco use such as kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and oral cavity 
and pharynx cancers (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure 1).
Previous reports have identified chrX genes outside of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) 
with higher mutation frequencies in male cancers compared to female cancers4–6. For 
example, KDM6A at Xp11.2, which encodes the histone lysine demethylase UTX, has loss-
of-function mutations more predominately in male cancers across multiple subtypes4, 7. 
Among female cancers with KDM6A mutations, homozygous mutations are common7, 
suggesting that some tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) on chrX outside of the PAR follow the 
classic Knudson two-hit hypothesis in females8. This poses a conundrum because one chrX 
in all female cells undergoes X-inactivation during embryogenesis, which should leave each 
female cell functionally haploid for non-PAR genes on chrX9. However, a fraction of chrX 
genes “escape” inactivation and have biallelic expression, albeit with poorly understood 
mechanisms leading to differences across individuals and cell types10–14.
We hypothesized that mutations in TSGs that escape X-inactivation could underlie a 
significant fraction of excess male cancers, as males would require only a single deleterious 
mutation while females would require two (Figure 1b-c). We termed these genes ‘EXITS’, 
for Escape from X-Inactivation Tumor Suppressors (EXITS). In females with a mutation in 
an EXITS gene, a corollary of the EXITS hypothesis is that the other allele will be mutated 
or deleted (Figure 1c). ChrX is among the most frequently aneuploid chromosomes in 
female cancers15, and alteration of X-inactivation by targeted deletion of Xist promotes 
tumorigenesis16.
Similarly, Y chromosome (chrY) loss is observed in ≥30% of male renal cell, head and neck, 
and bladder cancers15, 17, 18. Age-related loss of chrY in non-malignant blood cells is 
frequent, is increased among tobacco users, and is associated with an approximately 3.5-fold 
higher risk for developing a non-hematological cancer19, 20. The Y chromosome harbors 
evolutionarily ancestral homologs of a small fraction of non-PAR chrX genes. ChrX genes 
with chrY homologs are known to be more likely to escape X-inactivation21, 22. In some 
cases, chrY genes can rescue viability or other phenotypes upon loss of their chrX 
homologs23, 24, although for most genes there is not clear evidence of functional 
redundancy. Thus, a second corollary to the EXITS hypothesis is that chrY loss will co-

 occur in male tumors that have mutated an EXITS gene with a functional chrY homolog 
(Figure 1c).
Results
Male-biased loss-of-function mutations on the X chromosome in cancer
To test the EXITS hypothesis, we performed an unbiased analysis of paired tumor/germline 
exome sequencing data from 4126 patients across 21 tumor types from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) and Broad Institute datasets (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 
2). In 1994 cases, copy number variation data was also available based on high-density 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The tumors analyzed excluded sex-restricted 
cancers such as prostate and ovarian cancer, as well as breast cancer.
We used a conservative mutation classification algorithm to ensure that the included variants 
were restricted to somatic truncating and missense alterations that were most likely loss-of-
function (“LOF”, see Methods), or DNA copy number (CN) loss of at least one allele 
(Supplementary Figure 3). We applied a permutation analysis to determine which genes 
were mutated in males at frequencies higher than expected based on the overall mutation 
rates in males and females for each tumor type and normalized to the number of X 
chromosomes. We performed this analysis for only LOF mutations (SNVs and InDels) in the 
4126 patients with exome data and then again for LOF mutation or CN loss (LOF 
mutation/CN loss) in the 1994 patients with both exome and copy number data available.
At a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1, there were no autosomal or PAR genes (n=18,055) that 
had LOF mutations more frequently in male cancers. In addition, at FDR<0.1 no genes on 
chrX had a significantly increased frequency of silent coding mutations in male cancers, and 
no genes on chrX had non-silent LOF mutations more frequently in female cancers 
(Supplementary Tables 2–4). In contrast, at FDR<0.1, six of 783 non-PAR chrX genes 
(ATRX, CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) harbored LOF mutation or 
LOF mutation/CN loss more frequently in male cancers (P<0.0001 compared to zero of 
18,055 autosomal or PAR genes; Table 1, Figure 2a-b, and Supplementary Tables 5–6). Of 
note, ATRX25, 26, DDX3X27, KDM5C28, and KDM6A29 have been previously implicated as 
TSGs, via recurrent loss-of-function alterations in cancer genomes and/or by direct 
experimental evidence.
We performed the same permutation analysis in each of the 21 cancer types individually to 
discover tissue- or disease-restricted EXITS genes. LOF mutation/CN loss was enriched in 
ATRX among male lower-grade gliomas (LGG; FDR<10−4) and in KDM5C among male 
clear cell kidney cancers (KIRC, FDR=0.044) (Table 1, Figure 2c-d). There were no 
autosomal or PAR genes with male-biased LOF mutation in any of the individual cancer 
types at FDR<0.1.
To assess the robustness of these findings, we then used a second statistical test on the same 
dataset based on a log likelihood ratio, which also normalizes to the background male and 
female mutation rates in each tumor type and the number of X chromosomes (see Methods). 
Five (CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3) of the 6 genes were re-

 discovered as significantly more frequently mutated across all male cancers in this analysis 
(FDR<0.1), as were ATRX in male LGG and KDM5C in male KIRC (Supplementary Figure 
4 and Supplementary Table 7).
EXITS gene alterations associated with excess male cancers
Adult lower-grade gliomas occur at a M:F ratio of ~1.4:1 (or 58.3% male:41.7% female)30. 
Considering that 42% of male LGGs in our dataset had ATRX mutations compared to 26% 
of female LGGs, approximately 80% of the excess male LGGs in our cohort had ATRX 
mutations. Similarly, 8.6% of the excess male head and neck squamous cell carcinomas had 
KDM6A mutations and 12.1% of the excess male clear cell kidney cancer had KDM5C 
mutations (see Methods for calculations). However, these figures are undoubtedly an 
underestimate of the total contribution of male-biased alterations in these diseases because 
they only consider stringently defined, loss-of-function mutations within coding regions, and 
they are limited by the sample size of our datasets.
To address the latter limitation, we calculated the number of tumor/normal pairs needed for 
80% power to detect a coding LOF mutation on chrX with a significant male bias given 
different M:F disease incidence ratios, basal mutation rates, and prevalence of an alteration 
in a specific population (Figure 3a). For example, clear cell kidney cancer (KIRC) has a M:F 
incidence ratio of ~2:1 and therefore, as expected, ~50% of all mutations on the X 
chromosome across all KIRCs are in males because they have only one chrX. If an EXITS 
gene were mutated in 5% of all KIRCs it would require sequencing >1000 tumors to have 
80% power to detect a 4-fold male mutation bias. Therefore, many additional cancers, 
including hundreds of tumor types not represented in this dataset, will need to be assessed 
before the contribution of EXITS genes to overall excess male cancer risk can be fully 
quantified. This calculation provides target sample sizes for such studies.
The expression of EXITS genes could also be downregulated in the absence of coding 
mutations by several mechanisms, including non-coding mutations or epigenetic changes. 
We analysed exome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data by patient sex from head and 
neck squamous cancer and clear cell kidney cancer. Essentially all tumors with 
downregulation of EXITS genes (defined as expression <5th percentile of the male cancers) 
in the absence of a DNA mutation were from males (22/469 males vs 2/218 females for 
DDX3X, P=0.012 by Fisher’s exact test; 16/450 males vs 2/216 females for KDM5C, 
P=0.071; 23/465 males vs 2/217 females for KDM6A, P=0.0077; Figure 3b). Whole genome 
sequencing of a large number of tumors will be necessary to determine whether noncoding 
mutations on chrX underlie EXITS gene downregulation.
EXITS gene mutations associated with loss of the paired chrY or chrX
Next, we asked whether additional genes that escape X inactivation or have Y homologs 
may also function as EXITS genes. We compiled a list of 59 chrX genes with evidence of X-
inactivation escape in multiple contexts from studies of human lymphoblastoid cells and 
hybrid fibroblasts12, 13, 31 (Supplementary Table 8). These 59 genes had a higher M:F ratio 
of LOF mutation/CN loss compared to other chrX genes (P=0.022; Supplementary Figure 
5a). Similarly, we identified 17 chrX genes with predicted functional Y homologs21

 (Supplementary Table 8) and found that they had a trend toward higher M:F ratio for LOF 
mutation/CN loss compared to other chrX genes (P=0.058; Supplementary Figure 5b).
If we exclude the 6 genes we identified as EXITS genes, there was no discernible male 
mutation bias among either the 56 remaining escape genes or the remaining 14 chrX genes 
with functional chrY homologs (Figure 3c-d). However, we may have failed to identify 
additional EXITS genes from our dataset because of power limitations that result from 
agnostically assessing all coding genes. A permutation test limited to genes previously 
reported to either escape X-inactivation (n=59) or have chrY homologs in humans or in 
recent mammalian evolution (n=33)21 identified two additional genes with higher 
frequencies of LOF mutation and/or CN loss in male cancers (FDR<0.1): NLGN4X and 
RBM10 (Supplementary Table 9). Previous functional data supported RBM10 as a bona fide 
tumor suppressor gene32.
We next tested the hypothesis that EXITS genes will harbor biallelic inactivation when 
mutated in female tumors. We used SNP array data to infer which female tumors had lost an 
entire chrX and compared this to the incidence of LOF mutation or focal CN loss on the 
remaining chrX (Supplementary Figure 3). Female tumors with EXITS mutations were more 
likely to have lost the whole other chrX than tumors without EXITS mutations (23.3% 
[10/43] vs 6.2% [45/726], P=0.0005 by Fisher’s exact test), suggesting an enrichment for 
biallelic loss. In addition, 6.3% of the female tumors with an EXITS mutation had two LOF 
mutations in that gene, although with short read sequencing we are unable to determine 
whether these are in cis or trans.
To determine whether chrY loss is enriched among male tumors with EXITS gene 
mutations, we utilized a conservative approach to classify chrY copy number based on 
exome sequencing data across 1443 male tumors in our dataset (Supplementary Figure 6 and 
Supplementary Methods). Male tumors with loss-of-function mutations in any of the three 
EXITS genes with Y homologs (DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A) had a trend toward 
enrichment for chrY loss compared to tumors without mutations (10.2% [9/88] versus 5.8% 
[78/1355], P=0.077). Male tumors with an LOF mutation in any chrX gene with a predicted 
functional Y homolog were more likely to have lost chrY than those without (10.6% 
[15/142] versus 5.5% [72/1301], P=0.019). Therefore, age- and tobacco-associated 
spontaneous loss of chrY could disproportionately increase the frequency of some cancers in 
males, as LOF mutation/CN loss of EXITS genes with functional chrY homologs would 
lead to complete gene inactivation in male cells that have lost chrY (Figure 1c)19.
To assess the relative functional contribution of X-X pairs in females compared to X-Y 
homologs in males, we determined the rate of concurrent mutation and chrX loss in female 
tumors with the rate of concurrent mutation and chrY loss in male tumors for the three 
EXITS genes with Y homologs (DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A). Female tumors with 
LOF/CN mutations were more likely to lose chrX than male tumors with LOF/CN mutations 
were to lose chrY (36% [9/25] versus 8.2% [6/73], P=0.0022). This result suggests that the 
chrY homologs in males may not have equivalent tumor suppressor activity to EXITS gene 
alleles on the inactivated chrX in females.

 ATRX and CNKSR2: hypothesis generation from sex-biased mutation patterns
Among the EXITS genes we identified, DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A are recognized 
escape genes across multiple tissues12, 13. CNKSR2 and MAGEC3 were more recently 
suggested to escape as determined by next-generation sequencing and epigenetic analyses33. 
There are data in human cell lines showing ATRX escape using RNA-FISH34, 35 but ATRX 
has not been traditionally classified among the escape genes12, 13, 21, 31. The ATRX locus is 
located in a chrX region that contains multiple escape genes and/or Y homologs in lower 
mammals21 and ATRX escapes in human trophoblast cells36. Nearly all of the excess male 
cancers with ATRX mutations in our dataset were in lower-grade gliomas (Table 1). We 
therefore hypothesized that ATRX may escape X-inactivation, but only in certain contexts 
possibly including in the brain. Tissue-specific and inter-individual variation in escape are 
recognized phenomena that have been described previously14, 33.
We took two approaches using RNA-seq to demonstrate evidence of X-inactivation escape in 
putative EXITS genes in tumors and normal tissues: allele-specific expression in female 
cells and male vs. female expression levels. At germline heterozygous single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) sites in coding regions from tumors without somatic mutations in the 
tested genes, we observed evidence of biallelic expression of ATRX, KDM6A, KDM5C, and 
DDX3X in one or more of six tumor types (GBM, LGG, HNSC, KIRC, LUAD, LUSC) in 
which we had identified male-biased mutations (Supplementary Figure 7). This included 
tumor types where male-biased mutations were significant in single cancer analysis (e.g., 
ATRX in LGG, KDM5C in KIRC). We also analyzed female and male expression levels of 
EXITS genes in tumors without mutations, because escape from X-inactivation often results 
in higher expression in female cells11. DDX3X, KDM5C, and KDM6A had higher 
expression in non-mutated female compared to male tumors across all types tested. Notably, 
ATRX was only higher in female LGG and CNKSR2 only in female LUAD, the tumor types 
for each gene where the male loss-of-function mutation bias was also seen (Supplementary 
Figure 8).
To analyze biallelic expression in normal tissues, we queried data from the Genotype-Tissue 
Expression (GTEx) Project, which includes RNA-seq from multiple tissue types in non-
diseased individuals37. Within local tissue environments X-inactivation can be skewed 
toward one chromosome as a result of a shared developmental origin38, which might allow 
detection of escape from X-inactivation if the GTEx biopsy demonstrated higher minor 
allele expression for escape compared to ‘known’ non-escape genes. Indeed, that is what we 
observed for EXITS genes, including high minor allele expression of ATRX in brain 
biopsies from several donors in multiple anatomic sites suggesting X-inactivation escape 
(P<0.0001 vs non-escape genes in cortex, P=0.0224 in cerebellum by K-S test; 
Supplementary Figure 9).
We also analyzed EXITS gene expression by sex in normal tissue biopsies from GTEx. In 
contrast with other tissues or in male brain, ATRX expression in female brain showed two 
distribution peaks and was best fit by models of bimodality (P=0.04; Supplementary Figure 
10a-b). We compared female and male expression for the six EXITS genes across multiple 
tissues and found that while most have higher expression in females in all measurable sites, 
evidence for ATRX escape is limited to female brain (Supplementary Figure 10c). These

 data also suggest that ATRX undergoes heterogeneous escape from X-inactivation in female 
brain. Further studies will be required to understand if ATRX escape is restricted to certain 
brain cell subsets or regions, or if there is inter-female heterogeneity in escape status, and 
how these could contribute to male-bias among ATRX-mutated gliomas.
CNKSR2 was not previously implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in large sequencing 
studies39. It encodes a putative Ras pathway scaffolding protein implicated in an X-linked 
neurodevelopmental disorder40. Depletion of Cnksr2 from murine 3T3 fibroblasts using two 
independent lentiviral shRNAs resulted in expression changes that were enriched in genes 
associated with oncogene signatures by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in the 
Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, Broad Institute) C2:CGP collection41, including 
transformation by HRAS, KRAS, and the Ras-like protein RHOA (Supplementary Figure 
11a-c, Supplementary Table 10). In addition, we queried the 50 “Hallmarks” MSigDB 
datasets of general cellular function42, a combined automatic and manual curation of 
>10,000 gene sets to overcome problems of redundancy and heterogeneity in GSEA. Cnksr2 
depletion was most enriched with signatures of MTOR and KRAS signaling (Supplementary 
Figure 11d, Supplementary Table 11). Consistent with activation of the RAS/MAPK 
pathway, cells expressing Cnksr2 shRNAs had increased ERK phosphorylation and 
enhanced colony-forming activity in soft agar, consistent with in vitro transformation 
(Supplementary Figure 11e-g). These findings demonstrate how genetic-epidemiologic 
associations such as sex bias may help distinguish driver from passenger events, and 
possibly identify cancer-associated genes with a higher likelihood of functional relevance.
Discussion
Escape from X-inactivation results in expression of two copies of a tumor suppressor gene in 
females whereas males only have one. The EXITS hypothesis is that biallelic expression of 
these genes affords females with enhanced cancer protection, which substantively 
contributes to the observed higher incidence of some tumors in males. Our data have 
provided evidence to support this hypothesis, as the genes with an increased incidence of 
loss-of-function mutations in males across many cancer types were exclusively non-PAR 
genes on chrX, including several that are known to be TSGs and/or known to escape X-
inactivation in certain contexts. Genes that do not normally escape X-inactivation could also 
function as EXITS in some situations, as it is recognized that aberrant or ‘leaky’ X-
inactivation/escape can occur in cancer cells35, 43. Additional studies are needed to identify 
the full complement of sex-biased cancer genes; these include the sequencing of more 
tumor/normal pairs to increase statistical power, assessments of non-coding genomes for 
additional mechanisms of EXITS gene inactivation, and the interrogation of additional 
tumor types not represented herein to identify disease-restricted sex-biased TSGs.
Undoubtedly, EXITS gene mutations are not the sole explanation for differences in cancer 
incidence between men and women. Alcohol use, tobacco exposure, and endocrine biology 
are known to affect cancer epidemiology, with the latter possibly causing female 
predominance of some cancers. However, these environmental and hormonal factors 
associated with sex-specific differences in cancer could interact with EXITS loci or their 
gene products to modulate cancer risk. For example, a clastogenic carcinogen could

 disproportionately affect men if the process of carcinogenesis involves inactivation of an 
EXITS gene or loss of chrY, as has been shown for tobacco smoking19. Similarly, enhancers 
or other regulatory elements on chrX that modulate autosomal gene transcription in trans 
could qualify as “noncoding EXITS” if their loss promotes carcinogenesis.
Another implication of our data is that male and female tumors of the same cancer type may 
have distinct genetics, separate from the number of X and Y chromosomes. These 
differences could be directly related to the impact of EXITS mutations on disease biology or 
drug response. Alternatively, they could result in more general effects in a population 
because male and female cancers of a specific type may be effectively distinct diseases (i.e., 
male tumors without EXITS mutations might behave similarly to female tumors, while 
EXITS-mutated cancers could have their own biology). To begin to explore these 
possibilities, we propose that clinical oncology studies should be statistically powered to 
understand sex-specific differences in outcomes that result from distinct tumor genetics. In 
addition, pre-clinical models can be generated to address the relative contributions of cell-
intrinsic and cell-extrinsic differences between male and female cancers.
Finally, we note that several of the EXITS genes identified herein have also been implicated 
in germline genetic neurodevelopmental diseases40, 44–47, and that non-malignant disorders 
with a significantly higher risk among males (e.g. autism48, schizophrenia49) have been 
associated with polymorphisms on chrX. These data suggest that, besides the obvious link 
between male sex and monogenic diseases associated with chrX gene mutation, the haploid 
nature of chrX in males may increase the risk of developing polygenic diseases other than 
cancer.

 Figure 1. Escape from X-inactivation Tumor Suppressor (EXITS) genes
(a) SEER data of annual incidence rates over time for the indicated cancer types in males 
(blue), females (green), or all patients (black). (b-c) The EXITS hypothesis: (b) 
“Traditional” tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) on chrX are represented in the top row for 
females and males. A single deleterious mutation in a TSG is equally likely to occur in male 
and female cancers because males have only one chrX, and females have one active chrX 
(Xa, pink) and one inactive chrX (Xi, purple). (c) On the bottom row is a model for EXITS 
gene behavior. In females, there are two active alleles of EXITS genes and therefore females

 are protected from complete gene loss after a single alteration. Complete inactivation of an 
EXITS gene may require biallelic mutations, or mutation with loss of the other chrX. In 
males, one mutation could inactivate the only allele of an EXITS gene that has no functional 
Y homolog, and therefore males would be more likely to develop cancers associated with 
mutations in those TSGs. Alternatively, because some genes that escape X inactivation have 
chrY homologs with redundant function, cancers with mutations in those genes would be 
more likely to occur in males who also have somatic loss of chrY.

 Figure 2. Genes with higher frequencies of somatic loss-of-function (LOF) alterations in male 
cancers
Permutation testing for genes on chrX across all cancer datasets is shown. The log2 M:F 
ratio of events is plotted for each gene against the significance (P) value. The size and color 
of each circle represent the number of (a) LOF mutations, or (b) LOF mutation/CN loss 
events in that gene. Genes with significantly higher (FDR<0.1) frequencies of mutation in 
male cancers are identified. Disease-specific permutation testing of LOF mutations in (c) 
lower-grade glioma and (d) clear cell kidney cancer is shown.

males and females). Lines represent the percentage of cancers in a given tumor type that

Table 1
Genes with significantly (FDR<0.1) increased male (M) : female (F) mutation ratio identified by permutation analysis
Significance values are based on deviation of the observed mutation incidence in a specific gene relative to that expected in a given set. This approach 
normalizes to the number of male and female cancers (and to the number of X chromosomes), and to the background mutation incidence in male and 
female cancers in a given set.
