Parasite host switches may trigger disease emergence, but prehistoric host ranges are often
unknowable. Lymphatic filariasis and loiasis are major human diseases caused by the insect-
borne filarial nematodes Brugia, Wuchereria and Loa. Here we show that the genomes of these
nematodes and seven tropical bird lineages exclusively share a novel retrotransposon,
AviRTE, resulting from horizontal transfer (HT). AviRTE subfamilies exhibit 83–99%
nucleotide identity between genomes, and their phylogenetic distribution, paleobiogeography
and invasion times suggest that HTs involved filarial nematodes. The HTs between bird and
nematode genomes took place in two pantropical waves, 425–22 million years ago
(Myr ago) involving the Brugia/Wuchereria lineage and 420–17 Myr ago involving the Loa
lineage. Contrary to the expectation from the mammal-dominated host range of filarial
nematodes, we hypothesize that these major human pathogens may have independently
evolved from bird endoparasites that formerly infected the global breadth of avian
biodiversity.

orizontal transfer (HT) of genetic material has widely
shaped eukaryotic genomes1 and may often coincide with
endosymbiosis2 or parasitism3. A growing body of
evidence suggests that host–parasite relationships are gateways
for the HT of transposable elements (TEs), genomic parasites that
are unable to leave the cell by their own means. Such exchange of
TEs across cellular and organismal boundaries appears to be
particularly common in DNA transposons4–6, whereas it is rather
rare in retrotransposons, which exhibit RNA intermediates7–9.
The only known case of widespread HT of non-retroviral
retrotransposons is that of BovB, a family of retrotransposon-
like elements (RTEs) present in the genomes of various mammals
and lizards/snakes10,11, as well as ticks that parasitize them11.
Further evidence exists for a single HT of CR1 retrotransposons
between distant groups of butterflies12. However, despite the
recent sequencing of many genomes of birds13 and filarial
nematodes14–17, no evidence of HT exists in the evolutionary
history of these species-rich taxa.
Here we report widespread retrotransposon HT between
endoparasitic nematodes and the breadth of avian biodiversity
in the tropics. Surprisingly, these filarial nematodes are extant
endoparasites of humans, and cause lymphatic filariasis and
loiasis, which affect B170 million people14,16. We reconstruct the
timing and biogeography of these prehistoric host–parasite
associations as witnessed by HT events, and thereby propose a
novel scenario for the deep origins of two major human diseases.
Results
A previously undetected transposon from birds and nematodes.
We describe AviRTE, a novel family of long interspersed elements
(LINEs), from bird and nematode genomes. AviRTE belongs
to the RTE superfamily, is distantly related to BovB (Fig. 1),
and even more distantly related to known nematode RTEs
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Instead, AviRTE groups within a diverse
set of RTEs from aquatic or semi-aquatic animals (Fig. 1c,
Supplementary Fig. 1). Many of these related and recognizable
RTE families are from crocodilians and turtles, a pattern that may
reflect the low evolutionary rate of these genomes, which are rich
in ancient repeats18. We initially detected fragments of AviRTE in
restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequences of a Zimmerius
flycatcher (Tyrannidae) genome and in BLASTN searches of
sequences from other Tyrannidae in GenBank (Supplementary
Data 1). These hits are unlikely to be the result of contamination
and instead constitute actual TE insertions, because we were able
to ascertain orthologous genomic loci of AviRTE presence/
absence among multiple species of birds. For example, the
ornithine decarboxylase gene exhibits an intronic AviRTE
insertion (nested within a 13-bp target site duplication) in some
suboscine
birds,
and
an
empty
insertion
site
in
others
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We then examined by BLASTN 48
recently published avian genomes13, a wide range of nematode
genomes14–17, VectorBase’s insect and tick genomes19, and
GenBank’s
nucleotide
and
genome
collection
(including
mammalian genomes). We also survey-sequenced the genomes
of three hummingbirds and two additional suboscine passerines.
In addition to these screenings, we complemented our taxon
sampling by targeted PCR of genomic DNA from various bird
species (Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Data 1).
Horizontal transposon transfer between birds and nematodes.
We detected autonomous copies of AviRTE in seven mono-
phyletic clades of birds and two clades of nematodes, but not their
respective sister groups (Supplementary Data 1), providing the
first evidence for HT in birds and filarial nematodes20. Copy
numbers range from 141 to 8,306 copies in avian and 273 to 859
copies
in
nematode
genomes
(Supplementary
Data
1–2).
Wherever possible, we reconstructed the respective consensus
sequence, revealing a mean overall nucleotide distance of 0.101
substitutions per site between the full-length consensus sequences
derived from bird and nematode genomes (Table 1). The high
sequence similarity is not restricted to the B3.2-kb-long open
reading frame, but is also present across the 50 and 30 untranslated
regions (UTRs) which are B800 bp and B40 bp in size,
respectively. Notably, we also detected evidence for parallel
evolution (Supplementary Fig. 4) of non-autonomous, short
interspersed
elements
(SINEs)
that
are
mobilized
by
the
enzymatic machinery of AviRTE LINEs (Fig. 1b, Supplementary
Data 1). All these SINEs share a bipartite tail consisting
of fragments of the 50 and 30 UTRs of AviRTE (Fig. 1b), yet
have different promoter-bearing heads (see legend of Fig. 1b).
Altogether, the diversity of non-autonomous elements mobilized
by AviRTE is the result of lineage-specific SINE emergences
(Supplementary Fig. 4) and surpasses the known diversity of
SINEs mobilized by the distantly related BovB family21.
The distribution and timing of transposon invasions. We then
studied the phylogenetic distribution and temporal activity of
AviRTE retrotransposition across a dated genome-scale phylo-
geny of birds22. Among the 48 key bird representatives sampled
in this phylogeny, AviRTE is present in 7 lineages that span the
breadth of avian biodiversity (Fig. 2a). The relatively low
sequence divergence between copies (Fig. 2b) and the absence
from outgroup genomes of any sequence with even the slightest
resemblance to AviRTE (Supplementary Data 1) suggest that this
TE family was acquired via HTs long after the Neoaves radiation
at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary22 (Fig. 2a). Given the
evidence for very recent AviRTE retrotransposition in some birds
(for example, hornbill; Fig. 2b), we reanalysed all genomes for the
presence of full-length AviRTE copies and identified zero to six of
such elements per genome (Supplementary Data 1). However,
all of these copies exhibit multiple frameshifts and premature
stop codons (Supplementary Data 3), suggesting that there are
no intact ‘master genes’ of AviRTE in the sampled genome
assemblies.
We then conservatively inferred minimum times of HTs by
applying lineage-specific substitution rates of seven bird species13
(derived from dated branch lengths of the corresponding
phylogeny22) to the upper boundary of the 95% interval of
divergences between copies of AviRTE (see Methods). These
minimum estimates suggest two temporally distinct bursts of
invasions (t-test, P ¼ 0.0006), the first wave 425.0 to 423.6 Myr
ago among hummingbirds, psittacid parrots and hornbills
(Fig. 2a), and the second wave 420.2 to 417.7 Myr ago in
tinamous, suboscine passerines, mesites and trogons. Consistent
with the hypothesis of HT involving nematodes, the two waves of
HT in birds are temporally compatible with the dates inferred
when considering the per-genome divergences of AviRTE copies
in nematode genomes (Fig. 2c) under a neutral substitution rate23
and a generation time of 90 days24. Accordingly, genome
invasions are inferred to have taken place 421.2 Myr ago in
the ancestor of Brugia spp./Wuchereria bancrofti, the causative
agents for lymphatic filariasis, and 416.8 Myr ago in the ancestor
of Loa loa, the causative agent for loiasis. In contrast to the
aforementioned lineage-specific substitution rates of birds, the
nematode HT dates are based on the neutral substitution rate
of a mutation accumulation line from a different nematode,
Pristionchus pacificus23, because such rates are unavailable for
filarial nematodes. Although Weller et al.23 suggested the rate in
Pristionchus to be representative for nematodes, we emphasize
that molecular dating of nematodes is notoriously difficult due to

 differences in life style and a virtually non-existent fossil record25,
and our nematode dates of AviRTE transfers should therefore be
treated with caution. Nevertheless, these nematode HT dates, and
dates derived from the slightly lower neutral substitution rates
of Caenorhabditis species26 both suggest temporally distinct
invasions in the Brugia/Wuchereria lineage and the Loa lineage
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 2). We also note that the
Pristionchus-based minimum dates are temporally compatible
with the split of the Brugia/Wuchereria/Loa lineage from
Acanthocheilonema viteae and other AviRTE-free outgroups
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 1) in an independently dated
nematode phylogeny27. Furthermore, grouping the HT dates
from the Brugia/Wuchereria lineage in the first and L. loa in the
second of the aforementioned waves of HT again suggests
that AviRTE transfers occurred in two distinct bursts (t-test,
P ¼ 0.0002).
The
two
independent
genome
invasions
of
nematodes are surprising given that these two lineages are
closely related within filarial nematodes27,28, but in agreement
with differences between the shapes of the AviRTE divergence
landscapes of the Loa lineage and the Brugia/Wuchereria lineage
(Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 1–2). Finally, the very short
internodes in the AviRTE phylogeny indicate a rapid succession
of HTs in birds and nematodes (Fig. 3c), and there is phylogenetic
evidence that these two bursts of HT are discrete. More precisely,

Figure 1 | A novel family of RTE retrotransposons from birds and nematodes. (a,b) Schematic illustration of structural diversity of (a) autonomous
AviRTE and (b) non-autonomous SINEs mobilized by AviRTE. The SINEs consist of a promoter-bearing head (yellow) and a bipartite tail that is derived from
part of the 50 UTR (blue) and the full 30 UTR (red). Typical RNA polymerase III-transcribed SINEs21 were identified within suboscine passerines, where the
manakin and tyrant flycatcher lineages share ManaSINE1 with tRNA-Glu gene-derived promoters, whereas the antbird lineage exhibits GymnSINE with
5S-rRNA gene-derived promoters. Furthermore, we detected two emergences of potential SINEs with a GC-rich head including a 50-GGCCCCGG-30 motif as
a potential protein-binding site62; one in the hornbill lineage (BuceSINE) and one in the manakin lineage (ManaSINE2). Another peculiar SINE, MeloSINE,
emerged in the budgerigar lineage and exhibits a head derived from the 30 portion of the 28S-rRNA gene, a configuration similar to a novel SINE recently
discovered in mammals63. (c) Phylogeny (RAxML, GTRCAT model, 1,000 bootstrap replicates, bootstrap values Z50% shown) of 370 nucleotide
consensus sequences from superfamily RTE (incl. AviRTE and additional BLASTN hits) suggests that AviRTE (red) is distantly related to BovB (orange)
and more closely related to RTEs from aquatic animals. RTE subfamilies are in green letters for crocodilians and turtles, in light blue letters for other
aquatic vertebrates and in dark blue for aquatic invertebrates. A colour-coded distribution of host taxa across the entire RTE phylogeny is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1.

 AviRTE subfamilies of the second wave form a monophyletic
group nested within the first wave, and the nematode AviRTEs
group with avian AviRTEs of similar minimum invasion dates
(Fig. 3b).
The paleobiogeography of transposon invasions. Although the
AviRTE-bearing lineages of birds span the entirety of the avian
Tree of Life, it is striking that all of these mainly occur in tropical
regions29. They include typical Neotropical avifauna such as
hummingbirds and tinamous, the Madagascan endemic mesites
and members of more widespread tropical bird assemblages
(Fig. 3a,b). It was recently noted that genome-scale dating of birds
yields much lower divergence estimates than other molecular
studies22,30,31, which explains why our inferred avian HT dates

Figure 3 | Pantropical transfer of AviRTE putatively mediated by insect-borne nematodes. (a) Diverse geographic origins of seven representatives of
AviRTE-bearing birds illustrated on a paleogeographic map of the Earth 20 Myr ago. The Mollweide projection map is copyright to Ronald Blakey (used with
permission). (b) Paleobiogeography of the AviRTE phylogeny (see panel c) inferred via statistical dispersal-vicariance (S-DIVA) analysis. We used avifaunal
regions sensu Ericson35. For nodes marked with an asterisk, only those areas which received 433% of the ancestral area distribution on this node are
shown. Strikingly, the two waves of HT events (cf., Fig. 2a) are not only separated temporally (genome invasion dates of the first and second waves of HT
are shown in orange and yellow letters, respectively), but also phylogenetically and biogeographically. (c) The species tree of avian22 and nematode27 hosts
(left) is highly incongruent with the AviRTE phylogeny (right; RAxML, GTRCATmodel, 1,000 bootstrap replicates, bootstrap values Z50% shown) and the
assumption of nine HT events (red asterisks) is required to reconcile the two topologies. The AviRTE phylogeny is rooted to several more or less closely
related outgroups (Supplementary Fig. 4; cf., Fig. 1c); however, only the closest outgroup is shown for comparability of ingroup internode lengths. Green
branches are topologically identical between both trees, implying vertical transmission in species-rich avian lineages. Orange and yellow colours indicate
the Oligocene and Miocene waves of HT events, respectively.
Figure 2 | Two waves of horizontal transfer of AviRTE in birds and nematodes. (a) Phylogenetic distribution of AviRTE mapped on simplified
chronograms of all major avian clades (high-ranking taxon names in grey letters)22 and a subtree of filarial nematodes27. Together with our dates of AviRTE
retrotranspositional activities, this reveals that HTevents (red or purple dashed circles denoting minimum and maximum estimates) occurred long after the
respective early diversifications of Neoaves and filarial nematodes, putatively in one Oligocene wave (orange) and one Miocene wave (yellow). Dates for
AviRTE retrotransposition are either based on a lineage-specific substitution rate of fourfold degenerate sites from the respective bird13 (red colour), or a
neutral substitution rate from the nematode Pristionchus pacificus23 (purple colour). For comparison, HT dates based on the mean neutral substitution rate
from Caenorhabditis spp.26 are also shown (grey dashed circles). Minimum estimates for genome invasions and extinctions are the respective start and end
points of red or purple lines, respectively, and correspond to the 95% interval of AviRTE retrotranspositional activity measured on the scale of pairwise
divergence to consensus (Supplementary Data 2). Also shown are the 99% intervals (light red or light purple lines) as maximum estimates for genome
invasions and extinctions, and the mean of activity (tick mark). (b,c), Landscape plots of AviRTE divergence (red; co-mobilized SINEs in blue) in (b) avian
and (c) nematode genomes illustrate per-genome retrotranspositional activity on a relative time axis. The avian plots are in the same order as the
corresponding taxa in the avian phylogeny of panel a. We note that all nematode AviRTE plots except the one of Loa loa are highly similar in terms of copy
numbers (Supplementary Data 1) and mean divergences (Supplementary Data 2), possibly resulting from a single TE invasion of the germline genome of
the Brugia/Wuchereria ancestor.

 postdate, for example, previous dates for the diversifications
of suboscine passerines32 and psittacid parrots33. However,
irrespective of this discrepancy between absolute dates, our
dense taxon sampling suggests that HTs occurred in the
respective ancestors of Psittacidae (psittacid parrots), Suboscines
(suboscine passerines) and Trochilidae (hummingbirds); and
potentially Bucerotidae (hornbills), Mesitornithidae (mesites),
Tinamidae (tinamous) and Trogonidae (trogons) (Supplementary
Data 1, Fig. 3c). These relative dates predate the onsets of lineage-
specific
diversification
and
thus permit
paleobiogeographic
inferences. We reconstructed the ancestral areas of HTs by
assuming a pantropical distribution of filarial nematodes and
considering existing evidence for the paleobiogeography of
the respective avian clades. Passerines and parrots are more
closely related than previously thought22,34 and diversified in
Australasia33,35 (but see ref. 30). However, suboscine passerines
likely originated in the Neotropics30,32, while the biogeographic
origins of hornbills and trogons are unknown35. We find a
Neotropical origin of AviRTE is likely given the deep branching
of hummingbirds in the AviRTE phylogeny (Fig. 3b), and that the
remainder of the first wave of HT (Fig. 2a) occurred across
all tropical regions except Madagascar (see Methods and
Supplementary
Fig.
5
for
geographically
less
constrained
analyses). In contrast, the second wave of HT (Fig. 2a) includes
Madagascar and took place predominantly in the Neotropics.
Altogether, these results suggest that the paleobiogeography of
AviRTE transfers occurred on a global, pantropical scale. It is
further worth noting that the respective phylogenetic positions
of AviRTEs from Brugia spp./W. bancrofti and L. loa coincide
with
the
aforementioned
temporal
similarities
in
genome
invasion dates. We therefore propose that the ancestor of
Brugia/Wuchereria was involved in the first burst of AviRTE
transfers, while the Loa ancestor was part of the second wave of
HT. In addition, direct comparison of the host species tree with
the AviRTE tree (Fig. 3c) suggests that the differences in
phylogenetic topology are most parsimoniously explained by
nine
HT
events.
However,
the
TE
relationships
within
hummingbirds,
psittacid
parrots
and
suboscine
passerines
appear to be the result of vertical inheritance, respectively,
suggesting that AviRTE shaped the genome evolution of these
species-rich lineages by persistence of retrotranspositional activity
across their diversifications (Supplementary Data 2).
Possible vectors for HT. This study is the first to report HT of
TEs involving the genomes of birds or filarial nematodes. Our
results provide phylogenetic, paleobiogeographic and temporal
evidence that the endoparasitic Brugia/Wuchereria and Loa
lineages each were involved in AviRTE transfer. These nematodes
presently have a near-pantropical distribution and are trans-
mitted by mosquitoes14,27 and deerflies16, respectively. Although
most birds are capable of flight, their dispersal has been
historically rather limited across avifaunal boundaries, especially
in the tropics29,35. We therefore suggest that the two bursts of
pantropical exchanges of AviRTE between five avifaunal regions
were catalysed by the pantropical dispersal potential of filarial
nematodes via their dipteran vectors. While it is conceivable that
AviRTE transfer occurred directly from blood-sucking dipterans
to birds, we find that AviRTE is absent from available dipteran
genomes sequences19 and endoparasitic interaction between
insect-borne nematodes and birds may be a more plausible
platform for such rampant HT. Irrespective of the macroscopic
vectors for HT, however, it remains mysterious as to how
exactly TEs move from one germline genome into another, with
potential candidates being naked RNA or viruses8. Alternatively,
intracellular Wolbachia bacteria are plausible cell-penetrating
vectors8 and infect many filarial nematodes, yet they are absent in
L. loa16. It is further worth noting that successful HT is much
more complex than the mere infiltration of a new host cell by
transposon DNA or retrotransposon RNA. For ancestrally
transferred
AviRTEs
to
be
visible
in
extant
genomes,
a full-length retrotransposon RNA has to colonize a new
germline genome, retrotranspose into a genomic environment
which permits retrotranspositional activity as an intact AviRTE
‘master gene’ and drift to fixation in the host population. It is
therefore likely that the nine events of successful HT and
germline infiltration, reconstructed here from dozens of sampled
animal genomes, is but a small fraction of the actual number
of prehistoric AviRTE exchanges between birds and filarial
nematodes.
Discussion
Our study supports the notion that host–endoparasite interac-
tions are prone to episodic gene exchange, including ‘selfish
genes’ such as AviRTE and other TEs, a process that passes on
genetic material as ‘public goods’36 among unrelated organisms.
We demonstrate that HTs bear witness of long-extinct organismal
interactions between birds and nematodes, although it remains
undetermined whether the interactions leading to bird–nematode
HTs were direct or indirect. The causative agents of lymphatic
filariasis and loiasis infect humans as their adult host14,16 and
many other filarial nematodes are known to only infect mammals,
possibly the result of an ancestral mammalian host range27. The
absence of AviRTE in mammalian genomes despite extensive
bird–nematode HT seems to challenge this view. The two waves
of HT spanned the avian Tree of Life and involved rapid
movement among all five avifaunal regions of the tropics, which
is puzzling given that tropical landbirds have limited propensities
for inter-continental dispersal35. We thus hypothesize that the
Brugia/Wuchereria and Loa lineages were Oligocene/Miocene
parasites of tropical birds and dispersed pantropically through
their dipteran vectors. This may explain the aforementioned
complex paleobiogeography of HTs. Such a scenario requires that
the nematode lineages underwent two subsequent host switches
to humans or their hominid ancestors, likely after AviRTE ceased
retrotranspositional activity in filarial nematodes and thus lost its
potential for HT into hominid genomes. Our indirect evidence
for ancient interactions between birds and the ancestors of the
causative agents of lymphatic filariasis and loiasis raises the
possibility that these widespread human pathogens may have
independently evolved from prehistorically ubiquitous bird
endoparasites.
We
anticipate
that
exploring
the
neglected
biodiversity of extant bird-infecting nematodes will add further
support to this hypothesis.
Methods
In silico screening. We initially detected a putatively RTE-mobilized SINE
(later termed ‘ManaSINE1’) in RAD sequences of a Neotropical Zimmerius
flycatcher37. The SINE sequence was BLASTN38 searched against a budgerigar39
repeat library that we had generated de novo using Repeatmodeler version 1.0.5
(http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html). This led to the discovery of a
nearly full-length consensus sequence of an autonomous RTE which we termed
‘AviRTE’. We then used the budgerigar AviRTE fragment as query for all
subsequent BLASTN screens (cutoff e-value 1e–10) of animal genome assemblies
and nucleotide sequences available in GenBank40, including the genomes of 48
birds13 and 2 additional parrots41,42. Furthermore, our screenings comprised all
insect and tick genomes in VectorBase19, and all filarial nematode genomes in
WormBase15,17. We made sure that, for each of the bird and nematode clades
exhibiting AviRTE, we also sampled the closest relatives as outgroups
(Supplementary Data 1).
In vitro screening. Our taxon sampling was complemented by species
where genome or survey sequences were unavailable (Supplementary Data 1).
We sampled these using a short PCR that amplifies a 126-bp region from the

 conserved 50 UTR of AviRTE. PCR parameters were 40 cycles of 94 �C for 20 s,
53 �C for 45 s and 68 �C for 60 s, followed by final elongation for 120 s at 68 �C.
We used the primers AviRTEint-F/R (50-CCTGAGGACTTCACTGTCACC-30
þ 50-CTTCAAGCCTGTGCAGTGG-30) and interpreted the absence of an
amplicon as an indication of genomic absence of AviRTE (Supplementary Fig. 3).
In the case of Pitta moluccensis, we additionally confirmed the AviRTE presence by
direct Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicon (Supplementary Data 4). Finally, we
were able to amplify the full length of AviRTE in Gymnopithys rufigula with four
overlapping PCR amplicons and subsequent Sanger sequencing of four clones per
amplicon, permitting the generation of a consensus sequence. PCR parameters
were an initial denaturation for 120 s at 94 �C, 35 cycles of 94 �C for 30 s, 50/54 �C
for 30 s and 72 �C for 80 s, followed by final elongation for 300 s at 72 �C.
Purified PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli JM09 cells using the
pGEM-T Vector, followed by PCR amplification via standard M13 primers.
The four primer pairs were AviRTEfull-1F/R (50-TCGTGGGGAAAGAGCTTG-30
þ 50-AATACAATCGGAATGACCTGTC-30), AviRTEfull-2F/R (50-AGGCATCT
CTCAGGAGTTGG-30 þ 50-CATAGAATCCTCTGTGGTCACC-30), AviRTEfull-
3F/R (50-CAAGTGGTGGATCAACCTAGC-30 þ 50-TGATTTAGGGTCTTGGTG
TGG-30), and AviRTEfull-4F/R (50-CCTATTCAATCTAAGGCGACTG-30
þ 50-ATCATCATGGCTTGGCTTC-30).
Whole-genome survey sequencing. We obtained whole-genome survey
sequences via paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (100-bp
reads). The insert size was 300 bp and the final coverage B6 � for the two
suboscines. For the three hummingbirds, the insert sizes ranged from 275 to
450 bp and the final coverage was B0.1 � . Genomic presence of AviRTE was
ascertained by BLASTN screens (cutoff e-value 1e–10). In the case of Oreotrochilus
melanogaster and Zimmerius chrysops, we were able to infer complete and
near-complete AviRTE consensus sequences, respectively.
Consensus sequences. Majority-rule consensus sequences were generated
manually from each AviRTE-bearing host genome assembly. We used standard
procedures43,44 to reconstruct full-length AviRTEs via BLASTN and extension by
re-BLASTN searches to overcome incomplete 50 and 30 ends. For each of these
multiple rounds of BLASTN searches, multiple sequence alignments of BLASTN
hits were constructed using MAFFT45,46 version 7 (E-INS-i, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/
alignment/server/index.html). The resultant consensus sequences span the full
length of AviRTE or co-mobilized SINEs, in rare cases with ‘N’ nucleotides in
ambiguous regions that resisted reconstruction. Full-length consensus sequences of
AviRTEs and co-mobilized SINEs were submitted to Repbase (http://www.girinst.
org/repbase/index.html) (see also Supplementary Data 5).
Phylogenetic analyses. We automatically aligned consensus sequences using
MAFFT and then manually realigned ambiguous regions. For the AviRTE
phylogenies (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4), this was sufficient for generating
nucleotide sequence alignments across the full length of AviRTE (Supplementary
Data 6). On the other hand, the nucleotide sequence alignment for the phylogeny
of all RTE subfamilies present in RepBase, additional GenBank BLASTn hits and
all AviRTE subfamilies (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1) contained many ambiguities
and poorly aligned regions that were removed using Gblocks47 version 0.91b. We
chose standard parameters in the Gblocks webserver (http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/
castresana/Gblocks_server.html) for less stringent selection of alignment positions
(that is, smaller final blocks, gap positions within the final blocks, less strict
flanking positions), yielding a 429-bp high-confidence alignment (Supplementary
Data 7) from the original 23,637 bp. Note that the low number of retained
alignment positions reflects the fact that very distant RTE subfamilies were
included, such as those from angiosperm plants. We excluded sequences that
aligned poorly at the nucleotide level or comprised o200 bp of the filtered
alignment, reducing the total amount of sequences in the RTE superfamily
alignment from 444 to 370. We then conducted all phylogenetic analyses under
maximum likelihood in RAxML48 version 8.1.11 (GTRCAT model, 1,000 bootstrap
inferences) on the CIPRES Science Gateway49 (https://www.phylo.org/portal2/
login!input.action). All phylogenetic trees are available in Newick format
(Supplementary Data 8).
Distance and dating analyses. Pairwise nucleotide distances between AviRTE
consensus sequences (Table 1) were calculated in MEGA6 (ref. 50) under the
Kimura 2-parameter model51 with uniform rates among sites and pairwise deletion
of gaps/missing data.
We then annotated the genomic copies of AviRTE using RepeatMasker version
3.3.0 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html) with a custom repeat
library for each of the AviRTE-bearing genome assemblies. This library contained
the conspecific AviRTE consensus (and, if present, co-mobilized SINE consensus
sequences). In the cases where this sequence was incomplete and contained ‘N’
residues, we instead used the full-length consensus sequence from the most closely
related host genome. We subsequently calculated per-copy distances to consensus
in the calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl script included in the RepeatMasker program
package (Kimura 2-parameter model, excluding CpG sites) and plotted these as
AviRTE divergence landscapes (Fig. 2b,c). Such a divergence distribution reflects
the retrotranspositional activity of AviRTE on a relative time scale per genome.
However, we hypothesize that its high-divergence and low-divergence extrema,
which usually comprise merely o100 bp per divergence bin (Supplementary
Data 2), may in fact arise from genomic outliers in substitution rates, such as
conserved or hypervariable regions. In addition, it is plausible that some of the very
short, high-divergence AviRTE fragments result from spurious hits to random
non-AviRTE sequence during the BLAST-based RepeatMasker annotation.
We therefore considered the boundaries of 95% of the distribution as suitable
conservative estimates for the onset (latest point of genome invasion) and end
(earliest point of extinction) of AviRTE retrotransposition, and the 99% interval
as the maximum duration (Supplementary Data 2). Absolute dates were inferred
by dividing these divergence values by two times the substitution rate (see
Supplementary Data 2 for more details). For the seven birds, we used the fourfold
degenerate site substitution rate derived from the respective bird genome13,52.
Given the lack of substitution rates from filarial nematodes, we considered the
neutral substitution rates of different nematodes, P. pacificus23 and Caenorhabditis
species26, under the assumption of a generation time of 90 days for filarial
nematodes24. Finally, we plotted the inferred AviRTE retrotranspositional activities
on the dated genome-scale tree from the study by Jarvis et al.22,53 (Fig. 2a).
Biogeographic analyses. We used the S-DIVA method54 for biogeographic
reconstruction of the site of HT occurrence under the assumption that extant bird
species usually occur in less than two avifaunal regions35. Thus, analyses were done
in RASP55 using standard parameters and allowing a maximum of two areas per
node. Given the current cosmopolitan distribution of nematodes and their great
age compared with birds56, we assumed a pantropical distribution of the Loa and
Brugia/Wuchereria lineages at the time of HT. For birds, we considered existing
evidence for the paleobiogeography of the respective avian clades to infer the areas
each lineage inhabited at the time of the HT of AviRTE. Because there is no
certainty about the paleobiogeography of each avian lineage, we carried out three
different analyses at various levels of conservatism to infer the main location of HT.
First, we considered the widest possible distribution of each bird lineage at the
time of HT (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In the absence of a detailed avian fossil
record57, this meant that the area of occurrence of most bird lineages would be
equated to their present-day distribution, such as hummingbirds (Trochilidae) in
the Neotropics; psittacid parrots (Psittacidae) in Australasia, Africa, Indomalaya
and the Neotropics; tinamous (Tinamidae) in the Neotropics; mesites
(Mesitornithidae) in Madagascar; and trogons (Trogonidae) in Africa, Indomalaya
and the Neotropics. We made an exception for the paleotropical hornbills
(Bucerotidae) and the pantropical suboscine passerines (Suboscines): both lineages
occur in Australasia, but do so only marginally with one and five species,
respectively, all of which are known to be of fairly recent Indomalayan descent58,59.
Therefore, hornbills were only coded for Africa and Indomalaya, whereas
suboscines were only coded for Africa, Indomalaya and the Neotropics in
this analysis.
Second, we repeated the first analysis but additionally included areas in which
lineages may no longer be present now but are thought to have occurred around
the time of HT based on the fossil record (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Given the poor
avian fossil record57, this only changed the area designation for a single lineage, the
hummingbirds, which are presently distributed only in the New World60 but are
known from early-Oligocene Old World fossils61. Hence, in this analysis we coded
hummingbirds for the Neotropics, Africa and Indomalaya.
Finally, in our main analysis (Fig. 3b) we only included regions thought to be
the areas of occurrence of each respective bird clade roughly at the time of HT
based on the current literature. For lineages in which the area of occurrence at the
time of HT could not be further narrowed down in comparison to present-day
distribution (that is trogons, mesites, tinamous, hornbills and hummingbirds), the
same areas as in the first analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5a) were used. However, for
psittacid parrots (Psittacidae), we used Australasia as the area of occurrence based
on two considerations: (i) there is ample phylogenetic evidence on the Australasian
origin of most deep parrot lineages33,35; and (ii) the internal topology of psittacid
AviRTE subfamilies strongly suggests that the HT occurred into the last common
ancestor of Psittacidae before the divergence of this family into Neotropical,
African and Australasian clades. In the same way, we used the Neotropics as the
area of occurrence for suboscines based on two similar considerations: (i) the
Neotropics are the most likely ancestral area of suboscines35,58; and (ii) the internal
topology of suboscine AviRTE subfamilies, as well as their presence in both major
suboscine clades strongly suggest that the HT occurred into their last common
ancestor before the break-up into Old World and New World suboscines.
