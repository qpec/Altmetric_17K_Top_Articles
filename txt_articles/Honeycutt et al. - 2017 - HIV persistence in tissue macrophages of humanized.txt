Abstract
Despite years of fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV persists in the host and is 
never eradicated. One major barrier to eradication is that multiple different cell types are infected 
that may individually contribute to HIV persistence. Tissue macrophages are critical contributors 
to HIV disease (1–3); however, their specific role in HIV persistence during long-term suppressive 
ART has not been established (4–6). Using humanized myeloid-only mice (MoM), we 
demonstrate that HIV infection of tissue macrophages is rapidly suppressed by ART, as 
determined by a rapid drop in plasma viral load and a dramatic drop in the levels of cell-associated 
viral RNA and DNA. No virus rebound was observed in the plasma of 67% of the ART treated 
animals at seven weeks post-ART interruption, and no replication competent virus was rescued 
from the tissue macrophages obtained from these animals. In contrast, in a subset of animals 
(~33%), a significantly delayed viral rebound was observed that is consistent with the 
establishment of persistent infection in tissue macrophages. These observations represent the first 
direct evidence of HIV persistence in tissue macrophages in vivo.

 Humanized Bone marrow, Liver, Thymus (BLT) mice are reconstituted with human T cells 
and macrophages, both of which are targets for HIV infection in vivo (7–11). Using a model 
reconstituted with HIV infected macrophages and T cells permits assessment of the effect of 
ART on tissue macrophages in the presence of T cells, allowing for the types of interactions 
that occur normally between the two cell types. We infected BLT mice (n=18) with 
macrophage-tropic viruses (HIV-1CH040 or HIV-1CH040-4013env) (7), and monitored plasma 
viremia longitudinally (Fig. 1a, Supplemental Table 1). Thirteen mice, at five weeks post-
infection, were treated once daily with triple combination ART (12–14). Within two weeks 
of ART initiation, we observed a significant decrease in plasma viremia of treated (black 
line) vs untreated mice (dashed gray line) (Fig. 1a, Mann-Whitney test). This corresponded 
to an average 1.3 log reduction in plasma viral RNA after one week of treatment (Fig. 1b). 
We used the change in viral load after ART-initiation to estimate the half-life of productively 
infected cells in BLT mice which was approximately 2.4 days (Fig. 1c), similar to the 
previous estimate of ~2 days in humans (15–17).
To address the effect of ART specifically on infected tissue macrophages, cells were pooled 
from the spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow of individual ART-suppressed or untreated 
BLT mice. A step-wise magnetic cell sorting strategy was used to isolate T cells and 
macrophages (Fig. 1d and Supplemental Figure 1a–c) (7). We were able to detect cell-
associated viral DNA (Fig. 1e) and RNA (Fig. 1f) in the purified T cell fractions of untreated 
mice. In ART-treated mice, the levels of viral DNA and RNA in T cells were significantly 
reduced but readily detectable (Fig. 1e, f). In the purified macrophage (Macs) fraction, we 
were able to readily detect viral DNA and RNA in untreated mice; however, the levels of 
viral DNA and RNA in tissue macrophages from ART-treated mice were below our level of 
detection using a reverse transcriptase real-time PCR assay (Fig. 1e, f). We then conducted 
structured treatment interruption studies to establish the presence of persistently infected 
cells containing replication competent virus (Fig. 1g–h) (12). In all cases, HIV rebound was 
observed by 2 weeks after therapy interruption, a time to rebound that is within the range 
observed for patients (18). Considering the absence of detectable viral RNA and DNA in 
macrophages isolated from ART-suppressed BLT mice, the rapid rebound observed 
ostensibly results from virus present in T cells.
Humanized myeloid only mice (MoM) are generated by transplanting CD34+ hematopoietic 
stem cells into NOD/SCID mice, which are unable to support human T cell development 
(19). MoM are systemically reconstituted with human myeloid and B cells, with an absence 
of human T cells (Supplementary Fig. 2) (7). We have previously shown that MoM are 
susceptible to HIV infection and can efficiently sustain systemic HIV replication over 
several months (7). MoM were utilized to avoid the confounding complications of having an 
excess of T cells present during the evaluation of HIV persistence in macrophages. We 
infected MoM (n=14) with the same macrophage-tropic HIV isolates used for BLT mice in 
Figure 1 (Supplemental Table 1), and monitored infection over time in the absence (n=6) or 
in the presence of ART (n=8) (Supplemental Fig. 3). In all treated MoM, we noted a rapid 
and significant drop in plasma viremia below the limit of detection relative to untreated 
MoM (Fig. 2a, Mann-Whitney test). After one week of ART, this drop corresponded to an 
average 1.8 log reduction in plasma viral RNA levels (Fig. 2b). This reduction in plasma 
viral RNA levels was significantly larger than the reduction observed in BLT mice (Fig. 1b, 
Honeycutt et al.

 Mann-Whitney test, p=0.039). Using change in viral load after ART-initiation we estimated 
the half-life of productively infected macrophages in MoM to be 1.05 days (Fig. 2c), which 
was notably shorter than the estimated half-life of infected T cells in humans and BLT mice 
(Fig. 1c, Mann-Whitney test, p=0.0002) (15–17). Although the half-life of HIV-infected 
macrophages in MoM is shorter than previously estimated for macrophages in SHIV 
infected macaques (20), our results are consistent with the more recent estimate of 1.33 days 
in SIV infected CD4+ T cell depleted macaques on combination ART (21).
We determined the levels of cell-associated viral DNA and RNA in tissue macrophages 
isolated from liver, lung, spleen and bone marrow of untreated or ART-suppressed MoM 
(Supplemental Table 1). Notably, the levels of viral DNA in 18/24 samples from six ART-
treated MoM were below the level of detection (indicated as empty boxes in Fig. 2d, log-
rank test, p=0.0003, p=0.002, p=0.007, p=0.0003, for liver, lung, spleen and bone marrow 
respectively). Using an ultra-sensitive quantitative droplet PCR technique, we demonstrate 
that HIV was integrated into the genome in a portion of the HIV-DNA samples in the ART-
treated group (total of 4 samples analyzed) and that the levels of integrated HIV DNA were 
significantly lower in the treated animals (Supplemental Fig. 3c). Consistent with this 
significant decrease in viral DNA levels, viral RNA levels of 11/15 samples analyzed were 
also below the level of detection in five ART-treated MoM (indicated as empty boxes in Fig. 
2e, log-rank test, p=0.005, p=0.008, p=0.008, p=0.001, for liver, lung, spleen and bone 
marrow respectively). This difference in HIV-DNA and RNA levels between treated and 
untreated mice did not result from a loss of macrophages in the tissues (Fig. 2f, Mann-
Whitney test, all p>0.05). The limited detection of viral DNA and RNA from ART-
suppressed MoM samples is consistent with our data obtained from purified macrophages 
isolated from the tissues of ART-treated BLT mice (Fig. 1e, f).
To determine if HIV persists in infected tissue macrophages and can re-establish persistent 
infection after ART treatment, we discontinued therapy in HIV-infected MoM suppressed on 
ART (Supplemental Table 1). In sharp contrast from what was observed in BLT mice, where 
virus rebound was observed within 2 weeks after therapy discontinuation in all animals 
(n=5), no viral rebound was observed in 6/9 MoM (Fig. 3a). Upon further examination of 
tissue macrophages isolated from MoM in which no HIV rebound was observed, we 
detected no viral DNA or RNA (Table 1). To determine the presence of persistent, 
replication competent virus in tissue macrophages isolated from ART-treated MoM where 
no rebound was observed, we used outgrowth assays similar to those previously used in 
macaques to either quantify virus from infected macrophages (22) or to establish SIV 
eradication after vaccination with an hCMV-based vector (23, 24). For this purpose, cells 
obtained from MoM where rebound was not observed were directly injected into BLT 
humanized mice, as we have previously described (7), or co-cultured with CD8-depleted 
activated allogeneic CD4+ T cells (7, 25–27). Plasma or tissue culture supernatants were 
then monitored for the presence of virus outgrowth; however, no replication competent virus 
was rescued from any of the five MoM analyzed (Table 1). Fewer total numbers of cells 
were isolated from MoM #19, precluding additional outgrowth analysis.
We did observe viral rebound in the plasma from three MoM, seven weeks post-ART 
interruption (Fig. 3b). We confirmed the absence of human T cells in the tissues of

 “Rebound” MoM (Supplemental Fig. 4). We demonstrated the replication competence of the 
rebound virus (from MoM #23) to infect both T cells and macrophages using the outgrowth 
assays performed in the “No rebound” MoM (Supplemental Fig. 5, Supplemental Table 2). 
Additionally, HIV env was sequenced from the plasma of “Rebound” MoM and compared to 
the original virus used for infection. No mutations were found in MoM #22. In MoM #21 
and #23, a point mutation was present resulting in single amino acid changes (I 262 L and I 
107 S, respectively) in the env sequence (GenBank accession numbers KX825880 and 
KX825881). In MoM #23, this mutation was present in ~50% of the bulk sequence. A post-
hoc comparison of mice with or without HIV rebound demonstrated a higher pre-ART viral 
load (Fig. 3c) and larger total pre-ART viral burden (as demonstrated by the area under the 
curve for pre-ART viremia, Fig. 3d) in the “Rebound” mice (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.02). 
No differences were noted in the overall levels of human cells in the blood (Mann-Whitney 
test, p=0.381) or in the number of macrophages in the tissues of mice that did or did not 
rebound (Fig. 3e, p>0.05, Mann-Whitney test). This suggests that under our experimental 
conditions, the lack of rebound observed in 6/9 mice was not simply due to insufficient 
numbers of human tissue macrophages but rather to the absence of productively infected 
cells capable of restarting the infection. We then used these data to model the likely 
persistence of HIV infected macrophages under ART in view of their half-life. Our estimate 
of approximately 1 day for the half-life of infected macrophages indicates that half of all 
infected macrophages are lost every day. Therefore, the number of productively infected 
macrophages under ART would be expected to decay to about 1% after one week and to less 
than 0.00001% of their initial value during the 5 weeks of treatment. The fact that viral 
rebound was observed seven weeks after therapy interruption (and was absent in most 
treated MoM) is consistent with the existence of a small population of infected tissue 
macrophages that persist despite ART, especially when pre-treatment viral burden is 
greatest.
As in any study involving the use of a model system, there are some caveats to this analysis. 
First, the strain of immunodeficient mice used to generate MoM (NOD/SCID mice) develop 
spontaneous thymic lymphomas resulting in a relatively short life-span (9–14 months) (28). 
This limitation prevented us from extending our observations of infected MoM after ART-
interruption for longer periods of time. Therefore, outgrowth assays were used to confirm 
the absence of cells containing replication competent virus. Second, interactions between T 
cells and macrophages may be critical for persistent HIV infection; therefore, our results in 
MoM may underestimate the frequency of viral rebound from macrophages. However, this is 
unlikely to be the case since the disappearance of infected macrophages was noted in both 
ART-treated HIV infected BLT and MoM, suggesting that the presence of human T cells is 
not critical for HIV persistence in human macrophages.
Antiretroviral therapy alone is not sufficient to eradicate HIV from the body. Hill et al. 
indicate that reductions of 2–3 logs in the number of latently infected cells are needed to 
delay rebound for the time reported herein for MoM (29). The delay in rebound observed in 
MoM is greater than that reported for patients initiating ART during the chronic phase of 
infection (30) and from patients with an ultralow HIV reservoir (18). Our results indicate 
that HIV-infected tissue macrophages have a short half-life and that ART alone can 
significantly reduce the levels of infected tissue macrophages, further demonstrating the

 critical contribution of T cells to the viral reservoir. It is possible that under extended ART 
treatment, no viral rebound from macrophages would be observed in MoM. In patients 
where viral rebound occurs after a long period post ART-interruption, the cellular identity 
and location within the tissue of the reservoir is unknown (31, 32). However, the fact that 
viral rebound can be observed in 33% of the infected/suppressed animals suggests that 
macrophages may represent a persistent viral reservoir. Specialized long-lived macrophages, 
such as microglia, are thought to persist in the CNS long-term despite infection (33, 34), and 
could therefore contribute to viral persistence over time. Therefore our results show that 
productively infected tissue macrophages can persist despite effective treatment and re-
establish productive infection after structured treatment interruption.
Online Methods
Generation of humanized mice
Mice were created and monitored as previously described (7, 12, 13). BLT mice were 
generated by implanting human thymus and liver tissue under the kidney capsule of sub-
lethally irradiated NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG, The Jackson Laboratory) 
mice. BLT mice received 3.5×105 autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Humanized 
MoM were created by transplanting sub-lethally irradiated NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice 
(NOD/SCID, The Jackson Laboratory) with approximately 1×106 cord blood or liver-
derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. All animals were irradiated prior to stem cell 
transplantation (BLT mice: 200 rad, MoM: 250 rad). Mice were maintained in a specific 
pathogen-free facility by the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) according to protocols approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
HIV exposures
Stocks of CH040 and the chimeric virus, CH040-4013 env, were prepared and titered as 
previously described (7). Briefly, virus supernatants were prepared via transient transfection 
of 293T cells, and were titered using TZM-bl cells (an indicator cell line). The chimeric 
virus was created by replacing env in CH040 (Accession #jn944905, 6396-8863) with the 
corresponding restriction fragment from 4013 (Accession #jn562796). For the ART-
treatment experiments, humanized MoM and BLT mice were injected intravenously with 3.6 
× 105 TCIU of HIV. Untreated BLT mice in Figure 1A were exposed vaginally to 3.6 × 105 
TCIU of HIV. BLT mice were exposed 8–36 weeks post-humanization (mean 18.3 weeks) 
and MoM were exposed 8–26 weeks post-humanization (mean 16.7 weeks); there was no 
difference in the weeks post-humanization between MoM and BLT mice (Mann-Whitney 
test, p=0.59).
Monitoring of HIV infection in humanized mice
Peripheral blood was collected and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. HIV infection 
was monitored in peripheral blood plasma with a one-step reverse transcriptase real-time 
PCR assay (ABI custom TaqMan Assays-by-design) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (with primers 5′-CATGTTTTCAGCATTATCAGAAGGA-3′ and 5′-
TGCTTGATGTCCCCCCACT-3′; assay sensitivity of 668 RNA copies per mL). At

 necropsy, mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from tissues and analyzed for the 
presence of viral RNA and DNA. For viral outgrowth analysis (Table 1), an in vitro or ex 
vivo outgrowth analysis was performed as done previously in MoM (7). For the in vitro 
analysis, macrophages were plated and allowed to adhere. Within 24 hours of plating, 
approximately one million allogenic, PHA-stimulated feeder cells (CD8-depleted PBMCs 
from healthy human donors) were added to the cultures as targets for viral outgrowth (kindly 
provided by Nancie Archin at UNC-CH). After 10 days, culture supernatants were analyzed 
for the presence of viral RNA by real-time PCR. For the ex vivo outgrowth analysis, cells 
were isolated from the tissues of ART-suppressed MoM and ~4 million cells were injected 
intravenously into naïve BLT mice. The plasma viral load was monitored for 4–8 weeks 
post-injection and tissues harvested from BLT mice were analyzed for the presence of viral 
DNA at necropsy.
Integrated HIV-DNA analysis
High molecular weight (15kb in length or greater) DNA was separated by Pulse-field Gel 
Electrophoresis with the automated BluePippin cassette system [presented by Lada et al at 
the 2016 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI)]. 30μL of total 
DNA and 10μL of loading buffer were pipetted onto one lane of a 0.75% agarose cassette. 
Using a 15kb cutoff high-pass protocol and BluePippin S1 marker, high molecular weight 
DNA was purified and collected in 80μL total volume. Afterwards HIV Gag, HIV 2-LTR 
junction and host cell RPP30 were assayed by ddPCR. Digital droplet PCR analysis was 
performed as previously described (35).
Antiretroviral treatment of mice
For HIV treatment, we used a previously described triple combination of drugs that we have 
shown to be effective at suppressing viral load in T cell-only mice (ToM) and BLT mice (12, 
13, 36). Mice were administered daily intraperitoneal injections of emtricitabine (FTC; 211 
mg/kg), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF; 205 mg/kg) and raltegravir (RAL; 56 mg/kg) 
for three to eleven weeks as indicated on individual graphs. HIV infection was monitored 
throughout ART-treatment via plasma viral load analysis as described above.
Tissue harvesting of humanized mice
To minimize the numbers of blood-derived monocytes in tissues harvested from HIV-
infected MoM and BLT mice, at necropsy animals were transcardially perfused with ~20 ml 
of room temperature PBS. MNCs were isolated from the bone marrow, spleen, lung, and 
liver as previously described. Tissues were minced and/or digested and filtered through a 70 
μm strainer. Liver, lung and brain samples were purified by Percoll density centrifugation. 
Red blood cells were lysed as needed (namely for the spleen, bone marrow and liver tissues). 
MNCs were washed and counted via trypan blue exclusion.
Macrophage and T cell sorting
Total MNCs were isolated from the spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow of HIV-infected 
BLT mice. Mouse cells were depleted using the EasySep Mouse Human Chimera Isolation 
kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Cat. 19849) followed by positive magnetic selection for human

 CD3+ T cells (Miltenyi, CD3 MicroBeads, Cat. 130-050-101). Next, negative magnetic 
selection for human monocytes and macrophages (Miltenyi, Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit, 
Cat. 130-096-537) was performed on the non-CD3 cell population to yield a purified 
macrophage population (<1% T cell contamination). Cell purity was verified using flow 
cytometric staining.
Flow cytometric analysis of humanized mice
All flow antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. The antibody panel used to 
analyze cells isolated from humanized mice included antibodies directed against hCD45 
(APC, Cat. 555485 or APC-Cy7, Cat. 557833), hCD3 (FITC, Cat. 555339), hCD19 (PE-
Cy7, Cat. 557835), hCD33 (PE, Cat. 340679), hCD14 (FITC, Cat. 555397), hCD16 (PE-
Cy7, Cat. 557744), hCCR5 (APC, Cat. 550856) and hCD11b (PE, Cat. 555388). Live cells 
were distinguished by their forward and side scatter profiles. Flow cytometry data was 
collected on a BD FACSCanto and analyzed with BD FACSDiva software (v.6.1.3).
Immunohistochemical analysis
Tissues for IHC were harvested from MoM and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hour at 
4°C, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm sections and mounted onto poly-L-lysine coated 
glass slides. Following paraffin removal, antigen retrieval (DIVA Decloaker, Biocare 
Medical, Cat. DV2004.) and blocking of non-specific Ig-binding sites (Background Sniper, 
Biocare Medical), tissue sections were stained with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and 
developed with a biotin-free horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-polymer system (MACH3 
Mouse HRP-Polymer Detection, Biocare Medical). All tissue sections were then 
counterstained with hematoxylin. Primary antibodies directed against CD45 LCA 
(2B11&PD7/26, Dako), CD3 (SP7, Thermo Scientific), CD20 (L26, Biocare Medical) and 
CD68 (KP1, Dako) were used to identify human cells in the spleen, liver and lung. For 
comparison, tissue sections were stained with mouse IgG1k or IgG2a isotype controls. Light 
microscopy images were taken with a Nikon H550S microscope at 40×.
Sequencing of HIV-1 in MoM plasma
For sequence analysis of HIV-1 envelope, viral RNA was isolated from plasma from infected 
MoM using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Viral cDNA was generated using 
Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and amplified by nested PCR using the 
Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche). The amplified region was a 1.2 kb region of 
HIV env (CH040 6426-7702; CH040-4013env 6426-7702). The primers used for CH040 
env amplification include env outer forward primer 
(CACCACTCTATTTTGTGCATCAGATG), env outer reverse primer 
(GCCCATAGTGCTTCCTGCTGC), env inner forward primer 
(CACACATGCCTGTGTACCCACAGAC) and env inner reverse primer 
(CTCTTCTCTTTGCCTTGGTAGGTGC). The primers used for CH040-4013env env 
amplification include env outer forward primer (CACCACTCTATTTTGTGCATCAGATG), 
env outer reverse primer (GCCCATAGTGCTTCCTGCTGC), env inner forward primer 
(CACACATGCCTGTGTACCCACAGAC) and env inner reverse primer 
(CTCTTCTCTTTGCCTTGGTGGGTGC). Amplified DNA was sequenced and aligned to 
HIV-1 CH040 or CH040-4013 env to determine if nucleotide changes had occurred.

 FinchTV (Geospiza Inc., Seattle, WA) was used for the sequence analysis of the 
chromatograms and ClustalW (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/) was used to compare 
the MoM envelope sequences to the reference CH040 or CH040-4013env sequences.
Experimental groups
The total number of experiments performed was determined based on total number of tissue 
cohorts (representing different human donors) and viral exposures utilized in each figure. 
For Figure 1, 12 human donors and 8 exposure groups are represented. For Figure 2, 13 
human donors and 13 exposure groups are represented. For Figure 3, 5 human donors and 5 
exposure groups are represented.
Statistical analyses
All data was graphed using GraphPad Prism (version 5.04). The statistical tests used are 
indicated in the figure legends and/or text for each comparison performed. All statistical 
tests were exact. A mixed-effects approach using Monolix (Lixoft, France), allowing for 
censored values, was utilized to model the decay slope for viremia after ART initiation, 
leading to an estimate for the half-life of productively infected cells in MoM and BLT mice. 
For half-life analyses, we assumed a near-perfect efficacy of the ART regimen to prevent 
new infections (>99%), yielding upper bound estimates for the half-lives. For comparisons 
in Fig. 2d/2e & Supplemental Fig. 3c, a log-rank test was utilized, thus accounting for the 
variation in the lower limit of detection between samples similar to what has been done for 
other assays (37–39). For all Mann-Whitney comparisons, a two-tailed test was used. For all 
comparisons, a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. No adjustment was 
made for multiple hypothesis testing. In all figures, the following representations were used 
to indicate the p-values: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001. No statistical 
methods were used to pre-determine sample size. No randomization was used. Blinding of 
the statisticians (RMM and YC) was used when accessing and modeling the infected cell 
half-life post-ART initiation (Fig. 1c, 2c). Investigators were given viral loads for lettered 
groups of mice (A, B, C), but were not privy to the identity of the groups (MoM, ToM or 
BLT mice) until all half-lives were calculated. No blinding was used for comparisons in the 
vDNA and vRNA levels of treated or untreated MoM (Fig. 2d, 2e).
Data availability
The sequencing data demonstrating point mutations in env for MoM #21 and MoM #23 
were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KX825880 & KX825881).

 Figure 1. Viral suppression, persistence and structured ART-interruption induced rebound in 
BLT mice
a) Plasma viral load (VL) was monitored over time in HIV-infected ART-treated (n=13, solid 
black line) and untreated (n=5, dashed gray line) BLT mice. Each point represents the mean 
± s.e.m. The time of exposure to ART for the treated animals is indicated with a shaded gray 
box. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the plasma VL of ART-treated and 
untreated mice at one and two weeks post-ART initiation (p=0.0049 and p=0.0080, 
respectively). b) The reduction in log (base 10) plasma VL one week after ART-initiation 
was calculated for each treated BLT mouse (n=13). c) The half-life of productively infected 
cells was estimated from the change in viral load during ART (n=13). d) Schematic for the 
magnetic sorting and purification of human T cells and macrophages from the tissues 
obtained from infected animals. Human T cells (CD3+) and non-T cells were separated from 
pooled tissue cells of individual ART-suppressed BLT mice (n=4). Macrophages (Macs) 
were then isolated from the non-T cell fraction. Analysis of (e) HIV-DNA and (f) HIV-RNA 
levels were performed by real time PCR using purified cells isolated from ART-suppressed 
(n=4) and untreated (n=3) BLT mice. HIV-DNA/RNA levels are normalized and reported per 
100,000 human cells. Samples with values below the level of detection are indicated by open 
diamonds in e & f and are shown at the average lower limit of detection. g) Time to viral

 used to compare MoM and BLT mice in b & c. Cell-associated (d) HIV-DNA and (e) HIV-
RNA levels were measured in the liver, lung, spleen and bone marrow of ART-treated (n=6, 
gray squares) and untreated (n=8, black squares) MoM. Undetectable samples are indicated 
by an empty black box shown at the limit of detection for that sample (dependent on the 
number of cells available for analysis). Viral DNA and RNA levels were normalized per 
100,000 human macrophages and compared between treated and untreated mice. A log-rank 
test was used to account for censoring due to the limits of detection in d & e. f) There was 
no difference in the total numbers of human macrophages present in the tissues of ART-
treated or untreated MoM (all p>0.05, Mann-Whitney test). In b–f, horizontal lines represent

Table 1
Absence of replication competent virus in tissues of MoM without plasma viral rebound after ART interruption
HIV-DNA/RNA analysis and in vivo or in vitro viral outgrowth assays were performed with cells isolated from ART-treated MoM in which plasma viral 
rebound was not observed. The tissues analyzed for all mice included the spleen, liver, lung, brain and bone marrow. In MoM #18–20, the gastrointestinal 
and female reproductive tracts were also analyzed for presence of HIV-DNA. For the viral outgrowth assay, cells isolated from the tissues of MoM were 
1) cultured with activated allogeneic CD4+ T cells and the culture supernatants tested for presence of cell-free HIV-RNA by real time PCR analysis (in 
vitro method) or 2) injected into BLT mice and the plasma VL monitored over time to determine the presence or absence of HIV infection in recipient 
mice (in vivo method). The total number of cells utilized for outgrowth analysis is indicated (# cells). LOD: limit of detection. nd: not determined.
