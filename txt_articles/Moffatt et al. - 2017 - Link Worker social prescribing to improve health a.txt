Objectives To describe the experiences of patients with 
long-term conditions who are referred to and engage with a 
Link Worker social prescribing programme and identify the 
impact of the Link Worker programme on health and well-
being.
Design Qualitative study using semistructured interviews 
with thematic analysis of the data.
Intervention Link Worker social prescribing programme 
comprising personalised support to identify meaningful 
health and wellness goals, ongoing support to achieve 
agreed objectives and linkage into appropriate community 
services.
Setting Inner-city area in West Newcastle upon Tyne, UK 
(population n=132 000) ranked 40th most socioeconomically 
deprived in England, served by 17 general practices.
Participants Thirty adults with long-term conditions, 14 
female, 16 male aged 40–74 years, mean age 62 years, 24 
white British, 1 white Irish, 5 from black and minority ethnic 
communities.
Results Most participants experienced multimorbidity 
combined with mental health problems, low self-confidence 
and social isolation. All were adversely affected physically, 
emotionally and socially by their health problems. The 
intervention engendered feelings of control and self-
confidence, reduced social isolation and had a positive 
impact on health-related behaviours including weight loss, 
healthier eating and increased physical activity. Management 
of long-term conditions and mental health in the face of 
multimorbidity improved and participants reported greater 
resilience and more effective problem-solving strategies.
Conclusions Findings suggest that tackling complex and 
long-term health problems requires an extensive holistic 
approach not possible in routine primary care. This model 
of social prescribing, which takes into account physical 
and mental health, and social and economic issues, was 
successful for patients who engaged with the service. Future 
research on a larger scale is required to assess when and 
for whom social prescribing is clinically effective and cost-
effective.
Background
Social prescribing enables healthcare prac-
titioners to refer patients to a range of 
non-clinical services.1 Primarily, but not 
solely, directed at people with long-term 
conditions, social prescribing harnesses assets 
within the voluntary and community sectors 
to improve and encourage self-care and facil-
itate health-creating communities.2–4 There is 
increasing interest in social prescribing as a 
means of addressing complex health, psycho-
logical and social issues presented in primary

Strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This is the first UK study to provide detailed insight 
into the impact of a Link Worker social prescribing 
programme on health and well-being among adults 
with long-term conditions living in an area of high 
socioeconomic deprivation.
 
► Our interview data showed that the Link Worker 
social prescribing programme engendered feelings 
of control and self-confidence, reduced social 
isolation and led to positive physical and behavioural 
changes such as weight loss, increased physical 
activity, improved mental health and long-term 
condition management as well as greater resilience 
and effective coping strategies to manage relapses.
 
► Key elements of the Link Worker social prescribing 
model are that it: addresses the coexistence 
of multimorbidity, mental health problems and 
social isolation; is long-term in nature; and, where 
applicable, tackles related socioeconomic issues.
 
► A strength of this work was the depth and 
consistency of participant accounts regarding the 
impact of the programme. Limitations were that 
we did not capture the experiences of patients with 
long-term conditions who refuse a referral or who 
drop out of the programme early, nor were we able 
to collect information on the frequency with which 
participants engaged in activities they were referred 
to.
 
► Our study adds to the emerging evidence base on 
Link Worker social prescribing by demonstrating 
improvements in health-related behaviours and 
long-term condition management.

care, as well as its potential to reduce health inequali-
ties.5 A recent review of social prescribing indicates that, 
despite a small and largely inconclusive evidence base, 
there is the potential for credible psychosocial benefits 
to be incurred by patients with mental health problems, 
and for health and well-being improvements to be seen in 
people with long-term conditions.6 While less attention 
has been paid to the impact of social prescribing on phys-
ical health and resource use,4 improvements in physical 
activity,7 reductions in hospital resource use8 and General 
Practitioner (GP) attendance9 have been attributed to 
social prescribing, although longer-term studies with 
larger sample sizes are required for more definitive 
evidence.4
As yet there is no agreed definition of social prescribing,2 
although there is broad consensus that it helps patients 
to access non-clinical sources of support, predominantly 
in the community sector,3 and is a means to address the 
well documented social and economic factors that accom-
pany long-term illness beyond the healthcare setting.4 In 
the UK, social prescribing has been taking place on a small 
scale for a number of years and there are several operating 
models.10 These models vary in two ways; the actual activities 
or services offered and the level of support given to patients 
following referral. Recognising that patients who are simply 
given information about a service will not necessarily take 
it up, most schemes involve a ‘facilitator’ coupled with 
personal support,11 although the level of ongoing support 
offered varies considerably. Services into which patients are 
referred vary, and can include activities that involve physical 
activity such as gyms, walking groups, gardening or dance 
clubs; weight management and healthy eating activities, 
such as cooking clubs. Addressing wider economic and 
social issues can involve referral into services which address 
welfare, debt, housing and employment issues. Groups, such 
as those targeted at people with specific long-term condi-
tions, for example diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, may also be accessed via social prescription. Our 
definition concurs with that of the Social Prescribing 
Network of Ireland and Great Britain, ‘enabling healthcare 
professionals to refer patients to a link worker, to co-design 
a non-clinical social prescription to improve their health 
and well-being’ and use services provided by the voluntary 
and community sector. (p19)2
Ways to Wellness12 is one of the first UK organisations to 
deliver social prescribing on a large and prolonged scale, 
funded for 7 years through a social impact bond model, 
with an overall target of 11 000 users over this period. 
Based in west Newcastle upon Tyne, an area with some of 
the most socioeconomically deprived wards in England, 
Ways to Wellness covers 17 general practices. Referral 
criteria are men and women aged 40–74 years with one 
or more of the following long-term conditions: diabetes 
(types 1 and 2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
asthma, coronary heart disease, heart failure, epilepsy, 
osteoporosis, with or without anxiety or depression. Ways 
to Wellness is delivered by four voluntary sector organi-
sations.
Following extensive consultation with patients and 
healthcare professionals over an 8-year period,13 Ways 
to Wellness provides a ‘hub’ model of social prescribing 
in which a Link Worker trained in behaviour change 
methods offers a holistic and personalised service. 
Following referral from a primary care practitioner (GP, 
practice nurse, healthcare assistant), meaningful health 
and wellness goals are jointly identified and service users 
are connected, when desired, to community and volun-
tary groups and resources. The service comprises: (A) 
individual assessment, motivational interviewing and 
action planning; (B) completion of an initial ‘Well-being 
Star’ assessment and subsequent Well-being Star assess-
ments every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the 
patient’s involvement; (C) help to access community 
services (eg, welfare rights advice, walking groups, phys-
ical activity classes, arts groups, continuing education); 
(D) promotion of volunteering opportunities, and; (E) 
promotion of improved self-care and sustained behaviour 
change related to healthier lifestyle choices. Thus, the 
programme is highly individualised with patient engage-
ment varying in terms of intensity, duration, personalised 
goal-setting and onward referral. Patients can remain 
with the programme for up to 2 years, but with Link 
Worker discretion beyond 2 years if required; frequency 
of contact with the Link Worker is mutually agreed, varies 
between and within patients depending on current need 
and circumstances, and can be face to face, via telephone, 
email and/or text message. Data for this study were 
collected in the first 14 months of the Link Worker social 
prescribing programme implementation.
This qualitative study aimed to capture the experiences 
of patients engaged with Ways to Wellness in its first 14 
months of operation and to identify the impact of the 
Link Worker social prescribing programme on health 
and well-being.

setting
This study was set in an inner-city area of high socioeco-
nomic deprivation in the west of Newcastle upon Tyne 
(population n=132 000), ranked among the 40 most 
deprived in England according to the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation.14 Eighteen per cent of residents have long-
term conditions and receive sickness and disability-related 
benefits, which is higher than the national average.15
recruitment and sampling
The four Ways to Wellness provider organisations acted as 
gatekeepers and approached service users on our behalf, 
explaining the study and issuing a participant information 
sheet. Those who agreed for their details to be passed on 
to the researcher were contacted by telephone to ascer-
tain willingness to participate, and, if willing, an interview 
was arranged. We set out to obtain a maximum variation 
sample across the four provider organisations based on 
the following criteria: age, gender, long-term condition,

marital status, employment status, socioeconomic status 
and level of engagement with Ways to Wellness (intensive 
to non-intensive). For the purposes of sampling, long-
term condition was ascertained by the Link Worker via 
the referral form, and had therefore been diagnosed by 
a GP or other healthcare professional. The recruitment 
period was January to June 2016. Ways to Wellness was 
operational from April 2015, and in the 14 months since 
it started, 864 women and 739 men, average age 59 years, 
were referred from primary care and attended at least 
one Link Worker session.
data collection
We undertook one semistructured interview with each 
participant between January and June 2016 while they 
were engaged with Ways to Wellness (length of engage-
ment ranged from 4 months to 14 months). A topic guide 
was developed covering: referral procedures; level and 
type of engagement with Ways to Wellness; goal-setting; 
linkage to other services; long-term condition manage-
ment; changes resulting from involvement with Ways to 
Wellness; and views of the service. Interviews took place 
in participants’ homes or an alternative venue of their 
choosing (often where they attended their Ways to Well-
ness appointment). Interviews were carried out by two 
researchers (MS and SL). Following consent procedures, 
demographic details were collected. Interviews continued 
until consistencies were identified across participants and 
data.16
Transcription, data management and analysis
Interviews lasted between 8 min and 1 hour 27 min 
(average 41 min), were digitally recorded and transcribed 
verbatim. Field notes were made immediately after each 
interview and shared among the team. Transcripts were 
anonymised and checked against recordings for accu-
racy. Thematic analysis was used17 with data management 
supported by NVivo V.10 software.18 Following close 
reading of the transcripts, a coding scheme was devel-
oped which contained a priori themes based on the 
topic guide as well as further themes which emerged 
from the data. The scheme captured data relating to: 
referral, multimorbidity, experiences of Ways to Wellness 
service delivery and onward referral, relationship with the 
Link Worker, impact of Ways to Wellness and barriers to 
service engagement. The coding framework was applied 
to an initial randomly selected five interviews, which were 
double-coded by MS and SL. Following this, the coding 
frame was reviewed by all team members, modifications 
agreed and made before being applied to all interviews. 
Line-by-line coding and constant comparison were used 
to code the entire data set;19 20deviant case analysis, where 
we sought out opinions which modified or contradicted 
the analysis, was used to enhance validity.21
resulTs
The impact of Ways to Wellness is described by our 
detailed analysis of the following three themes: negative 
impact of long-term conditions and multimorbidity; Link 
Worker roles; and positive impact of the programme.
Participant characteristics
As shown in table 1, 30 adults, 14 women and 16 men, 
aged 40–74 years (mean age 62 years) took part. Thirteen 
participants were over state pension age; 4 of the 17 partic-
ipants of working age were in employment. Occupational 
social class22 based on current or previous main employ-
ment indicates that the sample included individuals from 
across the social class spectrum, excepting social class 1; 
social classes 2–4 accounted for two-thirds of the sample 
and the remaining third were from social classes 5–8. Five 
participants were from black and minority ethnic commu-
nities, 1 identified as white Irish and the remaining 24 
were white British. Multimorbidity was a prominent 
feature of the sample. Based on self-reported health 
conditions, only one participant (15) had a single long-
term condition. Most participants had more than one 
‘referral’ long-term condition, had other health prob-
lems and associated mental health issues, low confidence 
and social isolation. With the exception of the diagnosed 
long-term conditions that triggered a referral to Ways to 
Wellness (ie, diabetes (types 1 and 2), chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, asthma, coronary heart disease, 
heart failure, epilepsy, osteoporosis) other physical and 
mental health problems were self-reported at interview. 
No further assessment of physical or mental health was 
made during the study.
At the time of interview, participants had been receiving 
the social prescribing programme for between 4 months 
and 14 months. Table 1 shows that the number of services 
that each participant reported being linked into ranged 
from 0 to 5; the average number was 1.7. However, seven 
participants (11, 12, 13, 16, 24, 25, 30) obtained welfare 
benefits advice from their Link Workers, rather than being 
linked into welfare rights services, demonstrating that 
some Link Workers drew on their specialist knowledge 
to assist their client rather than make a referral. Table 2 
shows that 54 referrals to community, voluntary and NHS 
services were made for the 30 participants. These are 
categorised as follows: long-term condition management; 
mental health; physical activity; weight management 
and healthy eating; NHS services (eg, physiotherapy), 
welfare rights advice (eg, benefits advice, aids and adapta-
tions), learning/employment assistance (eg, curriculum 
vitae (CV) writing), voluntary work, arts-based activities 
(eg, choir, art therapy), community-based activities (eg, 
gardening, fishing, crafts). Services promoting physical 
activity were the most common linkage.
Impact of long-term conditions and multimorbidity
All participants had been deeply affected, physically, 
emotionally and socially by their health problems. Phys-
ical effects included pain, sleep problems, side effects of 
medication, continence issues and significant functional 
limitations. With increasing age, existing conditions wors-
ened and multimorbidity increased:

'I've got COPD, high blood pressure, diabetic …  a prolapsed 
disc and …  an operation on it that didn't work, so I'm 
in constant pain with my back. Just generally not fit, not 
well …  stent put in because I had kidney stones. They were 
supposed to take it out …  but because I had a temperature 
they didn't take it out. They left it in, but I'm having nothing 
but trouble with it, water infections, feeling as if I want to 
go to the toilet all the time and when I do go I don't pass 
anything. It's like dying for a wee all the time… It's got me 
really down.' (P1, male, 70–74 years)
Some of those experiencing depression reported that 
this had been with them for many years, but most 
accounts of depression and/or anxiety were attributed 
to their long-term condition(s) and the difficulties of 
carrying out a ‘normal’ life. Wider participation within 
family and community networks was affected, as well 
as basic activities of daily living such as shopping or 
housework. Social isolation was common among many 
of the participants, but for those of working age, 
unemployment, lowered incomes and reliance on sick-
ness welfare benefits were commonplace. The overall 
picture was of lives seriously blighted by long-term 
health problems:
'I want to get back to work. I was used to doing things and it 
is really hard not being able to do all the things I used to do, 
yes, and I was depressed at the time as well …  it looks like 
a long road to get back to being healthy again; and I needed 
all the help I could get …  I have got asthma and I have 
got diabetes and high blood pressure. And since I have had 
the treatment for cancer …  I was fine after the operation 
but it was the radiotherapy that really knocked me out …  I 
mean they do warn you that it affects your energy – but my 
energy levels just plummeted and I wasn’t able to do hardly 
anything.' (P8, female, 55–59 years)
link Worker roles
Connecting with service users
Link Workers operated an accessible, flexible service 
between 9:00 and 17:00, Monday to Friday. Following 
primary care referral, Link Workers contacted service 
users by telephone to arrange an initial appointment, 
which could be held at GP practices, community 
centres, cafés, or infrequently, participants’ homes. In 
general, contact with Link Workers was more frequent 
during the initial stages, reducing as the relationship 
developed and the service user became more inde-
pendent; however, contact also decreased or increased 
with current need. Face-to-face contact was also supple-
mented by telephone, email or text:
'[Link Worker] says, ‘I’m there, basically, any time,’ 
obviously within working hours, but she says, ‘Just phone 
me up if you need me, and any questions or anything.’ So 
basically I can see her as often as I want or as little as I want, 
but she likes me to keep her informed of anything happening, 
so she knows.' (P11, male, 45–49 years)

Participants appreciated the flexibility and ‘open door’ 
nature of Ways to Wellness, although this could be limited 
for those who were working. Of particular value was the 
potential to be engaged with the service for up to 2 years. 
Due to the long-term and complex nature of conditions 
which often fluctuated, participants recognised that a 
shorter-term approach would be inadequate, particularly 
when accounting for wider life events such as job loss or 
bereavement:
'Well, I think you can dip in and dip out. It’s the kind 
of thing if you need them, you phone them and they’ll get 
straight back to you. They’re there, I know they’re there …  if 
something happens to me now.' (P13, male, 60–64 years)

Participants consistently reported feeling at ease and 
relaxed with their Link Worker, which enabled them to 
develop an open and trusting relationship. The Link 
Workers’ person-centred and non-judgemental approach 
facilitated trust, feelings of control and a readiness to 
reflect on current circumstances and implement positive 
changes. Service users felt listened to and valued:
'… [Link Worker] really helped me along …  they’re not 
judgemental …  and they were so easy going and they were 
just lovely.' (P17, female, 50–54 years)
'She [Link Worker] just brought things up …  we’d have a 
discussion …  we just started talking and that’s when I just 
came out with different things …  and she gave the feeling 
that you could open up to her …  where some people, you are 
guarded because you don’t want them to know too much of 
your private life.' (P9, male, 55–59 years)
A central part of the Link Worker role was to facilitate 
engagement with other services, as shown in table 2. The 
level and type of support offered to facilitate engage-
ment varied, and was balanced against service users’ 
need and readiness to engage with other services. Partic-
ipants appreciated not feeling under undue pressure 
and recounted how the right amount of encouragement 
supported them to engage and make changes at their own 
pace. Narratives indicated service users experienced a 
considerable degree of control over their onward referral 
which helped them feel that when they did engage with 
other services, they were ready to do so:
'There’s no pressure or anything. If you can’t do it, they 
don’t ask why, they just say, ‘Oh, we’ll try to sort something 
else out for you,’ She said, ‘Well, it needs to come from you.’ 
… if it was, like, a sort of forced thing I think I would have 
problems going [to self-help organisation] … I hate it if I’m 
made to go.' (P11, male, 45–49 years)
'I certainly felt better from having spoken to her [Link 
Worker], and for her inspiring me to … kick me along and 
say, ‘Yes, you can do that, you can do that.’ And when I 
described the [negative] feelings I had she turned them 
around to be something else that made me feel loads better.' 
(P5, female, 65–69 years)
The level of support that some service users required in 
order to engage with services, particularly those involving 
physical activity, appeared to be considerable. Link 
workers paced the level of support they offered, particu-
larly in the initial stages:
'I just expected the Link Worker to introduce me to the gym, 
and that would have been it. And I think, if it had just 
been [that] I would have turned round, and I would have 
gone the opposite direction. But because of the way it was 
so gradually and really professionally linked in to different 
things, I just felt as though I’d floated into it, rather than 
getting shoved from behind. I just felt as though I was 
gradually moved into it.' (P2, female, 70–74 years)
Building self-confidence, self-reliance and indepen-
dence was another facet of the Link Workers’ approach, 
managed through ongoing support and persistence in 
finding the right motivational tools for the individual, 
while conveying the need for personal responsibility and

resilience. This enabled service users to make changes to 
their lives, engage with other organisations and manage 
their long-term conditions:
'I mean, she’s just someone who can make you do things…
Not as in a bad way, she sort of, like, empowers you, for 
want of a better word, to do it, you know what I mean? She 
gives you, ‘… give it a go,’ and she’ll explain… and if you 
don’t go she doesn’t get disappointed or anything like that, 
she just says, ‘Oh, right, well, we’ll sort something else out 
for you.”… I think the only person that can help is myself, 
really. I think it’s 99% me and the 1% of help I get from the 
rest of the people, but … they can only like, give you advice 
and encouragement, the rest has got to be yourself.' (P11, 
male, 45–49 years)
The holistic service offered by the Link Workers was 
contrasted favourably with what was available or possible 
through the GP or with previous attempts by other health 
professionals to deal with complex health issues:
'I couldn’t go to my doctors and ask them, I couldn’t phone 
the nurse and ask the nurse.' (P13, male, 60–64 years)
'It hasn't worked miracles, but it's nice that she's there 
and sometimes you don't bother your GP or whatever, you 
know. It's a brilliant service, I think.' (P26, male, 70–
74 years)
'At the very beginning, we agreed that she’d work around 
me, not me around her, to work on the foods that I thought 
were suitable for me … I met up with dieticians before … I 
felt they were dictating the food I should have, not the food 
I wanted to have. So that's what surprised me about Ways 
to Wellness, they're working around me … it’s different. You 
talk about it. You're relaxed … You're in charge of it.' (P6, 
male, 65–69 years)
Positive impact of the link Worker social prescribing 
programme
Health-related behaviours
Many participants attended physical activity classes specif-
ically tailored to their health needs, helping them to 
incrementally build confidence and strength to improve 
their physical health. Some participants noted that as a 
result of the Ways to Wellness programme, their level of 
fitness had improved:
'I really enjoyed it … When I first started off, I was doing 
five min on the cycling machine and … I had that up to 
20 min … I was up to 15 min on [the cross trainer] and 
I was pulling weights … they asked us all these relevant 
questions because of my medical history so I hadn’t to do too 
much for my heart … I just feel a hell of a lot fitter.' (P28, 
male, 70–74 years)
Participants who received healthy eating advice and 
cooking skills recounted in some detail how they had 
reduced their intake of unhealthy food and how they 
were equipped with the practical skills to incorporate 
healthier foods into their diet:
Certainly the [name of course], because that was a six week 
course…The first session was salad and pizza, then we did 
stir fry, soup last week. Next week it’s going to be fish, then I 
think it’s desserts on the sixth week. Brilliant. It’s not boring, 
but I just can’t believe how good I’ve found it. It’s not just for 
cooking. … it’s what you should be eating, it’s the portion 
size which is so important.' (P14, male, 60–64 years)
'I was asked to do a food diary. You see straightaway that 
what you’re doing is wrong. I think that was one of the biggest 
things why I lost quite a bit of weight, to be honest … you 
don’t realise at the time, but it was nothing for me to eat eight 
slices of bread a day. That’s where all the badness is. Now, I 
only have pitta bread, really, or a small brown sliced bread. 
That was a big help, with the directions pointing to the food 
… it’s smaller portions and more variety as well … now, I 
eat more fruit in the mornings and in the afternoons, and I 
don’t pick as much.' (P29, male, aged 60–64 years)
Participants described how these diet and physical activity 
lifestyle changes improved their physical health. Many 
noted weight reduction and increased energy and fitness 
that enabled them to break a cycle of illness and restart 
activities, such as walking, shopping and gardening, which 
previously they felt unable to manage:
'At one time, when I went up [a hill]… I used to stop … 
but now I can walk directly up…  I can carry my shopping 
bags now … I’d get up and dance … [without feeling] I 
needed to sit down because I was out of breath. (P2, female, 
70–74 years)
Mental health
Social isolation, low mood, anxiety and depression were 
commonly experienced. For some, this was related 
primarily to physical health, but for others, this was 
compounded by life events such as bereavement. Offering 
opportunities for activities, which allowed people to meet 
and socialise in the community, reduced social isolation 
and positively impacted on self-confidence, self-esteem 
and mental well-being:
'After [partner] passed away I was, not a recluse, but I just 
didn’t want to talk to anybody. But since I’ve been coming 
to see [the Link Worker] I’ve broadened my horizons and 
I get out … I’ve got a lot more confidence.' (P10, male, 
60–64 years)
'Before the Ways to Wellness, I used to just stay in. But they 
explained that if you get out and about, it helps you, which 
has proven right … there were times when I wasn't feeling 
too good, and I thought, ‘I can't be bothered,’ but I've pushed 
myself. By the time I've got out and got back, I've felt 100% 
better … my health has changed a lot … it's made me feel a 
lot more confident that there's somebody there.' (P4, female, 
55–59 years)
Long-term health problems were linked to a range of social 
and economic factors including relationship breakdown, 
job loss, income reduction, debt and housing problems.

and, where possible, took practical action to maximise 
income, reduce debt and assist service users navigating 
the welfare benefits system:
'Whatever money I owed like electricity and TV licence was in 
my mind always eating me from inside. I sorted out that and 
it just changed so many things … It changed my attitude, 
it changed my behaviour and it changed my mood … I am 
not depressed like before … I feel better about everything … I 
go out almost every day … I play more, I write, I do jobs at 
home … I read more … yes, a big change.' (P30, female, 
45–49 years)
'Because of my language barrier some things I could not sort 
things out so easily, but she could. Even though I didn’t 
know about Attendance Allowance she applied for that … 
I didn’t know which benefit I could get. She said, ‘I can try 
this one.’ She tried it and she was successful and it helped me 
a lot.' (P16, female, 65–69 years)
For those of working age, health-related unemployment 
was a major problem. Steps to assist with finding paid 
or volunteer work, returning people to work or having 
reasonable adjustments to work settings were undertaken 
and highly appreciated:
'I felt 100% better after talking to [Link Worker], she was 
just excellent … She put us in contact with people [to] do a 
new CV and look for a new job, [and] found information 
out for us … which has given me the confidence to go back 
to my company … things were put in place at work, so that 
I could take my breaks when I needed them … It made a 
massive difference to me, personally … I was getting on 
board with [mental health condition], and now, I’m at work 
with renewed vigour.' (P9, male, 55–59 years)
Long-term condition management
Weight reduction and increased fitness helped partic-
ipants manage the pain and tiredness experienced as a 
result of their long-term health conditions. Some partic-
ipants with diabetes noted being in better control of 
their condition due to reduced cholesterol and sugar 
levels. Accounts of positive improvements often followed 
years of worsening health and poor long-term condition 
management:
'The instructor here has given me a programme that I'm 
working on to help build up the muscles for the legs and for 
my back … I'm managing [my arthritis] with the help of the 
gym … [also] my sugar levels … [have] come down to 4.9 
… [and] my cholesterol was 3.1, which is good … all that 
had to do with Ways to Wellness and the exercise I've been 
doing.' (P6, male, 65–69 years)
Long-term condition management services that service 
users were directed to by Link Workers were highlighted 
as extremely helpful, particularly the combination of 
expert and peer-led advice on coping and symptom 
management strategies:
'The [name] group was wonderful because there were people 
there who had similar conditions … and they have medical 
professionals come in to talk about things that are specific 
to people with chest complaints … coping mechanisms … 
gentle exercises and things to help. It improves your stamina, 
your breathing abilities and everything. So yes, that has been 
absolutely wonderful … honestly it was the turning point in 
my life. Because I had reached rock bottom and I just needed 
practical help to try and get back up … you have to manage 
your expectations as well as your illness and it has helped 
considerably.' (P8, female, 55–59 years)
Regularly engaging with services was challenging, partic-
ularly for people whose condition fluctuated and those 
suffering from more than one health problem. Service 
users worried about not always being able to attend, 
which was often a reason for not sustaining engagement 
with services in the past:
'I was really down, so I couldn't go on Friday. It's been like 
that since I first joined. I've been missing [sessions] because 
of my COPD … bad turns … chest infections … [but] they 
[Ways to Wellness] restarted me again, so they've looked after 
me … they've been really, really good … they've stuck with 
me.' (P1, male, 70–74 years)
Participants experienced Ways to Wellness as an approach 
which recognised the long-term and complex nature of 
their health problems. It supported realistic, progressive 
and personalised goal-setting. Participants’ expectations 
of progress were therefore achievable and reflected that 
a long-term approach was necessary to make improve-
ments, helping people to live with their conditions and 
improve their well-being:
'I am on the road but it is slow … work in progress … if 
it was easy I would have done it years ago … I have been 
well impressed [with Ways to Wellness]… because they have 
a very practical approach and know that it has got to be 
incremental … you can’t do everything at once so you have 
got to start small and build up … they have got the big 
picture in mind but lots of little steps in between to get there 
… I would like to get back to being wonderful in the next 
five min it is not going to happen. So I know that I have got 
to take it bit by bit so it sticks.' (P8, female, 55–59 years)
'[Link Worker] epitomises the word, wellbeing, because that’s 
what she’s got in mind for you, your wellbeing. Nothing else, 
she gives the impression that you’re the only one that she’s 
looking after, at that time, in that moment in time, you’re 
the only one that matters to her.' (P9, male, 55–59 years)
discussion
This study provides evidence about the impact of a Link 
Worker social prescribing programme on health and well-
being via improvements in health-related behaviours and 
long-term condition management. The specific model 
of social prescribing examined here comprised person-
alised support together with linkage into appropriate 
services facilitated by a Link Worker. The data reveal 
that key elements of the model are that it is: long-term 
in nature; addresses the coexistence of multimorbidity, 
mental health problems and social isolation; and, where

applicable, tackles related socioeconomic issues. This 
study demonstrates that the rapport and quality of the 
relationship between the Link Worker and service user was 
central to achieving well-being, as well as key to success-
fully linking service users into a wide range of community, 
voluntary and NHS services identified as relevant to their 
situation. Change in health-related behaviour and long-
term condition management was facilitated through 
the use of setting realistic, progressive and personalised 
goals, problem-solving, receiving regular feedback and 
social support. These behaviour change techniques 
have been shown to be effective in other lifestyle inter-
ventions.23–25 Crucially these techniques were adopted 
while also supporting individuals to address social and 
economic problems. The Link Worker social prescribing 
programme engendered feelings of control and self-con-
fidence, reduced social isolation and led to positive 
physical changes such as weight loss, increased physical 
activity, improved long-term condition management and 
mental health, greater resilience and effective coping 
strategies to manage relapses.
Psychosocial problems, particularly mental health 
conditions and social isolation, are the most common 
reasons for referral into social prescribing programmes.4 6 
A review exploring the social prescribing evidence base 
identified 24 studies diverse in methodology and the 
service being evaluated.6 The quantitative evidence in the 
review was limited with the exception of one randomised 
controlled trial demonstrating clinically important bene-
fits in managing psychosocial needs at 4 months.26 The 
quality of eight studies using quantitative methods was 
poor, with small samples and high dropout rates.6 Qual-
itative evidence, from this review and more broadly, also 
varies in quality, but generally indicates that those referred 
into social prescribing schemes report improved mental 
well-being and reduced social isolation.6 9 27 A systematic 
review and meta-analysis of exercise referral schemes, a 
type of social prescribing intervention, targeted at seden-
tary individuals with or without a medical diagnosis was 
inconclusive with regards to increasing physical activity, 
although the heterogeneity of the quality and the nature 
of the schemes is likely to have contributed to this 
conclusion.28 The data presented in our study provide 
a much more in-depth account of how Link Worker 
social prescribing positively influences long-term condi-
tion management and how this programme can lead to 
improved physical and mental health outcomes.
strengths, limitations and implications
The strength of this work lies in the depth and consis-
tency of the service user accounts regarding the impact 
of Link Worker social prescribing. Methodologically, we 
followed accepted practice in fieldwork, analysis and 
interpretation.29 30 There are a number of limitations. 
First, although the sample did include people with a wide 
range of long-term conditions, almost all with multimor-
bidity, and many experiencing social isolation and mental 
health problems we did only interview people who agreed 
to a referral, then enrolled into and remained with Ways 
to Wellness. We therefore cannot make claims about 
patients with long-term conditions who did not engage 
in the first place or who dropped out of the programme 
early. Second, we cannot be certain of the extent to which 
the experiences of the 30 study participants reflect those 
of the 1603 who used the service, although maximum 
variation sampling was used to include a wide range of 
participant experience. Third, the study lacks precise data 
about levels of participation in ‘linked’ services. We there-
fore cannot draw specific conclusions about the effects on 
health and well-being with respect to intensity and dura-
tion of ‘linked’ service use. These areas are undoubtedly 
important for further research.
Long-term health conditions are arguably the greatest 
challenge facing the NHS; they have an adverse effect 
on quality of life and reduce life expectancy. Multimor-
bidity accounts for over 70% of total healthcare spend.31 
Non-medical interventions are proposed as a cost-effec-
tive alternative to foster self-management in people with 
long-term conditions.32 33 People from lower socioeco-
nomic groups experience higher levels of chronic disease, 
and also have poorer condition management, worse 
health outcomes and higher mortality.31 Behavioural 
risk factors for long-term conditions include poor diet, 
smoking and physical inactivity, all of which are socio-
economically patterned.34 However, lifestyle behaviours 
are also affected by wider health determinants and are 
not simply choices that individuals make.35 36 Supporting 
people to make meaningful and sustainable lifestyle 
changes is complex, time-consuming, and a challenge 
for time-limited GPs.11 Given the complex and long-term 
nature of the problems faced by service users, it is unsur-
prising that a holistic and relatively intensive approach, 
as offered by Ways to Wellness, is required in order to 
facilitate and maintain behaviour change, and it is clearly 
not possible, nor appropriate to offer this level of support 
routinely in primary care. Referral into social prescribing 
programmes is likely to continue due to the need to 
tackle long-term health conditions, multimorbidity 
and an ageing population in the face of stretched NHS 
resources.33 37 The range of approaches to, and models 
of, social prescribing 38 make it challenging to amass good 
quality evidence to inform commissioning.37 38 In order to 
inform practitioners and commissioners, future research 
should be robust and comparative, addressing when, for 
whom and how well the programme works, including 
validated measures of intervention impact and accurate 
costs.37 To this we would add further qualitative, particu-
larly ethnographic, research to examine potential wider 
impacts on families and communities and how commu-
nity-based, non-medical and personalised interventions 
supplement healthcare.
