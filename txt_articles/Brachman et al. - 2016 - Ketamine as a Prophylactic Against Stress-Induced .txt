Abstract
Background—Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, not all 
individuals exposed to stress develop affective disorders. Stress resilience, the ability to experience 
stress without developing persistent psychopathology, varies from individual to individual. 
Enhancing stress resilience in at-risk populations could potentially protect against stress-induced 
psychiatric disorders. Despite this fact, no resilience-enhancing pharmaceuticals have been 
identified.
Methods—Using a chronic social defeat (SD) stress model, learned helplessness (LH), and a 
chronic corticosterone (CORT) model in mice, we tested if ketamine (K) could protect against 
depressive-like behavior. Mice were administered a single dose of saline (Sal) or ketamine and 
then one week later were subjected to 2 weeks of SD, LH training, or 3 weeks of CORT.
Results—SD robustly and reliably induced depressive-like behavior in control (Ctrl) mice. Mice 
treated with prophylactic ketamine were protected against the deleterious effects of SD in the 
forced swim test (FST) and in the dominant interaction (DI) test. We confirmed these effects in LH

 and the CORT model. In the LH model, latency to escape was increased following training—and 
this effect was prevented by ketamine. In the CORT model, a single dose of ketamine blocked 
stress-induced behavior in the FST, novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) paradigm, and the sucrose 
splash test (ST).
Conclusions—These data show that ketamine can induce persistent stress resilience and, 
therefore, may be useful in protecting against stress-induced disorders.

Introduction
Stress commonly precipitates psychiatric illness, particularly in vulnerable populations. For 
example, 1 in 5 soldiers returns from combat with PTSD or combat-associated MDD (1). 
Perhaps more surprising is that many soldiers do not develop psychopathology. While there 
has been extensive research on factors promoting susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses, few 
studies have examined what makes individuals resistant or “stress resilient.” Until recently, 
the sparse research on stress resilience has been predicated on the assumption that it is a 
passive property – more or less the absence of the risk factors that make individuals 
susceptible to stress-induced pathology (2). Recent work in animal models suggests that 
stress resilience is mediated through active processes, and often distinct, parallel 
mechanisms to those of susceptibility (3–5).
The idea that increasing stress resilience could protect against the development of 
psychiatric disorders is appealing, but treatments to increase resilience are still in their 
infancy. Current interventions fall predominantly on the behavioral side, with psychotherapy 
and exercise being the best available tools to increase resilience (6–8). Rodent studies further 
support a role for exercise and enriched environment in stress resilience (9–11). Beyond 
behavioral manipulations in mice, researchers have successfully increased resilience 
biochemically through viral and transgenic overexpression methods (12), optogenetic 
activation (4), and chronic blockade of stress hormones (13–14). However, none of these 
interventions translates to the clinic. Most promisingly, we have identified the immune 
system as a novel target for enhancing resilience. Our recent work has shown that 
manipulating leukocytes is sufficient to increase stress resilience (15) and Hodes et al. have 
shown a similar effect by modulating cytokines (16). Though hopefully these discoveries 
will lead to therapeutic interventions in humans, they are not yet clinic-ready.
Antidepressants are typically used to treat existing depressive symptoms, but chronic 
antidepressant treatment also protects against subsequent depressive episodes (17–21). 
Maintenance treatment in MDD patients is often referred to as prophylaxis against the 
development of additional depressive episodes (22). Whether this prophylactic effect against 
symptomatic episodes in disordered individuals extrapolates out to preventing de novo 
psychiatric disorders remains to be tested.

 Ketamine has been shown to have antidepressant effects as rapidly as 2 hours following a 
single injection in patients with MDD (23). Whereas classical antidepressants require 
ongoing daily administration to maintain therapeutic efficacy, ketamine has the benefit of 
being administered as a single dose (23–24). Because ketamine has a window of therapeutic 
efficacy far beyond its half-life of a few hours (23–25), it is an excellent candidate for a 
plausible approach to pharmacologically increasing stress resilience.
Therefore, we first utilized SD in order to examine whether ketamine could increase stress 
resilience and thereby, protect against de novo induction of psychopathology. We 
hypothesized that ketamine would confer stress resiliency to mice if administered prior to 
stress. We chose to perform SD in 129S6/SvEvTac mice, which robustly and reliably 
develop a depressive-like phenotype following SD (26). Mice were administered either 
saline or a single sub-anesthetic injection of ketamine and, one week later, SD was 
administered to half of the mice. We found that a single injection of ketamine induced robust 
stress resilience that persisted for at least 3 weeks post-injection. Moreover, we confirmed 
our effects in two additional models in which depressive/anxious behavior is induced by 
chronic elevation of glucocorticoids in C57BL/6NTac mice (27), or by repeated, 
unescapable shocks (LH) (28–30). Again, a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, 
administered 4 weeks before behavioral assessment decreased immobility in the FST and 
protected against depressive-like behavior in the NSF paradigm and the ST. In the LH 
model, the latency to escape a shock increases with LH training and this effect was 
prevented by prophylactic ketamine. These findings demonstrate that the protective effect of 
ketamine extends at least 4 weeks post-injection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
examine the potential of psychopharmaceuticals to provide long-term prophylactic 
protection against the induction of stress-related disorders.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Male 129S6/SvEvTac mice were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY). CD-1 mice were 
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) at 8–10 weeks of age and 
housed individually until the start of SD. The procedures described herein were conducted in 
accordance with the National Institutes of Health regulations and approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Columbia University and the New York 
State Psychiatric Institute.
Male C57BL/6NTac mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Lille Skensved, Denmark) 
at 8 weeks of age and were housed 5 per cage before the start of CORT treatment. All testing 
was conducted in compliance with the laboratory animal care guidelines and with protocols 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (European Directive, 
2010/63/EU for the protection of laboratory animals, permissions # 92-256B, authorization 
ethical committee CEEA n°26 2012_098).
All mice were housed in a 12-h (06:00–18:00) light-dark colony room at 22°C. Food and 
water were provided ad libitum. Behavioral testing was performed during the light phase.

 Results
Ketamine administration prior to SD protects against the induction of depressive-like 
behavior
Mice were administered a single injection of saline or ketamine (30 mg kg−1) (Figure 1A). 
One week later, mice either remained group housed (Ctrl) or underwent SD. After 2 weeks 
of SD, mice were weighed (Figure S2A), and behavior was assessed.
Classically, immobility in the FST has been interpreted as an index of hopelessness or a 
negative mood (31). Rodents given acute or chronic antidepressants exhibit decreased 
immobility (32). Here, on day 2 of the FST, there was an overall effect of SD on immobility 
time. Ctrl-Sal and Ctrl-K displayed equal levels of immobility time (Figure 1B). In SD mice, 
ketamine (SD-K) significantly decreased immobility time when compared with saline (SD-
Sal) (Figure 1C–1D). These data indicate that ketamine increases resilience to behavioral 
despair as measured by the FST.
DI is a robust way of testing the induction of depressive-like behavior by SD (10) (Figure 
1E). As expected, SD-Sal mice spent significantly more time investigating an empty 
enclosure quadrant than Ctrl-Sal mice (Figure 1F). Ctrl (Sal or K) mice spent an equivalent 
amount of time investigating the empty enclosure quadrant. SD-K mice exhibited 
significantly less time investigating the empty enclosure quadrant when compared with SD-
Sal mice. Similarly, SD-K mice exhibited a significantly increased willingness to interact 
with the CD-1 when compared with SD-Sal mice (Figure 1G). There was an overall effect of 
SD and of ketamine on decreasing the distance traveled, but the interaction was not 
significant (Figure 1H).
To determine if this exploration deficit extended to neutral environments, open field (OF) 
exploration was investigated in an arena scented with female urine (Figure S3). We did not 
detect any differences in the empty quadrant or the urine quadrant between Ctrl and SD 
mice. Furthermore, to determine if social avoidance generalized to other mice, we also 
assessed social interaction (SI) with a novel mouse (Figure S4). We did not find an effect of 
SD or ketamine on SI. In summary, these data suggest that SD decreases exploration and 
willingness to interact with a CD-1 aggressor, and that prior ketamine administration 
protects against this deleterious effect of SD on social behavior.
An injection of ketamine prior to SD does not impact anxiety-like behavior or contextual 
fear memory
We next examined the effects of ketamine on anxiety-like and cognitive tests. In the NSF 
paradigm, we found no significant effect of SD or ketamine on the latency to feed (Figure 
2A). In fact, all groups showed similar latencies (Figure 2B). This effect is confounded: 
despite having comparable body weights before and after SD (Figure 2C), SD mice lost 
significantly more weight during the 12 h fast preceding NSF than Ctrl mice (Figure 2D). 
Possibly as a result, SD mice ate more in a home cage following NSF when compared with 
Ctrl mice (Figure 2E). These findings suggest that SD significantly alters metabolism.

 We observed a significant effect of SD in an anxiety-related test, the elevated plus maze 
(EPM). SD mice spent more time in the closed arms than Ctrl mice (Figure 2F). However, 
there was no significant effect of ketamine in either group. The absence of an effect of 
ketamine in the EPM is consistent with previous studies (33–34), as it remains to be 
established if ketamine is as robust an anxiolytic as it is an antidepressant (35).
Finally, we assessed the impact of prior treatment with ketamine on 1-shock contextual fear 
conditioning (CFC) (36–37) (Figure 2G). One group previously found that SD increased 
context-elicited fear following 3-shock CFC (38). However, we chose to utilize a weak CFC 
training paradigm, as we have previously shown this 1-shock CFC paradigm to be sensitive 
to the ablation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (36–37) and to SD (26). Here, we found 
no effect of either SD or ketamine on baseline freezing levels on day 1 of CFC training 
(Figure 2H). Ketamine or SD had no effect on freezing during exposure to the fearful 
context A (Figure 2I) or a novel context B (Figure 2J). Though this does not allow us to 
interpret any stress resilience effect of ketamine, as there is no effect of stress to protect 
against, it does at least demonstrate that a single injection of ketamine does not appear to 
interfere with the ability to form contextual memories in mice.
The ketamine-induced improvement is dose-specific
We next examined a dose titration curve of ketamine. Mice were administered 0, 10, 30, or 
90 mg kg−1 of ketamine before the start of SD. After 2 weeks of SD, mice underwent the 
FST and CORT levels were measured following a brief stressor. We replicated our previous 
SD effect, as SD-Sal mice displayed significantly more immobility time in the FST when 
compared with Ctrl-Sal (Figure 3A). However, SD-Sal and SD-K (10 mg kg−1) mice did not 
differ in immobility time (Figure 3B). SD-K (30 mg kg−1) mice again displayed significantly 
less immobility when compared with SD-Sal mice (Figure 3C). SD-Sal and SD-K (90 mg 
kg−1) mice did not differ in immobility time (Figure 3D–3E).
As the HPA-axis is dysregulated in mice following SD (14), we also tested whether 
ketamine protected against the deleterious effect of SD on the stress response. Following a 
brief stressor, SD-Sal mice had significantly lower levels of CORT than Ctrl-Sal mice 
(Figure 3F), suggesting that SD blunts the response of the HPA axis. However, all ketamine-
injected mice did not differ from Ctrl-Sal mice, suggesting that ketamine partially restores 
the HPA axis. To determine if adult hippocampal neurogenesis was modulating, as least in 
part, these effects, we measured maturation of newborn neurons and proliferation of 
newborn neurons by quantifying the levels of doublecortin (DCX) and Ki67, respectively. 
We did not observe an effect of ketamine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Figure S5). 
These data suggest that the ketamine improvement in depressive-like behavior may be 
mediated in part by changes in HPA functionality, but not necessarily by adult hippocampal 
neurogenesis.
Prophylactic ketamine alters fighting behavior during SD bouts
To determine if ketamine also affected behavior during SD, we analyzed individual fighting 
bouts. The total fighting bout length did not differ between groups (Figure S6A). However, 
the average immobility during week 2 was significantly decreased in SD-K mice when

 compared with SD-Sal mice (Figure S6B). The percent of time vocalizing (Figure S6C) and 
number of approaches to the CD-1 (Figure S6D) did not differ between the groups. These 
data suggest that mice administered ketamine may not be as fearful of the CD-1 mice and, 
therefore, spend less time immobile.
We next analyzed the latency of the CD-1 to attack the 129S6/SvEv mouse (Figure S6E–G). 
CD-1s comparably attacked SD-Sal and SD-K (10 or 90 mg kg−1) mice. However, at the 
start of SD, CD-1s attacked SD-K (30 mg kg−1) mice significantly later than SD-Sal mice. 
These data suggest that perhaps the mice receiving K (30 mg kg−1) have an advantageous 
ongoing response to SD when compared to Sal mice.
Fluoxetine treatment prior to SD does not protect against the induction of depressive-like 
behavior
We next determined if this protective effect of ketamine extended to other antidepressants. 
Mice were administered 3 weeks of fluoxetine (Flx) (18 mg kg−1) treatment before the start 
of SD (Figure 4A and Figure S7). On day 2 of the FST, Ctrl-Vehicle (Veh) and Ctrl-Flx 
displayed equal levels of immobility time (Figure 4B). In SD mice, fluoxetine did not 
improve immobility time induced by SD (Figure 4C–4D). These data indicate that 
fluoxetine, unlike ketamine, is not capable of preventing stress-induced behavioral despair as 
measured by the FST.
We also assessed a number of other behaviors following fluoxetine treatment (Figure S8). 
Fluoxetine treatment did not significantly alter anxiety or cognition, but did affect 
metabolism (Figure S8G–S8H). Interestingly, unlike SD-K (30 mg kg−1) mice, SD-Flx mice 
do not display differences during SD bouts when compared with SD-Veh mice (Figure S9). 
These data suggest that fluoxetine treatment cannot protect against depressive-like behavior 
as ketamine does.
Ketamine administered after SD does not improve depressive-like behavior
In order to compare the robustness of prophylactic ketamine relative to its typical use as an 
antidepressant, we next asked if ketamine could improve behavioral despair if administered 
after SD (Figure 5A). Mice were administered 2 weeks of SD and then received one 
injection of saline or ketamine the day after the final SD session. On day 2 of the FST, Ctrl-
Sal and Ctrl-K mice did not display different immobility time (Figure 5B). SD-Sal and SD-
K mice had similar levels of immobility time (Figure 5C). We averaged minutes 3–6 and 
found that SD increased immobility time, but ketamine given after SD did not decrease 
immobility time (Figure 5D). These data indicate that ketamine more potently decreases 
behavioral despair in the FST when given as a prophylactic before SD than after SD.
We also assessed a number of other behaviors following ketamine treatment (Figure S10). In 
Ctrl mice, ketamine decreased the latency to eat in the NSF when compared with saline 
(Figure S10A). This effect was abolished in the SD mice, most likely due to weight loss 
differences between Ctrl and SD mice (Figure S10B–S10C). Interestingly, ketamine 
lessened the percentage of weight loss in the SD mice when compared with saline, possibly 
by protecting against stress-induced hypophagia (Figure S10D). Ketamine also did not 
impact CFC learning (Figure S10G–S10J). Most importantly, although we did not detect

 differences from prophylactic ketamine treatment, we did determine that ketamine 
administered after SD significantly increases the number of Ki67+ cells in the DG (Figure 
S10K).
Prophylactic ketamine protects against learned helplessness
We hypothesized that ketamine would protect against LH, a paradigm in which a mouse is 
exposed to inescapable shocks (28–30). Mice were injected with saline or ketamine and 
administered an inescapable shock stress protocol (LH training) 1 week later (Figure 6A). 
Two weeks later, mice were administered a shock escape protocol (LH testing) and the 
latency to escape the shock was measured. The activity in the habituation phase during 
testing did not differ between mice administered saline or ketamine (Figure 6B). However, 
mice injected with ketamine had a decreased latency to escape the shock when compared 
with mice injected with saline (Figure 6C–6D). Moreover, the session length was 
significantly shorter in the ketamine mice than in the saline mice (Figure 6E). These data 
indicate that ketamine protection is not just limited to SD stress.
Prophylactic ketamine protects against the depressive-like effects of chronic 
corticosterone treatment
To address whether ketamine was protective in a third stress model, we utilized a mouse 
model of anxiety/depression based on elevation of glucocorticoids (3 weeks of chronic 
CORT administration in C57BL/6NTac mice) (27). We tested the protective effects of a 
chronic fluoxetine treatment (18 mg kg−1 for 3 weeks) or a single injection of ketamine (10, 
30, or 90 mg kg−1) given before CORT administration (Figure 7A). We found that ketamine 
(90 mg kg−1) and fluoxetine prevented the CORT-induced increase in body weight (Figure 
S11A).
Both ketamine (90 mg kg−1) and fluoxetine decreased immobility time on day 2 in the FST 
(Figure 7B–7C). Chronic CORT induced depressive-like symptoms (e.g. increased grooming 
latency) in the ST (Figure 7D). Here, ketamine (90 mg kg−1), but not fluoxetine, prevented 
the chronic CORT-induced depressive-like phenotype (Figure 7D). These data indicate that 
the protective effect of ketamine extends to a third depression model.
In the NSF, ketamine (10 and 90 mg kg−1) prevented the chronic CORT-induced increase in 
latency to feed (Figures 7E, S11). However, only ketamine (90 mg kg−1) increased home 
cage food consumption (Figure 7F). Finally, we assayed anxiety behavior using the EPM 
(Figure S12). CORT-Veh mice spent more time in the closed arms than Veh-Veh mice. 
Neither ketamine nor fluoxetine robustly protected against this anxiety-like phenotype. In 
summary, these data suggest that 90 mg kg−1 of ketamine is the most effective dose in 
protecting against depressive-like behavior following chronic CORT treatment.
Ketamine administered after chronic corticosterone does not improve depressive-like 
behavior
Finally, as in the SD model, we measured the behavioral impact of ketamine when given 
after CORT (Figure S13A). In this experimental design, mice were administered 4 weeks of 
CORT and then received either one injection of saline or ketamine, or vehicle or fluoxetine

 for 2 weeks. Here, we utilized the tail suspension test (TST) and the NSF in order to test the 
same behavior on multiple occasions. Fluoxetine, but not ketamine, decreased immobility 
time in the TST at both time points tested following CORT (Figure S13B–S13C). In the 
NSF, CORT treatment increased the latency to feed when compared with Veh treatment. 
Fluoxetine, but not ketamine, decreased the latency to feed 14 days, but not 7 days after the 
start of treatment (Figure S13D–S13I). In summary, as previously demonstrated in the SD 
model, these data further indicate that ketamine more potently improves depressive-like 
behavior when given as a prophylactic before CORT treatment rather than after CORT 
treatment.
Discussion
Here, we have shown that a single injection of ketamine administered before SD protected 
mice against stress-induced increased immobility time in the FST. Additionally, ketamine 
protected mice against stress-induced social avoidance of an aggressor mouse. We found that 
mice administered ketamine prior to SD were protected against stress-induced depressive-
like behavior, but, consistent with the literature definition of stress resilience, their behavior 
in anxiety tests and levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis were not significantly altered. 
Interestingly, in the SD paradigm, only a sub-anesthetic dose (30 mg kg−1) of ketamine was 
found to be effective.
The prophylactic effect of ketamine was recapitulated in two additional models. In LH, 
ketamine decreased depressive-like, helpless behavior. In the CORT model, ketamine 
protective against depressive-like behaviors (FST, ST), anxiety (NSF), and metabolic 
changes (body weight), albeit at a slightly higher dose (90 mg kg−1) than in SD or LH. The 
efficacy of the higher dose in the CORT model is perhaps attributable to mouse strain 
differences (C57BL/6NTac versus 129S6/SvEv). Nevertheless, the dose administered in the 
CORT model is in the anesthetic range, whereas the dose in the SD/LH model is 
subanesthetic. If an equivalent anesthetic dose were required to obtain prophylactic efficacy 
in humans, acute side effects would need to be considered when developing treatment 
regimens.
Administration of the classical antidepressant fluoxetine prior to stress did not consistently 
or robustly protect against stress-induced depressive-like behavior. In the SD model, 
fluoxetine did not improve immobility time in the FST, but in the CORT model, fluoxetine 
protected against immobility time in the FST and body weight alterations. Thus, it remains 
to be fully determined if other antidepressant drugs other than ketamine can protect against 
depressive-like behavior. Perhaps other drugs may be more useful in protecting against 
coincident stress-induced pathologies (e.g., anxiety, cognitive deficits, metabolic 
disturbances).
Though preventing psychopathology has obvious advantages over non-curative medication 
regimens, we also wanted to assess the relative potency of ketamine’s protective and 
antidepressant effects. Interestingly, when ketamine was administered following stress, we 
did not observe a significant decrease in immobility time in the FST or TST. In our SD 
model, we utilized a 30 mg kg−1 dose, but in the CORT model, we utilized a 10 mg kg−1

 dose in order to compare with more recent studies using ketamine as an antidepressant in 
C57Bl mice (12, 33). This suggests that the beneficial effects of ketamine on stress-induced 
pathology may be more robust when given prior to stress. In contrast, Donahue and 
colleagues recently found the converse when they administered ketamine either 1 h after the 
final SD session or 24 h before the first SD session (12). A high (20 mg kg−1)—but not low 
(2.5 mg kg−1)—dose of ketamine following the final SD session attenuated social avoidance, 
but not anhedonia. Conversely, when ketamine (20 mg kg−1) was administered before SD, it 
did not attenuate social avoidance. The lack of effect in their experiments, however, does not 
mean that ketamine’s protective effect is not as robust as we suggest. The effect of ketamine 
is less likely effective as a C57Bl/6J strain is utilized in the Donahue study and, as we have 
shown in the CORT model, a higher dose is necessary for prophylactic efficacy in C57Bl 
mice. For future studies, we believe that a dose titration curve is necessary in each model. 
Based on our data, we predict that ketamine dosing for prophylactic administration may 
likely differ from antidepressant administration.
Ketamine-induced resilience is robust and long lasting – persisting at least 3 weeks post-
injection in the SD model and 4 weeks post-injection in the CORT model. It is worth noting 
that, as the half-life of ketamine is only a few hours in rodents (39), ketamine is not 
bioactive at any point during the SD fighting bouts, LH, or CORT administration. Thus, the 
process by which ketamine protects against depressive-like behavior is necessarily self-
maintaining. Further investigation will be required to identify the mechanisms underlying 
this process. We have shown, however, that ketamine can alter ongoing response to a chronic 
stressor. In the SD model, our data suggest that ketamine alters the way in which mice react 
to the fighting bouts, which may contribute to the differences in developing depressive-like 
behavior at a later time point. Not only do the SD-K (30 mg kg−1) mice have a decreased 
immobility time during the fighting bouts, but also the CD-1 mice attack the SD-K (30 mg 
kg−1) mice with longer latencies.
Work done characterizing stress-resilience in other models has implicated a series of 
mechanisms including: adult hippocampal neurogenesis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
(HPA) output (10, 13–14), FosB expression in the prefrontal cortex (11, 40) and striatum 
(12), activation of the infralimbic cortex and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (4–5, 11–
12, 41–44), glutamatergic tone (38), and altered leukocyte and cytokine profiles (15–16). 
Additionally, ketamine has been shown to induce rapid and persistent remodeling of 
synapses (45). In our model, ketamine administration acutely, but transiently, increases 
proliferative adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Whether this contributes to mechanisms of 
prophylactic or antidepressant ketamine remains to be determined. As ketamine prevents 
SD-induced HPA axis dysregulation, we hypothesize that the HPA axis may partially 
mediate the differences in how the SD-K mice respond to the SD fighting bouts. Further 
analysis will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ketamine’s resilience-
enhancing properties. It is worth noting that these mechanisms are likely divergent from 
those of ketamine’s antidepressant effects.
In summary, these experiments demonstrate that ketamine has a long-lasting resilience-
enhancing effect and protects against the deleterious effects of chronic stress on depressive-
like behaviors. Because the protective effect of ketamine persists beyond its half-life of 2–

 2.5 hours, assuming the prophylactic effect translates to humans, it is potentially useful as a 
vaccine-like strategy in at-risk populations where high-stress conditions can be predicted. 
Active combat soldiers offer a good example of a predictably at-risk patient population. 
Administration of ketamine prior to deployment may mitigate the emergence of PTSD or 
other stress-related disorders in this vulnerable population. How far out this prophylaxis 
persists is as of yet unknown. Whether subsequent injections would have a similar, 
increasing, or deleterious effect on stress resilience also has yet to be tested. If these effects 
do translate from mice to humans, ketamine may offer a novel, clinic-ready approach to 
protect and prevent at-risk patients from developing stress-induced disorders.

Ketamine protects against depressive-like behavior following SD. (A) Experimental design. 
(B) On day 2 of the FST, Ctrl-Sal and Ctrl-K mice did not differ from each other. (C) SD-K 
mice exhibited significantly less immobility time when compared with SD-Sal mice. (D) 
Average immobility time for minutes 3–6 was increased in the SD-Sal mice when compared 
with Ctrl-Sal mice. The SD-K mice displayed an average immobility time that was less than 
the SD-Sal mice. (E) DI traces. (F) SD-Sal mice spent significantly more time investigating 
the empty enclosure when compared with the Ctrl-Sal mice. Conversely, SD-K mice spent 
significantly less time investigating the empty enclosure when compared with the SD-Sal 
mice. (G) SD-K mice spent considerably more time investigating a CD-1 mouse when 
compared with SD-Sal mice. (H) There was an overall effect of SD and of ketamine on 
decreasing the distance traveled during SI, but the interaction did not reach significance. (n = 
13–15 male mice per group). Error bars represent ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p <

Ketamine does not protect against anxiety-like behavior or impair CFC learning following 
SD. (A–B) In the NSF paradigm, all groups had equivalent average latencies to approach the 
food pellet. (C) Body weight did not differ between any of the groups before the start of 
NSF. (D) SD mice lost approximately 25% more body weight than Ctrl mice. (E) SD mice 
consumed significantly more food than Ctrl mice. (F) In the EPM test, SD mice spent 
significantly more time in the closed arms when compared with Ctrl mice. (G–H) All groups 
of mice had comparable levels of freezing during CFC training in context A, following re-
exposure to fearful context A, and during exposure to a novel context B. (n = 13–15 male 
mice per group). Error bars represent ± SEM. ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.

The ketamine-induced protection against depressive-like behavior is dose-specific. (A) On 
day 2 of the FST, SD-Sal mice displayed significantly more immobility time in the FST 
when compared with Ctrl-Sal mice. (B) SD-Sal and SD-K (10 mg kg−1) mice did not differ 
in immobility. (C) SD-K (30 mg kg−1) mice displayed significantly less immobility time 
when compared with SD-Sal mice. (D) SD-Sal and SD-K (90 mg kg−1) mice did not differ 
in immobility time. (E) For minutes 3–6 (averaged), SD-Sal mice displayed significantly 
more immobility in the FST when compared with Ctrl-Sal mice. SD-K (30 mg kg−1) mice 
again displayed decreased immobility when compared with SD-Sal mice. (F) Following a 
brief stressor, SD-Sal mice had significantly lower levels of CORT when compared with 
Ctrl-Sal mice. (n = 7–8 male mice per group). Error bars represent ± SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p

administered K (90 mg kg−1) or Flx (18 mg kg−1/day) exhibited significantly reduced 
immobility in the FST. (D) Chronic CORT increased the latency to groom during the ST. In 
contrast to Flx, K for the highest doses tested (90 mg kg−1) decreased the latency to groom 
during the ST. (E) K (10 and 90 mg kg−1) decreased the latency to feed in the NSF. K (90 
mg kg−1) increased home food consumption. (n = 10–15 male mice per group). Error bars
