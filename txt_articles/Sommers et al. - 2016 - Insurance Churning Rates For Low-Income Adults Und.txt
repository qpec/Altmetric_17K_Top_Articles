ABSTRACT 
Changes in insurance over time – “churning” – may lead to adverse consequences, but there has 
been little evidence to date on churning since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act 
(ACA).  We explored the frequency and implications of churning with a survey of over 3000 
low-income adults in three states with different ACA policies: Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas.  
We also compared 2015 churning rates in these states to pre-ACA survey data from 2013.  
Overall, 20-25% of respondents experienced a change in coverage in the previous 12 months. 
While frequent, this rate was lower than some pre-ACA predictions.  Churning rates were similar 
after Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion and Arkansas’ private option, compared to Texas, which 
did not expand.  Common causes were job-related changes and loss of Medicaid/Marketplace 
eligibility.  Churning was associated with disruptions in physician care and medications, trouble 
obtaining primary and specialty care appointments, and more ED use.  Overall, 35-40% of 
churners felt that it had adversely impacted their quality of care and health.  Outcomes were 
worst among those experiencing gaps in coverage, but even those who churned without 
becoming uninsured reported adverse effects.  Our results indicate policies are needed to reduce 
churning frequency and to mitigate negative impacts when it occurs.

Introduction 
The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) coverage expansion is now in its third full year and 
has brought the nation’s uninsured rate to an all-time low, from 16.0% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015.1 
However, obtaining coverage is only part of the policy challenge in improving health care.  
Movement between and out of health plans – often called “churning” – may occur frequently, 
particularly among lower-income individuals.   
The U.S.’s multi-payer system creates the possibility of several types of coverage 
transitions, many of which predate the ACA.  These transitions include switching into or out of 
employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) due to a job change; switching between sources of 
subsidized coverage due to eligibility changes (e.g., Marketplace to Medicaid and vice versa); 
loss of coverage due to eligibility changes (Medicaid to uninsured); switching between plans 
within the same coverage type, either voluntarily (e.g., a better plan became available) or 
involuntarily (e.g., plan exit from the Marketplace); and administrative disruptions in coverage 
(e.g., difficulty with the Medicaid renewal process). 
Within each of these transitions, some people may become uninsured for a time, while 
others may switch between different insurance types or plans without a coverage gap.  While the 
former is likely to expose individuals to significant financial risk and impaired access to care,2,3 
even the latter may create negative effects because insurance benefits and provider networks 
often differ across coverage and plan types,4 and changing providers has been linked to adverse 
outcomes.5   
Previous research indicates that even before the ACA, churning was a common 
phenomenon, with annual rates of coverage disruptions estimated at 12% for those with 
employer-provided insurance,6 43% in Medicaid,2 and 58% in non-group private insurance.7  
  
4 
Multiple analyses projected that churning would be a major challenge under the ACA in all 
states,8-10 but there has been limited evidence to date on actual churning since the law’s coverage 
expansions took effect. 
Policymakers have considered various options to address this issue.  One approach is 
currently being tested in Arkansas, where most new Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in 
subsidized Marketplace plans rather than traditional Medicaid.11  By primarily providing private 
insurance to adults both above and below the ACA’s Medicaid eligibility threshold of 138% of 
poverty, Arkansas’s “private option” model may reduce the need for low-income adults to switch 
provider networks and treatment regimens in response to income fluctuations and other changes 
in life circumstances.12  Several other states, including Iowa and New Hampshire, have adopted 
alternative approaches to Medicaid expansion that also use private coverage. 
Despite the potential for adverse effects associated with churning, there is little 
information in the literature on the impact of churning under the ACA, and there has been 
limited evidence to date on policy efforts to reduce its impact through approaches like the one 
employed in Arkansas.  In this study, we report our findings from a survey of over 3,000 low-
income adults in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas from late 2015.  Each state included in the 
survey has taken different pathways to Medicaid expansion under the ACA – the private option 
in Arkansas, a traditional Medicaid expansion in Kentucky, and no expansion in Texas.   
Our objective was to address three questions: what was the frequency of churning and the 
risk factors for experiencing it; what were the most common causes of churning; and what were 
the consequences on continuity of care, access to care, quality of care, and health.  We 
hypothesized that churning would have negative impacts on several dimensions of health care, 
but that the private option model in Arkansas would reduce churning rates considerably.

METHODS 
Survey Design  
 
We conducted a telephone survey using random digit dialing of both landline and cell 
phones in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas.  The sample was restricted to U.S. citizens between 
19-64 years old with family incomes below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).  Both 
English and Spanish interviews were available.  For all estimates, survey weights were 
constructed using the American Community Survey and National Health Interview Survey to 
yield population-representative estimates for our study population.  Additional details regarding 
the survey methodology have been previously published.13 
 
The survey instrument assessed respondents’ current insurance status and how many 
times they had changed coverage in the past twelve months, defined as “losing, gaining or 
switching one’s health insurance plan.”  In the paper, for brevity, we refer to these episodes as 
“churning,” though we did not use that language in the survey itself.  Respondents who reported 
any episodes of churning in the past year were asked a series of questions about related impacts 
on continuity of provider relationships, prescription medication use, as well as quality of care 
and health status.  All respondents provided information about access to care, affordability, 
utilization, and demographic characteristics.  Survey questions were adapted from past surveys 
when feasible,14-16 and the instrument was pilot-tested before going into the field (see Appendix 
for precise question wording).17 
 
The survey was conducted in November and December of 2015 with a response rate of 
21%, for a total sample of 3,011 individuals distributed evenly across the three states.  This 
survey built on two prior surveys conducted in these states in 2013 and 2014 that did not focus 
  
6 
on churning but instead focused on other aspects of health care for low-income adults; however 
those prior surveys did ask about overall churning frequency.  Thus, for the measure of churning 
frequency, we also compared the 2015 data to responses from a separate cohort of 2,823 adults 
who answered the same question in our 2013 survey, prior to the ACA’s major coverage 
expansions.  
 
Analysis  
 
We examined the frequency of churning across the three states by comparing the 
proportion of respondents who had experienced no coverage changes, one change, or at least two 
changes in the past year.  We also estimated the proportions changing coverage from the pre-
ACA period (2013) to the post-ACA period (2015), comparing Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion 
to Arkansas’s private option and Texas’s lack of expansion.  This analysis employed a 
differences-in-differences regression model, comparing the three states before and after the 
ACA, controlling for the state, year, race/ethnicity, age, gender, marital status, education, rural 
vs. urban residence, and family size.   
Then, using our 2015 survey data, we assessed causes and implications of churning.  We 
examined current coverage type and the total months of coverage for each individual in the past 
year, estimating the percentage of individuals experiencing a coverage gap.  Respondents were 
then asked to identify the main reason for their coverage change: going from uninsured to new 
coverage, change in job or job-related coverage, did not like old plan, loss of eligibility, inability 
to afford old plan, old plan no longer available, and could not complete the renewal process.   
Next, we used multivariate logistic regression to analyze which demographic predictors 
were associated with churning.  Covariates in the model included sex, marital status, rural vs. 
  
7 
urban residence, cell phone or landline survey, self-reported health, having one or more chronic 
medical condition, age, race/ethnicity, education, income, state of residence, and insurance 
status.  
Our remaining analyses focused on assessing the potential negative consequences of 
churning.  We excluded those who had gone from uninsured to new coverage, and focused on 
two distinct groups of people experiencing potentially harmful churning: first, those who 
churned with a gap in coverage (i.e. went from insured to uninsured at some point), and second, 
those who churned without a gap in coverage (i.e. switched from one type of insurance to 
another without becoming uninsured).  We asked these individuals whether they had to change 
their primary care or specialist providers due to insurance; switched or stopped taking any 
prescription medications due to insurance changes; and whether their coverage change had a 
positive, negative, or no impact on the quality of medical care they received and on their overall 
health.  
Lastly, we investigated whether churning was associated with several measures of access 
to and affordability of care.  These questions were asked of the full sample.  For this analysis, we 
conducted multivariate logistic regression for each outcome to assess whether churning (with or 
without a gap in coverage) was associated with changes in these outcomes.  We reported our 
results as adjusted odds ratios and converted them into predicted probabilities, to better convey 
the absolute change in outcomes after adjustment for covariates.  All analyses were conducted 
using Stata version 13.1. 
 
Limitations  
  
8 
 
There are several relevant limitations to our study.  First, the response rate to our survey 
was 21% in 2015 and 26% in 2013.  While these rates are lower than those in government 
surveys, appropriate weighting to demographic benchmarks has been shown to reduce non-
response bias,18 and previous research using random-digit dialing surveys – with similar or even 
lower response rates – have produced valuable insights into the ACA across a range of topics 
that have been generally consistent with results from government surveys.19-22 
 
Many of our analyses rely on self-reported outcomes regarding health, utilization of 
health care services, and quality of care.  Such reports may be subject to recall bias.  
Furthermore, the extent to which the adverse outcomes reported by respondents in our survey 
can be causally linked to churning is unclear.  In part to address this concern, we present two 
distinct approaches to measuring potential adverse results of churning: first, we asked 
respondents directly what effects they attribute to churning; then, using multivariate regression, 
we assessed whether certain results were more common among those with coverage changes 
after adjusting for other factors.  However, individuals may not accurately attribute adverse 
events to the experience of churning, and unmeasured confounders could explain some of the 
relationships we observed in our regression models.  
 
Finally, since our sample was restricted to three southern states, the results may not be 
generalizable to other states or regions of the United States.  Moreover, though overall rates of 
churning were similar, the pattern of churning and challenges it creates may differ significantly 
across these states.  However, these states were chosen for their distinct approaches to ACA 
implementation and therefore are useful case studies for how these policy approaches may – or 
may not – influence churning and associated outcomes.

RESULTS 
Churning Rates and Reasons for Coverage Changes 
 
Exhibit 1 shows overall rates of churning in our study states.  In 2015, nearly one quarter 
of respondents reported one or more changes in health insurance status in the past twelve 
months.  Churning rates were fairly similar across states both in the pre-ACA (2013) and post-
ACA (2015) periods.  A differences-in-differences logistic regression model showed no 
significant changes based on the state’s expansion policy, with Arkansas’s private option in 2015 
associated with an odds ratio for churning of 0.99 compared to Texas (p=0.98), and Kentucky’s 
Medicaid expansion with an odds ratio of 1.13 compared to Texas (p=0.61), both compared to 
the 2013 baseline.  Linear differences-in-differences models also showed no significant changes 
related to the states’ expansion approaches. 
Exhibit 2 describes patterns of coverage gaps and reasons for the changes. Among those 
with coverage changes in our sample, 56% experienced a gap in insurance and nearly 30% were 
uninsured for longer than four months.  Fewer Kentuckians who churned (47.8%) experienced a 
gap in coverage, compared to Arkansans (58.4%) or Texans (60.7%), though this difference was 
not statistically significant (p=0.15).  
Overall, nearly 20% of those who churned did so because they gained insurance 
coverage.  The proportion gaining insurance was approximately double in Arkansas and 
Kentucky compared to Texas (p=0.09).  The remaining respondents churned for other reasons: 
33.8% cited an employment-related change, 14.9% had lost eligibility for subsidized insurance in 
Medicaid or the Marketplace, and 14.1% couldn’t afford to keep their coverage.  Smaller shares 
of respondents said their old plan was no longer available or that they had trouble completing the 
  
10 
renewal process.  Reasons for churning differed significantly across the study states.  
Respondents in Texas were the most likely to say they dropped coverage because they couldn’t 
afford it (24.1%), while those in Arkansas were more likely to say their plan was no longer 
available (19.1%).  Respondents in Kentucky were the most likely to report trouble with the 
renewal process as a cause for churning (13.6%).   
In our remaining analyses, we exclude those who went from uninsured to insured (i.e. 
gaining new coverage) from “churning,” since this is a desired result of coverage expansion. 
Appendix Exhibit 1 shows which demographic factors were associated with churning in 
2015, excluding those who went from uninsured to insured.17  Churning was significantly more 
common among women and younger adults, and less common among Latinos.  Churning was 
roughly twice as common among those with Marketplace coverage (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.13, 
p=0.001) or non-group private coverage (OR=2.67, p=0.002), relative to Medicaid, and was 
lower in Arkansas (OR=0.59, p=0.007) and Kentucky (OR=0.64, p=0.035) compared to Texas.  
Churning in the two expansion states did not differ from each other. 
 
Implications of Coverage Changes  
 
Exhibit 3 describes disruptions in health care as a consequence of coverage changes 
(excluding those whose coverage change was going from uninsured to insured).  Nearly 20% of 
churners had to change their doctor(s), often both primary care and specialists.  Changing doctors 
was more common among churners with a coverage gap compared to those without a gap (25.2% 
vs. 13.3%, p=0.016).  Churning also impacted medication use: 16.2% of churners had to switch 
or change their prescription medications, and 33.9% either skipped doses or stopped taking their 
medications as a result of a coverage change.  Skipping medications was more common among 
  
11 
those with coverage gaps than without gaps (44.9% vs. 22.4%, p<0.001).  More than half 
(51.7%) of churners with a coverage gap reported that their coverage change had a negative 
impact on the overall quality of their medical care, and a similar share (47.3%) reported that 
churning had negatively impacted their health.  Even among those who switched coverage 
without a gap, more than 20% reported a negative effect on quality of care and health.    
Appendix Exhibit 2 shows these outcomes by state.17   The proportion of churners who 
had to change doctors because of insurance was significantly higher in Texas (32.3%) than in 
Arkansas (14.1%) or Kentucky (11.4%, p<0.001).  However, changes in health care quality or 
health associated with churning did not differ significantly across states. 
Exhibit 4 compares several measures of health care access for churners with coverage 
gaps and without coverage gaps, both compared to non-churners.  After controlling for 
demographics, health status, current insurance, and state of residence, churners with a coverage 
gap were significantly more likely than non-churners to have changed doctors due to insurance; 
skipped taking prescription medications or delayed necessary care due to cost; had trouble 
paying medical bills; and reported lower quality medical care.  
 
Respondents who churned but without any gap in coverage still experienced challenges 
compared to non-churners: more trouble getting appointments with primary care physicians and 
specialists; more frequent changes in doctors; and higher rates of going to the emergency 
department because they could not obtain an outpatient appointment. They were also more likely 
to report receiving fair or poor quality medical care.  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
  
12 
The ACA has lowered the uninsured rate to a historic low.  However, our study of 
insurance dynamics since the ACA’s coverage expansion provides important new evidence that 
the negative impact of churning remains a significant challenge for many Americans in the post-
health reform landscape.  In our 2015 survey of over 3,000 adults in three states, we found that 
one in four low-income adults was affected by a change in coverage in the prior 12 months.  
Although these numbers are lower than pre-ACA projections, they are still substantial, and they 
were not reduced by the private option model in Arkansas.  
Of those changing coverage in these three states, approximately 20% were uninsured 
individuals who gained coverage.  For the remainder – both those who lost coverage and those 
who changed insurance plans with no gap in coverage – churning was problematic, forcing 
changes in doctors, disruptions in prescription medication treatment, and perceived negative 
effects on quality of care and health.  
These results are consistent with pre-ACA evidence that insurance changes and switching 
clinicians can erode perceived health care quality.3,23  But to our knowledge, our study is the first 
to examine the adverse impacts of churning since the ACA’s coverage expansions took effect.  
Moreover, our analysis adds nuance to prior research by distinguishing between churners who 
had gaps in coverage and churners without gaps.  While those with gaps experienced the worst 
outcomes, even among churners without a gap in coverage, nearly 15% had to change providers, 
20% skipped medications, and roughly 30% reported an overall harmful effect on their health 
care quality.  Our findings suggest that in addition to reducing gaps in coverage, policymakers 
must also improve transitions in coverage in order to address the potential harms of churning. 
While churning itself is clearly problematic for health care continuity, overall rates of 
churning in our sample were much lower than many pre-ACA analyses predicted.  For instance, 
  
13 
one study projected that within 12 months as many as half of all Marketplace and Medicaid 
beneficiaries could experience a coverage change under the ACA.9  Our numbers – roughly 25% 
churning at one year – are substantially lower.  In part, this reflects a different study sample, as 
previously-published projections were specific to Marketplace and Medicaid beneficiaries, 
whereas our sample contains all coverage types among low-income individuals.  While 
Marketplace beneficiaries in our sample did experience higher rates of churning on average, we 
found that churning rates in Medicaid were actually lower than in other kinds of coverage, 
including employer-sponsored insurance.   
Another possible explanation is that pre-ACA projections typically assumed that monthly 
fluctuations in income would be reported promptly and acted upon by states as required by 
law,8,9 but in practice, individuals may not report such changes and states may be slow to 
respond.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also gave states the option of 
delaying the annual eligibility redetermination process in Medicaid for 2014, and more than 2/3 
of states chose to do so.24  Both factors blunt the potential for frequent income-based churning, 
which was not the main cause for coverage switching in our sample.  More commonly, churning 
in our study was the result of job-related changes in insurance.  This may also relate to the fact 
that individuals with an affordable offer of ESI are ineligible for Marketplace tax credits, which 
could lead some adults experiencing income increases to move from Medicaid to uninsured 
(after declining an ESI offer) rather than to Marketplace coverage.10 
Overall, we find that churning rates for low-income adults were less than expected in 
many pre-ACA estimates, and the majority of coverage changes were of a different nature than 
the Medicaid-to-Marketplace churning that was the focus much of the research prior to 2014 (for 
instance, ESI changes and plan switching within the Marketplace).  This pattern is consistent 
  
14 
with administrative data from seven states, which showed modest churning between Medicaid 
and Marketplace coverage in 2014 ranging from 2% to 13%.25 
Nonetheless, even at an annual rate of 25%, churning affected a substantial portion of our 
sample and was strongly associated with adverse consequences.  Moreover, in addition to the 
adverse effects on consumers identified in our survey, churning has other potential impacts 
including higher administrative costs for states and plans, difficulty measuring plan quality for 
members who leave mid-year, and reduced incentives for plans to make long-term investments in 
beneficiaries’ health.10 
Thus, our findings raise important policy challenges.  Much of the current debate about 
health reform has focused on the enrollment process for Medicaid and Marketplace coverage, 
with less attention on transitions in coverage.  Some states, however, have sought to address this 
issue.  Arkansas implemented a plan that supporters hoped would reduce the frequency of 
churning.  In theory, the private option allows for income changes that do not disrupt coverage; 
enrollees could keep their health plans and their doctors, while only premiums would change.  
However, we found no evidence that churning rates among low-income individuals were lower 
under the private option compared to Kentucky’s traditional Medicaid expansion.  
Given predictions that the private option would reduce churning dramatically,12 how can 
we explain our findings?  In part, this reflects the multifaceted nature of coverage changes in 
these states.  Marketplace-to-Medicaid transitions (and vice versa) were only a portion of the 
frequent coverage changes we observed.  The gain or loss of ESI, switches between private 
plans, and renewal difficulties in Medicaid all played varying roles in the different states. 
More specifically in terms of the private option model, some evidence points to 
Arkansas’s renewal process as a large contributor.  In mid-2015, the state imposed a 10-day 
  
15 
response window for private option beneficiaries to provide proper documentation of eligibility, 
and failure to respond resulted in a termination of insurance benefits.  As a result of this policy, 
almost 50,000 Arkansans were dropped from coverage.26  Furthermore, only one of the three 
original issuers from 2014 remained in the Arkansas Marketplace in 2015 (along with three new 
entrants in 2015), which is consistent with our finding that Arkansas respondents were the most 
likely of the three states to report churning because their old plan was no longer available.27 
  Turnover in Marketplace offerings has been a challenge in other states as well.  In 
Texas, only four of twelve issuers from 2014 to 2015 returned, and there were ten new entrants 
in 2015.27  Meanwhile, Kentucky currently faces similar challenges: in October 2015, Kentucky 
Health Cooperative (the state’s Marketplace Co-op) announced that it would cease operations by 
the end of the year.28  Whether Marketplace offerings will become more stable as the law 
matures is an open question.   
However, even with stable offerings, plan switching within the Marketplace may be 
frequent.  To capitalize on competition between plans and to encourage insurers to improve 
quality and/or reduce costs, frequent plan switching may be an essential component of a well-
functioning market.  In fact, the Obama administration has encouraged Marketplace beneficiaries 
to aggressively shop during open enrollment and consider changing coverage each year.  Thus, 
some annual plan switching may be inevitable under the ACA.     
In this context, what policy options remain available to decrease the incidence of 
churning or its adverse consequences?  The notion of 12-month continuous eligibility in 
Medicaid, which has been part of the generally successful national effort to improve retention 
rates for children,29 has only recently become a state option for adults in Medicaid via 
accelerated federal waiver.  To date, only New York has adopted this approach.  The 
  
16 
introduction of a Basic Health Program may also reduce churning somewhat by moving the 
transition point between Medicaid and Marketplace coverage from 138% to 200% of FPL, 
though there is no evidence to date other than pre-ACA projections,30 suggesting the need for 
additional research to evaluate this approach. 
The other set of policy options focuses less on reducing coverage changes and more on 
reducing the negative impacts of these changes.  In this regard, we did find some evidence that 
either form of expansion – Medicaid or private option – is preferable to non-expansion in terms 
of the likelihood of changing providers.  Adults in Texas were nearly three times more likely to 
have to switch providers after churning than were their counterparts in Arkansas and Kentucky; 
likely some of this is a direct effect of Medicaid expansion.  Simply put, coverage expansion is 
an important tool for reducing the harms of churning by shifting the distribution away from 
churning with a coverage gap towards the less harmful (though still problematic) churning 
without a gap.  
Another promising policy option to mitigate the impact of churning is the use of 
multimarket plans, which can enable individuals to keep the same provider network and benefit 
design as they move between Medicaid and Marketplace coverage.  One 2016 estimate is that 
40% of all insurers offering Marketplace plans also offer a Medicaid managed care plan in the 
same state, and 36 states had at least one such “overlap” insurer.31  Encouraging insurers in other 
states to follow suit could improve continuity of care. 
However, this only addresses Medicaid-Marketplace churning.  Continuity of care across 
other coverage transitions requires broader action, such as New York’s law requiring up to 60 
days of coverage for treatment after a change in insurance plans and 90 days after a change in 
  
17 
provider networks for patients with serious conditions or pregnancy.  Extending this sort of 
approach nationally could provide an important safeguard for patients. 
In conclusion, churning rates in the three states we studied do not appear to be as high as 
initially feared under the ACA, but still affect approximately one quarter of the population 
annually.  These changes in coverage are clearly problematic for access to care, continuity of 
care and quality.  As the coverage expansions under the ACA take hold, ongoing attention from 
policymakers and researchers will be needed to ensure that the law’s impressive insurance gains 
are not substantially compromised for many by gaps in coverage and disruptions in care over 
time.

SOURCE: Authors’ analysis of data from a telephone survey of 475 adults ages 19-64 with family incomes below 
138% of the federal poverty level who reported a coverage change in 2015, excluding those who went from 
uninsured to insured.  We also excluded 18 respondents who reported a coverage change but did not answer whether 
they had a gap or not. 
NOTES: All estimates exclude item non-response.   
* These subtotals do not sum to the overall heading “had to change doctor(s) because of insurance,” since some 
individuals reporting such a change chose not to answer the follow-up question.
