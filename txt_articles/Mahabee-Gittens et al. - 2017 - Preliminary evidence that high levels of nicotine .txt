Abstract
Background—Dust and surfaces are important sources of lead and pesticide exposure in young 
children. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate if third-hand smoke (THS) pollutants 
accumulate on the hands of children who live in environments where tobacco is used and if hand 
nicotine levels are associated with second-hand smoke (SHS), as measured by salivary cotinine.
Methods—Participants were parents and children (n=25; age mean (SD)=5.4 (5.3) years) 
presenting to the emergency department with a potentially SHS-related illness. A convenience 
sample of participants were recruited at baseline from an ongoing two-group, randomised 
controlled trial of a SHS reduction and tobacco cessation intervention. Parents were current 
smokers; thus, all children were at risk of SHS and THS exposure to varying extents. Primary 
outcome measures, which were assessed in child participants only, were hand nicotine and salivary 
cotinine. Parents reported sociodemographics and smoking patterns; children’s medical records 
were abstracted for chief complaint, medical history and discharge diagnosis.
Results—All children had detectable hand nicotine (range=18.3–690.9 ng/wipe). All but one had 
detectable cotinine (range=1.2–28.8 ng/mL). Multiple linear regression results showed a 
significant positive association between hand nicotine and cotinine (p=0.009; semipartial r2=0.24), 
independent of child age.

 Discussion—The higher-than-expected nicotine levels and significant association with cotinine 
indicate that THS may play a role in the overall exposure of young children to tobacco smoke 
toxicants and that hand wipes could be a useful marker of overall tobacco smoke pollution and a 
proxy for exposure.
INTRODUCTION
House dust and surfaces are important exposure sources of environmental toxicants (eg, 
pesticides and lead) in young children because of age-associated behaviours and interactions 
with their environment (eg, hand-to-mouth behaviours and close physical contact with 
parents).1 Research shows the persistent residue from second-hand smoke (SHS) 
accumulates in dust, in objects, on home surfaces and on smokers’ skin and clothes.2 
Commonly referred to as third-hand smoke (THS), non-smokers may be exposed to 
toxicants (eg, tobacco specific nitrosamine)3 via inhalation, ingestion and dermal uptake 
transferred from indoor deposits and parents. Matt et al245 and Quintana et al6 found that 
nicotine levels on hands differentiate non-smokers from smokers, and among non-smokers, 
these are associated with nicotine on home surfaces and in dust. On non-smokers’ hands, 
nicotine can serve as a proxy of THS pollution in an individual’s immediate environment, as 
well as a proximate and immediate cause of nicotine exposure.4 In addition, cotinine is the 
major metabolite of nicotine and a biomarker of SHS and THS exposure in non-smokers.7
The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate if THS pollutants accumulate on the hands 
of ill children who live in environments where tobacco is used and to describe any 
associated clinical characteristics. We compared THS levels on children’s hands with those 
found in other populations and examined the association between THS levels and the 
biological exposure to tobacco smoke, as measured with salivary cotinine, to determine if 
the nicotine on children’s hands may serve as a proxy measure of overall tobacco smoke 
(OTS; defined as SHS and THS combined) exposure from children’s environments.
METHODS
A convenience sample of participants were recruited at baseline from an ongoing two-group, 
randomised controlled trial of SHS reduction and tobacco cessation intervention for 
caregivers who smoke, registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02531594). Paediatric 
patients (n=25) presenting to the emergency department between April and September 2016 
of a tertiary care children’s hospital in the USA with a potentially SHS-related illness (eg, 
rhinorrhoea and difficulty breathing) were potentially eligible. All children were at risk of 
varying smoke exposure. Institutional Review Board parental consent and child assent were 
obtained. The children provided a saliva sample to obtain cotinine levels. The palm and the 
volar aspect (ie, palmar surface) of all fingers of their dominant hand were wiped by trained 
research staff and analysed for nicotine; field blanks were collected to adjust for potential 
contamination of wipe samples (range 0.41–0.48 ng/wipe).6 Parents reported 
sociodemographics, smoking patterns and household characteristics; children’s medical 
records were abstracted for chief complaint, medical history and discharge diagnosis.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
We calculated geometric means (GeoMs), CIs, medians (Mdn) and IQRs. We conducted 
linear regression analyses to examine associations between salivary cotinine and hand 
nicotine (both log-transformed), sociodemographics, smoking behaviours, household 
characteristics and clinical findings. The alpha level of significance was set at 0.05 (two-
tailed).
RESULTS
See table 1 for descriptive information about the sample. All but one child had detectable 
cotinine (Level of Detection, LOD=1.0 ng/mL) with the range of 1.2–28.8 ng/mL 
(GeoM=5.2 ng/mL, 95% CI 95% 3.5 to 7.6, Mdn=5.3 ng/mL, IQR=2.3–9.1). The cotinine 
value below LOD was recoded to 0.50 ng/mL (ie, one-half the LOD) and included in all 
analyses. All children had detectable nicotine on their hands (LOD=0.05 ng nicotine), with 
the range of 18.26–690.94 ng/wipe (GeoM=86.4 ng/wipe, 95% CI (61.0 to 122.2), 
Mdn=91.6 ng/wipe, IQR=57.2–121.6).
To be eligible for the study, children had to have an SHS-related complaint. Over half (52%) 
had a medical history or discharge diagnosis of asthma or bronchiolitis. Of note, the child 
with the highest nicotine level was 2 years old and had a chief complaint of difficulty 
breathing and a discharge diagnosis of asthma. There were no statistically significant 
associations between sociodemographics, smoking behaviour and household or clinical 
characteristics. Bivariate associations showed a positive correlation between cotinine and 
hand nicotine (r=0.473, p=0.017). We found a negative association between cotinine and age 
(r=−0.334, p=0.103) and no association between hand nicotine and age (r=0.047, p=0.823). 
When combined in a multiple linear regression model (R2=0.35, F (2, 22)=5.93, p=0.009), 
hand nicotine showed an independent significant positive association with cotinine 
(p=0.009; semipartial r2=0.24), and age showed a marginally significant independent 
negative association with cotinine (p=0.0502; semipartial r2=0.13). There was no significant 
moderator effect of age. In combination, these findings show that, independent of age, 
higher levels of hand nicotine were associated with higher levels of cotinine. Moreover, 
independent of hand nicotine, younger children had higher levels of cotinine. Reported 
smoking behaviour was not correlated with nicotine or cotinine.
DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that children carry tobacco smoke toxicants on their hands, even when 
nobody around them is smoking. Thus, nicotine and other THS compounds on children’s 
hands may contribute to OTS, independent of SHS. Moreover, nicotine on children’s hands 
may serve as a proxy of tobacco smoke pollution in their immediate environment. We found 
that non-smoking children whose parents smoke had higher-than-expected levels of nicotine 
on their hands. Specifically, the GeoM of 86.4 ng/wipe was over three times higher than the 
levels of 25.6 ng/wipe in previous research on non-smoking adults living with active 
smokers.4 In other research in which finger wipes of adults were analysed, we have reported 
GeoMs of 5.2 ng/wipe among non-smokers moving into an apartment formerly occupied by

 a smoker5 and 630–650 ng/wipe among active smokers.25 Because nicotine is specific to 
tobacco, its presence on children’s hands may serve as a proxy of tobacco smoke pollution 
in their immediate environment. This finding suggests that OTS may occur through a 
combination of SHS and THS exposure via multiple pathways; thus, a comprehensive 
assessment of OTS needs to include assessments of both SHS and THS exposure. Hand 
wipes may also be useful in the clinical setting, as these may provide a relatively unobtrusive 
test of OTS pollution and exposure. However, more research is needed to assess the 
reliability and validity of such a test and if hand wipe analyses can be conducted in a cost-
effective and timely enough manner that would improve clinical care of patients exposed to 
smoke.
All children had potentially SHS-related complaints, and many had a discharge diagnosis or 
history of asthma or bronchiolitis. While causal associations cannot be made between hand 
nicotine levels and clinical findings, these results warrant further examination, given that 
recent work demonstrates the association of THS exposure and respiratory symptoms in 
exposed children.8 Although unexamined, there is concern that THS may be more toxic than 
SHS, given that THS includes novel pollutants not found in SHS, has multiple exposure 
routes and has a much longer duration of exposure.9–12
The positive partial association between nicotine and cotinine indicates that, independent of 
age, hand nicotine can serve as a marker of OTS. The exposure may be through SHS or THS 
that accumulated in dust, on objects and on surfaces of the children’s environments. The 
negative partial association between age and cotinine indicates that, independent of nicotine, 
younger children show higher exposure to tobacco smoke. This finding supports the 
hypothesis that younger children interact with their environment in ways that increase the 
uptake of THS pollutants. This may be because younger children receive higher doses of 
THS (ie, more pica behaviour) or higher doses of SHS (ie, limited opportunities to leave 
smoking areas).
Since hand nicotine may have its origins in SHS and THS and because of its significant 
association with systemic biological exposure to tobacco smoke pollutants as measured by 
cotinine, our findings support the use of hand nicotine as a marker of OTS pollution in 
children’s environments. Because SHS and THS are composed of constituents that cause 
many different adverse health effects,10–13 these findings support additional epidemiological 
and experimental studies.
This study has limitations, including the inability to measure SHS independent of THS 
pollution or to distinguish how THS and SHS independently contribute to OTS exposure. 
Thus, hand nicotine may be a direct consequence and proxy of SHS exposure or contracted 
through interaction with THS pollutants in a child’s environment without SHS exposure.1415 
In either case, nicotine on a child’s hands is prima facie evidence of OTS in the child’s 
environment and a source of THS exposure. However, independent measures of SHS and 
THS exposure are needed. Furthermore, the results from this small sample size warrant 
replications in larger samples taken from similar and different child populations to assess if 
our findings can be confirmed or may be moderated by characteristics of the child (eg, age) 
or his/her environment (eg, THS reservoirs at home). Another limitation is that we may have

 found higher-than-expected nicotine levels, because we wiped the insides of children’s entire 
hands (ie, palm and volar aspect of fingers). Our ongoing research now includes hand 
surface area measurements so that we can compare new findings with our previous work.16
Limitations notwithstanding, the presence of nicotine on children’s hands and the 
association between hand nicotine and salivary cotinine makes it plausible that OTS in 
children is not limited to airborne pollutants (ie, SHS) but should include THS pollutants in 
children’s entire physical environment. Future work should differentiate how much SHS and 
THS contribute to OTS, how THS and SHS exposure affect child health and which types of 
prevention interventions are needed to better protect children from OTS.

time.
►
Children had high levels of hand nicotine, higher than that of non-smokers in 
our previous work.
►
The significant association between hand nicotine and salivary cotinine 
suggests that hand nicotine may contribute to overall tobacco smoke 
exposure, independent of SHS, and can serve as a marker of overall tobacco 
smoke exposure.
