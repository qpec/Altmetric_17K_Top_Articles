IMPORTANCE People who immigrate face unique health literacy, communication, and system
navigation challenges, and they may have diverse preferences that influence end-of-life care.
OBJECTIVE To examine end-of-life care provided to immigrants to Canada in the last
6 months of their life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study (April 1, 2004, to
March 31, 2015) included 967 013 decedents in Ontario, Canada, using validated linkages
between health and immigration databases to identify immigrant (since 1985) and
long-standing resident cohorts.
EXPOSURES All decedents who immigrated to Canada between 1985 and 2015 were
classified as recent immigrants, with subgroup analyses assessing the association of time
since immigration, and region of birth, with end-of-life care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Location of death and intensity of care received in the last
6 months of life. Analysis included modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating
equations, adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic position, causes of death, urban and rural
residence, and preexisting comorbidities.
RESULTS Among 967 013 decedents of whom 47 514 (5%) immigrated since 1985, sex,
socioeconomic status, urban (vs rural) residence, and causes of death were similar, while
long-standing residents were older than immigrant decedents (median [interquartile range]
age, 75 [58-84] vs 80 [68-87] years). Recent immigrant decedents were overall more likely
to die in intensive care (15.6% vs 10.0%; difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 5.2%-5.9%) after adjusting
for differences in age, sex, income, geography, and cause of death (relative risk, 1.30; 95% CI,
1.27-1.32). In their last 6 months of life, recent immigrant decedents experienced more
intensive care admissions (24.9% vs 19.2%; difference, 5.7%; 95% CI, 5.3%-6.1%), hospital
admissions (72.1% vs 68.2%; difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, 3.5%-4.3%), mechanical ventilation
(21.5% vs 13.6%; difference, 7.9%; 95% CI, 7.5%-8.3%), dialysis (5.5% vs 3.4%; difference,
2.1%; 95% CI, 1.9%-2.3%), percutaneous feeding tube placement (5.5% vs 3.0%; difference,
2.5%; 95% CI, 2.3%-2.8%), and tracheostomy (2.3% vs 1.1%; difference, 1.2%; 95% CI,
1.1%-1.4%). Relative risk of dying in intensive care for recent immigrants compared with
long-standing residents varied according to recent immigrant region of birth from 0.84 (95%
CI, 0.74-0.95) among those born in Northern and Western Europe to 1.96 (95% CI, 1.89-2.05)
among those born in South Asia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among decedents in Ontario, Canada, recent immigrants
were significantly more likely to receive aggressive care and to die in an intensive care unit
compared with other residents. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms
behind this association.

 O
ptimal end-of-life care combines best medical therapy
and symptom control in accordance with patient
wishes.1 Many patients receive aggressive in-
hospital end-of-life care despite a preference for dying in a fa-
miliar setting, free from invasive technology.2 This discrep-
ancyhasmanycontributors,includinginadequateadvancecare
planning,suboptimalcommunicationbetweenhealthcarepro-
fessionals and patients or their families, poor health literacy,
uncertainty about imminence of death, and unavailability of
nonintensive end-of-life or palliative care resources.3,4
Canada has high rates of immigration relative to many
high-income nations, which in turn leads to a diversity of
geographic, cultural, and racial/ethnic backgrounds among
its residents.5 In 2011 (midway through this study), Ontario,
Canada, had a population of 12 851 821, of whom 3 611 365
(29%) were born in other countries and 501 060 (4%) arrived
in Canada between 2006 and 2011.6 Immigrants often face
challenges in communication, health literacy, and navigation
of the health care system.7-9 Although immigrants are on
average healthier than age-matched Canadians when they
arrive in Canada, they subsequently experience excess
morbidity and mortality from chronic medical and psychiat-
ric conditions.7
Preliminary evidence suggests that some immigrants may
face cultural and logistical challenges in end-of-life care due
todecreasedhealthliteracyorlanguageability,differentmodes
of family-based decision-making and filial responsibility, and
decreased access to care due to insufficient financial and so-
cial resources.10-15 Some immigrants may have different end-
of-life care preferences than many long-standing residents.15
To our knowledge, there are no comprehensive large-scale
quantitative studies of end-of-life care in recent immigrant
populations. This population-based analysis was conducted
to describe end-of-life care delivered to recently immigrated
compared with long-standing resident decedents, including
magnitude of and factors associated with differences in end-
of-life care.
Methods
Study Setting and Oversight
The study was approved by the research ethics board of Sun-
nybrook Health Sciences Centre including a waiver for indi-
vidual patient consent because the data sets were linked using
unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at the Institute for
Clinical Evaluative Sciences.
Identification of Decedents (Study Participants)
All individuals (recent immigrants and long-standing resi-
dents) who died in Ontario between April 1, 2004, and March
31, 2015, were identified. Individuals with fewer than 6
months of enrollment in the provincial health care plan were
excluded. Data on individuals who received care in Ontario
but died in another country or province were not available.
Patients with some missing baseline data were included in
unadjusted analyses but not in adjusted analyses requiring a
missing variable.
Recent immigrants were identified within the data set
through previously validated combined probabilistic and
deterministic linkage of the list of deceased individuals to the
registry of landed immigrants maintained by Immigration,
Refugees and Citizenship Canada.16 Deterministic linkage
occurs when 1 or more identifiers (eg, health card number
and name) are identical, while probabilistic linkage uses
probability scores to identify linkages among records where
deterministic linkages were not possible. Recent immigrants
were defined as those granted permanent residency or citi-
zenship status in Canada between 1985 and 2015 (the years
available in the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
Canada data) and created subgroups according to duration
since immigration. All other residents were defined as long-
standing residents. Other research has reserved the term
recent for immigrants arriving within shorter timeframes, but
this broader definition sought to include all available data
and acknowledge that some members of the long-standing
resident cohort may also be immigrants but have lived in
Canada for more than 30 years. Immigration, Refugees and
Citizenship Canada data also included information obtained
at the time of immigration application on immigration class
(economic, family, refugee, and other), education level, lan-
guage ability, and country of birth. Information on the level
of health literacy, religion, and specific cultural practices was
not available.
Identification of Health Care Use Prior to Death
A combination of health administrative databases linked at
the individual level were used to describe health care service
use at the population level in Ontario. These included the
Registered Persons Database containing vital statistics on all
persons issued a Provincial Health Card, the Ontario Health
Insurance Plan containing data on all professional services
and procedures resulting in charges to the health care sys-
tem, the Office of the Registrar General for Deaths, the Dis-
charge Abstract Database containing detailed patient-level
information including resources used and procedures per-
formed for all inpatients, and the National Ambulatory Care
Key Points
Question Do recent immigrant patients experience different
end-of-life care than long-standing resident patients?
Findings In this cohort study that included 967 013 patients,
recent immigrant patients were more likely to be in the intensive
care unit when they died and were more likely to receive invasive
procedures in the last 6 months of life including hospital
admission, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation,
tracheostomy, dialysis, or percutaneous feeding tube placement.
These outcomes varied most significantly according to region of
origin rather than socioeconomic position, language ability on
arrival, or education level on arrival.
Meaning Among decedents in Ontario, Canada, recent
immigrants were significantly more likely to receive aggressive
care and to die in an intensive care unit compared with other
residents. Further research is needed to understand the
mechanisms behind this association.

 Reporting System for similar data among ambulatory hospital
admissions and emergency department presentations.17,18
Although these databases do not include care provided at
community health centers (frequented by some recent immi-
grants, but overall reaching less than 1% of the population),
the databases contain comprehensive coverage of care pro-
vided in hospitals.19
Characteristics of Patients
Patient characteristics and demographics are reported includ-
ing age, sex, socioeconomic position based on postal code cen-
sus data, and place of residence at time of death. Data are re-
ported on intensive care admissions, chronic conditions
including the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Deyo modifica-
tion), hospitalizations, procedures, and emergency depart-
ment visits during the final 24 months of life, with emphasis
on the final 6 months. The database does not contain specific
information on do-not-resuscitate orders, advanced care plan-
ning, or overall goals of care but captures the consequences
of these decisions with respect to health care delivery.
Outcomes
The primary outcome described end-of-life care according to
location of death: intensive care unit, acute care hospital, long-
term care facility (or nursing home), and other (including hos-
pice or home). The results are described in terms of relative
risk (RR), which in this case refers to the ratio of proportions
of recent immigrant compared with long-standing resident de-
cedents that experienced a given outcome. Secondary out-
comes assessed whether a patient experienced intensive or in-
vasive interventions in the last 6 months of life including
hospital admission, intensive care admission, mechanical ven-
tilation, dialysis, percutaneous gastric/gastrojejunal tube, or
tracheostomy. Other secondary outcomes included emer-
gency department, hospital, and intensive care use in the last
6 months of life.
Subgroup Analyses
Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed according to
patient demographics (age, sex, urban or rural place of resi-
dence, and socioeconomic position), comorbidity (specific di-
agnostic categories and Charlson Comorbidity Index), and re-
cent immigrant characteristics (immigration class, language
ability on arrival, education level on arrival, time since immi-
gration, and region of birth) (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Recent immigrant and long-standing resident end-of-life care
was compared using χ2 testing for categorical outcomes
(location of death and proportion receiving invasive interven-
tions) and rates (emergency department presentation, hospi-
tal admission, and intensive care admission), Mann-Whitney
tests for comparisons of median duration of stay (hospital and
intensive care admissions) and number of episodes (hospital
and intensive care admissions and emergency department vis-
its), and t tests for comparisons of mean duration (hospital and
intensive care unit admissions).
Separate modified Poisson regression analyses of
location of death (intensive care unit, acute care hospital,
long-term care facility, or other including home) were con-
ducted among recent immigrants compared with long-
standing resident decedents to estimate RRs.20 We also per-
formed separate modified Poisson regression analyses of
type of invasive care received in the last 6 months including
hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, mechani-
cal ventilation, dialysis, percutaneous feeding tube place-
ment, and tracheostomy. All analyses adjusted for potential
confounders of age, sex, income quintile, urban-rural resi-
dence, and cause of death. To account for the correlation of
outcomes among patients residing within the same geo-
graphic area, the analysis implemented generalized estimat-
ing equations using an exchangeable correlation structure,
clustering by postal code.20 Recent immigrants were sepa-
rately analyzed according to region of birth, years in Ontario,
language ability on arrival, education level on arrival, and
immigration class while adjusting for the same covariates as
above. Two-sided P values less than .05 were considered sig-
nificant but were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Analyses were performed with SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1
(SAS Institute) and R 3.2.2 software (R Foundation). Details
of the analysis protocol, regional definitions, causes of
death, and further analyses assessing robustness across mul-
tiple fixed intervals preceding death can be found in eAp-
pendix 1 in the Supplement.
Results
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
A total of 967 013 decedents were analyzed, of whom 47 514
(5%) immigrated since 1985. Recent immigrant decedents
originated from diverse global regions (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). The median age at death was 79 years, with
ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, and dementia being
the most common causes of death. Compared with long-
standing resident decedents, recent immigrant decedents
tended to be younger and more likely to live in an urban area
and of lower socioeconomic position (Table 1). The median
duration in Canada for recent immigrants was 16 years.
End-of-Life Care
Of the 967 013 decedents, 434 783 (45%) died in the hospital
including 99 680 (10%) who died in intensive care. Com-
pared with long-standing resident decedents, a higher pro-
portion of recent immigrant decedents died in intensive
care (15.6% vs 10.0%; difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 5.2%-5.9%)
(Table 2). This increase persisted after adjusting for differ-
ences in age, sex, income, geography, and cause of death
(Table 3) (adjusted RR of dying in intensive care comparing
recent immigrant with long-standing resident decedents:
1.30; 95% CI, 1.27-1.32; Table 2).
In their last 6 months of life, recent immigrant decedents
experienced more intensive care admissions (24.9% vs
19.2%; difference, 5.7%; 95% CI, 5.3%-6.1%), hospital admis-
sions (72.1% vs 68.2%; difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, 3.5%-4.3%),

 mechanical ventilation (21.5% vs 13.6%; difference, 7.9%;
95% CI, 7.5%-8.3%), dialysis (5.5% vs 3.4%; difference, 2.1%;
95% CI, 1.9%-2.3%), percutaneous feeding tube placement
(5.5% vs 3.0%; difference, 2.5%; 95% CI, 2.3%-2.8%), and tra-
cheostomy (2.3% vs 1.1%; difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-
1.4%) , even after adjusting for potential confounders (Table 2
and eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement). These
increases persisted across various fixed intervals preceding
death (1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months) (eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement).
Subgroup Analyses
Our finding that recent immigrant decedents were more likely
to die in intensive care was consistent across diverse sub-
groups including older age at death, sex, socioeconomic sta-
tus, place of residence, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score
(Figure 1). The association persisted across different condi-
tions including colorectal cancer (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-
1.57), diabetes (RR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.74-2.28), cerebrovascular
disease (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.98-2.28), and dementia (RR, 3.69;
95% CI, 2.66-5.13).
The RR of death in intensive care comparing recent
immigrant and long-standing resident decedents was highest
among patients older than 80 years, female patients, and
patients with a lower comorbidity index (Figure 1). There was
substantial variation in end-of-life care according to region of
birth and time since immigration (Figure 2). The RR of dying
in intensive care (using the overall long-standing resident risk

 of dying in intensive care as baseline) ranged from 0.84 (95%
CI, 0.74-0.95) among decedents born in northern and west-
ern Europe to 1.78 (95% CI, 1.66-1.92) among decedents born
in western and central Asia, 1.84 (95% CI, 1.70-2.00) among
decedents born in Africa, and 1.96 (95% CI, 1.89-2.05) among
decedents born in South Asia (eFigure 2 in Supplement).
After adjustment for age and other covariates in the recent
immigrant population, the increased RR of dying in intensive
care persisted among recent immigrant decedents from
East Asia, Central America and Mexico, South America,
Africa, western and central Asia, Southeast Asia, and South
Asia. All other regions, including Northern and Western
Europe, did not show statistically significant differences
from Northern America (eTable 6 in Supplement). Differ-
ences were associated with time in Canada, with an RR of
dying in intensive care of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.36-1.48) among
those who immigrated 21 to 30 years before death and an RR
of 2.03 (95% CI, 1.80-2.29) seen in those who immigrated
fewer than 2 years before death. In adjusted analyses, the
increased RR of dying in intensive care seen among recent
immigrant decedents who immigrated 2 or fewer years
before death remained statistically significant relative to
recent immigrant decedents who immigrated more than 10
years before death, but the differences between those who
immigrated 2 or fewer years before death and those who
immigrated between 3 and 10 years before death were no
longer statistically significant (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
There were no significant differences in the adjusted analysis
according to immigration class, language ability on arrival,
socioeconomic position, or education level on arrival.
Sensitivity Analyses
The primary analysis does not include recent immigrant
decedents who left Ontario before death. However, for the

grant decedents dying in intensive care to overlap with the

recent immigrants (36%) would have had to leave Ontario and
then die outside of an intensive care unit (eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement).
A total of 14 758 decedents were excluded owing to fewer
than 6 months of health care enrollment, of whom 458 (3%)
were recent immigrants. The prevalence of missing data was
highest in the Charlson Comorbidity Index score data be-
cause of a subset of patients who were never hospitalized, but
otherwise the proportion of missing data was small (eTable 7
in Supplement).
Other sensitivity analyses assessed the difference
between recent immigrants identified through deterministic
as opposed to probabilistic matching. Of the 47 514 re-
cent immigrant decedents identified, 37 046 (78%) were
identified with deterministic linking and 10 468 (22%) were
identified with probabilistic linking (eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment). The 2 cohorts of recent immigrants were similar with
respect to baseline characteristics, unadjusted primary analy-
sis, and adjusted secondary analyses (eTables 3, 9, 10, and 11
in the Supplement).
Discussion
Among decedents in Ontario, recent immigrants were sig-
nificantly more likely to receive aggressive care and to die in
an intensive care unit than long-standing residents. In the
last 6 months of life, recent immigrant decedents were more
likely to experience intensive care unit admission, hospital
admission, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, percutaneous
feeding tube placement, and tracheostomy. These increased
rates of aggressive care varied substantially according to
region of birth, attenuated with time in Canada, and were

This study is a large-scale population-level quantitative
analysis of end-of-life care provided to patients who have re-
cently immigrated, using comprehensive data on hospital care
as a consequence of universal health insurance. The data show
extensive global region variation, with recent immigrants from
Northern and Western Europe experiencing less-aggressive
end-of-life care than long-standing residents, while those
from Africa, South Asia, or Southeast Asia experienced the
most-aggressive end-of-life care relative to long-standing resi-
dents. Qualitative research conducted in multiple cultural set-
tings corroborates the finding that differences in end-of-life
care provided to recent immigrants may be associated with re-
gion of origin.21-25 Within Europe and Asia, variations in the
rate of organ-supporting care at the end of life are signifi-
cantly associated with both region and the culture or religion
of patients and physicians.26,27 The results agree with quan-
titative research conducted in racial/ethnic minority groups in
the United States.21,22,24,25,28,29 The differences in end-of-life
care delivery may also attenuate with time since immigra-
tion, consistent with other research describing acculturation
and end-of-life care.30
The variation in end-of-life care based on region of
birth has multiple potential explanations, including patient
preferences, cultural differences, clinician behavior, end-
of-life care decision processes, or differences in service
accessibility.10,31 If recent immigrants live in social and geo-
graphiccommunitiesrelatingtotheirregionofbirth,thiscould
lead to differential palliative care service availability for
certain groups.32 Clinicians may conduct end-of-life care
discussions in different ways, or less commonly, based on

diagnostic categories suggests the possibility of residual con-
founding due to clustering of disease processes and immigra-
tion status, although the associations with more-aggressive
care persist after adjustment for category of cause of death.
Many recent immigrant patients and families may be more fa-
miliar with clinician-directed or family and community–
based models of medical decision-making, leading to differ-
ent outcomes in an environment where patient preferences or
sharedpatient-cliniciandecision-makingguideend-of-lifecare

plainedbydifferencesinhealthliteracyorlanguageabilitythat
could promote more aggressive end-of-life care through de-
layed clinical presentations, incomplete understanding of
medical situations, or even decreased trust of health care
professionals.31,34,35 However, the findings did not appear to
be explained by English proficiency, level of education, socio-
economic position, nor place of residence at time of death.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The most important limi-
tation is that the recent immigrant and long-standing resi-
dent cohorts differed significantly in terms of age, socioeco-
nomic status, and geography, which leaves the possibility of
residual confounding.36 However, comprehensive coverage of

Forest plot analogous to Figure 1 depicting the ratio of the proportions of
decedents dying in intensive care units comparing recent immigrant with
long-standing resident cohorts (relative risk). In contrast to Figure 1, this figure
focuses on subgroups defined only among the recent immigrant cohort
including region of origin, language ability on arrival, education level on arrival,
immigration class, and time since immigration. The proportion of recent
immigrant decedents dying in intensive care within each subgroup is compared
with the proportion of long-standing resident decedents dying in intensive care
(92 270 of 919 499 [10%]), and so a relative risk greater than 1 corresponds to
an increased relative risk of recent immigrant compared with long-standing
resident decedents being in the intensive care unit at death. Note that
percentages are based on the size of each subgroup by row, not based on the
overall analytic sample size for recent immigrant decedents of 47 514. The size
of each square is proportional to the precision of the relative risk estimate.
a The denominator data for the percentages are the total numbers of recent
immigrant decedents in each subgroup, ie, the corresponding cells in eTable 3
in the Supplement.

 confounding should be greatly reduced. Another limitation is
that different diseases have different terminal time courses,
while the design analyzed fixed intervals preceding death;
therefore, some aspects of end-of-life care may have been
missed or some care prior to end of life may have been
included.37 Health administrative databases are also limited
in terms of risk adjustment by disease severity; however,
decedent analyses involve inherent severity adjustment
through selection of patients who have died. Although data
were captured on all decedents in Ontario, no data were avail-
able about recent immigrants who returned to their country
oforigintodie;however,thesepopulationsarelikelyverysmall
(eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). There were no analyses of
hospital length of stay prior to intensive care unit admission.
There were no data on or analyses of marital status, language
ability for long-standing residents (or language ability more re-
cently than arrival for recent immigrants), education level for
long-standing residents, or goals of care and preferences
for any patients or families.
Conclusions
Among decedents in Ontario, recent immigrants were signifi-
cantly more likely to receive aggressive care and to die in
an intensive care unit compared with other residents. Fur-
ther research is needed to understand the mechanisms be-
hind this association.
