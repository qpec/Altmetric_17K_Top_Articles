IMPORTANCE Prior studies suggest that higher sedentary time is associated with a greater risk
for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the quantitative, dose-response association
between sedentary time and CVD risk is not known.
OBJECTIVE To determine the categorical and quantitative dose-response association
between sedentary time and CVD risk.
DATA SOURCES Two independent investigators searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE
databases for all studies published before July 6, 2015, that evaluated the association
between sedentary time and incident CVD.
STUDY SELECTION Prospective cohort studies with participants 18 years or older that
reported the association between sedentary time and incident CVD were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent investigators performed the data
extraction and collection using a standardized form. The study quality was assessed using the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The categorical dose-response association was evaluated by
comparing the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for incident CVD associated with different levels of
sedentary time (vs lowest sedentary time) across studies. The continuous dose-response
association was assessed using random-effects generalized least squares spline models. Data
were collected from April 5 to July 6, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident CVD (coronary heart disease, including nonfatal
myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality).
RESULTS Nine prospective cohort studies with 720 425 unique participants (57.1% women;
42.9% men; mean age, 54.5 years) and 25 769 unique cardiovascular events and a median
follow-up of 11 years were included. In categorical analyses, compared with the lowest
sedentary time category (median, 2.5 h/d), participants in the highest sedentary time
category (median, 12.5 h/d) had an increased risk for CVD (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19).
However, no apparent risk associated with intermediate levels of sedentary time (HR for
7.5 h/d, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.08) was found. In continuous analyses, a nonlinear association
between sedentary time and incident CVD was found (P for nonlinearity < .001), with an
increased risk observed for more than 10 hours of sedentary time per day (pooled HR, 1.08;
95% CI, 1.00-1.14).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The association between sedentary time and the risk for CVD
is nonlinear with an increased risk only at very high levels. These findings could have
implications for guideline recommendations regarding the risks related to sedentary behavior.

P
hysical inactivity has been identified as 1 of the 4
major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease
(CVD).1 The current guidelines recommend a mini-
mum of 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity or
75 min/wk of vigorous-intensity physical activity in sessions
lasting 10 minutes or more.2 Despite these recommendations
and aggressive public health promotion, less than 4% of
adults (aged 20-59 years) meet these guideline recommenda-
tions for exercise.3,4 Thus, novel preventive approaches
aimed at other modifiable facets of the inactive lifestyle, such
as excess sedentary or sitting time, are needed to reduce the
burden of CVD.
Sedentary time is defined as time spent in activities in-
volving low levels of energy expenditure (1.0-1.5 metabolic
equivalenttasks,suchassitting,watchingtelevision,driving).5
Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that pro-
longed sedentary time is associated with an increased risk for
CVD.6-17 Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the contri-
butionsofprolongedsedentarytimetowardincreasedCVDrisk
appeartobeindependentofthelevelofphysicalactivity.7,12,17,18
However, the quantitative risk for CVD associated with differ-
ent levels of sedentary time, independent of physical activity
and other risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) events, is not
known, and therefore, no consensus recommendations have
been issued regarding limits on the amounts of sedentary time
to optimize CVD prevention. To address this knowledge gap,
we performed a pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies
using a well-established meta-analytical approach19,20 to de-
termine the categorical and quantitative dose-response asso-
ciation between sedentary time and CVD risk, independent of
physical activity. We hypothesized that a dose-dependent as-
sociation exists between sedentary time and the risk for ad-
verse CV events independent of physical activity, particu-
larly at higher levels of sedentary time.
Methods
Literature Search Strategy
We followed the protocol for Meta-analysis of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) for performing and
reporting the present meta-analysis.21 We searched for all
prospective cohort studies that examined the association
between sedentary times and the risk for adverse CV events,
including coronary artery disease, stroke, and CV-related
mortality among adult participants (18 years or older at base-
line). Systematic searches through the electronic databases
(MEDLINE [OVID] and EMBASE [Elsevier Inc]) were per-
formed with assistance from the study librarian (H.M.). Spe-
cial search features, including EMTREE, explosion tech-
nique, and subheadings, were also used. We also performed
additional manual searches through the reference lists of
original publications and review articles. We used various
combinations of the following key words and MeSH terms:
sedentary time, sitting, cardiovascular risk, coronary artery
disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease mortality. The
search was restricted to published English language articles
that focused on human participants.
Study Selection
Prospective cohort studies that reported the association be-
tween baseline sedentary times and the risk for CVD inci-
dence were included. Studies with all types of sedentary ac-
tivity (as assessed by sitting time) were included in the initial
study selection process. Because our primary aim is to quan-
tify the risk for CVD associated with total sedentary time in-
dependent of physical activity, only studies that reported mea-
sures of total sedentary time and the associated risk for CVD
adjusted for physical activity were included in the meta-
analysis. If multiple articles were published from the same co-
hort, we included data from the study with the most detailed
report of sedentary time and/or the larger sample size. The pri-
mary outcome of interest for this meta-analysis was incident
atherosclerotic CVD (coronary heart disease, including non-
fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV-related mortal-
ity). Two independent investigators (A.P. and U.S.) conducted
the initial screening of all titles or abstracts and then evalu-
ated all potentially relevant articles based on full-text
reviews. Studies were excluded if they failed to meet all the
criteria detailed above. All discrepancies regarding study
inclusion were adjudicated by the senior author (J.D.B.). For
one study,6 the data on association between sedentary time
categories and CVD risk were obtained from a related thesis
publication by the same author group archived in the Univer-
sity of Tampere, Finland electronic database (https://tampub
.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/76853/gradu06623.pdf
?sequence=1). The study quality was assessed using the
Newcastle-OttawaScale,whichallowedatotalscoreof9points

of each study.22
Data Collection
Two of us (A.P. and U.S.) independently performed the data
collection from April 5 to July 6, 2015, using a standardized
form. Information recorded for each study is detailed in the
eMethods in the Supplement. Disagreements between the 2
reviewers regarding extracted data were resolved by consen-
sus, and if needed, in consultation with the senior author
(J.D.B.). No personal communication with study authors was
required to obtain pertinent data from the selected studies.
Key Points
Questions What is the quantitative association between
sedentary time and the risk for cardiovascular disease?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 9 prospective cohort studies
with 720 425 unique participants and 25 769 unique
cardiovascular events, a nonlinear association between sedentary
time and incident cardiovascular events was found, with an
increased risk observed for more than 10 h/d of sedentary time.
Meaning The association of sedentary time with the risk for
adverse cardiovascular events is nonlinear with an increased risk
only at very high levels, which could have implications for
guideline recommendations regarding the risks related to
sedentary behavior.

Statistical Analysis
Exposure Assessment
Dose-response meta-analysis was performed using the statis-
tical analysis approach as previously described.19,20 Briefly,
we estimated the median sedentary duration for each seden-
tary time category as described in the eMethods in the
Supplement and assigned it to the corresponding hazard ratio
(HR) for each study. The reported ranges of sedentary time
categories and estimated medians are detailed in eTable 1 in
the Supplement.
Outcome Assessment
For the present meta-analysis we used the HR or relative risk
as available with their 95% CIs as a measure of the effect size
associated with each category of sedentary time for all stud-
ies. In articles that studied more than 1 type of sedentary ac-
tivity (eg, sitting time, television time), overall sedentary time
was preferentially included for analysis. We used HRs from
multivariable-adjusted models with the most complete ad-
justment for potential baseline confounders, including the
presence of baseline CVD risk factors and physical activity lev-
els for primary analysis.23
Categorical Dose-Response Analysis
Categorical and continuous dose-response analysis was per-
formed in the present study. The categorical dose-response
analysis was performed with STATA software (version 10.0;
StataCorp). Because most of the studies had 3 or fewer seden-
tary time categories (6 of 9), we used a previously described
approach19 to pool data across studies and generated 3
pooled categories of sedentary time (ie, highest, intermedi-
ate, and lowest) as described in the eMethods in the Supple-
ment. The median durations of the pooled highest, interme-
diate, and lowest sedentary time categories were 2.5
(interquartile range, 1.5- 2.9), 7.5 (interquartile range, 6.6-
7.6), and 12.5 (interquartile range, 9.5-13.8) hours, respec-
tively. The pooled HRs and 95% CI for CVD associated with
different categories of sedentary time were calculated by
comparing the highest and intermediate with the lowest sed-
entary time categories using the random-effects modeling
technique as described by DerSimonian and Laird.24 Maxi-
mally adjusted HRs, when reported, were used for the pri-
mary analysis to account for confounding variables. Pooled
analysis comparing highest vs lowest sedentary times
included all available studies (n = 9), whereas comparisons of
intermediate vs lowest sedentary time categories included 8
studies. We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 test (I2 > 50%
was assumed to be a result of significant heterogeneity). We
tested the robustness of the observed associations by per-
forming subgroup analyses based on age of participants (>55
vs ≤55 years), geographic location (US vs non-US studies),
physical activity levels (above vs below the pooled median
level), multivariable adjustment strategy used in the analysis
(HR associated with models with vs without adjustment for
physical activity and body mass index [BMI]), and duration
of follow-up (<10 vs ≥10 years). Publication bias was assessed
using contour-enhanced funnel plots and the Begg’
s rank
correlation test. All P values were-2 tailed. For all tests, a
probability level less than .05 was considered statistically
significant.
Continuous Dose-Response Analysis
The continuous dose-response association between seden-
tary time and risk for CVD was assessed using a generalized
least squares regression model with the maximum likeli-
hood method using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Corpora-
tion), as previously described in the literature.19,20,25 This
method accounts for appropriate variance-covariance asso-
ciations between and within studies. It uses the multiple
data points available in all studies simultaneously to provide
the best overall pooled dose-response estimate in a single
estimation. Nonlinearity in the association between seden-
tary time and CVD risk was assessed by modeling sedentary
time duration with the use of restricted cubic splines with

3 knots at fixed centiles (5%, 50%, and 95%) of the distribu-
tion. We first estimated a restricted cubic spline model with
a generalized least squares regression, considering the corre-
lation within each set of reported HRs. We then combined
the study-specific estimates, using the restricted maximum
likelihood method in a multivariable random-effects meta-
analysis. We also performed sensitivity analyses using HRs
from models without adjustment for physical activity and
BMI levels to determine whether the observed dose-
response association was different with vs without adjust-
ment for these potential confounders.

included only women and 7 studies6,8,12-16 included men and
women. Sedentary behavior was assessed by self-reported
questionnaire in the included studies. Objective criteria (ad-
ministrative database or national mortality and/or death in-
dex) were used to identify the incident CVD or associated mor-
tality events in most studies (Table 2). Most studies adjusted
forcovariatessuchasage(n = 9),sex(n = 9),BMI(n = 7),smok-
ing (n = 9), physical activity (n = 9), and CVD risk factors (dia-
betes and/or hypertension) (n = 6) in the most adjusted model
evaluating the association between sedentary time and CVD
risk (Table 2). Across most of the included studies, higher sed-
entary time was associated with lower levels of physical ac-
tivity (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Study Quality, Publication Bias, and Subgroup Analysis
Assessment of study quality yielded a mean score of 8.7, and
all studies had a score of 8 or above (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). We did not observe a significant publication bias in
the present meta-analysis (P for Egger line regression
test = .26; P for Begg rank correlation test = .45 [eFigure 2 in
the Supplement]).
Association Between Total Sedentary Time and CVD Risk
Figure 1 shows the pooled estimates the risk for CVD associ-
ated with different sedentary time categories. No significant
heterogeneity was observed in the pooled analysis compar-
ingthehighestvslowestsedentarytimecategoriesacrossstud-
ies (I2 = 39.7%; P = .08), whereas moderate heterogeneity was
observed in the pooled comparison between intermediate vs
lowest sedentary time categories (I2 = 61.8%; P = .004). Com-
pared with the lowest sedentary time category (median dura-
tion, 2.5 h/d), participants in the highest sedentary time cat-
egory(medianduration,12.5h/d)hadanincreasedriskforCVD
(pooled HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19). However, the risk associ-
ated with the intermediate sedentary time category (median
duration, 7.5 h/d) compared with the lowest sedentary time
category was not statistically significant (pooled HR, 1.02; 95%
CI, 0.96-1.08). In continuous analyses, we found a nonlinear
association between sedentary time and CVD risk (P < .001 for
nonlinearity), with a nonsignificant increased risk observed
only at sedentary times more than 6.8 h/d (pooled HR, 1.01;
95% CI, 0.95-1.08), and that became statistically significant at
times more than 10.04 h/d (pooled HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-
1.14) (Figure 2).
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analysis
To confirm the robustness of our study findings, we con-
ducted additional sensitivity and subgroup analysis evaluat-
ing the association between the highest levels of sedentary
time and the risk for CVD. We did not observe a significant
difference in magnitude or direction of the association
between high levels of sedentary time and CVD risk in sub-
group analyses by age, geographic location, follow-up dura-
tion, and levels of physical activity at baseline (eTable 4 in
the Supplement).
To characterize better the effect of physical activity on the
observed associations between sedentary time and CVD risk,
we conducted additional sensitivity analyses by pooling HRs
from multivariable-adjusted models without adjustment for
physical activity (4 studies11,13-15). We observed similar asso-
ciations between the highest levels of sedentary time and CVD
risk using HRs unadjusted for physical activity (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Similar findings were also observed in continu-
ous dose-response analyses with a statistically significant risk
for CVD events observed at a modestly lower sedentary time
threshold of 9.2 hours compared with the primary analysis
(10.04 h/d) (Figure 3A and B).

We also assessed the role of BMI as a potential contribu-
tor to the observed association between sedentary time and
CVD risk by performing separate pooled analysis using HRs
from models that evaluated the association between seden-
tary time and CVD risk with vs without adjustment for BMI.
In categorical analyses, the pooled estimate was not different
in studies with vs without adjustment for BMI (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Similar findings were also observed in continu-
ous dose-response analysis using hazard ratios unadjusted for
BMI (Figure 3C).
Joint Effect of Physical Activity and Sedentary Time
on CVD Risk
The joint effect of physical activity and sedentary time was re-
ported quantitatively in 3 studies.8,9,15 We did not perform a
meta-analysis to evaluate the joint effects of physical activity
and sedentary time on CVD risk owing to the small number of
available studies. However, we compared the relative hazard
associated with higher levels of sedentary time among physi-
cally inactive vs active groups in each of the 3 studies (eTable
5 in the Supplement). Five studies8,9,11,13,15 performed inter-
action testing between physical activity levels and sedentary
time for CVD risk. Of these, 4 studies8,9,11,15 observed no sig-
nificant interaction between the 2 variables, whereas 1 study13
reported a significant interaction between television viewing
timeandphysicalactivitylevelamongmenforCVDrisk(eTable
5 in the Supplement).
Discussion
The findings from this meta-analysis, based on 720 425 par-
ticipants from 9 cohort studies and including 25 769 CVD
events, demonstrate a nonlinear association between seden-
tary time levels and CVD risk. After adjustment for physical
activity and other CVD risk factors, significant risk for CVD was
observedwithveryhighlevelsofsedentarytime(>10h/d),with
no apparent risk associated with intermediate levels of sed-
entary time. To our knowledge, the present study represents
the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of the dose-
response association between sedentary time and CVD risk in
the general population.
Recent meta-analyses have evaluated the dichotomous
association between sedentary time (high vs low) and the
risk for adverse clinical outcomes and demonstrated an
increased risk for diabetes, CVD, and incident cancer with
greatest levels of sedentary time.7,26 However, these studies
were limited by lack of adjustment for physical activity in
the included studies26 or the lack of assessment of the
graded dose-response association between sedentary time
and CVD risk.7 Thus, the independent contributions of dif-
ferent levels of sedentary time toward CVD risk were not
assessed. The present study adds significantly to the existing
body of literature by providing a comprehensive evaluation
of the dose-response association between sedentary time
and CVD risk.
We observed a nonlinear association between total sed-
entarydurationandCVDrisk,withincreasedriskobservedonly
at a sedentary duration greater than 10 hours. The biological
mechanism underlying this nonlinear association is not com-
pletelyunderstood,butitappearstoreflectanapparentthresh-
old effect of sedentary time on cardiometabolic risk factors.
Along these lines a recent study by Qi et al27 demonstrated del-
eterious associations between objectively measured seden-
tary time and cardiometabolic biomarkers, with more pro-
nounced abnormalities in triglyceride levels, glucose
intolerance, insulin sensitivity, and C-reactive protein levels
observed only at the highest levels of sedentary time.

The nonlinear association between total sedentary time
and CVD risk observed in this study is in contrast to the lin-
ear association between television viewing time and CVD
risk that was previously reported by Grøntved and Hu in
2012.10 This discrepancy between the study findings could
be owing to differences in the measures of sedentary behav-
ior and pooled HRs for CVD events used in the 2 meta-
analyses. Although overall sedentary time was used as a
measure of sedentary behavior in the 9 cohort studies
included in the present meta-analysis, Grøntved and Hu10
included fewer studies and evaluated the association
between television viewing, a less informative measure of
overall sedentary behavior,28 and the risk for CVD. As a
result, the observed differences in the associations could
have been related to the difference in the exposure variable
of interest. Furthermore, Grøntved and Hu10 observed a
nonlinear association between television viewing and mor-
tality in a pooled analysis, similar to our study findings.
Our study findings have important clinical and public
health implications. Current public health guidelines are
focused on physical activity promotion in the general popu-
lation and recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate- to
vigorous-intensity physical activity on most days of the
week among healthy adults.2 In contrast, no such guideline
recommendations exist regarding the targets for reducing
daily duration of sedentary times in the general population.
This lack represents an important gap in the public health
guidelines when we consider that as many as two-thirds of
adult waking hours are sedentary. Our study findings pro-
vide important insights into the thresholds beyond which
sedentary time may be detrimental to CV health, indepen-
dent of physical activity levels. Reduction of sedentary
times for CVD prevention may be particularly relevant
among individuals who may not be able to tolerate
guideline-recommended physical activity levels owing to
comorbidities or other limitations.15,29 Nonambulatory
interventions, such as sit-stand workstations and activity-
permissive desks, aimed at reducing sedentary times among
these individuals with very high levels of sedentary time
(>10 h/d) may help to reduce CVD risk. This finding is also
supported by recent observational data that have reported
significant benefits of increased standing or stepping for
cardiometabolic risk biomarkers.30
The main strengths of our meta-analysis are inclusion of
large,well-establishedprospectivestudiesfromarangeofgeo-
graphic locations; a large number of included participants and
follow-up CV events; and detailed adjustment for a wide range
of potential confounding risk factors that allowed us to evalu-
ate the independent contributions of different levels of sed-
entarytimetoCVDrisk.Theincludedstudieswereofhighqual-
ity (mean score of 8.7 of 9), and we found no significant
publication bias in our included studies. We observed low to
moderate degrees of heterogeneity in categorical dose-
response analyses, with moderate heterogeneity only for the
intermediate vs lowest sedentary time comparison. Further-
more, to confirm the robustness of our study findings, we per-
formed several sensitivity and subgroup analyses and ob-
served no significant change in the magnitude of the direction

of the pooled effect size for the association between total sed-
entary duration and CVD risk.
Our study also has several important limitations. First, the
study protocol was not published a priori. Second, because we
performed a meta-analysis of observational studies, the re-
sultsaresubjecttounmeasuredorresidualconfounding.Third,
measurement errors in self-reported sedentary time and vari-
ability in the scale of sitting time across studies may have lim-
ited the analytical power of the study to determine the asso-
ciation between sedentary time and CVD risk, particularly at
higher levels. However, owing to the large number of partici-
pants and events included in our dose-response pooled analy-
sis, our study was well powered to detect even a very small risk
for CVD associated with unit increases in sedentary time, even
at the extreme levels. Future studies with objectively mea-
sured sedentary time levels using accelerometers and long-
term follow-up are needed to confirm our study findings. Fi-
nally, we only included English language studies in our meta-
analysis to negate culture-based heterogeneity in our study
findings. Although this criterion may have led to potential lan-
guage bias, previous studies have failed to demonstrate a sys-
tematic bias from use of language restriction.31
Conclusions
Our study findings suggest that CVD risk associated with total
sedentary time is nonlinear, with an increased risk only at very
highlevels(>10h/d).Furthermore,theCVDriskassociatedwith
very high levels of sedentary time is independent of the base-
line CVD risk factor burden and physical activity levels. Fu-
turestudiesareneededtocharacterizethemechanismsthrough
which high levels of sedentary time increase CVD risk and to
determine whether nonambulatory sitting reduction interven-
tions can potentially reduce the risk for adverse CVD events
among individuals with very high levels of sedentary time.
