 INTRODUCTION
A difference in blood pressure between 
arms is associated with peripheral arterial 
disease, and with increased cardiovascular 
or all-cause mortality.1 Previous studies 
have demonstrated associations between 
systolic 
inter-arm 
differences 
(IADs) 
≥10 mmHg or ≥15 mmHg and reduced 
survival in cohorts with established vascular 
disease or high cardiovascular risk.2–7 The 
need to explore this association in cohorts 
more representative of a general population 
has been identified.6
IAD in previous survival studies has been 
assessed using two7–9 or three pairs2,6 of 
blood pressure readings. Multiple readings 
avoid over-estimation of IADs,10,11 but 
a single pair of readings can screen out 
individuals without an IAD.12 It was therefore 
hypothesised that an IAD assessed from 
a single pair of readings, although over-
estimating the true prevalence of any 
difference in the chosen population, would 
still predict reduced survival for the cohort of 
subjects with an apparent IAD, because that 
cohort will include the majority of subjects 
with a true difference. 
Measurement of both arms is advised 
in initial assessment of patients with 
hypertension, but this advice is infrequently 
followed.13,14 The optimum strategy for 
assessment of IAD in primary care is 
unknown, but it should be a simple 
procedure in order for it to become accepted 
practice, so it is likely to be based on an 
initial single measurement of both arms.15
The 
aspirin 
for 
asymptomatic 
atherosclerosis (AAA) trial, a randomised 
controlled trial conducted from April 1998 
to October 2008, recruited 3350 males and 
females aged 50–75 years living in central 
Scotland and free of pre-existing clinical 
cardiovascular disease, from a community 
health registry. Participants were selected 
as having an elevated cardiovascular event 
risk, defined by an ankle-brachial index 
≤0.95, and allocated to receive low-dose 
aspirin (100 mg) or placebo daily to study 
the risks and benefits of long-term aspirin 
use in primary prevention. The recruitment 
protocol included a bilateral brachial blood 
pressure measurement. Participants were 
prospectively followed up for 10 years.16 
The authors undertook a cohort study of 
participants in the AAA trial using the bilateral 
brachial systolic blood pressures recorded 
at recruitment to examine the implications 
of a single assessment of systolic inter-
arm blood pressure difference for survival 
in a large community-based cohort free of 
confirmed pre-existing vascular disease, but 
at moderately increased risk based on a low 
ankle-brachial index.

Inter-arm blood pressure difference and mortality:
a cohort study in an asymptomatic primary care population at elevated 
cardiovascular risk
Abstract
Background
Differences in blood pressure between arms are 
associated with increased cardiovascular mortality 
in cohorts with established vascular disease or 
substantially elevated cardiovascular risk.
Aim
To explore the association of inter-arm difference 
(IAD) with mortality in a community-dwelling 
cohort that is free of cardiovascular disease.
Design and setting
Cohort analysis of a randomised controlled trial in 
central Scotland, from April 1998 to October 2008.
Method
Volunteers from Lanarkshire, Glasgow, and 
Edinburgh, free of pre-existing vascular disease 
and with an ankle-brachial index ≤0.95, had 
systolic blood pressure measured in both 
arms at recruitment. Inter-arm blood pressure 
differences were calculated and examined for 
cross-sectional associations and differences in 
prospective survival. Outcome measures were 
cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality 
during mean follow-up of 8.2 years.
Results
Based on a single pair of measurements, 60% 
of 3350 participants had a systolic IAD ≥5 mmHg 
and 38% ≥10 mmHg. An IAD ≥5 mmHg was 
associated with increased cardiovascular 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.91, 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 3.07) 
and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.44, 
95% CI = 1.15 to 1.79). Within the subgroup of 
764 participants who had hypertension, IADs 
of ≥5 mmHg or ≥10 mmHg were associated 
with both cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 
2.63, 95% CI = 0.97 to 7.02, and adjusted HR 
2.96, 95% CI = 1.27 to 6.88, respectively) and all-
cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.05 
to 2.66, and adjusted HR 1.63, 95% CI = 1.06 
to 2.50, respectively). IADs ≥15 mmHg were 
not associated with survival differences in this 
population.
Conclusion
Systolic IADs in blood pressure are associated 
with increased risk of cardiovascular events, 
including mortality, in a large cohort of people 
free of pre-existing vascular disease.

 METHOD
Study design
A cohort study of all AAA trial participants. 
Although conducted following completion of 
the AAA trial, the authors set up the study 
hypothesis and pre-defined the evaluation 
protocol prior to undertaking data analysis.
Study participants
Recruitment and screening methods have 
been fully described elsewhere.16,17 In 
summary, volunteers were recruited from 
Lanarkshire, Glasgow, and Edinburgh in 
central Scotland via community health 
indexes and local advertising, and invited for 
ankle-brachial 
index 
screening 
administered 
by specially trained nurses. Those with an 
ankle-brachial index of ≤0.95 entered the 
study cohort unless they had a history of 
myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, or 
peripheral artery disease, currently used 
aspirin, other antiplatelet or anticoagulant 
agents, or had contraindications to aspirin 
use. 
Blood pressure assessment
Measurements were taken by specially 
trained nurses who had regular quality 
control sessions throughout the trial. 
Subjects were rested supine for at least 
5 minutes, and systolic blood pressures were 
measured with Doppler probes (Huntleigh 
Healthcare, Cardiff, UK) and aneroid desk 
sphygmomanometers 
(Accoson; 
A.C. 
Cossor Ltd, London, UK) in a fixed sequence 
(right arm — left arm — left leg — right leg). 
The ankle-brachial index was calculated as 
the ratio of lowest ankle pressure (lower 
of posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis and 
of left and right) to higher arm pressure.18 
A further brachial systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure was then measured in the 
right arm by auscultation. There was no 
formal mechanism for deciding on cuff 
size: this was left to the nurses’ discretion. 
Originally, only the higher-reading Doppler 
systolic arm pressure was entered into the 
study database. For this analysis, both arm 
systolic pressures were transcribed to the 
study database from original recruitment 
screening records. The systolic IAD was 
calculated as the right minus left brachial 
pressures. Pulse pressure was calculated 
from the right-arm brachial auscultation 
pressures.
Follow-up and outcomes
Participants were followed up 3 months, 
1 year, and 5 years post-randomisation to 
aspirin or placebo at special clinics, and 
annually by telephone. They received a 
mid-year letter enquiring generally about 
problems and an end-of-year newsletter
. 
They were followed up until the end of 
the trial, irrespective of experiencing any 
endpoint or adverse event. The trial ran from 
April 1998 to October 2008. Ascertainment 
of events was sought annually by participant 
follow-up, by study reply card attached to 
GP notes, by flagging for death notifications 
at the NHS central registry, and also by 
linkage to databases of deaths and hospital 
discharges at NHS National Services 
Scotland. Confirmation of events (Appendix 
1) was sought by review of hospital and 
GP records independently by two members 
of the outcome events committee, with 
adjudication by the full committee in cases 
of disagreement. 
Data analysis
Baseline characteristics of participants 
according 
to 
systolic 
IAD 
cut-offs 
≥5 mmHg, ≥10 mmHg, and ≥15 mmHg 
were compared using t-tests or χ2 tests 
as appropriate. Kaplan–Meier analyses 
were used to compare cardiovascular 
and total mortality, and Cox proportional 
univariable regression models were used 
to derive unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs). 
Multivariable step-wise Cox regression 
models were also run to adjust for known 
potential confounding baseline variables: 
age, sex, smoking status, presence of 
diabetes, cholesterol levels, systolic blood 
pressure, pulse pressure, ankle-brachial 
index, deprivation index, and aspirin or 
placebo allocation. The authors chose 
a priori to undertake analyses for IADs 
≥5 mmHg, ≥10 mmHg, and ≥15 mmHg 
to maintain consistency with previous 
publications, and also explored fitting of IAD 
How this fits in
A difference in blood pressure between 
arms is associated with peripheral arterial 
disease, and with increased cardiovascular 
mortality. Evidence for this association 
in populations representative of a British 
primary care population is limited. This 
study examines the survival implications 
of a systolic inter-arm blood pressure 
difference in a representative population, 
obtained with a single pair of sequential 
blood pressure measurements. Increased 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality is 
demonstrated for an inter-arm difference 
(IAD) ≥5 mmHg and ≥10 mmHg. The 
findings support current guidance to 
measure both arms in assessing patients 
for high blood pressure. IADs can predict 
presence of peripheral arterial disease, 
and can refine estimation of future 
cardiovascular risk.
British Journal of General Practice, May 2016  e298
 as a continuous variable in multivariable 
analysis. To assess the specific contribution 
of IAD, the likelihood ratio test was used 
to assess the reduction in goodness of fit 
arising on omission of the IAD term from 
each adjusted model in stepwise analyses. 
The prognostic performance of models 
that included the IAD was assessed by 
calculating the C-statistic. The C-statistic 
is a measure of concordance and quantifies 
how well a model predicts outcome, 
where a C-statistic of 0.5 indicates a 
predictive value no better than chance.19 
The authors assessed proportionality 
of hazards over time by plotting –ln(-
ln[survival]) versus ln(analysis time) and 
tested using Schoenfeld residuals.20,21 No 
major violations of the proportional hazards 
assumption were found.
As participants in the AAA trial were 
randomised to aspirin or placebo, the 
authors also fitted a Cox regression model 
with an IAD and intervention allocation 
interaction term. This interaction term 
allowed the exploration of whether there 
was a differing survival impact of IAD 
according to trial treatment allocation.
Results were expressed as HRs and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analysis 
was carried out using SPSS 20 and STATA 
(Release 12).
RESULTS
Characteristics of participants by IAD 
The study enrolled 3350 subjects, mean 
(SD) age was 61.9 years (6.6), and 2396 
(71.5%) were female. Only three (0.1%) 
subjects had atrial fibrillation. Full baseline 
characteristics have been previously 
reported.16 A total of 2013 (60%) had systolic 
IADs ≥5 mmHg, 1280 (38%) ≥10 mmHg, and 
553 (17%) ≥15 mmHg. Subjects with any IAD 
(≥5, ≥10, or ≥15 mmHg) had higher baseline 
blood pressures than those without an IAD. 
Ankle-brachial index was lower with IADs 
≥10 or ≥15 mmHg than for those without 
(Table 1). Mean systolic blood pressure was 
4.3 mmHg higher on the right (interquartile 
range –2 to 10 mmHg, Figure 1).
Cross-sectional
All systolic IADs were associated with 
higher prevalences of peripheral arterial 
disease, whether defined as an ankle-
brachial index <0.9 or <0.85 (Table 2), 
and IAD and ankle-brachial index were 
weakly negatively correlated as continuous 
variables (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
(r) 0.08, P<0.001). IAD was positively 
correlated with pulse pressure with an 
incremental rise of 1.2 mmHg (95% CI = 0.9 
to 1.5, r = 0.12, P 
<0.001) for each 20 mmHg

 increase in pulse pressure. 
Univariable survival analysis
Mean follow-up was 8.2 years (1.6) and 
10 (0.3%) subjects were lost to follow-up. 
There were 362 (10.8%) deaths from any 
cause, including 94 (2.8%) cardiovascular 
deaths. Compared with those without 
IADs, cardiovascular mortality was higher 
for IADs ≥5 mmHg (unadjusted HR 1.92, 
95% CI = 1.21 to 3.05) and ≥10 mmHg 
(HR 1.62, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.43), and 
all-cause mortality was higher with 
differences ≥5 mmHg (unadjusted HR 
1.33, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.66, Figure 2). No 
survival differences were seen with IADs 
>15 mmHg (Table 3).
There were 764 (23%) subjects with 
hypertension. For this subgroup, IADs 
>10 mmHg were associated with increased 
cardiovascular mortality (unadjusted HR 
2.87, 95% CI = 1.28 to 6.44) and increased 
all-cause mortality (unadjusted HR 1.59, 
95% CI = 1.04 to 2.43) (Appendix 2). No 
survival differences were observed for non-
cardiovascular deaths for >5 mmHg (HR 
1.19, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.53), for >10 mmHg 
(HR 1.02, 95% CI = 0.80 to 1.31), or for 
>15 mmHg (HR 1.05, 95% CI = 0.77 to 1.44).
Multivariable survival analysis
On regression as a continuous variable, IAD 
was not significant for mortality. As a discrete 
variable, an IAD ≥5 mmHg remained a 
predictor of increased cardiovascular and 
all-cause mortality (HR 1.91, 95% CI = 1.19 
to 3.07, and HR 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.79, 
respectively) in a fully adjusted model, but 
for an IAD ≥10 mmHg the adjusted HR 
lost significance for cardiovascular deaths 
(HR 1.49, 95% CI = 0.98 to 2.27, P = 0.06). 
Within the hypertensive subgroup after full 
adjustment, IADs ≥5 mmHg and ≥10 mmHg 
were associated with both cardiovascular 
(HR 2.63, 95% CI = 0.97 to 7.02, and HR 
2.96, 95% CI = 1.27 to 6.88, respectively) and 
all-cause mortality (HR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.05 
to 2.66, and HR 1.63, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.50, 
respectively, Table 3). The regression model 
included terms for age, sex, smoking 
status, presence of diabetes, cholesterol 
levels, systolic blood pressure, pulse 
pressure, ankle-brachial index, Scottish 
index of multiple deprivation, and allocation

 to aspirin or placebo. Examination of 
likelihood ratios confirmed the significant 
contribution of IADs ≥5 mmHg and 
≥10 mmHg to the multivariable models. 
There was a consistent loss of goodness 
of fit with exclusion of the IAD term from 
models. Cox regression prognostic models 
performed well, with C-statistic values 
consistently >0.70. Other significant terms 
in the models were age, sex, smoking 
status, pulse pressure, ankle-brachial 
index, presence of diabetes, and, for all-
cause mortality only, deprivation index 
and systolic blood pressure. There was no 
evidence of an interaction (P>0.05) between 
the effect of IAD and death with allocation to 
trial treatments of aspirin or placebo.
DISCUSSION
Summary 
This analysis, with 10 years of follow-
up, has demonstrated that, in a cohort 
of subjects without clinical evidence of 
vascular disease at recruitment, an inter-
arm systolic difference ≥5 mmHg based 
on a single pair of measurements, is

 associated with increased cardiovascular 
and all-cause mortality. For subjects 
with hypertension, differences ≥5 mmHg 
and ≥10 mmHg are associated with 
increased cardiovascular and all-cause 
mortality. IADs (≥5, ≥10, or ≥15 mmHg) are 
associated in cross-sectional analysis with 
higher prevalences of peripheral arterial 
disease, and magnitude of IAD is positively 
associated with pulse pressure.
Strengths and limitations
This study is comparable in size with other 
recent community-based cohort studies 
from the US reporting reduced survival with 
an IAD in blood pressure.8,9 Participants 
were recruited from primary care age-sex 
registers and are broadly representative of a 
general population. The statuses of subjects’ 
inter-arm blood pressure difference were 
unknown throughout follow-up, because 
differences were calculated specifically 
for this analysis using additional data 
transcribed from the original recruitment 
screening records. Consequently the 
authors are confident that, in IAD terms, 
any risk of bias in recording of events and 
deaths was avoided.
Atrial fibrillation was not prevalent in 
this study, and so does not account for 
the IADs observed here.3 The prevalence 
figures reported here for IADs are high 
in comparison with other large cohort 
studies,4,8,9 but are based on a single pair of 
sequential blood pressure measurements. 
Sequential rather than simultaneous 
measurements 
are 
associated 
with 
two- to threefold higher prevalences,11,22 
and prevalence is over-estimated when 
measurements are not repeated,10,11,23 due 
at least in part to white-coat effects.23,24 
Thus simultaneous, automated repeated 
measurements of IAD should be a reference 
standard for epidemiological study.10 
However, the authors have found that a 
single sequential pair of measurements can 
exclude confirmed IAD with a high negative 
predictive value,11,12 and designed this study 
to investigate whether IADs detected by this 
simple method can also predict survival 
differences. 
The method of measurement does 
not influence the strength of association 
between peripheral arterial disease and 
systolic IADs.1 On recent meta-analysis the 
authors observed a trend towards higher 
HRs for survival differences when using 
simultaneous IAD measurement methods 
compared with sequential methods, thus 
survival differences reported here may 
under-estimate the true figures for this 
cohort.25
This analysis was undertaken following 
publication of the AAA trial and was not 
specifically powered to assess a pre-defined 
difference in survival by IAD. However, the 
analyses were pre-specified and the large 
sample size suggests that the risk of a

 chance finding accounting for the results 
is small.
In order to identify a cohort free of clinically 
apparent pre-existing vascular disease but 
at higher than average community risk 
of events, an inclusion criterion for this 
cohort was an ankle-brachial index <0.95. 
Therefore the range of ankle-brachial index 
values was restricted, leading to a potential 
underestimate of the strength of correlation 
of ankle-brachial index with IAD.26,27
Because the AAA trial was not powered 
to formally assess the effects of aspirin 
compared with placebo in specific 
subgroups, the data analysis addressing the 
question of whether observed reductions in 
survival associated with IADs are moderated 
by aspirin treatment should be considered 
as exploratory.
Comparison with existing literature
Some previous reports have suggested a 
bias towards higher blood pressure readings 
on the right,28–35 whereas others have failed 
to demonstrate this.36–41 Studies looking 
specifically at left or right handedness have 
also failed to demonstrate an association 
with the higher-reading arm.33,42 In the 
current study, blood pressures were 
recorded in a fixed sequence for ankle-
brachial index assessment,18 which may 
account for the bias towards higher right-
arm blood pressures observed through 
order effects. 
Current guidance suggests that an IAD 
<10 mmHg can be considered to be normal 
and that systolic differences ≥20 mmHg 
warrant specialist referral.14 Previous 
studies have proposed a ‘normal range’ 
for systolic or diastolic differences of up to 
10 mmHg,39 and it has been argued that the 
high prevalence of differences above these 
cut-offs implies that this is a physiological 
rather than pathological finding.40,43 This 
study implies that a new threshold as low as 
≥5 mmHg for a systolic IAD may be clinically 
important. Only this and the larger Vietnam 
experience study8 have shown that an IAD 
≥5 mmHg is associated with a survival 
difference. Whether this new finding can be 
generalised to populations at higher levels 
of cardiovascular risk is unknown. However, 
HRs associated with IAD do increase with 
rising population cardiovascular risk.25
Peripheral arterial disease is recognised 
as a risk factor for future cardiovascular 
events and mortality,44 and the authors 
have previously proposed that an IAD in 
blood pressure is due to peripheral arterial 
disease.45 A systolic IAD >15 mmHg is 
associated with angiographic evidence of 
carotid or aortic arch disease in selected 
populations at high risk,46 and upper-
limb vascular disease is associated with 
hypertension.47 Some authors have labelled 
an IAD ≥15 mmHg ‘subclavian stenosis’,7,48 
but there is no direct radiological evidence 
from general populations, such as the 
cohort studied here, to confirm that 
this is the anatomical cause of an IAD.1 
Structural changes in large arteries as a 
result of hypertension begin early in the 
course of the condition and cardiovascular 
and peripheral vascular disease are late 
sequelae of a process of gradual arterial 
stiffening.49 
Recent 
cross-sectional 
studies have associated systolic IADs 
≥10 mmHg with elevated ankle-brachial 
pulse wave velocity, an indicator of 
increasing vascular stiffness.50–52 Increased 
variability of blood pressure (a potential 
confounder of sequentially measured IAD) 
is also associated with increasing arterial 
stiffness,53,54 and this process also leads 
to increasing pulse pressures.55 Only non-
significant associations of IAD and pulse 
pressure have previously been reported.50 
This study found an association of rising 
pulse pressure with IAD. This adds to 
the evidence associating IADs, arterial 
stiffening, and increased mortality. Further 
work on these associations may provide a 
better explanation of the aetiology of IADs.
The 
survival 
findings 
presented 
here are consistent with those of other 
recent large community-based cohort 
studies,4,8 A recent meta-analysis only 
reported significant survival differences in 
community-dwelling cohorts for systolic 
IADs >15 mmHg.56 The current findings 
show no statistical heterogeneity when 
pooled with other similar published and 
unpublished studies4,8,57 and demonstrate 
survival differences in cardiovascular and 
all-cause mortality at both ≥5 mmHg 
and ≥10 mmHg IADs.25 In keeping with 
other cohorts, HRs for cardiovascular 
mortality are greater than those for all-
cause mortality,25 because the contribution 
of IAD to all-cause mortality is explained, 
as shown by this data, by the inclusion of 
cardiovascular deaths within such analyses.
Associations of reducing ankle-brachial 
index with increased mortality demonstrate 
a ‘dose-response’ effect,44 whereas this was 
not clearly demonstrable for rising IADs 
in this study. The authors have previously 
reported failure to fit IAD as a continuous 
variable in other survival analyses.2 Some 
previous reports have demonstrated a 
clear gradient in HRs and magnitude of 
IADs,4,6,9,12,36 whereas others have not.5,8 
There were relatively few events included in 
analyses at the higher cut-off of ≥15 mmHg 
e303  British Journal of General Practice, May 2016 
 difference. However, the full explanation 
within this cohort is unclear, and potential 
threshold effects need further study to fully 
account for the findings.
Implications for research and practice
The prevalence findings in this study support 
current clinical guidance to measure both 
arms in the initial assessment of patients 
for high blood pressure,14 and to confirm 
any IAD with simultaneous assessment.58 
Currently this advice is not routinely 
followed,13,15,59–61 and therefore patients 
may be unknowingly under-investigated or 
under-treated for hypertension if an IAD is 
not looked for
.62 
The association of an IAD with peripheral 
arterial disease confirms the authors’ 
previous finding that IADs have a high 
specificity for prediction of reduced ankle-
brachial index.1,27 This is not routinely 
assessed in primary care and requires 
time, 
equipment, 
and 
expertise.63,64 
Diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease can 
however identify people who can benefit 
from interventions, and is a domain of the 
current Quality and Outcomes Framework 
in the UK. Therefore, identification of an IAD 
should trigger consideration of symptoms 
such as claudication, which may require 
further investigation.
Similarly, the association with reduced 
cardiovascular survival might suggest that 
aggressive vascular protection could be 
considered. This proposition has not been 
tested in a trial setting. However, these data 
add to the body of evidence identifying IADs 
as cross-sectional and prospective risk 
markers for cardiovascular and peripheral 
vascular disease.1,65 Blood pressure control 
is worse in people without established 
cardiovascular disease (those receiving 
primary prevention), compared with those 
with established disease (secondary 
prevention).66 
Therefore, 
recognition 
of novel cardiovascular risk markers to 
refine risk prediction and stratify treatment 
priorities can be informative,67 and patients 
will benefit, because communication of 
excess cardiovascular risk is associated 
with improved patient adherence to healthy 
lifestyle changes.68
This study has shown that the association 
of IADs with reduced survival observed in 
populations at high cardiovascular risk can 
be extended to a population free of clinically 
evident cardiovascular disease. The authors 
are undertaking further work in cohorts 
representative of the general population to 
generalise these findings, determine the 
minimum clinically important threshold for 
an IAD, and understand the uncertainty 
around the presence or absence of a risk 
gradient with IAD.69 Studies to assess the 
implications of an IAD for further vascular 
screening and for therapeutic interventions 
are also needed, in tandem with work 
to examine the best pragmatic method 
for initially detecting an IAD in primary 
care. Finally, direct vascular imaging and 
assessment of unselected populations are 
required to clearly identify the aetiology of 
an IAD, and to provide evidence to support 
or refute any future suggested therapeutic 
intervention.
