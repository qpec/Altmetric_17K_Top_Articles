Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone with essential roles in regulating insulin secretion, 
carbohydrate metabolism and appetite. GLP-1 effects are mediated through binding to GLP-1R, a 
family B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling primarily through the stimulatory G 
protein Gs. Family B GPCRs are important therapeutic targets, however our understanding of their 
mechanism of action is limited by the lack of structural information on activated and full-length 
receptors. Here we show the electron cryo-microscopy structure of the peptide-activated 
GLP-1R:Gs complex at near atomic resolution. The peptide is clasped between the N-terminal 
domain and transmembrane core of the receptor, further stabilized by extracellular loops. 
Conformational changes in the transmembrane domain result in a sharp kink in the middle of 
transmembrane helix 6, which pivots its intracellular half outward to accommodate the α5 helix of 
GαsRas. These results provide a structural framework for understanding family B receptor 
activation through hormone binding.
GLP-1 is a hormone released from the gut in response to food intake and acts on GLP-1R to 
stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells, reduce glucagon 
secretion from pancreatic α cells, as well as decrease gastric motility and appetite1. Given its

 physiological effects, GLP-1R represents an important drug target for type-2 diabetes and 
obesity2, with GLP-1 and its analogs already serving as approved therapeutics.
GLP-1R is a prototypical member of the family B GPCRs3 and forms the glucagon receptor 
subfamily along with the glucagon receptor (GCGR), the glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor 
(GLP-2R), and the gastric inhibitor polypeptide receptor (GIPR). Family B receptors share 
common structural features including an extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) that binds 
to the C-terminal half of the peptide hormone, and a 7 transmembrane domain (TMD) that 
binds the N-terminal half of the peptide (Fig 1a). The NTDs of family B GPCRs share a 
common fold stabilized by three disulfides, and contribute most of the binding affinity of the 
receptor for the peptide4, 5. A two-step, two-domain model of activation has been proposed 
where the C-terminus of the agonist peptide initially engages the NTD6. After this initial 
binding event, the N-terminal end of the peptide engages and activates the 7TMD with a 
mechanism that is currently unknown.
To date, nine NTD structures in complex with short hormone peptides have been reported 
(reviewed in7), including the GLP-1R NTD bound to GLP-14. More recently, the TMD 
structure of GCGR8, 9 and the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 110 in their inactive 
state provided the first insights into family B 7TMD configuration. However, our 
understanding of the Family B signal transduction mechanism remains limited, primarily 
due to the lack of structural information on active-state receptors that include both 7TMD 
and NTD in complex with peptide ligand.
GPCRs and their complexes have proven to be formidable targets for X-ray crystallography, 
often necessitating extensive engineering for conformational stabilization and 
crystallogenesis. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently emerged as a cutting-
edge structure determination method, yielding structures of macromolecular complexes that 
have resisted intensive crystallization efforts11–13. Nevertheless, high resolution cryo-EM on 
asymmetric and relatively small membrane proteins (<200 kDa) remains challenging due to 
the low signal-to-noise ratio that hampers the accuracy of angular determination for 3D 
reconstructions. This problem is compounded by the intrinsically dynamic character of the 
7TM bundle14, 15 and the relative instability of GPCR complexes, such as with G proteins16 
or arrestins17, often resulting in conformational variability or even dissociation during cryo-
EM specimen preparation. Notwithstanding these challenges, cryo-EM visualization for 
GPCR complexes holds tremendous potential for uncovering the various molecular 
mechanisms involved in signal transduction and regulation of GPCRs and their effector 
proteins. Here, we applied single-particle cryo-EM to determine the structure of the 150kDa 
complex between the active-state GLP-1R and heterotrimeric G protein Gs, obtaining 
insights into family B GPCR activation.
Cryo-EM structure determination of the GLP-1:GLP-1R:Gs complex
For cryo-EM studies we used rabbit GLP-1R, which shares 92% identity with the human 
receptor, as it expressed at higher levels in insect cells than the human or mouse homologue. 
GLP-1R is very unstable to extraction from membranes using conventional detergents such 
as DDM and MNG; therefore, we formed the complex between receptor and purified Gs in

 insect cell membranes prior to extraction of the GLP-1R:Gs complex with MNG and 
purification by antibody affinity and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. S1).
Sample evaluation by negative stain EM and single-particle averaging18 confirmed a 
monodisperse particle population and stable complex formation. Initial cryo-EM 
experiments suggested that the protein complex avoided areas of thin vitreous ice, and we 
thus had to image the specimen in relatively thick ice at the expense of increased 
background noise in the micrographs (Fig. S2a). Nevertheless, 2D classification revealed 
class averages with clear secondary structure features for the complex, including the 
GLP-1R 7TM region embedded in detergent micelle (Fig. S2b). Subsequent 3D 
classification led to the identification of a particle partition showing well defined and stable 
features for the complex, apart from the α-helical (AH) domain of Gαs whose density was 
averaged out (Fig. S3). This is in agreement with our previous studies showing that the AH 
domain gets delocalized from the GαsRas domain and becomes flexible in the absence of 
nucleotide19. Refinement and reconstruction of the selected particle projections after 
subtracting densities for the detergent micelle and the mobile AH domain enabled us to 
obtain a 3D reconstruction of the complex at 4.1-Å global resolution, with 3.9-Å nominal 
resolution in the core region that includes GLP-1, TMD and the α5 helix of GαsRas (Fig. 
1b,c and S3–5). The cryo-EM map shows a stable and well defined density for the GLP-1 
peptide that is observed between the receptor NTD and the hydrophobic core of the 7TM 
region. In addition, the linker connecting the NTD to the 7TM region is clearly visible in 
reconstructions obtained without applying micelle masking, where we also observe the lipid 
moiety of Gβγ inserted in the MNG detergent micelle (Fig. S6a,b).
Using the cryo-EM density map we built and refined a near atomic resolution structure of 
the GLP-1:GLP-1R:Gs complex. Side chains of primarily bulky amino acid residues are 
clearly identifiable in most transmembrane helices that appear to assume overall stable 
positions (Fig. S5). The only exception is the cytoplasmic half of TM6, whose density is less 
well defined compared to the other TMs, suggesting that this part becomes dynamic in the 
activated GLP-1R. The GLP-1 peptide is well resolved, particularly in its N-terminal half 
that maintains interactions with the TM core. This is also the case for the α5 helix of Gαs, 
the C-terminal part of which is stably interacting with the cytoplasmic part of GLP-1R. In 
addition, the map includes densities for all intracellular and extracellular receptor loops 
(ECLs). Thus, we could resolve several key interactions of GLP-1R with GLP-1 and 
heterotrimeric Gs.
GLP-1 recognition by GLP-1R
The activated GLP-1R structure shows that the GLP-1 peptide is stably anchored in its 
position through an extensive network of interactions that involves TMs 1,2,5,7, ECLs 1 and 
2, as well as the NTD (Fig. 2, Fig. S7). Even though the cryo-EM map is limited in 
resolution, the α-helical nature of the peptide and the stability of its position have allowed us 
to confidently establish its main interactions with the receptor. The majority of these 
observations, summarized in Supplementary Table S1, are confirmed through extensive 
mutagenesis studies on GLP1-R and other Family B GPCRs20–31.

 The interface between the C-terminal half of the peptide hormone and NTD appears 
identical to the one in the crystal structure of NTD:GLP-1 (Fig. S8). Of interest, the cryo-
EM map suggests that the NTD is not in contact with the 7TM region, although based on our 
refined structure we raise the possibility of Gln213 of ECL1 interacting with Arg40 located 
in the α1-helix of the extracellular domain (Fig. S9a). Given that TM1 and NTD are 
separated by a flexible linker sequence, the lack of direct interactions implies that in the 
absence of ligand the extracellular domain is flexible, which is likely important for the initial 
engagement of the peptide32.
For some Family B members, the binding of the peptide to the TM core may stabilize the 
formation of an α-helix at the N-terminus, which can then activate the receptor33. Consistent 
with this, the cryo-EM structure reveals that the N-terminus of GLP-1 forms at least one 
additional helical turn in the core of the receptor compared to its structure when bound only 
to the NTD4. Thus, the N-terminus of GLP-1 penetrates into the receptor core (Fig. 2a) to a 
depth comparable to the orthosteric agonist BI-167107 in the structure of activated β2AR16, 
a family A GPCR (Fig. S9b). An important interaction in this region is mediated by 
conserved H7P, which is in position to establish hydrogen bonding with R299 (Fig. 2b,c). 
This Arginine resides in ECL2, and thus the long side chain points down towards the 
receptor core in order to reach close to the peptide N-terminus (Fig. S7). Another significant 
contact at the N-terminus of the peptide is mediated through E9P that participates in van der 
Waals interactions with Leu388 and Ser392 of TM7, while it is also positioned to potentially 
form hydrogen bonding with conserved polar residues R190 on TM2 and Y145 on TM1 
(Fig. 2c). Position 190 is highly conserved, with strict occupancy by Arg or Lys, as is also 
the case for K197 (GCGR is exception) that is hydrogen bonded to T13P in GLP-1 (Fig. 2d).
Moving away from the peptide N-terminus, notable interactions with GLP-1R involve ECLs 
1 and 2. A cluster of neighboring serines (S14p, S17p, S18p) forms polar interactions with 
T298 and the backbone oxygen of W297 and nitrogen of R299 on ECL2 (Fig. 2c). Thus, 
ECL2 plays a prominent role in GLP-1 binding, in agreement with previous studies20, 21, 28. 
Towards the peptide C-terminus, we observe W31p interacting with ECL1, packing against 
residues Q211 and H212 (Fig. 2d). ECL1 has been implicated in peptide binding based on 
hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments and MD simulations with GCGR32, as well as 
alanine scanning mutagenesis on the calcitonin receptor-like receptor31. We also note that 
the prominent interactions involving ECLs 1 and 2 with residues past the N-terminal region 
of the hormone may explain the partial agonist activity of shorter peptide fragments, such as 
GLP-1(15–36)34.
Comparison with inactive family B receptors
GLP-1R and GCGR share an overall 44% sequence homology that extends to 55% for the 
TMDs. We thus chose the crystal structure of GCGR in complex with antagonist8 as a 
reference to examine the structural changes associated with family B GPCR activation. 
Comparison between activated GLP-1R and inactive GCGR reveals that the TM bundle 
undergoes extensive conformational transitions induced by the multiple peptide-receptor 
interactions (Fig. 2). In the extracellular half of the receptor, TM7 bends towards TM6 using 
as pivot point the kink at G3957.50b (Wooten numbering in superscript25) (Fig. 3a),

 equivalent to the conserved G7.42 (Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering for family A GPCRs in 
superscript35) in family A GPCRs36. In the inactive family B GPCR structures, the 
extracellular halves of TM6 and TM7, including ECL3, exhibit high crystallographic 
temperature factors indicating structural flexibility. In the active GLP-1R complex, the 
extracellular half of TM6 unwinds and moves outwards to allow interactions between the 
peptide amino terminus and the TMD binding pocket. The extracellular half of TM1 follows 
the movement of TM7, dictated by the hydrogen bond between highly conserved S1551.50b 
and the backbone of L3967.51b, which was found to stabilize the kink in TM7 in both apo 
and inactive family B GPCRs8–10. In addition, more limited changes are observed in the 
extracellular halves of TM3, TM4, and TM5, which appear to move in tandem with the same 
orientation in response to peptide binding (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the extracellular end of 
TM2 is extended by 10 residues in activated GLP-1R compared to inactive GCGR (Fig. 3a–
b). This α-helical extension elevates the position of ECL1, which is ordered against the C-
terminal half of the peptide, in contrast to its apparent disorder in all available family B 
GPCR structures8–10. Consistent with this observation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange 
studies and MD simulations also indicate the peptide binding event stabilizes the 
conformation of ECL1 in the glucagon-GCGR complex32.
In the intracellular half of the receptor we observe a remarkable agreement in the positions 
of TM1-4 and TM7 between the inactive GCGR and active GLP-1R (Fig. 3c). The most 
profound structural difference is the sharp kink in the middle of TM6, which pivots its 
intracellular half to move outwards by ~18 Å when measured at the Cα carbon of K3466.35b. 
The TM6 kink locates in the Pro6.47b-Leu-Leu-Gly6.50p sequence, representing the PXXG 
motif that is conserved throughout the mammalian family B receptors, with the proline 
playing a key role in receptor activation37, 38. The presence of proline and glycine, having 
poor helix-forming propensities, make this motif flexible and susceptible to unwinding, 
which is required for signal transduction through the 7TM bundle. A smaller outwards 
movement of ~7 Å is observed for the cytoplasmic end of TM5 as it repositions to facilitate 
the outward opening of TM6. As a result of the TM6 outward movement, the polar 
interaction network involving H2.50b, E3.50b, T6.42b and Y7.57b is disrupted (Fig. 3d). The 
HETx motif is highly conserved in family B members and is equivalent to the conserved 
E/DRY motif in family A GPCRs, whose interactions have also been shown to stabilize the 
inactive state39. Accordingly, mutation of HETx motif residues results in constitutive 
activation of many family B GPCRs40, 41.
Interactions between activated GLP-1R and Gs
The 18-Å outwards opening of the cytoplasmic half of TM6 and more limited associated 
movement of TM5 forms a cavity together with TM2-3 and TM7 that serves as the main 
binding site for the GαsRas domain of heterotrimeric Gs (Fig. 4a–b). Compared to the 
β2AR-Gs crystal structure16, the interface of Gs with GLP-1R additionally involves direct 
interactions of Gβ with ICL1 and α-helix H8, which is tilted towards the G protein (Fig. 4c–
d, Fig. S6b). The connection between H8-helix and Gβ is clearly visible in maps generated 
without masking the detergent micelle, revealing that R419 of H8 is in close proximity to the 
310–311 backbone of Gβ (Fig. S6b). Furthermore, the structure suggests that additional 
electrostatic contacts may be present between E412 of H8 and H171 of ICL1 with D312 of

 Gβ, K415 of H8 and D291 backbone of Gβ (Fig. 4d). In contrast to its G protein proximal 
face that displays polar residues, the membrane proximal face of H8 includes conserved 
bulky aromatic residues, consistent with our observation that this helix is found buried in the 
detergent micelle of the GLP-1:GLP-1R:Gs complex (Fig. S6b). We thus conclude that H8 is 
in close contact with the membrane, which may enhance receptor stabilization in the lipid 
bilayer.
The GLP-1R:GαsRas interface is primarily stabilized by both hydrophobic and polar 
interactions involving TM2, TM3-4, TM5–6 and the TM7-H8 junction of the receptor with 
α4-helix, α5-helix, αN-helix, and the beginning of β6-strand of GαsRas (Fig. 4). The 
carboxyl terminal GαsRas α5-helix overlaps the position of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 in 
the inactive state, explaining the requirement for TM6 opening in order to accommodate the 
G protein. The conformational transition of TM6 results in breaking up the highly conserved 
polar network within TM2-6-7-H842, thereby releasing R176 in TM2, N406 and E408 in the 
TM7-H8 junction. The cryo-EM density map suggests that these residues may be stabilized 
again in the GLP-1R:Gs complex through electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds with 
Q390 and E392 of the Gαs α5-helix (Fig. 4a).
Comparison with activated family A GPRCs
The only available structure of a GPCR:G protein complex to date is from the complex of 
heterotrimeric Gs with activated β2AR, a family A GPCR16. Structural superposition of 
GLP-1R:Gs with β2AR:Gs reveals that the G protein conformation is almost identical (Fig. 
S10a). The overall root mean square deviation in Gas between the two complexes is 
approximately 1.0 Å, with the main differences located adjacent to the AH domain that 
becomes delocalized in the absence of nucleotide in Gαs19. Gβγ in the GLP-1R:Gs 
structure positions closer to the receptor by ~2 Å, a spatial proximity facilitated through the 
interaction between H8-helix and Gβ.
Superposition of the TMDs in both G protein complexes shows that active GLP-1R and 
β2AR share similar folds in regards to the global conformation of the 7TM helices (Fig. 5a). 
One notable difference is the significantly longer α-helical extensions of TM2, resulting in 
the elevation of ECL1 that engages the C-terminal half of the peptide. Viewing towards the 
membrane plane from the extracellular side, we observe divergence in the position of the α-
helical tips of all TMs apart from TM3 and TM4 (Fig. 5b). This divergence primarily 
reflects the differences in the type of ligand engaging the receptor, with the larger peptide 
ligand requiring additional space for accommodation by the transmembrane bundle.
In contrast to the extracellular half, the TMs at the cytoplasmic half of activated GLP-1R and 
β2AR assume similar topology (Fig. 5c). Despite the sharp kink and unwinding in the 
middle of TM6 of GLP-1R compared to its preserved helicity in β2AR, the cytoplasmic 
ends reach the same position. Thus, both GLP-1R and β2AR form a similar cavity 
recognizing the C-terminal GαsRas α5-helix, consistent with the fact that for both receptors 
the interactions with the α5-helix are primarily non-polar and also involve some position 
equivalent residues, e.g. X3.50, X3.53, X5.65 and X6.36 (Fig. S10b–c). It is notable however, 
that even though the overall structural landscape is very similar, the molecular details of the

 recognition pattern on the receptor are very different between β2AR and GLP-1R (Fig. 
S10b–c). This observation also highlights some flexibility in the configuration of the 
GαsRas α5-helix, enabling it to form diverse interactions through the same set of C-terminal 
amino acids.
Implications for family B GPCR activation
The cryo-EM structure of the activated GLP-1R:Gs complex facilitates the integration of a 
large body of biochemical and biophysical data towards understanding the activation of 
family B GPCRs through peptide binding. Current evidence suggests that in the absence of 
ligand the NTD is mobile through flexibility in the linker connecting it to TM132, thereby 
increasing the probability of the initial recruiting interactions with the C-terminal region of 
the peptide. After an initial, high-affinity recruitment by the NTD, the captured peptide 
engages the 7TM region, with its N-terminal region establishing interactions with the 
transmembrane core. The structure shows that GLP-1 binding destabilizes the helicity of 
TM6 with simultaneous rearrangements in the central polar network of the TM bundle (Fig. 
6). This network facilitates the stabilization of the TM core and is positioned to detect 
peptide binding through potential interactions of R2.60b (K2.60b in GCGR) with residue E9 at 
the peptide N-terminus. The middle of TM6 includes the helically unstable Pro6.47b-X-X-
Gly6.50p motif, which appears to unravel as a consequence of TM7 bending due to steric 
hindrance with the bound peptide. While the resolution of the cryo-EM map does not allow 
us to clearly resolve the interactions in this region, our model suggests that the exposure of 
the carbonyl oxygens in the backbone of Pro6.47b-Leu-Leu6.49b enables interactions with 
polar residues in TM3,5,7 that stabilize the outwards opening of the cytoplasmic half of 
TM6. The rearrangement of TM6 subsequently breaks apart polar interactions of the 
conserved HETx and TM2-6-7-H8 network, thereby creating a cavity and releasing residues 
that engage the α5-helix of GαsRas. Thus, peptide binding at the extracellular surface is 
communicated to the intracellular receptor side and results in G protein engagement and 
activation.
Despite the diversity between family A and B GPCRs, we observe that both receptor types 
converge topologically in the cytoplasmic side. This structural similarity near the G protein 
coupling sites reflects a convergence of activation pathways, which has been highlighted in 
family A GPCRs43, and enables this large family of receptors to bind and get activated by 
very diverse ligands, but signal intracellularly via a small common repertoire of G proteins. 
While further work is needed to provide a detailed picture of activation pathways in different 
GPCR classes, we anticipate that the application of the rapidly evolving cryo-EM 
technologies will transform structural studies of these challenging proteins.

27 °C for 48 h before collection. Gs heterotrimer was purified as previously described16. 
Nanobody-35 (Nb35) was expressed in the periplasm of E. coli strain WK6, extracted, and 
purified by nickel affinity chromatography according to previously described methods16.
GLP-1R:Gs:Nb35 complex formation and purification
Sf9 cell pellets infected with virus containing GLP-1R were lysed in 10 mM Tris, pH7.6, 1 
mM EDTA, 4 mg/ml Iodoacetimide, 2.5 mg/ml Leupeptin, 0.16 mg/ml Benzamidine. The 
sample was centrifuged at 200g for 7 minutes to get rid of un-disrupted cells and large cell 
debris such as nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 37,800g for 25 minutes to 
collect the membranes. The membranes were washed by homogenization in 30mM Hepes, 
pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 100uM TCEP, 2.5 mg/ml Leupeptin, 0.16 mg/ml Benzamidine then 
collected by centrifugation at 37,800g for 25 minutes.
The GLP-1R:Gs complex was formed in membranes. The washed membranes were 
homogenized in 30mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 100uM TCEP, 2.5 mg/ml Leupeptin, 
0.16 mg/ml Benzamidine. For every 6 Liters of GLP-1R cell pellets, 10mg of Gs and 2mg of 
Nb35 were added, along with 1mM MnCl2, 10mM MgCl2, 10uM GLP-1 peptide, 4,000 
units λ-phosphatase, and 1 unit Apyrase. The sample was mixed overnight at 4 °C. The 
membrane sample with GLP-1R:Gs:Nb35 complex formed was collected by centrifugation 
at 37,800g, and then solubilized by in a buffer comprised of 1% DDM, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.2% 
Cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), 30 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 30% glycerol, 
25uM TCEP, 2.5 mg/ml Leupeptin, 0.16 mg/ml Benzamidine, and 1uM GLP-1. After 1 hour 
of solubilization, the sample was centrifuged at 37,800g to remove the insoluble debris. The 
supernatant was diluted 2-fold by adding the same volume of buffer without DDM, CHAPS 
and CHS. Then anti-FLAG M1 affinity resin was added and CaCl2 were added to final 
concentration of 2.5mM. After 2 hours of mixing, the M1 resin was collected by 
centrifugation at 200g and loaded into a column, and was extensively washed by FLAG-
wash buffer (30mM Hepes, pH7.5, 500mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 2.5mM CaCl2, 1uM 
GLP-1, 25uM TCEP, 0.1%DDM, 0.125%CHAPS, 0.02%CHS). The buffer was exchanged

1uM GLP-1, 100uM TCEP, 0.01% MNG, 0.01% GDN, 0.00192% POPG, 0.0012% 
cholesterol, and the fractions for monomeric complex was collected and concentrated 
individually for electron microscopy experiments.
Cryo-EM data acquisition
3.5 μL of purified hGLP-1:rGLP-1R:Gs complex at a concentration of ~1 mg/ml complex 
was applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil R2/2, 300 mesh), and 
subsequently vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI Company). The specimen was 
visualized with a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI) operating at 300 kV accelerating 
voltage, at a nominal magnification of 29,000X using a K2 Summit direct electron detector 
(Gatan, Inc.) in counting mode, corresponding to a pixel size of 1.0 Å on the specimen level. 
In total, 17,332 images with defocus values in the range of −1.5 to −3.0 μm were recorded 
with a dose rate of ~9.0 electrons per Å2 per second. The total exposure time was set to 10s 
with intermediate frames recorded every 0.2s, resulting in an accumulated dose of ~90 
electrons per Å2 and a total of 50 frames per movie stack.
Image processing and 3D reconstructions
A total of 14,600 dose-fractionated image stacks were subjected to beam-induced motion 
correction using MotionCor244. A sum of all frames, filtered according to exposure dose, in 
each image stack was used for further processing. CTF parameters for each micrograph were 
determined by CTFFIND445.
Particle selection, two-dimensional classification and three-dimensional classification were 
performed on a binned dataset with a pixel size of 2 Å using RELION46–48. 2,675,742 
particle projections were selected using semi-automated procedures and subjected to 
reference-free two-dimensional classification to discard false positive particles or particles 
categorized in poorly defined classes, resulting in 620,626 particle projections for further 
processing. An ab initio map generated with VIPER49 was used as initial reference model 
for maximum-likelihood-based three-dimensional classification. One stable class accounting 
for 139,299 particles showed detailed features for all subunits and was subsequently 
subjected to 3D refinement and reconstruction after subtracting densities for the mobile 
GαsAH domain and the detergent micelle from the raw micrographs. The final map has a 
global nominal resolution of 4.1 Å, with nominal resolution of 3.9-Å in the core region that 
includes GLP-1, TM and GαsRas α5 helix.
Reported resolutions are based on the “gold-standard” Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using 
the 0.143 criterion. All density maps were corrected for the modulation transfer function 
(MTF) of the K2 summit direct detector and then sharpened by applying temperature-factor 
that was estimated using post-processing in RELION. Local resolution was determined 
using ResMap50 with half-reconstructions as input maps.

 Model building and refinement
The initial template of rGLP-1R TM domain was derived from a homology-based model 
calculated by I-TASSER51. The crystal structure of GLP-1R NTD:GLP-1 complex (PDB ID: 
3IOL) and β2AR:Gs complex (PDB ID: 3SN6) were used as initial models for NTD-
hGLP-1 and Gs heterotrimer, respectively. All models were docked into the EM density map 
using Chimera52, followed by iterative manual adjustment and real-space refinement using 
COOT53 and fragment-based refinement with Rosetta54. Sequence assignment was guided 
by bulky amino acid residues such as Phe, Tyr, Trp and Arg. The final model was subjected 
to global refinement and minimization in real space using the module 
phenix.real_space_refine in PHENIX55. Model overfitting was evaluated through its 
refinement against one cryo-EM half map. FSC curves were calculated between the resulting 
model and the half map used for refinement as well as between the resulting model and the 
other half map for cross-validation (Extended Data Figure 4). The final refinement statistics 
are provided in Supplementary Information Table S2.

Side (a), extracellular (b) and cytoplasmic (c) views of the activated GLP-1R TM bundle 
(light green) in superposition to the inactive glucagon receptor bound to allosteric antagonist 
(not shown; PDB code: 5EE7, blue). Significant conformational changes are observed on the 
cytoplasmic face of TM5 and TM6. TM6 moves outwards by 18 Å as measured at the α-
carbon of Lys346, while TM5 moves a smaller distance by 7 Å when measured at the α-
carbon of Lys334. A notable difference on the extracellular side is TM2 extended by three 
helical turns stabilized by peptide ligand binding. The disordered extracellular loops (ECLs) 
in the inactive GCGR structure are stabilized and structurally ordered in the activated 
GLP-1R structure. d, Comparison of HETx motif networking (in stick, Wootten numbering 
in superscript) between inactive GCGR and active GLP-1R shows that the outwards 
movement of TM6 removes T6.42b from the polar network.

 Figure 4. GLP-1R interactions with Gs
a–b, The GαsRas α5-helix docks into a cavity on the intracellular side of the receptor TM 
bundle formed by the opening of TM helices 5 and 6. a, Gs interactions with the 
transmembrane core include polar and non-polar contacts. The recognition of Y391 of the 
α5-helix involves both a small hydrophobic pocket formed by L251, L356 and L359, and 
potential hydrogen bonding with H180 of the conserved polar network, equivalent to the 
E/DRY motif in family A GPCRs. b, Q384 and R385 of the α5-helix form a polar 
interaction network with the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM5, respectively. N338 of ICL3 
is in close proximity to R342 of α4-helix and C359 of β4-strand. c, Y250 of TM3 and T175 
of TM2 form a hydrogen bond constraining the conformation of ICL1 and ICL2 with respect 
to each other. E262 and Q263 at the intracellular tip of TM4 and S261 of ICL2 form polar 
interactions with the stretch Q31-Q35 of αN-helix. d, H171 of ICL1 participates in the 
electrostatic interaction network between E412, K415 and R419 of H8 with D312 and D291 
of Gβ (see also Figure S6b).

 Figure 6. Polar network rearrangements upon GLP-1R activation
Comparison of polar network arrangements in the inactive-state GCGR (PDB code: 5EE7; 
the coordinates for residue R2.46b were obtained from the crystal structure of apo-state 
GCGR) and active-state GLP-1R. GLP-1 binding results in the cytoplasmic half of TM6 
outward movement with simultaneous rearrangements of the central polar network. The 
rearrangement of TM6 breaks apart polar interactions of the conserved HETx and TM2-6-7-
H8 networks, releasing residues for interactions with the GαsRas α5-helix. Peptide ligand 
GLP-1, TM6 and GαsRas α5-helix are shown in ribbon and colored as previously. Polar 
network residues are shown in stick with Wootten numbering in superscript. The exposed 
backbone carbonyl oxygens of Pro6.47b-Leu-Leu-Gly6.50p are shown as red spheres.
