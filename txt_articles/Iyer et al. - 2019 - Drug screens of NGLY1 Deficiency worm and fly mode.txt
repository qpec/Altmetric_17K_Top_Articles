Abstract 
N-glycanase 1/NGLY1 Deficiency is an ultra-rare and complex monogenic glycosylation disorder 
that affects fewer than 40 patients globally. NGLY1 Deficiency has been studied in model 
organisms such as yeast, worms, flies and mice. Proteasomal and mitochondrial homeostasis 
gene networks are controlled by the evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator Nrf1, 
whose activity requires deglycosylation by NGLY1. Hypersensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor 
bortezomib is a common phenotype observed in whole animal and cellular models of NGLY1 
Deficiency. Here we describe unbiased phenotypic drug screens to identify FDA approved drugs, 
generally recognized as safe natural products and novel chemical entities that rescue growth and 
development of NGLY1-deficient worm and fly larvae treated with a toxic dose of bortezomib. 
We used image-based larval size and number assays for use in screens of a 2,560-member drug 
repurposing library and a 20,240-member lead discovery library. A total of 91 validated hit 
compounds from primary invertebrate screens were tested in a human cell line in a NRF2 
activity assay. NRF2 is a transcriptional regulator that regulates cellular redox homeostasis and it 
can compensate for loss of Nrf1. Plant-based polyphenols comprise the largest class of hit 
compounds and NRF2 inducers. Catecholamines and catecholamine receptor activators comprise 
the second largest class of hits. Steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs comprise the 
third largest class. Only one compound was active in all assays and species: the atypical 
antipsychotic and dopamine receptor agonist aripiprazole. Worm and fly models of NGLY1 
Deficiency validate therapeutic rationales for activation of NRF2 and anti-inflammatory 
pathways based on results in mice and human cell models and suggest a novel therapeutic 
rationale for boosting catecholamine levels and/or signaling in the brain.

Introduction 
NGLY1 Deficiency is the first congenital disorder of deglycosylation (CDDG) described in the 
biomedical literature (Lam et al., 2017; Enns et al., 2014). NGLY1 Deficiency has multi-organ 
presentation and clinical features in patients such as global developmental delay, a complex 
hyperkinetic movement disorder, small body size, seizures, and alacrimia. NGLY1 is an ancient 
gene encoding a cytosolic enzyme called N-glycanase 1 – also referred to as PNGase – which 
catalyzes the hydrolysis and release of N-glycans from N-glycosylated proteins (Suzuki et al., 
2016). NGLY1 is thought to function primarily in an evolutionarily conserved protein 
surveillance and disposal pathway called ERAD, or endoplasmic reticulum-associated 
degradation (Suzuki et al., 2015). NGLY1 also regulates the activity of specific glycoproteins by 
using deglycosylation as a post-translational on/off switch. Cellular models of NGLY1 
Deficiency have shown that the transcriptional regulator Nrf1 is a specific deglycosylation target 
of NGLY1 and that knocking out NGLY1 phenocopies knocking out Nrf1 (Tomlin el al., 2017). 
Only deglycosylated Nrf1 can be proteolytically processed into the mature nuclear-active form. 
Once in the nucleus, Nrf1 controls the expression of proteasomal subunit genes in response to 
protein folding stress in mammalian cells (Radhakrishnan et al., 2014), worms (Lehrbach & 
Ruvkun, 2016) and flies (Grimberg et al., 2011). In flies NGLY1 regulates the glycosylation 
status of the ortholog of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling ligand (Galeone et al., 
2017). Demonstrating the complexity of how loss-of-function mutations in the gene lead to 
pathophysiology in humans, NGLY1 regulates mitochondrial physiology in human and mouse 
fibroblasts and in worms through mechanisms that are still under investigation (Kong et al. 
2018). Interestingly, mitophagy defects caused by loss of Nrf1 function can be rescued by 
activation of the related transcriptional regulator NRF2, which controls the expression of genes 
involved in antioxidant and redox stress responses (Yang et al., 2018). 
 
In the five years since the publication of the first NGLY1 Deficiency diagnostic cohort of eight 
patients (Enns et al., 2014) multiple research groups have contributed to our understanding of 
disease-causing and loss-of-function mutations in the NGLY1 gene and its orthologs by 
generating and characterizing small and large animal models as well as patient-derived cell 
models. From this marketplace of disease models, a common phenotype emerged: 
hypersensitivity to proteasome inhibition by bortezomib (Fenteany et al., 1995). In worms, 
hypersensitivity to bortezomib toxicity was observed in an otherwise normally developing PNG-
1/NGLY1 null mutant, which has a half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) several

hundred times lower than wildtype worms (Lehrbach & Ruvkun, 2016). Using a chemically 
related proteasome inhibitor lacking the reactive boronic acid group, it was shown that mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts derived from NGLY1-knockout mice and NGLY1-knockdown human cell 
lines are several-fold more sensitive to carfilzomib toxicity compared to controls (Tomlin et al., 
2017). 
 
In an effort to phenotype and screen a homozygous loss-of-function Pngl/NGLY1 fly modeling 
the patient-derived C-terminal premature stop codon allele R401X, we showed that Pngl-/- 
homozygous mutant larvae are 25-fold more sensitive than heterozygotes to the toxic effects of 
bortezomib (Rodriguez et al., 2018). Another group reported that a Pngl RNAi-knockdown fly 
model of NGLY1 Deficiency has constitutively reduced expression of Nrf1-dependent 
proteasomal subunit genes, consistent with findings of hypersensitivity to bortezomib toxicity in 
the other models (Owings et al., 2018). Loss of NGLY1 causes intolerance to bortezomib that is 
as evolutionarily conserved as the underlying Nrf1-dependent proteasome bounce-back response 
because they go hand in hand. The prediction that has been confirmed so far only in mammalian 
cells is that NGLY1 and its orthologs Pngl in flies and PNG-1 in worms deglycosylate Nrf1 and 
its homologs cap ‘n’ collar in flies and SKN-1 in worms. We reason that small molecule 
suppressors of bortezomib will safely activate bypass pathways that rescue or compensate for 
loss of NGLY1 in a whole animal and will have a higher probability of exhibiting a favorable 
therapeutic index in mammals. 
 
We used our Pngl-/- fly model in a drug repurposing screen to identify compounds that rescue 
larval developmental delay (Rodriguez et al., 2018). Homozygote flies fail to thrive in the 
absence of any exogenous stressor or enhancer such as bortezomib. There are two limitations of 
our previous screen. First, flies homozygous for a patient-derived nonsense allele are extremely 
sick and only one fly-specific validated hit was identified – the insect molting hormone 20-
hydroxyecdysone. Second, flies homozygous for a patient-derived nonsense allele are further 
sickened by the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in which all test compounds are 
solubilized, and all stock solutions prepared. Therefore, drug screens were conducted at the limit 
of detection and a high false negative rate was due to under-dosing of test compounds. 
 
Here we addressed the shortcomings of the initial fly-only drug repurposing campaign. First, we 
discovered that the Pngl+/- heterozygote is two-fold more sensitive to bortezomib toxicity than

wildtype animals, it tolerates DMSO, and it has no detectable developmental delay. We 
hypothesize that it will be easier for a small molecule to suppress larval developmental delay in 
bortezomib-treated healthy heterozygotes versus constitutively sick homozygotes because 
otherwise healthy heterozygotes tolerate higher levels DMSO and thus allow for all test 
compounds to be screened at a five-fold higher concentration. Second, we extended the 
bortezomib intolerance results of Lehrbach & Ruvkun to a liquid-based, 384-well-plate 
quantitative worm larval growth and development assay for drug screening. We hypothesize that 
a two-species bortezomib-suppressor screen conducted in parallel would reveal hit compounds 
that target evolutionarily conserved disease modifiers and disease-modifying pathways. Third, 
we not only cross-tested all hit compounds from the primary worm screen in the fly assay, and 
vice versa, but we also cross-tested all hit compounds in two different worm assay paradigms 
(bortezomib treatment versus carfilzomib treatment), in two different fly assay paradigms 
(bortezomib treatment of heterozygotes versus homozygotes), and in a human cell NRF2 
transcriptional activity reporter assay. This cross-validation scheme generated a short list of 
generic drugs and nutriceuticals in which we had the highest degree of confidence of 
reproducibility and clinical trial actionability. Finally, we screened not only the same 
repurposing library as described in Rodriguez et al but also a ten-fold larger lead discovery 
library. We hypothesize that in some instances the same known mechanisms of action of 
repurposable drugs will be targeted by novel chemical entities, which serve as starting points for 
lead optimization toward a best-in-class clinical candidate.

High-throughput larval growth assays in worms 
Positive controls for all screens are png-1 mutants + DMSO (vehicle control) and the negative 
controls are png-1 mutants + DMSO + 205nM bortezomib. Both drug libraries were screened in 
triplicate with controls on each 384-well drug screening plate. Using the Echo550 (Labcyte Inc.), 
Bortezomib was acoustically dispensed into the destination plates the day before the worm larvae 
sort. 5µL of HB101 bacteria were dispensed into 384-well plates, containing S Medium in each 
well. Using the BioSorter (Union Biometrica), 15 L1 png-1 mutant larvae were sorted into each 
well, and plates were incubated at 20˚C while shaking. After five days of incubation, 15µL of 
8mM sodium azide was added to each well to immobilize worms prior to imaging in a custom 
worm imager. Finally, automated image processing was run on each plate.  
 
High-throughput fly larval growth assays 
Drug screens of Pngl heterozygous flies were conducted in the presence of 9µM bortezomib. The 
negative controls in the screen are Pngl heterozygous flies + DMSO + bortezomib and the 
positive controls are Pngl heterozygous flies + DMSO. Both drug libraries were screened in 
triplicate. Using the Echo550 (Labcyte Inc.), test compound was acoustically dispensed and 
standard fly food media (molasses, agar, yeast, propionic acid) lacking cornmeal, but carrying 
0.025% bromophenol blue was dispensed using a Multi-Flo (Bio-Tek Instruments) into each well 
of a 96-well plate. Then, the BioSorter was used to dispense Pngl heterozygous larvae, three per 
well. At three days post incubation with the compounds, the plates were scored for larval size 
rescue in a custom fly imager.  
 
High-throughput drug screening and analysis 
Hit compounds rescued worm development, i.e., increased the number of worms (total area taken 
up by worms) in the well. Therefore, the output of the image processing was worm area per well. 
Quality control was performed to ensure that the control well grew as expected, the png-1 
mutants are sensitive to bortezomib as expected, there are no obvious plate effects, and dispense 
errors were eliminated. We also manually verified each well by visual analysis after the unbiased 
quantitative analysis to make sure no false positives were counted as true hits. We count wells as 
hits that have a Z-score greater than 2 across all three replicates of the screen and were free of 
image artifacts.

Fly screening conditions were previously described (Rodriguez et al., 2018). Briefly, we imaged 
the plates using a custom fly imager and analysis tool to determine the area the larvae occupy per 
well. Then, we counted the number of larvae per well to normalize the total area per well data 
and identified suppressors of the phenotype. We also manually scored the wells for contaminants 
that may give false positives. 
 
Keap1-NRF2 activation luciferase reporter assay in O2OS cells 
We tested compounds using the PathHunter® eXpress Keap1-NRF2 Nuclear Translocation 
Assay (DiscoverX, San Diego). Briefly, PathHunter cells are plated and incubated for 24 hours at 
37°C. 10µL of test compound was added and cells were incubated with compound for 6 hours at 
room temperature. Working detection reagent solution was added and plates were incubated for 
60 minutes at room temperature. Chemiluminescence signal was read by a SpectraMax M3. 
 
Results 
 
Developing high-throughput bortezomib-modifier assays for nematode and fly larvae 
The nematode ortholog of NGLY1 is PNG-1. The strain used here is ok1654, which contains an 
800-base-pair deletion in the PNG-1 open reading frame resulting in a null mutant. We 
confirmed that ok1654 does not have an intrinsic growth defect but is markedly hypersensitive to 
bortezomib toxicity (Figure 1A). Bortezomib exacerbates the proteasomal stress that NGLY1-
deficient worms are already experiencing because of the concomitant loss of Nrf1 activity and 
results in an exaggerated disease phenotype, in this case early larval growth arrest (Lehrbach & 
Ruvkun, 2016). From the bortezomib dose-response curve we established that a png-1 null 
mutant is sensitive to bortezomib toxicity down to the low nanomolar range. After further 
optimization studies, we selected 205nM bortezomib as the concentration for the primary screens 
and for secondary retest and cross-test experiments to validate hit compounds. 
 
The ortholog of NGLY1 in flies is Pngl. We previously developed a Pngl-/- fly model based on a 
recurrent C-terminal nonsense allele found in NGLY1 patients, optimized a high-throughput 
larval size assay, and screened a 2,560-member drug repurposing library on Pngl-/- larvae 
(Rodriguez et al, 2018). That effort culminated in a single validated hit compound, 20-
hydroxyecdysone (20E). 20E is an insect-specific sterol-derived molting hormone. In order to 
identify clinically actionable hits, we increased the overall hit rate and robustness of fly screens.

We established a bortezomib toxicity dose-response curve for Pngl+/- heterozygote larvae and 
determined that these animals are two-fold more sensitive than wildtype animals (Figure 1B). 
After further optimization studies, we selected 9µM bortezomib as the concentration for the 
primary screens and for secondary retests and cross-tests to validate hit compounds. 
 
Worm repurposing screen and hit validation  
In the presence of 205nM bortezomib, png-1 null mutant worms arrest as L1 larvae while 
wildtype animals treated with the same dose of bortezomib develop normally. A worm 
repurposing hit is defined as a compound that rescued bortezomib-treated png-1 null worms such 
that their size and number were indistinguishable from control wells containing vehicle-treated 
png-1 null worms. All test compounds were screened at a final concentration of 25μM. Images of 
a representative positive control well and a representative negative control well, and two 
examples of wells containing suppressors and enhancers/toxic compounds are shown in Figure 
2A. The Venn diagram in Figure 2B summarizes the overlap of screening positives between 
three independent replicates. A total of 63 suppressors have Z-scores greater than two in all three 
replicates. The hit rate for worm suppressors is 63/2560 or 2.5%. A total of 51 enhancers have Z-
scores less than two in all three replicates. The hit rate for enhancers/toxic compounds is 51/2560 
or 2%. Enhancers/toxic compounds were not further investigated in this study. 60/63 worm 
suppressors were available for reorder as fresh powder stocks, retested in the primary bortezomib 
assay paradigm, and then scored in a secondary non-bortezomib assay paradigm. 
 
Some compounds can directly inactivate bortezomib which leads to a false positive result. For 
example, polyphenols and in particular polyphenols containing multiple catechols are known to 
form covalent adducts with bortezomib by boronate-catechol complexation (Glynn et al., 2015; 
Golden et al., 2009). In order to filter out those compounds, we tested the 60 worm suppressors 
on the png-1 null mutant treated with the chemically related proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib, 
which lacks the reactive boronic acid that renders bortezomib vulnerable to covalent attack. We 
established a carfilzomib dose-response curve for png-1 null mutant worms (Supplemental 
Figure 1). We directly compared these data to worms treated with 205nM bortezomib in order to 
determine at which concentration we observe comparable larval growth arrest. We retested all 60 
worm suppressors in the presence of 27.3µM carfilzomib, meaning carfilzomib is significantly 
less potent than bortezomib.

A total of 48/60 (80%) worm suppressors retested in the bortezomib assay paradigm. 15/60 
(25%) worm suppressors scored positively in the carfilzomib assay paradigm. Overall, 15/60 
(25%) worm suppressors rescued in both worm assay paradigms, i.e., in the presence of either 
bortezomib or carfilzomib. Those 15 compounds are the worm repurposing hits: aripiprazole, 
benserazide, ellagic acid, epicatechin monogallate, epigallocatechin-3-monogallate, 
ethylnorepinephrine, gossypetin, koparin, phenylbutazone, pomiferin, purpurogallin-4-carboxylic 
acid, quercetin, theaflavin monogallate, triamcinolone, and 3,4-didesmethyl-5-deshydroxy-3'-
ethoxyscleroin.  
 
10/15 (66%) worm repurposing hits are plant-based polyphenols. Epicatechin monogallate and 
epigallocatechin-3-monogallate are structural analogs, the latter containing an additional 
hydroxyl group. They are both abundant in tea leaves. The two plant flavonols quercetin and 
gossypetin are structural analogs, the latter containing an additional hydroxyl group. Quercetin is 
found in many foods and gossypetin is found is Hibiscus flowers. Aripiprazole, benserazide and 
ethylnorepinephrine act on catecholamine levels and/or signaling in the brain. Phenylbutazone is 
a decades-old first-generation non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, but is not 
currently approved and marketed in the United States. Triamcinolone is a synthetic corticosteroid 
and generic topical anti-inflammatory drug. 
 
Fly repurposing screen and hit validation 
In the presence of 9µM bortezomib, Pngl+/- flies are developmentally delayed as first-instar 
larvae. A fly repurposing hit is defined as any compound that in triplicate rescued bortezomib-
treated Pngl+/- larval growth and size such that they were indistinguishable from control wells 
containing DMSO-treated heterozygotes. All test compounds were screened at a final 
concentration of 32μM. Separation between positive and negative control wells is shown in 
Figure 2C. As expected, most test compound wells do not affect bortezomib-treated 
heterozygotes as determined by quantifying larval area per well and remain close to the negative 
control Z-score, (Figure 2D). We identified 31 fly suppressors that rescued larval size with Z-
score greater than 2.5 in at least two out of three replicates, yielding a hit rate of 1.2%, or half the 
hit rate of the worm repurposing screen (Supplemental Figure 2) but thirty times the hit rate of 
the previously published Pngl-/- drug repurposing screen (Rodriguez et al., 2018).

In order to eliminate suppressors that directly inactivate bortezomib or that fail to rescue in the 
absence of bortezomib-induced proteasomal stress, we retested suppressors in a 12-well petri 
dish assay at 0, 10µM, 50µM, 100µM of compound on either Pngl+/- larvae in the presence of 
bortezomib or Pngl-/- larvae without bortezomib. We could not retest suppressors in a 
carfilzomib assay paradigm because Pngl+/- larvae were resistant to carfilzomib toxicity at the 
highest concentration tested. Note in the DMSO-hypersensitive homozygous animals that we 
might not observe rescue at 100µM because of the increased amount of DMSO (0.2%) needed to 
test that concentration of compound. Although we did not confirm by chemical analysis, any 
compound that strongly rescued only in the bortezomib assay paradigm is likely a bortezomib 
inactivator. The top candidate bortezomib inactivators are tannic acid and gossypetin 
(Supplemental Material). Gossypetin contains two catechols per molecule and tannic acid 
contains five catechols per molecule. These two compounds are the only overlapping primary 
screening hits between the worm and fly repurposing screens. 
 
30/31 fly suppressors were reordered as fresh powder stocks (one compound failed to dissolve at 
10mM as stock solution). 21/30 (70%) fly suppressors retested in the primary heterozygote assay 
paradigm, which is comparable to the retest rate of worm suppressors. 20/30 (66%) fly 
suppressors scored positively in the secondary homozygote assay paradigm. 13/30 (43%) 
suppressors validated in both homozygote and heterozygote assay paradigms, which is higher 
than the worm cross-validation rate. Those 13 compounds are the fly repurposing hits: 
aminacrine, aripiprazole, β-Amyrin, butopyronoxyl, clindamycin, dyphylline, L-glutamine, 
ketorolac tromethamine, lumefantrine, promazine, pyrimethamine, quinizarin and thioguanosine.  
 
In contrast to the worm repurposing hits which fell into two pharmacological classes, the fly 
repurposing hits span a range of mechanisms, only one of which appears to be fly-specific, e.g., 
the insect repellent butopyronoxyl. Ketorolac is a first-generation NSAID class but is structurally 
distinct from the worm repurposing hit and NSAID phenylbutazone. β-Amyrin is triterpene 
natural product with anti-inflammatory effects. Aside from aripiprazole, the remaining fly 
repurposing hits appear to be mechanistic singletons and do not have obvious functional or 
structural analogs with worm repurposing hits. There are two antimalarial compounds, 
pyrimethamine and lumefantrine, and two DNA-damaging cancer drugs, aminacrine and 
thioguanosine. Dyphylline is a xanthine derivative with bronchodilator and vasodilator effects. 
Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic used for a range of bacterial infections.

Cross-validation of worm and fly repurposing hits 
In order to quantify the overlap between worm and fly repurposing hits, we selected 11 worm 
repurposing hits for cross-testing in both fly assay paradigms, and 19 fly repurposing hits for 
cross-testing in both worm assay paradigms. The fraction of worm repurposing hits that rescue in 
flies is higher than the fraction of fly repurposing hits that rescue in worms. 11/11 (100%) of 
worm repurposing hits scored positively in the fly heterozygote assay paradigm. 6/11 (55%) of 
these compounds cross-validated in both fly assay paradigms.  
 
However, 3/19 (16%) fly repurposing hits scored positively in the worm bortezomib paradigm. 
3/19 (16%) fly repurposing hits scored positively in the worm carfilzomib paradigm. Only 1/19 
(5%) fly repurposing hit cross-validated in both worm assay paradigms: aripiprazole. Of the 30 
repurposing hits that were cross-tested, seven compounds (23%) are active both worm assay 
paradigms and in both fly assay paradigms: aripiprazole, benserazide, phenylbutazone, 
pomiferin, quercetin, theaflavin monogallate and 3,4-didesmethyl-5-deshydroxy-3'-
ethoxyscleroin. Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 3. 
 
Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug approved for use alone or in combination in adults 
and children for the treatment of symptoms of many CNS diseases, including schizophrenia, 
autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Shapiro et al., 2003; Kikuchi et al., 1995). 
Aripiprazole has been available in generic form since 2015. Benserazide is an aromatic L-amino 
acid decarboxylase inhibitor which has been co-administered with levodopa (L-Dopa) for 
decades to boost dopamine levels in the brain in the treatment of Parkinson disease. As 
mentioned above, phenylbutazone is decades-old NSAID and quercetin is plant flavonol with 
complex pharmacology, including anti-inflammatory effects. Theaflavin monogallate is a 
polyphenol found in black tea leaves. Pomiferin is prenylated isoflavone found in osage orange 
trees. 
 
Drug discovery screens, secondary retests and cross-validation of novel hit compounds 
Using the same screening conditions and hit-calling analysis as the worm repurposing screen, we 
scaled up efforts with png-1 null mutant larvae and a 20,240-member lead discovery library. We 
identified 28 novel worm suppressors and 6 novel worm enhancers/toxic compounds with a 
combined hit rate of 0.143% (Figure 4A; Supplemental Material). Enhancers/toxic compounds 
were not further investigated in this study. 12/28 (43%) novel worm suppressors retested in the

bortezomib assay paradigm. 10/28 (36%) novel worm suppressors scored positively in the 
carfilzomib assay paradigm. A total of five novel worm suppressors (18%) validated in both 
paradigms, which is comparable to the cross-validation rate observed for worm repurposing hits. 
Consistent with the results of the repurposing screens, the fraction of novel worm suppressors 
that are active in flies is higher than the fraction of novel fly suppressors that are active in 
worms. 4/5 (80%) of novel worm suppressors cross-validated in both fly assay paradigms. 
 
Using the same screening conditions and hit calling analysis for the fly repurposing screen, we 
scaled up efforts with Pngl+/- larvae and a 20,240-member lead discovery library. We identified 
16 novel fly suppressors, resulting in hit rate of 0.07% (Figure 4B; Supplemental Material). 
15/16 novel fly suppressors were reordered as fresh powder stocks. 10/15 (67%) novel fly 
suppressors retested in the primary heterozygote assay paradigm. 13/15 (87%) novel fly 
suppressors scored positively in the secondary homozygote assay paradigm. A total of 10 novel 
fly suppressors (67%) validated in both paradigms. Of the 13 novel fly suppressors, 12 were 
retested in both worm assay paradigms. None of the novel fly suppressors scored positively in 
the bortezomib assay paradigm, but 8/12 (66%) compounds scored positively in the worm 
carfilzomib assay paradigm. 
 
The known NRF2 activator sulforaphane did not rescue in either worm assays but it did score 
positively in the Pngl-/- homozygote assay paradigm, rescuing this mutant to 50% of the control 
(Supplemental Material). In the most striking example of overlap between the repurposing 
library and discovery library, we identified two novel fly suppressors that are structural analogs 
of pyrimethamine, sharing a diaminopteridine group present in folic acid analog inhibitors of 
DNA synthesis enzymes, such as methotrexate. Both pyrimethamine and the two novel fly 
suppressors rescue homozygotes to near 100% of the heterozygote control. A second novel fly 
suppressor also rescues homozygotes to near 100% of the heterozygote control. 
 
Keap1-NRF2 activation assay in human cells 
A total of 91 repurposing hits and novel suppressors from both worm and fly screens were cross-
tested in a Keap1-NRF2 activation assay in the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line. 7/91 (8%) 
compounds are active up to a 30µM half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) cutoff (Table 
1). Listed here in order of percentage of maximal response normalized to the positive control

carboxylic acid (53%) = 3-methoxycatechol (50%) > rhamnetin (43%) > pyrimethamine (27%). 
Of these seven only fisetin has been previously shown to activate NRF2 target gene expression 
(Smirnova et al., 2011). To increase confidence in the assay, we also tested three additional 
known NRF2 inducers: sulforaphane, omaveloxolone and dimethyl fumarate. None of the novel 
lead worm or fly suppressors are NRF2 inducers.  
 
 
Discussion 
In summary, we demonstrated the therapeutic relevance of unbiased phenotypic drug screens of 
worm and fly models of NGLY1 Deficiency. We addressed the major shortcoming of our 
previous drug screening effort by increasing hit rate and reproducibility with the more 
permissive Pngl+/- heterozygote assay as the primary screen followed by a secondary retest in the 
more restrictive Pngl-/- homozygote assay paradigm, which selected for the subset of hit 
compounds that specifically rescues loss of NGLY1. We addressed the other significant 
shortcoming of our previous drug screening effort by including worms as a second species in the 
primary screening stage, which increased the total number and mechanistic diversity of hits. And 
by including human cells as a third species in the hit validation stage we selected for hit 
compounds that act on conserved targets and pathways. We identified three clinic-ready 
therapeutic approaches by focusing on the subset of hit compounds that rescue larval growth and 
development in both worms and flies and in the presence and absence of bortezomib: (1) NRF2 
activators/inducers; (2) catecholamine boosting drugs; (3) anti-inflammatory drugs. Only one 
compound was found to be active in all three species (worm, fly and human cells) and in all 
assay paradigms (plus bortezomib, plus carfilzomib, and NRF2 reporter): aripiprazole. 
 
Before discussing why we observed those three pharmacological classes and the evidence that 
supports their testing in clinical trials, we consider reasons why any given hit compound might 
be active in one or a combination of the species and assay paradigms tested herein. Some reasons 
have to do with compound stability, compound solubility, bioavailability, drug metabolism and 
pharmacokinetics, not to mention the differences between worm screens versus fly screens. The 
following is by no means an exhaustive list of salient factors. Worm screens were all performed 
in simple liquid media that is a buffered salt solution plus essential nutrients and contains 
bacteria as a food source. By contrast, the fly screens were performed in a nutrient-rich solid 
media (“fly food”) with a molasses base. The worm screen is a six-day assay that spans all stages

of the worm life cycle while the fly screen is a three-day assay that only spans the larval stages 
of fly development. The worm screen was performed with 205nM bortezomib while the fly 
screen was performed with 9µM bortezomib.  
 
Other reasons why a hit compound is active in one species but not the other may have to do with 
pharmacodynamics, that is the drug targets are not evolutionarily conserved or the drug binding 
sites of shared drug targets are too divergent between worm and fly orthologs. Resolving which 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables and their relative contributions explain the 
failure of a hit compound in any given assay or species paradigm is a very important research 
question that is beyond the scope of the present study. However, what we can conclude from this 
study is that NRF2, anti-inflammatory and catecholamine pathways are evolutionarily conserved 
between worms, flies and human cells.  
 
Indeed, NRF2 pathway activators and anti-inflammatory drugs have been proposed as clinical 
approaches to address the underlying defects in mitochondrial physiology observed in NGLY1-
deficient cells, specifically a defect in mitophagy and excessive mitochondrial fragmentation 
(Yang et al., 2018). In addition to its more well studied role as a transcriptional regulator of the 
proteasome bounce-back response, Nrf1 also controls the expression of mitochondrial 
homeostasis and mitophagy gene not only in human cells but also in worms (Paek et al., 2012) 
and flies (Tsakiri et al., 2013). A unifying theory of NGLY1 Deficiency is that disease 
phenotypes are primary or secondary consequences of the loss of conserved Nrf1-dependent 
gene expression programs in cell types and tissues that are vulnerable to proteotoxic, oxidative or 
redox stress. A recent n=1 clinical study of a NGLY1 patient who died of complications due to 
adrenal insufficiency suggest that steroidogenic secretory tissues fit the criteria of a vulnerable 
cell type (van Keulen et al., 2019). The Pngl-/- fly has defects in its physiologically analogous 
neuroendocrine tissues that fail to produce and secrete the cholesterol-derived hormone 20-
hydroxyecdysone (Rodriguez et al., 2018). 
 
Why do anti-inflammatory drugs rescue worm and fly models of NGLY1 Deficiency? Defects in 
mitophagy lead to release of mitochondrial genomic DNA and mitochondrial-encoded RNA 
from fragmented and damaged mitochondria into the cytoplasm drives constitutive STING and 
related innate immunity responses in NGLY1-/- mice and cell lines (Yang et al., 2018). These 
innate immunity pathways are conserved in flies (Martin et al., 2018) and worms (Wu et al.,

2014). We predict that mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy defects are present in cells 
and tissues of png-1 null mutant worms and Pngl-/- flies. Mitophagy defects and oxidative stress 
were in observed in SKN-1 mutant worms (Palikaras et al., 2015). We hypothesize that the 
steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that rescue worm and fly models of NGLY1 
Deficiency, e.g., phenylbutazone, are suppressing basally elevated innate immune responses. It’s 
tempting to speculate that hyperactive innate immunity responses contribute to larval growth 
arrest and developmental delay in NGLY1-deficient animals and that these anti-inflammatory 
responses are dampened by inhibitors of DNA synthesis, specifically purine biosynthetic 
enzymes targeted by the fly repurposing hits thioguanosine and the dihydrofolate reductase-like 
inhibitor pyrimethamine (Dziekan et al., 2019), and possibly the diaminopteridine-containing 
novel lead compounds that resemble pyrimethamine. Even more so because the same mechanism 
of action appears to have been revealed by parallel repurposing and discovery screens. 
 
At this time, catecholamine boosters are supported by measurements of reduced catecholamine 
precursors in the cerebral spinal fluid of NGLY1 patients (Lam et al., 2017), as well as the fact 
that an adult and wheelchair-bound NGLY1 patient has received the dopamine precursor 
levodopa. Future natural history studies of NGLY1 Deficiency should focus on catecholamine 
insufficiency as a potential driver or axis of pathophysiology. The effects of aripiprazole in 
worms depends on catecholamine pathway genes (Osuna-Lugue et al., 2018). In flies, 
aripiprazole was shown to reduce the levels of an aggregated polyglutamine-expanded mutant 
protein in a model of Machado-Joseph disease, or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Costa et al., 
2016). The mechanism of rescue appears to rely on activation of proteotoxic and antioxidant 
stress responses. It is tempting to conjecture that aripiprazole achieved its rescue effects in the 
Machado-Joseph fly model and in our NGLY1 Deficiency fly model by activating both NRF2 
and catecholamine pathways; and further that the unique polypharmacology of aripiprazole 
combines catecholamine pathway activation and NRF2 pathway activation.
