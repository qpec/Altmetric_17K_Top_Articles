research? Using qualitative evidence to
support guidance and guideline
development by the World Health

Abstract
Qualitative approaches are one of several methodologies utilised within the social sciences. New developments within
qualitative methods are widening the opportunities for using qualitative evidence to inform health policy and systems
decisions. In this commentary, we discuss how, in our work with the World Health Organization (WHO), we have
explored ways of broadening the types of evidence used to develop evidence-informed guidance for health systems.
Health systems decisions are commonly informed by evidence on the effectiveness of health system interventions.
However, decision makers and other stakeholders also typically have additional questions, including how different
stakeholders value different outcomes, the acceptability and feasibility of different interventions and the impacts of
these interventions on equity and human rights. Evidence from qualitative research can help address these questions,
and a number of WHO guidelines are now using qualitative evidence in this way. This growing use of qualitative
evidence to inform decision making has been facilitated by recent methodological developments, including robust
methods for qualitative evidence syntheses and approaches for assessing how much confidence to place in findings
from such syntheses. For research evidence to contribute optimally to improving and sustaining the performance of
health systems, it needs to be transferred easily between different elements of what has been termed the ‘evidence
ecosystem’. This ecosystem includes primary and secondary evidence producers, guidance developers and those
implementing and evaluating interventions to strengthen health systems. We argue that most of the elements of an
ecosystem for qualitative evidence are now in place – an important milestone that suggests that we are entering a
new era for qualitative research. However, a number of challenges and constraints remain. These include how to build
stronger links between the communities involved in the different parts of the qualitative evidence ecosystem and the
need to strengthen capacity, particularly in low and middle income countries, to produce and utilise qualitative
evidence and decision products informed by such evidence. We invite others who want to support the wider use of
qualitative evidence in decision processes to look for opportunities in their settings to put this into practice.

 The growing use of qualitative evidence to support
decisions, and the availability of methods that can help
us use this type of evidence in knowledge-to-action
cycles [1, 2], suggest that we are entering a new era for
qualitative research. Qualitative approaches are one of
many methodologies utilised within the social sciences.
Here we focus here on how new developments in the
field of qualitative research are creating important
opportunities for using qualitative evidence, including
findings from syntheses of qualitative evidence, to in-
form health policy and systems decisions.
Health systems are complex, creating challenges for
decision makers aiming to strengthen these systems and
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals [3]. Most
stakeholders agree, however, that decisions about which
interventions or policy options to implement should be
informed by the best available global and local evidence
[4, 5]. Within clinical care there is a long history of using
evidence-based guidelines to inform decisions. However,
evidence-based health systems guidance is a more recent
development. Health systems guidance has been defined
as “systematically developed statements produced at glo-
bal or national levels to assist decisions about appropri-
ate options for addressing a health systems challenge in
a range of settings and to assist with the implementation
of these options and their monitoring and evaluation”
[6]. Health systems guidance can address issues such as
options for funding national lay health worker pro-
grammes; which digital interventions might effectively
support health care delivery; and ways of retaining
health care providers in rural areas.
In our work with the World Health Organization
(WHO) we have explored ways of broadening the types of
evidence that are used to develop health systems guidance
[7, 8]. While questions of effectiveness are central to health
systems decisions, decision makers also want to know more
about how different stakeholders value different outcomes,
the acceptability and feasibility of different interventions
and the impacts of these interventions on equity and hu-
man rights [6, 7, 9]. Evidence from qualitative research can
play a key role in addressing these considerations [8]. This
is because well-designed qualitative research allows us to
explore how people experience and conceptualise the world
around them, including health systems and services; and
can help us understand how and why these systems suc-
ceed or fail. For instance, a recent qualitative study of intro-
ducing and implementing humanised childbirth care in a
referral hospital in Benin highlighted some of the chal-
lenges experienced by midwives and other health care
providers in delivering such care, and developed a concep-
tual model of humanised care in this setting [10]. This
primary study was, in turn, incorporated into a qualitative
evidence synthesis (or systematic review of qualitative
studies) of factors that influence the provision of childbirth
care by skilled birth attendants in low and middle income
countries [11]. This synthesis subsequently informed a
WHO statement on skilled health personnel providing care
during childbirth [12]. In addition to the WHO, a range of
other organisations involved in producing guidance and
health technology assessments are also increasingly using
qualitative evidence to answer questions related to, for in-
stance, the acceptability and feasibility of interventions.
These organisations include the National Institute of Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom [13,
14], the Swedish Public Health Institute and the South Afri-
can Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Task Team [15].
One example of the use of qualitative evidence to in-
form WHO guidance is the recent set of WHO recom-
mendations on ‘Antenatal care for a positive pregnancy
experience’ [16]. These include recommendations on
health systems interventions to improve the quality of
antenatal care and women’s use of this care. To ensure
that women’s perspectives shaped the development of
this guidance, the WHO first commissioned a qualitative
evidence synthesis that gathered studies from across the
world exploring what women want, need and value in
pregnancy [17]. The WHO used this synthesis when de-
termining the broader aims of the guidance and the key
outcomes to be considered when gathering evidence and
making recommendations. For instance, the concept of a
“positive pregnancy experience” became the core focus of
the guidance as a means of ensuring that person-centred
health and well-being was prioritized. Also, the outcome
“positive pregnancy experience” was included for most
guidance questions, ensuring that each intervention was
evaluated against this key issue for women. Following the
scoping stage of the guidance, the WHO commissioned a
second qualitative evidence synthesis to explore factors
influencing women’s use of antenatal services [18]. These
findings fed into the guidance process by answering
questions about the acceptability and feasibility of the
interventions to women and other stakeholders. A num-
ber of other recent WHO guidelines have used similar
approaches [19–21].
The growing use of qualitative evidence to inform
decision making has been facilitated by a number of
key developments in the field, including better standards
for reporting primary qualitative studies [22, 23]; robust
methods for undertaking qualitative evidence syntheses
[24]; databases for rapidly identifying such syntheses within
the health field [25, 26]; the emergence of GRADE-CERQ-
ual - an approach for assessing how much confidence to
place in findings from qualitative evidence syntheses [27,
28]; and frameworks that facilitate the packaging of differ-
ent types of evidence to facilitate transparent and system-
atic assessment by decision makers [29, 30]. The challenge
now is to mainstream these efforts so that qualitative evi-
dence, ideally from syntheses of primary qualitative

 studies, is used more widely to develop health systems
guidance and clinical guidelines within WHO and
within other guideline development organisations. In
our experience, one important constraint includes
identifying teams to conduct policy-relevant qualita-
tive evidence syntheses, particularly in low and middle
income countries. We also need to explore further
how to help members of guideline panels and other
decision makers engage with different types of evi-
dence and make judgements about these when formu-
lating recommendations. In addition, we need to
expand efforts to strengthen capacity in low and mid-
dle income countries to undertake health policy and
systems relevant primary qualitative research.
For research evidence to contribute optimally to improv-
ing and sustaining the performance of health systems, it
needs to be transferred easily between different elements of
what has been termed the ‘evidence ecosystem’ [31–33].
This ecosystem includes those producing primary evidence
and those synthesising the evidence; people producing
evidence-informed decision products such as health sys-
tems guidance and clinical practice guidelines; those re-
sponsible for implementing evidence-informed options
within health systems, including programme managers and
decision makers; and those involved in delivering and using
health services, including service providers, service users
and citizens [31]. Recent developments within the field of
qualitative research, including those described above, mean
that we now have most of the elements of an ecosystem for
qualitative evidence in place. Evidence from primary quali-
tative studies is now being gathered in evidence syntheses;
the findings of these syntheses are being used in decision
products such as guidance and policy briefs [34, 35]; and
decision products informed by qualitative evidence are
being used to guide choices on health system options and,
in turn, are informing choices by service providers and
users. Finally, these health system strengthening initiatives
are being evaluated through new primary qualitative re-
search [36, 37]. In addition, we now have a better under-
standing of how primary qualitative research should be
designed to meet the needs of those synthesising research
and decision makers.
Having the elements of a qualitative evidence ecosystem
in place is an important milestone and suggests that we are
entering a new and exciting era within the field of qualita-
tive research. Of course, a number of challenges and
constraints remain, as we have noted earlier. Other chal-
lenges include how to build stronger links between the
communities involved in the different parts of the qualita-
tive evidence ecosystem, including across all sectors rele-
vant to the Sustainable Development Goals [3], and the
need to strengthen capacity across settings and institutions,
particularly in low and middle income countries, to pro-
duce and utilise qualitative evidence and decision products
informed by such evidence. Our experience of working with
the WHO has helped us to collaboratively develop methods
for using qualitative evidence in guideline and guidance
development. We realise, however, that we are also not yet
making full use of the potential of qualitative evidence
synthesis findings to shape the development of implemen-
tation considerations for guidance or to inform guidance
contextualisation, adaptation and implementation processes
at national and sub-national levels. This is in part because
we need to explore both ways of integrating these findings
with local evidence [4], including the knowledge and ex-
perience of local stakeholders, and approaches for working
with local stakeholders to develop implementation options.
Efforts are also needed to strengthen the capacity of local
stakeholders to understand and use qualitative evidence.
These are areas in which we and others are now doing
methodological research.
As we take this work forward, we should also not for-
get what is perhaps the most important role that qualita-
tive evidence can play in decision-making: representing
the views and experiences of stakeholders, including vul-
nerable and marginalised groups who are often not rep-
resented directly. By drawing on the global body of
qualitative evidence, qualitative evidence syntheses have
the potential, when used together with direct stake-
holder engagement, to help ensure that decisions are
guided by stakeholders’ views and that these decisions
do not widen inequities. As we have noted elsewhere,
using qualitative evidence in this way may also contrib-
ute to increased transparency and accountability in pub-
lic decision-making [27].
Our experiences of working with the WHO have taught
us that the best way of learning is doing. We support
Health Systems Global’s efforts to promote both primary
and secondary social science research on health policies
and systems, and to strengthen capacity and collaborations
in this area [38]. However, we need to go further than pro-
ducing more social science research that is policy relevant
and is conducted in ways that address the tensions and
complexities involved in commissioning and undertaking
research across different settings and groups [39, 40]. As a
social science research community, we also need to work
more closely with policy users and other stakeholders to
build capacity for evidence use. We therefore invite others
who believe that we need greater recognition of the value
of qualitative research, and who want to support the wider
use of qualitative evidence in decision processes, to look for
opportunities in their settings to put these beliefs into
practice.
