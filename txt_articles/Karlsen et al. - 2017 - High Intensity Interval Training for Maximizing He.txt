Abstract 
Regular physical activity or exercise training are important actions to improve cardiorespiratory fitness 
and maintain health throughout life. There is solid evidence that exercise is an effective preventative 
strategy against at least 25 medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, 
colon and breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Traditionally, endurance exercise training (ET) to 
improve health related outcomes has consisted of low- to moderate ET intensity. However, a growing 
body of evidence suggests that higher exercise intensities may be superior to moderate intensity for 
maximizing health outcomes. The primary objective of this review is to discuss how aerobic high-
intensity interval training (HIIT) as compared to moderate continuous training may maximize 
outcomes, and to provide practical advices for successful clinical and home-based HIIT.

Epidemiological Evidence of the Importance of High Exercise Intensity for Mortality Reduction  
Epidemiological evidence on all-cause and disease- specific mortality demonstrates that low- and 
moderate intensity exercise is associated with protection against chronic diseases, especially 
cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD),1-3 and that risk reduction can be achieved at quite low volumes of 
exercise.4 For instance, the Nurses’ Health Study found that moderate intensity activity, even as little 
as once a week, was sufficient to reduce mortality risk by 22%.5 Another study involving 55 137 
healthy adults found that running, even as little as 5 to 10 minutes per day, was associated with 
markedly reduced risks of death from all causes and from CVD.6 In addition, “weekend warrior” and 
other physical activity (PA) patterns characterized by one or two sessions per week may be sufficient 
for significantly reducing all-cause-, CVD-, and cancer mortality risks.7, 8 A meta-analysis of 
prospective cohort studies on leisure time PA found marked risk reduction in all-cause mortality in 
active subjects compared to sedentary persons.9 Specifically, a dose-response curve was found, 
especially from sedentary subjects to those with mild and moderate PA level. A growing body of 
evidence however suggest that exercise involving high-intensity may induce larger health benefits 
relative to the time spent on PA, and that even small amounts of vigorous PA increases the benefits of 
moderate PA alone.10, 11 A recent Australian study found an inverse dose-response relationship 
between proportion of vigorous PA and mortality,12 leading to the conclusion that “vigorous activities 
should be endorsed in clinical and public health activity guidelines to maximize the benefits of PA”. To 
this end, a large study from Taiwan demonstrated that 15 minutes of daily vigorous intensity PA 
resulted in similar all-cause mortality risk reduction (~25%) as 60 minutes of daily PA at moderate 
intensity.13 Similarly, our research group found that one single weekly bout of high intensity (~90% of 
peak heart rate) exercise was associated with a similar or higher protection against premature all-
cause and CVD mortality compared to several hours of moderate intensity exercise.8 Finally, a meta-
analysis involving 459 833 participants free from CVD at baseline concluded that walking pace was a 
stronger independent predictor of overall mortality risk compared with walking volume (48% versus 
26% risk reductions, respectively), 14 indicating the impact of high exercise intensity to promote 
mortality risk reduction.

Exercise Intensity in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk Reduction 
Substantial evidence has established the significance of high levels of PA, exercise training (ET), and 
overall cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), not only for mortality benefits, but also for prevention and 
treatment of CHD.15 Two studies found an inverse association between the relative intensity of PA and 
risk of developing CHD, independent of the amount of total PA performed.16, 17 Long-term aerobic ET 
conducted at higher intensities is associated with a reduced risk of future CVD compared to lower 
intensities, suggesting that the former may confer greater cardioprotective benefits.18, 19 Swain and 
Franklin examined the role that ET intensity has on the risk factors for and incidence of CHD;20 they 
included both epidemiologic studies that evaluated the benefits of PA of varying intensity levels, and 
clinical trials with ET at different intensities, while controlling for the total energy expenditure. The 
epidemiological findings showed greater reduction in risk of CHD with high- compared to moderate 
intensity PA and more favorable risk profiles for individuals engaged in high-, as opposed to moderate 
intensity PA.20 The clinical trials generally reported greater improvements after high- compared to 
moderate intensity ET for diastolic blood pressure (BP; DBP), glucose control, and aerobic capacity, 
but reported no intensity effect on improvements in systolic BP (SBP), lipid profile, or body fat loss. 
The authors concluded that, if the total energy expenditure of ET is held constant, ET performed at 
high intensity appears to induce greater cardioprotective effects than exercise at moderate intensity.20 
A recent study found that high intensity ET had greater influence on most of the components of the 
metabolic syndrome compared to equivalent energy expenditure of moderate intensity ET.21   
 
Cardiorespiratory fitness and Exercise Intensity 
Although PA levels are strongly associated with reduced all-cause mortality,22 the association appears 
to disappear after adjustment for CRF.23, 24 There are clear indications that low CRF is a CVD risk 
factor distinctly from PA,25 that higher levels of CRF protects against CVD- and all-cause mortality,26-28 
and that positive changes in CRF reduces CVD risk factors,29 as well as all-cause mortality.30 In fact, 
CRF is found to be a more powerful predictor of mortality than traditional risk factors, such as 
hypertension (HTN), smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (T2D).31 Peak oxygen 
consumption (VO2peak) measured objectively during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to 
exhaustion, is considered the gold-standard measure of CRF, because it is an integrated measure of

the body’s ability to take in, transport and utilize oxygen to fuel aerobic work.32 Directly measured 
VO2peak is a strong independent predictor of mortality,33, 34 and improving VO2peak is found to improve 
prognosis. Vanhees et al.35 measured VO2peak before and after a 3-month ET period in 417 CHD 
patients and followed them for a mean duration of 6.2 years. Oxygen uptake increased by 33% after 
the training period. During the total follow-up of 2,583 patient-years, 37 patients died; CVD mortality 
was inversely related with changes in CRF, with a 1% increase in VO2peak after ET associated with a 
2% decrease in CVD mortality.35 Given the prognostic value of changes in VO2peak, it would be 
important to know how to effectively improving CRF. There is epidemiological evidence that PA at high 
intensity is associated with substantially higher VO2peak. For instance, Norwegian men reporting ~49 
minutes/week of very-vigorous intensity (defined as >90% of VO2peak) measured almost 6 ml·kg-1·min-1  
higher VO2peak compared to those exercising at moderate intensities (~70% of VO2peak).36 Moderate 
intensity exercise performed for more than 216 minutes/week resulted in VO2peak levels that were 
about 3.5 ml·kg-1·min-1 (1 metabolic equivalent, MET) lower than 49 minutes of weekly very-vigorous 
PA. Similar findings were observed in women. A recent meta-analysis of 55 randomized controlled 
trials among CHD and heart failure (HF) patients showed that trials with higher average exercise 
intensity achieved greater improvements in VO2peak.37 Specifically, each 10% increase in exercise 
intensity was associated with a 1 ml·kg-1·min-1 improvement in VO2peak. There was no strong evidence 
to support any other intervention-, patient- or trial factors to be predictive of the heterogeneity in the 
CRF response. Altogether, this points to exercise intensity rather than duration or frequency of 
exercise, as the most important variable in determining CRF. 
 
Essentials of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) 
Interval ET with HIIT may be a particularly effective way for increasing VO2peak and improve CV health 
compared to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). The terminology used to describe HIIT 
unfortunately varies across research groups. Here we use the definition suggested recently using HIIT 
when the intervals’ are of aerobic character and the target intensity is between 85-95% of peak heart 
rate (HRpeak),38 with a distinction to more sprint interval training (SIT), using low-volume supramaximal 
(i.e. all-out performance) ET.39 The principle of HIIT is based upon high intensity aerobic ET bouts (but 
still at an intensity below VO2peak) that are separated by periods of lower intensities that allow for 
recovery, making an individual able to reengage in high-intensity ET (Figure 1). Typically, HIIT is

performed in activities involving dynamical work with large muscle mass (such as brisk uphill walking, 
running or cycling), at intensities close to peak heart rate (HRpeak: 85-95%) or VO2peak (80-90%) for 4 
minutes. The recovery periods consist of walking or “jogging” at considerably lower intensities (60-70% 
of HRpeak of the intensity during the high-intensity interval) for approximately 2-3 minutes.38 It is 
important to note that the ET intensity is relative to the individual’s VO2peak and HRpeak and that every 
participant needs to be tailored individually such that two subjects exercising next to each other may 
look very different, one running very fast and the other walking, although they both are exercising at 
the same relative intensity. The differences stem from different CRF levels, but they would be 
experiencing the same relative exercise stress. This is illustrated in Figure 2 where two individuals with 
different CRF levels and HRpeak (Olympic athlete and CHD patient) have performed 4x4 minutes HIIT 
with the aim of reaching 90-95% of HRpeak. They possess widely different absolute heart rates 
(beats/min) and energy consumptions; however, they exercise at identical relative intensity 
(percentage of HRpeak). This also raises the point that HRpeak (preferably as close as possible to the 
individual’s true maximal heart rate HRmax) ideally should be measured for each individual before 
engaging with HIIT, in order to control the relative ET intensity properly. The training HR could then be 
monitored during the course of the HIIT program in order to adjust the absolute workload so that the 
relative exercise intensity remains constant as exercise capacity improves. However, if exercise 
testing prior to interval training is not possible, a rule of thumb is that the relative strain during the 
work-bouts should be perceived as 16-18 on the Borg scale,40 i.e. heavy breathing without getting too 
stiff in the legs. In addition, one should aim to maintain the chosen workload during all the repeated 
intervals during a HIIT session. If unable to maintain exercise intensity throughout the exercise 
session, a too high starting workload has been chosen. If a fifth or sixth interval is easily manageable 
after having completed the prescribed 4x4 minute intervals, a too low exercise intensity has been 
chosen. In addition, if the 3 minutes active recovery period feels very short, exercise intensity is likely 
too high and may interfere with the ability to complete a 4x4 minute HIIT session. If the three-minute 
active brake feels too long, a too low exercise intensity has been chosen. A typical HIIT session 
consists of 4x4 minutes interval, but HIIT can well be performed as 4x5 minutes, 3x5 minutes, 5x3 
minutes, or something similar. Importantly, as illustrated in Figure 1 & 2, the increase in HR during 
HIIT occurs gradually during the first 1-3 minutes of the intervals. Typically, it takes longer time to 
reach 90% of HRpeak during the first interval. Reaching 90% of HRpeak at the end of the first 4-minute

interval is normal, and an acceptable performance. In the continuation of the interval session, the aim 
is to reach higher in the target heart rate zone, 1-3 minutes into the intervals (as illustrated by the 
gradual increase in heart rate from intervals 1 – 4 in figures 1 and 2). It is crucial to avoid “sprinting” 
exercise to reach target intensity exercise zone as soon as possible and allow for good dynamic 
working conditions. The ET mode used during HIIT may thus be important. Uphill walking or running 
facilitate good dynamical work for most individuals, and the pace is actually rather slow. It is 
noteworthy that peak exercise during stationary biking normally produces 10-15% lower VO2peak 
compared to treadmill walking or running.41 If a CPET is performed before training, it is therefore 
crucial to test HRpeak/VO2peak in the specific exercise mode used during ET. However, testing of VO2peak 
is not of vital importance before performing interval training. It is more desirable to test HRpeak, but also 
that is not a prerequisite. One may instead reach the targeted intensity zone of 85-95% HRpeak guided 
by that one should be breathing heavily without being able to hold a conversation going, but still be 
able to continue for the whole 4-minute period, and 16-18 on the Borg scale of perceived exertion. 
 
HIIT for Improving CRF in Health and Disease 
In a clinical setting, HIIT is found to be an effective way of performing high intensity ET and developing 
a high level of CRF.42 In most cases, the studies have shown that ET using HIIT compared to MICT is 
more effective for improving health outcomes (VO2peak, ventricular function, endothelial function, quality 
of life).43 A meta-analysis of 28 trials confirmed that both MICT and HIIT elicit large improvements in 
VO2peak of healthy, young to middle-aged adults with the effects being greater for the less fit 42. 
Importantly, when comparing the two modes of training, the gains in VO2peak were greater following 
HIIT. In most single center studies, HIIT has been found more beneficial for improving VO2peak in 
healthy individuals,44, 45 HF,43, 46-49 CHD,43, 50, 51 heart transplant recipients,52 individuals with the 
metabolic syndrome,53 HTN,54 obese individuals,55 and in patients with T2D.56 On the other hand, a 
recent randomized study found that HIIT was not superior to other forms of endurance ET during 
cardiac rehabilitation (CR).57 Two larger multicenter studies in CHD58 and HF patients with reduced left 
ventricle (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (HFrEF) 59 that were unable to reproduce the intensity difference 
outcomes found in single center studies supported this finding. However, a systematic review and 
meta-analysis including 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with lifestyle-induced 
cardiometabolic disease identified that HIIT gave larger adaptations than MICT.38 HIIT significantly

improved VO2peak by almost double that of MICT (19.4% vs 10.3%). The results also showed a variety 
of CVD risk factors adaptations occurring significantly more with HIIT compared with MICT including: 
BP; high density lipoproteins, triglycerides and fasting glucose, oxidative stress and inflammation, 
body weight, adiponectin, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function.38 The authors stated that this should 
translate into greater decreases in risks of morbidity and all-cause mortality (due to the power of CRF 
as a predictor of death). They further claimed that incorporation of HIIT into a CR program would be a 
more achievable way for people with chronic disease to reach a level of ET that promotes health-
enhancing benefits. In addition, from a practical point of view, it has been pointed out that in severely 
deconditioned patients, as for instance those with HF, normal PA of daily living actually corresponds to 
high intensity ET.60 Hence, using the same intensity during structured ET may in a short period of time 
increase these patients’ CRF level, making daily tasks less strenuous. Improvements in VO2peak have 
also been studied in two meta-analyses in CHD patients, where HIIT was found to be more effective 
than MICT for the improvement of both VO2peak
61, 62 and the anaerobic threshold,61 although MICT was 
associated with a more pronounced numerical decline in patients’ resting HR and body weight.62 No 
difference related to exercise intensity was however, found regarding CHD patients’ metabolic 
health.62 In a systematic review and meta-analysis in HF patients with preserved and/or reduced LV 
ejection fraction (EF) (LVEF), HIIT was found superior to MICT for improving VO2peak, while MCT was 
more effective in reducing body weight.63 Also among patients with HF, it seems that as ET intensity 
increases, so does the magnitude of improvement in CRF.64, 65 A meta-analysis involving seven 
studies in clinically stable HFrEF patients concluded that HIIT was more effective than MICT for 
improving VO2peak.49  
 
CV Adaptations to HIIT  
The observation that HIIT gives about twice the benefit of MICT regarding improvement of VO2peak
38, 66, 
67 may be of importance since VO2peak constitutes an important prognostic parameter for CVD 
morbidity and mortality.35, 68, 69 HIIT may also be required for a positive effect to occur on LV structure 
and function. Two studies in young, healthy individuals found HIIT effective for improving maximal 
stroke volume.44, 70 A study in patients with HTN found significantly improved stroke volume, LV end-
diastolic volume and EF, as well as HTN54 after HIIT compared to MICT. Our research group has 
previously identified several different patterns of response to programs utilizing HIIT or MICT in

patients with established CVD or dysfunction. In patients with CHD, HF and T2D, an attenuation of LV 
remodeling and systolic- and diastolic function were observed only after high-intensity ET.46, 56, 66, 67, 71 
In these RCTs, both strain rate and myocardial tissue imaging echocardiographic evaluation of 
ventricular function suggest that high-, but not moderate-intensity, ET improves parameters related to 
both systolic and diastolic LV function.46, 56, 71 In fact, 36 sessions of HIIT in HF patients reduced LV 
volume and diameter, increased LVEF and systolic and diastolic blood flow, as well as several systolic 
and diastolic motion parameters.46 Supportive to this, Fu et al.47 demonstrated improved pumping 
function with enhanced peak cardiac power index in HFrEF patients after HIIT [but not in HF patients 
with preserved EF (HFpEF)]. On the other hand, Iellamo et al.72 saw no difference in cardiac output, 
stroke volume, LVEF or VO2peak in HFrEF patients after HIIT and MICT, despite a 22% increase in 
VO2peak in both ET groups. No exercise HR or workload data was presented making comparison of 
exercise intensity and workload with other studies challenging. These findings were supported by a 
meta-analyses involving seven studies in clinically stable patients with HFrEF, which concluded that 
HIIT was not more effective than MICT for improving LVEF at rest.49 In the multicenter SMARTEX-HF 
study, LV end-diastolic diameter was significantly reduced after HIIT compared to the control group 
after 12 weeks of supervised ET; however, there was no difference between the HIIT and the MICT 
group.59 A key adaptation to HIIT in comparison to MICT is an increased maximal stroke volume.48, 73, 
74 In HFrEF patients, ET-induced increase in maximal stroke volume is associated with reduced 
resting LV end-diastolic volume,75 and increased LVEF and reduced total peripheral resistance.47 
Peak oxygen pulse, a surrogate measure of peak stroke volume, and an important prognostic marker 
in HFrEF,76 did not change after ET in the SMARTEX-HF (Baseline to 12-weeks median values; HIIT, 
11.6 to 12.3 ml·beats-1 and MICT, 11.0 to 12.3 ml· beats-1). As with VO2peak, there were no group 
differences in peak oxygen pulse.59 In the multicenter SAINTEX-CAD study, peak oxygen pulse 
increased in both the HIIT (14.8 to 16.6 ml·beats-1) and the MICT group (14.7 to 16.2 ml·beats-1) from 
baseline to 12 weeks; however there was no difference between groups.58 These two studies confirm 
a moderate central adaptation to ET, independent of ET intensity58, 59 as to be expected from 
comparable studies in HFrEF patients.47, 48 In these studies, it is unknown if peripheral limitations to 
ET, such as high degree of muscle wasting, limited patient’s ability to exercise at high intensity;60 
however, a large overlap in ET intensity between groups was seen in both studies and could be a key 
factor explaining no difference between groups.58, 59

Feasibility of ET Prescription of HIIT  
The few multicenter studies having compared HIIT against MICT in patients with CVD have highlighted 
the challenges of practical feasibility of HIIT in CR. In particular, adherence to ET intensity and 
continuously increasing ET workload throughout the ET period may seem challenging in multicenter 
studies, possibly also reflecting daily clinical practice.  
 
Importance of ET Intensity 
In the SAINTEX-CAD study, mean ET intensity was 88% in the HIIT group and 80% in the MICT 
group.58 In the SMARTEX-HF study, the median ET intensity was 90% of HRpeak in HIIT and 77% of 
HRpeak in MICT; however, in the HIIT group, 51% trained at lower intensity, whereas in the MICT group 
80% trained at higher intensity than prescribed and there were a large intensity crossover between 
groups and variability within groups.59 In comparison, Wisløff et al. report no challenges concerning 
adherence to target ET intensity (HIIT; 92-93% of HRpeak and MCT; 73-74% of HRpeak).46 The 
importance of ET intensity on exercise response is well documented in high- versus moderate intensity 
ET,50 but also within the HIIT zone.77 A recent analysis showed that CHD patients performing HIIT 
above 92% HRpeak had a ~2 ml·kg-1·min-1 larger increase in VO2peak compared to patients exercising 
below 92% after 12 weeks of exercise. The study further showed that higher intensity induced larger 
improvement in VO2peak, both with VO2peak as a categorical and a continuous variable.77 The low 
feasibility to ET intensity prescription in HIIT could be due to the patients’ ability and/or motivation to 
exercise at high intensity,78 or the challenges to implement the ET program in a multicenter setting. In 
CHD patients, coaching in combination with use of HR monitors were necessary to achieve exercise 
within target HIIT intensity zone. Without active coaching, patients chose to exercise below 85% of 
HRpeak, despite use of HR monitors and knowledge of target intensity.78 This may indicate that the 
implementation of HIIT might be more difficult than previously predicted. In addition, several of the 
previous single center studies have been performed using treadmill exercise, while a majority of the 
patients in the multicenter studies have been performed using biking as the mode of ET. The effect of 
biking versus walking or running exercise during HIIT thus needs to be further addressed, with 
potential differences in societies with a population more familiar with bicycling, as opposed to less 
trained with cycle exercise (e.g. European vs. United States).

Importance of Increasing Exercise Workload  
A key factor for any exercise response to occur over time is the principle of increasing exercise 
workload as training adaptation progresses. In the SAINTEX-CAD study, 12 weeks of ET increased 
peak workload by 38 watts in the HIIT group and 35 watts in the MICT group, respectively.58 In the 
SMARTEX-HF study, mean exercise workload increased from baseline to the end of the 12-week 
exercise intervention from 76 to 97 watts in HIIT, and 47 to 62 watts in MICT, while the control group 
increased workload from 52 to 62 watts. In comparison, Wisløff et al.46 reported an increase from 40 to 
135 and from 40 to 70 watts in HIIT and MICT, respectively. Similarly, Iellamo et al.72 reported an 
increase from 50 to 120 and from 45 to 95 watts after HIIT and MICT, respectively. This corresponds 
to an increase in exercise workload (watts) per exercise session in the SMARTEX-HF study of 0.28 
and 0.42 watts in MICT and HIIT59 and 0.97 and 1.05 watts in MICT and HIIT, respectively in the 
SAINTEX-CAD study,58 in comparison to 0.83 and 2.6 watts in Wisløff et al.46 and 1.2 and 1.7 watts in 
Iellamo et al.,72 respectively. Thus, the low increase in ET load in the SMARTEX-HF study, particular 
in the HIIT group, could explain the moderate exercise response, as well as no difference between 
MICT and HIIT.59 The lack of difference between groups regarding change in peak workload in the 
SAINTEX-CAD study supports this as well.58 All four studies trained patients for 12-weeks, with 3-5 
exercise session per week, and both Wisløff et al.,46 Iellamo et al.72 and Conraads et al.58 reported to 
systematically increase workload weekly to ensure training at prescribed workload throughout the 
study; however, a large variability in watt-increase is seen between the studies. The importance of 
systematical increase in ET workload was further illustrated in both the SMARTEX-HF and the 
SAINTEX-CAD studies by no added exercise response beyond expectations despite higher than 
prescribed ET intensity in the MICT groups.46, 58 The practical implications of the findings may be to 
keep a combined focus on both target ET intensity77 and a continuous progress in ET workload to 
secure sufficient relative exercise intensity as VO2peak improves throughout the exercise period. 
 
Key Practical Considerations for Successful HIIT 
Despite the challenges seen in multicenter studies to reach target ET intensity, HIIT is found to be 
feasible and effective for clinically stable CHD-patients across different modes of ET settings, even ET 
at home.79 Eighty-three participants (74 men/9 women, mean age 57) completed 12 weeks of HIIT 
twice a week, performed as either treadmill exercise, group-based exercise or home-based ET. The 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13 
 
preferred ET mode in the home-based group was uphill walking. Target exercise intensity was set to 
85-95% of HRpeak. The home-based ET program was unsupervised, and therefore started with two 
initial sessions with personal instruction where the patients learned how to perform HIIT and to use the 
HR monitors, including how to perform proper warm-up, execution of the high-intensity exercise bouts, 
and how to keep target HR during the intervention (adjustment of work load). The patients themselves 
administrated the HR-monitors for intensity guidance and documentation of ET. The results showed 
that, independent of group allocation, all participants achieved target HR with a mean ET intensity of 
90% of HRpeak during the last two minutes of each high-intensity bout in every ET session.79 What is 
then the key to successful clinical and home-based HIIT? Based on our clinical experience, we 
emphasize the importance of appropriate warm-up, adjustment of exercise workload, use of the Borg 
scale and correct measurement of HRpeak. 
 
Warm-up 
Warm-up is the period of preparatory exercise to enhance performance,80 and in patients with CHD 
and HF (and probably endothelial dysfunction), sufficient time for warm-up is crucial. Myocardial 
oxygen demand prevents arrhythmias, increases HR, and stimulates vasodilation. In our clinic, 
patients with CHD perform 10-15 minutes of aerobic ET at light to moderate intensity before the first 
bout of HIIT. With proper warm up, the risk of arrhythmias and ischemia is minimized 81, 82 and the 
ability to reach target HR within two-three minutes is facilitated. Additionally, we have experienced that 
exercising somewhat hard (approaching 85% of HRpeak) during the last minutes of warm up reduces 
the time to reach target HR in the first exercise bout. 
 
Workload 
The exercise workload is set according to the patient’s HRpeak. Instead of extrapolating exercise 
workload from the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the first exercise session(s) should be used to find 
the correct ET workload that will result in prescribed relative intensity (%HRpeak). A rule of the thumb is 
that after two-three minutes, the patient should be close to 90% of HRpeak. If not, workload should be 
increased if the HR is too low, or decreased if the HR is too high. Reaching target HR too fast may 
result in accumulation of lactate, making the person not able to finish the four-minute bout. Normally, it 
takes two-three minutes to reach the target HR in the first bout (in some patients up to four, and

thereafter the HR increases more rapidly for every bout performed (illustrated in Figure 2). The ET 
intensity during the pauses is aiming at 60-70% of HRpeak, an intensity where lactate removal is found 
effective, compared to passive breaks.83 Keeping the intensity at ~70% between the bouts also 
reduces the time to reach target HR in the subsequent bout. The last bout of HIIT is normally followed 
by a cool-down period. The purpose of cool-down is not only lactate removal but also to control for the 
decrease in HR and BP, thus reducing the risk of hypotension. Normally, this phase lasts 3-5 minutes. 
 
HRpeak 
Achieving a target HR of 90-95% during the last two minutes in the ET bouts is associated with 
improvement in VO2peak.77 However, the prerequisite to prescribe relative exercise intensity is a correct 
HRpeak-measurement obtained from a cardiopulmonary exercise test. To achieve near maximal effort, 
a proper warm-up is crucial, and exercise using large muscle groups is required, such as walking, 
running or cycling. Bicycle testing has a long tradition in the assessment of patients with CHD. 
However, cycle tests may give about 10-20% lower VO2peak (corresponding to ~5-15% lower HRpeak) 
compared to treadmill walking/running.84 In addition, if the test person is not familiar with cycling, local 
muscle fatigue will impair the test results. Hence, submaximal values are often used to prescribe ET 
intensity and the calculated exercise load is often too low. Figure 3 shows a CHD-patient performing 
three separate HIIT as cycling, treadmill walking and outdoor uphill walking, respectively, and 
demonstrate that cycling is less feasible to reach the target HR in patients not familiar with cycling. 
 
Safety of HIIT 
Even if ET is considered relatively safe,85 also for CVD patients,86 HIIT transiently elevates the risk of a 
CVD event in both young subjects with inherited CVD and adults with occult or diagnosed CHD.87 
However, no evidence suggests that the risks of exercise outweigh the benefits. Indeed, the converse 
appears to be true.87 In a prospective study of over 12 000 U.S. male physicians who were healthy at 
baseline, it was found that habitual vigorous ET diminished the risk of sudden death during vigorous 
exertion.88 Although the safety profile of HIIT has not been fully established yet, there is data 
demonstrating that in stable and selected patients, such ET can be performed with relatively low risk. 
Our research group examined the risk of CVD events during organized HIIT and MICT among 4846 
CHD patients in four Norwegian CR centers.89 Of a total of 175 820 ET hours, where all patients 
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

15 
 
performed both types of training in separate sessions, we found one fatal CVD arrest during MICT 
(129 456 hours of exercise) and two non-fatal cardiac arrests during HIIT (46 364 hours of exercise). 
There were no myocardial infarctions associated with exercise in the data material. As the number of 
HIIT hours was 36% of the number of MICT hours, the rates of events to the number of patient-
exercise hours were 1 per 129 456 from MICT and 1 per 23 182 from HIIT. The absolute event rates 
were thus very low after exposure to both types of ET. Even if the low event rates after exposure to 
both types of ET modes may give a glimpse regarding the risk, we believe that larger RCTs are 
needed to further evaluate the risk of HIIT among CHD patients. Still, due to the more extensive use of 
HIIT in CR worldwide, we believe that this study gives an indication about the risk of such ET for 
secondary CR. A recently published systematic review also evaluated the safety of HIIT.90 The 
investigators included 11 HIIT studies with 156 patients with cardiometabolic disease and found the 
incidence of adverse responses during or within 24 hours post exercise to be around 8%, ‘mild in 
nature’ and only ‘somewhat higher compared to the previously reported risk during MICT’. They 
concluded based on this that: “caution must be taken when prescribing HIIT to patients with 
cardiometabolic disease”. A review assessed the efficacy and safety of HIIT for HF patients.91 Despite 
documented benefits of HIIT in patients with CVD, including CHD and HF, the authors stated that 
currently there is still insufficient evidence to supplant a MICT approach with HIIT.  
 
Future Perspectives 
Most clinical HIIT studies yielding good results have been short-term and performed in a laboratory 
setting. The feasibility of longer-term HIIT in a real-world setting requires that important aspects 
essential for this type of ET are followed, so that it can be carried out in a simple and effective way, not 
only in small clinical trials but also in a broader scale. More studies regarding safety must be 
established before HIIT can be fully adapted as therapy for those with elevated cardiometabolic risk. In 
addition, RCTs showing that ET to improve VO2peak will lead to more and/or healthier years with social 
engagement are yet to be established. Such studies are demanded, and at least one has been 
initiated, involving more than 1500 elderly that are exercised using either MICT or HIIT, where the 
primary outcome is mortality.92 We believe that for over 2 billion physically inactive adults worldwide,93 
HIIT may constitute an effective and more efficient way of improving health and reducing mortality, 
particularly since a commonly cited barrier to PA is lack of time.94

Figure 1 
Figure 1 shows the principle of high intensity interval training (HIIT), that facilitates the execution of 
repeated high intensity aerobic work. The work-bouts are separated by ‘pauses’ of lower intensity 
exercise that allow for recovery, making an individual able to reengage in HIIT. Moderate intensity 
continuous training (MICT) on the other hand, is performed continuously over longer time, at lower 
exercise intensities.

Figure 2 shows two individuals performing high intensity interval training (HIIT). They have different 
absolute peak heart rate (HRpeak) and energy consumptions, but they exercise at identical relative 
intensity (% of HRpeak). Red line: HIIT performed as 4x4 minutes rollerski training by a highly trained 
Olympic athlete with a HRpeak of 188. Target HR zone is 169-179 beats/min (90-95% of HRpeak). Blue 
line: HIIT performed as 4x4 minutes outdoors uphill walking by a patient with coronary artery disease 
(CAD) with a HRpeak of 130. Target HR zone is 117-124 beats/min (90-95% of HRpeak).  
 
Figure 3 
Figure 3 shows one coronary heart disease (CHD) patient performing three separate high intensity 
interval training (HIIT) sessions as outdoor uphill walking, treadmill walking, and cycling, respectively. 
Cycling seems less feasible concerning reaching the target heart rate (HR) in patients not familiar 
with cycling. 
Case: Man, 56 years of age, BMI 26, undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), Blood 
pressure: 121/70 mmHg; Resting HR: 53 beats per minute (beats/min); Medication: Zelosok, 
Cordarone, Albyl E. On a preliminary testing day, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) took place 
on a treadmill, using an individualized walking ramp protocol, starting at 6.1 km/h with 5% 
inclination. After 2 minutes, workload was increased every minute with 3% increase in inclination, 
until exhaustion. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was 36 ml·kg-1·min-1 and peak heart rate (HRpeak) was 
130 beats/min. Target HR of 90-95% of HRpeak was calculated to 117-124 bpm. He had one supervised 
outdoor exercise session (walking/jogging uphill) where he was taught how to use the heart rate 
monitor (Polar 400) and how to reach target HR. Then the patient performed unsupervised HIIT in 
three different modes with at least three days apart: uphill walking (outdoors), treadmill walking, and 
cycling on a bike. Figure 3 shows the different HR-curves during the HIIT sessions. Walking resulted in 
significantly more minutes in the target exercise intensity zone (outdoor equally feasible as treadmill 
walking) compared to cycling. This example shows the importance of using the same exercise mode

at all centers in multi-center studies, and at the same time bear in mind, that cycling is less feasible 
to reach target HR in patients not familiar with cycling.
