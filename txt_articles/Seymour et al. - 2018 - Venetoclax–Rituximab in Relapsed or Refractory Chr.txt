BACKGROUND
Venetoclax inhibits BCL2, an antiapoptotic protein that is pathologically overexpressed 
and that is central to the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. We evaluated 
the efficacy of venetoclax in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or 
refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
METHODS
In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 389 patients to re-
ceive venetoclax for up to 2 years (from day 1 of cycle 1) plus rituximab for the first 
6 months (venetoclax–rituximab group) or bendamustine plus rituximab for 6 months 
(bendamustine–rituximab group). The trial design did not include crossover to venetoclax 
plus rituximab for patients in the bendamustine–rituximab group in whom progression 
occurred. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up period of 23.8 months, the rate of investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival was significantly higher in the venetoclax–rituximab group 
(32 events of progression or death in 194 patients) than in the bendamustine–rituximab 
group (114 events in 195 patients); the 2-year rates of progression-free survival were 84.9% 
and 36.3%, respectively (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.17; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.11 to 0.25; P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test). The benefit was 
maintained across all clinical and biologic subgroups, including the subgroup of 
patients with chromosome 17p deletion; the 2-year rate of progression-free survival 
among patients with chromosome 17p deletion was 81.5% in the venetoclax–rituximab 
group versus 27.8% in the bendamustine–rituximab group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 
0.05 to 0.29), and the 2-year rate among those without chromosome 17p deletion was 
85.9% versus 41.0% (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.32). The benefit of venetoclax 
plus rituximab over bendamustine plus rituximab was confirmed by an independent 
review committee assessment of progression-free survival and other secondary efficacy 
end points. The rate of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher in the venetoclax–
rituximab group than in the bendamustine–rituximab group, but the rates of grade 3 
or 4 febrile neutropenia and infections or infestations were lower with venetoclax than 
with bendamustine. The rate of grade 3 or 4 tumor lysis syndrome in the venetoclax–
rituximab group was 3.1% (6 of 194 patients).
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, venetoclax plus 
rituximab resulted in significantly higher rates of progression-free survival than 
bendamustine plus rituximab. (Funded by Genentech and AbbVie; ClinicalTrials.gov

elapsed or refractory chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia remains incurable, 
despite advances in treatment over the 
past 5 years.1-7 When disease progression occurs, 
especially after treatment with DNA-damaging 
agents, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells serial-
ly accumulate adverse biologic features and in-
creasingly develop resistance to therapies.8 Hence, 
additional treatments that have alternative mech-
anisms of action and that are effective and have 
an acceptable side-effect profile are needed.
The antiapoptotic protein BCL2, a key regula-
tor of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway,9 is consti-
tutively overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia cells; therefore, BCL2 represents a ra-
tional therapeutic target.10-12 Venetoclax, an orally 
administered, highly selective, potent BCL2 in-
hibitor,13 acts independently of TP53 to induce 
both high rates of response and good quality of 
response when administered as monotherapy to 
patients with heavily pretreated chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia, including patients who have ad-
verse features such as chromosome 17p dele-
tion.14-16 The combination of venetoclax with the 
CD20 antibody rituximab, an established com-
ponent of chronic lymphocytic leukemia thera-
py,17-19 was found to be able to overcome micro-
environment-induced resistance to venetoclax20; 
in addition, it has been shown to be not pro-
hibitively toxic and to have promising efficacy 
over venetoclax monotherapy.16,21 This combina-
tion can also clear all evidence of minimal re-
sidual disease (at a threshold of 1 tumor cell per 
104 white cells), a robust surrogate for long-term 
outcome.22-26
In the phase 3 MURANO trial, we compared 
venetoclax in combination with rituximab with 
a standard chemoimmunotherapy — bendamus-
tine in combination with rituximab — in patients 
with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia.1,27-29 We report results from the pri-
mary analysis, which was conducted when the 
protocol-specified criteria for the primary end-
point analysis were met.
Methods
Trial Conduct
This was an international, randomized, open-
label, phase 3 trial. The review board at each 
participating institution approved the trial pro-
tocol (available with full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). The trial was conducted in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Inter-
national Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines.30,31 All the patients 
provided written informed consent. An indepen-
dent data monitoring committee (whose mem-
bers are listed in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org) reviewed safety data peri-
odically and also reviewed the efficacy results 
of the planned interim analysis. An independent 
review committee, whose members were unaware 
of the treatment-group assignments, assessed all 
the patients for disease response and disease 
progression with the use of clinical data, imag-
ing, and bone marrow biopsies.
Trial investigators (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix for a list of the investigators) and em-
ployees of the sponsors (Genentech and AbbVie) 
designed the trial. The data were collected by the 
investigators, and the analyses were conducted 
by the trial statistician, who was employed by 
Genentech. All the authors vouch for the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the data and analysis 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
Each of the authors had access to the primary 
data, contributed to the preparation of the manu-
script, for which they had full editorial control, 
and made the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. Medical and editorial writing 
assistance was provided by medical writers at 
Envision Pharma Group, funded by F. Hoffmann–
La Roche.
Patients
Patients were eligible for the trial if they were 18 
years of age or older, had a diagnosis of relapsed 
or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia that 
required therapy,32 had received one to three 
previous treatments (including at least one chemo-
therapy-containing regimen), had an Eastern Co-
operative Oncology Group performance status 
score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher 
numbers indicating greater disability), and had 
adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic func-
tion (additional details of the eligibility criteria 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Patients who had received previous treatment 
with bendamustine were eligible provided that 
the duration of response after the treatment was 
at least 24 months.

Venetoclax–Rituximab in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Randomization and Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to receive venetoclax plus rituximab or benda-
mustine plus rituximab. Randomization was 
stratified according to the presence or absence 
of chromosome 17p deletion, responsiveness to 
previous therapy (details are provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix), and geographic region.
Venetoclax was administered according to a 
5-week schedule of a gradual increase in the 
dose (ramp-up) from 20 mg per day to 400 mg 
per day; prophylactic and monitoring measures 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) were 
instituted to mitigate the potential for develop-
ment of the tumor lysis syndrome.14 After com-
pletion of the dose ramp-up period for veneto-
clax, administration of rituximab (375 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area intravenously 
for the first dose [day 1 of cycle 1] and 500 mg 
per square meter intravenously thereafter [day 1 of 
cycles 2 through 6]) was initiated in 28-day treat-
ment cycles, while daily administration of vene-
toclax was continued. Administration of veneto-
clax at a dose of 400 mg per day was continued 
for 2 years (which was calculated from day 1 of 
cycle 1) unless disease progression or unaccept-
able toxic effects occurred sooner. Bendamustine 
at a dose of 70 mg per square meter was admin-
istered intravenously on days 1 and 2 of each 
28-day cycle for six cycles in combination with 
rituximab according to the aforementioned dos-
ing schedule.1 Crossover to treatment with vene-
toclax and rituximab after disease progression 
was not permitted, and therapy after the occur-
rence of disease progression was at the investi-
gators’ discretion.
Assessments and End Points
Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-
treat population, which included all patients who 
underwent randomization. The primary end point 
was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, 
which was defined as the time from randomiza-
tion to the first occurrence of disease progression 
or relapse or death from any cause, whichever 
occurred first. Secondary efficacy end points 
included independent review committee–assessed 
progression-free survival, investigator-assessed and 
independent review committee–assessed progres-
sion-free survival among patients with chromo-
some 17p deletion, the investigator-assessed and 
independent review committee–assessed overall 
response rate and complete response rate, over-
all survival, rates of clearance of minimal re-
sidual disease (to below the threshold of 1 tumor 
cell per 104 white cells), the duration of re-
sponse, event-free survival (defined as the time 
from randomization to the date of disease pro-
gression or relapse, death from any cause, or the 
start of a new therapy for chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia), and the time to the next treatment for 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Disease was assessed 
in all patients at baseline and at set times during 
the trial on the basis of the 2008 guidelines of the 
International Workshop on Chronic Lymphoid 
Leukemia (iwCLL) (Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix)32; assessments included immuno-
globulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene muta-
tion status, chromosome 17p deletion status, and 
TP53 mutation status,33,34 all of which were evalu-
ated centrally. Complete responses were con-
firmed by computed tomography and by bone 
marrow histologic analysis. Minimal residual 
disease status was assessed centrally in periph-
eral blood with the use of both an allele-specific 
oligonucleotide polymerase-chain-reaction assay 
and flow cytometry32 and also in bone marrow 
aspirate by flow cytometry (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that a sample of 370 patients with 
a total of 186 events of disease progression or 
relapse or death would provide the trial with 
80% power to detect a risk of disease progres-
sion or relapse or death that was lower by 34% 
(hazard ratio, 0.66) with venetoclax plus ritux-
imab than with bendamustine plus rituximab, at a 
two-sided alpha level of 0.05. These values would 
correspond to a median progression-free survival 
of 15.2 months in the bendamustine–rituximab 
group1 as compared with 23 months in the venet-
oclax–rituximab group. One prespecified interim 
analysis was to be performed after an aggregated 
140 investigator-assessed events of progression 
or relapse or death (i.e., 75% of the planned 
events for the final analysis) had occurred. At 
the time of data review on September 6, 2017, 
the independent data monitoring committee 
recommended that the primary analysis be con-
ducted at that time because the prespecified

statistical boundaries for early stopping were 
crossed for progression-free survival on the basis 
of stratified log-rank tests. Therefore, formal 
statistical testing of key secondary efficacy end 
points was subsequently performed with the use 
of a prespecified hierarchical approach (further 
details are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).35
Results
Trial Population
From March 31, 2014, to September 23, 2015, a 
total of 389 patients were enrolled at 109 sites 
in 20 countries and were randomly assigned to 
receive venetoclax plus rituximab (venetoclax–
rituximab group; 194 patients) or bendamustine 
plus rituximab (bendamustine–rituximab group; 
195 patients) (Fig. 1). The demographic and dis-
ease characteristics of the two groups were well 
balanced at baseline (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Across the two treatment groups, 
the median age was 65 years (range, 22 to 85), 
and a majority of the patients (73.8%) were men. 
In total, 92 of 342 patients (26.9%) who were 
assessed for chromosome 17p deletion status 
had chromosome 17p deletion, 99 of 376 pa-
tients (26.3%) who were tested for TP53 muta-
tion status had TP53 mutations, and 246 of 360 
patients (68.3%) who were tested for IGHV muta-
tional status had unmutated IGHV.
At the time of the data cutoff for the primary 
analysis (May 8, 2017), 78 of the patients in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group (40.2%) were still 
receiving venetoclax monotherapy. In the benda-
mustine–rituximab group, 154 patients (79.0%) 
had completed all six cycles of treatment. The 
median relative dose intensity (the proportion of 
administered doses relative to planned doses) 
was 97% with venetoclax and 100% with benda-
mustine. Exposure to rituximab was similar in 
the two treatment groups; both groups received 
the drug for a median of six cycles, and the me-
dian relative dose intensity in both groups was 
100%. In total, 68 patients (35.1%) in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group completed the scheduled 
2 years of treatment, of whom 56 had less than 
3 months of follow-up after cessation of veneto-
clax treatment.
All the patients in the venetoclax–rituximab 
group had a dose ramp-up period of 5 weeks, 
with the exception of 14 patients. These patients 
had a dose ramp-up period of 4 weeks to less 
than 5 weeks because they were enrolled before 
implementation of a protocol amendment that 
required a dose ramp-up period of 5 weeks.
A total of 7 patients in the bendamustine–
rituximab group did not receive any trial treat-
ment but were included in the efficacy analyses 
since they met the criteria for inclusion in the 
intention-to-treat population. In the venetoclax–
rituximab group, 7 patients never received ritux-
imab. Overall, 48 patients discontinued veneto-
clax prematurely: 15 during either the dose 
ramp-up period or the period during which they 
received combination treatment and 33 during 
the monotherapy phase after the combination-
treatment phase. Among the 36 patients (18.6%) 
who discontinued venetoclax prematurely for 
reasons other than disease progression or relapse 
or death, the median time to discontinuation 
was 10.0 months (range, 0.3 to 24.5). In the 
bendamustine–rituximab group, 34 patients, in-
cluding the 7 patients who never received treat-
ment, did not complete the six cycles of treat-
ment (Fig. 1, and Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Efficacy
After a median follow-up period of 23.8 months 
(range, 0.0 to 37.4), the median investigator-
assessed progression-free survival was signifi-
cantly longer in the venetoclax–rituximab group 
than in the bendamustine–rituximab group; the 
median progression-free survival was not reached 
in the venetoclax–rituximab group (32 events of 
progression or death in 194 patients) and was 17 
months in the bendamustine–rituximab group 
(114 events in 195 patients) (Fig. 2A). The 2-year 
rate of investigator-assessed progression-free sur-
vival was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
79.1 to 90.6) in the venetoclax–rituximab group 
and 36.3% (95% CI, 28.5 to 44.0) in the benda-
mustine–rituximab group (hazard ratio for pro-
gression or death, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.25; 
P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test). The re-
sults of the analysis of progression-free survival 
as assessed by the independent review commit-
tee showed a risk of disease progression or re-
lapse or death that was of similar magnitude to 
that seen in the analysis of investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival (Fig. S1 in the Supple-

Venetoclax–Rituximab in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
in the bendamustine–rituximab group among 
patients with chromosome 17p deletion (81.5% 
vs. 27.8%; hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.29) 
as well as among patients without chromosome 
17p deletion (85.9% vs. 41.0%; hazard ratio, 
0.19; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.32) (Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Results of analyses of pro-
gression-free survival according to chromosome 
17p deletion clone size (7 to 20% 17p deleted 
nuclei vs. >20% 17p deleted nuclei) are shown in 
Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Among 
the 36 patients who discontinued venetoclax 
prematurely for reasons other than disease pro-
gression or relapse or death, 55.6% remained 
progression-free at the last follow-up (median 
duration of follow-up after cessation of veneto-
clax, 5.24 months; range, 0.03 to 26.25).
The rate of independent review committee–
assessed complete response or complete response 
with incomplete hematologic recovery in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group as compared with 
the bendamustine–rituximab group was the first 
of the secondary end points to be tested hierar-
chically. The difference between the two groups 
was found not to be significant (8.2% in the ven-
etoclax–rituximab group and 3.6% in the benda-

0.08) (Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The independent review committee–assessed 
overall response rate was 92.3% in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group and 72.3% in the benda-
mustine–rituximab group (difference between the 
groups, 20.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 12.4 to 
27.6). The investigator-assessed overall response 
rate was 93.3% in the venetoclax–rituximab group 
and 67.7% in the bendamustine–rituximab group. 
Changes from baseline in lymph node size are 
shown in Figure S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. The rate of investigator-assessed com-
plete response or complete response with in-
complete hematologic recovery was 26.8% in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group as compared with 
8.2% in the bendamustine–rituximab group (Fig. 
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 68 pa-
tients across the two treatment groups who had 
a complete response or complete response with 
incomplete hematologic recovery according to 
investigator assessment, 50 patients were classi-
fied as having a partial response and 1 as having 
stable disease according to assessment by the 
independent review committee. The main reason 
for the discordance in the rates of investigator-
assessed and independent review committee–
assessed complete response or complete response 
with incomplete hematologic recovery was diver-
gent interpretation of residual adenopathy on 
computed tomography, specifically with respect 
to lesions measuring 30 mm or smaller, despite 
bone marrow clearance (Table S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Assessments of minimal residual disease were 
available for 366 patients (94.1%) on the basis of 
peripheral-blood samples and from 115 patients 
(29.6%) on the basis of bone marrow aspirate. At 
the 9-month time point (the time of the combi-
nation-treatment response assessment visit), the 
rate of clearance of minimal residual disease on 
the basis of peripheral-blood samples was high-
er in the venetoclax–rituximab group than in the 
bendamustine–rituximab group (121 of 194 pa-
tients [62.4%] vs. 26 of 195 patients [13.3%]). 
The rate was also higher in the venetoclax–ritux-
imab group than in the bendamustine–rituximab 
group at any time during the trial (162 of 194 
patients [83.5%] vs. 45 of 195 patients [23.1%]) 
(Table 1). The higher rate of clearance of mini-
mal residual disease in the venetoclax–rituximab 
group was also maintained over time (Fig. 4). At

assessment visit, minimal residual disease status

was predictive of subsequent progression-free sur-
vival (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Higher rates of clearance of minimal residual 
disease in the venetoclax–rituximab group were 
also seen in the assessment of bone marrow 
aspirate (53 of 194 patients [27.3%] in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group vs. 3 of 195 patients [1.5%] 
in the bendamustine–rituximab group) (Table S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
The rate of overall survival was higher in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group than in the benda-
mustine–rituximab group, with 24-month rates 
of 91.9% and 86.6%, respectively (hazard ratio, 
0.48; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.90) (Fig. 2B). Event-free 
survival was longer in the venetoclax–rituximab 
group than in the bendamustine–rituximab group; 
at 2 years, 84.9% of the patients in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group and 34.8% in the benda-
mustine–rituximab group were event-free (hazard 
ratio for disease progression, death, or initiation 
of new treatment for chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.25). The time to the 
next treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
was also longer in the venetoclax–rituximab group 
than in the bendamustine–rituximab group; at 2 
years, 90.0% and 52.1%, respectively, had not 
received a next treatment for chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia (hazard ratio for receipt of next 
treatment or death, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.31) 
(Figs. S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). A total of 3 patients (1.5%) in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group and 40 (20.5%) in the 
bendamustine–rituximab group received target-
ed chronic lymphocytic leukemia therapies, such 
as B-cell receptor signaling and BCL2 inhibitors, 
after disease progression occurred (Table S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
The reporting period for adverse events was lon-
ger in the venetoclax–rituximab group than in 
the bendamustine–rituximab group owing to the 
longer duration of treatment with venetoclax. At 
the time of the data cutoff, the median duration 
of exposure to venetoclax was 22.1 months (range, 
0.1 to 27.9). Overall, 379 patients (99.2%) had at 
least one adverse event: all 194 patients (100.0%) 
in the venetoclax–rituximab group and 185 pa-
tients (98.4%) in the bendamustine–rituximab 
group. The most common adverse event of any

grade in both treatment groups was neutropenia 
(60.8% of the patients in the venetoclax–ritux-
imab group and 44.1% of the patients in the 
bendamustine–rituximab group) (Table S10 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Adverse events of 
grade 3 or 4 were reported in 82.0% of patients 
in the venetoclax–rituximab group and in 70.2% 
in the bendamustine–rituximab group. Neutro-
penia was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse 
event, with a higher incidence in the venetoclax–
rituximab group than in the bendamustine–
rituximab group (57.7% vs. 38.8%); however, the 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia and 
of grade 3 or 4 infections or infestations was 
lower in the venetoclax–rituximab group (Table 2). 
Events of neutropenia (of any grade) also ac-
counted for most of the adverse events that led 
to dose interruption in the venetoclax–rituximab 
group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix); 
the median duration of neutropenia with a high-
est grade of 3 was 8 days (range, 1 to 712), and 
the median duration of neutropenia with a high-
est grade of 4 was 8 days (1 to 212). In total, 
47.9% of the patients in the venetoclax–ritux-
imab group and 43.1% of the patients in the 
bendamustine–rituximab group received growth 
factor. Grade 3 or 4 tumor lysis syndrome was 
reported in 6 patients (3.1%) in the venetoclax–
rituximab group and in 2 patients (1.1%) in the 
bendamustine–rituximab group (Table 2, and 
Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Clinical tumor lysis syndrome was reported by 
the investigator in 1 patient in each treatment 
group: a patient in the bendamustine–rituximab 
group had grade 4 acute renal failure and a pa-
tient in the venetoclax–rituximab group had a 
transient increase in creatinine (grade 2) that oc-
curred during the 4-week dose ramp-up period 
(the patient was enrolled before implementation 
of the 5-week dose ramp-up schedule) (see the 
Supplementary Methods section and Table S12 
in the Supplementary Appendix). All other cases 
of the tumor lysis syndrome were based on 
changes in laboratory values only. The rate of 
grade 3 or 4 infections and infestations was 
lower in the venetoclax–rituximab group than in 
the bendamustine–rituximab group (17.5% and 
21.8%, respectively).
The incidence of serious adverse events was 
similar in the two groups (Table 2). Richter’s 
transformation (i.e., conversion into an aggres-
sive lymphoma, typically diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma) was confirmed in 6 patients in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group and in 5 patients 
in the bendamustine–rituximab group. Adverse 
events that resulted in death were reported in 
5.2% of the patients in the venetoclax–rituximab 
group and in 5.9% of the patients in the benda-
mustine–rituximab group (4 fatal infections or 
infestations in each group) (Table 2, and Table 
S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
The primary analysis of the phase 3 MURANO 
trial of venetoclax plus rituximab in relapsed or 
refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed 
a significantly higher rate of progression-free sur-
vival with venetoclax plus rituximab than with 
a standard chemoimmunotherapy, with benefit 
observed in all subgroups analyzed. Prespecified 
secondary efficacy measures, including the com-
plete response rate, the overall response rate, 
and overall survival, also showed consistent pat-
terns of clinically meaningful benefit with ven-
etoclax plus rituximab, with substantial rates of 
clearance of minimal residual disease on the 
basis of both peripheral-blood samples and bone 
marrow aspirate. This enhanced disease control 
was observed in a multinational setting, with a 
safety profile that included common but manage-
able myelosuppression.
Complete response rates were lower when re-
sponse was assessed by the independent review 
committee than when assessed by the investiga-
tor, owing to divergent interpretation of residual 
adenopathy on computed tomographic scans ob-
tained at set, comparable time points in the two 
treatment groups. Guidelines regarding iwCLL 
response are being revised to include size criteria 
for pathologic lymph nodes and incorporation of 
an analysis of minimal residual disease status.26 
All 42 investigator-assessed complete responses 
in the venetoclax–rituximab group that were in-
consistent with the independent review commit-
tee assessment were associated with clear bone 
marrow biopsy results (i.e., findings that met 
the complete response criteria), and 37 of the 
patients were negative for minimal residual dis-
ease on the basis of peripheral-blood samples at 
either that time point or the subsequent visit. 
Although the achievement of a complete response 
has been shown to lead to a longer duration of 
response and longer overall survival than achieve-

Before the initiation of a trial drug, only serious adverse events that were considered to have been caused by a protocol-
mandated intervention were reported (e.g., serious adverse events related to invasive procedures, such as biopsies). After 
the initiation of a trial drug, all adverse events, regardless of the relationship to the trial drug, were reported through 28 
days after the last dose of trial drug (a maximum of 2 years for the venetoclax–rituximab group) or through 90 days after 
the last dose of rituximab, whichever was longer. After this period, investigators were to report any deaths, serious ad-
verse events, or other adverse events of concern that were believed to be related to previous treatment with the trial drug.
†  
A higher percentage of new-onset events of neutropenia occurred during the combination-treatment period than during 
the venetoclax monotherapy phase (54.1% vs. 11.1%). Protocol-mandated dose interruption for all grade 3 or 4 events 
of neutropenia occurred in 43.3% of the patients in the venetoclax–rituximab group. In total, 47.9% of the patients in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group and 43.1% of the patients in the bendamustine–rituximab group received growth factor.

Additional information on the events of the tumor lysis syndrome can be found in Table S12 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.

Two serious adverse events of pneumonia that resulted in death occurred in patients who had both disease progression and 
confirmed Richter’s transformation (i.e., conversion into an aggressive lymphoma, typically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
sidual disease that were observed in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group exceed those previously 
attained with other agents and combinations of 
agents in trials of relapsed or refractory chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lym-
phoma,7,37 findings that suggest that greater ef-
ficacy results can be attained by replacing che-
motherapy with venetoclax than by adding other 
targeted agents to chemoimmunotherapy.7 Clear-
ance of minimal residual disease on the basis of 
peripheral-blood samples was reached by month 
4 and was generally durable in the venetoclax–
rituximab group. Longer follow-up is required to 
evaluate the duration of benefit after discontinu-
ation of therapy, but previous findings indicate 
that disease control endures among patients 
who are negative for minimal residual disease 
on the basis of bone marrow aspirate after treat-
ment with venetoclax plus rituximab.21 Given the 
fixed duration of treatment with venetoclax, the 
potential for a treatment-free period exists for pa-
tients with relapsed or refractory chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia.
No new safety events were observed in either 
treatment regimen.7,21 Neutropenia is a known 
on-target effect of venetoclax,38 and the higher 
rates of grade 3 or 4 events that were observed 
in the venetoclax–rituximab group as compared 
with the bendamustine–rituximab group were 
not unexpected,39 especially given the longer du-
ration of treatment with venetoclax. Nonethe-
less, infections and infestations in the veneto-
clax–rituximab group were uncommon. It is 
possible that events of neutropenia that resulted 
in the dose modifications of venetoclax (which 
were mandated by the trial protocol if an event 
of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred) may be 
mitigated with improved guidance on the man-
agement of neutropenia with granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor. The relatively small number 
of patients in the venetoclax–rituximab group 
who had the tumor lysis syndrome shows the 
effectiveness of the risk-mitigation procedures 
that were implemented during the trial and the 
generally safe delivery of the treatment in a multi-
national trial.
In conclusion, among patients with relapsed 
or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ven-
et 
oclax in combination with rituximab resulted 
in a markedly higher rate of progression-free 
survival than standard bendamustine in combi-
nation with rituximab. The substantial rate of 
clearance of minimal residual disease in the 
venetoclax–rituximab group may indicate im-
proved disease control over a longer term even 
when therapy is discontinued. Additional follow-
up will be needed to assess the durability of such 
responses.
