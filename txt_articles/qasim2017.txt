Autologous T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptor against the B cell antigen CD19 (CAR19) are
achieving marked leukemic remissions in early-phase trials but can be difficult to manufacture, especially in infants
or heavily treated patients. We generated universal CAR19 (UCART19) T cells by lentiviral transduction of non–
human leukocyte antigen–matched donor cells and simultaneous transcription activator-like effector nuclease
(TALEN)–mediated gene editing of T cell receptor a chain and CD52 gene loci. Two infants with relapsed refractory
CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia received lymphodepleting chemotherapy and anti-CD52 serotherapy,
followed by a single-dose infusion of UCART19 cells. Molecular remissions were achieved within 28 days in both
infants, and UCART19 cells persisted until conditioning ahead of successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
This bridge-to-transplantation strategy demonstrates the therapeutic potential of gene-editing technology.
INTRODUCTION
Despite extensive preclinical advances, to date, there has been very
limited application of DNA nucleases for therapeutic gene editing
(1). Here, we describe first-in-human use of transcription activator-
like effector nuclease (TALEN) gene-edited T cells in two infants with
refractory relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and
the successful induction of molecular remission ahead of allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).
Autologous T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen recep-
tors (CARs) against leukemia antigens such as CD19 on B cells can be
highly efficacious in refractory relapsed leukemia (2–8). In heavily
treated cancer patients, and especially in infants, it is not always pos-
sible to manufacture an effective therapeutic product (9). In some cir-
cumstances, it may be possible to use donor T cells from human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell donors as part of a transplant strategy (10, 11), but the CAR
T cell manufacturing process is still bespoke and time-consuming.
Access to CAR T cell therapies is still relatively limited, and wider
application requires specialized manufacturing facilities, expertise,
and logistical support to collect, manipulate, and deliver cells.
Alternative approaches using off-the-shelf therapies derived from non-
matched donors are highly attractive but must overcome critical HLA
barriers as well as homeostatic competition from the host T cell com-
partment. Crucially, HLA-disparate T cells must evade host-mediated
immunity and deliver antileukemic effects without graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD). Lymphodepletion of recipients reduces homeostatic
T cell competition and minimizes the risk of host-mediated rejection
of allogeneic cells (12). Immunosuppressive agents such as fludarabine
and cyclophosphamide may be combined with antibody therapies
such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) or antithymocyte globulin
(ATG). Notably, serotherapy used during conditioning can persist
for many weeks and can affect incoming donor lymphocyte infusions
(13). Genetic disruption of CD52 expression through gene editing of
T cells was designed to allow infused cells to evade the depletion effects
of alemtuzumab. With simultaneous editing of T cell receptor genes to
reduce the risk of GVHD, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating
a “universal” CAR T cell bank. Here, we report the successful appli-
cation of such cells targeting CAR19 in two HLA-mismatched infants
with relapsed refractory B-ALL.
RESULTS
TALEN-engineered CAR19 T cells
We used TALENs to disrupt the CD52 gene, the target antigen of
alemtuzumab, in T cells transduced to express a CAR against CD19
(CAR19) (Fig. 1A). This was designed to enhance survival in the pres-
ence of the anti-CD52 lympodepleting antibody. At the same time, we
used a second TALEN pair to target the constant region of the T cell
receptor a chain (TRAC), thereby disrupting cell surface expression of
the ab T cell receptor (TCRab). These manipulations were performed
at high efficiency as a multiplex operation by electroporation of TALEN
mRNA into lentiviral-transduced CAR19 T cells (14). Residual TCRab
T cells were stringently removed by CliniMACS magnetic bead deple-
tion to minimize the risk of GVHD (15). The vector configuration also
incorporated a 2A peptide–linked sort/suicide gene, RQR8, composed
of a 136–amino acid cell surface protein, which includes a CD34 epitope
for cell enrichment and the CD20 target epitope for rituximab for in vivo
depletion in case of adverse effects (16).
A bank of non–HLA-matched, universal, CAR19 (UCART19)
T cells was manufactured from a healthy female donor under Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions (Fig. 1B). Expression of
CAR19 was present on 85% of cells, and more than 64% of cells were
depleted of both TCRab and CD52 as shown on flow cytometric anal-
ysis. Further, after magnetic bead–mediated depletion of residual
TCRab cells, only 0.7% of cells had detectable cell surface TCR
(Fig. 1C). Additional subset analysis confirmed the presence of key

CAR19 (4g7) transgene linked by a self-cleaving peptide to RQR8, a sort/suicide molecule incorporating epitopes targeted by anti-CD34 (Qbend10) and anti-CD20 (rituximab)
antibodies. The vector used an internal elongation factor-1a (EF-1a) promoter and included a Rev-responsive element (RRE), central polypurine tract (CPPT), and mutated
woodchuck postregulatory element (WPRE). (B) Cryopreserved healthy volunteer donor (non–HLA-matched) nonmobilized leukapheresis harvest was the source of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells were thawed and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, transduced by a single round of lentiviral vector exposure, and then electro-
porated with TALEN mRNA targeting the TRAC and CD52 loci. Thereafter, engineered cells were expanded in a Wave Bioreactor 2/10, before stringent CliniMACS depletion of
residual TCRab T cells. The final product was cryopreserved in fixed-dose aliquots, and the cell bank was characterized in detail for sterility, potency, and replication-competent
virus. (C) We found a more than 85% expression of CAR19 by staining with anti-F(ab)2 antibody. This was notably higher than the expression of RQR8, detectable by anti-CD34
staining. We confirmed stringent depletion of TCRab, with less than 1% of T cells expressing CD3 and more than 64% also exhibiting a CD52-negative phenotype. The CD8
subset was well represented, and the presence of “naïve-like” phenotypes was confirmed by staining for markers CD45RA and CD62L. (D) NGS of TRAC and CD52 target site
sequences found a high frequency (>70%) of events consistent with NHEJ repair of double-stranded DNA scission. SSC, side scatter; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE,

 abnormal karyotype, and a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
probe targeting the TRAC locus detected rearrangements in around
4% of nuclei examined (fig. S1). This was consistent with previous stu-
dies that have detected translocations between TRAC and CD52 at fre-
quencies between 10−4 and 10−2 by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) (14). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected
on-target events indicative of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ; in-
sertions, deletions, and indels) at a frequency of >70% for both TRAC
and CD52 loci (Fig. 1D), and similar events at a frequency of <0.18% at
each of the 15 in silico–predicted off-target TALEN sites (table S1). The
batch was subjected to detailed release characterization, including
screening for replication-competent lentivirus and potency assessments
in a human/murine chimeric model. Therapy was provided for two in-
fants under the U.K. special license arrangements after institutional eth-
ical reviews. Both had relapsed refractory CD19+CD52− B-ALL and had
previously undergone hematopoietic allo-SCT but had subsequently re-
lapsed and failed other experimental interventions.
Subject 1
In June 2015, an 11-month-old mixed-race infant with high-risk
t(11;19) CD19+ infant B-ALL had suffered bone marrow relapse 3
months after receiving fludarabine (150 mg/m2), treosulfan (36 g/m2),
thiotepa (10 mg/kg), and ATG (60 mg/kg) in combination with an 8 of
10 mismatched (single HLA-A/DQ alleles) allo–hematopoietic SCT
from an unrelated male donor. Her disease had progressed with 70%
blasts in marrow despite treatment with blinatumomab, an experimen-
tal bispecific T cell engager (BITE) monoclonal antibody therapy (17).
After one dose of vincristine and asparaginase and 7 days of dexameth-
asone, there were still blasts in her bone marrow, and she received cy-
toreduction with fludarabine (total dose, 90 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide
(total dose, 1.5 g/m2), and alemtuzumab (total dose, 1 mg/kg) (Fig. 2A).
She received CAR19+ TCR− T cells (4.6 × 106/kg) in a single dose with-
out any immediate toxicity at a time when her bone marrow exhibited
persisting disease (fig. S2), as measured by two minimal residual disease
(MRD) markers (Fig. 2B). There were no infusion-related toxicities and
no evidence of cytokine release syndrome, with unperturbed concentra-
tions of key serum cytokines [interferon-g, tumor necrosis factor–a,
interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and IL-6] measured at frequent intervals for
28 days (fig. S3). Granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (GCSF)–
dependent recovery of neutrophils was noted by day 30, but this was
then followed by protracted multilineage cytopenia until a second allo-
SCT (Fig. 2A). Although the patient was profoundly cytopenic, molec-
ular chimerism studies in blood and marrow revealed an increasing
presence of well-demarcated third party (UCART19) cells, reaching
27% in marrow by 6 weeks, as well as low-level persistence of residual
recipient cells (3 to 7%) (Fig. 2C). There was sustained cytogenetic and
molecular remission from this time onward. Vector copy number
(VCN) was used to track UCART19 cells in blood and marrow (Fig.
2D), and when possible, this was supported by flow cytometry using
anti-F(ab) staining (fig. S4). Most UCART19 cells were CD4+ in both
blood and marrow (fig. S4A). Additional analysis at 8 weeks detected a
greater proportion of CD3+ than CD3− CAR19+ T cells, suggesting per-
sistence and expansion of residual TCR+ cells from the UCART19 in-
fusion (fig. S4B). Flow cytometric sorting of these lymphopenic samples
was technically challenging, and the purity of enrichment was limited to
around 70% based on variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) signa-
tures (Fig. 2E). The frequency of NHEJ events in these populations was
estimated after nested PCR amplification at the TRAC and CD52 loci to
be 18 to 27% and 64 to 73%, respectively (Fig. 2E). This provided ad-
ditional evidence of persistence of both TCR− and TCR+ cells and was
consistent with survival of gene-edited CD52-negative cells after alem-
tuzumab exposure. Grade 2 skin GVHD was confirmed by histology at
9 weeks (fig. S5) and was initially managed with topical steroids, but
because UCART19 cells were still detectable (by qPCR for VCN) after
rituximab (4 × 375 mg/m2), systemic steroids were subsequently
administered. The infant was then conditioned using ATG (total dose,
4.5 mg/kg), fludarabine (total dose, 120 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide
(total dose, 60 mg/kg), thiotepa (total dose, 5 mg/kg), and TBI (4 Gy)
ahead of a second TCRab cell–depleted allograft from the original mis-
matched unrelated donor to correct aplasia and accelerate reconstitution.
By 1 month after eradication of UCART19 cells and transplantation, the
child had full donor chimerism in blood and marrow and was at home
in complete remission. Molecular MRD markers have remained nega-
tive, and the infant is well 18 months after UCART19 therapy, with full
donor chimerism and normalized lymphocyte profiles.
Subject 2
A second female infant, aged 16 months and of Caucasian parents,
was treated using a similar protocol in December 2015. She had been
diagnosed at 4 weeks of age with high-risk congenital mixed lineage
leukemia (MLL)–rearranged B-ALL, for which she had received a
matched unrelated donor SCT after conditioning with treosulfan (total,
30 g/m2), fludarabine (total, 150 mg/m2), thiotepa (total, 10 mg/kg), and
ATG (total, 10 mg/kg) in January 2015 while in molecular remission.
Her leukemia relapsed in November 2015, with 78% blasts in marrow
but no evidence of central nervous system disease. There had been no
response to blinatumomab, and bone marrow after cytoreduction ex-
hibited 3% blasts. Lymphodepletion consisted of fludarabine (total dose,
150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (total dose, 120 mg/kg), and alemtuzu-
mab (total dose, 1 mg/kg) and was followed by single infusion of
CAR19+ TCR− T cells (4.0 × 106/kg ) (Fig. 3A). There were no acute
infusion-related toxicities, and a transient erythematous rash was im-
mediately responsive to topical steroids. Symptoms of irritability were
investigated in the third week after infusion, but cranial computed to-
mography imaging was unremarkable, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
was clear with normal protein and glucose. Laboratory investigations
confirmed the presence of UCART19 cells by flow cytometry, as well
as chimerism and VCN in peripheral blood at 2 weeks and in marrow
samples after 4 weeks during molecular remission (Fig. 3, B to D).
Notably, flow cytometric analysis found that all circulating UCART19
cells were CD3−CD52− by this latter time point (Fig. 3E).
The infant had donor-derived neutrophil recovery (confirmed to
be derived from the original transplant donor) and went on to have
a successful second allogeneic SCT from the same (10 of 10) donor
within 10 weeks of UCART19 therapy. This was undertaken after ri-
tuximab (375 mg/m2) therapy, followed immediately by conditioning
with ATG (total dose, 10 mg/kg), fludarabine (total dose, 120 mg/kg),
cyclophosphamide (total dose, 120 mg/kg), and TBI (2 Gy). Subse-
quent marrow examinations have been MRD-negative with un-
detectable UCART19 cells, and the child remains clinically well at
home, without evidence of GVHD, 12 months after therapy.
DISCUSSION
This therapeutic application of TALEN-engineered cells highlights the
feasibility and potency of gene-editing strategies for the delivery of an-
titumor immunity. The potential of CAR19 therapies has already been
demonstrated in the autologous (2–9) and HLA-matched allogeneic

 settings (10, 11), but the infrastructure and expertise required to produce
personalized cell products present challenges, and low T cell counts in
heavily treated individuals may preclude autologous approaches. An
alternative strategy using premanufactured, “off-the-shelf” engineered
T cells is highly attractive but must overcome HLA barriers in terms
of both host-mediated rejection and donor-derived alloreactivity.
We used TALEN-mediated cell engineering in combination with
lentiviral transduction to produce universally applicable CAR19
T cells, designed to target B cell leukemia, but >99% were depleted of
endogenous TCR and resistant to the effects of in vivo serotherapy
directed against CD52. This allowed their application in a third party
setting in two infants who had relapsed after conventional myeloablative

Fig. 2. UCART19 therapy and re-
sponse in subject 1. (A) Lymphodeple-
tion was administered to subject 1 over
a period of 7 days before UCART19 in-
fusion and was composed of fludara-
bine (F), cyclophosphamide (C), and
alemtuzumab (A). This was sufficient
to induce neutropenia, with transient
GCSF-dependent recovery of neutro-
phils by 30 days followed by protracted
multilineage cytopenia until second
allo-SCT after 12 weeks. The second
allo-SCT was preceded by 4 Gy of total
body irradiation (TBI), thiotepa (T), flu-
darabine, cyclophosphamide, and ATG
conditioning. GVHD of skin was treated
with prednisolone (1 mg/kg) and four
doses of rituximab (375 mg/m2). (B) The
extent of residual disease was monitored
by qPCR for two immunoglobulin gene
rearrangement signatures (VH6/JH3 and
DH3/JH6) and had remained >10−3
throughout previous interventions, in-
cluding first allo-SCT. Within 28 days of
UCART19 therapy, and at serial time
points thereafter for 12 months, MRD
was reported negative at <10−5. (C) Anal-
ysis detected cells of three origins: allo-
SCT donor, allo-SCT recipient, and
UCART19 cells, with the latter reaching
above 25% in bone marrow by day 77.
Full donor chimerism was restored by
the second allo-SCT and remained stable
thereafter. (D) Lentiviral VCN per cell in
PBMC and bone marrow (BM) was quan-
tified. The signal was lost after the sec-
ond allo-SCT, 12 weeks after infusion.
(E) CAR19+ T cells detected by flow cy-
tometry 8 weeks after UCART19 infusion
(fig. S4) were enriched by flow-based
sorting using anti-F(ab)2 staining and
subjected to molecular characterization
alongside the original cell product. Chi-
merism studies of sorted PBMC and
bone marrow indicated that the purity
of the enrichment was around 60%, re-
flecting the technical limitations of ana-
lyzing samples from a lymphopenic infant.
Nonetheless, NGS interrogation after nest-
ed PCR amplification of CD52 target sites
confirmed a high frequency of NHEJ sig-
natures for CD52, indicating postalemtu-
zumab survival of gene-edited cells. Less
frequent event signatures at the TRAC lo-
cus were consistent with flow cytometric
detection of CD3+ T cells.

 allo-SCT. The manufacture of autologous CAR19 T cells was not fea-
sible in these lymphopenic infants, and attempting a second allo-SCT
in the setting of refractory relapse was considered futile.
Host preparation involved lymphodepletion with a combination of
immunosuppressive chemotherapy and alemtuzumab (anti-CD52),
and in both cases, the absence of CD52 expression on the leukemic
blasts suggests that the disease was not directly targeted by the anti-
body. Reduction of disease burden during lymphodepletion may have
accounted for the absence of subsequent cytokine release syndrome
(18), but previous relapses after myeloablative chemotherapy, alloge-
neic SCT, and BITE therapy with blinatu-
momab underlined the aggressive nature of
the leukemia in these infants. The inocu-
lated cell dose of 5 × 107 T cells used in
both cases had been cryopreserved in pre-
filled vials manufactured for a proposed
phase 1 dose-escalation study and, for these
infants, provided 4 to 5 × 106 CAR19

theless, carriage of such a population was
recognized to still constitute a risk for pos-
sible GVHD. In haploidentical transplan-
tation using TCRab-depleted stem cell
grafts, there is often a threshold effect
for GVHD above 5 × 104 mismatched
T cells/kg (19), and our usual practice is to
aim to infuse <1 × 104/kg in such a setting.
However, in these refractory infants, we
prioritized the maximum CAR19+ T cell
dosing available in each prefilled vial and
accepted the risk that residual TCRab car-
riage may breach thresholds for GVHD. In
both patients, UCART19 cells could be de-
tected by PCR as early as 2 weeks after in-
fusion in both subjects, although detailed
quantification in blood and bone marrow
was only possible after 4 weeks in the first
patient. Highly sensitive molecular MRD
studies showed disease remission, and this
was confirmed by flow analysis and cyto-
genetic studies on serial marrow samples.
In subject 2, flow cytometry revealed the
presence of CAR19+ CD3− T cells, and
these were all CD52−; however, in subject
1, analysis of bone marrow by 8 weeks re-
vealed that most CAR19+ cells were CD3+.
Molecular analysis of TALEN target loci in
CAR+cellsisolatedbyflowcytometricsort-
ing revealed a high frequency of NHEJ
eventsattheCD52site,consistentwithsur-
vivalof CD52-negativeTcellsafteralemtu-
zumab. A reduced NHEJ event frequency
was detected at the TCR locus, and this
was in keeping with the emergence of
CD3+ T cells in both bone marrow and
peripheral blood. In subject 1, almost all
UCART19 cells isolated from the bone
marrow and peripheral blood were CD4+,
and although it is unclear how these cells
contributed to GVHD, strikingly similar
findings were recently reported in murine
allogeneic CAR19 experiments, where

Fig. 3. Outline of UCART19 therapy in a second infant. (A) Fludarabine (F), cyclophosphamide (C), and alemtuzumab
(A) were administered to subject 2, followed by UCART19 cells. Transient skin rash suggestive of GVHD responded
rapidly to topical steroids, and irritability was self-limiting, resolving without intervention. Stable neutrophil recovery
was established by 28 days. Second allo-SCT followed a single dose of rituximab (Rtx; 375 mg/m2), 4 Gy of TBI, fludar-
abine, cyclophosphamide, and ATG conditioning 10 weeks after UCART19. (B) PCR quantification was positive (>10−3)
since relapse after the first allo-SCT and became negative (<10−5) only after UCART19 therapy. (C) Chimerism studies
detected the original allo-SCT donor and UCART19 cells until the second allo-SCT. (D) VCN in PBMC confirmed the
presence of UCART19 cells, peaking in the third week after infusion, and persisting at low levels until conditioning ahead
of second allo-SCT at 10 weeks after infusion. (E) Almost all circulating T cells that expressed CAR19 were CD52− and CD3−

 GVHD developed in the presence of CD19+ leukemia (20). There had
been transient recovery of neutrophils at 3 to 4 weeks supported by GCSF,
andthiswasfollowedbyasecondperiodofcytopeniaandsubsequentman-
ifestationsofGVHDintheskin.Notably,MRDwasundetectablebythetime
GVHD developed, but we speculate that residual TCR+cellscapable of allo-
recognition survived and may have been driven by constitutive signaling via
the41BBdomainoftheCARandwerethenabletoexpandintheabsenceof
homeostatic competition in this lymphodepleted host. It is possible that in
subject 1, GVHD contributed to antileukemic activity but did not manifest
clinically for several weeks after the induction of molecular remission. The
manifestations of GVHD were limited to skin and marrow, in contrast to
typically multisystem and usually fulminant complications of transfusion-
associatedGVHD,whichcanoccasionallybemediatedbymismatchedallo-
geneic lymphocytes transferred in blood transfusions to immunodeficient
hosts (21).
In subject 2, there were only transient features suggestive of mild
skin GVHD that reversed promptly with topical steroids and an epi-
sode of unexplained irritability within the first 3 weeks after infusion.
There were no active abnormalities of CSF or brain imaging, but tran-
sient UCART19-mediated neurotoxicty may have occurred and resolved
without intervention. Subject 2 shared three HLA class 1 alleles with the
UCART19 batch used, whereas subject 1 was mismatched at all loci, and
this may have been a driver for greater alloreactivity for residual TCR+
UCART19 cells in the first subject.
There was a theoretical concern that TALEN-induced translocations
(or other effects, including off-target DNA scission) could cause geno-
toxicity or other adverse effects, but a time-limited application of
UCART19 ahead of allo-SCT provided an important safeguard for this
first clinical use. UCART19 cells carry RQR8 (16), a sort/suicide gene
moiety comprising CD34/CD20 epitopes transcriptionally linked to
CAR19, but unexpected uncoupling from CAR19 may have resulted
in reduced sensitivity to CD20-targeting rituximab. This phenomenon
needs to be investigated further, but a strategy incorporating pretrans-
plant conditioning ensured that UCART19 cells were eliminated com-
pletely. Notably, conversion to full donor chimerism by allo-SCT once
molecular remission is achieved could have clear advantages in reducing
the risk of relapse and the evolution of CD19− escape variants or clo-
nally related malignancies in other lineages, as described recently after
CAR19 therapy (22). An additional advantage of this approach is the
avoidance of long-term depletion of healthy B cells, as encountered in
autologous studies (23), which would otherwise necessitate the use of
long-term immunoglobulin replacement therapy.
This application of an emerging technology has provided a dem-
onstration of the potential of gene-editing strategies for engineered cell
therapies, albeit with a clinical experience limited to two infants. Im-
portant caveats include concerns relating to residual risks of GVHD,
carriage of translocations and other genetic changes by the edited cells,
and the use of lympodepleting agents and their attendant risks of viral
reactivation and other complications. Additional limitations more
broadly applicable to CAR therapies, including cytokine release
phenomena, neurotoxicity, and the possibility of disease relapse
through mutational escape of target antigens, must also be considered
and will need to be investigated in structured clinical trials. Phase
1 trials for UCART19 cell therapy in both children (NCT02808442)
and adults (NCT02746952) are now under way, with weight-targeted
dose-banding arrangements and stringently capped carriage of
residual TCRab T cells to <5 × 104/kg. As experience with gene-editing
tools develops, further applications may involve targeting a variety of
genetic loci involved in immune recognition and checkpoint pathways.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Named-patient, open-label, nonblinded, compassionate therapy was
undertaken in two infants ahead of planned phase 1 clinical trials.
Regulation, ethics, and consent
Treatment was provided by the U.K. National Health Service under
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency specials
license number MS 17328 and with the approval of the Institutional
Drug and Therapeutics Board, after consultation with the Great Or-
mond Street Hospital ethics committee and with informed parental
consent. Cellectis SA gave their permission for use of UCART19 cells
under these arrangements.
GMP cell manufacturing
A third-generation self-inactivating lentiviral configuration encoding the
4g7 CAR19 (CD19scFv-41BB-CD3z), HIV CPPT, RRE, and mutated
WPRE was manufactured and released as previously described (24, 25).
Healthy donor PBMCs were supplied cryopreserved (HemaCare) and
were thawed and then activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 ExpAct beads
(Miltenyi Biotec) in X-VIVO 15 medium (Cambrex) supplemented
with 5% human AB serum and IL-2 (100 ng/ml) (Miltenyi Biotec). After
a single round of lentiviral transduction, the beads were removed by
CliniMACS magnetic depletion, and the cells were subjected to multiplex
gene editing by electroporation of high-grade TALEN mRNA (Eufets)
targeting TRAC and CD52. Cells were suspended in BTXpress Cyto-
poration Media T in a customized GMP-compliant electroporation
chamber for use with an Agile Pulse device (BTX-Harvard Appara-
tus). Thereafter, cells were transferred to a Wave Bioreactor 2/10 (GE
Healthcare) and expanded for up to 10 days before being depleted
of residual TCR-expressing cells by CliniMACS TCRab depletion
(Miltenyi Biotec). The resulting cell product was cryopreserved in dose
aliquots of 50 million cells.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry (BD LSR II) and cell sorting (FACSAria III) were per-
formed using routine T cell panels (BD Biosciences Multitest 6-Color
TBNK antibodies) with the addition of goat anti-mouse immuno-
globulin G F(ab)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for CAR19 detection
and mouse anti-human Qbend10 (Miltenyi Biotec) for human CD34
staining of RQR8.
Chimerism, MRD, and VCN
VCN was determined by real-time qPCR using 100 ng of DNA as a
template for probe/primers specific to the psi lentiviral sequence and
human albumin for normalization. A reference standard was gener-
ated by serial dilution of HT1080 fibrosarcoma encoding a single copy
of the integrated vector. All reactions used ABsolute qPCR ROX Mix
(Thermo Scientific) and were run in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 10 min
at 95°C, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, and 1 min at 60°C. MRD
was tracked using markers for the immunoglobulin heavy chains
IGHV6-1*01/IGHD1-1*01/IGHJ3*02 and IGHD3-10*01/IGHJ6*02
over 50 cycles under the following conditions: 2 min at 50°C, then
10 min at 95°C, 50 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, and 1 min at 58° to 68°C.
Results were reported as the relative frequency of leukemic cells with a
threshold of >10−4 (0.01%) used to define molecular relapse.
The extent of donor engraftment was assessed using the previously
described method of analysis (26). Briefly, DNA was extracted from

Downloaded from 
 bone marrow or peripheral blood samples using Qiagen DNA mini
spin columns (Qiagen), and 10 ng was used to amplify short VNTRs
with the PowerPlex 16 system (Promega). PCR products were run on a
3500xL Genetic Analyzer, and results were analyzed using GeneMapper
software 5 (Applied Biosystems).
Analysis of gene-editing signatures
Samples were acquired on day 3 of manufacture (prenuclease) and at
the end of production (postnuclease), and DNA was extracted using a
Qiagen EZ1 tissue kit. Target regions were amplified using fusion prim-
ers containing MiSeq adapter sequences fused to target sequences, and
unique barcode sequences were then added to each amplicon. A pooled
DNA library was sequenced on a single MiSeq flow cell as a 2 × 301
paired-end sequencing run. Demultiplexed data sets were aligned
against corresponding reference sequences and analyzed by a proprie-
tary pipeline for read cleanup, trimming, and discard of short reads,
followed by assembly of read pairs and then Needleman-Wunsch align-
ment of sequences against template. Insertions, deletions, and indels
were quantified as events characteristic of NHEJ, and their frequency
was calculated for each target site.
For analysis of UCART19 T cells recovered by sorting of blood and
bone marrow, a nested PCR protocol was used to amplify molecular
events (indels) generated in T cells treated with TRAC and CD52
TALENs. First and second PCRs were performed with Herculase II
Fusion DNA 15 Polymerases kit (Agilent Technologies) using 30
and 20 cycles of amplification, respectively, at 55°C. The samples were
then purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP system and subjected
to deep sequencing analysis (Illumina), and the frequency of NHEJ
events was quantified as before (14).
The 5′-3′ oligonucleotides used for the first PCR were CD52: for-
ward, ATCTTGTACGATCTAGCCTGC and reverse, AGGTTTCTCT-
CAGGGCAGCC; TRAC: forward, CATTTCAGGTTTCCTTGAGTGG
and reverse, CAGATTTGTTGCTCCAGGCC; and for the second PCR
were CD52: forward, AAGACTCGGCAGCATCTCCACAGATCTG-
CAGAAAGGAAGC and reverse, GCGATCGTCACTGTTCTC-
CACCTGTTGGAGTCCATCTGCTG; TRAC: forward,
