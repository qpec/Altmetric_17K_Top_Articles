ABSTRACT 
 
There is uncertainty regarding how long the effects of acupuncture treatment persist after a course of 
treatment. We aimed to determine the trajectory of pain scores over time following acupuncture, using 
a large individual patient dataset from high quality randomized trials of acupuncture for chronic pain. 
The available individual patient dataset included 29 trials and 17,922 patients. The chronic pain 
conditions included musculoskeletal pain (low back, neck and shoulder), osteoarthritis of the knee and 
headache/migraine. We used meta-analytic techniques to determine the trajectory of post-treatment 
pain scores. Data on longer-term follow-up were available for 20 trials, including 6376 patients. In trials 
comparing acupuncture to no acupuncture control (wait-list, usual care, etc), effect sizes diminished by 
a non-significant 0.011 SD per 3 months (95% CI: -0.014 to 0.037, p = 0.4) after treatment ended. The 
central estimate suggests that about 90% of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls would be 
sustained at 12 months. For trials comparing acupuncture to sham, we observed a reduction in effect 
size of 0.025 SD per 3 months (95% CI: 0.000 to 0.050, p = 0.050), suggesting about a 50% diminution at 
12 months. The effects of a course of acupuncture treatment for patients with chronic pain do not 
appear to decrease importantly over 12 months. Patients can generally be reassured that treatment 
effects persist. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture should take our findings into account 
when considering the time horizon of acupuncture effects. Further research should measure longer 
term outcomes of acupuncture.   
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
In an individual patient data meta-analysis of nearly 18,000 patients on high-quality randomized trials 
involving patients with chronic pain, the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration reported that acupuncture 
provided small but statistically significant benefits over sham (placebo) acupuncture, a result that can be 
distinguished from bias.[35]  Moreover  a robust and larger effect size was observed when acupuncture 
was compared to no acupuncture control, with the difference being clinically relevant.[35] The data 
from each trial entered into the collaboration meta-analysis were the outcomes at the trial’s primary 
endpoint. For instance, if a trial measured outcome after 12 weeks of treatment and then three months 
later, but the authors specified the post-treatment follow-up as primary, then it would be the 12 week 
follow-up used in the meta-analysis.  
For approximately two-thirds of the trials in the meta-analysis, the primary endpoint was between one 
and three months after the end of treatment. The primary endpoint was one year or more after 
randomization for only two trials. This is problematic in the context of chronic pain. For a patient who 
has endured chronic pain for a decade or more, the promise of a few months relief, while welcome, is 
less relevant than the question of whether an intervention provides benefits over the longer term. The 
duration of acupuncture effects also has clear health economic implications. Whether the benefits of a 
course of acupuncture treatment are worth its cost depends critically on how long those benefits last.  
In this paper, we analyze individual patient data from the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration to 
determine the time course of acupuncture effects. We sought to take advantage of the fact that many of 
the eligible trials measured outcome at more than one time point after the end of treatment. By 
comparing how differences between groups change between two post-treatment time points we aimed 
to estimate the degree to which the effects of acupuncture persist.

METHODS 
 
Systematic Review 
 
Trials included in these analyses were identified through a systematic literature review that has been 
previously described[35][36].  The search included trials of acupuncture for chronic pain where 
allocation concealment was determined unambiguously to be adequate. Eligible pain patients were 
those with non-specific low back or neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headache/migraine or 
osteoarthritis. This search resulted in the identification of 31 trials and individual patient data were 
obtained from 29 trials. Of these, 18 trials compared acupuncture to no acupuncture controls (Table 1). 
Control groups included no treatment, wait-list, rescue medication, usual care or protocol-guided care. 
Patients who were allocated to a wait-list were offered treatment at the end of the trial period. A 
further 20 trials compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture (Table 2). Nine of these trials had three 
arms, with patients allocated to acupuncture, no acupuncture or a sham control. We have previously 
explored the impact of the choice of control group on the effect size of acupuncture, which showed that 
the more active the control the smaller the apparent effect of acupuncture.[24]

Outcome 
 
The primary outcome used for this analysis was pain as defined by the study authors. Where multiple 
criteria were considered in the primary outcome (e.g. a response defined as either a 33% reduction in 
pain or a 50% reduction in pain medication) or if the primary outcome was inherently categorical, we 
instead used a continuous measure of pain. To make outcome measurements comparable between 
different trials, all pain measurements were standardized by dividing by pooled standard deviation and 
multiplied by 100. Since higher pain scores correspond to lower levels of pain, a positive pain change 
score corresponds to an improvement (less pain) from baseline, i.e.  if a patient had a score of 100 at 
baseline and 50 after treatment, then they were actually in more pain, not less pain.  
Analysis 
 
For a trial to be included in this meta-analysis, the primary outcome must have been measured at least 
twice after the end of treatment. For trials in which control group patients were later offered 
acupuncture treatment, data from both acupuncture and control patients were dropped from all time 
points after the time at which control patients began receiving treatment. Trials were excluded if they 
had only one measurement after the end of treatment, if all outcome measurements were only during 
treatment, or if the primary outcome was measured only after control patients began to receive 
acupuncture. In this analysis, we used all time points in a trial, not just the time point specified as 
primary by the study authors. 
 
In the primary analysis[35], we did not find evidence that the effects of acupuncture differed by 
indication. Hence we planned to include all trials together and then examine the data to determine 
whether there was evidence of a difference in time course by indication, a “lump then split” approach.  
To estimate the time course of acupuncture effects, we used the xtgee command in Stata to create a 
longitudinal model taking into account the correlation between an individual patient’s scores over time.

We used the pain intensity score as the dependent variable with baseline score, time and treatment 
group and an interaction term for group and time as predictors. Since the length of acupuncture 
treatment varied between trials, time was defined as the number of days since the end of treatment for 
this model.  
 
To test whether the effects of treatment changed differently over time between the acupuncture and 
control groups, the analysis was repeated separately for each trial. The coefficients for the interaction 
term between treatment group and time since end of treatment were saved out along with the standard 
error of the estimate and entered into a meta-analysis.  
 
As a sensitivity analysis, this model was also used to perform a one-stage meta-analysis for no 
acupuncture controlled and sham controlled trials separately. Data from all trials were included and the 
model was also adjusted for trial. 
To give a visual representation of how the effects of acupuncture change over time, the results are 
presented graphically in two ways: as standardized pain scores over time since randomization, and as 
standardized pain scores over time since the end of treatment. A longitudinal model for the effect of 
time on pain change score (including cubic splines with knots at the tertiles) was used to predict and 
graph pain change over time for the acupuncture and control groups separately.  
 
 
RESULTS 
 
In most trials, patients received 8 – 15 treatments over 10 – 12 weeks. Only one trial had a longer 
treatment duration, 26 weeks[3]. A subset of studies recorded the number and frequency of sessions 
actually received by patients on the trial. In the acupuncture arm of trials with a no acupuncture control 
group, the mean number of treatments was 8 over 8 weeks (N=551). For sham trials, the number and 
duration of treatment was similar for both the acupuncture and sham arms: a mean of 10 treatments 
over 6 weeks (N=662). 
 
Acupuncture compared to no acupuncture controls 
 
In our analysis of acupuncture versus no acupuncture controls, a total of 8 trials and 2,985 patients were 
included. The results of the meta-analysis for these 8 trials with no acupuncture controls are shown in 
Figure 1. Note that in this figure the weights are determined using inverse variance weighting, so for 
example if a trial had a small confidence interval (very low variance), it had a higher weight than other 
trials of the same or even larger sizes that had higher variances. Effect size is reported as a post-
treatment change in SD per 3 months for the acupuncture trials compared to the no acupuncture 
controlled trials. The fixed-effects estimate for the between-group comparison of acupuncture versus no 
acupuncture controls showed a non-significant decrease in the effect size of acupuncture of (0.011 SD 
per 3 months, 95% C.I. -0.014 to 0.037, p = 0.4) after the end of treatment. As the difference between 
acupuncture and control has previously been found to be close to 0.5 SD[35], the effect size of 0.011 SD 
per 3 months is equivalent to about a 9% diminution of treatment effects in the acupuncture versus no 
acupuncture group at 12 months. There was significant heterogeneity between trials (p=0.006).

between the two groups remains relatively consistent from randomization up to one year after the end 
of treatment. The effect sizes for the individual arms in these trials that report data beyond six months 
are presented in Table 3. The increase in overall effects in both arms might be attributable to the 
smaller effect sizes in the trial at 49 weeks[10] and the larger effect sizes of the trial with the longest 
follow-up at 92 weeks[30](Table 3).  
Insert Figure 2 here 
Insert Table 3 here 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which data were entered into a one-stage meta-analysis. In the 
one-stage approach, the longitudinal model described above was applied to a data set including all trials 
with a no acupuncture control group. The model incorporated the non-independence between 
observations on a single patient and between observations on different patients in the same trial. 
Results for no acupuncture controlled trials were almost identical to the two-stage meta-analysis, with 
an overall reduction of 0.011 SD per 3 months, (95% CI -0.034, 0.013). 
Acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture controls 
 
We included a total of 16 trials and 4,534 patients in our analysis for acupuncture versus sham-
controlled trials. The results of the meta-analysis for these 16 sham acupuncture controlled trials are 
shown in Figure 3. Among these trials, we found a significant reduction in pain change scores over time 
between the sham and acupuncture groups (effect size = -0.025 SD per 3 months, 95% C.I. -0.050 to 
0.000, p=0.05) after the end of treatment. Because the difference between acupuncture and sham 
controls has previously been found to be close to 0.2 SD[35] this reduction would mean about a 50% 
diminution of effect size for acupuncture compared to sham patients at 12 months. Significant 
heterogeneity was also seen in sham-controlled trials (p < 0.0001).  
Insert Figure 3 here 
For all three neck pain trials[16][34][38] included in this analysis, the effects of acupuncture decreased 
over time compared to sham (see Figure 3), with two of these trials [34][38] showing a statistically 
significant decrease. In a sensitivity analysis that excluded neck pain trials, we found that there was a 
smaller non-significant reduction in how differences in pain between groups changed over time (effect 
size = -0.014, 95% CI -0.039, 0.011, p = 0.3) after treatment. Moreover there was no longer significant 
heterogeneity between sham acupuncture-controlled trials (p = 0.2). When excluding these three neck 
pain trials from the analysis, the diminution of effect in acupuncture patients compared to sham is 
about 28% at one year, suggesting that most of the effects of acupuncture might persist over time for 
the non-neck related chronic pain conditions. The Vas trial of acupuncture for shoulder pain[33] had a 
relatively large weight because outcome was measured three times after the end of treatment, allowing 
more precise estimates of the time course of treatment. However, excluding this trial had very little 
effect on the analyses (-0.024SD per 3 months, 95% CI -0.053, 0.005). 
For sham-controlled trials, the one-stage meta-analytic approach found a slightly larger reduction in 
effect size compared to two-stage meta-analysis (-0.036 SD per 3 months, 95% CI -0.060, -0.012). 
However, the principal findings were not importantly affected: there was a large reduction in effect for 
neck pain trials (-0.581 SD per 3 months, -0.736, -0.427) but reductions in effect size for trials on non-
neck pain indications were non-significant (-0.021 SD per 3 months, 95% CI -0.046, 0.003). 
The pain change scores in each group over time after the end of treatment are shown in Figure 4 after 
randomization are shown in Supplementary File Figure 2. In the latter, the benefits of both acupuncture

and sham acupuncture groups appear to be largely sustained over time, with the difference in the pain 
change scores between the two groups remaining relatively consistent up to one year after 
randomization.  Figure 4shows a trend of a decrease in the effect of both the acupuncture delivered 
within a sham controlled trial and the sham acupuncture over time. Among these sham-controlled trials, 
one trial reported larger effect sizes at six months after the end of treatment[34], and three trials 
reported data nearer to 12 months after the end of treatment[4][10][40] (Table 3).  The fact that the 
effect sizes in these three trials at one year after treatment are smaller overall than the trial with the 
large effect sizes reporting data at six months is likely to explain in part the observed decrease in 
treatment effect in sham controlled trials over time.

Post hoc analyses 
In light of our findings, we conducted a number of unplanned analyses. To determine whether the 
estimates of decrease in acupuncture effect relative to sham acupuncture or no acupuncture control are 
different, we compared the mean difference between acupuncture and each control group. We found 
no evidence of heterogeneity in how the effects of acupuncture dissipate between sham and no 
acupuncture-controlled trials when including all trials in the analysis (p=0.5) or when excluding neck pain 
trials from the analysis (p=0.9). 
One reason why we may have failed to find significant reductions in acupuncture effects over time is 
that the analysis included trials irrespective of whether they reported differences between acupuncture 
and control. Obviously, a trial that showed no difference between groups cannot show a reduction in 
acupuncture effects over time. Hence we repeated our analyses excluding trials that concluded no 
significant effect of acupuncture compared to sham or no acupuncture control. Five no acupuncture 
controlled trials with 2,059 patients found a significant effect of acupuncture compared to no 
acupuncture control. Among these trials, there was a non-significant increase in the effects of 
acupuncture relative to no acupuncture control (0.013 SD per 3 months, 95% CI -0.018, 0.44, p=0.4). 
There were 7 sham controlled trials with 1,450 patients that found a significant effect of acupuncture 
compared to sham acupuncture. There was a significant decrease in the effects of acupuncture relative 
to sham for every 3 months of follow up of 0.049 SD (95% CI -0.086, -0.013, p=0.008) and significant 
heterogeneity between trials (p<0.0001). Excluding neck pain trials from this sensitivity analysis left 5 
trials with 1,203 patients. There was no longer significant heterogeneity (p=0.060) and the decrease in 
the effect of acupuncture compared to sham was smaller and no longer significant when excluding both 
neck pain trials and trials that found no effect of acupuncture relative to sham: a decrease of 0.028 SD 
for every 3 months follow up (95% CI -0.065, 0.009, p = 0.13). 
When including all trials that found an effect of acupuncture, there was significant heterogeneity, with 
the effects of acupuncture decreasing much more rapidly in the sham acupuncture trials than in the no 
acupuncture controlled trials (p=0.011). However, when excluding the neck pain trials from this analysis, 
we found a non-significant reduction in the effects of acupuncture over time between the sham 
controlled and no acupuncture controlled trials that found a significant effect of acupuncture (p=0.097). 
To explore these results further, we repeated our analyses separately for neck pain and compared our 
findings to other pain patient subgroups combined. The estimate of a reduction in neck pain treatment 
benefit of 0.587 (95% CI 0.406, 0.767) standard deviations per three months is very much higher than 
the estimate of 0.014 (95% C.I -0.039, 0.011) for comparison conditions (p < 0.0001). On closer 
inspection of data from each trial, improvements from baseline in the acupuncture group were stable in

one trial at 8 weeks post-randomization[38] but decreased by 40 – 50% in two trials with 10 – 25 weeks 
additional follow-up[16][34].   
DISCUSSION  
 
Principal findings 
The effects of acupuncture compared to no acupuncture for chronic pain do not appear to decrease 
importantly over a projected 12 month period. We did not see a statistically significant association with 
time. The central estimate suggests that about 90% of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls 
would be sustained at 12 months, or when using the upper bound of the confidence interval, about 70% 
of the benefit of acupuncture relative to controls would be sustained at 12 months. 
The results for acupuncture versus sham were similar after exclusion of studies on neck pain. We did see 
clear evidence that the effects of acupuncture versus sham on neck pain do diminish over time.  When 
excluding neck pain trials from the analysis to reduce heterogeneity, the diminution of effect in 
acupuncture patients compared to sham was about 30% at one year, suggesting that much of the effects 
of acupuncture persist over time for the non-neck related chronic pain conditions. This might be 
explained in part by the shorter courses of treatment provided in the neck pain trials[16,34,38], which 
were in the range of 3 to 4 weeks, in contrast to the more commonly provided courses lasting 6 to 8 
weeks or longer for the other conditions (see Table 2). 
 Strengths and limitations  
The key strength of this study is that we have used a meta-analysis drawing on an individual patient data 
from high quality randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for chronic pain, which found that 
acupuncture was superior to both sham and no acupuncture controls for each pain condition.[35] Using 
this large dataset of nearly 18,000 patients, we have been able to explore sub-groups with a precision 
not possible when using only summary trial data, as would be the case when using conventional meta-
analytic methods. A key limitation was that not all trials in the dataset provided data at more than one 
post-treatment follow-up.  We only have data from eight of the twenty trials that followed patients for 
40 weeks or more. One trial provided follow-up at two years after randomization.[22] We do believe it is 
reasonable to draw conclusions about the time course of acupuncture effects over a one-year period. 
First, the data that we do have from trials with longer term follow-up does indeed suggest persistence of 
effects, incidentally a characteristic that may not be unique to acupuncture. Second, we did not see any 
difference on how treatment benefit changed over time comparing trials with longer versus shorter 
follow-up, which is why we used data from all trials to estimate the effects of time on treatment. It 
would be incorrect to conclude that “no important diminution of effect at 12 months” means “effects 
persist well beyond 12 months”.   
Relationship to the wider literature 
Our conclusions as to the time course over which acupuncture appears to provide benefits differ to 
some extent from data reported in a number of prior systematic reviews of acupuncture for chronic pain 
based on summary.[1][2][7][11][13][12][23][21][28][29][31]  The critical difference between the current 
paper and prior reviews is that the latter reviews did not directly evaluate the time course of 
acupuncture effects. When a prior review reports that  results were significant at an early time point, 
but not at a later time point, this cannot be taken as evidence that results changed over time. There are 
several reasons why significance may change even if underlying effects do not. The most obvious is if the

number of patients changes over time due to drop out. For instance, a trial with 150 patients per group 
and a 0.25 standard deviation difference between groups at post-treatment would be statistically 
significant (p=0.031). If results were identical at a six-month follow-up, but 25% of patients dropped out, 
the p value would be 0.063. Alternatively, if there was no drop out and no changes in mean pain scores, 
but longer follow-up was associated with a 25% increase in standard deviation, perhaps associated with 
greater variability of pain over time, the p value would again be non-significant (p=0.084). In both cases, 
the effects of treatment persist, and an analysis directly testing trends over time would confirm this 
finding; taking the approach of the conventional reviews and indirectly assessing change over time by 
separate inference at different timepoints would lead to incorrect conclusions  regarding the time 
course of underlying effects.  We are the first systematic review to directly analyze change over time 
using appropriate methods for longitudinal data.  
Differences between our results and the previously published systematic reviews can be illustrated by 
taking as an example the review by Furlan et al[12] who found that, “acupuncture did not significantly 
differ from placebo in improving pain intensity scores” for low back and neck pain. In our meta-analysis, 
we used different inclusion criteria to select trials for review, which  included the multiple pain 
conditions of headache/migraine, osteoarthritis and low back and neck pain, whereas Furlan only 
included low back and neck pain. Our more strict inclusion criteria required evidence of unambiguous 
allocation concealment, leading to our inclusion of only higher quality trials, which are less likely to be 
susceptible to bias. The critical difference however between the analysis we present here and the 
analyses of Furlan et al. is that they did not directly address the time course of acupuncture effects. 
Their analyses were limited to those trials that measured similar outcomes during approximately the 
same time periods. We obtained patient data from all eligible trials and performed an individual patient 
data meta-analysis within which we were able to standardize and compare multiple types of outcome. 
Since we had individual patient data, we were able to incorporate outcomes measured at all time points 
from all trials into one analysis, rather than drawing conclusions from multiple separate analyses and we 
therefore conducted an analysis that directly addressed the question at hand.   
Implications for research and practice  
The major clinical implication of our findings is that we can reassure chronic pain patients considering 
acupuncture that any treatment benefit does persist after the end of treatment. This is naturally also a 
consideration for other clinicians who may refer patients for acupuncture. A concern for such clinicians 
and their patients is that they may go through the time, trouble and expense of a course of acupuncture 
treatment, but then regress to having the same amount of pain shortly after treatment ends. This 
cannot be assumed, given the evidence that the effects of acupuncture for chronic pain persist for at 
least a year. A possible exception is neck pain, as we saw some evidence that differences between 
acupuncture and sham decrease over time for this condition.  
Our findings also have implications on cost-effectiveness studies that use utility measures. Such studies 
calculate benefit, in terms of increase in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with an 
intervention, and divide by the increase in cost associated with that intervention. Increase in QALYs 
depends on a “time horizon” for treatment effectiveness. In many cost-effectiveness studies on 
acupuncture, this time horizon is given as the length of follow-up, effectively assuming that the benefits 
of acupuncture disappear completely the moment that a patient completes their final questionnaire or 
follow-up assessment. Changing the time horizon dramatically impacts cost-effectiveness. In the case of 
a trial with the final follow-up at three months, but using a time horizon of 12 months ( a minimum 
based on our data) rather than a time horizon of 3 months, would reduce the cost per QALY by 75%.

In terms of future prospective research, it is clear that further studies should continue to measure 
outcomes beyond the end of acupuncture treatment, at least at 12 months follow-up and, ideally, 
beyond. In one Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration study[37], the average duration of chronic pain in 
the study cohort was over 20 years. It surely behoves the research community to adequately fund 
studies to assess long-term outcomes in patients with chronic pain. Given the discrepant results for 
chronic neck pain, future studies could focus specifically on the time course of acupuncture for this type 
of pain. Moreover there is a case for exploring the biological plausibility of physiological changes in sub-
studies embedded within clinical trials in order to provide a mechanistic explanation of the longer terms 
benefits associated with acupuncture. It is also plausible that the sustained effects of acupuncture may 
be explained by, as yet unspecified and unmeasured, treatment mediating factors. 
CONCLUSION 
With the possible exception of neck pain, the effects of acupuncture compared to no acupuncture for 
chronic pain do not appear to decrease importantly over 12 months. Patients can generally be reassured 
that treatment effects are likely to persist. Cost-effectiveness studies should take our findings into 
account when considering the time horizon of acupuncture treatment. Further research should measure 
long-term outcome of acupuncture for patients with chronic pain.
