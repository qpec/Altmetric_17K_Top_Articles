Objective although anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha 
(anti-tnFα) therapies represent a major breakthrough 
in iBD therapy, their cost–benefit ratio is hampered by 
an overall 30% non-response rate, adverse side effects 
and high costs. thus, finding predictive biomarkers of 
non-response prior to commencing anti-tnFα therapy is 
of high value. 
Design We analysed publicly available whole-genome 
expression profiles of colon biopsies obtained from 
multiple cohorts of patients with iBD using a combined 
computational deconvolution—meta-analysis paradigm 
which allows to estimate immune cell contribution to the 
measured expression and capture differential regulatory 
programmes otherwise masked due to variation in 
cellular composition. insights from this in silico approach 
were experimentally validated in biopsies and blood 
samples of three independent test cohorts. 
results  We found the proportion of plasma cells as 
a robust pretreatment biomarker of non-response to 
therapy, which we validated in two independent cohorts 
of immune-stained colon biopsies, where a plasma 
cellular score from inflamed biopsies was predictive 
of non-response with an area under the curve (aUc) 
of 82%. Meta-analysis of the cell proportion-adjusted 
gene expression data suggested that an increase in 
inflammatory macrophages in anti-tnFα non-responding 
individuals is associated with the upregulation of 
the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 
(treM-1) and chemokine receptor type 2 (ccr2)-
chemokine ligand 7 (ccl7) –axes. Blood gene expression 
analysis of an independent cohort, identified treM-1 
downregulation in non-responders at baseline, which 
was predictive of response with an aUc of 94%. 
Conclusions Our study proposes two clinically feasible 
assays, one in biopsy and one in blood, for predicting 
non-response to anti-tnFα therapy prior to initiation of 
treatment. Moreover, it suggests that mechanism-driven 
novel drugs for non-responders should be developed.

diseases 
(IBDs) 
consist 
primarily of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD) and are prevalent in the industrialised 
world with increasing incidence in both Western and 
low/middle-income countries.1 IBD is characterised 
by chronic intestinal inflammation, driven both by 
the innate and adaptive immune systems, although 
their pathogenesis is not completely understood.2 
significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Antitumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) 
therapy has been shown to be effective for 
treating patients with IBD.
 
► Thirty per cent of patients will be primary non-
responders to anti-TNFα.
 
► Biological treatment is associated with 
side effects, tissue damage secondary to 
uncontrolled disease activity and high costs.
 
► Predictive assays for non-response are hitherto 
not available.
What are the new findings?
 
► A combined statistical deconvolution and 
meta-analysis methodology of anti-TNFα-
naive patients with IBD has identified altered 
abundance of plasma cells and inflammatory 
macrophages in pretreatment intestinal 
biopsies of anti-TNFα responders versus 
non-responders.
 
► Significantly high-plasma cell numbers in anti-
TNFα non-responders were validated in two 
independent real-life cohorts of patients with 
IBD naive to anti-TNFα therapy.
 
► Pathway analysis of the cell-adjusted 
differentially expressed genes in biopsy 
between responders and non-responders 
suggests an upregulation of the triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 
(TREM-1) and chemokine receptor type 2 
(CCR2)–chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) axes in 
non-responders.
 
► TREM-1 expression in the peripheral blood of 
patients with Crohn‘s disease is predictive of 
anti-TNFα response at baseline (downregulated 
in non-responders) with very high accuracy.

Inflammatory bowel disease
The advent of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) 
therapy was a major breakthrough for IBD treatment and was 
shown to be effective for treating various forms of disease.3 
However, anti-TNFα therapy remains suboptimal for several 
reasons: treatment choice and administration is empirical and 
based on data obtained from the ‘average patient’ in clinical 
trials. This practice is associated with insufficient remission rates 
that results from primary non-response (20%–40% in clinical 
trials; 10%–20% in real-life cohorts)4 and from loss of response 
commonly due to immunogenicity and increased anti-TNFα 
clearance in 13%–24% of patients at 12 months.5 Beyond that, 
the treatment is associated with adverse side effects,6 is expen-
sive and each therapeutic attempt requires waiting the antici-
pated time for response during which the disease is active and 
damage accumulates. Taken together, there is an urgent unmet 
need for predicting response prior to treatment initiation to 
reduce healthcare costs and avoid unnecessary treatment.
Several attempts have been made to define a baseline signa-
ture of anti-TNF response in patients with IBD using genetics,7 8 
microbiome9 and gene expression data.10–13 Yet, no predictive 
biomarker is in clinical practice. Here, we used a combined 
statistical deconvolution multicohort analysis approach to iden-
tify biomarkers in colon biopsies and peripheral blood to predict 
anti-TNFα response in patients with IBD and validated them in 
real-life cohorts.

tary methods section.
Public IbD gene expression data and reported gene 
signatures
We obtained colon biopsy gene expression data and patient 
infliximab (IFX, an anti-TNFα agent) responsiveness from 
published studies10 11 available in Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) and consist of two cohorts of patients with UC (UC-A 
and UC-B) and one patient cohort with CD (CDc). No signifi-
cant differences in clinical parameters were observed in any of 
these cohorts at baseline. In addition, we gathered six reported 
signatures10 11 14 15 predictive of IFX response consisting in total 
of 109 unique genes (table 1, online supplementary table 1 and 
methods), as well as blood gene expression data profiling patients 
with IBD for whom endoscopic disease activity was assessed.16
For initial assessment of cell-type expression pattern of these 
signature genes, we created a combined cell-type gene expres-
sion matrix from 130 sorted cell-type samples from immune 
response in silico (IRIS) and the human body index (GSE7307), 
normalised each dataset, batch corrected and standardised by 
z-score (see online supplementary table 2). We enumerated signa-
ture genes to cell types and lineages by assigning the expression 
of each gene to the top-three most expressing subpopulations 
(see online supplementary table 3).
Computational deconvolution and meta-analysis
To estimate cell subset proportions, we used a linear regression 
framework,17–19 in which individual samples were regressed 
based on a characteristic expression of marker genes expressed 
in 17 cell-types (see online supplementary table 4). The resulting 
output of this procedure was an estimated frequency of each cell 
subset in each sample. These were then rescaled into propor-
tions, arcsinh transformed and compared between groups within 
each cohort using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Meta-analysis across 
three cohorts was performed using Fisher’s combined proba-
bility test and corrected for multiple comparisons.20 Cell types 
having nominal P≤0.05 in at least two cohorts and a combined 
false discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.05 were selected for further anal-
ysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed 
by scoring individuals based on the mean gene expression scores 
per signature,21 whereas for cellular biomarkers we used esti-
mated proportions for individual cell subsets or the average stan-
dardised proportions for combined signatures.
Patients in the validation cohorts
We performed analyses of archival slides of patients with IBD in 
two cohorts: First, in a preliminary cohort, we included 20 biop-
sies from 16 patients with IBD (eight CD, seven UC, one IBD 
unclassified, three patients had more than one biopsy) treated 
at the gastroenterology department of the Rambam Health Care 
Campus (RHCC). Patient characteristics are represented in 
table 2. Clinical response was defined by the attending physician 
as clinical and/or endoscopic improvement of IBD-related symp-
toms coupled with a decision to continue IFX therapy, at least 
14 weeks after treatment initiation. Non-response was defined 
by lack of improvement or aggravation of clinical or endoscopic 
presentation or disease symptoms coupled with therapy change. 
Colonic biopsies were obtained during endoscopy performed 
prior to first IFX treatment. Biopsies were taken from inflamed 
and/or uninflamed areas of the colon or ileum.
Second, in a primary validation cohort, we obtained biopsies 
from 61 patients with IBD from RHCC and Tel-Aviv Sourasky 
Medical Center (TASMC). For this cohort, a decision algorithm

significance of this study
how might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
 
► A clinically predictive assay to anti-TNFα therapy can be 
developed using immunohistochemistry staining of paraffin-
embedded intestinal biopsy taken during colonoscopy.
 
► TREM-1 expression in blood can be developed as a non-
invasive diagnostic of non-response to anti-TNFα therapy at 
baseline.
 
► TREM-1 and/or its downstream regulated axis CCR2–CCL7 
can serve as an alternative therapeutic target for patients 
with refractory IBD.

was used to determine response (see online supplementary 
methods).
For blood validation by gene expression analysis, whole blood 
was obtained at baseline from 22 patients with IBD treated 
with IFX in PaxGene tubes. RNA was extracted and assayed 
using Affymetrix Clariom S chips. Data are available in GEO 
as GSE107865. Response was defined using the same algorithm 
(see online supplementary methods). No significant difference 
in C reactive protein (CRP) or Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) 
were noted at baseline between response groups (P=0.66, 0.22, 
respectively).
This study was performed in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethics 
committee of RHCC and TASMC (August 2016, Israel).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed slides of paraffin-embedded colon or ileum 
tissues, sectioned at 4 
µm, were immunostained for the expres-
sion of plasma cells (CD138+, obtained from Serotec, clone 
B-A38, dilution 1:250) in both cohorts and for inflammatory 
macrophages (CD68+ and 
CD86+ from Abcam, clone EP1158Y, 
1:100) in the preliminary cohort. Slides were deparaffinised and 
Polink-1 HRP Broad Spectrum DAB Detection Kit (GBI labs) was 
used for detection according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
staining data analysis
Slides were interpreted by an expert pathologist blind to 
response attributes. A specific cell abundance categorical index 
between 0 and 3 was determined by the pathologist for plasma 
cells and inflammatory macrophages. A minimal number of 
cells was scored as ‘0’, the highest abundance which was seen 
within all slides was scored as ‘3’. In addition, slides were coded 
and scanned by an automatic slide scanner 250 Flash. Intestinal 
crypts, muscles and lymphatic follicles were excluded in each 
tissue to evaluate cell proportions in the stroma only. Whole-
tissue area quantification was performed using ImagePro Premier 
software V
.9.3. CD138+ staining 
area was determined with 
the same colour cut-off for all patients, and the ratio between 
CD138+ staining 
and the whole-tissue area (in pixels) was eval-
uated by a researcher blind to response attributes.
resulTs
Gene expression signatures for anti-TnFα non-response show 
contributions from distinct immune cell subsets
Reported gene expression signatures of anti-TNFα response 
from biopsy show an enrichment for broad immune response 
categories but have not directly been implicated with particular 
immune cell subsets. We checked what was the likely cellular 
origin of expression of 109 genes extracted from six different 
reported signatures associated with baseline anti-TNFα non-re-
sponse (table 1; online supplementary table 1 and figure 1). To 
do so, we analysed the relative expression pattern of these genes 
across a compendium of assembled profiles from sorted immune 
cell subsets and normal bulk colon tissue biopsies available in the 
public domain (see online supplementary table 2).
Clustering the expression profiles of these signature genes 
across sorted cell subsets suggested that three distinct lineages 
contribute to non-response to anti-TNFα treatment (figure 1): 
first, myeloid lineage cells subsets expressing 70% of signa-
ture genes; second, B-cell lineage cell subsets in which 30% of 
signature genes were expressed and third, T and NK cells genes, 
which together comprised 30% of genes in the collective signa-
ture (see online supplementary table 3). Of note, only 15% of 
signature genes were denoted as highly expressed in the bulk 
colon samples, and of these, the majority were also noted to 
be highly expressed in the B-cell lineage. Taken together, the 
majority of anti-TNF response signature genes are more highly 
expressed by immune cell subsets, with non-overlapping gene set 
contributions stemming from a myeloid and B-lineage-associated 
cell subsets. This further suggested that resident or infiltrating 
leucocyte populations within biopsy tissues could constitute a 
good baseline predictor of non-response.
Meta-analysis identifies cell type proportion differences 
between response groups at baseline and following 
treatment
Bulk gene expression measurements of a tissue may be strongly 
confounded by variation in cell subsets.17 22 Given the distinct 
immune cell subset associated genes in anti-TNFα response gene 
signatures, we hypothesised that the signature-identified genes 
may be due to variations in cell subset proportions between indi-
viduals. To test this hypothesis, we used a computational gene 
expression deconvolution approach17 to estimate the relative 
composition of 17 immune cell subsets in each sample of three 
publicly available IBD cohorts (table 1, cohorts UC-A, UC-B 
and CDc, 65 samples total), from which the previously reported 
predictive gene signatures were individually derived (see online 
supplementary tables 3 and 4). We then tested for differences 
in cellular proportions between anti-TNFα therapy responders 
and non-responders (see online supplementary figure 2 and 
table 5). To ensure robustness of our downstream analyses, we 
considered only those cell types for which at least 75% of the 
samples had non-zero estimated proportions and performed 
a meta-analysis of cellular proportion differences across all 
three cohorts by combining P values for cell subset differences 
between response groups across cohorts. Our analysis identi-
fied two cell subsets, macrophages and plasma cells, which were 
significantly different in at least two out of the three discovery 
cohorts (nominal P value ≤0.05) and passed a combined false 
discovery rate of 5% (figure 2A, online supplementary figure 3). 
The proportions of both cell subsets were significantly higher 
in non-responders than in responders. These differences were 
maintained between response groups even following adjustment 
to CRP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels (P value for macrophage/
plasma cell response differences in a linear model adjusted for 
CRP: 0.008/0.031, 0.021/0.869, 0.001/0.010). Repeating the 
same analysis in a second time point, available for UC-A and 
CDc for 4–6 weeks post-treatment, we observed a significant 
decrease in both cell subset abundances, which was independent 
of response in UC but statistically significant only in responders 
in CD (FDR≤0.05, figure 2C–D). Importantly, both cell subset 
proportions were still significantly higher in non-responders 
post-treatment (FDR≤0.05, online supplementary figure 4). 
Overall, this showed that the differences observed at baseline in 
macrophages and plasma cell abundances were maintained after 
treatment initiation, and that successful response to anti-TNFα 
was associated with a sharp decrease in these cell subsets.
baseline plasma cell proportions are predictive of anti-TnFα 
non-response
The significant differences we observed in immune cell subset 
proportions between response groups suggested they may serve 
as clinically feasible predictive biomarkers of non-response. 
Adjusting the expression data of each cohort for variations in 
the cellular biomarker proportions showed a significant decrease 
(a mean drop of 32%) in the ability of gene signature scores

to discriminate responders from non-responders (see online 
supplementary figures 5 and 6). These results suggest that the 
predictive power of reported gene signatures is largely based on 
cell subset proportion differences, whose increase in colon biop-
sies of non-responders may serve for predictive purposes.
Next, we analysed an independent set of 20 paraffin-em-
bedded colon biopsies collected as part of standard clinical care 
from patients with IBD for which anti-TNFα response status 
was available. These were stained for inflammatory macro-
phages and for plasma cells using IHC staining and assessed for 
cell type abundance using a discrete scoring (low/medium/high) 
performed by an expert pathologist who was blind to patient 
response status (see the Materials and methods section). In 
agreement with our computational analysis, we observed both 
plasma cells and inflammatory macrophages as associated with 
non-response to therapy (figure 3A,B plasma cell area under 
the curve (AUC)=71%, 81% by pathologist and quantification, 
respectively, inflammatory macrophages AUC=67% by pathol-
ogist), while total macrophages abundance was not predictive 
(AUC 48%).
For clinical feasibility, a biomarker must exhibit reproduc-
ibility and ease of use. Plasma cells have a unique morphology 
and can be sufficiently defined by a single marker, CD138.23 24 
We thus decided to focus on plasma cells and collected a second 
cohort consisting of 61 patients from two medical centres (35 
responders and 26 non-responders, table 2). We examined plasma 
cell frequencies by CD138+ IHC 
staining and again observed a 
significantly higher frequency of plasma cells in non-responders 
as evaluated by an expert pathologist and by automated quan-
tification (P=0.02 
and P=0.0005 by Student’s t-test, online 
supplementary figures 7A–B). This difference enabled predicting 
non-response class at baseline (figure 3C, 71% and 74% AUC, 
n=52, supplementary methods), which was further increased 
when we restricted our analyses only to highly inflamed tissues 
(figure 3D, AUC=82% 
and 84% by an expert pathologist and 
quantitatively, n=20, P=0.005/P=0.002 by Student’s t-test, 
online supplementary figure 7C). Taken together, our compu-

confirmed that pretreatment plasma cell abundance is associated

A dysregulated gene network masked by cell proportion 
variation
Given the differential abundance of inflammatory macro-
phages and plasma cells between the two response groups, we 
reasoned that underlying biological signals may be masked by 
this difference. To characterise the biological processes associ-
ated with non-response that cannot be explained by cell subsets 
differences, we searched for pathways and genes differentially 
expressed while adjusting each individual's gene expression 
profile for variations in the two cell subsets (see the Materials and

Figure 1 Characteristic sorted cell type expression of gene signatures of anti-TNFα response reported from heterogeneous tissue biopsy show 
contributions from distinct immune cell subsets. Analysis of the immune contribution of 109 unique signature genes mapped to a compendium 
of sorted cell expression profiles, spanning 17 immune cell subpopulations as well as colon tissue samples. Shown are the contributions (x-axis), 
that is, number of genes assigned, for eight major cell lineages (y-axis), highlighted into resting (light shade) and activated/memory (dark shade) 
subpopulations. Lineages are ordered by decreasing total contribution, with most signature genes are expressed in the myeloid, B and T-cell lineages 
(68%, 13% and 19% of the genes, respectively). Eighty-five per cent of signature genes are expressed in low abundance in bulk healthy colon.

methods section). We found 15 pathways that were dysregulated 
across all cohorts (FDR=0.05) using gene set enrichment anal-
ysis (GSEA),25 all of which were upregulated in non-responders 
and related to immune signalling and inflammation (figure 4A, 
online supplementary figure 8A,B). Most prominent was the 
association of non-response with the MyD88 deficiency (which 
impairs toll-like receptors (TLR2/4) function), interleukin 6 
signalling and antigen activation of B-cell receptor, which had 
a substantial fraction of genes in the GSEA-leading edge (64%, 
30% and 26% of genes, respectively (see online supplementary 
figure 8C)).
At the gene level, we identified 166 differentially expressed 
genes (DEG) in at least two cohorts following adjustment to 
plasma cells and activated monocytes (62 upregulated and 104 
downregulated, P≤0.05, online supplementary table 9). We 
analysed this set of genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA), in particular, searching for links to our predictive cellular 
biomarkers. One of the topmost enriched networks included 28 
genes, including the ligand–receptor pair, chemokine ligand 7 
(CCL7)–chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), which we found to be 
upregulated in non-responders (figure 4B, online supplementary 
table 11). The CCL7–CCR2 axis has been associated with inflam-
mation26 and upregulated in IBD.27 28 In the mucosa of patients 
with IBD, CCL7 is produced by epithelial cells and correlates 
with the degree of epithelial destruction at inflammation sites.29 
CCL7 is also produced by inflammatory lymphocytes including 
plasma cells, whereas CCR2 is expressed primarily on mono-
cytes and mediates their recruitment to inflamed tissues.28
Interestingly, IPA analysis identified triggering receptor 
expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) as an upstream regu-
lator of six of the adjustment-derived DEG, including CCL7.30 
TREM-1 is expressed on myeloid lineage cells including mono-
cytes and macrophages, has well-documented proinflammatory 
functions and its blockade has shown promising results in attenu-
ation of symptoms in IBD models.31 32 Meta-analysis of TREM-1, 
CCL7 and CCR2 gene expression across the public data biopsy 
cohorts showed all these genes to be consistently upregulated in 
the non-responder group in the original unadjusted measured 
data (meta-FDR <0.037). In addition, we directly tested differ-
ential expression of TNF-related genes and found TNFα and 
TNFR2 as upregulated in non-responders in the original unad-
justed data (figure 4C), possibly due to TREM-1 activation via

synergism with TLR signalling. Unlike CCL7 and CCR2, their 
expression difference post-adjustment was reduced, suggesting 
that TNFα secretion originates from the inflammatory macro-
phages (see online supplementary figure 9).33 Taken together, 
these results suggest that CCL7–CCR2 axis is responsible for the 
recruitment of inflammatory TNFα secreting macrophages to 
the inflamed area, which ultimately impacts response potential.
TreM-1 expression is a predictive biomarker in blood
From the point of view of clinical application, prognostic 
tests performed on blood samples are non-invasive and hence 
of high value. We looked at whether our findings could lead 
towards cellular or molecular biomarkers in blood samples. 
To do so, we profiled whole-blood gene expression from a 
cohort of 22 patients with CD prior to anti-TNFα therapy, 
whose subsequent response status has been determined simi-
larly to the primary biopsy validation cohort criteria (cohort 
3 in table 2, and the Materials and methods section). We 
focused our analysis on the TREM-1–CCL7–CCR2 axis and 
tested these genes in a hypothesis-directed manner only. Of 
these, TREM-1 was the only gene differentially expressed 
between responders and non-responders (downregulated 
in non-responders, adjusted P value=0.007, figure 5A and 
online supplementary figure 10) in blood and notably showed 
a very high prediction accuracy (figure 5B, AUC=94%). 
Importantly, TREM-1 was overall highly expressed (average 
log2-expression≥11.9) providing further confidence in the 
measured signal. In addition, we observed that TREM-1 
and CCR2 gene expression levels in blood were correlated 
with endoscopic activity in an additional cohort of patients 
with UC16 (see the Materials and methods section), further 
supporting monitoring of this axis in blood as an important 
clinical non-invasive biomarker.

Infiltrating and resident immune cells in the intestinal tissue 
are key factors in IBD aetiology and progression,34 as such, 
we undertook a cell-centred approach to analyse publicly 
available datasets of colon biopsies of patients with IBD. 
As cell subset variation is the biggest confounder of gene 
expression data signals,22 our analysis differs from previous 
studies of the same data10 11 13 15 and clearly delineates cell

estimated immune cell subsets proportion in colon biopsies

of intestinal plasma cells and inflammatory macrophages 
are increased in anti-TNFα non-responders. We validated 
plasma cell abundance as a robust biomarker of anti-TNFα 
non-response at baseline in two independent cohorts. Akin to 
how pathway-level analyses are more reproducible than single 
gene-level analysis,35 we expect the findings at the cell level 
to be more robust and reproducible than gene biomarkers

variation in the data, we show that the CCR2–CCL7 axis and 
its upstream regulator TREM-1 are involved in anti-TNFα 
responsiveness mechanism and identify TREM-1 expression 
in peripheral blood as a predictor of non-response.
Our findings suggest a link between chronic inflammation and 
anti-TNFα non-response physiology: during intestinal inflam-
mation, inflammatory macrophages secrete proinflammatory 
cytokines including TNFα.33 36 In the case of anti-TNFα non-re-
sponders, our analysis suggests increased abundance of inflam-
matory macrophages in the tissue, even prior to treatment. This 
likely results in elevated TNFα secretion at the inflammation 
site, as evidenced by the increased TNFα mRNA expression we 
detected in biopsies. Increased levels of TNFα have been shown 
to support plasma cell survival,30 37 and those in turn, in non-re-
sponders, are also at an increased abundance, as we validated in 
two separate patient cohorts. Ongoing inflammation and epithe-
lial damage trigger epithelial-mediated and lymphocyte-me-
diated secretion of CCL7, a promigratory cytokine, which 
increases monocyte migration to the inflamed colon where they 
differentiate into macrophages. TREM-1 which is an upstream 
regulator of the CCL7-CCR2 axis is expressed on monocytes 
and macrophages, supported by its reduced differential expres-
sion following cell proportion adjustment. TREM-1 is known to 
promote inflammation by driving robust production of inflam-
matory cytokines, including interleukin 8 and TNFα, especially 
in context of TLR pathways activation.38 39 In addition, TREM-1 
was shown to be upregulated by various stimuli such as the TLR 
ligands, including distinct microbial structures, and directly by 
TNFα, possibly suggesting that an altered microbiome compo-
sition between anti-TNFα responders and non-responders9 can 
influence its differential expression as well.
From a physiological perspective, this entire intercellular proin-
flammatory circuitry appears to be upregulated in non-responding 
individuals and is also supported by plasma cell accumulation in 
the colon mucosa being an early feature of IBD and predictor of 
shorter time to clinical relapse.40 41 During IFX therapy, circulating 
monocytes undergo apoptosis, and a shift towards proresolving 
macrophages occurs in the lamina propria, yielding reduced 
inflammation, tissue repair and remission.36 42 43 Our analysis 
post-treatment suggests this process occurs to a lesser extent in 
non-responding individuals implying that the immune milieu 
we observe in patients lies along a continuous immune-pheno-
typic inflammatory space, in which non-responders represent an 
extreme. If a non-responsive profile is merely a more exacerbated 
form of inflammation,16 then an increased drug dose may bring 
effective disease remission. In support of this, patients with acute 
severe colitis showed increased efficacy when treated with higher 
drug doses.44
Conversely, non-responders may represent a phenotypic niche 
which is difficult to resolve therapeutically via anti-TNFα treat-
ments, in which case based on baseline detection of non-response 
one may elect an alternative therapeutic. Our findings suggest 
that blocking the mechanism that draws increased numbers of 
plasma cells and inflammatory macrophages to intestinal mucosa 
would be of benefit. Indeed, experiments in mice showed that 
blocking CCR2, simultaneously with CCR5 and CXCR3, 
prevents experimental colitis.45–47
From a clinical perspective, a major implication of the current 
study is the possibility to predict response to anti-TNF treatment. 
As noted, the primary failure rate to anti-TNFα therapy is signif-
icant,4 resulting in accumulation of tissue damage and significant 
costs. We have demonstrated two approaches for predicting therapy 
response. The first is the quantitation of plasma cell frequency in 
the intestinal tissue as quantitated both by an expert pathologist 
and digital quantitation. Although yielding valuable physiolog-
ical information, this approach is disadvantaged by the need to 
perform pretreatment endoscopy. In addition, the performance of 
plasma cells as a cellular biomarker of response was improved as a 
function of inflammation severity in the biopsied tissue, indicating 
that plasma cell differences between response groups are likely a

secondary outcome of inflammation. Importantly, our results indi-
cate that measurement of pretreatment peripheral blood TREM-1 
expression may serve as a practical, easy to measure predictor for 
anti-TNF response. Once relevant cut-off values are determined, 
such measurements will allow to personalise treatment, prevent 
unnecessary tissue damage and expenditures.
Our study has several limitations. From an analysis perspective, 
the reference cell subset gene expression we used for the cellular 
deconvolution analysis is not a complete compendium of all of 
the immune cell types in the intestine (eg, missing are stromal 
cells, innate lymphoid cells, gamma delta T cells and others), 
and thus this may affect our interpretation. The biopsy valida-
tion study was performed using real-life pretreatment biopsies 
obtained without a predefined study protocol. While reassuring 
in terms of clinical relevance and unbiased study population, a 
predefined study protocol would potentially allow better clinical 
correlation and standardisation needed in the clinical setting, as 
well as more standardised tissue sampling. Similarly, the results 
obtained from peripheral blood were correlated with clinical 
scores and biomarker measurements but not with endoscopic 
scoring. Although CRP is more sensitive than clinical scoring to 
detect disease activity48 and faecal calprotectin correlates well 
with endoscopic scoring,49 the results require further confirma-
tion in a larger standardised clinical trial including endoscopic 
treatment outcomes. Additionally, we used data obtained from 
both UC and CD patients. While not conforming with the 
accepted regulatory approaches for the differential study of these 
diseases, this approach may actually represent an investigational 
advantage since it relates directly to the biological characteristics 
of drug response and thus aids in the dissection of the relevant 
molecular events associated with it. Last, our results do not yet 
provide an understanding of how these distinct immune milieus 
we observed between the response groups come about; to do so 
will require longitudinal studies tracking patients with early IBD.
In conclusion, we identify here novel predictors for anti-TNF 
therapy in biopsy and blood, stemming from public domain data 
and validated on real-life patient cohorts. The statistical meth-
odology we use for discovery, combining cell-centred decon-
volution17 with meta-analysis,21 allows to unmask and better 
interpret signals normally hidden from view while increasing 
detection power and reproducibility of findings. This method-
ology may of course be extended further into other scenarios 
and disease conditions, especially with the vast amounts of data 
now available in the public domain.
