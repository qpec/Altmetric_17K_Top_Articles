BACKGROUND
Abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone improves survival in men with relapsed pros-
tate cancer. We assessed the effect of this combination in men starting long-term 
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), using a multigroup, multistage trial design.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive ADT alone or ADT plus abir-
aterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and prednisolone (5 mg daily) (combination therapy). 
Local radiotherapy was mandated for patients with node-negative, nonmetastatic 
disease and encouraged for those with positive nodes. For patients with nonmeta-
static disease with no radiotherapy planned and for patients with metastatic disease, 
treatment continued until radiologic, clinical, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) pro-
gression; otherwise, treatment was to continue for 2 years or until any type of progres-
sion, whichever came first. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. The 
intermediate primary outcome was failure-free survival (treatment failure was de-
fined as radiologic, clinical, or PSA progression or death from prostate cancer).
RESULTS
A total of 1917 patients underwent randomization from November 2011 through 
January 2014. The median age was 67 years, and the median PSA level was 53 ng per 
milliliter. A total of 52% of the patients had metastatic disease, 20% had node-positive 
or node-indeterminate nonmetastatic disease, and 28% had node-negative, nonmeta-
static disease; 95% had newly diagnosed disease. The median follow-up was 40 
months. There were 184 deaths in the combination group as compared with 262 in 
the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.76; 
P<0.001); the hazard ratio was 0.75 in patients with nonmetastatic disease and 0.61 
in those with metastatic disease. There were 248 treatment-failure events in the 
combination group as compared with 535 in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 
0.29; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.34; P<0.001); the hazard ratio was 0.21 in patients with non-
metastatic disease and 0.31 in those with metastatic disease. Grade 3 to 5 adverse 
events occurred in 47% of the patients in the combination group (with nine grade 5 
events) and in 33% of the patients in the ADT-alone group (with three grade 5 events).
CONCLUSIONS
Among men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, ADT plus abiraterone 
and prednisolone was associated with significantly higher rates of overall and 
failure-free survival than ADT alone. (Funded by Cancer Research U.K. and others;

T
he Systemic Therapy in Advancing 
or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation 
of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) trial recruits 
patients commencing long-term androgen-depri-
vation therapy (ADT; orchiectomy or gonadotropin-
releasing hormone [GnRH] agonists or antago-
nists) for the first time for locally advanced or 
metastatic prostate cancer. Several agents have 
improved overall survival (docetaxel, abiraterone 
acetate, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, radium-223, 
and sipuleucel-T)1-8 or reduced morbidity (zole-
dronic acid and denosumab)9-11 among such pa-
tients. These agents were initially investigated in 
men with very advanced disease whose tumors 
had progressed during first-line ADT, a disease 
state now termed castration-resistant prostate 
cancer.
The STAMPEDE trial uses a novel multigroup, 
multistage (also called multiarm, multistage 
[MAMS]) platform design12-14 to test whether the 
addition of further treatments to ADT improves 
overall survival if used in the first-line setting. It 
uses intermediate activity analyses, based on 
failure-free survival, to cease randomization to 
research groups that are insufficiently active.12-14 
We have previously reported that treatment with 
docetaxel at the inception of ADT increased me-
dian survival from 71 months to 81 months as 
well as overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 
0.76).15,16 These results, along with those of a 
systematic review that included other trials17-19 
and of a meta-analysis,16 led to docetaxel becom-
ing a part of the standard of care for suitable 
patients with prostate cancer who had not re-
ceived previous hormone therapy.
An important mechanism for escape from 
tumor control by androgen ablation includes the 
intracellular conversion of steroid precursors to 
androgenic steroids by prostate-cancer cells. 
Abiraterone acetate is a selective, irreversible in-
hibitor of CYP17, an enzyme that is critical in the 
production of androgens in the testes, adrenal 
glands, and prostate-tumor tissue. Inhibition of 
CYP17 in combination with ADT results in a 
more effective androgen depletion than can be 
induced by surgical castration or by GnRH ana-
logues alone.20 Two large, phase 3 trials showed 
that the addition of abiraterone acetate with pred-
nisolone to standard-of-care therapy prolonged 
survival among men with castration-resistant 
prostate cancer.4,5,21 The STAMPEDE trial is inves-
tigating whether the earlier use of abiraterone in 
men who are initiating long-term ADT could 
improve survival.
Methods
Trial Design and Patients
We used a multigroup, multistage platform de-
sign, incorporating a seamless phase 2–3 com-
ponent. The primary outcome was overall sur-
vival, defined as the time from randomization to 
death from any cause. The intermediate primary 
outcome was failure-free survival, defined as the 
time to the first of the following forms of treat-
ment failure: biochemical (prostate-specific anti-
gen [PSA]) failure (see the protocol, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org); 
progression of local, lymph-node, or distant 
metastases; or death from prostate cancer. Second-
ary outcome measures included adverse events, 
symptomatic skeletal events, progression-free 
survival (i.e., failure-free survival excluding bio-
chemical failure), prostate cancer–specific sur-
vival, and (data not shown) quality of life.
The rationale and design were described pre-
viously.12-14,22 Full details are provided in the pro-
tocol. In summary, eligible patients had prostate 
cancer that was newly diagnosed and metastatic, 
node-positive, or high-risk locally advanced (with 
at least two of following: a tumor stage of T3 or 
T4, a Gleason score of 8 to 10, and a PSA level 
≥40 ng per milliliter) or disease that was previ-
ously treated with radical surgery or radiother-
apy and was now relapsing with high-risk fea-
tures (in men no longer receiving therapy, a PSA 
level >4 ng per milliliter with a doubling time of 
<6 months, a PSA level >20 ng per milliliter, 
nodal or metastatic relapse, or <12 months of 
total ADT with an interval of >12 months with-
out treatment). Patients were intended for treat-
ment with long-term ADT that started no longer 
than 12 weeks before randomization. There were 
no age restrictions. Patients with clinically sig-
nificant cardiovascular disease (e.g., severe angi-
na, recent myocardial infarction, or a history of 
cardiac failure) were excluded.
Trial Oversight and Conduct

Abiraterone for Prostate Cancer
London (UCL). MRC provided funding for the 
trial through core funding to UCL. Cancer Re-
search U.K. approved the trial design and subse-
quent amendments and provided funding sup-
port but had no further input. Janssen approved 
the design for this comparison (ADT plus abira-
terone and prednisolone vs. ADT alone) and 
participated in discussions on the progress of 
the trial. Janssen also provided grant funding, 
abiraterone acetate, and funds for drug distribu-
tion. Representatives from Janssen were invited 
to comment on the manuscript. Further funding 
for the platform was provided by Astellas Pharma, 
Clovis Oncology, Novartis, Pfizer, and Sanofi 
Aventis. The trial was conducted in accordance 
with the principles of Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, and 
the appropriate regulatory and ethics approvals 
were obtained. All the patients provided written 
informed consent.
The analyses were driven by prespecified cri-
teria, and the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication was made by the members of the 
Trial Management Group. Three authors at the 
MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL accessed the raw 
data; processed data that were released by the 
independent data monitoring committee and trial 
steering committee were available to all the co-
authors. The authors vouch for the completeness 
and accuracy of the data and analyses and for the 
adherence of the trial to the protocol. No one 
who is not an author contributed to the writing 
of the manuscript.
Randomization and Masking
Randomization was performed centrally by tele-
phone with the use of a computerized algorithm, 
which was developed and maintained by the MRC 
Clinical Trials Unit at UCL. Minimization with a 
random element of 80% was used, with stratifi-
cation according to randomizing center, age at 
randomization (<70 vs. ≥70 years), the presence 
or absence of metastases, planned use of pros-
tate radiotherapy (yes vs. no), nodal involvement 
(negative vs. indeterminate vs. positive), World 
Health Organization performance status (0 vs. 
1 or 2 [on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher numbers 
indicating greater disability]), type of ADT, and 
regular, long-term use of aspirin or nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs (yes vs. no). The assign-
ment ratio was 1:1 to standard of care alone or 
with abiraterone acetate and prednisolone (combi-
nation therapy). The comparison was open-label, 
because masking of the treatment assignment 
was deemed impracticable. Eligible patients could 
be assigned to any of the trial groups that were 
open; we focus here on patients assigned con-
temporaneously to ADT alone or with abiraterone 
and prednisolone.
Procedures
ADT was given for at least 2 years; radiotherapy 
at 6 to 9 months after randomization was man-
datory for patients with node-negative, nonmeta-
static disease and optional for patients with node-
positive, nonmetastatic disease. Abiraterone 
(1000 mg) with prednisolone (5 mg) was given 
once daily. The treatment duration depended on 
disease stage and intent for radical radiotherapy: 
for patients with nonmetastatic disease with no 
radiotherapy planned and for patients with meta-
static disease, treatment continued until PSA, 
radiologic, or clinical progression or until an-
other treatment was started; for patients with 
nonmetastatic disease with radiotherapy planned, 
treatment was to continue for 2 years or until 
any type of progression, whichever came first. 
Dose modifications are described in the protocol.
Patients were assessed every 6 weeks during 
the first 6 months, then every 12 weeks until 
2 years, then every 6 months until 5 years, and 
then annually; in addition, patients receiving 
combination therapy were assessed at least every 
3 months. Assessments included PSA testing and 
ascertainment of adverse events; further tests 
were conducted at the discretion of the treating 
physician. The nadir PSA level (for the definition 
of PSA progression) was defined as the lowest 
level within 24 weeks after randomization. There 
was no protocol-mandated imaging except at 
baseline. Adverse events were assessed with the 
use of the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (initial-
ly, version 3.0; later, version 4.0). Serious adverse 
events and reactions were reported accordingly.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was calculated with the use of 
Stata nstage and predecessor programs that allow 
for the design of multigroup, multistage trials.23

and a median overall survival between 4 and

5 years for ADT, we targeted a 25% relative dif-
ference between the combination group and the 
ADT-alone group for both failure-free survival 
(hazard ratio for treatment failure, 0.75) and 
overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75). 
The main analysis for the comparison of combi-
nation therapy against control for survival could 
be performed after the occurrence of approxi-
mately 267 deaths in the control group for 90% 
power and a one-sided alpha level of 2.5%, after 
we accounted for three intermediate lack-of-
benefit analyses of failure-free survival. An inde-
pendent data monitoring committee reviewed 
accumulating data, guided by lack-of-benefit 
stopping guidelines.
Data on patients without an event of interest 
were censored when they were last known to be 
event-free. The median follow-up was determined 
through reversing death and censoring indica-
tors. Standard survival-analysis methods were 
used to analyze time-to-event data in Stata soft-
ware, version 14, with Kaplan–Meier estimates 
for survival curves and Cox proportional-hazards 
models to estimate relative treatment effects. 
These estimates were adjusted for stratification 
factors (except randomizing center and ADT 
method) and were stratified according to time 
periods defined by corecruiting groups. A hazard 
ratio of less than 1.00 favored the combination 
group. The restricted mean survival time (restrict-
ed to 54 months) was calculated from flexible 
parametric models (5 degrees of freedom). The 
proportional-hazards assumption was tested; the 
restricted mean survival time was emphasized in 
the presence of nonproportionality. All the con-
fidence intervals are at the 95% level. Prespeci-
fied subgroup analyses looked at the consistency 
of treatment effect according to stratification 
factors, time period, categorized Gleason score, 
and quintiles of PSA levels that were measured 
before the initiation of long-term ADT. Key sub-
group analyses according to metastatic status 
were prespecified. Exploratory analyses considered 
prostate cancer–specific survival and progression-
free survival according to the age at random-
ization.
All the patients were included in the efficacy 
analyses under their assigned treatment on an 
intention-to-treat basis. For safety analyses, pa-
tients were grouped according to the treatment 
that they started. In the analysis of the median 
duration of abiraterone treatment, data were cen-
sored at the date of last contact with the patient 
if the patient had not reported stopping the drug.
Results
Patients
Between November 15, 2011, and January 17, 
2014, a total of 1917 consenting patients at 111 
U.K. and 5 Swiss sites underwent randomization 
(957 to ADT alone and 960 to combination 
therapy). Data were frozen on February 10, 2017. 
The flow of patients through the trial is shown 
in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org; the baseline characteris-
tics of the patients are shown in Table 1, and in 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The 
median PSA level was 53 ng per milliliter. The 
median follow-up was 40 months.
Treatment
The median time from randomization to the ini-
tiation of abiraterone was 1.3 weeks, and the 
median time from the initiation of ADT to the 
initiation of abiraterone was 8.0 weeks (most pa-
tients started ADT before randomization) (Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 960 
patients in the combination group, 10 (1%) did 
not receive abiraterone, mostly because they de-
clined treatment. The median duration of abira-
terone treatment was 23.7 months in the patients 
for whom the duration was capped at 2 years 
(67% reported stopping for treatment comple-
tion) and 33.2 months in the patients who could 
continue through progression (51% reported per-
manent stopping for progression and 20% for 
excessive toxic effects) (Table S2 and Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 265 
patients (28%) had not yet permanently stopped 
treatment with abiraterone at the time of this 
report.
The planned rate of use of radiotherapy was 
41% in the combination group and in the ADT-
alone group. The reported rate of use of radio-
therapy was 39% in the combination group and 
40% in the ADT-alone group.
Overall Survival
There were 184 deaths in the combination group 
and 262 in the ADT-alone group. There was 
strong evidence of a survival advantage in the 
combination group, with a 3-year survival of 
83% as compared with 76% in the ADT-alone

group (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.76; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). 
There was no evidence of nonproportional haz-
ards (P 
= 
0.31) or of heterogeneity of the treat-
ment effect according to metastatic status at 
randomization. A preplanned subgroup analysis 
of 1002 patients with metastatic disease at entry 
included 368 deaths (Fig. 1C). The same com-
parisons in patients without metastatic disease 
at randomization are immature, currently with 
78 deaths in total (Fig. 1E). There was no evi-
dence of heterogeneity of effect in other sub-
groups (Fig. 2A).
Failure-free Survival
There were 248 events of treatment failure (radio-
logic, clinical, or PSA progression or death from 
prostate cancer) in the combination group and 535 
in the ADT-alone group. The 3-year failure-free 
survival was 75% in the combination group and 
45% in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio for treat-
ment failure, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.34; P<0.001) 
(Fig. 1B). There was evidence of nonproportional 
hazards (P 
= 
0.001), so we present restricted 
mean failure-free survival time: 43.9 months in 
the combination group and 30.0 months in the 
ADT-alone group in the first 54 months after 
randomization, a difference of 13.9 months 
(95% CI, 12.3 to 15.4). The effect of abiraterone 
on failure-free survival was noted in all sub-
groups (Fig. 1D, Fig. 1F, and Fig. 2B).
Other Efficacy Outcome Measures
There were 198 events of radiologic or clinical 
progression or death from prostate cancer in the 
combination group and 379 in the ADT-alone 
group. The 3-year progression-free survival was 
80% in the combination group and 62% in the 
ADT-alone group (hazard ratio for clinical or 
radiologic progression or death from prostate 
cancer, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.47; P<0.001) (Fig. 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were 
113 symptomatic skeletal events reported so far 
in the combination group and 203 in the ADT-
alone group. The 3-year rate without symptom-
atic skeletal events was 88% in the combination 
group and 78% in the ADT-alone group (hazard 
ratio for symptomatic skeletal events, 0.46; 95% 
CI, 0.37 to 0.58; P<0.001) (Fig. S4A in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). This difference was most 
marked in the subgroup of patients with meta-
static disease (Fig. S4B in the Supplementary 
Appendix). A total of 140 of the 184 deaths in 
the combination group (76%) and 216 of the 262 
deaths in the ADT-alone group (82%) were attrib-
uted to prostate cancer on central review. The 
competing-risks subhazard ratio for death from 
prostate cancer was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.72).
Exploratory Analyses
Exploratory analyses that considered the outcomes 
of progression-free and prostate cancer–specific 
survival within subgroups of age at randomiza-
tion suggested a favorable treatment effect re-
gardless of age; proportionally fewer events were 
noted in older patients. In patients younger than 
70 years of age, there were 113 events of radio-
logic or clinical progression or death from pros-
tate cancer in the combination group and 263 in 
the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 
0.29 to 0.45); in patients 70 years of age or older, 
there were 65 events in the combination group 
and 116 in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 
0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P 
= 
0.10 for interac-
tion). In patients younger than 70 years of age, 
there were 93 deaths from prostate cancer in the 
combination group and 154 in the ADT-alone 
group (subhazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.39 to 
0.66); in patients 70 years of age or older, there 
were 47 deaths from prostate cancer in the com-
bination group and 62 in the ADT-alone group 
(subhazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.17; 
P 
= 
0.08 for interaction).
Adverse Events
Patients in the safety population who reported 
adverse events of grade 3 or higher during their 
entire time in the trial numbered 443 of 948 
(47%) in the combination group and 315 of 960 
(33%) in the ADT-alone group (Table 2). There 
were 12 grade 5 adverse events, including 9 in 
the combination group (2 events of pneumonia 
[1 including sepsis], 2 events of stroke, and 1 event 
each of dyspnea, lower respiratory tract infection, 
Figure 1 (facing page). Overall Survival and Failure-free 
Survival in All Patients and According to Metastatic 
Status at Randomization (Intention-to-Treat Population).
Combination therapy was androgen‑deprivation therapy 
(ADT) plus abiraterone acetate and prednisolone. Treat‑
ment failure was defined as radiologic, clinical, or 
prostate‑specific antigen (PSA) progression or death 
from prostate cancer.

liver failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and chest 
infection) and 3 in the ADT-alone group (2 events 
of myocardial infarction and 1 event of broncho-
pneumonia). Among the 1476 patients in the 
safety population in whom progression had not 
occurred within the first year, the prevalence of 
adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 15% in 
the combination group and 11% in the ADT-
alone group. The main additional adverse events 
over and above the control therapy were hyper-
tension, mild increases in aminotransferase levels, 
and respiratory disorders. Further details, includ-
ing an overview according to age, are provided 
in Tables S4 through S32 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. The pattern and levels of adverse 
events were similar in the intention-to-treat popu-
lation.
Treatment after Progression
There are emerging differences in the therapies 
used at relapse (Fig. 3, and Table S3 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The median time from 
relapse to life-prolonging therapy for castration-
resistant prostate cancer (abiraterone, enzaluta-
mide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, or radium-223) or 
any subsequent therapy was similar in the two 
groups, but absolute numbers of patients report-
ing life-prolonging or any treatment after pro-
gression were higher in the ADT-alone group 
than in the combination group (ADT-alone group, 
310 and 477, respectively, of 957 patients; com-
bination group, 131 and 196, respectively, of 
960 patients). The use of abiraterone at relapse 
in patients who received abiraterone as primary 
therapy was lower in patients in the combination 
group than in patients in the ADT-alone group; 
patients in the combination group could con-
tinue abiraterone beyond the first event of radio-
logic, clinical, or PSA progression until all three 
protocol-defined progression types were reached.

Abiraterone for Prostate Cancer
higher in the combination group than in the 
ADT-alone group. Because 1471 of the men (77%) 
in this comparison remain alive, these data will 
evolve with time as more patients have a relapse 
and receive further treatments.
Discussion
STAMPEDE is a multigroup, multistage platform 
trial protocol investigating the efficacy of addi-
tional therapy at the time of inception of primary 
ADT in men with newly diagnosed, locally ad-
vanced, or metastatic disease or in those with 
relapsing disease and poor prognostic features. 
This is the sixth comparison in the trial for which 
we are reporting survival data15,16,24-27 and the first 
comparison incorporated after trial initiation.22
The use of ADT plus abiraterone and predniso-
lone as compared with ADT alone was associat-
ed with a 71% relative improvement in the time 
to treatment failure, which translated into a 37% 
difference in overall survival. These findings were 
consistent in patients with metastatic disease 
and those with nonmetastatic disease, although 
most deaths have occurred in the patients with 
metastatic disease. The between-group difference 
in survival among the patients with nonmeta-
static disease, which is underpinned by a large 
difference in failure-free survival, occurred even 
though abiraterone was administered for 2 years 
or less in this group.
There was good adherence to abiraterone, 
which was associated with acceptable adverse-
event rates, with most patients stopping therapy 
owing to the completion of planned therapy or 
protocol-defined progression rather than toxic 
effects. Adverse events were in line with previous 
experience in castration-resistant prostate can-
cer,4,5,21 despite the longer absolute duration of 
therapy, particularly in the patients with meta-
static disease. Nearly 300 patients are still re-
ceiving treatment. Few patients stopped treat-
ment because of side effects, but there were 
more grade 3 to 5 adverse events reported in the 
combination group than in the ADT-alone group. 
The lower dose of prednisolone that was used 
does not seem to have influenced the rate of 
pharmacologically relevant severe adverse events, 
such as hypertension or hypokalemia.20
The strengths of the comparison in this trial 
include broad recruitment through an academic 
network (116 centers, including most U.K. on-
cology centers, in collaboration with the Swiss 
Group for Clinical Cancer Research) encompass-
ing a wide range of disease states. The size of 
the trial permits some examination of inter-
actions, including those with other treatments 
known to be effective (e.g., radiotherapy) and 
prognostic factors used for stratification at ran-
domization. Effects in all subgroups were simi-
lar, with no evidence of heterogeneity. The appar-
ent inconsistency in survival-effect size in men 
70 years of age or older is probably an artifact 
arising from a small number of events; the ab-
solute difference is only 8 deaths (74 in the 
combination group and 82 in the ADT-alone 
group). The result is complicated by a higher risk 
of death from coexisting conditions and a rela-
tively shorter follow-up among older men, because 
a higher proportion were recruited later, after 
recruitment to the docetaxel comparison in the 
protocol was completed. Results for failure-free, 
progression-free, and prostate cancer–specific 
survival showed a benefit of abiraterone in men 
regardless of age. Further exploration is possible 
in a preplanned meta-analysis with two other 
trials investigating the addition of abiraterone to 
standard ADT with overlapping patient inclu-
sions: LATITUDE (to be published on June 4, 
2017, at NEJM.org)28 and PEACE1 (ClinicalTrials 
.gov number, NCT01957436).
The effect size that we report with abiraterone 
is a little larger with respect to overall survival 
and substantially larger with respect to failure-
free survival than the effect size that we report-
ed with the addition of docetaxel in a similar 
patient group. The trial results raise the question 
of what should be regarded as the contemporary 
standard of care. Abiraterone has a better side-
effect profile than docetaxel and is an easier 
treatment to administer logistically. Conversely, 
the treatment duration is longer, some patients 
have long-term effects of glucocorticoid use, and 
cost is a consideration. In the absence of com-
parative data, patient choice and the ability of 
health care systems to support the use of these 
drugs will determine the relative use of docetaxel 
and abiraterone.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Perhaps a more important question is whether 
the benefits of docetaxel and abiraterone can be 
combined. Although docetaxel may work in part 
by targeting the androgen-receptor pathway,29 it 
generally has a different mechanism of action 
than abiraterone, and abiraterone is active after 
docetaxel use.5 Thus, there may be an additive 
effect of giving abiraterone immediately after 
docetaxel in prostate cancer not previously treat-
ed with hormone therapy. Some future informa-
tion will emerge from the STAMPEDE trial, which 
includes a further comparison involving abira-
terone plus enzalutamide in which docetaxel was 
permitted as part of the standard of care in pa-
tients who had undergone randomization start-
ing in 2016. The PEACE1 trial also now includes 
patients receiving docetaxel as part of the stan-
dard of care and will help address the question 
of whether the benefits seen with docetaxel15-17 
are overlapping or additional to those seen with 
abiraterone.
Finally, the design used in the trial has al-
lowed the STAMPEDE investigators to address 
multiple questions within a single trial platform, 
making efficient use of control-group patients.22 
The current abiraterone comparison eventually 
recruited 1917 patients in 2 years 3 months, well 
ahead of target and underlining the power of 
this design to address multiple questions effi-
ciently and rapidly. There are three further ran-
domizations within the trial that will yield sur-
vival results in the coming years, which means 
that a single protocol will have answered at least 
10 different primary questions in 15 years; two 
further comparisons are also in the late stages 
of planning. To address as many questions in 
separate trials would have taken considerably 
longer and required far more control-group 
patients.
In conclusion, men with locally advanced or 
metastatic prostate cancer who received ADT 
plus abiraterone and prednisolone had signifi-
cantly higher rates of overall and failure-free 
survival than those who received ADT alone. In 
addition, combination therapy was associated 
with fewer symptomatic skeletal events.
