Background:  
Opportunistic assessment of sarcopenia on CT examinations is becoming increasingly common. 
This study aimed to determine relationships between CT-measured skeletal muscle size and 
attenuation with one-year risk of mortality in older adults enrolled in a Medicare Shared Savings 
Program (MSSP). 
Methods:  
Relationships between skeletal muscle metrics and all-cause mortality were determined in 436 
participants (52% women, mean age 75 years) who had abdominopelvic CT examinations. On 
CT images, skeletal muscles were segmented at the level of L3 using two methods: 1) all 
muscles with a threshold of -29 to +150 Hounsfield units (HU), using a dedicated segmentation 
software, 2) left psoas muscle using a free-hand region of interest tool on a clinical workstation. 
Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle attenuation were measured. Cox regression 
models were fit to determine associations between muscle metrics and mortality, adjusting for 
age, sex, race, smoking status, cancer diagnosis, and Charlson comorbidity index. 
Results:  
Within one year of follow-up, 20.6% (90/436) participants died. In the fully-adjusted model, 
higher muscle index and muscle attenuation were associated with lower risk of mortality. A one-
unit standard deviation (SD) increase was associated with a HR=0.69 (95% CI=0.49, 0.96; 
p=0.03) for total muscle index, HR=0.67 (95% CI=0.49, 0.90; p<0.01) for psoas muscle index, 
HR=0.54 (95% CI=0.40, 0.74; p<0.01) for total muscle attenuation, and HR=0.79 (95% CI=0.66, 
0.95; p=0.01) for psoas muscle attenuation.

Introduction 
Sarcopenia is a common medical condition defined by decreased muscle mass and 
muscle function (1). Although usually diagnosed using a combination of functional measures and 
dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived appendicular lean mass, sarcopenia can also be 
evaluated using computed tomography (CT) (1-4). Unlike DXA, which only measures muscle 
quantity, CT measures muscle quantity (e.g., muscle cross-sectional area or muscle index) and 
muscle quality (e.g., muscle attenuation or radiodensity) (3,4). Lower CT attenuation of muscle 
is usually due to increased deposition of adipose tissue in muscle and the accumulation of lipid 
within muscle, known as “myosteotosis” (1). There is increasing interest in developing clinically 
relevant approaches to the evaluation of sarcopenia using CT, but more data is needed on the 
relationship between CT-derived muscle metrics and relevant health outcomes, including 
mortality.   
In many high-risk populations, CT-derived muscle metrics have been shown to predict 
mortality (5-16). Excess mortality has been variably associated with CT measures of skeletal 
muscle index and muscle attenuation (5-16). Most of these studies have used abdominopelvic 
CTs to measure either all of the visualized muscles at the level of L3 or just the psoas muscles 
(5-16). No prior study has investigated these CT metrics in an opportunistic setting, without 
selecting a study cohort already associated with high mortality.  
Patients enrolled in a Medicare Shared Savings Plan (MSSP) serve as a relevant cohort in 
which to evaluate the opportunistic screening for sarcopenia using CT. The MSSP patients are 
enrolled in a value-based contract where Medicare adjusts reimbursement depending on metrics 
that evaluate how well the patients are managed. Ideally, opportunistic CT measurements of

muscle would be combined with the electronic health record (EHR) to help determine patient 
prognosis. The purpose of our study was to determine if routine CT examinations in patients 
from the MSSP could be used to predict one-year mortality, after adjustment for common 
covariates known to impact mortality readily available in the EHR. Our hypothesis was that 
higher muscle quantity and quality would be associated with improved survival. 
 
Materials and Methods 
This retrospective cohort study was conducted among the MSSP-ACO population at 
Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. “Further information about MSSP can be found on: 
https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-
Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/about.html. As of 12/1/2016, there were 12,798 individuals 
attributed to our health system’s MSSP-ACO population. For this study,  inclusion criteria were: 
age 65 years or older, North Carolina Residency, and the presence of a non-contrast 
abdominopelvic CT examination (CPT code: 74176) within the span of 6 months (10/1/2014 - 
04/01/2015). The follow-up period for mortality was defined as 365 days after the date of CT. 
Cases were identified and data were extracted from Clarity (EPIC electronic data warehouse). 
The study was approved by the Wake Forest Institutional Review Board. 
CT Evaluation 
 
Various abdominopelvic multidetector CT protocols were used. Acquisition parameters 
were: 100-140 kVp, variable mAs (depending on patient size), 2.5-3.00 mm detector collimation.  
CT scans were acquired using 7 different General Electric and Siemens systems.

On CT images, skeletal muscles were segmented at the level of L3 vertebra using two 
methods. The first method used dedicated segmentation software (Mimics version 19.0; 
Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). On a single CT image, all visualized muscles with a threshold of 
-29 to +150 HU were segmented, including rectus abdominis, internal and external obliques, 
transversus abdominis, quadratus lumborum, psoas major and minor, erector spinae, and 
latissimus dorsi muscles, as previously validated (10). The second method used a clinical Picture 
Archiving and Communication System (PACS) workstation (iSite version 3.6, Philips 
Healthcare). On a single CT image, left psoas muscle was segmented using a free-hand region of 
interest tool, without applying muscle thresholds, as previously validated (17).  
Using both segmentation methods, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle 
attenuation were recorded. Muscle index variables were derived from CSA (cm2) scaled to 
patient height (m2). Height was not statistically associated with mortality and did not act as a 
confounder for index predictors. 
The CT-based muscle analysis was standardized by following the Standard Operating 
Procedures manual (17). All CT images with measurements were archived and validated for 
measurement accuracy by two musculoskeletal radiologists (LL and RB), blinded to patient 
outcomes. CT images with asymmetry between psoas muscles (due to scoliosis, degenerative 
diseases, or prior surgery) as well as scans with other internal or external artifacts were excluded 
(n=35). Using the same methodology, our interclass correlation coefficients were 0.84-0.9 
(17,18).

Mortality data from the EHR was supplemented with the North Carolina State Center for 
Health Statistics death index, which is deterministically matched to data from EHR on a monthly 
basis.  For patients confirmed as deceased, length of follow-up was determined in days from date 
of initial CT visit to date of death. All other participants were right-censored at 365 days post CT 
visit.    
Statistical Analysis  
For demographic and outcome measures, summary statistics were determined as counts and 
percentages for categorical variables and as medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. 
Four predictor variables were considered: 1) total muscle index, 2) total muscle attenuation, 3) psoas 
muscle index, and 4) psoas muscle attenuation. Correlations between the four predictor variables were 
analyzed by Pearson’s correlation. 
Cox proportional hazard regression models were fit to the CT metrics with adjustment for 
covariates known to be associated with mortality including age, sex (female vs male), race (Caucasian vs 
African American or Other), smoking history, diagnosis of cancer, and Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI) (categorized: 0, 1-4, and >=5) in the EHR. The diagnosis of cancer and CCI were determined by 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes prior to or on the date of the CT. ICD-9 codes for 
cancer were 140.x-209.3x, 239.x, and V10.x.  
Splines with three knots were fit to the continuous variable, age, to relax normality assumptions. 
Three models were used to examine the relationships between CT muscle metrics and mortality: 1) 
unadjusted, 2) adjusted for age, sex, race, 3) adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, cancer, and CCI.  
The variance inflation factor was used to assess multicollinearity. For all models with covariates, 
the variance inflation factor was < 2 for all variables indicating that multicollinearity was not an issue. 
Martingale residuals and Shoenfeld residuals were examined to confirm linear relationships and to verify

the proportional hazard assumption respectively. No non-linear relationships were apparent on 
examination of Martingale residual plots and Shoenfeld residual plots with respective chi-square test 
indicated that the global models and each of its components met the assumption of proportional hazards.  
Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous variables by 
comparing the risk of mortality per standard deviation of each muscle metric. For each muscle metric, 
Kaplan-Meier survival plots were plotted and stratified into standardized score categories: Z ≤ −1; Z > −1 
and Z ≤ 1; and Z > 1.  
Data analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3. 
 
Results 
 
511 participants in the MSSP had a non-contrast abdominopelvic CT examination within the 6-
month timeframe. Of these, 40 were excluded due to out-of-state or indeterminate residency status and 35 
were excluded due to suboptimal CT image quality. The remaining 436 participants met the study 
inclusion criteria. 
Table 1 presents demographic characteristics, muscle metrics, and survival data. The mean age 
was 75 years (SD: 7.8). The study cohort included 51.6% women and 24.8% African Americans and other 
race categories. After one year of follow-up, 90 of 436 (20.6%) patients died. Compared to the survivor 
group, the deceased group had a significantly higher CCI and a larger proportion of cancer diagnoses. 
Compared to the survivor group, the deceased group had a significantly lower muscle index and muscle 
attenuation. 
Muscle index measures were moderately correlated (r=0.52, p<0.01) as were muscle attenuation 
measures (r=0.64, p<0.01). In contrast, only weak correlation was present between total muscle index and 
total muscle attenuation (r=0.18, p<0.01) as well as between psoas muscle index and psoas muscle 
attenuation (r=0.14, p<0. 01).

Relationships between muscle indices and mortality within one year are shown in Table 2. 
Increased muscle index was associated with decreased mortality in the models adjusted for age, sex, race, 
smoking status, cancer diagnosis, and CCI. A one-unit SD increase in total muscle index was associated 
with a 31% decrease in risk of mortality. A one-unit SD increase in psoas muscle index was associated 
with a 33% decrease in risk of mortality.  
Relationships between muscle attenuation and one-year mortality are shown in Table 3. 
Increased muscle attenuation was associated with decreased mortality in the models adjusted for age, sex, 
race, current smoking, cancer diagnosis, and CCI. A one-unit SD increase in total muscle attenuation was 
associated with a 46% decrease in mortality. A one-unit SD increase in psoas muscle attenuation was 
associated with a 21% decrease in mortality.  
Table 4 presents muscle metrics stratified into standardized Z-score categories, based on the 
cohort median muscle metrics. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for total muscle index and psoas muscle 
index are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Comparing patients at least 1 SD below the cohort median muscle 
index, the patients with more muscle (higher muscle index) had more favorable overall survival at each 
time point.  
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for total muscle attenuation and psoas muscle attenuation are 
shown in Figures 3 and 4. Comparing patients at least 1 SD below the cohort median muscle attenuation, 
the patients with higher muscle attenuation (lower myosteotosis) had more favorable overall survival at 
each time point. 
 
Discussion 
While the majority of prior CT studies of sarcopenia and mortality have focused on high-
risk populations, this is the first truly opportunistic study of older adults, showing a robust 
association of CT muscle metrics with all-cause mortality.

CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis are commonly used to evaluate a wide range 
of medical conditions. In addition to providing data related to the specific reasons that the CT 
examinations were obtained, the CT images can be “opportunistically” evaluated to provide 
quantitative measurements related to a number of chronic conditions, including sarcopenia (19).  
In the era of increasing use of informatics in clinical medicine, these secondary analyses of CT 
images can be easily linked to other data elements in the EHR. The goal of this study was to 
assess the relationship between CT-derived quantitative muscle metrics and the one-year risk of 
mortality in Medicare patients to determine whether this information might provide additional 
prognostic information.  
The novel finding in this study of older adults is that measures of sarcopenia (e.g., lower 
muscle index and muscle attenuation) on abdominopelvic CT were associated with increased risk 
of all-cause mortality, thereby confirming our initial hypothesis. Importantly, the association of 
muscle metrics with mortality persisted in all of our models, even after adjusting for the 
diagnosis of cancer and CCI.   
The majority of prior studies investigating the relationship of CT-derived muscle metrics 
and mortality have been in oncology patients, where abdominopelvic CTs were for tumor 
diagnosis, staging, or surgical planning (6,7). In a meta-analysis of 38 studies containing 7843 
participants with non-hematologic solid tumors, Shachar et al. (7) reported that a higher CT-
derived skeletal muscle index was associated with improved overall survival (HR=0.69; 95% 
CI=0.64-0.72; p<0.001). Because cancer patients have a higher prevalence of muscle depletion 
than community-dwelling older adults (20,21), generalizing from studies of cancer patients 
warrants caution, which is why we adjusted our analyses for cancer diagnosis.

In non-oncology patients, CT muscle metrics have been shown to predict mortality in 
observational cohorts of patients with medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis, chronic liver 
disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes, trauma, intensive care unit admissions) and undergoing 
surgery (general, vascular, transplant, and orthopedic surgery) (9-15, 22-26).  In a study of 408 
trauma patients, age 65 years and older, admitted to the intensive care unit, CT-measured 
sarcopenia (total muscle at L3 level) was associated with increased one-year mortality 
(HR=10.3; 95% CI=1.3-78.8; p=0.03) (9).  Like studies of oncology patients, these studies were 
conducted in higher-risk hospitalized patients rather than using opportunistic screening of both 
outpatients and inpatients. 
 
One of the obstacles to wider use of CT for sarcopenia screening has been that the 
approach for measuring sarcopenia on CT is not standardized. While this is certainly the case, 
two approaches are dominant in the CT literature. The most common approach uses specialized 
software to threshold muscle (usually at -29 to +150 HU) and evaluates total skeletal muscle at 
the L3 level. The second most common approach uses more widely available clinical PACS 
software to measure psoas muscle only, without the use of thresholding. The second approach is 
faster, more convenient, and does not require additional cost of post-processing with specialized 
software on a separate workstation. Importantly, our study uses both of these approaches, shows 
moderate correlation between the muscle metrics derived from the two approaches, and shows 
that muscle metrics from both approaches predict mortality. 
Another inconsistency in the CT literature on sarcopenia is regarding the use of muscle 
metrics related to muscle size (CSA or index) or muscle attenuation (radiodensity). Whereas 
muscle size measured with CT is associated with lean mass measured by DXA, muscle

attenuation on CT is a measure of muscle quality (myosteotosis), not captured by DXA. 
Significantly, our study uses both of these metrics and shows that each is able to predict 
mortality. Even after adjusting for muscle attenuation, muscle size indices remain predictive of 
mortality.  
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain increased mortality in older adults with 
sarcopenia. Decreased physical activity, poor nutrition, and metabolic abnormalities all play a 
role (27,28). In older adults, a decline in muscle function corresponds to increased fatty 
infiltration of muscle (lower attenuation on CT) (27,28). In patients with cancer, excess mortality 
is associated with decrease in muscle mass (lower muscle index on CT) (29,30).  Because age-
related and cancer-induced sarcopenia may have different pathogenic mechanisms, it is 
important to determine the relationship of CT muscle metrics and mortality not just in cancer 
patients, but also in community-dwelling individuals without cancer.  
Clinical Relevance 
If future studies confirm our results and show that CT-derived muscle measurements are 
independently associated with mortality, institutions could take advantage of opportunistic 
screening to identify at risk patients. At many medical centers, teams of care managers are 
available to assist with the coordination of care. Based on opportunistic CT screening, at risk 
patients could be prioritized for care management referrals. 
Future research should examine the association CT muscle metrics with additional health 
outcomes such as hospital readmissions and explore how the incorporation of these measures 
into prediction models improve stratification of risk. Research should also examine the 
generalizability of these findings at other institutions.  Similar to CT, there may also be value of

opportunistically assessing muscle metrics on MRI exams obtained during routine patient care 
(31, 32).  
Strengths and Limitations 
Our study has several limitations. We did not collect physical function measurements or 
lean mass measurements using DXA as these are not commonly available in the electronic health 
record. This is a common limitation of all studies that use “opportunistic” CT. We did not use 
diagnostic cut-points to diagnose sarcopenia on CT and instead used muscle metrics as a 
continuous variable. This is because any diagnostic cut-point based on CT attenuation would 
need to be adjusted for specific muscle groups (different for total muscle compared to psoas 
muscle). Finally, owing to sample size considerations, we did not differentiate between causes of 
mortality. 
Our study also has several important strengths.  This is one of the largest studies using 
opportunistic CT measures of muscle in older adults.  The CT examinations were acquired using 
CT scanners from different manufacturers and using different scanner protocols, likely 
generalizable to other health care systems. The methodology appears suitable for future 
pragmatic trials.  
Conclusion 
This is the first study of CT muscle metrics that evaluated all adults over age 65 years 
who undergo a non-contrast abdominopelvic CT, rather than limiting the study group to high-risk 
cancer, surgery, or trauma patients. Our results lay the groundwork for large-scale case finding 
screening strategy for sarcopenia that does not require additional examination cost or radiation 
exposure to patients.
