Abstract
Study Design—This study is a Therapeutic Retrospective Cohort Study
Objective—This study aims to determine if sexual function is relevant for patients with SPS and 
DS and to determine the impact of operative intervention on sexual function for these patients.
Summary of Background Data—The benefits of non-operative versus operative treatment for 
patients with spinal stenosis (SPS), and degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) with regards to sexual 
function are unknown.
Methods—Demographic, treatment, and follow up data, including the Oswestry Disability Index 
(ODI), was obtained on patients enrolled in the SPORT study. Based on the response to question 
#9 in the ODI, patients were classified into a sexual life relevant (SLR) or sexual life not relevant 
(NR) group. Univariate and Multivariate analysis of patient characteristics comparing the NR and 
SLR group was performed. Operative treatment groups were compared to the non-operative group 
with regards to response to ODI question #9 to determine the impact of surgery on sexual function.
Results—1235 patients were included to determine relevance of sex life. 366 patients (29%) 
were included in the NR group. 869 patients (71%) were included in the SLR group. Patients that 
were older, female, unmarried, had 3 or more stenotic levels, and had central stenosis were more 
likely to be in the NR group. 825 patients were included in the analysis comparing operative 
versus non-operative treatment. At all follow up time points the operative groups had a lower 
percentage of patients reporting pain with their sex life compared to the non-operative group 
(p<0.05 at all time points except between >1 level fusion and non-operative at 4 years follow up).
Conclusions—Sex-life is a relevant consideration for the majority of patients with DS and SPS; 
operative treatment leads to improved sex-life related pain.

 Introduction
Sexuality is an important part of life for many individuals. Chronic back pain has been 
shown to have negative consequences on sexual function, which can contribute to a 
deterioration in quality of life.1–4 Previous studies have evaluated sexual function in patients 
with chronic pain, cardiac disease, and rheumatic conditions, and hip arthritis,2,5,6 and some 
have evaluated sexual function in patients undergoing spinal surgery.1,7–9 These studies 
show that sexual function is generally improved postoperatively when compared to 
preoperative function. However, these studies were comprised of a small sample size, lacked 
a non-operative control group and focused on intervertebral disk herniation1, total disk 
replacement7, anterior spinal surgery8, and thoracolumbar fusion to the pelvis9.
The benefits of non-operative versus operative treatment for patients with spinal stenosis 
(SPS), and degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) with regards to sexual function are unknown. 
Moreover, it is unknown whether or not sexual function is important for patients with spinal 
pathology and low back pain, including DS and SPS.
This study aims to first determine if sexual function is relevant for patients with SPS and DS 
and to identify patient characteristics associated with an increased relevance of sexual 
function. We hypothesize that marital status and age are relevant to sexual function in 
patients with DS and SPS.
The second specific aim of the study is to determine the impact of operative intervention on 
sexual function for patients with DS and SPS. We hypothesize that surgical intervention and 
pain are important predictors of sexual function in patients with DS and SPS.
Materials and Methods
The SPORT study and cohort has been previously described.10 Pre-operative demographics, 
comorbidities and clinical diagnoses, treatment including non-operative and operative 
including the number of levels fused was obtained on patients enrolled in the SPORT study. 
Post-operative and follow up information was also collected, which included a modified 
version of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
The ODI was developed by Fairbank et al11 to evaluate functional difficulties related to 
every day activities such as getting dressed, lifting, walking and running, and sleeping. 
Question number 9 of the modified ODI used in SPORT asks, “In the past week, how has 
pain affected your sex life?” The response options are 1) My sex life is unchanged; 2) My 
sex life is unchanged but causes some pain; 3) My sex life is nearly unchanged but it is very 
painful; 4) My sex life is severely restricted by pain; 5) My sex life is nearly absent because 
of pain; 6) Pain prevents any sex life at all; 7) Unable to answer or does not apply to me. 
Patients were asked to complete the ODI upon enrollment (baseline) and at 6 weeks, 3 
months, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of follow up. The response rates for all patients 
enrolled in the study for each question and response option for the ODI were tabulated. The 
response rates to question number 9, regarding sexual function were compared to the 
response rates to the other questions (1–8). Specifically, the number of times the patients left 
the answer blank or selected response option 7, “Unable to answer or does not apply to me”

 was calculated. The patients that selected this response or did not respond at all were 
grouped and classified in to the sexual life not relevant (NR) group. Specifically, relevance 
in this study is used and is synonymous with “applicability” as stated in the ODI. Patients 
that responded to question number 9 with response options 1–6 were classified into a sexual 
life relevant (SLR) group.
Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and health status measures were 
compared between the NR and SLR groups using chi-square tests for categorical variables 
and t-tests for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to explore factors 
influencing sexual life not relevant (NR) after adjusting for other variables in the model. 
Variables that were significant at p<0.10 were candidates for inclusion in the final 
multivariable model. Final selection for the model was done using the stepwise method as 
implemented in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), which sequentially enters the most 
significant variable with p<0.10 and then after each entered variable removes variables that 
do not maintain significance at p<0.05. Variables considered for entry into the model were 
listed in Table 1 except 'ethnicity' and 'listhesis level.' These were excluded because majority 
of patients are non-hispanic, and 'listhesis level' is only available for DS patients and missing 
for all SPS patients.
The three operative treatment groups (surgery without fusion, one level fusion, and two or 
more level fusion) were compared to the non-operative group with regards to response to 
ODI question #9 to determine the impact of surgery on sexual function. Non-operative 
treatment in this cohort is well described in SPORT trial10. Patients for whom sex-life was 
not relevant were excluded from this analysis. Baseline demographic characteristics, 
comorbidities, and health status measures of the four treatment groups were compared using 
chi-square tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous 
variables.
Because of the crossover between the non-operative to operative treatment arms, analysis 
was based on treatments actually received in the combined randomized and observational 
cohorts. In the as-treated analysis, the treatment indicator was a time-varying covariate, 
allowing for variable times of surgery. Times are measured from the beginning of treatment, 
i.e. the time of surgery for the surgical group and the time of enrollment for the non-
operative group. Therefore, outcome measures prior to surgery were included in the 
estimates of the non-operative treatment effect. After surgery, outcome measures were 
assigned to the surgical group (based on what type of surgery was performed) with follow-
up measured from the date of surgery.
Patients that responded with options 2–6 indicated having sex-life related pain. The 
percentage of patients who reported having sex-life related pain was compared across time 
and across treatment groups (three operative groups and a non-operative group). In detail, 
the repeated measures of pain with sex life (having sex-life related pain vs. sex-life 
unchanged), a binary outcome, were analyzed via a longitudinal model based on generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) with logit link function. The analysis was adjusted for age, 
gender, race, diagnosis, marital status, depression, baseline stenosis bothersomeness, and 
baseline pain with sex life. Outcomes between treatment groups at each time-point were

 compared using a Wald test. Across the four years of follow-up, overall comparisons of the 
“area under the curve” between groups were made by using a Wald test. Computation was 
done using SAS procedure PROC GLIMMIX. Statistical significance was defined as p < 
0.05 based on a two-sided hypothesis test with no adjustments made for multiple 
comparisons.
Results
Relevance of sex life to SPS and DS patients
1235 patients were included to determine relevance of sex life. 366 (29%) of those patients 
did not answer (n=12) or responded with response option 7, “Unable to answer or does not 
apply to me” (n=354) were included in the NR group. 869 patients selected choices 1–6 for 
the sex life question and were included in the SLR group. At baseline, 481 patients (55% of 
SLR group, 39% of all patients) reported having some level of pain associated with their sex 
life while 388 (45% of SLR group, 31% of all patients) reported having no pain with their 
sex-life.
Table 1 shows the results of univariate analysis comparing the SLR and NR groups with 
regards to baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and health status measures. 
Table 2 shows results from the multivariable model exploring factors influencing the 
response of Not-Relevant. The SLR group was younger than the NR group (63.4 vs 69.7, 
p<0.001). Patients that were older, female, unmarried, had 3 or more stenotic levels, and had 
central stenosis were more likely to be included in the NR group.
Operative vs non-operative treatment and sex life
Of the 869 patients in the SLR group, 825 had at least 1 follow-up through 4 years. Forty 
four patients were excluded as they did not have follow-up data on the sex question, leaving 
825 patients that were included in the analysis comparing operative versus non-operative 
treatment. 449 of these patients had SPS while 376 had DS. 294 patients underwent non-
operative management. 531 underwent operative management; 270, 192, and 69 patients 
received decompression alone, one level fusion, or more than one level fusion, 
respectively.10 Baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and health status 
measures according to treatments received are shown in Table 3.
Table 4 and Figure 1 show the percentage of patients in each treatment group reporting pain 
related to sex-life through 4 years of follow up. The percentage of patients experiencing pain 
with sex-life was higher for the operative treatment groups (although not statistically 
different) compared to the non-operative group at baseline. At all follow up time points the 
three operative groups had a lower percentage of patients reporting pain with their sex life 
compared to the non-operative group (p<0.05 at all time points except between 2 or more 
level fusion and non-operative at 4 years of follow up).
Discussion
This study assessed sex life function responses to patients with SPS and DS using responses 
to the ODI and if the sex life function question was applicable (relevant) to patients with

 these conditions. The findings demonstrate that at baseline, sex life was relevant to the 
majority of patients (71%) and 55% of these (39% of all patients) had at some pain affecting 
their sex life. This is similar to previously reported rates of pain affecting sex life in patients 
with low back pain.7–9 Given the high rate of patients whose sex life is affected by pain, it is 
an appropriate issue for the physician to address with their patient. Prior studies show that 
only 41% of physicians routinely question patients with lumbar disc herniation about sexual 
problems.1 One reason for this may be due to the fact that surgeons are unaware of the 
importance of sex-life for patients. The information presented here suggests that sex-life 
function is relevant to patients with spinal pathology and should be addressed. The study did 
identify a subset of patients for which sex-life was less likely to be applicable: patients who 
were older, female and unmarried and with coexisting joint problems or hypertension.
The impact of operative intervention on improvement in pain related to sexual activity was 
also assessed. At baseline, the operative groups had a higher percentage of patients with pain 
related to sexual activity compared to the non-operative control group. Figure 1 shows a 
drastic treatment effect of surgery by 3 months after surgery and improvement in pain 
related to sex. The number of patients in operative group reporting pain with sexual activity 
decreased to below 20% and remained in this range throughout 4 years of follow up. In 
contrast, approximately 40% of patients in the non-operative group reported having some 
level of pain with sexual activity throughout the follow up period. These findings are similar 
to previously published reports. Berg et al showed that sex life improved significantly with a 
decrease in low back pain after posterior lumbar fusion and total disk replacement.7 
Hamilton et al showed that 40% of older patients with thoracolumbar fusion to the pelvis 
had no or only mild sexual dysfunction.9 In contrast to previously published reports, this is 
the first study to include a large number of patients and include a non-operative control 
group.
There are a number of limitations to the study, most notably; pain with sex life was 
determined using one question from the ODI. The validity of the study would have been 
improved by using a validated survey that more comprehensively addresses sexual function 
and is able to assess differences across time. The method of assessing pain also did not 
account for different severity of pain. Nonetheless, the study does show that fewer patients 
report having pain related to sexual activity following operative management of DS and SPS 
compared to non-operative treatment. The duration of the effect may be limited by several 
factors including development of adjacent level pathology. Further studies are ongoing to 
better characterize improvements in sexual function and activity following operative 
treatment for DS and SPS. Another notable limitation is that a secondary analysis of the 
SPORT data was used and not all patients were tracked at each follow up timepoint. Finally, 
to determine whether or not sex-life is applicable or not, it was assumed that sex life was not 
applicable for those that did not respond or selected, “Unable to answer or does not apply to 
me.” This is a reasonable assumption to make, but the question does not definitively ask 
patients if they are involved in sexual activity or how important their sex life is and this 
supports the design of a prospective study to better understand spine related variables 
affecting this fundamental function of life. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that sex life 
questions are less applicable for older, female and unmarried patients and patients with 
coexisting joint problems.

 Sex-life is a relevant consideration for 70% of patients enrolled in the SPORT study with DS 
and SPS. Older, female and unmarried patients and patients with coexisting joint problems 
or hypertension were more likely to state that sex-life did not apply to them. Compared to 
the non-operative treatment group, fewer patients in the operative group reported pain 
related to their sex life. Sex-life is a relevant consideration for the majority of patients with 
DS and SPS; operative treatment leads to improved sex-life related pain.

Predictor variables:
Variables considered for entry into the model were listed in Table 1: age in years, gender, white race,
education, marital status, work status, compensation, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, hypertension,
diabetes, osteoporosis, heart problem, stomach problem, bowel or intestinal problem, depression, joint
problem, other comorbidities, time since most recent episode, SF-36 Bodily Pain score, Physical Function
score, Mental Component Summary score, Physical Component Summary score, Oswestry Disability Index,
Stenosis Bothersomeness Index, Back Pain Bothersomeness scale, Leg Pain Bothersomeness scale,
satisfication with symptoms, problem getting better or worse, treatment preference, diagnosis,
pseudoclaudication, SLR or Femoral tension, pain radiation, any neurological deficit, reflexes, sensory, motor,
stenosis levels, moderate/severe stenotic levels, central stenosis, lateral recess location, neuroforamen
stenosis, stenosis severity. But 'ethnicity' and 'listhesis level' were excluded because majority of patients are
non-hispanic, and 'listhesis level' is only available for DS patients and missing for SPS patients.
