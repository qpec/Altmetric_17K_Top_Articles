ABSTRACT
Cancer is a disease of multicellularity; it originates when cells become dysregulated due to mutations and grow out
of control, invading other tissues and provoking discomfort, disability, and eventually death. Human life expectancy
has greatly increased in the last two centuries, and consequently so has the incidence of cancer. However, how cancer
patterns in humans compare to those of other species remains largely unknown. In this review, we search for clues about
cancer and its evolutionary underpinnings across the tree of life. We discuss data from a wide range of species, drawing
comparisons with humans when adequate, and interpret our findings from an evolutionary perspective. We conclude
that certain cancers are uniquely common in humans, such as lung, prostate, and testicular cancer; while others are
common across many species. Lymphomas appear in almost every animal analysed, including in young animals, which
may be related to pathogens imposing selection on the immune system. Cancers unique to humans may be due to
our modern environment or may be evolutionary accidents: random events in the evolution of our species. Finally, we
find that cancer-resistant animals such as whales and mole-rats have evolved cellular mechanisms that help them avoid
neoplasia, and we argue that there are multiple natural routes to cancer resistance.
Key words: comparative oncology, evolution, longevity, tumour, ageing.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multicellular organisms maintain their structure and function
by tightly regulating their individual cells and intercellular
interactions. If this regulation fails, an abnormal tissue
growth – called a neoplasm – may arise. If a neoplasm
develops the ability to invade and spread to other tissues,
it becomes cancer. Cancer is a major cause of death
worldwide. It was the second most common cause of death in
2012 worldwide, totalling 14.1 million new cases (excluding
non-melanoma cancer of the skin) and 8.2 million deaths. As
cancer is an age-related disease, these numbers are expected
to increase in future years due to population growth and
aging (Stewart & Wild, 2014; American Cancer Society,
2016).
Humans are not the only species affected by cancer;
in fact, only a few primitive animals and hemichordates
are thought to escape the disease (Aktipis et al., 2015).
Furthermore, incidence rates and cancer types differ widely
among species. These observations have led scientists to
study other life forms to find clues on both causes and
therapies for this condition. Some of these studies gave rise
to animal models that help understand specific types of
cancer (Schiffman & Breen, 2015), while others have focused
on the general mechanisms of tumorigenesis and tumour
resistance (Greaves, 2007; Finch, 2010; Caulin & Maley,
2011; DeGregori, 2011; Caulin et al., 2015; Nunney & Muir,
2015). An important finding of the latter is that animals
will pass on traits that grant resistance or susceptibility
to cancer according to their impact on reproductive
success. In other words, it is expected that cancer
resistance and susceptibility is shaped by natural selection
(Aktipis et al., 2015).
Evidence for a role of natural selection in cancer resistance
began to gain strength in 1975, when Sir Richard Peto
observed that humans, despite having 1000-fold the amount
of cells and living 30 times as long as mice, had no greater
chance of developing cancer. This was unexpected and
unexplained because a higher number of cells and/or a
higher number of cell doublings should increase the chance
for mutations to occur and accumulate – it became known as
‘Peto’s paradox’. Peto suggested that mechanisms conferring

resistance to cancer could have evolved in humans along
with their increase in size (Peto et al., 1975).
Since then, many mechanisms that enable large, long-lived
animals to survive against cancer have been discovered. For
example, elephants (Loxodonta africana) have at least 20 copies
of the tumour-suppressor gene tumour protein 53 (TP53)
(Abegglen et al., 2015), and two species of bats of the genus
Myotis have additional copies of the tumour-suppressor gene
F-box protein 31 (FBX031) (Tollis, Schiffman & Boddy,
2017). The bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), estimated to
live over 200 years, has alterations in genes associated with
DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, and metabolic regulation
(Keane et al., 2015). Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are
long-lived rodents whose high-molecular-mass hyaluronan is
thought to mediate cancer resistance (Tian et al., 2013).
Such mechanisms of cancer resistance, however, are more
of an exception than a rule: the goal of every organism
is to reproduce, and any trait that increases fitness more
than resistance to cancer does may be favoured by natural
selection (Brown, Cunningham & Gatenby, 2015). Besides,
as cancer is primarily caused by accumulating mutations with
age (de Magalh˜
aes, 2013), it may be expected to affect all
organisms with dividing cells as adults that live long enough.
Evolutionary theory posits that aging and age-related
diseases occur because of the weakening of the force of natural
selection with age (Kirkwood & Austad, 2000). On one hand,
detrimental genes acting late in life, such as cancer-causing
genes, will not be weeded out by natural selection. On the
other hand, pleiotropic genes can increase fitness during
reproductive age but also susceptibility to cancer later in life;
this so-called antagonistic pleiotropy could be responsible for
the increased rate of cancer in some species, as well as for
the appearance of new types of cancer (Crespi & Summers,
2006; Haig, 2015). This concept of evolutionary trade-offs
has contributed to investigations on the ties between cancer
and aging: if some genes can increase reproductive success
in young individuals, they might undergo positive selection
even if they cause problems later in life. Strong pressure for
reproductive success, combined with weak or absent pressure
for resisting cancer in older age, could be the evolutionary
cause of the mounting rates of cancer in aged animals,
our species included (DeGregori, 2011). Moreover, there
is significant variation in cancer rates across organs, which
has been hypothesized to be linked to different evolutionary
pressures acting on different organs, including reproductive
organs (Silva et al., 2011). By gaining a more complete picture
of the different types of cancer affecting different animals this
work will allow us to explore this hypothesis further.
There
are
multiple
factors
that
influence
natural
selection, from slow-changing landscapes to ever-mutating
parasites and pathogens. Therefore, it is possible that
most multicellular organisms are constantly altering their
susceptibility to cancer (Hochberg & Noble, 2017). To
understand better how these factors influence cancer, and
perhaps how cancer arises and how it may be avoided,
it would be useful to juxtapose data among different
multicellular organisms, or among similar organisms living
under different conditions. Here, we review cancer incidence
and types across the tree of life, comparing between species
and with humans when the data allow, and suggesting
correlations when applicable.
II. CANCER ACROSS THE TREE OF LIFE
The positions of some branches of the mammalian tree
are disputed (Springer et al., 2003; Kriegs et al., 2006;
Teeling & Hedges 2013), therefore we use Tarver et al.
(2016) as a tool to organize our review (Fig. 1). We begin
by discussing primates, then continue through the other
mammalian superorders, followed by more phylogenetically
distant species, non-placental mammals, other vertebrates,
invertebrates, and finally plants. As a starting point, we
wrote a Perl script to search PubMed for >4000 species in
the AnAge database using the species’ scientific name plus
the terms ‘neoplasia’, ‘cancer’ and ‘tumour’ (de Magalh˜
aes
& Costa, 2009). A search for the total number of papers for
each species without the cancer terms was also conducted as
a control. The resulting hits served as basis for our survey of
the literature discussed below (see Tables 1 and 2).
(1) Eutherians (placental mammals)
(a) Order Primates
( i ) Humans.
Cancer rates among humans are striking,
and they are bound to keep increasing. We still do not know
all the mechanisms that lead to such a high incidence of
cancer in our species, but one hypothesis is that cultural
changes and technological advances have produced the
greatest of evolutionary mismatches – a situation where the
environment changes into something different from that
which an inhabiting species is adapted to, and that provokes
stress and may increase susceptibility to cancer, among
other problems (Hochberg & Noble, 2017). Indeed, the
only animals that have cancer rates anywhere near those
of humans are those subjected to similar life conditions, or
those whose habitat gets contaminated by sub-products of
human lifestyles. Our increasing life expectancy allows the
appearance of cancers that would not have affected our
ancestors. These types of cancer would have emerged only
in later life, or if emerging in early life they would not have
affected fitness enough to cause strong selection for resistant
individuals (de Magalh˜
aes, 2013).
The most common cancer type in humans is carcinomas
of the skin, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and basal
cell carcinoma. However, these two types of carcinoma, also
referred to as keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), are generally not
reported because they hardly ever produce metastases (von
Domarus & Stevens, 1984). Skin colour is a defence against
KC. Greaves (2014) has hypothesized that skin cancer could
have been a potent selective force for the emergence of
black skin in Homo sapiens, and that pale skin reflects an
adaptive shift that happened when humans migrated into

Europe 50000–80000 years ago. Indeed, genes associated
with skin pigmentation are known to be divergent between
Africans and Eurasians (de Magalh˜
aes & Matsuda, 2012).
On the other hand, Jablonski & Chaplin (2014) argue that
early humans had inherited the capacity for heavy tanning
from their ape ancestors, and that stronger evolutionary
pressure than skin cancer would be necessary to select for the
hairless, permanently dark skin found in some populations.
Regardless of which side is right, it makes sense for cancers
with low impact on fitness such as KC to be those with the
highest incidence.
The second most common type of cancer in humans is
that of the lung, which represented 1824701 (16.7%) of the
14.1 million new cases of non-KC reported in 2012. Lung

cancer is perhaps the one in which environmental influences
are best understood. Tobacco smoke contains more than
7000 chemical compounds, many of which are carcinogens.
Smokeless tobacco products contain 3000 chemicals, many
of which are also carcinogens (Stewart & Wild, 2014). As
with most cancers, however, there are also genetic factors
involved in this disease (Brennan, Hainaut & Boffetta, 2011).
Smoking is also a risk factor for other cancers, including
oesophageal (3.2% of non-KC cancer incidence in 2012),
and bladder cancer (3.1% of non-KC cancer incidence in
2012). However, these cancers have other risk factors of
their own, such as ingestion of alcohol and hot beverages
for oesophageal cancer and chronic infection with Schistosoma
haematobium for bladder cancer (Stewart & Wild, 2014).
Breast cancer affects mainly females, and is the third
most common cancer among humans (11.9%; see Fig. 2).
Hormonal status influences the incidence of this type of
cancer, and risk factors include total age, use of oral
contraceptives, hormone replacement, age at menarche and
menopause, age at first pregnancy and nulliparity, a previous
case of breast cancer, and family history (McPherson, Steel &
Dixon, 2000). A study found that multiparity was protective
against breast cancer (Hinkula et al., 2001), so it could
be that the low birth rate associated with the modern
lifestyle is potentiating the incidence of this disease. Diet
also plays an important role, especially the consumption of
fats and compounds with oestrogenic activity, the so-called
xenoestrogens. The impact of environmental factors is
reinforced by the low rate of inherited breast cancer and
by the high incidence in countries that adopt western diets.
Breast cancer affects males at the rate of 1% of all cases of
this disease. For unknown reasons, this ratio is higher among
black populations (Sasco, Lowenfels & Paskerdejong, 1993).
Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common worldwide
(9.7%). As cells of the colon are in direct contact with
gastrointestinal content, ingested carcinogens may influence
the development of cancer. One well-studied group of food
carcinogens are heterocyclic amines, which are produced
when heating amino acids and sugar present in meat
(Sugimura, 2000). This could explain why approximately
44% of colon cancer cases are concentrated in countries
where the diets are high in meat products (Stewart &
Wild, 2014). Dietary carcinogens such as nitrosamines are
also implicated as important causes of gastric carcinomas
(Tsugane & Sasazuki, 2007).
Prostate cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer
worldwide (7.8%), and the third most common among males
(15.0%) (Stewart & Wild, 2014). As with breast cancer,
prostate cancer is affected by hormonal and dietary factors
and its incidence increases after reproductive age. Despite
having lower incidence rates than lung cancer, breast and
prostate cancers have lower mortality and together are more
prevalent in the population.
Cancer also varies widely across different age groups. In
the USA, leukaemia accounts for 32.1% of all cancer in
children aged 1 to 14 years, followed by cancers of the brain
and other nervous system (22.6%), lymphoma (10.3%), and
soft tissue sarcomas (5.5%) (WONDER Online Database,
2016).
In adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, lymphomas are
the most common cancer types (22.6%), followed by
leukaemia (13.3%), brain and nervous system tumours
(10.3%), thyroid carcinoma (9.94%), and testicular tumours
(8.32%) (WONDER Online Database, 2016). Figure 3 shows
that as individuals enter adulthood, the proportion of brain
tumours, leukaemia, and lymphoma decrease, while that of
melanoma, testicular cancer, and thyroid cancer increase.
This age-dependent pattern of cancer incidence is
important because natural selection should act against
such fitness-damaging cancers during pre-reproductive and
reproductive ages (Leroi, Koufopanou & Burt, 2003; Nunney
& Muir, 2015). One hypothesis for the high proportion
of haematopoietic tumours in the young is that the high
mutability of some pathogens leads to an arms race between
host and parasite that exerts constant evolutionary pressure
on both sides – the host’s immune system is constantly
selected for new protective traits, and the pathogens mutate to
overcome these traits. Such traits, however, may have the side
effect of facilitating the appearance of tumours. However, an
explanation for childhood leukaemia may be more complex,
as suggested by the delayed infection hypothesis, which
considers the excessive protection of young children as a
cause for an evolutionary mismatch in their immune system,
leading to aberrant responses in the immune system that
may contribute to cancer (Greaves, 2006). An alternative
hypothesis is that cells of the haematopoietic system evolve
differently in adults and children; although selection plays a
large role in the evolution of these cells in the former, genetic
drift is more important in the latter. There is a possibility that
other common childhood cancers appear due to genetic drift,
and more research in this area would be beneficial (Rozhok,
Salstrom & DeGregori, 2016). As for tumours of the nervous
system, one cause could be attributed to the recent evolution

of larger brains in our species; strong selection on a highly
adaptive trait like brain size could bring along costs, such as
increased cancer risk (Leroi et al., 2003).
The proportion of testicular cancer reaches its peak
between 30 and 40 years of age, after which it decreases.
This high incidence of testicular cancer (Fig. 3) in young
men still lacks an explanation, although it could also be
related to how selection on one trait can lead to associated
costs in terms of increased cancer risk. Indeed, human
reproductive organs tend to have a higher mass-normalized
cancer incidence (Silva et al., 2011). In the case of testicular
cancer, one possible cause could be the elevated activity of
reproductive tissue during puberty and early adulthood (de
Magalh˜
aes, 2013). Genetics may also be involved: studies
show positive selection for several genes implicated in both
male reproductive fitness and cancer (Crespi & Summers,
2006). Another possible explanation could be that testicular
cancer is highly influenced by environmental factors: in
most developing countries, the age-standardized rates are
below 3 per 100000, while in most developed countries

it is above that number. In the USA, the rates are 5 per
100000; in the UK, 6.8; and Norway, where they are
highest, 12.2. There also seems to be a correlation between
western/eastern cultures and testicular cancer. In Japan,
the age-standardized rates are 2.1; in China, they are 0.3
(Ferlay et al., 2013).
Some hypotheses for the disparity in incidence among
countries point out that in developed regions there has been
an increase in predisposing factors such as cryptorchidism
(undescended testes), hypospadias (a misdeveloped urethra
that opens at the base of the penis), and infertility (Bray
et al., 2006; Cancer Research UK, 2016). The reason behind
increases in these factors, however, remains a mystery. One
well-known possibility is that excessive exposure to oestrogen
during the foetal stage could increase the risk for such
abnormalities (Skakkeb´
ek et al., 1998). The data are still
inconclusive, and more studies are necessary to understand
better the aetiology of testicular cancer.
Other cancers beside testicular vary in incidence among
countries. In regions of high Human Development Index
(HDI), there is a higher incidence of breast, prostate, lung,
and colorectal cancer, while in regions of low HDI there is
a higher incidence of infection-related cancers, such as those
of the liver and of the uterine cervix. Examining differences
in cancer among humans living under different social status
may provide important clues about the aetiology of different
types of the disease (Stewart & Wild, 2014).
( ii ) Non-human primates.
Puente et al. (2006) showed that
every human cancer gene has an orthologue in non-human
primates, and genomic analyses in these animals have
improved our understanding of the evolution of some
tumour-suppressor genes. Studies in monkeys have also
helped advance our understanding of chemical carcinogens,
including the tumour-inducing effect of some anti-neoplastic
agents and that of exogenous oestrogens (Xia & Chen, 2011).
Scientists previously thought that non-human primates
rarely developed cancer, but recent studies suggest that
tumours might occur frequently in this group (Lapin &
Yakovleva, 2014). Brown et al. (2009) found 102 naturally
occurring and 12 experimentally induced neoplasms among
chimpanzees (Pan spp.). The most common of these were
uterine leiomyomas, followed by hepatocellular carcinomas
and ovarian stromal tumours.
Based on our literature search (Fig. 4), we found cancer
cases across 29 non-human primate species; we observed
that the most common type of cancer in non-human
primates of both sexes was bowel cancers, followed by
lymphomas and soft tissue sarcomas in males and by
lymphomas, breast, ovary, and uterus cancer in females.
Among the species studied, cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus
oedipus) were one of the most prone to developing colorectal
carcinomas. Liu & Russell (2008) hypothesized that this
could be due to unbalanced nutrition, intake of refined food,
and the susceptibility of these animals to stress. Crab-eating
macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca
mulatta) were also among the groups with high incidence of
bowel cancer (Valverde et al., 2000).

female non-human primates. Created using our own data
derived from a survey of the literature.
Lymphomas were the second most common type of cancer
among the 29 species studied. Although the reported cases
comprised spontaneous tumours, lymphomas in non-human
primates usually have viral aetiology (Holmberg et al., 1985;
Hofmann et al., 2001; Cianciolo et al., 2007; Tardif et al.,
2011; Gibson-Corley & Haynes, 2012).
A review by Lowenstine et al. (2016) also shows a
high incidence of lymphomas among non-human primates,
which as we have discussed is common in young humans,
particularly in those in the age range of 1 to 19 years. This
adds to the suggestion that cancers of the immune system are
common among multicellular organisms in both controlled
environments and the wild.
Breast carcinoma, despite representing a large percentage
of the cancer types in non-human primates, occurs more
rarely in this group than in human females. However, some
of the groups underwent interventions that could have been
protective against breast cancer: release from captivity before
postmenopausal age, multiparity and ovary removal, and
feeding with a balanced diet rich in soy protein (Wood et al.,
2006).
The high incidence of bowel cancers and cancers
of the female reproductive tract in captive non-human
primates also suggests that certain habits influence their
occurrence. The already-mentioned high intake of refined
food and unbalanced diets could be analogous to the
dietary changes in humans, and their susceptibility to stress
could be related to our own changes in behaviour due to
societal pressure.
It is important to note that some cancers that are common
in humans are rare in non-human primates. We are only
aware of one case of lung cancer (Cho et al., 2007), possibly
due to the absence of carcinogenic tobacco smoke. Testicular
and prostate cancer seem to be rare as well: we found only
a few reports of seminomas and one report of a Leydig
cell tumour (McClure, 1973; Brack, 1988; Gozalo, Nolan

& Montoya, 1992). These types of cancer are among the
most common in human males (testicular cancer in younger
males and prostate cancer in older males). As previously
mentioned, the higher rates for testicular cancer in humans
are still under investigation. Prostate cancer, on the other
hand, is known to be influenced by aging: humans have also
evolved a much longer lifespan than non-human primates,
which possibly increases their chances for developing the
disease (Finch, 2010).
Finally, our data show that the age of onset of cancer
in non-human primates is ∼3 years old or more, which
corresponds to the beginning of adulthood; moreover,
Lowenstine et al. (2016) found that cancer mortality in
chimpanzees increases from ages under 35 years old (8.3%)
to ages above 35 years old (9.0%). These findings suggest a
correlation between lifespan and the onset of cancer.
(b) Order Lagomorpha
( i ) Rabbits.
The most common tumours in European
rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are uterine adenocarcinomas
followed by lymphosarcomas (Percy et al., 2016). The
incidence of lymphomas varies across continents. They
are rare in North American pet rabbits, but common in
European pet rabbits (Ritter et al., 2012). Researchers found
no indication of a viral aetiology (Ritter et al., 2012).
Mammary cancers are rarely reported in laboratory
and pet rabbits. A retrospective study encompassing all
mammary tumours and tumour-like lesions diagnosed in pet
rabbits between July 2004 and September 2011 found that
the most common tumours of the mammary gland were
adenocarcinoma and invasive carcinoma (Sch¨
oniger, Horn
& Schoon, 2014).
von Bomhard et al. (2007) conducted a retrospective
study to examine cutaneous neoplasms from 179 pet
rabbits. The authors divided tumours into virus-induced
and non-virus-induced. The most common virus-induced
tumours were Shope fibromas, which affected 19/179
rabbits, and the most common non-virus-induced tumours
were trichoblastomas, which affected 58/179 rabbits. They
also investigated mesenchymal tumours, of which the most
common were lipomas, myxosarcomas, and fibrosarcomas.
Among the 179 rabbits, there were also eight cases of
malignant melanoma.
(c) Order Rodentia (model organisms)
Studies with model rodents have contributed greatly to the
understanding of cancer in humans. For example, tumour
transplantation experiments have shown that growth of latent
tumours declines with age, but their survivability increases,
which is compatible with current data on humans; exogenous
oestrogen administration is carcinogenic in both humans and
mice, and the difference in cancer incidence between mice of
different sexes corresponds to that in humans, a phenomenon
that deserves further investigation (Anisimov, Ukraintseva &
Yashin, 2005). On the other hand, some characteristics are
unique to rodent tumours: it is common for spontaneous
tumours to regress in rodents, but not in humans, and
many human carcinogens are not carcinogenic in rodents
(Anisimov et al., 2005). Although data from rodents cannot
always be extrapolated to humans, they remain an important
cancer model.
( i ) Rats.
The literature reports a tumour incidence of
up to 87% in rats. The incidence and types of tumour vary
depending on many factors, such as the strain of the rat, age,
sex, diet, caloric intake and environment (Greenacre, 2004).
There is controversy regarding the most common tumours
in this species. Some studies suggest they are those of the
mammary gland (Greenacre, 2004), but others have found
that the most common were pituitary adenoma and adrenal
pheochromocytoma when considering both sexes, testicular
interstitial cell tumours when considering only males, and
mammary gland tumours, thyroid C-cell adenomas, and
uterine stromal polyps when considering only females
(Nakazawa et al., 2001). Other common types of tumour
in rats include mononuclear cell leukaemias, malignant
lymphomas (Greenacre, 2004), spinal cord tumours and
renal tumours (Harkness & Wagner, 2010).
( ii ) Mice.
Tumourigenesis has been extensively studied
in mice; there are strains of mice developed with specific sus-
ceptibilities and resistances to certain tumours (Greenacre,
2004). Similar to rats, there is controversy as to the most
commonly occurring tumour types, and cancer susceptibility
appears to be strain-dependent (Sibilia & Wagner, 1995;
Woodworth et al., 2004). Some sources suggest that pul-
monary tumours are among the most common, while others
suggest that mammary adenocarcinoma is the most common
tumour, at least in aged female mice, contributing from 30
to 70% of total cancer burden (Collins, 1988). Two other
sources show haematopoietic tumours as the most common
in these animals (Ward, 1983; Frith, Ward & Chandra,
1993). Also common are hepatocellular carcinomas, lym-
phocytic leukaemias (Greenacre, 2004), testicular interstitial
cell tumours and ovarian tumours (Harkness & Wagner,
2010). Interestingly, even long-lived wild-derived mice die
primarily of cancer (Harper, Leathers & Austad, 2006).
( iii ) Mole-rats.
The naked mole-rat is a long-lived
rodent native to East Africa. It exhibits extraordinary
resistance to cancer and has been studied in order to
understand how such resistance is generated. It can live up
to 30 years, whereas the longevity of similarly sized mice is
2–3 years (Austad, 2010). Scientists have investigated these
animals and identified key genomic variations that may
have contributed to the evolution of longevity and resistance
to cancer (Keane et al., 2014; Davies et al., 2015). Despite
these findings, Delaney et al. (2016) found tumours in two
zoo-housed naked mole-rats. Taylor, Milone & Rodriguez
(2016) followed with a report on four cases of spontaneous
neoplasia in naked mole-rats pertaining to the exhibit
collection at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. The examined
population descended from a single pair, which could have
facilitated tumour-driving mutations. On the other hand,
naked mole-rats inbreed even in the wild, suggesting that the
increased cancer rate in this study might have other causes.

Thales A. F. Albuquerque and others
Another issue is that with a lifespan of over 30 years, old
naked mole-rats are relatively rare in captivity, and therefore
we may observe more cancer cases as older animals are
examined.
Researchers
have
found
that
high-molecular-mass
hyaluronan is involved in the arresting of cell growth once
cells come into contact with extracellular matrix (Seluanov
et al., 2009) and also the activation of a modified version of the
inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (INK4a) locus, which
contains tumour-suppressor genes (Tian et al., 2015). Faulkes
et al. (2015) found that high-molecular-mass hyaluronan is
generated from two different mutations in the hyaluronan
synthase 2 gene (HAS2), one of which is shared among all
African mole-rats.
A second group of mole-rats has shown remarkable
cancer resistance. The mole-rats of the genus Spalax, also
known as blind mole-rats, can avoid not only spontaneous
tumours, but induced tumours as well (Manov et al., 2013).
They, too, produce high-molecular-mass hyaluronan, but
they have neither of the two mutations in the HAS2
gene previously identified as key for the production of
the modified molecule, which means they may have other
mechanisms of producing this molecule (Faulkes et al., 2015).
Additionally, blind mole-rats resist cancer by at least one
other mechanism: the release of interferon-β (IFN-β) in
the face of excessive proliferation, which then activates
tumour-suppressor pathways (Gorbunova et al., 2012).
As with elephants, the reproductive fitness of naked
mole-rats increases with age, which adds strength to the
hypothesis that this could contribute to the selection of
cancer-resistance traits (Brown & Aktipis, 2015).
(d) Order Rodentia (non-model organsims)
( i ) Hamsters.
Cancer has been reported in at least
three different types of hamsters: Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus),
Chinese (Cricetulus griseus), and Russian hamsters (Phodopus
sungorus). Syrian hamsters have a tumour incidence of
3.7%, and high susceptibility to induction of a wide variety
of tumours with carcinogenic agents, which makes them
ideal for carcinogenic studies (Greenacre, 2004). Age is an
important factor in cancer incidence in hamsters; reports
show an incidence of up to 50% in hamsters greater than
2 years of age (Kikman & Algard, 1968; Strandberg, 1987).
There is debate as to what is the most common type
of tumour in hamsters. While older studies suggest it to
be lymphoma, newer research shows that adrenal cortical
tumours are the most common. This controversy may be due
to fewer hamsters being currently exposed to a virus known
to cause lymphoma. Other common tumours in hamsters are
those of the skin and subcutis and those of the gastrointestinal
system (Harkness & Wagner, 2010).
( ii ) Guinea pigs.
Tumours are uncommon in guinea pigs
(Cavia porcellus), and their incidence varies among strains.
There is evidence correlating cancer incidence with aging,
and neoplasia in animals aged >3 years old has been reported
to be up to 30% (Greenacre, 2004). Bronchogenic papillary
adenoma is the most commonly reported tumour, ranging
from 30 to 35% of all neoplasms in guinea pigs more than
3 years old (Kitchen et al., 1975; Collins, 1988; Cooper, 1994;
Harkness & Wagner, 2010). The next most common are
tumours of the skin and subcutis (Greenacre, 2004), which
comprise approximately 15% of all neoplasms in guinea pigs
(Harkness & Wagner, 2010).
( iii ) Mongolian gerbils.
Tumour incidence in gerbils
(Meriones unguiculatus) varies from 8.4 to 26.5% (Benitz
& Kramer, 1965; Vincent, Rodrick & Sodeman, 1979;
Harkness & Wagner, 2010), the most common type being
those of the female reproductive tract, specifically of the
ovary (Collins, 1988; Harkness & Wagner, 2010), which was
found to occur in 12.5% of female gerbils (Benitz & Kramer,
1965). The second most common type is that of the skin
and subcutis, mainly of the ventral abdominal scent gland
(Greenacre, 2004).
There are also reports of lymphoreticular tumours
in
gerbils,
including
Hodgkin’s-like
lymphoma
and
lymphoblastic lymphoma (Rembert et al., 2000). Surprisingly,
we found no reports of mammary tumours in gerbils.
( iv ) Black-tailed prairie dogs and chinchillas.
There are few
publications regarding tumours in prairie dogs (Cynomys
ludovicianus) and chinchillas (Chinchilla lanigera). A report
on two prairie dogs shows hepatocellular carcinomas with
metastasis to the lung (Une et al., 1996); the researchers found
no traces of a viral infection (Phalen, Antinoff & Fricke, 2000).
In chinchillas, one report revealed a case of uterine
leiomyosarcoma in a 1-year-old female (Mans & Donnelly,
2012). There have also been reports of malignant lymphoma,
lymphosarcoma, gastric adenocarcinoma (Lucena et al.,
2012), and adenocarcinoma of the lung (Greenacre, 2004).
(e) Order Cetacea
( i ) Beluga whales.
A number of studies have focused
on
Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) from
the St.
Lawrence estuary. Data over 17 years from this group
showed an estimated annual cancer rate of 163/100000,
of which 63/100000 were of intestinal origin (Martineau
et al., 2002).
The contaminants in the St. Lawrence River estuary
are thought to increase carcinogenesis in beluga whales
living there compared with animals living elsewhere. A study
analysed 50 carcasses of Arctic beluga whales and found no
occurrence of neoplasia (De Guise, Lagac´
e & B´
eland, 1994),
but since the cancer rates in the estuary were approximately
1/600, there is not enough evidence to conclude whether the
contaminants are the culprit.
Epithelial neoplasms are common in beluga species,
(Mikaelian et al., 1999; Newman & Smith, 2006). Many
of its subtypes may be associated with chemical carcinogens
present in the estuary (De Guise et al., 1994).
( ii ) Bowhead whales.
The bowhead whale has been
estimated to live over 200 years, and there are no reported
cases of cancer in this species. Given their large size, their
cells must have a lower chance of developing into cancer
when compared to human cells, possibly due to protective
molecular mechanisms (de Magalh˜
aes, 2015; Keane et al.,
Biological Reviews 93 (2018) 1715–1734 © 2018 The Authors. Biological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Cambridge Philosophical Society.
 Cancer across the tree of life
1725
2015). Cancer in large whale species could go undetected,
however, because stranded animals are rare and we know
very little about their natural causes of death. Bowhead
whales are also harvested by native peoples, but it is typically
the young adults who are taken.
( iii ) Dolphins and porpoises.
There are more reports of
neoplasia in dolphins than in other marine mammals,
especially epithelial tumours, followed by those of the
lymphatic system, tongue, lung, and kidney (Newman &
Smith, 2006). Among the reports we found, testicular
tumours and T-cell lymphoma are noteworthy for also being
common in young humans (Mawdesley-Thomas, 1975;
Migaki, Woodard & Goldston, 1978; Newman & Smith,
2006; Arbelo et al., 2014). There are rare reports of neoplasia
among porpoises, one of which includes a renal teratoma
(Baker & Martin, 1992).
( iv ) Other cetaceans.
There are few reports of neoplasia
among other cetaceans. One study examined 55 pilot
whales
(Globicephala
melaena)
from
Newfoundland
and
encountered concomitant uterine leiomyoma and vaginal
fibroleiomyoma in a single animal (Cowan, 1966). Another
study examined 2000 whales from a South African whaling
expedition and found benign tumours in a sperm whale
(Physeter macrocephalus) and in a sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis)
(Newman & Smith, 2006).
(f ) Order Artiodactyla
( i ) Cows, pigs and sheep.
Reports on these animals are
rare, especially for those living in the wild. Thus, animals
kept as livestock are particularly valuable in furthering our
understanding of cancer patterns in Artiodactyla.
A histological survey collected specimens in 100 UK
abattoirs and found 302 tumours in 1.3 million cattle, 107
in 4.5 million sheep, and 139 in 3.7 million pigs (Anderson
& Sandison, 1969). The objective was to examine tumours
of the endocrine glands, with exception of the ovary and
brain. The most common tumours found were those of the
adrenal cortex. Other tumours included adrenal carcinomas,
pheochromocytomas, thyroid carcinomas, and one islet-cell
carcinoma (in a pig). The authors found no aetiology for
these cancers, with exception of thyroid carcinomas, which
had goitre as a risk factor. As in humans, goitre was related to
a deficiency of iodine. The authors suggested that the tumour
profile might have been skewed due to the early killing of
these animals in the abattoirs (Anderson & Sandison, 1969).
A retrospective study of pancreatic tumours in cattle
identified 16 primary tumours, 11 of which were islet cell
tumours. As in humans, these tumours produced the same
hormones as normal tissue. Unlike humans, they presented
with either endocrine or exocrine cells (whereas in humans
a single tumour presents with both types of cells). Amyloid is
present in pancreatic tumours of many species, but it was not
present in tumours collected in this study (Kelley, Harmon
& McCaskey, 1996).
A second retrospective study comprised all cases received
by the veterinary department of Universidade Federal de
Pelotas, Brazil. The researchers analysed 6267 specimens
and found 175 tumours, distributed in the following manner:
98/4407 in bovines (2.22% incidence), 9/636 in ovines
(1.41% incidence), 65/774 in equines (8.39% incidence),
and 3/450 in swine (0.6% incidence). The authors suggested
that the lower incidence in swine and ovines compared to
bovines and equines could be due to swine and ovines being
put down at younger ages (Ramos et al., 2008).
The most common tumours in bovines were lymphosar-
comas, followed by squamous cell carcinomas and fibromas.
Lymphomas in bovines are correlated with bovine leukaemia
virus and with herd size. The authors suggested this last fac-
tor could imply a genetic influence in the development
of this type of cancer (Ramos et al., 2008). In ovines, the
most common tumours were squamous cell carcinomas.
Two of the three tumours identified in swines were of the
digestive tract – one gastric adenoma and one oral cavity
fibroma – and the other was a melanoma (Ramos et al.,
2008).
(g) Order Perissodactyla
( i ) Horses.
Ramos et al. (2008) found that the most
common tumours in equines were equine sarcoids, followed
by squamous cell carcinomas. Only seven of the 65
equine tumours were of haematopoietic origin, but research
has suggested immunohistochemical similarities between
T-cell-rich, large B-cell lymphomas of equines and humans.
Studies have also found viral RNA in these tumours, although
they were unable to identify these viruses as the cause (Kelley
& Mahaffey, 1998).
(h) Order Carnivora
( i ) Dogs.
In the USA, over 4.2 million dogs (∼5300 in
100000) develop cancer every year, compared to 1.66 million
humans (∼500 in 100000) (Schiffman & Breen, 2015),
although of course the higher risk of cancer for dogs per
year is expected given their shorter lifespan (5–10 years).
Dogs are one of the most explored non-rodent models in
comparative oncology for a number of reasons. For example,
their sporadic tumours resemble those of humans. Dogs are
kept in protective household environments and over 40
billion dollars is spent annually on dog health care, a level
that is second only to humans (Rowell, Mccarthy & Alvarez,
2012). Finally, inbreeding practices that aim to select certain
traits have reduced their genetic variability and increased
susceptibility to different types of cancer across different
races, which facilitates the isolation of genes involved in
cancer and subsequent comparisons with humans (Rowell
et al., 2012; Schiffman & Breen, 2015).
Findings from the Animal Tumor Registry of Genoa,
Italy, show that cancer incidence is proportional to age in
dogs, with 28% of the tumours occurring in those older
than 11 years old and 3.9% occurring in those younger than
3 years old (Merlo et al., 2008). The most common types of
malignant cancers developed in dogs are lymphoma, mast
cell tumour, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, mammary
carcinoma (Dobson et al., 2002; Bronden et al., 2010), oral

melanoma and haemangiosarcoma (Maekawa et al., 2016).
Dogs are also the only known species, apart from humans, to
significantly develop spontaneous prostate cancer (Greaves,
2007).
A number of cancers have a low incidence in humans,
and a higher incidence in dogs (Schiffman & Breen, 2015).
For example, soft-tissue sarcomas form approximately 1%
of new cases of cancer in humans. However, such cancers
occur approximately 75 times more frequently in dogs,
with some breeds being more susceptible than others
(Rowell et al., 2012). Comparisons between canine and
human osteosarcoma have allowed advancements such as
identification of several subtypes (Scott et al., 2011), driver
mutations (Angstadt et al., 2012), and biomarkers (Rankin
et al., 2012; Ren & Khanna, 2014), and have led to new
therapeutic investigations (Rankin et al., 2012; Yin et al.,
2016).
Lymphomas and leukaemias are common in both humans
and dogs. In 2014, there were 250000 estimated cases of
canine lymphoma compared to 71000 human diagnosed
cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (which is comparable to
canine lymphoma). Lymphomas in dogs are similar to those
in humans in molecular aspects and in their response to
therapy; canine studies have been and will continue to be
important in the comprehension of this disease (Richards &
Suter, 2015). Genomic studies of canine leukaemias are still
underway, but recent results show similarities between canine
and human leukaemias. Glioblastomas and melanomas also
show genomic similarities (Schiffman & Breen, 2015).
Urothelial carcinomas are also common in both humans
and dogs. However, their occurrence in humans seems to be
more due to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke,
while in dogs they seem to occur due to genetic predisposition
(Schiffman & Breen, 2015).
In female dogs, mammary gland tumours represent
70% of all cancer cases (Merlo et al., 2008). Mammary
adenocarcinoma is a common subtype and dogs with
these tumours often suffer recurrences or metastases if
treated by surgery alone (Merlo et al., 2008). Hormones
involved in human mammary carcinogenesis, such as
oestrogen, progesterone, prolactin, growth hormone (GH)
and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been
associated with canine mammary carcinogenesis (Queiroga
et al., 2011). Histological patterns of breast cancer are similar
among humans and canines, but cytological patterns differ
(de las Mulas & Reymundo, 2000).
Finally, it is worth noting that there are many genetic
similarities between canine and human cancer: scientists
found several overlapping loci between dogs and humans
with osteosarcoma (Rowell et al., 2012; Shearin et al., 2012),
and tumour markers for many cancers are similar in both
species (Queiroga et al., 2011; Pinho et al., 2012).
As with all animals, there are limitations to the usefulness
of canines as a comparative cancer model (Mayeux, 2004;
Farrell et al., 2015). It is also important to consider that our
data from dogs come from domestic animals or animals
kept in captivity. Nevertheless, the findings from the present
section indicate that studies in dogs are likely to help us
understand the pathogenesis of cancer in humans.
( ii ) Polar bears.
There are reports of two polar
bears (Ursus maritimus) developing hepatic neoplasia: one
hepatocellular carcinoma and one cholangiocarcinoma. The
exact aetiology is unknown, but it is thought to involve
exposure to industrial chemicals, clonorchid flukes, and
viral agents (Newman & Smith, 2006). Another hypothesis
suggests that transition from intermittent feeding in the wild
to continual feeding in the zoo environment could have a
role in the process (Newman & Smith, 2006).
A 25-year-old polar bear presented with pancreatic
islet-cell tumour (Alroy, Baldwin Jr & Maschgan, 1980), and
here also the authors suspected there could be an influence
of dietary factors. In this case, it was suggested that high-
carbohydrate diets could have been the predisposing factor.
A 7-year-old polar bear was reported to have developed
osteosarcoma (Ponomar’kov & Khutorianski˘
ı, 1995).
( iii ) Sea lions.
Brown et al. (1980) reported metastatic
adenocarcinoma in a female and in a male California sea lion
(Zalophus californianus). These authors suspected the tumours
to have originated in the urogenital tract. Another study
reported widespread metastases of a poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma in a California sea lion (Joseph,
Cornell & Migaki, 1986). Gulland et al. (1996) examined 370
California sea lions and found 66 of them (18%) had similar
metastases, which they suspected to have originated from
transitional-cell carcinoma.
In another study, researchers found an association between
urogenital carcinoma and otarine herpesvirus-1 – this virus
is closely related to human herpesvirus 8, which is implicated
in Kaposi’s sarcoma in humans (Lipscomb et al., 2000).
There have also been reports on several types of malignant
epithelial carcinomas, but it appears that, like some of the
cases previously discussed, most may have originated from
genital-tract metastases (Newman & Smith, 2006).
A single California sea lion was diagnosed with both
a simple mammary carcinoma and a complex mammary
carcinoma (Matsuda et al., 2003). Complex mammary
carcinomas develop in other species such as dogs, but not in
humans.
( iv ) Seals.
The most reported neoplasms in seals were
those of the genital tract (Newman & Smith, 2006). A study
reported 64% incidence of uterine leiomyomas in aged Baltic
gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) (B¨
acklin et al., 2003). The authors
suggested that organochlorines with hormone-like properties
could have overstimulated smooth-muscle proliferation,
since seals’ tissues had high levels of dichlorophenyl
trichloroethane
(DDT)
and
polychlorinated
biphenyls
(PCBs).
Other types of cancer, such ovarian granulosa cell tumour
and lymphosarcoma, have also been reported (Newman &
Smith, 2006). Additionally, two harbor seals (Phoca vitulina
geronimensis) living in close proximity to one another presented
with leukaemia of suspected viral aetiology (Griner, 1971).
( v ) Walrus.
We found reports on Atlantic walrus
(Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) and Pacific walrus (Odobenus

rosmarus divergens). The only neoplasms reported in the Atlantic
walrus were an osteosarcoma and a myelogenous leukaemia
(Newman & Smith, 2006). An examination of 107 carcasses of
Pacific walruses found 18 neoplasms, including leiomyomas,
gastrointestinal tumours and hepatic tumours (Fleetwood,
Lipscomb & Garlich-Miller, 2005).
( vi ) Sea otters.
Neoplasia incidence in northern sea
otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) has been estimated at 1–1.8%
(Stetzer, Williams & Nightingale, 1981). There are a few
reports on this species, among which are leiomyomas,
lymphomas, seminomas and soft tissue sarcomas (Stetzer
et al., 1981; Reimer & Lipscomb, 1998; Kim et al., 2002;
Burek-Huntington et al., 2012).
In 2013, a study reported the first case of T-cell lymphoma
in sea otters. When affecting humans, this type of cancer is
caused by a virus and usually occurs in immunosuppressed
individuals. In the sea otter, however, no virus was found,
and the pathogenesis remains to be clarified (Tanaka et al.,
2013).
( vii ) Cats.
A study conducted by Dorn et al. (1968) with
reports from Alameda County, California, USA, estimated
that 155.8 in 100000 cats developed cancer annually,
compared to 381.2 in 100000 dogs. The reasons for the
differences in cancer incidence between dogs and cats
are unknown. Nevertheless, it seems that neoplasia could
be as common in cats as it is in humans. The most
common tumours in cats are lymphomas, most of which
are caused by the feline leukaemia virus, which promotes
the development of cancer by different means than that of
human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (Vail & MacEwen,
2000; Matsuoka, 2003).
Zambelli (2015) investigated the prevalence of feline can-
cer in South Africa and found 100 cases in a sample of 12893
cats. The most common cancer in this population was squa-
mous cell carcinoma (48 of 100), which was three times higher
in white/part-white cats than in non-white cats. This could
be analogous to the higher susceptibility of light-skinned
humans to skin cancer. Curiously, melanomas, which are
common in humans and dogs, are rare in cats (Cekanova &
Rathore, 2014). Bladder cancer and osteosarcoma are two
other tumours that are common both in humans and dogs,
but rare in cats (Cekanova & Rathore, 2014).
The third most common type of tumour in cats is
mammary cancers. Their architectural patterns are similar
to those of humans, and the tumours are usually of the simple
glandular type, which makes them histologically more similar
to human mammary carcinomas than are dog carcinomas
(Mulas & Reymundo, 2000). On the other hand, cat tumours
are less hormone dependent than those of humans and dogs
(Vail & MacEwen, 2000).
(i) Order Chiroptera
( i ) Bats.
Bats are the mammals with the highest lifespan
to body mass ratio (Bourliere, 1958; Austad & Fischer, 1991),
which Wilkinson & South (2002) suggested could be related
to the decreased caloric intake of these animals during
hibernation.
The longevity record among bats (41 years in a male) is
held by the Brandt’s bat (Myositis brandtii) (Podlutsky et al.,
2005). Researchers have discovered mutations in the growth
hormone receptor (GHR) and in the insulin-like growth factor
1 receptor genes (IGF1R) in these bats, both of which may
contribute to their longevity (Seim et al., 2013). GH and IGF1
both play roles in cell growth and proliferation, and these
mutations could also affect the rate of cancer in these species.
Additionally, Seim et al. (2013) found that the Brandt’s bat,
as well as another bat of the Myositis genus (Myositis lucifugus)
have additional copies of the gene FBX031, which codes for a
tumour-suppressor protein. There are few reports of cancer
in bats (Beck, Beck & Howard, 1982; Olds et al., 2015), and
none in the Brandt’s bat.
(j) Order Eulipotyphla
( i ) African pygmy hedgehogs.
A study with 14 captive
African hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris) reported a cancer
incidence of 30% (Raymond, White & Janovitz, 1997);
another study with 66 hedgehogs reported an incidence of
53% with 85% of tumours classified as malignant (Raymond
& Garner, 2001). Furthermore, about 10% of the hedgehogs
had multiple types of tumours (Greenacre, 2004).
The mean age of individuals who developed the disease
was 3.5 years (their maximum lifespan in captivity is
approximately 11.4 years) (Greenacre, 2004; Tacutu et al.,
2013). In these studies, gender had no impact on cancer
incidence. The most common tumours were malignant
mammary adenocarcinoma, followed by lymphosarcoma
and oral squamous cell carcinoma (Greenacre, 2004).
(k) Order Proboscidea
( i ) Elephants.
Like bowhead whales, elephants are
large, long-living animals that seem to resist the development
of cancer. The cancer mortality among captive elephants
(4.8%) is lower than that of humans (11–25%) (Abegglen
et al., 2015). This increased resistance could involve changes
in tumour-suppressor capacity. Abegglen et al. (2015) showed
that elephants have 40 TP53 alleles (humans have only two),
leading to enhanced TP53-mediated apoptosis. This gene
is associated with the evolution of increased body size and
enhanced response to DNA damage in elephants (Sulak
et al., 2016).
Elephants are one of the few animals whose reproductive
fitness increases with age, which may have selected for
their effective cancer-suppression mechanisms (Poole, 1989;
Abegglen et al., 2015).
(l) Order Sirenia
( i ) Manatees.
Reports
of
neoplasia
in
manatees
(Trichechus manatus latirostris) show cutaneous papillomas
affecting various regions (Bossart et al., 2002). Electron
microscopy revealed papillomavirus particles within these
tumours.

(2) Marsupials and monotremes (non-placental
mammals)
The non-placental mammals are the monotremes and the
marsupials; we found reports on cancer in marsupials, but
not in monotremes. Canfield, Hartley & Reddacliff (1990)
catalogued all spontaneous proliferations in dasyurids (order
Dasyuromorphia) and bandicoots (order Peramelemorphia)
held by the Comparative Pathology Registry at Taronga
Zoo. There were 70 proliferations among dasyurids and
three among bandicoots. Among the common tumours in
dasyurids were those of the adrenals, liver, and lymphatic
system.
Isolated reports in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) show
one case of hemangiosarcoma (Rivas, Pye & Papendick,
2014), one case of concurrent adrenocortical carcinoma and
hepatocellular carcinoma (Lindemann et al., 2016), and two
cases of metastatic mammary carcinoma (Keller et al., 2014;
Churgin et al., 2015).
(3) Other vertebrates
The phylogenetic proximity of other mammals to humans
makes them the most suitable models for comparison and
thus the main focus of our review. Non-mammalian species,
however, are also susceptible to cancer and may provide
important data. Furthermore, investigating neoplasia in
more phylogenetically distant species may reveal clues on
the more primitive mechanisms of tumour suppression and
maintenance of multicellularity. See Table 2 for a summary
of cancer types in these animals.
(a) Birds
A review comprising data from multiple studies found that
neoplasia has been reported more frequently in captive
than in free-flying wild birds, and more frequently in pet
birds than in wild birds (Filippich, 2004). Researchers
suggested the higher incidence in pet birds could be due
to ease of observation, extended lifespan, higher exposure to
carcinogens, and inbreeding (Castro et al., 2016). Dietary
changes and improvements in cancer treatment have
extended the lifespan of pet birds, along with the incidence
of neoplasia observed by veterinarians.
A literary survey of 1539 cases of neoplasia in pet birds
found that the most common tumours were of the integu-
ment (31.7%), the urinary system (25.1%), and the genital
system (17.3%) (Filippich, 2004). In Amazon parrots (Amazona
spp.), however, the most common tumours are lipomas, lym-
phosarcomas, and fibrosarcomas (Levine & Practice, 2003).
(b) Reptilians
A retrospective study in reptiles held at the Philadelphia
Zoological Garden examined 3684 necropsy reports from
1901–2002 and found 86 cases of neoplasia, six of which
occurred in six chelonians (1.2% incidence), 22 in 19 lizards
(3.0% incidence) and 58 in 53 snakes (2.9%). The most
commonly affected organ in necropsied lizards and snakes
was the liver, but in live snakes the incidence of skin tumours
surpassed those of liver (Sykes & Trupkiewicz, 2006).
Compared with previous studies, the authors found an
increase in incidence of neoplasia, which they suspected to
be caused by increased longevity (due to improvements
in husbandry and veterinary medicine), more thorough
necropsy examinations, and by pathogenic infections (Sykes
& Trupkiewicz, 2006).
Another retrospective study at the Sacramento Zoo
analysed individual snake necropsies, medical records, and
inventory records for the period 1 July 1981 to 30 June
1991. They found 20 snakes affected by 29 neoplasms, 19
of epithelial origin and 10 of mesenchymal origin (Ramsay
et al., 1996).
(c) Amphibians
Scientists have previously used amphibians as models to
study cancer. For example, Schlumberger & Luck´
e (1948)
used the leopard frog (Rana pipiens) to study the effect of
temperature on cancer metastasis. Nevertheless, studies on
both induced and spontaneous neoplasia are still lacking for
this group.
Balls (1962) reviewed several reports of amphibian neo-
plasms and found a lower incidence of tumours for

amphibians than for other species. This could be simply due
to a lack of observations, but many authors have suggested
mechanisms for tumour resistance, including one involving
toad venom and another involving their potent regenerative
ability. The author also mentions the early deaths of both cap-
tive and wild frogs as a possible explanation. Urodeles (sala-
manders) seem to have less spontaneous tumours than anu-
rans (frogs), but this could have arisen from a lack of studies.
Tumours of the skin were the most common in
amphibians.
This
could
be
explained
by
the
easier
observation of the skin compared to other organs, but
the author suggests it could also be related to the high
metabolic activity of the skin and to its constant contact with
the environment, as opposed to visceral organs which are
protected (Balls, 1962).
Tumours of the haematopoietic system are different in
amphibians and fishes than in other animals. These two
groups have no lymph nodes, and their main haematopoietic
organs are the spleen, kidney, and intestinal submucosa
instead of the bone marrow. Interestingly, the kidneys are
the most common site of visceral tumours in amphibians
(Balls, 1962).
(d) Fishes
Fishes are the largest class of vertebrates. Due to their
economic importance, they are caught in large quantities
and examined with care, leading to a greater quantity and
quality of data on neoplasia in these animals (Schlumberger
& Luck´
e, 1948). Emerging aging models like the turquoise
killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), a short-lived vertebrate, also
have a high incidence of cancer, mostly liver and kidney (Di
Cicco et al., 2011).
A review by Schlumberger & Luck´
e (1948) revealed that
the most common benign epithelial tumours in fish are
papillomas, many of which have an infectious aetiology.
Adenocarcinomas, which are common in humans, were rare
in these animals (Schlumberger & Luck´
e, 1948).
The most common neoplasms of the connective tissue
were the benign and malignant tumours of the connective
tissue proper, and the most common pigment cell tumours
were melanomas (Schlumberger & Luck´
e, 1948).
Like amphibians, fishes do not possess lymph nodes and
their haematopoietic organs are the spleen, mesonephros
(the kidney), intestine, and gonads. 15 of the 20 reported
lymphosarcomas in fish were present in the kidney
(Schlumberger & Luck´
e, 1948).
Masahito, Ishikawa & Sugano (1988) point out that despite
different organ morphology, many tumours in fish are
histologically similar to those in humans, such as those
of the liver and ovary. However, it is important to consider
other biological features of these neoplasms, such as age.
Wilms’ tumour, for example, is a type of kidney cancer that
in humans only develops in children and is often fatal, but in
fish it may also affect adults.
Some fish tumours seem to have similar aetiology to
human tumours. Researchers have isolated a herpesvirus in
skin papillomas of salmonids, suggesting that viruses play a
role in the development of cancer in fish. Hepatic tumours
in fish are associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
chemical contaminants that are implied in carcinogenesis in
humans (Masahito et al., 1988).
(4) Invertebrates
Scientists previously thought only vertebrates could develop
tumours. However, recent research supports the existence of
tumours in invertebrates (Tascedda & Ottaviani, 2014).
Aktipis et al. (2015) searched for cancer in all lineages
containing multicellular organisms and found cancer or
cancer-like disease in all but five lineages: Choanoflagellata,
unicellular organisms that form simple multicellular colonies;
Ctenophora and Placozoa, two groups of primitive organisms
which lack many components involved in traditional
neoplastic pathways; Porifera, which have no distinct
tissues or organs, and some of which have a cell-shedding
mechanism used to remove damaged cells; and Hemicordata,
which like elephants bear additional copies of TP53.
Research in cnidarians shows that even pre-bilaterian
animals can develop neoplasia (Domazet-Loˇ
so et al., 2014).
Two different species of Hydra have presented with
tumour-bearing polyps. The cells in these tumours were
invasive, which suggests that metastatic capacity has ancient
roots. Additionally, the tumours had several orthologues to
tumour-related genes in mammals and displayed parallels
to the hallmarks of cancer in vertebrates. The proposed
mechanism for tumourigenesis in Hydra is the accumulation
of stem cells if they are not appropriately removed
by programmed cell death (Domazet-Loˇ
so et al., 2014).
Scientists have also identified several cancer-like lesions in
corals (Aktipis et al., 2015).
Flies of the Drosophila genus are among the best-studied
invertebrates. The most common tumours in this group
are those of the lymph glands – which have hematopoietic
function in Drosophila – and of haematocytes (Scharrer &
Lochhead, 1950).
A haematopoietic tumour is known in molluscs; the cells
responsible for these cancerous haematocytes overexpress
heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), which codes for a protein
that inactivates the tumour suppressor TP53 (Muttray et al.,
2010).
(5) Plants
Like animals, plants also develop tumours. However, in
plants the incidence of tumours is relatively low, and the
tumours are not as lethal as those of animals (Doonan &
Sablowski, 2010). Plant tumours can be caused by pathogens,
and without pathogens most plants are not susceptible to
neoplasia.
Plants also present with decreased rates of malignancy.
One possible mechanism is that their cells are fixed in a
cell wall matrix, which prevents the motility required to
metastasise. This highlights the importance of interactions
between a precancerous cell and the extracellular matrix in

Thales A. F. Albuquerque and others
maintaining cell identity and preventing metastasis (Doonan
& Sablowski, 2010).
Plants have orthologous genes of many mammalian
tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, but it seems that
mutations in these genes are not oncogenic, possibly due
to redundancy of some cell cycle regulators (Doonan &
Sablowski, 2010).
III. DISCUSSION
Our goal herein is to provide an overview of the diversity
of cancer across the tree of life. Due to space limitations we
cannot discuss in detail every report of cancer in all animal
species, so we focus on summarizing the most important
findings in mammals. A clear drawback was the lack of
data for many species, and therefore our conclusions and
interpretations are based on only a subset of species.
From an evolutionary perspective, the vulnerability that
most animals have to cancer seems to be due to a combination
of strong reproductive pressures and lack of selection for sur-
vival beyond reproductive age. For example, haematopoietic
cancers are noteworthy for being common in almost all ani-
mals studied, and are common in humans during childhood
and adolescence. This finding is in line with the idea that
pressures exerted by pathogens on the immune system cause
organisms to prioritize stronger defences at a cost of increased
cancer vulnerability. Although scientists have already shown
that infectious agents can induce tumour formation, we ver-
ify that their role in carcinogenesis extends to most living
organisms, and we highlight studies in plants which show that
pathogens are crucial for tumorigenesis in these organisms.
By contrast, a reduction in selection pressure against
cancer
causes
cancer
susceptibility
to
increase
after
reproductive age, which could explain the low incidence
of cancer in wild animals, with their lower age expectancy.
Elephants and whales are exceptions to this observation:
they are some of the few animals that grow old in the
wild. Elephants also increase in reproductive potential as
they age. In such animals, selection for cancer resistance
may persist, even for the elderly. Dogs, cats, humans, and
mice, on the other hand, have become long lived because
of the controlled environments they live in, and they are
the mammals with the highest rates of cancer. One possible
explanation could be the recent transition from the wild to
the new environment, generating an evolutionary mismatch.
Regardless of the reason, the extreme longevity of humans
plays an important role in the high incidence of cancer
in our species. We also note that the available data from
animals in the wild may not be representative of their whole
lifespan, since for many wild animals (e.g. cetaceans) we have
a perspective of cancer focused on young individuals.
One striking finding from our work is that some human
cancers are rare in non-human primates. Prostate cancer is
known to be rare in other species, which is not surprising
because it is strongly age-related. The few cases of testicular
cancer in non-human primates are harder to interpret
because in humans, this cancer typically affects young men
(Fig. 3), implying that we should be able to find it in other
species (de Magalh˜
aes, 2013). It is possible that testicular
cancer (like other cancer types) is strongly influenced by
the human environment, as implied by different patterns in
incidence in developed and developing countries (Ferlay et al.,
2013). Another possibility is that some post-reproductive
cancers are evolutionary accidents, random events in the
evolution of species. Additional research comparing cancer
incidence and cancer types in humans and non-human
primates is warranted.
The evidence discussed above suggests that the current
rates of certain cancers in humans may be a product of
an evolutionary mismatch with modern environments. The
longer lifespans enjoyed in developed societies are also likely
to be a major factor. Additionally, it is worth considering that
cancer-inducing genotypes occurring in less than 1/10000
may not be susceptible to negative selection, since this is
the estimated limit of the resolution of natural selection for
humans (Fisher, 1930).
Given the cancer resistance of humans with GHR
deficiency (Guevara-Aguirre et al., 2011) and the cancer
resistance of mice with multiple copies of TP53 (García-Cao
et al., 2002) or INK4a/ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) (Matheu
et al., 2004), cancer resistance is probably not a hugely
complex adaptation, even though there are certainly different
evolutionary routes to achieve it. There are also possibly
other adaptations in cancer-resistant organisms, for example
at the level of telomere length regulation (de Magalh˜
aes,
2013) or cell division timing (Maciak & Michalak, 2015).
Indeed, we know very little about cell turnover in large
mammals, including stem cells (Greaves & Ermini, 2015).
Comparative studies of cell division rates, cell metabolism
and cell turnover across mammals are a promising area of
future inquiry. Lastly, short-lived species may have a lower
threshold for mutated cells to continue proliferating, given
that their evolutionary priority is to grow quickly (Freitas &
de Magalh˜
aes, 2011).
The absence of cancer in GHR-deficient patients also
suggests that cancer incidence may be fine-tuned for each
species: i.e. it is within a fairly narrow range described by
longevity and body mass, even though the incidence of
cancer can increase dramatically following single mutations.
This fine-tuning fits evolutionary theory in that cancer
is largely age-related, with a low incidence early in life.
Another related observation is that the onset of cancer
seems to occur in proportion to the species lifespan: there
is a strong pressure to avoid cancer at earlier ages, which
decreases at the end of reproduction.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
(1) Cancer is pervasive across metazoans, and perhaps
even across other kingdoms. We can assume that cancer
affects all species of mammals.

(2) Although cancer may be unavoidable in animals with
dividing cells that live long enough, data from elephants and
bowhead whales suggest that it is possible to live for a long
time with a large body mass, but have a low cancer risk.
There is great variation in the age of onset and incidence of
cancer across mammals, the genetic, cellular and molecular
underpinnings of which are worthy of further inquiry.
(3) We do not yet know if the mechanisms identified in
long-lived, cancer-resistant animals are responsible for their
longevity and resistance to cancer, but some studies suggest
that only a few mutations (or even a single mutation) can
greatly increase cancer resistance.
(4) Our work highlights the different evolutionary pressures
acting on cancer early in life (with a high prevalence of blood
cancers presumably driven by the need to fight pathogens)
and cancer late in life that escapes natural selection, including
human-specific cancers that may be evolutionary accidents
or related to a mismatch with the modern environment.
(5) This review included published evidence from only a
subset of species. It would be advantageous if researchers
collected high-quality evidence on cancer incidence in a
wider range of animals, both in captivity and in the wild. As
additional data become available, we will reach a better
understanding of variation in cancer susceptibility and
resistance in the extraordinary diversity of species on earth.
