An overview of recreational marijuana’s impact on the brain, 
noting issues for consumers and policymakers to consider 
including medical MJ.
Key Points
•
•
Recreational marijuana (MJ) use relates to poorer 
cognition across numerous domains (particularly 
executive function and memory), as well as altera-
tions in brain structure and function.
•
•
Earlier age of MJ onset (i.e., during adolescence), as 
well as higher frequency and magnitude of use, relate 
to further impairment.
•
•
Medical MJ (MMJ) may confer a unique impact on 
the brain, given that MMJ consumers are often 
adults who are beyond critical neurodevelopmental 
periods and who may also seek products based on 
therapeutic potential, rather than for mood altering 
effects.
•
•
Safe guidelines for frequency and magnitude of use, 
MJ potency, and use of concentrates are critical con-
siderations for policymakers; however, further 
research is needed to facilitate informed decision 
making.
Introduction
Marijuana (MJ) has been used for thousands of years. 
Although referenced in Chinese medicine as early as 2700 
BC, it was not until 1850 that MJ was added to the U.S. 
pharmacopeia and considered part of mainstream medicine 
in the Western world. In the early 1900s, recreational use of 
MJ emerged in the United States, but as prohibition senti-
ments grew, many states also began banning cannabis. The 
political climate continued to strongly influence the pub-
lic’s view of MJ, eventually leading to its removal from the 
U.S. pharmacopeia in 1942, marking one of several pivotal 
shifts in the nation’s view toward cannabis. In 1970, the 
Controlled Substances Act declared MJ a Schedule I sub-
stance, which by classification deems it as having “no cur-
rently accepted medical use, no demonstrated safety profile 
and a high potential for abuse” and considers it a danger

Marijuana on the Mind? The Impact of 
Marijuana on Cognition, Brain Structure,  
and Brain Function, and Related Public  
Policy Implications

Abstract
Although marijuana (MJ) has been used for thousands of years, the public’s opinion of MJ has shifted drastically over the 
past century, leaving many wondering about its potential risks and benefits. This article summarizes research detailing the 
impact of recreational MJ and related variables (frequency, magnitude, potency, and mode of MJ use) on cognition, brain 
structure, and brain function. MJ use, particularly at young ages, has been reported to undermine cognition, as well as alter 
brain structure and function. Furthermore, we discuss how data from recreational MJ studies, as well as more recent medical 
marijuana (MMJ) research findings, relate to legalization efforts. Considerations for policymakers, such as age limits, guidelines 
for safe use, and the therapeutic potential of certain constituents of MJ (i.e., cannabidiol), are also outlined. In recent years, 
policy has outpaced science; important areas in need of further research are noted.

due to “potentially severe psychological or physical depen-
dence” (DEA.gov, n.d.).
However, in subsequent years, several states voted to 
decriminalize MJ; in 1996, California became the first to 
approve medical marijuana (MMJ). Since then, MJ contin-
ues to make headlines as an increasing number of states have 
followed suit. To date, 28 states and Washington, D.C., have 
enacted full MMJ programs, whereas 17 states allow limited 
access to specific MMJ products. Eight states and 
Washington, D.C., have also legalized recreational MJ use. 
Legal MJ is considered the fastest growing market in the 
United States, with a current estimated value of US$6.7 bil-
lion, which could reach US$21.8 billion by 2020 (Arcview 
Market Research, 2016).
Currently, 22.2 million Americans report past-month MJ 
use (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 
2015), and given the trajectory of MJ legalization, perceived 
risk and harm related to MJ use is at an all-time low. In 2015, 
fewer than half of high school seniors thought regular MJ 
smoking was harmful, a significant drop from previous years 
(Johnston et al., 2015). In fact, more high school seniors 
report using MJ daily (6%) than smoking cigarettes daily 
(5.5%), and more than 21% of seniors report current MJ use. 
As adolescence is a time of neuromaturation, and increasing 
evidence demonstrates that the adolescent brain is more vul-
nerable to the effects of drugs than the adult brain, those at 
the greatest risk of adverse consequences represent a grow-
ing population of MJ consumers, a combination that poses 
public health concerns (Schneider, 2008).
During adolescence, brain regions, particularly those 
associated with executive functioning (e.g., problem solving, 
planning, inhibition), undergo processes that refine and 
strengthen neural networks; this occurs until at least the mid-
20s. Throughout emerging adulthood, white matter (WM) 
volume and integrity also increase, which relates to improve-
ments in neural conductivity (Giedd et al., 1999; Jernigan & 
Gamst, 2005). Given these critical neurodevelopmental 
changes, the brains of teens and emerging adults are particu-
larly vulnerable to the effects of drugs, compared with adults 
who are developmentally mature.
MJ interacts with the body’s natural endocannabinoid 
(eCB) system, which includes two types of cannabinoid 
receptors, CB1 and CB2 (although some have posited a third 
receptor type), and the body’s own endogenous cannabi-
noids, including anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol 
(2-AG). The eCBs (those that naturally occur in the body) 
and exogenous cannabinoids (those that are not produced by 
the body) act primarily via CB1 receptors, predominantly 
distributed in the central nervous system, and CB2 receptors, 
located in both the central nervous system and peripheral 
organs. The eCB system plays a significant role in homeosta-
sis and neuroplasticity, including neurogenesis and refine-
ment of neuronal connections (Befort, 2015; Egerton, 
Allison, Brett, & Pratt, 2006; Katona & Freund, 2008). 
Increased eCB signaling is associated with improved cogni-
tion (Egerton et al., 2006), reduced stress response, emo-
tional regulation, and increased endogenous reward signaling 
(Befort, 2015; Hill & McEwen, 2010).
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psy-
choactive constituent of MJ, is a CB1 agonist with strong 
binding affinity for CB1 receptors, meaning that THC effi-
ciently activates CB1 receptors. Given that the eCB system 
affects growth, differentiation, positioning, and connectivity 
among neurons, exposure to exogenous (external) cannabi-
noids such as THC may disrupt such neural development, 
especially during adolescence.
However, it is of note that preliminary evidence also sug-
gests that MJ and its constituents also likely hold extraordi-
nary potential for the treatment of a number of medical 
conditions (Whiting et al., 2015). Unfortunately, as a result 
of MJ’s classification as a Schedule I substance, relatively 
few trials have been conducted regarding the effects of MMJ. 
Despite the paucity of MMJ data, decades of research have 
explored the effects of recreational MJ use on the brain. This 
article reviews salient findings regarding the impact of recre-
ational MJ on cognition, brain function, and brain structure, 
and discusses future directions for MJ research as it pertains 
to public policy and MMJ programs.
Neurocognitive Consequences of MJ Use
Cognition
In recent years, numerous studies have examined the cogni-
tive consequences of MJ use. Overall, the majority of studies 
assessing the chronic effects of MJ have shown that those 
who use MJ regularly exhibit poorer cognitive performance 
across a range of domains, relative to non-MJ users. Although 
the findings summarized below are not exhaustive, taken 
together, recent reviews of the effects of MJ suggest that 
executive functioning and memory are most strongly affected 
by regular MJ use. Although processing speed is also 
adversely impacted, findings are more inconsistent with 
regard to IQ.
Executive function (EF). EF is a multi-faceted cognitive con-
struct, which involves controlling and enacting behaviors to 
attain a goal, and includes processes such as planning, rea-
soning, inhibitory processing, self-monitoring, and problem 
solving. Although studies of EF often examine a variety of 
specific skills within this domain (e.g., attention, decision 
making, risk taking, inhibition, and verbal fluency), among 
cross-sectional studies, there is general consensus that MJ 
use negatively impacts EF (for review, see Crean, Crane, & 
Mason, 2011). Moreover, those with an earlier age of MJ 
onset and higher levels of MJ use appear more impaired than 
later onset users on EF measures (Gruber, Sagar, Dahlgren, 
Racine, & Lukas, 2012; Sagar et al., 2015). Several investi-
gations have also noted that lower EF appears to predict 
 106

increased MJ use (Dahlgren, Sagar, Racine, Dreman, & Gru-
ber, 2016; Squeglia, Jacobus, Nguyen-Louie, & Tapert, 
2014) and MJ-related problems (Day, Metrik, Spillane, & 
Kahler, 2013).
Memory. Cross-sectional studies also demonstrate that MJ 
use adversely affects numerous aspects of memory (for 
review, see Broyd, van Hell, Beale, Yücel, & Solowij, 2016; 
Solowij & Battisti, 2008). In particular, studies have consis-
tently documented impaired verbal learning and memory in 
heavy MJ users. Adolescent MJ users exhibited similar ver-
bal learning deficits as adults, long-term heavy MJ users, 
despite less cumulative exposure (Solowij et al., 2011), pro-
viding evidence that the developing brain may be particu-
larly vulnerable. In addition, adolescent MJ users have 
demonstrated poorer story memory, relative to age-matched 
control participants (Medina et al., 2007).
Despite strong evidence for verbal memory impairment, 
findings in other areas of memory function, namely, associa-
tive memory and visuospatial memory, are less robust. For 
example, although Sneider, Gruber, Rogowska, Silveri, and 
Yurgelun-Todd (2013) reported deficits in visual memory 
retrieval in MJ users, Smith, Longo, Fried, Hogan, and 
Cameron (2010) did not detect performance deficits on a 
visual memory task. In addition, although few have utilized 
associative memory tasks, one recent study failed to detect 
differences between MJ users and healthy controls (Jager, 
Block, Luijten, & Ramsey, 2010).
Processing speed. Only a handful of studies have examined 
processing speed with mixed results. Although Becker, Col-
lins, and Luciana (2014) observed better processing speed in 
college-aged MJ smokers, most have observed deficits in 
current (Auer et al., 2016) and recent MJ users (Thames, 
Arbid, & Sayegh, 2014) relative to non-users, including a 
longitudinal study (Fried, Watkinson, & Gray, 2005). Fur-
thermore, some evidence suggests that increased use (Lis-
dahl & Price, 2012) and higher cumulative exposure (Auer 
et al., 2016) to MJ are related to slower psychomotor/pro-
cessing speed.
IQ. Until recently, most longitudinal studies reported lower 
IQ among MJ users relative to healthy controls (e.g., Fried 
et al., 2005; Meier et al., 2012). However, two recent longi-
tudinal studies with the largest sample sizes to date have 
challenged these findings. In two sets of adolescent twins 
assessed initially during adolescence and again during 
emerging adulthood, although MJ users demonstrated lower 
IQ relative to non-users, MJ-using twins failed to show sig-
nificantly greater IQ decline relative to their abstinent sib-
lings (Jackson et al., 2016). Accordingly, findings suggest 
that the observed declines in IQ might not be a direct result 
of MJ exposure but rather attributable to familial factors. 
Similarly, a second longitudinal study found that after adjust-
ing for confounding variables, MJ users did not display 
declines in IQ or exhibit lower educational attainment rela-
tive to never-users (Mokrysz et al., 2016). Given inconsistent 
findings, the impact of MJ on IQ remains an area for further 
exploration.
Brain Structure
Advanced neuroimaging techniques provide the opportunity 
to examine the impact of MJ on several aspects of brain 
structure, including gray matter (GM) and WM. GM is com-
prised of neuronal cell bodies and is responsible for informa-
tion processing and decision making. A recent review of 23 
neuroimaging studies (Lorenzetti, Solowij, & Yücel, 2016) 
reported that regular MJ users consistently exhibit reductions 
in GM volume across brain regions, particularly in the hip-
pocampus. In contrast, MJ users generally have larger cere-
bellar and striatal volumes. These somewhat mixed findings 
are consistent with a previous review in which authors 
reported bidirectional structural imaging findings, dependent 
on the brain region under investigation (Batalla et al., 2013). 
However, in general, regions commonly altered in MJ users 
are typically those with high densities of CB1 receptors 
(Lorenzetti et al., 2016). Furthermore, several studies link 
GM alterations to increased executive dysfunction (Medina 
et al., 2009, Medina, Nagel, & Tapert, 2010; Price et al., 
2015), impulsivity (Churchwell, Lopez-Larson, & Yurgelun-
Todd, 2010), and poorer verbal memory (Ashtari et al., 
2011), suggesting that structural alterations negatively 
impact cognition.
Alterations also appear to be influenced by age of onset 
and increased MJ use. For example, Filbey, McQueeny, 
DeWitt, and Mishra (2015) found opposing effects on corti-
cal thickness in early (thickening) versus late (thinning) 
onset users. In addition, although a recent 3-year longitudi-
nal study of young adult, heavy MJ users observed no effect 
on GM at follow-up, cross-sectional analyses at baseline 
indicated that higher MJ use was related to decreased GM 
volume in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocam-
pus (Koenders et al., 2016). The authors concluded that 
although adolescent MJ users are vulnerable to GM reduc-
tions, little further damage appears to occur after early 
adulthood.
Whereas GM is responsible for decision making, WM 
plays a critical role in promoting efficient communication 
both within and between brain regions. In general, studies 
link MJ use to reduced WM integrity in several areas of the 
brain (prefrontal, limbic, parietal, and cerebellar tracts) in 
adolescent and emerging adult MJ users (e.g., Clark, Chung, 
Thatcher, Pajtek, & Long, 2012; Epstein & Kumra, 2015; 
Gruber, Silveri, Dahlgren, & Yurgelun-Todd, 2011; Gruber, 
Dahlgren, Sagar, Gonenc, & Lukas, 2014). In a large sample 
of MJ users (n = 466), earlier age of MJ onset was related to 
lower WM coherence (Orr, Paschall, & Banich, 2016). 
Conversely, slightly higher coherence has also been observed 
in adolescent MJ users in certain regions (DeLisi et al., 2006) 
 Gruber and Sagar 
107
or at certain stages of development (Jakabek, Yücel, 
Lorenzetti, & Solowij, 2016), suggesting that although MJ 
affects multiple WM tracts, directionality remains somewhat 
unclear. Lower WM integrity also correlates with higher 
impulsivity scores, specifically in early onset MJ users 
(Gruber et al., 2014). Alterations in WM have been identified 
as a potential risk factor for poorer EF and symptoms of can-
nabis-use disorders (Clark et al., 2012). Overall, studies sug-
gest that MJ-related alterations in WM integrity are complex 
and are likely related to specific neurodevelopmental stages 
(Becker, Collins, Lim, Muetzel, & Luciana, 2015; Jacobus, 
Squeglia, Bava, & Tapert, 2013; Jakabek et al., 2016). 
Nonetheless, WM alterations appear to be related to negative 
outcomes.
Brain Function
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides 
information about brain activity, often during the completion 
of cognitive tasks. Several fMRI review papers have found 
strong evidence that MJ use is related to altered activation 
patterns (Batalla et al., 2013; Jacobus & Tapert, 2014; 
Lisdahl, Gilbart, Wright, & Shollenbarger, 2013). During 
tasks involving frontal/EF, attention, spatial/verbal working 
memory, verbal learning, affective processing, and reward 
processing, MJ users exhibit altered activation in the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC) and orbitofrontal, cingulate, parietal, 
insular, subcortical/limbic, and cerebellar regions (Lisdahl, 
Wright, Kirchner-Medina, Maple, & Shollenbarger, 2014, 
for review), compared with non-using control subjects. 
Similar to studies of cognition and brain structure, fMRI 
studies have also revealed that earlier onset of use and longer 
duration of use relate to altered activation during cognitive 
tasks requiring decision making (Behan et al., 2014; Sagar 
et al., 2015; Vaidya et al., 2012) and inhibition (Gruber, 
Dahlgren, Sagar, Gönenc, & Killgore, 2012; Tapert et al., 
2007).
Additional Factors Affecting the Impact 
of MJ Use
Age of Onset, Frequency, and Magnitude of Use
As noted, MJ use during adolescence appears to result in 
negative consequences. Furthermore, earlier age of MJ onset 
may be inextricably linked to higher frequency and magni-
tude (grams used) of MJ use. In recent work demonstrating 
that age of onset predicts cognitive impairment, both fre-
quency and magnitude of MJ use also predict impairment 
(Sagar et al., 2015). In fact, MJ users with early onset (prior 
to age 16) reportedly use MJ nearly twice as often and more 
than 2.5 times as much relative to late-onset users (Gruber, 
Sagar, et al., 2012; Sagar et al., 2015). Overall, frequency 
and duration of use appear to be key factors in determining 
the extent of MJ-related impairment (Lisdahl & Price, 2012; 
Solowij et al., 2012; Thames et al., 2014).
The Role of Abstinence
Abstinence also influences MJ’s effects on cognition; how-
ever, few studies have specifically examined the differential 
impact of variable lengths of abstinence, which may account 
for heterogeneity of findings. Emerging evidence suggests 
recovery of cognitive function after relatively brief absti-
nence periods (Hanson et al., 2010; Medina et al., 2007). In 
one study, adolescent MJ users who abstained for at least 3 
months demonstrated similar cognitive performance relative 
to healthy controls (Fried et al., 2005). Thus far, however, 
few have examined the impact of extended abstinence peri-
ods on cognition, brain structure, and brain function. In short, 
although preliminary evidence suggests some “normaliza-
tion” after cessation of use, additional research is needed in 
this area.
Gender
Data suggest that MJ-related cognitive decrements may 
manifest differently in males and females (Crane, Schuster, 
& Gonzalez, 2013). For example, Crane, Schuster, 
Mermelstein, and Gonzalez (2015) reported that earlier age 
of onset was related to poorer episodic memory in female but 
not male MJ users. In males, however, increased MJ use was 
associated with poorer performance on a decision-making 
task. Lisdahl and Price (2012) found that although MJ use 
was associated with poorer psychomotor speed, cognitive 
slowing was more prominent in males. Similarly, neuroim-
aging studies have revealed gender differences among MJ 
users (McQueeny et al., 2011; Medina et al., 2009). 
Additional research needs to explore the unique impact of 
MJ in males versus females.
Marijuana Constituents: “Not All Marijuana Is 
the Same”
“Marijuana” typically describes all constituents derived from 
the plant Cannabis Sativa L. There are two main species of 
MJ, sativa and indica, and countless strains are hybrids of 
these species. Cannabis contains more than 100 phytocan-
nabinoids and many have unique effects. However, THC is 
most commonly studied due to its role as the primary psy-
choactive constituent of MJ. Research has shown that the 
potency of recreational MJ (measured as THC concentra-
tion) has increased exponentially over the last two decades. 
From 1995 to 2012, average THC levels in MJ rose from 4% 
to 12%—an increase of nearly 200% (ElSohly et al., 2016). 
Furthermore, use of MJ concentrates is becoming increas-
ingly popular. Concentrated products, including “dabs” (the 
colloquial name for concentrated hash oil created by 
 108 
Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences 4(1) 
extracting THC from flower-based MJ products), shatter, 
wax, budder, and others all have significantly higher potency 
relative to traditional flower products, often exceeding 60% 
THC. Furthermore, these products may also contain residual 
amounts of solvents (i.e., butane, hexane), often used to 
make concentrates, which are potentially toxic. To date, little 
attention has focused on the impact of higher THC-containing 
products on cognitive performance or measures of brain 
structure and function in humans. This raises concern that 
adverse consequences associated with MJ use may be worse 
now than in the past, particularly among young users.
In contrast, cannabidiol (CBD), the primary non-psycho-
active constituent of MJ, has become well known for its role 
in treating intractable pediatric epilepsy, and has demon-
strated promise in treating other medical conditions includ-
ing pain and multiple sclerosis (Giacoppo et al., 2015), as 
well as psychiatric conditions including anxiety (Blessing, 
Steenkamp, Manzanares, & Marmar, 2015) and psychosis 
(Leweke et al., 2012; Zuardi et al., 2009). Unlike THC, CBD 
has low affinity to both CB1 and CB2 receptors (Izzo et al., 
2009), and has been shown to mitigate some of the negative 
effects of THC, including structural alterations in the brain 
(Lorenzetti et al., 2016; Yücel et al., 2016) and adverse psy-
chological symptoms (Morgan et al., 2012). Although some 
studies have also begun to investigate the therapeutic and 
protective properties of other cannabinoids, such as cannab-
igerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), and cannabinol 
(CBN), more thorough research is needed.
Discussion
Marijuana and Public Policy
More than ever before, the nation is anxious to understand 
the impact of MJ use, as states continue to ease restrictions 
on medical and recreational use. Studies of recreational MJ 
use provide evidence that MJ adversely affects the brain, par-
ticularly in adolescents or those with earlier onset of use. 
Adolescence is a period of neurodevelopmental vulnerability 
and, as with other drugs, exposure to MJ is more likely to 
result in alterations than in a mature system. Policymakers 
should carefully consider age restrictions, based on scientific 
evidence highlighting the developmental trajectory of the 
adolescent brain. MJ products must not target youth in adver-
tisements, and safe guidelines for packaging MJ products 
must be established, as accidental ingestion of edibles by 
children is a primary concern in states with legalized MJ.
Studies also indicate that increased patterns of MJ use, 
which appear to be closely tied to earlier onset of MJ of use, 
are related to greater impairment and increased neural altera-
tions. Accordingly, policymakers are encouraged to engage 
in dialogue regarding safe limits of MJ use, especially as lim-
ited research is currently available. Additional studies of 
light or casual MJ users are necessary. A further consider-
ation regarding safety is the method of administration or 
“mode” of use. Although smoking MJ is traditional among 
recreational users, other modes have increased in popularity, 
including vaporizing, “dabbing,” and using edibles, tinc-
tures, and oils. Research should help determine whether dif-
ferent modes of use have unique effects, and whether some 
are safer than others in terms of required accessories, ability 
to regulate dose, and medical or psychological side effects.
In addition, as MJ plants and related products are highly 
variable with regard to their cannabinoid profiles, policy is 
likely better suited if it takes into account the effects of spe-
cific constituents of the plant rather than treating all “mari-
juana” as the same. However, this should not be interpreted 
to mean that cannabinoids should only be isolated for use; 
data suggest that products derived from whole-plant extrac-
tions are more efficacious than isolated compounds (Gallily, 
Yekhtin, & Hanus, 2015; Grinspoon & Bakalar, 1997). 
Instead, limits on THC potency as well as minimums for 
constituents with potentially beneficial effects, such as CBD, 
could be considered, especially in light of rising levels of 
THC coupled with decreasing CBD. As THC is correlated 
with the negative effects observed in recreational users, and 
CBD has neuroprotective properties, reversing this trend 
could be an important next step in public policy.
Research focused on the impact of MMJ is also critical, as 
the number of individuals certified for MMJ use increases. 
Although studies of recreational MJ are available, the status of 
MJ as a Schedule I substance has resulted in limited research 
efforts aimed at assessing the impact of MMJ on various 
aspects of functioning. These restrictions have created a sys-
tem in which numerous products available for sale (i.e., non-
psychoactive hemp-based products with little to no THC) and 
taken by countless consumers are not eligible to be studied in 
clinical trials. Furthermore, although recreational MJ may 
result in adverse effects on the brain, particularly among ado-
lescents, the impact may be different in adult MMJ patients 
who are beyond the period of neurodevelopmental vulnerabil-
ity. MMJ consumers are also more likely to select cannabinoid 
products for their therapeutic properties rather than high THC 
potency, which may provide some degree of protection. 
Furthermore, if physical or psychological symptoms are 
addressed by MMJ use, overall function may improve. In a 
recent pilot study assessing the impact of MMJ in certified 
patients previously naïve to MJ, patients experienced moder-
ate improvement in some aspects of cognitive functioning as 
well as self-reported ratings of reduced sleep disturbance, 
decreased symptoms of depression, attenuated impulsivity, 
and positive changes in quality of life after 3 months of MMJ 
treatment (Gruber et al., 2016). Consistent with other investi-
gations (Haroutounian et al., 2016), patients also reported 
reduced use of conventional medications including opiates, 
which often impair cognitive function and have additional 
unwanted side effects. These findings call for additional MMJ 
research, especially in light of the opioid epidemic, which has 
become a national epidemic in recent years.

Conclusions and Recommendations
As the dialogue regarding legalization of recreational and 
MMJ continues, perceived risk of MJ use has fallen to an all-
time low. Consequently, those with the highest neurodevel-
opmental vulnerability are using MJ more frequently than in 
previous years, posing a serious public health issue. A grow-
ing body of evidence indicates that relative to non-MJ users, 
heavy MJ users exhibit poorer performance on cognitive 
tasks, altered patterns of brain activity, and lower frontal 
WM coherence, which are highly moderated by age of onset 
of MJ use. Given the potential therapeutic benefits of MJ, 
however, it is important to weigh these risks with the bene-
fits. Policy has outpaced science, and eased restrictions 
allowing citizens to use MJ, in some cases without the ben-
efit of appropriate research. Additional investigation is war-
ranted and necessary to guide informed policy decisions. As 
states consider legislation for MJ use, it is imperative to 
determine safe guidelines regarding the impact of MJ on the 
brain, particularly during critical periods of neurodevelop-
ment. Although “just say no” did not work as a successful 
prevention policy, “just not yet” may be a more effective and 
informed message to promote, especially among our nation’s 
youth.
