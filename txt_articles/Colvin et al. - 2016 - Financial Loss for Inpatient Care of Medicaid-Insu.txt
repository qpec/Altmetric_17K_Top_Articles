IMPORTANCE Medicaid payments tend to be less than the cost of care. Federal
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments help hospitals recover such
uncompensated costs of Medicaid-insured and uninsured patients. The Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act reduces DSH payments in anticipation of fewer uninsured patients
and therefore decreased uncompensated care. However, unlike adults, few hospitalized
children are uninsured, while many have Medicaid coverage. Therefore, DSH payment
reductions may expose extensive Medicaid financial losses for hospitals serving large
absolute numbers of children.
OBJECTIVES To identify types of hospitals with the highest Medicaid losses from pediatric
inpatient care and to estimate the proportion of losses recovered through DSH payments.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cross-sectional analysis evaluated
Medicaid-insured hospital discharges of patients 20 years and younger from 23 states in the
2009 Kids’Inpatient Database. The dates of the analysis were March to September 2015.
Hospitals were categorized as freestanding children’
s hospitals (FSCHs), children’
s hospitals
within general hospitals, non–children’
s hospital teaching hospitals, and non–children’
s
hospital nonteaching hospitals. Financial records of FSCHs in the data set were used to
estimate the proportion of Medicaid losses recovered through DSH payments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospital financial losses from inpatient care of
Medicaid-insured children (defined as the reimbursement minus the cost of care) were
compared across hospital types. For our subsample of FSCHs, Medicaid-insured inpatient
financial losses were calculated with and without each hospital’
s DSH payment.
RESULTS The 2009 Kids’Inpatient Database study population included 1485 hospitals and
843 725 Medicaid-insured discharges. Freestanding children’
s hospitals had a higher median
number of Medicaid-insured discharges (4082; interquartile range [IQR], 3524-5213) vs
non–children’
s hospital teaching hospitals (674; IQR, 258-1414) and non–children’
s hospital
nonteaching hospitals (161; IQR, 41-420). Freestanding children’
s hospitals had the largest
median Medicaid losses from pediatric inpatient care (−$9 722 367; IQR, −$16 248 369 to
−$2 137 902). Smaller losses were experienced by non–children’
s hospital teaching hospitals
(−$204 100; IQR, −$1 014 100 to $14 700]) and non–children’
s hospital nonteaching hospitals
(−$28 310; IQR, −$152 370 to $9040]). Disproportionate Share Hospital payments to FSCHs
reduced their Medicaid losses by almost half.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Estimated financial losses from pediatric inpatients covered
by Medicaid were much larger for FSCHs than for other hospital types. For children’
s
hospitals, small anticipated increases in insured children are unlikely to offset the reductions
in DSH payments.

I
n 2013, medical care for patients without private health in-
surance in the United States resulted in $75 billion in esti-
mated uncompensated costs.1 In addition to the care of un-
insured patients, the care of patients with Medicaid coverage
alsocontributestouncompensatedcostsbecauseMedicaidtypi-
cally reimburses below hospital costs. In 2014, hospital finan-
cial losses from Medicaid underpayment totaled $14.1 billion.2
To offset the combined financial losses resulting from the
care of both Medicaid-insured and uninsured patients, the
Medicaid program provides Disproportionate Share Hospital
(DSH) payments to hospitals serving large populations of un-
insured and Medicaid-insured patients.3 In 2013, these pay-
ments were $13.5 billion.1 The Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (ACA) reduces the number of uninsured patients
by requiring individuals to obtain health insurance through
either private marketplaces or expanded eligibility for Med-
icaid. The number of uninsured patients is also reduced by ex-
panding dependent coverage for individuals 19 to 25 years old
through their parents’insurance. In anticipation of decreases
in the number of uninsured patients and therefore decreased
uncompensated care, the ACA and subsequent congressional
legislation beginning in 2018 will gradually reduce DSH
payments.4 Disproportionate Share Hospital payments are
scheduledtobereducedannually,by$2billionin2018andthen
increasing up to an $8 billion reduction in 2025.
The financing of pediatric health care may be uniquely af-
fectedbyDSHreductions.Whilealmostone-fourthofalladults
(20.6%) and practically all adults 65 years and older (96.2%)
rely on Medicare coverage, more than one-third of children are
insured by Medicaid.5,6 In contrast, compared with unin-
sured adults (17% of all adults before 2014), children without
health insurance comprise a small percentage of all children
(8%).5,6Consequently,theincreaseininsuranceenrollmentwill
likely be more limited across pediatric populations and may
not offset decreases in DSH payments.
The existence of hospitals dedicated to the care of children
isanotherwayinwhichthedeliveryofpediatrichealthcaredif-
fersfromthatofadults.Children’
shospitals(whetherfreestand-
ing or within a general hospital) provide a wide range of pediat-
ricspecialtycareorarededicatedsolelytospecificdiseasestates
(eg, pediatric cancer). They represent less than 5% of all hospi-
talsandareresponsibleforapproximatelyone-thirdofallpedi-
atric discharges.7 Approximately half of hospital discharges of
childrenwithmedicalcomplexityandchildrenwiththehighest
illness severity are from children’
s hospitals.7
We sought to identify which hospital types (eg, freestand-
ing children’
s hospitals [FSCHs] and teaching hospitals) incur
the highest estimated aggregate financial losses from pediat-
ric inpatient care covered by Medicaid. We also aimed to de-
termine the proportion of losses reduced by DSH payments in
a subpopulation of FSCHs.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using
2 data sets. The dates of the analysis were March to Septem-
ber2015.First,weusedthe2009Kids’InpatientDatabase(KID)
from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality to determine which hos-
pital types incur the highest financial losses from pediatric in-
patient care covered by Medicaid. Using the KID, we com-
pared aggregate Medicaid financial losses across multiple
hospital types (including children’
s hospitals, teaching hospi-
tals, and community-based hospitals). The 2009 KID con-
tains a sample of 3 407 146 pediatric discharges (age range,
≤20 years) from all community, nonrehabilitation hospitals in
44 states.8 The KID contains a 10% sample of uncomplicated
births and an 80% sample of all other inpatient discharges.8
Therefore, it is only a sample of pediatric inpatient costs. The
2009 KID was chosen over the 2012 KID because 2009 was
the last year with hospital identifiers, which were needed to
connect hospitals to Medicaid reimbursement data found in
other data sources. Our use of 2009 data most likely under-
estimates Medicaid financial losses due to the increased en-
rollment of children in Medicaid from 2009 to 2012, which
resulted in more conservative estimates.9,10
TheKIDdataqualityisassuredthroughtheHealthcareCost
and Utilization Project, participating states, and health care
institutions.11 The KID includes up to 40 International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9-CM)diagnosisandprocedurecodesperdischarge.Payerdata
includeMedicaid(includingpatientswithChildren’
sHealthIn-
surance Program coverage), self-pay or no charge, other, and
private. We used ICD-9-CM codes mapped to complex chronic
conditions12,13 to identify patients with high complexity.
States that deidentified hospitals or restricted financial in-
formation were excluded (Figure 1). We also excluded hospi-
tals without Medicaid reimbursement data. We did not use the
weights available in the KID because they are intended only
toproducenationaldischargeestimatesandareinvalidforhos-
pital-levelestimates.Consequently,theKIDallowedustocom-
pare estimated financial losses across hospital types, with the
recognition that those outcomes are underestimated.
The KID does not record DSH payments. However, we ex-
amined the 2009 audited financial records for 10 of the 12
FSCHs included in our KID study population. These hospitals
had submitted their 2009 annual financial records to the Chil-
dren’
s Hospital Association for their inclusion in the Pediatric
Analysis and Comparative Tool (PACT) database. Unlike the
Key Points
Question Do certain types of hospitals have larger financial losses
from the care of pediatric inpatients with Medicaid coverage?
Findings In this cross-sectional analysis, Medicaid financial losses
were greater in freestanding children’
s hospitals compared with
other hospital types (eg, non–children’
s hospitals). Federal
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, which
compensate hospitals for financial losses acquired from uninsured
and Medicaid-insured patients, decreased those financial losses at
freestanding children’
s hospitals by approximately half.
Meaning Because of high financial losses from Medicaid,
freestanding children’
s hospitals are unlikely to offset decreased
DSH payments from caring for fewer patients who are uninsured.

KID’
s sample of discharges, the PACT database contains all
Medicaid-insuredinpatientcostsandreimbursementsandDSH
payments. Therefore, access to a second data set in the PACT
database permitted us to determine the full financial margin
of each hospital’
s Medicaid-insured and uninsured inpatient
population and to estimate the effect of DSH payments in off-
setting losses. All financial records had undergone indepen-
dent audits for accuracy. Financial records from an addi-
tional 15 FSCHs from non–study population states were made
available to us, and the results of all 25 hospitals are included
in the eTable in the Supplement. This study was deemed ex-
empt from institutional board review, with waiver of consent
by the Office of Research Integrity at Children’
s Mercy Hospi-
tal and Clinics, University of Missouri–Kansas City.
Main Outcome Measures
Our primary outcome was the per-hospital, aggregate inpa-
tientpediatricnetMedicaidincomederivedfromthe2009KID.
The net Medicaid income was defined as the hospital-level re-
imbursement for inpatient care of children with Medicaid cov-
erage minus the cost of that care. Our secondary outcome,
based on the PACT data, was the proportion of Medicaid fi-
nancial loss reduced by DSH payments.
Figure 2 shows how per-hospital Medicaid charges, costs,
and reimbursement in the 2009 KID were calculated. We cal-
culated each hospital’
s net Medicaid income, which repre-
sents reimbursements minus costs, as follows. To estimate
costs, we summed the charges for Medicaid-insured patients
andthenmultipliedthosechargesbythehospital’
sratioofcosts
to charges (RCC). The RCCs are a common method for the de-
termination of health care costs.14-16 The Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality RCCs undergo internal validation
and have shown high correlation compared with external fi-
nancial data sources (both private and governmental sources),

as well as similarity to estimates that are based on specific hos-
pital cost centers.17-19 The RCCs are a recommended method
for the conversion of charges to costs20,21 and are derived from
detailedreportssubmittedbyhospitalstotheCentersforMedi-
care&MedicaidServices.17TheRCCsrepresentahospital’
stotal
inpatient annual costs and charges across all conditions and
payers.17 While using RCCs to estimate individual hospitaliza-
tion costs may lack precision, in aggregate they will yield ap-
propriate cost estimates.18 To estimate reimbursements for
Medicaid-insuredpatients,wemultipliedtheper-hospitalcosts
by each hospital’
s ratio of Medicaid reimbursement to costs.
Each hospital’
s ratio of Medicaid reimbursement to costs was
determined from publicly available, audited reports,22 as well
as Medicaid cost reports from the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaidServicesHealthcareCostReportInformationSystem23and
the American Hospital Association. To calculate each hospi-
tal’
s ratio of Medicaid reimbursement to cost, total Medicaid
reimbursements (excluding any DSH payments) were di-
videdbytotalMedicaidcosts.Finally,wesubtractedtotalcosts
for Medicaid-insured patients from reimbursements to ob-
tain the net Medicaid income.
For measures using the PACT database, we multiplied each
hospital’
s total Medicaid costs, reimbursements, and DSH pay-
ments by their proportion of inpatient to total Medicaid
charges. This calculation resulted in estimates of the inpatient-
specific Medicaid costs, reimbursements, and DSH pay-
ments. Because the proportion of 2009 inpatient to total Med-
icaid charges was not available, 2010 data for that proportion
were used.
Main Exposure of Hospital Type
The main exposure was hospital type, categorized by chil-
dren’
s hospital status and teaching status. A hospital was des-
ignated as a children’
s hospital if it met the definition created
by the Children’
s Hospital Association, namely, a not-for-
profit, self-governing, independent hospital dedicated to serv-
ing children or a pediatric unit within a general hospital, which
has (1) an autonomous governing structure or a standing com-
mittee in the multihospital system, (2) a daily census of at least
45 patients (excluding healthy newborns), (3) pediatric spe-
cialties to support a pediatric training program, (4) a distinct
public identity with established entrances and emergency fa-
cilities, and (5) either fiscal autonomy or discrete cost centers
and a separate staffing plan.24 The Children’
s Hospital Asso-
ciation further subcategorizes children’
s hospitals as FSCHs,
specialty (hospitals caring for a limited number of diagnoses,
such as pediatric oncologic conditions), and children’
s hospi-
tals within general hospitals (CHGHs) if the pediatric unit of a
general hospital met the definition of being a children’
s hos-
pital and self-identifies as a children’
s hospital (Figure 1).
A hospital was designated as a teaching hospital according
to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’
s definition
thatthehospital“hasan[AmericanMedicalAssociation]AMA-
approved residency program, is a member of the Council of
Teaching Hospitals (COTH) or has a ratio of full-time equiva-
lent interns and residents to beds of 0.25 or higher.
”25 Because
allchildren’
shospitalsinthecohortwereteachinghospitals,only
non–children’
s hospitals were further categorized as non–
children’
s hospital teaching hospitals or non–children’
s hospi-
tal nonteaching hospitals (NCNTs).
Statistical Analysis
We compared patient and hospital characteristics across hos-
pital types using the χ2 test. We then summarized hospital-
level costs, reimbursements, and net income using medians
andinterquartileranges(IQRs)andcompareddifferencesusing
the Kruskal-Wallis test. Using a software program (SPSS, ver-
sion 22; IBM Corporation), P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Hospital Characteristics
The 2009 KID study population included 1485 hospitals from
23 states. Table 1 lists characteristics of the included hospi-
tals. The median number of Medicaid-insured discharges
ranged widely across hospital types (from 4082 [IQR, 3524-
5213] FSCHs to 161 [IQR, 41-420] NCNTs) and outnumbered
the median number of uninsured discharges (from 123 [IQR,
69-252] CHGHs to 13 [IQR, 4-33] NCNTs).
Patient Characteristics
The final study population included 843 725 Medicaid-
insured discharges (Table 2). Although less than 5% of hospi-
tals were children’
s hospitals (FSCHs and CHGHs), they ac-
counted for 20.0% of pediatric Medicaid-insured discharges
and 23.4% of privately insured discharges. Forty-three per-
cent of discharges from FSCHs had a complex chronic condi-
tion compared with less than 10% of discharges from NCNTs.

study population. The median aggregate per-hospital costs at-
tributed to pediatric Medicaid-insured inpatients was
$143 072 171 (IQR, $125 856 907 to $158 409 100). The median
reimbursement for that care was $98 856 475 (IQR, $81 181 610
to $112 958 669). Without the inclusion of DSH payments, the
median financial loss was −$41 988 770 (IQR, −$65 992 439 to
−$18 775 781). The median DSH payment attributable to inpa-
tient care was $5 187 414 (IQR, $2 649 343 to $22 304 200).

the subtraction of Medicaid reimbursements from Medicaid costs. Costs are
derived from the 2009 Kids’Inpatient Database by multiplying hospital-level
Medicaid charges by hospital-specific ratios of costs to charges.
Reimbursement is determined by multiplying costs by hospital-specific ratios
of Medicaid reimbursement to costs derived from the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services state-reported Disproportionate Share Hospital payment
reports and Healthcare Cost Report Information System and the American
Hospital Association.

findingsindicatethatfinanciallossesfromthecareofinpatient
Medicaid-insured children at any hospital, but especially chil-
dren’
shospitals,areunlikelytobeoffsetbyinsuringpreviously
uninsured children.
Previous studies have examined the potential effects of
healthcarepaymentreformonhospitalsprimarilyservingadult
populations.Inonestudy,26hospitalswithsmalloperatingmar-
gins, high dependence on DSH payments, or location in states
optingoutofMedicaidexpansionweremostfinanciallyvulner-
able. Other work predicts increased financial losses for safety-
nethospitalsowingtohighercostsfrombothMedicaid-insured
anduninsuredpatientpopulationsasaresultofcontinuedgrowth
of health care spending.27 One study28 examining the effect of
health care reform in Massachusetts, which was partially repli-
cated by the ACA, found that safety-net hospitals initially im-
provedfinanciallyowingtothereductioninuninsuredpatients
butlaterrevertedtotheirprereformfinancialstatuswhenstate-
financed payments for uncompensated care (an equivalent to
DSH payments) were reduced. Consequently, safety-net hospi-
tals fared worse under Massachusetts health reform than non–
safety-net hospitals.29
ThefinancialeffectsofthereductionsinDSHpaymentsare
likely to differ for hospitals serving children, primarily because
thesehospitalsalreadyhavehighMedicaid-insuredpatientpro-
portions (including patients qualifying through the Children’
s
Health Insurance Program) and therefore a lower likelihood of
financialgainsfromincreasedMedicaidenrollment.Thepoten-
tial clinical effects of financial losses may also differ for pediat-
riccarecomparedwithadultcare.Withinpediatriccare,subspe-
cialists are heavily concentrated within children’
s hospitals,
which in turn serve as regional referral centers.30,31
It is unknown if the reductions in DSH payments will affect
theabilityofchildren’
shospitalstocontinueoutreachacrossre-
gionstoservepatientswithhighercomplexityregardlessofpayer.
However,forallhospitaltypes,theeffectofDSHpaymentreduc-
tionswilldependgreatlyonthedecisionsofstateandlocalpolicy
makers,includingindividualstatedecisionsabouttheallocation
ofDSHpaymentsandtheuseofsupplementarylocalfundingto
offsetlossesfromuncompensatedcare.Inaddition,anyincreases
inMedicaidreimbursementtothelevelofactualcostsortoMedi-
care levels would greatly alter the effect of DSH reductions.32,33
SomehospitalsmaybeabletooffsetMedicaidlossesthroughthe
cross-subsidizationofpositivemarginsderivedfromthecareof
privatelyinsuredpatients.However,theabilityofeachhospital
to offset Medicaid losses through cross-subsidization is depen-
dent on their market position, ability to negotiate with private
insurers, and case mix. Hospitals already cross-subsidize care,
and removing DSH payments may exacerbate this subsidy and
thereby affect access for patients with Medicaid insurance.
This study has several limitations. Our study did not in-
clude outpatient or observation-stay discharges. Conse-
quently, our results may underestimate financial losses across
delivery settings. We were also unable to obtain hospital iden-
tifiers for 11 states. Of the 23 states with hospital identifiers, we
were unable to obtain reimbursement data for almost one-
fourth of the hospitals. We are unsure how Medicaid financial
lossesmayhavedifferedinhospitalswithoutavailabledataand
whethertheabsenceofthosehospitalsimpartedselectionbias.
This study also relied on data from 2009, and it is possible that
financial losses attributable to patients with Medicaid cover-
age have changed since that time. Since 2009, the number of
children enrolled in Medicaid has increased.9,10 It may be that
theolderdatausedinthepresentstudyunderestimatedthecur-
rent extent of financial losses. We were also only able to exam-
ine DSH payments of FSCHs and only 10 of the 12 FSCHs in our
KID cohort had data in the PACT database. This small number
ofhospitalsmayaffectthestabilityofourlossestimatesandthe
generalizabilityofthefindings.WecouldnotexamineDSHpay-
ments at non-FSCHs, which also have large volumes of inpa-
tientswithMedicaidcoverage.However,thesehospitalsaresitu-
ated within general hospitals and are likely to experience
financial losses differently than hospitals that exclusively care
for children. The effect of DSH funding depends greatly on the
specific financial condition and insurance mix of each hospi-
tal. Therefore, any effects on patient care will depend not only
onthedecisionsmadebyhospitalsinlightofnewfinancialcon-
ditions but also on their pre-ACA financial health. Also, hospi-
tal cost reporting may not always be completely accurate de-
pending on indirect cost allocation and other factors.
Finally, distinguishing which financial losses were due to
excessively high costs was beyond the scope of the present
study. Further investigation is needed to understand the con-
tribution of payment algorithms for high-severity or high-
complexity discharges, costs associated with trainees, and
other factors. For instance, we found that the largest finan-
cial losses were at children’
s hospitals, but those hospitals had
increased proportions of high-complexity discharges and were
teaching institutions.
Conclusions
Aggregate financial losses incurred by hospitals serving pedi-
atric Medicaid-insured inpatients varied by hospital type, with
losses at children’
s hospitals greatly exceeding losses at other
hospital types. Disproportionate Share Hospital payments re-
ducedthoselossesbyalmosthalf.Giventhefewuninsuredchil-
dren at children’
s hospitals, those hospitals are unlikely to off-
set DSH payment reductions through the increased enrollment
of uninsured patients into either public or private insurance.
Children’
s hospitals serve many of the most complex pa-
tients. In this era of health care system reform, we need to con-
sider how these payment changes may affect the unique pa-
tient populations served by children’
s hospitals.
