Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele identifies a unique population that is at 
significant risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an 
essential ω-3 fatty acid that is critical to the formation of neuronal synapses and membrane 
fluidity. Observational studies have associated ω-3 intake, including DHA, with a reduced risk for 
incident AD. In contrast, randomized clinical trials of ω-3 fatty acids have yielded mixed and 
inconsistent results. Interactions among DHA, APOE genotype, and stage of AD pathologic 
changes may explain the mixed results of DHA supplementation reported in the literature.
OBSERVATIONS—Although randomized clinical trials of ω-3 in symptomatic AD have had 
negative findings, several observational and clinical trials of ω-3 in the predementia stage of AD 
suggest that ω-3 supplementation may slow early memory decline in APOE4 carriers. Several 
mechanisms by which the APOE4 allele could alter the delivery of DHA to the brain may be 
amenable to DHA supplementation in predementia stages of AD. Evidence of accelerated DHA 
catabolism (eg, activation of phospholipases and oxidation pathways) could explain the lack of 
efficacy of ω-3 supplementation in AD dementia. The association of cognitive benefit with DHA 
supplementation in predementia but not AD dementia suggests that early ω-3 supplementation 
may reduce the risk for or delay the onset of AD symptoms in APOE4 carriers. Recent advances in 
brain imaging may help to identify the optimal timing for future DHA clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—High-dose DHA supplementation in APOE4 carriers 
before the onset of AD dementia can be a promising approach to decrease the incidence of AD. 
Given the safety profile, availability, and affordability of DHA supplements, refining an ω-3 
intervention in APOE4 carriers is warranted.
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common degenerative brain disorder, characterized by 
cognitive impairment and abnormal deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles in the brain. The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) allele contributes the greatest 
attributable genetic risk for AD.1 Humans express 3 alternative isoforms of APOE—ε2, ε3, 
and ε4—the most common of which is APOE ε3. The ε4 allele frequency in the general 
population is 15% but is increased to 40% in patients with AD. Individuals with 1 ε4 allele 
are 3 to 4 times more likely to develop AD as those without an ε4 allele, and people with 2 
ε4 alleles have a 12-fold higher risk of developing AD.2
Several mechanisms have been proposed by which APOE4 might lead to an increased risk 
for AD, including (1) less effective clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) from brain to blood,3 (2) 
reduced neuroplasticity and resilience in the face of brain injury,4 (3) pronounced 
inflammatory response,5 and (4) a direct pathologic effect on the cerebrovascular system.6 
Clinical studies suggest an interaction between APOE4 and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). 
Docosahexaenoic acid is an essential long-chain, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid.7 Among 
brain lipids, DHA is of particular importance in AD because the brain requires DHA for 
production and clearance of Aβ, maintenance of neuronal membranes, modulation of 
inflammation,8 and improvement of vascular health.9 Levels of DHA are reduced in the

 brains of humans with AD compared with cognitively healthy older adults.10 Owing to these 
observations, randomized clinical trials of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation for AD treatment 
have been undertaken but yielded mixed and inconsistent results.
In this review, we summarize landmark observational and clinical trials that associate DHA 
with AD risk and focus on the differential interactions between ω-3 and APOE genotype 
during the dementia and predementia stages of AD. We present mechanisms to support 
inefficient delivery of DHA by APOE4 proteins to brain regions involved in AD during the 
predementia stage. In contrast, we present data to support DHA catabolism in the dementia 
stage. We hypothesize that DHA supplementation in APOE4 carriers can prevent or delay 
the onset of AD when the timing precedes the onset of neurodegeneration. We suggest 3 
disease stages, delineated by specific biomarkers, to guide the evaluation of the differential 
efficacy of treatment.
Methods
We searched the PubMed database for original articles, systematic reviews, and meta-
analyses of ω-3 studies in AD that were published before August 30, 2016. Our results 
included preclinical studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal cohorts, and randomized 
clinical trials. For preclinical studies, we discuss findings from a 2012 meta-analysis from 
Hooijmans et al.11 For observational studies, we discuss key findings of cross-sectional and 
longitudinal cohorts and present summaries of these studies in the eTable in the Supplement. 
The results of a meta-analysis on ω-3 and AD incidence conducted by Zhang et al12 are then 
discussed. For randomized clinical trials, we present summaries of key findings of 14 ω-3 
trials in Table 1 and discuss conclusions of a Cochrane systematic review27 from 2012 and a 
systematic review by Yurko-Mauro et al28 from 2015. We then examine mechanistic studies 
that link APOE genotype with DHA metabolism to understand the effect of APOE4 on DHA 
brain delivery and discuss the role of recent advances in brain imaging.
Observations
Role of Long-term DHA Supplementation in the Prevention of AD in Animal Studies
Docosahexaenoic acid significantly affects hippocampal neuronal development and synaptic 
function in the developing hippocampus. In embryonic neuronal cultures, DHA 
supplementation promotes neurite growth and synaptic protein expression.29 Long-term 
deficiency of DHA in the diet led to learning impairment in an animal model.30 A 
systematic review that focused on the effects of relatively long-term ω-3 supplementation 
(minimum period, 10% of an average total lifespan) in AD animal models reported 
significant reductions in detergent-insoluble amyloid levels and plaque burden and improved 
cognitive outcomes.11 The largest beneficial effects were observed when DHA 
supplementation was started before initiating a toxic experimental model of AD (such as 
infusing Aβ peptide in the rat cerebral ventricle). Supplementation with DHA attenuated AD 
pathologic changes in APOE4 transgenic mouse models of AD31 by restoring memory and 
learning and synaptic functions and reducing hippocampal Aβ42 levels to APOE3 levels. 
This finding underscores a role of long-term DHA supplementation in the prevention rather

 than in the treatment of AD, and that the AD phenotype in APOE4 transgenic mouse model 
can be prevented with DHA supplementation.11
Observational Studies Linking ω-3 Intake and Levels With Cognitive Outcomes
Most observational studies associate higher levels of seafood, ω-3 consumption, or ω-3 
blood levels with decreased incidence of AD, better cognitive measures, or preserved brain 
volume in AD-vulnerable regions (eTable in the Supplement). In general, observational 
studies investigated participants without evidence of cognitive impairment at baseline for a 
follow-up duration ranging from 2 to 20 years and evaluated outcomes such as AD incidence 
or cognitive decline. Zhang et al12 summarized 21 of these studies in a meta-analysis of 181 
580 participants, with 4438 dementia cases identified during follow-up ranging from 2.1 to 
21 years. The authors concluded that a 1-serving/wk increment of dietary fish was associated 
with significantly lower risk for AD dementia (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95; P = .
003).
Randomized Clinical Trials of ω-3s in AD Dementia and Predementia
The effects of ω-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes in randomized clinical trials13–26 
have been mixed (Table 1). Supplementation was not effective in the treatment of 
symptomatic AD.13,14 In studies that included participants with mild or no cognitive 
impairment, the results were mixed. A Cochrane review27 in 2012 found no evidence to 
support ω-3 supplementation in cognitively healthy older individuals. In contrast, a 2015 
meta-analysis that examined additional studies28 concluded that ω-3 supplementation 
significantly improves episodic memory. In cognitively healthy individuals, 6 randomized 
clinical trials demonstrated better memory functions with ω-3 supplementation compared 
with placebo,17–20,23,24 whereas 6 trials reported no benefit.15,16,21,22,25,26 Some of these 
randomized clinical trials had limitations. For example, in 2 trials of cognitively healthy 
younger adults, the duration of follow up was less than 6 months.21,22 Some trials used low 
doses of ω-3.21,26 In 1 trial, no cognitive decline in the placebo and the ω-3 intervention 
arms was observed.25
We suggest the following 4 factors that might explain these variable results: (1) limitations 
or differences in study design (eg, age, dose, or duration); (2) selection of participants who 
will not progress to AD dementia; (3) stage of disease at the time of ω-3 supplementation; 
and (4) baseline ω-3 consumption. Given the safety profile, availability, and affordability of 
ω-3 supplements, refining ω-3 interventions and trial designs to identify a population that 
might have a beneficial response is worthwhile.
Effect of APOE Genotype on the Association of ω-3 With Cognitive Outcomes
The APOE genotype often appears to affect the response to ω-3 supplementation, and, 
conversely, ω-3 supplementation can affect the influence of APOE genotype on AD 
symptoms,13,15,19,32–39 although these results are inconsistent (Table 2). Some observational 
studies do not reveal an effect of APOE status on the association of ω-3 with cognitive 
outcomes.40–42 An inverse association between low serum DHA levels and cerebral 
amyloidosis was reported in older nondemented participants independent of APOE 
genotype.43

 In some observational studies, the benefit of increased seafood or ω-3 consumption on 
cognition was restricted to APOE4 noncarriers32–35 and, in particular, those with limited 
seafood intake (<1serving/wk).32,33 The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS)–
sponsored DHA trial reported a null effect on cognitive outcomes, but a preplanned analysis 
revealed a cognitive benefit (using the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease 
Assessment Scale) in the DHA treatment arm in APOE4 noncarriers.13
In other studies, benefit was restricted to APOE4 carriers.15,19,36,37 The beneficial response 
in APOE4 carriers was observed in younger participants in the randomized clinical trial by 
Stonehouse et al19 (mean age, 33 years) and the observational cohort of Laitenen et al36 
(mean age, 50 years, with 20-year follow-up). In a cross-sectional study of deceased 
participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project,37 participants were free of dementia 
at study entry and underwent annual clinical neurologic evaluations and brain autopsy at 
death with a mean follow-up duration of 8 years. Individuals who were APOE4 carriers and 
consumed at least 1 meal of seafood per week or had higher intakes of long-chain ω-3 fatty 
acids had less AD neuropathologic changes compared with those who consumed lower 
amounts.
A recent report in the ADCS-sponsored DHA clinical trial found that baseline cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) DHA levels were lower in APOE4 carriers compared with APOE2 carriers.44 
After treatment, lower DHA levels were observed in persons with more advanced brain 
disease as determined by the lowest tertile of CSF Aβ42 levels.44 These findings agree with 
those of preclinical studies in 13-month-old, APOE–targeted replacement (TR) mice, where 
brain DHA levels were lower in APOE4-TR mice compared with APOE2-TR mice.45 
Accordingly, we propose a complex interaction between APOE4 status and disease stage 
such that the response to ω-3 supplementation depends on whether supplementation 
precedes the onset of neurodegeneration. These studies indicate that APOE4 is a modifiable 
AD risk factor, and that the effect of APOE4 on AD pathologic changes can be attenuated 
with DHA supplementation.
Mechanisms Underlying the Association of APOE4 With DHA Brain Uptake
Isoforms of APOE differ in structure from each other only at amino acids 112 and 158. The 
APOE2 allele has cysteine at both sites, the APOE4 allele has arginine at both positions, and 
the APOE3 allele contains cysteine at amino acid 112 and arginine at amino acid 158. Such 
minor differences give rise to variability in domain interactions with multiple molecules, 
including the low-density lipoprotein receptor, cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans, 
adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette protein 1 (ABCA1), and low-density lipoprotein–
related proteins, as well as with protein stability and protein folding.46 Differences in the 
metabolism of APOE particles are likely directly related to APOE conformation and 
receptor binding. APOE2 exhibits a more stable conformation and has lower affinity to the 
low-density lipoprotein receptor, which may lead to decreased catabolism. In contrast, 
APOE4 has a less stable conformation, increased affinity to the low-density lipoprotein 
receptor, and increased catabolism.
Effect of APOE4 on DHA Transport Before the Onset of Neurodegeneration—
Several mechanisms link APOE4 with reduced brain DHA metabolism. These mechanisms

 include (A) accelerated liver catabolism of DHA, (B) defective DHA transfer across the 
blood-brain barrier, and (C) hypolipidated or decreased APOE particle numbers, resulting in 
less efficient DHA transport (Figure 1). Evidence supports the contention that these APOE4 
mechanisms operate before the onset of neurodegeneration.
Accelerated Catabolism of APOE4 Lipoproteins and Its Relevance to DHA 
Bioavailability—Lower DHA availability in the brain in APOE4 carriers may occur in part 
because of increased liver catabolism of DHA. Docosahexaenoic acid is a fatty acid that is 
transported on lipoproteins after consumption.47 Its catabolism depends on its delivery to the 
liver. Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) are catabolized faster than high-density 
lipoproteins (HDL). APOE4 apolipoproteins, which preferentially bind to VLDL, are 
catabolized faster than APOE3 apolipoproteins,48 which preferentially bind to the longer-
lived HDL. One direct example of faster DHA catabolismin APOE4 carriers comes from a 
study conducted by Chouinard-Watkins et al.49 Forty cognitively healthy older participants 
received a single dose of 40 mg of DHA labeled with carbon 13 (13C). In APOE4 carriers, 
13C-DHA levels in plasma total lipids from 1 hour to 28 days after the dose were 31% lower 
compared with levels in APOE4 noncarriers. These findings suggest increased peripheral 
DHA catabolism, potentially limiting DHA availability to the brain in APOE4 carriers.
Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity Coupled With Transport of DHA to the Brain—A 
decrease in the ratio of CSF to plasma DHA was reported in patients with dementia at the 
lowest tertile of CSF Aβ42 levels.44 Transgenic mouse models prone to brain amyloid 
deposition (3xTg-AD mice) demonstrated less delivery of carbon 14–labeled DHA across 
the blood-brain barrier compared with littermate controls.50 The APOE4 allele is associated 
with breakdown in blood-brain barrier integrity.51 Delivery of DHA to the brain and blood-
brain barrier integrity are both regulated by the major facilitator superfamily domain–
containing 2A transporter (MFSD2a).52 The APOE4 allele may compromise the integrity of 
lipoprotein and MFSD2A transporter functions, providing a common mechanism for 
reduced DHA uptake and loss of blood-brain barrier integrity that associate with early stages 
of AD pathologic changes.
Hypolipidation of APOE4 Lipoproteins in the Brain—APOE4 proteins expressed 
from astrocytes carry fewer lipids (ie, hypolipidation)53 at a young age. In vivo, APOE 
complexes isolated from hippocampal sections of APOE4 replacement mice54 are smaller in 
size, suggesting hypolipidation compared with APOE3 or APOE2 replacement mice. These 
findings can explain why APOE4 replacement mice have decreased delivery of labeled DHA 
to the brain compared with APOE2 replacement mice.45 Importantly, DHA treatment 
attenuates the effect of the APOE4 allele on AD pathologic changes31 in 4-month-old mice. 
A recent report55 found decreased ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in the CSF 
of APOE4 homozygous carriers that was associated with decreased CSF lipids compared 
with APOE4 noncarriers. Enhancing ABCA1 activity may be a viable strategy to reverse 
hypolipidation of APOE4 HDL.
DHA Catabolism With Neurodegeneration—Neurodegeneration in AD dementia is 
associated with activation of catabolic pathways56 that oxidize DHA, converting it into F4-

 neuroprostanes (Figure 2). Neuroprostanes accumulate in patients with AD.57 Phospholipase 
A2 (PLA2) constitutes a complex family of phospholipases that include calcium-independent 
and calcium-dependent PLA2. Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium-dependent 
signaling pathways are dysregulated in the neurons of amyloidosis-prone mice, particularly 
in the hippocampus.58 Amyloid pathologic features induce the activity of calcium-dependent 
PLA2,59 which reduces brain DHA consumption through liberation of free DHA from CSF 
and brain phospholipids. Another investigation60 demonstrated greater CSF calcium-
dependent PLA2 activity in persons with mild cognitive impairment and in patients with AD 
compared with age-matched, cognitively healthy older adults. This greater activity was 
associated with reduced DHA concentrations in CSF phospholipids.
Association of DHA Levels With Cerebral Amyloidosis by Disease Stage
In the ADCS-sponsored DHA trial conducted among persons with mild to moderate AD,44 
plasma DHA levels did not correlate with cerebral amyloidosis as determined by CSF Aβ42 
levels. In contrast, Yassine et al43 demonstrated an association between lower plasma DHA 
levels and cerebral amyloidosis in the observational Aging Brain Study independent of 
APOE genotype. The Aging Brain Study differed from the ADCS-sponsored DHA trial by 
recruiting participants without dementia who were enriched for vascular risk factors. Figure 
3 illustrates the association between plasma DHA levels (using scaled DHA and amyloid 
deposition units to allow for comparison). The association of DHA with amyloid deposition 
in predementia but not clinical disease led to formulation of a timing hypothesis for a DHA 
intervention in preclinical APOE4 carriers. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that an 
intervention using high-dose DHA supplementation in cognitively healthy APOE4 carriers 
can slow the rate of progression to prodromal or clinical AD.
Designing an Informative Clinical Trial in APOE4 Carriers
We propose classifying APOE4 carriers into 3 stages based on disease severity. Stage I 
represents the earliest predementia phase of the disease with evidence of brain imaging 
changes in AD-vulnerable areas, but with subtle or no cognitive changes detectable. In this 
stage, brain DHA metabolism is altered by APOE4, and brain imaging or CSF biomarkers 
can be used to select at-risk individuals and monitor the efficacy of supplementation. Stage 
II represents an early prodromal stage with evidence of memory and/or executive decline but 
no significant impairment in activities of daily living. In this stage, long-term, high-dose 
DHA supplementation would slow cognitive decline. Stage III represents clinical AD with 
impairments in multiple cognitive domains, which interfere with usual occupational and 
social functions (ie, dementia). Intervention with DHA in the dementia stage is not likely to 
be beneficial.
Cognitive Outcome Measures in APOE4 Carriers
In 2009, Caselli et al61 reported accelerated memory decline in APOE4 carriers compared 
with noncarriers. Eight hundred fifteen participants from 21 to 97 years of age were 
monitored longitudinally for a mean of 4.5 years. The greatest difference in cognitive 
domains by APOE status was reflected by the word list memory measure. The divergence in 
memory outcomes between carriers and noncarriers appeared in their 60s in APOE4 
heterozygotes and in their 50s in APOE4 homozygotes.

 Some evidence links ω-3 levels with some of the cognitive deficits observed in APOE4 
carriers. Samieri et al38 reported a significant association between plasma levels of ω-3 fatty 
acids (DHA or eicosapentaenoic acid) and cognitive decline measured during 7 years on the 
Benton Visual Retention Test, a test of working memory and attention. Intervention trials 
with ω-3 supplementation suggested slowing of deterioration in memory and executive 
cognitive domains (memory reaction times,19 attention domains,15 and composite outcome 
that included cued memory and executive functions62) in APOE4 carriers. The modest effect 
size of ω-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes during the predementia stages highlights 
the challenge for smaller clinical trials to detect significant APOE genotype by treatment 
interactions.
Brain Imaging of APOE4 Carriers
APOE4 carriers at an increased risk of developing AD demonstrate brain differences in AD-
vulnerable regions that are evident on several brain imaging modalities before any evidence 
of cognitive decline or AD-related brain neuropathologic changes. Of particular interest are 
APOE4-related changes that become more pronounced with age and are observed in regions 
associated with later cognitive decline. Progressive changes in these brain functions and 
structures can serve as useful diagnostic targets to guide the efficacy of interventions in the 
early predementia phase (stage I).
1.
In corporation of DHA into the brain has been quantified using11 C-labeled DHA 
positron emission tomographic (PET) scans.63 Umhau et al64 demonstrated a 
compensatory increase in brain DHA uptake in the alcohol withdrawal state. The 
DHA PET scans can be a useful tool to quantify the degree of brain DHA uptake 
in APOE4 carriers and inform whether supplementation can enhance brain 
uptake during the various stages of this disease.
2.
Amyloid PET imaging can be used to define a preclinical AD stage in APOE4 
carriers with amyloid deposition at AD-related brain areas. This amyloid 
deposition may appear 1 to 2 decades before the onset of symptoms.65
3.
Fludeoxyglucose F 18–labeled (FDG) PET scans in APOE4 carriers show 
abnormally low rates of glucose metabolism bilaterally in the posterior cingulate 
and parietal, temporal, and prefrontal cortices compared with noncarriers several 
decades before the onset of AD.66 Of these regions, hypometabolism in the 
medial temporal lobe has been shown top redict cognitive decline in cognitively 
healthy older adults.67 Docosahexaenoic acid may have a role in the regulation of 
brain glucose uptake. In 1 nonhuman primate study,68 DHA supplementation 
improved glucose brain hypometabolism.
4.
Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cognitively healthy 
APOE4 carriers display disrupted synchronicity of the signal between the 
hippocampus and the default mode network, a network of regions that are more 
active at rest than during an effortful task.69 This disruption of synchronicity may 
reflect the relative health of the underlying structural connectivity70 or may be an 
independent effect related to synaptic or vascular health, all of which may be 
affected by DHA.71

Because DHA is enriched in oligodendrocytes as well as neurons, it may play a 
role in myelin structure72 and in the brain’s connectivity. Such effects may be 
partially reflected by diffusion tensor imaging measurements. A study by Witte 
et al73 found that 26 weeks of ω-3 supplementation resulted in more intact white 
matter in the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital 
fasciculus, and corpus callosum compared with placebo.
6.
In cognitively healthy older adults, APOE4 has been associated in some brain 
imaging studies with smaller hippocampal volume74 and thinner entorhinal 
cortex.75 These brain measures are all vulnerable to changes in patients with AD.
Conclusions
We propose that disease stage–related alterations in DHA transport affecting peripheral and 
central metabolism in APOE4 carriers should be considered when designing intervention 
studies. We hypothesize that DHA supplementation in APOE4 carriers can result in 
beneficial outcomes if the timing of the intervention precedes the onset of dementia. Given 
the safety profile, availability, and affordability of DHA, refining an interventional 
prevention study in APOE4 carriers is warranted.

 Figure 1. Mechanisms Linking Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) Status With Docosahexaenoic Acid 
(DHA) Delivery to the Brain Before the Onset of Neurodegeneration
Several mechanisms associate the APOE4 allele with DHA brain delivery, including 
accelerated liver catabolism of APOE4 lipoproteins, defective transport across the blood-
brain barrier (BBB), and hypolipidated APOE particles in the brain. These changes in DHA 
brain metabolism appear before the onset of neurodegeneration. ABCA1 indicates adenosine 
triphosphate–binding cassette protein 1; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; HDL, high-
density lipoprotein; MFSD2a, major facilitator superfamily domain–containing 2A 
transporter; and VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein.

 Figure 2. Mechanisms Linking Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) Status With Docosahexaenoic Acid 
(DHA) Delivery to the Brain After the Onset of Neurodegeneration
Activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) associated with neurodegeneration and amyloid 
toxic effects leads to the liberation of free (unesterified) DHA. Unesterified DHA is oxidized 
into neuroprostanes. These changes may not be amenable to DHA supplementation. Aβ 
indicates β-amyloid; C2, calcium-binding domain of PLA2; cPLA2, calcium-dependent 
PLA2; and O2, oxygen.

 Figure 3. Association of Plasma Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Level With Brain Amyloid 
Deposition by Disease Stage
In the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS)–sponsored DHA trial (A), 43 
participants with dementia underwent lumbar puncture before randomization to placebo or 
DHA supplementation for 18 months. In contrast, the Aging Brain Study (ABS) (B) 
recruited cognitively healthy (CH) individuals to gain an understanding of risk factors for 
Alzheimer disease (AD). Sixty-one participants underwent Pittsburgh Compound B positron 
emission tomography to assess cerebral amyloidosis (including 13 apolipoprotein E ε4 
[APOE4] carriers). Given the different methods of DHA level measurements and amyloid 
deposition indices in both studies, the units were scaled from −2 to 4 arbitrary scale units. 
Cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid (Aβ) 42 peptide levels were inverted. Plasma DHA levels 
were not associated with amyloid deposition in the ADCS but were inversely associated with 
amyloid deposition in carriers and noncarriers of the APOE4 allele, which supports the 
timing hypothesis for DHA intervention in APOE4 carriers. Regression lines illustrate a 
significant inverse association between plasma DHA levels and brain amyloid deposition in 
the ABS and a nonsignificant association between baseline plasma DHA levels with brain 
amyloid deposition in the ADCS-sponsored DHA clinical trial.
