IMPORTANCE Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) improves clinical outcomes in patients with
acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by a large vessel occlusion. However, it is not known
whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is of added benefit in patients undergoing MT.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether treatment with IVT before MT with a stent retriever is
beneficial in patients undergoing MT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This post hoc analysis used data from 291 patients
treated with MT included in 2 large, multicenter, prospective clinical trials that evaluated MT
for AIS (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy performed from January 1, 2010,
through December 31, 2011, and Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute
Revascularization from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012). An independent core
laboratory scored the radiologic outcomes in each trial.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were treated with IVT with tissue plasminogen activator followed
by MT (IVT and MT group) with the use of a stent retriever or MT with a stent retriever alone
(MT group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Successful reperfusion, functional independence (modified
Rankin Scale score of 0-2) and mortality at 90 days, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage,
emboli to new territory, and vasospasm were compared.
RESULTS Of 291 patients included in the analysis, 160 (55.0%) underwent IVT and MT (mean
[SD] age, 67 [13] years; 97 female [60.6%]), and 131 (45.0%) underwent MT alone (mean [SD]
age, 69 [12] years; 71 [55.7%] female). Median Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score at
baseline was lower in the IVT and MT group (8 vs 9, P = .04). There was no statistically
significant difference in the duration from symptom onset to groin puncture (254 minutes for
the IVT and MT group vs 262 minutes for the MT group, P = .10). The number of passes, rate
of successful reperfusion, functional independence at 90 days, mortality at 90 days, and
emboli to new territory were also similar among groups. Symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage (1% vs 4%) and parenchymal hemorrhages type 1 (1% vs 3%) or type 2 (1% vs
2%) did not differ significantly (P = .25). Vasospasm occurred more often in patients who
received IVT and MT vs MT alone (27% vs 14%, P = .006). In multivariate analysis, no
statistically significant association was observed between IVT and MT vs MT alone for any of
the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results indicate that treatment of patients experiencing
AIS due to a large vessel occlusion with IVT before MT does not appear to provide a clinical
benefit over MT alone. A randomized clinical trial seems warranted.

iverandomizedtrialspublishedin2015haveproventhat
mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with a stent retriever in
combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is su-
perior to IVT alone in patients experiencing acute ischemic
stroke (AIS) caused by large vessel occlusion in the anterior
circulation.1-6 Before these studies,1-6 IVT with tissue plas-
minogen activator (tPA) was the only reperfusion therapy with
aprovenbenefitonclinicaloutcomeinpatientswithAIS.7Over-
all, 85% of patients included in the MT trials received IVT be-
fore randomization for MT.1-5 However, of those randomized
to subsequent MT without follow-up computed tomographic
angiography after IVT, only a small proportion of patients had
vesselpatencyatthetimeofthefirstcatheterangiography,sug-
gesting that early recanalization in response to IVT is uncom-
mon in this selected patient population with a proximal
occlusion.3Despitethelowfrequencyofearlyreperfusionwith
IVT alone, IVT could positively influence the clinical outcome
after MT. For instance, by enhancing the fibrinolytic process,
IVT could increase the speed and likelihood of successful rep-
erfusion with MT, reduce the required number of passes with
a stent retriever, and decrease the frequency of microvascular
thrombosis.8,9 Moreover, achieving recanalization is not al-
wayspossiblewithMT,andsuchpatientsmaystillbenefitfrom
IVT. Finally, in some patients, especially those with distal oc-
clusions, IVT alone may result in recanalization, averting the
need for MT altogether. On the other hand, IVT may increase
theriskofhemorrhagiccomplications7,10andresultinfragmen-
tation of the thrombus, potentially reducing the efficacy of MT
in achieving complete reperfusion of distal vessels. In addi-
tion, use of IVT may cause a delay of the start of the MT proce-
dure,especiallyifpatientsarefirstadmittedtoaprimarystroke
center and transferred to a comprehensive stroke center only
after a large vessel occlusion has been established. Finally, IVT
is a costly therapy, especially in the United States.11
A direct comparison between MT after IVT vs MT alone has
notbeenstudiedinarandomizedclinicaltrialtodate.Wethere-
fore performed a post hoc analysis from a pooled data set from
2 large prospective clinical trials with independent neuroim-
aging assessment to determine the role of IVT in the treat-
ment of patients with AIS caused by a proximal large vessel oc-
clusion who were treated with MT.
Methods
Study Design and Population
We performed a patient-level, pooled, post hoc analysis of the
Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT) and
Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascu-
larization (STAR) studies. The designs of both these multi-
center, prospective clinical trial studies have been reported
previously.12,13 Briefly, both studies12,13 included patients with
AIS caused by a large vessel proximal arterial occlusion. In
SWIFT, patients were randomized between MT with a Soli-
taire FR stent retriever (Medtronic Neurovascular) or the Merci
device (Stryker Neurovascular).
This study had a roll-in phase in which all patients were
treated with a stent retriever. This roll-in cohort was in-
cluded in the current study. We excluded patients treated with
the Merci device because this does not represent current clini-
cal practice. STAR was a single-arm study in which all in-
cluded patients underwent MT with the Solitaire FR stent re-
triever. In both SWIFT and STAR, patients were eligible if MT
was feasible within 8 hours of symptom onset. Intravenous
thrombolysiswasrecommendedinallpatientswithin4.5hours
of stroke symptom onset who did not have any contraindica-
tion for IVT. In those not treated with IVT, the exact reason was
not recorded in the case report form. To provide some insight
into the possible reasons for withholding IVT, an overview of
absoluteandrelativecontraindicationstoIVTisprovided.Clini-
caloutcomewasevaluatedat90-dayfollow-upusingthemodi-
fied Rankin Scale (mRS). SWIFT was active from January 1,
2010, through December 31, 2011, and STAR from January 1,
2010, through December 31, 2012. SWIFT was situated mainly
in the United States and STAR in Europe, Canada, and Austra-
lia. The local ethics committee at every site approved the study
protocol and informed consent form, and all patients or their
legal representatives provided written informed consent.
The imaging data in STAR and SWIFT were adjudicated
by independent core laboratories. Clinical outcomes were
not centrally adjudicated across the 2 trials. Variables scored
by the core laboratories were location of the occlusion, final
reperfusion grades, and hemorrhagic complications. In
SWIFT, the assessors were masked to allocation of the
patient.
MT Procedure
The aim of the MT procedure in STAR and SWIFT was to
achieve successful reperfusion of the territory of the
occluded vessel as fast as possible. The use of a balloon guide
catheter was mandatory, and rescue therapy with a different
thrombectomy device or intra-arterial chemical thrombolysis
was allowed if deemed necessary by the interventionalist.
Follow-up brain imaging was performed after 24 hours in all
patients.
Statistical Analysis
We compared patients who underwent MT after treatment
with IVT to those who underwent MT alone. Successful rep-
Key Points
Question Is intravenous thrombolysis of added benefit to
patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical
thrombectomy?
Findings This post hoc analysis used data from 291 patients
treated with mechanical thrombectomy included in 2 large
multicenter clinical trials; 55% received intravenous thombolysis in
addition to mechanical thrombectomy, and 45% underwent only
mechanical thrombectomy. After adjustment for potential
confounders, no difference was found between the 2 groups in
any of the clinical or radiologic outcomes studied.
Meaning This study found no apparent benefit of intravenous
thrombolysis to patients with ischemic stroke undergoing
mechanical thrombectomy.

erfusion was defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cere-
bral Infarction (mTICI) score of 2b or higher at the end of the
procedure. We also analyzed separately the differences in
mTICI 3 reperfusion between the groups because pre-
treatment with IVT could influence the frequency of small
distal emboli. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)
was defined as any hemorrhage within 24 hours associated
with an increase of 4 points or more on the National Insti-
tutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or that resulted in
death.
Categoricalvariableswerecomparedbetweengroupsusing
a Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were compared using
a t test, except in the case where medians and interquartile
ranges are reported, in which case a Wilcoxon rank sum test
was used. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we
examined whether the use of IVT was associated with tech-
nical aspects, complication rate, or outcome after MT. The fol-
lowing clinical outcomes were included as dependent vari-
ables in separate models: mRS score of 0 to 2 (good clinical
outcomes),mRSscoresof0to1(excellentoutcomes),andmor-
talityat90-dayfollow-up.Inthesemodels,weadjustedforage,
sex, NIHSS score, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score
(ASPECTS), location of occlusion, atrial fibrillation, diabetes,
site of recruitment, and time from symptom onset to hospital
arrival. To determine an association with technical aspects of
the procedure and safety end points, we used the following
parameters as dependent variables: more than 2 passes with
stent retriever, mTICI 2b or 3 reperfusion, mTICI 3 reperfu-
sion, sICH, emboli to uninvolved territory, atrial fibrillation,
diabetes, site of recruitment, and vasospasm. Finally, for an
association with procedural times, we used as dependent vari-
ables time from hospital arrival to groin puncture of less than
90minutesandtimefromgroinpuncturetoreperfusionofless
than 45 minutes. These models were adjusted for age, sex,
NIHSS score, ASPECTS, location of occlusion, atrial fibrilla-
tion, diabetes, site of recruitment, and time from symptom
onset to hospital arrival. In a sensitivity analysis, we ran all
multivariate analyses excluding patients who received
bridging-dose tPA. SAS statistical software, version 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc), was used for analysis. Statistical significance
was defined as 2-sided P < .05.
Results
Intotal,346patientswereenrolledinSWIFT(n = 144)andSTAR
(n = 202) (Figure). Fifty-five patients from SWIFT random-
ized to treatment with the Merci device were excluded from
the analysis. Of the remaining 291 patients, 160 (55.0%) un-
derwent MT after IVT (mean [SD] age, 67 [13] years; 97 female
[60.6%]), and 131 (45.0%) were treated with MT alone (mean
[SD] age, 69 [12] years; 71 [55.7%] female). Of the patients who
received IVT, IVT failed in 116 (full tPA dose), and 44 received
bridging therapy. The mean tPA dose in patients who re-
ceived bridging therapy was 0.62 mg/kg. The contraindica-
tions for IVT in patients who were treated with MT alone are
reported in Table 1. Overall, 117 patients (89.3%) who did not
receive IVT had at least one contraindication.
The baseline characteristics are provided in Table 2. Pa-
tients who received IVT and MT had a lower frequency of car-
dioembolic stroke attributable to atrial fibrillation (53 [33.1%]
vs 62 [47.3%], P = .02) and diabetes (22 [13.8%] vs 32 [24.4%],
P = .02) and had lower median ASPECTS (8 vs 9, P = .04) com-
pared with patients who were treated with MT alone. No dif-
ferenceswerefoundinmedianNIHSSscores(17inbothgroups)
or occlusion location between groups. Differences in base-
line variables between patients included in SWIFT and STAR
are provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement. A comparison of
baseline characteristics, procedure details, and outcome be-
tween patients who received full-dose tPA and those who re-
ceived bridging-dose tPA is given in eTables 2 and 3 in the
Supplement.
Details of the MT procedure and clinical outcomes are pre-
sentedinTable3.Themediantimefromsymptomonsettohos-
pital arrival was shorter in patients treated with IVT and MT
(171 vs 190 minutes, P = .04), but the median time from hos-
pital arrival to groin puncture was similar in both groups (79
vs 77 minutes, P = .46). No differences were found in the me-
dian number of passes (1 for both groups) or the rate of mTICI
2b or 3 reperfusion (127 [84.1%] vs 105 [84.7%]) among groups.
Vasospasm occurred more often in patients who received IVT
andMT(43[26.9%]vs18[13.7%],P = .006).WefoundthatsICH
occurred less frequently in patients treated with IVT and MT
(2 [1.3%] vs 5 [3.8%], P = .25), but the difference was not sta-
tistically significant. Frequency of other types of ICH was as
follows: parenchymal hemorrhage type 1, 1 (0.6%) vs 4 (3.1%);
parenchymal hemorrhage type 2, 1 (0.6%) vs 2 (1.5%); hemor-
rhagic infarct 1, 29 (18.1%) vs 25 (19.1%); hemorrhagic infarct
2, 19 (11.9%) vs 11 (8.4%); and subarachnoid hemorrhage, 2
(1.3%) vs 4 (3.1%). None of these differed significantly be-
tween groups (Table 3).
Results of the multivariate analyses are presented in
Table 4. We did not find a statistically significant associa-
tion between the use of IVT and any of the outcomes stud-

ied. There was a lower risk of sICH (adjusted odds ratio
[OR], 0.03; 95% CI, 0.00-1.28), a higher risk of emboli to
uninvolved territory (adjusted OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 0.75-
22.54), and a higher rate of functional independence (90-
day mRS score of 0-2: adjusted OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.80-2.74)
in patients treated with IVT and MT, although these findings
were not statistically significant. When we excluded
patients who received bridging-dose tPA, the results of the
multivariate analysis were essentially the same (eTable 4 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
Using data from 2 large international prospective studies, we
examined whether treatment of patients with AIS with IVT be-
fore endovascular clot retrieval with the Solitaire FR stent re-
triever is beneficial or adds any risks to the procedure. Our re-
sults indicate that, after adjustment for confounders, the
combination of IVT and MT had no statistically significant
benefit over MT alone in terms of procedural, clinical, or
safety outcomes.
Only a few studies14-19 have previously examined differ-
encesbetweenendovasculartherapycombinedwithIVTvsen-
dovascular treatment alone. Bhatia et al14 analyzed data from
157 patients included in the Calgary Stroke Program between
2002 and 2009. They observed a trend toward a higher rate of
recanalization and a lower rate of sICH among patients treated
withintra-arterialIVTcomparedwithpatientstreatedonlywith
intra-arterial therapy. There were important imbalances re-
garding endovascular technique and times to treatment be-
tweengroupsinthisstudy,whichmakethedatasomewhatdif-
ficulttointerpret.Adifferentretrospective,single-centerstudy15
also found no difference between IVT and MT vs MT alone, but
again this study had a limited sample size and did not adjust
for confounding variables. A US phase 1 trial in which patients
were randomized to IVT or placebo in combination with intra-
arterial therapy found slightly higher recanalization rates
among patients randomized to IVT.16 This study included
only 35 patients and used intra-arterial thrombolysis instead

of MT, making it no longer clinically relevant. In a recent
study, Broeg-Morvay and colleagues17 used propensity score
matching to compare 40 patients treated with MT with 40
patients who underwent MT after treatment with IVT. They
also did not find any statistically significant differences in
functional outcome or risk of sICH between the groups. How-
ever, unlike our study, they observed a trend toward a lower
risk of sICH in the MT alone group. Weber et al18 reported data
from 250 patients treated with second-generation devices
included in a retrospective, single-center study. Of these, 105
received IVT and 145 underwent MT alone. They did not find
differences in successful revascularization rates (TICI 2b or 3,
73.8% vs 73.1%; P = .95), complications, or good clinical out-
come (mRS scores of 0-2, 35.2% vs 40.0%; P = .44). In the MT
alone group, 70 patients were potentially eligible for IVT but
did not receive it intentionally. Comparing these patients with
the 75 patients treated with MT alone with a contraindication
to IVT, the authors found that the former group had better
clinical outcomes (48.6% vs 32.0%, P = .04). Finally, they
reported workflow measures showing shorter symptom onset
to groin puncture, first imaging to groin puncture, and symp-
tom onset to end of procedure in the MT alone group. A
recent study by Leker et al19 found that in patients treated
with IVT and MT, fewer stent retriever passes were required
to achieve recanalization than in patients who received MT
alone. Although this finding would be in line with the
hypothesis that IVT facilitates thrombus removal with MT,
we could not confirm this observation. In our study, no dif-
ference was found in the median number of passes between
the 2 groups.
Subgroup analyses in the Multicenter Randomized Clini-
cal Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke
in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), Endovascular Treatment for
Small Core and Proximal Occlusion Ischemic Stroke (ESCAPE),
and Endovascular Revascularization With Solitaire Device Ver-
sus Best Medical Therapy in Anterior Circulation Stroke Within
8 Hours (REVASCAT) did not suggest statistical heteroge-
neity of the effect of MT between patients who did or did not
receive IVT. Interestingly, in ESCAPE, MT was associated with
an increase in mortality at 90 days in patients who did not re-
ceive IVT (20% vs 13%), whereas among patients who re-
ceived IVT (as well as in the study as a whole), MT resulted in
a decrease in mortality (7% vs 21%).3 For MR CLEAN, an analy-
sis of mortality stratified by IVT status has not been pub-
lished to date. In REVASCAT, the effect size of MT was slightly
higher in patients not treated with IVT but without statistical
heterogeneity.5 The subgroup analyses in these studies, how-
ever, were restricted by a small sample size: only 30 patients
(13%) in MR CLEAN, 45 patients (27%) in ESCAPE, and 33 pa-
tients (32%) in REVASCAT underwent MT without IVT. The

subgroup analyses were also not adjusted for case mix. The ad-
ditional value of IVT could not be examined in the Extending
theTimeforThrombolysisinEmergencyNeurologicalDeficits–
Intra-arterial (EXTEND-IA) and Solitaire FR With the Inten-
tion for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment
for Acute Ischemic Stroke (SWIFT PRIME) because treatment
with IVT was mandatory for inclusion in these trials. In a re-
cent published pooled analysis of MR CLEAN, SWIFT PRIME,
EXTEND-IA, ESCAPE, and REVASCAT (Highly Effective Rep-
erfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke collabo-
ration), no differences were found in clinical outcomes be-
tween IVT and MT and MT alone.6
One of the main reasons to use IVT in patients with a proxi-
malocclusionisthatitmayleadtoearlyrecanalization,thereby
negating the requirement for MT. However, data from recent
trials suggest that such early recanalization does not occur of-
ten. In ESCAPE, only 8 of 165 patients (4.8%) randomized to
MT had TICI 2b or 3 on the first angiography run.3 These data
were not stratified to IVT status, but even if all 8 patients were
in the group that received IVT, the proportion of patients with
early reperfusion would still be only 6.7%. Similar results were
seen in MR CLEAN, where recanalization was found in 8 (3.7%)
of 216 patients who underwent catheter angiography.2 Eight
other patients randomized to MT did not undergo catheter an-
giography because of clinical improvement. Again, assuming
the artery had recanalized in all these patients, the propor-
tion of patients with early reperfusion would still be less than
7%. Similar percentages of early reperfusion were observed
in REVASCAT and SWIFT PRIME.4,5 The chance of early
recanalization in response to IVT is dependent on the loca-
tion of the occlusion, with distal ICA occlusions responding
poorly compared with M2 or M3 occlusions.20,21 The fact that
IVT often results in reperfusion of the occluded vessel over
time was nicely illustrated in the ESCAPE study. In the con-
trol group, follow-up computed tomographic angiography
was performed in 138 patients after a median period of 7
hours after symptom onset. Among those treated with IVT,
recanalization was observed in approximately one-third of
patients compared with only 7% of patients not treated with
IVT.3 However, the clinical benefit of this late reperfusion is
unknown.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the large sample size, com-
pleteness of the data, and the use of independent adjudica-
tion committees. Several limitations also warrant comment.
First, patients were not randomized for the use of IVT. Pa-
tients who underwent MT alone usually had a contraindica-
tion for IVT that may have affected their outcomes. We ad-
justedforbaselineimbalancesinthemultivariateanalyses,but
still we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confound-
ers. Second, although imaging end points were evaluated by
an independent core laboratory in each trial, these outcomes
were not centrally adjudicated across the 2 trials. Third, al-
though we did not observe any statistically significant differ-
ences between the groups for any of the outcomes, we can-
not exclude the possibility that this is attributable to the
relatively small sample size. For instance, the point estimate
of functional outcome and the rate of sICH were in favor of pa-
tients treated with MT and IVT, but the wide CIs preclude us

from drawing firm conclusions. The finding that IVT was as-
sociated with a lower risk of ICH, a somewhat counterintui-
tive observation, should especially be interpreted with cau-
tion, given the low number of patients with a sICH in either
group. Fourth, not all patients in the IVT and MT group were
treated with the same tPA dose. Approximately a quarter of
these patients received bridging-dose tPA (0.6 mg/kg), as used
in the Interventional Management of Stroke II study.22 A sen-
sitivity analysis excluding patients treated with bridging-
dosetPAessentiallyrevealedsimilarresults.Fifth,roughlyone-
third of the patients who did not received tPA did not have a
contraindication for IVT. This finding reflects the fact that lo-
cal treatment protocols in some of the participating centers al-
lowed direct treatment with MT in patients who were eligible
for treatment with IVT.
Conclusions
We observed no benefit or harm of treatment with IVT and
MT compared with MT alone in patients with AIS and a proxi-
mal occlusion. On the basis of these data, we believe that a
randomized clinical trial directly comparing both strategies is
warranted.
