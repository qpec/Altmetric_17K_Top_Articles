Background: Exercise is safe and beneficial for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Functional electrical 
stimulation (FES) cycling offers people with significant weakness and mobility challenges an option for 
exercise. We sought to evaluate the safety of FES cycling and its potential to improve fatigue, pain, spastic-
ity, and quality of life in people with moderate-to-severe MS.
Methods: Sixteen participants with MS who were nonambulatory cycled for 30 minutes two to three times 
a week for 1 month. Outcomes assessed included MS Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI) subscales, Modi-
fied Ashworth Scale (MAS), and manual muscle test (MMT).
Results: Fourteen participants (six women and eight men) with MS completed the training. All were able 
to maintain or increase their cycle time; half increased the resistance while cycling. Participants demon-
strated a significant decrease in the Physical (P = .02) and Psychosocial (P < .01) subscales of the Modified 
Fatigue Impact Scale. There was no significant change in the other MSQLI subscale scores. There was no 
change in MAS and MMT scores. Type of MS and the use of antispasticity medications, disease-modifying 
therapies, or dalfampridine did not seem to influence response to training. There were no adverse events.
Conclusions: Functional electrical stimulation cycling may be a viable and effective exercise option for 
people with moderate-to-severe MS. Further study is required to examine the parameters of FES cycling 
that are most effective for people with different MS symptoms and to fully explore the potential benefits of 
optimizing function and improving health in people with MS. Int J MS Care. 2017;19:113–121.
P
eople with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are non-
ambulatory are at the greatest risk of reduced 
physical activity levels.1-4 Low levels of physi-
cal activity can lead to other health conditions, such 
as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes,5-7 that 
will only further impair mobility and function in indi-
viduals who use wheeled mobility. Structured exercise is 
one way to increase physical activity; however, exercise 
options for people who use wheeled mobility are limited.
Functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling pro-
vides an avenue for exercise in people with lower-limb 
weakness and mobility restrictions.8-19 Using surface 
electrical stimulation to muscles of the lower extremi-
ties, the FES cycle can provide for passive, active with 
volitional control, or FES-assisted cycling. The newest 
FES devices allow the individual to remain seated in a 
supported position in front of the cycle ergometer, mini-
mizing the need for wheelchair transfers.

based on impairment and safety. Participants had to be 
unable to ambulate more than 70 feet and not ambu-
lating outside the home. Individuals were excluded if 
they had experienced a diagnosed relapse in the past 6 
months; had known cardiovascular disease (ie, previous 
myocardial infarct, unstable angina, congestive heart 
failure, history of arrhythmia, or stroke) or uncontrolled 
hypertension; had a history of epileptic seizures; had 
lower motor neuron disease or peripheral neuropathy in 
the lower limb; had an existing pacemaker, defibrillator, 
or other implanted electronic or metallic device (other 
than a baclofen pump); had unstable long bone frac-
tures of the lower limb or trunk; had allergy to surface 
electrodes or conductive gel; or were unable to tolerate 
sitting for at least 1 hour. These exclusion criteria were 
verified using medical records and through physician 
clearance for participation. Each physician reviewed the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria before providing medical 
clearance. Participants were also excluded if the investi-
gators could not elicit a contraction from the quadriceps 
or hamstring muscles during prescreening. Each par-
ticipant underwent testing to determine whether his or 
her muscles would respond to the electrical stimulation 
provided by the FES cycle. If there was at least a visible 
muscle contraction, the individual was enrolled; if not, 
the individual was not enrolled in the study.
Procedures
All the study procedures were performed in an out-
patient clinical space of a nonprofit long-term acute-care 
facility. All the assessments were performed by a trained 
physical therapist (CM), and training on the FES cycle 
was overseen by an exercise specialist (LH, BB).
Apparatus
The FES cycle training was performed on the RT300 
developed by Restorative Therapies, Inc (Baltimore, 
MD) (Figure 1). The RT300 is a standalone device 
designed for easy access by individuals with mobility 
limitations. Participants remained in their wheelchair 
and positioned themselves in front of the ergometer to 
cycle. A trained exercise specialist assisted each par-
ticipant in applying the surface electrodes and safely 
positioning the participant’s lower limbs on the pedals. 
Once set up, participants were able to cycle indepen-
dently, with assistance from the electrical stimulation as 
needed.
cord injury have demonstrated improvements in exer-
cise capacity,8-10 muscle mass11,12 and strength,13-15 and 
spasticity.15,16 People with moderate-to-severe MS, who 
have weakness or paralysis in their lower extremities, 
may benefit in similar ways. Four recent studies have 
explored the potential of FES cycling in people with 
MS.17-20 Ratchford et al.19 reported that participants 
who were ambulatory and trained three times a week 
for 6 months on the FES cycle demonstrated improve-
ments in strength of stimulated muscles and in walking 
endurance and speed. Physical and mental health scores 
and quality of life also improved. These findings sug-
gest that FES cycling is safe for people with MS who 
have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores 
less than 6.5 and may provide some benefit for people 
who have ambulatory capacity. Those with moderate-to-
severe MS, with EDSS scores of 6.5 or greater, may also 
benefit from FES cycling but have not been adequately 
studied. The three studies that included people with 
EDSS scores greater than 6.5, one of which was a single 
case study, demonstrated that FES cycling in this popu-
lation with more severe MS is safe (ie, they report no 
adverse events), but they did not explore the effect on 
impairments and function.17,18,20 In addition, Szecsi et 
al.18 used a 2-week intervention, so it is unclear what the 
impact would be of a longer intervention on people with 
moderate-to-severe MS.
The goals of this study were to evaluate the safety of 
an FES cycle training program and to determine wheth-
er people with severe weakness or paralysis due to MS 
can improve performance on the FES cycle, indicating 
an ability to improve leg function. In addition, we evalu-
ated the potential for FES cycling to improve symptoms 
of MS, including fatigue, spasticity, and pain, as well as 
quality of life.
Methods
Participants
All the study procedures were approved by the 
Shepherd Center research review board, and all the 
participants provided written informed consent before 
proceeding with study activities. Participants were 
recruited from the local MS program and community 
via word of mouth and online. To be included in this 
study, individuals had to be older than 18 years with 
physician-diagnosed MS and cleared by a physician to 
participate in the study activities. We did not establish 
an upper age limit for this study because inclusion was

with electrical stimulation) phase, during which the 
electrical stimulation ramped on to stimulate the mus-
cles to assist active cycling. The session then ended with 
a 2-minute cool-down of passive cycling.
The goal of each active phase was to achieve a sus-
tained pedal rate of 35 to 50 rpm for 30 minutes. The 
trainer instructed each participant at the beginning of 
each session and encouraged him or her throughout the 
session to maintain the target speed for the duration of 
the session. If a participant could not maintain at least 
35 rpm, even with electrical stimulation, the stimulation 
automatically turned off and the FES cycle went into 
passive mode whereby the motor of the ergometer con-
tinued to cycle the legs for a full 30-minute session. This 
was done based on the assumption that if the muscle 
could no longer respond adequately to electrical stimula-
tion, it was fatigued and, therefore, should no longer be 
stimulated. However, we wanted to continue the session 
with the passive cycling for a full 30 minutes of cycling. 
Once a participant could pedal for 30 minutes at 35 to 
50 rpm for three consecutive sessions without default-
ing to the passive mode (no active movement with or 
without stimulation), resistance was added. Resistance 
was increased in 0.14-Nm increments, and the process 
was repeated. Each participant progressed at his or her 
own rate and was monitored for reports of fatigue, pain, 
and spasticity during and after each session.
Participants were questioned before the start of each 
FES cycle training session regarding their experience 
after the previous training session and again immediately 
after the training session to determine whether they had 
any significant pain or fatigue or limitations in function 
due to the cycling. Participants were also monitored 
throughout each training session.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was safety measured 
by adverse events and any increase in symptoms that 
remained or worsened between sessions. An adverse 
event was defined as any increase in MS-related symp-
toms or injury deemed related to the training session. 
The exercise specialist (trainer) overseeing each FES 
cycle training session documented participant self-report 
of fatigue, pain, and spasticity at the beginning and end 
of each session using a Likert scale for each assessment (0 
being no perception of the symptom and 10 being severe 
perception of the symptom). The trainer also monitored 
participant symptoms throughout the session, frequently 
asking the participant how he or she was feeling and 
FES Cycle Training Protocol
Participants trained three times a week for 4 weeks, 
for a total of 12 sessions. Four weeks was chosen based 
on the assumption that this was long enough to test the 
safety of FES cycling and that if the participant had the 
capacity for any change in performance or function, this 
should be evident in this period. This duration was not 
expected to elicit the greatest change possible but rather 
information that would be useful for future, larger-scale 
studies. The stimulation parameters for this study were 
predetermined based on previous studies of FES cycling 
in people with complete spinal cord injury and were set 
at a pulse width of 200 µs21 and a frequency of 50 Hz.22 
We used surface electrodes to stimulate the participants’ 
quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles. The stimu-
lation intensity varied based on the participant’s toler-
ance and the amount of stimulation required to achieve 
the target cycling speed of 35 to 50 rpm.21,22
Each session began with a 2-minute warm-up of pas-
sive cycling at 35 rpm (no voluntary cycling or electri-
cal stimulation). During this phase, the motor of the 
ergometer propelled the pedals. This passive phase was 
followed by a 30-minute active (voluntary or assisted

Effect size indicates the standardized difference 
between two dependent means and expresses this rela-
tionship in standard deviation (SD) units. We deter-
mined the effect size using Cohen’s d formula for depen-
dent, single-group, pre-post change.27 The formula takes 
the difference between pretest and posttest means for the 
group and divides it by the baseline variance. Baseline 
variance is the SD for the first period (pre) of measure-
ment. Effect size (Cohen’s d) for dependent means 
differences (matched pairs t tests) is calculated by the fol-
lowing equation27:
Cohen’s d = Paired Differences Mean / Baseline SD
To determine the effect size for change in resistance 
on the FES cycle, Cohen’s d was modified because the 
baseline variance (SD) is zero. Therefore, the paired 
difference SD was used to calculate effect size. Using 
Cohen’s d, 0.2 is considered a small effect size, 0.5 a 
medium effect size, and 0.8 a large effect size.27
Results
Participant Characteristics
Fourteen participants (seven women) completed 
training for this study. Participant demographic charac-
teristics are presented in Table 1. The mean ± SD age 
was 55.28 ± 10.98 years (range, 31–70 years), and the 
mean ± SD approximate time since diagnosis was 15.29 
± 7.35 years (range, 3–28 years). Five participants were 
not receiving any disease-modifying therapy, and three 
were receiving natalizumab, four interferon beta-1a, and 
two dimethyl fumarate. Nine participants (64%) had 
progressive MS, and two of these were physician diag-
nosed as having primary progressive MS (PPMS).
No adverse events or observed increases in MS-related 
symptoms (ie, fatigue, pain, or spasticity) were expe-
rienced by participants within or between sessions for 
this study. All the participants demonstrated improved 
performance on the FES cycle, either by increasing the 
amount of time cycling or by increasing the amount of 
resistance provided during the session, suggesting that 
there were no detrimental effects of the training.
FES Cycling Performance
All the participants required at least minimal electrical 
stimulation during the active cycling time. The mean ± 
SD percentage of improvement in performance, as mea-
sured by resistance and time during the active phase on 
the FES cycle, was 84% ± 85% (range, 0.21%–356%). 
One participant demonstrated a less than 1% change 
between pretest and posttest. When this person is 
whether there was any increase in symptoms; if there 
was any indication of a problem, this was documented 
in the participant records for that day. Participants were 
specifically questioned at the beginning and end of each 
session regarding any changes in impairment or func-
tional abilities that may have occurred between the two 
training sessions.
As a measure of ability to improve during training, 
data related to FES cycling performance were col-
lected offline for each training session and included the 
amount of time spent in active cycling, the amount of 
resistance (if applied), and the distance cycled. All the 
following measures have been used in people with MS, 
are validated for use in the MS population, and were 
collected before training (pretest) and within 1 week 
after the completion of training (posttest).
After the participant provided informed consent, 
the study coordinator administered the MS Quality of 
Life Index (MSQLI)23,24 to assess quality of life. The 
MSQLI is an MS-specific health-related quality of 
life instrument consisting of the 36-item Short Form 
Health Status Survey (SF-36) supplemented by nine 
symptom-specific measures: fatigue, pain, bladder func-
tion, bowel function, emotional status, perceived cogni-
tive function, visual function, sexual satisfaction, and 
social relationships.
During the next testing session, on a separate day, a 
trained physical therapist performed measures of spastic-
ity and strength in the lower limbs. The Modified Ash-
worth Scale (MAS)25 was performed first to assess spas-
ticity. Bilateral hip flexors, knee flexors and extensors, 
and ankle dorsiflexors were graded separately, and a 
total score for each limb was obtained. A manual muscle 
test26 was then performed to assess strength; a grade of 
0 to 5 was assigned to each lower-limb muscle. A total 
score was computed for each leg for data analysis.
Data Analysis
All the data were entered into a database for analy-
ses. Descriptive analyses were performed to determine 
means, change scores, and percentage change using a 
statistical software program (IBM SPSS Statistics version 
22 for Windows; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Paired two-
tailed t tests were used to compare the pretraining and 
posttraining effects of FES cycling, that is, for time, dis-
tance, speed, and power output. Statistical significance 
was set at P < .05. No corrections for multiple com-
parisons were made because this was a pilot study and 
exploratory in nature.

FES Cycling for People with MS Who Are Nonambulatory
(Cohen’s d = 0.77). One participant increased his time 
cycling by only 0.21%; however, the remainder of the 
group ranged from 33.88% to 356.48% improvement 
after 4 weeks of FES cycle training. All but one of these 
participants were also able to increase their average 
power output from pretraining to posttraining, and 
this was of medium magnitude (Cohen’s d = 0.63). 
However, this change was not significant (P = .07). 
Both the least amount (0.21%) and the greatest amount 
(356.48%) of improvement were seen in individuals 
diagnosed as having PPMS. The participant with the 
least amount of improvement had been diagnosed as 
having MS approximately 28 years ago (the longest of 
removed from the group, the mean ± SD percentage 
of improvement is 95% ± 87% (range, 23%–356%). 
Twelve participants (86%) significantly increased their 
mean ± SD power output from pretest (2.10 ± 1.01) 
to posttest (3.17 ± 1.97) (P = .01), and this was a large 
effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.06).
Half of the group (n = 7) was not able to cycle for 
30 minutes during the active phase, either voluntarily 
or with FES. Of these participants, six were men, and 
all seven had some form of progressive MS (two had 
PPMS). Table 2 shows that all seven of these partici-
pants significantly increased their active cycling time (P 
= .04), and this improvement was large in magnitude

of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (Table 5). The 
magnitude of this change ranged from small to large 
(Cohen’s d = 0.31–0.74), with the largest effect size for 
the Psychosocial subscale (Cohen’s d = 0.74).
Seven of the 13 participants (54%) who completed 
the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Pain Effects Scale 
reported a decrease in pain after completion of the 4 
weeks of FES cycle training. The group MOS Pain 
Effects Scale mean ± SD total score decreased from 
14.62 ± 5.56 to 11.54 ± 4.63 after training, and this 
change was not significant (P = .08), with a medium 
effect size (Cohen’s d = −0.55).
There was no significant change in the Mental Health 
Inventory (MHI) score after training (P = .18), but there 
was a significant change in the Positive Affect subscale 
score of the MHI (P < .01). Most participants (79%) 
reported a decrease in their Positive Affect score.
The only significant and meaningful change in the 
SF-36 was in the Social subscale (P < .01; Cohen’s d 
= 0.90), and 11 participants (79%) demonstrated an 
improvement in this subscale score (Table 6).
There was no change in scores on the Sexual Satisfac-
tion Scale, Bladder Control Scale, Bowel Control Scale, 
Impact of Visual Impairment Scale, Perceived Deficits 
Questionnaire, and MOS Modified Social Support Sur-
vey of the MSQLI.
Discussion
This study extends earlier findings that FES cycling 
is a safe intervention for people with MS, including 
those with moderate-to-severe MS, who are generally 
nonambulatory. In addition, we found that people who 
are nonambulatory not only are able to exercise but 
all participants), whereas the participant with the most 
improvement had been diagnosed 23 years ago (the sec-
ond longest of all participants).
The other half of the group (n = 7) could actively 
cycle 30 minutes by the end of the second training ses-
sion. Six of these participants (86%) were women, and 
five (71%) had relapsing-remitting MS. Table 3 shows 
that this group significantly increased resistance during 
cycling (P < .01) between pretest and posttest, ranging 
from 23.40% to 82.00% improvement, and this change 
was of large magnitude (Cohen’s d = 2.53). A Cohen’s d 
greater than 2 indicates a difference between means that 
is greater than 2 SD. All but one of the participants were 
able to increase their power over the course of training, 
and this change was of a large magnitude (Cohen’s d = 
5.25). This change was not significant (P = .06). The 
least and greatest amounts of improvement (ie, change 
in resistance) were seen in participants with relapsing-
remitting MS. The greatest amount of improvement 
was found in the participant diagnosed as having MS 
only 3 years ago (the shortest time since diagnosis of all 
14 study participants). The participant with the least 
amount of improvement was diagnosed 13 years ago.
Impairment Outcomes
There was no significant increase or decrease in mus-
cle strength or spasticity in either lower limb as indicated 
by manual muscle test (left P = .68, right P = .30) and 
MAS (left P = .11, right P = .79) scores (Table 4). Ten 
of 14 participants (71%) demonstrated a nonsignificant 
decrease in the total Modified Fatigue Impact Scale 
(fatigue) scores from 30.79 ± 12.97 to 25.43 ± 14.11 (P 
= .07). However, there was a significant decrease in the 
Physical (P = .02) and Psychosocial (P < .01) subscales

FES Cycling for People with MS Who Are Nonambulatory
was different from those in the present study. However, 
similar to Szecsi et al.,18 the present participants who 
had spasticity reported decreased spasticity on the Likert 
scale immediately after the FES cycling session.
Also similar to Szecsi et al.,18 we did not find sig-
nificant changes in muscle strength in any of the muscles 
stimulated in the participants, whereas Ratchford et 
al.19 reported an increase in strength of the muscles 
stimulated in their study. This may be because par-
ticipants in the study by Ratchford et al.19 had less dis-
ability than those in the present study and may have 
had more capacity for improvements in muscle strength 
with this type of training than did those in the present 
study. Furthermore, the participants in the study by 
Ratchford et al. cycled for 1 hour each session, on aver-
age 3.8 times a week for 6 months, receiving a much 
greater dosage of FES cycling than those in the present 
study. Finally, limitations related to the manual muscle 
also may demonstrate training effects as noted through 
improvements in the ability to cycle. Finally, this was 
the first study to demonstrate that people with moder-
ate-to-severe MS who are nonambulatory can achieve 
physical benefit from exercise with the FES cycle, as well 
as improved quality of life.
Ratchford et al.19 found that FES cycling is safe for 
people with EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5 based on the lack 
of negative effects in cerebrospinal fluid cytokine mark-
ers and no reports of serious adverse events. Although 
we did not collect data related to cytokine markers, the 
present data extend these findings by including people 
who were nonambulatory and support the earlier find-
ings related to safety in these people with moderate-to-
severe MS.
Also of interest is the fact that some people could 
cycle for only a short duration, whereas others were able 
to cycle for the full 30-minute protocol and increase in 
resistance over the duration of training. This demon-
strates the variability between individuals. Further study 
is required to determine which parameters will work for 
each specific individual to optimize outcomes.
Although participants progressed in their ability to 
cycle on the FES cycle, they did not demonstrate a mea-
surable change in spasticity via the MAS after 4 weeks 
of training. This is different from what is reported by 
Krause et al.,17 who reported that the participant in their 
case study experienced decreased spasticity. Because 
that was a case study, it is possible that this individual

may have yielded different results. Given that the FES 
cycle defaults to start with 0.5 Nm of resistance, we are 
not truly clear about each participant’s starting capac-
ity. Because the study was only 4 weeks in duration, we 
also do not know participants’ full potential for change. 
Further study is required to explore the efficacy of this 
protocol in more individuals with moderate-to-severe 
MS and to compare this with other potentially effective 
protocols. We also did not have a measure of function. 
Although participants reported that they experienced 
increased ease with transfers and household ambulation, 
we did not objectively collect or measure these changes. 
The fact that there were improvements in the speed and 
quality of walking in the study by Ratchford et al.19 sug-
gests that including functional outcome measures may 
be beneficial for future studies to determine the effect 
of FES cycling on function in people with moderate-
to-severe MS. Finally, although we collected informa-
tion related to the disease-modifying therapies that the 
participants were using, the type of MS they had, their 
age, sex, and time since diagnosis, we did not control for 
these variables and did not have enough participants to 
evaluate whether they affected performance in this pro-
tocol. Future studies should explore the effect of these 
variables, as well as other medications, on FES cycle 
training.
Conclusion
Although this was a pilot study, it provides meaning-
ful information. First, FES cycling may be a safe, acces-
sible, and effective option for people with moderate-to-
severe MS who are nonambulatory. That people with 
moderate-to-severe MS demonstrate improvements in 
performance while cycling, as well as in physical symp-
toms, after only 4 weeks of intervention suggests that 
they respond favorably to this intervention. Although 
further research is warranted to fully understand the 
potential for FES cycle training to decrease disability and 
improve health outcomes, clinicians working with peo-
ple with MS should consider exploring this and other 
exercise options for their clients with moderate-to-severe 
MS who are nonambulatory. o

test may also account for the lack of change. Quantita-
tive assessment of strength would likely provide more 
insight into changes in muscle strength and should be 
considered for future studies. Further research is also 
warranted to determine whether there would be greater 
effects on muscle strength in people with moderate-to-
severe MS, as in the present study, if a greater volume 
of training was performed. The present participants did 
demonstrate improvements in power output on the FES 
cycle. Although not statistically significant, the effect was 
medium to large, suggesting that participants were able 
to improve in their output on the FES cycle. Although 
not a direct measure of muscle strength, this does dem-
onstrate the capacity for the muscle to improve in func-
tion and requires further investigation.
Improvement in the Social subscale of the SF-36 is a 
positive outcome and may be explained by the fact that 
the participants in this study are generally underserved 
and often do not receive much attention or rehabilita-
tion related to their MS. Being enrolled in the study 
alone may have induced the Hawthorne effect and 
affected their scores on this subscale.28 The decrease in 
the Positive Affect subscale score of the MHI in most 
participants is of concern. However, one explanation 
could be that participants in the present study reported 
that they did not want to discontinue their FES cycle 
training, and this discontent may have been reflected 
in the scores on the Positive Affect subscale. Further 
research is required to explore the effect of exercise on 
social and physical outcomes in people with moderate-
to-severe MS.
Although promising, findings from this study should 
be viewed with some caution given the small number of 
participants and the lack of a control group. Further-
more, given the nature of the study, we had to choose 
a protocol that may or may not have been the most 
beneficial for all people in the study. A different method 
of delivery, that is, frequency and duration of training,

• Functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycle train-
ing may be a safe and viable option for exercise 
for individuals with MS who are nonambulatory.
• Individuals with MS who are nonambulatory are
