IMPORTANCE Aggregated α-synuclein is believed to be central to the pathogenesis of
Parkinson disease (PD). PRX002/RG7935 (PRX002) is a humanized monoclonal antibody
designed to target aggregated forms of α-synuclein, thereby inhibiting neuron-to-neuron
transfer of presumed pathogenic forms of α-synuclein, potentially resulting in neuronal
protection and slowing disease progression.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple intravenous infusions of
PRX002 in patients with idiopathic PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multiple ascending-dose trial at 8 US study centers from July 2014
to September 2016. Eligible participants were aged 40 to 80 years with mild to moderate
idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3).
INTERVENTIONS Participants were enrolled into 6 ascending-dose cohorts and randomly
assigned to receive PRX002 (0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg,
or 60 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants received 3 intravenous infusions every 4 weeks of
PRX002 or placebo and were monitored during a 24-week observational period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Safety and tolerability assessments included physical and
neurological examinations, laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events. Pharmacokinetic
parameters included maximum PRX002 concentration, area under the curve, and half-life.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Single and multiple doses of PRX002 were generally safe and
well tolerated and resulted in robust binding of peripheral α-synuclein and dose-dependent
increases of PRX002 in cerebrospinal fluid, reaching cerebrospinal fluid concentrations that
may be expected to engage extracellular aggregated α-synuclein in the brain. Findings
support the design of an ongoing phase 2 clinical study (NCT03100149).

 P
arkinson disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neuro-
logical disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor
features.1Treatmentsprimarilytargetsymptomsbutdo
not slow or halt the underlying neurodegeneration.2 Eventu-
ally, debilitating adverse effects and treatment-resistant symp-
toms emerge. Therefore, there is a profound unmet need for
disease-modifying therapies.
The cause of PD is not fully understood, but genetic, en-
vironmental, immune, and other causes contribute to its
pathogenesis.3 Pathologically, PD is typically associated with
an accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein protein in the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous sys-
tem. Some forms of soluble aggregated α-synuclein have been
proposed as a major extracellular neurotoxic species in the
pathogenesisofPD.4,5Extracellularaggregatedα-synucleinhas
been implicated in caudal-rostral propagation in the brain
(Braakstaging)6andinhost-to-grafttransferofα-synucleinpa-
thology into cells transplanted into the brains of patients with
PD.4,5,7
Preclinical studies with transgenic mice have shown that
overexpression of α-synuclein leads to the development of key
PD features, including accumulation of intracellular α-sy-
nuclein pathology and motor and cognitive deficits.8,9 Vacci-
nation (active immunization) and monoclonal antibody (pas-
sive immunotherapy) studies in α-synuclein transgenic mice
demonstrate that anti–α-synuclein antibodies with high rela-
tive affinity to the C-terminus protein region tempered neu-
ronal pathology by decreasing intracellular accumulation of
α-synuclein in cell bodies and synapses, protected against syn-
aptic loss and gliosis, and ameliorated motor and cognitive be-
havior deficits.9-12 Passive immunization with C-terminal α-sy-
nucleinantibodiesreducedintracellularα-synucleinpathology,
protected neurons, and improved behavior performance in
lentiviral13 and recombinant preformed fibril14 α-synuclein-
transmission models.
PRX002/RG7935 (PRX002) is a humanized IgG 1 mono-
clonal antibody designed to target the C-terminus of neuro-
toxic (aggregated) forms of α-synuclein. Preclinical efficacy of
the PRX002 murine homologue (9E4) has been demon-
strated using multiple in vivo and in vitro α-synucleinopathy
models; specifically, 9E4 blocked cell-to-cell transmission of
α-synuclein, reduced intracellular α-synuclein pathology, pro-
tected against synaptic loss and gliosis, and ameliorated cog-
nitiveandmotorbehaviordeficits.9,11,12,15,16Sequestration,neu-
tralization, and clearance of toxic α-synuclein species by
PRX002 is thought to halt the spreading of pathogenic α-sy-
nucleinbetweenneurons,resultinginneuronalprotectionand
potentially slowing disease progression.15 PRX002 has a sub-
stantially higher affinity/avidity for aggregated than mono-
mericformsofα-synuclein(kineticaffinityconstant[KD],0.048
nM vs 20 nM, respectively); this attribute, besides targeting
an epitope in the C-terminus of α-synuclein, was designed to
support antibody efficacy.15,17
In a single ascending-dose phase 1 study in healthy vol-
unteers, PRX002 was safe and well tolerated up to the high-
est tested dose (30 mg/kg) and resulted in dose-dependent re-
ductions in free serum α-synuclein.18 We report the results of
a multiple ascending-dose phase 1b study designed to evalu-
ate the safety and tolerability of PRX002 at doses up to 60
mg/kg in 80 participants with mild to moderate PD. Second-
ary and exploratory objectives included assessments of the
pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and
clinical efficacy of multiple intravenous infusions of PRX002.
Methods
Experimental Design
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multiple ascending-dose, phase 1b study in pa-
tients with mild to moderate PD at 8 US study centers. The for-
maltrialprotocolisavailableinSupplement1.Participantswere
enrolled sequentially into 1 of 6 escalating-dose cohorts and
were to receive a total of 3 intravenous infusions of PRX002
(0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 60
mg/kg) or placebo, administered approximately once every 28
days. Participants returned for pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic assessments until 4 weeks after final dosing and
for clinical efficacy and safety assessments until 16 weeks af-
ter final dosing (24 weeks total). The sample size of 56 active
participants was based on detecting an adverse event (AE) of
interest occurring at a true rate of 0.04 with a probability of
89.8% and detecting an AE of interest occurring at a true rate
of 0.20 with a probability of at least 99%. The study protocol
was approved by appropriately constituted institutional re-
view boards. All participants provided written informed con-
sent. The study was conducted according to International
Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines
and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participants
Key enrollment criteria included mild to moderate idiopathic
PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3) with bradykinesia plus an-
other cardinal PD sign (resting tremor or rigidity); receiving
stable (≥90 days) doses of anti-PD medication at baseline if
being treated for PD; age 40 to 80 years; body weight 45 to 110
kg; body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared) 18 to 34; postmeno-
pausal, surgically sterile, or using adequate contraception; and
Key Points
Question Is repeated administration of a monoclonal antibody
against α-synuclein (PRX002/RG7935) safe and well tolerated in
patients with Parkinson disease?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 80 patients with
Parkinson disease treated with multiple ascending doses of
PRX002/RG7935 or placebo, repeated PRX002/RG7935
treatment was generally safe and well tolerated and induced
marked reductions in free serum α-synuclein.
Meaning The results of this phase 1b trial provided important
safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic information
needed to design the ongoing phase 2 trial to assess whether
PRX002/RG7935 shows evidence of a treatment benefit during 52
weeks in patients with Parkinson disease.

Randomization
Participants in cohorts 1 through 4 were randomly assigned in
blocks of 3, each in a 2 to 1 ratio of PRX002 and placebo
(PRX002, n = 8; placebo, n = 4). Participants in cohorts 5 and
6 were randomly assigned in blocks of 4, each in a 3 to 1 ratio
of PRX002 and placebo (PRX002, n = 12; placebo, n = 4).
Within each cohort, the first block served as a sentinel group
(cohorts 1-4, n = 3; cohorts 5-6, n = 4) to assess safety and tol-
erability before the remaining participants were randomly as-
signed. Details of blinding procedures are provided in the
eMethods in Supplement 2.
Procedures
Lyophilized PRX002 was reconstituted with sterile water for
injection and prepared by a nonblinded study pharmacist in
normal saline for intravenous infusion for a mean (SD) of 60
(10)minutesforallparticipantsincohorts1through5andeither
60 (10) minutes or 120 (10) minutes for participants in cohort
6. Premedication was not required. Normal saline was used as
placebo. Dose escalation for subsequent cohorts occurred af-
ter all participants in the preceding cohort had received at least
1 dose and after review of 6 weeks’safety data from 75% of par-
ticipants from the preceding cohort. Immunogenicity was as-
sessed before and 4 weeks after each infusion. Serum PRX002
concentrations were assessed at various times before, dur-
ing, and after each infusion (eMethods in Supplement 2). Free
(unbound to PRX002) and total (free plus bound to PRX002)
serum α-synuclein concentrations were assessed before and
1 and 4 hours after each of the 3 infusions; 1 and 2 weeks after
the first and third infusions; and 4 weeks after the third infu-
sion. Free and total cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein and
CSFPRX002concentrationsweredeterminedatscreeningand
2 to 9 days after the third infusion.
Outcomes
Primary study objectives were to evaluate the safety and tol-
erabilityofmultipleintravenousinfusionsofPRX002,andsec-
ondaryobjectivesweretoassessthepharmacokineticsandim-
munogenicity of single and multiple infusions of PRX002 in
participants with PD. Exploratory objectives were to assess rel-
evant biomarkers and clinical PD progression.
Safety and tolerability were assessed in all patients who
received study drug (PRX002 or placebo) and included AEs,
laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiography, and physi-
cal and neurological examinations. Serum and CSF PRX002
weremeasuredusingaProthena-developedquantitativesand-
wich electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay.18 Serum PRX002
pharmacokinetic parameters were generated using noncom-
partmental analysis; pharmacokinetic variables are de-
scribedintheeMethodsinSupplement2.Immunogenicitywas
assessed by measuring anti–PRX002 antibodies using a quali-
tative dilution-based bridging ECL assay. Total and free α-sy-
nuclein were measured in serum and CSF using quantitative
sandwich ECL (Intertek Pharmaceutical Services), with free se-
rum α-synuclein values normalized to percentage of total α-sy-
nuclein;sampleswithhemoglobinlevelsgreaterthan0.06g/dL
were excluded from analysis because of potential peripheral
α-synuclein contamination by lysed red blood cells (to con-
vert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). Total β-amyloid (Aβ)
and Aβ42 were measured in CSF using quantitative sandwich
ECL. DJ-1 was measured in CSF using enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay.

Study Population
EightypatientswithPDwererandomlyassignedtoreceivepla-

Demographics and baseline characteristics appeared similar
across cohorts (Table 1). Median patient age was 58 years. Most
participants had Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 (72.0% placebo vs
70.9%PRX002);meantotalMDS-UPDRSscoreswere48.5(pla-
cebo) vs 47.3 (PRX002). Medical and treatment histories were
also similar; most participants across all cohorts used dopa-
minergicmedicationsbeforebaseline(96.0%placebovs80.0%
PRX002), did not have a family history of PD (84.0% placebo
vs 78.2% PRX002), and did not have a history of rapid eye
movement sleep behavioral disorder (88.0% placebo vs 72.7%
PRX002).
No significant protocol deviations occurred. One addi-
tional patient in cohort 5 was enrolled to replace a patient
who was randomly assigned but not treated. All 80 partici-
pants (25 placebo and 55 PRX002) were included in the
intent-to-treat, pharmacodynamic, and safety analyses; all
55 participants who received PRX002 were included in the
pharmacokinetic analysis.

 Safety and Immunogenicity
Multiple intravenous infusions of PRX002 (range, 0.3-60 mg/
kg) were generally safe and well tolerated; no serious or se-
vere treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported in
PRX002-treated participants. No deaths occurred during the
study. Two patients in the 60-mg/kg PRX002 group had AEs
leading to study discontinuation (days 30 and 59; both infu-
sion-related reactions [IRRs]).
Fifty-four participants (67.5%) reported TEAEs, most of
which were mild. Common TEAEs more frequent in the
PRX002 group vs placebo group, irrespective of study drug re-
latedness, were constipation, IRR, diarrhea, peripheral edema,
and postlumbar puncture syndrome (Table 2). The only
PRX002-related TEAE experienced by at least 1 participant in
any cohort was IRR, reported in 4 participants in the 60-
mg/kg PRX002 cohort. Two participants reported moderate
IRR. One occurred after the first infusion (acute allergic reac-
tion [skin rash and tongue numbness]) and the other after the
second infusion (skin rash); both events resolved with medi-
cation, and study drug was discontinued. A third participant
reported moderate IRR following the first and second infu-
sions (skin rash) that resolved with medication. This partici-
pant was premedicated for the third infusion, which was in-
creased to 120 minutes and was uneventful. A fourth
participant reported mild IRRs (dysgeusia and pruritus) with
the first infusion that spontaneously resolved; the second and
third infusions (no premedication) were uneventful.
All other PRX002-related TEAEs (mild headache, moder-
ate worsening of insomnia, mild nausea, mild diarrhea, mild
dizziness, and mild fatigue) occurred in 1 patient each and re-
solved without treatment. No clinically relevant or treatment-
related trends emerged from clinical laboratory data, physi-
cal examinations, neurological examinations, vital signs, or
electrocardiography after dosing. Exploratory clinical assess-
ments showed no clinically meaningful or dose-dependent
PRX002-related treatment differences within any treatment
cohort. DaTscan showed statistically significant (F3,31 = 2.3;
P < .05) increases in DaTscan tracer uptake from baseline to
day 71, relative to placebo, but these were not considered clini-
cally meaningful because they occurred only for the 10 mg/kg
dose group. No antidrug antibodies were detected.
Pharmacokinetics
Serum mean Cmax and mean area under the curve increased
in an approximately dose-proportional manner across the 6
dose cohorts (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The mean terminal
eliminationhalf-lifewassimilaracrossalldosecohortsandwas
approximately 10.2 days (245 hours; range, 206-282; eFigure
1 in Supplement 2). Clearance was similar across dose cohorts
and not different between the first and last (third) infusions,
with mean clearance at steady state ranging from 0.0185 to
0.0391 L/h. Volume of distribution at steady state was approxi-
matelyconsistentacrossdosegroups,withmeansrangingfrom
6.12 to 11.4 L after the third infusion. Accumulation ratios, as
measuredbyCmaxandareaundertheconcentration-timecurve
from zero to tau, suggested minimal accumulation of less than
1.5-fold on systemic exposure following the third infusion.
Mean CSF PRX002 exposure measured at approximately week
9 increased with PRX002 dose; on average, the concentra-
tion of PRX002 in CSF relative to serum was approximately
0.3% across all dose cohorts (Figure 2).
Pharmacodynamics
Infusions of PRX002 resulted in statistically significant dose-
and time-dependent reductions from baseline in free (un-
bound) serum α-synuclein (Figure 3). The greatest reductions
afterthefirstinfusionwereinthe60-mg/kgdosecohort(96.7%)

 tistically significant reductions from baseline vs placebo after
the first infusion were seen at 1 and 4 hours for all dose groups,
at days 8 and 15 for the 3- to 60-mg/kg PRX002 groups, and at
day 29 for the 3-mg/kg, and the 10- to 60-mg/kg PRX002
groups. Statistically significant reductions after the third in-
fusion were seen at 1 and 4 hours for all dose groups, at day 64
for the 1- to 60-mg/kg PRX002 groups, at day 71 for the 1-mg/kg
and the 3- to 60-mg/kg PRX002 groups, and at day 85 for the
3- to 60-mg/kg PRX002 groups. Reductions were maintained
for longer durations after higher PRX002 doses.
Increases from baseline of total (unbound plus PRX002
bound) serum α-synuclein were also dose and time depen-
dent (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). The greatest increase was
seen 1 week after the third infusion in the 60-mg/kg cohort
(leastsquaresmean,86μg/mL;increase,458%).Increaseswere
statistically significant 1 week after the first infusion for the
30- and 60-mg/kg cohorts and 4 weeks after the first infusion
for the 10-mg/kg cohort. Increases for the 30- and 60-mg/kg
cohorts remained significant until the last sampling (4 weeks
after the third infusion) except at 1 hour after the third infu-
sion for the 30-mg/kg cohort, with an upward trend in total
serum α-synuclein levels across the 3 infusions.
No statistically significant CSF changes from baseline vs
placebo were seen for free α-synuclein, total α-synuclein (ex-
cept cohort 5 [30 mg/kg PRX002]), total Aβ, Aβ42, or DJ-1 (ex-
cept cohort 3 [3 mg/kg PRX002]) across the PRX002 dose co-
horts, and no dose-dependent trends were observed.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that PRX002, an immunotherapy de-
signedtopreferentiallytargetaggregatedα-synuclein,wascapable
ofengagingperipheralα-synucleininpatientswithPD.Multiple
intravenousinfusionsofPRX002weregenerallysafeandwelltol-
erated at all dose levels up to and including 60 mg/kg intrave-
nously every 4 weeks. No deaths, serious AEs, or anti-PRX002
antibodies were noted. Marked reductions in free serum
α-synuclein levels were seen within 1 hour of PRX002 adminis-
tration after each of the 3 infusions. Dose-dependent increases
in PRX002 levels were demonstrated in serum and in CSF.
Parkinson disease treatments are aimed chiefly toward at-
tenuating motor symptoms, typically through modulating
dopamine pathways,2 but they do not address the underlying
degeneration. Several disease-modifying treatments are being
investigated in clinical trials and include but are not limited
to growth factors, gene therapy, antiapoptotic agents, im-
mune modulation, stem cell–based neuron replacement
therapy, and targeting aggregated protein.19-21

 transport and neurotransmitter release in the synaptic termi-
nals of neurons.22 Multiplications and certain point muta-
tions in SNCA, the gene encoding α-synuclein, lead to famil-
ial PD, and genome-wide association studies place SNCA as the
top genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of the disease.1 In
addition, evidence to support targeting α-synuclein as a po-
tential disease-modifying strategy in PD is derived from α-sy-
nuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies and neurites in affected
brain regions and in nerves innervating peripheral organs in
patients with PD and prodromal PD patients.23-29 Further-
more, neuropathologic staging of PD, as proposed by Braak,
points to a neuron-to-neuron propagation of α-synuclein pa-
thology between nervous system regions in patients with PD.6
Similarly, host-to-graft propagation of α-synuclein pathology
was observed post mortem in some nigral transplants.4,5 In-
jectionofrecombinantpreformedα-synucleinfibrilsintospeci-
fied brain regions in mice leads to intraneuronal aggregation
of α-synuclein and propagation of the pathology, similar to
what is observed in PD, indicating that an extracellular form
of aggregated α-synuclein may be involved in this
pathomechanism.30-35
In preclinical studies, the murine homologue of PRX002
reduced intracellular α-synuclein pathology, protected neu-
rons, and ameliorated cognitive and motor behavior deficits
in multiple mouse models of α-synucleinopathy.9,11,12,15,16 Tar-
geting toxic proteins with monoclonal antibodies is also being
evaluated as a potential therapeutic strategy in other neuro-
degenerative diseases.36-38
This study demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerabil-
ity profile and a marked reduction of free (unbound) serum
α-synucleinaftermultipledosesofPRX002.Notably,rapidand
robust reductions in free serum α-synuclein levels were
achieved without seriously affecting safety, consistent with a
previous healthy volunteer PRX002 study.18 The one PRX002-
related TEAE of note in this study was mild to moderate IRR
in 4 participants in the highest dose group, which led to study
discontinuation in 2 participants; symptoms were rash, pru-
ritus, dysgeusia, and tongue numbness. Infusion-related re-
actions are the most commonly reported AEs associated with
the administration of monoclonal antibodies.39 In studies with
other antibodies, IRR effects have been mitigated by dose frac-
tionation, lower infusion rates, and/or premedication with an-
tihistamines, acetaminophen, or corticosteroids.40 Premedi-
cation of participants for potential IRRs was not required in
this study.
Pharmacokinetic profiles were mostly similar to those in
an earlier report of single PRX002 infusions in 30 healthy vol-
unteers, with serum concentrations increasing proportion-
ally with PRX002 dose.18 The terminal half-life in this study
was somewhat shorter than that in the single-dose study in
healthy volunteers (approximately 10 days vs approximately
18 days, respectively), possibly because of the more pro-
longed assessment in the single-dose study. Population phar-
macokinetic analyses further confirmed a lack of difference in
clearancebetweenhealthyparticipants18andparticipantswith
PD. Data from this study continue to support monthly dosing
for further clinical development. In addition, the CSF/serum
antibodyratioof0.3%inthisstudywasinthehighrangeamong
studies of monoclonal antibodies targeting β-amyloidor
α-synuclein in the CNS.41,42
Reductions in free serum α-synuclein were rapid, dose
dependent, prolonged, and comparable in magnitude and
duration after the first and last doses. These findings, along
with in vitro data demonstrating a substantially higher

 avidity/affinity of PRX002 for aggregated (KD, 0.048 nM) vs
monomeric (KD, 20 nM) α-synuclein (determined by surface
plasmon resonance in kinetic mode; eFigure 3 in Supplement
2)17 and CSF penetration of PRX002, suggest that target
engagement of aggregated α-synuclein in the CNS may be
achieved.
Limitations
Limitations of this study were the small number of patients
exposed, the short exposure duration, the relatively low
demographic diversity, and the possibility that some
patients might later be found to have a disorder other than
PD. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons of
exploratory efficacy assessments. Further limitations were
the lack of validated assay to directly measure aggregated
α-synuclein CSF levels and unavailability of imaging meth-
ods to monitor intracellular α-synuclein pathology in the
brains of patients with PD. Nonetheless, the substantially
higher affinity/avidity of PRX002 for aggregated α-synuclein
forms,15,17 along with the high relative CSF concentrations
observed in this study (0.3% of blood), indicate that the anti-
body has the potential to fully engage extracellular aggre-
gated forms of α-synuclein in the CNS within the doses
tested in this study.
No effect was seen on free α-synuclein in CSF, which may
bestbeexplainedbyPRX002concentrationsintheCSF,which,
in contrast to the periphery, are not sufficiently high to en-
gage the monomeric species (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). In
addition, how much of the toxic protein must be removed to
modify disease progression is unknown. This phase 1b safety,
tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study involved 3 infusions
in a small number of participants and a short duration of ob-
servation, limiting clinical assessment of potential treatment
effects.Clinicalassessmentshelpedruleoutanysignificantun-
toward investigational drug effects. Despite the limitations,
safety and pharmacokinetics findings from this phase 1b trial
provide support for further evaluation of doses up to 60 mg/kg
in the ongoing phase 2 efficacy study of PRX002. A dose of 60
mg/kg or less is predicted to effectively engage α-synuclein in
the brain and is supported by preclinical efficacy models. The
absence of serious safety concerns in this study, the accumu-
lating scientific data in support of this approach, and the clear
unmet medical need for disease-modifying therapeutics in PD
underscore the importance of future trials.
Conclusions
Single and multiple doses of PRX002 resulted in robust bind-
ing of peripheral α-synuclein and in dose-dependent in-
creases of PRX002 in CSF and reached CSF concentrations that
may be expected to engage extracellular aggregated
α-synuclein in the brain. All tested dose levels of PRX002 had
acceptable safety and tolerability profiles, supporting the
design of an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, PASADENA
(NCT03100149).
