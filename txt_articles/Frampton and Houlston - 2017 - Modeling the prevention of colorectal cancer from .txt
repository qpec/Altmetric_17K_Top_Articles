INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant public health issue in 
developed countries.1 Despite advances in the clinical manage-
ment of CRC, 5-year patient survival is typically only approxi-
mately 55%.2 This poor prognosis and the increasing incidence 
rates seen in Western countries1 have provided strong motiva-
tion for establishing population screening programs for early 
detection of CRC.3,4 Additionally, there is increasing interest 
in developing and implementing strategies to lessen the risk 
of developing CRC. The effectiveness of screening and preven-
tion programs is likely to be optimized if directed toward those 
identified to be at highest risk for CRC. However, to date, meth-
ods for predicting the individuals in the population who are at 
increased risk and in whom targeted prevention can be directed 
have been relatively limited.
CRC has a strong heritable basis, and an increasing number 
of susceptibility loci for CRC are now being discovered through 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS).5–18 So far, these stud-
ies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 
37 loci that are robustly associated with CRC risk.19 Although 
individually these variants have only a modest impact on CRC, 
the combined effect of multiple SNPs has the potential to pro-
vide useful levels of risk stratification in the population.19–22
We have recently examined the value of genetic information 
in the context of population screening programs for the early 
detection of CRC by deriving polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 
the known CRC risk SNPs.19 However, there are several well-
established modifiable risk factors for CRC, and building pre-
dictive models incorporating both genetic and nongenetic risk 
factors should enable a more complete assessment of CRC risk. 
Importantly, such a model affords an opportunity to target risk 
modification through lifestyle change programs in addition to 
screening and chemoprevention.
Here, we examined the potential impact of genetic informa-
tion in combination with independent modifiable risk factors 
for CRC prevention by implementing a model-based analy-
sis. We also assessed the probable impact of using aspirin as 
chemo-prevention in the context of a prevention program using 
stratified CRC risk. Because CRC rates are higher in males, we 
confined our analysis to men acknowledging that similar con-
clusions are likely to also apply to women, albeit perhaps with 
less significant impact. This is due primarily to lower CRC rates 
in females, and also to lower risk attributable to the modifiable 
risk factors, thus probably providing slightly less scope for risk 
reduction via such prevention programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Calculation of polygenic risk score
We used the published allele frequencies and per-allele relative 
risk (RR) using a log-additive model of interaction between 
risk alleles (Supplementary Table S1 online) to estimate the 
parameters of the normal distribution of PRS. If Ι corresponds

Purpose: This study investigated the utility of modeling modifiable 
lifestyle risk factors in addition to genetic variation in colorectal can-
cer (CRC) screening/prevention.
Methods: We derived a polygenic risk score for CRC susceptibility 
variants in combination with the established nongenetic risk factors 
of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), adiposity, alcohol, red meat, 
fruit, vegetables, smoking, physical activity, and aspirin. We used the 
37 known risk variants and 50 and 100% of all risk variants as calcu-
lated from a heritability estimate. We derived absolute risk from UK 
population age structure, incidence, and mortality rate data.
Results: Taking into account all risk factors (known variants), 42.2% 
of 55- to 59-year-old men with CRC have a risk at least as high as that 
of an average 60-year-old, the minimum eligible age for the UK NHS 
National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. If the male population 
is stratified by known variants and IBD status, then risk-difference 
estimates imply that for 10,000 50-year-old men in the 99th percen-
tile, 760 cases could be prevented over a 25-year period through the 
modifiable risk factors, but in the lowest percentile, only 90 could be 
prevented.
Conclusion: CRC screening and prevention centered on modifiable 
risk factors could be optimized if targeted at individuals at higher 
polygenic risk.

Hence, the distribution of risk on an RR scale in the population 
is log-normal with mean μ and variance σ 
2. The distribution 
of PRS for cases is displaced to the right by σ 
2; therefore, the 
population μ can be set to −σ 
2/2 to give a mean RR in the popu-
lation of unity (PRS = 0).
To derive the minimum number of risk alleles that an 
individual requires to equal or exceed a certain PRS thresh-
old (e.g., to be in the top 1%), the alleles are first sorted into 
descending order according to the difference between the log 
OR and 0 (i.e., an RR of 1.0). If there are Ι risk alleles, j ≤ Ι, 
ri = log risk OR of ith allele (0 in the case of a protective allele), 
ni = log nonrisk OR of ith allele (negative in the case of a pro-
tective allele), and PRSthresh = PRS threshold, then the mini-

The method for deriving the maximum number is identi-
cal except that the alleles are first sorted into ascending, not 
descending, order.
There is an overrepresentation of association signals in exist-
ing GWAS after accounting for known risk SNPs, so addi-
tional risk variants should be identifiable by new GWAS. Using 
genome-wide complex trait analysis,23 we previously estimated 
the heritability of CRC for all common variation to be 19% 
(±8%),19 which translates to this class of susceptibility account-
ing for 55% of the familial risk. The inclusion of these as-yet-
unidentified risk variants in future models will inevitably 
increase the precision of PRS-based personalized risk profiling 
for CRC. To address this prospect, in addition to evaluating the 
utility of PRS based on the 37 SNPs documented to influence 
CRC risk in Europeans, we also used the genome-wide complex 
trait analysis heritability estimate to examine model predictive 
values assuming that 50 and 100% of all common risk variants 
have been identified.
To examine the extent by which polygenic risk information 
from SNP genotype can stratify CRC by itself or in combina-
tion with modifiable risk factors, we estimated the expected RR 
distribution and corresponding absolute risks of CRC by incor-
porating various sets of risk factors for the UK population. We 
assessed the discriminatory capability of all models by calculat-
ing the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver-operator 
characteristic curve.
Nongenetic risk factors
Epidemiological studies have implicated a number of non-
genetic factors as determinants of CRC risk, notably alcohol 
consumption, adiposity, red meat consumption, smoking, 
fruit and vegetable consumption, and lack of physical activity. 
Additional factors influencing CRC risk include aspirin/non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD).24 Our risk models incorporate all of these risk 
factors and use body mass index (BMI) as a measure of adipos-
ity. The nongenetic risk factors are included in a risk model in 
the same way as the risk alleles. In these summations for mean 
and variance, for a nongenetic risk factor, β is the log OR for a 
level/category and p is the proportion of the population that is 
exposed; hence, whereas a SNP contributes two terms (one for 
each allele), a nongenetic risk factor contributes n, where n is 
the number of levels/categories.
We derived ORs for each of the risk factors from recent 
meta-analyses that only considered studies of European ances-
try and that accounted for the presence of other risk factors to 
minimize any confounding.24,25 For alcohol consumption, the 
reported RR for CRC was 1.06 per five drinks per week, for 
BMI it was 1.29 per 8-kg/m2 increase over normal/low BMI 
 
(i.e., ≤25 kg/m2), for red meat consumption it was 1.12 for 
five servings per week compared to none, for fruit consump-
tion it was 0.84 for three servings per day compared to none, 
for vegetable consumption it was 0.86 for five servings per day 
compared to none, for physical activity it was 0.88 for a twofold 
increase in the standardized score, and for IBD (ulcerative coli-
tis and/or Crohn disease) it was a 2.93-fold increase compared 
to not having IBD. The risk of CRC for ever-smokers is reported 
to be 1.18 when compared to never-smokers.25
The reported prevalence of IBD in the United Kingdom 
is 4 out of 10,000 of the population in recent surveys.26 The 
exposure levels in the general population for alcohol, BMI, 
red meat, fruit, vegetables, physical activity, and smoking 
were drawn from the most recent available year in the Health 
Survey for England (HSE),27,28 which was 2008 for red meat 
consumption and 2013 for other risk factors (Supplementary 
Materials and Methods online). Incorporating each fac-
tor into our model required the degree of exposure in the 
general population to align with the risk factor levels in the 
meta-analysis. This was true for smoking, but not for the oth-
ers; therefore, we fitted continuous probability distributions 
to the censored HSE data using the R package fitdistrplus. 
A normal distribution was appropriate for BMI but not 
for the other risk factors, which have right-tailed distribu-
tions. For these, we fitted gamma distributions because they 
provided a superior fit compared to alternatives (exponen-
tial, log-normal, log-logistic, Weibull and Gumbell) when 
assessed by Bayesian information criterion, Akaike infor-
mation criterion, or log likelihood. For physical activity, 
we used the parameters of its fitted gamma distribution to 
calculate standard scores. When the data included a 0 inter-
val (e.g., individuals who consume no alcohol), it was neces-
sary to apply distribution shifting to fit certain distributions.

Hence, a small increment was made to the left and right ends 
of each interval prior to fitting, which was then subtracted 
postfitting.
Obtaining reliable data on aspirin usage in the general popu-
lation in England is inherently problematic because the HSE 
contains data on prescribed usage but not all usage. Therefore, 
for the purposes of this modeling exercise, we made use of 
data from a large US cohort study29 that examined associations 
between long-term (≥5 years) daily use of adult-strength aspi-
rin (≥325 mg/day) and incidence of 10 cancers in 69,810 men 
within the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. At 
enrollment, 2.3% of men reported long-term daily usage, which 
increased to 4.6% during the follow-up period. After adjust-
ment for other risk factors, long-term daily aspirin use was 
associated with a significant 32% reduction in CRC (RR = 0.68; 
95% CI, 0.52–0.90).
Therefore, we initially developed six PRS-based risk models: 
model 1, based on the known risk SNPs; model 2, based on the 
known risk SNPs plus IBD and the modifiable risk factors of 
alcohol consumption, BMI, red meat consumption, smoking, 
consumption of fruits and vegetables, physical activity, and 
aspirin usage; models 3 and 4, which are equivalent to models 1 
and 2 but assume half of all risk variants are known; and mod-
els 5 and 6, which are again equivalent to models 1 and 2 but 
assume all risk variants are known.
We also used risk models that incorporate only the host risk 
factors of known risk SNPs and IBD to investigate the utility of 
polygenic risk in targeting CRC prevention programs that are 
centered on the modifiable risk factors. In such a risk model, 
every individual is effectively assigned average risk attributable 
to the modifiable risk factors (RR = 1.0). The risk score for an 
individual in the Xth percentile, RSX, with a healthy (unhealthy) 
lifestyle can be calculated by adding the difference between the 
average and minimum (maximum) risk score attributable to 
the modifiable risk factors. If there are a total of Ι levels/cat-
egories of modifiable risk factors, then RSmodav, RSmodmin, and 
RSmodmax, the average, minimum, and maximum risk scores for 
the modifiable risk factors, are:

Calculation of absolute CRC risks
We obtained incident CRC registrations, deaths from CRC and 
all causes, and mid-year population estimates in 1-year age 
bands for England (2001–2012) from the Office for National 
Statistics. Averaging incidence and mortality rates for this 
period, we used DevCan 6.4.1 software24 to derive the baseline 
age-conditional absolute risk of CRC. From this and RR esti-
mates, we derived the age-conditional absolute CRC risk for 
individuals.
RESULTS
Utility of polygenic risk in colorectal cancer risk 
stratification
The 37 currently identified susceptibility variants for CRC 
confer a polygenic variance of 0.21 and account for approxi-
mately 14.5% of the familial risk of CRC. Figure 1a shows the 
PRS for CRC based only on the known risk SNPs (model 1). 
Here, individuals in the top 10% of CRC risk have a 1.8-fold 
higher risk of CRC compared to the population median, and 
those within the top 1% (i.e., 27–54 risk alleles) have a 2.9-
fold increased risk. Figure 1b shows risk after inclusion of 
IBD and the modifiable lifestyle risk factors (model 2). Now, 
individuals within the top 10% and 1% show a 1.9-fold and 
3.2-fold increased risk, respectively. Similarly, when using 
model 4 instead of model 3 (Figure 1c,d), RR increases from 
2.2 to 2.3 for the top 10%, and from 4.2 to 4.5 for the top 1%. 
When using model 6 instead of model 5 (Figure 1e,f), RR 
increases from 3.1 to 3.2 for the top 10%, and from 7.7 to 8.1 
for the top 1%.
Table 1 shows the receiver-operator characteristic AUC met-
ric for each of the six models. Inclusion of IBD and the modifi-
able risk factors leads to a small increase from 0.63 to 0.64 when 
using known risk SNPs (models 1 and 2), from 0.67 to 0.68 
when assuming half of risk SNPs are known (models 3 and 4), 
and from 0.73 to 0.74 when assuming all risk SNPs are known 
(models 5 and 6).
Individuals are eligible for the UK NHS national bowel can-
cer screening program at age 60 (ref. 3). The effectiveness of 
such screening and prevention programs will be improved 
if targeted toward individuals who are at the highest risk for 
CRC, including younger individuals at high risk. In England 
during the period from 2001 to 2012 inclusive, an average of

1,401,447 of the male population was aged 55–59 and 1,264 
were diagnosed with CRC. Table 1 shows the percentage of this 
population for which the six models identify as being at higher 
risk for CRC. For the purposes of this comparison, higher risk 
is defined as a 10-year absolute risk of developing CRC greater 
than or equal to that of an average 60-year-old man, which is 
1.96%. Table 1 shows the six models identifying approximately 
22 to 24% of the population as being at higher risk. Inclusion of 
IBD and the modifiable risk factors increases the percentage of 
cases identified as being at higher risk, for example, from 40.1 
to 42.2% when using the known risk SNPs (models 1 and 2). 
Model 6 identifies 57.7% of cases as higher risk.

Utility of polygenic risk in targeting colorectal cancer 
prevention
In Figure 2, we considered men in the 10th, 50th, and 90th per-
centiles of a risk model defined by the host risk factors of com-
mon genetic variation and IBD and their 10-year risk of CRC 
according to modifiable risk factor status. The bounds were 
calculated using the most extreme levels of the modifiable risk 
factors that have nonzero counts in our data sources. This fig-
ure shows that the 10-year risk of CRC can vary substantially 
depending on the number of modifiable lifestyle risk factors. For 
example, a 60-year-old man in the 90th percentile of risk accord-
ing to genetics (known risk SNPs) with IBD can have a 10-year 
risk ranging from 1 to 11%. Figure 2 also shows that, depending 
on lifestyle, it is possible for an individual in the 90th percentile 
to have a lower risk than average and for an individual in the 10th 
percentile to have a higher risk than average.
Table 2 shows the 25-year risk of developing CRC for a 
50-year-old man in England, where the population is again 
stratified by the host risk factors. We chose to base calcula-
tions on the 25-year risk because the UK Scottish bowel cancer 
screening program is open to those aged 50–74 (ref. 4). Table 2 
shows the estimated risk reductions achieved by minimizing 
risk attributable to the modifiable risk factors (i.e., by setting 
the modifiable risk factor levels to those used in calculating 
the lower bounds in Figure 2). These risk-difference estimates 
imply that prevention programs involving the modifiable risk 
factors could be optimized if targeted at individuals who are at 
higher risk according to the host risk factors. For example, the 
risk-difference estimates in Table 2 indicate that if 10,000 men 
in the lowest and highest percentiles undertook long-term aspi-
rin usage, then 40 and 340 cases of CRC, respectively, would 
be prevented over a 25-year period. If they did not undertake 
long-term aspirin usage but minimized risk with respect to the 
other modifiable risk factors, then 70 and 610 cases of CRC 
would be prevented. If they undertook long-term aspirin usage 
as well, then 90 and 760 cases would be prevented. Assuming 
half of risk SNPs are known, if all 10,000 men in the lowest and 
highest percentiles minimized risk with respect to all modifi-
able risk factors (including undertaking long-term aspirin use), 
then 60 and 1,090 cases, respectively, would be prevented. If 
all risk SNPs are known, then the number of cases prevented 
would be 30 and 1,980, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Our findings serve to illustrate how information on poly-
genic risk, in conjunction with modifiable risk factors, might 
be used in primary prevention to identify subgroups of the 
population at increased risk for CRC and who are most likely 
to benefit from advice or intervention. Conventionally, the 
discriminatory accuracy of risk prediction models is assessed 
using receiver-operator characteristic curves. However, the 
AUC depends solely on the RR parameter and, as is the case 
here, when the baseline risk is high even a modest increase in 
AUC has the potential to substantially enhance risk stratifica-
tion of the population.
Here, we have not incorporated family history information 
on CRC because there is potential for recall bias and inaccu-
racy in the reporting of family history.23,30 Notably, surveys 
have often reported that CRC in relatives can be significantly

genetic testing directly addresses such shortcomings.
Although our analysis supports the tenet that the integration 
of genetic and nongenetic risk factor information can provide 
meaningful risk stratification, we acknowledge that there are a 
number of limitations to our model-based analysis. First, we 
relied on published RR estimates from a large meta-analysis 
and population-based distributions. Second, our analysis also 
relied on the key assumption that genetic and lifestyle risks 
act multiplicatively. Additionally, we assumed that the impact 
of a chemoprevention agent or improvement in lifestyle on 
CRC risk will be uniform across genotypes. Within the genetic

FRAMPTON and HOULSTON  |  Modeling the prevention of colorectal cancer from host and behavioral risk factors
Original research article
component, few interactions of risk between genetic loci have 
been identified, so the assumption of independence is appro-
priate. For lifestyle risk factors, assumptions of independence 
are more problematic. Although we made use of RRs for each 
factor estimated in the presence of relevant covariates, levels of 
risk inflation can still be an issue if there are inaccuracies in 
the estimated population frequencies. Third, although there is 
currently little evidence for gene–environment interactions in 
CRC, further studies are required to evaluate this empirically 
and, if appropriate, estimate absolute risks for combinations of 
risk factors and interventions. However, very large studies are 
required to address this challenge because of the inevitable rela-
tive paucity of key data at extremes. Finally, the assessment of 
the performance of any model to provide predictions of risk 
needs to be calibrated in prospective cohort studies.
Accepting these caveats, a number of conclusions can be 
gleaned from our analysis, notably that modifying lifestyle risk 
factors would lead to significant changes in the proportion of 
the population at risk for CRC. Although this could have been 
predicted a priori by the higher ORs for these factors, it is the 
combination of RR together with the prevalence of the fac-
tor within the population that determines the overall impact. 
Population screening programs for the early detection of CRC 
are widespread.3,4 In contrast, there is currently a low profile 
for strategies targeting lifestyle factors in those at highest risk, 
which is particularly relevant for younger age groups. Such an 
approach could potentially encourage behavioral changes and 
help to significantly reduce CRC rates. This is especially impor-
tant because over recent decades the lifetime risk of CRC has 
increased,1 owing to a change in the dietary and lifestyle fac-
tors of the general population, which is characterized by higher 
levels of obesity and more sedentary pastimes.31 However, 
research is required to determine how individuals might actu-
ally respond to risk assessment based on genetic information.
Although modeling indicates that certain individuals will 
reduce their CRC risk by changing their behavior, the time needed 
for changes in environmental risk factors to have an effect on risk 
is unknown, is likely to differ for each factor, and is something 
only able to be determined prospectively. Important research is 
needed to further elucidate the genetic and environmental contri-
butions to risk and to measure the long-term impact of behavioral 
change on CRC outcomes. Finally, if profiling and risk stratifica-
tion are to be adopted in public health, then prediction tools are 
needed that are easy to use by health-care professionals.
