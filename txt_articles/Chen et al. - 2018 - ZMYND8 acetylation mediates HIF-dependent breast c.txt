Introduction
Metastasis is a major clinical obstacle to curative cancer therapy 
and is responsible for about 90% of breast cancer–related deaths 
in women. The development of a benign and nonmalignant duc-
tal carcinoma in situ to the advanced and metastatic breast can-
cer requires many dysregulated oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes, each of which provides a unique growth advantage to breast 
cancer cells and controls a specific phenotypic trait of tumor pro-
gression and metastasis (1, 2). Epigenetic reprogramming plays 
a crucial role in dysregulation of these genes and represents an 
important mechanism of breast tumor progression and metastasis 
(2). Several epigenetic writers and erasers, including DOT1L, G9a, 
histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), WDR5, and Jumonji domain– 
containing protein 3 (JMJD3), have been shown to induce repres-
sion of the CDH1 gene (encoding E-cadherin) in breast cancer 
cells and modulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a key 
cellular program in the initiation of metastasis, thereby trigger-
ing breast tumor metastasis to distant organs (3–6). Our previous 
work showed that JMJD2C promotes triple-negative breast tumor 
growth and metastasis to the lungs in mice through inducing gly-
colytic and metastasis genes (7). Similarly, EZH2, JMJD2B, MLL4, 
and UTX also regulate invasiveness of breast tumors (8–10). 
Recent studies have uncovered that the epigenetic readers also 
emerge to influence breast tumor growth. BRD4 inhibition by its 
shRNA or a pharmacological inhibitor JQ1 dramatically blocks 
triple-negative breast tumor growth in xenograft mice (11). Con-
versely, another epigenetic reader, zinc finger MYND-type con-
taining 11 (ZMYND11), suppresses triple-negative breast tumori-
genesis (12). However, how the epigenetic readers control breast 
tumor progression and metastasis remains poorly understood.
The tumor microenvironment is increasingly recognized as 
a critical factor that regulates epigenetic reprogramming. A nota-
ble feature of the microenvironment of human breast tumors is 
reduced O2 availability (hypoxia) with median partial pressure of 
oxygen (PO2) values of 10 mmHg, which is markedly lower than 65 
mmHg in normal breast tissues (13). The HIFs are the master tran-
scriptional regulators mediating the adaptive responses to intratu-
moral hypoxia to drive breast tumor progression (14). HIFs have 3 
family members, HIF-1, HIF-2, and HIF-3, each of which consists of 
an O2-regulated α subunit and a constitutively expressed β subunit 
(15–17). In well-oxygenated cells, HIF-α protein is subjected to pro-
teasomal degradation, which is mediated by the von Hippel-Lindau 
protein–dependent ubiquitin system, after it is hydroxylated by 
prolyl hydroxylases (18). Under hypoxia, HIF-α escapes from pro-
teasomal degradation and is translocated into the nucleus, where it 
dimerizes with HIF-1β (16). The heterodimer binds to the hypoxia 
response elements (HREs; 5′-A/GCGTG-3′) in the genome, leading 
to transcriptional activation of hundreds of oncogenic genes (19), 
whose protein products regulate angiogenesis, epigenetic repro-
gramming, metabolism, cell migration and invasion, cell survival, 
and stem cell maintenance, leading to tumor growth and metas-
tasis (14). For example, HIF-1 and HIF-2 directly activate the tran-
scription of the proangiogenesis factor VEGFA to increase tumor 
angiogenesis (20). Other HIF-1 target genes — ANGPTL4, AQP1, 
and AGR2 — are also known to induce angiogenesis and cell migra-
tion (21–23). Lysyl oxidase (LOX) regulates collagen crosslinking 
and is essential for premetastatic niche formation. HIF-1 and HIF-2 
Altered epigenetic reprogramming contributes to breast cancer progression and metastasis. How the epigenetic reader 
mediates breast cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that the epigenetic reader zinc finger MYND-
type containing 8 (ZMYND8) is induced by HIF-1 and HIF-2 in breast cancer cells and also upregulated in human breast tumors, 
and is correlated with poor survival of patients with breast cancer. Genetic deletion of ZMYND8 decreases breast cancer cell 
colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs in mice. 
The ZMYND8’s oncogenic effect in breast cancer requires HIF-1 and HIF-2. We further showed that ZMYND8 interacts with 
HIF-1α and HIF-2α and enhances elongation of the global HIF-induced oncogenic genes by increasing recruitment of BRD4 
and subsequent release of paused RNA polymerase II in breast cancer cells. ZMYND8 acetylation at lysines 1007 and 1034 by 
p300 is required for HIF activation and breast cancer progression and metastasis. These findings uncover a primary epigenetic 
mechanism of HIF activation and HIF-mediated breast cancer progression, and discover a possible molecular target for the 
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

To validate the microarray data, a panel of human breast can-
cer cell lines, including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SUM159, T47D, 
HCC1954, and MDA-MB-468, was exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 
24 hours. Quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) assays showed that ZMYND8 mRNA was 
significantly upregulated by hypoxia in all breast cancer cell lines 
we tested (Figure 1A). ZMYND8 protein levels were also elevated, 
along with induced HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins, in these cell lines 
under hypoxia (Figure 1B). Knockout (KO) of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or 
both by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique significantly decreased lev-
els of ZMYND8 mRNA and protein in nonhypoxic and hypoxic 
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1, C and D). These data indicate that 
ZMYND8 is induced by hypoxia in a HIF-1– and HIF-2–dependent 
manner in breast cancer cells.
To determine whether ZMYND8 is a direct HIF target gene in 
breast cancer cells, we analyzed the HIF-1α and HIF-1β chroma-
tin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets from 
T47D cells (36), and found a robust HIF-1α– and HIF-1β–binding 
peak cluster at the promoter of the ZMYND8 gene (Supplemental 
Figure 1C), which annotated an HRE containing a consensus core 
HIF binding sequence (5′-ACGTG-3′) followed by a 5′-CACAG-3′ 
sequence (Figure 1E). To validate the ChIP-seq data, T47D cells 
were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. ChIP-qPCR assays 
showed that occupancy of HIF-1α or HIF-2α on this HRE was sig-
nificantly increased by hypoxia in T47D cells (Figure 1F, left and 
middle), similar to HIF-1α or HIF-2α occupancy on the HRE of a 
known HIF-1 and HIF-2 target gene VEGFA (Supplemental Figure 
1D). Increased HIF-1β enrichment was also detected on the HRE 
of the ZMYND8 gene in hypoxic T47D cells (Figure 1F, right). 
These data indicate that HIF-1 and HIF-2 directly bind to the pro-
moter of the ZMYND8 gene.
Next, we studied whether the HRE at the promoter of the 
ZMYND8 gene is able to enhance gene transcription by a dual-
luciferase reporter assay. A 54-bp oligonucleotide sequence con-
taining the ZMYND8 HRE was inserted upstream of the firefly 
luciferase (FLuc) coding sequence in a pGL2-promoter reporter 
plasmid. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with WT ZMYND8 
HRE reporter plasmid or empty vector (EV) and a control reporter 
pSV40-Renilla (in which Renilla luciferase [RLuc] is constitu-
tively expressed), and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. The 
WT ZMYND8 HRE significantly increased the FLuc activity in 
hypoxic HEK293T cells (Figure 1G). Mutation of the HIF binding 
sequence 5′-CGT-3′ to 5′-AAA-3′ within the HRE completely abol-
ished hypoxia-induced FLuc activity (Figure 1G). Overexpression 
of HIF-1α or HIF-2α significantly enhanced WT but not mutant 
ZMYND8 HRE-driven FLuc activity in nonhypoxic and hypoxic 
HEK293T cells (Figure 1H). In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-based 
KO of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or both significantly decreased hypoxia-
induced ZMYND8 HRE activity in another reporter cell line, HeLa 
(Figure 1I). Taken together, these data indicate that HIF-1 and 
HIF-2 directly bind to the HRE at the ZMYND8 gene promoter to 
activate its transcription in breast cancer cells.
ZMYND8 is highly expressed in human breast tumors and is asso-
ciated with poor clinical outcomes in patients. Hypoxia is a hallmark 
of the microenvironment of breast tumors (13). Thus, we studied 
whether ZMYND8 is also induced in human breast tumors. Analy-
sis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast invasive carcino-
are required for this important premetastatic phenotype in breast 
cancer by inducing expression of the members of the LOX fam-
ily, including LOX, LOXL2, and LOXL4 (24, 25). Therefore, these 
phenotypic traits controlled by the specific genes mediate hypoxia-
driven breast tumor growth and metastasis.
Epigenetic regulators are essential for HIF-mediated trans-
activation (26). The histone acetyltransferases p300, CBP, and 
TIP60 induce acetylation of histones H3 and H4 to increase 
transcription of a subset of HIF-1 target genes (27, 28). HDACs 
1–7 are also known to enhance or suppress HIF-1 transcriptional 
activity via the different mechanisms (26). We have demonstrat-
ed that JMJD2C demethylates trimethyl lysine 9 of histone H3 at 
the HREs to increase HIF-1–mediated transactivation in human 
cancer cells (7). The role of chromatin remodelers in HIF-1–medi-
ated transactivation has been also reported (29, 30). Overall, the 
diverse epigenetic regulators, including writers and erasers, have 
been functionally linked to HIF activation. However, how the 
epigenetic reader modulates hypoxia-induced genes to promote 
breast cancer progression is unknown.
In the present study, we identified a hypoxia-induced epi-
genetic reader, ZMYND8, in breast cancer cells. ZMYND8 
interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and coactivates HIF-1– and 
HIF-2–induced oncogenes by recruiting BRD4 and subsequently 
increasing RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, thereby increas-
ing angiogenesis and cell motility and decreasing cancer cell 
death to promote breast tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs. 
ZMYND8 is acetylated by p300 and acetylated ZMYND8 is neces-
sary for HIF activation and breast tumor progression and metas-
tasis. ZMYND8 is highly expressed in human breast tumors, and 
thus may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for the 
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
Results
ZMYND8 is a novel direct HIF-1 and HIF-2 target gene in breast can-
cer cells. To survey the new hypoxia-induced epigenetic regula-
tors in breast cancer, we analyzed mRNA expression changes of 
720 epigenetic genes in a microarray gene expression data set of 
breast cancer MCF-7 cells exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 18 hours 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and found 
KDM3A, a known HIF-1 and HIF-2 target gene (31), as the top 
hit (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI95089DS1), 
which validated our analysis approach. Of 3 ZMYND8 cDNA 
oligonucleotides, 2 were ranked as the second and third highest 
hypoxia-induced hits in this microarray data set, respectively 
(Supplemental Figure 1A). Similar results were also observed in 
another microarray data set of MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Figure 
1B). ZMYND8 was initially identified in a cDNA library screen 
as a member of the receptors for activated C-kinase family (32). 
Recent studies demonstrated that ZMYND8 functions as an 
epigenetic reader that contains a plant homeodomain (PHD), a 
bromodomain (BRD), and a Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain 
at its N-terminus, which recognizes modified histones including 
di- and trimethyl lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me2/3), acetyl 
lysine 14 of histone H3 (H3K14ac), and acetyl lysine 16 of his-
tone H4 (H4K16ac) as well as DNA (33–35). These data identified 
ZMYND8 as a new hypoxia-induced epigenetic reader.

in estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast tumors as compared 
with adjacent nontumor cells (Supplemental Figure 2C). Notably, 
much higher levels of ZMYND8 protein were observed in triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Thus, 
we focused on TNBC and further analyzed ZMYND8 protein lev-
els in a TNBC tissue microarray (TMA) containing 160 human 
TNBC specimens and 91 paired adjacent normal breast tissues. Of 
160 TNBC specimens, 50% and 30% of tumors expressed mod-
erate and high levels of ZMYND8 protein, respectively (Figure 2, 
E and F). In contrast, moderate ZMYND8 expression was found 
in only a small population of adjacent normal breast tissues (18%) 
and no high ZMYND8 protein levels were detected in normal 
breast tissues (Figure 2, E and F). Negative and weak expression of 
ZMYND8 was predominant in normal breast tissues (Figure 2, E 
ma data set revealed that ZMYND8 mRNA was significantly ele-
vated in primary human breast tumors as compared with adjacent 
normal breast tissues (Figure 2A). The highest levels of ZMYND8 
mRNA were found in metastatic breast tumors (Figure 2A). Simi-
lar findings were also observed in another GEO data set of human 
breast tumors (Supplemental Figure 2A). ZMYND8 mRNA was 
upregulated in luminal A, luminal B, and HER2+ subtypes, and 
stages 1–4 and histological grades 1–4 of human breast tumors 
(Figure 2, B–D). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry 
assays to confirm ZMYND8 induction at protein levels in human 
breast tumors. The specificity of ZMYND8 antibody was validated 
in control and ZMYND8-KO MDA-MB-231 tumors harvested from 
an orthotopic human breast cancer xenograft model in SCID mice 
(Supplemental Figure 2B). ZMYND8 protein was highly expressed

significantly associated with high mortality of patients with differ-
ent subtypes and stages of breast cancer, but not different tumor 
grades (Figure 2, H–J). Together, these data indicate that ZMYND8

knockdown (KD) by its shRNA also decreased the colony num-
bers of MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Figure 3, B–D). These data 
indicate that ZMYND8 increases breast cancer cell survival and 
colony formation in vitro.
Next, we studied the effect of ZMYND8 on breast cancer 
cell migration and invasion in vitro. The Boyden chamber assays 
demonstrated that hypoxia increased migration of scrambled 
control (SC) MDA-MB-231 cells across the transwell membrane 
by 2-fold, whereas migration was significantly decreased by 
ZMYND8 in breast tumors, we performed clonogenic assays in 
vitro. Two independent ZMYND8-KO MDA-MB-231 cell lines 
were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique (Supplemental 
Figure 3A). Single-cell suspensions of parental MDA-MB-231 
cells and ZMYND8-KO subclones were seeded on a 6-well plate 
and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 12 days. Hypoxia significantly 
increased the colony numbers of MDA-MB-231 cells by 2-fold, 
whereas colony numbers were dramatically diminished by 
ZMYND8-KO1 or -KO2 (Figure 3, A and B). Similarly, ZMYND8

ZMYND8-KD1 or -KD2 (Figure 3, C and D). Similarly, the num-
ber of MDA-MB-231 cells invaded through Matrigel in a transwell 
insert was also significantly decreased by ZMYND8-KD1 or -KD2 
under 20% or 1% O2 (Figure 3, E and F). ZMYND8-KD did not 
alter the rate of in vitro cell proliferation (Supplemental Figure 3, 
E and F), which rules out the possibility that reduced cell migra-
tion and invasion by ZMYND8-KD is due to decreased cell pro-
liferation. Together, these data indicate that ZMYND8 increases 
breast cancer cell motility in vitro.
ZMYND8 promotes breast tumor growth and metastasis to the 
lungs in mice in a HIF-1– and HIF-2–dependent manner. To deter-
mine whether ZMYND8 regulates breast tumor growth in vivo, we 
performed the orthotopic implantation of parental or ZMYND8-
KO1 MDA-MB-231 cells into the mammary fat pad of SCID 
mice, and found that genetic deletion of ZMYND8 gene robustly 
blocked spontaneous breast tumor growth in mice (Figure 4A). 
Immunoblot assays confirmed reduced ZMYND8 protein levels in 
ZMYND8-KO1 tumors as compared with parental control tumors 
(Figure 4A). ZMYND8 protein weakly expressed in ZMYND8-KO1 
tumors may be the murine form in tumor stromal cells. Similarly, 
ZMYND8-KO2 or -KD2 also significantly impaired MDA-MB-231 
tumor growth in xenograft mice (Figure 4B and Supplemental Fig-
ure 4A). We further found that ZMYND8-KO1 or -KD2 significant-
ly inhibited MCF-7 tumor growth in xenograft SCID mice subcu-
taneously administered slow-release 17β-estradiol pellets (Figure 
4C, and Supplemental Figure 4, B and C). Immunohistochemis-
try assays showed that the number of cleaved caspase 3–positive 
(CC3-positive) cells was significantly increased in ZMYND8-
KO1 and -KD2 MDA-MB-231 tumors and ZMYND8-KO1 MCF-7 
tumors as compared with their respective control tumors (Figure 
4, D and E, and Supplemental Figure 4, D, E, G, and H), sug-
gesting increased cell death in tumors by ZMYND8-KO or -KD. 
Conversely, the microvessel density shown by endomucin immu-
nohistochemical staining was significantly decreased in these 
tumors (Figure 4, D and F, and Supplemental Figure 4, D, F, G, and 
I), suggesting decreased tumor angiogenesis by ZMYND8-KO or 
-KD. However, expression of Ki-67, a cell proliferation marker, was 
not significantly different between SC and ZMYND8-KD2 MDA-
MB-231 tumors (Supplemental Figure 4D), consistent with our in 
vitro cell growth data above (Supplemental Figure 3F). These data 
indicate that ZMYND8 promotes breast tumor growth in mice by 
increasing tumor angiogenesis and cell survival.

or -KO2 MDA-MB-231 cells into the tail vein of female 
SCID mice. Three weeks after injection, mouse lungs 
were harvested for detection of human genomic DNA 
by qPCR. We found that less human genomic DNA was 
present in the lungs of mice injected with ZMYND8-KO1 
or -KO2 cells as compared with mice bearing parental 
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4K). We also studied the 
effect of ZMYND8-KO on circulating tumor cells in the 
orthotopic xenograft mouse model, and detected a fair 
number of human tumor cells in the circulating blood 
of mice bearing parental MDA-MB-231 tumors (Figure 
4L). However, the number of circulating tumor cells was 
significantly decreased in mice bearing ZMYND8-KO1 
tumors (Figure 4L). The reduced number of circulating 
tumor cells was even found in mice bearing ZMYND8-
KO2 tumors (Supplemental Figure 4L) whose volume 
was comparable to that of control tumors (Figure 4B), 
indicating that reduction in circulating tumor cells 
by ZMYND8-KO is not due to its inhibitory effect on 
tumor growth. Taken together, these data indicate that 
ZMYND8 increases circulating tumor cell populations to 
promote their extravasation and colonization, leading to 
metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lungs.
Last, we performed gain-of-function studies to 
complement loss-of-function effects of ZMYND8 on breast tumor 
progression and metastasis. MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced 
with lentivirus carrying FLAG-ZMYND8 or EV. These stable cell 
lines were implanted into the mammary fat pads of female SCID 
mice. Overexpression of FLAG-ZMYND8 significantly increased 
MDA-MB-231 tumor growth in mice (Figure 5A). HIF-1 and HIF-2 
are the key drivers of invasive breast tumor growth (14). HIF-1/2α–
DKO abolished ZMYND8-induced MDA-MB-231 tumor growth in 
mice (Figure 5A). Immunohistochemistry assays showed FLAG-
ZMYND8 overexpression significantly decreased CC3-positive 
cell numbers but increased microvessel density in parental tumors 
(Figure 5, B–D). However, increased CC3-positive cell numbers 
and decreased microvessel density were found in HIF-1/2α–DKO 
tumors, which were not affected by FLAG-ZMYND8 overex-
pression (Figure 5, B–D). Lung metastasis was also significantly 
increased in mice bearing parental and FLAG-ZMYND8 tumors, 
which were eliminated by HIF-1/2α–DKO (Figure 5E). These data 
indicate that HIF-1 and HIF-2 are required for ZMYND8-mediated 
breast tumor progression and metastasis to the lungs.
ZMYND8 interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α in breast cancer 
cells. The data described above (Figure 5) suggest that ZMYND8 
may be also an upstream regulator of HIF signaling in breast can-
cer cells. Thus, we studied whether ZMYND8 physically interacts 
Next, we studied the effect of ZMYND8 on spontaneous breast 
cancer metastasis to the lungs. H&E staining detected extensive 
metastatic burden in the lungs of mice 37 days after MDA-MB-231 
cell implantation (Figure 4G). In contrast, no lung metastases 
were found in mice bearing ZMYND8-KO1 or -KD2 tumors (Fig-
ure 4G and Supplemental Figure 4J). Analysis of human genomic 
DNA by qPCR further confirmed that no human cancer cells were 
detected in the lungs of these mice (Figure 4H and Supplemental 
Figure 4K). To rule out the possibility that the loss of metastatic 
ability in mice bearing ZMYND8-KO1 or -KD2 tumors is due to 
the small primary tumors, mice orthotopically implanted with 
ZMYND8-KO2 MDA-MB-231 cells were euthanized 12 days later 
than control mice when the volume of ZMYND8-KO2 tumors 
matched that of control MDA-MB-231 tumors at day 40 (Figure 
4B). Again, little lung metastasis burden was detected in mice 
bearing ZMYND8-KO2 tumors as compared with mice bearing 
control tumors (Figure 4, I and J), even though the tumor volume 
was comparable in these 2 groups of mice (Figure 4B). These data 
indicate that ZMYND8 mediates spontaneous metastasis of breast 
cancer cells to the lungs in mice.
Cancer cell extravasation and colonization at distant organs 
is critical for metastatic tumor outgrowth. To determine whether 
ZMYND8 regulates breast cancer cell extravasation and coloniza-

of ZMYND8-V5 significantly increased HIF transcriptional activ-
ity in HeLa cells, as compared with EV (Supplemental Figure 6A).
We next set out to analyze HIF transcriptome profiling con-
trolled by ZMYND8 in breast cancer cells. To this end, parental, 
HIF-1/2α–DKO, and ZMYND8-KO1 MDA-MB-231 cells were 
exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours and subjected to RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq analysis identified 1,124 hypoxia-
inducible genes in MDA-MB-231 cells, of which about one-third 
(367, 32.7%) were induced by HIF-1 and HIF-2 and about half 
(603, 53.6%) were induced by ZMYND8 (Figure 7A). Notably, 230 
genes were overlapped between HIF-upregulated and ZMYND8-
upregulated hypoxia-inducible genes, which represented 62.7% of 
HIF target genes (Figure 7A). Those genes were involved in classic 
HIF-dependent biological functions, including glycolysis, apop-
tosis, and angiogenesis (Figure 7B). Consistent with the RNA-seq 
data, RT-qPCR assays confirmed that hypoxia induced transcrip-
tion of the HIF target genes VEGFA, ANGPTL4, AGR2, AQP1, and 
LOX in MDA-MB-231 cells, and induction of these genes was sig-
nificantly attenuated by ZMYND8-KO1 or -KO2 (Figure 7C). How-
ever, mRNA transcription of non–HIF target gene RPL13A was not 
altered by ZMYND8-KO1 or -KO2 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 
7C). Similar results were also found in ZMYND8-KD2 SUM159 
cells (Supplemental Figure 6, B and C). ZMYND8-KO or -KD did 
not affect protein levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in breast cancer cells 
(Supplemental Figure 3A and Supplemental Figure 6B), which 
rules out regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein stability as the 
cause of ZMYND8-enhanced HIF transcriptional activity.
We further performed ChIP-seq in hypoxic MDA-MB-231 
cells to determine whether ZMYND8 colocalizes with HIF-1α 
at the HREs. MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to 1% O2 for 24 
hours. ZMYND8 was highly enriched near the transcription start 
sites, similar to HIF-1α (Figure 8, A and B). Its ChIP-seq peaks 
with HIF-1α or HIF-2α. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with 
V5-tagged ZMYND8 vector and vector encoding FLAG-tagged 
HIF-1α, FLAG-tagged HIF-2α, or EV, and exposed to 1% O2 for 6 
hours. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using anti–FLAG 
antibody showed that FLAG–HIF-1α or FLAG–HIF-2α, but not EV, 
pulled down ZMYND8-V5 in HEK293T cells (Supplemental Fig-
ure 5A). We also performed a reciprocal co-IP assay using anti–V5 
antibody and found that ZMYND8-V5 precipitated FLAG–HIF-1α 
or FLAG–HIF-2α in hypoxic HEK293T cells (Supplemental Fig-
ure 5, B and C). Further, anti–ZMYND8 antibody coprecipitated 
endogenous ZMYND8, HIF-1α, and HIF-2α in MDA-MB-231 cells 
exposed to 1% O2 for 6 hours (Figure 6A). These data indicate that 
ZMYND8 physically interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α in human 
breast cancer cells.
Next, we mapped the ZMYND8 domain binding to HIF-1α. 
HEK293T cells were transfected with vector encoding full-
length (FL) or domain-deleted FLAG-ZMYND8 (Figure 6B), and 
exposed to 1% O2 for 6 hours. Co-IP assays using anti–HIF-1α 
antibody showed that FL and PBP (ΔPBP), inter (ΔInter), or C3 
(ΔC3) fragment–deleted FLAG-ZMYND8 interacted with HIF-1α 
(Figure 6C). In contrast, deletion of the MYND domain (ΔMYND) 
or 2 C-terminal fragments (ΔC1 and ΔC2) abolished ZMYND8 
binding to HIF-1α in hypoxic HEK293T cells (Figure 6C). These 
data indicate that the MYND domain of ZMYND8 is required and 
sufficient for interaction with HIF-1α.
ZMYND8 activates the global HIF target genes in breast cancer 
cells. To determine whether ZMYND8 regulates HIF transcription-
al activity, we first performed HIF luciferase reporter assays. HeLa 
cells were cotransfected with a HIF reporter (containing 2 copies 
of HREs from the human VEGFA gene upstream of SV40 promoter 
and FLuc coding sequence), pSV-Renilla, and ZMYND8-V5 vector 
or EV, and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. Overexpression

RPL13A (Figure 8, G and H). Taken together, the mRNA-seq and 
ChIP-seq data indicate that ZMYND8 colocalizes with HIF-1 and 
activates its global target genes in breast cancer cells.
ZMYND8 is associated with H3K14ac and H4K16ac at the HREs 
and induces release of paused RNA polymerase II in breast cancer cells. 
To determine whether ZMYND8 binds to the HREs through modi-
fied histones, we studied occupancy of H3K14ac, H3K36me2, 
H3K36me3, and H4K16ac on the HREs in MDA-MB-231 cells 
exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. ChIP-seq showed that 
H3K14ac peaks were markedly overlapped with ZMYND8 peaks 
and co-occupied at the HREs (Figure 8, C and H). H3K14ac occu-
pancy at the LOX and ANGPTL4 HREs was significantly increased 
by hypoxia in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9, A and E). Likewise, 
H4K16ac was strongly enriched on the HREs of LOX and ANG-
PTL4 as compared with control IgG in nonhypoxic MDA-MB-231 
cells, and hypoxia increased its occupancy on both HREs by 2-fold 
and 1.7-fold, respectively (Figure 9, B and F). In contrast, enrich-
were mainly located at the promoter (29.7%), intergenic (36.5%), 
and intron (30.9%) regions (Figure 8A). Strikingly, about 85.4% 
of HIF-1α peaks overlapped with ZMYND8 peaks (Figure 8C), 
and 92% of HIF-1 target genes were co-occupied by HIF-1α and 
ZMYND8 (Figure 8D). The metagene analysis confirmed strong 
colocalization of HIF-1α and ZMYND8 (Figure 8E). The motif 
analysis of ZMYND8 peaks further revealed marked enrichment 
of the HRE (Figure 8F). These data indicate genome-wide colocal-
ization of HIF-1α and ZMYND8 at the HREs.
To validate the ChIP-seq data, ChIP-qPCR assays were per-
formed in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. 
ZMYND8 was highly enriched at the HREs of LOX and ANGPTL4, 
but weakly enriched on RPL13A, as compared with control IgG in 
nonhypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells. ZMYND8 occupancy on the LOX 
and ANGPTL4 HREs was significantly increased 2.6- and 1.8-fold, 
respectively, by hypoxia (Figure 8, G and H). HIF-1β occupancy 
was similarly detected on the HREs of LOX and ANGPTL4, but not

IP assays. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with ZMYND8-V5 
vector and FLAG-BRD4 vector. Anti–FLAG antibody, but not IgG, 
precipitated both FLAG-BRD4 and ZMYND8-V5 (Supplemental 
Figure 7A). Similarly, anti–BRD4 antibody coprecipitated endog-
enous BRD4 and ZMYND8 in MDA-MB-231 cells, but control IgG 
failed to do so (Figure 11A). We further performed a reciprocal co-
IP assay and found that ZMYND8-V5 pulled down FLAG-BRD4 in 
HEK293T cells treated with HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) 
(Supplemental Figure 7B). Precipitation of endogenous ZMYND8 
by anti–ZMYND8 antibody also pulled down endogenous BRD4 in 
MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TSA (Figure 11B). Hypoxia did not 
influence physical interaction of ZMYND8 with BRD4 in MDA-
MB-231 cells (Supplemental Figure 7C). These data indicate that 
ZMYND8 physically interacts with BRD4 in breast cancer cells, 
and that ZMYND8-BRD4 interaction is enhanced upon inhibition 
of HDAC but independent of hypoxia.
Next, we mapped the ZMYND8-BRD4 binding domains in 
HEK293T cells by co-IP assays. HEK293T cells were transiently 
cotransfected with ZMYND8-V5 vector and FL or domain-deleted 
FLAG-BRD4 vector or EV. Analysis of FLAG immunoprecipitates 
revealed that ZMYND8-V5 was precipitated by FL and BID (ΔBID), 
NPS (ΔNPS), ET (ΔET), or CTM (ΔCTM) domain–deleted FLAG-
BRD4 (Figure 11C). However, deletion of the BRD1 and BRD2 
(ΔBRD1/2) of FLAG-BRD4 or EV failed to pull down ZMYND8-V5 
in HEK293T cells (Figure 11C). Interestingly, deletion of the indi-
vidual BRD1 (ΔBRD1) or BRD2 (ΔBRD2) of FLAG-BRD4 had little 
effect on its interaction with ZMYND8-V5 in HEK293T cells (Sup-
plemental Figure 7D), indicating that ZMYND8 binds to both BRD1 
and BRD2 of BRD4. JQ1 competitively binds to BRD1/2 to block 
BRD4 functions (40). Treatment of JQ1 remarkably decreased 
FL, ΔBRD1, or ΔBRD2 of FLAG-BRD4 binding to ZMYND8-V5 
in HEK293T cells (Supplemental Figure 7D), further confirming 
that both BRD1 and BRD2 of BRD4 are required for ZMYND8 
binding. On the other side, ΔPBP, ΔInter, or ΔC3 FLAG-ZMYND8 
bound to BRD4 in HEK293T cells treated with TSA, similar to FL 
FLAG-ZMYND8 (Figure 11D). However, ΔC1, ΔC2, or ΔMYND of 
FLAG-ZMYND8 lost the ability to bind to BRD4 (Figure 11D), indi-
cating that the MYND domain is necessary and sufficient for BRD4 
interaction. Taken together, these findings indicate that the MYND 
domain of ZMYND8 interacts with BRD1/2 of BRD4 in cells.
To determine whether BRD4 regulates HIF-mediated trans-
activation, we established 2 independent Tet-inducible BRD4-
ment of H3K14ac and H4K16ac on RPL13A was not regulated 
by hypoxia in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9, I and J). Occupancy 
of H3K36me2, H3K36me3, histone H3, or histone H4 on LOX, 
ANGPTL4, and RPL13A was also not altered by hypoxia in MDA-
MB-231 cells (Figure 9, C, D, G, H, K, and L). The global levels of 
H4K16ac, but not H3K14ac, H3K36me2, H3K36me3, histone H3, 
and histone H4, were increased by hypoxia in MDA-MB-231 cells 
(Figure 9M). These data indicate that H3K14ac and H4K16ac, but 
not H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, mediate ZMYND8 binding to the 
HREs of the HIF target genes in breast cancer cells.
Previous studies have shown that RNA polymerase II is 
preloaded and paused at the promoter of the HIF target genes 
and that paused RNA polymerase II release is essential for HIF- 
mediated transactivation (37). Paused RNA polymerase II is 
phosphorylated at serine 5 (S5P), whereas serine 2 phosphoryla-
tion (S2P) of RNA polymerase II controls release of paused RNA 
polymerase II (38). To determine whether ZMYND8 regulates 
paused RNA polymerase II release to promote HIF-mediated 
transactivation, parental and ZMYND8-KO2 MDA-MB-231 cells 
were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours and subjected to ChIP-
qPCR assays. Hypoxia significantly increased RNA polymerase II–
S2P occupancy on the LOX and ANGPTL4 genes but did not affect 
enrichment of RNA polymerase II–S5P in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig-
ure 10, A and B), confirming the previous findings (37). ZMYND8-
KO2 significantly decreased enrichment of RNA polymerase II–
S2P, but not RNA polymerase II–S5P and total RNA polymerase 
II, on the LOX and ANGPTL4 genes in hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells 
(Figure 10, A and B). ZMYND8-KO2 had no effects on occupancy 
of RNA polymerase II–S2P, RNA polymerase II–S5P, or total RNA 
polymerase II on the RPL13A gene in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 
10C). Together, these findings indicate that ZMYND8 induces 
release of paused RNA polymerase II to promote transcriptional 
elongation of the HIF target genes in breast cancer cells.
BRD4 recruited by ZMYND8 is required for ZMYND8-mediated 
HIF activation in breast cancer cells. A recent study showed that 
ZMYND8 binds to RNA polymerase II–S5P, but not RNA poly-
merase II–S2P (34), suggesting that a ZMYND8-interacting pro-
tein may mediate ZMYND8 signaling to RNA polymerase II–S2P, 
leading to elongation of the HIF target genes. BRD4 is a known 
transcriptional regulator to induce RNA polymerase II–S2P (39). To 
determine whether BRD4 is involved in ZMYND8-mediated HIF 
activation, we first studied ZMYND8 interaction with BRD4 by co-
Figure 10. ZMYND8 mediates hypoxia-induced RNA polymerase II–S2P occupancy on the HIF target genes in breast cancer cells. (A–C) RNA polymerase

data indicate that ZMYND8 recruits BRD4 to the 
HREs to induce HIF-mediated transactivation in 
breast cancer cells.
Previous studies showed that ZMYND8 recruits 
CHD4, a core helicase in the nucleosome remodel-
ing and deacetylase complex, to the chromatin (33, 
41). To determine whether CHD4 is involved in 
ZMYND8-mediated HIF activation, we performed 
co-IP assays and found that CHD4 physically inter-
acted with HIF-1α and HIF-2α in MDA-MB-231 cells 
under hypoxia (Supplemental Figure 8A). How-
ever, ZMYND8-KO did not influence CHD4 bind-
ing to HIF-1α or HIF-2α in hypoxic MDA-MB-231 
cells (Supplemental Figure 8A), suggesting that 
ZMYND8 does not mediate CHD4 recruitment 
to the HIF transactivation complex. Further, we 
found that CHD4 knockdown significantly inhib-
ited expression of the HIF target genes VEGFA, 
LOX, and AGR2, but not AQP1, in MDA-MB-231 
cells under hypoxia (Supplemental Figure 8, B and 
C), indicating that CHD4 does not fully phenocopy 
ZMYND8’s effect on HIF activation in breast cancer 
cells. These data indicate that ZMYND8 and CHD4 independent-
ly increase HIF-mediated transactivation in breast cancer cells.
ZMYND8 acetylation at lysines 1007 and 1034 by p300 is 
required for interaction with BRD4 and HIF activation in breast can-
cer cells. The BRD1/2 of BRD4 specifically recognizes acetylated 
lysine residues of its interacting protein (40). Our binding domain 
mapping studies (Figure 11, C and D) suggest that ZMYND8 may 
be acetylated at lysine residue(s) within the MYND domain. To 
test this hypothesis, HEK293T cells were transfected with vec-
tor encoding ZMYND8-V5 or EV, and treated with TSA or DMSO 
for 6 hours. Immunoblot analysis of V5 immunoprecipitates by 
anti–acetyl lysine antibody showed that ZMYND8-V5 is acety-
lated in cells, and that treatment of TSA dramatically increased 
lysine acetylation of ZMYND8-V5 (Figure 12A). Hypoxia had no 
effect on ZMYND8-V5 acetylation in HEK293T cells (Supple-
mental Figure 9A). Acetylation of endogenous ZMYND8 was 
also detected in MCF-7 cells treated with TSA (Figure 12G). Fur-
thermore, we found that ΔMYND abolished lysine acetylation of 
FLAG-ZMYND8 (Figure 12B), indicating acetylation of the lysine 
residue(s) within the MYND domain. The MYND domain of 
ZMYND8 contains 3 lysine residues, and lysine 1007 and 1034 
residues are highly conserved across species of vertebrates (Sup-
plemental Figure 9B). Individual mutation of lysine into arginine 
did not reduce FLAG-ZMYND8 acetylation (Supplemental Fig-
ure 9C). Double mutation of lysines 1007 and 1034 to arginine 
(K1007/1034R) recapitulated the loss of acetylation of ΔMYND 
(Figure 12B), whereas double mutation of lysines 1006 and 1034 
to arginine (K1006/1034R) did not. Consistently, K1007/1034R, 
but not K1006/1034R or individual lysine to arginine mutation, 
completely blocked ZMYND8 binding to BRD4 in HEK293T cells 
(Figure 12C, and Supplemental Figure 9D). None of these lysine 
mutations altered ZMYND8 binding to HIF-1α (Supplemental 
Figure 9E). These data indicate that ZMYND8 is acetylated at 
lysines 1007 and 1034, and that acetylated ZMYND8 is required 
for interaction with BRD4 in cells.
KD MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Supplemental Figure 7E). SC and 
BRD4-KD1 or -KD2 MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to 20% 
or 1% O2 for 24 hours in the presence of doxycycline. RT-qPCR 
assays showed that BRD4-KD1 or -KD2 significantly decreased 
hypoxia-induced transcription of the HIF target genes VEGFA, 
LOX, AGR2, AQP1, and ANGPTL4, but not RPL13A, in MDA-
MB-231 cells (Figure 11E). This effect was not due to the protein 
stability of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, as their protein levels were not 
affected by BRD4-KD1 or -KD2 (Supplemental Figure 7E). These 
data indicate that BRD4 enhances HIF-mediated transactivation 
in breast cancer cells.
To determine whether BRD4 is required for ZMYND8-medi-
ated HIF activation, we performed the HIF luciferase reporter 
assays. HeLa cells were transfected with HIF reporter plasmid, 
pSV-Renilla, SC or BRD4-KD1 or -KD2 vector, and ZMYND8-V5 
vector or EV, and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours in the 
presence of doxycycline. Consistent with HIF target gene expres-
sion (Figure 11E), BRD4-KD1 or -KD2 significantly decreased HIF 
transcriptional activity in hypoxic HeLa cells (Figure 11F). More-
over, BRD4-KD1 or -KD2 dramatically blocked ZMYND8-induced 
HIF activation in nonhypoxic and hypoxic HeLa cells (Figure 11F). 
These data indicate that BRD4 promotes HIF transcriptional activ-
ity, and that it is required for ZMYND8-mediated HIF activation.
To determine whether ZMYND8 recruits BRD4 to the HREs 
of the HIF target genes, we performed ChIP-qPCR assays in 
parental and ZMYND8-KO2 MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 20% 
or 1% O2 for 24 hours, and found that BRD4 occupied on the HREs 
of LOX and ANGPTL4 genes in nonhypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells, 
and hypoxia significantly increased its occupancy (Figure 11G, left 
and middle). ZMYND8-KO2 abolished hypoxia-induced BRD4 
enrichment on the HREs of the LOX and ANGPTL4 genes but not 
the RPL13A gene in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 11G). Conversely, 
we found that BRD4-KD2 did not regulate ZMYND8 binding to 
the HREs of LOX, ANGPTL4, and RPL13A genes in nonhypoxic 
and hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplemental Figure 7F). These

H3K14ac and H4K16ac and acetylated at lysines 1007 and 1034 by p300 in breast can-
cer cells. Acetylated ZMYND8 recruits BRD4 to the HREs to form a HIF transactivation 
complex. Upon HIF binding to the HRE under hypoxia, ZMYND8/BRD4 are further enriched 
at the HREs and enhance RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at serine 2 and subsequent 
transcriptional elongation of the HIF target genes in breast cancer cells, thereby increasing 
angiogenesis and cell motility and decreasing cell death to promote breast cancer progres-
sion and metastasis. ZMYND8 itself is induced by HIF-1 and HIF-2 and thus amplifies HIF 
activity and HIF-mediated breast cancer progression and metastasis.

metastasis burden shown by H&E staining and qPCR assays was 
also partially but significantly rescued by overexpression of WT, 
but not K1007/1034R, FLAG-ZMYND8 in xenograft mice (Fig-
ure 12P and Supplemental Figure 10E). These data indicate that 
ZMYND8 acetylation is required for breast cancer progression and 
metastasis to the lungs.
Discussion
In the present study, we delineate an epigenetic mechanism by 
which the epigenetic reader ZMYND8 promotes HIF-mediated 
transactivation and breast cancer progression and metastasis (Fig-
ure 13). ZMYND8 physically interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α and 
also binds to the HREs possibly through H3K14ac and H4K16ac, 
where ZMYND8 is acetylated at lysines 1007 and 1034 by the 
HIF coactivator p300. Acetylated ZMYND8 recognizes the bro-
modomains of BRD4 and recruits the latter to the HREs, leading 
to increased RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at serine 2 and 
subsequent transcriptional elongation of the HIF target genes in 
breast cancer cells. Consequently, the ZMYND8/p300/BRD4/
HIF axis increases angiogenesis and cell motility and decreases 
cancer cell death to promote breast tumor progression and metas-
tasis. ZMYND8 itself is a HIF-1 and HIF-2 target gene, and thus 
provides a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies HIF- 
mediated transactivation and subsequent breast cancer progres-
sion and metastasis (Figure 13).
Several epigenetic regulators have been shown to coactivate 
a subset of HIF target genes in cancer cells (7, 26, 27, 43). Our 
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data indicate that ZMYND8 co-occupies 
more than 85% of the genome-wide HIF-1 binding sites and acti-
vates more than 60% of the global HIF-dependent coding genes 
in breast cancer cells, indicating that ZMYND8 also regulates 
HIF-dependent long noncoding RNAs as they are the direct HIF 
targets under hypoxia (37). These findings reveal that ZMYND8 
is a primary HIF regulator that plays a dominant role in HIF activa-
tion in breast cancer. In line with its dominant role in transcription 
of the HIF target genes in breast cancer cells, ZMYND8 pheno-
copies HIF’s oncogenic effects in breast cancer progression and 
metastasis. Strikingly, ZMYND8 acetylation at lysines 1007 and 
1034 by p300 is the key to switch on HIF activation and breast 
cancer progression and metastasis. Our data indicate that this 
novel posttranslational modification mediates assembly of the 
HIF transcription machinery to promote HIF activation in breast 
cancer cells. ZMYND8 acetylation may be reversible in breast 
cancer cells, as treatment of an HDAC inhibitor TSA dramatically 
increases ZMYND8 acetylation. HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been 
shown to interact with ZMYND8 (33), and are also known to regu-
late HIF-1 transcriptional activity (26). Further studies are needed 
to determine which HDAC deacetylates ZMYND8.
Recent studies suggest that RNA polymerase II pausing and 
release finely switch HIF activation on and off (37, 43). The HIF 
transcription machinery, including RNA polymerase II, is preas-
sembled and preloaded at the promoter of the target genes under 
nonhypoxic conditions, and release of paused RNA polymerase II 
triggers gene elongation once HIF binds to the HREs under hypox-
ia (37). We found that BRD4 is recruited by ZMYND8 to the HREs 
of the HIF target genes. Their interaction is constitutive and not 
regulated by O2 tension. BRD4 is known to interact with positive 
To identify the lysine acetyltransferase that acetylates 
ZMYND8, we screened acetyltransferases by in vitro acetyla-
tion assays. FLAG-ZMYND8 was expressed in HEK293T cells 
and purified by anti–FLAG antibody. Purified FLAG-ZMYND8 
was then incubated in the presence of acetyl-CoA with the acet-
yltransferase FLAG-p300, FLAG-PCAF, or FLAG-GCN5 that was 
expressed and purified from Sf9 cells (42), and analyzed by immu-
noblot assays with anti–acetyl lysine antibody. FLAG-p300 strong-
ly induced acetylation of FLAG-ZMYND8 in vitro (Figure 12D). In 
contrast, no detectable acetylation of FLAG-ZMYND8 was found 
after incubation with FLAG-PCAF or FLAG-GCN5 (Figure 12D). 
Moreover, K1007/1034R abolished FLAG-p300–induced acety-
lation of FLAG-ZMYND8 (Figure 12E). We next studied whether 
p300 catalyzes ZMYND8 acetylation in vivo. Co-IP assays showed 
that endogenous p300 interacted with endogenous ZMYND8 in 
MCF-7 cells (Figure 12F), and their interaction was not regulated 
by hypoxia (Supplemental Figure 9F). p300-KD by 2 indepen-
dent shRNAs completely abolished lysine acetylation of endog-
enous ZMYND8 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 12G). Pharmacological 
inhibition of p300 by its inhibitor L002 also reduced acetylation 
of ZMYND8 in MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Figure 9G). Further, 
we found that p300-KD blocked ZMYND8-BRD4 interaction in 
MCF-7 cells (Figure 12H). Together, these findings indicate that 
p300 is a lysine acetyltransferase for ZMYND8.
To determine whether ZMYND8 acetylation is required for 
HIF-mediated transactivation, we generated the rescued cell lines 
by transducing ZMYND8-KD2 MDA-MB-231 cells with lentivi-
rus encoding WT or K1007/1034R FLAG-ZMYND8 or EV. WT or 
K1007/1034R FLAG-ZMYND8 protein was expressed at compa-
rable levels to endogenous ZMYND8 protein in SC MDA-MB-231 
cells, and did not affect the levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins 
(Supplemental Figure 10A). These rescued cell lines and SC MDA-
MB-231 cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. RT-qPCR 
assays showed that the reduced transcription of LOX mRNA in 
ZMYND8-KD2 MDA-MB-231 cells was restored by overexpres-
sion of WT FLAG-ZMYND8 to that in SC MDA-MB-231 cells 
under hypoxia (Figure 12I). In contrast, overexpression of FLAG-
ZMYND8 (K1007/1034R) failed to restore reduced transcription 
of LOX mRNA in ZMYND8-KD2 MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 12I). 
Neither WT FLAG-ZMYND8 nor FLAG-ZMYND8 (K1007/1034R) 
influenced the RPL13A mRNA levels in nonhypoxic and hypoxic 
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 12I). These data indicate that acetylation 
of lysines 1007 and 1034 is necessary for ZMYND8-mediated HIF 
activation in breast cancer cells.
Acetylated ZMYND8 mediates breast tumor growth and lung 
metastasis. Next, we studied whether ZMYND8 acetylation medi-
ates the oncogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of 
WT FLAG-ZMYND8, but not FLAG-ZMYND8 (K1007/1034R), 
restored the colony formation, migration, and invasion abilities 
of ZMYND8-KD2 MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 12, J–L, and Supple-
mental Figure 10, B and C). Reduced MDA-MB-231 tumor growth 
conferred by ZMYND8-KD2 was partially rescued by WT but not 
K1007/1034R FLAG-ZMYND8 in xenograft mice (Figure 12M, and 
Supplemental Figure 10D). Notably, overexpression of WT but not 
K1007/1034R FLAG-ZMYND8 completely restored microvessel 
density and CC3-positive cell numbers in ZMYND8-KD2 tumors 
(Figure 12, N and O, and Supplemental Figure 10E). Further, lung

DNA profiling analysis.
Clonogenic assays. One hundred cells were seeded on a 6-well plate 
and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 12–18 days. Colonies were washed 
with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 0.5% 
crystal violet (MilliporeSigma). After staining, colonies were gently 
washed and counted.
Boyden chamber migration and invasion assays. Cells (5 × 104) were 
resuspended in serum-free medium, seeded in a transwell insert (for 
migration) or a Matrigel-coated transwell insert (for invasion) in the 
presence of cell culture medium with 10% FBS at the bottom chamber, 
and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 16 hours (migration) or 24 hours (inva-
sion). Cells that invaded to the lower side of the transwell insert were 
fixed with methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and counted.
IP and immunoblot assays. Cells were lysed in NETN lysis buffer 
(150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP-40, 
and protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 minutes on ice and followed by 
sonication (33). After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 15 minutes, super-
natant was collected for IP overnight with the following antibodies: V5, 
FLAG, HIF-1α, ZMYND8, BRD4, CHD4, or p300 in the presence of 
protein A/G magnetic beads (Bio-Rad). The next day, proteins bound 
on the beads were washed 4 times with NETN lysis buffer, boiled in 1× 
Laemmli buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immu-
noblot assays with the antibodies listed in Supplemental Table 1.
Luciferase reporter assays. HeLa or HEK293T cells were seeded on 
a 48-well plate, transfected with the indicated plasmids, and exposed 
to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 hours. The FLuc/RLuc activities were mea-
sured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) (7).
In vitro acetylation assays. Immunoprecipitated WT or K1007/ 
1034R FLAG-ZMYND8 protein was incubated for one hour at 30°C 
in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA and purified FLAG-p300, 
FLAG-PCAF, or FLAG-GCN5 (gifts from Cheng-Ming Chiang, UT 
Southwestern, Dallas, Texas, USA) (42), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and 
analyzed by immunoblot assays using antibodies against acetyl lysine 
(1: 2,000) or FLAG epitope (1: 5,000).
RT-qPCR assays. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using 
Trizol reagent (ThermoFisher) and reverse-transcribed. RT-qPCR assays 
were performed with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 (7).
RNA-seq assays. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini 
kit (Qiagen), and treated with DNase (Qiagen). mRNA was used for 
library preparation with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit 
(Illumina), and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. See Supple-
mental Methods for analysis details.
ChIP assays. Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde and 
quenched in 0.125 M glycine. ChIP-qPCR assays were performed with 
the primers listed in Supplemental Table 3 (7). For ChIP-seq, chroma-
tin was isolated using the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit 
(Cell Signaling Technology), sonicated to 200–300 bp in length, and 
subjected to IP using antibodies against ZMYND8, HIF-1α, H3K14ac, 
or histone H3. ChIP DNA libraries were prepared with the KAPA Hyper 
Prep Kit and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. See Supplemen-
tal Methods for analysis details.
Animal studies. For the orthotopic breast cancer mouse model (7), 
2 × 106 cells in 100 μl PBS/Matrigel (1:1, Corning) were injected into 
the second left mammary fat pad of female SCID mice (6–8 weeks 
old, Envigo). Tumor volume was measured with a caliper every 3 days 
beginning on day 11–16 after cell implantation, and calculated accord-
transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and regulates P-TEFb–
induced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II at serine 2, there-
by promoting release of paused RNA polymerase II at the promot-
er (39). Thus, the ZMYND8/BRD4 axis well supports the current 
model of HIF activation and represents an important molecular 
mechanism underlying release of paused RNA polymerase II and 
elongation of the HIF target genes.
Apart from BRD4, P-TEFb–mediated release of paused RNA 
polymerase II is also regulated by the super elongation complex 
(SEC) via a distinct mechanism (44). A previous report demon-
strated a role of the SEC in release of paused RNA polymerase II at 
the promoter of a subset of HIF-1 target genes in HCT116 cells (43). 
CDK8 controls the recruitment of AFF4, a key component of the 
SEC, to the HIF-1 target gene ANKRD37, but has no effect on BRD4 
recruitment. Notably, ZMYND8-controlled HIF target genes such 
as AQP1, AGR2, and LOX are not regulated by the CDK8/AFF4 
axis (43). Therefore, ZMYND8/BRD4 and CDK8/AFF4 selectively 
regulate P-TEFb–induced release of paused RNA polymerase II on 
their respective HIF target genes and subsequent gene elongation.
Our extensive functional studies in multiple ER+ and TNBC 
cell lines in vitro and breast cancer mouse models indicate that 
ZMYND8 is an oncoprotein in breast cancer. This concept may 
be extended to prostate cancer because a previous study showed 
that ZMYND8 increases VEGFA expression and angiogenesis in 
prostate DU145 xenograft tumors from zebrafish (45). Previous 
genetic studies identified ZMYND8 fusion proteins in patients 
with acute erythroid leukemia and breast cancer and they may 
be pathogenic for the diseases (46, 47), also supporting an onco-
genic role of ZMYND8 in human cancers. However, recent studies 
showed that ZMYND8 suppresses growth of ZR-75-30 or DU145 
xenograft tumors by inducing gene silencing (48, 49). It is unclear 
whether these discrepancies are due to the experimental context 
or cell types. Nevertheless, we showed that DKO of HIF-1α and 
HIF-2α abolished ZMYND8-mediated breast cancer progression 
and metastasis in mice, suggesting that ZMYND8’s oncogenic 
functions in breast cancer require HIF-1 and HIF-2. ZMYND8 
is known to bind to and enhance ER α transcriptional activity in 
MCF-7 cells (50), and also regulates the transcription of all-trans 
retinoic acid–dependent genes in SH-SY5Y cells (34). Whether 
or not these HIF-independent ZMYND8 functions contribute to 
breast tumorigenesis needs to be investigated.
In conclusion, our studies in human breast cancer cells, breast 
cancer mouse models, and human breast cancer patients provide a 
strong rationale for ZMYND8 as a potential biomarker and thera-
peutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

ing to the formula: volume = 0.52 × length × height × width. Lungs were 
perfused with PBS and analyzed by H&E staining and qPCR assays 
with primers for human HK2 gene and mouse and human 18S rRNA.
For the tail vein injection model, 1 × 106 cells in 100 μl PBS were 
injected into the tail vein of female SCID mice. Three weeks later, 
lungs were perfused with PBS and subjected to qPCR assays with 
primers for human HK2 gene and mouse and human 18S rRNA.
Measurement of circulating tumor cells. Genomic DNA was extract-
ed from peripheral blood in SCID mice bearing parental or ZMYND8-
KO MDA-MB-231 tumors using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit 
(Qiagen), and quantified by qPCR assays with primers for the human 
HK2 gene and mouse and human 18S rRNA. MDA-MB-231 cells were 
mixed with blood from tumor-free SCID mice to generate a standard 
curve. The number of circulating tumor cells in mouse blood was cal-
culated according to the standard curve.
Immunohistochemistry assays. Immunohistochemistry assays 
were performed by the Dako Autostainer Link 48 system. Briefly, the 
slides were baked, deparaffinized, and hydrated, followed by antigen 
retrieval in a Dako PT Link. The tissues were incubated with a per-
oxidase block and then a following primary antibody: ZMYND8 (1: 
1,000), cleaved caspase 3 (1: 1,500), Ki-67 (ready to use), or endomu-
cin (1: 50). The staining was visualized using the EnVision FLEX visu-
alization system (Dako).
Human breast tumor studies. Human ER+ breast tumor and TNBC 
tissues and a TNBC TMA were obtained from surgical breast cancer 
pathologist Yan Peng and UT Southwestern Tissue Resource, and ana-
lyzed by immunohistochemistry assays. Each staining was scored by 
Yan Chen and Yan Peng using 4 grades (range 0–3) according to the 
percentage of immunopositive cells and immunostaining intensity.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed by 2-tailed Student’s 
t test between 2 groups, and 1-way or 2-way ANOVA with multiple 
testing correction within multiple groups. Quantification of ZMYND8 
protein levels between normal breast tissues and human TNBC tissues 
was determined by χ2 test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was analyzed 
by log-rank test. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were repeated twice, and oth-
er experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Data were expressed as 
mean ± SEM. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Accession number. The RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data were depos-
ited at the GEO database with accession number GSE108833.
Study approval. Animal experiments were approved by the Animal 
Care and Use Committee at UT Southwestern Medical Center. The de-
identified human ER+ breast tumor, TNBC, and adjacent normal breast
