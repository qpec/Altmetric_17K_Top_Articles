Studies reporting blood levels of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were systematically identified in order to create a global map identifying countries
and regions with different blood levels. Included studies were those of healthy adults, published in 1980 or later.
A total of 298 studies met all inclusion criteria. Studies reported fatty acids in various blood fractions including
plasma total lipids (33%), plasma phospholipid (32%), erythrocytes (32%) and whole blood (3.0%). Fatty acid
data from each blood fraction were converted to relative weight percentages (wt.%) and then assigned to one
of four discrete ranges (high, moderate, low, very low) corresponding to wt.% EPA+DHA in erythrocyte equiva-
lents. Regions with high EPA+DHA blood levels (N8%) included the Sea of Japan, Scandinavia, and areas with in-
digenous populations or populations not fully adapted to Westernized food habits. Very low blood levels (≤4%)
were observed in North America, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa.
The present review reveals considerable variability in blood levels of EPA+DHA and the very low to low range of
blood EPA+DHA for most of the world may increase global risk for chronic disease.

1. Introduction
Noncommunicable disease or “chronic disease” mortality is estimat-
ed to be the cause of death for 38 million people worldwide each year,
disproportionately effecting those in low and middle-income countries
and unhealthy diets are considered a main contributor [1]. Determining
global variation in nutrient status informs the process of creating na-
tional and worldwide dietary guidance. Dietary omega-3 long-chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,
20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), have been associ-
ated with a decreased risk of chronic disease, in particular cardiovascu-
lar mortality [2] and cognitive decline [3]. Global dietary intakes of
omega-3 LCPUFA has been examined and it has been estimated that
less than 20% of the world population consumes ≥250 mg/day of sea-
food omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [4]. However, the re-
liability of EPA+DHA intake estimates is limited by various factors
including the availability of accurate and timely food composition data
in nutrient databases that can differ across countries [4,5] but also the
challenge of reporting errors in the collection of dietary data [6,7]. The
fatty acid composition of blood does not have these limitations and
blood EPA+DHA also reflects other metabolic factors and behavioral
choices that can influence EPA+DHA status [8–12]. Blood levels of
omega-3 PUFA, particularly EPA and DHA have been linked to a reduced
risk of primary cardiac arrest [13], sudden cardiac death [14] and all-
cause dementia [15]. Therefore, our objective was to systematically re-
view the available literature and identify studies reporting blood
EPA+DHA levels to create a visualization of global EPA+DHA status
useful for identifying countries and regions potentially at an increased
risk of chronic disease due, at least in part, to their omega-3 LCPUFA sta-
tus. The results of the global map of blood levels of EPA+DHA and blood
level recommendations are contrasted against reports of dietary intakes
and dietary intake recommendations. In addition, the possible conse-
quences of global blood levels on chronic disease risk and the challenges
of achieving blood levels recommended to reduce chronic disease risk
are discussed.
2. Systematic review methodology
2.1. Search strategy
To identify relevant studies, a comprehensive literature search was
conducted using two scientific literature databases (PubMed and
Embase) through April 2014. Supplementary literature searches includ-
ed examining the reference lists of all relevant studies, pertinent review
articles, and meta-analyses. Included studies published after the date of
literature search were identified via publication alerts. Relevant terms
representing EPA and DHA and blood fatty acid measurement were
used for each database searched. When appropriate, subject headings
were exploded and terms truncated (see PubMed search strategy in
Supplementary Table S1).
2.2. Inclusion exclusion criteria
Included studies were those of healthy adults (≥16 years) reporting,
at a minimum, red blood cell, plasma, or whole blood of both EPA and
DHA fatty acid data, published in 1980 or later, and using a capillary col-
umn to separate fatty acids. Studies of pregnant and nursing women, in-
fants and children or subjects with existing disease were excluded.
Studies of individuals with disease risk factors were included. All
study designs were eligible with the exception of individual case stud-
ies. Preference was given to studies published in English, however, stud-
ies in other languages were considered if data was otherwise
unavailable for a particular country. When data from randomized, con-
trolled trials was used only baseline data from subjects in the placebo
group was included.
2.3. Search results screening and data extraction
Level I screening of search results included a review of all titles and/
or abstracts compared to eligibility criteria. Full-text publications of any
studies not eliminated at Level I were retrieved for complete review at
Level II screening. All search results were screened by two individuals
with approximately 95% agreement regarding included and excluded
studies. Differences were resolved by discussion and consultation with
a third researcher as needed. Two researchers completed data extrac-
tion for all studies, one review author checked text entries, and one in-
dependent quality control person checked numeric outcome data.
Included studies were further examined to identify related or “kin”
studies. When kin studies were identified, the study reporting the
most detailed fatty acid data for the largest sample size was selected
for further data extraction and the other kin publications were exclud-
ed. All included studies provided at minimum, individual data for EPA
and DHA and, if available, data for 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 20:0, 22:0, 24:0,
16:1n-7, 18:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 20:1n-9, 22:1n-9, 24:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-
6, 20:2n-6, 20:3n-6, 20:4n-6, 22:4n-6, 22:5n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3,
22:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 was also collected for further evaluation.
Age range was an extracted variable of interest that was not consis-
tently reported in all studies. Some studies, for example, reported age
only as N18 or as a population mean age. If an age range of the study par-
ticipants was not presented, the upper and lower limits of the age range
were calculated from the standard deviation by adding and subtracting
2 times the standard deviation from the mean age (2SD method). Stan-
dard deviations were calculated as needed. In some instances, generally
in studies with samples sizes less than 100 subjects (n = 15), the range
generated from 2SD method was inconsistent with recruited (e.g. age
consistent with young children in study of adults) or was an implausible
range – i.e. a negative age for the lower bound. In these instances, the
standard error of the mean was multiplied by the appropriate critical z
value and added and subtracted from the mean to determine 99.99%
confidence intervals that were used to establish the age range.
To ensure data integrity the spreadsheet containing all extracted
data was quality checked, assigned a version code and maintained
apart from the live/working spreadsheet to prevent any further chang-
es. If the live/working spreadsheet required modification in a manner
that would impact analytical outcomes the previously “locked” spread-
sheet was modified accordingly, assigned a new version code, and then
maintained as the “locked” dataset. The final locked dataset, used for
outcome summaries, was the third dataset in a series.
2.4. Search results
The original search yielded 877 references, supplemental searching
resulted in identification of an additional 47 references, of these 585
were excluded based on initial (Level I) screening of abstracts and/or ti-
tles (Fig. 1). The most common reasons for exclusion of studies at Level I
screening were participants with existing disease (38% of excludes)
133

 followed by studies that had no outcomes of interest or a lack a data on
individual fatty acids (29%). In addition, there were several studies ex-
cluded as the participants were pregnant/lactating (16%), children
(2.2%) or “other” (institutionalized, selected for low fish intakes, etc.)
populations (2.3%). Other exclusions included relationship to an
existing kin study already in the database (4.5%), inappropriate publica-
tion type (e.g. abstract) (4.3%), or irrelevant/unrelated studies (3.7%).
Full-text publications of 339 studies were retrieved for complete review
at Level II. At Level II, most studies were excluded for providing only
graphical data or not providing results for a blood fraction of interest
(Fig. 1). Although some studies had multiple reasons for exclusion,
each study was classified into only one exclusion category. A total of
298 studies were included [5,6,14,16–310] and a total of 626 studies
were excluded (Supplementary Table S2).
3. Converting fatty composition data to similar units for comparison
3.1. Converting fatty acid data to relative weight percentages
Extracted data was sorted into categories of blood fraction analyzed
and included plasma total lipids, plasma phospholipid, erythrocytes and
whole blood. Serum data was included in the appropriate plasma cate-
gories and erythrocyte phospholipid data was included in the erythro-
cyte category based on previous findings that the fatty acid
composition of plasma and serum [311] and of erythrocyte total lipid
and erythrocyte phospholipids [312] are similar, respectively. Within a
blood fraction, studies were also sorted according to the units used to
express the data. The units used fell into categories of relative quantifi-
cation (the weight or mole percentage of an individual fatty acid relative
to the total fatty acids) and absolute concentration (the concentration of
a fatty acid in a volume or mass of the blood fraction). The most com-
mon method of data expression was as the weight percentage of total
fatty acids (78% of the extracted data) while expression as mole percent
accounted for only 5% of the extracted data. Fatty acid weights
expressed in a blood fraction volume was the most common method
of expressing concentrations and accounted for 12% of the extracted
data with the units, μg of fatty acid/mL of blood being used most
commonly. Mole based concentrations accounted for only 5% of the
data extracted. Within blood fractions, the fatty acid composition of
plasma phospholipids, erythrocytes and whole blood were presented
mainly as relative percentages (92, 98 and 92%, respectively) while for
plasma total lipids the use of relative percentages was slightly lower
(62%) as the use of concentration units (mole and weight based) was
slightly more common (38% of data from this blood pool).
In order to facilitate comparisons, data was converted to relative
weight percentages within each blood fraction. This approach was
employed based on the fact that most of the data was already expressed
in this format and could not be converted to concentration data due to
the lack of quantitative information on fatty acid and blood fraction vol-
ume reported in the original publications. Concentration data that indi-
cated either the concentration of the sum of total fatty acids; the sums of
saturates, monounsaturates and polyunsaturates; or a comprehensive
list of the concentration of individual fatty acids were readily converted
to relative percentage data. Data expressed as mole concentrations was
converted to mass units using the molecular weight of individual fatty
acids and then converted into relative weight percentages. Fatty acid
compositions presented as mole percentages were converted by divid-
ing the mole percentage of an individual fatty acid by 100 and then mul-
tiplying by the respective fatty acid molecular weight to express the
data as g of individual fatty acids over the total sum of fatty acids in
moles. The individual fatty acids were summed to determine the total
sum of fatty acids in g over the total sum of fatty acids in moles. The
mass of each individual fatty acid over total sum of fatty acids in
moles was then divided by the mass of the total sum of fatty acids
over the moles of the total sum of fatty acid and multiplied by 100 to
convert the fatty acid composition to weight percentages. This conver-
sion method required comprehensive fatty acid profiles to complete.
Approximately 12% of the data extracted was converted (47/398 lines
of extracted data within our spreadsheet) to relative weight percent-
ages and 6.5% of the data could not be converted (26/398 lines of ex-
tracted data) due to the inability to determine the sum of total fatty
acids (usually no saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids reported).
Data not converted to relative weight percentages was not included in
the development of the global map of the sum of the percentages of
EPA+DHA, but this data is included in the summary tables.
3.2. Converting blood levels of EPA+DHA to erythrocyte based ranking
In order to compare the omega-3 PUFA status across the globe,
EPA+DHA in erythrocytes was selected over other omega-3 PUFA
blood biomarkers [311], as it has been well defined in the literature pre-
viously [313]. Therefore, it was necessary to convert the fatty acid com-
position data from different blood fractions to EPA+DHA equivalents to
generate a single, comprehensive global map. If EPA+DHA as a specific
sum was not presented in the original publication, it was calculated by
summing reports of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and added to the database.
The amount of data extracted from the literature was relatively equal
from plasma total lipid (33%), plasma phospholipids (32%) and erythro-
cytes (32%) while data from whole blood (3%) was relatively limited.
Within each blood fraction, data from each study was weighted by
study sample size, summed with studies from the same country and di-
viding by the sum of study sample sizes for that country. In order to
combine data from different blood fractions for each country, previously
published modeling and translation methods were applied [314]. These
methods indicate that converting continuous EPA+DHA in one blood
fraction to continuous data in another blood fraction is possible, but
that the degree of concordance is greater when discrete categories are
used for translation. Therefore, the categories used in this translation
study were derived from levels of EPA+DHA in erythrocytes associated
with high to low risk of death from coronary heart disease that were
presented when the “omega-3 index” was introduced [313]. The contin-
uous data was assigned to one of four discrete blood level groupings
that corresponded to EPA+DHA weight percentage values in
Fig. 1. Flow diagram of inclusion exclusion process.

 erythrocytes of ≤4 (very low), N4–6 (low), N6–8 (moderate), N8 (high).
Equivalent groupings for plasma total lipids [≤2.9 (very low), N2.9–4.0
(low), N4.0–5.2 (moderate), N5.2 (high)], plasma phospholipids [≤3.8
(very low), N3.8–5.7 (low), N5.7–7.6 (moderate), N7.6 (high)] and
whole blood [≤3.0 (very low), N3.0–4.4 (low), N4.4–5.9 (moderate),
N5.9 (high)] were determined according to equations as described pre-
viously [314]. Each grouping was assigned a categorical score (1 — very
low through 4 — high). The categorical scores for different blood frac-
tions were weighted by total number of participants for each blood frac-
tion and summed with the weighted values of other blood fractions for
each country. The sum of the weighted score values were then divided
by the sum of the samples sizes and rounded to the nearest whole num-
ber (1 — very low, 2 — low, 3 — moderate, 4 — high) to determine the
discrete category to represent the country. Data for individual studies
within a country were also ranked and compared to the blood level cat-
egory of their representative country as a check for potential regional
differences within a country. Large differences were observed between
the overall country rank with studies examining indigenous popula-
tions in Alaska (versus United States of America), Northern Canada
(versus Canada), a fishing region of South Africa (versus Cape Town)
and Northern Russia (versus Central Russia), as well as the Primorsky
Krai region of Russia (located on the Sea of Japan). These regions were
removed from country data and categorized to their own distinct re-
gion. The country blood level categories were assigned colors (very
low — red, low — orange, moderate — yellow, high — green, no data —
gray) that were used to generate a global heat map for blood levels of
EPA+DHA using a royalty-free vector map of the world image pur-
chased from Adobe Stock (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA
USA) that was modified using Adobe Illustrator CS6 ver. 16.03 (Adobe

4. Results
4.1. Included study characteristics
The main characteristics of the included studies are summarized in
Table 1. Epidemiologic observational studies provided the majority of
data points. The majority of studies enrolled subjects 20 years or older
with slightly more males than females. Plasma total lipid fatty acid com-
position totaled 131 lines of extracted data, representing 36, countries/
distinct regions with the USA having the most data reported with 27
lines followed by Japan with 20 data lines (Table 2). Plasma
phospholipid based data lines totaled 127 lines of data overall, with 31
countries/regions represented (Table 3). The USA had the most lines
of data reported at 18 followed by Canada with 14 lines of data. For
erythrocyte data, there were 128 lines of data, representing 33 coun-
tries/distinct regions (Table 4). China had 29 data lines, but 24 of
these data lines came from a single study [126] that examined the var-
ious provinces and municipalities across China. The USA had 17 lines of
data for erythrocytes. Whole blood data was limited to 12 lines of data
that represented 4 countries with 5 lines of data from the USA and 4
from Canada (Table 5).
Overall, data from 54 countries/distinct regions were identified but
the amount of data for a specific country varied widely. Studies conduct-
ed in North America contributed the most data points (n = 114 lines of
extracted data) followed by Asia (n = 96), Scandinavia (n = 73) and
countries within Europe (n = 71). In contrast, data from Central and
South America and Africa was limited. The USA had 67 lines of data in
total, which was by far the most data for a single country. Japan, China
and Canada had 32–35 lines of data, while Italy, France, the UK, Austra-
lia, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden had 10–20 lines of
data. It is concerning that for almost half of the countries/regions
(n = 26), there were only 2 (10 countries/regions) or 1 (16 countries/
regions) lines of data. When the data was examined according to sam-
ples size of the studies, Japan had the largest amount of individuals ex-
amined (n = 26,877) followed by the USA (n = 22,700). China, the UK,
Finland, France, Italy and Australia were countries with data collected
from more than 5000 individuals. Again, data from almost half of the
countries was based on limited data as 27 of the countries had data
that represented less than 300 individuals with 14 countries having
data from less than 100 individuals. There was an interesting pattern
where “normative” data for some countries was exceeded by data for
distinct populations. Sampling from Russia was particularly uneven
with a large study sample from the Primorsrky Krai region on the Sea
of Japan (n = 1174) and study samples on indigenous people living in
the north (n = 131 in total), while we could only recover limited data
for central Russia (n = 113). In South Africa, a fishing population in St.
Helena Bay (n = 25 subjects) was compared to urban Cape Town inhab-
itants (n = 25 subjects) [250]. The focus on distinct populations was
also observed in data from Canada as the number of individuals exam-
ined in a distinct Cree/Inuit region (n = 5087) was greater than the
number of individuals examined for the country as a whole (n =
4104). The only other example was studies examining the Alaskan
Yupik (n = 1573 subjects), but the number of total subjects
representing the general population of the USA was much larger
(n = 22,700).
4.2. Global distribution of EPA+DHA in human blood
Detailed fatty acid composition data for plasma total lipids, plasma
phospholipids, erythrocytes and whole blood extracted from the includ-
ed studies is presented by country within continental regions (Tables 2–
5). The data are presented as relative weight percentages whenever
possible with data that could not be converted included at the end of
each country list. The number of individual fatty acids reported in addi-
tion to EPA and DHA was variable across the studies. Values for 20:0,
22:0, 24:0, 18:1n-7, 20:1n-9, 22:1n-9, 24:1n-9, and 20:2n-6 were pre-
sented for less than 20% of the included data which is somewhat under-
standable given that they make up a relatively small percentage of the
total fatty acid composition. However, fatty acids that make up a consid-
erable percentage were also reported inconsistently, with 16:0, 18:0
and 18:1n-9 being reported for only 55% of the included data while
18:2n-6 and 20:4n-6 values were reported for 74% and 79% of the stud-
ies, respectively. The other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were also
poorly reported, with 18:3n-6 at 25%, 22:4n-6 at 31%, and 22:5n-6 at
23% of the total included data lines.
By rank assigning blood levels of EPA+DHA for each country and
assigning colors for very low (red), low (orange), moderate (yellow)

 “Western pattern” diets (Northern Russia, Alaska, Greenland, Papua
New Guinea, Fiji, Nigeria, and the St. Helena Bay region of South Africa).
Moderate blood levels of EPA+DHA (yellow) were observed in North-
ern Canada (Cree/Inuit populations), Chile, Iceland, Finland, Sweden,
Tunisia, Hong Kong, Mongolia and French Polynesia. Europe had eight
countries with low EPA+DHA blood levels (Belgium, Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Scotland, Spain, and The Netherlands) while countries
from the middle East (Israel), Asia (China, Russia, and Singapore), Oce-
ania (Australia and New Zealand) and Africa (South Africa and Tanza-
nia) were observed to have low levels as well. Very low blood levels
were observed in North America (Canada and USA), Central and South
America (Guatemala and Brazil), Europe (Ireland, UK, Italy, Greece, Ser-
bia, and Turkey), the Middle East (Iran and Bahrain), Southeast Asia
(India) and Africa (Kenya). The map also clearly indicates there are sev-
eral regions with little to no blood fatty acid data for adult populations
meeting our inclusion criteria (shaded in gray). This included most of
Africa and the Middle East, Mexico and Central America, a considerable
amount of South America, and most of Eastern Europe and Central and
Southeast Asia.
4.3. Global distribution of individual n-3 LCPUFA
The levels of the individual n-3 LCPUFA were also examined against
the EPA+DHA categories in the various blood fractions (Table 6). Each
data line was assigned a blood level group based on the methodology
used to determine groupings for the global map. Blood fractions were
kept separate in order to examine and compare the responses of the in-
dividual n-3 LCPUFA within blood fractions. The mean values of the per-
centages of EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid n-3 (DPAn-3, 22:5n-3)
within a blood level category for each blood fraction were calculated.
DPAn-3 values were not reported as frequently as EPA or DHA (see de-
tails in Table 6 footnotes). In order to assist in comparing the response of
EPA and DHA, the ratio of DHA to EPA, and the percentage of DHA in
EPA+DHA was calculated. In general, DHA was the dominant contribu-
tor to EPA+DHA, but the relative amount of EPA tended to increase
more as EPA+DHA status reached the highest category. The amount
of DHA relative to EPA also tended to be higher in the blood fractions
that were dominated by glycerophospholipids (plasma phospholipids
and erythrocytes), while blood fractions with triacylglycerols and
cholesteryl ester components (plasma total lipids and whole blood)
had slightly lower percentages of DHA. These latter blood fractions,
tended to show shifts towards an increasing relative amount of EPA as
EPA+DHA status increased as one ascended the categories, while the
relative amount of EPA did not increase in glycerophospholipid based
blood fractions until the high EPA+DHA blood level (green) was
reached. While DPAn-3 also appeared to increase with EPA+DHA sta-
tus, the increases tended to be relatively small in scale and absolute
amount.
5. Discussion
This is the first systematic review to examine blood levels of omega-
3 LCPUFA (specifically EPA+DHA) for different countries/distinct re-
gions on a global scale. While the present review reveals considerable
variability in blood levels of EPA+DHA, it also suggests that EPA+DHA
blood levels are in the very low to low range for most of the globe espe-
cially when the population size of the countries [315] with very low and
low blood levels of EPA+DHA are considered. There were several limi-
tations and challenges in generating a global map of blood levels of
EPA+DHA. This included numerous countries without data, data that

 was limited to small sample sizes or data that was excluded because it
did not meet criteria, but also the challenge of considerable variability
in how fatty acid “levels” are reported. In addition, implications of the
present findings in terms of dietary intake and health outcomes as
well as the challenge of increasing EPA+DHA blood levels must be con-
sidered. These topics will be taken up in the following sections.

 5.1. Countries with limited, excluded or no data
Data was not found for most of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America.
Based on the data in neighboring countries, it is most likely that blood
levels of EPA+DHA in Eastern Europe and Central Asia would fall in
the low to very low categories. Similarly, most of the countries in Central
and South America would most likely fall into the lower blood level cat-
egories, although some of the countries with large coastal populations
could fall into the higher categories. Africa might follow a similar pat-
tern as South America but the limited blood fatty acid data and the
small samples sizes reported for this continent make it difficult to pre-
dict. For countries of Southeast Asia for which we found no data, it is
possible that many of them would have blood EPA+DHA levels in the
higher categories. While these speculations are based on blood level
patterns in and surrounding these geographical regions, recently pub-
lished data on omega-3 PUFA intakes across the globe (see detailed dis-
cussion below in Section 5.3) appear to support these assumptions [4].
In addition to countries without blood level data, there are several
countries with blood levels that are based on limited numbers of studies
and small sample sizes. While this can be expected for small or develop-
ing countries, it is a concern when large countries, with large popula-
tions such as Russia and India have limited data. For some of the
countries with limited or no data in this review, fatty acid compositional
data of human blood exists, but not for the general adult population.
While some data was excluded due to the study of blood fatty acids in
morbidity or disease, several studies were excluded because the partic-
ipants were pregnant women or children. For example, data on erythro-
cyte levels of pregnant women in Mexico is available [316], but we were
unable to find data for the general adult population in Mexico. Also with
any systematic review, new studies meeting inclusion criteria may be
published after analysis is complete. However, new studies may not
change the global map assignments. For example, the EPA+DHA levels
recently presented in a large study (n = 826) examining the plasma
fatty acids of healthy students at the University of Toronto (Canada)
[317] confirm the global map assignment for Canada based on prior
data.
Finally, there was evidence of significant regional and cultural varia-
tion in blood levels of EPA+DHA within certain countries. In particular,
populations living on coastal regions of countries, and populations that
traditionally rely on hunting, fishing and gathering for sustenance
tended to have moderate to high blood levels of EPA+DHA. This latter
observation tends to be supported by assessments of changes in the
consumption of omega-3 PUFA in North America with the expansion
of and dependency on industrial scale agricultural practices [318]. It
was also interesting that there was a tendency of these populations to
be oversampled relative to the rest of the country, particularly in Russia,
but also in Canada. This could reflect a bias against funding towards the
collection of “normative” data that should be reconsidered, as standard
ranges are necessary as a reference for proper comparisons and estab-
lishing normal values.
5.2. Units for expressing fatty acid compositional data
The lack of a “gold standard” for measurement of fatty acid status in
human blood makes it very difficult to compare studies across the globe.
The lack of a standardized method for measurement was first highlight-
ed in 2004 by Harris and von Schacky when the omega-3 index was first
proposed [313]. At the time, erythrocytes were identified as the poten-
tial standard of the future, but a widespread shift to erythrocyte fatty
acid analysis has not occurred. This is partly based on logistical chal-
lenges with erythrocyte sample preparation and storage [319–321].
The diversity in the choice of units for reporting fatty acid data also re-
mains a challenge. Based on studies included in this systematic review,

K.D. Stark et al. / Progress in Lipid Research 63 (2016) 132–152
 the apparent preferred manner for presenting fatty acid data is as rela-
tive weight % of the total fatty acids. The advantage of relative percent-
age data is that it simplifies the comparisons of the complex interactions
between fatty acids competing for positions in the blood lipidome and
allows for an assessment of the “quality” of the fat. However, as a “rela-
tive” unit, percentage fatty acid data should be presented as full fatty
acid profiles to allow proper interpretation of the changes in the profile.
A limitation of relative percentage data is that it can obscure and poten-
tially mask changes in the size of lipid pools. In the blood of normal,
healthy adults, the changes in lipid pools in blood should be minimal
in erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids. However, the plasma total
lipid pool is subject to considerable biological variation even in healthy
populations based largely on lipoprotein status, particularly in the triac-
ylglycerol content even when fasting and feeding is controlled [191,314,
322]. The use of relative percentage units also presents a challenge for
performance elements and validation methods for standardized clinical
testing as limits of detection and repeatability are measures based on
absolute concentrations of individual analytes [323]. While the
omega-3 index increased awareness and the clinical use of omega-3
biomarkers [324], it has likely contributed to the practice of not present-
ing relative percentage data as full fatty acid profiles particularly in large
intervention trials focused on clinical outcomes [325,326]. The omega-3
index was initially described as the sum of the relative weight percent-
age of EPA+DHA with respect to the total fatty acids in erythrocytes
[313], but total fatty acids is a vague term and the sum total of fatty
acids can differ depending on the expertise of the chromatographer
and the little discussed practice of reporting data as total fatty acids
“identified” vs. total fatty acids that include peaks that were not identi-
fied (the sum of the total peak area). Also, total fatty acids available for
analyses can also be influenced by sample preparation techniques, par-
ticularly extraction and derivitization protocols [311], but also analytical
practices with gas chromatography and data handling such as the appli-
cation of response factors [327]. The increasing use of whole blood as
dried blood spots has further complicated the ability to standardize
“the omega-3 index” as whole blood measures are mathematically
translated based on calculations based on the relationship to the
omega-3 index in erythrocytes [328]. Unfortunately, detailed methodol-
ogies employed are not consistently reported in the literature. Therefore
a standardized measure of omega-3 status across laboratories capable of
fatty acid determinations does not currently exist and authors must be
encouraged to provide more details on how relative percentage data
were calculated. In addition, authors should be encouraged to include
an internal standard in their analyses so as to allow the report of the
concentration of total fatty acids in addition to the weight % data as it al-
lows for the conversion of fatty acid data between different units of
measure and therefore enables literature comparisons.
In this review, studies using the fatty acid composition of plasma
total lipid, plasma phospholipid, erythrocytes and whole blood were in-
cluded. Fatty acid data from serum fractions were considered equivalent
to data from plasma fractions, and data from erythrocyte phospholipids
and erythrocyte membrane preparations were considered equivalent to
data from erythrocytes. There are several other blood fractions that have
been examined in the literature, but they were not included in the pres-
ent review due to limited prevalence and an increased challenge to
translate the data to erythrocyte EPA+DHA equivalents. These include
mononuclear cells and platelets but also phosphatidylcholine,
cholesteryl ester, nonesterified fatty acid, and triacylglycerol fractions
in plasma [321,329]. The relationship between EPA+DHA levels in
cholesteryl ester, nonesterified fatty acid, and triacylglycerol fractions
in plasma and levels in erythrocytes has been shown to be weaker
than those between the pools examined presently [314]. Although, the
number of studies reporting whole blood EPA+DHA data were much
smaller, whole blood data was included as this type of analysis is in-
creasing and will likely become a very common method in the future
as dried blood spot blood collections enable economical high through-
put fatty acid profiling [311]. The ease of collection and processing for
dried blood spot sampling has great potential for field studies [191,
311,330,331] particularly in developing countries where scientific re-
sources are limited [332]. Dried blood spotting also has the potential
to solve challenges around the storage of blood samples [191,319,320].

 5.3. Diet and blood
Blood levels of EPA+DHA have long been known to correspond to
dietary intakes of EPA+DHA [139,190,333,334]. Recent studies exam-
ining the determinants of blood levels of EPA and DHA consistently in-
dicate that diet is the main predictor although other factors such as
age, smoking, sex, and physical activity are commonly identified as pre-
dictors as well [8–12]. In addition, genotyping studies have linked single
nucleotide polymorphisms of FADS1, FADS2, FADS3 and ELOVL2 [335–
337] to slightly increased levels of EPA+DHA. Recently a unique FADS
haplotype more efficient at biosynthesizing DHA has been identified
in humans as compared with hominid ancestors [335], and supports
the hypothesis that DHA was important for the evolution of the
human brain [338]. The complex relationship between dietary fatty
acid intake and blood levels of long chain PUFA including EPA and
DHA were first empirically defined by Lands et al. in rats [339], adapted
to humans [340] and then further revised as data from other
populations became available [341]. Despite these robust equations,
this previously defined relationship between dietary intake and blood
levels is often forgotten when examining increases in EPA+DHA in
blood relative to prescribed dose in dietary intervention studies [342].
Recently, the simple relationship between dietary EPA+DHA and
blood levels of EPA+DHA have been examined and it appears that sim-
ple linear equations can be used to define the blood-diet EPA+DHA for
intakes typical of Western populations and possibly higher intakes
[343].
Global intakes of dietary fats and oils derived from nutrition surveys
have been examined at the national level for adults recently that includ-
ed a map of seafood omega-3 fat intake [4]. As suspected, the seafood
omega-3 map shares several similarities with the map of blood levels
presented herein (Fig. 2), but there are also distinctive differences. The
seafood omega-3 fat intake is more comprehensive as intake data was
available for Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia,
Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, where we were unable

 to find EPA+DHA blood data, although the one exception was the in-
clusion of blood data for Greenland where no dietary survey data was
reported. While low to high blood categorizations tend to agree with
low to high diet intake categorizations, there were some notable excep-
tions. A disconnect between dietary intake and blood levels could be the
result of documented limitations of determining fatty acid intakes from
databases [5], but it may also be due to challenges in blood fatty acid
analysis. Countries with the highest seafood omega-3 intake consump-
tion included the Pacific island nations, the Mediterranean basin, Ice-
land, South Korea and Japan. Blood EPA+DHA levels were also high in
South Korea, Japan, and the few countries we had for Pacific island na-
tions, but blood levels of EPA+DHA for the Mediterranean basin were
low to very low while Iceland blood levels were moderate. Given dietary
levels, moderate blood levels of EPA+DHA for Iceland were somewhat
surprising and more data may be required to confirm this assessment.
One of the four studies for Iceland that indicated moderate blood levels
of EPA+DHA in erythrocytes stored the blood samples at −20 °C for
15 weeks [175] which is known to promote EPA+DHA losses [319].
However, prior to storage, butylated hydroxyltoluene was added to
the samples that have the potential to protect samples from decreases
in EPA+DHA [320,344]. In addition, one of the Icelandic studies was a
direct comparison to populations from Japan and Korea and while the
per capita consumption of fish and shellfish was the highest in Iceland,
measured blood levels of EPA+DHA were high in the Japan and South
Korea samples and moderate in the Iceland sample [252]. For the Med-
iterranean Basin, it is difficult to determine the cause of discrepancies
between intakes of seafood omega-3 fat and blood levels. Blood level
data was available from several studies for these countries. The low
blood levels could indicate a bias in regard to the type of populations
that were sampled. For example, blood sampling itself might lend itself
to urban centers where the chance of shifts away from more traditional
diets is increased. It may also reflect differences in how we categorized
blood levels relative to how dietary intake levels were categorized and
they do not necessarily match. Based on calculations from a recent
study examining the relationship between dietary intakes and blood
levels of EPA+DHA with a typical North American background diet
[343], intakes of approximately 200 mg/day EPA+DHA would be re-
quired to shift blood EPA+DHA levels from the very low (red) to low
(orange) blood levels and approximately 500 mg/day to shift to moder-
ate (yellow) blood levels. Obtaining high blood levels of EPA+DHA
(corresponding to N8% in erythrocytes) would appear to require at
least of 1250 mg/day EPA+DHA with a North American diet [343].
Background diet may influence this intake requirement as dietary
EPA+DHA intake estimates from Japan can range from 669 to
1120 mg/day in adult populations [345] while studies in the present re-
view reported EPA+DHA in erythrocytes ranging from 5.9 to 14.4%. The
highest category in the global seafood omega-3 fat intake mapping
study was N550 mg/day [4] which may not be high enough to discrim-
inate the global EPA+DHA status given that there are recommenda-
tions of ≥1000 mg/day EPA+DHA from more than one expert group
[346,347].
5.4. Potential consequences of low blood levels of EPA+DHA
Low blood and dietary intake of EPA+DHA can potentially increase
the risk of adverse health outcomes. While EPA+DHA is often present-
ed as a panacea, the strongest evidence for health benefits of increased
EPA+DHA status have been found for reducing the risk of coronary
heart disease and possibly total mortality, and for supporting fetal/in-
fant neurodevelopment [348,349] and the latter is mechanistically re-
lated to cognitive function throughout the lifespan. While there are no
Dietary Reference Intakes for EPA and DHA, it has been proposed [346,
348] and several expert groups and international bodies have
established recommendations that typically range from 250 mg/day to
500 mg/day EPA+DHA for general health and 500 mg/day to
≥1000 mg/day EPA+DHA for heart health as reviewed and discussed
previously [343,346,347]. These intake recommendations align closely
with the intakes associated with the erythrocyte blood level categories
that were used to develop the current global map, therefore we can con-
clude that global blood levels of EPA+DHA are also low as a result of in-
takes lower than expert group recommendations.
The initial observations focusing on different blood lipids in the
Greenland Inuit [350,351] suggested cardiovascular benefits of a marine
diet. The validity of the mortality records of the Greenland Inuit during
these initial observations been questioned in the past [352] and more
recently [353], but interpreting cardiovascular mortality prevalence in
Greenland during this period is challenging due to high rates of violent
death in males [354] and very high rates of smoking [355]. Autopsy
studies, although limited, have suggested that atherosclerosis is reduced
in Greenland and Alaskan natives as compared with non-natives [356,
357]. Nevertheless, these initial observations in Greenland led to inter-
vention studies examining oily fish intake [358] and fish oil

 supplementation [359] that established a link between EPA+DHA in-
take and reduced risk of coronary heart disease mortality with a major
proposed mechanism of a reduction in fatal arrhythmias and sudden
cardiac death. Various observational cohort studies that followed pro-
vided further support for the benefits of EPA+DHA by linking blood
levels of EPA+DHA to cardiac events [13,14,360]. Numerous mecha-
nisms appear to be responsible for the cardiovascular effects of EPA+-
DHA.
These
include
altering biophysics properties
of
cellular
membranes, modulating membrane proteins and ion transport,
influencing gene expression directly and indirectly and serving as sub-
strates for the production of potent metabolites or lipid mediators
[361]. With these multiple mechanisms, omega-3 LCPUFA therefore
have numerous physiological effects that have been confirmed by
meta-analyses and include reduced resting heart rate [362], influencing
heart rate variability [363], reduced blood pressure [364], reduced blood
triglycerides [365,366] and reduced thrombosis [361]. It has been pro-
posed that most of the benefit of EPA+DHA could be achieved with rel-
atively modest intakes of EPA+DHA (250–500 mg/day) [349] which
would be associated with modest increases in blood levels [343]. How-
ever, the reduction of secondary coronary events through EPA supple-
mentation in a Japanese population with a high background diet of
EPA+DHA [367] suggests higher dietary targets and blood levels
should be considered. A recent examination of the dietary intakes of
EPA+DHA and blood levels indicates that intakes of 250–500 mg/day
EPA+DHA do not increase blood EPA+DHA to levels associated with
reduced cardiac events in previous cohort studies [343]. Recently, the
benefits of EPA+DHA intake for reducing coronary heart disease mor-
tality have been questioned due to a lack of an effect in several recent
trials [325,326,368–370]. The recent clinical trials have been criticized
for being underpowered [371], low intervention doses [372], a lack of
attention to baseline intake of EPA+DHA [373,374] and for
overestimating adherence and compliance [7,373]. In addition, the rela-
tionship between EPA+DHA and arrhythmias has been shown to be in-
consistent which is in part due to considerable heterogeneity in study
populations and study design [375]. It has also been suggested that
the anti-arrhythmic effect may only be beneficial in life threatening is-
chemia-induced ventricular fibrillation and not recurrent ventricular
or atrial fibrillation [361].
EPA and DHA are important for cognitive function throughout the
lifespan (reviewed recently [376]). The importance of omega-3 PUFA
and DHA in particular in supporting neurological development and
function in humans was first established when the inclusion of alpha-
linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) in a total parental nutrition emulsion in-
creased DHA in serum phospholipid and corrected neurological symp-
toms that had developed during parental nutrition without ALA [377].
In adults, there is evidence that EPA and DHA may support or improve
cognitive function but study results are not consistent and appear to
be dependent on the type of the cognitive test, baseline cognitive func-
tion and dose and timing of EPA+DHA intake [346,376,378]. Low levels
of plasma EPA and DHA were first observed in individuals with
Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia and cognitive impairment
in 2000 [379] and an association between blood levels of EPA and DHA
and dementia has been confirmed [380]. Higher blood DHA (DHA in
plasma phosphatidylcholine) has been associated with reduced risk of
all-cause dementia in a prospective follow-up study [15]. Intervention
trials with EPA and/or DHA in individuals with Alzheimer's disease
have typically shown no benefit [381], except in Alzheimer's patients
with very mild cognitive dysfunction [382]. A recent meta-analysis has
indicated that supplementation with EPA+DHA N1 g/day can improve
immediate recall or episodic memory in individuals with mild memory
complaints but not those with no complaints [378]. It also appears that
sex of the subject may influence results as women may receive more
benefits in episodic memory while men benefit more from reaction
time and working memory [383] although body weight differences be-
tween sexes might result in different effective dosing of EPA and DHA
[384].
Cost-effectiveness assessment for the use of omega-3 PUFA treat-
ment completed using outcomes from the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio
della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto (GISSI) Prevenzione Trial estimated
that omega-3 PUFA was cost-effective [385,386] and the cost-effective-
ness was similar to other drugs prescribed at the time (simvastatin and
pravastatin) [386]. These assessments expanded to other studies and
countries for confirmation [387,388]. The GISSI Prevenzione [359] and
the GISSI heart failure [389] trials were also used to determine the
cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical grade EPA+DHA in the ethyl
ester form [390,391]. EPA+DHA use was also determined to be cost-ef-
fective in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia [392]. More recently
the use of EPA only omega-3 supplementation for secondary prevention
of cardiovascular disease [393] and reducing the incidence of coronary
heart disease in the elderly in Korea [394] have been associated with
cost savings. Cost-savings with omega-3 supplementation have also
been predicted in populations receiving parental nutrition [395,396]
and with perioperative strategies to reduce surgical morbidity in pa-
tients with gastrointestinal cancer [397,398]. Although pregnant
women were not included in the present analysis, low blood levels of
EPA+DHA in pregnant women has been documented [399,400] and a
recent econometric analysis also indicated that DHA supplementation
of pregnant women could save the Australian public hospital system be-
tween 15 and 51 million Australian dollars per year [401].
5.5. The challenge of increasing blood EPA+DHA levels through dietary
intakes
It is important to evaluate the feasibility of supplying the world's
population with the recommended amounts of EPA and DHA. That is,
to determine whether there are adequate sources of EPA and DHA avail-
able to support, for example, shifting all countries and regions to the
green category, a level of N8% EPA+DHA in their erythrocytes or the
equivalent in other blood fractions. The main dietary source of EPA
and DHA is fish and other marine foods [8,9,11,402]. Of course, this
may be supplied by fortified foods or supplements as well. A recent
analysis of omega-3 fatty acid sources has been recently published
[347]. It is clear from this and other such analyses that the total fish
availability had plateaued by the early 1990's and is inelastic [403].
Aquaculture has steadily increased relative to the wild fish catch but
most such species still depend upon dietary fish oil supplementation
from the wild catch, and thus the total cannot at present be increased
substantially. It was estimated that for the world's population of 7.2 bil-
lion people, to supply 500 mg/day of DHA+EPA would require
1.3 million metric tons of EPA+DHA per annum. Human consumption
is now approximately 200 thousand metric tons, enough to supply 500
mg/day of EPA+DHA to only 15% of the world's population. In order to
raise the world's population into the green range, it was estimated
above that 1250 mg/day of EPA+DHA would be required and at this
level of intake, a total of 3.12 million metric tons of EPA+DHA would
be needed every year. At this higher level of intake, the present produc-
tion would only support about 6% of the population.
How then might the omega-3 supply be increased to support health-
ful blood levels of EPA and DHA? One suggestion has been to increase
the consumption of ALA, the precursor of EPA and DHA as there is an
abundant supply of this fatty acid in vegetable oils. However, the
human conversion to EPA is limited and conversion to DHA is very
low [404] such that supplementation studies with ALA in humans
have shown little increases in EPA and DHA [405]. There is the potential
to increase the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA by reducing the in-
take of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) [340]. However, in order to achieve
high (N8% in erythrocytes) blood levels of EPA+DHA, total PUFA intake
levels would have to be drastically reduced (b2% of total energy) to
minimize competition for Δ6 desaturation [406] and removing
omega-6 PUFA would be controversial. This would also have a major

 replacing types of fatty acids in the industrial food supply is a challeng-
ing and problematic endeavour [407]. The reduction in linoleic acid in-
take also serves to increase EPA and DHA content of tissues due to a
lower competition for incorporation into complex lipids [408]. In any
case, preformed sources of EPA and particularly of DHA are required
for the human diet to reach high blood levels of EPA+DHA, perhaps
in combination with lower linoleic acid intake.
It is certainly possible to increase heterotrophic fermentation of mi-
croorganisms such as Schizochytrium [409] and other Thraustochytrids
[410] to make both EPA and DHA. Although there are economic hurtles
for this source vs. fish oils, an economy of scale could significantly lower
price and make it more generally accessible [347]. Algal biomass can be
used for aquaculture and animal feed rather than the extracted oil, as
well, supplying a lower cost but efficacious source of EPA and DHA. An-
other possible source of EPA and DHA in the near future could be de-
rived from genetically modified oilseed crops such as canola or
soybeans [411]. Petrie et al., have estimated that there is an EPA/DHA
equivalence of one hectare of Brassica napus to 10,000 fish based on
an omega-3 content that has already been achieved in lab trials [412].
Although genetically modified food sources are not widely accepted at
this time, genome sequences for producing omega-3 LCPUFA have
been identified [413]. One could envisage an initial use in animal feed
and aquaculture, but also the development of productive EPA+DHA
microorganisms such that enriched foods and oils could be generated
on a much larger scale in order to potentially supply enough EPA and
DHA for the world's population.
6. Concluding remarks
Blood levels of EPA+DHA are variable across the globe, with most of
the countries and regions of the world having levels that are considered
low to very low. While the global mapping of blood levels of EPA+DHA
tend to agree with previous assessments of dietary intake of omega-3
PUFA from seafood [4], blood levels are less error prone and thus
blood level targets can be better linked to specific chronic disease out-
comes and events. The low and very low bloods levels observed for
most of the globe are associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular
related mortality based on previous observational studies [13,14]. It is
also highly likely that increased blood levels of EPA+DHA across the
globe would reduce the risk of cognitive decline with normal aging,
but further evidence is needed to identify specific blood level targets
[346,376]. It is also clear that data on blood levels of EPA+DHA is need-
ed for large regions of the globe, particularly for developing countries.
Efforts to establish reference ranges in blood levels of fatty acids is need-
ed and this data would complement existing information on dietary in-
take but fatty acid data can also serve as phenotype information for
genome wide association studies. Given the challenges of fatty acid
analyses and reporting, an international initiative should be considered
to lead to standardized approaches and the development of a systematic
database.
