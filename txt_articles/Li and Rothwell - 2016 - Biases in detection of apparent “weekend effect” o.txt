Biases in detection of apparent “weekend effect” on outcome 
with administrative coding data: population based study of stroke
Linxin Li, Peter M Rothwell; on behalf of the Oxford Vascular Study
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To determine the accuracy of coding of admissions for 
stroke on weekdays versus weekends and any impact 
on apparent outcome.
Design
Prospective population based stroke incidence study 
and a scoping review of previous studies of weekend 
effects in stroke.
setting
Primary and secondary care of all individuals 
registered with nine general practices in Oxfordshire, 
United Kingdom (OXVASC, the Oxford Vascular Study).
PartiCiPants
All patients with clinically confirmed acute stroke in 
OXVASC identified with multiple overlapping methods 
of ascertainment in 2002-14 versus all acute stroke 
admissions identified by hospital diagnostic and 
mortality coding alone during the same period.
Main OutCOMes Measures
Accuracy of administrative coding data for all patients 
with confirmed stroke admitted to hospital in OXVASC. 
Difference between rates of “false positive” or “false 
negative” coding for weekday and weekend 
admissions. Impact of inaccurate coding on apparent 
case fatality at 30 days in weekday versus weekend 
admissions. Weekend effects on outcomes in patients 
with confirmed stroke admitted to hospital in OXVASC 
and impacts of other potential biases compared with 
those in the scoping review.
results
Among 92 728 study population, 2373 episodes of 
acute stroke were ascertained in OXVASC, of which 
826 (34.8%) mainly minor events were managed 
without hospital admission, 60 (2.5%) occurred out of 
the area or abroad, and 195 (8.2%) occurred in hospital 
during an admission for a different reason. Of 1292 
local hospital admissions for acute stroke, 973 (75.3%) 
were correctly identified by administrative coding. 
There was no bias in distribution of weekend versus 
weekday admission of the 319 strokes missed by 
coding. Of 1693 admissions for stroke identified by 
coding, 1055 (62.3%) were confirmed to be acute 
strokes after case adjudication. Among the 638 false 
positive coded cases, patients were more likely to be 
admitted on weekdays than at weekends (536 (41.0%) 
v 102 (26.5%); P<0.001), partly because of weekday 
elective admissions after previous stroke being 
miscoded as new stroke episodes (267 (49.8%) v 26 
(25.5%); P<0.001). The 30 day case fatality after these 
elective admissions was lower than after confirmed 
acute stroke admissions (11 (3.8%) v 233 (22.1%); 
P<0.001). Consequently, relative 30 day case fatality 
for weekend versus weekday admissions differed 
(P<0.001) between correctly coded acute stroke 
admissions and false positive coding cases. Results 
were consistent when only the 1327 emergency cases 
identified by “admission method” from coding were 
included, with more false positive cases with low case 
fatality (35 (14.7%)) being included for weekday versus 
weekend admissions (190 (19.5%) v 48 (13.7%), 
P<0.02). Among all acute stroke admissions in 
OXVASC, there was no imbalance in baseline stroke 
severity for weekends versus weekdays and no 
difference in case fatality at 30 days (adjusted odds 
ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.15; 
P=0.30) or any adverse “weekend effect” on modified 
Rankin score at 30 days (0.78, 0.61 to 0.99; P=0.04) or 
one year (0.76, 0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03) among incident 
strokes.
COnClusiOn
Retrospective studies of UK administrative hospital 
coding data to determine “weekend effects” on 
outcome in acute medical conditions, such as stroke, 
can be undermined by inaccurate coding, which can 
introduce biases that cannot be reliably dealt with by 
adjustment for case mix.
Introduction
Many studies across different diseases have assessed 
whether there is a higher death rate after admission to 
hospital during the weekend (the “weekend effect”), 
with conflicting results.1-6 The existence of a weekend 
effect would have important implications for patients, 
clinicians, and policy makers, and media coverage 
might deter patients from seeking medical attention at 
the weekend. Most previous studies that have 
attempted to study the effect, however, have used only 
routinely collected administrative data from hospital 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
There is conflicting evidence as to whether mortality is higher during weekend 
compared with weekday admissions to hospital
Many of the previous studies assessing the weekend effect were based on 
administrative coding data alone, but the possibility that the accuracy of coding 
data might differ between weekend and weekday admissions has not previously 
been assessed
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
While unmeasured imbalances in baseline case mix, such as event severity and 
inpatient behaviour, are potential biases in reporting of the weekend effect, the 
main bias in coding based studies of stroke is inaccuracy of coding data (at least in 
the UK), particularly the inclusion as weekday admissions of false positive cases 
with low expected case fatality 
Similar biases are likely to occur in studies of the weekend effect in acute 
admissions for other conditions for which administrative diagnostic coding is prone 
to inaccuracy

diagnostic coding,1-5 and few were able to quantify dif-
ferences in the severity of the baseline event between 
weekday and weekend admissions.6 
7
Acute stroke has been most often used to study the 
weekend effect perhaps because of its high early mor-
tality and the proved impact of quality and intensity of 
care on outcome.8  Reports of a weekend effect on 
stroke outcome have also been conflicting, but recent 
data on case fatality in acute hospital admissions in 
the United Kingdom, including stroke, have been used 
to inform proposed policy changes in provision of 
weekend  
service.3  This work, and most previous stud-
ies in the UK, however, was based on routinely collected 
 
administrative coding data, which can be inaccurate.9-14 
Indeed, the highest rates of inaccurate coding are 
found for acute medical admissions,13 14 partly because 
patients are often elderly and have multiple active 
problems. This group of patients also has high short 
term mortality for the same reasons and will often 
“drive” analyses of weekend effects. Such analyses 
would therefore be expected to be particularly suscep-
tible to biases secondary to coding errors.
No study has determined whether there are any dif-
ferences in accuracy of coding for weekday and week-
end admissions for acute stroke or any other condition. 
If any such differential accuracy of coding was also 
related to case fatality then it could explain apparent 
weekend effects. In particular, “false positive” coding, 
such as elective admissions after stroke or non-stroke 
admissions being coded as acute stroke admissions, 
could be particularly problematic but difficult to detect 
without prospective validation of all events. We there-
fore carried out a prospective population based study of 
the accuracy of hospital coding in acute stroke admis-
sions on weekdays and at weekends and the potential 
impact of any inaccuracies on apparent outcome. We 
also assessed patient behaviour (that is, seeking medi-
cal attention) and other potential biases that might lead 
to apparent weekend effect and carried out a scoping 
review of previous studies of weekend effects in stroke.
Methods
The Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) is an ongoing 
population based study of the incidence and outcome 
of all acute vascular events.15  The study population 
comprises all 92 728 individuals, irrespective of age, reg-
istered with about 100 general practitioners (GPs) in 
nine general practices in Oxfordshire, UK. Multiple 
overlapping methods of “hot” and “cold” pursuit were 
used to achieve near complete ascertainment of all indi-
viduals with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or 
stroke.15 16  These include daily rapid access “TIA and 
stroke clinic” to which participating GPs and the local 
emergency department refer individuals with suspected 
TIA or minor stroke; daily searches of admissions to the 
medical, stroke, neurology, and other relevant wards, 
also including screening all patients undergoing elec-
tive or emergency coronary, carotid, or peripheral vas-
cular investigations or interventions; daily searches of 
the attendance register of the local emergency depart-
ment; daily searches of records of deaths in hospital 
through the bereavement office; monthly searches of all 
death certificates and coroner’s reports for deaths out-
side hospital; monthly searches of GP diagnostic cod-
ing and hospital discharge codes (ICD-10 (international 
classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes I60-I68, 
G45-G46, H34); and monthly searches of all brain and 
vascular imaging referrals. Stroke was defined as rapid 
onset symptoms and/or signs of focal, and at times 
global, loss of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting 
more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no appar-
ent cause other than of vascular origin.15
Study physicians saw patients as soon as possible 
after the initial presentation to determine dates and 
times of symptom onset, when medical attention was 
sought, and when patients were admitted to hospital or 
assessed in an outpatient clinic. Baseline demographic 
data, vascular risk factors, and other comorbidities 
were collected from face-to-face interview and cross ref-
erenced with primary care records. Detailed clinical 
history was recorded in all patients and assessments 
were made for stroke severity with the National Insti-
tute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Major stroke was 
defined as a score of ≥5. Patients routinely had brain 
imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI)), vascular imaging (carotid Dop-
pler or CT angiography/MRI angiography or digital 
subtraction angiography), 12 lead electrocardiography 
and standard blood tests. Echocardiography, 24 hour 
electrocardiography (HOLTER), and five day ambula-
tory electrocardiographic monitoring were done when 
clinically indicated. If a patient died before assessment, 
we obtained an eyewitness account of the clinical event 
and reviewed any relevant records. A senior neurologist 
(PMR) reviewed all cases for final adjudication, and rea-
sons for exclusion were recorded.
A study nurse or physician followed up all patients 
face-to-face at 1, 6, 12, 60, and 120 months to determine 
recurrent strokes and functional status (modified 
Rankin scale, mRS). Patients who had moved out of the 
study area were followed up by telephone. All patients 
were flagged for Office for National Statistics mortality 
data, and all deaths during follow-up were recorded 
with causes. All patients with recurrent strokes who 
presented to medical attention would also be identified 
by the ongoing daily case ascertainment. If a recurrent 
stroke was suspected, a study physician re-assessed 
and investigated the patient.
statistical analyses
For all strokes ascertained in OXVASC in 2002-14 we 
compared the completeness of case ascertainment 
when only hospital discharge coding data were used 
versus when all sources were used and all events were 
adjudicated. As part of the “cold pursuit” methods in 
OXVASC, clinical adjudication was performed for all 
potential cases identified from hospital discharge cod-
ing with ICD-10 codes I60-I68, G45-G46, and H34 at any 
diagnostic position, however, for the purpose of the 
current study, and particularly to avoid overestimation 
of false positive cases, we considered only cases identi-
fied by codes I60-I68 as the primary diagnosis for

coding identified cases. We also reported the number of 
false negative cases that could be identified by coding if 
other diagnostic positions were used.
The weekend was defined as the period from mid-
night on Friday to midnight on Sunday. All other times 
were defined as weekdays.1 We compared all the 
admissions for stroke in the study population identi-
fied by coding only with all adjudicated OXVASC 
strokes ascertained in the same period (2002-14) and 
compared the differences in accuracy (false negative 
and false positive cases) and reasons for inaccurate 
coding between weekday and weekend admissions 
using χ2 test. We calculated the 30 day case fatality (%) 
using coding data only and compared the impact of 
different coding selection criteria on 30 day case fatal-
ity between weekday and weekend admissions. Sensi-
tivity analyses confined to ICD-10 codes I60-I64 or I60, 
I61, I62.9, I63, and I64 were performed. We also further 
applied the additional information on admission 
method (elective v emergency) from coding and 
included only coding identified emergency admissions 
for sensitivity analyses.
For all incident strokes in OXVASC, we compared day 
of the week of onset versus day of the week when medi-
cal attention was sought, stratified by severity of stroke 
(minor v major) using Poisson regression analyses. For 
all OXVASC patients with stroke who were admitted to 
hospital, we used χ2 test to compare the case fatality at 
seven days and 30 days between weekend and weekday 
admissions. Logistic regression analysis was used to 
adjust for age, sex, baseline disability, and event sever-
ity (NIHSS at baseline). Sensitivity analyses including 
only incident strokes were also performed. Using data 
on functional status (modified Rankin score) at fol-
low-up for all patients with incident stroke, we also 
used ordinal regression analysis to compare the status 
of patients admitted at the weekend and weekdays 
adjusted for age, sex, baseline disability, and event 
severity (NIHSS).
All analyses were performed with SPSS version 20.
search strategy and data extraction for scoping 
review
We searched PubMed for articles on weekend effect in 
hospital admissions for stroke published from January 
2000 to February 2016, using the search terms “stroke”, 
“cerebrovascular disease”, “weekend effect”, “week-
end”, “off-hour”, and “outcome”. We also reviewed the 
references of all identified studies. We included any 
study that reported the short term (in hospital; seven 
day or 30 day) outcome (death or functional outcome) 
of patients admitted with stroke by day of the week 
(that is, weekdays versus weekend; workings hour ver-
sus out of hours). Studies that reported only the service 
differences by day of the week or studies that were 
restricted to patients with stroke undergoing thrombol-
ysis or endovascular treatment were excluded. There 
was no language restriction. For each study, we 
extracted details on general study characteristics (study 
name, study period, year of publication, and study 
type), information on the study population (country, 
number of patients included, and patient demograph-
ics), and details on the outcome measure (death or 
functional outcome). Moreover, we documented the 
following factors that could potentially bias the 
observed weekend effect: source of the study dataset, 
descriptions of the ICD codes used if data source 
included administrative coding data, and if information 
on admission method was used for the administrative 
dataset to exclude elective/scheduled admissions; how 
readmission after the first stroke admission was dealt 
with; whether stroke severity was assessed; and 
whether comorbidities of the patients were measured.
Among all eligible studies, we used χ2 test to investi-
gate the associations of reporting a weekend effect and 
different study characteristics (that is, study popula-
tion, study period, data source, whether event severity 
was assessed and whether comorbidity was adjusted 
for). Given the potential impact of unmeasured case mix 
factors at baseline (such as imbalance of age, baseline 
disability, and severity of stroke in weekday versus 
weekend admissions) on the weekend effect, we carried 
out a pooled analyses including only clinical registries 
with detailed measurement of case severity using Man-
tel-Haenzel-Peto method (random effect). We included 
all reported adjusted odds ratios for short term outcome 
(death) in weekend versus weekday comparisons when 
possible. For studies that did not report any adjusted 
estimate, we used unadjusted odds ratios.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
recruitment or the design and implementation of the 
study. There are no plans to involve patients in the dis-
semination of results.
Results
Among the 92 728 patients in the study population, 2373 
strokes were ascertained in OXVASC for 2002-14, of 
which 826 (34.8%) were managed in clinic or at home 
and 60 (2.5%) happened out of the area or abroad and 
would therefore not be identified if only coding data 
were used. A further 195 strokes (8.2%) happened during 
admissions for another reason and were coded with the 
date of the admission for the initial diagnosis. Among 
the 1292 remaining patients who were admitted to the 
local hospital for acute stroke, only 973 (75.3%) were 
identified by coding. There was no bias in distribution of 
weekend and weekday admission for the 319 strokes 
missed by coding—that is, false negatives (227 (24.1%) 
on weekday v 92 (26.2%) at weekend; P=0.44). Table 1 
 
shows the reasons for strokes not being identified by 
coding. Results were similar in the analysis confined to 
incident strokes ascertained in OXVASC (table 1).
There were 1693 admissions for stroke identified by 
hospital discharge coding, among which 290 (17.1%) 
episodes were recurrent admissions for stroke after the 
first admission. After case adjudication, 1055 (62.3%) 
events were considered to be accurate, among which 
53 (3.1%) were in patients who had already been man-
aged by physicians in the emergency department on

the previous day while the patient was waiting to be 
admitted to a ward. False positive diagnostic coding 
was more common in admissions on weekdays than at 
the weekend (536 (41.0%) v 102 (26.5%); P<0.001). 
Among the 638 false positive cases, the reasons for 
inaccurate coding also differed between weekdays and 
weekend admissions (table 2), with more admissions 
for investigation or procedure for previous stroke mis-
coded as new acute stroke episodes on weekdays 
(34.1% v 12.7%, P<0.001; table 2) and more inaccurate 
admission dates recorded for weekend admissions 
(25.5% v 8.6%; P<0.001; table 2). Sensitivity analyses 
confined to ICD-10 codes I60-I64 (table A in appendix 
1) or I60, I61, I62.9, I63, and I64 (table B in appendix 1) 
showed consistent results.
For all episodes identified by coding, there were 299 
deaths at 30 days after hospital admission. Table 2

accuracy. The 30 day case fatality differed significantly 
between accurate and false positive cases, with signifi-
cantly lower mortality for the false positive cases (66 
(10.3%) v 233 (22.1%); P<0.001; table 2 ), particularly for 
the miscoded elective admissions (11 (3.8%), table 2 ). 
As a result, weekday admission mortality changed with 
different case selection criteria, with the 30 day case 
fatality increased from 17
.5% when all episodes were 
included to 22.9% when only stroke admissions that 
were correctly coded were included (P=0.001, fig 1 ). On 
the contrary, the case fatality at 30 days did not differ 
significantly for weekend admissions based on the 
selection criteria (P=0.59, fig 1 ). Moreover, when there 
were multiple admissions for a single patient, changing 
the selection criteria from the last admission to the first 
admission reversed the apparent weekend effect (fig 1).
In addition to the use of standard ICD-10 codes to 
identify stroke admissions, method of admission (that 
is, elective v emergency), when available, could also be 
used to reduce the false positive rate. Among the 1661 
(98.1%) cases with admission method adjudicated by 
OXVASC, the overall accuracy for coding to record the 
admission method was good (1564, 94.2%). Among the 
1327 emergency admissions for stroke identified by cod-
ing (79.9% of all admissions), however, 238 (17
.9%) were 
false positive cases with low expected case fatality, 
including 40 elective admissions that were miscoded as 
emergency cases and 198 non-stroke acute admissions 
(admissions for transient ischaemic attack, headache 
with negative imaging, amaurosis fugax, or chronic 
small vessel disease; table C in appendix 1). As 
expected, the 30 day case fatality in these 238 cases was 
significantly lower than in the true cases (35/238 (14.7%) 
v 231/1042 (22.2%); P=0.01; table C in appendix 1). More 
importantly, there were significantly more cases with 
low expected case fatality in weekday than in weekend 
admissions (190/976 (19.5%) v 48/351 (13.7%); P<0.02; 
table C in appendix 1). Similarly, although the number 
was small (47
, 3.5%; table C in appendix 1) for false 
 
positive cases with high expected case fatality (that is, 
acute stroke that happened during an inpatient 
 
admission for other acute diseases), there were more 
cases of high expected case fatality being miscoded as 
acute stroke at weekends (22 (6.3%) at weekend v 25 
(2.6%) on weekday; P=0.001; table C in appendix 1).
Another potential bias with the use of administrative 
coding data alone would be unbalanced event severity 
for weekday versus weekend admissions because of dif-
ferences in patient behaviour. For all incident strokes 
ascertained by OXVASC, we recorded the day of the 
week of onset and the day when medical attention was 
sought. Day of onset was uniform (P=0.70; fig 2 ), but 
patients were less likely to present for medical attention 
at the weekend than on weekdays (P<0.001; fig 3 ). 
When the analysis was stratified by severity of stroke, 
patients with major strokes were equally likely to pres-
ent for medical attention on weekdays and at the week-
end (P=0.51; fig 3 ), while those with minor strokes were 
less likely to present at the weekends (P<0.001; fig 3). 
Therefore, among all strokes in patients who presented 
for medical attention, there were proportionally more 
major strokes at the weekend than on weekdays (165 
(42.9%) v 471 (35.6%), odds ratio 1.36, 95% confidence 
interval 1.08 to 1.71; P=0.01). While patients with major 
stroke tended to use emergency services (directly

ambulance) equally when presenting during the week-
end and weekdays (125/75.8% v 332/70.5%; P=0.20), 
those with minor events were more likely to use emer-
gency services when they presented at the weekend (119 
(54.1%) v 216 (25.4%); P<0.001) and were thus more 
likely to be admitted to hospital (fig 3). Therefore among 
patients admitted to hospital, the proportion with 
major stroke did not differ between weekday and week-
end admissions (392 (52.4%) v 149 (51.4%); P=0.77). 
There was also no imbalance in the distribution of 
NIHSS at presentation on weekday versus weekend 
admissions (fig 4 and fig B in appendix 2).
Among all stroke admissions ascertained in OXVASC, 
we found no difference in case fatality for weekend and 
weekday admissions at seven days (odds ratio 0.87
, 95% 
confidence interval 0.62 to 1.21; P=0.40; table 3 ) or at 30 
days (0.90, 0.68 to 1.19; P=0.46; table 3 ). Results were 
similar after adjustment for age, sex, and severity of 
event (table 3 ). Analysis that excluded deaths in the 
emergency department and strokes in inpatients and 
analysis that included only incident strokes showed 
similar results (table 3 ). Moreover, we did not find any 
adverse weekend effect on the modified Rankin scale at 
one month (adjusted odds ratio 0.78, 0.61 to 0.99; 
P=0.04; fig 5 and fig A in appendix 2) or one year (0.76, 
0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03) among incident strokes.
Among the 42 studies we identified in our scoping 
review that assessed if there was a weekend effect for 
patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke, 19 
(45.2%) found a significant effect. Appendix 3 lists 
details of the studies. Most studies (n=39, 92.9%) were 
carried out after the introduction of stroke unit care. 
More than half (n=22, 52.4%) used administrative data 
only, particularly the studies published in the UK (six of 
seven studies). Although most studies adjusted for 
comorbidity (n=33, 78.6%), less than half (n=17
, 40.4%) 
measured stroke severity. Compared with clinical regis-
tries, studies that used only administrative coding 
 
dataset were more likely to report a weekend effect 
(68% v 20%; P=0.002; table 4), while studies that 
adjusted for event severity were less likely to find a 
weekend effect than studies with no measurement of 
stroke severity (18% v 64%; P=0.003; table 4 ). In the 16 
clinical registry studies that adjusted for event severity, 
only three (19%) reported a weekend effect. Moreover, 
in the pooled analysis, when only clinical registries 
with balanced baseline characteristics in weekend ver-
sus weekday admissions were included, we also found 
no weekend effect (pooled odds ratio 0.94, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.80 to 1.10; P=0.45; table 5).
discussion 
We identified several potential biases in detection of 
apparent “weekend effects” in outcome of stroke. 
Firstly, whereas patients with major stroke presented 
uniformly throughout the week, patients with minor 
stroke were less likely to present at the weekend. This 
could potentially affect weekday and weekend out-
comes depending on local admission policies through-
out the week. Secondly, about a third of patients with 
stroke were managed as outpatients and would not be 
identified by hospital coding. Thirdly, among all 
patients with stroke who were admitted to hospital, 
more than a third of the subsequent administrative

diagnostic codes were inaccurate. Crucially, the rate of 
false positive coding differed between weekday and 
weekend admissions, with more elective weekday 
admissions with a low expected case fatality being mis-
coded as acute stroke. Although admission method, 
when available, could be used to reduce the false posi-
tive rate to some extent, there were still more cases with 
low expected case fatality being miscoded as acute 
stroke when only admissions coded as emergency were 
included. It is noteworthy, therefore, that in our scoping 
review of previous studies, the finding of a weekend 
effect was associated with studies that used only 
administrative coding. In contrast, no weekend effect 
on short term case fatality was apparent in prospective 
cohorts with clinical adjudication of stroke diagnosis 
that did not have an imbalance in severity of stroke on 
admission.
The finding of inaccuracy of hospital diagnostic cod-
ing is in line with findings in previous studies of acute 
admissions, with low sensitivity and specificity of cod-
ing data reported in cardiovascular disease,17 18  aortic 
aneurysm,9  peripheral vascular disease,10  general sur-
gery,11  and stroke.12-23 The process and quality of coding 
varies from country to country. In the UK, hospital diag-
nostic coding is often done by non-clinical clerical staff 
and largely depends on their interpretation of medical 
notes and application of appropriate codes. The actual 
reason for the acute admission is not always clear in 
patients with multiple comorbidities, and elective 
admissions for investigation or management of previ-
ous disease are sometimes miscoded as admissions for 
acute events. Importantly in relation to studies of week-
end effects, we found that the reasons for inaccurate 
coding differed between weekday and weekend admis-
sions, with more weekday admissions with low risk of 
mortality being miscoded as acute stroke. Low risk 
admissions, such as elective procedures or investiga-
tions for previous TIA or stroke, were most likely to 
occur during weekdays, thereby reducing the overall 
case fatality of weekday admissions, resulting in an 
apparent weekend effect for stroke outcome if it is based 
on coding data alone.
One way to overcome the bias caused by the inclu-
sion of elective cases according to coding data alone is 
to use the “admission method” information to exclude 
all elective admissions. Only six previous studies, how-
ever, reported that they applied this method (appendix 
1). Although three out of the six studies still found a 
weekend effect, two reported only the results for all dis-
ease conditions combined but not for acute stroke spe-
cifically (appendix 1). Only one of the four studies that 
included only emergency admissions for stroke found a 
weekend effect. As expected, the admission method can 
also be recorded incorrectly. In our study, nearly 13% of 
true elective admissions were coded as emergency. 
Although miscoding elective as emergency by the 
admission method also happened more often for week-
day admissions, as 80% of stroke admissions are emer-
gency, miscoding elective as emergency on its own 
would have a rather small impact (2%) on the overall 
effect on outcome. In a condition for which there are 
more scheduled admissions for acute disease (for exam-
ple, symptomatic aortic aneurysm), however, the effect 
could be bigger (table D in appendix 2). More impor-
tantly, we showed that even when the admission 
method was available to exclude all elective admis-
sions, there were still more cases with low expected 
case fatality being included for weekday admissions.
Baseline difference in case mix is another potential 
bias in studies of the weekend effect. Although many 
studies attempt some adjustment for case mix, this is 
usually limited to the Charlson comorbidity index 
derived from coding data (appendix 3). In addition to 
limitations of coding in identifying comorbidities,23 24 
 
the most important case mix factors (stroke severity and 
premorbid functional status) are generally not avail-
able.25  Patients with minor stroke were less likely to 
present at weekends, in accordance with previous stud-
ies.7 26 27  As hospital admission rates might differ 
between weekdays and weekends,5 the difference of 
behaviour in patients with minor events could poten-
tially affect the case severity in hospital admissions on

weekdays versus weekends. In our study population, 
patients with minor stroke were more likely to use emer-
gency services if they presented during the weekend 
and were therefore more likely to be admitted at the 
weekend. As a result, we did not find an overall excess 
of weekend admissions with major strokes, but the 
effect of this type of presentation bias could depend on 
local admission policies.
In the scoping review, when we included only clinical 
registries with balanced baseline characteristics in 
weekend versus weekday admissions, we did not find 
any weekend effect. The trend towards similar or even 
better outcome for weekend versus weekday admis-
sions in our population is perhaps also due to the estab-
lished 24/7 stroke service in our hospital, with better 
availability of imaging during the weekend, which also 
highlights the importance of implementation of quality 
improvement initiatives (such as dedicated specialised 
stroke networks) in attenuating inequalities in the man-
agement of patients with acute stroke.
strengths and limitations
The strength of our study was its population based 
design with multiple overlapping methods to achieve 
near complete ascertainment of all patients with acute 
stroke, using daily ascertainment in the acute phase as 
well as data extracted from medical notes, general prac-
tices, and national/hospital coding. Therefore we were 
able to study the potential reasons for miscoding and 
the effect of differences in patient behaviour and dis-
ease severity on the weekend effect.
There are several limitations of the analyses. Firstly, 
our study covered a period of more than 10 years, 
during which time coding accuracy might have 
improved.28  However, in our analyses stratified by 
study period, although coding accuracy did improve 
both for weekday and weekend admissions over time, 
the relative higher proportion of false positive cases in 
weekday versus weekend admissions remained consis-
tent throughout the study periods (table E in appendix 
1). Secondly, our hospital is a teaching hospital with 
good stroke service and thus one could argue that it 
might not be representative of all hospitals in the UK. In 
our analyses stratified by study periods, however, we 
found that the trend of a better outcome for weekend 
admissions was even more prominent during the early 
phase when the stroke service in our region was not 
fully established (table F in appendix 1). Moreover, 
other studies in the UK also reported poor accuracy of 
using administrative data alone in identifying acute 
stroke.13 29 30  Therefore it is likely that these coding 
related biases in detecting a weekend effect in acute 
stroke could also exist in other hospitals in the UK. 
Thirdly, though we used acute stroke as an example, 
similar biases are also likely to exist for other acute con-
ditions if the weekend effect is studied with administra-
tive data. Such data might be more satisfactory in 
identifying surgical procedures, cancer, or rare dis-
eases, but in conditions for which patients are most 
likely to be admitted to hospital acutely, coding accu-
racy is known to be poor.11 
14 
31  Fourthly, as coding accu-
racy might differ between countries and healthcare 
systems, the coding related biases we reported using UK 
data might not be generalisable to other countries. 
Recent data from countries using different coding prac-
tices to the UK, however, also reported low sensitivity 
and positive predictive value with administrative data 
alone in identifying acute stroke.19 
32 
33 Fifthly, our study 
focused on the potential biases in using administrative 
data alone in detecting any weekend effect and these 
biases might not be generalisable in other clinical or 
research questions. Further improvement in coding 
accuracy will be important to support its use for 
research and managerial decision making, but even 
when coding is not accurate it can still be used to inves-
tigate some research questions. Finally, our scoping 
review of the previous literature was only a limited form 
of systematic review but was intended to be a guide to 
the likely generalisability of our study findings.
Clinical implications and conclusions
Using acute stroke as an example, we showed potential 
biases that could lead to apparent weekend effects in a 
range of other acute conditions. Given the limitations of 
coding of acute medical admissions, at least in the UK, 
any conclusion based on administrative data alone 
should be interpreted with caution. Future studies 
examining the weekend effect should ideally be based 
on prospective studies of clinically confirmed cases or 
at least include some validation of coding data against 
a clinical ideal standard. If only administrative data are 
available, however, use of information on “admission 
method,” if available, application of a more stringent 
selection of ICD codes, and consideration of analyses 
limited to the first admission in any given study period 
could reduce bias caused by false positive cases. Our 
findings perhaps explain why previous studies of clini-
cally confirmed stroke cases, and studies of coding data 
outside the UK, were less likely to find weekend effects.
