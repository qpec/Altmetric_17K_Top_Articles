Summary
Background—With recent improvements in vaccines and treatments against viral hepatitis, an 
improved understanding of the burden of viral hepatitis is needed to inform global intervention 
strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity 
and mortality for acute viral hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by viral hepatitis, 
by age, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013.
Methods—We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis infections and 
GBD’s cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We used meta-regression to 
estimate total cirrhosis and total liver cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and 
liver cancer attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the product 
of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific cause. Disability-adjusted life-
years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with 
disability (YLDs).
Findings—Between 1990 and 2013, global viral hepatitis deaths increased from 0·89 million 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·86–0·94) to 1·45 million (1·38–1·54); YLLs from 31·0 million 
(29·6–32·6) to 41·6 million (39·1–44·7); YLDs from 0·65 million (0·45–0·89) to 0·87 million 
(0·61–1·18); and DALYs from 31·7 million (30·2–33·3) to 42·5 million (39·9–45·6). In 2013, viral 
hepatitis was the seventh (95% UI seventh to eighth) leading cause of death worldwide, compared 
with tenth (tenth to 12th) in 1990.

 Interpretation—Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Unlike most 
communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative rank of viral hepatitis increased between 
1990 and 2013. The enormous health loss attributable to viral hepatitis, and the availability of 
effective vaccines and treatments, suggests an important opportunity to improve public health.

Introduction
Infectious viral hepatitis is an important challenge to health worldwide. Hepatitis A virus 
(HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are endemic in many low-income countries.1,2 They 
usually cause self-limiting hepatitis but occasionally lead to fulminant liver failure and, in 
rare cases of immunosuppression, chronic HEV infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) also cause acute illness but more commonly lead to progressive 
liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of liver cancer (specifically hepatocellular 
carcinoma).3–5
Effective vaccines for HAV and HBV have been available for more than two decades, and an 
HEV vaccine was licensed in China in 2011, but is not widely available.6 More recently, 
major improvements in antiviral therapies for HBV and HCV have been made. In the 
absence of a vaccine, progress in HCV treatment has been particularly important. New short-
course oral treatments can achieve cure in most patients, including those previously 
considered difficult to treat, although long-term follow-up data are not yet available.7,8 
Together, these advances overcome many barriers to the control and treatment of viral 
hepatitis in low-income countries and are set to be important components of a new global 
health strategy.9 However, a better understanding of the burden of disease is required to 
guide these efforts.
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study is a systematic effort to estimate health loss due 
to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography for timepoints from 1990 to 
2013. It is the most comprehensive effort to estimate causes of mortality and morbidity, and 
their relative importance. GBD quantifies health loss using disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), a summary metric combining premature death and non-fatal health outcomes.10 
The GBD Study estimated the burden resulting from the acute sequelae of HAV, HBV, HCV, 
and HEV infections, and the chronic sequelae (ie, cirrhosis and liver cancer) of HBV and 
HCV infections. Still, the total burden of viral hepatitis was not clearly recognised in 
previous GBD reports because estimates for acute disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer were 
categorised in separate parts of the GBD schedule of diseases and injuries.11 Building on 
estimates for the individual sequelae, we aimed to estimate the global burden of disease due 
to viral hepatitis, investigate the changes in disease burden between 1990 and 2013, and 
explore the extent to which disease burden affects low-income and lower-middle-income 
countries.

 Methods
Overall approach
We estimated mortality and morbidity due to acute viral hepatitis for the four most important 
viruses—HAV, HBV, HCV, and HEV—and the mortality and morbidity due to cirrhosis and 
liver cancer secondary to HBV and HCV. We aggregated burden from these hepatitis-
attributable causes and decomposed trends to assess changes resulting from changing 
demographics versus changing age-specific rates (see appendix p 8 for details of 
decomposition methods).
Prevalence modelling (acute infection)
We obtained anti-HAV IgG, HBsAg, anti-HCV IgG, and anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence data 
through reviews of published and grey literature, and searches of surveys indexed in the 
Global Health Data Exchange. We estimated the seroprevalence of HBsAg, anti-HCV IgG, 
and anti-HEV IgG—specific to age group, sex, country, and year—using the meta-
regression tool, DisMod-MR.12 Briefly, DisMod-MR produces consistent estimates of 
disease incidence, prevalence, remission, and mortality with a compartmental offset log-
normal non-linear mixed-effects model, with hierarchical random effects on geography. The 
models for HBsAg, anti-HCV IgG, and anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence included a study-level 
covariate to adjust data from studies of blood donors for a systematic bias towards lower 
estimates.6 The model for HEV seroprevalence also included the proportion of the 
population with access to improved sanitation facilities and the proportion of the population 
living in the classic monsoon belt as predictive covariates. As a log-normal model, DisMod 
performs poorly when modelling conditions for which prevalence approaches 100%. Thus, 
in view of the ubiquity of HAV infection and the reasonably stable force of infection among 
susceptible people across age groups, we used a catalytic binomial model to estimate the 
force of HAV infection on the basis of anti-HAV IgG seroprevalence. Specifically, we used a 
binomial generalised linear model with a complementary log–log link, an offset term for 
log-age, and a predictive covariate derived from principal components analysis of lag-
distributed income and the proportion of the population with access to improved water.13
We estimated the prevalence of acute infection as the product of the population incidence 
and the estimated duration of acute infection (appendix p 2), which was 4 weeks for HAV 
and HEV infections, and 6 weeks for HBV and HCV infections on the basis of expert 
opinion and published work.14–16 Because only a subset of individuals with acute infection 
are symptomatic and antibody presence does not necessarily indicate a disease state that 
causes any disability, we divided these acute infections into asymptomatic and symptomatic 
states. We used published age-specific estimates of the probability of symptomatic infection, 
increasing from 1% at birth to 85% among adults for HAV,13 from 1% at birth to 33% 
among adults for HBV,17 and from less than 1% at birth to 60% among adults for HEV 
(appendix p 3).1 For HCV, we assumed that 25% of acute infections would be 
symptomatic.14,15,18

 Mortality modelling
We estimated cause-specific mortality—by age group, sex, country, and year—for cirrhosis, 
liver cancer, and acute viral hepatitis (including HAV, HBV, HCV, and HEV) using the GBD 
2013 cause-of-death ensemble model, and fitted these estimates using data for all-cause 
mortality and cause-specific mortality that were compiled from vital registration, verbal 
autopsy, cancer registry, and mortality surveillance sources.19 In total, there were 5952 site-
years of mortality data, with 2144 site-years of data for cirrhosis, 1635 for hepatitis, and 
2173 for liver cancer. Candidate covariates for the cause-of-death ensemble model were 
selected on the basis of expert judgment and literature review, and included seroprevalence 
of anti-HAV, HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HEV from the DisMod-MR models, alcohol 
consumption, educational attainment, health system access, and lagged-smoothed gross 
domestic product per person, among other factors (appendix pp 5–7). Virus-specific 
mortality data for acute hepatitis were too limited to use directly in the cause-of-death 
ensemble model. We therefore used a two-step nested-model approach for acute hepatitis: 
first, we modelled the joint mortality from all acute hepatitis using cause-specific mortality 
data in the cause-of-death ensemble model; second, we developed separate natural history 
models for each virus, in which we estimated mortality as the product of incidence and case 
fatality. We derived estimates of case fatality for acute hepatitis by pooling estimates from 
published literature—0·024% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·0058–0·054) for HAV,20–22 
0·42% (0·25–0·64) for HBV,20,22 and 0·12% (0·025–0·29) for HCV.20,22 We estimated HEV 
deaths using the approach described by Rein and colleagues,1 in which we assumed a higher 
case fatality for pregnant women (3·9%, 1·9–8·0) than for other groups (0·38%, 0·16–0·57), 
and applied these two values in proportions defined by the proportion of women estimated to 
be pregnant in each age group, country, and year (appendix p 4). Finally, the estimates of 
viral hepatitis deaths by subtype were scaled using the GBD 2013 CoDCorrect process19 to 
sum to the total viral hepatitis envelope, and the estimates of deaths by all causes were 
scaled to sum to the total mortality envelope.
Prevalence modelling (cirrhosis and liver cancer)
We used DisMod-MR to estimate the prevalence of decompensated cirrhosis using data 
derived primarily from hospital discharge data, and cause-specific cirrhosis mortality 
estimates produced as described previously. For liver cancer, we modelled mortality-to-
incidence ratios by country, year, age, and sex. We estimated incidence by dividing 
estimated mortality by the estimated mortality-to-incidence ratio. Moreover, we used 
mortality-to-incidence ratios to predict liver cancer survival, assuming that high ratios 
correspond to poor access to care and poor survival, and that low ratios correspond to good 
access to care and good survival. Finally, we estimated prevalence as a function of incidence 
and survival.23
For both cirrhosis and liver cancer, we estimated the proportion of cases and deaths due to 
HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes (including autoimmune disease). We identified studies 
that reported the prevalence of these four causes among those with cirrhosis or liver cancer 
and, using DisMod-MR, developed aetiological proportion models for each of the four 
causes of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Within each country, year, age group, and sex, we 
rescaled these proportions to ensure that they summed to 100%. We then multiplied our

 estimates of cirrhosis and liver cancer mortality and prevalence by the corresponding 
aetiological proportion estimates to derive cause-specific mortality and prevalence (appendix 
p 7).23
Disability weights
Disability weights quantify the severity of a health state on a scale of zero (complete health 
or no disability) to one (complete disability, equivalent to death). Disability weights for 
GBD 2013 were derived from a pooled analysis of data from the GBD 2010 Disability 
Weights Measurement Study24 and the more recent European Disability Weights 
Measurement Study.25 In these two studies, researchers conducted surveys in Bangladesh, 
Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Tanzania, and the USA, and an 
open-access web survey to obtain supplementary data.25 For acute hepatitis, we divided 
symptomatic cases into three generic acute infectious disease health states: mild (disability 
weight 0·006), moderate (0·051), and severe (0·133).26 The disability weight for cirrhosis 
was 0·178. To calculate disability due to liver cancer, the overall prevalence was divided into 
four sequelae: diagnosis and primary treatment (disability weight 0·288), controlled phase 
(0·049), metastatic phase (0·451), and terminal phase (0·540; appendix p 5).
Aggregated ranking
GBD causes are organised within a hierarchy. Level 1 organises causes into three broad 
categories: communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; non-communicable 
diseases; and injuries. Level 2 subdivides the level 1 categories into 21 groups of related 
conditions (eg, cancer, cirrhosis). Level 3 subdivides the level 2 groups into 163 conditions 
or narrow categories of conditions (eg, liver cancer, cirrhosis due to HBV, acute hepatitis); 
where relevant, level 3 causes may be further subdivided, and there are 119 level 4 causes 
(eg, liver cancer due to HBV, acute HAV). When determining the relative ranks of causes, 
causes within the same level of the hierarchy should be compared. Although no aggregate 
hepatitis group exists within the GBD hierarchy, we treated our aggregated hepatitis 
estimates as if they belonged to a level 3 cause, the same level as the total acute hepatitis 
category.19,26

Results
Between 1990 and 2013, the number of deaths worldwide attributable to viral hepatitis 
increased by 63% (95% UI 52–75), YLLs due to viral hepatitis increased by 34% (24–46), 
YLDs increased by 34% (29–40), and DALYs increased by 34% (24–46; table 1). However, 
when these trends were decomposed to remove the effect of demographic trends (ie, 
changing population sizes and age structures), the underlying age-specific rates declined 
between 1990 and 2013: YLL rates declined by 20% (8–30), YLD rates declined by 13% 
(8–18), and DALY rates declined by 20% (8–30; figure 1). No significant trend was detected

 in age-specific mortality rates (−4%, −14 to 8). Therefore, increases in absolute mortality 
and disability seem to be driven primarily by demographic changes—most notably, 
population growth (appendix p 10).
Together, viral hepatitis deaths from acute infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer were the 
tenth (95% UI tenth to 12th) leading cause of death worldwide in 1990 and seventh (seventh 
to eighth) leading cause in 2013 (figure 2; appendix p 11). By contrast, the ranking of other 
major communicable diseases—eg, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and tuberculosis—fell over 
the same time period (figure 2). Viral hepatitis ranked 22nd (95% UI 20th to 25th) among 
leading causes of DALYs in 1990 and 18th (16th to 20th) in 2013 (appendix p 10).
In 2013, the greatest numbers of deaths and DALYs attributable to viral hepatitis were seen 
in east Asia and south Asia (table 2). The greatest mortality rates were seen in Oceania, 
western sub-Saharan Africa, and central Asia (figure 3; appendix p 13).
When combined, HBV and HCV accounted for 96% (95% UI 94–97) of viral hepatitis-
related mortality and 91% (88–93) of viral hepatitis-related DALYs in 2013 (appendix p 11). 
This finding has not changed significantly since 1990, when they accounted for 92% (90–
94) of mortality and 84% (80–88) of DALYs. Of the 96% of viral hepatitis-related mortality 
resulting from HBV and HCV in 2013, the two viruses accounted for nearly equal amounts 
(HBV 47% [45–49] vs HCV 48% [46–50]). Most mortality is attributable to liver cancer and 
cirrhosis due to HBV and HCV (appendix p 12). The relative burden of disease for HBV and 
HCV varies between and within geographical regions (figure 4). Broadly, a greater 
proportion of mortality in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and north Africa is 
attributed to HCV than to HBV, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa and most of Asia, the 
converse is true (figure 3; appendix pp 14–15). Most mortality attributed to HAV and HEV 
is in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The proportion of deaths due to HAV, HBV, and HEV has 
declined, whereas the proportion due to HCV has increased since 1990 (appendix p 11).
We explored the relation between the burden of viral hepatitis and economic status, stratified 
by low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries 
according to World Bank Classification 2014 (figure 5; appendix p 20). In 2013, the number 
of deaths attributed to viral hepatitis was lower in low-income and lower-middle-income 
countries (0·61 million deaths, 95% UI 0·57–0·67) than in upper-middle-income and high-
income countries (0·84 million deaths, 0·79–0·90). 42% (95% UI 40–45) of viral hepatitis 
deaths were found in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. DALYs attributed to 
viral hepatitis were similar in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (20·7 million, 
95% UI 19·0–23·1) and in upper-middle-income and high-income countries (21·7 million, 
20·1–23·1), with 49% of DALYs contributed by low-income and lower-middle-income 
countries. However, age-standardised rates of both death and DALYs were higher in low-
income and lower-middle-income countries in each time period (appendix p 12). Viral 
hepatitis has consistently been ranked as a leading cause of mortality in upper-middle-
income countries, but a rise in mortality in lower-middle-income countries relative to that in 
upper-middle-income countries (figure 5) has been associated with a narrowing in the 
rankings of leading cause of death by 2013 (appendix p 21).

 Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to formally estimate the burden of viral 
hepatitis using systematic data gathering and robust statistical methods. Our results show 
that viral hepatitis is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and causes 
at least as many deaths annually as tuberculosis, AIDS, or malaria. HBV and HCV account 
for more than 90% of viral hepatitis-related deaths and disability, and are the focus of 
renewed international efforts to combat viral hepatitis, including the proposed Global 
Strategy for 2016–21.9
Between 1990 and 2013, the relative importance of mortality and DALYs due to viral 
hepatitis has risen. This finding is by contrast with other major infectious diseases (including 
diarrhoeal disease, tuberculosis, and malaria); their fall in relative rankings reflects the 
global transition towards non-communicable diseases. Absolute numbers of deaths attributed 
to viral hepatitis have risen substantially by 63% and DALYs by 34% during 1990–2013. 
However, when we decomposed the trends, a more interesting and complex picture emerged 
(figure 1). HAV is the only hepatitis virus for which DALYs have declined significantly 
between 1990 and 2013. Some of this decline has been driven by changing population age 
structures, but most is due to declines in age-specific rates, most likely as a result of 
vaccination and improvements in water supply and sanitation. Age-specific DALY rates have 
declined for HBV, probably because of the effect of vaccination; however, demographic 
changes have countered these improvements and yielded an overall increase in DALYs. 
HCV is the only virus for which an increase in age-specific rates has been observed; 
combined with increases due to both population growth and changing age structures, DALYs 
for HCV have more than doubled since 1990. Finally, age-specific rates of DALYs for HEV 
have declined, probably because of improvements in water supply and sanitation; these 
improvements have been largely countered by population growth, yielding insignificant 
declines in DALYs for HEV.
The most notable limitations of this analysis stem from sparse data. Few large-scale 
population surveys of viral hepatitis seroprevalence have been done. Where no data were 
available, estimates were based on regional extrapolations and covariates, potentially 
minimising spatial heterogeneity and differences in epidemics. Whether these data gaps 
yield underestimation or overestimation is unclear. Similarly, establishing the proportion of 
cirrhosis and liver cancer due to HBV and HCV is challenging, because low amounts of data 
exist to inform the aetiology models: 124 datapoints from 66 unique sources for the models 
of the proportion of cirrhosis due to hepatitis, and 294 datapoints from 108 unique sources 
for the models of the proportion of liver cancer due to hepatitis. Therefore, these models rely 
heavily on covariates and space–time extrapolation, highlighting the need for more 
longitudinal studies and better ascertainment of hepatocellular carcinoma (as opposed to 
other liver cancers) and their causes. It is now well recognised that seroprevalence data can 
often overestimate the number of individuals with active chronic infection and that the 
absence of specific markers for acute HCV infection can lead to misclassification of chronic 
HCV infection as acute.

 Of note, we assigned no disability due to chronic HBV or HCV between acute infection and 
end-stage disease. Even in the absence of cirrhosis or liver cancer, individuals with chronic 
HCV might have substantial morbidity, particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms.27 Similar 
data for the morbidity of mild-to-moderate disease are not available from many parts of the 
world, but disability due to HCV is likely to be underestimated in our study, as is the 
potential effect of viral hepatitis (particularly HCV) on non-liver-related mortality.28
Viral hepatitis is unusual among leading communicable diseases because the distribution of 
morbidity is evenly divided between high-income and low-income settings. Biomedical 
advances have led to efficacious vaccines and treatments for HBV and HCV that could be 
delivered at scale, but it is too early to say whether treatment scale-up will be able to control 
transmission. However, by contrast with tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, mechanisms 
to fund these interventions in the poorest countries are largely non-existent, except for 
individuals who are also infected with HIV. The small proportion of global health funding 
targeted at viral hepatitis is disproportionate to its importance as a major cause of death and 
disability.29 Our results suggest that an evolution in funding structures is required to 
accommodate the burden of viral hepatitis and allow effective responses in low-income and 
lower-middle-income countries.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
On Oct 5, 2015, we searched PubMed for ““Hepatitis, Viral, Human”[Mesh] AND 
(burden OR DALY OR QALY OR HALE OR YLL OR YLD)”, with no restrictions on 
language or date of publication, and found 1445 publications. We excluded any studies 
that did not report original estimates of the frequency or burden of disease related to 
hepatitis A, B, C, or E infection, any studies that were restricted to special subpopulations 
(eg, injection drug users and people living with HIV), and any studies that did not 
produce estimates for an area larger than a country. 20 articles met our search criteria: 
two studies of hepatitis A virus seroprevalence; three studies of hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
seroprevalence; 12 studies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) that reported estimates of 
seroprevalence, prevalence of viraemia, incidence, or mortality; one study of hepatitis E 
virus (HEV) incidence and mortality; one study reporting estimates of cirrhosis and liver 
cancer due to HBV and HCV; and one study of liver cancer due to HBV and HCV. We 
found no studies that reported original estimates of the total burden of viral hepatitis, and 
no studies reporting global estimates of a comprehensive health gap metric (ie, disability-
adjusted life-years or quality-adjusted life-years) for any of the four hepatitis viruses.
Added value of this study
We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and 
mortality for acute viral hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer due to HBV and 
HCV, by age group, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013. Although sequela-specific 
hepatitis burden estimates have been published previously, our study is the fi rst formal 
attempt to estimate the total burden of viral hepatitis, using systematic data gathering and 
robust statistical methods, and the trends in that burden over time. To our knowledge, this 
study is the fi rst to explore the drivers of change in the burden of hepatitis and the effect 
of hepatitis in different country income levels. The effect of viral hepatitis has not been 
clearly recognised in previous GBD reports because estimates for acute disease, cirrhosis, 
and liver cancer have been reported separately. This paper is the first to place the burden 
of viral hepatitis in the context of overall global health.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results show that viral hepatitis is one of the leading causes of death and disability 
worldwide, and causes at least as many deaths annually as tuberculosis, AIDS, or 
malaria. By contrast with most other communicable diseases, hepatitis has risen in 
importance since the first GBD Study in 1990. As WHO launches a major new effort to 
tackle viral hepatitis, these data are of crucial importance to global health policy.
