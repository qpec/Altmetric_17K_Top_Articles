SUMMARY
Genetic, epidemiologic, and biochemical evidence
suggests that predisposition to Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) may arise from altered cholesterol metabolism,
althoughthemolecularpathwaysthatmaylinkcholes-
terol to AD phenotypes are only partially understood.
Here, we perform a phenotypic screen for pTau accu-
mulation in AD-patient iPSC-derived neurons and
identify cholesteryl esters (CE), the storage product
of excess cholesterol, as upstream regulators of Tau
early during AD development. Using isogenic induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying mutations in
the cholesterol-binding domain of APP or APP null
alleles, we found that while CE also regulate Ab
secretion, the effects of CE on Tau and Ab are medi-
ated by independent pathways. Efficacy and toxicity
screening in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons
showed that allosteric activation of CYP46A1 lowers
CE specifically in neurons and is well tolerated by
astrocytes. These data reveal that CE independently
regulate Tau and Ab and identify a druggable
CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis in AD.
INTRODUCTION
Pathological accumulation of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) and
accumulation of amyloid-beta (Ab) fragments are the two major
biochemical hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Effective
strategies to remove Ab in AD-patient brains have been devel-
oped but have not yet shown efficacy to slow cognitive decline
in clinical trials. This finding has led to the idea that targeting
Tau or combinatorial strategies that target both Tau and Ab are
required to treat AD. While Ab generation has been studied in
much detail, the processes that drive pTau accumulation in AD
are poorly defined. Late stage Tau pathology, such as aggrega-
tion of accumulated Tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and
subsequent neurodegeneration can be modeled in mice, or
non-neuronal human cells, by (over)expression of human mutant
Tau. However, Tau mutations do not occur in AD. Instead, in AD,
endogenous ‘‘wild-type’’ pTau accumulates downstream of fa-
milial AD (FAD) mutations (in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes)
or, in the case of sporadic late-onset AD (SAD), downstream of
an unknown combination of genetic and environmental risk fac-
tors. How these factors drive early accumulation of pTau in AD is
not understood. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC) technology (Shi et al., 2017) have made it possible
to generate functional human neurons from patients and healthy
controls to study early pathophysiological regulation of endoge-
nous Tau. In iPSC-derived neurons from both FAD- and SAD-
patients, pTau aberrantly accumulates at early time points
(Choi et al., 2014; Israel et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2015; Muratore
et al., 2014; Ochalek et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2012). Accumulation
of pTau in FAD neurons can be reversed by inhibition of b-secre-
tase, the enzyme that converts APP to b-CTF indicating a direct
relationship between APP processing and Tau (Israel et al., 2012;
Moore et al., 2015). Interestingly, inhibition of g-secretase (to
prevent generation of Ab from b-CTF) did not reduce pTau,
indicating that the effect of APP processing on pTau in early

 AD neurons is not solely mediated by extracellular Ab (Israel
et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2015).
Identification of other cellular pathways that contribute to pTau
accumulation early in FAD and SAD neurons is key to under-
standing Tau pathology in AD. In addition to increased Ab and
pTau levels, CE also accumulate in FAD and SAD. CE are
increased in mouse models expressing human (mutant) APP
(Chan et al., 2012; Tajima et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014) and
CE, as well as CE-storage organelles (lipid droplets), have been
shown to accumulate in the SAD brain (Chan et al., 2012; Foley,
2010; Hamilton et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014). CE are generated
when cholesterol is converted to CE by the ER-resident Acyl-CoA
cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) through ligation of a long-
chain fatty acid to (excess) cholesterol, and CE can be converted
back to cholesterol by acidic lipases in the lysosome (Ikonen,
2008; Puglielli et al., 2003). CE enhance the production of Ab
in vivo and in vitro indicating that CE can contribute to AD patho-
genesis (Di Paolo and Kim, 2011; Hutter-Paier et al., 2004; Huttu-
nen et al., 2009; Puglielli et al., 2001, 2003). CE-dependent
regulation of Ab generation is mediated by altered trafficking of
APP through the early secretory pathway (Huttunen et al.,
2009). Whether CE also affect Tau phosphorylation or Tau pro-
teostasis is unknown, but inhibition of cholesterol esterification
by genetic deletion of ACAT1 prevents early stage Tau pathology
in Tau mutant mice through unknown mechanisms (Shibuya
et al., 2015). A possible way by which CE could affect Tau pathol-
ogy is through regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system
(UPS). Cholesterol and cholesterol metabolites extensively
interact with the UPS to regulate the ubiquitination and degrada-
tion of cholesterol-metabolic enzymes (Sharpe et al., 2014), and
the UPS is a major regulator of pTau proteostasis. (Lee et al.,
2013). Activity of the UPS is decreased in AD (Keck et al., 2003;
Keller et al., 2000), and UPS (re)activation delays Tau aggregation
and neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo (Han et al., 2014; Lokir-
eddy et al., 2015; Myeku et al., 2016).
Here, we tested a library of >1,600 compounds for their po-
tency to inhibit pTau accumulation in cultured FAD iPSC-derived
neurons and find that neuronal CE regulate the proteasome-
dependent degradation of pTau. Using neurons derived from
multiple AD- and non-demented control (NDC) iPSC lines, as
well as isogenic CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited lines, we demon-
strate that the effect of CE on pTau is correlated with, but inde-
pendent of APP processing and Ab. Whereas the effect of CE
on pTau is mediated by proteasomal upregulation, the effect of
CE on Ab secretion is mediated by a cholesterol-binding domain
in APP. We identify a number of strategies to reduce pTau in a
CE-dependent manner and find that allosteric activation of
CYP46A1 is a neuron-specific CE-lowering strategy particularly
well tolerated by human astrocytes. Collectively, our data identify
a CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis as an early druggable pathway in AD.
RESULTS
A Drug Screen in iPSC-Derived Human FAD Neurons to
Identify Compounds that Reduce pTau Accumulation
pThr231Tau is an early marker of AD pathology that correlates
well with cognitive decline (Buerger et al., 2002; Luna-Mun
˜ oz
et al., 2007). pThr231Tau accumulates in APP duplication
(APPdp) iPSC-derived FAD neurons (Israel et al., 2012). To iden-
tify compounds that reduce pTau accumulation in these FAD
neurons, we screened a collection of 1,684 approved and
preclinical drugs for their efficacy to lower neuronal pThr231Tau.
For our screen, neural progenitor cells (NPCs; line APPdp1-6)
(Israel et al., 2012) were differentiated to neurons (Figures S1A
and S1B) for 3 weeks, replated in 384 well plates, and allowed
to mature for 2 weeks before treatment with compound at
5 mM for 5 days. The screen was performed in duplicate, and a
ratiometric readout of pThr231Tau/total Tau (tTau) level and
cell viability was determined (Figure 1A). In the primary screen,
158/1,684 compounds (9.4%) significantly reduced pThr231/
tTau by a Z score <�2 in at least one of the duplicates (Figure 1B;
Tables S1 and S2) and were selected for confirmation. In a repeat
of
the
primary
assay
with
selected
compounds,
96/158
compounds were confirmed to reduce pThr231/tTau by a
Z score <�2 in at least one additional replicate (Table S3). Of
the 96 confirmed compounds, 42 were clearly non-toxic hits
with Z > �1 for viability (Figure 1C). Our screen identified six
microtubule-interacting compounds that reduced pThr231Tau/
tTau (14% of hits) that have previously been shown to regulate
pTau in other systems (Dickey et al., 2006; Merrick et al., 1996;
Xie et al., 1998). Our hit-list also included four inhibitors of
cholesterol synthesis; atorvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and
rosuvastatin. Because cholesterol metabolism has been heavily
linked to AD pathogenesis (Di Paolo and Kim, 2011) we selected
these compounds for further study. We confirmed that these four
statins, as well as two additional statins (lovastatin and mevasta-
tin), reduced pThr231Tau/tTau in a dose-dependent manner with
minor effects on cell viability or neuronal number (Figures 1D and
S1C–S1F). Simvastatin reduced pThr231Tau in a similar dose-
dependent manner in additional lines from the same patient
(APPdp1-2) and an independent patient APPdp line (APPdp2-1)
(Figure S1G), indicating that the effect of statins is conserved
across individual APPdp lines and patients. In addition to
pThr231Tau/tTau, atorvastatin also reduced pS396/S404Tau,
pS202/T205Tau and levels of a pThr231 phosphorylation-
dependent conformational Tau epitope (TG3) as assessed by
immunofluorescence (Figure 1e). These data show that in
addition to screening for Ab (Brownjohn et al., 2017; Kondo
et al., 2017), iPSC-derived AD neurons can be applied to screen
for pTau modulators. In addition, these data show that statins
reduce pTau levels across a number of phosphorylation epitopes
and across individual FAD (APPdp) patients.
The Effect of Statins on pTau Is Mediated by Cholesteryl
Esters
To understand how pTau is regulated by statins, we studied the
relationship
between
the
mevalonate-cholesterol
synthetic
pathway and pTau levels in more detail. Statins inhibit 3-hy-
droxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), an early rate
limiting step in the cholesterol synthetic pathway that converts
HMG-CoA to mevalonate (MVA) (Figure 2A). As expected, MVA
supplementation rescued the effect of atorvastatin treatment
on pThr231Tau/tTau indicating that the effect of statins on
pTau is specific to their effects on the mevalonate pathway
(Figure 2B). While atorvastatin was slightly cytotoxic at higher
concentrations (Figures S2A and S2B) toxicity did not explain
the effect of atorvastatin on pThr231Tau/tTau, as MVA supple-
mentation completely rescued the effect of atorvastatin on
364
Cell Stem Cell 24, 363–375, March 7, 2019
 pThr231Tau/tTau ratio without rescuing the minor effect of
atorvastatin on cell viability (Figures S2A and S2B). Removal
of atorvastatin after 5 days of treatment allowed recovery of
pThr231Tau/Tau indicating reversible dynamic regulation (Fig-
ure S2C). Statin-treated neurons elicited a (normal) physiological
response to statin treatment exemplified by upregulation of
cholesterol-synthetic proteins (Figures S2D and S2E; Table
S4). Statins have recently been reported to induce the degrada-
tion of mutant p53 by reduction of mevalonate-5-phosphate
(MVP) (Parrales et al., 2016). The effects of statins on pTau are
not mediated by MVP, as both MVP and its direct downstream
metabolite, MVA-5PP, rescued the effect of statin treatment (Fig-
ure 2B). More distal of MVA-5PP, the MVA pathway branches
into non-sterol isoprenoid (protein prenylation) pathways and a
cholesterol synthetic pathway (Figure 2A). Inhibition of the
respective non-sterol isoprenoid pathways (by geranyl- or farne-
syl-transferase inhibitors GGTI-298 and FTI-227, respectively)

did not significantly reduce pThr231Tau/
tTau (Figures 2C, S2F, and S2G). In
contrast, inhibition of the cholesterol-
synthetic arm of the mevalonate pathway
using a squalene synthase inhibitor (YM-
53601) or D7-dehydrocholesterol reduc-
tase
(DHCR7)
inhibitor
(AY-9944)
did
significantly decrease pThr231Tau/tTau
(Figures 2C, S2F, and S2G), indicating
that pTau is regulated by the cholesterol-
synthetic branch of the MVA pathway.
Alternative
ways
to
reduce
neuronal
cholesterol such as inhibition of sterol reg-
ulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-
mediated
transcriptional
activation
of
cholesterol synthetic genes by fatostatin (Kamisuki et al., 2009)
(Figures 2C, S2H, and S2I) or induction of cholesterol export
by liver X receptor (LXR) agonists (Figure 2A) T0901317 and
24-hydroxycholesterol (Figures 2C, S2F, and S2G) also reduced
pThr231Tau/tTau. Activation of homologous nuclear receptors
such as PPARa (by GW50156) and PPARg (by Rosiglitazone),
which regulate fatty acid metabolism but not cholesterol export,
did not decrease pThr231Tau/tTau (Figures 2C, S2F, and S2G).
Another strategy to reduce the pool of neuronal cholesterol is the
activation of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), a neuron-
specific enzyme that converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholes-
terol (Anderson et al., 2016; Mast et al., 2017b; Moutinho et al.,
2016). As expected, activation of CYP46A1 by efavirenz (Figures
2C, S2F, and S2G) or overexpression of CYP46A1 (Figures S2J
and S2K) also reduced pThr231Tau/tTau. Together, these data
show that mechanistically different cholesterol-lowering drugs
all reduce pTau, strongly indicating that pTau levels are

 controlled by neuronal cholesterol levels or downstream choles-
terol metabolites. To determine whether cholesterol itself or a
cholesterol metabolite controls pTau levels, we performed
extensive lipid analysis for key selected compounds from previ-
ous experiments (Figures 2D–2F and S2L–S2P; Table S5). None
of the pTau-reducing drugs affected phospholipid levels (sphin-
gomyelin [SM] and phosphatidylethanolamine [PE]) (Figure S2L).
Cholesterol precursor levels were altered in accordance with the
enzymatic target of the different compounds (Figures S2M–
S2O); atorvastatin reduced desmosterol and lathosterol levels,
AY9944
reduced
desmosterol
and
lathosterol
levels
and
increased 7DHC levels, and T0901317 and efavirenz had minor
(slightly inhibitory) effects on precursor levels. 24-Hydroxycho-
lesterol (a direct downstream metabolite of cholesterol) was
increased
in
media
from
efavirenz-treated
neurons,
was
decreased in AY-9944-treated samples, and was unaltered in
atorvastatin- and T0901317-treated neurons (Figure S2P). Sur-
prisingly, however, although these compounds behaved as
expected, only AY-9944 (that only had minor effect on pTau, Fig-
ure 2C) reduced free cholesterol levels (Figure 2D). It is important
to note that our iPSC-derived neurons are cultured in media
without an exogenous source of cholesterol, and thus neuronal
cholesterol levels cannot be compensated by enhanced uptake

from the media. Whereas changes in free
cholesterol levels were not detected
for most compounds, all compounds
significantly reduced the levels of total
cholesterol (free + esterified cholesterol)
(Figure 2E) through a strong reduction of CE (Figure 2F). This
finding suggests that conversion of CE to cholesterol compen-
sates for the loss of cholesterol through inhibition of synthesis
or induction of export, and reductions in CE, not free cholesterol,
mediate the effects of the different compounds on pTau. In line
with this observation, direct inhibition of cholesterol esterifica-
tion by the ACAT inhibitors avasimibe (aka CI-1011) (Figures
2G and S2Q–S2V) (Huttunen et al., 2009, 2010; Lee et al.,
1996) or K604 (Figure 2G) also reduced pTau. Exogenous addi-
tion of cholesterol and CE (in the form of LDL) increased
pThr231Tau/tTau (Figure 2H) levels. Together, our data show
that CE regulate pTau levels in human FAD neurons. We investi-
gated the mechanisms underlying CE-dependent regulation of
pTau in more detail.
Regulation of pTau by CE Is Correlated with, but
Independent of, APP and Ab
APPdp neurons have an extra copy of APP and increased levels
of both Ab and pTau (Israel et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2015). To
understand the relationship between APP copy number, Ab,
and CE-dependent regulation of pTau in more detail, we also
treated NDC neurons with the normal two copies of APP with
cholesterol-targeting drugs. Simvastatin, atorvastatin, efavirenz,
366
Cell Stem Cell 24, 363–375, March 7, 2019
 and the ACAT inhibitors avasimibe and K604 all reduced
pThr231Tau/tTau in the NDC neurons (Figure S3A). For simva-
statin, we further tested an extensive dose range and found
that it reduced pThr231Tau/Tau in NDC neurons in a similar
dose-dependent manner as in APPdp neurons (Figure 3A). A sin-
gle dose of statin or efavirenz also decreased pThr231Tau/tTau
in sporadic AD (SAD) patient- and non-demented control (NDC)
neurons (Figures 3B, 3C, S3B, and S3C). pThr231Tau/tTau was
also reduced by simvastatin in cultured hippocampal mouse
neurons (Figure S3D). Together, these data indicate that CE-de-
pendent regulation of pTau is conserved across individual
patients and healthy subjects (and even across species) and is
not dependent on baseline APP copy number.
In addition to our findings on pTau, CE reduction has previ-
ously been reported to reduce Ab levels (Hutter-Paier et al.,
2004; Huttunen et al., 2009; Puglielli et al., 2001), and Ab secre-
tion from our iPSC-derived neurons was also decreased by sta-
tins (Figure 3D). We observed a strong correlation between Ab42
secretion and pThr231Tau/tTau in response to atorvastatin treat-
ment across time points and drug doses (Figures 3E and S3E).
To test whether the effect of CE on pTau was mediated by
alterations in APP processing and/or the reduction of Ab, we
generated an isogenic APPnull line in an APPdp patient genetic
background (Figures 3F, 3G, and S3F–S3H). No APP expression
or Ab secretion was detected in the APPnull neurons (Figures 3F
and 3G). pThr231Tau/tTau levels were reduced at baseline in the
APPnull neurons (Figure S3I). Interestingly, in these APPnull
neurons, simvastatin still reduced pThr231Tau/tTau in a dose-
dependent manner identical to that of its isogenic control lines
(Figure 3H). Similarly, simvastatin reduced pThr231Tau/tTau
the same in a previously generated isogenic set of NDC (APPwt)
and APPnull neurons (CV line 151 and IB6) (Fong et al., 2018)
(Figure 3H). Together, these data show that CE regulate both
pTau and Ab, but regulation of pTau by CE is APP- and
Ab-independent.

Binding Domain in APP

 separate, we first studied the relationship between CE and Ab
secretion in more detail. We hypothesized that the effect of CE
on Ab secretion could be mediated by a recently identified
cholesterol-binding domain in APP b-CTF (Barrett et al., 2012).
We used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the cholesterol-binding
domain in the endogenous APP locus (Figures 4A–4C, S4A,
and S4B) and created two mutations that had previously been
shown to abolish APP b-CTF-cholesterol interactions (Barrett
et al., 2012), APP E693A and APP F691A+E693A. We observed
that Ab42 secretion in these isogenic APP-Dcholesterol lines
was reduced under steady state conditions (Figure 4D) indi-
cating that the cholesterol-binding domain affects APP process-
ing and Ab secretion. More importantly, atorvastatin treatment
(Figure 4E) did not affect Ab42 secretion in these neurons indi-
cating that the effect of lowering CE on Ab42 is mediated by
the cholesterol-binding domain in APP. While Ab secretion was
no longer regulated by atorvastatin in these neurons, atorvasta-
tin still decreased pT231Tau/tTau ratio (in an identical manner as
in their isogenic wild-type controls) (Figure 4F), again confirming
that the effect of CE on pTau and the effect of CE on Ab are
regulated through two separate pathways. We next sought to
determine how CE regulate pTau.

 The Effect of CE on pTau Levels Is Mediated by the
Proteasome
Previous reports indicate that accumulation of pTau in FAD
neurons can be downstream of altered proteostatic regulation
of (p)Tau (Moore et al., 2015). To assess whether CE affect the
proteostatic regulation of pTau, we performed quantitative west-
ern blot on APPdp neurons treated with different CE-targeting
drugs. In addition to a reduction of pS396/S404Tau and
pS202/T205Tau, CE reduction also reduced total Tau (Figures
5A, 5B, and S5A). The reduction of pTau and total Tau by our

 treatments was not explained by a specific loss of neurons in the
cultures (Figures S5B–S5D). The reduction of both pTau as well
as tTau could indicate a proteostatic regulatory event, rather
than altered Tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.
This was further substantiated by the finding that activity of
GSK3b (a major Tau kinase) was not affected by statin-mediated
CE reduction (Figure S5E). Next, we attempted to rescue the ef-
fect of CE reduction on pThr231Tau/tTau with inhibitors of phos-
phatase activity (okadaic acid), proteasomal (MG132), and/or or
lysosomal and autophagosomal (chloroquine) degradation (Fig-
ures 5C and S5F–S5M). Only proteasomal inhibition abrogated
the decrease in pThr231Tau/tTau ratio induced by atorvastatin
(Figures 5C and 5N), indicating that the effect of CE on pTau is
mediated by the proteasome. Interestingly, in addition to choles-
terol-synthetic genes, we found that the 26S proteasome regula-
tory subunit 7 (PSMC2) was also upregulated after statin treat-
ment in NDC neurons (Figure S2D; Table S2). We validated by
western blot in APPdp neurons that statin treatment increased
the levels of proteasomal subunit PSMC2 (Figures 5D and 5E).
Levels of another proteasome subunit, proteasome subunit
beta type-5 (PSMb5) in the core of the proteasome, were also
increased (Figures 5D and 5E). This statin-dependent increase
in proteasome levels is not mediated by transcriptional upregu-
lation of proteasomal subunits (Figure S5N). Using a proteasome
activity binding probe (Berkers et al., 2007; Leestemaker et al.,
2017), we found that CE reduction through either statins or efa-
virenz increased total cellular proteasome activity in both APPdp
and NDC neurons (Figures 5F–5I). The effect of CE on protea-
some function was not mediated by mechanistic target of rapa-
mycin (mTor) (Figures S5O–S5Q). Together, our data show that
reducing neuronal CE enhances proteasome levels, increases
total cellular proteasome activity, and induces the proteasomal
degradation of pTau indicative of a CE-proteasome-Tau axis.
CYP46A1 Activation Is a Neuron-Specific CE-Reducing
Approach that Is Better Tolerated by Astrocytes Than
HMGCR Inhibitors (Statins)
Our data indicate that neuronal CE are a potential therapeutic
target to activate the proteasome and prevent aberrant pTau
accumulation in AD. To identify possible adverse effects of
candidate CE-lowering strategies on other non-neuronal brain
cells, we tested the toxicity of selected compounds on iPSC-der-
ived astrocytes. All iPSC-derived astrocytes displayed radial
morphology of astrocytes and expressed the glial marker
GFAP, while the neural stem cell marker SOX2 was not ex-
pressed (Figure 6A). We concentrated on two different drugs
that currently have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
for other indications, statins (to lower cholesterol synthesis) and
efavirenz (that activates the neuron-specific enzyme CYP46A1).
Already, at low concentrations, simvastatin and atorvastatin
induced major astrocyte cell death (Figures 6B, 6C, S6A, and
S6B), whereas efavirenz did not affect astrocyte viability even
at high doses (Figures 6D and S6C). 24-Hydroxycholesterol
was not detected in astrocyte media before or after treatment
with
efavirenz.
Efavirenz
increased
24-hydroxycholesterol
secretion from APPdp and APPnull neurons in a dose-dependent
manner that correlated well with its effect on pThr231Tau/tTau in
these neurons (Figures 6D and S6D). Together, these data show
that allosteric activation of CYP46A1 is a neuron-specific CE-
and pTau-lowering treatment with less adverse effects on astro-
cytes and provides a therapeutic approach to reduce pTau accu-
mulation in early AD-neurons.
DISCUSSION
Here, we used AD-patient iPSC-derived neurons in a phenotypic
drug screen to identify compounds that reduce aberrant pTau
accumulation in FAD neurons (Israel et al., 2012; Moore et al.,
2015; Muratore et al., 2014; Ochalek et al., 2017). From a library
of >1,600 compounds, we successfully identify 42 compounds
that reduced pTau levels, including six previously reported
modulators of pTau and 36 novel pTau targeting compounds
(Figure 1). From the 42 identified compounds, we selected
cholesterol-targeting compounds (statins) to study in more
detail. Cholesterol metabolism has previously been implicated
in AD (Di Paolo and Kim, 2011; Puglielli et al., 2003) and CE,
the esterified storage products of cholesterol, accumulate in
AD patient brains (Chan et al., 2012) and in APP-transgenic
mice (Chan et al., 2012; Tajima et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014).
We show that reducing CE, through a number of mechanistically
different drugs, reduces levels of pTau at multiple phosphoryla-
tion epitopes in both FAD, SAD, and NDC subject neurons. CE
have previously also been shown to regulate APP processing
and Ab generation (Hutter-Paier et al., 2004; Huttunen et al.,
2009; Puglielli et al., 2001), and we confirmed that CE also regu-
late Ab secretion from human iPSC-derived AD patient neurons.
Interestingly, we find that the effect of CE on Ab is independent of
the effect of CE on pTau (Figures 3 and 4), and pTau and Ab are
thus co-regulated by CE through independent pathways. Similar
co-regulation of Ab and Tau through independent pathways
have recently been shown for ApoE (Wang et al., 2018) and the
retromer complex (Young et al., 2018). These findings, together
with our findings, reinforce the notion that common upstream
(pathogenic) pathways in SAD, such as CE, can drive increased
levels of pTau and Ab through separate pathways (Small and
Duff, 2008), rather than only through a direct linear pathway
directly from Ab to Tau.
Pathways that Mediate the Effect of CE on pTau and Ab
We investigated the separate pathways that underlie CE-depen-
dent regulation of pTau and Ab, respectively, in early AD
neurons. We find that the effect of CE on Ab is mediated by a
cholesterol binding-site in APP, whereas the effect of CE on
pTau is mediated by the proteasome. Surprisingly, in our system,
we did not observe significant differences in free cholesterol
levels for the treatments that reduced CE, Ab, and pTau. As
also previously observed (Puglielli et al., 2001), these data indi-
cate that CE mediates the effect of cholesterol-targeting drugs
on Ab. We show that the effect of CE on Ab is mediated by a
domain in APP that has previously been shown to bind choles-
terol (Barrett et al., 2012), possibly suggesting that this choles-
terol-binding domain can also sense CE. Alternatively, localized
reductions in cholesterol in specific domains such as lipid rafts
(Ehehalt et al., 2003), specific organelles, or localized changes
in de novo synthesized cholesterol under the detection limit of
our measurements could mediate the effect of statins on APP
processing via the APP-cholesterol binding domain. In regard
to CE-dependent regulation of pTau, we find that reduction of
370
Cell Stem Cell 24, 363–375, March 7, 2019
 CE increases the level of proteasomal subunits, overall protea-
somal activity, and proteasomal degradation of pTau (see model
Figure 6E). This indicates a neuronal CE-proteasome-pTau axis
that regulates turnover of neuronal pTau. The effect of CE on
proteasome levels is not mediated by enhanced transcription
of proteasomal subunits, and the exact mechanism by which
CE control proteasomal activity needs to be further determined.
Interestingly, in other model systems, lipid droplets (the storage
site of CE) have been shown to be active signaling organelles
that regulate proteasome activity (Arrese et al., 2014; Keembiye-
hetty et al., 2011). The neuronal proteasome also associates with
plasma membranes (Ramachandran and Margolis, 2017), offer-
ing another possible neuron-specific site of convergence be-
tween CE and the proteasome. CE-dependent regulation of
the proteasome is also relevant for other neurodegenerative dis-
eases in which altered cholesterol-homeostasis and protein ag-
gregation occurs such as Niemann-Pick type C and Huntington
disease (Karasinska and Hayden, 2011). Another open issue is
why pTau is regulated by CE. Direct coupling of CE to pTau levels
could indicate a pathway that coordinates the speed of Tau-
regulated axonal transport or growth, with the availability of
(stored) neuronal cholesterol required for membrane growth or
synapse formation. Overall, our data here indicate that CE regu-
late pTau and Ab by two separate pathways and suggests that
CE could be an upstream driver of both Ab secretion and pTau
accumulation.
CE and AD
Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how changes
in CE, induced by APP mutations or SAD genetic risk variants in
APP (Chan et al., 2012; Tajima et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014)
could contribute to Tau pathology. Interestingly, CE production
is overactive in human SAD fibroblasts (Pani et al., 2009) and
APOE, the major genetic risk factor for SAD, acts as a CE trans-
porter in brain (Liu et al., 2013; Michikawa et al., 2000; Minagawa
et al., 2009). Our findings in human iPSC-derived AD neurons
indicate that alterations in neuronal CE could drive pTau accu-
mulation and are supported by previous in vivo observations in
mouse models showing that statins reduce NFT load in animal
models of tauopathy (Boimel et al., 2009), and genetic inhibition
of cholesterol esterification by ACAT1 reduces tauopathy in an
AD-mouse model (Shibuya et al., 2015), indicating that the

(B–D) iPSC-derived APPdp1-6 astrocytes were treated for 3 days with increasing concentrations of (B) atorvastatin, (C) simvastatin, and (D) efavirenz, and viability
was measured (cell titer glo). Astrocytic viability (blue line) was plotted against results from Figures 1D and S1A for statins (neuronal viability and pThr231Tau/Tau
ratio). For efavirenz, dose responses to measure pThr231Tau/tTau and neuronal viability were performed in APPdp1-6 neurons (mean ± SEM, n R 3–6).
(E) Model depicting the relationship between CE, pTau, and Ab in early AD neurons. Statins reduce CE levels through inhibition of the cholesterol-synthetic
pathway, while efavirenz enhances the turnover of cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol that causes conversion of CE to cholesterol and a reduction in CE.
Reduced CE cause proteasomal upregulation and degradation of pTau. In a correlated, but independent pathway, CE regulate APP processing and Ab
generation.

 interactions between CE and Tau are conserved in the adult
(mouse) brain. We describe several pharmaceutical strategies
to reduce CE in early AD neurons including LXR target gene-
mediated cholesterol export, conversion of cholesterol to hy-
droxycholesterol by CYP46A1 activators, and direct inhibition
of cholesterol esterification by ACAT inhibitors. In humans,
long-term statin usage has been shown to correlate with
reduced AD incidence in some studies (Shepardson et al.,
2011a, 2011b; Zissimopoulos et al., 2017), although the underly-
ing mechanisms have been debated. Statins also reduce pTau
levels in CSF from AD patients (Riekse et al., 2006). Here, we
show that the effects of statins on pTau can be directly mediated
by CE and are not merely a consequence of altered APP pro-
cessing or peripheral effects of cholesterol-targeting drugs.
However, our data do not indicate that statins are the best candi-
date drugs for targeting Tau accumulation in AD. Statins affect
the levels of pTau in human neurons only at relatively high con-
centrations (Figure 1) unlikely reached in human brain (Bjo
¨ r-
khem-Bergman et al., 2011) and have strong adverse effects
on human astrocytes at these high concentrations (Figure 6).
We cannot exclude the possibility that in vivo statins lower
neuronal CE through indirect effects on astrocytic cholesterol
and/or CE production, but our data do indicate that additional
potency could be gained from enhanced targeting of neuronal
CE. We show that allosteric activators of CYP46A1 could provide
a neuron-specific approach to reduce CE and pTau in early AD
neurons. Regulation of pTau by CYP46A1 is also conserved in
adult (mice) brains where genetic inhibition of CYP46A1 en-
hances abnormal phosphorylation of Tau (Djelti et al., 2015),
and overexpression of CYP46A1 in transgenic Tau mice rescues
cognitive decline (Burlot et al., 2015).
We targeted CYP46A1 through allosteric activation by the
small molecule efavirenz (Anderson et al., 2016) and show that
efavirenz reduces pTau in early human AD neurons without
affecting astrocyte viability. Efavirenz, originally marketed as
an HIV-medication (brand name Sustiva), has recently also
been shown to reduce amyloid pathology in AD mice (Mast
et al., 2017b) indicating that efavirenz could possibly be repur-
posed for AD. However, when given to HIV patients at high
doses, efavirenz has significant adverse effects that include
neurotoxicity (Apostolova et al., 2017). Major adverse effects
were not observed in mice at lower concentrations of efavirenz
that sufficed to alter brain cholesterol metabolism and reduce
amyloid pathology, indicative of an appropriate therapeutic
window (Mast et al., 2017b). Other allosteric activators of
CYP46A1 have also recently been identified (Mast et al.,
2017a). The in vivo data of CYP46A1 activators on inhibitors of
amyloid pathology (Mast et al., 2017b), together with our findings
that CYP46A1 activators reduce Tau accumulation in human AD
neurons, support the development of allosteric activators of
CYP46A1 as therapies for AD.
In conclusion, using high-throughput phenotypic screening,
we identified >40 FDA-approved drugs with diverse biological
targets that reduce pTau in early AD neurons. By pathway map-
ping, we identify a CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis as a druggable
pathway in early AD. We find that reducing CE potently de-
creases neuronal pTau levels through proteasomal upregulation
and degradation of pTau in an APP- and Ab-independent
manner. In a separate pathway, Ab secretion is regulated by
CE through a cholesterol-binding domain in APP. We find that
allosteric activation of CYP46A1 is a neuron-specific CE-
lowering strategy that is well tolerated by human astrocytes.
Together, our data indicate CE as a dual upstream regulator of
pTau and Ab, and we propose CE-reduction, particularly through
CYP46A1 activation, as a therapeutic approach to indepen-
dently reduce accumulation of pTau and Ab in AD patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cultured Mouse Cortical Neurons
Primary cortical neurons were cultured from postnatal day zero C57BL/6J pups. Briefly, pups were decapitated into Hanks’ medium
without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and cortices were dissected in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES. After dissection,
cortices were trypsinized for 25 min at 37�C and dissociated. Neurons were plated in Neurobasal-A with B27 supplement and drug-
treatment was performed after 2 weeks.
Human iPSC Derived Cell lines

 characterization of these APPdp iPSC lines and patient details. SAD and NDC NPC lines used are CV4a, SAD1, SAD2, SAD5, SAD5,
SAD7, NDC1, NDC2, NDC4 and NDC5 described in Young et al. (2015);
To generate isogenic APP knockout iPSCs in an APPdp patient 1 background, iPSC-line APPdp1-2 was gene edited to generate the
iPSC and NPC-line APPdp1KO. To generate isogenic APP knockout lines in wild-type (Craig Venter, CV) background, iPSC-line CVB
(Gore et al., 2011) was gene edited to generate IPSC and NPC-line IB6 (CV APPnull) and 151 (CV wt) (Fong et al., 2018). To generate
isogenic Dcholesterol APP mutants the iPSC-line CVB (Gore et al., 2011) was gene edited to generate iPSC and NPC-lines B10 (wt),
B11 (wt), 3D9 (homozygous E693A), 2B2b (homozygous E693A) and D12 (homozygous F691A+E693A).
iPSC genome editing
Generation of isogenic APP knockout lines in a wild-type (CV iPSC) background, IB6 (APP knockout) and 151 (wt) was described
previously (Fong et al., 2018). For gene-editing, iPSCs were pretreated with 10uM Rock inhibitor (Ri, Y-27632 dihydrochloride,
Abcam) 2 hours prior to nucleofection. iPSC’s were dissociated with Accutase and filtered through 100uM filter and spun down at
1000rpm for 5 minutes. Two million cells were nucleofected according to manufacturer instructions using the Amaxa Human
Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 (Lonza).
To generate an isogenic APPnull line in an APPdp-patient background, the iPSC-line APPdp1.2 was nucleofected with 6 mg
CMV::Cas9-2A-eGFP vector and 3 mg U6::gRNA vector. To target the CRISPR/Cas9 we used the gRNA target sequence: 50-GGA
GATCTCTGAAGTGAAGATGG-30 (see Table S6 for all oligos used). Nucleofected iPSCs were replated into a 6 well of MEF feeder
cells in the presence of Ri and allowed to recover for 72 hours, 1 3 104 GFP+ iPSCs were FACS sorted (FACS Aria IIu, BD Biosciences)
and (sparsely) plated on 10 cm MEF-feeder plates in the presence of Ri. After 7 days, individual colonies were manually picked and
cultured in individual wells of a 96-well plate. Cells were split and DNA was isolated from individuals wells (quickextract kit, Epicenter),
PCR amplified using the primers (APPex16-F: CCC GTA AGC CAA GCC AAC AT, APPex16-R: CAT GCA CGA ACT TTG CTG CC) and
sequenced using the primer AGGCAGCAGAAGCCTT and aligned against the APP wild-type sequence. Amplified PCR-fragments
from non-wild-type colonies were selected, cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced to
analyze the (edited) genomic DNA sequence on both alleles. One confirmed APPnull line was expanded and differentiated to neural
progenitor cells and characterized as detailed in Figure S3. To generate isogenic APPDcholesterol lines in a CV background, the CV
iPSC-line was nucleofected with 3.4 mg of a CMV::Cas9-2A-eGFP vector, 1.6 mg of a TOPO blunt II::gRNA vector, and 50nmol (4ng)
repair single-stranded oligonucleotide. To target the CRISPR/Cas9 we used the gRNA target sequence: 50-GTGTTCTTTGCAGAA
GATGTGGG-30. Repair oligo’s to generate E693A and F691+E693A respectively were 50-Tattgcatttagaaattaaaattctttttcttaatt

cggtgttgtcat-30 respectively.
Nucleofected iPSCs were re-plated into a 6 well of MEF feeder cells in the presence of Ri and and 1 mM SCR7 (Excess Bioscience,
M60082-2) and/or 5 mM L-755,507 (Sigma, SML1362).
Cells were then allowed to recover for 48 hours after which, live, GFP+ iPSCs were FACS sorted (FACS Aria IIu, BD Biosciences)
and plated at 10,000 cells per 10 cm MEF-feeder plates in the presence of Ri. After 7-14 days, individual colonies were manually
picked and cultured in individual wells of 96-well plates. 96 well plates were split and DNA was isolated from each well of one of
the plates (quickextract kit, Epicenter). The region of interest was PCR amplified using Forward Primer: 50-CTTCCTCGAACTGGG
GAAGC-30 and Reverse Primer: 50-TCACGGTAAGTTGCAATGAATGA-3. Coincidentally, mutation of the wild-type sequence to
the sequence corresponding to the E693A mutation generates a novel BbvI restriction motif, whereas introduction of the F691A mu-
tation creates a Pstl restriction enzyme motif. Therefore, initial screening was performed by performing a restriction digest on the
PCR-amplified fragment by incubating the PCR amplicon with BbvI (for E693A) or PstI (F691A+E693A). These fragments were run
on a DNA-gel and samples in which full restriction had occurred (homozygous for the desired mutation) were confirmed by
sequencing of the amplicon using the primer: 50-CCAACCAGTTGGGCAGAGAA-30 Once confirmed, two individual IPSC lines
containing the homozygous E693A mutation (3D9, 2B2), one line containing the homozygous F691A+E693A mutation (D12) and
two unedited controls lines (B10, B11) that underwent the same clonal expansion process were expanded and differentiated to neural
progenitor cells.
Additional Cell Line Information
The Craig Venter Cell line (CV) as well as all gene edited isogenic lines generated from this line are male. The CV line was previously
reported and characterized in Gore et al. (2011). Cell lines generated in this background include the isogenic knockout lines IB6 (APP
knockout) and 151 (wt), and the Dcholesterol mutant lines 3D9 and 2B2 (APP E693A), D12 (F691A+E693A), and B10 and B11 (WT
controls). All APPdp1 (patient 1) derived lines are male, all APPdp2 (patient 2) derived lines are female (Israel et al., 2012).
The lines NDC1, NDC2, NDC3, NDC4, NDC5, SAD2, SAD3, SAD6, and SAD7 are male. The lines SAD1, SAD4, and SAD5 are fe-
male. The NDC and SAD lines were previously reported and characterized in Israel et al. (2012) and Young et al. (2015). Analyses of
the influence of sex was not evaluated in this study. Rather the effect of drug-treatment on individual cell-lines before and after treat-
ment was compared or between isogenic gene-edited lines.
Copy number determination
200 ng of DNA was hybridized to Illumina HumanCore arrays (Illumina), and stained per Illumina’s standard protocol. Copy Number
Variation (CNV) calling was carried out in Nexus CN (version 7.5) and manually inspected, visualizing the B-allele frequencies (pro-
portion of A and B alleles at each genotype) and log R ratios (ratio of observed to expected intensities) for each sample, as described
in D’Antonio et al. (2017).

 Generation of neural progenitor cells
NPC’s were generated from iPSCs as described previously (Yuan et al., 2011). In short, 2 3 105 FACS-purified iPSC TRA1-81+ cells
were seeded onto two 10 cm plates that were seeded the previous day with 5 3 105 PA6 cells and were cultured in PA6 differentiation
media (450ml Glasgow DMEM, 50ml KO Serum Replacer, 5ml sodium pyruvate, 5ml Nonessential Amino Acids) + 10um SB431542+
0.5ug/ml Noggin. After 6 days in culture, media was changed to PA6 differentiation media without SB431542 and Noggin. At day 11,
cells were dissociated with Accutase and �5 3 105 CD184+CD24+CD44�CD271� NPCs were FACS-purified and plated onto poly-L-
ornithine/laminin-coated plates and cultured with NPCbase + 20ng/ml bFGF (Millipore). Of note, while iPSC are grown in lipid con-
taining media, the derived NPC after sorting (and for neuronal differentiation) are always grown in medium that does not contain an
exogenous source of lipids.
Cell culture, generation of neurons and astrocytes
iPSCs were cultured on a MEF feeder layer in HUES medium (KO DMEM, knockout serum, plasmanate, pen-strep, non-essential
amino acids, glutamax and b-mercaptoethanol) + 20ng/ml bFGF (Millipore) as described previously (Israel et al., 2012) on a MEF
feeder layer and passaged with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies). NPCs were cultured on poly-L-ornithine (0.02 mg/ml)
and laminin (5 ug/ml) (Sigma)-coated plates in DMEM:F12 + Glutamax, 0.5x N2, 0.5x B27, Pen/Strep (all Life Technologies), and
20 ng/ml FGF, and passaged with Accutase. For neuronal differentiation, NPCs were expanded to confluence, after which FGF
was withdrawn from the culture medium and the medium was changed twice weekly. For all experiments, unless stated otherwise,
neurons after 3 weeks of differentiation were replated into 96 wells (2 3 105 living cells/well) for 2 weeks in 200 ul NPC base + BDNF/
GDNF/cAMP. After 2 weeks media was removed and fresh media (200 ul NPC base + BDNF/GDNF/cAMP) containing the tested
compounds was added. At indicated time points, the conditioned culture media was harvested from cells and cells were lysed in
70 mL MSD lysis buffer (MSD) with protease (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt). For Figures 4E and 4F (cholesterol mu-
tants) 3-week differentiated neurons were plated for 2 weeks and treated with DMSO and Atorvastatin respectively for 2 days. On day
3 a full media change was performed (containing DMSO or Atorvastatin) and 24 hours later the media was collected for Ab measure-
ments. For experiments in Figure 5C, MG132 was added fresh to the media every day. For astrocytic differentiation, a confluent
10 cm plate of NPCs was scraped in NPC medium, and transferred to 3 wells of a 6 well plate placed on a 90 RPM orbital shaker
in the incubator to promote neurosphere formation. 24 hours later, 5 mM RI was supplemented to the medium for 48 hours. After
48 hours the neurospheres were grown in NPC medium (withouth FGF) that was replaced every 2 to 3 days. One week after scraping,
media was changed to Astrocyte Growth Medium (AGM) containing 3% FBS, ascorbic acid, rhEGF, GA-1000, insulin, and L-gluta-
mine (Lonza) and cell were cultured for an additional two weeks. After two weeks, the neurospheres were plated on a poly-L-orni-
thine/laminin-coated 10 cm plate. After seven days the astrocytes emerging from the neurospheres were passaged with Accutase,
cultured in AGM, and maintained with the neurospheres.
Neuron FACS sort
For Ab measurements in purified Dcholesterol mutant neurons (Figure 4D) and tau measurements in the APPdp and APPnull cells
(Figure S3I), neurons were purified to compare steady state Ab measurement within different lines. After three weeks of neuronal dif-
ferentiation in NPCbase media without FGF; CD184-, CD44-, CD24+ (antibodies from BD Bioscience) neurons were purified by FACS
(BD Biosciences) and were plated onto poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated coated plates. Sorted neurons were cultured in NPCbase
media + 0.5mM dbCAMP, 20ng/mL BDNF, and 20ng/mL GDNF for 5-7 days before experiments.

Phenotypic high-throughput screen
After thawing, APPdp1-6 NPC’s (passage 13) were expanded to confluence on 10cm dishes and differentiated at passage 16 (p16) by
withdrawal of bFGF. After 3 weeks, differentiated NPC’s were washed with PBS and dissociated using Accutase:Accumax

 (Innovative Cell Technologies) (1:1). Cells were resuspended in sort buffer (NPCbase Media+ 1% FBS (Mediatech 35-011-
CV)+2.5mM EDTA) and filtered through a sterile cell strainer (100um, Fisher scientific, Cat no. 22363549) to remove clumps. Cells
were spun down (5 min at 1000RPM) and resuspended in NPCbase + 20 ng/ml BDNF, 20 ng/ml GDNF (Peprotech) and 0.5 mM
dbcAMP (Sigma).
Cells were plated in 384 well poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated plates at 5 3 104 live cells/well in 50 mL and were allowed to further
mature for 2 weeks. After 1 week, 25 mL media was aspirated and replaced with fresh media (NPC base + BDNF/GDNF/cAMP).
1 week later (in total 2 weeks on the 384 well plate) 15 mL of media was aspirated (leaving 35 mL in the well) and 35 mL media + 2x
compound (NPC base + 2x BDNF/GDNF/cAMP and 10 mM of compound) was added to generate a final concentration of 5 mM com-
pound/well or vehicle (DMSO, 16 wells per 384 well plate) in duplicate. After five days of treatment, media was aspirated and cells
were lysed in 70 mL Mesoscale discovery lysis buffer (MSD R60TX-3) with protease (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt)
and lysates were stored at �80 awaiting analysis. From the lysates viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo� Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay (Promega) according to manufacturer instructions with a modified ratio of lysate to CeLLTiterGlo reagent (1:1) and
pThr231/tTau levels were determined using Phospho(Thr231)/Total Tau kit (K15121D, Meso Scale Discovery). For each 384 well
plate, Z-scores were determined for each data point, as the number of standard deviations from the mean of the control, vehicle-
treated (DMSO) wells. Compounds that decreased pThr231Tau/tTau by Z < �2 in one of the duplicates were selected for confirma-
tional screening (repeat of the methods described for the primary screen). Compounds that decreased pThr231Tau/tTau in an
additional replicate (Z < �2) in the secondary screen were defined as hits.
Ab, pThr231Tau/total Tau, pSer9GSK3b/total Gsk3b, Phospho-4E-BP1(Thr37/46)/total 4E-BP1 ELISA Measurements
For Ab measurements, 25 mL of the culture media was run on a V-PLEX Ab Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) (K150SKE) kit, for pThr231Tau/tTau
lysate was run on a Phospho (Thr231)/Total Tau Kit (K15121D), for pSer9GSK3b/total Gsk3b lysate was run on pSer9GSK3b /total
Gsk3b Kit (K15109D). For Phospho-4E-BP1(Thr37/46)/total 4E-BP1 lysates were run separately on a Phospho-4E-BP1(Thr37/46)
kit (K150KHD) and a total 4E-BP1 kit (K151OLD) and ratio was determined by combining these two measures from the same lysates.
All kits from Mesoscale discovery. Measurements were performed on Mesoscale discovery sector imager 600. For Figure 4D (choles-
terol mutants) purified neurons were replated after FACS and media was collected after 5 days.
Cell viability
From the lysates viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo� Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to manufacturer
instructions with a modified ratio of lysate to CeLLTiterGlo reagent (1:1). CellTiter 96� AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(Promega) and Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were performed in 96-well plates in accordance with
manufacturer instructions.
Mass spectrometry sample preparation and LC-MS-MS
The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of water and then vortexed to thaw the sample. We added 100 ul of cell
suspension to 500ml of 6 Molar Guanidine solution followed by vortexing. The sample was then boiled for 5 minutes followed by 5 mi-
nutes cooling at room temperature, this step was repeated 3 times. The proteins were precipitated with addition of methanol followed
by vortex and centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes. The soluble fraction was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 600ul of
8 M Urea made in 100mM Tris pH 8.0 and by vortexing for 5-10 minutes. TCEP was added to final concentration of 10 mM. The sam-
ple was then frozen overnight at �20C. Next day the solution was thawed and vortexed for another 5 minutes until the solution
became clear. Chloro-acetamide solution was added to final concentration of 40 mM and vortexed for 5 minutes. Equal volume
of 50mM Tris pH 8.0 was added to the sample to reduce the urea concentration to 4 M. Lys C was added in 1:500 ratio of LysC
to protein content and incubated at 37C in a rotating incubator for 4-6 hours. Equal volume of 50mM Tris pH 8.0 was added to
the sample to reduce the urea concentration to 2 M. Trypsin was added in 1:50 ratio of trypsin to protein content. Next day the
solution was acidified using TFA (0.5% TFA final concentration) and vortexed for 5 minutes. The sample was centrifuged at 15,
700 g for 5 min to obtain aqueous and organic phases. The lower aqueous phase was collected and desalted using 100 mg
C18-StageTips as described by the manufacturer protocol. The peptide concentration of sample was measured using BCA after re-
suspension in sample loading buffer and the total of 2 ug is injected for each label free quantification run. Trypsin-digested peptides
were analyzed by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) using
nano-spray ionization. The nanospray ionization experiments were performed using a Orbitrap fusion Lumos hybrid mass spectrom-
eter (Thermo) interfaced with nano-scale reversed-phase UPLC (Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano System) using a 25 cm,
75-micron ID glass capillary packed with 1.7-mm C18 (130) BEHTM beads (Waters corporation). Peptides were eluted from the C18
column into the mass spectrometer using a linear gradient (5%–80%) of ACN (Acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 375 ml/min for 1h. The
buffers used to create the ACN gradient were: Buffer A (98% H2O, 2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) and Buffer B (100% ACN, 0.1% formic
acid). Mass spectrometer parameters are as follows; an MS1 survey scan using the orbitrap detector (mass range (m/z): 400-1500
(using quadrupole isolation), 120000 resolution setting, spray voltage of 2200 V, Ion transfer tube temperature of 275 C, AGC target of
400000, and maximum injection time of 50 ms) was followed by data dependent scans (top speed for most intense ions, with charge
state set to only include +2-5 ions, and 5 s exclusion time, while selecting ions with minimal intensities of 50000 at in which the
collision event was carried out in the high energy collision cell (HCD Collision Energy of 30%), and the fragment masses where
analyzed in the ion trap mass analyzer (With ion trap scan rate of turbo, first mass m/z was 100, AGC Target 5000 and maximum

 injection time of 35ms). Protein identification and label free quantification was carried out using Peaks Studio 8.5 (Bioinformatics
solutions Inc.)
Lipid measurements
For the analysis of cholesterol and its precursors by means of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), treated neurons
were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mL water. 600 mL MTBE and 160 mL methanol was added and samples
were vortexed and shaken at room temperature for 30 minutes. For phase separation 200 mL water was added. Samples were
spun at 16.100 g for 5 minutes and the organic (soluble) extract (350 mL) was separated from the pelleted protein. Extraction was
repeated by the addition of 100 mL methanol, 100 mL water and 300 mL MTBE. After centrifugation the organic extracts were com-
bined (650 mL) and split into two fresh glass vials (one for the total cholesterol fraction (200mL) and one for free cholesterol fraction
(450mL)). Samples were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. For free cholesterol analysis, 10 mL of an internal standard solution
(IS) containing 10 mg/mL cholestane in MTBE, 50 mL of N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), 1 mL of dry pyridine
and 39 mL of MTBE were added to the dried extract. The samples were kept at room temperature for 30 minutes in order to complete
derivatization before injection. For total cholesterol analysis, 10 mL IS solution, 400 mL LC-MS grade water and 100 mL 10M NaOH
were added and samples were heated to 60�C for one hour. After samples had cooled to room temperature sterols were extracted
twice using 750 mL MTBE. The combined organic extracts were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 50 mL of
MSTFA, 1 mL of dry pyridine and 49 mL of MTBE. Samples were kept at room temperature for 30 minutes before injection. GC-MS
analysis was carried out on a ScionTQ GC-MS system (Bruker Daltonics). Helium (99.9990%) was used as carrier gas on an Agilent
VF-5ms column (5% phenyl-methyl; 25 m 3 0.25 mm internal diameter; 0.25 mm film thickness). The injector was kept at 280�C and
1 mL was injected split-less. The oven program started at 50�C, held for 1 minute, followed by a ramp of 50�C/min to 260�C, continued
to ramp with 4�C/min to 310�C, held for 0.3 minutes. Sterols were identified based on their relative retention time and comparison of
electron ionization mass spectra (Giera et al., 2007; M€
uller et al., 2017). For quantification of free and total cholesterol an external
calibration line from 0-500 mg/mL cholesterol was constructed. Total ion current chromatograms were integrated and quantified
by the use of the external calibration lines. Pelleted protein was resuspended in 2% SDS and quantified according to the manufac-
turers instructions using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (cat. no. 23225).
Quantitative cholesterol ester and phospholipid analysis was carried out using a commercial platform (The Lipidyzer, Sciex,
Redwood, CA, USA). In brief, treated neurons were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 mL water and 100 mL internal
standard mixture in methyl-tert.-butyl ether (MTBE). An additional 500 mL MTBE and 160 mL methanol was added and samples were
vortexed and shaken at room temperature for 30 minutes. For phase separation 200 mL LC-MS grade water was added and samples
were spun for 3 minutes at 16.100 3 g. The upper organic layer was transferred to a glass vial. The extraction was repeated after the
addition of 300 mL MTBE, 100 mL methanol and 100 mL water. The combined organic extracts were dried under a gentle stream of
nitrogen and 250 mL running buffer was added. The analysis was carried out using the commercial flow-injection based quantitative
lipidomics platform (The Lipidyzer). For analysis of relative cholesterol ester levels the cumulative concentrations of all cholesterol
esters detected was normalized over the cumulative concentration of all sphingomyelins detected.
Microscopy
After differentiation, neurons were directly fixed or replated on 96-well imaging plates at a density of 2 3 105 living cells per well. Cells
were imaged either 1 week (APPDcholesterol mutants, supplemental 4b) or 2 weeks + 5 days drug treatment (APPdp1-6 lines, Fig-
ure 1C) after replating. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA + 4% sucrose for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 30 minutes and incubated with primary antibodies in 0.5%
BSA/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed 3 times with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies in
0.5% BSA/PBS for 45 minutes and washed 3 more times with PBS (with the first wash containing 1:1000 DAPI). After 3 washes 100 mL
PBS was added to each well and samples were imaged. The antibodies used for immunofluorescence experiments were anti-total

RNA expression analysis
For mRNA expression analysis, RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and DNase-treated using TURBO DNase
(Ambion) for one hour at 37�C. cDNA was generated from RNA primed with oligo(dT) using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen). We performed RT-qPCR using FastStart SYBR Green (Roche) using an Applied Biosystems 7300 RT-PCR
system. Data was analyzed using the delta-Ct method and target genes were normalized to the geometric mean of a housekeeping
gene (RPL27). The following primers were used: HMGCR-F: CGT GGA ATG GCA ATT TTA GGT CC, HMGCR-R: ATT TCA AGC TGA

Quantitative western blot
NPCs were differentiated in 6 wells for 3 weeks and treated for 5 days with compound after which cells were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer
(Millipore) with protease (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt). Protein concentrations were determined (Pierce BCA Pro-
tein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher) and normalized. 4x LDS Sample buffer (novex) + b-mercaptoethanol was added to the lysate to
generate a final concentration of 1x sample buffer + 5% b-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled (100�C) for 5 minutes. Equal
amounts of lysates were run on NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes,
and blocked for one hour at room temperature using Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR). Blots were probed overnight at 4�C using
the corresponding primary antibodies followed by IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR) at 1:5,000 and images were acquired by
LICOR Odyssey imager. Bands were quantified using ImageJ software. Western blot images within one panel showing a composition
of bands of interest for a particular immunogen are always from the same image (identical blot and exposure), but cropped and
grouped together for clarity. Stiches are indicated by vertical lines. Antibodies used were: anti-Actin (1:50,000; EMD Millipore),

Proteasomal levels and activity
After treatment of neurons with the indicated drugs for three days, neurons were incubated with Proteasome activity probe 1 (Berkers
et al., 2007; de Jong et al., 2012) for two hours (250 nM in media). After labeling, cells were harvested and resuspended in HR buffer
(50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM ATP, pH = 7.4). Cell lysis was achieved by sonication (Bioruptor
Pico, Diagenode, high intensity for 5 minutes with an ON/OFF cycle of 30 s) at 4�C. After a centrifugation step (21.100 g for 15 minutes)
to remove cell debris, protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Equal amounts of protein were denatured by boiling in LDS (lithium dodecyl
sulfate) sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol. Polypeptides were
resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE using the NuPAGE system and MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Wet gel slabs were imaged with a resolution of 50 mm, using the Typhoon FLA9800 imaging system (GE), with appropriate filter
settings (l(ex/em) = 480/530 nm). For Western Blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot
Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA solution and subsequently incubated with primary anti-
body overnight at 4�C. After washing with PBS-Tween 20 (0.2%) membranes were incubated with secondary antibody and signals
visualized by using an Amersham Imager 600 RGB (GE) imager or Odyssey Fc (Li-Cor). Western blot images within one panel showing
a composition of bands of interest for a particular immunogen are always from the same image (identical blot and exposure), but
cropped and grouped together for clarity. Stiches are indicated by vertical lines. Immunoblotting with an antibody against GADPH
or actin was used to verify equal protein loading. Antibodies used were: anti-Actin (1:50,000; EMD Millipore), anti-PSMD7 (1:1000
PSMC2 (D5T1T) Rabbit mAb #14395), anti-PSMB5 (1:1,000; Enzo Lifesciences, AB_105409012), anti-GAPDH (1:1000; Life Technol-
ogies, AB_2536381). Secondary antibodies used (1:5000) were HRP-conjugated polyclonal swine anti-rabbit (DAKO Cat# P0217)
and HRP-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse (DAKO Cat# P0161).

pDESTlentiFGA1.0. Viral particles containing the CYP46A1 plasmid, or an GFP-only plasmid (pSyn(pr)EGFPLL3.7) were produced
as described previously (Naldini et al., 1996). In short HEK293T cells were transfected with viral packing plasmids ENV plasmid
p.MDG2:PACK plasmid pCMVDR8.2 together with the transgene vector carrying GFP or CYP46A1. After 24 hours the medium is
replaced, and after 48 hours the medium is harvested and concentrated using amicon filters with 100kDA cutoff (UFC910024,
Millipore). The concentrated virus is then filtered through a 0.2 micron filter, aliquoted and frozen at �80 degrees. For use, virus is
thawed directly prior to vial transduction. For experiments, three week differentiated NPC’s (APPdp1-6) were replated on 96-well
plates (2 3 105 living cells/well) and left to mature for another two weeks, after which they were infected with virus for 24 hours. After
24 hours, and again after 6 days media was replaced with fresh 200 ml NPC base + BDNF/GDNF/cAMP. 13 days after viral transduc-
tion the media was collected for 24-hydroxycholesterol measurements and cells were lysed for pThr231Tau/tTau analysis.
