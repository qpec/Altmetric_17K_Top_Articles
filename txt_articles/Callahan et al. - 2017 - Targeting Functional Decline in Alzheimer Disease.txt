 Measurements—The primary outcome measures was the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative 
Studies Group Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS ADL); performance based measures 
included the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure 
(SPSM)
Results—At baseline, there were no significant between group differences in clinical 
characteristics; the mean MMSE for both groups was 19 (SD=7). The intervention group received 
a median of 18 home visits from the study occupational therapists. Both groups declined in ADCS 
ADL scores over 24 months. At the primary endpoint of 24 months, there were no between group 
differences in ADCS ADL scores (mean difference 2.34, 95% CI −5.27, 9.96). We were also 
unable to definitively demonstrate between-group differences in the mean SPPB or SPSM.
Limitations—The results of this trial are indeterminate and do not rule out potentially clinically 
important effects of the intervention.
Conclusions—We were unable to definitively demonstrate whether the addition of two years of 
in-home occupational therapy to a collaborative care management model slows the rate of 
functional decline among persons with AD. This trial underscores the burden undertaken by 
family caregivers as they provide care for persons with AD and the difficulty in slowing functional 
decline.
Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias lead to a high burden of suffering for 
patients, families, and society.(1) Over the typical disease course of 5–10 years, the 
condition results in progressive functional disability, frequent transitions in care, and excess 
health care costs.(2–5) There is no known cure for AD and no known disease modifying 
treatments.(6) In the context of AD, functional decline is believed to be the result of 
progressive deficits in cognitive, emotional, and physical function.
New models of care for AD focus on team-based care in support of the family caregiver and 
seek to improve patients’ quality of life.(7, 8) These new models of care emphasize 
coordination with community-based services, modifications to the patient’s home, and 
movement toward dementia-prepared communities.(9) Primary care practices often find 
these new models difficult to implement because they require practice redesign, a re-trained 
workforce, community outreach, and leadership in local advocacy. Ten years ago, we 
reported the results of a randomized controlled clinical trial testing the effectiveness of 
collaborative care among primary care patients with AD.(10) The intervention resulted in 
significant improvement in the quality of care and behavioral symptoms for patients and 
reduced stress for their family caregivers. Despite these improvements, the intervention did 
not slow the rate of patients’ functional decline.
Over the past decade, several studies focusing on functional decline among patients with AD 
have shown the potential to slow functional decline through home-based interventions.(11–
16) The specific aim of this study was to conduct a two-year randomized, controlled clinical 
trial to delay functional decline among older adults with AD by comparing a control group 
receiving best practices primary care with an intervention group receiving best practice 
primary care plus a home-based occupational therapy intervention.

 Methods
The study was approved by the Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis 
Institutional Review Board. A detailed description of the study design has been previously 
published.(17) This is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial with a parallel 
design and a 1:1 allocation ratio. The trial was conducted at Eskenazi Health, an urban 
public health system serving Indianapolis, IN. Patients were enrolled from one of ten 
primary care practices or the one senior care practice affiliated with Eskenazi Health. 
Patients were eligible if they were aged 45 years and older and had a diagnosis of possible or 
probable AD as determined by physicians in a memory care practice affiliated with Eskenazi 
Health. Eligibility criteria also included: community-dwelling, English-speaking, a caregiver 
willing to participate in the study who had access to a telephone and was willing to receive 
home visits. For patients meeting eligibility criteria, research personnel assigned to each 
clinical site obtained written informed consent (or assent) from the patient and the 
participating family caregiver. The CONSORT diagram is shown in Figure 1
Randomization was conducted at the patient l evel stratified by type of clinic (primary care 
clinic or senior care clinic). The statistical software SAS was used by the lead statistician 
(SG) to generate the randomization scheme in a block of 4. Sequentially numbered sealed 
envelopes containing the randomization assignment for patient for each of the two clinics 
were prepared by the study statistician. Actual randomization results were compared to the 
pre-planned randomization schedule and no deviation was found.
Description of the Control Condition
Both study groups received collaborative care for dementia facilitated through the Healthy 
Aging Brain Center, a memory care practice which provided co-management with the 
primary care practice.(18, 19) We considered this “best practices primary care” because it 
encompasses the collaborative care intervention tested in our prior clinical trial.(10) Based 
on the caregiver's reports of the patient’s current symptoms using the HABC Monitor,(20) 
individualized recommendations were made to manage a patient's behavioral symptoms.(21) 
Items reported by the caregiver dictated activation of specific behavioral intervention 
protocols by the care manager. Each of these protocols focused first on non-pharmacological 
interventions. If the non-pharmacological approach did not result in acceptable 
improvement, the care manager collaborated with the primary care physician or the memory 
care practice physician to consider protocol-based drug therapy.
Description of the Intervention
A description of the study intervention has been previously published.(22) Briefly, the 
intervention group receives all of the components of best practice primary care described 
above plus a home-based intervention designed to slow functional decline. Any study patient 
or caregiver, regardless of group, could receive any other concomitant care prescribed by 
their providers. The framework of the intervention is based on general occupational therapy 
principles,(22) as well as interventions described in prior published studies.(11–13, 23) The 
main goal was to support and augment the self-care functional capability of the patient as 
identified by goals established in negotiation with the patient and caregiver. The

 occupational therapist completed an initial in-home evaluation to develop a formal care plan 
that was tailored to the needs of the dyad. This evaluation was repeated at the beginning of 
each additional cycle by the occupational therapist. There were three cycles of the home-
based intervention over two years. In the first cycle, there are eight 90-minute sessions 
delivered approximately every other week over 16 weeks. A new task is introduced with 
each visit based on a mutually agreed upon care plan. In the second cycle, the eight home 
visits were next spaced by four weeks and therefore completed over 32 weeks. In the third 
cycle, the eight home visits take place over one year. Phone calls were used to address 
problem solving or new concerns of the caregiver between home visits. Phone calls 
continued in the same progression throughout the three cycles but with more weeks between 
contacts. Over two years, each dyad could receive up to 24 90-minute homes visits by one or 
more of five occupational therapists or one occupational therapist assistant. Initial 
assessments and care plans were completed only by the occupational therapists and not the 
occupational therapy assistant.
Outcome Measures
Outcomes measures were completed in the patient’s home by a team of two research 
assistants who were blinded to the dyad’s randomization status. The primary outcome 
measure was the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Group Activities of Daily Living 
Inventory (ADCS ADL). The instrument assesses the traditional basic activities of daily 
living as well as variations on instrumental activities of daily living and a number of more 
complex and explicit self-care tasks.(24) Scores vary from 0 to 75 with higher scores 
indicating better function. Because this scale is based on self-reports of the caregiver, we 
also completed two patient performance measures. The Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB) is a standardized measure of lower extremity physical performance that includes 
walking, balance, and power tasks (25–27) Scores vary from 0 to 12 with higher scores 
indicating better function. The Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure (SPSM) was 
conceptualized as a measure of sarcopenia that combines muscle quantity and function.(28). 
The scale is based on timed chair rises, lean mass, and grip strength divided by height. 
Scores vary from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicating better function. We previously 
reported good correlation between these three scales and caregiver-reported function across 
a range of subjects’ cognitive function.(29) Those findings suggested that the patients were 
able to adequately understand and follow instructions for performing the SPPB and SPSM. 
To help compare our outcomes with the outcomes of our prior clinical trial of collaborative 
care alone, we also completed the ADCS Group Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at each 
assessment.(30–32) Scores vary from 0 to 144 with higher scores representing worse 
symptoms. We also collected a broad range of process of care data.
Analyses
The study was designed for 80% power based on a two-tailed test at 5% significance level to 
test the hypothesis that subjects in the intervention group will have improved function 
compared to the control group at 24 months with effect size of 0.23 standard deviation based 
on the ADCS ADL. Thus, the targeted sample size was 180 patients. All patients were 
randomized according to randomization scheme and were analyzed in the group to which 
they were randomized. Dementia-specific care processes were compared between the two

 groups using two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and 
Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. For each outcome measure collected at 
baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, a mixed effects model was used with time and an 
interaction between group and time as independent variables while adjusting for 
randomization stratum and within patient correlation over time using an unstructured 
covariance matrix. Main effect for group was not included in the mixed effect models in 
order to enforce the equal group mean assumption at baseline given the randomized trial 
design.(33)
Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the potential impact of missing data (see 
appendix). First, multiple imputation for subjects with missing follow-up data was 
completed for those subjects missing follow-up data not due to death. We used a regression 
imputation approach incorporating the patients’ baseline characteristics as well as observed 
outcomes with separate group means while adjusting for randomization stratum.(34) 
Second, we used a selection model approach in order to adjust for potentially non-ignorable 
missing data). All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4.
The National Institute on Aging had no role in the design, conduct, and analysis of this study 
or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
Results
Table 1 compares the baseline characteristics of the participants. Consistent with a cohort of 
older adults with probable Alzheimer’s disease, the mean age of the study groups 
approaches 80 years, the majority of subjects are women, and subjects’ MMSE and Word 
List Learning scores demonstrate mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Study subjects 
also suffer from significant impairments in activities of daily living and from a high burden 
of behavioral problems. Caregivers showed mild to moderate levels of anxiety and 
depression. Subjects also suffered from a high burden of comorbid conditions including: 
diabetes (30% intervention, 30% control), depression (30% vs. 33%), congestive heart 
failure (12% vs. 16%), coronary artery disease (14% vs. 16%), and history of stroke (4% vs. 
5%).
Table 2 summarizes the level of dementia-specific care received by the two study groups. 
Both groups received best practices primary care for dementia through a locally adapted care 
management program provided in the Healthy Aging Brain Center.(18, 19) In both study 
groups, this dementia care approximates the collaborative care received in an earlier clinical 
trial.(10) All study subjects were diagnosed in a memory care practice and all were referred 
for care management to the home-based dementia care program. The majority of patients 
were treated with anti-dementia medications. There was no difference in the frequency of 
this dementia-specific care between groups.
Table 3 describes the frequency and content of the occupational therapy intervention. Over a 
period of two years, intervention patients received a median of 18 in-home evaluations and 
care visits that totaled 21 hours (median) of face-to-face time in the home with the 
occupational therapists. Because these visits are tailored to meet the expressed needs of the

 individual care recipient-caregiver dyads, and because these needs are expected to change 
over time, the content of the visits vary across subjects and within subjects over time. Table 
3 shows the percentage of visits that focused on individual target areas as reported by the 
occupational therapist following each visit. The focus areas are ordered by frequency in the 
table and demonstrate the dominance of mobility interventions such as transfers, standing, 
household mobility, sitting, and home exercise, all of which were targeted in more the 50% 
of the home visits.
Table 4 compares the clinical outcomes between study groups. At 24 months, there was no 
statistically significant difference between groups in the ADCS ADL. Notably, the results 
are interpreted as indeterminate because the 95% confidence intervals (−5.27, 9.96) include 
clinically significant between-group differences (4.05 based on an effect size of 0.23). Both 
groups experienced progressive functional decline over time. Both groups also declined over 
time in the performance-based measures of the SPPB and the SPSM. In data not shown in 
the table, mean MMSE scores for both groups declined over time: the intervention group 
declined from 19.37 to 16.76; the control group declined from 19.02 to 17.26. There was no 
significant difference in mortality between the study groups over two years (20% vs. 17%) 
or in the average number of days participating in the study (577 vs. 575).
We completed two additional analyses to explore the potential impact of missing data on the 
study outcomes. Data were primarily missing due to death of the subjects. First, we used 
multiple imputation to account for data missing not due to death. Second, we implemented 
the selection model approach by assuming the missing data are not ignorable and depend on 
unobserved outcomes. We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses by varying the 
missing data assumption. Between group differences at 24 months remained non-significant 
in each of these analyses (see appendix).
Discussion
The goal of this study was to determine if a home-based occupational therapy intervention 
delivered over two years could slow the rate of functional decline among older adults with 
AD. Both study groups received best practices dementia care which has been previously 
demonstrated to improve behavioral outcomes and reduce caregiver stress but which did not 
slow functional decline.(10) In that prior trial, both groups declined by approximately 4 
points per year on the 23-item scale ADCS ADL scale which has a range of scores from 0–
75. Based on these findings and other studies in the literature, we estimated that between-
group differences on this ADCS ADL in the range of 4 points over two years could be 
clinically significant. In the current study, we found between group differences of 2.34 
points and we also report 95% confidence intervals that include the potential for clinically 
significant improvement (9.96) and clinically significant decline (−5.27) in the experimental 
group. For this reason, the results of this trial should be considered indeterminate.(35) 
Patients with AD and multiple chronic conditions suffer from a high mortality rate;(2) nearly 
1 in 5 subjects died during the two year follow-up period of this study. However, the study 
findings remained consistent across a range of different analytic approaches to missing data.

 Based on prior shorter-term studies of related interventions,(11–14) we had hypothesized 
that this intervention might slow the rate of functional decline through three potential 
mechanisms. First, the social, physical, and cognitive intervention encompassed by 
occupational therapy might actually slow the pathological processes of AD or stimulate 
compensatory cognitive mechanisms. Second, the intervention might have no impact on AD 
pathology, but instead might improve functional decline emanating from other diseases and 
conditions comorbid with the dementing illness, including frailty from consequential 
behaviors such as inactivity, boredom, or social withdrawal. Third, the occupational therapy 
might have no impact on any disease or the effects of sedentary behavior among the patients, 
but it might improve the caregiver’s perception of functional decline through caregiver 
training in areas such as transfers and toileting. Because caregiver-reported patient function 
and performance-based function measures as well as cognitive function measures continue 
to decline over time in both study groups, we were unable to provide support for these 
posited mechanisms of action for occupational therapy.
The trial has four important strengths beyond the randomized controlled study design. First, 
we were able to compare the impact of the intervention over and above the impact of best-
practices dementia care. This aspect of the trial is fundamental to the examination of the 
unique contribution of longer term occupational therapy. Second, we included a broad range 
of outcome measures that included not only caregiver-reported patient function and 
performance-based measures of function, but also measures of cognition, mood, and 
behavioral symptoms. Third, we were able to document the process of care including the 
content and duration of the occupational therapy intervention, the content of concomitant 
dementia-specific care, and the content of the concomitant primary care and specialty care 
received by these study subjects. Fourth, this is the first trial of occupational therapy among 
persons with probable Alzheimer’s disease that followed subjects over a 2 year period.
Prior research exploring the capacity to slow functional decline in older adults with AD 
using different interventions has produced mixed results.(16, 36–39) In 2013, Pitkala et al. 
reported a home-based exercise study among persons with AD in Finland and compared this 
intervention with group-based exercise and with usual care.(40) Like the current study, the 
authors found that function among all three groups declined over time and that there was no 
significant differences in the SPPB between the groups at 12 months. However, unlike the 
current study, Pitkala et al. found that decline among the home-based exercise group was 
significantly less at 12 months as measured by the caregiver-reported Functional 
Independence Measure. In an accompanying editorial, the author questioned the limited 
clinical significance of this difference.(41) The present study enrolled older adults with 
similar ages and baseline MMSE scores as the Finnish study, but Pitkala et al. enrolled 
volunteer subjects who were able to walk independently at baseline (with or without a 
walking aid) and who had a spousal caregiver. Subjects in the current study were not 
excluded based on those two criteria and were enrolled from clinical populations. Patients in 
the current study had significantly lower SPPB scores at baseline, were less likely to have a 
spousal caregiver, had greater comorbidity, and were followed for two years. In a 2016 
study, Toots et al. completed a randomized trial of intensive exercise among older adults 
with AD enrolled from residential care facilities in Sweden. The intervention included a

 functional exercise program that focused on lower limb strength and balance. This study also 
showed no evidence of a delayed decline in ADLs at 7 months.(42)
The present study has limitations. It is possible that a longer observation period, a more 
intensive occupational therapy intervention, enrollment of older adults earlier in the course 
of their dementing illness or older adults with lower levels of multi-morbidity might produce 
more encouraging results. It is possible that a larger sample size receiving the identical 
intervention might produce more encouraging results. Posited reasons why the intervention 
may have been less effective than anticipated include: (a) subjects may have been unable to 
learn the recommended tasks and activities promoted by the occupational therapy 
interventions; (b) caregivers enrolled in this study may have been less able or less motivated 
than other caregivers; (c) dyads may have had health priorities with regard to functional 
decline that are not captured by the ADCS ADL scale; and (d) occupational therapy may be 
necessary but not sufficient to slow the rate of functional decline and, had our intervention 
combined occupational therapy with other potential interventions, we may have produced 
different results. We stress that this trial is not a test of the potential benefits of occupational 
therapy for acute conditions among older adults with dementia nor is this trial a test of the 
benefits of collaborative care for older adults with dementia.
Long-term home-based occupational therapy is not currently the standard-of-care for older 
adults with Alzheimer’s disease, although many experts recommend strategies that promote 
continued physical, social, and cognitive activity. Medicare Part B and Medicaid do provide 
coverage for outpatient rehabilitation therapy when this therapy meets criteria as “medically 
necessary and reasonable”. For most Medicare beneficiaries, this benefit is capped at ~
$2,000 per year and most beneficiaries would also be responsible for a 20% copayment 
although providers can request additional therapy based on medical necessity. In the present 
trial, subjects were not charged for the occupational therapy intervention but we estimated 
the cost of the occupational therapist effort for our intervention at ~$2100 per year. Our 
original hypothesis did presume that the benefit of occupational therapy in the targeted 
patient population was currently unproven. The definition of medically necessary and 
reasonable would be expected to vary across patients and health insurance plans but would 
often include provisions such that the therapy requires an occupational therapist’s expertise 
and that the service provided could reasonably be expected to provide benefit. For 
rehabilitation services, this benefit often requires that the patient show evidence of 
improvement or maintenance of function based on the provided therapy. From both a clinical 
and a policy perspective, the present study does not provide clear evidence that would 
support a change in current clinical practice or policy coverage.
Our findings suggest that persons with dementia face a steady decline in function that is not 
slowed by collaborative care and that may continue even with the provision of home-based 
occupational therapy. We report indeterminate results regarding the question of whether 
occupational therapy slows the rate of functional decline relative to collaborative care alone. 
Given the burden of caregiving for persons with dementia that is largely shouldered by 
family members, research must focus on identifying strategies that support caregivers in the 
home to provide care to persons with dementia. If the gradual functional decline attributable 
to AD is irreversible, a new generation of assistive devices, home modifications, community
