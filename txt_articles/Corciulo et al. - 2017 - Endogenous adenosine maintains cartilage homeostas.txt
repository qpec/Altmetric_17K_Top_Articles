Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage destruction and chondrocytes have a central
role in this process. With age and inflammation chondrocytes have reduced capacity to
synthesize and maintain ATP, a molecule important for cartilage homeostasis. Here we show
that concentrations of ATP and adenosine, its metabolite, fall after treatment of mouse
chondrocytes and rat tibia explants with IL-1b, an inflammatory mediator thought to
participate in OA pathogenesis. Mice lacking A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) or
ecto-50nucleotidase (an enzyme that converts extracellular AMP to adenosine) develop
spontaneous OA and chondrocytes lacking A2AR develop an ‘OA phenotype’ with increased
expression of Mmp13 and Col10a1. Adenosine replacement by intra-articular injection of
liposomal suspensions containing adenosine prevents development of OA in rats. These
results support the hypothesis that maintaining extracellular adenosine levels is an important
homeostatic mechanism, loss of which contributes to the development of OA; targeting
adenosine A2A receptors might treat or prevent OA.

 O
steoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis,
affecting up to 25% of the population over 65, and 12% of
all cases may be caused by prior joint trauma1,2.
Worldwide in its distribution, the incidence of OA increases
with age and the resulting pain, loss of joint function and
mobility, social isolation, and a broadly reduced quality of life
make OA a condition with a high medical and social impact.
Current treatment options are less than optimal and do not
correct the underlying problem with the result that joint
replacement surgery is often the eventual outcome3.
OA is characterized by changes in every structure in the joint,
including cartilage destruction, synovial inflammation, osteo-
phyte formation, enthesophytes, and significant bony changes4.
The central player in OA is the chondrocyte, which responds to
excess mechanical loading by releasing inflammatory mediators
and proteolytic enzymes causing further cartilage damage5.
In
addition,
age-related
inflammation
contributes
to
the
pathogenesis of OA6.
Adenosine
is
an
endogenously
produced
physiological
regulator and its intracellular and extracellular concentration is
tightly controlled by oxygen consumption, cellular stress and
mitochondrial
functionality.
Extracellular
adenosine
derives
mainly from hydrolysis of ATP (primarily, but not exclusively,
by the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73) and mediates its effects via
activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR
and
A3R).
Adenosine
has
long
been
known
to
regulate
inflammation and immune responses7,8 and work from our lab
and others have demonstrated the importance of adenosine and
its
receptors
in
osteoblast,
osteoclast,
and
bone
marrow
homeostasis9–21. Prior studies have suggested that adenosine
receptors also regulate chondrocyte physiology and pathology in
response to inflammatory stimuli in rodent, equine, bovine and
human
chondrocytes22–26
although
the
specific
receptor(s)
involved are not identified. Removal of endogenous adenosine
(by addition of adenosine deaminase) or blockade of A2AR leads
to cartilage degradation in equine cartilage explants27, although
equine purine metabolism differs from other species as adenosine
deaminase, present in lymphocytes, plasma and extracellular fluid
of most species, is not present in horse lymphocytes or
serum28,29. A3R stimulation has been reported to diminish OA
development in a chemically induced model of OA30, principally
due to the anti-inflammatory effects of A3R agonists.
Mice lacking A2AR were first developed by Chen et al. in 1999
(ref. 31) and, in general, these mice have few obvious defects.
Interestingly, they develop osteopenia as a result of an increase in
osteoclast number and function and they respond abnormally to a
variety of stressors reflecting the loss of the A2AR. However, as
these mice age we note that they have increasing difficulty in
grabbing food, walking and mating. We asked, therefore, whether
the diminished mobility of A2AR-deficient mice might be due to
intrinsic joint disease.
We report here that mice lacking A2AR spontaneously develop
OA, characterized by altered cartilage composition and loss of
cartilage, presence of chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteophytes,
and increased subchondral bone density. Rat articular cartilage
explants release ATP and adenosine and load bearing in the
physiological range induces further increases in extracellular
adenosine
levels.
Interleukin-1b
(IL-1b),
an
inflammatory
mediator that contributes to OA, diminishes ATP and adenosine
release from cultured chondrocytes. Physiological loading of rat
tibia increases adenosine release and is abrogated by IL-1b
treatment. Consistent with the role of adenosine in maintaining
cartilage homeostasis, mice lacking CD73 also develop signs of
OA. Finally, in a rat model of post-traumatic OA, intra-articular
injection of liposomal suspensions containing adenosine prevent
development of OA and this effect is abrogated by co-injection of
an A2AR antagonist, but not an A2BR antagonist. These findings
indicate that extracellular adenosine, acting at A2AR, has a
critical function in the maintainenance of cartilage homeostasis
and that adenosine replacement may be a new approach to treat
or prevent OA.
Results
Mobility of A2AR KO mice. Although the mobility of A2AR
knockout (KO) mice appeared to be limited we confirmed that
deletion of A2AR leads to loss of mobility by subjecting wild-type
(WT) and A2AR KO mice to an open field test to quantitate
movement over time. The A2AR KO mice moved a shorter
distance than WT mice (Fig. 1a, A2AR KO ¼ 664±123 cm versus
WT 1,404±129 cm; Po0.001 (Student’s T-test), moved less
quickly (velocity for A2AR KO ¼ 1.11±0.21 cm s � 1 versus WT
2.34±0.22 cm s � 1; Po0.001 (Student’s T-test)) with increased
time spent in the border of the cage (A2AR KO ¼ 575.5±7.7 s
versus WT ¼ 370.2±45.6 cm s � 1; Po0.001 (Student’s T-test))
and immobile (A2AR KO ¼ 530.8±11.5s versus WT 442.3±15.4s;
Po0.001 (Student’s T-test)). The frequency of rearing, a normal
mouse exploratory behaviour (measured in the first 10 min of the
field test), was also reduced in A2AR KO mice (15±4 times per
10 min, Po0.0001 (Student’s T-test)) compared to WT mice
(51±7 times per 10 min). The capacity of the A2AR KO mice to
run on the rotarod apparatus with a constant acceleration was
also reduced compared to the WT mice (A2AR KO ¼ 86±11 s
versus WT ¼ 145±22 s, Po0.01 (Student’s T-test)).
lCT analysis of knee joints in A2AR KO and WT mice. Because
one potential cause for the difficulty of the A2AR KO mice in
mobility, holding food and breeding could be the development
of arthritis we examined the knees of A2AR KO mice by mCT.
Three dimensional reconstruction of mCT images demonstrated
subchondral bony sclerosis and cartilage subsidence in the
tibial heads of 8-, 12-, 26- and 52-week-old A2AR KO mice
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). Moreover, in the same A2AR KO mice
there were osteophytes that increased in size as the animals aged
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). No bony or cartilaginous changes were
observed in WT mice (Fig. 1b). Moreover mCT analysis revealed a
peak of bone volume, trabecular number and thickness in the
midshaft bone of WT mice that gradually decreased with age. In
contrast, in A2AR KO mice bone does not increase over time and
then begins to decline resulting in an osteopenic phenotype once
the animals reach adulthood. Similar results were obtained for the
bone mineral density values (Supplementary Table 1). In the
subchondral area a significant decrease in bone mineral density
was observed in the femurs of 8 week old mice and in the tibia
and femur of 8 and 12 week old mice (Supplementary Table 2).
The cortical area of the subchondral bone showed an initial
decrease of the bone volume and density at 8 and 12 weeks
and an increase of these parameters in older A2AR KO mice
compared to the age-matched WT mice (Supplementary Table 3).
The bone and cartilage changes observed were similar in male
and female A2AR KO mice.
Histopathological changes in cartilage of A2AR KO mice. The
radiologic appearance of the joints obtained by mCT resembled
changes seen in OA; to confirm that the radiologic changes
reflected OA in the joints of the A2AR KO mice we examined
histologic sections of the knees of these mice. Examination of
hematoxylin-
and
eosin-stained
knees
revealed
progressive
reduction in cartilage thickness in A2AR KO mice compared to
WT mice; these changes were detectable as early as 12 weeks of
age (Fig. 1b). Over time there was increased fibrillation and
thinning of cartilage as well, with increased subchondral bone and

 MMP-13-positive and collagen X (Fig. 1b), osteopontin- and
fibronectin-positive cells in cartilage matrix of the A2AR KO
mice starting as early as 12 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Finally, a composite score for osteoarthritic changes (OARSI
score) showed marked differences between A2AR KO and WT
mice, and the differences increased over time. Increased OARSI
scores were first detectable at 12 weeks of age. Both male and
female A2AR KO mice were affected by OA although the changes
were milder in females than males (e.g., OARSI score at 1 year
4.8±0.6 versus 3.2±0.2, males versus females, respectively,
Po0.05, n ¼ 4-5 for each (Student’s T-test)).
Deletion of A2AR increases MMP-13 and Col10a1 expression.
In contrast to normal resting chondrocytes, chondrocytes from
osteoarthritic cartilage express markers of hypertrophy, for
example, col10a1, in addition to mediators that participate in the
destruction of cartilage, for example, matrix metalloproteases like
mmp13. As expected, chondrocytes isolated from the cartilage of
neonatal WT mice do not express col10a1 or mmp13 mRNA or
protein (Fig. 2). In contrast, chondrocytes from neonatal A2AR
KO mice express both of these markers of OA (Fig. 2). These
findings demonstrate that even shortly after birth chondrocytes
from A2AR KO mice are already dysregulated and the changes
likely contribute to the OA phenotype observed in the A2AR
KO mice.
A2AR expression in human and rat OA. To determine
whether loss of A2AR plays a role in human OA we examined
A2AR expression on chondrocytes in osteoarthritic cartilage.
We observed that A2AR were upregulated in the chondrocytes
of patients with OA and appeared to colocalize with expression
of MMP-13, a reflection of OA changes in chondrocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 3A). Similar results were detected in the
PTOA rat model (Supplementary Fig. 3B).
This change was not surprising as, in prior studies, we and
others had demonstrated that there is upregulation of both A2AR
receptor expression and function following exposure to inflam-
matory stimuli (IL-1b and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)) which
acts as a feedback regulator of inflammation in both murine and
human cells32–37. One explanation for the difference between
A2AR expression in human and murine OA cartilage is that the
findings in A2AR KO mice do not reflect OA development in
humans. Alternatively, the disparity between human and murine
OA cartilage suggests that despite overexpression of A2AR there
is diminished ligand for A2AR and resulting loss of A2AR
function leading to development of OA.
Adenosine and ATP release decrease after Il-1b treatment.
To test the hypothesis that OA chondrocytes release less
adenosine and its precursor, ATP, we quantitated adenosine
and ATP release from cultured neonatal mouse chondrocytes
and determined whether IL-1b treatment altered this release. We
observed that primary mouse chondrocytes release ATP into the
extracellular space and that adenosine is present in supernates of
cultured chondrocytes (Fig. 3). Treatment of primary mouse
chondrocytes with IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1) for 24 h reduced the level of
intracellular ATP (to 61±9% of control, Po0.05 (Student’s
T-test); Fig 3a) and the ATP released into the supernates of
cultured chondrocytes (to 66±3% of control, Po0.001 (Student’s
T-test); Fig 3a). Similarly, IL-1b treatment reduced the adenosine
concentration in the supernates of cultured chondrocytes to 65%
of control (Control ¼ 143±14 nM versus IL-1b ¼ 94±14 nM,
Po0.02, n ¼ 9 (Student’s T-test); Fig. 3b).
To understand how IL-1b treatment reduces ATP and
adenosine release we examined the effect of IL-1b on expression
of ATP transporters (ANKH, pannexin1), the ecto-enzymes
involved in conversion of ATP to adenosine (ectonucleotide
triphosphate dephorphorylase, ENTPD1 and ecto-50nucleotidase,
NT5E) and the transporters responsible for adenosine transport
to and from the extracellular space (nucleoside transporters 1 and
2, SLC29A1 and SLC29A2, respectively). In addition to reducing
intracellular levels of ATP, treatment of murine chondrocytes

 with IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1 for 24 h) significantly reduced expression
of message for all of these molecules (n ¼ 4 for each experiment,
Supplementary Fig. 4).
Because chondrocytes cultured as a monolayer may not behave
like chondrocytes embedded within a matrix we determined
whether there was a similar reduction in ATP and adenosine
release from rat chondrocyte explants. Both ATP and adenosine
(Fig. 3a,b) are released from rat tibial plateau explants and
treatment
of
these
cartilage
explants
with
IL-1b
reduced
adenosine release from cells. We next determined the effect of
weight loading, within the physiologic range, on ATP and
adenosine release from rat cartilage explants and found that there
was a marked increase in adenosine release that was abrogated by
pre-treatment with IL-1b (1,657±177 nM versus 960±57 nM,
respectively, n ¼ 5; Fig. 3c). Interestingly, after loading of explants
there was no detectable change in ATP levels in supernates
IL-1b-treated explants from control although there was nearly
a 2-fold increase in the adenosine concentration (Fig. 3d).
Most likely the increase in adenosine concentration reflects rapid
conversion of ATP to adenosine as the cartilage is loaded.
Reduced capacity to generate extracellular adenosine leads to OA.
Multiple transporters and enzymes are involved in the release
of ATP from cells and conversion of extracellular adenine
nucleotides to adenosine. ANKH and pannexin1 all transport
ATP out of the cell38,39, and while multiple phosphatases can
convert ATP to adenine nucleotides and adenosine it is thought
that ectoenzymes on the cell surface (ENTPD1 and NT5E) play a
critical role in the generation of adenosine available for ligation
of adenosine receptors. Other membrane proteins transport
adenosine into and out of the cell (nucleoside transporters 1 and
2, SLC29A1 and SLC29A2, respectively). Treatment of murine
chondrocytes with IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1 for 24 h) significantly
reduced expression of message for all of these molecules
(n ¼ 4 for each, Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover the treatment
of mouse chondrocytes with IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1) decreased NT5E

 protein expression and its localization on chondrocyte surface
(Fig. 4a).
Mice lacking ANKH develop severe arthritis at an early age and
the joint destruction bears many of the hallmarks of OA, such as
osteophytes40. Mice lacking ENTPD1 have no changes in their
joints (Not shown) but mice lacking NT5E develop mild
osteoarthritic changes in their joints (OARSI score ¼ 1.5±0.84
versus WT ¼ 0.5±0.15) with mild articular cartilage fibrillation,
loss
of
cartilage
proteoglycan
and
osteophytes
(Fig.

Interestingly, humans lacking NT5E develop severe arterial
calcification and have been noted to have periarticular calcifi-
cation and arthritis as well41,42. These results are consistent with
the hypothesis that diminished capacity to generate extracellular
adenosine contributes to the pathogenesis of OA.
Liposomal adenosine protects from OA progression in PTOA rats.
If diminished adenosine levels and A2AR stimulation play a
role in the pathogenesis of OA then adenosine repletion might
represent one approach to the treatment or prevention of OA.
Because
adenosine
itself
has
an
extremely
short
half-life
(measured in seconds) in blood and other bodily fluids due to the
presence of enzymes that degrade adenosine as well as cellular
uptake of adenosine43,44 we formulated adenosine in liposomes to
prolong the half-life of adenosine and tested the effect of
liposomal adenosine preparations on the development of OA in a
rat model of post-traumatic OA. Chondrocytes in rat cartilage
express all four adenosine receptors and immunohistochemistry
analysis shows an increase of A2AR in OA rats compared to the
contralateral healthy knee (Supplementary Fig. 5). Liposomal
adenosine, saline or empty liposomes were injected into the
affected joint at the time of injury (prevention) or beginning one
week later (treatment) and continued in both groups every 10
days for a total of six or five joint injections, respectively (Fig. 5a).
Of note, injection of liposomal adenosine almost completely
prevented joint swelling in the prevention group and markedly
reduced joint swelling in the treatment group over the course of

 the treatment (Fig. 5b). There was almost complete destruction of
the affected tibial cartilage with less destruction in the femoral
cartilage in the saline- and liposome-treated rats whereas
the liposomal adenosine-treated rats were almost completely
protected from cartilage destruction and microCT of hexabrix-
stained cartilage confirms these effects (Fig. 5c). In the rats treated
with the prevention regimen there was complete preservation of
both femoral and tibial cartilage but in the rats treated with the
treatment regimen the reduction in cartilage loss did not achieve
statistical significance (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the gross
and radiologic findings, histologic examination of the joints
demonstrated almost complete protection of the joints by
liposomal adenosine but not by injections of either saline or
empty liposomes (Fig. 5d). In the prevention group treatment
with
intra-articular
injections
of
saline,
empty
liposomes
and liposomal adenosine resulted in OARSI scores of 4.1±0.8,
3.3±0.6 and 1.6±0.4, respectively (Fig. 5d) and in the treatment
group the corresponding OARSI scores were 3.9±0.9, 4.5±0.8
and 0.8±0.3, respectively. Thus, intra-articular administration
of
liposomal
adenosine
nearly
completely
prevented
the
development of OA.
The effect of liposomal adenosine is mediated by A2AR. There
are multiple adenosine receptors the actions of which can be
differentiated by use of appropriate pharmacologic antagonists
and agonists. To determine which adenosine receptors are
involved in this mechanism, we treated rats with liposomal
adenosine plus either an A2AR antagonist (ZM241385), A2BR
antagonist (PSB1115) or A3R antagonist (VUF5574.). The
co-administration of the A2AR antagonist, but not either the
A2BR or A3R antagonist, reversed the effect of liposomal
adenosine injections on joint swelling, cartilage degradation or
chondrocyte expression of MMP-13. Moreover the OARSI scores
of knees from mice treated with liposomal adenosine in the
presence of the A2AR antagonist (8.7±1.8 in the prevention
group and 9.6±2.3 in the treatment group) were markedly
increased compared to those of the knees of rats co-administered
either the A2BR (0.8±1.0 for the prevention group and 1.6±0.8
for the treatment group) or A3R antagonist (1.7±0.6 for the
prevention group and 2.4±0.6 for the treatment group, Fig. 5d)
which did not differ from the values obtained for the rats treated
with adenosine-laden liposomes (see above). These results pro-
vide strong evidence that A2AR mediates the chondroprotective
effects of intraarticular injection of liposomal adenosine.
NF-jB nuclear translocation. We and others have reported
previously that A2AR stimulation inhibits NF-kB translocation
in osteoclast precursors45–53. Because NF-kB activation, a central
event in inflammation, is critical for expression of proteins
associated
with
chondrocyte
hypertrophy
and
cartilage
destruction we determined whether A2AR stimulation regulates
nuclear translocation of NF-kB in chondrocytes as well. We
found that treatment with IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1) increased NF-kB
nuclear
translocation,
an
effect
reduced
by
the
A2AR
agonist CGS21680 in WT chondrocytes. The A2AR antagonist
ZM241385
reversed
the
effect
of
CGS21680
on
NF-kB
translocation.
In

chondrocytes, whether determined by western blotting or by
immunofluorescence of whole cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Discussion
The results presented here provide evidence for a critical
homeostatic mechanism in cartilage. Chondrocytes release ATP
which is converted to adenosine extracellularly; the adenosine
that is present prevents the phenotypic changes in chondrocytes
associated with development of OA via engagement of A2AR.
Disruption of this mechanism, as a result of inflammation, injury
or aging with reduction of intracellular and extracellular ATP and
extracellular adenosine, leads to phenotypic changes in chon-
drocytes with greater expression of MMPs or collagens associated
with cartilage hypertrophy. Moreover, these studies demonstrate
that replacement of adenosine by intra-articular injection of
liposomal preparations of adenosine can restore the homeostatic
equilibrium to cartilage following injury by engagement of A2AR.
Previous studies of equine cartilage explants demonstrate that
removal of extracellular adenosine by treatment with adenosine
deaminase significantly increased the release of NO, MMP-13,
MMP-3 and GAG, a cartilage matrix breakdown product, and
that an A2A agonist reversed this effect. These findings suggested
that A2AR are tonically activated in articular chondrocytes
preventing a shift in chondrocyte phenotype and chondrocyte-
mediated damage to cartilage27. Although this finding was very
interesting the marked difference between horse and other species
with respect to purine metabolism (absent adenosine deaminase
in the serum and nearly absent adenosine deaminase in various
cell types in horses) suggested that horse tissues might be
uniquely dependent on extracellular adenosine to maintain
homeostasis29. Nonetheless, the results reported here indicate
that both mouse and rat chondrocytes and cartilage, respectively,
release
ATP
and
adenosine
which
regulates
chondrocyte
phenotype
in
both
inflammatory
and
non-inflammatory
settings. Although we did not test the hypothesis that loss of
adenosine-mediated regulation of chondrocytes leads to OA-like
changes in human chondrocytes or cartilage the similarity of the
responses to adenosine of equine cartilage and equine, bovine and
human chondrocytes22–27 suggests that the changes we observed
in rats and mice are generalizable.
Although A2AR KO mice have been observed closely in
numerous laboratories for many years their difficulty in mobility
and the diminished use of their limbs in eating and mating was
not remarked on, nor the cause determined. Here we report that
the difficulties in ambulation and other functions are most likely
related to the premature development of OA in A2AR KO mice.
When examined, the A2AR KO mice have radiologic and
histologic characteristics of OA, including the loss of glycosami-
noglycans, collagen, and cartilage matrix with fraying, or
fibrillation,
and
destruction
of
cartilage
matrix,
increased
metalloprotease gene expression and production, chondrocyte
hypertrophy, and development of osteophytes. Interestingly,
despite the loss of bone volume and substance in A2AR KO
mice, previously ascribed to increased osteoclast activity in the
bone of these mice54, we observed increased subchondral bone
density and osteophyte formation, paradoxical findings often
observed in patients with OA55. Mice heterozygous for loss of
A2AR and CD73 were not available for these studies although,
because of the effects of inflammation on enhancing A2AR
function56, it is possible that no difference from WT control mice
would have been detected.
In cartilage samples from human OA patients and from PTOA
rats, we observed an increase of chondrocyte A2AR expression
suggesting that A2AR expression may be a feedback regulatory
change in chondrocytes, as previously described for macrophages
and
endothelium33,36,57.
Indeed,
expression
profiling
of
chondrocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed a
dramatic increase in A2AR expression as well58. Similar to A2AR,
the receptor for the parathyroid hormone (PTH), increases in OA
patients and in a murine model of OA59. The activation of the
PTH receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that signals via Gs
like the A2AR, inhibits articular cartilage degeneration and
promotes cartilage and chondrocyte regeneration59.

 It has recently been appreciated that inflammation plays a
central role in the development of OA60,61 and the findings
reported here provide both confirmation of the hypothesis that
inflammatory stimuli are central to the development of OA and
evidence that tonic suppression of chondrocyte responses to
inflammatory stimuli by A2AR ligation are important for joint
homeostasis. The demonstration that loss of A2AR leads to
premature OA in mice suggests that targeting A2AR might
provide a useful approach to the prevention of cartilage
deterioration in patients with OA. Indeed, recent studies
suggest
that
methotrexate
treatment
for
patients
with
symptomatic knee OA provides at least symptomatic relief
of
OA62
and
many
of
the
anti-inflammatory
effects
of
methotrexate are mediated by methotrexate-induced increases
in extracellular adenosine levels acting at A2AR and A3R63.
In the therapeutic trials of MTX in OA no attempt was made to
evaluate changes in cartilage homeostasis or changes in cartilage
destruction and it is unlikely that the short time frame of
these studies could have permitted any demonstration of the
effects of methotrexate on progressive cartilage loss or other
manifestations of OA.
Although we observed a variety of effects of A2AR loss on
chondrocytes and cartilage, it is likely that the loss of A2AR in
other cells present in the synovium contributed to the develop-
ment of OA. For example, an increase in osteoclast differentiation
and function leads to marked osteopenia in A2AR KO mice54.
Similarly, adenosine acting at A2AR diminishes expression of a
variety of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF,
which likely play a role in the pathogenesis of OA8. Thus,
tonic A2AR-mediated suppression of inflammatory responses
maintains joint homeostasis and one approach to preventing and
treating OA is to target A2AR. Nonetheless, testing of conditional
A2AR knockouts and selective A2AR knockout on development
of OA will yield a more nuanced understanding of the basis of the
spontaneous OA in the A2AR knockout mice.
In our studies we used a liposomal formulation to prolong the
presence of adenosine in the joint. Indeed, preliminary studies in
which we injected an aqueous solution of an A2AR agonist into
joints had no effect on joint swelling or development of structural
changes in the joint after anterior cruciate ligament disruption
(C.C. and B.N.C., unpublished observation). We administered
the liposomal adenosine preparations in both treatment and

Figure 6 | Endogenous adenosine maintains cartilage homeostasis. Here we provide a conceptual model of the role of adenosine production and
adenosine receptor ligation in inflammation and in the pathogenesis of OA. Adenosine is generated which ligates A2AR maintaining homeostasis in
cartilage after mechanical loading and other stresses. A2AR ligation exerts an anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effect by blocking NF-kB nuclear
translocation and promoting production of growth factors. During OA progression a decrease of adenosine in the extracellular space occurs due partially to
IL-1b effect on ATP and adenosine transporters and the enzymes involved in ATP/ADP catabolism. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial number, observed in
OA chondrocytes, contributes to diminished cellular ATP levels. Moreover, production and release of adenosine deaminase by inflammatory cells can
exacerbate the progression of OA by further reduction of adenosine levels (unpublished figure created by C.C.).

 prevention groups of rats and prevented or treated joint swelling
similarly. We were surprised to observe that there was less
structural damage to the joints, as reflected by a better OARSI
score, in the rats in which the initial injection of liposomal
adenosine was delayed for a week after knee injury. The likely
explanation for this effect is that the initial spike in inflammatory
cytokines in the joint following injury of the knee which leads
to chondrocyte expression of enzymes capable of destroying
cartilage also leads to enhanced expression and function of A2AR
in the injured tissue and, thus, a greater adenosine response.
It has long been appreciated that ATP levels are decreased in
OA chondrocytes and this reduction in cellular ATP content
may result from the effects of age, injury or inflammation on
mitochondria6. Our results are consistent with these observations
and suggest how reduced intracellular ATP in chondrocytes could
lead to diminished ATP release into the extracellular space
resulting in diminished resistance to the phenotypic changes in
chondrocytes that are associated with development of OA.
Nonetheless, the reduction in ATP release observed here is
greater than the reduction in intracellular ATP levels suggesting
the possibility that there is also a reduction in the capacity of
chondrocytes to export ATP. There are a number of transporters
that can export ATP to the extracellular space including ANKH
and pannexins38,39 and ANKH expression is markedly reduced
after exposure to IL-1 (ref. 64) although the effect of injury or
inflammatory mediators on pannexin-1 or pannexin-3 expression
and function is less well established. Interestingly, loss of
pannexin-3 is protective in murine models of OA suggesting
that this protein is not involved in the phenomena studied here65.
The observation that mice lacking expression of ANKH develop
arthritis consistent with OA at an early age further supports the
hypothesis that extracellular adenosine, derived from ATP, plays
a homeostatic role in cartilage.
Further evidence for the importance of adenosine in the
maintenance of cartilage and joint homeostasis is provided by the
spontaneous OA observed in NT5E KO mice. This ecto-enzyme
catalyses the hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine and prior studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
loss
of
CD73
activity
leads
to exaggerated inflammatory responses66. Recently patients
lacking CD73 have been described and while diffuse large
artery calcification dominates the clinical picture nearly all of
these patients suffer from a poorly characterized arthritis
with associated periarticular calcification41,42. The rheumatic
manifestations observed in these patients are consistent with the
notion that relative deficiencies in adenosine are deleterious for
the structures of the joint.
Another ectoenzyme, ENTPD1, which catalyses the hydrolysis
of
ATP
and
ADP
to
AMP,
also
plays
an
important
role in endogenous suppression of inflammation although
there are a number of other extracellular phosphatases capable
of
hydrolysing
ATP,
such
as
tissue
non-specific
alkaline
phosphatase66. Although we were surprised that ENTPD1 KO
mice did not develop OA it is likely that these other phosphatases
hydrolysed sufficient ATP to adenosine to maintain homeostasis.
We conclude that adenosine, acting at A2AR, is an important
homeostatic
regulator
of
chondrocytes
and
cartilage
and
adenosine repletion may represent a novel approach to treating
OA (Fig. 6).

Animals. Mice and rats employed in this study were kept under regular lighting
conditions (12 h light/dark cycles) and given food and water ad libitum. Adenosine
A2A receptor knockout (A2AR KO) mice and CD73 knockout (CD73 KO) mice,
both bred on a C57BL/6 backgound, were kindly provided respectively by Dr Jiang
Fan Chen (Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) and Dr Linda
Thompson (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Male
and female A2AR KO and CD73 KO mice were bred onto a C57BL/6 background
(Z10 backcrosses). Mice were bred and raised in the same facility (Taconic
Bioscence), receiving the same food and care. At the time of the experiments mice
were transferred to the NYUSoM Medical Center animal facility. Genotyping was
performed by PCR, as previously reported67. WT and A2AR KO newborn mice,
both males and females, were used for chondrocyte extraction from knee joint.
Mice were killed by CO2 narcosis.
Sprague Dawly male rats were used in the experimental OA induction (n ¼ 5–6
for each group) and for tibia collection in the ex vivo tibia loading experiment
(n ¼ 10).
All protocols for experimental procedures involving the use of animals were
approved by the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Motor test. To test for and quantitate any motor impairment, two different motor
tests were performed on WT and A2AR KO 25 weeks old mice. Mice (n ¼ 5 for
each group) were acclimated in the apparatus for 1 h before the test.
Spontaneous locomotor activity was analysed using the open-field test. Mice
were placed into the center of a chamber 25 � 25 � 25 cm to allow free exploration.
The experiments were performed for 30 min on 2 consecutive days. Total travel
distance, velocity, time spent in the border and immobility time were measured by
computerized analysis at 10 min intervals. The number of rearings was quantitated
in the first 10 min interval. Mice behaviour was recorded and videos were analysed
by use of EthoVision XT software (Noldus, The Netherlands).
Forced locomotor activity was tested by using the rotarod test. Mice were placed
on a rotarod apparatus (AccuRotor Rota Rod -Accuscan Instruments, Columbus,
OH) and tested for 5 min with a constant acceleration from 4 to 40 r.p.m. The
latency to fall was registered for each animal. To exclude differences in learning
skills between the two groups of mice, each group was assessed over three trials per
day for 2 consecutive days. Mice were given a 30 min inter-trial rest interval.
Tibial explant loading experiments. 14 to 19 week old male Sprague-Dawly rats
were killed and their tibias were collected. The soft tissue was removed from the
bone and the proximal tibia was cut in the growth plate region by using a Low
Speed Diamond Wheel Saw- Model 650 (South Bay Technologies, CA, USA). Tibia
surface was cut separating the medial and the lateral condyle. Samples were
incubated in media containing DMEM-F12, FBS 10%, 100 mg ml � 1 of ascorbic
acid, 2 mM of L-glutamate, 1% of Penicillin, Streptomycin and amphotericin.
The explants were incubated with or without IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1) for 24 h. After
incubation the samples were placed in a glass plate in new media without FBS. The
loading was programmed using the block waveform feature in Wintest 7 software
of BOSE Electroforce 3200 system (Bose, Inc., MN, USA). The specimens were
preloaded with uniaxial compressive load that was applied at 0.005 mm s � 1
loading rate under displacement control up to 0.01 mm. Samples undergo cyclic
load at 2 Hz for 1,800 cycles at 1.5N compressive load under load control. Dwell for
2,700 s immediately after the end of 1,800th cycle. Media samples were collected
after 1, 10 and 15 min during loading and 15 and 30 min after loading. Samples
collected for ATP assay were stored immediately on ice. Samples used for ade-
nosine extraction were collected in tubes containing Trichloroacetic acid (1:1, v/v).
PTOA induction in rats and liposomal adenosine treatment. The post-
traumatic OA (PTOA) model used is a non-invasive method for inducing anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture in rat knees in vivo with a single load of tibial
compression. We chose this model in rats because of the technical ease in injecting
the knees of these animals and because correction of an induced lesion would better
mimic the situation in humans. The procedure was performed under anesthesia

 (1–3% isoflurane) as previously described68. All experimental groups of rats, as
described below, consisted of 3 rats and each experimental group was repeated
once (total of 6 rats per experimental group). This number of rats was chosen
because larger group sizes led to operator overload and diminished quality of
results. To have a 490% power to detect a 70% reduction in OARSI score using an
analysis of variance with repeated measures, with an a error probability of 0.05 and
three groups, we will need a minimum of six animals for each condition. Animals
were not randomized for these studies.
Rats were treated with intra-articular injections of 100 ml of a liposomal
suspension containing a high concentration of adenosine (10 mg kg � 1), empty
liposomes or with saline for 8 weeks. In some experiments rats were injected
intraarticularly with 100 ml of liposomal suspensions of adenosine plus ZM241385
(1 mg kg � 1), adenosine plus PSB1115 (1 mg kg � 1), adenosine plus VUF5574
(1 mg kg � 1). The animals were separated into two main cohorts, the prevention
group received injections commencing immediately after ACL rupture, and the
treatment group received the first injection 7 days after ACL rupture. Injections
were performed every 10 days thereafter in both groups. Knee swelling and weight
in the rats were measured before every injection. At the end of the experiment rats
were killed and both legs were collected for immunohistochemistry and micro-
computed tomography (mCT) analysis.
Liposome preparation. Liposomes were prepared fresh the day before injection.
Ethanol was added to soybean oil containing adenosine, or adenosine plus
adenosine receptor antagonists. The lipid phase containing phosphatidyl choline
and cholesterol (1:0.5 by molar ratio) was added to the previous solution and
emulsified at 15,000 r.p.m. for 10 min. Saline along with glycerin was then added to
the lipid phase and was homogenized at 15,000 r.p.m. for 20 min followed by
sonication for 1 min at 100% duty cycle.
Measurement of adenosine concentration by HPLC analysis. To measure
adenosine content in the culture medium, 400 ml of the samples were added to
a similar volume of thrichloroacetic acid (10% v/v) and then extracted with
Freon-octylamine. The HPLC separation of adenosine was achieved by applying
the samples to a C18m Bondapack column (Water Chromatohaphy, Div., Milford,
MA) and eluted with a 40% linear gradient of 0.01 M ammonium phosphate
(pH 5.5) and methanol with a 1.5 ml min � 1 flow rate. Adenosine was identified by
retention time and the characteristic spectrum of ultraviolet absorbance. The
adenosine concentration was determined by comparison to standards.
To test adenosine retention in liposomes, liposome particles were centrifuged at
100,000 g in an ultracentrifuge (Optima L-90K Beckman Coulter) for 15 min at
4 �C, free adenosine was collected from the supernate and different dilutions were
tested by HPLC. 73% of the adenosine was retained in the liposomes.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. After killing, both hind legs were excised
from WT and A2AR KO mice (4 animals for each group). Left hind limbs, assigned
to immunohistochemistry analysis, were cleaned of soft tissue, placed into 4% PFA
for 48 h, and decalcified in 10% EDTA for 4 weeks. Paraffin-embedded histological
sections (5 mm) were cut, mounted and prepared for analysis with hematoxylin and
eosin and Safranin O/Fast green staining to assay different cartilage components.
Collagen X, MMP-13 were detected in cartilage by immunohistochemistry. Briefly,
joint sections were deparaffinized by xylene and re-hydrated in decreasing ethanol
concentrations. Sections were depleted of endogenous peroxidase activity with 3%
H2O2 in methanol, then blocked with PBST containing bovine serum albumin (1%)
and FBS (5%) for 60 min. Sections were incubated overnight with rabbit antibody
(1:200 dilution) specific for each protein under study. After rinsing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody was applied and stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit.
Slides were scanned using a Leica microscope equipped with Slidepath Digital
Image Hub version 3.0 Software. Assessment of OA was performed by evaluation
of Safranin-O stained slides in a blinded fashion. OARSI score was determined
blindly as previously described69. Briefly, for histologic scoring, slides were stained
using Safranin-O Fast Green technique. The OA severity is determined by using a
0–6 scoring system: 0 for normal cartilage; 0.5 in case of loss of Safranin-O without
structural changes; 1 for small fibrillation without loss of cartilage; 2 when vertical
clefts were present; 3, 4, 5 and 6 when vertical clefts and erosion covered o25%,
25–50%, 50–75%, 475% of the articular surface, respectively.
For rat experiments, after killing both legs were excised and fixed with 4% PFA
for 48 h and then preserved in 70% ethanol. After mCT analysis the samples were
washed with PBS and decalcified in 10% EDTA for 4 weeks. Histology and
immunohistochemistry were performed as previously described and OARSI score
determined blindly for each specimen taking into account the severity of cartilage
degradation, cartilage calcification, presence of osteophytes and their size70.
Paraffin sections of human cartilage from a bone excised were supplied by the
BioRepository Center of the NYU Langone Medical Center and by National
Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, USA). Samples were collected from
deidentified specimens collected at the time of joint replacement or specimens of
normal cartilage were purchased from the National Disease Research Interchange.
The cartilage was collected from two OA patients undergoing total knee
replacement surgery and provided without identifiers other than gender and age.
Following incubation with primary antibodies slides were incubated with anti-
rabbit FITC and anti-mouse TRITC, and imaged under fluorescence microscopy.
Mouse bone evaluation by lCT. After killing right hind limbs from mice were
disarticulated and used for morphology and measurement of bone features by mCT.
After fixation in 70% ethanol, femora and tibiae of each sample were scanned with
a SKYSCAN-1172 instrument and analysed for subchondral bone density. Briefly,
serial 12.5-mm tomographic images were acquired at the condition of 70 kV and
113 mA. Constant thresholds (200) were performed in binary images to segment
bone from bone marrow. 2D and 3D images were obtained and the region of
interest (ROI) in subchondral bone was defined as a sclerotic area contouring from
the bone surface above the growth plate.
lCT cartilage examination. After washing with PBS, rat knees (femoral and tibial
surfaces, n ¼ 3 for each group) were incubated in PBS containing the ionic contrast
agent Hexabrixr (40% v/v) for 6 h. All joints were evaluated in a (16 mm) scanning
tube providing a volex size of 10.5 mm and scanned at 55 kV, 181 mA, 110 min of
acquisition time. During scanning the samples were wrapped in paper soaked in
PBS to avoid dehydration.
Mouse primary chondrocyte extraction and culture. Articular chondrocytes
were obtained from C57BL/6 WT or A2AKO newborn mice following a protocol
previously described71. Primary chondrocytes (80% confluence) were starved for
14 h. Cells were treated for 24 h with mouse recombinant IL-1b (5 ng ml � 1) in
DMEM containing 10%FBS and 1% Penicillin-Steptomycin. For intracellular ATP
assay, cells were collected and lysed with RIPA buffer containing proteases and
phosphatase inhibitors. For extracellular ATP and adenosine assays, complete
media was replaced with DMEM without FBS and samples were collected after
10 min. ATP was assayed using a bioluminescent ATP determination kit following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Adenosine was extracted and tested by HPLC as
previously described. ATP and adenosine data were normalized following protein
quantification.
Protein extraction and western blotting assay. After cell treatments, the total
protein extracts were collected and stored at � 80 �C. Total protein fractions were
quantified using the BCA kit (Thermo Scientific). For the evaluation of NF-kB
nuclear translocation, cells were collected after 10 min of treatment. Then cells were
collected and nuclei and cytosolic protein componetns were separated using
NE-PER kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacter’s protocol.
Western blotting was performed by electrophoresing 10 mg ml � 1 protein
through a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose
membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 �C with the
specific primary antibody (1:1,000), and after washing, incubated with goat
anti-rabbit IRDye 800 CW and goat anti-mouse IRDye 680 RD (1:5,000).
Membranes were scanned with Li-cor Odyssey equipment and the intensities of the
protein bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using Image Studio 2.0.38
software.
Reverse transcription and Real Time PCR. RNA extraction was performed from
mouse primary chondrocytes using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Invitrogen) and
QIAshredder colums (Qiagen, Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA reverse transcription was performed using the MuLV Reverse Transcriptase
PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems). After RNA reverse transcription to cDNA, real time
PCR reactions were performed for a relative quantification of COL10a1 (forward:
50-TTCTGCTGCTAATGTTCTTGACC-30; reverse: 50-GGGATGAAGTATTGTG
TCTTGGG-30), Mmp-13 (forward: 50-TGTTTGCAGAGCACTACTTGAA-30;

AAG-30; reverse: 50-AAGGCAGCGAGATACAGGAA-30) performed on a
Stratagene Mx3005P (Agilent Technologies) with Brilliant SYBR Green Kit QPCR
Master Mix (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides and, after the
appropriate treatments, were washed with cold PBS and fixed with cold methanol
(10 min). Cells were permeabilized using a solution of PBS containing Triton 0.25%
for 10 min. After 3 washes for 5 min each, a blocking solution (FBS 5%, BSA 1% in
PBST) was added to the cells for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibody
against collagen-X, MMP-13, CD73 or NF-kB antibody overnight. Cells were
washed 3 times for 5 min each with PBS and incubated with the secondary
antibody FITC conjugate (1:200 in PBST) for 1 h and with with 0.5 mg ml � 1 of
TRIC-labelled Phalloidin for 30 min. After 3 washes of 5 min each, a cover slide was

 applied to the slide witha mounting media containing DAPI. Immunfluorescence
was revealed by the Nikon Eclipse Ni fluorescence compound microscope.
Data analysis. mCT analysis of bone and cartilage volume was performed using
CTvox software to reconstruct 2D and 3D images and to calculate various bone
characteristics. Amira software (FEI, Oregon-USA) was used to reconstruct
mice and rat joints from mCT data based on differential density of bone and
Hexabrix-treated cartilage. Statistical significance for differences between groups
was determined using Student’s T-test, two-way or one-way analysis of variance,
as appropriate, using GraphPad software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). If the
overall differences were significant (Fo0.05) then differences between groups were
analysed by Bonferroni post hoc testing.
