Introduction: Haemophilia treatment varies significantly between individuals, countries and regions and details of
bleed rates, factor consumption and injection frequency are often not available. Aim: To provide an overview of
the FVIII/FIX treatment practice and outcome for patients with haemophilia A (HA) or haemophilia B (HB) across
Europe. Methods: Non-interventional, 12-month retrospective study where anonymized data were retrieved from
haemophilia centres/registers in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Male
patients (all ages) receiving coagulation factor treatment 24 months prior to the study, with basal FVIII/FIX levels
≤5 IU dL�1, without inhibitors, were included. Data were summarized descriptively. Results: In total, 1346
patients with HA and 312 with HB were included in the analysis; 75% and 57% had severe disease (FVIII/
FIX < 1 IU dL�1) respectively. Prophylaxis was most common for severe haemophilia, especially for children,
whereas on-demand treatment was more common for moderate haemophilia in most countries. The mean (SD)
prescribed prophylactic treatment ranged from 67.9 (30.4) to 108.4 (78.1) (HA) and 32.3 (10.2) to 97.7 (32.1)
(HB) IU kg�1 per week, across countries. Most patients on prophylaxis were treated ≥3 times/week (HA) or two
times/week (HB). The median annual bleeding rate (ABR) for patients on prophylaxis ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 for
severe HA, and from 1.0 to 6.0 for severe HB, while those with moderate haemophilia generally had slightly
higher ABRs. Median ABRs for on-demand-treated severe HA ranged from 4.5 to 18.0, and for HB, 1.5 to 14.0.
Conclusion: Treatment practice varied greatly between centres and countries and patients treated on-demand and
prophylactically both experienced bleeds, emphasizing the need for further optimization of care.

 prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe
haemophilia, there is no general agreement about
how this should be provided [1]. Furthermore, there
is no agreement about how patients with moderate
severity haemophilia with frequent bleeding, should
be managed [2].
The efficacy of prophylaxis depends, to a large
extent, on the dose-interval and the dose adminis-
tered, and the age at the start of treatment. The regi-
mens commonly used can be characterized by high-,
intermediate- and low-dose protocols as exemplified
by the practice in Malm€
o, Utrecht and Beijing [3,4].
As there is accumulating evidence that early haemar-
throses
may
initiate
progressive
haemophilic
arthropathy, it is important to minimize bleeds dur-
ing childhood to prevent disabling arthropathy later
in life [5–7].
Health care budgets are frequently constrained and
there is therefore a need to demonstrate the cost effec-
tiveness and clinical effectiveness of different prophy-
lactic regimens. The annual bleeding rate (ABR) is
used as a surrogate marker for the effectiveness of
therapy; bleeding into joints being a particularly perti-
nent measure.
Haemophilia management varies across Europe and
the extent to which prophylaxis is available and effec-
tively implemented is largely unknown [8]. Insight
into the efficacy of different treatment regimens and
their relationship with clinically important measurable
outcomes may be obtained by reviewing current treat-
ment practice.
This study was designed to see what insights into
haemophilia care could be obtained by reviewing
practice across different countries. The study reports
retrospective data and provides a snap-shot overview
on clotting factor use with on-demand and prophylac-
tic therapy and ABRs in severe and moderate haemo-
philia A and B at 11 centres, one local register and
one national register in seven European countries.
Subjects and methodology
Subjects
Male patients with moderate (basal FVIII/FIX level
of 1 to ≤5 IU dL�1) or severe (basal FVIII/FIX level
of <1 IU dL�1) haemophilia A or B without inhibi-
tors in the previous 24 months were included. All
patients were required to have been treated with
FVIII/FIX for at least 24 months prior to the study.
Patients participating in any interventional haemo-
philia clinical trial during this study were excluded.
The study was approved by the regulatory authori-
ties and independent ethics committees and informed
consent was obtained from the patient or patient’s
legal representative, if applicable according to legal
regulation.
Study design
This was a multinational, non-interventional, retro-
spective study where data were collected from haemo-
philia centres or registers covering a 12-month period
specifically selected for each site between 2012 and
2014. Centres and registries were selected based on
having a large number of eligible patients and repre-
senting
recognized
haemophilia
treatment
centres.
Data were collected by direct transfer from databases
or by manual transfer from patient charts to electronic
case report forms.
Sample size and study populations
As the study was descriptive in nature, no formal sam-
ple size calculation was applicable. The total sample
size reported from each site depended on data avail-
ability. The study population included all enrolled
patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and
for whom key data could be verified. The investigator
judged if the bleed information was complete and
included only patients for whom reliable bleed data
were available for the full 12-month study period in
the bleed population. Collection of bleed data was an
optional study variable.
At most centres, all eligible patients were included
except for one centre (Bonn, Germany), with high
access to patient data; 200 patients with haemophilia
A were randomly selected for study inclusion to limit
the data entry burden. At this centre, patients with
moderate haemophilia A were not included in the
study. Patients at two centres in France and Spain
were also randomly selected since all could not be
included due to local resource constraints. All haemo-
philia B patients satisfying the inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria were included, except at one centre in France,
where a limited number of patients were randomly
selected due to resource constraints.
Databases
Data from two registers were included. The National
Haemophilia Database (NHD) is a register of patients
with bleeding disorders in the UK, maintained by the
UK
Haemophilia
Centre
Doctors’
Organization
(UKHCDO)
[9].
Haemtrack
is
a
national
online
patient-reporting treatment diary system developed by
UKHCDO and endorsed by the UK Haemophilia Soci-
ety. Patients report the amount of factor used and the
reason for treatment (prophylaxis, on-demand, treat-
ments for bleeds etc.) and the outcome of treatment.
Thus, Haemtrack represents patients self-perceived
bleeding data and actual factor administered. Data
from April 2012 to March 2013 were censored to
include only patients who appeared as compliant users
of the Haemtrack mobile application.

 The Malm€
o register is a local register in Sweden
from which data from 2012 were retrieved for this
study [10].
Definitions
Prescribed dose: the amount of FVIII/FIX prescribed
as prophylaxis by the treating physician during the
12-month study period as indicated in the patient
records. Total issued dose: the amount of factor dis-
pensed, e.g. from pharmacy, home delivery or clinic,
to the patient. The total used dose: the amount of fac-
tor administered as indicated in the patient records.
Collection of either issued or used dose, or both, was
a study requirement, while prescribed dose was a
requirement for patients on prophylaxis only (except
for UK where prescribed dose was not part of the
available dataset).
Treatment regimens.
1. Regular prophylactic treatment: prescribed pro-
phylactic
treatment
for
at
least
45 weeks
(315 days) during the study period [11].
2. On-demand treatment: no prescribed prophylaxis.
3. Partly prophylactic treatment: prescribed prophy-
laxis but did not fulfil the criteria for regular pro-
phylaxis, e.g. ‘activity prophylaxis.’
For UK, the treatment regimen was estimated based
on patients’ reported injection frequency and treat-
ment as ‘for prophylaxis’ (Haemtrack):
1. Regular prophylactic treatment: at least two injec-
tions/week (haemophilia A) or at least one injec-
tion/week (haemophilia B) for ≥45 weeks during
the study period.
2. On-demand treatment: no reported regular pro-
phylaxis.
3. Partly prophylactic treatment: reported prophy-
laxis but did not fulfil the criteria for regular pro-
phylaxis.
Dosing frequency. The frequency of prescribed pro-
phylactic dose was recorded in the eCRFs as daily,
every other day, three times a week, twice a week
or other (haemophilia A) and as once a week,
twice a week or other (haemophilia B). For the
UK, the injection frequency was estimated from the
patient’s
individual
recordings
and
the
average
number of injections/week was calculated for each
patient.
Annual bleeding rate. Type of bleed was defined as
joint, muscle/soft tissue, mouth, other or unknown
location. ABRs were estimated based on the total
number of bleeds perceived by each individual during
12 months. ABRs for all locations as well as joint
bleeds are presented.
Results
Demographics
A total of 1346 haemophilia A and 312 haemophilia
B patients were included in the full analysis. Children,
adolescents and adults were all represented (Table 1).
The highest average age for both haemophilia A and
B was in Belgium (39.6 and 37.0 years respectively)
and the lowest was in Spain (26.2 and 30.5 years
respectively). The proportion of patients with severe
haemophilia A ranged from 63% (UK) to 99% (Ger-
many). The high proportion in Germany was due to
an active selection of patients with severe haemophilia
A for study inclusion at one of the two German cen-
tres. For haemophilia B, the proportion of patients
with severe disease ranged from 14% (Belgium) to
74% (Germany). The use of recombinant, compared
to plasma-derived, products varied considerably across
countries. There was a higher proportionate use of
recombinant products for haemophilia A (74–98%),
than for haemophilia B (34–100%) between countries.
While some countries issued almost exclusively recom-
binant products, others used a considerable proportion
of plasma-derived concentrates for both haemophilia
A and B. Children with haemophilia A from all coun-
tries were treated almost exclusively with recombinant
products, whereas older individuals were more likely
to be receiving plasma-derived products (Table S1).
Treatment regimen
Regular prophylaxis was overall the most common
treatment regimen for severe haemophilia A (Fig. 1),
with some variation both between and within coun-
tries (Figure S1). The proportion receiving prophylaxis
was highest in children and decreased with increasing
age. For patients with moderate haemophilia A, on-
demand treatment was overall the most common
treatment regimen with no observed trend across age
groups (Fig. 1).
For patients with haemophilia B, regular prophy-
laxis was most common for severe haemophilia B in
four out of seven countries, whereas on-demand treat-
ment was the most common regimen for patients with
moderate severity in four out of seven countries
(Fig. 2). The limited number of patients did not per-
mit analysis by age.

 on regular dose frequencies and not those on ‘other’
dose frequencies, which may influence the data from
countries with a higher proportion of ‘other’ dose fre-
quencies (Fig. 3). The consumption of clotting factor
concentrate was slightly higher for patients with sev-
ere disease than for moderate disease in five out of the
seven countries. For children with haemophilia A who
were <12 years of age, the mean (SD) treatment var-
ied from 75.7 (54.5) to 240.2 (122.5) IU kg�1 per
week across countries. In four out of seven countries,
these doses were higher compared to those for older
patients (Table S3). Since information on prescribed
treatment was not available from the UK, issued treat-
ment is presented instead.
The prescribed dose was not available for patients
receiving on-demand treatment, therefore used dose is
presented instead. The mean (SD) amount of on-
demand treatment varied between countries from 6.7
(4.1) to 26.0 (29.9) IU kg�1 per week [equivalent to
348.4 (214.3) to 1351.7 (1557.2) IU kg�1 per year]
for haemophilia A, and from 0 to 32.2 (18.6) IU kg�1
per week [equivalent to 0–1675.9 (968.1) IU kg�1 per
year] for haemophilia B (Table S4).
Dosing frequency
The most common dose frequencies for patients on
regular
prophylaxis,
including
both
severe
and
moderate
haemophilia
A,
were
‘three
times
a
week’ followed by ‘twice a week’ (Fig. 3). For
Sweden, a substantial proportion of patients with
haemophilia
A
(23%)
had
‘other’
as
dose
fre-
quency, which represented patients with individual-
ized treatment, most of which were irregular dose
frequencies of ≥3 times a week. Similarly, the high
proportion of ‘other’ dose frequency for haemophi-
lia B in Germany (50%) also represented mostly
individualized
treatment.
Daily
prophylaxis
was
given to 14% and 16% of patients in Sweden and
Germany
respectively.
In
other
countries,
daily
prophylaxis
was
less
common.
Dose
frequencies
for patients with haemophilia A on prophylaxis
varies greatly within countries (Figure S2). There
was no apparent relationship between dose fre-
quencies and age groups, except in Germany where
most patients who dosed daily were ≥40 years of
age (Table S5).

 on prophylaxis experiencing ≥1 bleed during the study
period ranged from 59% (Sweden) to 100% (Spain)
(Table 3) and the median ABR varied from 1.0 (Bel-
gium, Italy and Sweden) to 4.0 (France and UK). Of
note is the higher ABRs, from 2.0 to 8.0, for patients
with

on
prophylaxis,
although the low patient number should be considered
when interpreting these data. Overall, most common
were joint bleeds experienced by 43% (Sweden) to
77% (France) of the patients with haemophilia A. In
addition, 25% of the patients had substantially higher
ABRs, ranging from 2 to 12 (severe haemophilia A)
between countries as indicated by the interquartile
ranges. There were no apparent trends in the total
number of bleeds (all types of bleeds) vs. patient age
for haemophilia A (Figure S3), however, there was a
slight tendency of lower number of joint bleeds among
children in some countries (Fig. 4).
The ABRs for patients receiving on-demand treat-
ment were in general higher for patients with severe
than moderate haemophilia (Table S6).
Discussion
This large retrospective study on haemophilia treat-
ment including 1346 haemophilia A and 312 haemo-
philia B patients from 12 haemophilia centres in six
EU countries and one national register (UK), compiled
data on the treatment and treatment outcome during
12 months and showed that treatment practice varies
greatly throughout Europe and that many patients still
bleed despite living in a relatively affluent part of the
world. This is in line with recent data from the US,
showing unacceptably high bleeding rates in a large
proportion of severe haemophilia [12].
The use of plasma-derived products for both haemo-
philia A and B varied greatly between countries and
age groups, and was more common among older
patients. The proportional use of plasma-derived FIX
was higher than that of plasma-derived FVIII, possibly
due to the higher recovery of plasma-derived FIX
in vivo than that obtained with recombinant FIX
products. Moreover, only one recombinant FIX pro-
duct was available on the market until recently, and
the cost of plasma-derived FIX has generally been
lower than that of recombinant FIX.
The mean prescribed treatment for patients receiv-
ing regular prophylaxis for severe haemophilia A ran-
ged from 90 to 110 IU kg�1 per week in most
countries; it is interesting to note that Sweden, known
for its high-dose prophylaxis regimen [13], was in the
same range or even lower than other countries in the
study. For moderate haemophilia A, the mean pre-
scribed treatment was lower than for severe haemo-
philia A, ranging from 75 to 95 IU kg�1 per week,
presumably reflecting the higher basal FVIII level in
moderate patients. The large standard deviations and
dose ranges for both severe and moderate patients
reflect a wide variety of individual patient consump-
tion. In both severe and moderate haemophilia B, the
range of therapy was even greater, and the average
annual use considerably less, compared to haemophi-
lia A, possibly reflecting the former being perceived as
a milder bleeding disorder and FIX products having a
longer half-life than FVIII products [14].
The median ABR for patients with severe haemophi-
lia A on prophylaxis was as high as four in some coun-
tries and some patients experienced more than 12
bleeds per year, likely reflecting insufficient therapy,
inappropriate dose-interval, presence of target joints,
poor adherence or difficulty of correctly assessing
bleeds by some patients. The most common FVIII pro-
phylactic regimen was three times weekly, which is
probably suboptimal in some cases due to a relatively

 short half-life of conventional FVIII products [15]. The
true level of joint bleeds is currently difficult to ascer-
tain since patients report symptomatic bleeds and there
is also evidence that asymptomatic joint bleeds may
lead to both over- and under-reporting. In general, the
more joint bleeds a patient experiences the greater the
risk is of developing structural joint damage, however
it has also become apparent that even patients without
a history of perceived bleeds may have MRI detectable
abnormalities [6,16]. Although zero bleeds may be dif-
ficult to achieve for those who already have target
joints, appropriate prophylaxis, optimized by dose and
dose-interval for each individual, should provide full
protection against bleeds.
Although it was heartening to note that many chil-
dren with severe haemophilia received prophylaxis,
which increases their likelihood of entering adulthood
with minimal joint damage, children on prophylaxis
experienced occasional bleeds to an extent close to that
of older patients in some countries. Bleeds in small chil-
dren indicate that prophylaxis is driven to the minimal
acceptable level, or even lower. This not only increases
the risk of joint injury but probably also prevents
patients from being fully physically active [2].
In individuals with moderate haemophilia A on pro-
phylaxis improvement is needed since bleeds were as
frequent or more frequent than for those with severe
disease on prophylaxis. Patients with haemophilia B
on prophylaxis experienced bleeds with a frequency
similar to those with haemophilia A confirming a need
for improved treatment also for these patients. Finally,
the ABRs for patients treated on-demand were higher
than for those receiving prophylaxis and a substantial
number of these patients had relatively high ABRs as
revealed
by
the
interquartile
ranges.

Bleeding locations were reported as: joint, muscle/soft tissue, mouth, other or unknown bleed location, of which only all locations and joints are pre-
sented here. The number of bleeds can be more than one per patient.
*The bleed population consisted of those patients in the full analysis population for whom reliable bleeding data were available for the complete 12-
month study period. For registers, all bleed data were included.
†For UK, the ABR is calculated based on patients self-reported bleedings in the Haemtrack database, while for other countries, data are retrieved from

 with frequent bleeds to avoid pain and deterioration
of joint function [2].
A limitation of this study was that the local varia-
tion in patient care at the haemophilia centres may
not truly reflect the country as a whole, apart from
the UK (national register). Another limitation was the
differing arrangements for recording patient informa-
tion. The study attempted to obtain data on the
amount of factor that was issued and/or used by each
patient as well as the prescribed dose for all patients
on prophylaxis. Unfortunately, only partial data were
retrievable for both issued and used doses, while data
on prescribed dose were complete for all countries,
except for UK where prescribed dose was not part of
the available dataset. Prescribed dose in some coun-
tries included treatment for bleeds, while in others, it
was not included. For the purposes of this study,
issued and prescribed dose were assumed to offer
equivalent insight into therapeutic practice, although
possibly the issued dose reflects usage more accurately
due to a degree of patient non-adherence. Finally,
another limitation was the low number of patients
with haemophilia B reflecting its low incidence, pre-
venting subgroup analysis such that the results might
be generalizable to the whole patient population.
This study was an ambitious project to assess the
efficacy of haemophilia care in real life. Future studies
may be easier to undertake if a more uniform set of
data can be collected, e.g. using smart phone technol-
ogy, and the establishment of national registers as sup-
ported by the World Federation of Haemophilia and
the European Medicines Agency. This will allow
increased monitoring of haemostasis and product use,
which will benefit patients and be of value to funders.
Many patients on prophylactic and on-demand treat-
ment still experience an appreciable number of bleeds,
which should strongly encourage the use of more effi-
cient treatment. Higher FVIII/FIX trough levels and

Figure S1. Treatment regimen for patients
with haemophilia A by age group, by severity
and by centre. The proportion in each treat-
ment regimen was based on information from
patients prescriptions, except for UK (striped
columns) where it was estimated based on the
patients self-reported treatments.
