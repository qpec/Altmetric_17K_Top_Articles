IMPORTANCE An international task force recently redefined the concept of sepsis. This task
force recommended the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score
instead of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to identify patients at
high risk of mortality. However, these new criteria have not been prospectively validated in
some settings, and their added value in the emergency department remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To prospectively validate qSOFA as a mortality predictor and compare the
performances of the new sepsis criteria to the previous ones.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS International prospective cohort study, conducted in
France, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland between May and June 2016. In the 30 participating
emergency departments, for a 4-week period, consecutive patients who visited the
emergency departments with suspected infection were included. All variables from previous
and new definitions of sepsis were collected. Patients were followed up until hospital
discharge or death.
EXPOSURES Measurement of qSOFA, SOFA, and SIRS.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality.
RESULTS Of 1088 patients screened, 879 were included in the analysis. Median age was 67
years (interquartile range, 47-81 years), 414 (47%) were women, and 379 (43%) had
respiratory tract infection. Overall in-hospital mortality was 8%: 3% for patients with a qSOFA
score lower than 2 vs 24% for those with qSOFA score of 2 or higher (absolute difference,
21%; 95% CI, 15%-26%). The qSOFA performed better than both SIRS and severe sepsis in
predicting in-hospital mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of
0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85) vs 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.70) for both SIRS and severe sepsis
(P < .001; incremental AUROC, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22). The hazard ratio of qSOFA score for
death was 6.2 (95% CI, 3.8-10.3) vs 3.5 (95% CI, 2.2-5.5) for severe sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients presenting to the emergency department
with suspected infection, the use of qSOFA resulted in greater prognostic accuracy for
in-hospital mortality than did either SIRS or severe sepsis. These findings provide support for
the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria in
the emergency department setting.

S
epsis is a highly prevalent condition that accounts for
10% of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) and
is associated with a 10% to 20% in-hospital mortality
rate.1-5 In 2016, an international task force of experts rede-
fined this syndrome in the Third International Consensus
Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).6 Due to
poor specificity and sensitivity, the systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) and the previous definitions of
sepsis and severe sepsis were replaced with the new state of
sepsis defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is now
identified by an increase of at least 2 points in the Sequential
[Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in
patients with a suspicion of infection. The quick SOFA
(qSOFA) score, a surrogate for SOFA in settings in which all
components of SOFA are not routinely measured, was intro-
duced to screen for patients likely to have sepsis.
The task force derived and validated its criteria on sev-
eral large patient databases, both inside and outside the ICU.
They reported that qSOFA (range, 0-3; 1 point for each of the
following: respiratory rate >21 breaths/min; systolic arterial
blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg; or altered mental status) was a
better predictor for in-hospital mortality than were SIRS or
SOFA in non-ICU encounters and should be used for risk strati-
fication and consideration for sepsis in emergency depart-
ment (ED) patients with infection. However, it has not been
prospectively validated or even studied specifically in the ED.
For Sepsis-3 criteria to be globally endorsed, external valida-
tion is essential.
The purpose of this study was to assess the external
validity of the recently developed Sepsis-3 criteria among
patients presenting to the ED and to compare these criteria to
prior guidelines that utilize the SIRS score and serum lactate
levels.
Method
Design and Setting
This was an international multicenter prospective cohort
study that recruited from 30 centers: 27 in France, 1 in
Switzerland,1inSpain,and1inBelgium.Amongthose,24were
academic centers and 6, nonacademic centers. For a 4-week
period from May to June 2016, consecutive patients who had
visited1oftherecruitingEDswithasuspicionofinfectionwere
screened and followed up until death or hospital discharge af-
ter oral (or written in Belgium and Switzerland) consent was
obtained. Because the study was observational, our institu-
tional review board (IRB) (Comité de protection des per-
sonnes, Ile de France VI, Paris, France) approved the study in
France, as did local IRBs in Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland.
The STARD recommendations were followed for the report-
ing of diagnostic studies.7
Selection of Participants, Data Collection and End Points
We included all consecutive adult patients who presented
to the ED with a clinical suspicion of infection diagnosed by
the treating emergency physicians, based on the identifica-
tion of an infectious source (whether clinical, radiological, or
microbiological) or an equivocal presentation (for example, a
febrile patient with inflammatory syndrome). After the re-
cruitmentandfollow-upperiodwasover,2expertsineachcen-
ter reviewed all files from each patient’
s hospital stay and ad-
judicated whether the acute presentation to the ED was related
to an infection. Evidence of infection was sought through the
analysis of radiological studies, microbiological findings, or
clinical context. In cases of disagreement, consensus was
sought between the 2 experts. Patients in whom infection
was not confirmed were then excluded from analysis.
We also excluded patients who refused to participate,
pregnant women, prisoners or patients in custody, and low-
acuity patients defined by a localized infection without gen-
eral symptoms and normal vital parameters (temperature,
heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure), for which
laboratory examinations were not deemed necessary by the
emergency physicians (for example tonsillitis, skin abscess,
or cystitis).
For each recruited patient, the emergency physician col-
lected the 3 components of the qSOFA in the ED at their
worst level during the ED stay (namely highest respiratory
rate, lowest systolic blood pressure, and lowest Glasgow
Coma Scale [GCS] score). Because the definition of altered
consciousness is not equivalent to a GCS score less than 15,
the presence of an altered mental status was recorded inde-
pendently of GCS. The presence of altered mental status
was determined clinically by the treating physician. We also
recorded data to assess the severity of sepsis using the pre-
vious definitions of sepsis (ie, blood lactate and compo-
nents of the SIRS) and components of the SOFA score when
available. Other variables collected by the experts after
chart review included the site of infection, means of confir-
mation (clinical, radiological, or microbiological), and vaso-
pressor administration.
The primary end point was in-hospital mortality.
Because this end point could be equivocal for some patients
(for example patients transferred to another facility), this
end point was adjudicated by 2 experts blinded to each
other after reviewing all available medical records. In cases
Key Points
Question Does the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(qSOFA) score more accurately predict in-hospital mortality than
the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or severe
sepsis criteria among emergency department patients with
suspected infection?
Findings In this multicenter prospective cohort study involving
879 patients with suspected infection treated at the emergency
department, the qSOFA was better at predicting in-hospital
mortality with an area under the receiver operating curve
(AUROC) of 0.80 than were SIRS (AUROC, 0.65) and severe
sepsis (AUROC, 0.65).
Meaning Among patients presenting to the emergency
department setting with suspected infection, the use of qSOFA
resulted in greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality
than either SIRS or severe sepsis.

of disagreement, consensus was sought between the 2
experts. For patients who were still hospitalized after 28
days and outside of ICU, we considered that they did not
meet the end point of in-hospital mortality. Secondary end
points included admission to ICU, length of ICU stay of more
than 72 hours, and a composite of death or ICU stay of more
than 72 hours.
Statistical Analysis
All Gaussian distributed variables are expressed as mean (SD),
and nonnormally distributed variables as median (interquar-
tile range [IQR]). Categorical variables are expressed as num-
ber and percentage. We handled missing values for the SOFA
score by assuming that they were within the normal range for
each value.
To assess the performances of the qSOFA to predict the
primary end point, we calculated diagnostic performances
(sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive
values) for a qSOFA score of 2 or higher. We constructed a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated
the corresponding area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Per-
formances of qSOFA and SOFA to predict the primary and
secondary end points were compared with those of SIRS
and the previous definition of severe sepsis, namely at least
2 elements of SIRS and a blood lactate level of more than 2
mmol/L (18 mg/dL). The respective hazard ratios (HRs) for
in-hospital death of qSOFA and SIRS, which were dichoto-
mized to less than 2 and 2 or more, were estimated with a
Cox proportional hazards model after adjustment for mea-
sured confounders. The model fit was assessed by the calcu-
lation of the concordance probability, which is defined as
the probability that predictions and outcomes are concor-
dant. We used the Harrell C coefficient, which is defined as
the proportion of all usable subject pairs in which the pre-
dictions and outcomes are concordant.
In line with Seymour et al,8 the added value of hyperlac-
tatemia to qSOFA (qSOFA + 1 if lactate >2 mmol/L ) was also
tested and compared with the qSOFA score alone. To assess
whether the inclusion criteria and primary end point were
valid, interrater agreement between the 2 blinded experts who
adjudicated these 2 variables was achieved using the Cohen κ
statistic.
To validate the results of the Sepsis-3 consensus article,
the aim was to confirm the hypothesis that patients with a
qSOFA score of 2 or higher have an in-hospital mortality rate
of at least 10%.6 This percentage corresponds to the reported
overall mortality rate of infected patients with a SOFA score
of 2. For this reason, a difference in mortality rate of 10% was
considered clinically significant in the Sepsis-3 consensus
statement.6,8 With an estimated overall mortality of 3%,8 an
assumption that 80% of included patients would have a qSOFA
score of less than 2, and power set at 90%, a target recruit-
ment number of 840 patients was calculated.
Allstatisticalanalyseswere2-tailed,andaPvaluelessthan
.05 was required for statistical significance. All analyses were
performed with NCSS 10.0 (Statistical Solution).
Results
A total of 1088 patients were included from 30 EDs during
the recruitment period. Following adjudication, 60 patients
(6%) were excluded because they did not have infection,
and 149 patients were excluded because of missing values
required to calculate qSOFA score, leaving 879 included for
the final analysis (Figure 1). A component of the SOFA was
missing in 260 patients. The identified infection source was
clinical in 79% of patients, radiological in 50%, and micro-
biological in 37%.
The median age was 67 years (IQR, 48-81 years). The
most common site of infection was respiratory (43% cases).
Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
qSOFA score was 2 or higher for 218 patients (25%), SOFA
was 2 or higher for 297 patients (34%), SIRS was 2 or higher
for 653 patients (74%), and 176 patients (20%) fulfilled the
previous criteria of severe sepsis (≥2 elements of SIRS and a

blood lactate concentration of >2 mmol/L ). Interrater agree-
ment for the diagnosis of infection had a Cohen κ of 0.87
(95% CI, 0.81-0.93).
Overall, in-hospital mortality was 8%. For patients with
qSOFA scores less than 2, the mortality rate was 3% (95% CI,
2%-5%) vs 24% (95% CI, 18%-30%) for patients with a
qSOFA score of 2 or higher (absolute difference, 21%; 95%
CI, 15%-26%). Secondary end points are reported in Table 2.
Interrater agreement for the primary end point had a Cohen
κ of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96-1.0). Cumulative incidence of death
according to qSOFA is reported in eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment. An AUROC curve for the prediction of in-hospital
death was constructed with new and former definitions of
sepsis, namely qSOFA, SOFA, SIRS, and severe sepsis
(Figure 2). The highest AUROCs were for the qSOFA score
(0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85) and the SOFA score (0.77; 95% CI,
0.71-0.82) compared with 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.70) for SIRS
and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.70) for severe sepsis (P < .001,
compared with qSOFA). The incremental AUROC for qSOFA
compared with SIRS or severe sepsis was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.09-
0.22). We found similar results for the prediction of ICU
admission, ICU admission of more than 72 hours, and a
composite of death or ICU admission of more than 72 hours
(eFigures 2, 3, and 4 in the Supplement).
Prognostic performances of these criteria are reported in
Table 3. For the prediction of in-hospital mortality, qSOFA had
a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI, 59%-80%) and specificity of 79%
(76%-82%); SOFA had a sensitivity of 73% (95% CI, 61%-83%)
and a specificity of 70% (95% CI, 67%-73%). The positive like-
lihood ratio was 3.40 (95% CI, 2.80-4.17) for qSOFA and 2.40
(95% CI, 2.00-2.90) for SOFA. Both assessments had a nega-
tive predictive value of 97% (95% CI, 95%-98%).
After adjustment for age and site of infection (respiratory
vs others) and using a Cox model, we found that a qSOFA of 2
or higher was associated with in-hospital mortality with an
HR of 6.2 (95% CI, 3.8-10.3; Harrell C, 0.83). With the previ-
ous definition of severe sepsis, the HR was 3.5 (95% CI, 2.2-
5.5). Other adjusted models for the prediction of in-hospital
mortality confirmed the good results of Sepsis-3 criteria
(eTable in the Supplement).
The AUROC of blood lactate was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63-0.77).
We found no value in adding lactate to qSOFA for the predic-
tion of in-hospital mortality, with a similar AUROC for both:
0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.85) for qSOFA and lactate and 0.80 (95%
CI, 0.74-0.85) for qSOFA alone.
In addition, only 30 patients fulfilled the septic shock cri-
teria (presence of hypotension that requires vasoactive drug
administration), with a mortality of 40% vs 7% for others
(absolute difference, 32%; 95% CI, 15%-50%).
Discussion
This international cohort study recruited 879 emergency
patients with infection in 4 European countries to prospec-
tively validate the new Sepsis-3 criteria, especially the qSOFA
score. The latter aimed at identifying patients with sepsis,
which is a life-threatening situation. This index was derived
from large retrospective databases and requires prospective
validation.9 The Sepsis-3 task force estimated that patients
with sepsis would have an in-hospital mortality rate greater
than 10%. In the present study, patients with a qSOFA score
of 2 or higher had an in-hospital mortality rate of 24% com-
pared with 3% for patients with a qSOFA score of less than 2.
This international study prospectively assessed qSOFA
and validated the findings from the derivation cohort. Com-
pared with previous criteria (SIRS and severe sepsis), qSOFA
had better discriminative value and hazard ratio for predict-
ing death, ICU admission, and ICU stay longer than 72 hours.
The strong prognostic accuracy of qSOFA for mortality was
confirmed with an AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85), which
was greater than that of SIRS and severe sepsis (AUROC, 0.65;
95% CI, 0.59-0.70 for both). This is in line with the Sepsis 3
task force study that reported an AUROC of 0.81 for qSOFA
for non-ICU encounters.8 Recently, 2 retrospective studies
also confirmed the good prognostic ability of qSOFA to pre-
dict mortality and ICU admission.10,11
Following the publication of Sepsis-3, a prospective
validation study focused on ED patients was required to
support the new recommendations and assist in changing

the paradigm. In the cohort with a SIRS score of 2 or more
reported herein, the mortality was 11%, and the high sensi-
tivity (93%; 95% CI, 85%-98%) was associated with a poor
specificity (27%; 95% CI, 24%-31%). Nearly 75% of pa-
tients had at least 2 points of SIRS, but far fewer had life-
threatening organ dysfunction. Similarly, previous studies
reported that 68% to 93% of patients admitted in the ICU
had at least 2 elements of SIRS.12-14 This indicates that hav-
ing 2 or more elements of SIRS does not discriminate well
enough for organ dysfunction. The very low mortality rate of
patients with qSOFA score less than 2 is a strong argument to
replace SIRS without the risk of missing critically ill patients.
Moreover, there was no difference in the rate of the false-
negative of SIRS and qSOFA for the prediction of death or
ICU stay of more than 72 hours (7%; 95% CI, 4%-10% and
9%; 95% CI, 7%-11%). Although qSOFA was not meant to
replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis but rather help clini-
cians for early detection of sepsis,15 these results suggest
that ED patients with infection and a qSOFA score of 2 or
more should be considered for sepsis even in the absence of
a SOFA score or more 2. More than 70% of patients with a
qSOFA of 2 or more had a SOFA score of at least 2 points as
previously reported.8
Although blood lactate was known to be associated with
severeoutcomeinpatientswithsepsis,16-19therewasnoadded
value of hyperlactatemia to qSOFA in this study. This con-
firms the findings of the Sepsis-3 task force, which suggested
qSOFA performs effectively and there is no added value when
stratified by blood lactate level. This along with other find-
ings could result in a complete change of the current clinical
approach because the severity of sepsis up until now has been
assessed in ED patients using lactate levels.20,21

In addition to its improved performance, qSOFA may be
practical for use in the ED. The endorsement of the Sepsis-3
criteria would allow not only a more accurate recognition of
criticallyillpatientsbutalsoanearlierdetectionbecauseqSOFA
can be assessed immediately upon arrival and does not re-
quire any supplemental investigation such as leukocytosis or
blood lactate.
The work presented by the Sepsis-3 task force included 2
major shortcomings that might have contributed to the reluc-
tance of physicians to adopt them: they were not prospec-
tively validated, and they did not involve emergency patient
cohorts or emergency physicians. This was particularly criti-
cized because two-thirds of patients with sepsis come through
the ED. One of the strengths of this study is that it prospec-
tively validates the task forces findings and highlights how
thesefindingsparticularlyapplytoEDpatientswithevenstron-
ger results.
Our study has some limitations. First, we did not follow
up discharged patients and only focused on in-hospital mor-
tality, which was because we used the Sepsis-3 primary end
point of in-hospital mortality. It is possible that a discharged
patient could have been readmitted or could have died in the
first 28 days. Second, the worst value of qSOFA criteria dur-
ing the ED stay of the patient was recorded. This could have
biased the results to a higher qSOFA score. Because the
qSOFA can vary in a short time frame, these results could not
be extrapolated to the detection of sepsis at the time of the
arrival, for instance to be used as a nurse triage tool. A spe-
cific study on the value at ED entry should be performed to
answer this question. Third, there was a substantial part of
missing data regarding laboratory results, so the calculation
of SOFA may not be accurate. It is possible that with more
complete data, the SOFA score may actually perform better
than qSOFA. However, qSOFA seems much more appropriate
in the ED as an early detection tool. Similarly, one-third of
patients with at least 2 SIRS criteria did not have blood lactate
measurement, resulting in a possible misclassification in the
severe sepsis category. Fourth, we did not exclude patients
with “do not attempt resuscitation” status or with set limita-
tions of care, and this could have skewed the mortality rate.
Fifth, although the study was adequately powered, only 74
patients met the primary end point, which may be consid-
ered relatively low. Sixth, experts could not have been
blinded to the value of the components of the scores, and
this could have influenced their adjudication as to whether
the ED presentation was related to an infection. This could be
a source of incorporation bias.
Conclusions
Among patients presenting to the ED with suspected infec-
tion, the use of qSOFA resulted in greater prognostic accu-
racyforin-hospitalmortalitythandideitherSIRSorseveresep-
sis. These findings provide support for the Sepsis-3 criteria in
the ED setting.
