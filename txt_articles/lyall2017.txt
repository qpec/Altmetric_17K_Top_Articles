IMPORTANCE Higher body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease;
however, the underlying causal associations remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES To use UK Biobank data to report causal estimates of the association between
BMI and cardiometabolic disease outcomes and traits, such as pulse rate, using mendelian
randomization.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional baseline data from a population-based
cohort study including 119 859 UK Biobank participants with complete phenotypic (medical
and sociodemographic) and genetic data. Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers
across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from
May 1 to July 11, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and
type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was
measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to
relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and
the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian
randomization approach.
RESULTS Of the 119 859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4%) were men; mean
(SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years. Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant
positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension
(odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 × 10−19), coronary heart
disease (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95% CI,
2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 × 10−17), as well as systolic blood pressure (β = 1.65 mm Hg; 95% CI,
0.78-2.52 mm Hg; P = 2.0 × 10−04) and diastolic blood pressure (β = 1.37 mm Hg; 95% CI,
0.88-1.85 mm Hg; P = 3.6 × 10−08). These associations were independent of age, sex,
Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an
association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This finding
has relevance for public health policies in many countries with increasing obesity levels.

 O
besity is a major public health concern in terms of eco-
nomic costs and effect on quality of life and health.1
A total of 40% of adults worldwide are overweight,
with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and
13% are obese (BMI 30).2 Higher BMI is a risk factor for out-
comes associated with lower quality of life and functional im-
pairment, including cardiometabolic diseases such as
hypertension,3 coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes,4
stroke,5 and cognitive impairment.6 Although lifestyle fac-
tors are considerable drivers of excess adiposity, BMI has a sig-
nificant genetic component: approximately 34% of BMI varia-
tion can be attributed to common genetic loci.7
Correlations between higher BMI and cardiometabolic dis-
ease risk usually arise from observational studies that are un-
able to fully account for confounding by shared risk factors,
such as socioeconomic deprivation, or reverse causality
whereby the presence of disease may influence BMI.8 Men-
delian randomization (MR) is an approach that partially over-
comes these limitations. In instances where genetic risk fac-
tors for a trait (eg, BMI) have been reported, these can be used
to proxy lifetime variation of the trait and facilitate analysis
of whether the trait plays a causal role in disease risk through
instrumental variable analysis.9
Studies by Nordestgaard et al10 (N = 75 627), Holmes et al11
(N = 34 548), and Hägg et al12 (N = 22 193) compared observa-
tionalwithcausalestimatesoftheassociationofBMIwithCHD,
stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The investigators reported dis-
crepant results first in terms of observational vs causal esti-
mate odds ratios (ORs) and showed inconsistency in terms of
finding significant associations with CHD and stroke.
The conflicting evidence as to whether a true association
exists between BMI and cardiometabolic diseases and, if so,
the magnitude of that association lends support to adopting
an MR approach to investigating whether BMI has a causal re-
lationship with a range of important phenotypes related to
health in a large biobank.10,11 The present study used UK Bio-
bank (n = 119 859 with usable data). Our report advances the
field in 3 important ways: (1) by including a relatively large
sample size in a single study with detailed measurement of co-
variates (eg, smoking history); (2) by using a 93 single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) polygenic risk (PGR) score
based on a genome-wide association study of 339 224 indi-
viduals, with 56 recent discoveries13; and (3) by conducting MR
of BMI on a range of outcomes, including CHD, type 2 diabe-
tes,hypertension,andstrokeaswellasbloodpressure(BP)and
pulse rate, the latter two being easily and commonly as-
sessed noninvasive variables that are prognostic for cardio-
vascular outcomes.14
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The UK Biobank cohort is a large prospective cohort of 502 628
participantswithphenotypicinformation.Inthepresentanaly-
sis, we report on cross-sectional data at baseline. All partici-
pants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers from 2006 to 2010
where they completed a series of physical, sociodemo-
graphic, and medical assessments.15,16 In total, 152 729 par-
ticipants currently have genetic data. This study was con-
ductedfromMay1toJuly11,2016,undergenericapprovalfrom
the UK National Health Service National Research Ethics Ser-
vice. Participants provided written informed consent.
Exclusions
Of 152 729 UK Biobank participants who were genotyped, we
first excluded nonwhite European participants (based on self-
report), leaving 137 178 individuals. We then removed partici-
pants who had a relatedness coefficient above 0.0442 (eg, first
cousins),mismatchbetweenreportedandgeneticsex,orfailed
UK Biobank quality controlling and were recommended ex-
clusions (by UK Biobank), resulting in a final sample of 119 859
individuals.
Physical Traits
Participants were asked during the baseline assessment about
any previous or current cardiometabolic conditions that had
been diagnosed by their physician. Specifically, participants
were asked whether their physician had diagnosed myocar-
dial infarction, angina, hypertension, or stroke. We defined
CHD as either myocardial infarction or angina (the results were
similar when we analyzed myocardial infarction individu-
ally). We excluded participants who stated only “prefer not to
answer” (170 [0.14%] of the total to this multiple-choice ques-
tion). Participants were separately asked whether their phy-
sician had diagnosed diabetes. A minority may have had type
1 rather than type 2 diabetes. We removed participants with
missing data for this question (259 [0.22%]). Because UK Bio-
bank is nationally representative of the United Kingdom, we
would expect most strokes to be ischemic.17
Height was measured (seca 202 stadiometer; seca) and
weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg (BC-418 MA body
composition analyzer; Tanita Corp). Body mass index was de-
rived from weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Participants self-reported their sex and age; stated
their smoking status as never, previous, or current; and re-
ported their alcohol intake as never, special occasions only,
1 to 3 times a month, once or twice a week, 3 or 4 times a week,
and daily or almost daily. Alcohol intake and smoking status
Key Points
Question Based on estimates derived using mendelian
randomization, what is the association between body mass index
and cardiometabolic traits?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of approximately
120 000 individuals, associations were identified between body
mass index and risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, type
2 diabetes, and elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures. No
associations between body mass index and stroke or pulse rate
were observed.
Meaning Body mass index represents an important modifiable
factor for ameliorating the risk of cardiometabolic disease in the
general population.

 were treated as ordinal variables after removing participants
who preferred not to answer and for whom their alcohol/
smoking status was therefore ambiguous; the low missing
numbers of 77 (0.1%) for alcohol and 320 (0.3%) for smoking
are unlikely to bias the results meaningfully. Blood pressure
andpulseratewereassessedusingdigitalbloodpressuremoni-
tors (HEM-7015IT; Omron Healthcare Inc). We used the first
reading because it had the largest sample size. There was a sig-
nificant reduction in systolic BP from the first to second mea-
surement (mean [SD], 139.9 [19.69] and 136.0 [18.65] mm Hg;
P < .001; Cohen d = 0.20, which represents a small effect size),
but not for diastolic BP (82.2 [10.7] and 82.2 [10.2] mm Hg;
P = .81; Cohen d = <0.01). Both diastolic and systolic BPs first
and second readings correlated at r = 0.9 (P < .001). The re-
sults were unchanged when we ran analyses on the subset of
individuals with available measurements from second read-
ings only or a mean of first and second readings. Participants
self-reported estimated physical activity, which was sum-
mated to create an overall physical activity score.18
Participants were asked whether they were receiving any
antihypertensive medication during an on-screen assess-
ment with response options of yes, no, or don’
t know. Those
who did not know were removed from analysis (242 [0.20%]),
and we adjusted for yes/no status of self-reported antihyper-
tensive medication use in all BP and pulse rate analyses as an
additional covariate. Participants self-reported their ethnic-
ity and we recoded this as a white European vs other ethnic-
ity variable. A Townsend deprivation score (minimum, −6.26;
maximum, 10.78; mean [SD], −1.47 [3.00]) for all participants
was derived.19 Higher Townsend scores equate to higher lev-
els of area-based socioeconomic deprivation.
Genetic Data
UK Biobank genotyping was conducted by Affymetrix using a
bespoke BiLEVE Axiom array for 49 979 participants and on a
further updated bespoke Affymetrix Axiom array for the re-
maining 102 750 individuals in this study, based on the first
array. The 2 arrays are very similar, sharing more than 95%
markercontent.Wecontrolledforarraytypeasacovariate.Fur-
ther information on the genotyping process is available on the
UK Biobank website (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/scientists
-3/genetic-data), which includes detailed technical
documentation.20 There were 33 genetic batches: 11 BiLEVE
and 22 UK Biobank. Approximately 4000 to 5000 participants
were in each batch, and they are described in the above-
referenced documentation.20(p20) We followed UK Biobank
recommendations on which participants to exclude from
analysisbasedonwhetherthesamplefailedqualitycontroland
had significant missing data or heterozygosity. We used 10 UK
Biobank–providedgeneticprincipalcomponentstoaccountfor
population stratification.
Results were similar when we ran analyses unadjusted for
these10principalcomponents.AllSNPshadamissingnessrate
lower than 1%, except for rs10733682 (8%), although the re-
sults were unchanged with or without inclusion of this SNP.
We therefore report results with this SNP included.
The PGR score was derived from 97 SNPs associated with
BMI at genome-wide significance in a previous study of more
than 339 224 participants of European descent13 (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). Of these, 95 SNPs were directly genotyped
in UK Biobank. Two SNPs failed in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium20 (rs9925964 and rs17001654; P < 1 × 10−6) as
assessed with PLINK, and were excluded, leaving 93 SNPs for
the BMI genetic instrument.21 We constructed an externally
weighted PGR score for each participant, weighted by the ef-
fect estimates reported in GIANT (β per 1-SD unit of BMI).13
Statistical Analysis
For all analyses, in the partially adjusted model we adjusted
forassessmentcenter,age,sex,geneticbatcheffects,array,and
stratification with the 10 genetic principal components. In the
fully adjusted model, Townsend deprivation scores, smoking
status, and alcohol intake were added as covariates. All sta-
tistical tests were 2-sided and P < .01 denoted nominal signifi-
cance. A conservative P value was chosen as we had multiple
outcomes; formal correction for type I error can be overly con-
servative when testing intercorrelated outcomes.22 Stata, ver-
sion 13,23 was used for all analyses.
Observational Analysis
For the observational analyses of BMI association with vari-
ous binary disease traits, we report logistic regression ORs and
95% CIs. Continuous traits are reported as unstandardized
β values with linear regression.
MR Analysis
Weused2MRapproaches.First,weranconventionalMRusing
individual-level data to conduct 2-stage least squares analy-
sis for continuous trait data (using Stata command ivreg224,25)
and control function estimator for binary traits.26 We used ro-
bust SE variances throughout and MR-Egger for the second MR
method. MR-Egger is a linear regression of estimated SNP ef-
fects for the risk allele on exposure against the corresponding
estimates of SNPs on outcome weighted by the inverse vari-
ance of the SNP on outcome effect estimates. The regression
line in MR-Egger is not forced through the origin, and the pres-
ence of unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy (ie, where the SNPs
are associated with alternative pathways to the exposure that
haveindependenteffectsontheoutcome)canbeinferredfrom
an intercept that differs from zero.27 While the inclusion of
pleiotropicSNPscanbiascausalestimatesandincreasetherate
of false positives (ie, type I errors) or introduce bias to the null,
MR-Egger can bypass this by showing evidence of pleiotropy
in the instrument (the PGR score) and providing a causal es-
timate(makingcertainassumptions)thatisrobusttosuchplei-
otropy. For MR-Egger, we used the same covariate models as
the previous analyses. We conducted checks to support the va-
lidity of the MR analysis using multiple genetic variants (ie, the
93-SNP PGR score) as follows. Possible pleiotropy for each of
the 93 SNPs can be assessed visually by a scatterplot, where
each point should be roughly visually compatible with a lin-
ear effect of genetic associations with the outcome vs genetic
associations with the risk factor.27 This linearity ideally re-
flects homogeneity of causal estimates from different genetic
variants; the eFigure in the Supplement shows a scatterplot
of these variants for each outcome (eg, CHD) vs genetic asso-

Results
Descriptives
Of the 119 859 participants who satisfied the inclusion crite-
ria (eg, passed quality control as described in the Genetic Data
section), the mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years, and 56 816
(47.4%) of the population were men. The mean (SD) BMI in this
119 859 subset of the UK Biobank was 27.53 (4.83), which was
similar to the BMI for the entire cohort (N = 449 472 with BMI
data mean = 27.43, SD = 4.80). Descriptive statistics are re-
ported in Table 1.
Observational Analysis BMI and Outcome Variables
In the fully adjusted models (Table 2), an SD increase in BMI
(4.83 kg/m2) was associated with the risk of stroke (OR, 1.26;
95% CI, 1.21-1.31; P = 2.0 × 10−29), CHD (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.40-
1.46; P = 2.0 × 10−184), hypertension (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.73-
1.78; P < 4.51 × 10−308), and type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.97; 95% CI,
1.93-2.02; P < 4.51 × 10−308). In addition, BMI was associated
with higher systolic BP (β = 3.02 mm Hg; 95% CI, 2.91-3.13 mm
Hg; P < 4.5 × 10−308), diastolic BP (β = 2.82 mm Hg; 95% CI,
2.76-2.89 mm Hg; P < 4.5 × 10−308), and pulse rate (β = 1.86
beats/min; 95% CI, 1.79-1.94 beats/min; P < 4.5 × 10−308).
MR Assumptions
The first MR assumption is that the polygenic score is associ-
ated with the exposure under investigation (BMI), and this is
supported by the data (Pearson r = 0.14, P < 4.51 × 10−308;
r2 = 2% variance in BMI explained; F statistic = 2175). The sec-
ond MR assumption is that SNPs associate with disease risk
only through the instrumented variable (BMI here), and the
third MR assumption is that the genetic variants do not show
association with traits that can confound the BMI to disease
relationships.
The second and third MR assumptions may be violated
when the SNPs employed in the genetic instrument show as-
sociations with variables (eg, smoking) which could influ-
ence the SNP to outcome association. Such so-called pleiot-
ropy can be either vertical (ie, reflecting an association of SNPs

 with traits on the same pathway from exposure through to out-
come, eg, in this case an association of BMI SNPs with sys-
tolic BP on the pathway to CHD), or horizontal (ie, on path-
ways that are distinct to the one from exposure through to
outcome).Directional(alsotermedunbalanced)horizontalplei-
otropy can lead to biased causal estimates from MR (see Fig-
ure 1 in White et al28 for a recent pictorial description of ver-
ticalandbalanced/unbalancedhorizontalpleiotropy).27eTable
2 in the Supplement shows correlations between the BMI
PGR score with smoking status (Pearson r = 0.02; P < .001),
Townsendscore(r = 0.01;P = .02),andalcoholintake(r = 0.03;
P < .001). It is unclear whether these results reflect vertical (ie,
downstream of BMI) or rather horizontal (ie, genetic associa-
tions with traits that are on separate pathways to BMI)
pleiotropy.29 If these associations with smoking, depriva-
tion, and alcohol were to lead to directional horizontal plei-
otropy, the intercept from MR-Egger would be expected to dif-
fer from zero; in such cases that we found evidence that the
intercept was different to zero, we interpreted the coefficient
from MR-Egger as being the more valid causal estimate. Con-
versely,intheabsenceofstatisticalevidenceforhorizontalplei-
otropy from the intercept on MR-Egger, we used the conven-
tional MR analysis as it retains greater power.
MR Analysis of BMI and Outcomes
Mendelian randomization analyses (Table 3) using individual
participant data showed generally similar effect sizes com-
pared with observational analyses for hypertension (OR, 1.64;
95% CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 × 10−19) and CHD (OR, 1.35; 95% CI,
1.09-1.69; P = .007). The association with type 2 diabetes in-
creased in magnitude from the association noted on observa-
tional analysis (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.93-2.02; to OR, 2.53; 95%
CI, 2.04-3.13). There was no association of BMI with stroke on
MRanalysis(P = .93).TheFigureshowsthecausalestimateORs
vstheobservationalestimatesfordiseaseoutcomes.UseofMR-
Egger analyses did not identify evidence of unbalanced hori-
zontal pleiotropy (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement). Asso-
ciations with systolic/diastolic BP remained significant, but
pulse rate did not. Results were similar in the partially vs fully
adjusted models.
Additional Analyses
As a check, we also repeated the analysis of type 2 diabetes,
CHD,andhypertensionresultsafterremovingparticipantswho
reported their age at diagnosis as unknown, chose not to an-
swer, or age at diagnosis 10 years or younger (cases removed:
238 for type 2 diabetes, 229 for CHD, and 3155 for hyperten-
sion); findings were unchanged. Including physical activity in
the final models made no difference to the final results.

 comes. The main advantage of an MR approach is that certain
types of study bias can be minimized. Because DNA is stable
and randomly inherited, which helps to mitigate errors from
reverse causality and confounding, genetic variation can be
used as a proxy for lifetime BMI to overcome limitations such
as reverse causality and confounding,9,10 a process that ham-
pers observational analyses of obesity and its consequences.
UsingMRintheUKBiobank,wefoundthathigherBMIwas
associated with a range of deleterious outcomes based on
causal MR estimates: increased risk of CHD (causal estimate
OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69; per-SD [4.8-unit] increase in BMI),
hypertension (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.48-1.83), and type 2 diabe-
tes(OR,2.53;95%CI,2.04-3.13),aswellasincreasedbloodpres-
sure (β = 1.65 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.78-2.52 mm Hg systolic; and
β = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.88-1.85 mm Hg diastolic). However, there
were no causal effects on pulse rate or stroke identified. As-
sociations were independent of Townsend deprivation scores,
alcohol intake, smoking status, age, sex, and antihyperten-
sive medication.
Three previous studies have provided causal estimates of
BMI and cardiometabolic diseases based on polygenic
instruments.10-12 Studies have reported their ORs and effect
sizes in different scales, eg, per 1- unit of BMI (Holmes et al11),
per 4-units of BMI (Nordestgaard et al10), and per 4.8 (this
study; equivalent to one standard deviation). In terms of CHD:
Nordestgaard et al10 reported an OR of 1.28 per 4 units of BMI
on risk of CHD (N = 75 627) and Holmes et al11 reported an OR
of 1.04 (in a meta-analysis of 219 423 participants) per 1-unit
of BMI (an OR of 1.17 when scaled to a 4-unit increase in BMI
as per Nordestgaard et al,10 or OR of 1.21 in our study where
1 SD equaled 4.8 units of BMI). Hägg et al12 reported no asso-
ciation for incident CHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; P = .62), per
4.5 units of BMI. We report an OR of 1.35 per SD of BMI on the
risk of CHD, similar to that of Nordestgaard et al.10 In terms of
type2diabetes:Holmesetal11reportedanassociationwithtype
2 diabetes (OR, 1.29 per unit of BMI or 2.77 extrapolated to
4 units of BMI as per Nordestgaard et al10), which is also simi-
lar to our results (OR, 2.53). The BMI and type 2 diabetes as-
sociation estimates were larger for the causal MR analyses (OR
in fully adjusted models, 2.53; 95% CI, 2.04-3.13), vs observa-
tional (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.93-2.02). This is often the case in MR
analyses since the genetic instrument represents a lifelong ex-
posuretoariskfactorandminimizesregressiondilutionbias.28
It is not clear why Hägg et al12 found a significant association
with stroke (HR, 1.83; P = .03) in their study, and we did not
in UK Biobank.
Studies by Fall et al30 (N = 198 502) and Timpson et al31
(N = 37 027, specifically investigating BP/hypertension)
showed similar results using a single SNP in the FTO locus as
an instrumental variable. In contrast to previous studies, we
used a 93-SNP PGR score and corrected for population strati-
fication with 10 principal components: these factors may
contribute to slight differences between studies, but, on the
whole, findings are generally concordant. Our PGR score
used many more SNPs (appropriate given that BMI is not
encoded for by any single variant in isolation) compared with
the 2 previous studies,30,31 meaning that our genetic instru-
ment explained a greater proportion of variance of BMI,
which increased the precision of and power to detect the
causal estimates that we report. Holmes et al11 summarized
4 large studies that conducted MR on BMI (N = 219 423),
where the instrument r2 range was 0.4% to 0.8%; our instru-
ment explained 1.79% of the variance. Taken together, our
data provide strong evidence for a causal role of higher BMI
and risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and evidence
that BMI increases risk of CHD.
Limitations
There are some limitations to the present report. There may
be a degree of selection bias in the sense that less physically
and cognitively impaired individuals responded to the UK Bio-
bank invitation and attended the assessment.31 The UK Bio-
bank cohort is representative of the UK population in terms
of some characteristics, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and depri-
vation, but not necessarily all (eg, some participants are less
likely to smoke and drink alcohol regularly).32 That said, the
disease rates were similar to those reported in the British Heart
Foundation 2015 report for hypertension (31% for men and
26% for women vs 27.5% in the present study), type 2 diabe-
tes (6.9% for men and 5.6% for women vs 5.3%),33 and in the
Health Survey for England 2014 report on data for CHD (5%
vs 4.8%) and stroke (2% vs 1.6%).34 We found a small but sig-
nificant correlation between the PGR score and higher rates
of smoking, alcohol intake, and Townsend deprivation scores
and thus made additional adjustments for these factors in our
analyses, which did not alter the estimates we obtained. As de-
scribed above, whether these associations represent vertical
orhorizontalpleiotropyremainsunknown.Thepresentsample
also lacks data on a complete repertoire of potential media-
tors, such as lipid traits and glucose levels; these data will be
available in the full UK Biobank in the next few years (along
with genetic data on the total sample of 502 628 individuals
in 2017). Because the MR-Egger analyses did not provide evi-
dence to suggest presence of unbalanced horizontal pleiot-
ropy, we have discussed the results in terms of conventional
MR analytical approaches. It should be noted, however, that
evidence for a causal BMI association with CHD and systolic/
diastolic BP would be significantly weakened based on the
MR-Egger estimates (to P > .05). Because MR-Egger is inher-
ently more conservative, potentially meaningful causal asso-
ciations might not be identified (type II error). Furthermore,
this approach may be inadequately powered to detect pleiot-
ropy when it is present.
Our analysis focused on prevalent disease. Although this
should not result in major bias, the UK Biobank data set
includes linkage to National Health Service records and hos-
pital admissions data. During 4.9 years of follow-up from
baseline, 3433 incident cardiovascular events occurred (in-
cluding CHD).35 This finding was based on the full baseline
data set of 502 649 participants, whereas genetic data are
available on only 119 859 individuals, resulting in approxi-
mately 1000 incident events in the current data set. We will
investigate genetically estimated BMI and cardiovascular
events (eg, myocardial infarction and onset of hypertension,
diabetes, and stroke) when genetic data are available on the
full data set in 2017.

 In terms of mechanisms, Holmes et al11 reported that a BMI
PGR score based on 14 SNPs was associated with known car-
diovascular risk factors, including glycemic traits, inflamma-
tion, and higher systolic and diastolic BPs. It seems a reason-
able hypothesis that BMI would increase the risk of diseases
through these established causal risk factors for CHD; the UK
Biobank serum biomarker data are not yet available; how-
ever, we will investigate the role of these potentially mediat-
ing variables in the future. In terms of public health, with 39%
and 13% of adults overweight or obese, respectively, and car-
diovascular disease remaining the leading cause of mortality
globally, our data emphasize the role of BMI, a modifiable risk
factor, in cardiometabolic disease and the importance of re-
ducing BMI at a population level to lower the incidence of car-
diometabolic disease.
Conclusions
We report that BMI increases the risk of CHD, hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, and diastolic and systolic BPs based on causal
MRestimates.Bodymassindexrepresentsanimportantmodi-
fiable risk factor for ameliorating the risk of cardiometabolic
disease in the general population.
