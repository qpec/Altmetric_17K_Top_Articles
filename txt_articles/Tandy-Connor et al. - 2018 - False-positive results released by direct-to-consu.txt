Purpose: There is increasing demand from the public for direct-
to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, and the US Food and Drug
Administration limits the type of health-related claims DTC tests
can market. Some DTC companies provide raw genotyping data to
customers if requested, and these raw data may include variants
occurring in genes recommended by the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics to be reported as incidental/secondary
findings. The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of
requests for clinical confirmation of DTC results that were received by
our laboratory and to analyze variant classification concordance.
Methods: We identified 49 patient samples received for further testing
that had previously identified genetic variants reported in DTC raw
data. For each case identified, information pertaining to the outcome of
clinical confirmation testing as well as classification of the DTC variant
was collected and analyzed.
Results: Our analyses indicated that 40% of variants in a variety of
genes reported in DTC raw data were false positives. In addition, some
variants designated with the “increased risk” classification in DTC raw
data or by a third-party interpretation service were classified as benign
at Ambry Genetics as well as several other clinical laboratories, and are
noted to be common variants in publicly available population frequency
databases.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the importance of confirming
DTC raw data variants in a clinical laboratory that is well versed in both
complex variant detection and classification.

INTRODUCTION
Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests are advertised and
sold directly to the public and offer information that may
include ancestry, risks of developing certain conditions,
carrier status for autosomal recessive diseases, predicted drug
response, and nondisease phenotypic traits such as eye color.
Owing to a growing interest in human genetics and
personalized health care, there has been an increased demand
for this type of testing from the public. There is a growing
market for DTC genetic testing, with numerous companies
(e.g., Family Tree DNA, My Heritage, 23andMe, ancestry.
com) currently offering products to the public. DTC tests can
provide
genetic
information
to
individuals
who
might
otherwise never have been tested due to circumstances such
as lack of a family history of disease, inaccessibility of clinical
genetic testing, prohibitive cost, or poor insurance coverage.
However, unlike clinical genetic tests, DTC tests are not
diagnostic and offer risk information for only a limited set of
conditions.
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) restricts DTC genetic testing companies from offering
products that function as diagnostic tests.1 In April 2017, the
FDA authorized one DTC company, 23andMe, to market
genetic
health
risk
tests
for
10
specific
multifactorial
conditions (Parkinson disease, late-onset Alzheimer disease,
celiac disease, α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, early-onset primary
dystonia, factor XI deficiency, Gaucher disease type 1,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hereditary
hemochromatosis,
and
hereditary
thrombophilia).2
The
genetic health risk tests authorized by the FDA provide
information on an individual’s risk of developing a condition.
This is based on the presence or absence of a limited list of
genetic variants in the sample, which are statistically enriched
in affected versus healthy cohorts but not necessarily causal of
the conditions because additional factors such as environment
and lifestyle influence an individual’s risk. None of the genes
associated
with
these
conditions
are
comprehensively
sequenced or analyzed in DTC tests, nor do the tests include
all of the genes that have been associated with these
conditions. For example, 23andMe’s genetic health risk test
reports on just one variant in each of two genes linked to
Parkinson disease: LRRK2 and GBA.3 However, there are
additional known pathogenic variants in these two genes as
well as additional genes clinically associated with Parkinson
disease that 23andMe does not report on, such as SNCA and
PARK2/PARKIN.4 Therefore, the consumer is not provided
with a comprehensive genetic risk assessment.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
 In contrast, clinical diagnostic genetic tests are ordered by a
patient’s medical provider and are used to identify or rule out
a specific genetic condition. One example is clinical testing for
the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. If an individual has a
pathogenic variant in one of these genes, it is considered
diagnostic for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome,
whether or not she or he has a personal diagnosis of cancer.
Diagnostic tests are generally comprehensive because the full
coding sequences of all genes associated with a disease are
analyzed. The test results are intended to be used by a
patient’s medical provider to guide disease management or
surveillance.
While the FDA currently prohibits most DTC companies
from offering diagnostic genetic tests, some companies
provide customers their raw genotyping data if requested,
which
may
include
variants
in
genes
associated
with
Mendelian diseases, including those recommended by the
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics to be
reported as incidental or secondary findings in genomic
testing. These genes are implicated in highly penetrant genetic
disorders for which surgical or other interventions aimed at
preventing or significantly reducing morbidity and mortality
are available to pathogenic variant carriers.5 Identification of a
pathogenic variant in one of these genes could be diagnostic
of a medical condition with potential implications for an
individual’s medical management.
The raw data are often accompanied by a disclaimer that
the information is neither validated for accuracy nor intended
for medical use. While DTC companies do not provide
interpretation of the raw data, patients can access interpreta-
tion services through third-party companies, which may
charge a fee.6 One recent study on such third-party companies
found that several operate by querying publicly available
databases, such as dbSNP, and reporting the classification
provided in the database, despite reports that the majority of
classifications in some publicly
available databases
are
incorrect.6,7 As a result, returned results may interpret
particular single-nucleotide polymorphisms as pathogenic,
even though clinical laboratories may classify the same
variants as unknown significance, likely benign variants, or
benign polymorphisms. In addition, they are providing
information to the consumer with the assumption that
variants in the raw data are true calls and not false positives.
The misinterpretation and potential inaccuracy of the raw
data pose substantial risks to individuals who obtain this type
of information from a DTC company. For these reasons,
medical providers should order confirmatory genetic testing
from an experienced clinical diagnostic laboratory to guide
patients’ medical care.8–10
What drives a consumer to pursue DTC genetic testing,
their perceived usefulness of the final results, their under-
standing of how comprehensive a test may or may not have
been, and the utilization of a genetic counselor or another
health-care provider vary widely.11,12 DTC results may lead to
healthy changes in lifestyle and/or diet,13 but could also result
in unfavorable emotions, including anxiety when obtaining
unexpected information and disappointment in a lack of
comprehensive diagnostic analysis.12 Regardless of whether a
health-care provider is involved with the initial ordering of a
patient’s DTC genetic test, the results can lead to important
health-related discussions with medical providers. With the
ever-growing shortage of genetic counselors and other highly
trained genetic professionals, there is concern regarding how
DTC test results are interpreted and used among medical
providers who often have minimal genetic training.11 It is
therefore imperative that consumers, as well as their medical
provider(s), are aware of the wide array of limitations to this
type of genetic testing, especially in regard to an individual’s
clinical management. Recent studies have started to evaluate
pre- and post-DTC testing encounters with health-care
providers including genetic counselors;14 however, to our
knowledge, no studies have described outcomes of raw data
confirmatory testing referrals to clinical diagnostic labora-
tories. We aimed to investigate the types of cases referred to
our clinical diagnostic laboratory and evaluate the concor-
dance of confirmatory test results for cases with variants
identified in the raw data by DTC genetic testing. We also
aimed to investigate whether our variant classification was in
agreement with that provided by the DTC testing company or
third-party interpretation service.15
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our internal database was queried to identify patients referred
for testing at our clinical diagnostic laboratory (Ambry
Genetics, Aliso Viejo, CA)16,17 with variants previously
identified
by
DTC
testing
between
January
2014
and
December 2016. To identify such cases, all communications
and curated clinical history information in our laboratory
information management system were searched using key
phrases including, but not limited to, “direct-to-consumer”
and “DTC.” For each case identified (n = 49), the following
information was collected: ordering provider type/specialty,
test ordered, DTC results (gene, variant name, variant
classification), disease status, and source of DTC results
(e.g., copy of DTC report, a copy of a third-party interpreta-
tion service report, patient clinic note, information hand-
written by clinician on the test requisition form). The data
pertaining to the company providing the DTC testing or
interpretation service were collected with the sole purpose of
being able to resolve any testing discrepancies if necessary and
not for publication purposes. DTC genetic test results,
including reported variant classifications, were compared
with confirmatory test results and were categorized as
confirmed (patient determined to be positive for the variant)
or not confirmed (patient determined to be negative for the
variant).
While the testing methodologies used by DTC companies
can vary, all testing at Ambry Genetics was performed by
Sanger or next-generation sequencing analysis with Sanger
confirmation, depending on the clinical test ordered. Sanger
sequencing was performed on samples received for single-site
analysis or full-gene analysis.16,17 Briefly, genomic DNA was

 amplified with gene-specific primers and bidirectionally
sequenced using Big Dye Terminator version 3.1 on an
ABI3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Chromatogram analysis was conducted using Sequence
Pilot version 4.2.1 (JSI Medical Systems, Boston, MA).
Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed on
samples received for multigene panels.18,19 Briefly, customized
target-enrichment oligonucleotide libraries were designed
using IDT xGen Lockdown probes (Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies, Coralville, IA). Genomic DNA was mechanically
sheared to 300-bp fragments with an ultrasonicator (Covaris,
Woburn, MA) and next-generation sequencing libraries were
prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Kapa
Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Adapter-ligated DNA was
hybridized to custom IDT xGen Lockdown probes, eluted,
and polymerase chain reaction–amplified. Final libraries were
sequenced on either HiSeq2500 or NextSeq500 instruments
generating 150-bp paired-end reads (Illumina, San Diego,
CA).20

RESULTS
Study demographics and test order characteristics
Patient demographics and test order characteristics are shown
in Table 1. In total, we identified 49 patients referred for
clinical diagnostic testing with variants previously identified
in the raw data from DTC genetic testing. There were a total
of 26 unique variants submitted for testing including 4 located
within deep intronic regions well beyond the analytical range
of most clinical laboratories. Nearly all of the individuals in
this study were female (91.8%), and most were unaffected
with disease at the time of testing (73.5%). Slightly over half of
individuals in this study were 30–49 years old (53.1%) and
reported Caucasian ancestry (51.1%). While some individuals
(n = 7) who underwent DTC genetic testing had a personal
history of disease (affected), the majority (n = 35) did not
have a personal history of disease reported to our lab by the
ordering provider (unaffected). There was one case in which
the clinical history was not available (unknown).
The majority of the medical providers who ordered the
confirmatory testing were medical geneticists/genetic counse-
lors (40.8%) followed by oncologists (20.4%). For 44.9% of all
cases, single-site analysis was ordered to confirm DTC raw
data findings, and more comprehensive testing via single-gene
or multigene panel testing was ordered in 55.1% of cases.
Testing of cancer genes comprised 87.8% of the orders. When
samples were submitted to our laboratory, the variant of
interest was reported to Ambry Genetics on the test
requisition form or in a clinic note 53.1% of the time, and
in only 26.5% of the cases was a copy of the DTC test results
(prior to the FDA regulations) or the raw data information
provided. In 20.4% of cases, a copy of the third-party
interpretation service report was provided. As shown in

 Table 1, the vast majority of variants occurred in cancer
susceptibility genes (87.8%), with the remaining variants in
genes causing cystic fibrosis (8.2%), familial Mediterranean
fever (2.0%), and connective-tissue disorders (2.0%).
Variant confirmation
Overall, 60% of the variants analyzed were confirmed, while
40% were not confirmed (false positives) (Figure 1). All CFTR
(n = 4, all deltaF508) and MEFV variants (n = 2) were
confirmed. Of BRCA1/2 variants identified on DTC genetic
testing, pathogenic Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants were
confirmed in all cases (n = 13), as were four additional
variants; however, eight BRCA1/2 variants yielded false-
positive results. In CHEK2, the common 1100delC pathogenic
European founder variant was confirmed in 50% of cases
(n = 2/4) and was a false positive in the other 50% of cases.
The single case reporting the CHEK2 p.I157T founder variant
was confirmed. A total of six additional variants in cancer
susceptibility genes were not confirmed, including TP53 p.
R175H (n = 3), ATM p.M1040V (n = 1), MLH1 p.H329P
(n = 1), and MLH1 c.1101delC (n = 1) (Figure 1,Table 2).
Of the 40% of false-positive calls, 94.1% (n = 16/17) were in
cancer-related genes and the remaining 5.9% (n = 1) was in a
connective-tissue disorder gene.
Classification discrepancies
Eight variants in five genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, COL3A1,
and COL5A1) were designated with the “increased risk”
classification in DTC raw data or by a third-party interpreta-
tion service. These variants are classified as benign at Ambry
as well as at several other clinical laboratories21 (Table 3). In
addition, per the Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes,
and dbSNP population frequency databases that are publicly
available, these ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and COL3A1 gene
variants are found in the general population at frequencies too
high to be associated with disease (Table 3) (refs. 22–24).
Case example: Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
An in-depth review of the COL3A1 case revealed that the
patient was undergoing evaluation to rule out Ehlers–Danlos
syndrome and presented DTC genetic testing results to the
clinician revealing one COL3A1 “mutation” and four COL5A1
“mutations.” To confirm these findings, the clinician ordered
a 22-gene panel for thoracic aortic dilation and dissection,
including COL3A1 and COL5A1, and received a negative
report. No DTC report was provided at the time, so the
precise variants in question were unknown. Upon follow-up
communication with the provider to request the DTC report,
we received a report from a third-party DTC raw data
interpretation service that revealed the following variants for
this patient: COL3A1 p.A698T (c.2092G > A), COL5A1 c.655-
8689C > T,
COL5A1
c.654+2749A > G,
COL5A1
c.1827
+399C > T, and COL5A1 c.1827+1142T > C. The COL3A1
variant was not detected by our lab in this patient, and it
would not have been reported if it had been detected, as our
laboratory classifies this as benign. Furthermore, the COL3A1
and all four of the COL5A1 variants were labeled as increasing
the patient’s risk of disease; however, the COL3A1 variant and
three of the COL5A1 variants were classified as benign by our
laboratory, with the fourth COL5A1 variant classified as a
variant of unknown significance. In addition, all four COL5A1
variants were located in deep intronic regions not included in
our analytical range due to unproven association with disease
(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The recent proliferation of DTC companies increases the
general population’s access to genetic testing, including
healthy individuals. DTC test results are not intended to
impact
an
individual’s
medical
management;
however,
information obtained from requesting and interpreting raw
data could lead to inappropriate changes in their care. While
the raw data include disclaimers stating that they have not
been validated for accuracy and are therefore not intended for
medical use, they could easily be misinterpreted or misused by

 a consumer or medical provider with little to no training on
the complexities of genetics. Both false-positive results and
misclassification of variants can result in significant implica-
tions for an individual, including unnecessary stress, medical
procedures (e.g., surgery, frequent screenings), and testing of
family members. All of these factors have the potential to
result in unwarranted financial burden on individuals and the
health-care system overall.
This study focused on variants reported in the raw data of
DTC genetic testing and our two key findings were an
alarmingly high false-positive rate (40%) and the incidence of
discrepant classification/misinterpretation of variants coming
from DTC companies and/or third-party interpretation
services. The technical differences between the types of
testing methodologies used may explain why 40% of the
results in our study were discordant with the raw data from
the DTC testing company. Many of the DTC genetic testing
laboratories use a form of single-nucleotide polymorphism
genotyping array for their assay. This particular methodology
is analogous to spot checking an individual’s DNA with
coverage at only specific preselected sites. This is not
comprehensive full-gene sequencing nor does it include gross
deletion or duplication analyses, which are both routinely part
of clinical diagnostic testing with the use of next-generation
sequencing
and
microarray/multiplex
ligation-dependent
probe amplification methodologies. Even when comparing
single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays between DTC com-
panies, it is possible to see a high degree of variability, as
probe coverage varies between companies due to differences
in assay design.
Encouraging all laboratories, whether they are DTC or
clinical, to share their data is one way to reduce variant
classification errors.25–27 Requiring DTC companies and any
associated third-party interpretation services to utilize and
review information from well-curated and highly regarded
genetic databases could also aid in reducing these types of

 errors.5 These third-party reporting services typically do not
use any form of multievidence algorithms or weigh various
interpretation factors, such as classification discrepancies
between testing laboratories, despite the availability of this
information in some public databases such as ClinVar. In the
meantime, it is crucial that clinical confirmatory testing be
performed on any variants reported in the raw data provided
by a DTC company prior to any changes in medical
management to confirm the presence of that variant in the
individual as well as an accurate classification.
In addition to concerns regarding false-positive results and
inaccurate classification of variants as pathogenic versus
benign, all parties involved with these types of test results
should be aware that many DTC genetic tests do not include
comprehensive gene analysis, and an individual may still need
additional clinical diagnostic genetic testing based on personal
and/or family history. It is important that consumers and
their health-care providers are cognizant of the differences in
testing methodologies between clinical diagnostic labs and
DTC testing labs so that there is no false reassurance or alarm
on the behalf of the individual or the health-care provider.
All of these potential ramifications highlight the need for
clinical confirmation testing of raw data variants. The 49 cases
represented in this study are from individuals who shared
their DTC genetic test results with their medical providers,
and they represent the circumstances in which the medical
providers knew the results warranted follow-up clinical
testing. Unfortunately, these actions on part of both the
individual and the medical provider may not be common-
place at this point in time. A limitation of this study design is
that we were unable to analyze the complete financial burden
that these types of test results may place on our health-care
system. While this study has a small sample size (n = 49),
further efforts to gather data on a larger cohort are underway.
This will allow us to better determine the extent of discordant
results between DTC tests and clinical diagnostic tests. The
findings in this study are also limited to the genes for which
our clinical diagnostic laboratory offers testing (https://www.
ambrygen.com).
CONCLUSION
Our analysis revealed a high false-positive rate (40%) in genes
with potential clinical impact in the raw genotyping data
provided to consumers by DTC genetic testing companies, as
well as eight instances of misinterpretation of variants by
third-party interpretation services. This
emphasizes the
limitations in raw genotyping data currently distributed by
DTC
companies
and
demonstrates
the
importance
of
confirming DTC raw data results in a diagnostic laboratory
that is well versed in clinical-grade variant detection and
classification. While having access to raw genotyping data can
be informative and empowering for patients, this type of
information can also be inaccurate and misinterpreted.
Genetic testing needs to be interpreted by a qualified
health-care professional in the context of several other factors,
such as personal and family medical history. It is our hope
that confirmatory testing and appropriate clinical manage-
ment by all health-care professionals accompany DTC genetic
testing for at-risk patients.
