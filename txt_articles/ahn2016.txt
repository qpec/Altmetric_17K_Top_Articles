OBJECTIVES: 
 
Data from the United States are lacking regarding the impact of entecavir (ETV) on the risk of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aim is to determine whether treatment with ETV is associated 
with a reduced HCC risk by calculating the expected HCC incidence based on the Risk Estimation 
for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chronic Hepatitis B (REACH-B) model and comparing it with the 
observed HCC incidence.
 
METHODS: 
 
The incidence of HCC in US patients treated with ETV between 2005 and 2013 in a retrospective 
cohort was obtained. The predicted HCC incidence was calculated using the REACH-B model. The 
standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as a ratio of observed over predicted HCC cases.
 
RESULTS: 
 
Of 841 patients, 646 (65% male, 84% Asian, median age 47 years, 36% hepatitis B e antigen 
positive, 9.4% with cirrhosis) met the inclusion criteria. Over a median follow-up of 4 years, 17 
(2.6%) cases of HCC were diagnosed, including 8 out of 61 (13.1%) patients with cirrhosis and 9 
out of 585 (1.5%) without cirrhosis. Compared with those without HCC, the 17 patients with HCC 
were older at 53 years vs. 47 years and more likely to have cirrhosis at 47.1% vs. 8.4%. Among 
patients without cirrhosis, the observed HCC incidence was signifi
 cantly lower than predicted by the 
fourth year (SIR, 0.37; 95% confi
 dence interval: 0.166–0.82). A sensitivity analysis that comprised 
all patients, including those with cirrhosis, showed that at the maximum follow-up time of 8.2 years, 
a signifi
 cantly lower than predicted HCC incidence was noted with an SIR of 0.56 (95% confi
 dence 
interval: 0.35–0.905).
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
Based on the REACH-B model, long-term ETV therapy was associated with a lower than predicted 
HCC incidence. However, the risk of HCC persisted, and careful HCC surveillance remains warranted 
despite the anti-viral treatment.

INTRODUCTION
 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health chal-
lenge with >240 million infected and up to 650,000 individuals 
dying annually from complications of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 
including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ( 
1 
). 
Despite implementation of vaccination programs and improve-
ments in HBV treatments, patients with CHB remain at risk for 
the development of HCC ( 
2 
). Th
 e risk is estimated at <1% per year 
in patients without cirrhosis and at least 2–3% per year in those 
with cirrhosis ( 
3–5 
).
 
Th
 ere have been several prospective, population-based studies 
with long-term follow-up to determine HCC risk in patients with 
CHB ( 
6 
). Risk factors for HCC in CHB include unalterable factors 
such as age, gender, and family history of HCC, and potentially 
modifi
 able factors such as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HBV DNA levels, and envi-
ronmental exposures such as alcohol use. Taking these variables 
into account, several formulas have been developed to estimate 
the predicted risk of HCC in patients with CHB ( 
7–9 
). Th
 e Risk 
Estimation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chronic Hepatitis B 
(REACH-B) model was derived in Taiwanese patients without 
cirrhosis who were followed for more than 10 years without the 
anti-viral therapy ( 
9 
). Th
 e model has been validated in a multi-
center cohort of Asian patients that included patients with and 
without cirrhosis ( 
10 
). Th
 e model contains fi
 ve variables: gender, 
age, HBV DNA level, ALT level, and HBeAg status, and scores 
between 0 and 17.
 
Th
 e REACH-B model has subsequently been applied to evalu-
ate the impact of anti-viral therapy on the development of HCC 
in patients with CHB by comparing the observed vs. predicted 
incidence of HCC. In the absence of prospective, randomized 
trials of CHB treatment with HCC prevention as an end point, 
the REACH-B model provides a virtual control group of patients 
whose HCC incidence may be estimated based on readily obtain-
able clinical variables. In this large, US, multicenter registry 
of CHB patients treated with entecavir (ETV), we examined 
whether anti-viral treatment is associated with a reduced HCC 
risk by calculating the expected incidence of HCC based on the 
REACH-B model and comparing it to the observed incidence 
of HCC.
 
METHODS
 
Study design and patient population
 
Th
 e ENtecavir Utilization, Management, and Effi
  cacy in the 
United States: a MulTi-cEnter Study (ENUMERATE) was an 
observational, retrospective, multicenter cohort study of treat-
ment-naïve, CHB patients who received at least 12 months of 
ETV therapy between April 2005 and April 2013 in 26 commu-
nity and university clinical centers throughout the United States. 
Th
 e ENUMERATE study was conducted in partnership with the 
Asian Health Foundation, a nonprofi
 t organization dedicated to 
improving the health of Asian Americans and Pacifi
 c Islanders, 
composed of health-care providers with a focus on viral hepatitis. 
Th
 e Institutional Review Board at each center approved the study. 
A central Institutional Review Board was used for centers that did 
not have their own Institutional Review Boards.
 
Th
 e ENUMERATE trial design and case report form description 
had been described in detail in the initial ENUMERATE publi-
cation on the eff
 ectiveness of ETV including secondary outcome 
measures such as mortality and liver-related complications ( 
11 
). 
Patients were identifi
 ed at each center through review of internal 
databases and medical records. Demographic, clinical, and labo-
ratory data, HBV treatment history, and ETV treatment details 
were recorded. All laboratory testing was obtained at the respec-
tive local laboratories for each center. A web-based electronic case 
report form was specifi
 cally designed for this study and data col-
lection was carried out between January 2013 and January 2014. 
An independent data monitor reviewed the submitted electronic 
case report forms for data quality, completeness, and accuracy.
 
Of participants of the ENUMERATE study, the following 
eligibility criteria were applied to be included in this REACH-B 
analysis: (i) age ≥18 years old, (ii) known baseline HBeAg status, 
(iii) no anti-viral therapy before ETV, and (iv) receipt of ETV for 
at least 12 months. Patients with a prior history of HCC, known 
coinfection with the human immunodefi
 ciency virus, hepatitis C 
virus, or hepatitis D virus, or a history of solid organ transplanta-
tion were excluded. Patients receiving combination therapy with 
another anti-HBV therapy or were enrolled in other clinical trials 
for HBV were also excluded.
 
In eligible patients, the presence of cirrhosis was determined 
based on liver histology, evidence of clinical decompensation 
(ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding), or radio-
logical fi
 ndings (nodular liver, intra-abdominal collaterals/varices 
or splenomegaly) or endoscopic features (varices in the esophagus 
or stomach).
 
Outcomes and follow-up
 
Th
 e patients’
 indication for ETV treatment and management were 
at the discretion of their providers. Surveillance for HCC was 
performed at the discretion of the treating provider at each site 
according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Dis-
eases guidelines ( 
12 
). Patients were followed from the initiation 
of ETV treatment to the end of data collection on January 2014.
 
Th
 e primary outcome was the observed diagnosis of HCC, using 
the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria 
( 
12 
). Each HCC diagnosis was verifi
 ed with a review of the primary 
source documents including pathology and radiographic reports. 
Th
 e observed incidence of HCC was compared with what would 
be expected based on the REACH-B prediction model. Th
 is 
comparison was accomplished by calculating the standardized 
incidence ratios (SIRs). Details on the analysis are described in 
the next section.
 
Statistical analysis
 
Data analysis was performed using version 9.4 of the SAS System 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For descriptive statistics of baseline and 
follow-up data, mean with standard deviations or median with 
range were calculated for continuous data, while proportions (%) 
were used for categorical data. Comparisons between groups were

HCC Incidence in HBV Patients Treated With Entecavir
conducted using Student’
s  
t 
-test or the Wilcoxon’
s rank-sum test if 
the distribution was not symmetric for continuous variables. Th
 e 
 
χ 
2 test was used for comparison between categorical variables. 
Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative prob-
ability of HCC over time.
 
Th
 e expected or predicted HCC incidences were calculated 
using the REACH-B model, which incorporates age, gender, 
HBeAg status, serum ALT levels, and HBV DNA levels. In each 
patient, the REACH-B score was the calculated sum of products 
between  
β 
-coeffi
  cients of the equation and the patient’
s baseline 
data. Th
 e score, in turn, was used to estimate HCC-free survival 
at years 1 to 10, and was obtained based on underlying survival 
functions obtained from the REACH-B authors. For HCCs occur-
ring between full calendar years, linear interpolation was used to 
calculate the expected survival.
 
SIRs were calculated as a ratio of observed over predicted HCC 
cases in the studies for particular time intervals. Th
 e 95% confi
 -
dence interval (95% CIs) were calculated by Poisson regression 
without covariates with an off
 set equal to log 
e (number of predicted 
cases). In patients who were lost to follow-up, exposure time was 
from baseline to the time of dropout (e.g., predicted HCC cases 
refl
 ected the number of subjects “
at risk” at a given time point and 
were not based on the entire cohort at baseline).
 
While REACH-B was derived in patients without cirrhosis, it 
was subsequently validated in a patient cohort that included cir-
rhosis ( 
10 
). Our primary analysis was in patients without cirrhosis. 
However, additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken of only 
patients with cirrhosis, all patients regardless of their cirrhosis 
status, and in Asian patients. Evaluation was performed with and 
without the inclusion of HCC cases diagnosed within the fi
 rst year, 
to exclude prevalent cases. We also used the recently published 
PAGE-B model, which is calculated based on patients’
 age, gender, 
and platelet count, and validated in a Caucasian cohort, for further 
sensitivity analysis and evaluation of its prognostic capability in 
our mainly Asian cohort ( 
13 
).
 
RESULTS
 
 
Of a total of 841 patients recruited from 26 sites, 646 met the 
inclusion criteria for the REACH-B analysis. Th
 e majority of 
patients excluded from the study had incomplete baseline data 
disallowing calculation of the REACH-B score ( 
n 
=183). Twelve 
additional patients with unknown cirrhosis status were excluded. 
Th
 e excluded group had a lower percentage of males, Asian race, 
and HBV DNA levels, but otherwise was similar to the included 
group with respect to age, HBeAg status, cirrhosis status, ALT 
levels, and HCC rates. Th
 ere were nine cases of HCC among these 
195 patients that were excluded.
 
Sixteen sites were university based and 10 were community 
based.  
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics: 65% were male, 
with a median age of 46.9 years. Th
 e vast majority (83.6%) were 
Asian, 8.4% was white, 4.3% African-American, and 3.7% of 
other races. Two hundred and thirty (35.6%) patients were HBeAg 
positive, and 61 (9.4%) had cirrhosis at baseline. Of the 61 patients 
with cirrhosis, 60 were diagnosed with cirrhosis based on histology 
and/or radiological study fi
 ndings. One patient was diagnosed 
with cirrhosis based on endoscopic fi
 ndings of varices. Th
 e median 
HBV DNA was 5.8 log 10 (1.9–10.2)  IU/ml and median ALT level 
was 59 (6–3286)  U/l. Patients with cirrhosis tended to be older and 
Asian. However, laboratory data were comparable, including ALT, 
HBV DNA, and HBeAg status.
 
A total of 17 (2.6%) cases of HCC were observed over a median 
follow-up of 4 (1–8.3) years, including 8 out of 61 (13.1%) patients 
with cirrhosis and 9 out of 585 (1.5%) patients without cirrhosis 
( 
Figure 1 
). As shown in  
Table 2 
, of the 17 cases of HCC, the aver-
age age was 53 years, 12 (71%) were male, 14 (82%) were Asian, 
8 (47.1%) had cirrhosis, 6 (35.3%) were HBeAg positive, and the 
baseline HBV DNA was 5.8 log 10 IU/ml and ALT level was 58 U/l. 
Patients who developed HCC were older (53 vs. 47 years,  
P 
=0.014) 
and more likely to have cirrhosis (47.1 vs. 8.4%,  
P 
<0.001) than 
those who did not. Th
 e baseline HBV DNA and ALT levels were 
similar in both groups, suggesting that these variables may not 
infl
 uence the risk of HCC development in the presence of ETV 
therapy.
 
Table 3 
 presents the comparison between the observed vs. the 
expected number of HCC among participants without cirrhosis 
in the ENUMERATE study. During the fi
 rst year, three patients 
developed HCC, whereas the REACH-B model predicted 4.7 
cases by the end of the fi
 rst year, which gives rise to an SIR of 0.64. 
With longer observation, the SIR decreased fairly rapidly—by the 
end of the fourth year, the SIR was 0.37, which reached statistical 
signifi
 cance with a 95% CI of 0.166—0.82. Subsequent data until 
the maximum observed time of 8.2 years showed that the incidence 
reduction essentially remained unchanged (SIR=0.36) ( 
Figure 2a 
).
 
Table 4 shows the comparison between the observed vs. pre-
dicted number of HCC cases among participants with cirrhosis.

For the eight HCC cases in the cirrhosis group, the SIR ranged 
from 1.25 to 1.45. At the end of follow-up, the SIR was 1.45 (95% 
CI: 0.724–2.895), which was not statistically signifi
 cant.  
Figure 2b 
shows the comparisons in graphical form.
 
Table 5 
 describes a sensitivity analysis in which the analysis was 
repeated with all ENUMERATE participants including those with 
cirrhosis. By the fourteenth case of HCC, the REACH-B model 
predicted 25.8 cases, with an SIR of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.321–0.916) 
or a 46% lower than expected HCC cases. Overall, at the maxi-
mum observed time of 8.2 years, 30.2 cases of HCC were expected, 
whereas 17 cases were observed with an SIR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.35–
0.905).  
Figure 2c displays the data graphically.
 
Supplementary Table 1 shows the sensitivity analysis performed 
by excluding patients with HCC diagnosed during the fi
 rst year of 
ETV therapy. Th
 is was performed as these HCC cases may repre-
sent prevalent cases at entecavir initiation and treatment would not 
be expected to have any impact on these cases. Exclusion of HCC 
cases diagnosed within the fi
 rst year showed a signifi
 cant reduc-
tion in SIR by year 2 of treatment, with an SIR of 0.10 (95% CI: 
0.01–0.68) for patients without cirrhosis, an SIR of 0.91 (95% CI 
of 0.294–2.822) in patients with cirrhosis, and an SIR of 0.29 (95% 
CI: 0.109–0.78) overall.
 
Supplementary Table 2 shows additional sensitivity analysis 
performed on Asian patients. Fourteen patients with cirrhosis 
developed HCC by year 5. Th
 e eff
 ect of ETV on Asian patients was 
similar to the overall population with SIR of 0.42 (95% CI: 0.202–
0.891) by year 5 in those without cirrhosis. Exclusion of HCC cases 
diagnosed in the fi
 rst year further reduced the SIR in both those 
with and without cirrhosis. Likely due to the small number of HCC 
cases, the overall REACH-B estimates in only Asians did not reach 
statistical signifi
 cance.
 
Finally,  
Supplementary Table 3 shows the results of the PAGE-B 
model sensitivity analysis. Overall, the PAGE-B model predicted 
13.9 cases by year 5, while we observed 12 cases in our study, 
with an SIR of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.489–1.517). For patients without 
cirrhosis, 10.1 cases were predicted, while 5 were observed, and 
for patients with cirrhosis, 3.8 cases were predicted, while 7 were 
observed. Th
 ese fi
 ndings were not statistically signifi
 cant.
 
DISCUSSION
 
In this large, retrospective US cohort study, the observed inci-
dence of HCC in patients with CHB treated with ETV was lower 
than that predicted using the REACH-B model for both the 
patients without cirrhosis and the overall cohort. Th
 ese fi
 ndings 
suggest that anti-HBV therapy with ETV is associated with a lower 
incidence of HCC in patients with CHB.
 
Since the sole placebo-controlled, randomized trial of anti-viral 
therapy to study the impact of lamivudine in CHB patients with 
advanced fi
 brosis and cirrhosis as reported by Liaw  
et al. ( 
14 
), there 
have been no further randomized studies on this issue. Th
 at study 
was terminated aft
 er an interim analysis showed a clear benefi
 t 
of lamivudine in preventing disease progression and liver related 
death; however, only a strong trend towards HCC reduction was 
observed when HCC cases within the fi
 rst year were excluded. 
Longer follow-up or utilization of anti-virals with higher barrier 
to resistance such as ETV or tenofovir (TDF) may have better 
demonstrated a chemopreventive eff
 ect of anti-HBV therapy on 
the incidence of HCC.
 
 
Since the study by Liaw and co-workers ( 
15–20 
), a number of 
observational, nonrandomized studies have suggested benefi
 -
cial eff
 ects of anti-viral therapy on HCC risk in CHB patients. 
Only one such study was conducted in the United States, which 
compared 820 patients treated with various anti-viral therapies 
to 1,851 untreated controls and found that the adjusted hazard 
ratio of developing HCC in the treated patients was 0.39 (95% CI: 
0.27–0.56) ( 
21 
). However, this and other similar studies inevitably

HCC Incidence in HBV Patients Treated With Entecavir
entailed a selection bias where there may have been a fundamental 
diff
 erence between patients who received long-term anti-viral 
therapy vs. those who were not given the opportunity. While these 
biases may be mitigated by statistical maneuvers (e.g., propensity 
scores) used in some studies, other studies do not report specifi
 c 
details regarding patient selection, choice of anti-viral therapy, or 
duration of treatment.
 
Given these limitations, the utilization of prediction models such 
as REACH-B has been proposed as an indirect method to demon-
strate the impact of anti-virals. In a previous study, REACH-B was 
used to assess the impact of TDF on HCC in a trial registry data 
set. Th
 e study, based on 634 patients, reported that TDF treat-
ment was associated with an overall SIR of 0.37 or 63% lower than 
expected HCC incidence. For patients without cirrhosis, the SIR 
was 0.28 or a 72% lower than expected HCC incidence ( 
22 
). In a 
Canadian study, the eff
 ect of anti-viral therapy on HCC incidence 
was assessed in 322 patients treated with a variety of anti-virals 
including ETV and TDF. Over a median of 3.2 years follow-up, 
11 HCC cases were identifi
 ed, compared with 24 predicted by the 
REACH-B model, yielding an SIR of 0.46 ( 
23 
).
 
In contrast, several European studies have not demonstrated 
HCC risk reduction with anti-viral therapy and have raised the 
question whether the REACH-B model may not be applicable to 
patients who are not of Asian descent. Indeed, as the model was 
derived in Taiwan and was developed and validated exclusively in 
Asian patients, applicability to non-Asians may be limited ( 
24,25 
)
However, the results of this current study align with the TDF regis-
tration study and the Canadian study with a similar magnitude of 
HCC risk reduction. Th
 is may be related to the fact that the data set 
for the ENUMERATE study is composed predominantly of par-
ticipants who are of Asian descent and without cirrhosis, in whom 
the prediction by REACH-B may be more accurate compared with 
other Western data sets that do not have a predominance of Asian 
participants. However, the TDF registry data in which REACH-B 
seemed relevant consisted of a majority of non-Asian partici-
pants. Finally, our results suggest that the PAGE-B score, which

was derived in a Caucasian population, may have limitations in its 
applicability in a predominantly Asian cohort, suggesting the need 
for further validation studies.
 
To our knowledge, this is the largest US study enrolling patients 
from both university and community sites on treatment with ETV. 
As such, this allows the capture of “real-world” observational data 
on the impact of ETV on HCC that refl
 ects the challenges faced by 
providers and patients in dealing with CHB in clinical practice. In 
particular, data derived in community clinics that are at the front-
lines of CHB care in many diverse communities strengthens the 
generalizability of this study. Th
 is study also has a robust sample 
size and suffi
  ciently long-term follow-up of the cohort.
 
Th
 e limitations of this study lie mainly in its retrospective 
design, precluding a regimented follow-up with regard to clinical 
monitoring and HCC surveillance and reporting. Nevertheless, we 
did use a standardized data collection structure and process to try 
to capture all relevant data as available to the investigators. 
Furthermore, the shortcomings of the design need to be weighed 
against the unique nature of the multicenter data including the 
partnership between university and community practices. In addi-
tion, the number of observed HCC cases was small at 17, limiting 
further analysis in subgroups. Th
 is is however in part a result of 
the main eff
 ect that is being reported in the study, namely, signifi
 -
cant reduction in HCC risk. We considered all HCC cases, which 
may have included prevalent cases that were diagnosed in the fi
 rst 
year of the study. Th
 is was carried out to refl
 ect the REACH-B study, 
which included all HCC cases during the fi
 rst year of follow-up. 
Excluding the HCC cases diagnosed in the fi
 rst year resulted in a 
further reduction of the SIR.
 
 
In summary, in this “real-world” study of a large number of US 
patients, treatment with ETV was associated with a 64% lower 
observed than expected HCC incidence in CHB patients without 
cirrhosis. It also showed that the key risk factors for HCC deve-
lopment despite anti-viral therapy include age and the presence 
of cirrhosis. Th
 e sensitivity analysis of only patients with cirrhosis 
suggests that the REACH-B model, which was based on patients 
without cirrhosis, likely underestimates the incidence of HCC in 
patients with cirrhosis. Importantly, while the observed number of

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
Hepatitis B is associated with an increased risk of develop-
ing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
 
✓ 
 
There has been only a single, randomized controlled trial of 
anti-viral therapy, using lamivudine, in chronic hepatitis B 
(CHB) patients who suggested a strong trend towards HCC 
risk reduction. 
 
✓ 
 
The Risk Estimation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in 
Chronic Hepatitis B (REACH-B) model has been used in 
international studies to calculate the risk of HCC. 
 
✓ 
 
There is limited data on the impact of entecavir (ETV) on 
the risk of HCC in the United States. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
The REACH-B model was used in a large US cohort to 
predict the risk of HCC, and determine the impact of ETV 
treatment on the development of HCC. 
 
✓ 
 
ETV was associated with a lower than predicted incidence 
of HCC in this large US cohort of patients from both 
university and community centers.

HCC was lower than expected in patients with CHB, HCC risk was 
not eliminated. While studies for a longer duration may shed more 
light on the maximum extent of HCC reduction, our SIR data over 
time did not show a noticeable trend of continued reduction in 
HCC risk.
 
In conclusion, ETV anti-viral therapy was associated with a 
lower than expected incidence of HCC. However, the risk of HCC 
persisted in patients with CHB and careful surveillance for HCC 
remains warranted in these patients regardless of the response to 
ETV anti-viral treatment.
