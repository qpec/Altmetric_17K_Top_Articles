Trends in Postpartum Depressive Symptoms — 27 States,  
2004, 2008, and 2012

Postpartum depression is common and associated with 
adverse infant and maternal outcomes (e.g., lower breastfeeding 
initiation and duration and poor maternal and infant bond-
ing) (1–3). A developmental Healthy People 2020 objective is 
to decrease the proportion of women delivering a live birth 
who experience postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS).* To 
provide a baseline for this objective, CDC sought to describe 
self-reported PDS overall, by reporting state, and by selected 
sociodemographic factors, using 2004, 2008, and 2012 data 
from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 
(PRAMS). A decline in the prevalence of PDS was observed 
from 2004 (14.8%) to 2012 (9.8%) among 13 states with data 
for all three periods (p<0.01). Statistically significant (p<0.05) 
declines in PDS prevalence were observed for eight states, and 
no significant changes were observed for five states. In 2012, 
the overall PDS prevalence was 11.5% for 27 states and ranged 
from 8.0% (Georgia) to 20.1% (Arkansas). By selected charac-
teristics, PDS prevalence was highest among new mothers who 
1) were aged ≤19 years or 20–24 years, 2) were of American 
Indian/Alaska Native or Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity, 
3) had ≤12 years of education, 4) were unmarried, 5) were 
postpartum smokers, 6) had three or more stressful life events 
in the year before birth, 7) gave birth to term, low-birthweight 
infants, and 8) had infants requiring neonatal intensive care 
unit admission at birth. Although the study did not investigate 
reasons for the decline, better recognition of risk factors for 
depression and improved screening and treatment before and 
during pregnancy, including increased use of antidepressants, 
might have contributed to the decline. However, more efforts 
are needed to reduce PDS prevalence in certain states and 
subpopulations of women. Ongoing surveillance and activities

and-child-health/objectives.
to promote appropriate screening, referral, and treatment are 
needed to reduce PDS among U.S. women.
PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based surveillance system 
that collects state-specific data on maternal attitudes and expe-
riences before, during, and soon after pregnancy among women 
who had a live birth during the preceding 2–9 months.† From 
year to year, PRAMS survey results are reported by varying 
numbers of states, New York City, and those areas of New York 
state outside of New York City (all of which, for simplicity, are 
referred to as “states” in this report).
For each reporting state, a monthly stratified PRAMS 
sample of 100–300 new mothers was selected systematically 
from birth certificates. States that met response rate thresholds 
for the three periods (≥70% for 2004, ≥65% for 2008, and 
≥60% for 2012) were included in this analysis; the thresholds 
reflect PRAMS data quality goals and changing operational

and general national survey response environments over time. 
The 2012 PRAMS sample represented 1,610,767 women from 
27 reporting states and 41% of U.S. births.
Self-reported PDS was ascertained through five responses 
(“always,” “often,” “sometimes,” “rarely,” and “never”) to the 
following two questions: 1) “Since your new baby was born, 
how often have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?” and 
 
2) “Since your new baby was born, how often have you had 
little interest or little pleasure in doing things?” Women 
responding “always” or “often” to either question were classi-
fied as experiencing PDS. In 2004 and 2008, these two ques-
tions were optional and included in 17 and 22 state surveys, 
respectively; in 2012, these questions were required for all 27 
participating PRAMS states.
Annual PDS prevalence estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated for all states with available data, for 
the 13 states with data for all three periods (Alaska, Colorado, 
Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, 
Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington) and 
for each individual reporting state. Combined and state-specific 
linear trends over time were assessed using logistic regression 
models that included birth year and state variables to account 
for baseline state-specific differences in prevalence. To estimate 
the average annual change in the prevalence of PDS during 
2004–2012, the percentage-point change was calculated using 
the beta coefficient of the infant’s birth year from the mod-
els. Associations between PDS and maternal characteristics 
(maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, num-
ber of previous live births, and postpartum smoking status), 
experiences (number of stressful life events experienced in the 
12 months before birth), and infant outcomes (gestational 
age and birthweight and infant neonatal intensive care unit 
[NICU] admission) were assessed with chi-square tests using 
2012 data. In addition, annual percentage-point changes in 
the prevalence of PDS during 2004–2012 were calculated 
by selected characteristics. Analyses were conducted using 
statistical software to account for the complex survey design. 
Differences with p-values of <0.05 were considered significant.
On average, the PRAMS surveys were completed 125 days 
after delivery (range = 60–270 days); timing of survey comple-
tion did not differ by PDS status. Among states with available 
data, the prevalence of self-reported PDS declined from 15.5% 
in 2004 to 13.6% in 2008 and to 11.5% in 2012 (linear trend 
p<0.01) (Figure) (Table 1). The overall decline was consistent 
with the changes among the 13 states with data for all three 
periods; PDS prevalence declined from 14.8% in 2004 to 
12.6% in 2008 to 9.8% in 2012 (linear trend p<0.01). The esti-
mated annual percentage-point change during 2004–2012 was 
-0.6% for all states and for the 13 states with data for all three 
periods (Table 1). Statistically significant declines in prevalence 
were observed in eight of 13 states (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, 
Hawaii, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah, and Washington). No 
statistically significant changes in prevalence were observed 
in five states (Maine, Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, and

Vermont); for three states (Maryland, Oregon, and Vermont), 
prevalence estimates decreased at each period, but did not reach 
statistical significance.
In 2012, the overall prevalence of PDS was 11.5%, 
representing 184,828 women with PDS in the 27 reporting 
states. In 2012, state-specific PDS ranged from 8.0% 
in Georgia to 20.1% in Arkansas (Table 1). In 2012, by 
selected characteristics, PDS prevalence was highest among 
the following: women who 1) were aged ≤19 years and 
20–24 years (age group), 2) were American Indian/Alaska 
Natives or Asian/Pacific Islanders (race/ethnicity), 3) had 
≤12 years of education (education level), 4) were unmarried 
(marital status), 5) were postpartum smokers (smoking status), 
6) had three or more stressful life events in the year before 
birth (number of stressful life events), 7) gave birth to term, 
low-birthweight infants (gestational age and weight), and 
 
8) had infants requiring NICU admission at birth (NICU 
status) (p<0.05 for all) (Table 2). Notably from 2004 to 2012, 
PDS prevalence did not significantly decline among American 
Indian/Alaska Native women and women with term, low-
birthweight infants (p>0.05), with PDS prevalence remaining 
above 17% in 2012.
Discussion
In this population-based sample of postpartum women, a 
decline in the prevalence of self-reported PDS was observed 
from 2004 to 2012 overall and in eight of the 13 states with 
data for all three periods. Postpartum depression is associated 
with adverse maternal, infant, and child outcomes, including 
lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and shorter duration 
(1), poor maternal and infant bonding (2), and infant devel-
opmental disorders (3). The specific etiology of postpartum 
depression is unknown; however, risk factors include depression 
during pregnancy, low social support, stressful life events dur-
ing pregnancy, preterm birth, and a traumatic birth experience 
(4). Contextual factors, such as the reduction in the birth rate 
of teens aged 15–19 years from 41.5 in 2007 to 24.2 per 1,000 
females in 2014 and reduction in the preterm birth rate from 
10.4% in 2007 to 9.5% in 2014 (5), reduction of women expe-
riencing self-reported stressful life events in the year preceding 
birth by 0.54 percentage points per year from 2000 to 2010 
(6), and an increase in antidepressant prescriptions to pregnant 
women from 0.7% in 2002–2006 to 2.1% in 2007–2010 (7) 
might have influenced the observed decline in PDS.
Postpartum depression is treatable with pharmacologic 
therapy and/or behavioral health interventions. However, 
depression is often underdiagnosed and untreated; nearly 60% 
of women with depressive symptoms do not receive a clinical 
diagnosis, and 50% of women with a diagnosis do not receive 
any treatment (8). Despite the observed decline, PDS remain

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) are common and are 
associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes (e.g., 
lower breastfeeding initiation and duration and poor maternal 
and infant bonding). Postpartum depression is treatable.
What is added by this report?
This report provides recent state-specific trends in self-reported 
PDS. Among the 13 states with data for all three periods (2004, 
2008, and 2012), self-reported prevalence of PDS declined from 
14.8% in 2004 to 9.8% in 2012. During 2004–2012, statistically 
significant declines were observed in eight of 13 states (Alaska, 
Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah, and 
Washington), and no statistically significant changes in 
prevalence were observed in five states (Maine, Maryland, 
Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont). In 2012, the overall PDS 
prevalence was 11.5% for 27 states.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Despite the observed decline, PDS remain common. A develop-
mental Healthy People 2020 objective is to decrease the 
proportion of women delivering a live birth who experience 
PDS. This report highlights the disparities in the prevalence of 
self-reported PDS by reporting state and subgroups of women. 
Ongoing surveillance and activities to promote universal 
screening followed by appropriate referral and treatment are 
needed to reduce PDS among U.S. women.

common, affecting 11.5% of new mothers in 2012, with 
prevalence varying by reporting state and subgroups of women. 
These findings underscore the need for universal screening and 
appropriate treatment for pregnant and postpartum women, 
as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists (ACOG) (4), the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) (9), and the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
Force.§ ACOG recommends that providers screen for depres-
sive symptoms at least once during pregnancy or postpar-
tum, using a validated screening tool (4). In addition, AAP 
§ https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/

recognizes that depression screening is part of family-centered 
well-child care, given pediatricians’ early access to the mother-
infant duo (9). Collaboration between obstetric and pediatric 
providers is recommended for symptomatic women identified 
during newborn care (4,9). Recent efforts to address maternal 
depression include extending postpartum Medicaid coverage 
for women, integration of behavioral health services within 
primary care, and provider reimbursement for postpartum 
depression screening at well-baby visits.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, PDS are self-reported and might not represent 
a clinical diagnosis of depression. The PRAMS PDS two-item 
screener is based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2.

These questions with similar categorization schemes have a 
sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 85%, compared with 
clinical assessments of major depressive episodes (10); thus, 
the results in this report might underestimate the true preva-
lence of postpartum depression. Second, data might not be 
generalizable to states not included in this analysis or preg-
nancies that did not result in a live birth. Finally, PRAMS 
has limited data on mental health treatment, including 
antidepressant use; thus, mental health treatment over time 
could not be assessed in this report.
PRAMS data can be used to monitor progress toward meet-
ing the Healthy People 2020 objective to decrease the proportion 
of women delivering a live birth who experience PDS. Despite 
the observed decline in prevalence, approximately one in nine 
women experience PDS, with higher prevalence in certain states 
and subgroups of women. Ongoing surveillance and activities to 
promote appropriate screening, referral, and treatment are needed

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; NICU = neonatal intensive care unit.
 * Included 13 states that had data for all three periods: Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, 
Vermont, and Washington.
 † State-specific linear trends were assessed using logistic regression models among states with all 3 periods using year of birth as the predictor.
 § Unadjusted average annual percentage-point change in prevalence within selected characteristic during 2004–2012 was calculated using the beta coefficient of 
the infant’s birth year from the linear model and the average percentage during 2004–2012.
 ¶ Average annual percentage-point change was not computed because linear trend was not significant.
 ** Vermont data do not include race/ethnicity, and were excluded from subgroup analysis.
 †† Preterm birth: <37 weeks’ gestation; Term, low birthweight: ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <2,500 g; Term, normal birthweight: ≥37 weeks’ gestation and ≥2,500 g.
