Background-—Being unmarried is associated with decreased survival in the general population. Whether married, divorced,
separated, widowed, or never-married status affects outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease has not been well
characterized.
Methods and Results-—A prospective cohort (inception period 2003–2015) of 6051 patients (mean age 63 years, 64% male, 23%
black) undergoing cardiac catheterization for suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease was followed for a median of
3.7 years (interquartile range: 1.7–6.7 years). Marital status was stratified as married (n=4088) versus unmarried (n=1963), which
included those who were never married (n=451), divorced or separated (n=842), or widowed (n=670). The relationship between
marital status and primary outcome of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction was examined using Cox regression models
adjusted for clinical characteristics. There were 1085 (18%) deaths from all causes, 688 (11%) cardiovascular-related deaths, and
272 (4.5%) incident myocardial infarction events. Compared with married participants, being unmarried was associated with higher
risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.47), cardiovascular death (HR: 1.45; 95% CI,
1.18–1.78), and cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (HR: 1.52; 95% CI, 1.27–1.83). Compared with married participants,
the increase in cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction was similar for the participants who were divorced or separated (HR:
1.41; 95% CI, 1.10–1.81), widowed (HR: 1.71; 95% CI, 1.32–2.20), or never married (HR: 1.40; 95% CI, 0.97–2.03). The findings
persisted after adjustment for medications and other socioeconomic factors.
Conclusions-—Marital status is independently associated with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or at high risk of
cardiovascular disease, with higher mortality in the unmarried population. The mechanisms responsible for this increased risk
require further study. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005890. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.005890.)
Key Words: cardiovascular disease • divorce • marital status • mortality • never married • socioeconomic position
• unmarried • widowed
D
ivorced individuals have increased all-cause mortality in
the
general population.
In contrast,
evidence for
increased
risk
of
adverse
cardiovascular
outcomes
in
unmarried populations remains conflicting.1–5 Although sur-
vival according to marital status has been reported in patients
presenting with acute coronary syndromes, few studies have
evaluated the relationship between adverse cardiovascular
outcomes and marital status in patients with known or
suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).6–8 In addition, the
definition of unmarried status is not always clear despite
noted differences in the divorced or separated, widowed, and
never-married groups.9–13 Va et al, for example, reported
higher all-cause mortality rates for divorced men and for
widowed or never-married women but not for never-married or
widowed men.12 To further investigate the impact of marital
status on cardiovascular outcomes, we analyzed the relation-
ship between marital status and adverse outcomes in patients
with known CAD or who were at high-risk for CAD. We
specifically examined outcomes of each unmarried group
(divorced or separated, widowed, and never married) with the
hypothesis that, compared with married patients, unmarried
patients will be at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular
outcomes.

 Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure.
Study Design
We enrolled 6051 participants in the Emory Cardiovascular
Biobank, a prospective cohort of patients who underwent
cardiac catheterization for suspected or known CAD at Emory
Healthcare hospitals between 2003 and 2015.14,15 Partici-
pants with severe valvular heart disease, congenital heart
disease, severe anemia, recent blood transfusion, myocarditis,
active
inflammatory
diseases,
and
active
cancer
were
excluded. Adults (aged >18 years) were interviewed to collect
information on demographic characteristics, medical history,
medication use, behavioral habits, and socioeconomic factors
including employment status and education level. Median
household income was defined by the 2009–2013 American
Community Survey 5-Year Estimates according to the ZIP
code of primary residence reported by study participants.16
Marital status was derived from a self-administered question-
naire at enrollment. Patients listed their marital status as
married, divorced, separated, widowed, or never married.
Divorced and separated statuses were combined into 1 group
for this analysis and will be referred to as the divorced/
separated group. Risk factor prevalence was determined by
physician diagnosis and/or treatment for hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, or diabetes mellitus. Smoking was classified
as nonsmoker or ever smoked if there was a lifetime history of
smoking at least 100 cigarettes. Medical records were
reviewed to confirm self-reported history of myocardial
infarction (MI). All coronary angiograms were scored for
luminal narrowing using a modified American Heart Associ-
ation/American
College
of
Cardiology
classification.17
Obstructive coronary artery disease was defined as the
presence of at least 1 major epicardial vessel with ≥50%
stenosis. After excluding individuals with <30 days of follow-
up or incomplete angiographic or questionnaire data, 6051
participants were eligible. The study was approved by the
institutional review board at Emory University. All participants
provided written informed consent.
Follow-up and Outcomes
Follow-up was conducted by telephone and medical chart
abstraction to determine adverse outcomes. The primary
outcome was the combined incidence of cardiovascular death
and MI, and the secondary outcomes included all-cause death
and cardiovascular death. Cardiovascular death was defined
as death attributable to an ischemic cardiovascular cause like
fatal MI, ischemic stroke, or sudden death secondary to
presumed cardiovascular cause in this high-risk CAD popula-
tion. Medical records were accessed or requested to validate
all self-reported events including MI, which was defined using
standard criteria, as described. The classification of events
and follow-up data was made on the basis of phone interview,
electronic medical record review, social security death index,
and state records. Adjudication was conducted by 3 indepen-
dent physicians who were blinded to the study.
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables are presented as mean�SD, and cate-
gorical variables are presented as proportion (percentage). The
Student t test, 1-way ANOVA, and the v2 test were used to
compare patient characteristics among marital status groups.
The Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test was performed on
nonnormally distributed variables. The relationship between
marital status and outcomes was determined using Cox
proportional hazards regression in models (using age as the
time scale) adjusted for sex, race (black versus nonblack),
diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low- and high-
density lipoprotein levels, heart failure, history of MI, estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; calculated using the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation), body
mass index, obstructive coronary artery disease, smoking
history, medications (statins, aspirin, beta blockers, angion-
tensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors), education (dichotomized by college degree), and
employment status (employed versus not employed).
For outcomes including all-cause death, cardiovascular
death, and MI, we used the Fine and Gray competing risk
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Being unmarried is associated with adverse cardiovascular
outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.
• This study is the first to show adverse outcomes in separate
unmarried groups (divorced or separated, widowed, and
never married).
• The increased risk of cardiovascular events remained
significant even after extensive adjustment for clinical
characteristics including coronary artery disease severity,
socioeconomic risk factors, and medication use.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Individuals with coronary artery disease who are at high risk
for adverse cardiovascular outcomes should be identified.
• Further investigation is needed to determine whether more
aggressive treatment strategies can positively alter out-
comes for unmarried patients.

 analysis and reported subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) by
treating noncardiovascular death and all-cause death as
competing risk events.
The first model included only characteristics to evaluate
clinical outcomes. Model 2 included all variables in Model 1
and the dichotomous marital status. Model 3 was similar to
model 2, with marital status further divided into unmarried,
divorced/separated, widowed, and never married. Models 4
and 5 were similar to model 2 with the addition of medication
prescriptions and socioeconomic factors (employment status
and college education), respectively.
Sensitivity analyses were performed in models to examine
interactions among marital status, outcomes, and each of the
following: age, sex, race, and employment. We checked the
proportional hazards assumption (by testing time–covariate
interactions) and covariate functional forms for all the final
Cox models and found no significant violations. Analyses were
performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R 3.2.2.18
P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Population
Baseline characteristics of the 6051 participants (aged
63�11 years) are shown in Table 1. The cohort was 64%
male and 23% black (Table 1). Obstructive CAD was present
in 4256 (70.3%) participants, and 490 (8%) participants
presented with acute MI. More than two thirds of participants
(n=4088, 68%) were married, 842 (14%) were divorced or
separated, 670 (11%) were widowed, and 451 (7%) were never
married.
Comparison of Married and Unmarried
Participants
Unmarried participants were more likely to be female and
black; less likely to be smokers; and more likely to have
hypertension, heart failure, reduced eGFR, or elevated low- or
high-density lipoprotein levels compared with the married
cohort. Married participants were more likely to have been
prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or
angiotensin receptor blocker, aspirin, statin, or clopidogrel
(Table 1). In multivariable analyses stratified by sex, marriage
for men was associated with older age, being white, higher
body mass index, and lower prevalence of hypertension and
heart failure. In women, being married was associated only
with younger age and white race (Table 2).
During a median follow-up period of 3.7 years (interquartile
range: 1.7–6.7 years), there were 1085 (18%) deaths from all
causes, 688 (11%) cardiovascular-related deaths, and 272
(4.5%) incident MI events (Table 1, Figure 1). In a Cox
proportional hazards regression model that included all
cardiovascular risk factors, significant predictors of all-cause
mortality were body mass index, heart failure history, diabetes
mellitus, current or prior smoking, obstructive CAD, and eGFR
(Table 3, Model 1). The same factors and black race were
independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality and the
combined outcome of cardiovascular death or MI.
All-cause and cardiovascular mortality as well as the
combined cardiovascular death/MI rates were higher in
unmarried participants compared with married participants
(Table 1). In a Cox regression model that included all
aforementioned risk factors, the unmarried group compared
with the married group had HRs of 1.24 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.06–1.47) for all-cause mortality, 1.45 (95% CI,
1.18–1.78) for cardiovascular death, and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.27–
1.83) for cardiovascular death/MI (Table 3, Figure 1). The
association between marital status and adverse outcomes
remained significant after adjusting for socioeconomic status
(employment and education) and medications (Table 3).
Similar to the rates observed in the entire unmarried
population, cardiovascular death and cardiovascular death/
MI were higher in each of the unmarried subgroups of
divorced/separated, widowed, and never-married partici-
pants, without significant interaction among these 3 groups
(P>0.05
for
interaction),
although
the
association
was
stronger in the widowed group.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine whether age,
sex, race, or unmarried subgroups affected the association
between marital status and outcomes. We found no interac-
tion between marital status and cardiovascular death or
cardiovascular death/MI with respect to age, sex, or race.
However, there was a significant interaction among age,
marital status, and all-cause death (interaction, P=0.04).
Notably, unmarried participants aged <65 years (n=1072)
experienced higher risk of all-cause death (HR: 1.43; 95% CI,
1.09–1.89), whereas unmarried status was not associated
with all-cause death (sHR: 0.99; 95% CI, 0.79–1.24) in
participants aged ≥65 years (n=891).
Comparison of Married and Divorced or
Separated Participants
Compared with married participants, divorced or separated
participants were more likely to be younger, female, and
black; to have higher low- and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels; and to be diagnosed with hypertension,
obstructive CAD, or heart failure (Table 1).
Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for
the aforementioned covariates demonstrated that, compared

 with married participants, divorced or separated participants
had a nonsignificant increased risk of all-cause death (HR:
1.23; 95% CI, 0.98–1.55) and cardiovascular death (sHR:
1.27; 95% CI, 0.95–1.69) and a significant increased risk of
cardiovascular death/MI (sHR: 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10–1.81;
Table 3, Figure 2).
Comparison of Married and Widowed Participants
Compared with married participants, widowed participants
were more likely to be older, female, and black and have
reduced eGFR and a history of hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, obstructive CAD, heart failure, presentation with
acute MI, or higher high-density lipoprotein level (Table 1).
Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for
the aforementioned covariates demonstrated that, compared
with
married
participants,
widowed
participants
had
a
nonsignificant increased risk of all-cause death (HR: 1.24;
95% CI, 0.99–1.54) but a significant increased risk of
cardiovascular death (sHR: 1.62; 95% CI, 1.23–2.13), and
cardiovascular death/MI (sHR: 1.71; 95% CI, 1.32–2.20).
Comparison of Married and Never-Married
Participants
Compared with married participants, those who never married
were more likely to be younger, female, and black; to have
lower rates of smoking and obstructive CAD; and to have
higher body mass index, high-density lipoprotein and eGFR
levels, and greater prevalence of heart failure (Table 1).
Cox regression models adjusting for the aforementioned
covariates demonstrated that, compared with married partic-
ipants,
never-married
individuals
had
a
nonsignificant
increased risk of all-cause death (HR: 1.28; 95% CI, 0.92–
1.79), cardiovascular death (sHR: 1.47; 95% CI, 0.98–2.21),
and cardiovascular death/MI (sHR: 1.40; 95% CI, 0.97–2.03;
Table 3, Figure 2).
Discussion
In this article, we described the association between marital
status and adverse outcomes in a patient population at high
risk for CAD or with known CAD. This study is the first, to our
knowledge, to evaluate hard cardiovascular disease outcomes
in separate unmarried groups in a high-risk cardiovascular
disease population, with extensive adjustment for clinical
characteristics including CAD severity and socioeconomic
risk factors. Compared with married participants, we found
that unmarried individuals had 45% higher rates of cardio-
vascular death and 52% higher cardiovascular death/MI.
Adverse cardiovascular outcomes were higher in each of the
unmarried subgroups of divorced/separated, widowed, and

 never-married participants, similar to the rates observed in
the entire unmarried population. The findings persisted after
adjustment for medication prescriptions and socioeconomic
risk factors, including employment and education.
A study performed 2 decades ago in patients undergoing
bypass surgery reported that married patients were 2.5 times
more likely to be alive after 15 years compared with
unmarried patients.6 A more recent study in patients under-
going
percutaneous
revascularization
also
demonstrated
higher cardiovascular event rates in unmarried patients
compared with married patients.7 Although these studies
are in agreement with our findings, which were obtained from
a wide spectrum of patients who had CAD or were at high risk
for CAD, our study further examined outcomes in never-
married, widowed, and divorced/separated groups.
Divorce portends a worse prognosis compared with the

suggests that divorced individuals experience increased
cardiovascular events and mortality, although these data are
conflicting.2,4,9,22–24 For example, in men without known CAD
but with above-average risk factor prevalence, increased
mortality was observed in divorced individuals, but in a study

 of individuals with no prior history of CAD, divorce was not
associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.2,22 We
found an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality and MI in
divorced or separated participants compared with the married
group, even after extensive adjustment for covariates. The
mechanisms underlying the adverse prognosis in divorced
individuals are not completely understood. Studies have
demonstrated that remarriage may attenuate the increased
risk observed after divorce, suggesting that immediate
emotional and financial aspects of divorce play a smaller role
than the long-term effects of remaining divorced.25 A lack of
social support has also been hypothesized to worsen
outcomes after divorce.26 Unhappy marriages, which likely
have lower levels of social support, are associated with poor
outcomes compared with happily married couples.27 Similarly,
divorce has been associated with worse outcomes compared
with never marrying, suggesting that the acute stress of
divorce may play a role in adverse outcomes.28 It is also
possible that individuals remain unmarried because of
psychosocial factors that put them at greater risk for CAD.29
Widowhood has been previously associated with increased
risk of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality.9,12,30,31
Our study confirms this increased cardiovascular mortality
risk in widowed compared with married individuals in a
population with CAD, even after adjustment for covariates.
Proposed explanations for this disparity include living alone
and reduced social support.32
Data on never-married individuals and outcomes are limited.
A population-based study of men and women in Japan found a
significant increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in
men and an increase in all-cause mortality in women who had
never married compared with the married group.2 Other studies
have demonstrated conflicting results.10,13,24 In the present
study, we found an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality in
the never-married cohort similar to the other unmarried groups.
Although it did not reach statistical significance, the rate
observed in the never-married group was not different from the
entire unmarried population, without significant interaction
among the 3 unmarried groups. The increased risk may be due
to lack of social support or self-selection of never-married

 individuals due to poor socioeconomic and psychosocial status.
Although the never-married cohort was much youngerand had a
higher prevalence of smoking, the baseline risk factor profile did
not differ significantly from the divorced/separated or widowed
groups.
We demonstrated a significant interaction between age
and all-cause mortality in the unmarried group, but no
interaction was found with cardiovascular death or cardio-
vascular death/MI. Younger (aged <65 years) unmarried
individuals were at higher risk for all-cause mortality than
those aged ≥65 years, although the rates of cardiovascular
death or cardiovascular death/MI were higher in unmarried
individuals regardless of age.
Prior studies evaluating the effect of sex on cardiovascular
outcomes in divorced individuals are conflicting. A large meta-
analysis of 29 studies found that, compared with the married
group, all-cause mortality was higher for both divorced men
and women, with minimal difference between groups.19 Other
studies have reported that either men are at higher risk after
divorce than their female counterparts2,24,33 or that divorced
women have higher risk compared with men.4,5 In the present
study, there was no interaction between sex and outcomes in
the unmarried groups.
The association between unmarried status and adverse
cardiovascular events persisted after adjustment for medica-
tions and socioeconomic factors including education and
employment status, suggesting that additional factors play a
role in the disparity faced by unmarried individuals. Lifestyle
and medication adherence are positively influenced by being
married. Lack of social support, a more sedentary lifestyle,
and lack of motivation to be receptive to lifestyle changes and
to follow prescriptions are potential explanations for the
association between being unmarried and nonadherence34;
however, adherence—a likely confounder—was not captured
in this database.
The strengths of our study include its large sample size, a
diverse multiethnic population, adequate representation of
both sexes and black and white races, detailed delineation of
CAD status, and careful long-term follow-up. To our knowl-
edge, this study is the first to demonstrate an association
between marital status and all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality in a high-risk cardiovascular patient population.
Limitations include the retrospective analysis, single-center
study, and lack of follow-up regarding continued marital
status. However, studies evaluating the effects of remarriage
on outcomes are conflicting, and our mean follow-up of
3 years indicates that few participants are likely to have had a
change in marital status.23,25,35 Our cohort is not represen-
tative of the general population without CVD, and thus our
results are not generalizable. Finally, we do not have
information regarding the temporal relationship between the
duration from divorce or widowhood and enrollment, and
cohabitation was not captured in this data set.3,5
Conclusions
Unmarried patients with known or suspected CAD have an
increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
compared with married individuals, even after extensive
adjustment for differences in demographic and cardiovascular
risk factors. The risk of adverse outcomes was attenuated
with age. Accounting for unmarried status in the management
of patients with CAD, consideration of associated psycholog-
ical conditions, and potentially more aggressive follow-up and
therapy need to be considered in future studies.
