Abstract 
Objective. The aim was to test if adverse effects of preterm birth on attention and academic abilities 
at age 8 years are mediated by children’s inhibitory control abilities. 
Study design. 558 children born at 26-41 weeks gestation were studied as part of a prospective 
geographically defined longitudinal investigation in Germany. Toddlers’ inhibitory control abilities 
were observed at age 20 months. At 8 years, attention and academic abilities were assessed.  
Results. The lower children’s gestational age, the lower their inhibitory control and the more likely 
they had poor attention regulation and low academic achievement. Adverse effects of preterm birth 
on attention and academic outcomes were partially mediated by toddlers’ inhibitory control abilities. 
Conclusion. These findings of early inhibitory control abilities provide new information about the 
mechanisms linking preterm birth with long-term attention difficulties and academic 
underachievement.

Preterm birth increases the risk for attention difficulties [1-4] as well as long-term academic 
underachievement [3, 5, 6]. Studies have suggested that early self-control abilities (e.g. inhibitory or 
effortful control) may mediate effects of preterm birth on cognitive outcomes [7, 8] and later 
achievement [9, 10]. Inhibitory control predicts the development of the executive attention network 
[11] and is related to children’s executive functions (EFs), high-level cognitive abilities that allow 
humans to show adaptive, goal-directed behavior in complex situations [12]. In an ever-changing and 
unpredictable environment, EFs, and self-control in particular, are not only vital to master real-life 
situations but also predict long-term academic achievement [13-15]. 
One highly reliable indicator of early self-control is an individual’s ability to inhibit undesirable 
behaviors, e. g., wait for a treat instead of instantly grabbing it [16]. The inhibition of such behaviors 
that are driven by emotions has been coined “hot” effortful control. Children’s performance in such 
emotionally valenced inhibitory tasks assessing has been shown to predict life-long academic 
attainment and achievement outcomes, even after controlling for cognitive ability and 
socioeconomic status [17-19].  
Few studies on preterm children have specifically addressed potential links between low gestational 
age at birth, early self-control, and long-term outcomes [20]. A recent study suggested that inhibitory 
control might predict learning and attention regulation abilities at age six years in preterm children 
[21]. Others have shown that very preterm children have problems with inhibitory control [8] and 
that these may be associated with delay of frustration as well as attention and behavior problems in 
preadolescence [22]. Unknown is whether there is a dose-response effect of low gestational age at 
birth on inhibitory control in toddlers. If this is the case, inhibitory control abilities may be a 
functional indicator of the effects of preterm birth on the pathway to later attention and academic 
outcomes.  
The aim of the current study was to test in a large sample of children born across the whole 
spectrum of gestation whether (1) there are differences in early inhibitory control according to 
gestational age at birth (GA), and (2) whether adverse effects of preterm birth on attention 
 4 
 
regulation and academic achievement at age 8 years are mediated by children’s inhibitory control 
abilities using structural equation modeling. We hypothesized that (1) gestational age at birth would 
directly  and positively predict inhibitory control at corrected age 20 months and attention regulation 
and academic achievement abilities at age 8 years while (2) inhibitory control would also directly and 
positively predict attention regulation and academic achievement, and (3) the impact of gestational 
age at birth on later outcomes would be mediated by children’s ability to inhibit undesirable 
behaviors, after statistically controlling for potential confounders (i.e., child sex, neonatal medical 
risk, and family socioeconomic status at birth). 
 
Methods 
Participants 
Data were collected as part of the prospective Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS)[23]. The BLS is a 
geographically defined whole-population sample of neonatal at-risk children born in Southern 
Bavaria (Germany) between January 1985 and March 1986 who required admission to a children's 
hospital within the first 10 days of life (N=7505; 10.6% of all live births). Additionally, 916 healthy 
term control infants (normal postnatal care) were identified at birth from the same hospitals in 
Bavaria during the same period. Of the initial sample, n=393 children born between 25 and 38 weeks 
of gestation (randomly drawn within the stratification factors gender, socio-economic background 
and degree of neonatal risk) and n=165 healthy full-term (39-41 weeks GA) control children were 
assessed at corrected age 20 months and again at age 8 years. Full details of the sampling criteria and 
dropout rates are provided elsewhere [23]. Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the final 
sample according to their GA group status (N=558).

Procedure 
Participating parents were approached within 48 hours of the infant’s hospital admission and were 
included in the study once they had given written consent for their child to participate. Toddlers’ 
 5 
 
inhibitory control abilities were assessed at 20 months of age corrected for prematurity. At age 8 
years, participating children and their mothers were assessed by an interdisciplinary study team for 
one whole day including neurological assessments (conducted by pediatricians), parent interviews 
(conducted by psychologists), cognitive assessments and behavior ratings (administered by 
psychological assistants and the whole team). All raters and assessors were blind to preterm birth 
status of participating children. Ethical permission for the study was granted by the Ethics committee 
of the University of Munich Children’s Hospital and the Bavarian Health Council (Landesärztekammer 
Bayern).  
Measures 
Gestational age (GA) groups. Gestational age at birth was determined from maternal reports of the 
last menstrual period and serial ultrasounds during pregnancy. Children were summarized into five 
GA groups (very preterm: <32 weeks GA; moderately preterm: 32-33 weeks GA; late preterm: 34-36 
weeks GA; early term: 37-38 weeks GA; full term 39-41 weeks GA) in order to make findings 
comparable to other studies [24, 25]. 
Neonatal medical risk. Infant postnatal complications were assessed with a comprehensive 
optimality index including 21 items (e.g. intubation, severe anaemia, cerebral haemorrhage) [26]. 
Family socioeconomic status (SES) at birth. Information was collected through structured parental 
interviews and computed as a weighted composite score derived from the occupation of the self-
identified head of each family (usually the father) together with the highest educational qualification 
held by either parent [27] into three pre-defined categories of low, medium, and high SES. 
Inhibitory control task. At corrected age 20 months, children’s inhibitory control abilities were 
assessed with a standardized behavioral observation task. At the start of the Raisin Game toddlers 
were presented with a raisin that was placed under an opaque cup within easy reach. After three 
training runs during which eating the raisin was allowed after short but increasing time intervals 
(instant eating, then five and ten seconds waiting time) the actual test run started. Toddlers were 
 6 
 
asked to wait for 60 seconds before they could touch and eat the raisin. Waiting time until toddlers 
touched the raisins was measured with a stopwatch and coded into three categories of inhibitory 
control abilities: 1=did not wait or waited up to 10 sec (37%), 2=waited between 11 and 59 sec (39%), 
3= waited for 60 sec (24%). This categorization was chosen for two reasons, firstly, because 
participants were roughly equally distributed across the three groups, secondly, because the cut-offs 
marked a meaningful differentiation of inhibitory behavior (i.e., considering normative reaction times 
at age 20 months, waiting < 10 sec was classified as not waiting whereas waiting for the entire task 
interval of 60 sec indicated excellent inhibitory control, toddlers who waited between 11 and 59 sec 
were classified as intermediate). 
Attention regulation at age 8 years. Firstly, child behavior during a challenging cognitive assessment 
lasting 1 h 20 min was evaluated by psychologists with the Tester’s Rating of Child Behavior (TRCB) 
Task Orientation index scale (Cronbach’s α =.85; subscale inter-rater reliabilities ICC (intra-class 
correlation coefficient) =.63 to .97) [3]. Secondly, child attention across the whole assessment day 
was evaluated as a consensus rating by the whole research team (TEAM rating of psychologist, 
assistant psychologist, and pediatrician, α =.98) [3]. These two attention ratings correlated highly 
with each other (r=.62, p<0.01) and were thus z-scored and combined into a single scale of attention 
regulation. Thirdly, mothers’ rated their children’s attention problems as part of the Child Behavior 
Checklist (CBCL)[28]. 
Academic achievement: mathematic, reading, and spelling/writing abilities at age 8 years. 
Achievement was assessed with standardized tests. Numerical representations and reasoning were 
measured with a comprehensive mathematic test [29, 30]. Test tasks were presented to children in 
book form with 79 items assessing numerical estimations, calculation, reasoning, and mental rotation 
abilities. Item responses were scored for accuracy, and subscale scores were summed into a total 
Mathematic Test Score. Children’s reading abilities were measured with the Zürich Reading Test [31] 
and a pseudo-word reading test [32, 33]. Total scores (based on number of errors) correlated highly 
with each other (r=.74, p<0.001) and were thus combined to create a single, composite Reading Test 
 7 
 
Score. Spelling and writing were assessed with a standard diagnostic test (DRT 2) [34]. Test scores 
were z-standardized according to the healthy full-term control children’s scores within the sample 
[35]. 
Analytic Approach. Data were analyzed with SPSS 22 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and Mplus 7 (Los 
Angeles, CA: Muthén & Muthén). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to test the direct and 
indirect effects of the categorical variables GA group and inhibitory control on the latent variables 
attention regulation (combined TRCB and TEAM rating of attention regulation and mother rating of 
attention problems (CBCL, reverse coded to be entered into the SEM model)) and academic 
achievement (maths, reading, and writing/spelling tests) abilities at age 8 years. In addition, child sex, 
neonatal medical risk, and family SES were included as potential confounding variables. 
Subsequently, we explored whether the effects of early inhibitory control on childhood outcomes 
were explained by toddlers’ cognitive abilities, assessed with the Griffiths Mental Development 
Scales [36] at 20 months of corrected age. 
 
Results 
Descriptive results showed that children of lower GA groups showed, on average, lower inhibitory 
control at corrected age 20 months and lower attention regulation and academic achievement 
abilities at age 8 years (Table 1). Supporting our first hypothesis preterm birth negatively affected 
children’s inhibitory control abilities (B=.25, 95% CI [.11, .39]) and directly predicted low attention 
regulation (B=.23, 95% CI [.07, .38]) and academic achievement (B=.10, 95% CI [.03, .17]) after 
controlling for all other factors (Table 2 and Figure 1). Our second hypothesis was also supported as a 
higher ability to inhibit unwanted behaviors predicted better attention regulation (B=.24, 95% CI [.07, 
.41]) and academic achievement (B=.10, 95% CI [.03, .17]). In other words, one unit of change in 
inhibitory control (e.g., from “waited between 11 and 59 sec” to “waited for 60 sec”) predicted a 0.25 
standard deviation (SD) change in the attention latent factor scores and a 0.19 SD change in 
academic achievement scores. Moreover, adverse effects of preterm birth on later outcomes were 
 8 
 
partly mediated by children’s early inhibitory control abilities (indirect effects: B=.06, 95% CI [.01, 
.11] and B=.03, 95% CI [.00, .05], respectively), thus supporting our third hypothesis. In addition to 
these main effects, being born female predicted better inhibitory control and attention regulation 
abilities. Children of high vs. medium/low SES had better better inhibitory control, attention 
regulation and academic scores (see Table 2). Neonatal medical risk had no statistically significant 
effect on toddlers’ inhibitory control abilities and was dropped from the final SEM model in order to 
increase model fit. Overall, the model explained 32% of the variance in children’s attention 
regulation, 20% of the variance in academic achievement, and 10% of the variance in early inhibitory 
control abilities, respectively. Fit values indicated good statistical model fit (χ²/df=33.85/42; p=.013; 
CFI=.979; RMSEA=.040). 
- Insert Table 2 and Figure 1 here – 
Finally, we explored whether the effects of early inhibitory control on childhood outcomes were 
explained by toddlers’ cognitive abilities. While this was not the case, including cognition into the 
model did not significantly increase the percentage of explained variance or improve model fit, thus 
for reasons of statistical sparseness as well as clarity we dropped cognition from the model. 
Discussion 
This study found that preterm birth negatively affects toddlers’ abilities to inhibit undesirable 
behaviors as well as later attention regulation and academic achievement. Better inhibitory control 
at age 20 months predicted better attention regulation and academic achievement at age 8 years. 
Most importantly, adverse effects of preterm birth on later outcomes were partly mediated by 
children’s early inhibitory control abilities after statistically controlling for child sex and family SES. 
Resistance to temptation (i.e., inhibitory control) is a relatively stable individual characteristic that 
predicts neural activation in fronto-striatal circuitries that integrate motivational and self-control 
processes [37]. Previous studies showed that preterm children have difficulties with inhibitory 
control [8] and that these predict later learning and attention problems [21, 22]. Our results suggest 
a dose-response effect of low gestational age at birth on inhibitory control across the whole GA 
 9 
 
spectrum. This new finding of a link between GA, inhibitory control, and later outcomes may 
represent an important new piece in the puzzle of life-course underachievement after preterm birth. 
Firstly, an easy 5 min Raisin Game task represents a promising new tool for follow-up assessments 
after preterm birth. Secondly, the results of this study suggest potential innovative avenue to 
intervention. Early childhood trainings enhancing self-control may help alleviate long-term 
achievement problems [38] and research on normal population samples has shown that executive 
function abilities including self-control can be trained [39]. According to Rose’s public health-oriented 
approach to preventive medicine shifting the population distribution of a risk factor (i.e. low self-
control) prevents more overall burden of disease than targeting only individual people at high risk 
[40]. However, preterm children may not only have lower inhibitory control abilities than full term 
children but may also be more vulnerable to environmental influences further decreasing their 
abilities to inhibit undesirable responses [41, 42]. As our findings apply to the whole GA spectrum of 
preterm and full term children, it may thus be recommended to adopt a combination of both 
population and targeted approaches to interventions in order to achieve the highest benefits [43]. 
It has previously been reported that the relationship between gestational age and academic 
outcomes is not linear but curvilinear with increasingly stronger effects below 33-36 weeks [25, 35, 
44, 45] thus we explored this possibility. Results, however, showed that effects of preterm birth on 
early inhibition and effects of inhibition on later outcomes were overall not stronger in the more 
preterm compared with the term groups. 
Strengths and limitations. This is the first study to our knowledge that assessed the links between 
preterm birth, early inhibitory control, and later achievement longitudinally in a large sample of 
children across the whole GA range. Children’s abilities were assessed by independent raters that 
were blind to GA group membership. As a direct and standardized measure of early human self-
control behavior, the Raisin Game is not only more reliable and objective than questionnaires [16], it 
also has higher ecological validity than many other experimental paradigms. Such tasks have 
however been criticized as longer waiting times may not always indicate that a child exerted higher 
 10 
 
self-control but also that he or she was simply less tempted by the treat (i.e., raisin) [16] or too shy to 
reach for the cup. Individual children's preferences and situational affects may have influenced their 
inhibitory control abilities, i.e., waiting times. We used only one task to measure inhibitory control 
whereas the use of multiple behavioral tasks assessing different aspects of the underlying construct 
of inhibition could have improved the reliability of results. Furthermore, for research as well as 
clinical practice, one could initially offer a selection of different treats (e.g., raisin, chocolate, 
marshmallow, nibbles) to children and let them choose one in order to overcome individual 
preferences. Our participants were 20 months old when the task was administered. This is a very 
young age to test inhibitory control and toddlers were given two training runs to allow them to 
understand the concept of the “game” they were asked to participate in; these training runs may 
have positively influenced our participants’ inhibitory control abilities. An additional pitfall of the task 
was that although behavioral inhibition (i.e., waiting time) was measured in seconds as a continuous 
variable it was not normally distributed in our sample (ceiling effects as 24% of toddlers waited a 
whole minute to touch and eat the raisin). As a result, we used a trichotomized variable. One may 
suggest an operationalization that is more tailored to children’s ages and abilities (i.e. allow longer 
waiting times) in future studies. 
Moreover, we controlled for a number of confounding variables and found that neonatal medical risk 
and treatment (including surgeries) were not related to toddlers’ inhibitory control abilities in our 
sample. Preterm individuals often have general cognitive impairments [35, 44, 46] and these are 
associated with their academic outcomes. Although the relationship between cognitive abilities and 
achievement was not the focus of this study, we explored whether the effects of early inhibitory 
control on childhood outcomes were explained by toddlers’ cognitive abilities, assessed with the 
Griffiths Mental Development Scales [36] at 20 months of corrected age. This alternative model 
showed that the effects of inhibitory control on later attention and achievement were significant 
over and above the effects of cognitive abilities; for reasons of statistical sparseness as well as clarity 
we thus decided to drop cognition from the model.

Conclusion. Adverse effects of preterm birth on later attention regulation and academic achievement 
are partially mediated by children’s early inhibitory control abilities. These findings provide new 
information about the mechanisms linking preterm birth with long-term attention difficulties and 
academic underachievement. The Raisin Game is an easy and effective tool that has good face-
validity assessing inhibitory control in young children, takes only five minutes and can be used in 
clinical practice for routine follow-up assessments after preterm birth in order to identify children at 
risk of attention and learning problems. Executive function abilities can be trained [39] – thus our 
findings provide potential avenues to interventions aimed at increasing preterm children’s long-term 
achievement.
