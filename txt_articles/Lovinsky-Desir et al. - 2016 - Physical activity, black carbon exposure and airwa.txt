Abstract
Objective—Regular physical activity can improve cardiopulmonary health; however, increased 
respiratory rates and tidal volumes during activity may increase the effective internal dose of air 
pollution exposure. Our objective was to investigate the impact of black carbon (BC) measured by 
personal sampler on the relationship between physical activity and fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
(FeNO), a marker of airway inflammation. We hypothesized that higher personal BC would 
attenuate the protective effect of physical activity on airway inflammation.
Methods—We performed a cross-sectional study nested in a birth cohort of African American 
and Dominican children living in the Bronx and Northern Manhattan, New York City. Children 
were recruited based on age (target 9-14 year olds) and presence (n=70) or absence (n=59) of 
current asthma. Children wore wrist mounted accelerometers for 6 days and were classified as 
‘active’ if they had ≥60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVA) each day and ‘non-
active’ if they had <60 minutes of MVA on any given day, based on CDC guidelines. Personal BC 
measured using a MicroAeth, was assessed during two 24-hour periods, at the beginning and end 
of physical activity assessment. High BC was defined as the upper tertile of BC measured with 
personal sampler. FeNO measurements were sampled at the beginning and end of the of physical 
activity assessment.
Results—In multivariable linear regression models, ‘active’ children had 25% higher personal 
BC concentrations (p=0.02) and 20% lower FeNO (p=0.04) compared to ‘non-active’ children. 
Among children with high personal BC (n=33), there was no relationship between activity and 
FeNO (p=1.00). The significant protective relationship between activity and airway inflammation 
was largely driven by children with lower personal BC (n=96, p=0.04).
Conclusions—Children that live in an urban environment and are physically active on a daily 
basis have higher personal exposure to BC. High BC offsets the protective relationship between 
physical activity and airway inflammation.

1. Introduction
Physical activity provides numerous health benefits, including improved metabolic and 
cardiopulmonary health (Strong et al., 2005). The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) recommend that children participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate or 
vigorous physical activity daily with at least 3 days a week of vigorous activity (Strong et 
al., 2005). However, increased respiratory rates and tidal volumes during physical activity 
may increase the effective internal dose of air pollution exposure (Oravisjarvi et al., 2011).

 This could be especially critical in urban environments where options for physical activity 
may occur near sources of higher traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) due to the structure of 
the built environment (Council on Sports et al., 2006). However, very little research to date 
has addressed the link in children between regular physical activity and pollutant exposures 
in urban environments.
Exposure to TRAP is associated with wheeze, cough, respiratory symptoms (Spira-Cohen et 
al., 2011) and childhood asthma (McConnell et al., 2006). Of particular interest is, black 
carbon (BC), a major indicator of TRAP exposure in urban cities and a contributor to global 
warming (Wallack and Ramanathan, 2009) that results from incomplete combustion of fossil 
fuels, biofuels, and biomass. BC exposure has been associated with increased airway 
inflammation in children living in urban environments (Cornell et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2011). 
In contrast, the well-established biomarker of allergic airway inflammation, fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (Dweik et al., 2011), has been shown to be reduced in response 
to physical activity (Mendes et al., 2011). Thus, it is important to better understand the 
balance between the benefits of regular physical activity in children the potential harm from 
exposure to ambient pollutants in urban environments.
Our objective was to determine the impact of personal exposure to the pollutant BC on the 
relationship between physical activity and airway inflammation. First, we hypothesized that 
active children that live in an urban environment would have greater exposure to BC, 
measured with personal sampler. Second, we hypothesized that higher personal BC exposure 
may reduce the magnitude of protection induced by physical activity on airway 
inflammation. Our approach was to investigate children ages 9-14 years that live in Northern 
Manhattan and the Bronx, NYC in a nested study that is part of a longitudinal birth cohort.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study population
Study participants (n=163) were recruited from the Columbia Center for Children's 
Environmental Health (CCCEH) longitudinal birth cohort comprised of children living in 
Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx of NYC, whose non-smoking, African American 
and Dominican mothers were enrolled during pregnancy (Perera et al., 2003). As part of the 
research design for the nested cross-sectional ‘parent study’, participants were recruited 
based on age (9-14 year olds) and current asthma diagnosis (Lovinsky-Desir et al., 2014). 
Asthma was determined by physician diagnosis during at least one cohort study visit 
between ages 5-12 years (Donohue et al., 2013) and report of asthma symptoms or asthma 
medication use in the 12 months prior to enrollment.
Children with body mass index (BMI) ≥ the 95th percentile for age and sex were classified 
as ‘obese’. Children were recruited across all 4 meteorological seasons. Complete data on 
physical activity, personal BC measures, FeNO and allergic sensitization (an important 
covariate for examination of FeNO) was available for n=129 children that were included in 
this study (figure 1). The longitudinal birth cohort study is conducted in accordance with 
Columbia University Institutional Review Board guidelines and informed consents and 
assents were obtained.

 2.2. Physical activity assessment
All study participants wore an accelerometer (Actical, Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) 
continuously on the non-dominant wrist for 6 consecutive days (figure 2) and integrated 
measures of gross motor activity were measured in 1-minute epochs. Data collection began 
and ended on a weekday in order to capture both weekday and weekend activity. To account 
for having collected only partial activity data on the first and last days we used only the 5 
intervening consecutive days with full 24-hours of data for characterization of physical 
activity (Rundle et al., 2009).
Physical activity was characterized based on the CDC recommendation that children 
participate in 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVA=moderate
+vigorous activity) each day and vigorous activity (VA) on at least 3 days per week (http://
www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/children.html). Using the continuous 
accelerometer data, we characterized children into 3 groups: 1) ‘MVA+VA’ if they had ≥60 
minutes of MVA each day and ≥10 minutes of VA on at least 3 days, 2) ‘MVA only’ if they 
had ≥60 minutes of MVA each day but did not have ≥10 minutes of VA on at least 3 days, 
and 3) ‘non-active’ if they had <60 minutes of MVA on any one day. In multivariable linear 
regression models, due to the smaller sample sizes in the 2 active groups, we combined the 
MVA+VA and MVA only groups, yielding a dichotomized predictor variable, ‘active’ versus 
‘non-active’.
2.3. Personal black carbon (BC) monitoring
Personal exposure to BC was measured over two 24-hour periods at the beginning and end 
of the 6-day activity-monitoring period (figure 2). Children carried a MicroAeth (Model 
AE51, Magee Scientific, Berkley, CA) inside a vest pocket that contained an air inlet in the 
breathing zone (vest collar) (Cai et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2014). Children were instructed to 
remove the vest during vigorous activity and to keep it nearby and uncovered. Every 5-
minute data were averaged to yield a mean 24-hour exposure assessment. We previously 
have demonstrated excellent compliance with wearing the BC monitoring equipment in this 
age group (Lovinsky-Desir et al., 2014). In addition, MVA did not vary significantly 
between days in which the vest was worn and was not worn (Signed rank test, p=0.40).
BC data were cleaned according to algorithms developed to account for false positive and 
negative data that can result from physical vibration even though they were shown to not 
impact long term (≥2 hr) averages (Cai et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2014). Cleaned 5 minute data 
were then averaged to yield a mean 24-hour exposure assessment. Mean 24-hour personal 
exposure to BC moderately correlated across the two days of measurement (Pearson r=0.36, 
p<0.01), reflecting some day-to-day variation in exposure. 50% of the personal BC exposure 
measurements were sampled during the NYC cold weather-heating season (ie October-
April).
2.4. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement
FeNO was collected twice during the sampling week, immediately following both 24-hour 
BC collection periods, using the offline method (GE Instruments, Boulder, CO) (figure 2) 
(Perzanowski et al., 2008). Participants refrained from physical activity for at least 1 hour

 prior to sample collection. Three breath samples were collected in individual Mylar balloons 
at a flow rate of 83 ml/s and results were averaged to give a mean FeNO for each of the two 
sampling days. For subjects with only one FeNO measurement (n=16) due to equipment 
failure, or inability to collect an adequate sample, the one-day measurement was used in 
place of an average. In addition, to account for possible home environmental contamination 
of our sample, two ambient air samples were collected with a nitric oxide analyzer (GE 
Instruments, Boulder, CO) and averaged.
2.5. Specific allergen sensitization assessment
Relationships between BC exposure, FeNO, and asthma outcomes have been shown to differ 
among allergic and non-allergic children (Cornell et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2012). Therefore, 
we tested allergic sensitization to indoor and outdoor allergens commonly found in urban 
environments (German cockroach, mouse urine proteins, dust mites (Dermatophagoides 
farina), common ragweed, mixed grass pollen (Gx2), and mixed tree pollen (Tx1)). Serum 
samples were collected at ages 7, 9 and 11. Age 9 or age 7 data were used for the children 
that did not have a sample available at age 11. Specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E was measured 
using Immunocap (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) (Donohue et al., 2008). Common ragweed, 
mixed grass pollen and mixed tree pollen data were not available for n=13 children that were 
included in this study. Allergen-specific IgE levels of 0.35 IU/mL or greater were considered 
positive.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Chi-square tests were used to determine differences among 3 mutually exclusive groups of 
activity (ie. MVA+VA, MVA only, and non-active) by sex, asthma diagnosis, and obesity. 
For each child, the two samples of 24-hour personal BC and FeNO were averaged and log 
transformed to assume normal distribution. Student's t-tests were used to determine 
differences in personal BC and FeNO by physical activity group.
In multivariable linear regression models, we combined the MVA+VA and MVA only 
groups, yielding a dichotomized predictor variable, ‘active’ versus ‘non-active.’ The 
outcomes of interest were personal BC and FeNO. Using step-wise linear regression, models 
were adjusted for covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI percentile, second hand 
smoke (SHS) exposure within the last 2 weeks (determined by questionnaire), season of 
measurement (heating vs. non-heating), allergen sensitization and ambient NO for FeNO 
models. In addition to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and standardized BMI z-score, only 
significant covariates were included in final models (ambient NO, cockroach sensitization 
and total IgE for FeNO models). We performed sensitivity analysis to assess if number of 
days with ≥ 60 minutes of MVA was associated with personal BC exposure measurements. 
Also, we performed sensitivity analysis to account for potential environmental 
contamination of NO in our FeNO models. To determine the influence of personal BC on the 
relationship between activity and FeNO we stratified our analysis by BC concentrations at 
the upper tertile (≥1,785 ng/m3) and examined relationships in subgroups. In addition, we 
performed secondary stratified analyses to explore relationships by subgroups of interests 
(school grade level, season of measurement, cockroach sensitization, and asthma diagnosis) 
for future hypothesis generation.

 A significance level of 0.05 was established a priori. All statistical analyses were performed 
using SAS 9.4.
3. Results
3.1. Subject characteristics
Demographic characteristics of the 129 children in our cohort are included in table 1. The 
children were generally active with 55.8% meeting the CDC recommendation of ≥ 60 
minutes of MVA daily (figure S1). Among the active group, only 20 children met the 
additional criteria of ≥10 minutes of vigorous activity on at least 3 days (MVA+VA). 
Activity patterns significantly varied by sex (p<0.01) with more boys meeting the additional 
VA criteria than girls (figure S2). Activity patterns did not vary by current asthma (p=0.77) 
or by obesity (p=0.81, figure S2).
3.2. Physical activity was associated with greater personal BC exposure
There was a trend towards higher average personal BC concentrations among the active 
children (n=72, GM±SD: 1,210 ± 1.78 ng/m3) compared to the non-active children (n=57, 
GM±SD: 1,060 ± 1.69 ng/m3) (p=0.11). Specifically, the active children that met the 
additional VA criteria had significantly greater personal BC concentrations (n=20, GM±SD: 
1,400 ± 1.65 ng/m3) compared to the non-active children (p=0.04) (figure 3, table S2). In 
multivariable linear regression models, after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI 
z-score, active children had 25% greater BC concentrations compared to non-active children 
(95% CI: 4-51%, p=0.02) (table 2).
In a sensitivity analysis, we reran our model using numbers of days with ≥ 60 minutes of 
MVA as the main predictor of interest and again observed a significant positive relationship 
between physical activity and personal BC measures (crude β estimate=0.07, 95% CI: 0, 
0.14, p=0.05, adjusted β estimate=0.09, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.15, p=0.01) (figure S3).
3.3. FeNO was reduced among active children
In bivariate analysis there was no significant difference in FeNO in the active children 
(n=72, GM±SD: 14.66 ± 2.17 ppb) compared to the non-active children (n=57, GM±SD: 
17.63 ± 2.15 ppb, p=0.18). However, in multivariable analysis, after controlling for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, BMI, cockroach sensitization, and total IgE, active children had 20% lower 
FeNO than non-active children (95% CI: 1-35%, p=0.04) (table 2). Sensitization to 
cockroach, but not to other indoor and outdoor allergens, was a significant confounder in the 
association between physical activity and FeNO.
In a sensitivity analysis, we removed all FeNO measurements in which the ambient NO was 
greater than 100 ppb because of the possibility of home environmental contamination, 
yielding a sample size of n=122. We again observed active children (n=70) had 21% lower 
FeNO than non-active children (n=52, 95% CI: 1-38%, p=0.04).

 3.4. BC exposure influences the relationship between activity and FeNO
To test the hypothesis that personal BC exposure would attenuate the relationship between 
activity and FeNO we stratified our linear regression model by the upper tertile of personal 
BC measure (≥1,790 ng/m3). Among the n=33 children that had the highest personal BC 
there was no association between activity and FeNO (β estimate=0.00, 95% CI: -0.62, 0.62, 
p=1.00). Thus, the relationship between activity and FeNO was completely driven by the 
n=96 children with lower personal BC measures (β estimate=-0.27, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.52, 
p=0.04). Active children with lower concentrations of personal BC had 24% lower FeNO 
compared to non-active children with lower BC (95% CI: 2-41%). However, in a formal test 
for interaction between activity and dichotomized BC, the p-value for the interaction term 
was not significant (p=0.56)
3.5 Secondary analyses
Based on the observation that age was a significant covariate in the relationship between 
physical activity and BC measures, we stratified our linear regression model by school grade 
level and compared middle and high school students (grades 6-9, n=91) with elementary 
school students (grades 3-5, n=26) (current grade missing for n=12 children). Among middle 
and high schoolers, we detected 33% greater BC measures in active compared to non-active 
children (95% CI: 9-63%, p<0.01). There was a smaller and not statistically significant 
difference (30%) among active versus non-active elementary school students (95% CI: 
−30-141%, p=0.39). In a test for interaction the p-value for the interaction term was not 
significant (p=0.86) (table S3). BC concentrations are known to vary by heating season 
(Jung et al., 2010), therefore we stratified our linear regression model by NYC cold weather, 
heating season (ie October-April) versus non-heating season. Interestingly, among the n=64 
children that were sampled during the heating season, we identified 50% greater BC 
measures in active compared to non-active children (95% CI: 10-103%, p=0.01). However, 
the association was not statistically significant among the n=65 children that were sampled 
in warm weather, non-heating season (11% difference, 95% CI: −12-40%, p=0.37). In a test 
for interaction the p-value for the interaction term was not significant (p=0.13) (table S3).
Also, given our observation that cockroach sensitization was a significant covariate in the 
relationship between physical activity and FeNO we stratified our multivariable regression 
model by cockroach sensitization. We observed 24% lower FeNO between the active versus 
non-active children that were not cockroach sensitized (n=78, 95% CI: 3-41%, p=0.03); 
however, among the children that were cockroach sensitized, there was no significant 
difference (n=51, 1% difference, 95% CI: −35-50%, p=0.96). In a test for interaction the p-
value for the interaction term was not significant (p=0.34) (table S3). Similarly, when our 
model was stratified by asthma there was 29% lower FeNO among active versus non-active 
children that did not have asthma (n=59, 95% CI: 4-47%, p=0.02). The association between 
physical activity and FeNO among children with asthma was not significant (n=70, 14% 
difference, 95% CI: −37-17%, p=0.33). In the test for interaction the p-value for the 
interaction was not significant (p=0.59) (table S3).

 4. Discussion
In our cohort of African American and Dominican children living in urban NYC, we found 
that 9-14 year olds that engaged in at least 1 hour of physical activity daily had greater 
exposure to the pollutant BC. Furthermore, daily physical activity was associated with 
reduced airway inflammation, but primarily among the children that had lower measures of 
personal BC. Thus, we believe that high personal BC exposure offsets the protective effects 
of physical activity on airway inflammation.
The first evidence to suggest that physical activity among children living in polluted 
neighborhoods might cause asthma was published by McConnell and colleagues. They 
found that children living in high ozone neighborhoods in Southern California and 
participated in 3 or more team sports (not limited to outdoors) had an increased relative risk 
of developing asthma compared to children that did not play sports. This association was not 
detected in the low ozone neighborhoods within the same region (McConnell et al., 2002). 
Both ozone and BC are known to significantly impact health and climate; however, unlike 
ozone, to date BC has been neglected in studies of physical activity-related exposures. Some 
studies have suggested that increased respiratory rates and tidal volumes during vigorous 
activity may lead to increased deposition of pollutant particles within the lung, which could 
lead to asthma (Giles and Koehle, 2014; Strak et al., 2010). Also studies in adults have 
demonstrated that acute exposure to TRAP during various levels of physical activity can lead 
to acute reduction in lung function (McCreanor et al., 2007; Rundell et al., 2008). Among 
adolescents chronically exposed to high levels of particulate matter (PM)2.5 and elemental 
carbon (EC) (similar component to BC but measured differently), Guaderman et al 
demonstrated significant reduction in lung growth over an 8-year span (Gauderman et al., 
2004).
One explanation for our observation that greater BC exposure occurred among those with 
daily physical activity is that opportunities for physical activity in urban areas may be more 
limited to sites of greater TRAP exposure. Time spent outdoors (Sallis et al., 1993) and 
access to outdoor space (Cohen et al., 2006) is associated with greater physical activity in 
children. Also, walking to school has been shown to have a significant contribution to daily 
physical activity (Cooper et al., 2010). In our urban environment, 45% of children in this 
study reported walking to and from school. Outdoor TRAP exposures in urban areas can be 
highest along roadbeds (Jung et al., 2011). One small study of adults in NYC demonstrated 
that walking was associated with greater physical activity and greater PM2.5 exposure 
compared to traveling by car or subway (Morabia et al., 2009). In addition, we identified a 
significant relationship between daily physical activity and BC exposure among the older 
children in our cohort that could be related to increased independent outdoor activities. 
However, pollutant exposures are not limited to outdoor space and PM components, such as 
BC, can also penetrate indoors (Jung et al., 2010). PM2.5 concentrations are reportedly 
higher indoors than outdoors particularly in the cold weather months (Jung et al., 2010), 
which is also a time when children are more likely to spend time and potentially be more 
active indoors. And interestingly, we observed a stronger relationship between physical 
activity and personal BC exposure in the cold weather, heating season months compared to 
non-heating season months. These findings highlight the need for future studies to better

 identify differences between indoor and outdoor pollutant exposures during periods of 
physical activity.
Our finding of an inverse association between physical activity and FeNO is consistent with 
Mendes et al who reported reduced FeNO among adult asthmatics that participated in a 3-
month-long aerobic training program (Mendes et al., 2011). However, in two small clinical 
trials of children with asthma that participated in a 3-month aerobic training program there 
was no significant reduction in FeNO (Bonsignore et al., 2008; Moreira et al., 2008). Our 
study is novel because we assessed daily habitual physical activity while the previous reports 
assessed participation in an exercise program at least 2 days per week. Also, the above-
mentioned studies focused on children with asthma, yet our sample also included children 
without asthma. Upon stratifying the multivariable regression models by asthma, we 
observed attenuation in the association between physical activity and FeNO among the 
children with asthma, specifically compared to healthy children. Our findings suggest that 
physical activity could have a protective effect among those at risk for developing airway 
inflammation, whereas this protection is less significant when disease has already occurred. 
In addition, based on our results and given the findings by Spira-Cohen et al of a positive 
association between personal EC exposure and respiratory symptoms in children with 
asthma (Spira-Cohen et al., 2011), we also can reason that the benefit of exercise on 
reducing airway inflammation, may not extend to children with asthma who are more likely 
to have an opposing inflammatory response linked to respiratory symptoms.
Several mechanisms to explain the relationship between exercise and airway inflammation 
have been explored in rodent models. For example, exercised mice have been demonstrated 
to have reduced expression of pro-inflammatory T helper (Th)-2 cytokines,43 reduced 
activation of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB (Pastva et al., 2004) and reduced 
concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Files et al., 2015). In addition, 
epigenetic changes that may occur in response to exercise and physical activity could lead to 
a reduction in inflammation (Horsburgh et al., 2015). However, further mechanistic studies 
in humans, especially in children, are needed.
We also identified cockroach sensitization was a key covariate in the relationship between 
physical activity and FeNO, unlike sensitization to other aeroallergens commonly found in 
urban environments. Combined exposure to cockroach allergen and the TRAP, polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) previously has been identified as an important risk factor for 
the development of cockroach sensitization (Jung et al., 2015; Perzanowski et al., 2013). 
Here we identified cockroach non-sensitized children had greater inverse associations 
between physical activity and FeNO compared to the sensitized children. One theory to 
explain resistance to activity induced reductions in airway inflammation is that seroatopy is 
such a strong predictor of FeNO (Scott et al., 2010) that associations with physical activity 
are blunted among the already sensitized. Similarly, in another cohort of children living in 
NYC, non-allergic children had significant inverse associations between BC exposure and 
FeNO (Cornell et al., 2012). Despite a significant difference in SHS exposure between the 
active and non-active children (table 1), SHS was not a significant covariate in the 
relationship between physical activity and FeNO, nor the relationship between physical 
activity and BC exposure.

 The cross sectional design is a limitation of our study because of our lack of ability to assess 
temporality. Airway inflammation from allergic disease or asthma could cause urban 
children to reduce their physical activity; thus, we are unable to presume a causal 
relationship between physical activity and reduced airway inflammation. However, of the 71 
asthmatic children within our study 75% answered no to the question: “Did your asthma 
limit your activity today?” and only 2 children reported that their asthma limited their 
activity most of the time. While we attempted to assess for confounding, the observational 
nature of the design coupled with our limited sample size makes it difficult to fully exclude 
unmeasured confounding. Also, the children in this cohort were of African American and 
Dominican descent and replication in a larger and more racially and ethnically diverse 
population is warranted. An additional study limitation is that our FeNO measurements were 
only sampled at 2 different points during the 1-week of observation and not daily. Although, 
we believe that averaging the repeated measures likely accounted for potential day-to-day 
fluctuations. Similar to our FeNO measurements, we investigated average personal exposure 
to BC at two 24-hour periods during a week and related that to average physical activity 
patterns across that same week. While this method allowed us to observe relationships 
between trends in exposures and behaviors, future studies are necessary to match real-time 
exposure and physical activity to better identify if periods of physical activity are actually 
occurring in locations of high exposure. In our study we did not investigate whether the 
activity was occurring indoors or outdoors, thus we cannot speak to where in particular the 
exposure was greatest. In particular future studies should address differences between indoor 
and outdoor activity/exposure relationships.
Exposure to many TRAPs including BC can vary greatly due to changes in traffic patterns 
and distance from traffic related sources (Dons et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2009). Therefore, 
personal exposure monitoring, as measured here, is ideal for capturing individual level BC 
exposure when evaluating relationships between exposures, behaviors and clinical measures. 
An additional strength of the study is the use of wrist mounted accelerometer devises that 
were not removed during the observation period. Thus, we did not rely on the children to 
remember to put the device on each day. Also, measurement of physical activity was not 
presented to the children as a primary predictor in the parent study, therefore we do not 
believe that participation in the study influenced physical activity levels.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, using personal exposure samplers we have demonstrated that children that 
live in an urban environment and are physically active on a daily basis have higher personal 
BC exposure. High BC exposure partially offsets the protective relationship between 
physical activity and airway inflammation. Overall, our findings contribute to the evidence 
that physical activity may be beneficial to the respiratory health of children, adding further 
support to the current physical activity recommendations; however, high BC pollutant 
exposure attenuates this effect.
