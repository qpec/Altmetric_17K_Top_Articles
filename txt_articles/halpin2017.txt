ABSTRACT 
Aim 
To investigate transition in newly qualified nurses through an exploration of their stressors and 
stress experiences during their first 12 months post-qualifying. 
 
Background 
Globally, thousands of new nurses qualify annually. They are crucial for the profession and 
healthcare service delivery. Work-related stress has multiple serious consequences, yet there is a 
lack of robust, empirical evidence that directly analyses newly qualified nurses and the stress they 
feel and experience in the workplace. Understanding what causes newly qualified nurses’ stress is 
vital to retaining and nurturing this vital component of the workforce.  
 
Design 
Longitudinal, explanatory sequential mixed methods, cohort study.

Methods  
At the point of qualification (n= 288), 6 months post-qualifying (n= 107) and 12 months post-
qualifying (n= 86), newly qualified nurses completed the Nursing Stress Scale, with 14 completing a 
one-to-one interview at 12 months post-qualifying. Data were collected from 2010-2012. Inferential 
statistics, ‘thematic analysis’ and ‘side-by-side comparisons in a discussion’ were used for analysis.  
  
Results 
Workload was consistently the highest reported stressor with inadequate staffing and managing 
multiple role demands given as explanations. Incivility within the workplace was a noted stressor. 
Conversely, being part of ‘a good team’ provided a civil, supportive, facilitative work environment. 
Entering nurse education with previous healthcare experience had a mediating effect on the 
reported frequency of stressors. 
 
Conclusions 
Newly qualified nurses encounter multiple work-related stressors over their first 12 months post-
qualifying, which are intrinsically entwined with their transition. Employing organisations need to be 
more proactive in managing their workload and addressing workplace incivility.

SUMMARY STATEMENT 
Why is this research needed? 
• 
No literature exists where newly qualified nurses have quantified and qualified what causes 
them stress during transition.  
• 
No literature exists that follows up newly qualified nurses sequentially over 12 months post-
qualifying. 
• 
Identifying and understanding newly qualified nurses’ stressors will help with the transition 
process and their retention in the workforce. 
 
What are the key findings? 
• 
Workload was consistently the most frequently reported stressor. 
• 
Newly qualified nurses experienced stress from workplace incivility, but ‘a good team’ 
supported transition. 
• 
Prior healthcare experience mediated some stressors. 
 
How should the findings be used to influence policy/practice/research/education? 
• 
The workload of newly qualified nurses needs to be proactively managed. 
• 
Organisations need to implement strategies to promote nursing team civility. 
• 
The long-term benefits of entering nurse education with healthcare experience requires 
further research.

Introduction 
Stress amongst the nursing workforce is an international cause for concern with its known 
professional, organisational and personal consequences (O’Henley et al. 1997, McVicar 2003, Lim et 
al. 2010).  Furthermore, many countries around the world are either experiencing or anticipating a 
significant shortage of nurses in their healthcare workforce (Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development 2013). Understanding newly qualified nurses’ (NQN) stressors and stress 
experiences in the workplace is therefore crucial to retaining and nurturing them, so they can 
achieve their full potential and help meet escalating health service requirements along with 
advancing quality of care.   
 
This paper provides an enhanced understanding of NQN stress and stressors during their first 12 
months from becoming a qualified, registered nurse. Using a rarely-used longitudinal, explanatory 
sequential mixed methods design, the doctoral research presented spans NQN transition capturing 
change and stress-mediating factors.   
 
Background 
Nursing students in the UK and internationally undergo several years of theoretical and practical 
education to qualify as a nurse. Thereafter, the NQN immediately embarks on a period of transition 
lasting 6-12 months (Romyn et al. 2009 Andersson & Edberg,  
2010) as they leave behind their student status and fully embrace their professional role. Synthesis 
of the literature suggests transition issues for NQNs include working in an alien culture (Kelly & 
Ahern 2009), functioning in an organisation and a team (Bisholt 2012), adapting to a new role 
coupled with personal development (Clark & Holmes 2007) and managing conflict with cherished

ideals (Maben et al. 2007). Overall, it is a complex process of evolving professionalisation, 
socialisation and adaptation (Kramer 1974, Duchscher 2009). However, whether transition is 
stressful has received considerably less investigation. 
 
There are examples in the predominantly qualitative NQN transition literature where stress is 
referred to without supporting examples of participant dialogue to evidence that NQNs found the 
theme stressful, rather than problematic (e.g. O’Shea & Kelly 2007, Kelly & Ahern 2009, Duchscher 
2009). Chang and Hancock (2003) investigated NQN role stress and ambiguity.  While providing 
valuable longitudinal insight, the scope of stressors for NQNs is likely to be broader than the small 
number of questionnaire items used. Yeh and Yu (2009) conducted a study with Taiwanese NQNs 
creating a questionnaire to investigate what their work-related stressors were during their first 3 
months post-qualifying. While providing a rare example of a range of high and low-rated stressors 
for NQNs, it only provides insight into NQN stressors at the early stage of transition. Therefore, there 
is currently limited empirical evidence as to what stressors affect NQNs and why they regard them as 
stressful. The present mixed methods study aimed to produce this new knowledge taking into 
account that NQNs undergo a period of transition over their first 12 months post-qualifying thus 
some stressors may be unique to NQNs and may change over time.    
 
Theoretical framework 
The transactional cognitive appraisal theory of stress by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) was used. 
Central to the theory is a person’s, or for this study a NQN’s, appraisal of why and to what extent 
their interaction with their workplace environment is regarded as stressful. Lazarus and Folkman 
(1984) proposed three types of primary appraisal: ‘irrelevant’, ‘benign-positive’ and ‘stressful’. 
‘Stressful’ appraisals take the form of ‘harm/loss’, ‘threat’ or ‘challenge’. ‘Harm/loss’ and ‘threat’ are

characterised by negative emotional responses such as fear, anxiety and anger. ‘Challenge’ 
responses, characterised by eagerness and excitement, are more positive because they constitute 
growth and personal gain. Therefore, application of the theory to NQNs provides a range of potential 
appraisal outcomes, some of which can result in positive and/or negative personal responses.   
 
THE STUDY 
Aims 
In the UK, there are four fields of nurse education leading to registration as a qualified nurse: adult, 
child, mental health and learning disabilities. The aim of the research was to investigate transition in 
NQNs (adult field) through an exploration of their stressors and stress experiences during their first 
12 months post-qualifying. The research questions were: 
1. What are the work-related stressors experienced by NQNs during their first 12 months post-
qualifying? 
2. To what extent do work-related stressors change in NQNs during their first 12 months post-
qualifying?  
 
Design 
An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used (Wisdom & Creswell 2013). The strength 
of this methodology is that the separate quantitative phases followed by a qualitative phase are 
mutually illuminating and thus provide the greatest understanding of the topic by being the sum of 
its constituent parts (Woolley 2009). Questionnaires were completed by participants at Phase 1 
(point of qualification), Phase 2 (6 months post-qualifying) and Phase 3 (12 months post-qualifying) 
followed by semi-structured interviews at Phase 4 (12 months post-qualifying). A pilot study of each

phase was undertaken using a similar sample resulting in no design changes. Phase 1 data were 
collected in campus classrooms, while Phase 2 and 3 data were collected predominantly through 
electronic submission. Phase 4 data were collected in a private campus office. Data were collected 
from 2010-2012. 
 
Sample 
All adult field nursing students from 1 university in England were invited via their virtual learning 
environment to participate. Four cohorts of nursing students were recruited on the last day of their 
nurse education, the exact time point they became NQNs (Phase 1). The number recruited was n= 
288, 49% of the potential population. At Phase 2, n=107 of the original sample continued to 
participate in the research. At Phase 3, n=86 completed the final phase of quantitative data 
collection. Phase 4 was the qualitative interview phase in which a convenience sample of n= 14 
Phase 3 responders participated. Recruitment to Phase 4 ceased at n= 14 participants as data 
saturation was achieved.  
 
Data collection 
Quantitative Phases 1-3 
The standardised Nursing Stress Scale (NSS) (Gray-Toft & Anderson 1981) was used in Phases 1-3. 
The NSS was developed to measure the frequency and sources of stress, though not the stress 
intensity felt, for hospital-based nurses. There are 7 subscales in the NSS constituting 7 sources of 
nursing stress: ‘death and dying’, ‘conflict with physicians’, ‘inadequate preparation’, ‘lack of 
support’, ‘conflict with other nurses’, ‘workload’ and ‘uncertainty concerning treatment’. To 
calculate the results for the NSS, each of the 7 subscales is summed to produce a subscale total.

Likewise, all 34 item scores are summed to produce an overall total stress score (Gray-Toft & 
Anderson 1981). Post-publication of Gray-Toft and Anderson (1981), the authors amended the 
scoring from 0-3 to 1-4 per item thus the total possible score became 136 and not 102 as in the 
original publication. The amended scoring system was used in this research. 
 
Qualitative Phase 4 
Phase 4 consisted of semi-structured, one-to-one interviews with the lead author. Participants were 
asked 2 questions about work-related stress: 
1. What things have caused you stress at work during your first year as a qualified nurse?  
2. Is there anything your clinical area could have done to help you with the stressors you have 
encountered in your first year as a qualified nurse? 
 
Ethical considerations 
University ethics approval for the research was granted in January 2010. All participants were 
provided with a separate information sheet and consent form for the quantitative and qualitative 
phases and assured of anonymity. Participants were debriefed after their interview by the 
interviewer to ensure their well-being as recommended by Coolican (2014).  
 
Data analysis  
Appropriate for a mixed methods study, the data were analysed separately initially, maintaining the 
characteristics of each: numbers for quantitative data and words for the qualitative data 
(Sandelowski 2000).  Phases 1-3 quantitative data from the NSS were analysed using ‘IBM SPSS

Statistics 21’™. Missing data were not replaced. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to 
describe the sample in detail. Distribution analysis was undertaken for the NSS total and subscales. 
Distribution was normal thus parametric tests were used. Healthcare experience prior to the 
participant commencing their nurse education and age as confounding variables were analysed. A 
‘one-way repeated measures ANOVA’ was used to determine change in reported stress between 
each time point over 12 months. To reduce the risk of bias and a skewed result, only a complete 
dataset was used in this analysis (Son et al. 2012). 
 
The Phase 4 interviews were transcribed verbatim. The resulting qualitative data were analysed 
using the 6 stage ‘thematic analysis’ process as detailed by Braun and Clarke (2006) producing 
themes and sub-themes relevant to NQN work-related stress.     
 
To maintain the integrity of the separate analyses, but to be able to draw mixed methods inferences, 
the merged data analysis technique of ‘side-by-side comparisons in a discussion’ was undertaken 
(Creswell & Plano Clark 2011). The three possible outcomes from this technique were: convergence, 
complementary and divergence (Östlund et al. 2011). 
 
Validity and reliability/rigour 
Assessment of validity and reliability was part of the questionnaire selection criteria. Gray-Toft and 
Anderson (1981) calculated the Cronbach’s coefficient alpha for the NSS total stress score as 0.89 
and the subscales ranged from 0.64 -0.80. To calculate a Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, Kline (2000) 
stated that a sample had to be representative of the population and contain not less than 100 
people. As the Phase 1 sample met both of these criteria, Cronbach’s coefficient alpha for the total

stress score using this dataset was 0.90 and the subscales ranged from 0.66-0.75, comparing 
favourably to the original work and 0.91 for total stress from a small sample of NQNs (Brunero et al. 
2008). 
 
‘Rich rigour’, ‘sincerity’, ‘credibility’ and ‘resonance’ are elements suggested by Tracy (2010) as 
denoting excellence in qualitative research. These requirements are demonstrated through the use 
of a suitable number of in-depth interviews that followed a schedule that covered the research 
aims/questions. Data analysis showed rigour because it was systematically conducted using 
‘thematic analysis’ and ‘side-by-side comparisons in a discussion’.  Additionally, a sample of 
transcripts were analysed separately by a co-author.  The findings are presented using ‘thick 
description’ (Bryman 2012) allowing others to judge the ‘resonance’ or ‘transferability’ of the 
findings to other populations and contexts (Braun & Clarke 2013).   
 
Results/findings 
Sample descriptors 
Table 1 provides an overview of the participants per Phase. At Phase 2, of the 90 employed 
participants, most had been employed as a qualified nurse for 3-6 months and 93% were employed 
in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. At Phase 3, of the 78 employed participants, 87% were 
employed in NHS hospitals. The length of time participants had been working as a qualified nurse 
was: 14% (1-6 months), 31% (6-10 months), 39% (11-12 months) and 16% (12-15 months).

Participants that had never worked as a qualified nurse since Phase 1 (point of qualification) were 
excluded from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 stress analyses.  Using ‘independent samples t-tests’ for 
stress data, Phase 4 participants were not significantly different to all other participants at the point 
they qualified or at 12 months post-qualifying when they were interviewed.     
 
Newly qualified nurse stressors (quantitative) 
Table 2 shows the mean total and subscale stress results per phase. There are different numbers of 
items in each of the 7 subscales of the NSS.  Therefore, the mean score per subscale accounting for 
the number of items in each subscale was calculated for each phase and presented visually in Figure 
1. ‘Workload’ was the most frequently reported stressor at each time point over the first 12 months 
post-qualifying. This result complimented the qualitative theme ‘managing the work/workload’, 
which provides the reasons why participants reported workload as such a significant source of 
stress.   
 
Change in stressors over time  
Using a ‘one-way repeated measures ANOVA’, ‘workload’ significantly increased from Phase 2 to 
Phase 3 [F2, 50 = 5.54, p= 0.04]. ‘Death and dying’ significantly decreased from Phase 1 to Phase 2 [F2, 
50 = 9.66, p< 0.01] and then significantly increased from Phase 2 to Phase 3 [F2, 50 = 9.66, p= 0.01]. 
There was no significant difference for this stressor from Phase 1 to Phase 3. This is a divergent 
result from the outcomes of the qualitative analysis where no Phase 4 participant mentioned ‘death 
and dying’ as a source of stress. For all other variables, including the total frequency of stressors, 
there was no significant difference between each time point over the first 12 months post-
qualifying.

Non-responders at Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 and those with incomplete datasets were examined to 
determine if they were significantly different at Phase 1 from those that did participate throughout 
with a full dataset.  There were no significant differences found. 
 
Stressors and age 
At Phase 1, there was a significant negative correlation (p< 0.01) between the total frequency of 
stressors and age for n= 193 participants (r= -0.23). This suggested that the older the participant, the 
lower the total frequency of reported stressors. The specific stressors at Phase 1 that were 
significantly (p< 0.01) associated with age (diminished with increased age) were ‘death and dying’, 
‘conflict with physicians’, ‘inadequate preparation’ and ‘uncertainty concerning treatment’. At Phase 
2 and Phase 3, there was no significant correlation between age and the total frequency of stressors.   
 
Stressors and healthcare experience prior to commencing nurse education 
At Phase 1, n= 88 participants indicated that they had healthcare experience prior to commencing 
their nurse education, while n= 116 indicated that they did not. Where complete data were 
available, participants who had previous healthcare experience reported a significantly lower total 
frequency of stressors [t= 2.80, df= 202, p< 0.01, 95%CI (1.48, 8.54)]. Those that had previous 
experience had a mean (SD) of 68.10 (12.44), whereas those without experience had a mean (SD) of 
73.11 (12.84). At Phase 2, the difference between the groups was not significant. However, at Phase 
3, there was a significant difference again [t= 2.19, df= 66, p= 0.03, 95%CI (0.31, 13.26)]. Those that 
had previous experience (n= 29) had a mean (SD) of 67.34 (12.06), whereas those without 
experience had a mean (SD) of 74.28 (13.51).

The significant stressors at Phase 1 for participants without previous healthcare experience are 
shown in Table 3. At Phase 3, ‘conflict with physicians’ [t= 2.07, df= 74, p= 0.04, 95%CI (0.49, 0.04)] 
remained a significant stressor.  All other stressors identified at Phase 1 were not evident, but 
instead ‘workload’ [t= 2.89, df= 74, p< 0.01, 95%CI (0.63, 3.04)] was identified as a new stressor. 
 
Stressors and stress experiences (qualitative) 
From the Phase 4 qualitative data analysis, three themes were identified: ‘feeling responsible and 
terrified’, ‘it’s not the job, it’s the people you work with’ and ‘managing the work/workload’. Only 
the latter theme was complimentary to the quantitative results. 
 
Feeling responsible and terrified  
Participants described their feelings and fears associated with being a NQN. Participants felt the 
weight of increased responsibility, particularly when they first started work. For some it was evident 
through their fear of making an error and thus harming a patient: 
“When you first start obviously you are terrified because you are suddenly feeling 
responsible for everybody, all your patients. Just the overall feeling of the weight of 
responsibility, that stresses me.” P15 
 
“…it's that thought that I don't want to hurt anyone.” P283   
 
Participants were afraid of being asked a question and not knowing the answer. They felt that others 
expect qualified nurses to know the answer to any question: 
 Accepted Article

“It’s quite hard to say to some people, ‘sorry, I’m newly qualified’ because they just want 
answers then and there, so that’s added stress as well for me.” P138   
 
Participants perceived that they lacked knowledge and needed to address the deficit quickly 
because, as P89 stated, knowledge is what constitutes a “professional person”: 
“…all this new stuff, all these new procedures and things. It’s a lot to have to suddenly learn. 
Quickly, quickly learn it. No time to learn it, you are doing it all straightaway.” P15   
 
Medication was singled out as a nursing role that produced feelings and fears: the fear of error and 
being perceived as too slow to complete a drug round: 
“You feel terrified. I mean you are checking before giving medicine. I’m checking all the 
serial numbers. I’m checking the observation chart. I’m thinking, ‘what if something 
happens?’” P15   
 
“I’m slow because I don't, I still give the medicine. But the pressure, ‘you’re too slow, you’re 
too slow’. But I’m thinking, ‘I’m slow because I’m doing it right.’” P283 
 
It’s not the job, it’s the people you work with 
Participants detailed episodes of unacceptable behaviour and/or attitude directed towards them. 
Predominantly, this incivility was from the ward/team manager, qualified nurses and healthcare 
support workers. Participants were clear that it was the people they worked with, not their roles as a 
nurse that were a major stressor: 
 Accepted Article

“…it was never going to be the patients that would cause me stress. It was always going to 
be staff.” P24 
 
Participants described feeling excluded from the team, being chastised in front of others and being 
criticised for asking a question: 
 “…how she [nurse] spoke [to participant] and it was right in front of the doctors, other 
patients and patients’ relatives as well, so that really, really got me down...” P56 
 
“…‘you should know’ and you just think, ‘perhaps I should know, but I don’t know, that’s 
why I’m asking.’” P138 
 
Participants had a strong desire to uphold their own standards of professionalism and patient care, 
sometimes facing criticism for doing so. P24 illustrated this recalling a conversation with their 
manager:   
“‘… you have got very high standards.’ I went, ‘yeah and I’ll tell you one thing, I ain’t going to 
be dropping them anytime soon.’” P24 
  
Participants felt stressful pressure to conform to the expectations and practices of their team.  
However, they also feared the consequences of following poor standards of practice and for their 
own future professional integrity:

“…writing down an assessment, we’d been taught meticulously… There, it was like, they 
couldn't be bothered to do that. So it was how much do I compromise here? You do try to fit 
in a little bit.” D283  
 
Conversely, some participants referred to being part of ‘a good team’.  They spoke of their stress and 
fears diminishing when they experienced civility and consistent, active support from their 
surrounding team. Two participants in this study left their first job because of chronic incivility from 
their team. However, both articulated how they intended to stay in their current nursing job because 
they were now part of ‘a good team’ that was helping and nurturing them in their nursing roles: 
“I feel I get on well and feel part of the team, appreciated I suppose a bit. I’m more like 
inclined to want to stay.” B104 
 
“As long as you have a nice team. I think that is such an important thing. They were very 
supportive. Lots of nurses said, ‘oh, take your time, don’t worry’, things like that.  …you are 
being allowed to be newly qualified…” A15 
 
Managing the work/workload 
Inadequate numbers of nurses per shift was a stressor cited by many participants: 
“Staffing, staffing, staffing. We’re always short staffed. I think that’s the biggest stress for 
me.” P56 
 
 Accepted Article

The outcomes of inadequate staffing levels were poor skill mix on a shift and participants having to 
take charge of the shift.  Participants felt ill-prepared and feared the consequences of making an 
error: 
“I walked in to find that people had gone sick and it was me, 3 weeks in on the job, newly 
qualified and 2 agency nurses and they expected me to take charge of the shift. I thought, ‘no, 
I’m just not prepared to take this responsibility. I’m not qualified enough to take that on.’ …I 
thought, ‘if something happens this is all down to me’…” P24 
 
“I found that really stressful. Managing a ward is just completely what I didn’t expect. Like the 
first few months from me qualifying.” P23    
 
Participants experienced difficulties managing their multiple role demands within the time limit of 
their shift.  Finding time to complete paperwork was a particular stressor, often resulting in working 
beyond the end of their shift: 
“…it actually got to a point where it was getting so stressful on the ward… my paperwork for 
example, it wouldn’t get done until the end of the shift and sometimes I would be there until 
9.30pm, 9.45pm and I was meant to finish at 8.00pm, trying to finish my paperwork”. P155  
 
A further personal ramification of workload for some participants was they did not take adequate 
breaks during their shift risking their own health and well-being: 
“There's times I was having lunch, 4 o'clock in the afternoon because I'd had to work 
through lunch… So eating habits-wise, it was terrible…” P89

However, some participants provided examples of where more experienced staff helped them 
develop work management strategies which were both welcomed and beneficial: 
“…one of the new nurses who started working on the ward… he just said to me, ‘I try and get 
all this done in the morning and then sit down before lunch and try and get most of my 
documentation done and then I’ve got the afternoon free to do other things that I need to 
do’. So I have tried to adopt that…”  C155 
 
Discussion 
Many of the stressors experienced by the participants had the potential to inhibit a successful 
transition. The results showed that the participants experienced a broad range of stressors 
throughout their first 12 months post-qualifying resonating with the outcome of previous 
international studies that used the NSS with NQNs that were qualified ≤6 months (Brunero et al. 
2008, Suresh et al. 2013). The longitudinal design of the current research provided insight into 
whether stressors changed for the participants over their first 12 months post-qualifying. The results 
showed that the total frequency of stressors did not significantly change, but specific stressors, 
‘workload’ and ‘death and dying’, did significantly change. Furthermore, some stressors appeared 
self-imposed, while others originated from the work environment. Additionally, there was evidence 
that healthcare experience prior to commencing nurse education and being an older NQN were 
protective personal assets, which mediated stressors. 
 
Similar to previous UK and international research findings, participants had a range of feelings and 
fears associated with being ‘thrown in’ to nursing work without help and support (Kelly & Ahern

2009, Thrysoe et al. 2011). Participants feared making an error that harmed patients (Romyn et al. 
2009) and feared not knowing the answer to questions (Duchscher 2001). This led participants to 
feel under pressure, often self-imposed pressure, to learn quickly. For some, they had to battle 
opposition from their team, enduring stress from pressure to follow the prevailing culture and 
norms of their workplace (Maben et al. 2006, Feng & Tsai 2012).  This put them at odds with their 
clearly articulated determination to maintain their high standards of professionalism and patient 
care.  
 
‘Workload’ was consistently the most frequently occurring stressor for participants at each time 
point over their first 12 months post-qualifying. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in its 
reported frequency from 6 months to 12 months post-qualifying, possibly reflecting the end of a 
period of preceptorship as it is in the UK or equivalent NQN support/development arrangements 
elsewhere. From the qualitative data analysis, the reasons why workload was a stressor for 
participants were determined. One reason was an inadequate number of staff per shift sometimes 
resulting in inappropriate skill mix and taking charge of the shift before self-perceived competence 
to do this. This resonates with some of the outcomes of previous research (Maben et al. 2007, 
Duchscher 2008). Another reason was participants trying to manage multiple role demands within 
the time limit of their shift.  
 
It has been postulated that NQNs lack the ability to prioritise their workload and manage their time 
(O’Shea & Kelly 2007). They use self-generated strategies to try and manage their workload (Bisholt 
2012), but these can easily be compromised by competing work-related issues (Ellerton & Gregor 
2003). There was some evidence from participants to support this explanation. Participants disclosed 
how they felt they had developed their own strategies for managing their workload, but these would

get interrupted/disrupted, which would then compromise completion of their work, often resulting 
in them not taking adequate breaks and working beyond the end of their shift. It is also likely, given 
the findings of the present study, that the drive to keep working seen in the participants was linked 
to their perception and motivation to be professional and deliver high standards of care. 
 
As a facet of nursing work, the results indicated ‘death and dying’ was a highly-reported stressor at 
the point of qualification. Its frequency significantly diminished at 6 months post-qualifying, before 
significantly increasing again at 12 months post-qualifying. This was a divergent result from the 
Phase 4 qualitative data where no participant mentioned it as a source of stress.  
 
Por (2005) found that final year nursing students highly ranked ‘death and dying’ as a stressor. At the 
point of qualification, NQNs are still akin to a nursing student.  At 6 months post-qualifying, it is 
more likely NQNs are not caring for the high acuity patients that might die, or they are still actively 
being supported while managing the care of these patients. By 12 months post-qualifying, NQNs are 
likely to be managing patient care with less direct support and, compounded by work/workload 
issues, ‘death and dying’ ascends as a stressor.  However, not articulating it as a stressor may reflect 
that NQNs are developing secondary appraisal coping strategies to manage it as a source of stress. 
 
Unacceptable behaviour/attitude towards NQNs has previously been identified in the UK and 
internationally from healthcare co-workers (Suresh et al. 2013, Rush et al. 2014) and specifically 
from other nurses (Duchscher 2009, Kelly & Ahern 2009). Fundamental to ‘incivility’ is behaviour 
that is low-intensity, but still results in “harmful emotional consequences” according to D’ambra & 
Andrews (2014). This captures the ambiguous nature of what the participants described, that often 
left them thinking that no one else could see how they were being treated.

There are several possible explanations for the identification of workplace incivility in the present 
study.  Nurses are historically an oppressed group due to gender and class (Whitehead 2010) 
resulting in an unequal distribution of power in the workplace (Roberts et al. 2009). Consequently, 
nurses do not challenge the power of others in their workplace, but instead turn on those more 
vulnerable (D’ambra & Andrews 2014), which would include fledgling NQNs. In nursing there are 
several different generations each with their own work ethic, perspective on work and ways of 
managing and being managed (Duchscher & Cowin 2004). Furthermore, the UK nursing workforce 
consists of registered nurses that completed radically different nurse education from all round the 
world (NMC 2008) and are ethnically diverse (NMC 2012). This great diversity and power 
differentials in a nursing team and among healthcare workers may all be contributors to actual or 
perceived incivility.   
 
The potential outcome of chronic workplace incivility is attrition from the organisation’s workforce 
or from the profession.  This was certainly the reason given by 2 participants at Phase 4 for resigning 
from their first nursing job. However, the present study identified the benefits of being part of ‘a 
good team’ and how participants reported this factor was an important determinant in them 
remaining in post and being able to manage and reduce the personal effects of other work-related 
stressors.  Good teams and good team leaders have a vital function in mediating stress for NQNs. 
 
The present research found a significant difference in the total frequency of stressors reported by 
participants that had healthcare experience prior to commencing their nurse education. These 
participants reported a lower total frequency of stressors at the point of qualification and at 12 
months post-qualifying. Additionally, these participants reported significantly less ‘conflict with

physicians’ and ‘conflict with other nurses’ as stressors at the point of qualification. The significant 
differences at 12 months post-qualifying were ‘conflict with physicians’ and ‘workload’. Also of 
significance in this study, increased age was associated with the reporting of a lower total frequency 
of stressors as well as ‘death and dying’, ‘conflict with physicians’, ‘inadequate preparation’ and 
‘uncertainty concerning treatment’ as specific sources of stress at the point of qualification.   
 
Applying the cognitive appraisal theoretical framework (Lazarus & Folkman 1984), it is possible that 
NQNs with prior healthcare experience are more advanced in being able to manage and adapt to 
work-related stressors than their peers without such experience to draw from and thus appraise 
fewer situations as stressful. This personal asset may potentially assist them during transition and, in 
particular, in managing the stress of workplace incivility and their workload. Likewise, being an older 
NQN may also be a helpful personal asset in the appraisal of work-related stressors, though it is 
unknown why this was not an enduring asset.  
 
Limitations 
Using a repeated measures design enabled differences between time points to be determined with 
less risk of sampling error (Scott & Mazhindu 2014). The longitudinal design also reflected that 
transition is a process over time (Higgins et al. 2010). However, attrition, an established risk with 
such a design, led to smaller than desirable sample sizes at 6 and 12 months post-qualifying. The NSS 
may also have been a limitation as it may not have captured all sources of stress for NQNs.

Conclusion 
This unique, longitudinal mixed methods study demonstrates that NQNs encounter multiple work-
related stressors over their first 12 months post-qualifying that are intrinsically entwined with their 
transition pathway. The identification of workload and incivility as stressors for NQNs as well as the 
stress-mediating benefits for NQNs that come from being part of ‘a good team’ suggests these issues 
need to be more actively addressed by employing organisations. A 12 month, structured, 
individualised programme of skills and knowledge acquisition in tandem with a gradual increase in 
workload is recommended. Planned, regular, constructive feedback from the NQN’s manager would 
assist with personal development and the early identification of work-related stressors. 
Organisation-based training to improve effective and civil team-working together with a clear 
strategy to report and address incivility would also be beneficial. Healthcare experience prior to 
commencing nurse education appears to be a personal asset and is worthy of further research as it 
implies a change to pre-registration recruitment strategies should be considered. In the interim, the 
high ideals and professionalism of these NQNs should be celebrated, nurtured and supported.
