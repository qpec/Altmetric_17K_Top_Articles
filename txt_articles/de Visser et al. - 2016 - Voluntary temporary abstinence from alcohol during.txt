Abstract 
Objective: Temporary abstinence from alcohol may convey physiological benefits and 
enhance well-being. The aim of this study was to address a lack of information about: (1) 
correlates of successful completion of a planned period of abstinence, and (2) how success or 
failure in planned abstinence affects subsequent alcohol consumption. Methods: 857 British 
adults (249 men, 608 women) participating in the “Dry January” alcohol abstinence challenge 
completed a baseline questionnaire, a one-month follow-up questionnaire, and a 6-month 
follow-up questionnaire. Key variables assessed at baseline included measures of alcohol 
consumption and drink refusal self-efficacy (DRSE). Results: In bivariate analysis, success 
during Dry January was predicted by measures of more moderate alcohol consumption and 
greater social DRSE. Multivariate analyses revealed that success during Dry January was best 
predicted by a lower frequency of drunkenness in the month prior to Dry January. Structural 
Equation Modelling revealed that participation in Dry January was related to reductions in 
alcohol consumption and increases in DRSE among all respondents at 6-month follow-up, 
regardless of success, but these changes were more likely among people who successfully 
completed the challenge. Conclusions: The findings suggest that participation in abstinence 
challenges such as “Dry January” may be associated with changes toward healthier drinking 
and greater DRSE, and is unlikely to result in undesirable “rebound effects”: very few people 
reported increased alcohol consumption following a period of voluntary abstinence.

In recent years, various organizations in different countries have established campaigns in 
which people are challenged to give up alcohol for one month. Some are designed as 
sponsored fundraising events (e.g., au.dryjuly.com, nz.dryjuly.com). Others such as “Dry 
January” (www.dryjanuary.org.uk) are simply presented as a challenge to be undertaken in 
cultures in which alcohol consumption is a common feature of social life (Babor et al., 2010). 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people make use of such challenges to initiate 
reductions in alcohol consumption or to quit drinking altogether. The latter goal is a key 
motivation behind campaigns such as Stoptober (stoptober.smokfree.nhs.uk), in which 
smokers are challenged to stop smoking for one month (Brown et al., 2014), because smokers 
who can give up for one month are significantly more likely to quit (West & Stapleton, 2008). 
Whereas “Stoptober” is underpinned by a desire to encourage smoking cessation (Brown 
et al., 2014), temporary alcohol abstinence challenges do not aim for permanent abstinence. 
For example, the goal of the UK charity Alcohol Concern is to improve people’s lives by 
reducing the harm caused by alcohol, with a long term aim of changing the drinking culture 
(www.alcoholconcern.org.uk). Alcohol Concern first ran its abstinence challenge “Dry 
January” in 2013 to encourage people to think about the way they drink and to talk about 
alcohol: this reflects theorizing around “social contagion”, and a hope that healthy changes in 
beliefs and behavior among a sub-group of people will spread through the population 
(Christakis & Fowler, 2013; Einstein & Epstein, 1980). Alcohol Concern also allows people 
to opt in to fundraising via sponsorship of their attempt to complete Dry January. 
One small-scale study of the effects of a month of abstinence found marked reductions in 
liver fat and blood glucose, moderate reductions in blood cholesterol, and marked increases 
in self-reported sleep quality, concentration, and work performance (Coghlan, 2014). These 
benefits are impressive, but it has been suggested that they may be lost if people subsequently 
return to previous levels of drinking or experience “rebound effects” whereby their alcohol 
use increases following a period of abstinence (New Scientist, 2014).  
Correlates and consequences of temporary abstinence 
There is a need for more information about the correlates and consequences of 
participation in alcohol abstinence challenges. Little is known about how many people 
successfully complete the Dry January challenge, or about characteristics that distinguish 
those who succeed from those who fail. Furthermore, there has been no evaluation of the 
longer-term effects of voluntarily undertaking a period of abstinence from alcohol. It is 
important to address these knowledge gaps to determine the potential utility of abstinence 
 3 
 
 
 
challenges within health psychology. 
Characteristics of drinkers are likely to explain success in abstinence challenges and/or 
subsequent alcohol consumption. Drink Refusal Self-Efficacy (DRSE: Young et al., 1991) is 
an individual’s self-perceived capacity to refuse alcohol in three domains: social settings 
when others are drinking, for emotion regulation, and opportunistic drinking. Greater DRSE 
correlates with less harmful alcohol consumption (Atwell, Abraham & Duka, 2011; de Visser 
et al., 2014; Gilles, Turk & Fresco, 2006; Oei & Jardim 2007). One might, therefore, expect 
people with greater DRSE to be more likely to complete abstinence challenges. One might 
also expect those who have completed a month of abstinence in the past to be more likely to 
complete a new abstinence challenge because they have demonstrated their DRSE.  
There is a lack of evidence about how patterns of alcohol use affect success in an 
abstinence challenge. However, evidence from two related domains suggests that moderate 
drinkers may be more likely than heavier drinkers to complete an abstinence challenge. One 
study of pregnant women found that lighter drinkers were less likely to intend to drink or to 
actually drink during pregnancy (Zammit, Skouteris, Wetheim, Paxton & Milgrom, 2008). 
Studies of alcohol use among university students indicate that more moderate alcohol 
consumption is related to a lower likelihood of intended and actual heavy episodic drinking 
(Norman & Conner, 2006; Norman, Conner & Stride, 2012). Furthermore, people who more 
strongly endorse fun and sociability as reasons for binge drinking are more likely to 
subsequently engage in binge drinking (Norman et al., 2012). This finding supports the 
earlier speculation that people with lower social DRSE may be less likely to complete an 
abstinence challenge. It is also important to note that habitual patterns of alcohol intake exert 
a strong influence on the subsequent alcohol intake (Norman, 2011).  
In addition to considering characteristics of individuals, it is important to consider social 
contextual influences on behavior change. Social support can help people to adhere to health 
behavior change (Bauld, Bell, McCullough, Richardson & Greaves, 2010; Olander et al., 
2013). Social support can be conceptualized in general terms and/or as a measure of direct 
support from specific individuals. In the context of Dry January, it could be conceptualized as 
encouragement from important individuals such as the event organizers and/or support and 
encouragement from companions in “buddy systems”, in which participants pair up to offer 
mutual support. Buddy systems can increase the likelihood of successful health behavior 
change across a range of behaviors (Jepson, Harris, Platt & Tannahill, 2010; West & 
Stapleton, 2008), and there is evidence that supportive friends or partners can help people to 
 4 
 
 
 
reduce their alcohol intake (Barber & Crisp, 1995; McCrady, 2004). However, it is not known 
whether undertaking an alcohol abstinence challenge with another person affects success 
rates. People who engage in fundraising through Dry January may have a greater resolve to 
complete the challenge after having made a public commitment to it: evidence from social 
psychological research indicates that people are more likely to enact a behavior after making 
a public commitment to do so (Cialdini, 2009, p.52; Festinger, 1957, p.11). 
The lack of information about rates and correlate of success in abstinence challenges is 
accompanied by a lack of information about the consequences of a successful or unsuccessful 
abstinence attempt. One might expect there to be feedback loops between DRSE and alcohol 
consumption such that successful completion of a dry month could lead to increases in DRSE 
that result in reduced alcohol consumption (Atwell et al., 2011; de Visser et al., 2014; Gilles 
et al., 2006; Oei & Jardim 2007). It may also be the case that completing the first part of Dry 
January demonstrates to participants that they can refuse alcohol, leading to increases in 
DRSE that make completing a dry month more likely.  
It is important to note, however, that failed attempts at temporary abstinence may lead to 
“rebound effects”, whereby alcohol intake increases above baseline levels following a period 
of abstinence. Studies of non-human animals suggest that enforced abstinence from alcohol 
tends to be followed by increases in alcohol consumption (Rodd, Bell, Sable, Murphy & 
McBride, 2004; Sinclair & Senter, 1967). Although such findings are interesting, it must be 
noted that alcohol consumption in animals is devoid of the important cultural and 
psychosocial factors that influence people’s alcohol use (Babor, 2010; de Visser, Wheeler, 
Abraham & Smith, 2013; Szmigin, Bengry-Howell, Griffin, Hackley & Mistral, 2011). 
Furthermore, enforced abstinence in animal model studies may not be directly comparable to 
voluntarily participation in abstinence challenges such as “Dry January”. There is little 
evidence from studies of humans to conclusively support or rebut the notion that periods of 
voluntary abstinence will lead to “rebound effects” (Bray et al., 2010; Burish, Maisto, Cooper 
& Sobell, 1981; Carey, Carey & Maisto, 1988).  
To address the issues identified above, a longitudinal study was conducted with data 
collection at registration for Dry January, at the end of Dry January (one-month follow-up), 
and 6 months after the end of Dry January. Analyses addressed three hypotheses:  
1. Successfully completing Dry January would be predicted by previous completion of a 
month of abstinence; drinking less at baseline, intending to stop drinking after Dry January, 
 5 
 
 
 
greater DRSE at baseline, doing Dry January with a companion, and fundraising through Dry 
January; 
2. Successful completion of Dry January would lead to increases in DRSE that would lead to 
consequent reductions in alcohol intake;  
3. “Rebound effects” would be uncommon, but would be most likely among people who 
failed to complete Dry January. 
Method 
Participants 
The baseline sample consisted of 1070 men and 2722 women aged 18 years or older 
(range = 18-76, median = 41, mean = 40.7, sd = 11.6) who had registered on the Dry January 
website. Data from an additional 411 people were excluded from analysis: 11 respondents 
aged under 18 years; 10 people who had not consumed alcohol in the past year; 84 people 
who did not live in the UK; and 306 who did not complete the baseline questionnaire. One-
month follow-up data were provided by 1684 people (479 men, 1205 women; 44.4% of 
original eligible sample). Six-month follow-up data were provided by 857 people (249 men, 
608 women; 22.6% of original eligible sample). Only the 857 respondents who completed all 
three waves of data collection were included in analyses. 
Research Design 
The study employed a prospective longitudinal design. The research methods were 
approved by the host university Research Ethics Committee. All people who registered on the 
Dry January website were invited to take part via a link to the online survey, which was 
hosted on a secure server. The home page described the study rationale and methods and 
outlined consent and data protection procedures. Respondents were informed that by clicking 
“yes” to begin the survey they were confirming that they were over 18 and gave consent for 
their data to be used for research purposes, and to be contacted for two follow-up surveys. 
Upon completing the baseline survey, participants were asked to provide contact details so 
that they could be sent the URL for each of the follow-up surveys and be entered into a draw 
to win £100 in store vouchers. The link to the one-month follow-up questionnaire was sent on 
the first day of February, with reminders sent after 4 days and 8 days. The link to the 6-month 
follow-up questionnaire was sent in the first week of August (i.e., 6 months after the end of 
Dry January), with reminders sent after 4 days and 8 days. Data from the three waves of data 
collection were linked by unique ID codes.

Materials 
Baseline questionnaire. In addition to collecting demographic data, the questionnaire 
assessed the age at which participants first consumed alcohol (“Age first drink”). Participants 
indicated the longest period of abstinence from alcohol since their first drink (in days, 
months, and/or years), from which it was possible to create a dichotomous variable (“Dry 
month in the past”) that identified those who had ever completed a month of abstinence. 
Respondents completed the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT: 
Babor et al., 2001), which addresses three domains of alcohol use: consumption frequency 
and volume; dependence; and alcohol-related problems. The AUDIT assesses alcohol 
consumption frequency and volume with reference to usual behavior (with no time frame 
specified); the questions on alcohol dependence and alcohol-related problems are framed 
with reference to the last year and/or the lifetime. Scale scores were summed, with higher 
scores indicating a greater likelihood of harmful or hazardous drinking (“AUDIT score”). 
Attention was given to items assessing participants’ usual number of drinking days per week 
(“Drinking days per week”), and the number of drinks consumed on a typical drinking day 
(“Drinks per drinking day”). Because most of the AUDIT items are framed with reference to 
at least the last year, AUDIT scale scores were not suitable for use in analyses of change in 
behavior at 6-month follow-up. Respondents also reported the number of times in the last 
month that they got drunk (“Drunk episodes last month”). 
Drink Refusal Self-Efficacy was assessed via responses to nine items (Young et al., 1991) 
using 7-point scales (“very difficult” - “very easy”) introduced with the instruction “Please 
use the scale below to indicate how easy it would be for you to refuse alcohol in each 
situation”. The DRSE scale consists of three three-item subscales, each of which assesses a 
discrete domain of DRSE: social pressure (“DRSE - social”;  =.80; e.g., “When my friends 
are drinking”); emotional relief (“DRSE - emotional”;  =.90; e.g., “When I am worried”); 
and opportunistic drinking (“DRSE - opportunistic”;  =.83; e.g., “When I am watching 
TV”). Scores on these three subscales were significantly correlated, but not so strongly as to 
suggest collinearity (.33 ≤ rs ≤ .51, ps < .01).   
One dichotomous question assessed whether respondents were attempting Dry January 
with another person (“Dry January companion”). Respondents also indicated whether they 
were fundraising during Dry January (“Fundraising”). 
Respondents reported whether they intended to stop drinking, to drink less than before Dry 
 7 
 
 
 
January, to drink as much as before, or to drink more. Responses were used to make a 
dichotomous variable that identified respondents who intended to stop drinking permanently 
(“Plan to stop drinking”) 
One-month follow-up questionnaire. Respondents completed the three measures of 
DRSE, which were used to determine change in DRSE during Dry January. Changes in 
DRSE were calculated by subtracting scores at baseline from scores at one-month follow-up: 
difference scores above zero represented an increase in DRSE, difference scores of zero 
represented no change, and difference scores below zero represented a decrease in DRSE. 
Six-month follow-up questionnaire. In response to the question “How many days after 
registering for Dry January did you have your first alcohol-containing drink?”, participants 
indicated the number of days from the start of Dry January until they first consumed alcohol 
(in days, weeks, and/or months). Their responses were used to create a dichotomous variable 
that indicated whether they had successfully completed Dry January “completed Dry 
January”. They also completed the measures of alcohol consumption presented in the 
baseline questionnaire. Changes in alcohol consumption and DRSE were calculated by 
subtracting scores at baseline from scores at the 6-month follow-up questionnaire: difference 
scores above zero represented an increase in intake, difference scores of zero represented no 
change, and difference scores below zero represented a decrease in intake. 
Analytic plan 
Unless stated otherwise, all analyses were conducted in SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp., 
2012). Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to people who did not complete the 6-
month follow-up, those who did: were older, were more likely to have competed a dry month 
in the past, drank fewer drinks per drinking day, reported less frequent drunkenness, had 
lower AUDIT scores, and had greater social DRSE (details available from the first author). 
Propensity scores (Austin, 2011; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) were calculated to indicate the 
probability of completing the 6-month follow-up conditional on the variables listed in Table 
1. All analyses were conducted using survey weights calculated as the inverse of the 
propensity scores. Weighting on the basis of propensity scores was preferred to imputation of 
missing data given that most of the baseline sample were lost to follow-up and because data 
were not missing-at-random.  
The first hypothesis was tested by conducting analyses to identify variables measured at 
baseline that were bivariate correlates of successful completion of Dry January: t-tests for 
 8 
 
 
 
continuous independent variables, 2-tests for dichotomous variables. Those variables were 
then entered into linear regression to identify significant multivariate correlates of successful 
completion of Dry January. 
Hypothesis 2 was tested in two steps. First, repeated measures t-tests were conducted to 
assess within-subjects changes in DRSE between baseline and one-month follow-up, and 
within-subjects changes in alcohol intake between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Structural 
equation modelling (SEM) was then conducted to test whether participation in Dry January 
was related to changes in DRSE at one-month follow-up that affected alcohol intake at 6-
month follow-up. The SEM was conducted in order to simultaneously assess whether 
completion of Dry January had direct effects on subsequent alcohol use, and/or indirect 
effects mediated by changes in DRSE arising as a result of taking part in Dry January. The 
SEM was conducted using Mplus Version 7.3 (Muthén & Muthén, 2012). The distributions 
of “Drunk episodes last month” at both baseline and at 6-month follow-up were not 
symmetrical, with a modal frequency of zero at both time points. These two variables were 
treated these as count variables with negative binomial distributions, and the model estimated 
robust standard errors. 
The third hypothesis was assessed by comparing people who competed Dry January and 
those who did not in terms of the proportions of respondents who reported decreases, no 
change, or increases in the three alcohol intake variables between baseline and six-month 
follow-up. Because weighted data were used, the Rao-Scott 2 was employed with between-
cell differences identified by examining standardized residuals    
Results 
Correlates of Successful completion of Dry January 
Overall, 64.1% of respondents successfully completed Dry January, with similar 
proportions of men and women reporting success (Table 1). Compared to other participants, 
those who successfully completed Dry January consumed fewer drinks per typical drinking 
day, had a lower frequency of drunkenness, and had lower AUDIT scores. They also had 
significantly greater social and emotional DRSE. Logistic regression was conducted using 
forward selection of variables correlated with success at p < .10. This was replicated using 
backward deletion of variables. This process identified one significant independent predictor 
of likelihood of success which correctly classified 65% of participants as successful or not 
successful (2(1) = 18.10, p < .01). Success was significantly predicted by a lower frequency 
of drunkenness (OR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.90 – 0.96). 
 9 
 
 
 
Participation in Dry January and subsequent behavior 
Within-subjects tests revealed that participation in Dry January was related to significant 
increases in “DRSE - social” (t(856) = 10.11, p < .01), “DRSE - emotional” (t(856) = 8.60, p < 
.01), and “DRSE - opportunistic” (t(856) = 4.11, p < .01) at one-month follow-up. Participation 
in Dry January was also associated with significant reductions in drinking days per week 
(t(856) = 19.09, p < .01), drinks per typical drinking day (t(856) = 5.78, p < .01), and frequency 
of drunkenness (t(856) = 11.98, p < .01) at 6-month follow-up.  
The data in Table 2 show that among respondents who completed Dry January, there were 
significant increases in all three DRSE domains at one-month follow-up, and significant 
reductions in all three measures of alcohol intake at 6-month follow-up. Among participants 
who did not complete Dry January, there were significant increases in social and emotional 
DRSE at one-month follow-up, and significant reductions in drinking days per week, drinks 
per typical drinking day, and frequency of drunkenness at 6-month follow-up. 
Figure 1 shows the results of structural equation modelling of change in DRSE at one-
month follow-up and change in alcohol consumption at 6-month follow-up relative to 
baseline. The SEM revealed significant paths from baseline to one-month follow-up measures 
of all three domains of DRSE. It also revealed significant paths from baseline and 6-month 
follow-up measures of all three measures of alcohol intake. There were significant paths 
indicating that successful completion of Dry January led to increases in all three domains of 
DRSE. Success in Dry January was related to significant reductions in drinking days per 
week, drinks per drinking day, and frequency of drunkenness. In addition, increases in 
emotional DRSE during Dry January were related to significant reductions in frequency of 
drunkenness, and increases in opportunistic DRSE during Dry January were related to 
significant reductions in drinking days per week. Tests of the indirect effect of completing 
Dry January on the three measures of alcohol consumption via the three measures of DRSE 
revealed that none were significant (ps all > .09). 
“Rebound effects” among people who did not successfully complete Dry January 
The data in Table 3 show that a minority of participants experienced “rebound effects”. 
Completion of Dry January as not significantly related to the likelihood of rebound effects for 
drinking days per week or drinks per drinking day, but it was related to frequency of 
drunkenness. Examination of standardized residuals revealed that compared to participants 
who were successful in completing Dry January, those who were not successful were 
significantly less likely to report no change, and significantly more likely to report an 
 10 
 
 
 
increase in frequency of drunkenness at 6-month follow-up. When considering these 
significant differences, it should be noted that among the whole sample, only 11% had an 
increased frequency of drunkenness.  
Discussion 
The study reported here was the first large scale follow-up study of voluntary abstinence 
from alcohol. The findings identified key correlates of successful completion of a month of 
voluntary abstinence from alcohol as part of Alcohol Concern’s “Dry January” campaign, and 
described the consequences of a successful or unsuccessful attempt. A key finding was that 
even a failed attempt at Dry January led to many of the positive changes in behavior and 
DRSE observed in people who successfully completed Dry January.    
There was partial support for the first hypothesis. Successfully completing Dry January 
was predicted by more moderate alcohol consumption at baseline, and greater social DRSE at 
baseline. However, the predicted links between success and previous completion of a month 
of abstinence and doing Dry January with a companion were not found. The only significant 
independent multivariate predictor of success was a lower frequency of drunkenness at 
baseline. As expected, in bivariate analysis, success was also predicted by other measures of 
more moderate alcohol consumption at baseline (Norman, 2011; Norman & Conner, 2006; 
Norman et al., 2012; Zammit et al., 2008). As hypothesized, greater baseline DRSE predicted 
success in Dry January (Atwell et al., 2011; de Visser et al., 2014; Gilles et al., 2006; Oei & 
Jardim, 2007). However, this effect was only found for social DRSE, a finding that is perhaps 
not surprising given the important role of alcohol for social life in the UK (Babor, 2010; de 
Visser et al., 2013; Szmigin et al., 2011). The observed significant differences generally 
reflected small effect sizes. Contrary to expectations, social support in the form of a 
companion or “buddy” was not a significant predictor of success (Bauld et al., 2009; Olander 
et al., 2013). Nor was fundraising during Dry January, a finding that may perhaps be 
explained by the fact that all Dry January participants had already made a public commitment 
to behavior change by registering on the Dry January website (Cialdini, 2009; Festinger, 
1957). 
There was partial support for the second hypothesis: successful completion of Dry January 
was associated with increases in DRSE at one-month follow-up and reductions in alcohol 
intake at 6-month follow-up. The SEM suggested that successful completion of Dry January 
was related to increases in DRSE, and that increases in DRSE were related to lower alcohol 
consumption at 6-month follow-up. For people who successfully completed Dry January, 
 11 
 
 
 
there were significant reductions in all three measures of alcohol intake, and in all three 
DRSE domains. Among those who were unsuccessful, there were significant reductions in all 
three measures of alcohol intake, and in emotional DRSE. The SEM revealed significant 
direct paths from completion of Dry January to lower scores on all three measures of alcohol 
consumption at 6-month follow-up. This indicates that although alcohol consumption was 
reduced among all participants in Dry January, the reduction was greater among those who 
successfully completed the abstinence challenge. However, the Sobel tests of indirect paths 
from completion of Dry January to alcohol consumption via DRSE revealed that none were 
significant. For both successful and unsuccessful people, the observed significant differences 
generally reflected small-medium effect sizes. It therefore appears that successful completion 
of one month of abstinence may have lasting effects on drinking behavior and beliefs, and 
that increases in DRSE arising from abstinence attempts may be an important influence on 
subsequent patterns of alcohol use (Atwell et al., 2011; de Visser et al., 2014; Gilles et al., 
2006; Oei & Jardim 2007; Young et al., 1991). However, it is also important to note that even 
a failed attempt at Dry January led to many of the positive changes observed in people who 
successfully complete Dry January.   
The third hypothesis was supported: very few Dry January participants experienced 
“rebound effects” (Bray et al., 2010; Burish et al., 1981; Carey et al., 1988), and the 
proportions reporting increases in alcohol consumption were small: most participants 
reported decreases in all measures of alcohol consumption. Respondents whose attempt at 
Dry January was unsuccessful were more likely to report an increase in their frequency of 
drunkenness - the observed significant difference reflected a small-medium effect size. 
Whether in the context of temporary abstinence or longer term behavior change, there may be 
value in helping people to identify and manage tempting situations (de Visser et al., 2015; 
Hajek, Stead, West, Jarvis & Lancaster, 2009). 
Although this study has provided some valuable insights into correlates and consequences 
of completion of a month of abstinence from alcohol, it does have some limitations. The first 
is that people register for Dry January voluntarily, resulting in a self-selected sample that may 
not be representative of the general population. Indeed, the baseline sample contained a 
greater proportion of people with AUDIT scores indicative of harmful or hazardous drinking 
than the general population (McManus, Meltzer, Brugha, Bebbington & Jenkins, 2009). 
However, this apparent limitation may not be problematic if we only want to apply the 
findings to people like the study participants: i.e., heavier drinkers who are already in the 
 12 
 
 
 
“planning” and “action” phases of behavior change (Ansker, Helgason & Ahacic, 2014; 
Cadigan, Martens, Arterberry, Smith & Murphy, 2013; Prochaska, DiClemente & Norcross, 
1992). The final follow-up sample of 857 was less than one-quarter of the 3791 at baseline, 
and there were some important differences in alcohol intake between those who did and those 
who did not complete the 6-month follow-up: these issues were addressed by weighting the 
data for likelihood of completion of the 6-month follow-up survey. However, a lower attrition 
rate would have boosted confidence that the weighted analyses applied to the whole baseline 
sample. Another limitation is that the recruitment methods meant that it was not possible to 
compare Dry January participants who completed the baseline questionnaire to those who did 
not complete the baseline survey.  
The study was also limited by the absence of a control group. This meant that it was not 
possible to determine whether the observed reductions in alcohol consumption also occurred 
among people who did not register for Dry January. However, it should be noted that changes 
toward healthier behavior were greatest in people who successfully completed Dry January, 
suggesting that success in Dry January added to any population-level changes. It should also 
be noted that significant changes in DRSE would be unlikely to occur in the general 
population in the absence of an intervention. Indeed, the SEM provided some evidence that 
increases in DRSE during Dry January helped to explain subsequent reductions in alcohol 
intake. Nevertheless, a study with a control group would provide more robust evidence of any 
effects related to successful and unsuccessful attempts at Dry January. A further limitation 
was the reliance on self-report and recall of alcohol use (Del Boca & Darkes, 2003). 
However, any recall biases would have affected all participants equally, and would not have 
been a source of bias in within-subjects analyses  
This study of participants in the “Dry January” alcohol abstinence challenge revealed that 
successful completion of Dry January was best predicted by more moderate drinking at 
baseline. Participation in Dry January was related to reductions in alcohol consumption and 
increases in DRSE among all respondents, regardless of success, but these changes were 
larger among people who successfully completed the challenge. Rebound effects were 
uncommon, but were more likely among those who did not complete Dry January. Taken 
together, these findings suggest that abstinence challenges such as Dry January can lead to 
changes toward healthier drinking and health-enhancing beliefs about alcohol, and are 
unlikely to result in undesirable rebound effects.
