background/aim In high-level Olympic athletes, 
many spinal pathologies arise from overuse, while others 
are the result of acute injury. Our aim is to analyse the 
epidemiology of spinal pathologies detected on MRI in 
athletes participating in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer 
Olympics.
Methods In this retrospective study, all spine MRIs 
performed during the 2016 Rio Games were analysed. 
Descriptive data from the MRIs were tabulated and 
analysed for disc degeneration, spinal canal and/or neural 
foraminal narrowing, and acute/chronic fractures. Data 
were analysed by sport, continent of origin, age and sex.
results Of 11 274 athletes participating in the Olympic 
games, 100 received spine MRI. Fifty-two of the 100 (52%) 
athletes who received cervical, thoracic and/or lumbar 
spine MRI showed moderate to severe spinal disease. The 
highest sport-specific incidence of moderate to severe 
spine disease was seen in aquatic diving athletes (67%, 
3 per 100 divers). Weightlifting had the second highest 
sport-specific incidence of spine disease (67%, 1.5 per 
100 weightlifters). Athletics used the most spine MRIs (31 
of 107 MRIs, 29%). European athletes had more spine 
MRIs than all other continents combined (55 of 107 MRIs, 
51%). Athletes over 30 years old had the highest rate 
of moderate to severe spine disease on MRI (24 of 37 
athletes >30 years old, 65%). 
Conclusions A high number of the world’s premier 
athletes demonstrated moderate to severe spine disease 
on MRI during the 2016 Summer Olympics, including 
moderate/severe degenerative disc changes with varying 
degrees of disc bulges and herniations.
InTroduCTIon
The 2016 Summer Olympics were hosted by 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 
21 August 2016. 
A total of 11 274 athletes from 207 National 
Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 
28 sports and 306 sporting events.1
Overall, 1101 injuries in 8% of the athletes 
were reported during the Games.2 The inci-
dence of injury was lower than at other recent 
Olympics: 10% at the 2008 Beijing Games, 
11% at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olym-
pics, 11% at the 2012 London Games and 
12% at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.2–6 
Forty per cent of the injuries were estimated 
to be severe enough to limit competition or 
training.2 Of these, 71% occurred acutely, 
whereas 27% were secondary to overuse.2 The 
three most commonly reported mechanisms 
of injury were contact with another athlete, 
non-contact trauma and overuse injury with 
gradual onset.2
MRI is especially useful to evaluate soft 
tissue and ligamentous injuries and to eval-
uate for bone marrow oedema and contusion 
in the spine. Loss of disc signal intensity, loss 
of disc height and presence of disc displace-
ment are most commonly seen at the L5–S1 
level.7 These pathologies are easily detected 
on MRI.
The purpose of this study is to investigate 
the various pathologies that affect the spine 
in high-level athletes by evaluating the MRIs 
What are the new findings?
 
► Fifty-two moderate to severe spine injuries were 
reported on spine MRI during the Rio de Janeiro 
2016 Summer Olympic Games, with the highest 
incidence of spine injuries seen in women and 
in athletes over 30 years old.
 
► While athletics used spine MRI the most of any sport, 
diving had the highest sport-specific incidence of 
moderate to severe spinal pathology.
 
► Most moderate to severe spine injuries seen in 
the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympic Games 
involved the lumbar spine.
How might it impact clinical practice in the near 
future?
 
► Recognition of the high number of moderate to 
severe spine injuries occurring in Olympic-calibre 
athletes may lead to spine-conscious training, 
routines and manoeuvres during competition in 
order to prevent the development and progression of 
acute and chronic spinal pathologies.

of the spine in athletes who participated in the 2016 Rio 
Summer Olympics.  
MeTHods
This is a retrospective analysis of the patient informa-
tion from the IOC athlete database and imaging data 
from the Radiological Information System and Picture 
Archiving Communications System of the Rio Summer 
Olympics. Medical and imaging services were open for 
32 days including from the opening of the Olympic 
Village on 24 July 2016 to its closing on 24 August 2016. 
NOC medical teams reported the daily occurrence (or 
non-occurrence) of injuries on a standardised medical 
report form. We retrieved the same information on all 
athletes treated for injuries in the polyclinic and all other 
medical venues by the medical staff of the Rio Organising 
Committee. We used the athlete accreditation number to 
control for injuries treated by both groups. With dupli-
cates, we retained the NOC data. Our study and intent 
to publish the data were approved by the IOC (R2C10).
Confidentiality and ethical approval
Our retrospective study was reviewed by the Medical 
Research Ethics Committee of the South-Eastern Norway 
Regional Health Authority and was exempted from 
Ethics Committee approval. Informed consent was 
waived since all data in our epidemiological study were 
anonymised and unidentifiable. We obtained approval 
from the IOC to use anonymised imaging and demo-
graphic data for publication. An additional institutional 
review board (IRB) approval was obtained from Boston 
University. Data were collected, stored and analysed in 
strict compliance with data protection and athlete confi-
dentiality.
data collection
Diagnostic imaging was performed through the official 
IOC polyclinic within the Olympic Village, using 3T 
Discovery MR750w and 1.5T Optima 450MRw MRI scan-
ners (all machines from GE Healthcare, Brazil). Protocols 
consisted of three planes of acquisition in the sagittal 
plane for the cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral spine 
which included T1-weighted, T2-weighted and short tau 
inversion recovery. There were two planes of acquisition 
in the axial plane for the cervical and lumbar spine with 
two-dimensional multiple echo recombined gradient 
echo (2D MERGE) and isotropic 3D CUBE T2-weighted 
for the cervical spine and T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
for the lumbar spine. For the thoracic spine, there was 
only one axial plane consisting of 2D MERGE.
Imaging interpretation
All cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral spine MRI exam-
inations performed were independently reviewed and all 
spine pathologies were documented by a board-certified 
neuroradiologist (AZM) with 13 years of experience in 
orthopaedic and traumatic spine injuries assessment. For 
the purposes of this study, a positive spine MRI was defined 
as demonstrating moderate to severe disc degeneration 
(Pfirrmann grade IV or V), canal or neural foraminal 
narrowing.8 These findings were considered chronic 
spine pathology. Muscle injury, ligamentous injury and 
vertebral compression deformity with bone marrow 
oedema were considered acute spinal pathology. Muscle 
and ligamentous injuries were defined as these soft tissues 
demonstrating hyperintensity on the T2-weighted fat-sup-
pressed images.9 Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis with 
and without bone marrow oedema/stress reaction of the 
pars interarticularis were considered acute and chronic 
spine pathology, respectively.
The Pfirrmann classification system is used to grade 
lumbar disc degeneration.10 In this system, a T2-weighted 
sequence is used to grade lumbar disc degeneration. In 
grades I–III, disc height is normal. The disc is homoge-
neous in grade I but is heterogeneous in grade II. The 
distinction between the nucleus and annulus becomes 
unclear in grade III. There is inhomogeneous disc signal 
with height mildly to moderately decreased in grade IV. 
In grade V, the disc space is collapsed. In this study, these 
criteria were extended to the evaluation of the cervical 
and thoracic spine. Additionally, we considered Pfirr-
mann’s grades I–III as mild degenerative disc disease 
since there was no loss of disc space height. Pfirrmann’s 
grade IV was considered moderate due to reduced disc 
space height and grade V was considered severe due to 
collapsed disc space.
resulTs
demographics and spine MrI utilisation
Table 1 shows the incidence of all positive spine MRIs 
stratified by sport. The 2016 Rio Games had 11 274 
athletes participating, 100 of whom (0.9%) received an 
MRI of the spine during the Olympics. Fifty-two of these 
athletes (52%) had positive spine pathology on imaging. 
Five athletes had more than one spine MRI, including 
two who had cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine MRIs, 
two who had cervical and lumbar spine MRIs and one 
who had cervical and thoracic spine MRIs. In total, 107 
spine MRIs were performed.
Positive spine MRI findings included moderate/
severe disc degeneration (Pfirrmann’s classification type 
IV or V), moderate/severe spinal canal and/or neural 
foraminal narrowing, muscle injury, ligamentous injury, 
spondylolysis, vertebral fracture or pars interarticularis 
oedema.
Table 2 stratifies the spine MRIs by event and shows 
that athletics had the highest use of spine MRI. Thirty 
of the 80 (38%) lumbar spine MRIs were for athletes 
participating in athletics. Judo had the second highest 
utilisation of spine MRIs with six lumbar spine MRIs and 
three cervical spine MRIs. Gymnastics, diving, boxing 
and weightlifting each accounted for more than six spine 
MRIs.
There were no spine MRIs acquired in aquatics—open 
water swimming, aquatics—synchronised swimming, 
basketball, 
canoe—slalom, 
cycling—BMX

pentathlon or taekwondo.
Table 3 shows the incidence of positive spine MRIs 
stratified by sport in the 5089 female athletes. Fifty-five 
(1.1%) received a spinal MRI during the Games and 25 
(45%) of the MRIs showed moderate to severe spinal 
pathology. Sports with the highest number of positive 
spinal MRIs in female athletes (excluding sports with 
only one MRI) included judo (1 of 2, 50%), athletics 
(11 of 22, 50%), weightlifting (2 of 3, 67%) and hockey 
(2 of 2, 100%).
Table 3 shows the incidence of positive spine MRIs strat-
ified by sport in the 6185 male athletes. Forty-five (0.7%) 
received a spinal MRI during the Games, and 26 (58%) 
of the MRIs showed moderate to severe spinal pathology. 
Sports with the highest number of positive spinal MRIs 
in male athletes (excluding sports with only one MRI) 
included athletics (4 of 9, 44%), swimming (1 of 2, 50%), 
judo (4 of 6, 67%), weightlifting (2 of 3, 67%), tennis (2 
of 2, 100%), diving (2 of 2, 100%) and wrestling (2 of 2, 
100%).
Table 4 shows that of 107 MRIs acquired, 55 (51%) 
were performed on European athletes, the most of 
any continent. European athletes accounted for 37 of 
82 (45%) lumbar spine MRIs, 12 of 21 (57%) cervical 
spine MRIs and all 6 (100%) of the thoracic spine MRIs. 
Africa (19, 18%), the Americas (16, 15%), Asia (12, 
11%) and Oceania (5, 5%) had the next highest util-
isation of spine MRI during the Olympics. Athletes on 
the Refugee Olympic Team had no MRIs of the spine.
Online supplementary table S1 shows the incidence of 
positive spine MRIs stratified by sport in the 611 athletes 
less than 20 years old. Seven (1.15%) received a spinal 
MRI during the Games, and only one (14%) showed

moderate to severe spinal pathology. The one athlete less 
than 20 years old who received a spine MRI participated 
in weightlifting and demonstrated moderate/severe disc 
disease at L5–S1, disc protrusions at L4–5 and L5–S1 and 
mild spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis at these 
levels.
Online supplementary table S1 also shows the inci-
dence of positive spine MRIs stratified by sport in the 
7753 athletes between the ages of 20–29 years old. Fifty-six 
(0.7%) received a spinal MRI and 27 (48%) of the MRIs 
showed moderate to severe spinal pathology. The sports 
with the highest number of MRIs with moderate to severe 
spinal pathology in this age group included athletics (10 
of 21, 48%), diving (3 of 5, 60%), weightlifting (2 of 2, 
100%) and judo (2 of 4, 50%).
Online supplementary table S1 shows the incidence of 
positive spine MRIs stratified by sport in the 2910 athletes 
over 30 years old. Thirty-seven (1.27%) received a spinal 
MRI and 24 (65%) of the MRIs showed moderate to severe 
spinal pathology. The sports with the highest number of 
MRIs with moderate to severe spinal pathology in this age 
group included athletics (5 of 9, 56%), judo (3 of 4, 75%) 
and handball (2 of 2, 100%).
Chronic spinal pathology
Thirty-seven of the 107 spine MRIs (35%) performed 
demonstrated moderate to severe degenerative disc 
disease per the Pfirrmann classification system (types IV 
and V degenerative disc disease) (figure 1). Thirty-one 
of the 37 (84%) spine MRIs with moderate to severe 
degenerative disc disease were of the lumbar spine, 
while 6 (16%) were of the cervical spine. No athletes 
receiving MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrated 
moderate or severe degenerative disc disease. Athletics 
accounted for the majority of the positive scans that 
showed moderate to severe degenerative disc disease, 
with 12 of the 30 (40%) athletes having positive lumbar 
spine MRIs.
Ten of the spine MRIs (9%) demonstrated moderate to 
severe canal narrowing (figure 1). Six of the 10 (60%) scans 
were of the lumbar spine, while four (40%) were of the 
cervical spine. Sports with spine MRIs showing moderate 
to severe canal narrowing with only two lumbar MRIs were 
athletics and weightlifting, while those with only one MRI 
were judo, rugby, water polo, boxing, sailing and tennis. 
Many of these sports involve physical contact.
Similarly, 14 of the spine MRIs (13%) demonstrated 
moderate to severe neural foraminal narrowing, 
including 7 lumbar MRIs and 7 cervical MRIs. Sports with 
positive spine MRIs showing moderate to severe neural 
foraminal narrowing included athletics (four lumbar 
MRIs), judo (two cervical MRIs), wrestling (two cervical 
MRIs) and those with one lumbar MRI each were diving, 
rugby, weightlifting, hockey, sailing and shooting.
One male athlete in athletics had a chronic wedge 
fracture at T12 seen on lumbar spine MRI. One male 
swimmer had a syrinx at C6.
Acute spine pathology
Four lumbar spine MRIs (4 of 107, 4%) demonstrated 
acute/subacute stress reaction. One female athlete in 
handball had vertebral body stress reaction at L2. Two 
athletes had severe endplate stress reaction, including a 
male athlete in athletics with stress reaction at L3–L4 and 
a female athlete in rugby with stress reaction at L4–L5. 
The male athlete with stress reaction at L3–L4 also had 
a large Schmorl node at L4. One female weightlifter had 
right pars interarticularis stress reaction at L5.
There were two stress reactions, including one in the 
L4 pedicle of an athlete in athletics and one in the L5 
pars interarticularis of a weightlifter.
Four of the MRIs (4%) of female athletes had spon-
dylolysis, including a football player with two levels of 
involvement at L4 and L5. The other three had spondy-
lolysis at a single level, one at L3 and the others at L5. 
Two of these athletes had grade I anterolisthesis. The 
athlete with spondylolysis at L3 also had grade I/II anter-
olisthesis (online supplementary figure S1).

Five of the spine MRIs (5%) showed acute/subacute 
muscle injuries. All these injuries occurred in female 
athletes. Psoas muscle injury was seen in athletics. Two 
unilateral posterior paraspinal muscle injuries were seen 
in judo and athletics. Two bilateral posterior paraspinal 
muscle injuries were detected in cycling and volleyball.
dIsCussIon
A significant number of the athletes were found to have 
advanced spinal disease, with 52 of the 100 athletes (52%) 
who had spine MRI demonstrating moderate to severe 
spinal pathology. Therefore, approximately 1 athlete per 
200 individuals participating in the 2016 Summer Olympics

had advanced spine disease on MRI. Mild degenerative 
changes were not included in this study; a conservative 
approach was used for the evaluation.
At the 2012 London Games, 1283 diagnostic and inter-
ventional procedures were performed, including 674 
MRIs of which 104 were of the spine.11 Although more 
athletes participated in the 2016 Rio Games, only 607 
MRIs were performed,1 but the number of spine MRIs 
was slightly higher at 107.
rate and incidence of pathology by sport
While athletes participating in athletics had the highest 
overall use of spinal MRI (31 athletes), aquatic diving had 
the highest sport-specific rates of spinal pathology, with 
one positive study per 33 divers (135 divers, four MRIs). 
This increased rate was seen in female and male aquatic 
divers alike. All spinal pathologies detected in divers 
involved the lumbar spine, with Pfirrmann grade IV or 
V degenerative disc disease and/or moderate to severe 
neural foraminal narrowing detected.10 The nature of 
these pathologies is likely chronic and may be related 
to the repetitive contortion, bending and twisting of the 
lumbar spine that a diver must perform while plunging 
3–10 m into the water.
Weightlifting had the second highest sport-specific rate 
of spinal pathology, with one positive case per 63 weight-
lifters (256 weightlifters, four MRIs). All positive studies 
seen in weightlifters were of the lumbar spine. Pfirrmann 
grade IV or V degenerative disc disease and/or moderate 
to severe canal narrowing were the most common spinal 
pathologies.10 Spinal stenosis can lead to a wide variety 
of neurological disorders. These pathologies are likely 
chronic in nature and may be secondary to lifting tech-
nique. Adequate precautions by focusing on improved 
training and lifting techniques should be considered to 
prevent this type of spinal pathology.
Other sports with notable spinal pathologies include 
judo (390 athletes) and athletics (2367 athletes). Five of 
the judo participants, or nearly 1 in 77, and 15 of those 
in athletics, or 1 in 167, had moderate to severe spinal 
pathology. Judo involves throwing and striking oppo-
nents, which may lead to overuse issues and trauma for 
the athlete. Athletics involves speed and strength with 
significant risk of overuse and acute injuries.
rate and incidence of pathology by age
Athletes over 30 years old had higher rates of moderate 
to severe spinal pathology on MRI, with 1 athlete per 
120 (24 out of 2910) demonstrating moderate to severe 
spinal disease. One athlete per 333 (27 out of 7753) 
between 20 and 29 years of age demonstrated moderate 
to severe spinal pathology. Only 1 of the 611 athletes 
under 20 years of age demonstrated moderate to severe 
spinal pathology. As previous studies have demonstrated, 
high-level athletes are more commonly affected by disc 
degeneration than non-athletes.12 The increased rate 
with age is likely the result of accumulation and progres-
sion of chronic injuries; however, these athletes may be 
prone to more acute injuries as well.
The lumbar spine was the most frequently imaged 
portion of the spine on MRI, accounting for 80 of the 
107 spine MRIs. The highest number of positive lumbar 
spine studies was seen in athletics, with 12 athletes 
demonstrating Pfirrmann grade IV or V degenerative 
disc disease, 2 demonstrating moderate to severe canal 
narrowing and 4 demonstrating moderate to severe 
neural foraminal narrowing. Neural foraminal stenosis 
can lead to radiculopathy, with nerve compression and 
increasing pain symptoms.
European athletes had more spinal MRIs during the 
Rio Games than the rest of the world combined. There 
are likely many factors influencing this disproportionate 
utilisation of spinal MRI, but most likely it is the result of 
the medical staff and trainers’ input into who is scanned.
Acute spine pathologies, such as stress reaction oedema 
and muscle injury, were more commonly seen in female 
than male athletes. While there is no clear explanation 
for this predominance, all of these injuries involved the 
lumbar region, suggesting that chronic pathologies of the 
lumbar spine may first start as other injuries and progress 
to degenerative changes.
One question is how elite athletes, such as those partic-
ipating in the Olympics, can compete at the highest level 
with the kind of severe spinal pathology seen in our study. 
A previous study found that athletes with low back pain 
perceive less impairment compared with non-athletes.13 
Perhaps, elite athletes have different coping mechanisms 
for pain to endure the demands of elite competition in 
which they place their body at risk for acute or overuse 
injury.
Spinal disease was detected at single time points during 
the Olympics, but neither prior studies nor follow-up 
imaging were available to determine acuity versus chro-
nicity of several of the spinal pathologies identified. Lack of 
clinical correlation is also a limitation. Another limitation is 
that we do not know if other athletes had spine injuries and 
did not come to the IOC imaging facility for MRI.
Figure 1   MRI of a female rugby player in her 
30s demonstrates Pfirrmann type IV degenerative disc 
changes at L4–L5 with endplate oedema (arrowheads) and 
a disc protrusion (arrow) seen on the sagittal and axial T2-
weighted images (A, B), contributing to moderate to severe 
canal narrowing.

ConClusIons
A significant number of athletes demonstrated advanced 
spinal disease on MRI during the 2016 Summer Olym-
pics in Rio de Janeiro, with approximately 1 athlete per 
200 demonstrating moderate to severe spinal pathology. 
The lumbar spine was the most commonly affected site 
of disease. Many of the Olympic sports rely on strength, 
speed, force, bending and twisting. Even with excellent 
preparation and training, the spine is at risk for moderate 
to severe injury. The highest rates of spine injury were 
seen in women and athletes over 30 years old. Recogni-
tion of these risks is important, as there should be efforts 
to avoid the long-term sequelae of spinal pathology. 
Spine-conscious training, routines and manoeuvres are 
recommended to prevent the development and progres-
sion of these acute and chronic spinal pathologies. Our 
hope is to better direct injury prevention strategies in 
future Olympic games.
