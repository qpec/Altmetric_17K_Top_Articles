Animal-to-Human Dose Translation of Obiltoxaximab
for Treatment of Inhalational Anthrax Under the US FDA
Animal Rule
CF Nagy1,∗, J Mondick2, N Serbina3, LS Casey3, SE Carpenter3, J French2 and R Guttendorf4
Obiltoxaximab, a monoclonal antibody against protective antigen (PA), is approved for treatment of inhalational anthrax under
the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Animal Rule. The human dose was selected and justified by comparing observed
obiltoxaximab exposures in healthy and infected New Zealand White rabbits and cynomolgus macaques to observed exposures
in healthy humans, to simulated exposures in healthy and infected humans, and to serum PA levels in infected animals. In
humans, at 16 mg/kg intravenous, obiltoxaximab AUC was >2 times that in animals, while maximum serum concentrations
were comparable to those in animals and were maintained in excess of the concentration required for PA neutralization in
infected animals for 2–3 weeks. Obiltoxaximab 16 mg/kg in humans provided exposure beyond that of 16 mg/kg in animals,
ensuring a sufficient duration of PA neutralization to allow for adaptive immunity development.Our approach to dose translation
may be applicable to other agents being developed under the Animal Rule.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?
✔ Drug approval under the FDA’
s “Animal Rule” is rare and
obiltoxaximab is the second monoclonal antibody devel-
oped under this pathway. There is a paucity of knowledge
on the approaches to human dose selection for products
whose efficacy cannot be tested in human clinical trials.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
✔ Selection of the human dose of obiltoxaximab for the
treatment of inhalational anthrax.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE
✔ Our study shows an approach and provides sound justi-
fication that a 16 mg/kg dose of obiltoxaximab will produce
clinical benefit in the treatment of humans with inhalational
anthrax.
HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOL-
OGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
✔ Our approach could help guide human dose selection
for other products being developed under the “Animal
Rule.”
Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by Bacil-
lus
anthracis,
a
Gram-positive,
aerobic,
encapsulated,
endospore-forming,
toxin-producing,
rod-shaped
bac-
terial pathogen.1,2
The incidence of naturally acquired
anthrax is rare; however, B. anthracis spores are readily
bioweaponized.3,4 Bacillus anthracis has been identified as a
top-priority, Category A biowarfare threat by the US Depart-
ment of Homeland Security because it can be easily spread
and causes severe illness or death.5 In 2001, the intentional
delivery of B. anthracis spores through the US Postal Service
resulted in 22 cases of anthrax disease (11 inhalational, 11
cutaneous). Of those who developed inhalational anthrax,
five (45%) died despite appropriate, aggressive care.6
Obiltoxaximab is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1(κ) mono-
clonal antibody (mAb) that binds and neutralizes protective
antigen (PA), which plays a central role in anthrax toxin
assembly and target cell intoxication.7,8 Since definitive

human efficacy studies with B. anthracis are not ethical and
field trials to study effectiveness have not been feasible,
obiltoxaximab was developed under the US Food and Drug
Administration’
s (FDA) Animal Rule regulations (21 CFR
601.90), under which a drug can be approved using efficacy
studies in animals and safety studies in healthy humans.
For the Animal Rule to apply, four criteria need to be met:
i) a reasonably well-understood pathophysiological mech-
anism of the toxicity of the substance and its prevention
or substantial reduction by the product; ii) the effect is
demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to
react with a response predictive for humans; iii) the animal
study end point is clearly related to the desired benefit in
humans; and iv) the data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
pharmacodynamics (PD) of the product or other relevant
data or information, in animals and humans, allows selection
of an effective dose in humans.9,10
 Obiltoxaximab Dose for Anthrax Treatment

Obiltoxaximab has been extensively studied in both
humans and animals. Human PK data from five con-
trolled studies in over 500 healthy volunteers demonstrated
that obiltoxaximab exposure increased proportionally with
dose, had a half-life of 17–23 days, and that it was safe
and generally well-tolerated.11 The animal models (New
Zealand White (NZW) rabbits and cynomolgus macaques)
for investigating anthrax disease progression after inhala-
tional exposure to anthrax spores are well established
and correlate well with the pathophysiology of the dis-
ease manifested in humans.12–14 A series of randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging, trigger-to-
treat studies in which obiltoxaximab was administered as
an intravenous (i.v.) bolus to NZW rabbits and cynomolgus
macaques were conducted to describe the PD and efficacy
of obiltoxaximab. The results demonstrated the survival effi-
cacy of obiltoxaximab at 16 mg/kg.15
Obiltoxaximab pharmacological activity is based on neu-
tralization of circulating PA.8,16,17 During the course of inhala-
tional anthrax, bacteremia and toxemia correlate18 and are
reasonable measures of disease progression.19,20 In animal
treatment studies, obiltoxaximab administration resulted in
serum PA concentrations below the lower limit of assay
quantification (<9.68 ng/mL) at the earliest posttreatment
time point measured (as early as 15 min in some studies) in
both surviving and nonsurviving animals.15
This report describes our approach for the selection and
justification of the clinical dose of obiltoxaximab for treat-
ment of inhalational anthrax in humans based on transla-
tion of efficacy, PK, and PD data from healthy and infected
animal studies to humans using observed data and sim-
ulations based on validated population PK and survival
models.11,15
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study designs and treatments
Animal pharmacokinetic studies
Two NZW rabbit studies (one each in unexposed and B.
anthracis-infected animals) and five cynomolgus macaque
studies (one in unexposed and four in infected animals) were
included (Table 1). In the healthy animal studies, cynomolgus
macaques younger than 5 years (Covance, Alice, TX) and
pathogen-free NZW rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA) were
administered single doses of obiltoxaximab (3, 10, or 30
mg/kg i.v. or 10 mg/kg intramuscular (i.m.)). Similarly, in treat-
ment studies cynomolgus macaques younger than 5 years
weighing 2.7–7.3 kg prior to challenge and pathogen-free
NZW rabbits weighing 2.9–4.0 kg prior to challenge were
utilized in randomized, blinded, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled studies conducted in accordance with Good
Laboratory Practice regulations (21 CFR Part 58).12,15,21
Animals were exposed to aerosolized B. anthracis (Ames)
spores (target 200 LD50), and obiltoxaximab was initiated
at doses of 1–32 mg/kg i.v. based on the appearance of
a significant increase in body temperature (rabbits only),21
or a positive serum PA signal. Body temperature and PA
via electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay were assessed
as previously described.15 A significant increase in body
temperature was defined as a �2 standard deviation (SD)
increase from baseline either three consecutive times or two
consecutive times twice. Serum samples were tested for
the presence of PA every 6 h starting 18–24 h after spore
exposure. Positive results in a PA-ECL assay (�2 ng/mL
for macaques and �1 ng/mL for rabbits) were used as a
trigger threshold. If neither was observed, obiltoxaximab
was administered at a predetermined time point after spore
challenge (rabbits 72 h, macaques 54 h).15
Studies in spore-exposed animals were conducted at Bat-
telle Biomedical Research Center (BBRC, West Jefferson,
OH) in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C.
§2131) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.22 BBRC is accredited by the Association for the
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International, and each study protocol was reviewed and
approved by the facility Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. All procedures in infected animals were per-
formed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory registered with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and inspected by
the US Departments of Defense and Agriculture. Studies in
unexposed rabbits were conducted at Ricerca Biosciences
(Concord, OH); studies in unexposed macaques were con-
ducted at MPI Research (Mattawan, MI).
Sample
collection
in
animals
for
pharmacokinetic
assessments
Blood samples were obtained from a femoral artery or vein,
saphenous vein, or other appropriate vein in macaques and
from the venous access port (VAP) or medial ear artery if VAP
was not patent in rabbits over a predetermined time course.
Additional blood samples were collected for analysis of free
serum PA concentrations in infected animals in rabbit Study
2 and macaque Studies 2–5 following challenge with anthrax
spores and after treatment with obiltoxaximab or placebo
as described elsewhere.15 Serum was separated, filtered to
sterilize, and kept frozen (–80°C to –70°C) until analyzed for
obiltoxaximab or PA concentrations.
Human pharmacokinetic studies
The
study
protocols,
including
all
amendments,
were
approved by the investigational review boards at each study
site, and the studies were conducted in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice, the ethical principles that have their
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, The Belmont Report, Title
21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (Parts 50, 56,
and 312), Title 45 of the CFR (Part 46), the International Con-
ference on Harmonisation (ICH) (E6), and any applicable reg-
ulatory requirements. Written informed consent was obtained
from each subject prior to performing any evaluations. Obil-
toxaximab doses from 120 mg to 16 mg/kg i.v. were inves-
tigated in four clinical studies in healthy human subjects
(Table 1). The PK results from three studies (Studies 2–4) in
which healthy human subjects received obiltoxaximab by i.v.
infusion over 90 min (4, 8, or 16 mg/kg) were used in compar-
ative exposure analyses (Table 1). The study methods have
been described in detail previously.11
Assays
Serum samples were assayed for free obiltoxaximab con-
centrations using validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) methods for macaques and humans and an

and humans have been described previously,11,23 and the
ECL method for rabbits is detailed in the Appendix. Assays
for PA have been previously described.15
Population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation
and survival modeling
Population PK and survival analyses were conducted via
nonlinear mixed-effects modeling using NONMEM software,
v. 7, Level 2.0 (ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD).
PK data from 10 studies (two studies in rabbits (Studies 1
and 2), five studies in macaques (Studies 1–5), and three
studies in healthy humans (Studies 1–3)) were used for pop-
ulation PK model fitting (Table 1). The combined data set
consisted of 791, 929, and 2,830 observations for rabbits,
macaques, and humans, respectively. For nonclinical mod-
eling, PK models were simultaneously fit to healthy and
infected animal data to describe disease effects on PK. Visual
predictive checks were performed to evaluate the suitabil-
ity of the population PK models for predicting obiltoxaximab
exposures.
Survival analyses using data from infected animal studies
(rabbit Study 2 and cynomolgus macaque Studies 2–5) were
performed to characterize the obiltoxaximab dose–response
relationship. It was determined that a parametric cure-rate
model, which explicitly incorporates a fraction of animals that
survive beyond the end of the study, was preferable to a stan-
dard parametric time-to-event model. To explain differences
in survival across studies and between animals in the same
study, the effects of dose (mg/kg), prior-to-treatment (PTT)
quantitative bacteremia, and species (rabbit vs. macaque) on
the survival function were investigated.
Following i.v. administration in animals, variability in obil-
toxaximab exposure was low within dose groups. Therefore,
obiltoxaximab doses did not yield a wide range of exposures
within dose groups. An exposure–response model relating
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to survival
was developed as part of the initial modeling analysis. The
results were consistent with the dose–response analysis,
leading to identical inferences regarding obiltoxaximab dos-
ing in humans.
To account for target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD),
which was not included in the human population PK model

since the PA binding target only exists in infected subjects,
and predict obiltoxaximab exposures in infected humans, the
nonlinear clearance model component from the cynomol-
gus macaque model was added to the human population PK
model, allometrically scaled to human body size.
Simulations were performed for 500 typical human sub-
jects (weight = 75 kg) administered a single 16 mg/kg obil-
toxaximab dose for healthy and infected populations, for
comparative analysis of obiltoxaximab disposition in differ-
ent groups and across species.
Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses in animal
studies
PK parameters were derived by noncompartmental methods
using Phoenix WinNonlin v. 5.2 or higher (Pharsight, Moun-
tain View, CA). Maximum concentration (Cmax) and time of
maximum concentration (Tmax) were observed values. The
terminal-phase rate constant (k) was determined by log-
linear regression and half-life (t1/2) was calculated as ln(2)/k.
AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method over the
first 48 h postdose (AUC0-48hr) and from time 0 to Tlast, the
time of the last measurable serum obiltoxaximab concen-
tration (AUC0-last); AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) was
calculated as AUC0-last + Clast/k, where Clast is the concen-
tration at Tlast. Systemic clearance (CL) was calculated as
dose divided by AUC0-inf. Volume of distribution at steady
state (Vss) was calculated as CL*MRT (mean residence time).
Infected animals that were sacrificed prior to scheduled ter-
mination were designated as having “died” or as “nonsur-
vivors.” Obiltoxaximab PK parameters were determined for
infected animals, including nonsurvivors, where the data
permitted, and only reported for animals with measurable
obiltoxaximab serum concentrations at �3 postdose time
points. Obiltoxaximab Cmax and AUC values were compared
in unexposed animals, infected animals that survived, and
infected animals that did not survive.
Neutralization of protective antigen
Obiltoxaximab concentrations required to ensure 99% or
99.9% neutralization of PA in both simulated healthy and
infected human subjects were determined, based on the fol-
lowing equation (using Kd = 0.33 nM and MW = 148 kDa)
(24):
%Bound = 100 ∗ (Kd−1ConcObil)/(1 + Kd−1ConcObil).
Statistical analyses
Quantitative variables were summarized using descriptive
statistics, including n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of
variation (CV%), median, minimum, and maximum values.
Geometric mean was included for PK parameters, where
applicable.
RESULTS
Animal and human population pharmacokinetic
modeling
The final macaque and rabbit structural PK models con-
sisted of a two-compartment model parameterized in terms
of CL, central volume of distribution (Vc), peripheral vol-
ume of distribution (Vp), and intercompartmental clearance
(Q). Absorption kinetics following i.m. administration were
described by a first-order absorption rate (ka) and bioavail-
ability (F1). TMDD in infected NZW rabbits and cynomol-
gus macaques was approximated via parallel nonlinear elim-
ination for infected animals only, parameterized in terms of
maximum velocity (Vmax) and obiltoxaximab concentration
to reach half-maximum velocity (Km). Volume and clearance
parameters were allometrically scaled, normalized to a ref-
erence weight of 3.165 kg for NZW rabbits and 2.88 kg for
cynomolgus macaques. The final human structural model
consisted of a two-compartment model parameterized in
terms of CL, Vc, Vp, and Q. The typical estimates for NZW
rabbits, macaques, and humans are presented in Supple-
mentary Table S1.
The final population PK models provided reasonable
descriptions of the obiltoxaximab data. Goodness-of-fit cri-
teria revealed that the final models were consistent with the
observed data and that no systematic bias remained. The
model evaluation results provided evidence that both the
fixed and random effects components of the final models
were reflective of the observed data as well (Supplementary
Figure S1).
Animal survival modeling
The Weibull cure rate model was simultaneously fit to
infected rabbit and macaque data. The survivor function for
this model is given by:
P (T > t) = psurv + (1 − psurv) exp[− (λt)]α
where T is the time to death. The parameter psurv is the prob-
ability that an animal survives to the end of the study (Day
28), and λ is the rate at which animals die. The shape of the
survival curve is determined by parameter α.
The survival model also included an Emax dose–response
and an exponential effect of log10(PTT bacteremia) on
logit(psurv). The parameters psurv and λ were modeled as func-
tions of dose and PTT quantitative bacteremia in the follow-
ing manner:
logit (psurv) = θ0 − (θ1 × log10PTT )θ2 + Emax × dose
ED50 + dose
log (λ) = λ0 + λ1 × log10PTT
where θ0 is the baseline logit for P(cure), Emax is the maxi-
mum effect of obiltoxaximab on psurv on the logit scale, ED50
is the obiltoxaximab dose (mg/kg) that is needed to achieve
half of the maximum effect of drug on psurv, θ1 is the rate
for log10(PTT) on P(cure), θ2 is the exponent for quantitative
bacteremia effect, λ0 is the P(cure) for placebo, and λ1 is the
slope effect of log10(PTT) on λ (Supplementary Table S2).
Obiltoxaximab 8 mg/kg provided �90% of the maximal
possible response; however, the maximum psurv level ranged
from nearly 0 with PTT bacteremia levels above 5 log10
colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to nearly 1.0 with low PTT
bacteremia levels. At lower PTT bacteremia levels (<3 log10
CFU/mL) a 4 mg/kg dose provided near maximum survival. At
higher PTT bacteremia levels (3–4 log10 CFU/mL), an 8 mg/kg
dose provided maximum survival. At a PTT bacteremia level

Figure 1 Obiltoxaximab mean (SD) Cmax (a) and AUC(0-48) (b) as a
function of dose in healthy and infected monkeys. AUC over the
first 48 h (AUC0-48) was chosen so as to effect a meaningful eval-
uation across all of the animal groups (healthy; infected survivors;
infected nonsurvivors). There were too few animals with a valid
estimate of AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf), par-
ticularly in nonsurviving infected animals, to make a useful com-
parison with this parameter.
of �5 log10 CFU/mL, there was almost zero probability of
survival, indicating that animals at this level were beyond a
"point of no return" for survival. The estimated ED50 was 1.64
mg/kg (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.515– 5.22), and ED90
was 14.8 mg/kg (95% CI: 4.6–47.0 mg/kg). Although there is
considerable uncertainty in the 95% CI, the probability that a
dose of 16 mg/kg exceeds the ED90 is greater than 80%. A 16
mg/kg dose was chosen as the efficacious dose for nonclin-
ical species, as it exceeded the ED90 and provided a margin
of assurance that the maximum probability of survival would
be achieved (Supplementary Figure S2).
Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses
Obiltoxaximab 16 mg/kg was administered i.v. to infected
NZW rabbits and infected cynomolgus macaques in three
studies (rabbit Study 2, macaque Studies 4 and 5). In
macaques, mean t1/2 values of 4.1 to 7.4 days were
observed, and mean Vss was 47.7 to 59.0 mL/kg. Mean
CL was 7.8 to 9.0 mL/d/kg. In rabbits, mean t1/2 was
1.0 day, Vss was 36.6 mL/kg, and CL was 17.3 mL/d/kg.
Across all doses in macaque studies, obiltoxaximab Cmax
and AUC0-48hr values increased linearly with dose, and
were not substantively different between healthy animals,
infected animals that died, and infected animals that survived
(Figure 1). Comparable results were observed in infected
and uninfected rabbits. This indicates that the pathological
processes leading to lethality had no impact on obiltoxax-
imab disposition. Detailed animal PK results are included in
Supplementary Table S3.

Cmax (a) and AUC0-inf (b) in infected animals and healthy humans

Human PK data across a 4 to 16 mg/kg dose range from
Studies 2 to 4 are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.
Accounting for body size differences, obiltoxaximab Vss and
CL were similar, while t1/2 was longer (15–23 days), in humans
than in animals.11 Coadministration of 16 mg/kg obiltoxax-
imab i.v. with i.v. or oral ciprofloxacin in human subjects did
not alter the PK of either ciprofloxacin or obiltoxaximab.11
Translation of animal dosing to human dosing
Based on the results of the animal survival analysis and sur-
vival modeling results,15 the dose of 16 mg/kg was chosen as
a therapeutic dose and for testing in clinical trials in healthy
humans. A comparison of obiltoxaximab systemic exposures
(mean and individual Cmax and AUC0-inf values) observed in
healthy adult humans following a single i.v. dose of 16 mg/kg
to those at the efficacious dose of 16 mg/kg i.v. in rabbits and
macaques, is shown in Figure 2.

concentration data are from Studies 3 and 4; human simulations
present the 90% prediction intervals for populations of 500 healthy
and infected humans.
Obiltoxaximab Cmax values in healthy humans were com-
parable to those in infected rabbits and macaques, with
overlapping individual values and SD estimates among
macaques that survived, macaques that died, rabbits that
survived, rabbits that died, and human subjects. AUC0-inf val-
ues were notably greater in healthy humans than in infected
rabbits and macaques; only 2 of 255 individual human
AUC0-inf values fell within the range of individual animal
values (macaques only), and there was no overlap in SD
estimates. Similarly, at 16 mg/kg i.v., maximum obiltoxax-
imab concentrations for simulated populations of healthy
and infected humans were comparable to and overall serum
exposures exceeded those observed in individual infected
macaques following a 16 mg/kg i.v. dose of obiltoxax-
imab, as shown in overlaid concentration vs. time profiles in
Figure 3a,b, respectively. Similar results were observed in
rabbit experiments (Supplementary Figure S3).
These results were supported by a comparison of obil-
toxaximab Cmax and AUC values obtained for the simulated
healthy and infected human populations to those observed

in animals at 16 mg/kg i.v. (Table 2). Cmax in simulated
healthy and infected humans was similar to those in infected
macaques and rabbits (mean Cmax: 363, 357, 408, and 402
μg/mL, respectively). The overall obiltoxaximab systemic
exposures (AUC) for the simulated human populations were
at least twice those in macaques and rabbits (mean AUC0-inf,:
4,980, 4,070, 1,870, and 958μg·day/mL in healthy humans,
infected humans, infected macaques, and infected rabbits,
respectively), which is consistent with the longer terminal
half-life in humans. From Table 2 it can be ascertained that
human AUC0-inf is 18% lower when the effects of TMDD are
included in the simulation. The considerable difference in
predicted human exposures is the reason that the effects
of TMDD were considered when comparing human expo-
sures to preclinical species. However, we believe that TMDD
effects on efficacy will be minimal, since the majority of
TMDD effects are observed at low obiltoxaximab concentra-
tions occurring long after the dose administration.
Justification of the recommended human dose
Maximum obiltoxaximab serum concentrations in simulated
populations of healthy and infected humans after a 16 mg/kg
i.v. dose were 1 and 2 orders of magnitude greater than the
levels required for 99.9% (48 μg/mL) and 99% (4.8 μg/mL)
PA neutralization, respectively (Figure 4). Moreover, the time
at which the lower end of the 90% prediction interval for
obiltoxaximab concentration declines to the 99.9% PA bind-
ing concentration is approximately Day 20 and Day 16 for
healthy and infected humans, respectively. This time frame
would allow for the development of endogenous adaptive
immunity in humans; anti-PA IgG was detected in 16 of 17
patients with confirmed or suspected bioterrorism-related
clinical anthrax within 11 days after the onset of symptoms
(15 days after likely exposure),25 and within 5 to 7 days after
onset of symptoms in a patient with naturally acquired inhala-
tional anthrax.26
Observed obiltoxaximab mean Cmax in humans (�390 μg
/mL or 2,600 nM; see Figure 2a) was an order of magnitude
greater than the maximum individual PTT PA concentration
observed across all infected animals in the treatment studies
(9.67 μg/mL or 153 nM).15 Additionally, obiltoxaximab con-
centrations persisted above these levels for more than 3
weeks (Supplementary Figure S4).

lated human populations are 1 and 2 orders of magnitude greater
than the levels required for 99.9% (48 μg/mL) and 99% (4.8 μg/mL)
PA neutralization, respectively. Obiltoxaximab concentrations are
maintained above these neutralization levels in serum for 2 to 3
weeks. The lower end of the 90% prediction interval declines to
the 99.9% PA binding concentration at approximately Day 20 and
Day 16 for healthy and infected subjects, respectively.
DISCUSSION
In accordance with the FDA’
s Animal Rule regulations (21
CFR 601.90), obiltoxaximab demonstrated efficacy in well-
controlled animal studies,15 and has been shown to be
safe, with well-described pharmacokinetics in humans.11 In
the absence of robust PK/PD models, a human dose that
achieves obiltoxaximab exposures that are comparable to
or exceed those in animals was selected. The data support
that, relative to animals, a superior human AUC and non-
inferior human Cmax should be sufficient to maximize sur-
vival with obiltoxaximab and show that the human experi-
mental dose of 16 mg/kg i.v. meets the tenets of the Animal
Rule Guidance.9,10 The effect of body weight on obiltoxax-
imab disposition was evaluated in the population PK analy-
sis across a range of 50–125 kg. This analysis demonstrated
that a body weight adjusted dose yields obiltoxaximab expo-
sures that are more consistent across the weight range when
compared with a flat obiltoxaximab dose.
Using the modeling results from the infected animal
studies that demonstrated that 16 mg/kg was maximally
efficacious, we constructed a time-to-event model describ-
ing observed survival across doses and disease severity.
This model included nonlinear effects of dose and PTT bac-
teremia on survival and the effect of bacteremia on the rate
of death. Qualitatively, the model implied that higher PTT
bacteremia levels were associated with lower survival rates
and faster rates of death, while higher doses and low PTT
bacteremia levels were associated with higher survival rates.
The obiltoxaximab ED90 was 14.8 mg/kg, and a 16-mg/kg
dose exceeded the ED90 with a probability of 80%. Modeling
projections are based on the results of monotherapy efficacy
studies where animals received a targeted spore dose of 200
LD50. However, obiltoxaximab is indicated for the treatment
of inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate
antibacterial drugs. Thus, our modeling projections repre-
sent a conservative approach for estimating the probability
of survival. For a 16 mg/kg dose, in the absence of PTT
bacteremia, the model predicted a 0.98 probability of cure.
At PTT bacteremia of 3.5 log10 CFU/mL, the baseline survival
probability (no treatment) was 0.06 and obiltoxaximab 16
mg/kg increased the survival probability to 0.73; however,
doses >16 mg/kg yielded little increased survival benefit.
Our findings of an inverse relationship between disease
severity and monotherapy efficacy were reproduced in two
animal models and at different dose levels.15
Human obiltoxaximab Cmax values after a 16-mg/kg i.v.
infusion of obiltoxaximab were comparable to those in both
rabbits and macaques, while AUC0-inf values in humans were
at least twice those in infected animals, and obiltoxaximab
serum concentrations were sustained at higher levels over a
longer period of time in humans than in animals, consistent
with the longer half-life in humans.
Population simulations evaluating the effect of potential
covariates on obiltoxaximab PK demonstrated that, com-
pared with simulations of the primary population, age (up to
75 years), gender, body weight (50–125 kg), and non-white
race were projected to have minimal (<25%) effect on Cmax,
and that AUC0-inf values might decrease by up to 18%, but
exposure margins relative to animals at the efficacious dose
would still be substantial (�1.8x). These findings confirmed
that dose adjustment based on gender, age, race, or body
size is not required. In addition, concomitant antibacterials
and diphenhydramine pretreatment had no effect on obiltox-
aximab PK.
PA concentrations rise rapidly in animal models of
anthrax infection, generally within 1 to 3 days after spore
challenge.12,20,21,24 The mechanism of obiltoxaximab phar-
macological activity is through its binding to PA and
subsequent inhibition of PA binding to its membrane
receptors.8,16,17 Animal treatment studies showed that obil-
toxaximab rapidly reduced concentrations of circulating
PA.15 A 16 mg/kg human dose is projected to achieve more
than sufficient initial obiltoxaximab concentrations to effect
the same degree of PA neutralization. Additionally, persis-
tence of the high molar excess of obiltoxaximab during
the first 2 to 3 weeks of infection would ensure that all
newly secreted PA would be continuously neutralized until
bacteremia was resolved. This time frame exceeds the 10-
day postchallenge period in animal studies within which
all animals that succumbed to infection ultimately died.1
Moreover, anti-PA IgG was detected in rabbits within 10 to
14 days postchallenge.8 This same time frame would allow
for the development of endogenous adaptive immunity in
humans.

Together, these data and analyses, including modeling and
simulations, provide sound justification of a high probability
for a 16 mg/kg i.v. obiltoxaximab dose to produce clinical
benefit for the treatment of humans with inhalational anthrax.
