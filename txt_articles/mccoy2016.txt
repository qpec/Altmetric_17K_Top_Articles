IMPORTANCE Suicide represents the 10th leading cause of death across age groups in the
United States (12.6 cases per 100 000) and remains challenging to predict. While many
individuals who die by suicide are seen by physicians before their attempt, they may not seek
psychiatric care.
OBJECTIVE To determine the extent to which incorporating natural language processing of
narrative discharge notes improves stratification of risk for death by suicide after medical or
surgical hospital discharge.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective health care use study, clinical data
were analyzed from individuals with discharges from 2 large academic medical centers
between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was suicide as a reported cause of
death based on Massachusetts Department of Public Health records. Regression models for
prediction of death by suicide or accidental death were compared relying solely on coded
clinical data and those using natural language processing of hospital discharge notes.
RESULTS There were 845 417 hospital discharges represented in the cohort, including
458 053 unique individuals. Overall, all-cause mortality was 18% during 9 years, and the
median follow-up was 5.2 years. The cohort included 235 (0.1%) who died by suicide during
2.4 million patient-years of follow-up. Positive valence reflected in narrative notes was
associated with a 30% reduction in risk for suicide in models adjusted for coded
sociodemographic and clinical features (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85; P < .001) and
improved model fit (χ2
2 = 14.843, P < .001 by log-likelihood test). The C statistic was 0.741
(95% CI, 0.738-0.744) for models of suicide with or without inclusion of accidental death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Multiple clinical features available at hospital discharge
identified a cohort of individuals at substantially increased risk for suicide. Greater positive
valence expressed in narrative discharge summaries was associated with substantially
diminished risk. Automated tools to aid clinicians in evaluating these risks may assist in
identifying high-risk individuals.

S
uicide represents one of the most dreaded outcomes of
psychiatric illness. With 41 149 completed suicides re-
portedbytheUSCentersforDiseaseControlandPreven-
tion in 2013, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the
United States (12.6 cases per 100 000) and the second leading
cause among individuals aged 15 to 24 years (10.9 cases per
100000).1,2Whileepidemiologicalinvestigationsprovidesome
guidance regarding demographic features, symptoms, or diag-
noses associated with greatest risk, such studies tend to focus
onsuicideattemptsamongepidemiologicalcohortsassessedby
diagnosticinterviews.3-5Conversely,small-scalestudies6,7have
evaluated biomarkers or psychosocial features associated with
suicide attempt among high-risk individuals. What is to our
knowledge the sole larger study8 to examine death by suicide
assessed a cohort of US soldiers after psychiatric hospital dis-
charge, reporting on 68 deaths.
The challenge for any of these risk models is automation,
namely,efficientlyintegratingdatatofacilitateidentificationof
high-risk individuals. While potential interventions exist,9-12 it
maynotbefeasibletoofferinterventionstoeveryone.Tofacili-
tate such efforts, we sought to examine a large, generalizable
groupofindividualshospitalizedover9yearsat1of2academic
medicalcentersbycouplingelectronichealthrecords(EHRs)with
long-term death certificate data. Because the period after hos-
pitaldischargecarrieselevatedriskforsuicide,hospitaldischarge

alsoallowsinvestigationofmorerepresentativepatientcohorts

ieswhileinvestigatingpredictorsmorereadilytranslatablethan
biomarker or military cohort studies. In particular, focusing on
general hospital cohorts allows characterization of individuals
typically neglected in the psychiatric literature, namely, those
who may not seek psychiatric treatment but who are nonethe-
less at elevated risk for suicide. If one goal of risk stratification
isultimatelytranslationtodevelopinterventionsforpreventing
suicide, understanding this population may be critical. Almost

Methods
Cohort and Outcome Derivation
The study cohort was defined as all hospital discharges be-
tween January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013, at Massachu-
settsGeneralHospitalandBrighamandWomen’
sHospital,Bos-
ton. We extracted sociodemographic data, billing codes, and
narrative hospital discharge notes for all patients from the hos-
pitals’EHRs. Data were managed using server software (i2b2,
version 1.6; Informatics for Integrating Biology and the
Bedside).17-19
The EHRs include patients’vital status based on the US So-
cial Security Death Index (updated monthly) but not cause or
circumstances of death. The specific features examined in re-
gression models were standard sociodemographic and clinical
cohortdescriptorsselectedbyourgroupapriori,aswellasthose
shown in prior work to be associated with readmission.15,20
ThestudyprotocolwasreviewedandapprovedbythePart-
ners Human Research Committee at Massachusetts General
Hospital. As a retrospective health care use study, the require-
ment for informed consent of participants was waived.
Outcome
For all deceased individuals, we queried Massachusetts De-
partmentofPublicHealthrecordsforallindividualsintheEHR-
defined cohort to determine cause of death. Suicide or acci-
dental death was determined based on reported (coded) cause
of death. The primary outcome of interest was suicide as a re-
ported cause of death. However, recognizing that some sui-
cide may be misclassified as accidental death (eg, when cir-
cumstances of death cannot be confirmed), we also examined
death by either suicide or accidental death as a secondary com-
posite outcome. The analyses of the composite outcome are
presented along with the primary results (ie, strictly defined
suicide as cause of death) and are noted in the text when they
differ substantially from the narrower suicide phenotype.
Development and Application of Natural Language
Processing Tools
Our group has previously described the application of a tool
for characterizing positive and negative valence expressed in
narrativenotes.15Inbrief,weusedacuratedlistofalmost3000
subjectively valence-conveying terms to score each narrative
note using an open-source opinion mining tool (Pattern, ver-
sion 2.6; Python).21,22 For example, terms with positive va-
lence include glad, pleasant, and lovely. Those with negative
valence include gloomy, unfortunate, and sad. The full list is
publicly available in the Pattern library. The lexicon has pre-
viously been validated as a manually annotated corpus.23,24
Each word includes a polarity score (negativity to positivity,
Key Points
Question To what extent does incorporating natural language
processing of narrative discharge notes improve stratification of
risk for death by suicide after medical or surgical hospital
discharge?
Findings In this health care use study, positive valence reflected
in narrative notes was associated with a 30% reduction in risk for
suicide in adjusted models and improved model fit.
Meaning Automated tools to aid clinicians in evaluating these
risks may assist them in identifying high-risk individuals.

scored as −1 to 1), as well as subjectivity (not subjective to sub-
jective, scored as 0 to 1). This open-source implementation al-
lows direct inspection of the method and ready replication. As
inourpriorwork,wescoredeachdocumentbasedonthemean
value for all recognized words after accounting for preceding
negation (eg, to distinguish happy from not happy) and mul-
tiplying by the intensity modifier for relevant adjectives. For
illustrative purposes, the eTable in the Supplement lists terms
associated with positive valence appearing in at least 10% of
a random sample of 5000 notes.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis used survival methods, with the
results censored at the end of follow-up or at death. After
confirming that proportional hazards assumptions were met
for the primary model, Cox regression was used to examine
risk associated with predictors individually and in aggregate.
In light of the scale of data, we randomly selected a single
hospitalization from individuals with multiple hospitaliza-
tions to maximize computability, while minimizing bias.
Sensitivity analysis using 2 alternate approaches incorpo-
rated all clustered observations: Cox proportional hazards
regression and mixed-effects survival with per-individual
intercept.25,26
For the primary outcome and the secondary composite
outcome, 2 regression models were fit to explain the clinical
outcomes. The first model used only coded clinical data,
including age, sex, self-reported race, recent health care use
(including outpatient psychiatric visits, overall outpatient
visits, and emergency department visits), and overall medical
morbidity as estimated by the Charlson Comorbidity
Index.27,28 Given the pronounced skew in continuous mea-
sures (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4), models used logarithmic (vari-
able plus 1) transformation.
The second model included all features from the first
model and then added aggregate measures of positive and
negative valence. These measures are considered separately
rather than as a continuum because previous analyses indi-
cated that they are not inherently opposing (ie, some notes
include terms reflecting both positive and negative valence).
As a sensitivity analysis to examine the potential effect of
hypothetical missing data due to documentation delay, the 5
suicides occurring within 1 week of discharge were censored
and the analysis rerun, with essentially identical results.
Models were characterized in terms of standard mea-
sures of discrimination, including the C statistic, as well as
calibration. The C statistic was calculated with 10-fold cross-
validation to minimize optimism. Continuous net reclassifi-
cation improvement was calculated as a complementary
measure of improvement in model fit.29 To aid in under-
standing the potential application of risk models, we also
applied decision curve analysis (http://decisioncurveanalysis

Results
There were 845 417 hospital discharges represented in the
cohort, including 458 053 unique individuals. Overall, all-
cause mortality was 18% for 9 years, and the median
follow-up was 5.2 years. For the cohort as a whole, 235 (0.1%)
died by suicide during follow-up (Figure 1). These deaths
included 77 in the first year of follow-up (11 who died within
30 days and 50 who died within 180 days), 46 in the second
year of follow-up, and 192 within the first 5 years. The fea-
tures of the cohort, contrasting individuals who did vs did
not die by suicide, are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. A total
of 2026 individuals (0.4%) died by either suicide or acciden-
tal death during follow-up (Figure 2), including 712 in the
first year of follow-up, of which 178 occurred within the first
30 days after discharge. The features of the cohort, con-
trasted by the composite outcome, are summarized in

associated with greater suicide risk included white race,
male sex, and more emergency department visits and psy-
chiatric outpatient visits in the 12 months before admission.
Alternative models that included frailty-clustered Cox pro-
portional hazards regression and mixed-effects regression
with per-individual intercepts yielded similar results. Over-
all, the C statistic for the model using the coded data only
was 0.737 (95% CI, 0.734-0.741). The results from the suicide
and accidental death composite outcome are summarized in
Table 6 as model 1. The C statistic was 0.728 (95% CI, 0.727-
0.728). In general, coefficients are similar across the 2 out-
come definitions, with the exception of age and Charlson
Comorbidity Index, which may reflect truly accidental death
disproportionately affecting older and sicker patients rather
than misclassified suicide.
Inasecondmodel(model2)createdbyaddingpositiveand
negativevalenceextractedfromdischargesummariesbynatu-
ral language processing to model 1, positive valence was also
associated with the primary suicide risk outcome (hazard ra-
tio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85) (Table 5). In other words, a 1-SD
increase was associated with a 30% reduction in risk for sui-
cide. Adding this feature to the coded data model improved
model fit (χ2
2 = 14.843, P < .001 by log-likelihood test), and the
resulting C statistic was 0.741 (95% CI, 0.738-0.744). Continu-
ous net reclassification improvement was 0.10. From the low-
est-risk quartile to the highest-risk quartile (Figure 1), the total
numbers of suicides observed were 17 (7.2%), 25 (10.6%), 52
(22.1%), and 141 (60%), respectively (ie, the top 50% of risk
identified 82.1% of suicides). To facilitate qualitative compari-
son, eFigure 1 in the Supplement shows model 1 adjacent to
model 2.
Likewise, addition of the valence feature to the model of
the composite outcome (suicide or accidental death) im-
proved model fit (χ2
2 = 45.269, P < .001 by log-likelihood test),
with continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.02. A
1-SD increase in positive valence was associated with approxi-
matelya20%reductioninrisk(hazardratio,0.80;95%CI,0.75-
0.85) (model 2 in Table 6 and Figure 2). For this model, the C
statistic was 0.732 (95% CI, 0.731-0.732). From the lowest-
risk quartile to the highest-risk quartile, the total numbers of
events were 107 (5.3%), 339 (16.7%), 534 (26.4%), and 1046
(51.6%), respectively (ie, an intervention targeting the top 50%
of risk could prevent at most 78% of suicides or accidental
deaths, while one targeting the highest-risk quartile could pre-
vent at most 52%). As with the suicide-only models, eFigure
2 in the Supplement shows model 1 adjacent to model 2. De-
cision curve analysis (eFigure 3 in the Supplement) suggests
that the greatest benefit (vs intervening in all individuals or
not at all) is observed with interventions in individuals with
predictedprobabilityofaneventbetweenapproximately0.25%
and 1%.
Discussion
In this cohort, which spans approximately 2.4 million patient-
years, we developed a model based on coded clinical data that
predicts suicide and accidental death among patients dis-
charged from academic medical centers at a rate substan-
tially exceeding chance, with an area under the curve of ap-
proximately 0.73. To our knowledge, postdischarge risk for

suicide death in large nonpsychiatric cohorts has not previ-
ously been modeled. We further found that addition of un-
coded clinical data reflecting positive and negative valence
available in general hospital discharge notes modestly im-
proved prediction of these outcomes, suggesting more gen-
erally the potential usefulness of augmenting models using
coded data only with concepts extracted from narrative clini-
cal notes.
Among the coded data, we confirmed multiple clinical fea-
tures previously associated with risk, such as male sex and
white race, illustrating assay sensitivity and consistency with
prior epidemiological investigations of suicide.3,10 Likewise,
as anticipated, any psychiatric visit and prior psychiatric treat-
ment were individually associated with substantial increase
in risk. Because we sought to predict suicide death (and not
unsuccessful attempt, as in most past efforts), our results are
difficulttocomparedirectlywithpriorstudies.4,5Inonestudy8
examining suicide death among a cohort of active-duty sol-
diers discharged after psychiatric hospitalization, there were
68 deaths within 12 months. Machine learning models incor-
porating administrative and clinical details were effective in
identifying high-risk hospitalizations. A systematic literature
reviewdidnotidentifyanysimilareffortsamongpatientswith-
out psychiatric hospitalization.8
Notably, 115 of 235 (48.9%) suicide deaths in the present
study occurred among individuals with no coded data reflect-
ing psychiatric International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision diagnostic codes in this health system. This finding
is consistent with prior reports that, while individuals who die
by suicide often have contact with a health professional, the
clinician is likely to not be a psychiatrist or therapist,14 which
underscorestheimportanceofpsychiatricexpertiseinthegen-
eral hospital setting. We cannot exclude the possibility that
some of these individuals had sought treatment in the com-
munity(eg,inaprivatepracticeoranotherhealthsystem).Even
if so, this treatment was not documented in hospital records
and so presumably was not known by hospital staff. These
omissions may reflect failure to inquire about psychiatric his-
tory, a potential target for intervention meriting further study.
In examining the hypothesis that narrative notes could im-
prove prediction, we find that incorporating a simple natural
language processing strategy improved the ability to esti-
mate risk for suicide and accidental death. The particular strat-
egy used herein identifies valence reflected in narrative notes.
Such words may reflect individual symptoms, as well as cli-
nician perception not reflected elsewhere.15 The modest im-
provement in discrimination (eg, continuous net reclassifica-
tion improvement of 0.10 and 0.02) afforded by the natural
language processing suggests that, while statistically signifi-
cant, these additional features may not yet be clinically sig-
nificant. As the eTable in the Supplement summarizes, there
is likely substantial opportunity to better capture words re-
flecting emotion using more curated data sets and thereby im-
prove discrimination further.32 It is also possible that some
proxiesamongcodeddatacouldbeidentified.Wedescribethis
concept as “valence” for consistency with long-standing psy-
chological literature,16 in the sense of words conveying posi-
tive or negative emotion rather than in reference to the di-
mensional feature of psychopathology described in the
National Institute of Mental Health’
s Research Domain Crite-
ria. Still, despite the granularity of the method we applied, we
capture a set of patient-level features not otherwise reflected
in coded data and associated with a 30% change in hazard. We
present a generalizable approach spanning approximately 2.4
millionpatient-yearsandmultiplehospitalsinanticipationthat
others will apply and advance such methods. Our results sug-
gest that moving beyond coded data to capture details of clini-
cal presentation may be valuable in efforts to develop more
stratified or patient-specific interventions. This value may be
in extracting codifiable facts from free text that were merely
not coded at the time of the encounter27 or in extracting met-
rics from notes that were never candidates for coding.33 In
either case, developing methods that do not rely on addi-
tional data gathering and entry by treatment teams but rather
do more with the results of routine care should lower the bar-
riers to translation of risk stratification models into clinical
practice.
Developing a risk stratification model represents only part
of a continuum from defining a clinical problem to validation
and model presentation.34,35 For example, a previous effort7
to predict suicide among high-risk psychiatric patients based
on a constellation of manually scored psychosocial features
subsequently did not replicate,36 illustrating the challenges in
disseminating such models. In the absence of prior risk pre-
diction models among medically hospitalized patients, our
modelusingcodeddataonlymaybeconsideredastartingpoint
with which efforts at improvement may be compared. Assess-
ing the clinical usefulness of such models requires additional
considerations that take into account the risks and benefits of
the specific intervention contemplated in the high-risk groups,
which may be presented using decision curves.30 The rarity
of suicide and accidental death precludes reliable estimates of
risk without multiple, larger data sets. We anticipate that these
results will encourage other investigators to apply these meth-
ods to their own cohorts. Still, it is promising that a strategy
targeting the highest-risk quartile identifies more than 50% of
individuals with suicide or accidental death, while targeting
the top 2 quartiles identifies approximately 80% of subse-
quent deaths.
Several limitations in the present data must be consid-
ered. First, cause of death was not available for all individu-
als, so some degree of misclassification must be assumed. In
general, this limitation should bias the results toward failing
to detect effects, particularly if those at greatest risk are also
those most likely to be missed (eg, because they moved out
of state or disappeared as a result of psychosis, mania, or sub-
stance abuse). To directly examine misclassification, we con-
sideredabroaderoutcomethatincludedaccidentaldeath.Sec-
ond, we were unable to examine the specific features of
psychopathology (eg, as represented in the National Institute
of Mental Health’
s Research Domain Criteria) systematically
because of the absence of structured research assessments or
experimental testing paradigms. On the other hand, these re-

not directly examine clinician-level features in these notes,
which are the product of multiple admitting and discharging
resident physicians. Fourth, while the results span a large co-
hort observed for up to a decade, they still reflect the popu-
lation of 2 academic medical centers in a single region, albeit
a large one. As a result, further investigation to understand the
extent to which these results generalize to other populations
will be required.
Notwithstanding these important limitations, our results
suggest the outlines of an approach to characterizing risk fea-
sibly and cost-effectively. While discharge summaries are not
necessarily available at discharge, with modern EHRs they are
typically available between 1 day and 1 week after discharge.
Alternatively, it may be possible to find proxies for these fea-
tures among coded data, although such data may also be un-
available at discharge. As such, under a population manage-
ment strategy, scores might be generated for each individual,
with those individuals in the highest-risk quartile (or some
other threshold determined based on the intensity of the in-
tervention and available resources) targeted for a follow-up
telephone call, letter to the primary care practice, or office visit
to assess risk and assist with psychiatric referral if needed. The
intensity of the intervention might further be tailored to the
risk quartile (eg, providing a more intensive intervention to the
top quartile and a less intensive one to the next quartile).
Conclusions
In aggregate, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of
characterizing suicide risk based on data available as part of
routineclinicalcareasapossiblesteptowardclinicalriskstrati-
fication. Even limited to coded data, our prediction substan-
tially improves on chance or on the current standard of no sys-
tematic assessment. Furthermore, it illustrates the application
of simple machine learning techniques to extract additional
data from clinician notes as a means of capturing more detail
than is available in coded data sets and crucially shows that
even a coarse measure may substantially improve risk strati-
fication. While the value of large data sets in health care has
undoubtedly been the subject of substantial hyperbole, our re-
sults add to a growing body of work indicating the feasibility
of leveraging such data sets with standard computational tools
to make predictions that may be applied to stratify risk.
