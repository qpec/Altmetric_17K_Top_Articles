3α-5α-Tetrahydroprogesterone, a progesterone metabolite also known as allopregnanolone, and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol, a
testosterone metabolite also known as 3α-androstanediol, are neuroactive steroids and positive GABAA receptor allosteric modulators.
Both anorexia nervosa (AN) and obesity are complicated by affective comorbidities and hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal dysregulation.
However, it is not known whether neuroactive steroid levels are abnormal at the extremes of the weight spectrum. We hypothesized that
serum allopregnanolone and 3α-androstanediol levels would be decreased in AN compared with healthy controls (HC) and negatively
associated with affective symptoms throughout the weight spectrum, independent of body mass index (BMI). Thirty-six women were 1 : 1
age-matched across three groups: AN, HC, and overweight/obese (OW/OB). AN were amenorrheic; HC and OW/OB were studied in
the follicular phase. Fasting serum neuroactive steroids were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mean Hamilton
depression and anxiety scores were highest in AN (po0.0001). Mean serum allopregnanolone was lower in AN and OW/OB than HC
(AN 95.3 ± 56.4 vs OW/OB 73.8 ± 31.3 vs HC 199.5 ± 167.8 pg/ml, p = 0.01), despite comparable mean serum progesterone.
Allopregnanolone levels, but not progesterone levels, were negatively associated with depression and anxiety symptom severity,
independent of BMI. Serum 3α-androstanediol levels did not differ among groups and were not associated with depression or anxiety
scores, despite a significant negative association between free testosterone levels and both anxiety and depression severity. In conclusion,
women at both extremes of the weight spectrum have low mean serum allopregnanolone, which is associated with increased depression
and anxiety severity, independent of BMI. Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone may be potential therapeutic targets for
depression and anxiety in traditionally treatment-resistant groups, including AN.

INTRODUCTION
Peripherally derived sex steroids, including progesterone and
testosterone, can be converted by biosynthetic enzymes into
neuroactive steroids that reach and act in the brain, where
they
may
regulate
affective
symptoms
by
modulating
neurotransmitter systems. The enzymes 5α-reductase and
3α-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase
(3α-HSD)
metabolize
progesterone to 3α-5α-tetrahydroprogesterone (also known
as allopregnanolone) and testosterone to 5α-androstane-
3α,17β-diol (also known as 3α-androstanediol) in a parallel
manner (Figure 1) (King, 2013; Reddy, 2010). Allopregnanolone
is a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA action at
GABAA receptors increasing GABA activity with 10 times
the potency of benzodiazepines (King, 2013; Majewska et al,
1986; Morrow et al, 1987). Although less potent than
allopregnanolone,
3α-androstanediol
is
also
a
positive
modulator
of
GABAA
receptor
action
(Reddy,
2004).
Increases in GABAA receptor activity dampen neuronal
excitation and result in anxiolytic, antidepressant, and
sedative effects in humans (Eser et al, 2006a; Eser et al,
2006b; Rasmusson et al, 2006; Rupprecht and Holsboer,
1999a,b,; Sigel and Steinmann, 2012). However, little is
known about whether such GABAergic neuroactive steroids
contribute to the etiopathology of affective disorders in
women at the extremes of the weight spectrum, which are
enriched for both depression and anxiety symptoms.
Small studies have suggested that both cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) and serum allopregnanolone levels may be low in
patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as compared with healthy

 controls (Rasmusson et al, 2006; Romeo et al, 1998; Strohle
et al, 1999; Uzunova et al, 1998). Girdler et al (2012)
additionally noted decreased conversion of progesterone to
allopregnanolone in women with a history of depression.
Moreover, results from three small studies suggest that
pharmacological antidepressant therapy with selective ser-
otonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase allopregna-
nolone levels in CSF, serum, and postmortem brain,
implying a possible mechanistic role in depression etiology
and recovery (Agis-Balboa et al, 2014; Romeo et al, 1998;
Strohle et al, 1999; Uzunova et al, 1998). One such study
showed that SSRI treatment in depressed subjects led to an
increase in CSF allopregnanolone levels and that these levels
positively correlated with improvement in depressive symp-
toms in the absence of changes in the levels of precursors,
such as progesterone (Uzunova et al, 1998). In another study,
drug-naive outpatients with MDD demonstrated significant
increases
in
serum
allopregnanolone
levels
with
SSRI
treatment (Romeo et al, 1998). In a third study, serum
allopregnanolone levels increased with ‘clinically effective’
antidepressant administration (Strohle et al, 1999). Studies
have shown that the administration of 3α-androstanediol
reduces depressive behaviors in male and female mice (Frye
and Walf, 2009). However, there are no data in humans on
the testosterone metabolite 3α-androstanediol in relation to
mood disorders.
Anorexia nervosa (AN) and overweight/obesity (OW/OB)
are both complicated by high rates of comorbid depression
and anxiety. AN in women is complicated by depression
and/or anxiety in 450% of cases. Seven percent of obese
adults have depression; 43% of adults with depression are
obese (Bredella et al, 2014; Herzog et al, 1996). In women,
increasing BMI has been associated with MDD and suicidal
ideation, and the diagnosis of obesity has been shown to
confer a 37% increased risk of an MDD diagnosis in women
according to US National Survey data (Carpenter et al, 2000).
Given the deficiency of gonadal hormonal substrates in
women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, one might expect
lower levels of neuroactive steroids in patients with AN. In
contrast to this hypothesis, a few small studies have
demonstrated higher allopregnanolone levels in women with
AN vs healthy controls (Galderisi et al, 2003; Monteleone
et al, 2001). Studies of neuroactive steroids in obesity are
limited; two studies, one in women alone and one in both
sexes combined, reported higher levels of allopregnanolone
in obese than normal-weight individuals without considera-
tion of comorbid psychiatric symptomatology (Menozzi
et al, 2002; Monteleone et al, 2003). However, all these
studies were limited by the use of immunoassays to measure
allopregnanolone levels, which are particularly vulnerable to
cross-reactivity with similarly structured steroid hormone
metabolites (Cheney et al, 1995a; Siekmann, 1979). Addi-
tionally, while some studies exclude women on oral contra-
ceptives (Monteleone et al, 2001; Monteleone et al, 2003) and
control for the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle
(Menozzi et al, 2002; Monteleone et al, 2001; Monteleone
et al, 2003), others (Galderisi et al, 2003) do not specify these
conditions, which are critical in the assessment of neuroac-
tive steroids.
Given the sex steroid deficiency in AN, as well as the high
rates of AN-associated MDD, we hypothesized that allo-
pregnanolone and 3α-androstanediol levels would be lower
in women with AN than age-matched lean and overweight/
obese women; we also hypothesized that levels of allopreg-
nanolone and 3α-androstanediol would be inversely asso-
ciated with severity of depression and anxiety across the
three groups, independent of weight. We therefore measured
serum levels of the neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone
and 3α-androstanediol using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) performed after separation of the
steroids of interest by high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC)
in
women
across
the
weight
spectrum
and
investigated the relationship between these neuroactive
steroids and affective symptom severity.

 of the following BMI categories: (1) AN with BMI of
o18.5 kg/m2, (2) healthy control (HC) with BMI 19–24 kg/
m2, and (3) OW/OB with BMI ⩾ 25 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria
for HC and OW/OB subjects included patient-reported
history of a depression diagnosis and/or antidepressant use.
Additionally, none of the AN subjects were receiving
antidepressant medications. The mean age among all groups
was 26 ± 6 years. Formal evaluation for DSM-IV (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000) disorders was performed after
consent. In all cases, individuals meeting DSM-IV depression
or anxiety disorders also met DSM-V criteria (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Participants with anorexia
nervosa were all amenorrheic. HC and OW/OB women were
all eumenorrheic and were studied in the follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle. All subjects underwent a comprehensive
medical history and physical exam as part of this protocol.
Clinical characteristics of subsets of these subjects, but not
this specific 1:1 age-matched group, have been reported as
part of larger groups in parent studies, the following of which
have reported HAM-D, HAM-A, or free testosterone levels
(Bachmann et al, 2016; Brick et al, 2010; Eddy et al, 2015;
Lawson et al, 2009a; Lawson et al, 2012; Lawson et al, 2010;
Lawson et al, 2009b; Miller et al, 2007a; Miller et al, 2011;
Miller et al, 2007b; Schorr et al, 2016). Neuroactive steroid
levels have not been previously published in any parent study
or subset analysis.
Assessment of Mood Symptoms
Hamilton Depression (HDRS; Hamilton, 1960) and Anxiety
(HAM-A; Hamilton, 1959) Rating Scales were administered
on the same day as the blood draw to measure symptom
severity of depression and anxiety, respectively. Higher
scores indicate greater severity of depression and anxiety
symptoms. Clinically significant depression and anxiety in
this study are defined as HDRS 412 and HAM-A414,
respectively.
Hormone Analysis
Samples were stored at − 80 °C and run in one batch. Serum
allopregnanolone, progesterone, and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-
diol (the 5α epimer of 3α-androstenediol) were measured by
GC-MS after HPLC separation of the steroids of interest in
the laboratory of investigator Graziano Pinna. The detection
limit for allopregnanolone and the other neurosteroids
determined with this method was approximately 5 fmol/ml.
The serum samples were extracted in ethylacetate and
lyophilized; the neurosteroids of interest then were purified
and separated with HPLC. Tritiated neurosteroids (Amer-
ican Radiolabeled Chemicals, St Louis, MO) were added to
monitor retention time through the HPLC (Cheney et al,
1995b), while deuterated internal standards (CDN Isotopes,
Pointe-Claire, QC; and Steraloids, Newport, RI) were added
to allow quantification of the compound of interest. Because
deuterated 3α-androstanediol is not available, deuterated 3β-
androstanediol was used as the internal standard for 3α-
androstanediol. Each steroid of interest was then derivatized
for GC-MS (Pibiri et al, 2008; Pinna et al, 2000). Mass
spectrometric analysis was conducted in the standard
electron impact mode for all neuroactive steroid measure-
ments. To calculate the quantity of the neurosteroid of
interest in each fraction, the area under the peak of the
neurosteroid in the sample was divided by the area under the
peak of the deuterated internal standard.
Testosterone levels were measured at Esoterix Endocrinol-
ogy (Calabasas Hills, CA) as follows: percentage of free
testosterone was determined by equilibrium dialysis, with a
minimum reportable free fraction of 0.1% and an intra-assay
coefficient of variation of 8.8–9.4%, and was multiplied by
total testosterone levels as determined by tandem mass
spectroscopy with a sensitivity of 3 ng/dl and intra-assay
coefficient of variation of 0.72–17.3%. The normal range for
free
testosterone
levels
in
premenopausal
women
per
Esoterix Endocrinology was 1.1–6.3 pg/ml.
Statistical Analysis
JMP Pro Statistical Database Software (version 11.0.0; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) was used for statistical analyses. Outliers
[n = 4 for 3α-androstanediol (2 AN, 1 HC and 1 OW/OB)
and n = 1 for progesterone (1 OW/OB, a different subject
than the 3α-androstanediol OW/OB outlier)] were excluded
using JMP quantile analysis (below the first quartile minus
1.5 times the interquartile range or above the upper third
quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range). Results are

were log-transformed. Means were compared across groups
and were controlled for multiple comparisons with Fisher’s
least significance testing (Meier, 2006). Univariate regression
analyses were performed with Pearson correlation coeffi-

standard least squares or stepwise regression models.
RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
There was no difference in mean age between the three
groups.
BMI

groups

(AN
17.4 ± 0.9, HC 22.2 ± 1.2, and OW/OB 32.9 ± 6.7 kg/m2,
p = 0.0001) (Table 1, Figure 2a). Smoking and alcohol use
were known for 35/36 subjects. There was only one current
smoker in the AN group and none in the HC and OW/OB
groups. There were 19 subjects who used alcohol, including 5
of the AN group, 8 of the HC, and 6 of the OW/OB subjects,
with a mean of 3.5 drinks per week in the subjects who did
drink alcohol. The mean number of drinks per week did not
differ between groups.
Affective Symptomatology
Mean HDRS scores were highest in women with AN,
intermediate in OW/OB, and lowest in HC (AN 11.9 ± 5.4 vs
OW/OB 5.0 ± 4.4 vs HC 1.3 ± 1.6, all pairwise po0.05;
Table 1, Figure 2b). Mean HAM-A scores were highest in
women with AN and did not differ between women in the
OW/OB and HC groups (AN 9.9 ± 4.3 vs OW/OB 3.1 ± 3.1 vs
HC 1.6 ± 2.2, overall ANOVA po0.0001; Table 1, Figure 2c).
Overall, 36% of women with AN, no HCs, and 8% of the
OW/OB
women
had
clinically
significant
depression
(HDRS412), while 25% of women with AN and no HCs
or OW/OB women had clinically significant anxiety (HAM-
A414).
Allopregnanolone and Parent-Compound Progesterone
Mean allopregnanolone levels were lower in women with AN
and OW/OB women than HCs (AN 95.3 ± 56.4 and OW/OB
73.8 ± 31.3
vs
HCs
199.5 ± 167.8 pg/ml,
p = 0.02
and
p = 0.004, respectively; Table 1, Figure 3a). Mean serum
progesterone levels did not differ between groups (Table 1,
Figure 3b). Allopregnanolone levels were negatively asso-
ciated with severity of depression (Figure 4a) and anxiety
(Figure 4b), independent of BMI (HDRS whole model
R = − 0.55, p = 0.008; partial correlation coefficient R =
− 0.46, p = 0.008; and HAM-A whole model R = − 0.56,
p = 0.04; partial correlation coefficient R = − 0.37, p = 0.04).
In multivariable analysis controlling for BMI, 15% of the
variability in depression symptom severity and 11% of the
variability in anxiety symptom severity were attributable to
allopregnanolone levels. Within the AN group, strong,
inverse associations with allopregnanolone were observed
for depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of BMI
(HDRS whole model R = − 0.83, p = 0.003; partial correlation
coefficient R = − 0.81, p = 0.003; and HAM-A whole model
R = − 0.63, p = 0.08; partial correlation coefficient R = − 0.58,
p = 0.08; Figure 4c and d). There were no associations
between allopregnanolone levels and depressive or anxiety
symptoms within the HC or OW/OB groups. There was no
association between progesterone levels and depression or
anxiety severity. There was a trend toward a positive
association between progesterone and allopregnanolone
levels (R = 0.33, p = 0.09).
3α-Androstanediol and Parent-Compound Testosterone
Mean free testosterone levels were lower in the AN group
than both the HC and OW/OB groups (AN 1.8 ± 0.8 vs HC
3.6 ± 1.4
and
OW/OB
4.0 ± 2.2 pg/ml,
p = 0.008
and
p = 0.004, respectively; Table 1, Figure 3d). In contrast, there
was no difference in mean 3α-androstanediol between any of
the three groups (Table 1, Figure 3c). Free testosterone was
negatively associated with HDRS scores (R = − 0.42, p = 0.03)

 and HAM-A scores, (R = − 0.62, p = 0.0006). The association
of free testosterone with HDRS remained a trend and with
HAM-A remained significant when controlling for BMI
(HDRS whole model R = − 0.43, p = 0.08; partial correlation
coefficient R = − 0.35, p = 0.08; and HAM-A whole model
R = − 0.63, p = 0.006; partial correlation coefficient R =
− 0.53, p = 0.006). In a stepwise regression model, 18% of
the variability in depression symptom severity and 39% of
the variability in anxiety symptom severity was attributable
to serum-free testosterone levels when controlling for BMI.
Serum 3α-androstanediol levels, however, were not signifi-
cantly correlated with depression or anxiety symptom
severity in any of the subgroups (AN, HC, or OW/OB) or
the group as a whole. In addition, there was no association
between free testosterone and 3α-androstanediol levels.
DISCUSSION
The present study is the first to examine serum levels of the
neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone and 3α-androstane-
diol by GC-MS analysis in relation to affective symptoms in
women with AN and OW/OB, both of which are frequently
complicated by depression and/or anxiety. As hypothesized,
our data show that mean serum allopregnanolone levels are
lower in women with AN than in healthy controls.
Unexpectedly, our data also demonstrate that mean serum
allopregnanolone levels are lower in OW/OB women than in
healthy women. Moreover, allopregnanolone levels were
negatively associated with severity of depression and anxiety
symptoms, independent of BMI. This cross-sectional study
raises the question of whether a state of relative neuroactive
steroid deficiency, possibly through downregulation of one
of the two enzymes (5α-reductase and/or 3α-HSD), which
convert the parent hormones to their neuroactive metabo-
lites, may be a mechanism that contributes to the high rates
of depression and anxiety at the extremes of the weight
spectrum. Further studies are warranted to further explore
this hypothesis.
Whether relative allopregnanolone deficiency is implicated
in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric conditions,
including depression (Romeo et al, 1998; Schule et al, 2007;
Strohle et al, 1999; Uzunova et al, 1998), anxiety (Schule et al,
2014), and PTSD (Rasmusson et al, 2006), is an active area of
investigation that has been limited by the lack of availability,
high cost and time-consuming nature of GC-MS measure-
ments.
A
small
number
of
both
cross-sectional
and
prospective treatment studies have examined allopregnano-
lone levels by GC-MS in the serum and CSF of subjects with
MDD and PTSD, but no previous studies have explored the
role of neuroactive steroids by GC-MS in women with AN or
OW/OB. One small study of drug-naive men with MDD
demonstrated significantly lower serum allopregnanolone
levels compared with healthy controls (Romeo et al, 1998).

numbers of subjects with MDD, including drug-naive men
administered fluoxetine (Romeo et al, 1998), previously treated
outpatient subjects of both sexes given mirtazapine (Schule
et al, 2007), and inpatients of both sexes treated with various
regimens (including TCAs, SNRIs, and lithium) as determined
by their individual clinical providers (Romeo et al, 1998).
Moreover, CSF levels of allopregnanolone and its stereoisomer
pregnanolone combined (termed ‘ALLO’) were negatively
correlated with HDRS scores in men and women with MDD
(Uzunova et al, 1998). The CSF ALLO levels in these subjects
increased significantly after SSRI treatment, and the increase
in ALLO was significantly correlated with improvement in
depressive symptoms (Uzunova et al, 1998). In women with
PTSD, CSF ALLO levels were reduced by 60% compared with
healthy controls, with significant negative correlations between
the ALLO/DHEA ratio and PTSD and negative mood
symptoms (Rasmusson et al, 2006). Subjects with PTSD were
found to have normal levels of the allopregnanolone precursor,
5α-dihydroprogesterone, but a high 5α-dihydroprogesterone/
ALLO ratio, suggesting that the decrease in ALLO was either
due to a decrease in 3α-HSD expression or activity or
increased metabolism of ALLO. Thus, based on these data,
there is great interest in the possible mechanistic contribution
of allopregnanolone to mood symptoms.
However, two published studies demonstrated higher
allopregnanolone levels in women with AN and bulimia
nervosa compared with healthy controls (Galderisi et al,
2003; Monteleone et al, 2001), and authors postulated that
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation in subjects
with these disorders contributed to relatively higher allo-
pregnanolone levels. However, all of these studies were
limited by the use of radioimmunoassays, which lack
specificity (Cheney et al, 1995a; Siekmann, 1979).
There are limited data with regard to neuroactive steroids
across the weight spectrum. As hypothesized, our data show
that mean serum allopregnanolone levels measured by GC-
MS were lower in women with AN than in healthy controls.
Women with AN have low levels of sex steroids due to
hypothalamic amenorrhea; thus one would potentially expect
lower levels of neuroactive steroids due to less hormonal
substrate, though progesterone levels may not differ from
healthy, lean controls in the follicular phase. In contrast,
OW/OB women can have normal to supraphysiological
levels
of
hormonal
substrate
such
as
androgens
and
estrogens, and the only prior study that examined neuroac-
tive steroids in obesity showed that otherwise healthy, obese
adults had higher allopregnanolone than lean controls
(Monteleone et al, 2003). Thus it was somewhat unexpected
that serum allopregnanolone levels were lower in OW/OB
women vs healthy controls in this study. As noted earlier,
methodological differences in measurement of allopregna-
nolone may have contributed to differences in the results
between the current study and that by Monteleone et al
(2003); in addition, it is possible that the OW/OB sample in
the current study had a higher degree of affective symptoms.
Importantly, both the AN and OW/OB groups had lower
mean allopregnanolone serum levels and higher degrees of
depressive symptoms than healthy, lean controls. Addition-
ally, allopregnanolone levels were negatively associated with
severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in women

In the groups combined, serum allopregnanolone levels were significantly negatively associated with severity of depression (a) and anxiety (b)
symptoms, independent of BMI. Serum allopregnanolone levels were also significantly negatively correlated with severity of depression (c) and anxiety (d,
trend) symptoms independent of BMI in the anorexia nervosa group only. Figures adjusted for BMI (leverage plot shown) and partial correlation coefficients
are reported on the figure. Markers: Closed circles indicate AN subjects, open triangle indicates HC, and asterisk indicates OW/OB. Abbreviations: AN,

 across the weight spectrum independent of BMI. Overall,
these data suggest a possible mechanistic link between low
levels of allopregnanolone and affective symptoms, indepen-
dent of weight and differences in potential hormonal
substrate between the two groups.
Progesterone, the parent compound to allopregnanolone,
did not differ between groups across the weight spectrum in
the current study, and again, there was no relationship
between progesterone and affective symptoms, suggesting
that the regulation of neuroactive steroid production down-
stream from progesterone—at either 5α-reductase and/or 3α-
HSD—may be responsible for differences in mean allopreg-
nanolone levels in these groups and have a key role in these
conditions. This could be consistent with the work from
Girdler et al (2012) showing decreased conversion of
progesterone to allopregnanolone in women with a history
of depression. Research in a frog model also shows that
GABAA receptor activation can lead to a downregulation of
neuroactive steroid production, suggesting a potential nega-
tive feedback loop; however, this has not been investigated in
humans (Do-Rego et al, 2000). Thus, while neurosteroido-
genic pathways are well defined, the overall regulation of
neuroactive steroids is not yet fully understood.
In contrast to allopregnanolone, serum 3α-androstanediol
did not vary across the weight spectrum in this study, despite
lower levels of free testosterone, the parent compound, in
women with AN vs healthy and OW/OB women. Moreover,
greater depression and anxiety symptom severity was not
associated with serum 3α-androstanediol, despite an inverse
association of serum-free testosterone with both. The associa-
tion between serum testosterone levels and anxiety symptom
severity is consistent with prior work from our own group
demonstrating an inverse association between testosterone
levels and anxiety symptom severity in women with AN
(Miller
et
al,
2007b).
Furthermore,
a
significant
acute
improvement in depressive symptom severity was demon-
strated in response to low-dose testosterone administration in
women with AN in a pilot study (Miller et al, 2004). Moreover,
hypogonadal men have a higher rate of comorbid depression,
and testosterone administration in this population has been
shown to improve mood, as well (Wang et al, 2004; Wang et al,
2000). Interestingly, the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride has
been associated with an increase in depression in some men,
with studies showing a decrease in 5α-reduced neuroactive
steroids with treatment, as expected. Of note, however, these
studies did not quantify the impact of finasteride on
production of the 5α-reduced metabolites of progesterone
(Duskova et al, 2010). The 3α-HSD gene possesses a steroid
response element in its promoter, another possible site for
interaction between testosterone or derivatives of testosterone
such as estradiol and allopregnanolone synthesis in women
(Mitev et al, 2003; Penning and Drury, 2007).
Limitations of this study include its small size and cross-
sectional design. In addition, we did not include normal-
weight women with a prior clinical diagnosis of depression
and/or antidepressant use. We did measure hormones
consistently in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle,
which is a strength of the study, as this limited the impact of
large fluctuations of hormones such as estrogen and
progesterone, the latter being the precursor for allopregna-
nolone. Additionally, testosterone is known to increase by
approximately 20% at midcycle. Therefore, it is possible that
we would have observed stronger or different associations in
other phases of the menstrual cycle. It is also unclear whether
peripheral levels of these neuroactive steroids accurately
reflect central levels. With regard to testosterone specifically,
the lack of a link between 3α-androstanediol and affective
symptom severity could indicate that 3α-androstanediol is
not the most relevant centrally active neurosteroid metabolite
of testosterone. Given that the same enzymes convert
testosterone and progesterone into 3α-androstanediol and
allopregnanolone, respectively, it remains surprising that
only allopregnanolone levels were downregulated in AN and
OW/OB women but not 3α-androstanediol levels. Probably,
enzyme affinity for the substrates or other biosynthetic
mechanisms may be at play to dictate this apparent
discrepancy. A limitation of this study is that we did not
measure 5α-dihydroprogesterone and 5α-dihydrotestoster-
one; thus we cannot determine at which enzyme a block in
the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone may
have occurred. Finally, because our healthy controls and
overweight/obese populations were selected for the absence
of a depression diagnosis, our ability to detect an association
between neuroactive steroids and affective symptoms may
have been limited in these groups. Despite these limitations,
this is the only study we are aware of that combines
the use of careful follicular-phase sampling with GC/MS
measurements.
In conclusion, women at both extremes of the weight
spectrum have lower mean serum allopregnanolone levels
than healthy lean women, despite a lack of difference in
mean serum progesterone, the precursor of allopregnano-
lone. Moreover, greater depression and anxiety symptom
severity is negatively associated with serum allopregnano-
lone, but not progesterone, independent of BMI. Lack of a
strong association between allopregnanolone levels and the
parent-compound progesterone suggests that there could be
dysregulation of GABAergic neuroactive steroid synthesis or
metabolism in depressed women with AN and OW/OB
women. More studies are needed to better understand the
location and mechanisms of potential enzymatic dysregula-
tion in neuroactive steroid pathways in women with both
AN and OW/OB. Moreover, identification of centrally active
neurosteroids that impact affective dysregulation could lead
to a better understanding of the biological basis of depression
and anxiety with the potential for the development of new,
targeted therapies for these conditions.
