 Very Low-Calorie Diet and
6 Months of Weight Stability
in Type 2 Diabetes:
Pathophysiological Changes in
Responders and Nonresponders
Diabetes Care 2016;39:808–815 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-1942
OBJECTIVE
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is generally regarded as an irreversible chronic
condition. Because a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) can bring about acute return to
normal glucose control in some people with T2DM, this study tested the potential
durability of this normalization. The underlying mechanisms were defined.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
People with a T2DM duration of 0.5–23 years (n = 30) followed a VLCD for 8 weeks.
All oral agents or insulins were stopped at baseline. Following a stepped return to
isocaloric diet, a structured, individualized program of weight maintenance was
provided. Glucose control, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and hepatic and
pancreas fat content were quantified at baseline, after return to isocaloric diet,
and after 6 months to permit the primary comparison of change between post–
weight loss and 6 months in responders. Responders were defined as achieving
fasting blood glucose <7 mmol/L after return to isocaloric diet.
RESULTS
Weight fell (98.0 6 2.6 to 83.8 6 2.4 kg) and remained stable over 6 months
(84.7 6 2.5 kg). Twelve of 30 participants achieved fasting plasma glucose
<7 mmol/L after return to isocaloric diet (responders), and 13 of 30 after 6
months. Responders had a shorter duration of diabetes and a higher initial fasting
plasma insulin level. HbA1c fell from 7.1 6 0.3 to 5.8 6 0.2% (55 6 4 to 40 6
2 mmol/mol) in responders (P < 0.001) and from 8.4 6 0.3 to 8.0 6 0.5% (68 6 3 to
64 6 5 mmol/mol) in nonresponders, remaining constant at 6 months (5.9 6 0.2
and 7.8 6 0.3% [41 6 2 and 62 6 3 mmol/mol], respectively). The responders were
characterized by return of first-phase insulin response.
CONCLUSIONS
A robust and sustainable weight loss program achieved continuing remission of
diabetes for at least 6 months in the 40% who responded to a VLCD by achieving
fasting plasma glucose of <7 mmol/L. T2DM is a potentially reversible condition.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has reached
epidemic proportions, affecting 9.2%
of the U.S. population and costing the
country $322 billion in 2012 (1). The per-
sonal cost is enormous in terms of vision
loss, amputation, and premature cardio-
vascular disease. The inevitably progres-
sive nature of the disease has appeared
beyond question, as successive large
studies have confirmed clinical experi-
ence of inexorably worsening glucose
control (2,3). At diagnosis, patients are
advised to accept having a lifelong dis-
ease so that they can cope with T2DM
(4). Sequential addition of therapies is
required, and within 10 years of diagno-
sis, 50% of individuals are on insulin
therapy (3).
However, restoration of normal glu-
cose control is possible after weight
loss in some individuals with T2DM
(5–8). Although most commonly seen
after bariatric surgery, reversal of diabe-
tes can occur after any sharp decrease in
calorie intake (9,10). In short-duration
T2DM, fasting plasma glucose becomes
normal within days on a very low-calorie
diet (VLCD) because of a rapid decrease
in liver fat and return of normal hepatic
insulin sensitivity, and normal b-cell
function returns over 8 weeks (11). If
the demonstrated normalization of he-
patic insulin sensitivity and b-cell func-
tion could be maintained in the longer
term, this could change the entire ap-
proach to T2DM management.
The Counterbalance study (Counter-
acting BetA cell failure by Long term Ac-
tion to Normalize Calorie intakE) tests
the hypothesis that individuals who
achieve nondiabetic fasting blood glu-
cose after VLCD would remain normo-
glycemic during weight stability. The
pathophysiological mechanisms underly-
ing blood glucose control over 6 months
were defined.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design
This prospective, longitudinal, single-
center study comprised three phases:
VLCD for 8 weeks; a stepped return to
isocaloric intake of normal food over 2
weeks; and a structured, individualized
weight maintenance program over 6
months. Assessments were carried out
before the VLCD, after return to isocalo-
ric eating, and at the end of the 6-month
follow-up. The primary outcome mea-
sure was fasting blood glucose at
6 months in the group achieving nondi-
abetic levels after VLCD and return to
normal eating, and the primary compar-
ison was the change between post–
weight loss and 6 months in responders.
The study was an evaluation of the path-
ophysiological response to dietary
change rather than a comparative clini-
cal study of treatment. In this study, re-
sponders were defined as achieving
fasting blood glucose ,7 mmol/L after
return to an isocaloric diet. Immediately
after the 8-week VLCD, 87% of short-
and 50% of long-duration diabetes groups
achieved nondiabetic fasting plasma glu-
cose levels (12). The study was designed
to define the durability over 6 months
of the clinical and pathophysiological
changes after VLCD and return to isoca-
loric eating and did not include a control
group maintained on usual therapy.
Participants
Thirty individuals with T2DM were re-
cruited by advertisement. The study
was rapidly oversubscribed, and of the
48 individuals screened, 18 were ex-
cluded due to duration of diabetes or
HbA1c. To maximize detection of an ef-
fect of duration of T2DM, individuals
with either short-duration (,4 years)
or long-duration (.8 years) disease
were studied. Inclusion criteria were
age $25–80 years and BMI 27–45 kg/m2.
Exclusion criteria were recent weight
loss of .5 kg; treatment with thiazolidi-
nediones, GLP-1 agonists, steroids, or
atypical antipsychotics; HbA1c .9.5%
(80 mmol/mol); serum creatinine .150
mmol/L; or alcohol intake .3 units/day
(women) or .4 units/day (men). Partici-
pants discontinued all antidiabetic
therapy immediately before the baseline
study but remained on their usual lipid-
lowering treatment. Antihypertensive
medications were decreased as nec-
essary throughout the study. The study
protocol was approved by the Newcastle
and North Tyneside 2 Ethics Committee
(REC 12/NE/0208), and all participants
gave informed written consent.
Experimental Protocol
The VLCD consisted of a liquid diet for-
mula (43% carbohydrate, 34% protein,
and 19.5% fat; 2.6 MJ/day [624 kcal/day];
OPTIFAST; Nestl´
e Nutrition, Croydon, U.K.)
taken as three shakes per day. In addi-
tion, up to 240 g of nonstarchy vegeta-
bles was consumed, making total energy
intake 624–700 kcal/day. Participants
were encouraged to drink at least 2 L
of calorie-free beverages per day and
to maintain their habitual level of phys-
ical activity. To maximize adherence,
one-to-one support was provided
weekly by telephone, e-mail, text mes-
sage, or face-to-face contact (S.S.). Dur-
ing stepped food reintroduction, shakes
were gradually replaced by solid food
over 7 days; with one meal replacing a
shake every 3 days. Isocaloric intake was
determined from resting energy expen-
diture measured by indirect calorimetry
using an open circuit calorimeter (Quark
RMR; COSMED, Rome, Italy) and a can-
opy hood. Studies were conducted a
minimum of 6 days after full return to
solid foods. The standard threshold for
remission of diabetes (fasting plasma
glucose ,7 mmol/L) was used to define
the group of responders (13). In contrast
to the initial study (11), the criterion was
applied after return to isocaloric eating
to avoid an acute dietary effect.
During the 6-month weight mainte-
nance phase, participants were sup-
ported by a structured individualized
program based on goal setting, action
planning, and barrier identification,
with monthly reviews (14). The primary
goal of this phase was to prevent weight
regain by individualized dietary advice
guided by weight trajectory. Physical ac-
tivity was encouraged, but food behav-
iors were the priority. If fasting plasma
glucose exceeded 10 mmol/L on two oc-
casions, hypoglycemic agents were
recommenced.
As in an earlier study, participants
were excluded if they were unable to
achieve weight loss targets of 3.8%
body weight at week 1 of the VLCD
(11). Only one participant did not meet
the weight loss target and left the
study after week 1; therefore, 29 of
30 participants completed the VLCD
and 6-month weight maintenance
phase. All 29 completed data collection
at each time point.
Hepatic Glucose Production and
Insulin Sensitivity
After an overnight fast, cannulae were
inserted into an antecubital vein for in-
fusion and the contralateral wrist vein
for arterialized blood sampling. [6969-2H]
glucose (98% enriched; Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA) was used
to determine hepatic glucose production
(11). Basal rates were calculated during
care.diabetesjournals.org

 the last 30 min of the 150-min basal pe-
riod. An isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic
clamp (insulin infusion rate 40 mU z
m22 z min21) was initiated at 0 min,
with isoglycemia selected to ensure that
the true metabolic condition of each par-
ticipant could be observed at each study
time point. Whole-body insulin sensitivity
was determined during the last 30 min of
the 120-min hyperinsulinemic glucose
clamp expressed per kilogram of fat-free
mass (ffm) corrected for glucose space
and urinary loss (11). Muscle insulin sen-
sitivity was calculated as the sum of the
glucose disposal rate and basal hepatic
glucose production minus the urinary glu-
cose loss. Hepatic insulin resistance index
was calculated as the product of basal
hepatic glucose production and fasting
insulin levels (15).
Measurement of Hepatic VLDL1-
Triglyceride Production Rates
VLDL1-triglyceride production rate was
measured by accumulation of plasma
VLDL1-triglyceride during competitive
blockade of tissue uptake by excess In-
tralipid (16,17). After an overnight fast,
20% Intralipid (0.1 g/kg body mass) was
injected as a bolus followed bycontinuous
infusion of 10% Intralipid at 0.1 g/kg/h.
Plasma samples were collected at eight
points over 75 min. After centrifugation
and ultracentrifugation to separate
plasma, remove chylomicrons and Intra-
lipid, and isolate VLDL1, the triglyceride
concentration of VLDL1 was measured.
VLDL1-triglyceride production rates were
calculated from the gradient of the linear
increase in concentration over time.
Assessment of b-Cell Function
At least 60 min after the clamp test,
when glucose levels had stabilized to
fasting levels, two consecutive 30-min
square-wave steps of hyperglycemia
(2.8 and 5.6 mmol/L above baseline)
were achieved by priming glucose doses
followed by variable 20% glucose infu-
sion (18). Blood samples for determina-
tion of C-peptide concentrations were
obtained every 2 min for the first
10 min, then every 5 min for each step.
An arginine bolus was administered dur-
ing the second step of hyperglycemia to
assess maximal insulin secretory capacity,
followed by sampling every 2 min for
10 min. Insulin secretion rate was calcu-
lated by using a computerized program
implementing a regularization method of
deconvolution and by using a population
model of C-peptide kinetics as previously
described (11).
Body Composition and Intraorgan
Triglyceride Content
Body composition was determined
with a Bodystat1500 (Bodystat Ltd.,
Isle of Man, U.K.). Magnetic resonance
data were acquired by using a 3T Philips
Achieva scanner (Philips, Best, The
Netherlands) with either a six-channel
cardiac array (Philips) or four large sur-
face coils (large and medium flex coils;
Philips) if required due to body habitus.
Data were acquired by three-point
Dixon method, with gradient-echo scans
acquired during four 17-s breath holds,
as previously described (11). The intra-
organ triglyceride percentage was eval-
uated from regions of interest on two
image slices of pancreas and five image
slices of liver, defined and averaged by
one observer (S.S.). The pancreas tri-
glyceride analysis was carried out while
blinded to the participants’ details and
time point.
Analytical Procedures
Plasma hormones and metabolites were
measured at a Clinical Pathology Accredita-
tion laboratory (Newcastle upon Tyne Hos-
pital NHS Foundation Trust, Department of
Clinical Biochemistry). VLDL1-triglyceride
was analyzed at the Institute of Cardiovas-
cular and Medical Sciences, University of
Glasgow, using standard methods (Roche
Diagnostics, West Sussex, U.K.). Immediate
measurement of b-hydroxybutyrate levels
to test dietary compliance was carried out
using test strips (Abbott Diabetes Care,
Oxfordshire, U.K.).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean 6 SEM for
parametric and median (range) for non-
parametric data. Statistical analysis using
Student paired and two-sample t test,
Mann Whitney U test, Wilcoxon rank
sum test, and Spearman rank correlation
as appropriate was performed with the
Minitab 16 statistical program (Minitab
Inc., State College, PA).
RESULTS
In the whole group, weight fell from
98.0 6 2.6 kg at baseline to 83.8 6
2.4 kg during the VLCD (P , 0.001) and
remained at 84.7 6 2.5 kg after 6 months.
After return to isocaloric eating, 40% of
participants (12 of 30) achieved a fasting
glucose ,7.0 mmol/L (responders). After
6 months of weight loss maintenance,
43% (13 of 30) had a fasting plasma glu-
cose ,7 mmol/L while off all oral hypo-
glycemic agents or insulin.
In the responders, fasting plasma
glucose fell from 8.9 6 0.7 to 6.2 6
0.1 mmol/L (P = 0.002) on isocaloric
diet post-VLCD and remained constant
at 6.2 6 0.3 mmol/L on no hypoglycemic
agents (Fig. 1A). In the nonresponders,
fasting plasma glucose fell from 13.2 6
0.6 to 10.9 6 1.1 mmol/L (P = 0.016)
post-VLCD and remained constant at
9.4 6 0.7 mmol/L. The rise in plasma
glucose over the 2 weeks from the end
of the VLCD to establishment on an
isocaloric diet was significantly greater
in nonresponders (Fig. 1A, shaded
bar), and six individuals in this group
restarted
medication
during
the
6-month weight loss maintenance period
(two metformin only, three metformin
and sulfonylurea, and one insulin). HbA1c
remained stable throughout the 6-month
period in both groups (responders

nonresponders 8.0 6 0.5 to 7.8 6 0.3%
[64 6 5 to 62 6 3 mmol/mol], P = 0.481)
(Fig.1B).The major improvementin blood
pressure and triglyceride and non-HDL
cholesterol levels after the VLCD in both
responders and nonresponders was main-
tained over the 6-month weight mainte-
nance period (Table 1). At baseline, 17
participantsweretakingantihypertensive
agents, and these were decreased in dose
or stopped in 8 participants, as follows:
bumetanide (n = 1), nifedipine (n = 1),
amlodipine (n = 1), doxazosin (n = 2),
ACE inhibitor (n = 2), and b-blocker (n = 1).
Clinical Features of Responders
Compared With Nonresponders
Achieved weight loss after VLCD was
similar between the responders and
nonresponders (15.8 6 0.5% vs. 13.6 6
0.7%, P = 0.06). Weight remained
constant over 6 months in both groups
(Table 1 and Fig. 1C). The responders
(n = 12 [8 males, 4 females]) had a
shorter diabetes duration (3.8 6 1.0 vs.
9.861.6years, P= 0.007) andwere youn-
ger (52.0 6 2.9 vs. 59.9 6 2.1 years, P =
0.032) than nonresponders (n = 17 [7 ma-
les, 10 females]). Responders comprised
9 of 15 of the short-duration group and 3
of 14 of the long-duration group. At base-
line, responders had lower fasting glucose
(8.9 6 0.7 vs. 13.2 6 0.6 mmol/L,
P , 0.001) and HbA1c (7.1 6 0.3 vs. 8.4 6
0.3% [55 6 4 vs. 68 6 3 mmol/mol], P =
0.01). Achieved fasting glucose level
after VLCD was positively correlated
with diabetes duration (Rs 0.59, P =
0.001). Although there was no difference
between nonresponders and responders
in terms of initial weight or BMI, the total
fat mass was higher in nonresponders at
baseline (P = 0.04) (Table 1). There was no
difference in the achieved fasting
plasma glucose after the VLCD in indi-
viduals with BMI . or ,35 kg/m2 at
baseline (8.2 vs. 7.1 mmol/L, P = 0.84),
with 3 of 10 versus 9 of 19 responders,
respectively. Before the study, the re-
sponders were on less treatment for di-
abetes than nonresponders, as follows:
diet control (five vs. two); metformin
only (six vs. four); metformin and sulfo-
nylurea (one vs. seven); metformin, sul-
fonylurea, and insulin (zero vs. two);
metformin, sulfonylurea, and thiazolidi-
nedione (zero vs. one); and insulin only
(zero vs. one).

 Change in Plasma Hormones
and Metabolites
Responders were characterized by
higher baseline serum insulin levels
compared with nonresponders (20.4
[5.7–48.1] vs. 9.3 [3.9–48.9] mU/L, P =
0.005). This state of relative insulin defi-
ciency in the nonresponders was reflected
in higher baseline fasting ketone levels
(0.20 [0.10–1.10] vs. 0.10 [0.10–0.30]
mmol/L, P = 0.02) and free fatty acid levels
(0.69 6 0.04 vs. 0.51 6 0.05 mmol/L, P =
0.01). Plasma insulin levels fell in both
groups after the VLCD and remained sta-
ble throughout the weight maintenance
phase (Table 1). Fasting serum triglyceride
levels fell by 32 6 7% in responders
and 18 6 9% in nonresponders. After
6 months, HDL cholesterol was raised by
27% in responders.

Hepatic insulin resistance improved
similarly in both groups after the VLCD

cant change in hepatic insulin resistance

Marked normalization in hepatic tri-
glyceride content was seen in both the
responders (12.8 6 2.7 to 2.2 6 0.2%,
P = 0.002) and the nonresponders (8.2 6
1.1 to 2.2 6 0.1%, P , 0.001) after the
VLCD. Serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels decreased only in the re-
sponders (Table 1). There was no reac-
cumulation of hepatic triglyceride
during the 6-month weight mainte-
nance period in either responders or
nonresponders (2.1 6 0.3 vs. 2.3 6
0.2%, respectively) (Fig. 2A). Responders
had higher ALT levels (43.0 [11.0–151.0]
vs. 22.0 [12.0–61.0] units/L, P = 0.02), and
this was accompanied by a tendency to
higher hepatic triglyceride content at
baseline compared with nonresponders
(12.8 6 2.7 vs. 8.2 6 1.1%, P = 0.09)
(Fig. 2A).
Hepatic VLDL1-triglyceride produc-
tion rate was similar in the two groups
at baseline: 411.0 6 49.5 vs. 437.2 6
32.4 mg/kg/day in responders vs. non-
responders. It fell by ;20% after VLCD
in both groups, remaining stable during
weight maintenance (Fig. 2C).
Pancreas
First-phase insulin response was mark-
edly reduced at baseline in nonre-
sponders compared with responders
(0.01 6 0.00 vs. 0.12 6 0.04 nmol z
min21 z m22, P = 0.002). Similarly, max-
imal insulin secretory capacity (base-
line to peak insulin secretion rate) was
significantly impaired (0.21 6 0.03 vs.
1.06 6 0.35 nmol z min21 z m22,
P = 0.008).
First-phase insulin response improved
in the responders (0.12 6 0.04 to
0.26 6 0.07 nmol z min21 z m22, P =
0.03), and there was a small increase in
the nonresponders (0.01 6 0.00 to
0.03 6 0.01 nmol z min21 z m22, P =
0.04) (Fig. 3A). There was no change in
maximal insulin secretory capacity in ei-
ther group (responders 1.06 6 0.35 to
0.81 6 0.16 nmol z min21 z m22, P =
0.363; nonresponders 0.21 6 0.03 to
0.25 6 0.05 nmol z min21 z m22, P = 0.30).
First-phase insulin secretion did not
change over the weight maintenance
period in either responders or nonre-
sponders (0.26 6 0.07 to 0.24 6 0.05
vs. 0.03 6 0.01 to 0.03 6 0.01 nmol z
min21 z m22) (Fig. 3). There was no
change in maximal insulin secretory
capacity.
At baseline, pancreas fat levels were
similar in responders and nonresponders
(5.3 6 0.4 vs. 5.9 6 0.7%, P = 0.49). After
the VLCD, there was a significant de-
crease in pancreas fat content in both
groups (responders 5.3 6 0.4 to 4.5 6
0.3%, P = 0.039; nonresponders 5.9 6
0.7 to 5.3 6 0.5%, P = 0.004) (Fig. 3B).
Pancreas fat content remained stable
during weight maintenance (4.4 6 0.3%
and 5.0 6 0.5%).
Adipose Tissue and Muscle
There was no difference in either vis-
ceral adipose tissue or subcutaneous
adipose tissue areas between groups
at baseline (responders 287.0 6 23.1

subcutaneous adipose tissue areas de-
creased after the VLCD and then remained
constant during the 6-month follow-up
(responders: visceral 287.0 6 23.1 to

cant improvement in muscle insulin sensi-
tivity after the VLCD (responders 5.9 6 0.4
at baseline, 7.0 6 0.6 after VLCD, and
7.2 6 0.8 mg/kgffm/min at month 6; non-
responders 8.9 6 1.3, 9.0 6 0.9, and
10.4 6 1.2 mg/kgffm/min).
CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that in 40% of study
participants who responded to a VLCD
by achieving fasting plasma glucose ,7
mmol/L, remission of T2DM lasts for at
least 6 months. Return to nondiabetic
blood glucose levels was characterized
by improvement in acute insulin secre-
tion, and this was sustained while off all
hypoglycemic agents. Hepatic insulin
sensitivity improved in both responders
and nonresponders. The structured, in-
dividualized weight maintenance pro-
gram was successful in preventing
weight gain.
Weight loss brought about normali-
zation of liver fat content and insulin
sensitivity in both responders and non-
responders. Of note, no redistribution of
fat was seen to the liver from the sub-
cutaneous or other deposits over 6
months of weight stability, even though
the participants remained obese or over-
weight (Table 1). This finding supports
the concept of a personal fat threshold
above which adipose tissue cannot store
the available triglyceride (19) and has
major implications for the management
of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Achievement of normal liver fat content
was accompanied by a 20% decrease in
rate of production of VLDL1-triglyceride,
the lipoprotein responsible for deliv-
ery of triglyceride to all extrahepatic
cells and tissues. The observed fall
in pancreas fat is a secondary conse-
quence of decreased tissue delivery of
triglyceride.
The responders differed primarily in
having higher baseline plasma insulin
levels and a degree of b-cell response
to intravenous glucose. Recovery of
acute insulin secretory capacity to non-
diabetic levels (20,21) was seen in re-
sponders and not in nonresponders.
The constancy of the arginine-induced
insulin response implies persistence of
the insulin secretory mechanism in re-
versible T2DM despite loss of glucose
responsiveness. This is consistent with
T2DM being a condition of b-cell dedif-
ferentiation rather than b-cell loss. Non-
responders were characterized by
evidence of insulin deficiency at base-
line and lack of ability to regenerate in-
sulin secretion capacity. In the human
pancreas, the magnetic resonance tech-
nique detects the total intra- and extra-
cellular triglyceride in exocrine and
endocrine cells, and this is decreased
uniquely in T2DM after weight loss
(20). The importance of pancreas triglyc-
eride in the pathogenesis of T2DM was
initially shown in obese rodents, with
local lipolysis bringing about fatty
acid–mediated inhibition of b-cell func-
tion (22). Exposure to even modest con-
centrations of fatty acids causes marked
triglyceride accumulation in human is-
lets in vitro (23). Chronic exposure of
b-cells to triglyceride or fatty acids in
vitro decreases b-cell capacity to re-
spond to an acute increase in glucose
levels (24,25), and if b-cell fatty acid re-
ceptors are knocked out, insulin secre-
tion returns to normal (26). In the
human pancreas, intracellular fat drop-
lets are widely distributed within the
exocrine pancreatic cells in addition to
widely scattered isolated adipocytes
(27). Local lipolysis will bring about in-
terstitial and intracellular concentra-
tions of fatty acids sufficient to inhibit
b-cell function, and the data suggest
that removal of the excess fat allows re-
covery of function. We hypothesize that
in the responders, release from fat-
mediated inhibition allows expression
of a remaining latent capacity for glu-
cose-responsive insulin secretion.
Current concepts of T2DM have been
powerfully shaped by several large stud-
ies that have demonstrated a steadily
increasing requirement for hypoglyce-
mic agents over years (2,28,29). In par-
ticular, the inexorable loss of b-cell
function observed during the UK Pro-
spective Diabetes Study reinforced the
view of T2DM as irreversible and pro-
gressive (3,30). However, progressive
weight gain over time occurred during
these long-term observations, and
hence, the published data have shown
T2DM to be irreversible only during
chronic positive calorie balance. The
present demonstration of ongoing re-
versal of T2DM (in 41% of the cohort
overall or 60% of individuals with
short-duration diabetes) is reflected
in population data that indicate that
T2DM is solely a response to overnutri-
tion. Ready access to low-cost food is
uniformly accompanied by high rates
of T2DM (31–33), and when food sup-
ply becomes limited for any reason, the
prevalence of T2DM falls (34,35).
The question of possible therapeutic
application of VLCD for T2DM was raised
immediately on publication of the Coun-
terpoint study (36). The present data
confirm reversal of T2DM for at least
6 months in those who achieve nondia-
betic plasma glucose levels after VLCD.
However, the critical question for
health care delivery is whether truly
long-term reversal of T2DM can be
achieved in primary care. To answer
this question, a community-based study
(DiRECT [Diabetes Remission Clinical Tri-
al]) is now under way in 280 people with
T2DM randomized to VLCD with struc-
tured individualized weight maintenance
or to best-possible guideline-based
care. The overall effect of the alternative
approaches will be assessed, as the im-
pact of weight loss on blood pressure
and lipids is considerable even if plasma
glucose levels do not normalize. Being
able to stop taking multiple tablets is
important to people with T2DM, and
the potential associated health care sav-
ings are great indeed.
The likelihood of VLCD responders re-
maining free of diabetes indefinitely
must be considered. After media cover-
age of our earlier study, many people
with T2DM reversed their own diabetes
(37). For such motivated individuals
who avoid weight regain, maintenance
of normoglycemia for up to 3 years has
been reported (37,38). Follow-up at 4
years of the Look AHEAD (Action for
Health in Diabetes) study with only
8.6% weight loss achieved a remission
of diabetes in 7.3% of the intervention
group (39). Because progression of long-
term complications of diabetes relates
to ambient blood glucose control,

 durable reversal of diabetes would be
expected to be associated with long-
term health. The effect of a period of
normoglycemia confers substantial ben-
efits in decreasing the risk of complica-
tions, even if hyperglycemia recurs (40).
Whether blood glucose control normal-
ized, a major benefit in vascular risk was
achieved in terms of reduction of blood
pressure and blood lipids. Long-term
prospective study of VLCD followed
by a weight maintenance program is
now required to define overall benefit.
The intense motivation to return to
normal health in a proportion of people
with T2DM has not been widely recog-
nized. Such individuals respond readily
to simple, unambiguous advice to lose
weight (37). For those people who have
repeatedly failed to lose weight over
many years, this approach is much less
likely to succeed. Severely obese subjects
are selected for bariatric surgery after all
other methods to lose weight have failed,
and this group is appropriately treated.
However, ;50% of newly diagnosed indi-
viduals inthe U.K. have a BMI ,30 kg/m2,
and in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study,
36% had a BMI ,25 kg/m2 (19). The over-
all proportion of people with T2DM who
will be able to succeed in the significant
long-term lifestyle modification required
for VLCD and subsequent weight mainte-
nance with ongoing support remains to
be determined.
The VLCD was found to be acceptable
as indicated by the low dropout rate in
both this and the previous study (11).
The principal reason reported was the
absence of hunger at this level of calorie
intake. The main difficulty was readjust-
ing to normal eating after the VLCD, and
this was mitigated by definitive prescrip-
tion of food type and amount during the
food reintroduction and weight main-
tenance phase. Of note, the need to
become used to eating approximately
one-third less than previously had been
explained in advance. The weight main-
tenance program, with its clear focus on
calorie restriction, individual identifica-
tion of potential barriers, and monthly
contact with S.S. was successful in
avoiding weight gain during the 6-month
follow-up period. The separate effects of
very low-calorie intake itself and change
in underlying pathophysiology were
defined by the rise in plasma glucose be-
fore and after return to isocaloric eating
(Fig. 1).
The limitations of the study must be
considered. Fewer than one-half of par-
ticipants (12 of 30) were classified as
responders based on achieving a fasting
glucose of ,7 mmol/L on no antidia-
betic medication treatment at the time
point immediately after return to isoca-
loric diet. The study had a small sample
size, although the effect size was larger
than in pharmacological studies of one
or more hypoglycemic agents (41), and
the results are definitive. The group size
was determined by our previous obser-
vations (11) to achieve the specific aims
of the study, to examine whether those
who achieve nondiabetic fasting blood
glucose after VLCD would remain normo-
glycemic during weight stability, and
to determine underlying mechanisms.
This was not primarily a treatment trial
but rather a pathophysiological study to
achieve proof of concept. Six-month fol-
low-up is sufficient to detect any redistri-
bution of fat stores during an isocaloric
diet, although longer duration studies
are required to define effectiveness as a
routine clinical treatment. The group
studied was representative of the wider
T2DM population, predominantly Cauca-
sian in the northeast of England. Study of
other ethnic groups is required. The het-
erogeneous group studied represents
the spectrum of individuals with T2DM
who may wish to undertake calorie
restriction. A gold standard insulin secre-
tion test was used rather than a test
meal to define the acute insulin response
because loss of this parameter is a char-
acteristic of T2DM.
T2DM can now be understood to be a
metabolic syndrome potentially revers-
ible by substantial weight loss, and this
is an important paradigm shift. Not all
people with T2DM will be willing to
make the changes necessary, but for
those who do, metabolic health may
be regained and sustained in just under
one-half. The observations carry pro-
found implications for the health of in-
dividuals and for the economics of
future health care.
