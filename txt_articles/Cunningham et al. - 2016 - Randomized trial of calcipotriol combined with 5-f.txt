Introduction
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has emerged as a potent 
inducer of antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin, as it has 
the potential to significantly improve the treatment of skin can-
cers (1–3). TSLP is an epithelium-derived cytokine and a master 
regulator of allergic inflammation in the skin (4). We and others 
have demonstrated that TSLP released by barrier-defective skin 
in mice blocks cancer development by recruiting T cells to mount 
robust antitumor immunity in the skin (1–3). The adaptive immune 
response mounted by TSLP against cancer can eliminate cancer-
ous lesions in the skin and prevent new lesions from developing 
(1). These findings are consistent with epidemiological data sug-
gesting that patients with allergic skin inflammation are protected 
from skin cancer (5–8). TSLP expression and its immune effects in 
the skin can be induced by calcipotriol (calcipotriene), an FDA-ap-
proved topical medication for psoriasis (9–11). To determine 
the efficacy of TSLP induction as a novel immunotherapeutic 
approach for cancer, we investigated the effect of calcipotriol on 
skin carcinogenesis in genetically engineered mouse models and 
in patients with actinic keratosis.
Premalignant lesions of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) are identified clinically as actinic keratoses (12, 13). Sev-
eral field-directed treatments including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 
diclofenac, ingenol, and imiquimod have been approved for the 
treatment of sun-damaged skin with multiple actinic keratoses 
(13–15). However, the long treatment duration and the severity 
BACKGROUND. Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Long treatment durations and 
severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin 
(TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin. Here, 
we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an 
immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.
METHODS. The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse 
models. The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline 
plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants. The 
assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice 
daily for 4 consecutive days. The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin 
reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.
RESULTS. Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner. Four-day application 
of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic 
keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001). Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP
, HLA class II, and natural 
killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, 
which peaked on days 10–11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.
CONCLUSION. Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a 
CD4+ T cell–mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.

antitumor immunity against skin cancer development (1–3). We 
examined the efficacy of topical TSLP induction by calcipotri-
ol (9, 10, 17) in blocking skin cancer development in a standard 
chemical skin carcinogenesis model in mice (18). Three times 
weekly application of calcipotriol to the back skin during skin 
cancer induction led to TSLP expression (P < 0.05; Supplemen-
tal Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this 
article; doi:10.1172/JCI89820DS1) and a significant delay in skin 
tumor development compared with EtOH (carrier) treatment in 
WT animals (P < 0.01; Figure 1A). In addition, significantly fewer 
tumors developed in the calcipotriol-treated mice (P < 0.05; Fig-
ure 1B), and the tumors that developed were significantly smaller 
than those of the EtOH-treated animals (P < 0.01; Supplemental 
Figure 1B). Of note, calcipotriol did not protect TSLP receptor–
deficient (Tslpr-deficient, referred to herein as TSLPR–/–) mice 
from skin cancer development (Figure 1, A and B, and Supple-
mental Figure 1). These results demonstrate that topical calcipo-
triol treatment blocks skin cancer development by inducing TSLP 
expression in the skin.
Impact of transient TSLP induction by calcipotriol on skin car-
cinogenesis. To determine the efficacy of a short TSLP-inductive 
regimen for skin cancer treatment, we devised an experimental 
of the side effects associated with these topical treatments have 
limited patient compliance and, consequently, therapeutic effi-
cacy. Considering that actinic keratoses constitute the third most 
common reason for consulting a dermatologist (12) and incur an 
annual cost of over $900 million in the United States (16), the 
development of an effective treatment to eliminate actinic kerato-
ses and prevent progression to skin cancer with fewer applications 
and side effects would have a major impact on healthcare.
Here, we investigated the effect of topical calcipotriol treat-
ment on skin cancer development in mouse models of skin car-
cinogenesis. Using genetic engineering and innovative topical 
application paradigms in mice, we determined the mechanism 
of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis. Next, we per-
formed an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind clin-
ical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of a combination 
of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment and 5% 5-FU cream compared 
with Vaseline (petroleum jelly) plus 5-FU for a 4-day treatment of 
actinic keratoses on the face, scalp, and upper extremities.

0.005% calcipotriol ointment (final concentration, 0.0025%) in 
combination with 5% 5-FU cream (final concentration, 2.5%), 
twice daily for 4 days, as a novel immunotherapeutic regimen for 
actinic keratosis.
Study population. Patients with actinic keratosis who met the 
eligibility criteria were referred to the study from several clinical 
sites within our academic center. A total of 132 patients (of 175 
screened) were enrolled and underwent randomization (Figure 
2). Sixty-five participants were randomized to receive calcipotriol 
plus 5-FU; all completed the study, but 1 participant was exclud-
ed from the final analysis due to a recent diagnosis of immuno-
suppression. Sixty-seven participants were randomized to receive 
Vaseline plus 5-FU; 66 completed the study, but 1 relocated and 
missed the final clinical visit (Figure 2). All the participants com-
pleted the treatment course and underwent clinical evaluation 
before treatment (day 0), immediately after treatment (day 5), and 
8 weeks after treatment (Supplemental Figure 3).
Demographics, skin type, clinical parameters, and amount of 
medication used per anatomical site were similar between the 2 
groups (Table 1). All participants in the study had a history of cryo-
therapy. Nearly half of the participants also had a history of actinic 
keratosis field treatment in the past (Table 1). The median baseline 
number of actinic keratoses for all anatomical sites was 12 or more 
in both groups (Table 1).
Study outcomes. Topical calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination ver-
sus Vaseline plus 5-FU twice-daily treatment for 4 days led to a mean 
reduction in the number of actinic keratoses of 87.8% versus 26.3% 
on the face, 76.4% versus 5.7% on the scalp, 68.8% versus 9.6% on the 
right upper extremity (RUE), and 79% versus 16.3% on the left upper 
extremity (LUE) by week 8 (P < 0.0001 for all anatomical sites; Fig-
ure 3). Interestingly, the only participant who was excluded from the 
final analysis due to immunosuppression belonged to the calcipotriol 
plus 5-FU group and showed a 19% reduction in the number of actinic 
keratoses on his face after treatment (red circle; Figure 3). The greater 
efficacy of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU treatment 
in eliminating actinic keratoses remained highly significant after con-
trolling for the baseline actinic keratosis count, age, and sex of the 
paradigm in which calcipotriol was applied as a short pulse during 
the initial phase of tumor development in DMBA-TPA–treated 
(7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene–12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 
13-
acetate–treated) animals (Figure 1C). In this study, calcipotriol 
was applied to the animals’ ears daily for 3 consecutive days at the 
time point when the first tumors started to appear on the back skin 
of the animals (Figure 1C). The short calcipotriol treatment regi-
men led to significantly elevated serum TSLP levels (P < 0.05; Fig-
ure 1D). The transient elevation in circulating TSLP levels led to a 
long-lasting antitumor effect in the animals’ back skin as shown 
by a significant reduction in new tumor formation and the growth 
arrest among the remaining tumors in the calcipotriol-treated ani-
mals compared with the EtOH-treated controls (P < 0.05; Figure 1, 
E and F). This discovery highlights the potential of calcipotriol as 
an effective and safe topical agent for skin cancer immunotherapy 
and prevention.
Clinical trial. To determine the efficacy of TSLP induction as 
a cancer immunotherapeutic approach in humans, we focused on 
the use of topical calcipotriol for the treatment of actinic kerato-
sis. Calcipotriol is a well-tolerated topical medication for psoriasis 
(19). However, the low concentration of calcipotriol in the clinical-
ly available formulation (0.005% ointment) dampened its effect 
against skin cancer development in mice (Supplemental Figure 2). 
In addition, 0.005% calcipotriol monotherapy has shown modest 
efficacy in actinic keratosis clearance after a 12-week application, 
accompanied by a lack of inflammation at the treatment sites, 
suggesting the absence of immune activation with 0.005% cal-
cipotriol alone (20). Therefore, we hypothesized that combining 
0.005% calcipotriol ointment with 5% 5-FU cream would height-
en the immune-activating potential of calcipotriol. 5-FU is the 
standard of care for field treatment of actinic keratosis (21). As a 
monotherapy, 5-FU is used twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks in order to 
be effective (21); however, a shorter duration of 5-FU treatment 
may still induce the immunostimulatory signals (22) needed to 
fully activate the adaptive immune cells responding to a lower 
dose of calcipotriol. Hence, in a randomized, double-blind clin-
ical trial, we examined the efficacy and safety of treatment with 
Figure 2. CONSORT diagram of the clinical trial. Flow chart shows the number of patients who were screened, randomized into the treatment groups, 
completed the study, and included in the final analysis.

Although the primary and secondary endpoints of the study 
were focused on the elimination of the actinic keratoses, partici-
pants with hypertrophic actinic keratoses in the calcipotriol plus 
5-FU group experienced marked reductions in the size of their 
hypertrophic lesions after treatment (Supplemental Figure 7). 
Among the participants in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group who 
had a previous history of actinic keratosis field treatment, 82% 
found the current treatment to be more effective than their previ-
ous treatments compared with 11% of participants in the Vaseline 
plus 5-FU group (P < 0.0001; Supplemental Table 1).
Skin reaction. The high efficacy of calcipotriol plus 5-FU 
treatment was associated with marked erythema centered 
around the actinic keratoses after treatment (day 5; Figure 
4A). Grading the skin reaction using a clinical erythema scale 
(Supplemental Table 2) revealed a significantly higher erythe-
ma score among the participants in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU 
group compared with those in the Vaseline plus 5-FU group for 
all the anatomical sites by day 5 (P < 0.0001 for face and scalp, 
 
P < 0.01 for RUE and LUE; Figure 4B and Supplemental Table 3). 
The extent and intensity of the erythema on color-normalized 
images from day 5 (Supplemental Figure 8 and Supplemental 
Figure 9A) revealed a significantly greater extent and intensity 
of erythema on the face and scalp in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU–
treated group compared with the Vaseline plus 5-FU–treated 
group, with the forehead scoring the highest (Supplemental 
Figure 9B). According to the participants’ reporting at week 2, 
two distinct patterns of erythema resolution emerged: (a) wors-
ening of the erythema after the end of the treatment, with its 
peak on days 10–11, accompanied by pealing of the affected skin 
before complete resolution (delayed pattern); and (b) a gradual 
resolution of erythema immediately after the end of the treat-
ment (fast pattern; Supplemental Figure 10). Ninety-one per-
cent of the participants in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment 
group reported a delayed pattern of erythema resolution, while 
only 6% of the participants in the Vaseline plus 5-FU treatment 
group experienced delayed resolution of their skin erythema 
(P < 0.0001; Table 2). The only participant in the calcipotriol 
plus 5-FU group who did not show any erythema on the face on 
day 5 (erythema score = 0) went on to develop significant ery-
thema with exfoliation by day 11 (Supplemental Figure 11). All 
skin reactions, including the severe cases of erythema in the 
calcipotriol plus 5-FU group, resolved around week 2 after the 
treatment (Supplemental Figures 11 and 12).
Adverse events. Consistent with the clinical erythema scores 
on day 5, a significantly higher percentage of the participants in 
the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group reported skin redness during 
the treatment period (P < 0.0001; Table 2). In addition, 39% of 
the participants in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group experienced 
a burning sensation on the treated skin compared with 13% of 
the participants in the Vaseline plus 5-FU group (P < 0.001; 
Table 2). A similar percentage of participants in both groups 
reported scaling and itching of the treated skin during the 
4-day treatment period (Table 2). No crusting or wounding was 
observed on the skin of the study participants, whereas such 
morbidities are common in response to 2 to 4 weeks of 5-FU 
cream treatment (Supplemental Figure 13) (21). No pain, scar-
ring, oozing, vesiculation, pustulation, pigmentary changes, or 
participants (P <0.0001 for all anatomical sites; Supplemental Figure 
4). In addition, the anatomical site of the treatment did not impact the 
efficacy of calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination treatment in eliminat-
ing actinic keratoses (Supplemental Figure 5).
In the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group, 27% of participants had 
complete clearance of actinic keratoses on the face compared with 
0% of participants in the Vaseline plus 5-FU group (P < 0.0001; 
Supplemental Figure 6). Participants in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU 
group had 80%, 56%, 30%, and 56% partial clearance of actinic 
keratoses on the face, scalp, RUE, and LUE, respectively, com-
pared with 0%, 0%, 4%, and 3% of participants in the Vaseline 
plus 5-FU group (P < 0.0001 for face, scalp, and LUE; P < 0.01 
for RUE; Supplemental Figure 6). All participants in the calcipo-
triol plus 5-FU group experienced a reduction in actinic keratosis 
counts on all their treated anatomical sites compared with 80%, 
71%, 65%, and 77% on the face, scalp, RUE, and LUE, respective-
ly, for participants in the Vaseline plus 5-FU group (P < 0. 01 for all 
anatomical sites; Supplemental Figure 6).

cells were present together with CD4+ T cells in calcipotriol plus 
5-FU–treated lesions, including HAM-56+CD11c– dermal mac-
rophages (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 15). HLA class II 
expression was also detectable on lesional keratinocytes, indic-
ative of an immune rejection of actinic keratoses in the calcipo-
triol plus 5-FU group (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 16). 
Among chemotherapy-induced damage-associated molecular 
pattern molecules (HMGB1, S100A8 and S100A9, and IL1B) 
(23), cellular DNA damage sensors (IFNB1, MX1, and CXCL10) 
and surface stress signals (MICA, MICB, and ULBP1, -2, -3), the 
natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand MICB was found to 
be significantly upregulated in actinic keratoses after calcipotriol 
plus 5-FU treatment (P = 0.0016, paired Student’s t test; Figure 
6B and Supplemental Figure 17).
Discussion
Actinic keratoses represent an early stage of the malignant 
transformation of keratinocytes, which harbor oncogenic driver 
mutations and can progress to SCC (24). We believe our findings 
establish calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination as a novel immu-
notherapeutic agent for the treatment of actinic keratoses that 
has a great potential to prevent skin cancer development. Our 
mechanistic studies using murine models of skin carcinogene-
sis revealed that topical calcipotriol treatment blocks skin can-
cer development by inducing TSLP expression in the skin. The 
long-lasting skin cancer suppression observed in the back skin of 
the animals treated with a short course of calcipotriol in the ear 
demonstrates the role of circulating TSLP and immune memo-
ry response in mediating this antitumor effect. Consistent with 
the dominant role of CD4+ T cells in mediating TSLP-induced 
antitumor immunity (1, 2, 25), calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment 
resulted in a specific induction of CD4+ T cell immune response 
against actinic keratoses, which is distinct from the CD8+ T cell 
immunity commonly studied in the context of metastatic can-
cers. The low actinic keratoses clearance in the immunosup-
pressed participant excluded from the calcipotriol plus 5-FU 
group supports the role of an intact immune response in medi-
ating the therapeutic effect of calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment.
skin infection was detected in the study participants. None of 
the study participants reported any systemic side effects.
Calcipotriol plus 5-FU induction of CD4+ T cell immunity 
against actinic keratosis. The severe erythema caused by cal-
cipotriol plus 5-FU treatment was associated with a massive 
accumulation of lymphocytes at the sites of actinic keratosis 
and evidence of immune-mediated tumor rejection including 
lymphocyte exocytosis, epidermal spongiosis, and dyskerato-
sis (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 14). The majority of the 
lymphocytes infiltrating the lesions were CD4+ T cells, with a 
much smaller population of CD8+ T cells present (Figure 5A and 
Supplemental Figures 14 and 15). The lymphoid infiltrate large-
ly lacked B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosino-
phils (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 15). Evaluation of the 
biopsied specimens before and after treatment by a dermatopa-
thologist blinded to the treatment groups proved the histologi-
cal evidence of actinic keratosis in the specimens and revealed 
that 6 of 21 lesions in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group showed a 
severe lesional epidermis rejection pattern following treatment 
that was absent (0 of 20) in the Vaseline plus 5-FU group (P = 
0.03; Figure 5B and Supplemental Table 4). The inflammation 
in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU–treated actinic keratoses was nota-
ble for specifically targeting the sites of actinic damage, with-
out involving the histologically normal adjacent epidermis. The 
mild-to-moderate inflammation found in a subgroup of actinic 
keratoses in the Vaseline plus 5-FU group was indistinguishable 
from the baseline immune infiltrate present in the untreated 
actinic keratoses (P = 0.4; Supplemental Table 4D).
TSLP, HLA class II, and cellular stress signal synergism in medi-
ating the immunotherapeutic effects of calcipotriol plus 5-FU against 
actinic keratosis. Calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP 
expression in actinic keratosis keratinocytes (Figure 6A and 
Supplemental Figure 15) (11). Evaluation of TSLP protein lev-
els across biopsy specimens in a blinded manner revealed that 
lesional keratinocytes in the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group had 
significantly higher TSLP expression levels than did those in 
the Vaseline plus 5-FU group (P <0.0001, Supplemental Table 
5). A large number of HLA-DP–DQ–DR+ antigen-presenting

The quick appearance of inflammation and its delayed peak in 
the calcipotriol plus 5-FU group suggest that both the activation of 
tissue-resident T cells (26) and the recruitment of naive circuiting 
T cells contributed to the observed antitumor immune response.

calcipotriol plus 5-FU–treated participants suggests an extension 
of T cell immunity against highly mutated but normal-appearing 
skin on chronically sun-damaged skin (27). The immune response 
induced by calcipotriol plus 5-FU against actinic keratoses resem-
bled skin allograft rejection (28), accompanied by HLA class 
II and MICB expression on the malignant keratinocytes. HLA 
class II expression by lesional keratinocytes signifies their role as 
antigen-presenting cells in the context of the adaptive immune 
response induced by calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment (29) and 
provides evidence that CD4+ T cells infiltrating the actinic kera-
toses can directly target these malignant keratinocytes. Notably, 
NKG2D ligand induction on keratinocytes by calcipotriol plus 
5-FU treatment has been shown to synergize with TSLP to sup-
press skin cancer development (3, 30). This synergism can explain 
the high efficacy of a 4-day calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment 
against actinic keratoses compared with 5-FU treatment alone.
The short treatment duration and minimal side-effect profile 
highlight the advantages of calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination as 
an optimal treatment for patients with actinic keratosis compared 
with the currently approved treatments. Twice-daily application 
of 5% 5-FU cream for 4 weeks was found to reduce the number 
of actinic keratoses on the face and ears by 73% compared with 
24% in the vehicle-treated group (31). The mean baseline num-
ber of actinic keratoses in this study was 11.1 in the 5-FU–treated 
group versus 10.7 in the vehicle-treated group (31). Imiquimod 
is a TLR7 agonist used for actinic keratosis treatment (32, 33). 
Unlike the direct effect of calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment on 
adaptive immunity, the innate immune activation by imiquimod 
lacks tumor specificity. Imiquimod (3.75%) treatment once daily 
for two 3-week treatment cycles led to an 80% median reduction 
in actinic keratosis counts on the face and scalp compared with 
23.6% in the placebo group (32). Median baseline lesion counts in 
this trial were 9–10 (32). Diclofenac is another topical treatment 
for actinic keratosis. Treatment with 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyal-
uronan gel twice daily for 60 days led to a 54% to 64% reduction 
in actinic keratosis counts on the face, scalp, and dorsal hands 
compared with 23% to 34% in the placebo group 30 days after 
treatment (34). Mean baseline actinic keratosis numbers were 7 
and 7.4 for the diclofenac and placebo groups, respectively (34). 
The most recently approved topical treatment for actinic kerato-
sis is ingenol mebutate. Application of ingenol once daily to only 
25-cm2 contiguous areas on the face or scalp (0.015% for 3 days) 
and to the trunk or extremities (0.05% for 2 days) led to an 83% 
and 75% median reduction, respectively, in the number of actinic 
keratoses by day 57 after treatment (35). Baseline actinic kerato-
ses counts in this study were less than 9 on the treated sites (35). 
Given the exceptionally high baseline numbers of actinic kera-
toses in our trial (median baseline counts in the calcipotriol plus 
5-FU group: 16 [face], 22.5 [scalp], 13 [RUE], and 12 [LUE]; Table 
1), together with the inclusion of hypertrophic actinic keratoses, 
calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment for 4 days appears to be more 
effective than the currently approved topical field treatments for 
actinic keratoses. Nonetheless, future head-to-head clinical trials 
are required to fully address the efficacy of calcipotriol plus 5-FU 
combination compared with current treatment regimens. To 
address this and in order to make calcipotriol plus 5-FU combi-
nation accessible to a large number of patients with actinic kera-
tosis, the development of this combination of agents into a single 
topical product is essential.
The ultimate objective in treating actinic keratosis is to pre-
vent the development of skin cancer. Although the approved 
cytotoxic therapies for actinic keratosis have shown long-term 
benefit in reducing actinic keratosis counts (31), their impact on 
preventing new SCC development remains uncertain. Impor-
tantly, as an inducer of T cell–mediated immunity against actin-
ic keratosis, calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination may have a 
unique potential to establish an antitumor immune memory in 
the skin, which is maintained by skin-resident T cells (26) and is 
capable of preventing skin cancer development in the long term. 
In fact, the effective skin cancer suppression in mice long after 
a brief course of calcipotriol treatment in their ears strongly 
suggests that TSLP induction can establish a lasting antitumor 
immune memory response in the skin. A limitation of the cur-
rent study is its focus on actinic keratosis clearance and lack of 
data on skin cancer prevention in the study population. This lim-
itation will be addressed in follow-up studies. In addition, the 
current study focused on the clearance of lesions on each ana-
tomical site; however, reductions in the size and severity of large 
and hypertrophic actinic keratoses are important therapeutic 
parameters that will also be examined in follow-up studies. The 
expression of TSLP, HLA class II, and NKG2D ligand by lesional 
keratinocytes and the massive infiltration of CD4+ T cells into 
the precancerous skin lesions provide a mechanistic insight into 
the therapeutic effect of calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination. 
Understanding the precise characteristics of the tumor-infil-
trating CD4+ T cells, the nature of the tumor antigens, and the 
effector mechanism that results in such a high tumor clearance 
rate remain active areas of our research. In summary, we believe

Clinical study design. In this randomized, double-blind study, 
participants with actinic keratoses on the face, scalp, RUE, and/
or LUE were randomly assigned to a regimen of twice-daily self- 
application of topical calcipotriol plus 5-FU (test group) or Vaseline 
(petroleum jelly, vehicle; Fougera) plus 5-FU (control group) treat-
ment for 4 days. Actinic keratoses were clinically defined as pink, 
scaly papules on sun-damaged skin. A 4-day treatment duration 
was chosen, because 5-FU monotherapy has minimal impact on 
actinic keratosis clearance after 4 days (21). The drug combinations 
were prepared by mixing 0.005% calcipotriol ointment (Taro Phar-
maceuticals) with 5% 5-FU cream (Taro Pharmaceuticals) or Vase-
line with 5% 5-FU cream at a 1:1 weight ratio in accordance with 
United States Pharmacopeial Convention 795 (USP 795) guidelines 
for compounding topical medications and under the supervision of 
the investigational drug pharmacies of Washington University and 
Massachusetts General Hospital.
that the combined results from our mechanistic studies in ani-
mal models of skin carcinogenesis and our randomized, dou-
ble-blind clinical trial in patients with multiple actinic keratoses 
establish calcipotriol plus 5-FU combination as a highly effec-
tive immunotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of actinic 
keratosis, with potential implications for the treatment of can-
cers of the skin and perhaps other organs.
Methods
Animal studies. For skin cancer induction, the back skin of the animals 
was treated with a single dose of DMBA (50 μg DMBA; Sigma- 
Aldrich), 
followed by a twice-weekly application of TPA (6 μg; Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 15 weeks. Animals were randomized into treatment and control 
groups, and the investigators monitoring skin tumor development 
were blinded to the treatment groups. Refer to the Supplemental 
Material for a further description of the experimental procedures.

The trial was conducted at Washington University Medical 
Center between October 2013 and March 2015. Inclusion criteria 
included age of at least 50 years and presence of 4 to 15 clinically 
visible and discrete actinic keratoses in a 25-cm2 contiguous area on 
any of the 4 anatomical sites. Exclusion criteria included immuno-
suppression and a recent (within 1 month) use of medications that 
could hinder assessment of the treated skin (Supplemental Figure 
3A). If a participant had 2 or more qualified anatomical sites, 1 was 
selected as the primary anatomical site solely for the purpose of ran-
domization. At the initial visit (day 0), the number and anatomical 
location of actinic keratoses were documented and photographed, 
and the patient was assigned to a study medication on the basis of the 
randomization schedule corresponding to the participant’s primary 
anatomical site of treatment. Participants applied the study medica-
tion to the entirety of their qualified anatomical sites twice daily for 
4 consecutive days, starting the day after their first visit. Participants 
underwent evaluation on day 5 and at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (Supplemen-
tal Figure 3B). Optional skin biopsies were obtained before (day 0) 
and after treatment (day 5). Biopsies were performed on a randomly 
selected lesion among the actinic keratoses of each participant. The 
dermatologist assessing the actinic keratoses and performing the 
biopsies was blinded to the treatment groups.
Clinical study assessment. The primary endpoint for the study was 
the percentage of change from baseline of the total number of actin-
ic keratoses by week 8 at each anatomical site (face, scalp, RUE, and 
LUE). The secondary endpoints were the complete and partial (>75%) 
clearance of actinic keratoses by 8 weeks and the evaluation of the 
differences in response to the treatment among the 4 anatomical sites 
by week 8 after treatment. The clinical assessment of the primary and 
secondary endpoints was performed by a single dermatologist in order 
to avoid any interobserver variation in assessments. Adverse event 
reporting included participants’ self-reported side effects of erythe-
ma, scaling, burning, and pruritus during the 4-day treatment period, 
which were documented on a standard diary form. In addition, skin 
reactions were assessed, photographed, and scored clinically on day 
5 using an erythema scale (Supplemental Table 2). Participants were 
also surveyed after treatment for other skin or systemic reactions 
including infection, pain, scarring, pigmentary changes, fever, head-
ache, and eye symptoms on day 5 and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Refer to the 
Supplemental Material for a detailed description of the tissue analysis.
Statistics. All clinical study analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 
(SAS Institute) for 2-sample Student’s t tests, Pearson’s χ2 tests, Fish-
er’s exact test on proportions in contingency tables, McNemar’s test 
for marginal proportions on paired categorical data, and Spearman’s 
correlation. For the percentage of relative reduction, we used a mixed 
random-effects model on location, drug, and location by drug interac-
tion as fixed effects, and subject within drug and location by subject 
interaction as random effects. All error bars represent the mean ± SD. 
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Randomization was performed according to 4 primary anatomi-
cal sites: face, scalp, RUE, and LUE in order to capture an adequate
