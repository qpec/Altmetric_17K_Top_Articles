BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and its impact on graduate
medical training are not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of gender and preg-
nancy for Internal Medicine (IM) residents on evaluations
by peers and faculty.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS: All IM residents in training from July 1,
2004–June 30, 2014, were included. Female residents
who experienced pregnancy and male residents whose
partners experienced pregnancy during training were
identified using an existing administrative database.
MAIN MEASURES: Mean evaluation scores by faculty
and peers were compared relative to pregnancy (before,
during, and after), accounting for the gender of both the
evaluator and resident in addition to other available de-
mographic covariates. Potential associations were
assessed using mixed linear models.
KEY RESULTS: Of 566 residents, 117 (20.7%) experi-
enced pregnancy during IM residency training. Pregnancy
was more common in partners of male residents (24.7%)
than female residents (13.2%) (p = 0.002). In the post-
partum period, female residents had lower peer evalua-
tion scores on average than their male counterparts (p =
0.0099).
CONCLUSIONS: A large number of residents experience
pregnancy during residency. Mean peer evaluation scores
were lower after pregnancy for female residents. Further
study is needed to fully understand the mechanisms be-
hind these findings, develop ways to optimize training
throughout pregnancy, and explore any unconscious
biases that may exist.

INTRODUCTION
Increasing numbers of women experience pregnancy during
medical training.1 In recent studies, female trainees with a
pregnancy during residency ranged from 9–14%.2,3 Mean-
while, data on the rate of pregnancy in partners of male
residents are limited with one study reporting 27%.3 Under-
standing the impact of pregnancy on graduate medical educa-
tion is important to inform policy and curricular changes to
support the needs and goals of trainees.
Cross-sectional observation-based studies have solicited
opinions on how pregnancy impacts pregnant residents and
their colleagues. Pregnant residents have self-reported
experiencing criticism or conflict with staff as a result of their
pregnancy.4–7 Furthermore, male colleagues have reported a
negative impact on working relationships with pregnant resi-
dents.8 In contrast, other studies have demonstrated percep-
tions of supportive colleagues.9,10 Some colleagues reported
that their workload was increased as a result of working with a
pregnant resident.11 Ultimately, in a single study of female
pediatricians who had completed residency, over one third
would not choose to be pregnant during residency if they
Bhad it to do over again.^12 However, few objective data exist
regarding the impact of pregnancy on trainees and colleagues
during residency. Moreover, we are unaware of existing data
regarding the impact of pregnancy on faculty and peer evalu-
ations of trainee clinical performance.
The objective of this study is to assess the performance
evaluations by attending staff physicians and peer resident
colleagues of residents experiencing pregnancy during Inter-
nal Medicine residency. Specifically, we sought to answer: (1)
whether gender and pregnancy are associated with mean eval-
uation scores during IM residency, and (2) do these potential
associations differ by the role of the evaluator (peer vs.
faculty)?
METHODS
Subjects and Independent Variables
The Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Residency in Rochester,
Minnesota, offers 48 categorical positions each year. This is a
large tertiary academic center. The evaluation timeframe for
this study included 10 academic years, from July 1, 2004,
through June 30, 2014, which overlapped at least 1 year of
training for 12 resident classes (2005–2016). We identified
pregnancies for female trainees as well as male trainees with a
pregnant partner by reviewing resident electronic absence
requests, which were required for all residents requesting
absences. Delivery dates also were determined by the elec-
tronic absence request. Evaluations for residents who experi-
enced pregnancy were categorized as occurring prior to, dur-
ing, or after pregnancy. Age, international medical graduate

 status (IMG), post-graduate year (PGY)-1 In-Training Exam-
ination (ITE) score, and the PGYof training during evaluation
completion were assessed as potential covariates based on
previous work.13 All variables were available on each resident
from existing administrative databases as part of the usual
educational processes of the residency. The Mayo Clinic In-
stitutional Review Board approved this study.
Outcome Variable
The Integrated Scheduling and Evaluation System (ISES) was
the single electronic system for completion of evaluations of
internal medicine residents as part of their regular educational
activities at Mayo Clinic during the study period. It has been
demonstrated to have a high level of reliability14. These eval-
uations are designed to evaluate residents based on the com-
petencies delineated by the Accreditation Council for Gradu-
ate Medical Education (ACGME) and included 7–12 ques-
tions scored on a 5-point Likert scale (higher scores indicate a
better evaluation score). During residency, residents undergo
multi-source evaluations by all attending physicians and
resident colleagues who they work with. Evaluations are com-
pleted anonymously. The evaluations were de-identified and
tracked using numerical codes assigned by support staff and
unknown to the study investigators. Likert scaled responses to
questions on each evaluation were aggregated to create a
continuous valued numeric average score for each completed
evaluation, which served as the observational unit for all
subsequent analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Potential differences in mean evaluation scores (ignoring preg-
nancy) for the four resident-evaluator gender pairings were
assessed for both peer and faculty using t tests for each
pairwise least squares mean. Likewise, the potential effect of
PGY was assessed. Multivariable analyses using mixed linear
models were used to assess the effect of evaluation timing with
respect to pregnancy on mean evaluation scores, adjusting for
available demographics, including resident-evaluator gender
pairings. Repeated assessments were accounted for by includ-
ing random effects for both evaluators and residents using a

NC).
RESULTS
Cohort Demographics
During the 10-year study period, a total of 566 residents
[369 (65.2%) male, 197 (34.8%) female] trained in the
Internal Medicine residency program. The average age at
matriculation was 27.7 years, the average percent correct
on the IM ITE as PGY-1 s was 63.2%, and 75 (13.3%)
residents were IMGs. A total of 117 (20.7%) experienced
pregnancies during this time, 26 (13.2%) by female resi-
dents and 91 (24.7%) by male resident partners (p = 0.002).
There were no differences in mean (SD) age [27.8 (3.3) vs.
27.5 (3.1) years], number (%) of IMGs [49 (13.3%) vs. 26
(13.2%)], or mean (SD) difference in PGY-1 In-Training-
Examination (ITE) percent correct [63.6 (7.2) vs. 62.4
(6.9)] between male and female residents, respectively
(all p ≥ 0.05). Male residents whose partner had a pregnan-
cy (N = 91) tended to be older than male residents whose
partner did not (N = 278) [28.8 (2.7) vs. 27.4 (3.5) years;
p = 0.0001]. No other significant differences in demo-
graphics were found between any combination of gender
and pregnancy experience.
Peer Evaluation: Overall
There were a total of 25,487 peer evaluations of residents during
the study timeframe, with an overall mean (SD) of 4.11 (0.61).
Male residents received a higher mean (SE) evaluation score
from male peer evaluators than they did from female peer
evaluators [4.130 (0.019) vs. 4.071 (0.022), p = 0.009], with a
Cohen’s d effect size of 0.1. There was no difference in ratings of
female residents by peer evaluator gender (p = 0.51).
Faculty Evaluation: Overall
There were a total of 48,148 faculty evaluations of residents
during the study timeframe, with an overall mean (SD) of 3.97
(0.56). Female and male residents had similar mean ratings by
faculty evaluators regardless of faculty evaluator gender (all
p ≥ 0.04). Over the timeframe of residency training, faculty
evaluation scores increased from the PGY-1 to PGY-3 year for
all gender pairings of evaluator and resident.
Peer Evaluations and Residents Experiencing
Pregnancy
Of the peer evaluations, 21,988 (86%) were ‘Pre,’ 1238 (5%)
were ‘During,’ and 2261 (9%) were ‘Post’ pregnancy. The
number (%) of evaluations of female residents by timing relative
to pregnancy was 8433 (38%), 304 (25%), and 461 (20%),
respectively. A mixed linear model for mean evaluation scores
by peers was fit to the data, adjusting for potential differences by
age, IMG status, ITE percent correct (p < 0.0001), PGY (p =
0.0004 for PGY-1, p = 0.002 for PGY-3, vs. PGY-2, respective-
ly), evaluated resident gender, peer evaluator gender (p = 0.006),
resident-peer gender pairing (p < 0.0001), pregnancy status, eval-
uated resident gender and peer evaluator gender by pregnancy
status interactions, and resident-peer gender pairing by pregnancy
status interaction (Table 1). Adjusted least squares mean peer
evaluation scores were estimated for the four resident-peer gender
pairings by pregnancy status (Fig. 1). For evaluations completed
in the absence of pregnancy, there was a significant resident-peer
gender pairing interaction effect (p < 0.0001), which was not
found to be present during (p = 0.56) or after (p = 0.03) pregnan-
cy. The estimated mean (SE) peer evaluation scores before
pregnancy were 4.07 (0.02) for male of female, 4.09 (0.02) for
female of male, 4.11 (0.03) for female of female, and 4.13 (0.02)
for male of male. A significant effect attributed to evaluated
resident gender was seen for evaluations completed after preg-
nancy (p = 0.0099), which was not seen either during (p = 0.27)
or before (p = 0.84) pregnancy. The estimated mean (SE) evalu-
ation scores after pregnancy were 4.04 (0.04) for female residents
and 4.16 (0.03) for male residents. The estimated effect size using
Cohen’s f2 for multiple linear regression was 0.003.
Faculty Evaluations and Residents
Experiencing Pregnancy
Of the faculty evaluations, 41,626 (86%) were ‘Pre,’ 2309
(5%) were ‘During,’ and 4213 (9%) were ‘Post’ pregnancy.

 The number (%) of evaluations of female residents by timing
relative to pregnancy was 15,882 (38%), 580 (25%), and 818
(19%), respectively. A mixed linear model for mean evalua-
tion scores by faculty was fit to the data, adjusting for potential
differences by age (p = 0.004), IMG status, ITE percent correct
(p < 0.0001), PGY (p < 0.0001 for both PGY-1 and -3, vs.
PGY-2), evaluated resident gender, faculty evaluator gender,
resident-faculty gender pairing (p = 0.001), pregnancy status,
evaluated resident gender and faculty evaluator gender by
pregnancy status interactions, and resident-faculty gender
pairing by pregnancy status interaction (Table 2). Adjusted
least squares mean faculty evaluation scores were estimated
for the four resident-faculty gender pairings by pregnancy
status (Fig. 2). For evaluations completed in the absence of
pregnancy, there was a significant resident-faculty gender
pairing interaction effect (p = 0.003), which was not found to
be present during (p = 0.41) or after (p = 0.97) pregnancy. The
estimated mean (SE) faculty evaluation scores before preg-
nancy were 4.01 (0.02) for male of female, 4.04 (0.02) for
female of female, 4.06 (0.02) for female of male, and 4.06
(0.02) for male of male. No other significant effects were
observed related to gender or pregnancy. The estimated effect
size using Cohen’s f2 for multiple linear regression was 0.03.
DISCUSSION
This study sought to evaluate how internal medicine resident
evaluations are affected by pregnancy. Female residents who
experience pregnancy during residency received lower peer
evaluation scores following pregnancy as compared to males.
This work supplements previous survey-based studies eval-
uating the impact of pregnancy on physician interactions.4,5,8–
11 This study extends our understanding of the impact of
pregnancy on residency by utilizing real-time resident peer
and faculty evaluation score data that are routinely collected as
part of the resident evaluation process during training, while
accounting for potential factors including resident age, base-
line medical knowledge, IMG status, and PGY level. Com-
paring evaluations of pregnant female residents versus male
residents with pregnant partners provides unique insight into
potential gender-based disparate perceptions among

 colleagues undergoing a significant life event, and these un-
conscious biases can be addressed at the curricular level.
Previous survey-based studies have highlighted a percep-
tion of hostility toward female trainees during their pregnancy
from faculty.5,7,9 There also have been consistent findings of
discordance of perceptions when comparing pregnant female
trainees, peer colleagues, and program directors.7,8,11,15 One
study interestingly found that the majority felt that pregnancy
had a Bpositive or humanizing effect on the work environ-
ment.^16 We observed no difference in faculty evaluations of
female residents after pregnancy compared to male residents
whose partner had given birth but did see a reduction from
peer evaluators. It is unclear if this difference is reflective of
the variable study design, contrasting survey data versus real-
time evaluations, or the more recent time of this study.
This study also evaluated the interaction of the gender of the
evaluator and resident, which identified differences between
peers in contrast to faculty. There have been contrasting data in
the literature regarding the impact of gender on evaluations in
graduate medical education.17,18 Ongoing research is needed
to further understand the impact of gender on evaluations.
Fortunately, there is a suggestion of progress addressing the
stigmatization of pregnancy felt by female physicians.4 How-
ever, the perception of pregnancy during residency remains
complicated as evidenced in a recent article by its inclusion in
a list of Bsocial problems^ alongside drug and alcohol abuse
that impacts plastic surgery program directors.19 Different
types of assessment are needed to fully understand the impact
of pregnancy and parenthood and supplement prior data about
the impact of parenthood and its association with ITE scores.20
The next step after understanding the impact of pregnancy
for residents and programs is to utilize this to inform curricu-
lum and policy change and explore the influence of any
unconscious bias. Qualitative data regarding concerns of bal-
ance between career and parenting in female residents have led
to unique curriculum changes at a training program
concerning rotational location, which has been demonstrated
to be effective in changing the perception of pregnancy by
residents.21 A reduction in work hours in one program was
associated with fewer negative attitudes toward pregnancy
during training.22
Changes in parental policy are a visible product of studying
the impact of pregnancy on graduate medical education. Dat-
ing back to 1986, only 20% of residencies affiliated with one
university had a maternal leave policy.7 This is in contrast to
the most recent Association of Program Directors in Internal
Medicine (APDIM) annual survey in 2014 with 79% of pro-
gram directors reporting a written maternity policy and 59%
having a written paternity policy.24 Further, time for maternity
leave has increased over time in one study of female matric-
ulants of a single medical school.1 In the APDIM 2014 survey,
the mean (SD) maternity leave was 6.1 (4.0) weeks while
paternity leave was 5.6 (7.8) days.23 In comparison, in the
US from 2006–2008, 70.6% of employed women reported a
maternity leave with average length of 10.3 weeks.24 Recently,
our program has made a change to its policy to increase the
allowable parental leave for both male and female trainees.
In terms of limitations, other uncontrolled variables, such as
medical complications for the mother or baby, history of prior
children, and partner support, which could have a significant
impact on a resident, were not captured. However, the focus of
this article was to identify trends that could encourage future
research into effective support programs for trainees in grad-
uate medical education who would like to have a child. Also,
some changes in terms of absolute values were low in scenar-
ios that were found to be statistically significant.
This study demonstrates the need for further research on the
impact of pregnancy on colleague interactions and further
development of effective programs to support residents re-
garding childcare. Further evaluation is needed to understand
programmatic interventions for both female and male resi-
dents to feel supported in any decision regarding family
planning.
