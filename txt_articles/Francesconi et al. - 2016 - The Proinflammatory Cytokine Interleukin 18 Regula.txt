The proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 has central anorexigenic effects and was proposed to contribute to loss of appetite observed during
sickness. Here we tested in the mouse the hypothesis that IL-18 can decrease food intake by acting on neurons of the bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis (BST), a component of extended amygdala recently shown to influence feeding via its projections to the lateral hypothal-
amus (LH). We found that both subunits of the heterodimeric IL-18 receptor are highly expressed in the BST and that local injection of
recombinant IL-18 (50 ng/ml) significantly reduced c-fos activation and food intake for at least 6 h. Electrophysiological experiments
performed in BST brain slices demonstrated that IL-18 strongly reduces the excitatory input on BST neurons through a presynaptic
mechanism. The effects of IL-18 are cell-specific and were observed in Type III but not in Type I/II neurons. Interestingly, IL-18-sensitve
Type III neurons were recorded in the juxtacapsular BST, a region that contains BST-LH projecting neurons. Reducing the excitatory
input on Type III GABAergic neurons, IL-18 can increase the firing of glutamatergic LH neurons through a disinhibitory mechanism.
Imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory activity in the LH can induce changes in food intake. Effects of IL-18 were mediated by the
IL-18R because they were absent in neurons from animals null for IL-18R� (Il18ra�/�), which lack functional IL-18 receptors. In
conclusion, our data show that IL-18 may inhibit feeding by inhibiting the activity of BST Type III GABAergic neurons.

Introduction
Illness is typically associated with several nonspecific symptoms,
such as fever, sleepiness, anxiety, loss of appetite, and depression,
which are collectively referred to as sickness syndrome (Konsman
et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2003). Sickness syndrome is recognized
to be, at least, in part, mediated by cytokines produced during
infections or tissue damage, but the exact mechanisms by which
this occurs are not entirely understood.
Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cyto-
kine whose levels increase during or following infection. IL-18 is
produced by different cell types in the periphery; and centrally it
is present in microglia, ependymal cells, and neurons of the me-
dial habenula (Alboni et al., 2009, 2010, 2011). We and others
previously provided evidence that IL-18 may regulate energy ho-
meostasis by suppressing appetite and increasing metabolic rate
(Netea et al., 2006; Zorrilla et al., 2007; Zorrilla and Conti, 2014;
Hale et al., 2015). Mice null for IL-18 are hyperphagic, show
reduced energy expenditure, and eventually become obese and
develop insulin resistance. Consistently, intracerebroventricular
administration of IL-18 had anorexigenic effects. We also identi-

Significance Statement
Loss of appetite during sickness is a common and often debilitating phenomenon. Although proinflammatory cytokines are
recognized as mediators of these anorexigenic effects, their mechanism and sites of action remain poorly understood. Here we
show that interleukin 18, an anorexigenic cytokine, can act on neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to reduce food
intakeviatheIL-18receptor.Thefindingsidentifyasiteandamodeofactionthatindicatetargetsforthetreatmentofcachexiaor

 fied two subunits of the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R� and IL-18R�) in
the mouse brain (Alboni et al., 2009, 2011). One region with
IL-18R� and IL-18R� expression was the anterodorsal division
of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (adBST).
The adBST is an important multinucleated component of the
extended amygdala circuitry that can be anatomically and func-
tionally subdivided into two dorsal subregions: the anterolateral
BST (alBST) and the anteromedial BST. The alBST contains the
oval (ovBST) and the juxtacapsular nucleus (jcBST) and is inter-
connected with regions that subserve stress and reward, includ-
ing the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus (LH), ventral tegmental
area, and NAc (Choi and Lovinger, 1997; Aston-Jones and
Druhan, 1999; Georges and Aston-Jones, 2001; Georges and
Aston-Jones, 2002; Funk et al., 2006; Sahuque et al., 2006;
Shepard et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008; Jalabert et al., 2009; Davis et
al., 2010; Gafford et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013; Sink et al., 2013;
Micioni Di Bonaventura et al., 2014; Gafford and Ressler, 2015).
The vast majority (70%–90%) of adBST neurons are composed
of medium-sized spiny GABAergic neurons (McDonald, 1983;
Sun and Cassell, 1993; Hazra et al., 2011). In addition, the only
neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT2)
were observed in the posterior divisions of the BST (interfascic-
ular and ventral nuclei). None was found in the anterolateral,
magnocellular, and rhomboid nucleus or in the oval, juxtacapsu-
lar nucleus (Poulin et al., 2009). Perhaps accordingly, the adBST
is emerging as an important regulator of feeding behavior. Cor-
ticotropin releasing factor receptors in the adBST are involved in
feeding behavior during stress (Ciccocioppo et al., 2003; Ohata
and Shibasaki, 2011; Micioni Di Bonaventura et al., 2014). Ele-
gant work from Jennings et al. (2013) suggests that this action is
mediated, in part, by the modulation of inhibitory projections
that the adBST sends to the LH. Specifically, optogenetic activa-
tion of GABAergic neurons in the BST stimulated marked eating
in well-fed animals.
The adBST contains at least three different functional types of
neurons that can be distinguished by the presence and amount of
specific voltage-gated ionic conductances (Hammack et al., 2007;
Szu
¨cs et al., 2010). Of these, Type I and Type II neurons are
sparsely distributed in the alBST and in the ovBST, whereas the
Type III neurons are highly concentrated along the internal cap-
sule, in the jcBST (Rodríguez-Sierra et al., 2013). These neuronal
types appear to be differentially involved in stress-induced plas-
ticity of synaptic and intrinsic neural properties. For instance,
LTP of EPSCs induced in Type I, II, and III adBST neurons was
selectively increased only in Type III neurons after repeated re-
straint stress (Dabrowska et al., 2011). The three types of BST
neurons are also differentially influenced by prolonged alcohol
withdrawal, during which the hyperpolarization-activated cation
(Ih) current of Type II neurons in the jcBST was significantly
reduced, whereas the Ih current in Type I was unaltered (Szu
¨cs et
al., 2012).
Here we tested the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms by
which IL-18 may regulate feeding centrally is via its action on the
BST and characterized by its effects on Type I, II, and III neurons
therein.
Materials and Methods
Animals and treatments. All experiments were done on 3- to 5-month-old
male Il18ra �/ � or wild-type littermate mice on a C57BL6 background.
Animals were housed in polycarbonate cages (28 � 17 � 12 cm) with ad
libitum access to food and water throughout the study and maintained on
a light-dark cycle of 12/12 h with lights on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M., in
an ambient temperature of 21 � 3°C with relative humidity controlled.
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Scripps Research Institute and were done in accor-
dance with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals, the EC guidelines (EEC Council Directive, 2010/63/
UE), and Italian legislation on animal experimentation (Decreto Legis-
lativo 26/2014). Mice receiving injections of recombinant IL-18 or
vehicle were implanted with cannulas as previously described (Sa
´nchez-
Alavez et al., 2007, 2010). Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia (induction
3%–5%, maintenance 1%–1.5%), two holes were drilled bilaterally in the
skull through which cannulas were inserted bilaterally into the BST with
the following stereotactic coordinates (final infusion coordinates anteri-
or–posterior from bregma 0.14 mm, lateral �0.9 mm, ventral �4.3 mm,
cannula 26 gauge, 7 mm length) and fixed to an anchor screw with dental
cement. In addition, mice were implanted with telemetry devices (TA-
F10; Data Sciences) in the peritoneal cavity for core body temperature
and locomotor activity measurement.
For studies investigating the anorexigenic effects of IL-18, mice were
food-deprived overnight for 17 h before receiving bilateral microinjec-
tions (volume, 0.2 �l) of IL-18 (0.34 nmol/mouse) or vehicle (aCSF; 126
mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2,1 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26
mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) into the BST through the
implanted cannulas. Infusate was injected over 2 min (rate 0.1 �l/min),
allowing 2 min for diffusion via a Hamilton microsyringe (5 �l) linked by
PE 10 tubing to a 33-gauge injector. At 5 min after microinjection into
the BST, mice were refed (at Zeitberger time 128 4, ZT4). Remaining
food was measured 1, 3, 6, 7, and 24 h after injection. The dose was
chosen based on our earlier ventricle work (Zorrilla et al., 2007). Place-
ment of cannulas was confirmed postmortem under light microscopy
following 2% Evans Blue infusion (0.2 �l). Recombinant endotoxin-free
mouse IL-18 was obtained commercially (BioSource International; MBL
International) and dissolved in aCSF. Food intake and indirect calorim-
etry were performed in acclimated, singly housed, standard diet-fed mice
(Harlan Teklad LM-485 Diet 7012; 58% carbohydrate, 17% fat, metab-
olizable energy 3.1 kcal/g) using a computer-controlled open-circuit sys-
tem (Oxymax System) that is part of an integrated Comprehensive
Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (Columbus Instruments). Ani-
mals were tested in clear respiratory chambers equipped with a food tray
connected to a balance that measures food weight. Room air is passed
through chambers at a flow rate of �0.5 l/min. Exhaust air from each
chamber is sampled at 30 min intervals for 1 min. Sample air is sequen-
tially passed through O2 and CO2 sensors (Columbus Instruments) for
determination of O2 and CO2 content, from which measures of oxygen
consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) are esti-
mated. Gas sensors are calibrated before the onset of experiments with
primary gas standards containing known concentrations of O2, CO2, and
N2 (Airgas Puritan Medical). Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is calcu-
lated as the ratio of VCO2 to VO2. Energy expenditure measures (VO2,
VCO2, and heat formation [{3.815 � 1.232 � RER} � VO2 {in liters}])
are corrected for estimated effective metabolic mass per Kleiber power
function. Mice undergoing indirect calorimetry were acclimated to the
respiratory chambers for 3–4 d before the onset of the study.
In situ hybridization. Analysis of IL-18R� and IL-18R� mRNAs distri-
bution in the BST was performed by nonisotopic ISH using a specific
digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense riboprobe and a sense probe as neg-
ative control. cDNA [nt 1574–1960 (accession no. NM_008365)] for
mouse IL-18R� and [nt 759–1137 (NCBI GenBank accession number:
NM_010553)] mouse IL-18R� were subcloned into pDrive Cloning Vec-
tor (QIAGEN) to obtain a template for the in vitro transcription of
cRNAs [antisense (using BamH I restriction site); sense (using HindIII
restriction site)] as previously described (Alboni et al., 2009, 2011).
Probes (antisense [AS] and sense [S]) to be used in ISH assay were syn-
thesized using the DIG-RNA labeling kit (La Roche Diagnostics) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions (SP6 polymerase for AS probe; T7
polymerase for S probe). For ISH, mice were anesthetized by isoflurane
inhalation and perfused transcardially with heparinized (5.000 IU/L)
saline followed by perfusion with ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4. After
fixation, brains were rapidly removed and postfixed overnight in the
same fixative solution, and then cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution
in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were cut coronally in 40 �m serial

 sections by a cryostat, collected in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-PBS
1� and washed 2 times (5 min each) in fresh DEPC-PBS 1�. Free float-
ing sections were then treated 2 times (5 min each) with DEPC-treated
PBS containing 100 mM glycine and then with DEPC-treated PBS con-
taining 0.3% Triton X-100 (15 min). After washing 2 times (5 min each),
sections were permeabilized at 37°C (10 min) with TE buffer (100 mM
Tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8) containing 1 �g/ml RNase-free Protei-
nase K. Sections were postfixed (5 min) at 4°C with DEPC-treated PBS
containing 4% PFA, washed 2 times (5 min each) with DEPC-treated
PBS, and acetylated 2 times (5 min each) with 0.1 M triethanolamine
buffer, pH 8, containing 0.25% [v/v] acetic anhydride. Sections were then
prehybridized at least 30 min at 37°C in prehybridization buffer (4� SSC
containing 50% [v/v] deionized formamide; 1� SSC: 150 mM, 9 NaCl, 15
mM sodium citrate, pH 7.2) and incubated overnight at 58°C for Type I
IL-18R� or 52°C for IL-18R� mRNA in hybridization buffer containing
40% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1� Denhardt’s solution
[0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2 mg/ml RNase free BSA],
4� SSC, 10 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml yeast t-RNA, 1 mg/ml denaturated and
sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 30 ng/slice of DIG-labeled RNA sense
or antisense probe. After hybridization, the sections were washed 2 times
(15 min each) at 50°C in 2� SSC containing 50% [v/v] deionized forma-
mide (only for Type I IL-18R�), 2 times (15 min each) at 50°C in 2� SSC,
2 times (15 min each) at 50°C in 1� SSC, 1 times (15 min) at 50°C in
0.25� SSC, 1 time (15 min) at 37°C in 0.25� SSC, and 2 times (30 min
each) at 37°C in 0.1� SSC. After 2 washes of 10 min each in Buffer 1 (100
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), sections were preincubated in
blocking solution (Buffer 1 containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% nor-
mal goat serum). For detection of DIG, sections were incubated over-
night at 4°C in 1% normal goat serum-blocking solution containing
anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase (Fab fragment) diluted 1:400 (La Roche
Diagnostics). Subsequently, sections were washed 2 times (10 min each)
in Buffer 1 followed by a washing in Buffer 2 (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5,
100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2). The chromogenic reaction was performed
for 1–3 h at room temperature in the dark using a solution (100 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl) containing nitroblue tetrazolium and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and 1 mM levamisole. The color
reaction was stopped by incubating sections in Buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) for several hours. Images were acquired
through a digital AxioCam HRc color camera mounted on an AxioScope
40 (Zeiss) using the AxionVision program.
c-fos immunostaining. Immunostaining was performed on brain sec-
tions prepared as described for in situ hybridization from brains of ani-
mals food-deprived overnight for 17 h before receiving bilateral
microinjection of IL-18 or vehicle as described for feeding experiments.
Tissue was collected 3 h after IL-18 administration. Free-floating sections
containing the regions of interest were washed several times in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (PB) and then permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 in
0.1 M PB for 1 h. Sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum, 1%
BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB for 1 h at room temperature. Sec-
tions were incubated with c-fos rabbit polyclonal IgG (sc-52; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) at 1:2000 in diluent of blocking buffer at 4°C overnight
gently shaking. After multiple washes in 0.5% BSA in 0.1 M PB, fluores-
cent labeling was performed through incubation with Goat anti-Rabbit
IgG (H�L) Secondary Antibody (AlexaFluor-594 conjugate, A-11012;
Invitrogen) diluted 1:250 in 0.5% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB.
After 2 h incubation at room temperature, sections were washed and
counterstained with DAPI (D1306, Thermo Fisher); sections were
mounted on Southern Biotechnology Fluoromount-G Slide Mounting
Medium, coverslipped, and kept at 4°C. Images were taken on a Zeiss
LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope and analyzed with the Zen
Blue 2015 (Zeiss) software.
Electrophysiology. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed
from 50 physiologically identified Type III and Type I/II neurons located
in the adBST. We usually recorded 2 neurons from each mouse brain.
Briefly, BST slices (350 �M) were collected in oxygenated sucrose-base
aCSF (in mM) as follows: 206 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 26
NaHCO3, 1.20 NaH2PO4, 5 D-glucose, and 5 HEPES. Slices were then
preincubated for at least 1 h in aCSF containing (in mM) as follows: 124
NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4� 7H2O, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25
KH2PO4, 10 D-glucose, pH 7.4, at 30°C (osmolarity 290–300 mOsm).
For electrophysiological recording, slices were transferred to a
submerged recording chamber, perfused at the rate of 2 ml/min with
oxygenated aCSF at 30 � 1°C. AMPA-mediated responses were pharma-
cologically isolated by adding to the aCSF APV (50 �M) and (�)-
bicuculline (60 �M) to block NMDA and GABAA receptors, respectively.
The GABAB receptors were blocked by adding SCH 50911 (20 �M) to the
aCSF. The patch electrode-filling solution consisted of 120 mM
K-gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2 mM Mg-ATP,
0.3 mM Na-GTP, pH 7.3 (osmolarity 300–305 mOsm). To block the rise
of postsynaptic Ca 2� levels in Type III neurons, in some experiments,
Ca 2� was buffered with 20 mM of the BAPTA in the intracellular solu-
tion, whereas the K-gluconate concentration was reduced to 100 mM.
IL-18 was added to the aCSF at a final concentration of 10, 50, and 100
ng/ml for 15 min and then washout for 15 min. Type III neurons were
characterized by the following: (1) A fast reduction in the voltage re-
sponse (inward rectification) evoked by hyperpolarizing current injec-
tion (350 ms in duration) of increasing amplitude (Szu
¨cs et al., 2010). (2)
The presence of a slow depolarization, ramp-like, of the membrane po-
tential in response to depolarizing current pulses. This behavior is due to
the slowly inactivating potassium current (ID) (Storm, 1988). (3) De-
layed action potential when depolarizing current pulses were applied.
Neurons with those electrophysiological characteristics were recorded in
the jcBST adjacent to the internal capsula (see also Rodríguez-Sierra et
al., 2013). Type I neurons are characterized by the presence of voltage sag
during hyperpolarization suggestive of the expression of Ih. Type II neurons
show a voltage sag stronger than in Type I neurons and generate postinhibi-
toryspikesattheendofhyperpolarizingcurrentsteps.TheAMPA-mediated
postsynapticcurrents(AMPA-EPSCs)wererecorded,frompreviouslyphys-
iologically identified jcBST neurons, in voltage-clamp mode at the holding
voltage of �70 mV.
To evoke synaptic currents, paired stimuli (50 ms interpulse interval)
were delivered at 0.05 Hz through a bipolar stimulating electrode placed
in the stria terminalis. Constant-current pulses of 0.08 ms duration were
used, and the intensity was set to evoke an EPSC of �70 pA in amplitude
for every cell studied. The evoked AMPA (eAMPA)-EPSCs recorded 10
min before IL-18 application were used to calculate baseline values for
peak EPSC amplitude. The paired pulse ratio (PPR) was then calculated
as the peak amplitude of the second eAMPA-EPSC (eAMPA-EPSC2)
divided by the first, eAMPA-EPSC1 (PPR � eAMPA-EPSC2/eAMPA-
EPSC1). Alterations in the PPR are thought to represent changes in re-
lease probability in the presynaptic terminal (Manabe et al., 1993). As an
alternative parameter, to determine the synaptic mode of IL-18 action,
we measured the coefficient of variation (CV) of the eAMPA-EPSCs as
the ratio of the SD (�) to the mean (�) of the peak eAMPA-EPSC ampli-
tude. A change of CV is associated with either a change of release prob-
ability (Pr) or the number of release sites (n) (Choi and Lovinger, 1997).
Input–output (I/O) curves were calculated to estimate the synaptic effi-
cacy of AMPAR responses. After electrophysiological characterization of
evoked synaptic responses, neurons were clamped at �70 mV, and the
spontaneous miniature AMPA (mAMPA)-EPSCs were recorded in slices
perfused with TTX (0.5 �M) to block action potentials. The threshold to
detect the mAMPA-EPSCs was established at 6 pA of amplitude. To
generate the cumulative probability curve, we recorded 2000–3000
events. The cumulative probability curve for interevent intervals and
mini-amplitude before and after IL-18 were generated by recording from
the same cell.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean � SEM. Statistical dif-
ferences were determined on raw data by repeated-measures ANOVA
and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at a significance level of 0.05. c-fos
data were analyzed by t test.
Results
Expression of IL-18R� and � in the anterior BST
The detailed distribution of IL-18R� and IL-18R� mRNAs in the
anterior BST was determined via ISH in the brain of C57BL/6J
mice (n � 5). Representative images are shown in Figure 1. IL-
18R� Type I was expressed in the anterolateral BST, with the

 densest staining seen in the oval and juxtacapsular nucleus. Hy-
bridization signal was also observed for IL-18R� in the antero-
medial BST (Fig. 1A,B,E). The expression of IL-18R� mRNA did
not appear to differ strongly between lateral versus medial divi-
sions (Fig. 1C,F). In all cases, the specificity of the hybridization
signals was confirmed by comparing sections hybridized with
antisense probes with those hybridized with respective sense
probes; no hybridization signal was detectable in sections hybrid-
ized in parallel with sense probes (Fig. 1B,C,E,F). Divisions of
the BST were identified by comparison with the Franklin
and Paxinos Mouse Brain Atlas in stereotaxic coordinates
(Franklin and Paxinos, 1997). The anatomic nomenclature used
in this study was based on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas
(http://mouse.brain-map.org).
Administration of recombinant IL-18 in the adBST reduced
food intake and c-fos activation
The effects of IL-18 on food intake and c-fos activation were
measured following bilateral injection of recombinant mo-
use IL-18 (rmIL-18) or aCSF (used as vehicle) into the adBST of
mice refed after 17 h of food deprivation (n � 6 animals per
group). rmIL-18 (30 ng/0.2 �l) markedly reduced food intake
and c-fos activation (Fig. 2); 75% of cannulations were on target,
and off-target cannulation did not have any significant effect on
food intake compared with target vehicle (data not shown).
Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that IL-18 microinjec-
tion reduced food intake starting at 3 h (Zeitberger time 7 h) after
injection (treatment � time: F(1,22) � 63.84, p � 0.0001; Fig. 2A).
Cumulative food intake indicated a reduction at 3 h (55.6 �
14.7%, normalized to controls) and 6 h (52.8 � 14.7%, normal-
ized to controls) after rmIL-18 injection. Significant hypophagia
was also observed when food intake was normalized for body
weight (treatment � time: F(1,39) � 9.92, p � 0.01; Fig. 2B).
Administration of rmIL-18 in the adBST did not affect core
body temperature, locomotor activity, the respiratory exch-
ange ratio (RER � VCO2/VO2), or heat production (see Fig. 3).
These data indicate that injecting rmIL-18 in the adBST did not
alter the index of carbohydrates versus lipid usage and did not
cause fever, ruling out the possibility that the effects of rmIL-18
on feeding were due to the possible presence of endotoxin
contaminant.
c-fos immunostaining was used to determine the effects of
rmIL-18 on adBST activation. rmIL-18 reduced the activation of
c-fos in the BST. The number of neurons per slice per area � SEM
for vehicle versus IL-18 (rounded up to no decimals) was as fol-
lows: 51 � 6 versus 12 � 1 in the anterior BST (N � 4 animals per

IL-18 affects intrinsic membrane properties of Type III but
not of Type I/II alBST neurons via IL-18R
In Il18ra�/� mice, the intrinsic membrane properties of Type
III jcBST neurons, such as resting membrane potential, input
resistance, rheobase, input–output (I/O) function, and volt-
age threshold, were determined, in current-clamp recordings,
by analyzing the voltage-evoked responses to intracellular in-
jections of a series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current
pulses. Current pulses of 350 ms starting from �200 pA were
increased in steps of 5 pA until firing was elicited. In every type
of cell recorded, these parameters were measured before and
during a 15 min bath application of rmIL-18 and then again
during washout to verify the possible effects of rmIL-18 on
postsynaptic membrane conductances. rmIL-18 was used at
50 ng/ml, a concentration determined in pilot dose–response
experiments that were performed with 10, 50, or 100 ng/ml
(n � 4 cells per concentration). No effects were observed at 10
ng/ml, and no difference in the response was observed be-
tween 50 and 100 ng/ml (data not shown).
As shown in Table 1, in Type III jcBST neurons, rmIL-18
significantly depolarized the resting membrane potential from
�73.66 � 2.0 mV to �53.41 � 3.55 mV after 15 min bath appli-
cation (F(1,18) � 29.87, p � 0.000398). This strong depolarizing
effect of rmIL-18 was not associated with appearance of sponta-
neous firing. The depolarization was associated with a significant
increase in input resistance from 415.25 � 22.73 M� to 686.5 �
34.8 M� (F(1,14) � 54.71, p � 0.00015), measured in response to
�200 pA hyperpolarizing current pulse. The increase in the input
resistance of Type III neurons treated with rmIL-18 was associ-
ated with a reduction of the inward rectification and of the
rheobase current from 96.67 � 6.55 pA before application to
39.62 � 4.84 pA 15 min after rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) application
(F(1,6) � 52.85, p � 0.0001). However, this change in the rheobase
was not associated with a significant change in the voltage thresh-
old of Type III neurons (�34.86 � 0.65 mV before and �34.58 �
0.76 mV after application of rmIL-18; F(1,20) � 0.11, p � 0.747).
The slope of the I/O function (no. of spikes/nA), which is a mea-
sure of neuronal excitability, was not significantly altered after 15
min of rmIL-18 application (81.17 � 6.7 before and 55.49 � 7.37,
at 15 min rmIL-18 application; F(1,16) � 6.6506 p � 0.2239).
IL-18 can induce these membrane effects reducing the IKIR, which
strongly controls the resting membrane potential, input resis-
tance in the hyperpolarized region, and the rheobase of the Type
III BST neurons, together with other ionic currents.
To determine the involvement of IL-18 receptors in IL-18-
induced changes in Type III neuron intrinsic membrane proper-
ties, similar electrophysiological studies were conducted in brain
slices prepared from Il18ra �/ � mice, which lack functional IL-18
receptors. rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) did not induce significant changes
in the intrinsic membrane properties of Type III jcBST neurons
from Il18ra �/ � mice (Table 1). The results demonstrate that the
changes induced in Type III jcBST neurons in Il18ra�/� mice by
IL-18 on the resting membrane potential, the input resistance,

 and the rheobase are mediated by the functional IL-18R complex.
In light of evidence that stress can differentially modulate the
properties of Type I, II, and III neurons in the jcBST, we sought to
determine whether the effects of IL-18 on Type III neuron intrin-
sic properties were also evident in Type I and Type II neurons. As
shown in Table 1, bath application of rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) did not
change the intrinsic membrane properties of Type I and II neu-
rons, contrary to what was seen in Type III neurons. The results
support the hypothesis that Type III and Type I/II BST neurons
may differentially subserve jcBST functions and implicate Type
III neurons in the control of food intake.
IL-18 decreases the amplitude of evoked AMPA-EPSCs at
glutamatergic inputs to Type III jcBST neurons by
modulating presynaptic glutamate release
We next investigated the effects of rmIl-18 (50 ng/ml) on gluta-
matergic synaptic transmission to Type III BST neurons (Fig. 4).
Type III jcBST neurons receive excitatory input from many cor-
tical and limbic areas, including the dysgranular insular cortex,
the prelimbic and infralimbic divisions of the mPFC, the
amygdalo-hippocampal transition area, the posterior BLA, the
transitional postpyriform cortex, and the amygdalopiriform
transition area (McDonald et al., 1999; Dong et al., 2001; Larriva-
Sahd, 2004). Pharmacologically isolated AMPA-EPSCs (see Ma-
terials and Methods) were evoked in Type III BST neurons by
electrical stimulation of the stria terminalis (Francesconi et al.,
2009) (Fig. 4A–B). eAMPA-EPSCs were recorded every 20 s for
10 min in aCSF, during 15 min of rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) bath ap-
plication, and during 15 min of washout. rmIL-18 gradually re-
duced the peak amplitude of the eAMPA-EPSCs from 70.27 �
0.19 pA to 28.7 � 0.28 pA (40.6 � 0.26% of baseline value) at
10–15 min of application (F(2,42) � 3065.7, p � 0.0001; Fig. 4C–
E). A partial recovery of the peak amplitude of eAMPA-EPSCs to
34.5 � 0.52 pA was observed during the 15 min of washout (Fig.
4D). A comparable reduction of eAMPA-EPSC peak amplitude
was observed at 100 ng/ml rmIL-18 (n � 4), whereas no effects
were seen at 10 ng/ml (n � 4) (data not shown). In control
experiments, we recorded eAMPA-EPSCs for a period of 30 min
in regular aCSF to assess possible rundown of the eAMPA-EPSCs
with time. The peak amplitude of eAMPA-EPSCs remained sta-
ble during the recording period.
Synaptic site of action
The IL-18-induced reduction of eAMPA-EPSC amplitude could
be due to either presynaptic or postsynaptic mechanisms, or
both. To clarify the synaptic mode of IL-18 action, we first per-
formed a series of experiments using a paired-pulse paradigm in
which two pulses are applied with a 50 ms interstimulus interval.
A typical response to paired pulse stimulation is shown in Figure
4C. We measured both the PPR and the CV of the eAMPA-EPSCs
before and during rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) bath application (for PPR
and CV measures, see Materials and Methods). PPR changes are
considered to indicate a change in the probability of synaptic
vesicle release, as occurs with alterations in presynaptic calcium
influx (Manabe et al., 1993). The CV is a sensitive parameter of
presynaptic function because it varies per variables, such as num-
ber of release (n) and probability of release (p) (Manabe et al.,
1993). The reduction of the eAMPA-EPSC peak amplitude in-
duced by rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) corresponded temporally with an
increase in the PPR (Fig. 4D,E). Statistical analysis showed a
significant increase of both PPR from 0.97 � 0.009 to 1.86 � 0.09
(190 � 9.38%; F(2,42) � 62.62, p � 0.001) and CV from 0.10 �
0.006 to 0.32 � 0.037 (318 � 46.2%; F(2,15) � 21.41, p �
0.000243) at 10–15 min of application of rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml)
(Fig. 4D,E). The joint increase of PPR and CV suggests a decrease
in presynaptic glutamate release probability following IL-18 ap-
plication. To further test the hypothesis that IL-18 alters presyn-
aptic activity, we also recorded action potential independent
spontaneous mAMPA-EPSCs from Type III neurons clamped at
�70 mV in BST slices perfused with TTX (see Materials and
Methods) to inhibit action potential evoked release. As shown in
Figure 3.

 Figure 5A, C, application of rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) caused a signif-
icant decrease in the frequency of mAMPA-EPSCs from 5.63 �
0.42 Hz to 2.86 � 0.18 Hz (F(2,18) � 40.09, p � 0.0001, 12 min
after IL-18), with no significant associated change in the ampli-
tude (15.27 � 1.53 pA to 12.07 � 1.46 pA; F(2,15) � 1.73, p �
0.2263, 15 min after rmIL-18). Moreover, rmIL-18 induced a
rightward shift in the cumulative frequency distribution of spon-
taneous release events (p � 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic)
without a significant change in cumulative amplitude distribu-
tion (Fig. 5E). These results support an effect of IL-18 on the
presynaptic activity of glutamatergic terminals on Type III jcBST
neurons. However, because rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) significantly de-
polarized postsynaptic Type III neurons, a retrograde signal can
be released as consequence of intracellular Ca 2� increase. To

 exclude this possibility, we conducted experiments in 6 Type III
neurons where the intracellular recording solution was supple-
mented with 20 mM BAPTA. Under this condition, rmIL-18 (50
ng/ml) still reduced the frequency of mAMPA-EPSCs from
5.69 � 0.45 Hz to 2.89 � 0.18 Hz, 15 min after rmIL-18 (F(2,15) �
41.08 p � 0.0001), leaving the mean amplitude unchanged
(13.73 � 0.57 pA to 12.98 � 0.82 pA 15 min after rmIL-18; F(2,15)
� 0.6 p � 0.567). These results strongly indicate a direct presyn-
aptic effect of IL-18. The modulation of mAMPA-EPSCs by IL-18
was tested also in Il18ra �/ � mice. rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) did not
change either the frequency (from 4.01 � 0.75 to 3.89 � 0.87;
F(2,15) � 0.19 p � 0.829) or the amplitude (from 14.15 � 2.69 to
13.72 � 2.48; F(2,15) � 0.27 p � 0.768) of spontaneous synaptic
events (Fig. 5B,D,F). Thus, IL-18 modulated the excitatory syn-
aptic input onto Type III BST neurons through the IL-18R
complex.
Type III cell specificity of IL-18 actions
To investigate whether the effects of IL-18 on Type III neurons of
jcBST were cell specific, we performed patch-clamp recording
from electrophysiologically identified Type I and Type II neu-
rons. Interestingly, Type I and Type II neurons received a signif-
icantly lower frequency of mAMPA-EPSCs. In Type I neurons,
the frequency of mAMPA-EPSCs was 1.61 � 0.42 Hz with mean
amplitude of 11.44 � 1.39 pA. The mAMPA-EPSCs frequency in
Type II neurons was �1 Hz, and too low to acquire sufficient
events for a formal statistical analysis. Therefore, we analyzed the
effects of IL-18 on only Type I neurons. Bath application of
rmIL-18 (50 ng/ml) did not significantly change the frequency or
amplitude of mAMPA-EPSCs in Type I alBST neurons. The
mean frequency of mAMPA-EPSCs in Type I neurons was 1.61 �
0.42 Hz before and 1.88 � 0.45 Hz, 15 min after rmIL-18 (F(1,8) �
3.24 p � 0.146), whereas the mean amplitude of mAMPA-EPSCs
was 11.44 � 1.39 pA before and 11.7 � 1.19 pA, 15 min after
rmIL-18 (F(1,8) � 0.63 p � 0.471). Thus, IL-18 selectively modi-
fied presynaptic release at glutamatergic terminals that made syn-
aptic contact on Type III jcBST neurons.
Discussion
The present work identified the adBST as a site of the anorexi-
genic action of IL-18 and showed that this is mediated by the
modulation of the excitatory synaptic input of Type III neurons
in the jcBST. IL-18 altered presynaptic glutamate release via its
functional IL-18 receptor. A schematic representation of these
findings is presented in Figure 6.
IL-18 and food intake
Behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular studies have re-
cently implicated a central role for IL-18 to control food intake.
Mice lacking IL-18 or a functional IL-18 receptor eat more and
gain more weight than their wild-type littermates. Conversely,
intracerebroventricular administration of recombinant IL-18 re-
duced food intake (Netea et al., 2006; Zorrilla et al., 2007; Zorrilla
and Conti, 2014; Hale et al., 2015). Recently, it was also shown
that activation of neurons in the adBST promoted feeding by
inhibiting glutamatergic LH neurons that regulate nutrient ho-
meostasis (Jennings et al., 2013). Specifically, the effects seem to
involve GABAergic neurons located in the jcBST that project to
aCSF                                                                                                            aCSF

 the LH (Dong et al., 2000). A combined
Golgi and electron microscopic study of
the jcBST revealed two basic cell types: in-
terneurons and projection neurons; 80%
of such neurons were described as bipolar
projection
neurons,
suggesting
that
GABAergic neurons may function as both
intrinsic interneurons and projection
neurons (Larriva-Sahd, 2004). The jcBST
neurons receive excitatory inputs from
many cortical and limbic areas, including
the dysgranular insular cortex, a cortical
area involved in gustatory perception
(Small, 2010), in the processing of visual
food-cues (Frank, 1952), tasted or smelled
food stimuli (de Araujo et al., 2003), and
also in food craving (Pelchat et al., 2004).
We found that both heterodimeric sub-
units of a functional IL-18R (IL-18R� and
IL-18�) are expressed in the jcBST, and
we hypothesized that IL-18 may influence
feeding by modulating neuronal function
in this region.
Local injection of rmIL-18 in the
mouse adBST reduced food intake com-
pared with vehicle for at least 6 h and re-
duced

activation
observed
at
refeeding upon food deprivation. These
actions were observed at a dose of 0.3
nmol/mouse, or one-third of the minimal dose previously re-
quired to observe anorexigenic effects when rmIL-18 was injected
intracerebroventricularly (Zorrilla et al., 2007). Also, consistent
with what was observed after intracerebroventricular injections,
administration of rmIL-18 in the adBST did not elicit other signs
of sickness, including fever.
IL-18 and neuronal functions
To begin to understand how IL-18 altered neuronal function in
the adBST, we measured the electrophysiological effects of IL-18
in adBST neurons. The adBST is a heterogeneous structure con-
sisting of neurons with different electrophysiological, neuro-
chemical, and anatomical connections (Daniel and Rainnie,
2016). Different functional types of GABAergic neurons (i.e.,
Type I, II, and III) can be identified by the presence and the
amount of specific voltage-gated ionic conductances (Szu
¨cs et al.,
2010, 2012; see also Rodríguez-Sierra et al., 2013). Type I and
Type II neurons are sparsely distributed in the ovBST and the
broader alBST (Daniel and Rainnie, 2016). In contrast, Type III
neurons are densely packed in the jcBST. Many of these neurons
express corticotropin-releasing factor (Dabrowska et al., 2011;
Hazra et al., 2011) and project to the lateral hypothalamus, but
not to the ventral tegmental area (Rodríguez-Sierra et al., 2013;
Silberman et al., 2013).
In Type III jcBST neurons, IL-18 reduced the inward recti-
fication mediated by the IKIR, which has been demonstrated to
participate in establishing the resting membrane potential
(Hammack et al., 2007). Thus, the reduction of IKIR, together
with other ionic currents, could contribute to the membrane
depolarization induced by IL-18. Although the membrane de-
polarization moves the resting membrane potential closer to
the voltage threshold, no spontaneous firing was generated.
Moreover, the neuronal excitability was not altered as the
slope of the I/O function was unchanged.
The rmIL-18 rapidly induced a strong reduction of the peak
amplitude of eAMPA-EPSCs and a decrease in the frequency of
mAMPA-EPSCs. These effects required IL-18R� because they
were not found in Type III neurons from Il18ra �/ � mice.
Instead, IL-18 reduced the strength of excitatory synaptic
transmission onto Type III jcBST neurons, as indicated by in-
creases in the PPR and CV, via the activation of IL-18 receptors.
Changes in PPR are generally observed following procedures that
alter the probability of transmitter release (Zucker, 1989); they
are less frequently associated with postsynaptic alterations (Clark
et al., 1994). Together, increases in PPR and the CV, and de-
creases in the frequency of spontaneous, action potential-
independent AMPA-EPSCs without alteration in their mean
amplitude, provide complementary evidence for the involvement
of presynaptic mechanisms in the effects of IL-18 on Type III
neurons (Malinow and Tsien, 1990; Bolshakov and Siegelbaum,
1994; Bekkers and Delaney, 2001). Previous studies demon-
strated different effects of IL-18 and other interleukins in modu-
lating synaptic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in other
synaptic pathways (Tancredi et al., 2000; Curran et al., 2003;
Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006; O’Connor, 2015). At glutamater-
gic synapses between CA3-derived Schaffer collateral fibers and
CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, IL-18 enhanced the
evoked AMPA-mediated postsynaptic response by increasing
presynaptic glutamate release (Kanno et al., 2004). This effect
may increase the excitatory influence of CA1 pyramidal cells on
their target neurons. In the jcBST, IL-18-mediated reduction of
excitatory synaptic inputs to GABAergic Type III jcBST neurons
may indirectly disinhibit their target LH neurons. IL-18 did not
induce changes in the frequency of mAMPA-EPSCs recorded
from Type I neurons. Because Type I neurons are located more
medially with respect to Type III jcBST and receive significantly
less mAMPA-EPSCs, we can only speculate that Type I neurons
receive excitatory input from a distinct set of glutamatergic pro-

 jections that do not have IL-18R on their terminals. The molec-
ular mechanisms of IL-18 action at the presynaptic level still need
to be investigated.
In our study, we demonstrated that IL-18 induces a long-
lasting depolarization of Type III neurons to ��50 mV, most
likely by blocking KIR channels. Interestingly, KIR channels
(Kir2.3 and Kir3.3) are also expressed on presynaptic terminals
(Trimmer, 2015), and it has been shown that KIR channels lo-
cated in the vicinity of the presynaptic active zone can participate
in the regulation of neurotransmitter release (Aguado et al.,
2008). Recently, it has been demonstrated that KIR conductance
present on the presynaptic terminals of corticostriatal afferents
regulates glutamate release at these synapses (Meneses et al.,
2015). We suggest that long-lasting membrane depolarization of
presynaptic glutamatergic terminals induced by IL-18 can reduce
the amplitude of the eAMPA-EPSCs through the voltage-
dependent inactivation of presynaptic calcium channels involved
in the evoked glutamate release
In conclusion, collectively, our data show that IL-18 acts on
the adBST to reduce food intake, and this behavioral effect may
result from reduced excitatory drive of Type III GABAergic neu-
rons in the jcBST. This model is consistent with recent findings
that activation of GABAergic BST neurons projecting to glutama-
tergic LH neurons dramatically increases food intake (Jennings et
al., 2013) and provides new insights into how a proinflammatory
cytokine may contribute to a key component of “sickness syn-
drome” (loss of appetite) via receptor-specific modulation of
central neuronal circuitry that modulates feeding. Whereas the
IL-18 receptors IL-18R� and IL-18R� are constitutively ex-
pressed in the BST and in other brain regions, cytokine levels in
the normal healthy brain are typically low. However, IL-18 syn-
thesis is strongly elevated in activated microglia as well as in
ependymal cells and neurons of the medial habenula during
stress (Culhane et al., 1998; Conti et al., 1999; Prinz and Hanisch,
1999; Sugama et al., 2002; Alboni et al., 2010). Thus, IL-18 and
the BST may be important regulators of appetite during infec-
tion, illness, and certain types of stress/anxiety disorders and rep-
resent novel targets for cachexia and, perhaps, eating disorders
and obesity.
