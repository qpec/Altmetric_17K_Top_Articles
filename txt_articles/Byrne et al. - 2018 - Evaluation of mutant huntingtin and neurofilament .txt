Overline: Huntington’s Disease 
 
One Sentence Summary: Mutant huntingtin and neurofilament in biofluids may have 
prognostic potential in Huntington’s disease. 
Abstract:  Huntington’s disease (HD) is a genetic progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
caused by a mutation in the HTT gene, for which there is currently no cure. The identification of 
sensitive indicators of disease progression and therapeutic outcome could help the development 
 of effective strategies for treating HD. Here, we assessed mutant huntingtin (mHTT) and 
neurofilament light (NfL) protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood in 
parallel with clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in premanifest and 
manifest HD mutation carriers. Among HD mutation carriers, NfL concentrations in plasma and 
CSF correlated with all non-biofluid measures more closely than did CSF mHTT concentration. 
Longitudinal analysis over 4-8 weeks showed that CSF mHTT, CSF NfL and plasma NfL 
concentrations were highly stable within individuals. In our cohort, concentration of CSF mHTT 
accurately distinguished between controls and HD mutation carriers, while NfL concentration, in 
both CSF and plasma, was able to segregate premanifest from manifest HD. In silico modeling 
indicated that mHTT and NfL concentration in biofluids might be among the earliest detectable 
alterations in HD and sample size prediction suggested that low participant numbers would be 
needed to incorporate these measures into clinical trials.  These findings provide evidence that 
biofluid concentrations of mHTT and NfL have potential for early and sensitive detection of 
alterations in HD and could be integrated into both clinical trials and the clinic. 
 
 Introduction 
Huntington’s disease is a progressive, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by motor, psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction, caused by CAG expansions in the 
HTT gene, encoding the causative agent, mutant huntingtin (mHTT) (1). With multiple targeted 
‘huntingtin-lowering’ therapies in clinical development (2, 3), there is a pressing need for 
sensitive biomarkers of progression and target engagement. If a disease-modifying treatment is 
developed, there will be an immediate need for tools to aid stratification of premanifest mutation 
carriers for preventative trials and to guide clinical treatment decisions. However, current clinical 
assessments and rating scales will be limited for these purposes as they are designed to clinically 
characterize individuals who have already manifested motor abnormalities (4–8). Through 
longitudinal observational studies, robust clinical, cognitive and structural neuroimaging 
biomarkers of HD progression have emerged (9–11). Establishing useful biochemical markers 
has proven more challenging (12).  
Quantification of mHTT within the central nervous system (CNS) was reported by Wild 
and colleagues in 2015, using a novel single-molecule counting immunoassay (13). mHTT 
concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was associated with clinical severity, 
independently of known predictors such as age and HTT CAG repeat length. CSF mHTT 
concentration was used to demonstrate successful huntingtin lowering in the first phase 1/2 
clinical trial of a huntingtin-lowering therapy, the intrathecally-administered antisense 
oligonucleotide HTTRx/RG6042 (NCT02519036) (3, 14). A technical validation of this assay was 
recently published (15), but the behaviour of CSF mHTT in terms of clinical sensitivity, 
specificity and intra-individual stability over time – important characteristics for designing 
 adequately-powered biomarker-supported clinical trials – has not been assessed in a clinical 
cohort. 
Neurofilament light protein (NfL) is the smallest subunit of neurofilaments and a 
component of the neuronal cytoskeleton (16). Its release into CSF occurs as a result of neuronal 
damage (17); several studies have shown that NfL is increased in CSF  in HD patients and 
correlates with clinical severity (18–21). We recently reported, in a retrospective study, the 
potential of NfL, measured in blood using an ultrasensitive assay, as a prognostic biomarker for 
HD (22). Baseline plasma NfL predicted numerous aspects of subsequent disease course, 
including rates of brain atrophy, cognitive decline, and disease onset in premanifest HD mutation 
carriers. There was a strong correlation between plasma and CSF NfL concentration, implying 
CNS origin of NfL detected in plasma (22). Subsequently we showed NfL in plasma predicts 
regional atrophy in disease-associated brain areas (23) and that NfL in CSF and blood is a 
potential translational biomarker in at least one mouse model of HD (24). However, our 
understanding of the potential value of NfL as a biomarker is limited by the lack of a large, well-
phenotyped cohort in which to study it in both plasma and CSF. 
These two proteins – mHTT as the pathogenic agent and a pharmacodynamic marker of 
huntingtin-lowering effect, and NfL as a marker of neuronal damage – have the potential to form 
a powerful, synergistic biofluid biomarker combination.  However, they have never been 
measured in parallel in CSF and blood from a cohort of HD mutation carriers and controls, 
accompanied by detailed clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Assessment of 
multiple factors in the same individuals should enable the head-to-head evaluation of clinical 
performances necessary to design appropriate clinical trials. The event-based model (EBM) (25) 
is a data-driven and probabilistic method that computationally models a disease process as a 
 sequence of events in which individual factors become detectably abnormal, as inferred from 
their distributions in healthy and disease populations. This method  has revealed biomarker 
orderings that provide insight into pathological ordering in Alzheimer’s disease (26, 27), 
multiple sclerosis (28, 29) and recently Huntington’s disease (30). However, studies in HD 
investigating the temporal order in which biofluid markers alter during the disease course 
relative to more established clinical and MRI measures are lacking. 
The study presented here, called the HD-CSF study, was designed to generate a resource 
of CSF matched with blood plasma, along with phenotypic and neuroimaging data, to facilitate 
HD biofluid biomarker development. Procedures were designed to maximize consistency of data 
and sample acquisition and processing. 
Using baseline samples and data from the HD-CSF cohort, we assessed mHTT in CSF, 
and NfL in CSF and plasma, comparing all three head-to-head against clinical and neuroimaging 
outcome measures using partial correlations, and their relative diagnostic ability using receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In a subset of volunteers who underwent a second 
biosample collection six weeks later, we evaluated intra-individual stability of mHTT and NfL. 
We calculated sample size requirements for clinical trials using reductions in mHTT or NfL as 
outcome measures. Finally, the temporal sequence in which the measured variables become 
abnormal was assessed using event-based modelling, providing new insights into the earliest 
disease-related changes detectable in HD. 
 Results  
The HD-CSF cohort is well-matched across disease groups except for age 
The HD-CSF cohort consists of 80 participants: 20 healthy controls, 20 premanifest HD 
mutation carriers (preHD), and 40 manifest HD mutation carriers (manifest HD) ranging from 
early to moderate stage HD (Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale [UHDRS] Total 
Functional Capacity 4-13 inclusive). Demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in 
Table S1. 
The preHD group was significantly younger than the control and manifest HD groups 
(p=0.012 and p<0.0001 respectively; Table S1), a consequence of their selection as individuals 
too young to have developed HD symptoms; the control group was recruited to match the mean 
age of all HD mutation carriers (p=0.061). Therefore, age-adjustment was included in all 
analyses. There were no inter-group differences in gender. As expected, there were no 
differences between the control and preHD groups for functional, motor and cognitive scores, 
but there were differences between the preHD and manifest HD groups (Table S1). 
In all 80 participants, mHTT concentration was quantified in CSF, whereas NfL concentration 
was measured in CSF and plasma. Analyte concentrations by group are shown in Table 1. CSF 
mHTT concentration was quantifiable in all HD mutation carriers, but was below the detection 
threshold in all controls. Thus, controls were excluded from the analysis of confounding 
variables for mHTT. 
We assessed potential confounding variables for each analyte (Fig. S1). All three were 
associated with age (Fig S1A-C); there was no evidence for an effect of gender on any analyte 
(Fig. S1D-F). Only CSF mHTT concentrations were associated directly with the number of CAG 
 repeats (Fig. S1G-I); CSF hemoglobin concentration, used to evaluate any effect of blood 
contamination, was not associated with any analyte (Fig, S1J-L). Nonetheless, because CAG is 
the primary driver of HD progression, we repeated all subsequent analyses between the three 
analytes with other measured variables to include age and CAG as covariates (Table 1 and 2). 
This permits assessment of whether each analyte has independent power to predict cross-
sectional disease characteristics, beyond the known best predictors of progression.  
 
mHTT and NfL are higher in manifest HD than controls and preHD, beyond the effects of age 
and CAG 
Consistent with previous reports, the concentrations of CSF mHTT, CSF NfL and plasma 
NfL were all significantly higher in HD mutation carriers compared to controls (Table 1; CSF 
mHTT p<0.0001, CSF NfL p<0.0001, plasma NfL p<0.0001). Each analyte concentration was 
significantly higher in manifest than premanifest HD (Table 1 and Fig. 1A-C; CSF mHTT 
p=0.001, CSF NfL p<0.0001, plasma NfL p<0.0001,  after Bonferroni correction for multiple 
comparisons).  The concentration of the three analytes was also higher in premanifest HD than in 
healthy controls (Table 1 and Fig. 1A-C; CSF mHTT p=0.001, CSF NfL p<0.0001, plasma NfL 
p<0.0001, after Bonferroni correction). The manifest HD group had significantly increased 
concentrations of CSF NfL and plasma NfL compared with the preHD group after adjustment for 
age and CAG, also surviving multiplicity correction (Table 1; CSF NfL p=0.0148, plasma NfL 
p=0.0008). 
 
Plasma NfL has the strongest association with clinical severity compared to CSF NfL and mHTT 
 Among HD mutation carriers there were statistically significant associations, after age 
adjustment, between CSF mHTT, CSF NfL, and plasma NfL concentration and all pre-specified 
UHDRS clinical measures: Total functional capacity (Table 2 and Fig. 2A-C), Total motor score 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2D-F), Symbol digit modalities Test (Table 2 and Fig. 2G-I), Stroop color 
naming (Table 2), Stroop word reading (Table 2 and Fig. 2J-L), and Verbal fluency categorical 
(Table 2). Only the associations between plasma NfL and the clinical measures remained when 
the results were adjusted for the number of CAG repeats in addition to age (Table 2 ). 
 
 
 CSF NfL predicts brain volume more closely than plasma NfL or CSF mHTT 
64 participants (80%) had an MRI scan, of whom 49 were HD mutation carriers. Their 
demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics were similar to those who did not have 
MRI scans (Table S2). CSF mHTT concentration was not associated with brain volume (Table 2 
and Fig. 3A-D). CSF NfL concentration was associated with every pre-specified MRI volume 
measurement: whole-brain (Table 2 and Fig. 3E), white-matter (Table 2 and Fig. 3F), grey-
matter (Table 2 and Fig. 3G) and caudate (Table 2 and Fig. 3H), all calculated as a percentage 
of total intracranial volume and age-adjusted. These associations survived additional adjustment 
for age and number of CAG repeats (Table 2). Plasma NfL concentration was associated with 
whole-brain (Table 2 and Fig. 3I), grey-matter (Table 2 and Fig. 3K) and caudate volume 
(Table 2 and Fig. 3L); the associations with grey-matter and caudate survived adjustment for 
age and CAG (Table 2).  
 
CSF NfL and plasma NfL are more closely correlated than CSF NfL and mHTT. 
 In HD mutation carriers, concentrations of mHTT and NfL in CSF were strongly 
correlated (Fig. 4A; unadjusted r=0.682, p<0.0001; age-adjusted: r=0.697, p<0.0001). In the 
whole cohort, CSF and plasma NfL were also highly correlated (Fig. 4B; unadjusted r=0.914, 
p<0.0001; age-adjusted: r=0.885, p<0.0001). In HD mutation carriers the correlation persisted 
(Fig. 4B; unadjusted r=0.878, p<0.0001; age-adjusted: r=0.794, p<0.0001). The mean 
concentration of NfL in CSF for all participants was 33.7 times that in plasma. HD mutation 
carriers had a significantly higher CSF:plasma ratio for NfL than controls (36.5 vs 25.5, 
respectively, p=0.0010), consistent with our previous findings in a smaller cohort (9). 
 
CSF mHTT, CSF NfL and plasma NfL possess favorable attributes for clinical application 
We analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of each analyte by examining its ability to 
discriminate between HD mutation carriers and controls, and between manifest and premanifest 
HD, using ROC curves, in which the true positive rate (sensitivity) is plotted against the false 
positive rate (1-specificity) for each analyte value. The area under a ROC curve (AUC) gives a 
measure of a test’s accuracy (that is, its discriminatory ability); 0.5 indicates a 50% probability 
of the test giving the correct answer, while 1 indicates a test that gives the correct answer every 
time (31). 
For distinguishing between controls and HD mutation carriers, CSF mHTT had 
essentially perfect accuracy (Fig. 5A, AUC=1.000). CSF and plasma NfL both displayed high 
accuracy (Fig. 5A, AUC=0.933 in CSF and AUC=0.914 in plasma). The accuracy of NfL was 
not statistically significantly different between CSF and plasma (p=0.364). 
 For distinguishing between premanifest and manifest HD, mHTT displayed moderate 
accuracy (Fig. 5B, AUC=0.775). NfL, however, had high accuracy in both CSF and plasma (Fig. 
5B, AUC=0.914 in CSF and AUC=0.931 in plasma). The accuracy of NfL was not statistically 
significantly different between CSF and plasma (p=0.5800), but each was significantly superior 
to that of CSF mHTT (p=0.0039 for CSF NfL and p=0.0125 for plasma NfL). 
To assess intra-individual stability of each analyte, 15 participants (18.8%) underwent a 
second sampling visit 4-8 weeks after the first (mean interval 39.1 days), where CSF and blood 
were collected under the same conditions. This group comprised 2 controls, 3 premanifest HD 
and 10 manifest HD. Their demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics were similar to 
those who declined repeat sampling (Table S3). The intraclass correlation between the first and 
second sampling visits in this cohort was high for all analytes (Fig. 5C CSF mHTT 0.937 (95% 
CI 0.83–0.98); Fig. 5D CSF NfL 0.995 (95% CI 0.99–1.00); Fig. 5E plasma NfL 0.954 (95% CI 
0.87–0.98)). 
To inform the design of clinical trials, we performed sample size calculations using the 
repeated measure data to infer inter-subject variability in change from baseline to 6-weeks and 
assuming null mean change from baseline to 6-weeks in a placebo group. Fig. 5F shows the 
sample sizes required per arm, for theoretical trials in HD mutation carriers for a range of 
treatment effect sizes. The sample sizes are substantially smaller than those that would likely be 
required for the clinical endpoints of such trials (32).  
 
mHTT and NfL are among the earliest changes detectable in HD 
EBM analysis (30) applied to the HD-CSF cohort, incorporating all measures of interest, 
placed CSF mHTT as the earliest detectable change, followed by plasma and CSF NfL (Fig. 6A-
 B). The subsequent changes were caudate volume, total motor score, global brain volumes, 
Stroop color naming, Symbol digit modalities test, Stroop word reading and Verbal fluency 
categorical. The model generated from EBM can be assessed by its ability to stage participants 
based on their individual data for all measured variables combined; this model accurately 
characterized all control participants into stage 0, all preHD participants into “low-mid” stage 
and nearly all manifest HD patients into “mid-late” stages (Fig. 6C). We reproduced this EBM 
analysis in the Track-HD cohort (30) to include plasma NfL, which we previously quantified 
(22). Plasma NfL placed very early in the temporal sequence order – between putamen and 
caudate volumes (Fig. 6D-E). Putamen volume was not a pre-specified imaging measure in HD-
CSF because it is challenging to quantify reliably and performs poorly as a longitudinal measure 
of progression. Full staging of the adapted Track-HD EBM is presented in Fig. S2. 
 Discussion  
In this 80-participant cross-sectional study of HD mutation carriers and matched healthy 
controls – each undergoing rigorously standardized CSF and blood sample collection, phenotypic 
assessment and (in those opting for an optional MRI scan) supporting MRI acquisition  – we 
compared CSF mHTT, CSF NfL and plasma NfL concentration head-to-head, to investigate their 
relative associations with clinical measures and discriminatory ability. Having corroborated 
previous findings that these three analytes are associated with measures of disease severity (13, 
20, 22, 33), we showed that plasma NfL concentration had the strongest associations and 
independent predictive ability for all clinical measures after adjustment for age and number of 
CAG repeats. CSF NfL was most strongly associated with all brain volume measures, and these 
associations remained significant after age and number of CAG repeats adjustment. 
 All correlations with clinical and imaging measures were stronger for NfL in CSF and 
plasma than for mHTT in CSF. This perhaps reflects that NfL, as a marker of axonal damage, 
has a more direct relationship with the development of clinical manifestations and brain atrophy. 
On the other hand, mHTT may be a less direct predictor of clinical severity. The signal obtained 
by the CSF mHTT assay is influenced by more than the absolute intraneuronal concentration of 
mHTT, which likely changes in brain much less than the several-fold changes seen in assay 
signal in CSF. A higher signal readout is generated by longer polyglutamine length (15), 
reflecting the polyglutamine-dependent binding of MW1 antibody. Somatic instability of the 
CAG repeat length is increasingly recognized as a potential driver of pathology in HD (34, 35). 
Further expansion of CAG repeat length in brain tissue, in addition to varying amounts of N-
terminal HTT fragments and aggregates, may contribute to the relatively large inter-subject 
variability in CSF mHTT concentration as well as its increasing with disease progression. These 
 caveats have little implication for CSF mHTT's utility in HTT-lowering trials, which involve 
quantifying within-subject reductions of mHTT as the pathogenic agent. 
The CSF concentrations of mHTT and NfL were closely associated. In turn, NfL concentration 
was strongly correlated between CSF and plasma, consistent with findings in smaller cohorts 
examining each association separately (13, 22). This is in keeping with the likely chain of events 
that links these analytes. mHTT is produced in neurons where it causes damage and ultimately 
death (1, 36). Some mHTT may be released from damaged or dying neurons enters the CSF, 
where it can be measured. This has been shown by the increase in CSF mHTT concentration 
after experimentally inducing neuronal death in mice expressing mHTT (33). The multiple 
factors contributing to the mHTT assay signal mean that a mHTT-independent measure of 
neuronal damage might be an important means of establishing the effects of CSF mHTT 
reduction and might help to dissect which of the three factors (cellular mHTT concentration, 
somatic instability or neuronal damage) contribute to the reduction in CSF mHTT signal after a 
long-term HTT-lowering treatment. Neurofilament light appears to be a good candidate to serve 
this purpose. NfL is produced throughout neurons and principally resides in axons. Its 
concentration rises after insults such as head injury, multiple sclerosis relapses (37–40) and 
stroke (41), indicating that NfL concentration reflects the current degree of neuronal damage 
and/or death from different causes. NfL in blood and CSF has been reported to increase within 
two weeks post head trauma (37, 42). Our head-to-head findings suggest that while CSF mHTT 
and plasma NfL both reflect clinical state, CSF NfL was generally more closely associated with 
measures of brain volume in HD, and retained independent associations after adjustment for age 
and number of CAG repeats, suggesting that it reflects historical brain volume loss beyond other 
 known predictors – age and CAG repeats. This is in keeping with an indicator of neuronal injury 
progression.  
The weaker associations of plasma NfL with global brain volume measures compared to 
CSF NfL, are perhaps unsurprising given that NfL in the periphery is a less direct reflection of 
neuronal injury. This does not mean that plasma NfL offers no insights into brain atrophy, either 
historically (brain volume) or prospectively (ongoing brain atrophy).  Indeed, our previous work 
suggests that NfL is a dynamic marker of ongoing neuronal damage in HD that predicts 
subsequent progression (22, 23). The strong association between plasma NfL and caudate 
volume, even after adjustment for age and number of CAG repeats, corroborates previous 
findings (23) and further demonstrates that plasma NfL has a robust relationship with historical 
caudate atrophy. The smaller sample size here likely explains the lack of a significant association 
between plasma NfL and white matter volume, as was seen in the larger TRACK-HD cohort 
(23). 
CNS neuronal injury is widely accepted as the source of elevated NfL in blood plasma in 
neurodegenerative diseases including HD (22, 43–45). Although huntingtin-lowering 
therapeutics currently being tested are administered intrathecally, implying the ready availability 
of CSF for therapeutic monitoring, orally and intravenously administered therapeutics are under 
development (2) for which a biomarker of neuronal rescue in a readily-accessible biofluid would 
be desirable. Moreover, an accessible biomarker reflecting the current rate of neuronal injury 
could eventually be useful for guiding clinical decisions, such as when to escalate to more 
invasive CSF monitoring as a first step towards intrathecal treatment.  
Our ROC analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between CSF and 
plasma NfL in discriminating between disease groups. In its ability to distinguish between 
 controls and mutation carriers, CSF mHTT was unsurprisingly superior to both CSF and plasma 
NfL, but NfL in either CSF or plasma surpassed mHTT in discriminating between preHD and 
manifest HD mutation carriers. One important caveat here is that while plasma and CSF NfL 
appear equivalent in tracking the natural history of HD over years of progression, we do not yet 
know how quickly either might respond to the rapid amelioration of pathology as may occur with 
sustained huntingtin lowering. It is likely that any such change would first be reflected in CSF 
before eventually being apparent in plasma. Serum NfL concentration took three months to 
normalize after a boxing bout (46), which may indicate the most rapid reduction in NfL that may 
be expected if a therapy truly alleviates neuronal pathology. 
We investigated CSF in HD patients with longitudinal sampling over 4-8 weeks, 
permitting the intra-individual stability of each analyte to be assessed. The very high intraclass 
correlation values of the three markers revealed them to be highly stable, suggesting that intra-
individual variation in these analytes is likely to be a minimal source of noise in natural history 
and therapeutic studies.  
Our sample size calculations reveal that fewer than 35 participants per group would be 
sufficient to detect drug-related alterations in HD mutation carriers – whether premanifest or 
manifest – for all three markers, even at therapeutic effect sizes as low as 20%. This is 
considerably smaller than the cohort sizes likely to be enrolled in late-phase efficacy trials, 
indicating that NfL or mHTT quantification could be used to support interim or exploratory 
analyses without significant sample size cost (32, 47). An important caveat here is that by 
assuming a variability based on within-subject change over six weeks may underestimate the 
variability over the time period of a late phase efficacy trial. 
 The MRI-focused EBM analysis of Wijeratne and colleagues in the TRACK-HD cohort 
(30) outlined a fine-grained sequential pattern in brain atrophy, permitting the staging of HD 
mutation carriers based on brain MRI measures. The HD-CSF cohort permits the exploration of 
biofluid, imaging and clinical measures head-to-head. EBM in this cohort suggests that these 
biofluid analytes – mHTT in CSF and NfL in CSF and plasma – are among the earliest changes 
detectable in HD. CSF mHTT rose first, then plasma and CSF NfL which were positionally 
interchangeable with caudate volume. Next, total motor score, whole-brain and white-matter 
volume changed, followed by grey-matter volume, then finally the cognitive scores. We were 
able to further validate these findings for plasma NfL in the larger TRACK-HD cohort, showing 
that plasma NfL was altered between putamen and caudate atrophy. These findings suggest a 
potential early role for these biofluid measures in stratifying patients for preventative clinical 
trials in premanifest HD. 
Our study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, HD-CSF has 
relatively small PreHD and control groups as it was designed predominantly as a study of 
manifest HD. This limits our ability to determine the earliest detection of alterations in both NfL 
and mHTT as result of the HD gene. Second, longitudinal data over a longer time interval are 
needed to understand how these analytes vary with disease course and compare head-to-head 
their ability to predict disease progression. It would also be of interest to perform EBM or similar 
data-driven models using longitudinal data. Third, our study does not include any individuals 
with juvenile HD. It will be of interest to understand if these individuals display similar or 
different profiles for the variables measured here. Fourth, for application in clinical decision-
making, substantial further investigation of the predictive power of NfL in individual patients 
will be required. Fifth, sampling visits were conducted at around the same time after an 
 overnight fast. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that these analytes may be affected by 
diet or time of day. This is worthy of dedicated study. Finally, signals from immunoassays are 
dependent on the reagents used which may vary between batches or sources. This means results 
are most interpretable when used in a single run, within a cohort. 
In conclusion, parallel evaluation of CSF mHTT, CSF NfL and plasma NfL in the HD-CSF 
cohort revealed that plasma NfL was most strongly associated with measures of clinical severity 
and only NfL was associated with MRI brain volume. Through ROC analysis, we showed that 
NfL has greater clinical discriminatory ability than mHTT, within HD mutation carriers. All 
analytes were stable over short intervals, and the sample size numbers required for trials of drugs 
expected to alter these proteins are attainable within the numbers likely required to show clinical 
efficacy. Finally, we provide evidence through EBM that these biofluid analytes are among the 
earliest detectable changes as HD progresses. These results suggest that as our understanding 
grows further, analysis of mHTT and NfL might be useful for developing HD therapeutics and 
for clinical management. 
 Materials and Methods 
Study design 
The study aimed to investigate mHTT in CSF, NfL in CSF and NfL in plasma – and their 
relative performance as biofluid indicators for HD. Eighty participants (20 healthy controls, 20 
premanifest HD and 40 manifest HD) were recruited from the National Hospital for Neurology 
and Neurosurgery/University College London/University College London Hospitals HD 
Multidisciplinary Clinic as part of an ongoing longitudinal, single-site, CSF collection initiative, 
called HD-CSF. The sample size for the HD-CSF cohort was derived from a priori sample size 
calculations, based on a 12-subject CSF analysis of mutant huntingtin (13). Although detecting 
cross-sectional differences in mHTT concentration between control and HD mutation carriers 
requires very small numbers (<5 per group for >90% power and 2-sided 5% type-I error), 20 
subjects per group were recruited to allow >90% power for detecting predicted longitudinal 
change in mHTT over two years, imputed from the inter-group differences in mHTT and age in 
our previous cross-sectional study. Sample collections were standardized as previously reported 
(13, 48) and described in detail in the supplementary methods. MRI scans and repeat sampling 
visits were optional. Clinical and imaging measures of interest were pre-specified based on 
previously published evidence that these measures were most robustly associated with disease 
progression (11, 22, 49). Quantification of analytes and MRI processing was performed blinded 
to disease status. CSF mHTT concentration was measured in triplicate. NfL in CSF and blood 
were measured in duplicate. Healthy controls were recruited simultaneously, age-matched to HD 
mutation carriers and were clinically healthy with no evidence of incidental neurological disease.  
Data from the multisite TRACK-HD study were used in the event-based model analysis. 
This involved 290 participants out of the 366 enrolled at baseline (95 healthy controls, 103 
 PreHD and 92 Early HD), each of whom had baseline plasma NfL and quality-controlled 
imaging data.  
Structural MRI Processing 
All T1-weighted scans passed visual quality control check for the presence of significant 
motion or other artefacts prior to processing. Bias correction was performed using the N3 
procedure (50). A semi-automated segmentation procedure via MIDAS was used to generate 
volumetric regions of the whole-brain and total intracranial volume (TIV) as previously 
described (51–53). In addition, SPM12 ‘Segment’ (MATLAB version 2012b) was used to 
measure the volume of the grey and white matter (54). Finally, MALP-EM was used to quantify 
caudate volume (55). MALP-EM is an automated tool used to segment MRI scans into regional 
volumes, and has previously been validated for use in HD cohorts (56). Default settings were 
used, for both SPM12 segmentations and MALP-EM caudate regions, no scans failed processing 
after visual quality control of segmentations by experienced raters to ensure accurate delineation 
of the regions. Demographic MRI volumes were presented adjusted for TIV. All MRI analyses 
used brain volumes as percentage of TIV. 
Statistics 
Analyses were performed with Stata 14.2 (StataCorp). Significance level was defined as 
p<0.05. 
Analyte distributions were tested for normality and, if necessary, arithmetical 
transformations were evaluated to produce normality. CSF mHTT concentration had a normal 
distribution. CSF and plasma NfL concentrations were non-normally distributed; a natural 
logarithm transformation produced an acceptable normal distribution for both CSF and plasma 
 NfL, as previously shown (22); therefore, transformed values were used for all analyses. Unless 
otherwise specified, outliers were included in the analyses. 
Potentially confounding demographic variables (age, gender, blood contamination) were 
examined in preliminary analyses; those found to be significant were included as covariates for 
subsequent analyses. All analyses are reported with the adjustment for potentially confounding 
demographic variables. All analyses were repeated with adjustment for age and number of CAG 
repeats– a planned second-level analysis – to assess associations with measures beyond the 
known combined effect of age and HTT CAG repeat length. 
We used unpaired two-samples t-test/ANOVA or the Pearson’s chi-squared test to assess 
intergroup differences of baseline characteristics. Intergroup analyte comparisons were tested 
using multiple linear regressions using age, or both age and number of CAG repeats, as 
covariates and were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. Correlations were tested 
using Pearson’s correlation and partial correlations for covariate adjustment. 
To understand the diagnostic power of the studied analytes, we produced receiver 
operating characteristics (ROC) curves for each analyte and compared the areas under the curves 
(AUC) formally using the method suggested by DeLong and colleagues (57). 
We performed sample size calculations to inform the design of therapeutic trials aiming 
to lower these analytes by a range of desired therapeutic effect sizes. Log-transformed values 
were used for each analyte. The assumption for inter-subject variability was based on the 
variability in the change from baseline to 6-weeks in HD mutation carriers. No change over time 
was assumed for the hypothetical control arm of the trial. Based on these assumptions, we 
derived the sample size per arm required to detect a given control-adjusted percent reduction in 
the treatment arm with 80% power and 2-sided 5% type-I error.

imaging measures.  
(A) Positional variance diagram produced from the event-based model (EBM), applied to the 63 
HD-CSF participants who had data for all biomarkers (Controls 15; preHD 16; manifest HD 32). 
(B) Re-estimation of the positional variance in A, using 100 bootstrap samples of the data, 
providing internal validation of the model’s findings. (C) Distribution of HD-CSF participants 
staged using the HD-CSF EBM, based on their collective data for all 12 measured variables. (D) 
Positional variance diagram from the EBM using the Track-HD cohort (24), now including 
plasma NfL and (E) similar results after re-estimation with 100 bootstrap samples of the data. 
The positional variance diagrams represent the sequence of “events” (the individual measures 
going from normal to abnormal, identified by the EBM). Darker diagonal squares represent 
higher certainty of the biomarker becoming abnormal at the corresponding event where multiple 
event boxes colored indicating more uncertainty about its position. 1 indicates the earliest event. 
Proportion is with respect to each study group. PreHD, premanifest HD mutation carriers; CSF, 
cerebrospinal fluid; mHTT, mutant huntingtin; NfL, neurofilament light.
