Background: Hospitalized, malnourished older adults have a high risk of readmission and mortality.
Objective: Evaluation of a high-protein oral nutritional supplement (HP-HMB) containing beta-hydroxy-
beta-methylbutyrate on postdischarge outcomes of nonelective readmission and mortality in malnour-
ished, hospitalized older adults.
Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
Setting: Inpatient and posthospital discharge.
Patients: Older(�65years),malnourished(SubjectiveGlobalAssessment[SGA]classBorC)adultshospitalized
for congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Interventions: Standard-of-care plus HP-HMB (n ¼ 328) or a placebo supplement (n ¼ 324), 2 servings/day.
Measurements: Primary composite endpoint was 90-day postdischarge incidence of death or nonelective
readmission. Other endpoints included 30- and 60-day postdischarge incidence of death or readmission,
length of stay (LOS), SGA class, body weight, and activities of daily living (ADL).
Results: The primary composite endpoint was similar between HP-HMB (26.8%) and placebo (31.1%). No
between-group differences were observed for 90-day readmission rate, but 90-day mortality was
significantly lower with HP-HMB relative to placebo (4.8% vs. 9.7%; relative risk 0.49, 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.90; p ¼ 0.018). The number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 death was 20.3 (95% CI:
10.9, 121.4). Compared with placebo, HP-HMB resulted in improved odds of better nutritional status (SGA
class, OR, 2.04, 95% CI: 1.28, 3.25, p ¼ 0.009) at day 90, and an increase in body weight at day 30
(p ¼ 0.035). LOS and ADL were similar between treatments.
Limitations: Limited generalizability; patients represent a selected hospitalized population.
Conclusions: Although no effects were observed for the primary composite endpoint, compared with placebo
HP-HMB decreased mortality and improved indices of nutritional status during the 90-day observation period.

 1. Introduction
Hospitalized older adults (�65 years) are at high risk of
malnutrition [1], which has a negative impact on subsequent
clinical and economic outcomes, including a greater risk of
mortality and a high rate of nonelective hospital readmission
[2]. In particular, malnutrition at hospital admission is an
independent predictor of subsequent hospital readmission [3]
and
is
associated
with
higher
mortality
after
hospital
discharge [4].
Even short hospitalizations in older adults may have clinical
consequences, such as loss of lean body mass (LBM) with acceler-
ated functional decline [5]. This loss of LBM involves dysfunction of
several cellular and physiologic processes [6] and may be exacer-
bated by malnutrition [7]. Patients often continue to lose body
weight
and LBM
after hospital
discharge, further adversely
affecting outcomes [8].
Studies have shown that the use of oral nutritional supplements
(ONS) in malnourished patients in community and hospital settings
may reduce complications, mortality, and hospital readmissions
[9e11]. While the prevalence of malnutrition is high [1], in a
retrospective analysis of data over 11 years, only 1.6% of inpatient
episodes out of 44.0 million involved ONS use [10]. In older pa-
tients, the effects of ONS have been extensively studied and have
been consistently shown to increase body weight and improve
nutritional status [11]. However, effects of ONS on readmission
rates and mortality specifically in older adults have only been
evaluated in small- to medium-sized trials, often involving het-
erogeneous populations [11e13]. While systematic reviews sug-
gested that high-protein ONS (providing �20% total calories from
protein) significantly reduced readmissions [14] and mortality [11]
compared with controls, other systematic reviews and meta-
analyses failed to show consistent results [12,13]. Thus, the effi-
cacy of ONS on readmission and mortality in hospitalized, older
adults remains uncertain.
Targeted ONS strategies for maintaining or protecting nutri-
tional status in older adults have used a variety of supplements
with different components including vitamin D, higher caloric
content,
amino
acids,
protein,
and
beta-hydroxy-beta-
methylbutyrate (HMB) [14e16]. In particular, a role for supple-
mental protein has been suggested, since increased protein intake
has been associated with improvement in LBM [17]. HMB, which is
found naturally in the diet at very low levels and is an active
metabolite of leucine, has been shown to regulate muscle protein
metabolism with evidence supporting its safety and ability to
prevent LBM loss during bed rest [18] and in patients with chronic
diseases [15]. The current study evaluated a specialized, nutrient-
dense ONS, containing both a high-protein content and HMB (HP-
HMB), on postdischarge outcomes including nonelective read-
mission and mortality in initially hospitalized, malnourished,
older adults. Eligible patients were those admitted for congestive
heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia
(PNA), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), condi-
tions previously shown to result in a high risk of 30-day read-
mission [19,20].
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
The NOURISH (Nutrition effect On Unplanned ReadmIssions and
Survival in Hospitalized patients) study was a multicenter, pro-
spective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study conducted in the United States between May 2012
and October 2014 (Fig. 1A). The study evaluated the effects of HP-
HMB on the postdischarge incidence of hospital readmission,
nutritional status indices and morbid events in older hospitalized
adults. As per the initial protocol, the incidence of nonelective
readmission within 90 days postdischarge was the primary
outcome. Since death, which was a safety endpoint, and read-
mission are competing events, the composite event of death or
nonelective readmission within 90 days postdischarge was defined
as the primary efficacy endpoint. This definition was incorporated
into the finalized statistical analysis plan subsequent to the interim
analysis and prior to unblinding of the data; the sequence of
finalization was consistent with Food and Drug Administration
guidance
and
International
Conference
on
Harmonisation
guidelines.
During hospitalization, patients received the individual hospi-
tals' standard nutritional care at the discretion of the attending
physicians. Patients were instructed to consume 2 servings of their
allocated study intervention (ie, HP-HMB or placebo) each day.
During the 90-day postdischarge period, patients were instructed
to continue to supplement their regular dietary intake with 2
servings daily of their allocated intervention, which was provided
to the patients without charge. In order to maintain the blind, HP-
HMB and placebo were packaged in identical Tetra Paks® identi-
fied only by product codes that were blinded to study in-
vestigators and sites; opaque straws were provided and used for
consumption. Two flavors were available for each arm; patients
were exposed only to the flavors of the assigned study arm
product.
Patient assessments were performed at days 30, 60, and 90 or at
study discontinuation and included intake of allocated interven-
tion, morbidity, readmissions, functional and nutritional status, use
of medications/dietary supplements, quality-of-life indices, medi-
cal care utilization, and adverse events (Fig. 1A). Blood was drawn
at baseline and days 30 and 60. Additional contact via home visit or
telephone was performed weekly to encourage compliance and
collect information on morbid events, medical-care utilization and
intake of allocated intervention, which were recorded by the pa-
tient in a provided record handbook. At the time of each clinical
visit, the record was returned to the site coordinator to assess
product intake compliance.
The protocol received approval from the appropriate site Insti-
tutional Review Board. All patients provided written informed
consent.
2.2. Patients
Eligible patients were aged �65 years with a recent hospital
admission (within 72 h) with a primary diagnosis of CHF, AMI,
PNA, or COPD. Patients were required to have a Subjective Global
Assessment (SGA) class of B (moderate or suspected malnutrition)
or C (severe malnutrition); SGA is a validated tool that is
considered the gold standard for assessment of malnutrition in
hospitalized patients. All site personnel were trained on SGA and
an instruction video was provided. Exclusion criteria were dia-
betes mellitus (type 1 or 2) due to product composition not
intended for patients with diabetes mellitus; current active or
treated cancer, and impaired renal or liver function. For details,

section
(Supplementary Table 1).
Sites prescreened patients per hospital protocol, which
ranged from screening all hospital admissions daily to review-
ing computer-generated lists. If at least 1 eligibility criterion
was not met, the reason was recorded and the patient was
excluded.

 2.3. Study treatments
Patients were randomized (1:1) through a centralized allocation
system (ClinPhone, Perceptive Informatics, Deerfield, IL) to receive
either HP-HMB or placebo twice daily during hospitalization and 90
days postdischarge. After eligibility criteria were ascertained,
treatment assignments were obtained by the site using an inter-
active voice response system; no randomization envelopes were
sent to the sites. Randomization was stratified by primary diag-
nosis, gender, and nutritional status (SGA class), with computer-
generated
randomization
schedules
using
a
pseudo-random
permuted
blocks
algorithm
(block
sizes
of
2
per
strata
combination).
HP-HMB was a specialized, nutrient-dense ready-to-drink liquid
(Abbott Nutrition, Columbus, Ohio, USA) with 350 kcal, 20 g pro-
tein, 11 g fat, 44 g carbohydrate, 1.5 g calcium-HMB, 160 IU vitamin
D and other essential micronutrients. The placebo, also a ready-to-
drink liquid (Abbott Nutrition, Columbus, Ohio, USA), contained
48 kcal, 12 g carbohydrate, and 10 mg vitamin C, but no other
macro- or micronutrients. Products were packaged in individual
single-serve Paks (237 mL), with the patients instructed to take 2
servings per day in-hospital and after discharge. The nutritional

Supplementary Table 2. All ingredients were stable over the shelf-
life of the supplements.
2.4. Outcomes
The primary efficacy variable was the composite event of death
or nonelective readmission within 90 days postdischarge. Other
efficacy variables included 30- and 60-day rates of readmission
and/or death, length of stay (LOS), and activities of daily living
(ADL) assessed using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities
of Daily Living Scale [21]. This analysis also evaluated nutrition-
related efficacy endpoints, including distribution of SGA nutri-
tional status, changes in body weight at 30, 60 and 90 days
postdischarge, and serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D
at 30 and 60 days, which was evaluated using a central laboratory
(ICON, Farmingdale, NY). Other variables will be reported sepa-
rately, and a complete listing of the study outcomes is in
Supplementary Table 3.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Efficacy analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat
(ITT) population, defined a priori as all enrolled patients who
received any amount of allocated intervention. For patients who
prematurely discontinued study procedures and intervention, a
postexit follow-up was planned to ascertain death and readmission
outcomes, which were included in the ITT analysis. Missing values
were not imputed in the analyses.
The sample size was calculated based on the 90-day read-
mission outcome. Assuming a 90-day readmission rate of 29% in the
placebo group [22], and that HP-HMB would improve this rate by
10 absolute percentage points, a sample size of 228 patients per
treatment was estimated to provide 80% power using a 0.05-level
1-sided log rank test. Accounting for 30% attrition, the trial
needed to enroll 326 patients per group. As part of the sensitivity
analysis, prior to the unblinding of the trial, the composite outcome
of the competing events (90-day readmission and/or death) was
redefined as the primary outcome.
For the composite outcome and its individual components, the
Tarone-Ware
survival
(primary
analysis)
and
unstratified
CochraneManteleHaenszel tests (confirmatory analysis) were
used to compare HP-HMB with placebo. Post hoc analysis was
performed using a stratified CochraneManteleHaenszel test to
ascertain the effect of imbalance in New York Heart Association
(NYHA) classification. KaplaneMeier survival curves were plotted
for the primary and component outcomes. For time-to-event ana-
lyses, censoring was done at the time of the last patient contact for
patients who were lost to follow-up (approximately 5% of patients
in both groups). Negative binomial regression was used to analyze
LOS, and generalized estimating equations for SGA. Changes from
discharge in body weight were analyzed by analysis of covariance.
Details of the statistical software, factors, and covariates used in the
models are provided in Supplementary Table 4.
Demographics, clinical characteristics, and adverse events were
compared between interventions using the CochraneMantele
Haenszel test for categorical variables and analysis of variance for
continuous variables.
An interim analysis for the 90-day readmission was made when
approximately 50% of the patients exited the study, were read-
mitted, or died. The Lan-Demets alpha-spending function approx-
imating the O'Brien Fleming method was used for preserving the
overall significance level at a ¼ 0.05. Two-sided p values were
reported.
3. Results
3.1. Patients
A total of 652 patients were enrolled from 78 sites (328 HP-HMB
and 324 placebo), of whom 313 and 309 received their allocated
intervention, respectively, and are included in the ITT population
(Fig. 1B). Among the 121 patients in HP-HMB (38.7%) and 126 in
placebo (40.8%) who exited the study prior to the 90-day visit, the
most common reason for discontinuation was patient's request, 66
in HP-HMB and 61 in placebo. A postexit follow-up for those who
did not have a readmission before exit was conducted in 83 HP-
HMB and 79 placebo patients to ascertain death and readmission
outcomes; a total of 37 patients were completely lost to follow-up.
Overall, clinical outcomes were unavailable from 18 and 19 patients

 in HP-HMB and placebo, respectively. Demographic characteristics
were comparable between groups (Tables 1 and 2), except NYHA
classification.
3.2. Treatment adherence
No difference
between
groups
in
overall
product
intake
(Supplementary Fig. 1) was observed; during the 90-day study
period, approximately one third of patients in both groups reported
adherence �75%, and approximately 45% of patients had intake
�25%. However, median adherence at 10 and 30 days postdischarge
was relatively high, 95% and 90%, respectively in both groups. The
average in-hospital intake was comparable in the 2 groups, as was
the intake during the first 10 and 30 days or to the first event
(readmission or death) during these periods (Supplementary
Table 5).
3.3. Composite and component efficacy endpoints
There was no significant difference between groups for the
primary composite endpoint (Fig. 2A). Combined nonelective
readmission and mortality occurred in 84 HP-HMB patients
(26.8%) and 96 placebo patients (31.1%). While 79 patients in
each group had only readmissions, and mortality occurred in 15
(4.8%) and 30 (9.7%) patients in HP-HMB and placebo, respec-
tively, 10 HP-HMB and 13 placebo patients had readmissions
prior to death. No significant differences were observed between
groups for the 90-day readmission rate. However, the 90-day
mortality rate was significantly lower with HP-HMB relative to
placebo, 4.8% and 9.7% (p ¼ 0.018), respectively (Fig. 2A), with a
relative risk 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.90).
Survival analysis further showed no statistical difference in time
to readmission or death between treatment groups (Fig. 2B). The
time to readmission was similar between groups (Fig. 2C). The
KaplaneMeier curve for mortality (Fig. 2D) showed significantly
greater survival with HP-HMB relative to placebo (p ¼ 0.013). In a
post hoc analysis adjusting for the imbalance of the NYHA clas-
sification, odds ratios for treatment effect were observed to be
homogeneous across classes (data not shown). Additionally, post
hoc estimation of the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1
death (method in Supplementary Table 4) was 20.3 (95% CI, 10.9
to 121.4).
Evaluation at 30 and 60 days postdischarge (Supplementary
Fig. 2) showed no significant differences between treatment for
the composite variable or for readmission alone, but mortality was
significantly lower in the HP-HMB group relative to placebo at 30
Fig. 2. Primary efficacy outcome and components (intention-to-treat population). A. No significant difference between treatment groups for the primary composite endpoint, but

 days (2.9% vs. 6.2%; p ¼ 0.049) and 60 days postdischarge (4.2% vs.
8.7%; p ¼ 0.020).
While mortality resulted from a range of causes, including
cancer in 3 patients diagnosed subsequent to study enrollment,
most
deaths
were
due
to
cardiorespiratory
conditions
(Supplementary Table 6).
3.4. Other efficacy endpoints
No significant effects on mean total LOS were observed (HP-
HMB, 5.0 [standard deviation (SD), 3.2] vs. placebo 5.1 [SD, 3.6]);
ADL was also similar between treatments at days 30, 60, and 90
(median [1st quartile, 3rd quartile] was 6 [6, 6] for both groups).
Changes were observed in nutritional status such that the propor-
tion of patients categorized as SGA-A (well-nourished) increased
over the study duration in both groups (Fig. 3A). These increases
were consistently greater with HP-HMB, peaking at day 90, with
45.5% of these patients classified as SGA-A compared with 30.0% in
the placebo group. The differences in SGA levels between groups at
day 90 resulted in significantly higher odds of patients in the HP-
HMB group achieving a better nutritional status relative to pla-
cebo (odds ratio ¼ 2.04, 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.25; p ¼ 0.009).
At day 30, body weight was improved by least squares mean
(standard error [SE]) of 0.55 (SE, 0.32) kg in HP-HMB group, but
decreased by 0.26 (SE, 0.34) kg from discharge in placebo, with a
difference showing significance (p ¼ 0.035; Fig. 3B). Although not
statistically different, changes in body weight were consistently
higher in HP-HMB group at days 60 and 90 (Fig. 3B). Serum levels of
25-hydroxyvitamin D (Fig. 4) were significantly higher with HP-
HMB than placebo at days 30 and 60 (p ¼ 0.035 and p ¼ 0.008,
respectively).
3.5. Safety
A comparable proportion of patients in both groups reported
treatment-emergent adverse
events (serious

Fig. 3. Nutritional status and weight change. While consistent improvements in nutritional status, as determined by the SGA scores, were observed over the study duration in both
treatment groups (A), the specialized, nutrient-dense oral nutritional supplement, HP-HMB, resulted in significantly higher odds of patients achieving a better nutritional status at
day 90 relative to the placebo group (odds ratio ¼ 2.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 3.25, p ¼ 0.009). The differences between treatments in body weight change from discharge significantly
favored HP-HMB at day 30 (B). CI, confidence interval; HP-HMB, high-protein beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate; LS, least squares; SE, standard error; SGA, Subjective Global

 adverse events; 44% in the placebo group and 47% in the HP-HMB
group, respectively (Table 3). In addition, study discontinuation
due to adverse events was not different between groups (12% pla-
cebo, 11% HP-HMB). The most common adverse events (occurring
in �5% of patients) were exacerbations of COPD, constipation, and
diarrhea (Table 3).
4. Discussion
Despite efforts in preventing and treating malnutrition, the
prevalence of disease-related malnutrition remains consistently
high [1]. The NOURISH study represents the largest randomized
controlled trial to date evaluating the effects of adding a specialized
nutrient-dense ONS therapy to standard of care on hospital read-
mission and mortality in an older population hospitalized for CHF,
AMI, PNA, and COPD. In addition to incorporating a rigorous
intention-to-treat study design, in contrast to many of the previous
studies included in meta-analyses [11e13], the patients were spe-
cifically required to show evidence of malnutrition at entry, as
indicated by inclusion criteria of SGA classes of B or C.
The primary composite endpoint was not achieved, and no
differences were observed with regard to readmission rates. This
lack of a difference in the readmission is in contrast to other studies
showing a reduction in readmission among patients treated with
ONS [13,14] and may be due to a variety of factors such as the
heterogeneity of the study population, length of follow-up, nutri-
tional treatment modality, and possibly the competing events of
readmission and mortality. In the present study, the higher mor-
tality in the placebo group may have contributed to the similar
hospital readmission rates in the 2 groups, since some patients died
without a readmission. The heterogeneity of patients with respect
to the included diagnoses and exclusion of patients with high-risk
conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and chronic renal failure may
also have contributed to the lack of significance for the composite
and readmission outcomes.
Initiation of HP-HMB during hospitalization and continuation
postdischarge resulted in a significantly lower mortality rate. At
each of the evaluated time points of 30, 60, and 90 days post-
discharge, there was a consistent reduction in mortality. This is in
accord with evidence suggesting that ONS intervention is associ-
ated with reduced mortality; a review of 32 trials reported a rela-
tive risk of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92) for mortality in ONS versus
control [11]. In addition, the NNT for HP-HMB was low (NNT ¼ 20.3)
suggesting that provision of HP-HMB to malnourished older adults
may be an effective strategy to improve current standard nutri-
tional care.
Adherence with study intervention was not different be-
tween treatment groups, and was similar to that of another
randomized controlled trial of oral nutritional supplements in
illness [22]. Adherence with intake of ONS has been reported to
have a wide range (38%e100%) in various studies [23], which in
the clinical setting may, in part, be dependent on appetite, other
clinical variables, or on reimbursement policies. Adherence with
ONS is challenging, even over a short period of intervention. In
one 28-day study, 40% of patients had less than one quarter of
intended consumption, 9% had 25%e50%, 16% had 50%e75%, and
35% had more than three quarters, yet the nutritional inter-
vention resulted in significant benefits over 6 months relative to
controls, including fewer readmissions [24]. In the current
study, the greater increases in body weight and serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D concentration among the HP-HMB patients
relative to placebo can be considered indicative of adherence
with product intake, although such increases are also likely to
indicate nutritional benefits.
The HP-HMB was unique in that, in addition to providing the
known essential macro- and micronutrients, it had a high protein
composition and was further supplemented with HMB. Both
protein and HMB supplementation have individually been shown
to improve protein accretion and attenuate LBM loss [18,25], the
latter of which is an independent predictor of mortality in older
adults [26]. Additionally, HMB may help prevent muscle protein
degradation during catabolic illness [27]. Increases in LBM and
body weight resulting from ONS therapy, with concomitant in-
creases in clinically relevant functional indices, have been espe-
cially noted in patients with COPD [28]. Additionally, in patients
with COPD, body weight is an independent predictor of mortality,
and in some patients, negative effects of low body weight may be
reversed with nutritional therapy [29].
This study may have limited generalizability, since it repre-
sents a selected initially hospitalized population, albeit for
common medical conditions that are considered the leading di-
agnoses contributing to postdischarge readmissions in older
adults [19,20]. Further, the current study was not designed to
determine
the
effect
of
individual
nutrients,
thus
the
specific components in HP-HMB that may be responsible for the
reduced mortality could not be determined. While lack of dietary
intake data other than for HP-HMB is a study limitation, the
significant differences in mortality may suggest that there are

 clinical benefits of HP-HMB regardless of a potential effect of
other dietary intake. The current body of evidence suggests
that providing patients with ONS does not reduce dietary intake
[30]. The difficulty in blinding nutritional studies may also be a
limitation, but several strategies were used to maintain the
double-blind, and there was no indication that this blind was
broken.
5. Conclusion
This double-blind, ITT, randomized, placebo-controlled study
showed
that
a
specialized,
nutrient-dense
ONS
containing
high protein and HMB did not alter the primary composite
endpoint of hospital readmission rates and mortality in this
specific population of malnourished, older adults hospitalized for
CHF, AMI, PNA, or COPD. However, early administration (within
72 h of hospitalization) of HP-HMB in addition to the current
nutritional care was associated with decreased postdischarge
mortality and improved nutritional status. Further analyses are
required to understand the mechanism(s) leading to these
observed effects.
