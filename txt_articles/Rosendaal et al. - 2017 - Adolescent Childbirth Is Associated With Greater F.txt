Background-—Previous studies observe associations between lifetime parity and cardiovascular disease, but relatively fewer
investigate age at first childbirth (AFB). Herein, we examine the association of AFB with a summary cardiovascular risk measure
(Framingham Risk Score [FRS]).
Methods and Results-—As part of the IMIAS (International Mobility in Aging Study), data were collected in 2012 among
1047 women, aged 65 to 74 years, from Canada, Albania, Colombia, and Brazil. FRSs were calculated to describe
cardiovascular risk profiles, and linear regression analyses were performed, adjusting for early life and socioeconomic
variables. Women with an AFB of <20 years were compared with women with an AFB of 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and ≥30 years,
as well as nulliparous women. We also compared FRS between combinations of AFB and parity categories: nulliparous
women, parity 1 to 3 combined with AFB <20 years, parity ≥4 with AFB <20 years, parity 1 to 3 with AFB ≥20 years, and
parity ≥4 with AFB ≥20 years. Women with an AFB of <20 years had a higher mean FRS compared with all other AFB
groups. Compared with the lowest AFB risk group (25–29 years), women with an AFB of <20 years had a 5.8-point higher
mean FRS (95% confidence interval, 3.4–8.3 points). Nulliparous women presented the lowest mean FRS in all analyses. The
analysis comparing combinations of AFB and parity categories showed no meaningful differences in FRS between women
who had 1 to 3 childbirths and those who had ≥4 childbirths within the stratum of AFB <20 years, and in the stratum of
AFB ≥20 years.
Conclusions-—Our analyses suggest that nulliparity and AFB, rather than increasing parity, drive the association with
cardiovascular disease risk. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e007058. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.007058.)

C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Women’s reproduc-
tive health is increasingly recognized as an important
contributing factor to CVD risk.2–6 Previous studies document
associations of greater lifetime parity,2,7 early age at menar-
che,3,8 and early age at menopause4 with CVD; however,
findings are not always consistent.9,10 Age at first childbirth
(AFB) is much less studied. In this article, we focus on 2
aspects of women’s reproductive health (AFB and parity) as
determinants of CVD risk in an international sample of
postmenopausal women.
Numerous studies observe associations between an early
AFB, especially adolescent childbirth, and all-cause mortal-
ity,11–14 and a few observe associations between AFB and
CVD risk factors, CVD events, and CVD mortality.6,15–18 Parity
has been examined more thoroughly than AFB,2,4,19–22
including as part of 2 systematic reviews on women’s
cardiovascular health.4,19 In those studies reporting statisti-
cally significant associations, typically nulliparous and multi-
parous women are at greater risk of CVD.4,19,21 Yet, AFB may
confound observed associations between parity and CVD,
because AFB is closely linked with parity.18 Women with early
AFB tend to have more children.23,24 For example, in 1 study
of middle-aged women from Brazil, those who gave birth as
adolescents were twice as likely to have ≥3 children across

 their lifetimes compared with women whose first childbirth
was during adulthood.23
AFB may influence CVD through pathways that range from
the purely physiological to the social and behavioral.15,17 On
one end of the spectrum, pregnancy-related physiological
changes may differ in adolescent compared with adult
women.25–29 For example, adolescent pregnant women may
be exposed to physiological changes accompanying preg-
nancy, such as insulin resistance, that irreversibly influence
cardiovascular health earlier in life. These changes contribute
to longer exposure durations and, thus, greater overall CVD
risk compared with women who have children later in life.15,30
In addition, well-conducted prospective studies document
greater weight gain and retention among pregnant adoles-
cents compared with adult pregnant women, likely contribut-
ing to later-life obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.25,26 On
the other end of the spectrum, associations between AFB and
CVD may be entirely social. The age at which a woman gives
birth likely has long-lasting consequences on educational
attainment, career opportunities, family relations, and family
support.31–33 The accumulation of adversities during a
woman’s
life
course
potentially
accelerates
aging
and
increases metabolic and cardiovascular risk through mecha-
nisms such as multisystem dysregulation (eg, greater allo-
static load).34,35
By using data from the IMIAS (International Mobility in
Aging Study), we investigate the relationship between self-
reported AFB, lifetime parity, and the Framingham Risk Score
(FRS), a summary measure of CVD risk. Because of previous
research on lifetime parity and CVD, we aim to disassociate
the effects of AFB from parity. This cohort of community-
dwelling older adults is unique in that it allows for examination
of the hypothesized association (ie, early childbirth is
associated with greater CVD risk) in 5 diverse settings with
widely differing levels of exposures and outcome.
Methods
The IMIAS
Data were collected as part of the IMIAS, a prospective cohort
study of community-dwelling older adults, conducted at 5
sites: Tirana (Albania), Natal (Brazil), Manizales (Colombia),
Kingston (Ontario, Canada), and Saint-Hyacinthe (Quebec,
Canada). Albania, Colombia, and Brazil are considered middle-
income countries and, on average, have lower educational
attainment, lower human development indexes, and higher
income and gender inequalities compared with Canada.36
The IMIAS cohort was established in 2012 and contains
2002 community-dwelling older adults, aged 65 to 74 years
at the time of recruitment. Approximately 200 women were
enrolled at each of the 5 sites. Participants with ≥4 errors on
the orientation scale of the Leganes Cognitive Test, a
screening tool for dementia in populations with low levels of
education,37,38 were excluded (0 in Kingston, 1 in Saint-
Hyacinthe and Tirana each, 2 in Manizales, and 5 in Natal).
These participants were excluded because they were likely
unable to complete the study protocols. Of the 2002
participants recruited to IMIAS, 1047 are women.
Recruitment and Study Procedures
In Manizales, �82% of the older adults are covered in the
public healthcare network, and the populations of Brazil,
Albania, and Canada have universal healthcare coverage,
facilitating affordable access to healthcare providers for most
older adults. Because high proportions of older adults in these
contexts are registered in the public health system, we
recruited through primary care centers. In Tirana, Natal, and
Manizales, participants were randomly selected from the
population registered at neighborhood health centers and
invited to participate in the study. Response rates were >90%
in Tirana, Manizales, and Natal. Ethics’ committees at the 2
Canadian universities did not allow direct contact with
potential participants. Canadian participants were, thus,
invited by a letter from their healthcare provider, encouraging
them to contact our field coordinator if they were interested in
participating in the study. In Saint-Hyacinthe and Kingston,
30% of the invited subjects contacted the field coordinator. Of
them, 95% participated in the study. Comparisons of the
population sampled in Canada with census data suggest that
participants recruited in Saint-Hyacinthe are representative of
the population of that city, whereas those in Kingston are
slightly better educated than the general population of older
adults of that city.
Unless otherwise requested, interviews were conducted at
the participants’ homes. Study questionnaires and supporting
materials were available in all local languages and adminis-
tered by interviewers who were trained according to the same
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
demonstrate, in postmenopausal women from multiple
global settings, that adolescent childbirth is related to
greater overall cardiovascular risk, as measured by the
Framingham Risk Score, compared with women who gave
birth at later ages, and compared with nulliparous women.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Adolescent childbirth may serve as a cardiovascular disease
risk marker; women who were adolescent mothers may
benefit from earlier and increased cardiovascular screening
to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events.

 protocol and standards. Anthropometric measures and blood
samples were also obtained at baseline. Blood samples were
analyzed for several cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers.
Analyses were conducted at the Medical School University
Hospital at Tirana (Tirana, Albania); Multilab Laboratory and
Alvaro Laboratorios (Natal, Brazil); Caldas University Hospital
(Manizales, Colombia); Kingston General Hospital (Kingston,
Ontario, Canada); and the Honor�
e Mercier Hospital (Saint-
Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada). More details on the study sites,
populations, and recruitment can be found in the study by
Zunzunegui et al.39 Of the 1047 women who participated in
the IMIAS baseline data collection, cardiometabolic data from
blood samples were available for 908 (87%). Complete data on
all covariates included in this study (see measures below)
were available for 892 women (85%), or 98% of those with FRS
data.
Human Subjects
Institutional review for this project was obtained from the
relevant organizations at each site: the Institute of Public
Health in Albania, the Federal University of Rio Grande do
Norte in Brazil, the University of Caldas in Colombia, the
University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre, and Queen’s
University in Canada. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
Primary Outcome Measure
FRSs are based on the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term
cardiovascular cohort study, ongoing in Framingham, MA.40
Several FRSs have been developed to estimate the CVD,
coronary heart disease, and stroke risk of an individual. We
use 10-year laboratory-based CVD risk equations based on
sex, age, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension,
total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, and
diabetes mellitus status.41
Blood pressure was measured 3 times after at least
5 minutes of rest using a validated automated blood pressure
device. The mean value of the second and third systolic blood
pressure measurements was used to inform the Framingham
equation. As part of the survey, participants were requested
to show the interviewer all containers of medication that they
used; these were recorded. A participant was considered to
be taking antihypertensive medication when either antihyper-
tensive medication was presented or the participant self-
reported using antihypertensive medication. Cholesterol and
glycosylated hemoglobin measures were obtained through a
blood sample collected by a trained phlebotomist. Partici-
pants were considered to have diabetes mellitus based on a
high glycosylated hemoglobin level (≥6.5%),42 antidiabetic
medication, and/or self-reported diabetes mellitus. The latter
was determined by an affirmative response to the question
“Has a physician or nurse ever told you that you have diabetes
mellitus (ie, high blood glucose levels)?” Smoking and age
were self-reported.
Exposure Variables
AFB and parity were self-reported. We operationalized AFB
into 5 categories: <20 years, 20 to 24 years, 25 to 29 years,
≥30 years, and nulliparous women. Most studies examining
AFB and CVD events have defined their youngest age group as
<20 years.6,18 Because we hypothesize that younger AFB is
associated with greater CVD risk, we treated AFB <20 years
as the reference group. To dissociate between AFB and parity
when examining the association with FRS, we additionally
conducted analyses in which we compared FRS according to
combinations of AFB and parity categories. We categorized
women into 5 groups: nulliparous women, parity 1 to 3
combined with AFB <20 years, parity ≥4 combined with AFB
<20 years, parity 1 to 3 combined with AFB ≥20 years, and
parity ≥4 combined with AFB ≥20 years. These parity
categories were selected on the basis of previous work
suggesting that parity is associated with CVD in a J-shaped
manner, with the lowest risk observed among women with 2
births.21
Covariates
Age and study site
The trained interviewer recorded these data.
Childhood social and economic adversity
On the basis of a previous validation study with the IMIAS
data,43 a participant was considered to have experienced
childhood social adversity if she reported parental alcohol or
drug abuse, witnessing physical violence in the family, and/or
physical abuse during childhood. A participant was considered
to have experienced childhood economic adversity if she
reported poor economic status, hunger, or unwanted parental
unemployment. Childhood adversities were self-reported and
pertained to the first 15 years of life.43
Education and income
Educational level was categorized into tertiles (low, medium,
and high) of self-reported years of education. Because of the
large difference in years of education between the research
sites, these tertiles were determined site specifically as
follows: Kingston, <15, 15 to 17, and ≥18 years; Saint-
Hyacinthe, <11, 11 to 12, and ≥13 years; Tirana, <8, 8 to 12,
and ≥13 years; and Latin American sites, <4, 4 to 5, and ≥6
years. Participant income level was site specific and classified

 into 3 categories (poor, middle, and middle high/high), as
follows: Canadian sites, annual income of <20 000, 20 000
to 40 000, >40 000 CAD; Latin American sites, monthly
income of <1 minimum salary, 1 minimum salary, and ≥2
minimum salaries; and Albania, annual income of <1000,
1000 to 2000, and ≥2000 USD.
Statistical Analyses and Conceptual Framework
We explored the population characteristics of the sample with
descriptive statistics. In bivariate analyses, we used 2-sample
independent t tests for dichotomous variables and ANOVA for
polytomous variables to examine associations between pop-
ulation characteristics and FRS.
Figure 1 depicts our conceptual framework with relevant
citations supporting each arrow in the model.6,15–17,44–52
Directed acyclic graphs were used to establish the minimum
confounders required for the multivariate analyses. With linear
regression models, we examined the covariate-adjusted
associations between AFB, parity, and FRS. The models were
built in a step-wise manner based on our conceptual
framework. Accordingly, participant age and study site were
considered as confounders in all models. Childhood social and
economic adversities were included as dichotomous variables
in the second model, whereas educational level and income
were added to the third model. We consider the covariates
added in the first 2 models as likely confounders. The third
model is exploratory. The covariates added in the last model
may confound the association between AFB and CVD risk, but
may also be on the pathway between AFB and CVD risk, in
which case their inclusion in the model would entail
overadjustment. For example, an environment with lower
educational opportunities may predispose women to have
children at a young age. At the same time, having a child at a
young age may also influence future educational and profes-
sional opportunities. In the analyses of the combined AFB and
parity categories, we statistically adjust only for the likely
confounders (age, study site, and childhood adversities)
because the third model is more exploratory.
Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the
robustness of our findings, because not all study participants
agreed to have laboratory measures taken. For 139 women,
we could not calculate a 10-year CVD score using the
laboratory FRS equations. We, thus, ran an analysis with the
office-based FRS, using body mass index (height and weight
were measured in the study) instead of cholesterol measures
and self-reported diabetes mellitus or presence of antidia-
betic medication in lieu of glycosylated hemoglobin level.
Data for these analyses were available for 1039 participants
(99% of IMIAS women). We also examined AFB according to
whether the participant did or did not have laboratory data;
there were no significant differences according to missing-
ness.
Regression diagnostics were performed to examine the
validity of all linear regression models. This included perform-
ing log-transformed analyses because of the right-skewed
distribution of the FRS. Data were analyzed with Stata, version
14.

Sample Characteristics
Table 1 presents the participant characteristics according to
AFB categories. Adolescent childbirth was much more preva-
lent in the Latin American study sites compared with the
Albanian and Canadian sites. Of the 188 women who reported
a first childbirth at <20 years old, 68.1% were from the Latin
American sites. Women who were <20 years old at first
childbirth had an overall higher prevalence of childhood
economic and social adversity when compared with older AFB
categories, especially the 25 to 29 years category. Young AFB
women tended to have lower educational attainment and
more often fell into the low-income category. Women with a
young AFB were also more likely to have given birth to ≥4
children (75.5%, compared with 37.6% of women with an AFB
of 20–24 years, 13.1% of women with an AFB of 25–29 years,
and 5.4% of women with an AFB of ≥30 years).
FRS by Sample Characteristics
The average FRS was 19.5 (SD, 13.1), with the lowest mean in
Kingston and the highest mean in Tirana. Higher mean FRS
scores indicate greater CVD risk. Older ages, childhood
economic adversity, low education, younger AFB, and higher
parity were significantly associated with higher mean FRS. No

 large differences in FRS were observed between individuals
with or without childhood social adversities or between
individuals with current low, middle, or high incomes in the
bivariate analyses (Table 2).
AFB and FRS
Table 3 presents the results of the multivariate models based
on our conceptual model. Young AFB was positively associ-
ated with FRS. Statistically adjusting for age, study site, and
childhood adversities, women with an AFB of <20 years had
3.1 points higher mean FRS (95% confidence interval [CI],
1.0–5.3) compared with women with an AFB of 20 to 24
years, 5.6 points higher mean FRS (95% CI, 3.1–8.2)
compared with women with an AFB of 25 to 29 years, 3.9
points higher mean FRS (95% CI, 1.0–6.8) compared with
women with an AFB of ≥30, and 6.7 points higher mean FRS
(95% CI, 3.8–9.6) compared with nulliparous women (model 2)
(Table 3). The association was only slightly attenuated in
model 3, although the sample size also decreased. The results
of model 3 are visually presented in Figure 2.
The association between AFB and FRS differed by study
site (Table 4). For the Canadian sites, adjusting for age, study
site, and childhood adversities, women with an AFB of <20
years had a higher mean FRS compared with all other groups,
but only significantly so when compared with women with an
AFB of ≥30 years (3.7 points; 95% CI, 0.1–7.3 points). Young
AFB was strongly associated with higher FRS in Natal;
compared with women with an AFB of 25 to 29 years, women
with an AFB of <20 years had 11.5 (95% CI, 3.1–19.9) points
higher mean FRS. In Tirana, we observed a J-shaped
association: those with an AFB of <20 years had 8.7 (95%
CI, 1.4–16.0) points higher mean FRS compared with those
with an AFB of 25 to 29 years, but 2.6 (95% CI, �12.5 to 7.4)
points lower mean FRS compared with those with an AFB of
≥30 years. In both Tirana and Natal, mean FRS scores of the
AFB <20 years group were also high compared with the
nulliparous category (9.8 points in Tirana and 16.3 points in
Natal; P<0.01). For Manizales, women with a young AFB had a
higher FRS compared with the other groups, but this
difference was small and not statistically significant.
Parity, AFB, and FRS
Table 5 presents results for the combined AFB and parity
categories, compared with nulliparous women, adjusted for
study site, age, and childhood adversities. Although all parous
groups have a higher mean FRS compared with nulliparous
women, the difference between those with low parity (1–3)
and high parity (≥4) is small when we examine across equal
AFB groups (0.2 points in the 2 AFB ≥20 groups and 1.1 in the
2 AFB <20 groups). In contrast, there is a stark difference in
mean FRS between the <20 versus ≥20 years AFB groups
when we examine across equal parity categories. In the 1 to 3
parity category, women with an AFB of <20 years had 3.1
points higher mean FRS compared with women with an AFB of
≥20. In the ≥4 parity category, the difference between the 2
AFB groups is 4.0 points (Table 4).

 Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis using the office-based FRS yielded
results that were consistent with the results of the laboratory-
based FRS (Table 6); women <20 years at first childbirth had
the greatest mean FRS across all models. We also performed
a log-transformed analysis because of the right-skewed nature
of the FRS measure, and these analyses yielded similar
results, with slightly different effect sizes. For ease of
interpretation, we only present the nontransformed model
(log-transformed results are available on request).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
demonstrate, in postmenopausal women from multiple global
settings, that adolescent childbirth is related to higher mean
cardiovascular risk, as measured by FRS, compared with
women who gave birth at later ages, and compared with
nulliparous women. This association remained even after
statistical adjustment for socioeconomic variables that may
be on the pathway between AFB and FRS. Nulliparous women
had the lowest average FRS. Among parous women, women
with an AFB of 25 to 29 years had the lowest average FRS.
We also attempted to dissociate parity from AFB in
examining the association with CVD risk. The analyses in
which we used combination categories of AFB and parity
allowed us to investigate differences related to parity for
women in the same AFB category, and differences related to
AFB for women in the same parity category. We observed
small differences between women with a parity of 1 to 3
compared with women with a parity of ≥4 within equivalent

 AFB categories. We observed large differences between
women with an AFB of <20 years compared with women
with an AFB of ≥20 years within the same parity categories.
All 4 AFB/parity categories had a higher mean FRS when
compared with nulliparous women, suggesting that both AFB
and nulliparity, but not increasing parity, drives the associa-
tion with FRS.
Comparison With Other Studies
This is the first study to examine the association between
adolescent childbirth and FRS as a measure of cardiovascular
risk. As a result, we cannot compare our results with other
studies examining the same outcome. Instead, we can
compare our results with a limited number of studies
examining the association between AFB and other CVD (risk)
outcomes. Other studies observed positive associations with
young AFB and overweight status,44 high blood pres-
sure,16,53,54 and diabetes mellitus–related mortality.55 In
previous work using IMIAS data, we reported statistically
significant associations between AFB ≤18 years and partici-
pant-reported physician-diagnosed high blood pressure (odds
ratio, 2.1) and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 1.9), and a
marginal association with stroke (odds ratio, 1.9; P=0.06).24 Of
3 studies56–58 analyzing AFB and metabolic syndrome, another
summary measure of CVD that includes many of the compo-
nents that are also accounted for in the FRS, 2 observed a
positive association of young AFB with metabolic syn-
drome.56,57 In a recent analysis of the 1958 British birth
cohort study, the authors observed a relationship between
adolescent
childbirth
and
many
metabolic
parameters
assessed individually: higher body mass index, waist:hip ratio,
blood pressure, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin, and
lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.6 Finally, we recently
conducted a systematic review on AFB and CVD events and
mortality. The study findings were relatively consistent when
young AFB was defined as 20 years or younger and pointed
towards increased risk for CVD for women with a young AFB.18

 In our analysis that compared combination categories of
AFB and parity, we found an association between FRS and
AFB, and between FRS and nulliparity, but not between FRS
and greater lifetime parity. Although we do not know of any
other studies that examined parity in relation to FRS, 10
studies57–66 have examined associations between parity and
metabolic syndrome. Nine studies58–66 observed a positive
association between parity and metabolic syndrome. Of these
9 studies, 559–61,64,66 did not adjust for the participants’ AFB.
AFB is closely linked with parity23,24; by not adjusting for AFB,
differences in FRS may mistakenly be attributed to parity
when, in fact, AFB is driving the association. The results from
our analyses, in which we report on associations within strata
of parity and AFB, suggest that it is AFB, and not increasing
parity, that is associated with FRS. The 4 remaining
studies58,62,63,65 that still observed a positive association
between parity and metabolic syndrome all adjusted for AFB,
but as a continuous linear variable. This may result in residual
confounding by AFB if there is a reverse J-shaped association
of AFB and CVD risk.
Mechanisms
Pregnancy has been described as a physiological “stress”
test.67 Although some of the nulliparous women in our sample
may have miscarried or terminated pregnancies, as a group,
they would have experienced dramatically lower mean levels
of pregnancy-related complications and no, or much shorter,
durations of stress tests on the body. These findings
potentially explain the lower mean FRSs observed in the
nulliparous group. Common pregnancy complications, such as
gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertensive disorders, may

contributing
to
CVD.68
Preeclampsia, in particular, may be associated with increased
later-life risk of CVD.69 Meta-analysis on the topic reports that
women who experienced preeclampsia have nearly 3 times
the risk of developing hypertension later in life and approx-
imately double the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
events.69 It is unclear whether preeclampsia represents an
independent causal risk factor for CVD by inducing systematic
endothelial damage that manifests later in life or whether
preeclampsia and CVD share a common underlying risk
factor.69 Early childbearing is a risk factor for preeclampsia.70
Preeclampsia may, therefore, be on the pathway between
early childbearing and CVD risk later in life.
Our findings warrant future research investigating the
pathways that may explain the observed associations.
Selection mechanisms, and mediation through physiological
and social pathways, could explain the observed association
between AFB and FRS. There may be unobserved characteris-
tics in childhood and puberty, such as a risk-seeking personality
that “selects” women into both adolescent pregnancies and
risky health behaviors; these negatively influence lifetime
cardiovascular health.33,71 Alternatively, or in combination,
greater gain and retention of body weight, fewer career
opportunities, higher stress levels, preeclampsia and other
pregnancy complications, smaller social networks, and less
social support are examples of possible mediators between
early AFB and higher FRSs.25,26,31–33,69 The lack of a uniform
association across the study sites supports the possibility of
social factors mediating the observed associations. Possibly,
different familial, social, and governmental support across
study sites may alter the association between AFB and FRS.

Early Childbirth Associated With Cardiovascular Risk
Rosendaal et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 Limitations
Study participants were asked to report retrospectively about
the reproductive exposures of AFB and parity, which may have
introduced recall bias. However, both are major life events
that are unlikely to have been forgotten. Furthermore, all
study participants passed the orientation scale of the Leganes
cognitive test for dementia, limiting the possibility that
cognitive decline influenced recall.37,38 More important,
selective survival may have influenced our results, likely
reducing the strength of association observed.72–74 If expo-
sure of early AFB is associated with higher CVD risk, a larger
proportion of high-risk individuals may have “selected out” of
the sample by not surviving to recruitment. Sampled women
were between 64 and 75 years; in places like Natal, Brazil,
these women have nearly doubled their life expectancy at
birth.74
The FRS equation that we used is typically used to predict
10-year CVD risk in a clinical setting for individual patients with
no CVD diagnosed. Our analyses examining the association of
AFB, parity, and cardiovascular risk, measured by FRS, used a
sample that contained participants with and without CVD. We
are not unique in using the FRS as a composite measure of CVD
risk; a similar approach was also taken by the CARMELA
(Cardiovascular Risk Factor Multiple Evaluation in Latin
America) study when assessing prevalent cardiovascular risk
in a population of �11 500 participants from 7 Latin American
cities.75 Although it is inappropriate to interpret the FRSs
obtained in these analyses for prediction purposes, the FRS
does provide a useful and elegant composite measure of the
classic risk factors for CVD. Finally, laboratory-based FRSs
were not available for 13% of the women who participated in the
study. However, the sensitivity analyses with office-based FRS,
which were available for >99% of study participants, revealed
markedly similar results.
Conclusions
Adolescent childbirth was frequent in our sample of older
adults, especially among those from Latin America. Ado-
lescent childbearing remains an issue of global importance,
with an estimated 11% of births worldwide occurring among
adolescents.76
Besides
the
known
risks
of
adolescent
childbirth (eg, delivery complications and stillbirth),76 our
study suggests that young AFBs are associated with long-
term CVD risk. As highlighted above, more work is needed
to carve out the pathways by which AFB is associated with
CVD. Although we cannot accredit causal inference, at the
least, young AFB can serve as a risk marker. Identification
of this higher-risk group could prove useful for clinicians,
because women who were adolescent mothers may benefit
from earlier and increased cardiovascular screening to
reduce the incidence of CVD events. The clear dissociation
of AFB and elevated parity in the association with CVD
suggests that nulliparity and AFB, rather than increasing
parity, drive the association with CVD risk. This finding
provides a possible explanation for the conflicting results
that have been reported in the literature to date on parity
and CVD.
