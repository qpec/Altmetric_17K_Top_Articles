In Brief
Reid et al. find that the human fetus in the
third trimester prefers to look at face-like
stimuli when contrasted with the same
stimuli in an inverted configuration,
suggesting that this predisposition does
not require postnatal experience and
showing that the delivery of visual stimuli
via maternal tissue to the fetus is
technically feasible.

SUMMARY
In the third trimester of pregnancy, the human fetus
has the capacity to process perceptual information
[1–3]. With advances in 4D ultrasound technology,
detailed assessment of fetal behavior [4] is now
possible. Furthermore, modeling of intrauterine con-
ditions has indicated a substantially greater lumi-
nance within the uterus than previously thought [5].
Consequently, light conveying perceptual content
could be projected through the uterine wall and
perceived by the fetus, dependent on how light inter-
faces with maternal tissue. We do know that human
infants at birth show a preference to engage with
a top-heavy, face-like stimulus when contrasted
with all other forms of stimuli [6, 7]. However, the
viability of performing such an experiment based
on visual stimuli projected through the uterine wall
with fetal participants is not currently known. We
examined fetal head turns to visually presented up-
right and inverted face-like stimuli. Here we show
that the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy is
more likely to engage with upright configural stimuli
when contrasted to inverted visual stimuli, in a
manner similar to results with newborn participants.
The current study suggests that postnatal experi-
ence is not required for this preference. In addition,
we describe a new method whereby it is possible
to deliver specific visual stimuli to the fetus. This
new technique provides an important new pathway
for the assessment of prenatal visual perceptual
capacities.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the present study, we examined how the human fetus would
respond to upright and inverted face-like stimuli in a paradigm
modified from newborn research [6]. Based on a prior computa-
tional model of the fetal visual system during the third trimester
[8], we propose that the fetus will produce more head turning
to the upright contrasted with the inverted stimuli, in a manner
consistent with postnatal studies.
Behavioral responses to stimuli were assessed in 39 fetuses
by an ultrasonographer and an experimenter, utilizing 4D ultra-
sound. Once comfortable, a set of 2D scans were taken
comprising the fetal head position, maternal tissue thickness,
fetal biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, head circum-
ference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and fetal esti-
mated weight. Fetal biometry measurements demonstrated
normal fetal growth without fetal anomalies. All participants
were then asked not to talk during the study and to remain as still
as possible in order to optimize image quality. The initial 2D scan
also informed the experimenter of the precise location of the fetal
head prior to the presentation of the stimuli.
The stimuli were projected in two orientations (‘‘upright’’ and
‘‘inverted’’) on the maternal abdomen (Figure 1). Both images
were presented to the side of the fetal face, such that the stimuli
were presented to the fetal retinal visual areas (left, n = 19; right,
n = 20). The light was then moved across the maternal abdomen
in a horizontal direction away from the fetal central visual loca-
tion, for approximately 5 s at an average of 1 cm per second.
This is consistent with speeds reported in newborn studies [6]
taking into account constraints specific to this population, i.e.,
the width of maternal abdomen that was accessible in order to
present stimuli and the space within the womb available for the
fetus to move. Timing was controlled via a stopwatch in view
of the experimenter who was delivering the stimuli. This process
was repeated a total of five times, with the procedure then imme-
diately repeated with the alternate stimulus orientation. The pre-
sentation order for upright and inverted orientations of the stimuli
was counterbalanced across the sample.
The number of head turns made in response to the stimuli
was assessed using condition-blind coding of the 4D scans. On
average, Figure 2 shows that more head turns were made in the
direction of the upright (mean [M] = 1.03, SD = 1.09) than in the di-
rection of the inverted (M = 0.44, SD = 0.60) stimuli. There were
slightly more head turns in the opposite direction to the inverted
(M = 0.36, SD = 0.58) than the upright (M = 0.26, SD = 0.50) stimuli.
A Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated that more head turns
were directed toward than away from the upright stimuli (Z =
3.642, p < 0.001). Further, significantly more head turns were
directed toward the upright than the inverted stimuli (Z = 2.406,
p = 0.016). No further comparisons were found to be significant.

 In addition, a paired-samples t test compared difference
scores (looks toward minus looks away) showing a significant
difference between upright (M = 0.77, SD = 1.06) and inverted
(M = 0.08, SD = 0.81) stimuli, t(38) = 2.974, p = 0.005. This is sup-
ported by non-parametric analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test, z = 2.719, p = 0.007.
These results indicate that the fetus in the third trimester is
more likely to engage with stimuli featuring an upright face-like
configuration when contrasted with an inverted configuration.
We therefore conclude that postnatal experience is not neces-
sary for the emergence of a preferential visual system for face-
like stimuli. This finding rules out rapid postnatal learning, such
as filial imprinting, as a mechanism for this visual proclivity.
These mechanisms may be innate, or, possibly, the perceptual
bias is triggered by exposure to patterned light in the womb
during prenatal visual experiences.
Prenatal Visual Experience
Inthethirdtrimesterofpregnancy,the humanfetushasthecapac-
ity to process perceptual information [1–3]. Despite this, newborn
visual preferences are often attributed to innate mechanisms or to
rapid imprinting. Postmortem analysis of the human eye has
shown that there is substantial biological development from
mid-gestation through to term, with many of the essential compo-
nents for visual function present starting around 25 weeks gesta-
tional age (GA) [11, 12]. This research also indicated more
advanced development in peripheral visual regions. Before post-
natal development, peripheral vision is therefore likely to be more
sensitive than foveal vision for detecting environmental change.
Workonprenatalvisual developmentsuggeststhatvisual percep-
tual capacities are analogous to newborn functionality well before

Stimuli

inverted (C and D) orientations. (A) and (C) illustrate
the stimuli prior to contact with maternal tissue. (B)
and (D) display the consequence of interaction with
30 mm of maternal tissue based on our equation. To
calculate the expected projection size, we used the
simple equation for the anisotropy of scatter [9]
along with a value for adipose tissue [10] from the
corrected version of Figure 8 (expanded view in
the Corrigendum, page 2): projected diameter =

term. Evidence also derives from reports of
visual function in low-risk pre-term infants.
Studies have shown newborns perform
fixing and tracking from 32 weeks GA
[13–16]. Further, comparing visual evoked
potentials in full-term neonates to concep-
tion age-matched pre-term infants, no dif-
ference was found in neural response to
visual stimuli [17]. Postnatal visual experi-
ence therefore did not affect the neural
correlates of visual processing.
Recent modeling work has indicated a substantially greater
luminance within the uterus than previously thought [5]. Animal
models have demonstrated not only that light penetrates into
the uterus but also that light penetration is critical in mice for
preparing the eye and light response pathway for postnatal
vision [18]. Together, these studies indicate that visual experi-
ence starts prenatally. Prenatal light levels not only are essential
for the development of visual pathways but also allow for the
innovative methodology used in the current study, with percep-
tual content projected through the uterine wall, taking into
account how light interfaces with maternal tissue.
From Prenatal to Postnatal Visual Development
Control of the eyes by neonates is relatively advanced when con-
trasted with other motor abilities [19]. It is for this reason that vi-
sual paradigms are a key aspect of postnatal research. Research
on fetal visual perception, however, is limited when compared
with our current understanding of fetal abilities in other modal-
ities [20]. During avian development, as a consequence of em-
bryo orientation in the egg, differential exposure to light for the
left or right eye due to the location of the wing results in brain
lateralization in chicks [21]. Multiple studies have investigated
the response of the human fetal brain to light [22], although
none have delivered stimuli that have contained the percept of
an image. This absence has been driven by the complexity of
delivering visual stimuli to the fetus.
One key, well-replicated finding in newborn research is the
preference to engage with a face-like stimulus when contrasted
with other forms of stimuli, including the same stimulus pre-
sented in an inverted configuration [6, 7]. There has been much
debate on how and why this preference is present in the
1826

 emerging visual system [23, 24]. A comprehensive review of two
decades of research offers an extension to the original theoret-
ical model put forward in explanation of newborn face prefer-
ence [25]. The underlying assumptions in much of the newborn
visual literature are (1) that no visual experience has taken place
prior to birth and (2) that the examination of fetal visual capacities
is not possible. The present study illustrates that fetal visual
perception can be indexed during the third trimester, given the
technical advances in 4D ultrasound that can provide access
to fetal fine-grained behavior [26–28]. With appropriate modifica-
tions, other aspects of newborn infant perception could also be
assessed in the third trimester, including biological motion
processing [29]. An exploration of capacities at this stage of
development could greatly inform our understanding of visual
preferences, as models of development feature different as-
sumptions related to the underlying development of visual sys-
tems. For example, even though the results of the present study
are compatible with superior colliculus activity [8], the same
cannot be said for a proposed ‘‘gravity bias’’ for visual stimuli,
which has been previously proposed [30].
Even though the results of the current study are analogous to
postnatal behaviors, due to the properties of the fetal environ-
ment, the paradigm and stimuli are not exactly the same be-
tween the current study and postnatal research. For example,
only light from the red (or long wave) end of the spectrum pene-
trates maternal tissue. Despite this, the results are consistent
with a model of fetal visual preferences [8], whereby the largest
differential response was for a negative polarity stimulus set
with white dots on a black background when contrasted with
other stimuli, including black dots on a white background. It
should also be noted that the results of the present study do
not imply that the fetus can respond to faces presented exter-
nally under everyday circumstances. The behavior that has
been demonstrated in the current study derives from the specific
conditions of the experiment.
The capacity to (1) present visual stimuli through projected
light and (2) precisely measure fetal behavior using ultrasound
recordings, as demonstrated in the present study, allows for
the execution of studies with the human fetus that closely
resemble postnatal methodologies with infant populations.
Such an approach will have implications for further understand-
ing of the fetus [31] and developmental processes in general.
Fetal research can consequently employ similar visual method-
ologies and control procedures as those seen in the infancy
domain (e.g., [29, 32]). Currently it is unknown how effective
these methods would be in terms of producing responses earlier
in gestation or whether infant-derived paradigms, such as fixa-
tion time measurements, will be as likely to produce meaningful
results with the fetus in the third trimester. Such work will un-
doubtedly provide more information about the development of
the visual system in addition to current animal models [18] and
with respect to the transition from fetus to infant.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
The sample size was calculated based on attrition rates for newborn paradigms with the assumption of a 20% larger attrition rate for the
current study due to the number of fetal head orientations that would allow for the delivery of stimuli. All pregnant women participating
receivedwritten information prior to agreeing to take part inthestudy andgave informed written consent beforeparticipation. This study
was approved by NHS Health Research Authority National Research Ethics Service, the Lancaster University Research Ethics
Committee, the Durham University Psychology Department Ethics Sub-Committee and the Cumbria University Ethics Committee.
Behavioral responses to stimuli were assessed in 83 fetuses by an ultrasonographer and an experimenter, utilizing 4d ultrasound.
Two were excluded due to technical errors leading to corrupt source recordings. Thirteen were excluded due to poor image resolution.
All instances of exclusion in this sample due to fetal head position causing visual stimuli presentation to become unviable, co-occurred
with poor image resolution. Twenty-nine were excluded at the coding stage as these fetuses indicated a lack of eye or body movements
throughout the scanning period and appeared to be in a deep sleep state, otherwise referred to as behavioral state 1F [33].
The final sample consisted of 39 fetuses, gestational age between 231 and 252 days (M = 240.62 days). Maternal tissue thickness
ranged from 13.1 mm to 69.7 mm (M = 27.47, SD = 10.32). Seventeen fetuses were female (44%) with the sample showing an average
APGAR score of 9.64 (SD = 1.06), although birth records for 5 participants could not be obtained. Twenty-one scans were performed
at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, the remainder at Cumbria University Medical Imaging Unit. All participants had singleton pregnancies
with no known complications and a BMI of approximately 30 or lower at the start of pregnancy. A BMI of this level or lower was
required in order to ensure a similar quality of presentation of the stimuli through varying amounts of maternal tissue.
METHOD DETAILS
Stimuli
The stimuli were constructed from custom-made semiconductor laser 2 mm dot diodes emitting at 650 nm. Three diodes were ar-
ranged in a triangular pattern, with 15 mm distance between each dot. The light source was calibrated to output optical powers of 0.5
mW, 1 mW or 5 mW for maternal tissue thickness (t) below 15 mm, between 15 mm and 30 mm and above 30 mm respectively. This

modified from [5] to remove the clothing factor. LE, the external illuminance was calculated using the output power of the light source,
assuming a projected spot size diameter of 10 mm for a maternal tissue thickness of 30 mm, and correcting for the source wavelength
of 650 nm, based on values in [34]. An approximate muscle to fat ratio (r) of 2 was used, as in [5]. Taking three scenarios as examples,
with maternal tissue thicknesses of 15 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm, we calculate corresponding intrauterine illuminances of 36, 24 and
16 lx respectively. Figure 1 displays the projected input to maternal tissue and the approximate consequence of interaction with
maternal tissue for the stimuli. The light levels of the stimuli are all within the range that the fetal visual system is thought to work
best, and significantly lower than the illuminances that a fetus may be exposed to on a bright sunny day [5]. The estimated distance
between the dots subtended 23 degrees of visual angle. The laser diodes were 15 mm apart and 2 mm in diameter. We estimated an
average scatter of 5 mm in either direction, resulting in 5 mm between the dots. This degree of visual angle between the dots is similar
to that seen in postnatal studies [e.g., 35].
The dispersion of the input configuration of the light source after traveling through 30 mm of maternal tissue, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, was estimated using data from [9]. Using a value for the anisotropy of scatter at the source wavelength for adipose taken from
[35] results in an expected broadening of a point source to a diameter of 12 mm after transmission through 30 mm of tissue. It should
be noted that the minor dispersion, due to amniotic fluid between the fetus’ eye and the uterine wall, has not been taken into account
due to uncertainties in quantifying this measure.
Data Acquisition
Maternal tissue was measured from maternal skin to the uterine wall using 2D ultrasound. The 4D live ultrasound technology operated
on a bandwidth of 2-8MHz. Fetal behavior was recorded at Blackpool Victoria Hospital using a GE Healthcare Voluson E8 Expert
BT13 advanced 4D HD live ultrasound scanner and 4D probe, model RM66. At Cumbria University Medical Imaging Unit, a GE
Healthcare Voluson iBT07 4D live ultrasound scanner and 4D probe, model RAB4-8-RS was used. Recordings were saved to
DVD for offline coding.
Procedure
The ultrasonographer ensured the ultrasound recording occurred while the experimenter selected the correct strength stimulus, de-
pending on maternal tissue depth, and conducted the procedure. Typically the participant was lying on her side. Timings were
controlled via a stopwatch and noted on a clipboard, typically by a second experimenter. Once comfortable, an initial set of 2D scans
were taken comprising the fetal head position, maternal tissue thickness, fetal biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, head
circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, fetal weight. Fetal biometry measurements demonstrated normal fetal
growth and no fetal anomalies. Note that depth scans were taken in the same maternal position as for when the stimulus was
then presented. All participants were then asked not to talk during the study and to remain as still as possible in order to optimize
image quality. The 2D scan also informed the experimenter of the precise location of the fetal head prior to the presentation of
the stimuli.
The stimuli were delivered in two orientations (‘‘upright’’ and ‘‘inverted’’) to the maternal abdomen (Figure 1) relative to the position
of the fetus (breech presentation/head up, n = 6, cephalic presentation/head down, n = 33). Both were presented to the side of the
fetal face, such that the stimuli were presented to the fetal peripheral visual areas (left, n = 19, right, n = 20). The experimenter was not
blind to the condition that was presented. The ultrasound image, interpreted by the ultrasonographer, informed the initial placement
of the light source on the maternal abdomen at the start of each trial. This gave the greatest likelihood that the experimenter could
place the light in the peripheral visual field of the fetus. The experimenter utilized the ultrasound image for initial placement but at-
tended to the movement of the stimulus across the maternal abdomen, precluding the viewing of the ultrasound image once the trial
had started. The administration of the stimulus was standardized across conditions by ensuring equivalent timing between condi-
tions. From the 39 scans, the mean distance of the fetal eye to the uterine wall was 12 mm, SD 7.5 mm, with range 2 mm to 30 mm.
The stimulus was then moved across the maternal abdomen in a horizontal direction away from the fetal central visual location, for
5 s at an average speed of 1 cm per second. This is consistent with speeds reported in newborn studies [6] taking into account con-
straints specific to this population, i.e., the width of maternal tissue that was accessible in order to present stimuli and the space avail-
able for the fetus to move. Movement and light offset was simultaneous and timing was controlled via a stopwatch in view of the
experimenter who was delivering the stimuli. This process was repeated a total of 5 times, with the procedure then immediately
repeated with the alternate stimulus orientation. The presentation order for upright and inverted orientations of the stimuli were coun-
terbalanced across the sample. Participants were blind to condition.
Data Coding
During the scan, the position of the light in relation to the recorded image of the fetus was noted. The ultrasound image was rotated by
the sonographer such that the fetal face appeared upright. This was done so that, at a later stage, coding consisted of simply ‘‘left’’
and ‘‘right’’ head movements in the coronal plane. Coding of recordings was conducted offline using Observer XT 12.5 software

 (Tracksys Ltd). The duration of head movements away from the individual fetus’ initial resting head position were measured, along
with the direction of the movement for each trial. At the start of each trial, the resting position of the head on the ultrasound image was
recorded and coded as ‘‘center.’’ At the onset of a head movement, a code denoted the start time and direction of movement. This
code then remained active until a second code was given to indicate a return to the initial resting head position, a head movement in
the opposite direction (an opposite head movement was then coded) or the end of a trial. The onset of any head movement was not
constrained to the onset of the stimulus but no movements were coded following stimulus offset.
Following blind coding, ‘left’ and ‘right’ head movements were transformed to indicate whether movements were made toward or
away from the stimuli. An orientation toward the stimuli was a horizontal head movement in accordance with the position of the light
recording during the scan. An orientation away from the stimuli was a horizontal head movement performed in the opposite direction
to the recorded position of the light source.
Cohen’s kappa was performed to determine interrater agreement on fetal head movements. There was a substantial agreement
between two coders’ judgments, k = 0.797 (95% CI, 0.503 �1.00), p = <0.001. Behavioral measurement was thus deemed to be suit-
able for use in the hypothesis tests in the present study [36].
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Using SPSS statistical data package, version 23, a comparison of the number of head turns across conditions was made using the
Wilcoxon rank signed test. A comparison of difference scores was also made using a paired-samples t test.
