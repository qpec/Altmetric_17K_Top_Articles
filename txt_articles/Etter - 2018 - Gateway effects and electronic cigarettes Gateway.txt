 Gateway effects and electronic cigarettes

ABSTRACT
Background
E-cigarettes are alleged to be a gateway to cigarette smoking in non-smokers. This studyexamines whether
the gateway theory has value, whether the criteria to establish causality have been met and what type of evidence is
required to test this theory
. Analysis
Experiments are impractical, and we may not be able to test properly the gateway
effects via observational studies that simply adjust for confounders. Multivariate models cannot eliminate all the variance
in propensity to smoke captured by the variable ‘vaping’ because of the proximity of these two behaviours. It may be
difficult to prove that vaping precedes smoking when product use co-occurs and when, in fact, smoking usually precedes
vaping. The gateway theory is not compatible with either (1) the decrease in smoking prevalence observed in adolescents
in countries where vaping increased or (2) an increase in smoking among teenagers after age restrictions were imposed on
e-cigarette purchases. A spurious gatewayeffect can be produced artificially by mathematical models in which a propensity
to use substances is correlated with opportunities to use substances. Finally, neither nicotine medications nor smokeless
tobacco produce gateway effects. Available data are compatible with a common liability model in which people who are
liable to use nicotine are more likely to use both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Conclusions
Despite its weaknesses and scant
empirical support, the gateway theory of smoking initiation has had enormous political influence. Policies based on this
theory will not have the intended effects if the association between vaping and smoking is explained by common liabilities.

INTRODUCTION
The gateway theory was formulated originally in the
1970s as a mix of academic, media, political and popular
explanations of the frequently observed sequence in licit
and illicit drug use [1–3]. Initially descriptive only, the the-
ory soon became predictive and causal. In particular, it was
used to support the idea that marijuana use caused heroin
use [4]. This theory has three main components: first, the
temporal sequence of substance use (adolescents first use
marijuana and then progress to using heroin); secondly,
the increased risk of subsequent use of hard drugs in mar-
ijuana users compared to non-users; and thirdly, the dose–
response relationship between the frequency or intensity of
marijuana use and the subsequent risk of starting heroin
[4]. The causal relationship was explained either because
the pharmacological effects of cannabis increased the pro-
pensity to use hard drugs: marijuana supposedly primed
the brain for heroin use; because marijuana and hard
drugs were sold on the same black markets and used in
the same peer networks, increasing the opportunities for
marijuana users to try hard drugs [5]; because of behav-
ioural and psychological mechanisms: using marijuana
supposedly reduced the perceived health and legal risks of
using hard drugs; or because the effects of marijuana raised
the users’ interest in experiencing stronger forms of intox-
ication [6]. The gateway theory has always been contro-
versial because of the difficulty of excluding alternative
explanations, in particular the likelihood that use of all
drugs is caused by some shared characteristics of users, es-
pecially a propensity to use drugs.
Today, the gateway theory is applied to e-cigarettes and
other nicotine vaporizers, as it is alleged that vaping may
cause subsequent smoking in young non-smokers. This
theory
is
used
to
justify
restrictive
regulations
of
e-cigarettes and vaporizers. For example, the European To-
bacco Products Directive states that ‘Electronic cigarettes
can develop into a gateway to nicotine addiction and ulti-
mately traditional tobacco consumption […]. For this rea-
son, it is appropriate to adopt a restrictive approach’ [7].

 This study examines whether the gateway theory has
value in the case of vaping and smoking, whether the
criteria to establish causality are met and what type of ev-
idence would be required to test this theory
.
ANALYSIS
Definitions and measures of behaviours
In order to test the theory, it is essential to define and mea-
sure vaping and smoking correctly. ‘Ever use’ of either an e-
cigarette or a tobacco cigarette is certainly not an adequate
measure in this context. It is hardly plausible that a single
puff or a few puffs on an e-cigarette can cause subsequent
regular smoking. Past 30-day use is often used as a mea-
sure of current use [8], but it is not a satisfactory measure
because in adolescents past 30-day use is a heterogeneous
category that includes both experimentation (single use),
occasional use and regular use [9,10]. Experimentation
with tobacco is certainly not what is meant by the gateway
theory. Rather, the theory is relevant only in so far as it de-
scribes mechanisms that cause the onset of regular
smoking, as only regular smoking represents a public
health problem. When it is used as an indicator of regular
use, past 30-day use inflates artificially the prevalence of
regular vaping or smoking. Conversely, because past 30-
day use includes one-time experimentation of e-cigarettes,
any observed association between past 30-day vaping and
subsequent smoking understates the true effect of regular
vaping on smoking.
Self-reports of smoking are notoriously unreliable in ad-
olescents [11], and this may also apply to self-reports of
vaping. Inaccurate reports of behaviour will produce inva-
lid studies, as even small rates of misclassification may im-
pede adjustment for confounders [12,13].
Establishing causality
The gateway theory is a theory of causality, and causality
can be examined using the framework proposed by Hill in
1965 [14]. He described nine aspects or ‘viewpoints’ that
we should consider before deciding whether an association
is causal [14]:
1 Strength of the association
2 Consistency (across trials, investigators, individuals, re-
search methods, replications)
3 Specificity (can other things cause it?)
4 Temporal precedence (do we know if cause precedes
effect?)
5 Dose responsivity
6 Plausibility (biological and psychological)
7 Coherence (consistent with other lines of evidence)
8 Experiment
9 Analogy (do similar agents act similarly?)
None of these aspects or viewpoints may be sufficient to
claim causation, but they can help us decide whether there
is any other way of explaining the data than cause and
effect.
Strength of the association
The association should have a minimal strength to estab-
lish that the link is causal. Given the imprecision of mea-
surements,
the
inevitable
confounding
effects
in
observational studies and the infrequency of regular
vaping in non-smokers [15], a small relative risk may not
be detectable. Besides, given the very low prevalence of
vaping in non-smokers [16], we should perhaps start by
building a consensus on the level of population risk above
which action is required. This level should represent a pub-
lic health problem of sufficient importance to warrant the
effort and money invested in research and interventions,
and the adverse consequences of restrictive regulations
aimed at preventing gateway effects.
Specificity (can other things cause it?)
For the gateway theory to be accepted, studies should
prove that vaping is a specific cause of smoking and should
exclude other causes, e.g. the propensity to use nicotine,
the presence of smokers among family and friends, genetic
factors, personality traits (e.g. novelty-seeking, risk-taking)
or psychiatric problems [17–19]. Proving the specificity of
this causal link is made difficult by the proximity of the
two behaviours: use of any nicotine delivery system is cor-
related inevitably with use of other nicotine delivery sys-
tems. Statistical adjustments for confounders do not
eliminate all the variability in propensity to smoke that is
captured by the variable ‘e-cigarette use’. As a result,
vaping is still likely to predict smoking in the best multivar-
iate models, even though this association may reflect com-
mon liability rather than causality [12,13]. Residual
confounding may either decrease or increase apparent ef-
fects. The unavoidable presence of residual confounding is
a very important point in this context.
Common liability theory should be considered as a
plausible alternative to the gateway hypothesis. This the-
ory states that a propensity to use nicotine influences both
vaping and smoking and so these behaviours would be cor-
related [4]. Even though the common liability theory is not
documented extensively in the case of vaping, it is appeal-
ing because it is supported by a large body of evidence
showing that smoking is determined by social, familial, in-
dividual and genetic factors [13,17,19].
Common liability theorydoes not account for the order-
ing of behaviours (first vaping, then smoking) that is re-
quired for gateway effects to occur. To account for this
phenomenon, one must hypothesize that the ordering of
2

 product use depends upon adolescents’ opportunity to use
the various products [4]. Adolescents with a liability to try
nicotine will initially use the product that is most easily
available, most heavily advertised, about which they are
most curious or for which peer pressure to use is highest.
The sequence of product use will also depend upon the
prevalence of use of each product in the population. Ado-
lescents are likely to first try the product that is used most
frequently around them [4]. This is a crucial point, because
the sequence of behaviours is a core element of the gate-
way theory
. The temporal sequence argument would not
hold if the ordering of product use was explained solely by
the ordering of opportunities to use the products, rather
than by some inherent capacity of vaping to cause
smoking.
Common liability theory can also account for the dose–
response effect, if propensity to use nicotine is associated
with more frequent use of nicotine among users. In this
case, the frequency of vaping would be associated with a
higher risk of subsequent smoking because both are con-
trolled by propensity to use nicotine.
In short, a gateway effect is not required to explain any
of the three core elements of the gateway theory: the tem-
poral ordering of behaviours, the higher relative risk of
smoking in vapers than in non-vapers and the dose–
response effect. All these phenomena can be explained by
a common liability model. In addition, the common liability
theory provides a theoretical foundation for research and
action. The gateway theory is therefore a weaker base for
prevention and policy than the common liability theory
.
For example, the common liability theory suggests that
prevention interventions should focus upon adolescents
who have risk factors for any nicotine use (e.g. parents
who smoke, psychiatric disorders, etc.) (Fig. 1).
Temporal precedence
Logically, the cause must precede the effect. Although the
ordering of the temporal sequence of events is a necessary
condition of causation, it is not a sufficient condition, be-
cause non-causal antecedence is irrelevant [20]. There
may be a period during which adolescents try various nic-
otine and tobacco products, without a clear sequence.
When product use co-occurs it is very difficult to establish
which product was used first, thus the gateway theory
can be extremely hard to test. Also, studies should assess
smoking onset, a non-repeatable event, rather than
smoking prevalence at a given time-point. This means that
longitudinal studies are required to establish the temporal
sequence; cross-sectional studies and retrospective assess-
ments
provide
very
weak evidence
for
a
gateway
hypothesis.
Plausibility
Is the gateway theory plausible? It states that there are suc-
cessive stages in adolescent involvement in substance use
[2]. Each device is supposed to be used only when this stage
is reached, even though the sequencing of behaviours ac-
tually goes in both directions and smoking usually precedes
vaping in adolescents [21]. The observation of the more
frequent reverse sequencing (first smoking, then vaping)
is a convincing argument against the gateway theory
.
In many social contexts tobacco cigarettes are omni-
present, barriers to trying them are extremely low and ad-
vertisements for cigarettes are ubiquitous and target
adolescents [22]. There is no need for a gateway or for
any other facilitator for vulnerable young people to try
smoking. In fact, in many social environments access to
cigarettes is easier than access to e-cigarettes. This con-
trasts with gateway theories for other substances, which
claim that a drug that is easy to access and use (marijuana)
facilitates access to a more dangerous drug that is either
more difficult to access or to use, or that is more frightening
(heroin). This point also decreases the plausibility of the
gateway theory
.
A central assumption of the gateway theory is that peo-
ple who choose to vape instead of smoking will change
their mind after some time and start smoking because they
think smoking has some advantages over vaping that even
the latest models of vaporizers cannot offer [20]. Such ad-
vantages may include more rapid nicotine delivery to the
brain, and thus more pleasurable effects or faster relief of
craving, the presence of other psychoactive substances in
smoke [23], the richer taste and flavour or some social ad-
vantages (e.g. giving in to social pressures to smoke or to
social pressures to stop vaping). However, we are not aware
of any studies that have documented that such elements
actually cause vapers to switch to smoking.
Another possible reason why vapers might switch to
smoking could be that e-cigarettes create an addiction to
nicotine that vaping can no longer satisfy, thereby pushing
addicted vapers to switch to smoking to obtain a satisfac-
tory nicotine supply. However, the addictive potential of
most current models of e-cigarettes is closer to that of
Figure 1 The gateway theory and common liability theory

 nicotine gum (which is not very addictive) than to the
addictiveness of tobacco cigarettes [24,25]. Logically, in-
stead of switching to smoking, unsatisfied vapers could
switch to the latest models of e-cigarettes and heated to-
bacco products that deliver substantial amounts of nicotine
and offer a range of pleasant flavours [26].
The gateway theory would be more plausible if there
were testimonials from smokers who claimed that vaping
caused them to start smoking [20]. The absence of such
testimonials in the literature weakens this theory. Testimo-
nials and other qualitative research in people who first
vaped and then switched to smoking would help re-
searchers to clarify motivations for switching, identify me-
diators and moderators of these effects and identify
vulnerable subgroups. We are not aware of any such qual-
itative studies.
In fact, it is more plausible that vaping uptake is largely
explained because smoking causes people who are already
dependent upon nicotine to look for less dangerous, more
socially acceptable and cheaper ways to obtain nicotine
[27]. This reverse causation decreases the plausibility of
the gateway theory
. It is also possible that negative gateway
effects occur; for example, if bad vaping experiences dis-
couraged youths from smoking, or if vaping made smoking
appear to be a behaviour specific to people with whom
youths do not identify (e.g. older, addicted, malodorous,
not tech-savvy people).
The gateway theory would be more plausible if data
showed that, among non-smokers, vapers who use
nicotine-containing liquids take up smoking more often
than vapers who use nicotine-free liquids, and that daily
vapers take up smoking more often than occasional vapers.
We do not know of any such evidence.
Finally, a spurious gateway effect can be produced if a
propensity to use drugs is correlated with opportunities to
use them [13]. Simulation models demonstrate that the
three core elements of the gateway theory (temporal se-
quence, increased risk and dose–response) can be produced
artificially in a situation where any causal gateway effect is
excluded by design [13]. This is a strong argument against
accepting the gateway theory
.
Coherence (consistent with other lines of evidence)
The gateway theory should not conflict with what is al-
ready known about smoking uptake in adolescents. For ex-
ample, the current decrease in smoking prevalence among
adolescents in countries where the prevalence of vaping is
high (e.g. United Kingdom, United States) suggests that
vaping is not causing many adolescents to start smoking
cigarettes [28,29]. In the United States between 2013
and 2015, smoking rates in adolescents declined faster
than ever [28] and this coincided with an increase in ex-
perimentation with e-cigarettes among adolescents during
the same period [9]. Incidentally, an increase in the preva-
lence of vaping in young non-smokers would be beneficial
if it meant that youngsters who are predisposed to smoke
chose to vape instead.
The gateway theory would also be strengthened if there
was evidence that vaping causes nicotine addiction in non-
smokers, but we are not aware of any studies to test this
hypothesis.
Experiment
Experimental studies are the best way to establish a causal
link between an intervention and an outcome because
they minimize alternative explanations, particularly con-
founding factors. In the words of Hill: ‘Here, the strongest
support for the causation hypothesis may be revealed’
[14]. Experiments of the gateway effects are impossible
for obvious ethical reasons, but trials that test the efficacy
of vaping cessation interventions on smoking uptake in
non-smokers may be feasible. It may also be possible to de-
sign social experiments, randomly allocating schools or
communities to test whether interventions aimed at
delaying the age at vaping initiation reduce smoking. How-
ever, because the effect of such interventions is expected to
be quite small if the common liability theory is correct,
then very large numbers of participants would be needed
to produce reliable results. Given that regular vaping in
never-smokers is rare [15], it will be difficult to enrol suffi-
cient numbers of participants in such trials. This suggests
that we may never be able to test the gateway theory in
randomized intervention trials in humans.
Natural experiments can also be useful to assess gate-
way effects. For instance, the use of combustible cigarettes
increased in adolescents after the implementation of age
restrictions for the purchase of e-cigarettes [30–32]. These
results suggest that there is a causal link between reduced
e-cigarettes accessibility and increased demand for com-
bustible cigarettes among minors [31]. In teenagers, there
may be an unmet demand for cigarette substitution prod-
ucts that e-cigarettes may fill [32]. This possibility is, of
course, contrary to the gateway theory
. More generally,
new regulations represent natural experiments that can
be used to test the gateway theory empirically at the popu-
lation level.
In animals, experiments on the effects of exposure to
e-cigarette aerosols on subsequent compulsive nicotine
self-administration could be useful [33,34] if the dosages
used in animals reasonably reflect the dosages used by
e-cigarette users.

The gateway theory would be strengthened by the obser-
vation that other nicotine-delivery systems also cause

 smoking. A few cases of addiction to nicotine gum in never-
users of tobacco have been described [35], but we know of
no example of never-users of tobacco who became addicted
to nicotine medications and started smoking later to satisfy
this addiction [36]. Smokeless tobacco products also deliver
substantial doses of nicotine [37], are addictive [38] and
some users have never smoked cigarettes before using
smokeless products [39], but smokeless tobacco use does
not appear to cause subsequent smoking [40,41]. Rather,
smokeless tobacco use is associated with low rates of
smoking and with lower overall tobacco use in populations
in which their use is legal [42,43]. However, the
addictiveness of a drug-delivery device depends upon the
speed of nicotine delivery to the blood and brain [44],
and recent models of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco de-
liver nicotine more quickly than most forms of smokeless
tobacco,
nicotine
medications
and
most
current
e-cigarettes [26,45]. They could therefore be more
addictive than these products.
Comprehensive models: explaining the total effects on
public health
Any satisfactory model of the effects of vaping on smoking
should consider transitions from smoking to vaping and
not just from vaping to smoking. Exit gateways should also
be considered because population surveys suggest that e-
cigarettes are used almost exclusively by current and for-
mer smokers as an aid to quit smoking [16,27]. We also
need to examine the effects of dual (concomitant) use of
e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes [46]. Transitions
from experimentation to regular vaping are also of interest,
as e-cigarettes can be protective if people who experiment
with vaping later make a transition to regular vaping
rather than to regular smoking [46].
Even if new nicotine delivery devices caused some
young non-users to start smoking, the total effect on the
population overall would still be positive if large numbers
of current smokers switched to newer, less dangerous de-
vices (e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products) [46] or if
dual users smoked for fewer years or smoked fewer ciga-
rettes per day or both. Given the preliminary evidence from
randomized trials [47,48] and population studies [49], and
given the analogy with nicotine medications [50], it is a
reasonable hypothesis that e-cigarettes help some smokers
to quit [15,51]. In countries where smoking-related mor-
tality is high, levels of gateway effects from vaping to
smoking would need to be extremely high to offset the pos-
itive effects of vaping on smoking cessation [46].
DISCUSSION
In summary, most of the evidence that should be consid-
ered before deciding whether an association is causal have
either not been met or are not documented in the case of
the claim that e-cigarettes can be a cause of cigarette
smoking (Table 1).
The gateway hypothesis cannot currently be either ac-
cepted or confidently refuted because the evidence for it is
scarce and inconclusive. The common liability theory can-
not be accepted confidently either, because it has not been
tested extensively in the case of vaping and smoking. A
gateway effect may exist because vaping familiarizes vapers
with the gestures and feelings of inhalation and with the
use of nicotine, even though many adolescent vapers re-
port using non-nicotine refill liquids [52,53]. It is unlikely,
although not impossible, that vaping non-nicotine liquids
can lead to subsequent smoking in some people. Vaping
may also increase the risk of smoking for some adolescents
and decrease it for others, so that the net effect on popula-
tion cigarette smoking is trivial. Even if there was a gate-
way effect, it may explain only a small part of smoking,
compared to common vulnerabilities.
Even if gateway effects may not currently be very sub-
stantial or even detectable, this could change in future if
vaping became more prevalent or future e-cigarette models
became much more addictive than current models. This
could increase
opportunities
for
adolescents
to
try
e-cigarettes before they try combustible cigarettes and
may increase the risk of becoming addicted.
To choose between the alternative explanations of the
gateway and common liability hypotheses, we should look
for convergent evidence from a variety of sources and study
types. Progress in understanding the association between
vaping and smoking will be faster if social scientists, econ-
omists, psychologists, epidemiologists and behavioural
pharmacologists collaborate. Useful studies would include:
• Experiments in animals to assess whether exposure to
doses of vapour that reflect human behaviour cause
compulsive nicotine self-administration.
• Behaviour genetic studies that test the relative roles of
genes and environment in e-cigarette use and smoking,
in particular studies of twins discordant for smoking
and vaping.
• Large intervention studies that test the impact of policies
and education interventions to determine whether
delaying the age at first e-cigarette use reduces smoking
initiation rates.
• Randomized trials in daily vapers who are non-smokers,
to test whether vaping cessation interventions reduce
their risk of subsequent smoking initiation.
• Studies of the effects of regulations on vaping and
smoking in youths (natural experiments).
• Large longitudinal epidemiological studies that measure
behaviours and confounders precisely and repeatedly
and that assess their temporal relationship. These studies
should control adequately for confounders and assess the
onset of smoking, a non-repeatable event that is the

 focus of the gateway theory. Analyses of the frequency of
smoking at one time-point or at several time-points do
not address the relevant question.
• Studies based on propensity scoring that test whether
vaping predicts smoking over and above a propensity
score measure of liability to smoke. This approach has
been used to assess whether smokeless tobacco is a gate-
way to smoking [40].
• In contrast, there is little need for more (highly publi-
cized) studies of antecedence combined with increased
relative risk [54,55]. While this approach reduces the
possibility of reverse causation, it does not eliminate con-
founding, even after statistical adjustments.
• Finally, there are rapid changes in vaping prevalence, in
the evolution of vaping technologies, and in commercial
marketing strategies that may affect the likelihood of
gateway effects in the future. It is therefore important
to continue population monitoring and surveillance of
changes in vaping and smoking behaviours.
Despite its theoretical limitations, the scarcity of empir-
ical support and evidence for the opposite effects, the gate-
way theory has enormous political influence [1,7]. Its
success is due perhaps to its simplicity. Policies based on
this theory may not have the intended impact on smoking,
and may even exert negative effects, if the association be-
tween vaping and smoking is explained by common liabili-
ties. If access to safer alternatives to combustible cigarettes
is excessively restricted because of this theory, then more
people are going to smoke instead of using these disruptive
alternative technologies.
