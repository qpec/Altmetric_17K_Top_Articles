Introduction
With an estimated 42.1 million cigarette smokers in the
United States, leading to 480,000 deaths annually, smoking
is a major public health concern.1 Although the cardiovascu-
lar and respiratory complications are well documented, an
emerging body of literature suggests that tobacco addiction
predisposes users to an increased incidence of postoperative
complications in most surgical disciplines. Of particular
interest to the practicing spine surgeon are the increased
risks of nonunion, postoperative wound complications, and
diminishment of both objective and subjective postoperative
outcomes. The purpose of this article is to detail the effects of
tobacco use and cessation on spine surgery within the current
medical literature.
Arthrodesis
Smoking increases the risk of nonunion in both lumbar and
cervical spine procedures.2–9 Though the mechanism of
tobacco-related inhibition on bony fusion is not completely
understood, the three most commonly accepted theories for
the phenomena include a decrease in systemic bone mineral
density, osteoblastic cellular metabolism, and local blood
flow and angiogenesis.10 In combination, these negative
effects create a challenging fusion environment that has

Literature review.
Objective
The aim of this literature review was to detail the effects of smoking in spine
surgery and examine whether perioperative smoking cessation could mitigate these
risks.
Methods
A review of the relevant literature examining the effects of smoking and
cessation on surgery was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane
databases.
Results
Current smokers are significantly more likely to experience pseudarthrosis and
postoperative infection and to report lower clinical outcomes after surgery in both the
cervical and lumbar spines. Smoking cessation can reduce the risks of these compli-
cations depending on both the duration and timing of tobacco abstinence.
Conclusion
Smoking negatively affects both the objective and subjective outcomes of
surgery in the lumbar and cervical spine. Current literature supports smoking cessation
as an effective tool in potentially mitigating these unwanted outcomes. Future
investigations in this field should be directed toward developing a better understanding
of the complex relationship between smoking and poorer outcomes in spine surgery as
well as developing more efficacious cessation strategies.

 been documented by numerous investigators in both human
and animal studies.
Multiple animal models have demonstrated a correlation
between nicotine exposure and diminished bone heal-
ing.11–13 In a study examining single-level posterior lateral
lumbar fusion in New Zealand white rabbits, Silcox et al
reported significantly higher rates of fusion in control speci-
mens than those exposed to systemic nicotine (56 versus 0%,
p ¼ 0.02).11 Additionally, the bone formed in specimens
exposed to nicotine exhibited significantly less relative fusion
strength and stiffness than bone formed in the control
population.11 In a contradictory rabbit study, Daffner et al
reported increased fusion rates and enhanced biomechanical
bone quality in subjects with continual low-dose nicotine
exposure (5.25-mg patch).14 Interestingly, the specimens
exposed to higher doses of nicotine (10.5 and 21 mg) did
not demonstrate higher fusion rates than controls.14 The
contradiction in these similar studies demonstrate the com-
plex and possibly dose-dependent effect nicotine plays in
spinal fusion and may suggest that other chemicals contained
in cigarette smoke play a role in the inhibition of spinal fusion
seen in human studies.14,15
Lumbar Spine
Multiple investigators have reported cigarette use as a major
independent risk factor for the development of a lumbar
pseudarthrosis (►Table 1).2–6 In a review of 357 patients
undergoing one- or two-level lumbar fusion, Glassman et al
reported a statistically significant increased risk of nonunion
in smokers (26.5 versus 14.2%, p < 0.05).6 This higher
observed rate of nonunion in smokers may be influenced
by both the amount smoked per day and the number of levels
fused.4,5 In a case series of 426 patients, Andersen et al
reported a nonunion rate of 18.2% in individuals using
more than 10 cigarettes per day compared with a 9.8 and
8.9% rate of pseudarthrosis, respectively, in people who
smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes per day and nonsmokers
(odds ratio [OR] 2.01, p < 0.016).4 In a similar review of 281
patients undergoing one- or two-level lumbar fusion, Bydon
et al found no significant difference in the rate of nonunion
between smokers and nonsmokers in single-level procedures
(7.69 versus 9.82%, p ¼ 0.738).5 However, when analyzing
two-level procedures, smokers had a significantly higher rate
of nonunion than their nonsmoking counterparts (10.92
versus 29.17%, p ¼ 0.019).5 In combination, the results of
these studies seem to suggest that the risk of lumbar pseu-
darthrosis associated with cigarette use is multifactorial and
at least partially dependent upon the number of cigarettes
consumed daily as well as the number of levels fused.
Cervical Spine
Although the effects of cigarette use may be less detrimen-
tal in cervical fusion than lumbar procedures,10,16,17
multiple investigators have demonstrated a link between
smoking and cervical nonunion (►Table 2).7–9 In a retro-
spective review of 132 patients who underwent anterior
cervical diskectomy and fusion, Bishop et al reported a
nonunion rate of 14% in smokers compared with 0% in
smokers.7 Additionally, the investigators noted significant-
ly higher rates of delayed union, greater disk space collapse,
and diminishment of the disk angle in the smoking popu-
lation.7 Although two large retrospective reviews by An et
al and Bohlman et al both demonstrated trends toward
higher rates of pseudarthrosis in smokers undergoing
anterior cervical interbody fusion, neither reached statis-
tical significance.18,19 However, it should be noted that in
each of these studies �50% of patients had a single-level
fusion. Similarly, in a population of 573 patients undergo-
ing single-level anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion
with allograft bone and rigid fixation, Luszczyk et al
reported no significant difference in the fusion rates among
smokers and nonsmokers.20 In an attempt to determine the
effects of smoking on 131 multilevel anterior cervical
interbody fusions, Hilibrand et al reported a significantly
higher
fusion
rate
in
nonsmokers
(76

 suggest that the negative effects of smoking pose a greater
risk of nonunion in patients undergoing multilevel inter-
body cervical fusion than those undergoing single-level
procedures.
Smoking’s effect on fusion rates in individuals undergo-
ing multilevel fusion through an anterior cervical corpec-
tomy or a posterior cervical fusion may not be as profound.
In a review of 59 patients undergoing corpectomy and strut
grafting, Hilibrand and colleagues reported identical rates
of fusion between smokers and nonsmokers (93%).21 How-
ever, in a study of 132 patients undergoing cervical corpec-
tomy, Lau et al reported pseudarthrosis rates of 16% in
smokers versus 4.3% in nonsmokers at 1 year.22 Although
this difference failed to reach statistical significance, a
possible explanation for the trends toward higher rates of
pseudarthrosis may be that the average follow-up for this
investigation was only 1 year after surgery as opposed to
the 2-year period used in the Hilibrand review. This shorter
follow-up may be significant; at least two investigators
have reported that smoking decreases the rate of fusion
even in individuals who ultimately develop a stable
union.7,17 In a retrospective case series of 158 patients
undergoing posterior cervical fusion with lateral mass
screw fixation, Eubanks et al noted identical fusion rates
among smokers and nonsmokers (100%).23 The results of
these investigations seem to suggest that in patients who
smoke with multiple-level pathology, considering corpec-
tomy or posterior-based procedures when appropriate may
provide higher fusion rates than performing multiple-level
anterior interbody fusions.
Clinical Outcome Measures
Multiple investigators have reported a correlation between
smoking and diminished clinical outcomes with both opera-
tive
and
nonoperative
treatment
for
spinal
condi-
tions.6,21,23–26 Although increases in surgical complications
such as pseudarthrosis and infection undoubtedly contribute
to the diminished postoperative results seen in the smoking
population, the systemic effects of nicotine are likely also
significant.6,23,27 One of the documented effects of smoking is
increased rates of disk degeneration in both the cervical and
lumbar spine.27–29 The most commonly proposed mechanism
for this phenomenon is that smoking decreases the blood
flow to the disk tissue, which leads to decreased cellular
metabolism within the intervertebral disk tissue and earlier
disk degeneration.29,30 This process likely continues into the
postoperative period, potentially predisposing cigarette users
to increased rates of recurrent pathologic changes at the
operated levels and adjacent-level disease. This smoking-
related disk degeneration provides a likely explanation for
the higher rates of recurrent or adjacent-level disease requir-
ing reoperation observed in numerous studies.31–35 Nicotine
is also a central pain-modulating agent and individuals with
higher rates and intensity of spine-related pain may be
predisposed to addiction to help mitigate their symp-
toms.6,36–38 Finally, the higher incidence of depression among
smokers predisposes this population to increased back-relat-
ed disability, which could negatively affect postoperative
outcome measures.6,39,40 The combination of these factors
likely contributes to the differences between smokers and

 nonsmokers in clinical outcomes with both operative and
nonoperative treatment of spinal pathology.
Lumbar Spine
Multiple investigators have demonstrated an association
between smoking and worse clinical outcome measures
and return to work rates in individuals undergoing lumbar
spine procedures.6,24,30,41 In a review of 825 patients under-
going microdecompression for degenerative lumbar stenosis,
Gulati et al noted a significant difference in Oswestry Disabil-
ity Index (ODI) score change from the preoperative baseline
levels in smokers versus nonsmokers (4.2 points, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 0.98 to 7.34, p ¼ 0.01).41 In this study,
smokers were also significantly less likely to have achieved a
minimal clinically important difference in ODI scores 1 year
after
surgery
than
nonsmokers
(60.8
versus
69.6%,
p ¼ 0.008).41 From a review of the Swedish Spine Register
examining 4,555 patients who underwent decompression
with or without fusion for lumbar stenosis, Sandén et al
demonstrated that active smokers were more likely to report
dissatisfaction with their outcome 2 years after the operative
intervention (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.12).30 In addition,
smokers were more likely to continue to require regular
analgesic use (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.23) and were
significantly less likely to improve their walking ability after
surgery (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.82).30 Additionally, smokers
also demonstrated worse preoperative ODI, EuroQol, and
Short Form-36 health survey scores and lower return to
work rates than their nonsmoking counterparts.30 Similarly,
in a subgroup analysis of the Spine Patient Outcomes
Research Trial (SPORT), Pearson et al found that in patients
treated for lumbar spinal stenosis, smokers were the only
subgroup (of 53 analyzed) in whom the treatment effect of
operative management was not significantly different than
nonoperative treatment.24 In this investigation, the treat-
ment effect (measured using the ODI) for smokers was �1.6
compared with �11.7 for nonsmokers (p < 0.001).24 Because
all of the patients in the Gulati study and the majority of the
patients in both the SPORT study and the Swedish Spine
Register had decompressive surgery without fusion, the
results of these studies indicate that smoking is associated
with poor results even in the patient populations not under-
going fusion procedures.24 This data suggests that the dimin-
ished postoperative outcomes after surgery seen in the
smoking population is not entirely attributable to higher
rates of nonunion.
Smoking has also been correlated to worse surgical outcomes
and lower return to work rates in procedures involving lumbar
fusion. Glassman et al reported significantly higher return to
work rates (71 versus 53%, p < 0.001) and mean patient satis-
faction scores (2.47 versus 2.78, p < 0.05) in nonsmokers at an
average of 49.4 months after surgery.6 In a prospective cohort
study, smokers also noted lessreliefof their preoperativeleg pain
1 year after undergoing lumbar decompression and instru-
mented fusion.42 In lumbar spine procedures, regardless of
whether a decompression was used alone or with fusion, a
pattern of worse surgical outcomes in smokers undergoing
surgery seems to prevail in most of the published literature.
Cervical Spine
In cervical spine procedures, smokers appear more likely to
experience a suboptimal clinical outcome than nonsmokers
irrespective of the approach employed. Hilibrand et al noted
significantly higher rates of excellent or good functional
outcomes in nonsmokers undergoing multilevel anterior
cervical diskectomy and fusion compared with nonsmokers
(89 versus 72.5%, p < 0.02) at 2 years after surgery.21 The
authors attributed these differences primarily to the higher
incidence of nonunion observed in the smoking population.
Eubanks et al reported a similar diminishment in desired
outcomes of patients undergoing posterior cervical decom-
pression and fusion.23 In this review, smokers were five times
more likely to report fair or poor results (Odom criteria grade
3 or 4) at an average follow-up of 14.5 months.23 In a
prospective cohort study of 278 individuals undergoing
surgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy,
Tetreault et al found that smokers were significantly less
likely to experience a successful outcome than nonsmokers,
defined by a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association
score �16 at 1 year after surgery.43 In both the study by
Eubanks et al and the study by Tetreault et al, fusion rates
were equivalent between smokers and nonsmokers, suggest-
ing that factors other than higher rates of pseudarthrosis
likely contribute to the diminished postoperative outcomes
seen in smokers.
Postoperative Infection
Postoperative infection represents one of the greatest fears
for the practicing spine surgeon due to its association with
increased costs, longer hospitalization times, and higher rates
of secondary surgeries and nonunion.44–48 Tobacco use in-
creases the risk of wound complications and infection by
creating a temporary reduction in tissue oxygenation and
blood flow and decreasing the effectiveness of inflammatory
cell function and oxidative bactericidal mechanisms; in addi-
tion, reparative cell function is inhibited.49 Researchers from
multiple surgical disciplines have correlated smoking with
higher rates of wound complications and infections.49–55
More specifically, these effects have been illustrated in spine
surgery by multiple investigators (►Table 3).47,48,54,55 In a

 Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, Veeravagu
et al reported that smokers had a statistically significant
higher rate of infection than nonsmokers (OR 1.19, 95% CI
1.02 to 1.37).47 In a retrospective review of 1,629 procedures,
Fang et al reported a postoperative infection rate of 4.4%.48 In
this study, smokers represented 33% of the population who
developed infections compared with only 16.8% of those who
healed uneventfully (p ¼ 0.03).48 The results of these large
retrospective reviews point to tobacco use as a significant
potentially modifiable risk factor for the development of
postoperative infection in spine surgery.
Smoking Cessation
The overall health benefits related to smoking cessation are
well documented and include decreased risks of multiple
types of primary malignancies, coronary and peripheral
arterial disease, respiratory infection, cerebral vascular acci-
dent, and chronic pulmonary disease.56–59 Similarly, multiple
investigators have reported significant benefits associated
with tobacco cessation in patients undergoing spine surgery.
In a retrospective analysis of 86 patients with documented
nonunion at 88 levels, Carpenter et al noted that smoking
cessation significantly affected patient outcome scores on a
questionnaire that addressed pain, functional status, progress
after the surgery, and postoperative satisfaction.60 In this
study, individuals who successfully stopped smoking scored
65/100 and patients who continued smoking scored 45/100
(p ¼ 0.03).60 The investigators also noted a significantly
greater likelihood of returning to full-time work in patients
who stopped smoking.60 In a retrospective analysis contain-
ing 188 smokers, Glassman et al also demonstrated more
favorable outcomes in patients who quit smoking postopera-
tively.6 Within this population, the investigators noted non-
union in 26.5% (18/68) of patients who did not stop smoking
after surgery compared with 18.2% (8/44) and 17.1% of
patients who stopped smoking 1 to 6 months and greater
than 6 months after surgery, respectively.6 Individuals who
were able to stop smoking for longer periods of time after
surgery also had higher rates of return to either full or light
duty. Nonquitters returned to work at a rate of 53.4% and
those who abstained 1 to 6 months and greater than 6 months
after surgery returned to work at rates of 58.6 and 74.6%,
respectively.6 The differences in return to work rates in non-
quitters and patients who quit smoking for up to 6 months
reached statistical significance (p < 0.005). Postoperative
patient
satisfaction
also
demonstrated
trends
toward
improvement with the ability to quit smoking after surgery.
The reported satisfaction score for nonquitters was 3.03
compared with scores of 2.64 and 2.63 in patients who quit
smoking for longer than 1 month or greater than 6 months,
respectively.6 The differences in patient satisfaction and
return towork rates remained present after cases of nonunion
were excluded, indicating that higher rates of pseudarthrosis
in nonquitters does not fully explain the discrepancies in
postoperative outcomes.
When to quit and how long to refrain from smoking are
important questions for the practicing clinician to answer
when advising patients considering elective spine surgery.
Although there is no definitive data, several investigators
have provided meaningful information on which to base
recommendations.
Glassman
et
al
noted
significant
improvements in fusion rates, satisfaction scores, and
return to work rates in patients who refrained from smok-
ing postoperatively,6 with results tending to be better in
individuals who quit for more than 6 months after surgery.6
Interestingly, preoperative smoking cessation did not
significantly alter the postoperative outcomes.6 Notably,
the investigators found no association between preopera-
tive smoking cessation and fusion rates, satisfaction scores,
or return to work rates.6 Despite these findings, preopera-
tive smoking cessation for 4 weeks is associated with a
decreased risk of infection, perioperative respiratory, and
wound complications.49,61,62 In a meta-analysis of studies
from a range of surgical specialties, Mills et al reported a
41% risk reduction of postoperative complications for
patients who quit smoking before surgery.63 Within the
studies analyzed, trials that consisted of smoking cessation
for 4 weeks or greater had a significantly larger treatment
effect than those investigating shorter periods of absti-
nence from tobacco.63 A patient’s ability to stop smoking
preoperatively may also be an important predictor of their
ability to refrain from smoking after surgery.6 To this end,
Glassman et al noted that less than 10% of patients
who smoked up until the day of surgery were able to
stop postoperatively.6 As a result of these findings in our
own practice, we request patients be free of tobacco
4 weeks before undergoing elective spine surgery and
continue to refrain from smoking for 6 months after
surgery.
With reported success rates as low as 8 to 27.5% in the
general population,64–66 many spine surgeons are skeptical
of a patient’s ability to reliably quit smoking around the
time of surgery.67 In a retrospective review of 426 patients
who underwent lumbar fusion, Andersen et al noted that
only 13% of patients were able to stop smoking after
surgery with counseling alone.4 Of the individuals who
did quit, 50% experienced a relapse at some point during
their postoperative course.4 Although these abysmal rates
of success lead some to question the value of time invested
in tobacco cessation attempts, conflicting evidence sug-
gests that patients preparing for elective spine procedures
may quit at higher rates than the general smoking popula-
tion. To this end, Glassman et al reported that 63.8% of
smokers quit for at least 1 to 6 months and 40.4% quit for at
least 6 months after surgery.6 Impressively, 90% of this
population did not need the aid of nicotine-containing
gums or patches or other medications.6 These findings
may indicate that individuals considering spine surgery
represent a portion of the population more likely to quit if
counseled appropriately on the risk of continuing to smoke
in the postoperative period. However, given the conflicting
data of the efficacy of counseling alone, physicians should
consider offering any of the host of validated cessation aids
in conjunction with preoperative patient education to
maximize the success rate.

 Conclusion
Due to its association with higher rates of postoperative
infection and pseudarthrosis and lower clinical outcome
measures, smoking presents a major challenge to the practic-
ing spine surgeon. Fortunately, these risks appear to be
mitigated to some extent with tobacco cessation in the
perioperative period. As a result, surgeons should counsel
smokers on their elevated risk prior to surgery and assist in
the development of a comprehensive cessation program that
ideally would start at least 4 weeks prior to surgery and
continue 6 months postoperatively. Future investigations in
this field should be directed toward developing a better
understanding of the complex relationship between smoking
and its effect on individuals undergoing spine surgery as well
as the development of more efficacious cessation strategies.
