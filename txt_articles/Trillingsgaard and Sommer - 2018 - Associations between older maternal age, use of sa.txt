Abstract 
In developed countries more women are giving birth later in life and this trend has 
been linked with perinatal medical risks as well as with improved psychosocial 
adaptation. This study examined whether older maternal age was associated with 
less use of sanctions and with positive child outcome at age 7, 11, and 15. A 
random population sample of 4741 mothers from the Danish Longitudinal Survey 
of Children was used. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews and 
self-report questionnaires. Older maternal age was associated with less frequent 
use of verbal and physical sanctions towards children at age 7 and 11. At age 15 
this association remained significant for verbal sanctions but not physical 
sanctions. Older maternal age was associated with fewer behavioral, social and 
emotional difficulties in children at age 7 and at age 11 but not at age 15. The 
associations reported were significant independently of all observed demographic 
and socioeconomic characteristics.

Associations between Older Maternal Age, Use of Sanctions, 
and Children’s Socio-Emotional Development through 7, 11, and 15 Years  
Developed countries are witnessing a marked change in the pattern of childbearing as increasing 
numbers of women postpone childbearing until their 30s and 40s. This demographic trend has been 
attributed to several reasons, such as longer life span, greater accessibility to education and career 
opportunities for women, and the existence of effective means of birth control (Dencik, Jørgensen 
& Sommer, 2008). With Denmark as one example, the mean childbearing age has been steadily 
increasing since the 1970s, and reached 30.9 years in 2015, the highest since the advent of modern 
contraception (Statistics Denmark, 2016, March 29). As follows from these statistics, the majority 
of Danish children are now born to women who passed 30 years of age and the proportion of 
children born to mothers aged 40 or above has quadrupled since 1985. 
Older maternal age is associated with increased risk of complications during pregnancy 
and childbirth, and these risk factors have been extensively researched (for a review, see Carolan & 
Frankowska, 2011). Among established findings are that older mothers more frequently experience 
the requirement of assisted reproductive technologies, and have higher risk of abortion, preterm 
labor, fetal malformation, and maternal cardio metabolic disease (Cavazos-Rehg, Krauss, 
Spitznagel, Bommarito, Madden, Olsen & Bierut, 2015; Kenny, Lavender, McNamee, O'Neill, 
Mills & Khashan, 2013; Schmidt, Sobotka, Bentzen, Andersen & ESHRE Reproduction and 
Society Task Force, 2012).  
Unlike perinatal medical risks, the risk of maternal psychopathology during the 
postpartum period has been found to decrease with older maternal age (Bottino, Nadanovsky, 
Moraes, Reichenheim & Lobato, 2012). With a few notable exceptions (see Bornstein, Putnick,

Suwalsky, & Gini, 2006), empirical studies generally find adaptive benefits of older maternal age 
when examining psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, such as lower levels of 
pregnancy worry (Trillingsgaard, Elklit, Shevlin & Maimburg, 2011) more positive affect towards 
parenting (Sommer, 2001), and more positive parenting behaviors (Ragozin, Basham, Crnic, 
Greenberg & Robinson, 1982). An important question relates to whether or not the apparent early 
adaptive benefits of older maternal age continues to have positive influence on psychosocial aspects 
of parenting and child development beyond the transition to parenthood.   
Several socioeconomic and demographic factors may confound conclusions drawn in 
studies on the effect of age on parenting and child outcome. First, mothers who postpone 
childbearing are generally more educated than their counterparts (Schmidt et al., 2012) and 
educational attainment is linked to better child health and a number of parenting-related behaviors 
(Currie & Moretti, 2003). Second, a secure employment status may characterize older mothers and 
this can affect child outcome through increased access to material and social resources (Bradley & 
Corwyn, 2002). Third, older mothers are likely to enter parenthood more settled in terms of a stable 
marital relationship, and there are known associates between the marital relationship and child 
development (Cummings & Davies, 1994). Whereas many studies report on association between 
maternal age and demographics such as education, employment, or marital status, few statistically 
control for all of them, clarifying what proportion of variance that can be explained by age in and of 
itself. 
There are, however, interesting theoretical arguments for doing statistical analyses on 
the effect of age on psychosocial functioning. Older maternal age may be conceived of as a proxy 
for personal maturity (Camberis, McMahon, Gibson, & Boivin, 2014). Personal development and 
growth bring a multitude of benefits including greater psychological flexibility and personality

integration (Manners & Durkin, 2001; Mercer, 1986), more positive overall emotional well-being, 
greater emotional stability, and greater tolerance for complexity in emotional experience 
(Carstensen et al., 2011). Older adults also tend to be more forgiving (Cheng & Yim, 2008) and 
older mothers report more psychological hardiness, which again is linked with responsive infant 
parenting (Camberis, McMahon, Gibson, & Boivin, 2015; 2016).  
Among these findings, there are several indices that older maternal age may not only 
favor the early emotional adaptation of the mothers, but also their style of parenting which influence 
the long-term environment for the children’s emotional and behavioral development. When more 
mature psychological resources are available to older mothers, they may tend to adopt a more 
authoritative parenting style, described by Baumrind as balancing freedom and control (Baumrind, 
2013). Authoritative parents use functional control (e.g. impose goal oriented maturity demands) 
but avoid the use of coercive power assertion such as verbal sanctions, physical sanctions, and 
arbitrary discipline (Baumrind, 2013; Sorkhabi, 2013). Low use of sanctions represent one aspect of 
authoritative parenting that may contribute positively to the socioemotional family environment 
and, ultimately, to positive child development outcome (Bornstein et al., 2006).  
Three recent studies provide the first empirical support for the maturity assumption, 
holding all potential confounding variables constant in analyses. First, Barnes, Gardiner, Sutcliffe, 
and Melhuish (2014) examined the link between older maternal age and parenting behaviors of 3-
year-olds in two national UK cohorts, and found that although both younger and older mothers had 
high levels of household chaos, other effects of older age were beneficial. They found a linear 
decrease in both  parent-child conflict and negative parenting with increasing maternal age. The 
association with use of harsh discipline was curvilinear, being low for teenage mother, highest for 
mothers in their mid-twenties, and then declining to its’ lowest level after 40. Positive and

responsive parenting increased until age 40 and then leveled off. Second, including data from the 
same cohorts at both 9 months, 3 years, and 5 years, Sutcliffe, Barnes, Belsky, Gardiner, and 
Melhuish (2012) found that child health and developmental outcomes were more advantageous for 
children born to older mothers. Specifically, Sutcliffe and colleagues reported improved vocabulary 
and fewer behavioral, social, and emotional difficulties in children of 3 and 5 years of age. They 
also found lowered risk of unintentional injury, admission to hospital, and non-immunization in 
children of 9 months and 3 years of age. In this study, the association between maternal age and 
child behavioral, social, and emotional difficulties were linear at child age 5 and curvilinear at child 
age 3 with the benefit of maternal age leveling off after age 40. Third, Schlomer and Belsky (2012) 
examined longitudinal family data from a national US cohort and found that older maternal age 
(and stable romantic relationships) was related to maternal sensitivity toward the child at age 10 
which again was related to the child’s perceptions of maternal hostility at age 15. Schlomer and 
Belsky drew on evolutionary theory to interpret these findings and they suggested that maternal 
older age aligns with a shift in reproductive strategy from investing in future reproduction (new 
partners, new children) to investing in extant offspring (spending more time and energy on existing 
children). At the same time, data from their study also align with the maturity hypothesis, and in 
this regard point toward potential effects of older maternal age on child and parenting outcome well 
beyond the preschool years. 
As authors of some of the mentioned studies suggest, research on psychosocial aspects 
of child development may end up finding that the advantages of older parents eventually outweigh 
the biological risks (Barnes et al., 2014). Yet, as of today research on age effects on parenting and 
child development beyond the child’s fifth year is sparce. While developmental theory suggests that 
early gains (and losses) with regard to psychosocial functioning will likely have far-reaching

implications (Main, Hesse & Kaplan, 2005; Sroufe, Egeland, Carlson & Collins, 2005), the 
possibility exists that some disadvantages of older maternal age (such as the reductions of physical 
well-being and health) catch up with families as the mothers age. Younger mothers may have more 
energy and they gain the maturity of older mothers as the children grow. If, for instance, older 
mothers experience some reductionsin parenting resources (e.g. energy, health) as they and their 
children age, this could alter the association between older maternal age and child outcome during 
the course of mid or late childhood. 
In this study, we tested the overall assumption that older maternal age is associated with 
improved psychosocial health in families beyond the preschool years. In particular, we 
hypothesized that older maternal age would be associated with less use of sanctions in verbal and 
physical discipline and with positive child socio-emotional development at age 7, 11 and 15. We 
also hypothesized that older maternal age would be associated with fewer contacts to obtain non-
normative family benefits through social services. Older maternal age is variously defined in other 
research. In this study we examined age as a continuous variable to allow investigation of linear and 
non-linear age trends. Hypothetically, with maternal age as the independent variable and parenting 
and child outcome as dependent variable, the association may be either a) a positive linear 
relationship (e.g. constant advantages of older maternal age), b) a curvilinear or otherwise non-
linear relationship (e.g. advantage of older maternal age that levels off after any particular age) or c) 
no relationship. Previous studies have found evidence of all three possible relations in early 
childhood depending on the specific outcome (Bornstein et al., 2006; Bornstein & Putnick, 2007; 
Ragozin et al., 1982; Sutcliffe et al., 2012). We chose an exploratory approach to the question of 
whether the tested associations would form linear or curvilinear relationships.

Methods 
Participants 
The study included participants from the Danish Longitudinal Survey of Children (DALSC). This 
survey was designed by researchers from SFI (the Danish National Centre for Social Research), in 
cooperation with researchers from other research institutions, among these the last author. In 1995, 
a representative sample of 6000 children was randomly recruited through registers of all Danish 
births. Children were eligible for the DALSC if born between March 15 and October 31 in 1995 and 
if their mother had a Danish citizenship (for full description of methodology see SFI, 1997). 
Children placed immediately in foster care were excluded, but children placed in care at later time 
points remained in the study (note that in these cases the number of children in the household can 
equal zero). The children were 5-6 months of age at recruitment and were followed through 3 years, 
7 years, 11 years, and 15 years. For this study we used the latter three data points. The mean child 
bearing age of mothers was 30.4 (SD = 4.6) and ranged from 17 to 47.  
Data collection 
Data were collected by SFI using trained interviewers in full face-to-face structured interview in the 
respondent’s home at all-time points except the latest (15 years), at which data were collected 
through either online or mailed self-report questionnaires. All data from this study were based on 
maternal response. Mothers were allowed to drop-out from the study both temporarily and 
permanently. If, for instance, a family moved abroad and returned, this family dropped out and then 
re-entered the sample.

A large number of measures in brief formats were included in the DALSC study. To be able to 
benchmark current findings with those of Sutcliffe et al. (2012), this study includes outcome and 
control variables that were either identical with, or closest possible proxy to the measures in the 
previous study. 
Maternal childbearing age was calculated by subtracting the birth date of the mother 
from the birth date of the child. This age variable is distinct from maternal study age, which was 
reported at each data point. Maternal childbearing age was entered in models as a continuous 
variable. 
Child behavioral, social and emotional difficulties were assessed with the Strengths 
and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997). The SDQ is a behavioral screening 
questionnaire including 25 items that are applicable for parental report on children of 4-16 years of 
age.  Scores are obtained within the following areas (1) emotional symptoms (5 items), (2) conduct 
problems (5 items), (3) hyperactivity/inattention (5 items), (4) peer relationship problems (5 items), 
(5) prosocial behavior (5 items). For the current report, we used the total difficulties subscale which 
is generated as a sum score of the scales 1-4 with higher scores indicating more behavioral, social 
and emotional difficulties. On this subscale, chronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.80 – 0.82 
in the current study. 
Parental use of sanctions was assessed with a list of commonly used sanctions (SFI, 
1997; Sommer, 2010). During the 7-year interview, mothers were asked how often (never, rarely, 
once a week) they used each of four verbal and four physical strategies to teach the child right from 
wrong. The list of verbal sanctions included “tell the child, that he/she did something wrong”, 
“scold”, “send to bedroom or ground child” and “take away privileges or rewards”. The list of 
physical sanctions included “grabbed child or shook child”, “slapped child on face”, “slapped child

on hand” and “spanked child on the bottom”. The items on verbal sanction parallel the domain of 
non-violent discipline used in the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale whereas the four physical 
sanctions parallel the most common items classified as minor physical assault (CTSPC; Straus, 
Hamby, Finkelhor, Moore & Runyan, 1998). The list of sanctions was used at the 7, 11, and 15 
years data collection with some adaptations to match the age of the children (e.g. the item “send 
your child to bedroom” was changed to “ground your child”). The item “slapped child on hand” 
were left out after the 7-year survey and the items “withdrawal of privileges” and “spank child on 
the bottom” were left out after the 11 year survey. The sum score was calculated as the item average 
and the range of this was consistent across surveys. Due to the low number of items inter-item 
correlations was used to examine reliability. Inter-item correlations ranged from 0.10 - 0.52 for the 
list of verbal sanctions and 0.14 - 0.60 for the list of physical sanctions. 
Contact with social services was assessed with a single item asking if the respondent 
had any type of contact with the social services of the municipality since the last survey. These 
contacts can include non-normative family benefits (seeking general financial aid or compensation 
of handicap expenses) or help initiated by the authorities (providing parenting support or 
surveillance of the family).  
Control variables covered observed characteristics of the mothers and children and 
were measured longitudinally and current value (e.g. educational level obtained at each data point) 
was entered in the models. Observed mother characteristics were: years of schooling, level of 
education, employment, marital status, and native language. Observed child characteristics were: 
number of children in household, child gender, child birthweight, and duration of breastfeeding.

Prior to analyses, the data was screened for errors. The percentage of missing data was fairly small 
(3-6%). Thus the Expectation Maximation algorithm (Bunting, Adamson & Mulhall, 2002), which 
has been demonstrated to be an effective method of dealing with missing data, was performed to 
impute missing data on all included scales. Analyses were conducted in SPSS, version 22. Four 
categorical predictors were dummy coded into values 0 and 1: Education (4 levels) and years of 
schooling  (3 levels) ethnicity (3 levels) and marital status (3 levels). We predicted the three 
continuous outcome variables (SDQ difficulty score, verbal and physical sanctions) using a 
standard multiple regression approach.  We predicted the one binary outcome variables (contact 
with social services) using a logistic regression approach. Regression models included the following 
covariates: Years of schooling, level of education, employment, marital status, native language, 
number of siblings in household, child gender, child birth weight, and duration of breastfeeding. 
To select the best fitting model, we fitted initially a linear model, then added high order 
terms successively for maternal age, until the highest order term was no longer statistically 
significant, at which point we adopted the previous model. All final models were linear for maternal 
age. No issues of multicollinearity among covariates were observed. Some regression models 
violated the assumption of homoscedasticy, and this bias was addressed by using corrected and 
accelerated confidence intervals (BCA) and significance tests of the model parameters.

The sample of mothers of seven-year-old children (N = 4741) represented 88 percent of the families 
that were recruited when the children were infants in 1996. The response rates in percent for 
mothers at each of the three data points were 88.0, 82.7, 71.5, respectively. The mean child-bearing 
age (at birth of the child) in the 7 year sample was 30.4 (SD = 4.6), ranged from 17- 47, and was 
stable in the samples across time points. This mean was a bit higher than the mean child-bearing age 
of all Danish women giving birth in 1996 (M = 29.4, Danish Statistics, 2016). We have no 
indications that younger mothers were more likely to drop out from the study. Raw outcome data 
stratified in maternal childbearing age groups are presented in Table 2. The age bands (<22, 23-26 
etc.) were made in parallel to those used by Suttcliff et al. (2012) to allow comparison between 
studies. 
(Table 2 about here.) 
From visual inspection of the raw data in Table 2, it appears that the overall use of 
verbal sanctions, use of physical sanctions and child difficulties decreased as the children aged, and 
these decreases seemed to occur across all maternal age bands. Table 3 shows the bivariate, 
crosssectional relations of all model variables. Perhaps most notable and as expected maternal 
childbearing age was negatively correlated with all other model variables including child 
difficulties. There also were moderate correlations between child difficulties and contact to social 
services as well as small to moderate correlations between the child difficulties and use of verbal 
and physical sanctions. Finally, there were very small to small correlations between either measure 
of sanctions and contact to social services.

Child Behavioral, Social, and Emotional Difficulties 
There was a significant linear relationship between older maternal age and the strengths and 
difficulties total problem score at 7 years and 11 years, with scores decreasing as maternal age 
increased, indicating better social development for children of older mothers. In the adjusted 
models, the score for children of mothers aged 25 was 0.35 standard deviations higher than for 
children of mothers aged 40 at 7 years. The corresponding difference was 0.25 standard deviations 
11 years. At 15 years the relation between maternal age and the strengths and difficulties total 
problem score was no longer significant.  
Parental Use of Sanctions 
The use of verbal sanctions decreased with older maternal age, and this linear relationship was 
significant across age 7, 11 and 15. At 7 years of age the use of verbal sanctions in adjusted models 
for mothers aged 25 was 0.35 standard deviation higher than for mothers aged 40, and at 11 and 15 
years the corresponding differences were 0.27, and 0.15 respectively. The use of physical sanctions 
also decreased with maternal age, yet only at age 7 and 11. No significant relationship was found 
between use of physical sanctions and maternal age when children were 15 years old. At 7 years the 
use of physical sanctions for mothers aged 25 was 0.11 standard deviation higher than for children 
of mothers aged 40 and above, and the corresponding difference was 0.15 standard deviation at 11 
years.

Contact with Social Services

age group. When children were seven years old more than one in four families with mothers in the

youngest age group were in contact with social services (26.3 %, Table 2). In spite of this, there was 
no linear relationship between maternal age and contact with social services once the covariates 
were entered in the model.  
(Table 5 about here) 
Discussion 
In results from this study, older maternal age was associated with fewer behavioral, social and 
emotional difficulties in children at 7 and 11 years of age, but not at age 15. Older mothers reported 
less frequent use of physical sanctions at 7 and 11 years of age and less use of verbal sanctions at 7, 
11 and 15 years of age. These associations were independent of all other observed maternal 
characteristics such as education, employment, marital status and native language and child 
characteristics such as gender, birth weight and number of siblings. No association of maternal age 
and contact with social services was found when control variables were entered in the model.  
These findings add to previous results reported by Sutcliffe et al. (2012) and Barnes et 
al. (2014) by extending the age span during which older maternal age appear to be associated with 
more positive parenting and fewer behavioral, social and emotional difficulties. Sutcliffe et al. 
(2012) found the strength of the association between maternal age and child difficulties to decrease 
from age 3 to age 5  and in  the current study we found a further decrease from age age 7 to age 11 
and no significant findings at age 15. Although cautious interpretation must be made when 
comparing coefficients across data points1 and samples, there seems to be a trend toward a 
decreasing relationship between maternal age and child difficulties as children age. Unlike studies 
by Barnes, Sutcliffe and colleagues, the current study found no curvilinear relationships.

As noted by Barnes et al. (2014) the two UK samples over-represented families from 
disadvantaged backgrounds, which may have more risk factors that could influence parenting and 
child outcome. The current study replicated findings from Sutcliffe et al. (2012) and Barnes et al. 
(2014) in a Danish sample in which mothers were overall older and less disadvantaged. The fact the 
findings replicate under conditions that would potentially limit the magnitude of the association 
between age and child outcome speak to the generalizability of results. 
Among strength of the current study, results are obtained with a standardized measure 
of child socio-emotional development across 8 years from a large population sample. With this data, 
the present study provides some of the most convincing evidence to date that older motherhood is 
linked with positive child development beyond preschool years. Despite these strengths of this 
study, the interpretation of results must account for potential sources of bias. First, the present study 
relies upon parental report with regard to child behavior and parenting discipline. With this method, 
we are not allowed to disentangle child behavior from parenting to examine the mechanisms 
through which parent and child behavior may interact. Other approaches such as in-vivo 
observation of child-parent interaction would be valuable in this regard. Yet, self-report assessment 
of parent- and child behavior has been shown to provide valid measures of their underlying 
constructs (Goodman, Meltzer & Bailye, 1998; Lee, Lansford, Pettit, Bates & Dodge, 2012). This 
study obtained most data through full face-to-face interviews conducted by skilled interviewers in 
the respondents’ home which may further strengthen the quality of the data. In contrast to the 
validated measures on child behavior, contact with social services was assessed with single self-
report item, potentially limiting the sensitivity on this construct. Thus the current null-finding 
should be replicated using register-based data on families’ aid from social service agencies prior to 
final disregard of the hypothesis.

Why do women who have deferred childbearing beyond their twenties seem to do well 
– not only during transition to parenthood – but also in the longer run in terms of disciplining less 
and raising children with fewer difficulties? As presented above, maturity tends to bring personal 
growth in terms of more stable emotional well-being, greater psychological hardiness and 
flexibility, higher level of personal integration,greater tolerance for complexity in emotional 
experience, and improved ability to forgive (Camberis et al., 2016; Carstensen et al., 2011; Cheng 
& Yim, 2008; Manners & Durkin, 2001; Mercer, 1986) )  If these aspects of maturity allow mothers 
to adopt a sound balance between freedom and control in their parenting style, the theory of the 
more authoritative parenting style may help explain maturity effects on long run child outcomes  
(Baumrind, 2013).The authoritative parenting style has been linked with children’s, adolescent’s 
and youth’s positive development within the temperamental, conduct, peer and prosocial domains 
(Cavell, Harrist & Del Vecchio, 2013; Morris, Cui & Steinberg, 2013; Sorkhabi, 2013). The current 
study found correlations between the higher use sanctions and lower child adjustment within socio-
emotional domains at 7, 11, and 15 years (Table 3).  Whether the effect of maternal maturity on 
child outcome is mediated by an increased use of the authoritative parenting style, remains an 
important hypothesis for testing. 
The gradual fading of the older mother effect can be explained by the juxtaposed 
process of individual autonomy and peer influence between 7 and 15 years. Although cognitive 
social domain theorists (e.g. Nucci, 2008; Smetana, 2002, 2005) argue that an intensive parent-
adolescent conflict/difficulty period is to be expected, this study found decreasing levels of both 
maternal use of sanctions and fewer child difficulties as the children grew. Thus the current data 
does not relate older maternal age to level of adolescent turmoil.

With the recent trend toward older maternal childbearing age in most Western 
developed countries, evidence on medical as well as psychosocial risks and advantages are 
important. Holding level of education and social status variables constant – this study suggests that 
important aspects of maturity in mothers may be of long-term benefit to the maternal parenting style 
as well as to the socio-emotional development of the growing child.
