Background: Powered exoskeletons are designed to safely facilitate ambulation in patients 
with spinal cord injury (SCI). We conducted the first meta-analysis of the available published 
research on the clinical effectiveness and safety of powered exoskeletons in SCI patients.
Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of powered 
exoskeleton-assisted walking in patients with SCI. Main outcomes were analyzed using fixed 
and random effects meta-analysis models.
Results: A total of 14 studies (eight ReWalk™, three Ekso™, two Indego®, and one unspeci-
fied exoskeleton) representing 111 patients were included in the analysis. Training programs 
were typically conducted three times per week, 60–120 minutes per session, for 1–24 weeks. 
Ten studies utilized flat indoor surfaces for training and four studies incorporated complex 
training, including walking outdoors, navigating obstacles, climbing and descending stairs, 
and performing activities of daily living. Following the exoskeleton training program, 76% of 
patients were able to ambulate with no physical assistance. The weighted mean distance for 
the 6-minute walk test was 98 m. The physiologic demand of powered exoskeleton-assisted 
walking was 3.3 metabolic equivalents and rating of perceived exertion was 10 on the Borg 
6–20 scale, comparable to self-reported exertion of an able-bodied person walking at 3 miles 
per hour. Improvements in spasticity and bowel movement regularity were reported in 38% and 
61% of patients, respectively. No serious adverse events occurred. The incidence of fall at any 
time during training was 4.4%, all occurring while tethered using a first-generation exoskeleton 
and none resulting in injury. The incidence of bone fracture during training was 3.4%. These 
risks have since been mitigated with newer generation exoskeletons and refinements to patient 
eligibility criteria.
Conclusion: Powered exoskeletons allow patients with SCI to safely ambulate in real-world 
settings at a physical activity intensity conducive to prolonged use and known to yield health 
benefits.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic event with a global incidence of 23 cases per 
million, representing 180,000 cases per annum worldwide.1 Despite concerted efforts to 
develop medical and surgical interventions intended to minimize chronic neurological 
deficit with acute SCI, recovery of physical function following SCI remains limited 
due to rapid degenerative processes such as neurotoxicity, vascular dysfunction, glial

scarring, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and demyelination.2 
Consequently, spinal cord-injured patients have increased 
risks of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, respiratory 
problems, pressure ulcers, and muscular spasticity and con-
tractures compared to the general population.3,4
Recovery of locomotion is a main priority for spinal 
cord-injured patients.5 In addition to overcoming the obvious 
mobility and social issues related to the inability to stand or 
walk, regular ambulation may profoundly combat secondary 
medical problems associated with lack of weight-bearing 
activity in SCI patients.6 Orthotic technologies such as hip-
knee-ankle-foot orthosis (HKAFO) and reciprocating gait 
orthosis (RGO) have been employed with mixed success as 
a means of addressing this critical unmet health care need in 
the SCI population. The main limitation of these devices is 
a high metabolic demand such that most patients eventually 
discontinue their use.7–10 Since the health benefits of physi-
cal activity are largely dependent on exercise frequency and 
duration,11 these traditional orthotic technologies likely have 
limited utility in ameliorating the chronic effects of inactiv-
ity due to SCI.
Powered exoskeletons are prescription devices compris-
ing an external, powered, motorized orthosis that is placed 
over a person’s paralyzed or weakened limbs for the purpose 
of facilitating standing, walking, climbing stairs, and per-
forming activities of daily living. Powered exoskeletons are 
classified as class II medical devices by the US Food and Drug 
Administration.12 Although several systematic reviews of 
powered exoskeletons have recently been published,13–15 there 
are no known meta-analyses that have examined the clinical 
effectiveness and safety of powered exoskeletons in spinal 
cord-injured patients. We report herein the first meta-analysis 
of powered exoskeletons in SCI patients and conclude that 
exoskeleton use allows safe ambulation in real-world settings 
at a physical activity intensity conducive to prolonged use 
and known to yield health benefits.
Methods
eligibility criteria and information sources
This study was performed according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA).16 We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for 
randomized or nonrandomized controlled studies and pro-
spective or retrospective case series with no date restrictions 
on the safety and effectiveness of powered exoskeleton-
assisted walking in adult patients with SCI. The details of the 
MEDLINE search strategy are listed in Table 1. Additionally, 
manual searches were conducted using the Directory of Open 
Access Journals, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of 
included papers and other relevant meta-analyses. The final 
search was conducted on  
November 30, 2015.
Study selection
One reviewer selected studies for inclusion in the review. 
Identified articles were independently assessed by a second 
reviewer to confirm eligibility. Disagreements were resolved 
by discussion and consensus. Titles and abstracts were 
initially screened to exclude all manuscripts published in 
non-English journals. Next, review articles, commentaries, 
letters, animal or in vitro studies, studies with less than 
three patients to eliminate bias inherent with case reports, 
and obviously irrelevant articles were excluded. Full texts 
of the remaining manuscripts were retrieved and reviewed. 
Studies were excluded if mixed diagnoses were included and 
SCI-specific data were not reported; training was limited to a 
treadmill; or the protocol utilized upper body exoskeletons, 
single- or dual-joint exoskeletons, hybrid exoskeletons that 
required volitional contraction of the lower extremities, or 
exoskeletons that required use of a walker.
Data extraction
A database was developed, pilot-tested, and subsequently 
refined to develop the final data extraction database. One

reviewer extracted the data from included studies and a 
second reviewer checked the extracted data for accuracy. 
Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.
Outcomes
Main outcomes were categorized by ambulatory perfor-
mance, physiological demand, health benefits, and safety. 
Ambulatory performance outcomes included assessment 
of ability to ambulate without physical assistance by the 
end of the training program and distance walked during a 
6-minute walk test. Ability to walk without physical assis-
tance was defined as ambulation using crutches or walker, 
but with no physical contact by a therapist for weight shift 
or balance support. The 6-minute walk test measures the 
distance walked over a 6-minute period and serves as an 
indicator of submaximal aerobic capacity.17 Indicators of 
physiological demand of exoskeleton walking included 
metabolic equivalents (METs), rating of perceived exertion 
(RPE), and physiological cost index. The MET concept is 
useful for expressing the energy cost of physical activities. 
One MET represents the amount of oxygen consumed during 
seated rest. In paraplegics, 1 MET is equivalent to 2.7 mL 
O2/kg.18 Each unit increase in METs represents a multiple of 
the energy used by the body at rest. For reference, exertion 
with physical activity can be classified as light (,3 METs), 
moderate (3–6 METs), or vigorous (.6 METs). Rating of 
perceived exertion values was self-reported according to the 
Borg 6–20 scale.19 For reference, a value of 6 represents no 
exertion, 9– 11 represents very light to light exertion, 13–15 
represents somewhat hard to hard exertion, 17 represents very 
hard, and 20 represents maximal exertion. Physiological cost 
index serves as an indicator of ambulation efficiency and was 
calculated as heart rate during exoskeleton-assisted ambula-
tion minus resting heart rate divided by walking velocity.20 
Health benefit outcomes included self-reported decreases in 
spasticity and improvements in bowel movement regularity 
with exoskeleton use. Safety parameters included serious 
adverse events, falls, and bone fractures reported at any time 
during the study, regardless of cause.
Data analysis
For each main outcome, fixed and random effects meta-
analysis models were developed; data from the random effects 
model were preferentially reported in the manuscript based 
on the a priori assumption that treatment effects would be 
heterogeneous, given the differences in exoskeletons and 
patient characteristics among studies. For each main outcome, 
the pooled estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
calculated. A forest plot was used to illustrate the individual 
study findings and the pooled meta-analysis results. We used 
the I2 statistic to estimate heterogeneity of effects across 
studies with values of #25%, 50%, and $75% representing 
low, moderate, and high inconsistency, respectively.21 Statis-
tical analyses were performed using MedCalc version 12.5 
(MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) and Comprehensive 
Meta-Analysis version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).
Results
Study selection
Our initial database search retrieved 105 titles and abstracts; 
handsearching relevant bibliographies identified three 
additional records. After screening records for inclusion 
criteria, 48 full-text articles were reviewed for eligibility. 
Ultimately, 14 studies22–35 representing 111 distinct patients 
were included in the final analysis. A flow diagram of study 
identification and selection is shown in Figure 1.
Study characteristics
All studies included in this review were prospective and 
conducted at single centers in the US (eleven), the UK (one), 
Iran (one), and Israel (one). Sample sizes ranged from 3 to 
16 patients (median 7).
Patient characteristics
Mean patient age was 37 years, with males accounting for 
83% of the patients. The level of injury varied considerably 
among studies, with most injuries located between T1 and 
T12. Nearly three in four patients presented with complete 
SCI (Table 2).
Powered exoskeleton training protocols
The ReWalk™ (ReWalk Robotics, Inc., Marlborough, 
MA, US) powered exoskeleton was evaluated in eight 
 
studies,23–25,27,32–35 Ekso® (Ekso Bionics, Richmond, CA, 
US) in three studies,29–31 Indego™ (Parker Hannifin Corp., 
Cleveland, OH, US) in two studies,26,28 and an unspecified 
exoskeleton in one study.22 Representative images and com-
plete specifications of the ReWalk, Ekso, and Indego pow-
ered exoskeletons are available elsewhere.36–38 The study of 
Arazpour et al22 was a randomized cross-over trial comparing 
exoskeleton, RGO, and HKAFO; the remaining studies were 
prospective case series. There was considerable variation 
in training programs among studies, for a duration ranging 
from 1 to 24 weeks. Typically, programs were conducted 
three times per week for 60–120 minutes per session. Ten 
 
studies22,23,25–27,29,31,33–35 utilized training programs exclusively

on flat indoor surfaces, while four studies24,28,30,32 incorporated 
more complex forms of training, including walking outdoors, 
navigating obstacles, climbing stairs, and performing activi-
ties of daily living (Table 3).
Ambulatory performance
Following the exoskeleton training program, 76% (95% CI: 
59%–90%) of patients were able to ambulate with no physi-
cal assistance (Figure 2). Significant heterogeneity among 
studies was noted for this outcome (I2=73%, P,0.001). In 
the randomized controlled trial of Arazpour et al,22 6-minute 
walk test velocity and distance were superior with powered 
exoskeleton vs RGO and HKAFO (Figure 3). Across all pow-
ered exoskeleton studies, the weighted mean distance covered 
during a 6-minute walk test was 98 m (95% CI: 80–117 m) 
(Figure 4). Significant heterogeneity among studies was also 
noted for this outcome (I2=85%, P,0.001).
Physiological demand
In the randomized controlled trial of Arazpour et al,22 the 
physiological cost index was ∼50% lower with powered exo-
skeleton vs RGO and HKAFO (Figure 3). Across all powered

Health benefits
Health benefits related to exoskeleton-assisted ambulation 
were inconsistently reported. In five studies, 38% (95% 
CI: 19%–59%) of patients reported decreases in spasticity 
with exoskeleton training; heterogeneity among studies was 
moderate (I2=46%, P=0.12) (Figure 7). In three studies, 61% 
(95% CI: 20%–95%) of patients reported improvements 
in bowel movement regularity with exoskeleton training 
(Figure 8). Significant heterogeneity was identified among 
studies (I2=81%, P,0.01).
Safety
No serious adverse events were reported in any included 
study. The incidence of a fall at any time during the training 
program was 4.4% (95% CI: 1.0%–10.0%) (Figure 9). All 
three reported falls occurred in a single study29 while tethered 
and none resulted in injury. Falls were due to programming 
errors using a first-generation Ekso exoskeleton in two 
participants and due to malfunctioning of specialized forearm

exoskeleton-assisted walking in patients with SCi
crutches that had been discontinued in one participant. The 
incidence of bone fracture at any time during the training 
program was 3.4% (95% CI: 0.7%–8.1%) (Figure 10). 
The single reported event was a hairline talus fracture that 
required no treatment in a patient who did not undergo bone 
density screening.24
Discussion
This is the first known meta-analysis of the clinical effective-
ness and safety of powered exoskeletons in SCI patients. The 
results of this study show that use of a powered exoskeleton 
allows safe ambulation in real-world settings at a physical 
activity intensity conducive to prolonged use and known to 
yield health benefits.
Most patients included in this review presented with 
complete SCI. Generally, less than 5% of such patients 
have the ability to ambulate without physical assistance. 
Following an exoskeleton training program, 67% of patients 
in this review were able to engage in exoskeleton-assisted 
ambulation without physical assistance. Since training 
programs were limited to only five or six sessions in some 
studies,26,28,29 it is plausible that the ability to ambulate 
without physical assistance may be somewhat higher with 
training programs of adequate duration that emphasize 
identification of safe environments for exoskeleton use, 
use of safety features, and operation in environments rep-
resentative of actual use.
For studies that reported 6-minute walk test results after 
exoskeleton training, the gait speed achieved suggested 
encouraging potential for independent ambulation in home 
and community environments. Physiologic demands during 
powered exoskeleton ambulation averaged 3.3 METs for the 
included studies, which represents 24%–35% of peak oxygen 
uptake during exercise in SCI patients.23 These data suggest 
that exoskeleton use allows SCI patients to engage in physical 
activity at an intensity that conveys health benefits, yet does 
not result in early fatigue, as with older orthotic technologies 
such as HKAFO and RGO. Powered exoskeleton walking 
perceived exertion corresponded to fairly light to light exer-
tion, implying that patients felt they could sustain ambulation 
for extended durations. This assertion is supported by the 
fact that several studies in this review utilized exoskeleton-
assisted training programs up to 2 hours duration per ses-
sion. In contrast, spinal cord-injured adults can ambulate 
only 20–50 m at a time with an RGO before stopping due to 
fatigue.10 The randomized controlled trial of Arazpour et al22

confirmed that SCI patients can walk faster and with less 
effort using a powered exoskeleton vs RGO and HKAFO. 
Physical activity at 3.3 METs maintained for only 1 hour per 
day, 3 days per week, corresponding to 10 MET hours per 
week, is associated with preventive health benefits includ-
ing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk reduction of 
20% in the general adult population.6 For SCI patients, those 
same health benefits should be a reasonable expectation. In 
addition, several other benefits may accrue to SCI patients 
as a result of intermittent standing and habitual ambulating 
activity with the powered exoskeleton, including increasing 
upper body muscular fitness,39 minimizing declines in bone 
mineral density by periodic exposure to gravitational and 
muscular loading forces,40 improved circulatory response,41 
and countering the independent health risks associated with 
prolonged sitting.42 Indeed, clinically relevant improve-
ments were found in self-reports for muscle spasticity and 
bowel movement regularity following exoskeleton training. 
A potential focus for future research would be to assess the 
long-term health and cost benefits associated with chronic 
powered exoskeleton use. Assuming regular exoskeleton 
use sufficient to yield the aforementioned health benefits, it 
is likely that the initial expense of providing personal exo-
skeletons for home use to individuals with SCI (typically 
$70,000–$100,000) may be offset by savings attributable to 
prevention of physical maladies and associated costs in SCI 
patients, which may ultimately result in overall savings to 
the health care system.
The safety of exoskeleton-assisted ambulation was 
demonstrated by no reports of serious adverse events and a 
low incidence of tethered falls and fractures that were sub-
sequently addressed by refinements to exoskeleton design 
and patient selection criteria. Falls were identified in a single 
study29 that used an early prototype exoskeleton; injuries to 
subjects were prevented by a tethering device. The instance 
of a hairline talus fracture occurring in a subject who did not 
undergo bone density screening24 suggests that osteoporosis/
osteopenia should be viewed as a relative contraindication 
for SCI patients being considered for exoskeleton ambula-
tory training. Although there are subtle differences when 
comparing features of available exoskeleton, generally 
accepted criteria for safe use include ability to stand using 
an assistive device and absence of severe neurological injury, 
severe spasticity, significant contractures, osteoporosis, and 
existing fractures. On balance, falls and fractures are known 
risks for all assisted walking devices for SCI patients such 
as KAFO and RGO, which mandate similar patient screen-
ing measures.

exoskeleton-assisted walking in patients with SCi
Four of the 14 studies included more complex forms of 
ambulatory training relevant to daily living.24,28,30,32 Examples 
of these activities included walking on uneven or carpeted 
surfaces and grades, negotiating curbs outdoors, climbing 
stairs, entering/exiting of elevators, and ordering at a café. It is 
important to note that in the studies that utilized complex train-
ing, no serious adverse events, falls, or fractures were reported. 
While these activities were performed under the supervision 
of trained clinicians, the outcomes indicate that a powered 
exoskeleton uniquely facilitates independent performance of 
tasks relevant to the home and community settings.
Limitations
As with any meta-analysis, interpretation of outcomes may 
be confounded by issues related to individual study designs 
and by issues inherent in the analysis of summary data. 
There was considerable variation in the consistency of out-
come reporting among studies. Development of minimum 
reporting standards for powered exoskeleton clinical trials 
is recommended to facilitate comparisons among studies. 
Additionally, the number of studies limited our ability to 
explore sources of heterogeneity such as age, level of injury, 
and duration of injury. Despite these limitations, this report 
represents the most comprehensive synthesis of data for pow-
ered exoskeleton-assisted walking in patients with SCI.
Conclusion
In conclusion, powered exoskeletons allow patients with 
SCI to safely ambulate in real-world settings at a physical 
activity intensity conducive to prolonged use and known to 
yield health benefits.
