Aim
To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on frequency of standard apheresis treatments [weekly or every 2 weeks
(Q2W)] in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
results
ODYSSEY ESCAPE (NCT02326220) was a double-blind study in 62 HeFH patients undergoing regular weekly or
Q2W lipoprotein apheresis. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1, respectively) to receive alirocumab 150mg
(n ¼ 41) or placebo (n ¼ 21) Q2W subcutaneously for 18 weeks. From day 1 to week 6, apheresis rate was fixed
according to the patient’s established schedule; from weeks 7 to 18, apheresis rate was adjusted based on the
patient’s low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in a blinded fashion. Apheresis was not performed
when the LDL-C value was�30% lower than the baseline (pre-apheresis) value. The primary efficacy endpoint was
the rate of apheresis treatments over 12 weeks (weeks 7–18), standardized to number of planned treatments. In the
alirocumab group the least square (LS) mean 6SE (95% confidence interval [CI]) per cent change in pre-apheresis
LDL-C from baseline at week 6 was �53.7 6 2.3 (�58.2 to � 49.2) compared with 1.66 3.1 (–4.7 to 7.9) in the pla-
cebo group. The primary efficacy endpoint showed statistically significant benefit in favour of alirocumab (Hodges–
Lehmann median estimate of treatment difference: 0.75; 95% CI 0.67–0.83; P < 0.0001). Therefore, alirocumab-
treated patients had a 0.75 (75%) additional reduction in the standardized rate of apheresis treatments vs. placebo-

treated patients. During this period, 63.4% of patients on alirocumab avoided all and 92.7% avoided at least half of the
apheresis treatments. Adverse event rates were similar (75.6% of patients on alirocumab vs. 76.2% on placebo).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Lipoprotein apheresis was discontinued in 63.4% of patients on alirocumab who were previously undergoing regular
apheresis, and the rate was at least halved in 92.7% of patients. Alirocumab was generally safe and well tolerated.

Introduction
Familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterized by raised low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and premature onset of cardiovas-
cular disease. Without effective lipid-lowering treatment (LLT),
adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH)
have a very high risk of a coronary event by age 50. Statins can reduce
this risk, but patients still have an approximately two-fold excess of
coronary heart disease mortality vs. the general population.1
Lipoprotein apheresis removes apoproteinB100-containing lipopro-
teins from the blood.2 It is generally regarded as a last-resort option for
patients with progressive cardiovascular disease and persistently ele-
vated LDL-C.2 Apheresis is expensive and can only be performed in
specialized centres,3 the availability of which varies in different coun-
tries. As LDL-C concentrations quickly return to pre-treatment levels,
patients must undergo a regular weekly or every 2 weeks (Q2W)
apheresis regimen, depending on the patient’s LDL-C value and local
practice.4 Lipoprotein apheresis acutely lowers the LDL-C concentra-
tion by 50–75%, but the time-averaged reduction approximates 30%.
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds
PCSK9 and inhibits PCSK9-mediated hepatic catabolism of the low-
density lipoprotein receptor. Alirocumab as monotherapy or on a
background of LLT reduced LDL-C by 44–58% in patients with and
without HeFH.5–9 The 150 mg Q2W dose in combination with statin
therapy with or without other LLT reduced LDL-C by 62–72%.10–13
These data showing robust decreases in LDL-C suggested that aliro-
cumab may allow a reduction in the frequency of standard apheresis
treatments (weekly or Q2W) or remove the need for apheresis in
patients with HeFH. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
evaluate the effect of alirocumab 150 mg Q2W vs. placebo on the
standardized rate of apheresis treatments in patients with HeFH.
Methods
ODYSSEY
ESCAPE
(https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT023
26220) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, phase 3 study in patients with HeFH undergoing regular weekly or
Q2W lipoprotein apheresis. The study was conducted at 14 sites in the
United States and Germany; screening started in March 2015 and was
completed in September 2015.
The study design has been published.14 The main study criteria are
detailed in Supplementary material online, Table S1. Eligible patients had
HeFH (diagnosed by genotyping or clinical criteria15,16), had undergone
consistent lipoprotein apheresis weekly for �4 weeks or Q2W for �8
weeks, and had maintained a stable background medical LLT, diet, and
exercise level for�8 weeks. Patients undergoing all lipoprotein apheresis
techniques were recruited (for additional information, see Supplementary
material online, Text S1).14 Patients with homozygous familial hypercholes-
terolaemia (FH) were excluded. Patients continued to take their back-
ground LLT and remained on a stable diet and exercise regimen from
screening until the end of treatment visits.14
The study was approved by the local institutional review boards, and
was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the International
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and
applicable local laws and regulations. All patients provided written
informed consent.
Intervention
During the 2-week screening period, patients provided informed consent,
were checked for eligibility, and underwent a lipid panel and other labora-
tory testing, safety evaluation, and dietary review.14 LDL-C was calculated
using the Friedewald formula (for information on laboratory analyses, as well
as the well-being analysis, see Supplementary material online, Text S1).17
Qualifying patients were randomly assigned (2:1, respectively) to
receive alirocumab 150mg or placebo subcutaneously Q2W for 18 weeks
during the double-blind treatment period. Randomization was done cen-
trally using an interactive voice or web response system and a permuted-
block design to ensure even distribution of treatment assignment.
Randomization was stratified by frequency of apheresis procedure (weekly
or Q2W) and normal (<30mg/dL) or elevated (�30mg/dL) lipoprotein
(a) values. Treatment injections (in 1-mL volume) were administered at
the site by research staff using an autoinjector, starting on the day of ran-
domization. The drug or placebo was administered immediately after
completion of the apheresis procedure on days when the two coincided.
The double-blind treatment period comprised two intervals: (phase 1)
from day 1 to week 6, the apheresis rate was fixed according to the patient’s
established schedule (weekly or Q2W); (phase 2) from week 7 to week 18,
the apheresis rate was adjusted based on the patient’s LDL-C response to
treatment, determined by blinded point-of-care testing. Apheresis was not
performed when the LDL-C value at that visit was�30% lower than the
baseline (pre-apheresis) LDL-C value, as described previously.14 Site person-
nel and patients were blinded to the LDL-C value and treatment assignment,
and only received an alert as to whether apheresis should be performed on
the basis of coded and blinded point-of-care LDL-C results.
Patients in Germany who completed the double-blind treatment
period were offered an optional open-label extension (to week 86)
(results for these patients are not currently available). The extension was
not offered to patients in the United States because alirocumab is com-
mercially available, but patients had the option to initiate clinical treat-
ment with alirocumab or evolocumab. Patients who were not eligible or
who chose not to enter the extension were followed for 8 weeks after
the end of the double-blind treatment period, or after premature discon-
tinuation of study treatment.

Outcome measures
The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of apheresis treatments over
12 weeks (weeks 7 to 18), standardized according to the number of
planned treatments for each individual patient. Key secondary endpoints
are listed in Supplementary material online, Table S2.
Safety was assessed based on adverse event reports and laboratory
analyses during the treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) period
(defined as the time from the first dose of double-blind study treatment
to the last injection plus 70 days [10 weeks], as alirocumab was antici-
pated to have a residual effect lasting for 10 weeks after the last
injection).
Statistical analyses
We estimated that a sample size of 63 patients (alirocumab 42: placebo
21) would have at least 85% power to detect a 33% difference in mean
apheresis rates using a two-sided significance level and assuming a stand-
ard deviation (SD) of 40%.14
The primary efficacy analysis population was the primary intent-to-
treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized patients. The secondary
efficacy analysis population was based on randomized patients who had
atleast one pre-apheresis calculated LDL-C value before the first dose of
study drug (or randomization, if the patient did not receive any study
drug) and at least one calculated LDL-C value in one of the pre-apheresis
analysis windows up to week 6. The statistical analysis was conducted
when the last patient completed all efficacy assessments at week 18. LDL-
C data were analysed post hoc using the Kroon18 formula (see
Supplementary material online, Text S1) to estimate the interval means of
LDL-C in weeks 6–18 (after potential withdrawal of apheresis therapy).
The standardized rate of apheresis treatments was analysed through
the rate of treatments received during the 12-week period (week 7 to
week 18), divided by the number of planned treatments (6 for Q2W and
12 for weekly), using the ranked analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
model.19 The standardized apheresis rate could range from 0 to 1, with 0
indicating that the patient skipped all planned apheresis treatments
between week 7 to week 18, and 1 indicating that the patient received all
planned treatments. A rate of 0.75 indicated that the patient received
75% of planned apheresis treatments (and skipped 25% of planned treat-
ments). Patient drop-outs were accounted for as described in
Supplementary material online, Text S1. The median treatment difference
was determined using the Hodges–Lehmann estimation and 95% confi-
dence
intervals
(CIs)
using
Moses
distribution-free
CI
(see
Supplementary material online, Text S1).14
We used a hierarchical inferential approach to control type I error. As
the primary endpoint analysis was significant at the 5% alpha level, key
secondary
efficacy
endpoints
were
tested
sequentially
(see
Supplementary material online, Table S2).14
Results
Seventy-six patients with HeFH undergoing regular weekly or Q2W
lipoprotein apheresis provided consent to participate and were
screened; 62 (71.6%) patients were eligible for randomization in the
study. Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to alirocumab and
21 to placebo (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). All
randomized patients received double-blind study treatment and
were included in the safety population. Sixty patients completed the
6-week double-blind treatment period (40 [97.6%] in the alirocumab
group and 20 [95.2%] in the placebo group) (i.e. when apheresis rate
was determined by the patient’s established schedule), and 57
completed the 18-week double-blind treatment period (37 [90.2%]
and 20 [95.2%], respectively), when the apheresis schedule was
determined by LDL-C value previously achieved. Of the five (8.1%)
patients who prematurely discontinued study treatment, one (4.8%)
was on placebo (withdrawn due to adverse events) and four (9.8%)
were on alirocumab (two were withdrawn for adverse events and
one for poor compliance, one patient withdrew consent).
The mean 6 SD age of the population was 58.76 9.7 years, 36
(58.1%) patients were men, and 60 (96.8%) were white. The median
(minimum, maximum) duration of apheresis treatments before entry
into the study was 4.9 (0.5, 32.9) years.
The baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment
groups (Table 1 and Supplementary material online, Table S3). The
mean calculated baseline LDL-C (at study entry) was 4.561.4mmol/L
(175.1mg/dL) in the alirocumab group and 5.061.8mmol/L (191.
6mg/dL) in the placebo group (P¼ 0.35). Twenty-seven (43.5%)
patients followed a weekly apheresis schedule at baseline and 35
(56.5%) patients followed a Q2W schedule. The mean LDL-C
value in patients undergoing weekly apheresis was 3.961.3mmol/L
(151.3651.3mg/dL) vs. 5.361.4mmol/L (204.9655.7mg/dL) in
patients undergoing Q2W apheresis. Thirty-eight (61.3%) patients had
normal baseline lipoprotein (a) levels (<30mg/dL) and 24 (38.7%) had
elevated levels. Thirty-four (54.8%) patients were taking a statin at
screening, 19 (55.9%) of whom were on a maximum daily dose.
Baseline LDL-C values were 4.061.4mmol/L (155.0654.6mg/dL)
among statin-treated patients compared with 5.4 6 1.4 mmol/L
(208.0 6 53.2 mg/dL) in patients not taking a statin. Thirty patients
(48.4%) were from Germany and 32 (51.6%) from the United
States (see Supplementary material online, Table S4).
The mean6 SD duration of injection exposure was 17.4 6 2.3
weeks (8.6 6 1.3 injections) in the alirocumab group and 17.5 63.1
weeks (8.4 6 1.7 injections) in the placebo group.
Efficacy
The primary efficacy endpoint achieved statistically significant benefit
in favour of alirocumab-treated patients, with a Hodges–Lehmann
median estimate of the treatment difference vs. placebo of 0.75 (95%
CI 0.67–0.83). Therefore, alirocumab-treated patients had a 0.75
(75%) additional reduction in the standardized rate of apheresis
treatments vs. placebo-treated patients (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). The
median treatment difference in the standardized rate of apheresis
treatments from week 7 to week 18, when apheresis treatment was
determined by LDL-C concentration previously achieved, was 0.75
(95% CI 0.58–0.92) for patients who had been undergoing weekly
apheresis and 0.67 (95% CI 0.50–1.00) for those on a Q2W schedule,
in favour of alirocumab.
The median treatment difference in the standardized rate of aphe-
resis treatments over the 4-week period (week 15 to week 18) was
0.50 (95% CI 0.50 – 1.00; P < 0.0001) in favour of alirocumab, indicat-
ing a 50% reduction in the standardized rate of apheresis treatments
vs. placebo (Table 2). The individual patient reductions in apheresis
over the 12-week period are illustrated in Figure 1A. During this
period, 63.4% of patients on alirocumab had no apheresis proce-
dures, and 92.7% avoided at least half of the procedures (Figure 1B).
The rate of apheresis treatments according to apheresis schedule is
illustrated in Supplementary material online, Figure S2.

aThe standardized rate of apheresis treatments was analysed through the rate of treatments received during the 12-week period (week 7 to week 18), divided by the number of
planned treatments (6 for Q2W and 12 for weekly). One patient on a Q2W schedule was misstratified at the time of randomization; on the basis of the ITT approach, the data
for this patient were included in the weekly group.

The mean pre-apheresis LDL-C value decreased from 4.5 mmol/L
(175 mg/dL) at baseline to 2.3mmol/L (90mg/dL) at week 6 in the
alirocumab group; corresponding data for patients in the placebo
group are 5.0mmol/L (192 mg/dL) and 4.8 mmol/L (185 mg/dL)
(Figure 2).
The least square (LS) mean6 standard error (SE) (95% CI) per
cent change in pre-apheresis LDL-C from baseline at week 6 was –
53.76 2.3 (–58.2 to –49.2) in the alirocumab group and 1.66 3.1 (–
4.7 to 7.9) in the placebo group (LS mean6 SE per cent difference –
55.36 3.9, 95% CI –63.1 to –47.5; P < 0.0001) (Figure 2 and
Supplementary material online, Table S5). By week 18, the mean
LDL-C value in the alirocumab group had risen slightly, to 2.9 mmol/L
(110 mg/dL), compared with 4.9 mmol/L (191mg/dL) in the placebo
group (LS mean6 SE per cent difference –46.4 6 7.9, 95% CI –62.3
to –30.5; P < 0.0001) (Figure 2 and Supplementary material online,
Table S5). Results for other selected key secondary endpoints are
shown in Supplementary material online, Table S5. Results from the
well-being analysis are given in Supplementary material online, Text
S2 and Table S6.
A cross-validation, comparing point-of-care LDL-C values with
central laboratory values, showed that both measures were highly
correlated (Pearson’s correlation 0.86) (Supplementary material
online, Text S3).
Per cent change from baseline to week 18 in lipoprotein (a) was
–5.7% for alirocumab vs. –3.0% for placebo among patients with
normal baseline values, and 4.9% vs. 7.6%, respectively, in patients
with elevated baseline values (Supplementary material online,
Table S7). During weeks 7–18, when apheresis treatment could be
withdrawn, alirocumab treatment was associated with a lower
mean 6 SD time-averaged LDL-C value (using the Kroon for-
mula18) over the course of the (potential) apheresis interval of 2.
4 6 1.3 mmol/L (92.7 6 50.2 mg/dL) vs. 3.8 6 1.7 mmol/L (146.
7 6 65.6 mg/dL) for placebo (P < 0.0001).
In a post hoc analysis, the time-averaged LDL-C values in the
alirocumab-treated patients were consistently lower than those in
the placebo-treated patients (Supplementary material online, Figure
S3).
Safety
TEAEs were reported by 75.6% of patients in the alirocumab group
and by 76.2% of patients in the placebo group, none of which were
fatal (Table 3). The rates of serious adverse events (9.8% for alirocu-
mab and 9.5% for placebo) and events leading to treatment discontin-
uation (4.9% and 4.8%, respectively) were also similar in both groups.
Three patients (7.3%) in the alirocumab group and none in the pla-
cebo group had two consecutive pre-apheresis calculated LDL-C val-
ues <0.7mmol/L (25 mg/dL). Two of these patients had at least one
adverse event, one of which had several serious adverse events
(pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure,
congestive heart failure, sepsis, and aortic valve stenosis). Twenty-
seven patients (23 [56.1%] on alirocumab and 4 [19.0%] on placebo)
had two consecutive LDL-C values<0.7mmol/L after apheresis, of
which 15 (65.2%) and 2 (50.0%), respectively, had an adverse event.
None of the events was serious but one patient (4.3%) discontinued
treatment with alirocumab.
Discussion
The ODYSSEY ESCAPE study was conducted in HeFH patients who
had been undergoing regular lipoprotein apheresis. The study
achieved the primary endpoint in the ITT population of a statistically
significant 75% reduction in the standardized rate of apheresis in
favour of alirocumab (P < 0.0001). The standardized rate of apheresis
was at least halved in 39 of 41 (92.7%) patients on alirocumab, with
63.4% having no apheresis procedures during the 12-week period.
Patients receiving alirocumab had lower time-averaged LDL-C values
than placebo-treated patients.
At week 6, the pre-apheresis LDL-C concentration was reduced
by 53.7% in patients on alirocumab, in line with the anticipated reduc-
tion. Consequently, the percentage of patients on apheresis at week
7 dropped markedly in the alirocumab group. Whereas 15 of the 21
placebo-treated patients avoided some of their planned apheresis
treatments,
three

reduction in the apheresis rate. The reasons for this reduction in the
apheresis rate with placebo are unclear, but may reflect individual
variation in LDL-C values, perhaps due to changes in diet or adher-
ence to LLT, the small sample size, and the fact that patients were in a
supervised clinical trial.
All of the patients in this study were at high cardiovascular risk and
had taken LLT previously, including statins. At screening, only 54.8%
of the patients were taking a statin, 55.9% of whom were on a maxi-
mally tolerated dose. A large proportion of the overall population
reported a history of down-titration of statin treatment due to toler-
ability issues (43.5%) and 62.9% reported changing to a different sta-
tin. Various reasons were given for not taking a statin or for not
taking it at the maximum daily dose, ranging from muscle symptoms
to anxiety about side-effects, and regional practices/local labelling,
indicating that patients with HeFH on apheresis present a diverse and
difficult-to-treat population, with limited treatment options.
Patients in the USA showed different characteristics to those in
Germany, with higher baseline LDL-C, greater prevalence of statin
intolerance, and a less frequent apheresis regimen. In the USA, lipo-
protein apheresis for HeFH is often only considered for patients
who, after 6 months, do not have an adequate response to maximum
tolerated drug therapy and have elevated LDL-C plus other cardio-
vascular risk factors.20 In Germany, where apheresis centres are
more common, apheresis is considered within 12 months of failure
of diet and LLT, and at a lower LDL-C threshold, and weekly is pre-
ferred to Q2W apheresis.20 Furthermore, recommendations for
LDL-C lowering from Europe3 are based on a risk-stratified treat-to-
target approach, whereas US guidelines21 advocate a dose-adapted
approach. In view of the approach adopted in European guidelines,3
in which the target LDL-C value is <1.8mmol/L (70 mg/dL), German
patients on alirocumab with LDL-C above this target value would still
meet the criteria for apheresis. Consequently, LLT with alirocumab
may prove complementary to lipoprotein apheresis in patients with
very high LDL-C or who fail to meet the target LDL-C value.
A small observational study involving three patients with HeFH on
long-term apheresis, who ceased apheresis treatment and received
single injections of evolocumab 140 mg Q2W subcutaneously over 7
weeks, reported similar results.22
Limitations
The present study was conducted in two countries, with patients
showing markedly different baseline and treatment characteristics. In
order to account for these differences, the target level was based on
per cent reduction from baseline in LDL-C rather than on achieve-
ment of a specific goal (e.g. <1.8mmol/L[70 mg/dL]) for any given
patient. Thus, in some cases apheresis was interrupted despite the
fact
that specific
LDL-cholesterol
goals were
not achieved.
Guideline-recommended threshold values may be achievable in indi-
vidual patients through treatment with alirocumab alone or in combi-
nation with lipoprotein apheresis. Furthermore, the study is limited
by a relatively small sample size and the short trial duration.
However, there is no reason to believe that longer–term studies or
larger sample sizes would provide different results.

. Conclusions
Lipoprotein apheresis was discontinued in 63.4% of patients on aliro-
cumab who were previously undergoing regular apheresis every 1 or
2 weeks, and the standardized rate was reduced by at least 50% in an
additional 29.3% of patients. PCSK9 inhibition maintained LDL-C at a
significantly reduced plateau level as a function of antibody dose over
time, whereas LDL-C levels following lipoprotein apheresis started to
increase towards pre-procedure levels very rapidly regardless of the
frequency of apheresis administration. This difference between
PCSK9 inhibition and apheresis translates into a cumulative area under
the curve LDL-C benefit in favour of alirocumab, and may be of clinical
significance over the long term. Alirocumab was generally safe and
well tolerated. The findings from this study suggest a role for alirocu-
mab in the overall management of patients with HeFH undergoing
regular lipoprotein apheresis therapy, with the potential to avoid
apheresis treatments or delay the requirement for such treatments.
