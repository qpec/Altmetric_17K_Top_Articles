Abstract
Mutations in CARD14 have recently been linked to psoriasis
susceptibility. CARD14 is an epidermal regulator of NF-jB activa-
tion. However, the ability of CARD14 to activate other signaling
pathways as well as the biochemical mechanisms that mediate
and regulate its function remain to be determined. Here, we
report that in addition to NF-jB signaling, CARD14 activates p38
and JNK MAP kinase pathways, all of which are dependent on the
paracaspase MALT1. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CARD14
physically interacts with paracaspase MALT1 and activates MALT1
proteolytic activity and inflammatory gene expression, which are
enhanced by psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations. Moreover,
we show that MALT1 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of
MALT1 catalytic activity inhibits pathogenic mutant CARD14-
induced cytokine and chemokine expression in human primary
keratinocytes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a novel role
for MALT1 in CARD14-induced signaling and indicate MALT1 as a
valuable therapeutic target in psoriasis.

Introduction
Psoriasis is a poorly understood autoimmune disease that affects
skin and other organs and is characterized by skin reddening, keratino-
cyte
hyperproliferation,
increased
inflammatory
cytokine
and
chemokine expression, and infiltration of lesional plaques by T cells
and dendritic cells [1]. Several studies have highlighted the impor-
tance of genetic factors in the development of psoriasis, but the
exact underlying molecular mechanisms are still inadequately
defined. It is now generally believed that psoriasis is largely driven
by
T-cell-mediated
immune
responses
targeting
keratinocytes;
however, intrinsic alterations in epidermal cells also play a role in
disease expression. In particular, keratinocytes may be important in
initiating, sustaining, and amplifying the inflammatory response by
expressing molecules involved in T-cell recruitment, retention, and
activation [2].
Recently,
several
mutations
in
CARD14
(also
known
as
CARMA2 or Bimp2) were identified in both familial and nonfamil-
ial cases of psoriasis, pinpointing CARD14 as the susceptibility
gene of the elusive psoriasis susceptibility locus 2 (PSORS2) in
chromosomal region 17q25 [3–6]. Human CARD14 is a 1,004
amino acid long protein that is characterized by a C-terminal
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domain, which
is a structural module composed of a PDZ, SH3, and guanylate
kinase-like (GUK) domain. At the N-terminus, CARD14 possesses
a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), followed by
a coiled-coil domain. CARD14 shares a similar domain structure
with CARD11 (CARMA1) and CARD10 (CARMA3) proteins, which
function as molecular scaffolds in NF-jB signaling induced by
antigen receptors and certain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
respectively
[7,8].
More
specifically,
the
CARD
domains
of
CARD10 and CARD11 interact with the CARD domain of BCL10,
which itself binds the protease MALT1, also known as paracas-
pase-1 (PCASP-1) [9]. The resulting CARD10/11–BCL10–MALT1
(CBM) complex then mediates downstream signaling, in which
MALT1 has a dual role [7]. On the one hand, MALT1 functions as
an essential adaptor for other signaling molecules such as TRAF2
and TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligases, which activate downstream
protein kinases (TAK1 and IjB kinases) that are involved in
NF-jB and MAP kinase signaling. On the other hand, MALT1 is a
cysteine protease that cleaves specific signaling proteins and fine-
tunes inflammatory signaling by partially understood mechanisms,
such as stabilization of mRNA molecules encoding specific cyto-
kines and other inflammatory mediators. Studies in MALT1 knock-
out and MALT1 protease dead knock-in mice have shown that
MALT1 plays a key role in immunity and inflammation by regulat-
ing gene expression in lymphocytes and other immune cell types
[10]. Moreover, deregulated MALT1 activity has been implicated
in certain types of lymphoma [11].
Whereas CARD11 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic
tissues, CARD10 and CARD14 show a much broader expression
pattern [4,12]. In the skin, CARD14 strongly localizes to epidermal

 keratinocytes. Several CARD14 isoforms have been identified, and
most studies focused on a shorter splice variant known as
CARD14sh, encoding the first 740 amino acids and lacking the
C-terminal SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domains [4,12]. Overex-
pression of CARD14sh has been shown to activate NF-jB-dependent
luciferase reporter gene expression via its N-terminal CARD domain,
which was shown to interact with BCL10 [13]. In addition,
CARD14sh was reported to interact with TRAF2 and to activate
NF-jB in a TRAF2-dependent manner [12]. So far, upstream mecha-
nisms that trigger CARD14-mediated signaling have not yet been
identified.
Interestingly,
overexpression
of
psoriasis-associated
CARD14 mutants in a keratinocyte cell line leads to enhanced
NF-jB
activation
and
upregulation
of
a
subset
of
psoriasis-
associated genes, including CCL20, IL-8, and IL-36c [3].
Because of its key role in the development of psoriasis, a
better understanding of the signaling function and mechanism of
action of CARD14 is of utmost importance. Here, we have
explored the ability of CARD14 to activate multiple signaling
pathways, and we investigated the role of paracaspase MALT1 in
CARD14-induced signaling and inflammatory gene expression in
human keratinocytes.
Results
CARD14 activates NF-jB and p38/JNK MAP kinase signaling
Most of the work published to date on CARD14 signaling was
performed with the CARD14sh splice variant [3,4], which lacks
the C-terminal SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domains. We there-
fore first compared the effect of overexpression of full-length
CARD14 (further referred as CARD14) and CARD14sh to activate
NF-jB-dependent reporter gene expression and IL-8 secretion in
HEK293T cells. Both CARD14 and CARD14sh activated expres-
sion of the NF-jB reporter gene (Fig 1A) as well as IL-8 (Fig 1B)
in a concentration-dependent manner. The slightly less efficient
activation of NF-jB and IL-8 induction by CARD14sh relative to
CARD14 most likely reflects the somewhat lower expression of
CARD14sh, which we noticed in multiple experiments (Fig 1B
and C).
Besides NF-jB, also p38 and JNK MAP kinases have been impli-
cated in psoriasis [14,15]. Therefore, we compared the ability of
CARD14 and CARD14sh overexpression to activate p38 and JNK
MAP kinase signaling in HEK293T cells. p38 and JNK activation is
associated with their phosphorylation, which can be revealed via
Western blotting of total cell extracts and detection with phospho-
p38 and phospho-JNK specific antibodies, respectively. In addition,
activation of JNK can also be followed by detecting the phosphoryla-
tion and accumulation of c-Jun, whose half-life is increased upon
phosphorylation by JNK [16]. CARD14 as well as CARD14sh
induced phosphorylation of c-Jun, p38 and JNK, and accumulation
of c-Jun (Fig 1C) with similar potency (taking into account slight
differences in CARD14 and CARD14sh expression levels; for exam-
ple, compare lanes 5 and 8 of Fig 1C). We were unable to detect
increased
ERK
phosphorylation
upon
CARD14
overexpression
(Fig EV1). Together, these data clearly demonstrate that CARD14
and CARD14sh not only mediate NF-jB signaling, but also p38 and
JNK signaling.
CARD14 physically interacts with MALT1
In antigen receptor-stimulated T and B cells, CARD11 physically
interacts with BCL10 and the paracaspase MALT1 to form a
so-called CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signalosome that activates
downstream signaling [7]. We therefore hypothesized the existence
of a similar complex in the case of CARD14. To investigate this, we
immunoprecipitated MALT1 from HEK293T cells that were trans-
fected with MALT1, BCL10, and CARD14sh in different combina-
tions and analyzed whether CARD14sh and BCL10 were present in
the same complex. CARD14sh co-immunoprecipitated with MALT1,
which was further increased upon co-expression of BCL10 (Fig 2A),
consistent
with
BCL10
functioning
as
an
adaptor
between
CARD14sh and MALT1. Endogenous BCL10 expression most likely
explains CARD14sh/MALT1 co-immunoprecipitation without BCL10
co-transfection. Knockdown of endogenous BCL10 also strongly
reduced CARD14-induced NF-jB signaling (Fig EV2A). Together,
these data suggest the existence of a novel CARD14/BCL10/MALT1
CBM signalosome.
Compared to full-length CARD14, CARD14sh has an incomplete
MAGUK signature (lacking the C-terminal SH3 and GUK domains).
CARD9, another CARD-containing protein that interacts with the
CARD domain of BCL10 and regulates BCL10-MALT1-mediated
NF-jB activation in response to dectin-1 stimulation of myeloid
cells, lacks the complete MAGUK domain [17,18]. We therefore
compared CBM complex formation between CARD9, CARD14sh,
CARD14, and constitutively active CARD11(L232LI) [19]. MALT1
co-immunoprecipitated equally well with CARD14sh, CARD14, and
CARD11, showing that the absence of the SH3 and GUK domains does
not affect CBM complex formation (Fig EV2B). On the other hand, co-
immunoprecipitation of CARD9 with MALT1 was much less efficient,
especially considering the higher CARD9 expression level. These data
suggest unique regulatory mechanisms in the case of CARD9.
MALT1 is indispensable for CARD14-mediated signaling
The above-described physical interaction of CARD14 with MALT1
suggests an important functional role for MALT1 in CARD14 signal-
ing. To investigate this further, we initially analyzed the effect of
MALT1 co-expression on CARD14sh-induced p38/JNK and NF-jB
signaling in HEK293T cells. Transfection with TRAF6 and CARD11
(L232LI) was used as a positive control. Notably, CARD14sh-
induced p38/JNK phosphorylation and c-Jun accumulation were
significantly enhanced upon co-expression of MALT1 (Fig 2B).
Recently, several psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations [CARD14
(G117S), CARD14(E138A), and CARD14(E142K)] were shown to
potentiate the ability of CARD14sh to activate NF-jB, whereas the
pathogenic CARD14(H171N) variant required stimulation with TNF
to achieve significant increases in NF-jB activation [3,4]. We here
show that the same mutations also enhance NF-jB activation by
full-length CARD14, which was even much more pronounced when
MALT1 was co-expressed (Fig 2C). To investigate whether patho-
genic CARD14 mutations also affect CBM complex formation, we
co-transfected HEK293T cells with MALT1 and either CARD14,
CARD14(E138A), or CARD14(H171N), and analyzed the ability of
the
different
CARD14
variants
to
co-immunoprecipitate
with
MALT1.
Interestingly,
CARD14(E138A)
co-immunoprecipitated
more efficiently with MALT1 than CARD14 and CARD14(H171N)

 (Fig 2D), which is consistent with the NF-jB promoting activity of
this variant (Fig 2C). Together, these results suggest a role for
enhanced MALT1 activation in pathogenic CARD14 signaling.
To further investigate whether MALT1 is essential for CARD14-
mediated signaling, we generated MALT1-deficient HEK293T cells via
TALEN-mediated
genome
editing
and
analyzed
the
ability
of
CARD14sh to induce NF-jB activation in these cells. CARD11-induced
(MALT1-dependent; [7]) and TRAF6-induced (MALT1-independent)
NF-jB activations were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively. Importantly, overexpression of CARD14sh failed to
activate NF-jB in MALT1-deficient cells while reconstitution with
wild-type MALT1 restored the ability of CARD14sh to activate
NF-jB (Fig 3A). CARD14sh-induced NF-jB activation in the pres-
ence of MALT1 was further promoted by BCL10 transfection
(Fig 3A), consistent with a role in CBM complex formation as
described above. Similar to NF-jB activation, CARD14sh-induced
JNK phosphorylation and c-Jun accumulation were completely
compromised in the absence of MALT1, which could be rescued
upon re-introduction of MALT1 (Fig 3B). Of note, reconstitution of
MALT1-deficient cells with a catalytically inactive MALT1(C/A)
mutant also restored CARD14sh-induced JNK signaling (Fig 3B),
indicating that CARD14sh-induced JNK is strictly dependent on MALT1
scaffold function but does not require MALT1 proteolytic activity.
To extend our observations to a physiologically more relevant cell
type, we took advantage of the human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line,
which we stably transfected with a doxycycline-inducible full-length
CARD14 construct. Doxycycline-induced CARD14 expression increased
IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion (Fig 3C). Importantly, siRNA-mediated
knockdown of MALT1 expression efficiently inhibited CARD14-
induced IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion, while non-targeting siRNA had no
effect (Fig 3C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that MALT1 is
indispensable for CARD14-induced inflammatory signaling.

activity, we analyzed whether CARD14 overexpression in HEK293T

CYLD and A20, which are known MALT1 substrates in antigen

endogenous CYLD and A20 in a CARD14 concentration-dependent
manner (Fig 4A). CARD14 signaling did not induce the processing
of a CYLD(R324A) mutant in which the known MALT1 cleavage site
was mutated (Fig 4B). In addition, CARD14 overexpression failed to

 inactive MALT1(C/A) (Fig 4C). Together, these data demonstrate
that CARD14 activates MALT1 proteolytic activity.
We next compared the ability of wild-type CARD14 and several
psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutants to induce CYLD and A20 cleav-
age in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, the pathogenic mutants CARD14
(G117S), CARD14(E138A), and CARD14(E142K) were all more
potent than wild-type CARD14 to induce A20 and CYLD cleavage,
whereas the pathogenic CARD14(H171N) variant was equally active
(Fig 4D). The different efficiency of several CARD14 variants is
consistent with their differential ability to increase NF-jB-dependent
reporter
gene
expression
(Fig 2C)
and
IjBa
phosphorylation
(Fig 4D). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that psoriasis-
associated CARD14 mutations enhance MALT1 proteolytic activity.
MALT1 proteolytic activity in T cells has recently been shown to
increase the expression of a subset of cytokines and other inflamma-
tory mediators by proteolytic inactivation of specific mRNA destabi-
lizing
proteins
[22,23],
We
therefore
analyzed
whether
pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 proteolytic activity by mepa-
zine had an effect on CARD14-induced gene expression in HaCaT
keratinocytes.
Mepazine
prevented
IL-8
and
MCP-1
secretion
triggered by doxycycline-induced expression of CARD14 in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig 4E). In contrast, TNF-induced gene expres-
sion
was
unaffected
by
mepazine
treatment,
consistent
with
MALT1-independent TNF signaling. Collectively, these data demon-
strate that CARD14-induced MALT1 proteolytic activity contributes
to inflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes.
The psoriasis-associated proteins CYLD, A20, and ABIN-1
negatively regulate CARD14 signaling
The deubiquitinases CYLD and A20, as well as the A20-binding
protein ABIN-1 (also known as TNIP-1), are well known because of
their
anti-inflammatory
function
and
association
with
several
autoimmune diseases including psoriasis [24–27]. They are believed
to exert their anti-inflammatory function by dampening multiple
signaling pathways such as NF-jB signaling initiated by Toll-like
receptors and TNF [28–30]. These activities as well as our observa-
tion that CARD14 induces A20 and CYLD cleavage prompted us to
investigate whether CYLD or A20 can regulate CARD14-mediated
NF-jB signaling. Indeed, CYLD (Fig 5A) as well as A20 overexpres-
sion (Fig 5B) significantly inhibited CARD14sh-induced activation
of an NF-jB-dependent luciferase reporter gene in a concentration-
dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with ABIN-1
(Fig 5C). Recently, the ability of A20 to inhibit TNF-induced NF-jB
signaling has been proposed to involve the ubiquitin-binding zinc
finger (Znf) 4 and 7 domains of A20, while disruption of its catalytic
DUB domain had no effect [31,32]. Similarly, mutation of the DUB
domain did not affect the ability of A20 to interfere with CARD14sh-
induced NF-jB signaling, whereas mutation of Znf4 and Znf7
completely
prevented
the
inhibitory
effect
of
A20
(Fig 5D).
Together, these data demonstrate the potential of CYLD, A20, and
ABIN-1 to negatively regulate CARD14 signaling.
Induction of inflammatory gene expression by psoriasis-
associated CARD14 mutants in human primary keratinocytes is
MALT1-dependent
To investigate the role of MALT1 in pathogenic CARD14-induced
inflammatory gene expression, we transfected human primary kera-
tinocytes with the psoriasis-associated mutant CARD14(E138A) and
analyzed the secretion of 36 different human cytokines, chemoki-
nes, and acute-phase proteins using a multiplex antibody array.
CARD14(E138A) expression upregulated multiple cytokines and
chemokines, several of which have been associated with psoriasis
(GM-CSF, IL-1a, IL-1b, RANTES, Groa, IL-8) [1,33,34] (Fig 6A; a
longer exposure of the blot as well as a table showing the location
of all tested proteins is shown in Fig EV3A and C). Next, their
induction was compared in CARD14(E138A) expressing cells that
were transfected with MALT1 siRNA or scrambled siRNA as a nega-
tive control. Knockdown of MALT1 strongly reduced CARD14
(E138A)-induced gene expression (Figs 6B and EV3B), demonstrat-
ing that psoriasis-associated mutant CARD14(E138A)-induced gene
expression in human primary keratinocytes is MALT1-dependent.
We next choose IL-8 as one of the more strongly upregulated
genes to analyze the MALT1-dependency of CARD14-induced gene
expression in more detail. CARD14(E138A) and CARD14(G117S)
were both more potent than wild-type CARD14 in inducing IL-8
(Fig 6C), consistent with their stronger potential to activate NF-jB.

 apparently slight increase in A20 cleavage observed upon TNF stim-
ulation can be explained by a TNF-induced increase in A20 expres-
sion, leading to a higher basal A20 cleavage. Collectively, our data
demonstrate a hitherto unknown role of MALT1 in wild-type and
psoriasis-associated mutant CARD14-mediated inflammatory signal-
ing in human primary keratinocytes.
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate a key role for paracaspase
MALT1 in CARD14-induced signaling. We confirm previous analy-
ses that CARD14 activates NF-jB and extend this by also showing
effects on p38/JNK signaling, both of which are shown to depend
on the presence of MALT1. Of note, the related protein CARD11 also
mediates TCR-induced NF-jB and JNK signaling, but is not essential
for p38 MAP kinase activation [35]. In addition, we show that
CARD14 expression induces the formation of a novel CBM complex
and MALT1 proteolytic activity. The physiological relevance for
psoriasis is illustrated by our finding that the enhanced ability of
psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutants to activate NF-jB relative to
wild-type CARD14 is more pronounced when MALT1 is co-
expressed. We show that pathogenic CARD14 mutants more effi-
ciently activate MALT1 proteolytic activity, which is associated with
enhanced BCL10/MALT1 binding. Moreover, we show that mutant
CARD14-induced cytokine and chemokine expression in human
primary
keratinocytes
can
be
strongly
decreased
by
MALT1
deficiency or a MALT1 protease inhibitor, providing evidence that
MALT1 might be a valuable therapeutic target in psoriasis associ-
ated with CARD14 mutation.
Because stimuli or receptors that activate CARD14-mediated
signaling have not yet been identified, we were limited to the use of
CARD14 overexpression to activate downstream signaling. It was
previously shown that cells express multiple splice variants of
CARD14, with a shorter variant known as CARD14sh being the most
abundant [4,12]. CARD14sh still encodes the N-terminal CARD and
coiled-coil domains that are sufficient for NF-jB activation as well as
a PDZ domain, but lacks the SH3 and GUK domains. Most published
studies only used CARD14sh. Here, we show that overexpression of
full-length CARD14 induces NF-jB-dependent gene expression as
well as p38/JNK activation with largely similar efficiency as
CARD14sh, excluding an important role for the SH3 and GUK
domains. In other proteins, these domains are known to mediate
important protein–protein interactions [36]. We cannot exclude that
these domains still play a role at endogenous expression levels or in
other still to identify CARD14-induced signaling pathways. Consis-
tent
with
previous
findings
made
with
psoriasis-associated
CARD14sh mutants [3,4], overexpression of full-length CARD14
(G117S), CARD14(E138A), and CARD14(E142K) induced NF-jB acti-
vation more potently than wild-type CARD14. These mutations are
located in the linker region between the CARD and coiled-coil
domain or in the beginning of the coiled-coil domain itself. Most
likely the amino acid substitutions cause some conformational
changes in CARD14 that affect intra- or intermolecular interactions

CARD14 signaling activates MALT1 proteolytic activity.
A
CARD14 signaling induces CYLD and A20 cleavage. HEK293T cells were transfected with different concentrations of FLAG-CARD14, with or without MALT1 as
indicated. CARD11(L232LI) transfection was used as a positive control. Endogenous CYLD and A20 processing was analyzed by immunoblotting. CYLD and A20
cleavage fragments are indicated by an arrow, the asterisk indicates a non-specific band.
B
CARD14 signaling induces CYLD cleavage after R324. HEK293T cells were transfected with different concentrations of FLAG-CARD14sh and either wild-type (CYLDWT)
or non-cleavable CYLD (CYLDR324A). CYLD processing was analyzed by immunoblotting. The CYLD cleavage fragment is indicated by an arrow.
C
Expression of catalytically active MALT1 is necessary for CARD14-induced CYLD cleavage. MALT1-deficient HEK293T cells, in which MALT1 expression was restored by
transfection with different concentrations of either wild-type (MALT1WT) or catalytically inactive MALT1 (MALT1C/A), were co-transfected with FLAG-CARD14sh and
CYLD as indicated. CYLD processing was analyzed by immunoblotting. The CYLD cleavage fragment is indicated by an arrow.
D
Psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutation enhances activation of MALT1 proteolytic activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) FLAG-CARD14 or
different psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutants (20 ng), with or without MALT1 (20 ng) as indicated. Endogenous CYLD and A20 processing, as well as IjBa
phosphorylation, was analyzed by immunoblotting. The CYLD and A20 cleavage fragments are indicated by an arrow.
E
Pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 proteolytic activity prevents CARD14-induced gene expression in HaCaT keratinocytes. CARD14 expression was induced by
doxycycline (dox) treatment in the absence or presence of different concentrations of mepazine as indicated. The next morning, cell culture medium was refreshed
and IL-8 and MCP-1 concentration in the cell supernatant was measured 8 h later by ELISA. TNF stimulation (MALT1-independent) was used as a negative control.
Values are the mean of triplicates � SE. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Significance levels: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001 by Student’s t-test.

CYLD and A20 inhibit CARD14sh-induced NF-jB activation. HEK293T cells were transfected with NF-jB reporter plasmid and FLAG-tagged CARD14sh (30 ng), with
or without the indicated concentrations of CYLD (A) or A20 (B). Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured 24 h later. Protein expression of transfected
plasmids was verified by Western blot and is shown in the accompanying panels. Closed arrowheads indicate full-length A20 and CYLD; arrows indicate cleaved
A20 and CYLD. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
C
A20 and ABIN-1 inhibit CARD14-induced NF-jB activation. HEK293T cells were transfected with NF-jB reporter plasmid, A20 (3 ng) or ABIN1 (15 ng) and the
indicated concentrations of FLAG-tagged CARD14sh. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured 24 h later. Protein expression of transfected plasmids was
verified by Western blot and is shown in the accompanying panels. Data are representative of three independent experiments.
D
A20 inhibits CARD14-induced NF-jB activation through its ZnF domains. HEK293T cells were transfected with NF-jB reporter plasmid, FLAG-CARD14sh (20 ng) and
wild-type (WT) or mutant A20 expression plasmids (3 ng) as indicated. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured after 24 h. CARD14 and A20 expression was
measured by immunoblotting (right panel). Data are representative of two independent experiments.

 that are important for NF-jB signaling. This hypothesis is further
supported by our observation that relative to wild-type CARD14,
CARD14(E138A) shows enhanced interaction with MALT1.

 response to dectin-1, GPCR, and T-cell receptor stimulation, respec-
tively [7]. CBM complex formation was equally efficient for CARD14
and CARD14sh, excluding an important role for the C-terminal
MAGUK signature of CARD14. A MAGUK signature is also absent in
CARD9, whose ability to form a CBM complex was, however, found
to be much less efficient than CARD14sh. These data suggest that
structural differences between CARD9 (absence of a complete
MAGUK signature) and CARD14sh (still having the protein and lipid
interacting PDZ part of the MAGUK signature) might provide unique
regulatory mechanisms.
Our observation that CARD14-induced NF-jB signaling and JNK
signaling are fully compromised in MALT1-deficient cells reveals a
key role for MALT1 in CARD14 signaling. Most importantly, we
showed that CARD14 expression also activates the proteolytic
activity of MALT1, resulting in the cleavage of known MALT1
substrates such as A20 and CYLD. Overexpression of A20 and
CYLD diminished CARD14-induced NF-jB signaling, suggesting
that CARD14 activity is under the control of A20 and CYLD. This
is especially interesting since, besides CARD14, single nucleotide
polymorphisms in A20 and CYLD have been associated with psori-
asis susceptibility [24–27]. Because the psoriasis-associated SNPs
in these genes are located outside the coding region, possibly regu-
lating A20 and CYLD expression, we could not determine the effect
of the corresponding mutations on NF-jB signaling induced by
CARD14sh overexpression.
Mechanistically, it has been suggested that in lymphocytes
MALT1 protease activity controls the prolonged DNA-binding capac-
ity of only a subset of RelA- and c-Rel-containing NF-jB complexes
via degradation of the NF-jB family member RelB [37]. In addition,
MALT1 has recently been shown to regulate the stability of specific
mRNAs in lymphocytes by cleaving the RNA binding proteins
Regnase-1 and Roquin [22,23]. It is therefore likely that MALT1 uses
similar mechanisms in keratinocytes to control the expression of a
subset of genes. This is further suggested by our observation that
pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 proteolytic activity significantly
inhibits the CARD14-induced expression of IL-8 and MCP-1 in kerati-
nocytes. If and how CARD14-induced cleavage of A20, CYLD, or
other proteins contributes to this finding remains to be investigated.
Because of its essential role in the activation and proliferation of
lymphocytes, selective inhibition of MALT1 protease activity holds
significant potential for the treatment of autoimmune disease. This
is supported by the fact that MALT1 small-molecule inhibitors are
protective in a mouse model for multiple sclerosis [38]. Moreover,
inhibition of MALT1 proteolytic activity is selectively toxic to
human lymphoma cell lines that exhibit aberrant MALT1 activity
in vitro and xenotransplanted tumors in vivo [39,40]. Therapeutic
inhibition of CARD11/MALT1-mediated T-cell activation is also rele-
vant in the context of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin
diseases. Our finding that CARD14 activates MALT1 proteolytic
activity and inflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes, which
are
enhanced
by
psoriasis-associated
mutations
of
CARD14,
suggests an additional contribution of MALT1 activation in keratino-
cytes to the pathology of psoriasis. While this manuscript was under
revision, MALT1 activity was also shown to control zymosan-
induced expression of inflammatory genes in keratinocytes [41],
which further supports our findings. Moreover, we show that
MALT1
inhibitor
treatment
prevents
mutant
CARD14-induced
expression of several psoriasis-associated cytokines and chemokines
in human primary keratinocytes, which can be expected to affect
keratinocyte–immune cell interactions. Future studies testing the
effect of genetic inactivation of MALT1 in keratinocytes versus T
cells or other cell types combined with murine models of psoriasis
will be very informative. Recently, some concern has been raised on
the concept of chronic and systemic inhibition of MALT1 because
knock-in mice expressing catalytically inactive MALT1 develop
multi-organ inflammation due to the absence of regulatory T-cell
development [42–45] (and reviewed in [10]), although it remains to
be seen whether therapeutic targeting of MALT1 in adult mice
would suffer from similar toxicity. In addition, in the context of
psoriasis topical treatment with MALT1 inhibitors can be expected
to induce less side effects than systemic inhibition of MALT1 activ-
ity. Although more challenging to develop, molecules that specifi-
cally target the interaction of mutant CARD14 with BCL10/MALT1
may allow to specifically interfere with pathological MALT1 activa-
tion in keratinocytes and be the most safe approach to treat psoria-
sis patients with CARD14 mutations.

MALT1 deficiency inhibits CARD14(E138A)-induced cytokine and chemokine expression in human primary keratinocytes. Cells were transfected with scrambled (scr) or
MALT1-targeting siRNA as indicated, 48 h later followed by transfection with CARD14(E138A). After 24 h, cytokine and chemokine expression was analyzed and is
expressed as described in (A).
C
Pathogenic CARD14 mutation enhances MALT1-dependent CARD14-induced IL-8 expression in human primary keratinocytes. Cells were transfected with scrambled
(scr) or MALT1-targeting siRNA as indicated, 48 h later followed by transfection with CARD14 wild-type (WT), CARD14(G117S), or CARD14(E138A) as indicated. TNF
treatment was used as a control. After 24 h, IL-8 concentration in the cell supernatant was analyzed via ELISA. Expression levels of MALT1 and CARD14 variants were
verified by immunoblotting (bottom panel).
D
Pharmacological inhibition of MALT1 proteolytic activity inhibits CARD14-induced IL-8 production and A20 processing in human primary keratinocytes. Cells were
transfected with different CARD14 variants in the presence or absence of mepazine as indicated. TNF treatment was used as a control. Twenty-four hours later, IL-8

CT-30 primers. The PCR product was cloned into EcoRV-opened
pCDNA3 or pCDNA3.1-FLAG vector and verified by sequencing. Full-
length CARD14 psoriasis-associated mutants G117S, E138A, E142K,
and H171N were generated by PCR mutagenesis.
Cells, plasmid transfection, and siRNA-mediated knockdown
HEK293T (gift from Dr. M. Hall; Department of Biochemistry,
University of Birmingham, UK) and HaCaT cells (immortalized
human keratinocytes) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM
L-glutamine. MALT1-deficient HEK293T cells were generated using
TALEN-mediated gene targeting. Briefly, HEK293T were seeded at
105 per well in a 6-well plates and transfected with 1 lg of MALT1
TALEN plasmid pair (H43180, TALEN Library Resource, Seoul,
Korea) on two consecutive days. Cells were serially diluted and
clones lacking MALT1 expression were selected by immunoblotting.
For transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in
24-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate
precipitation method. BCL10 was knocked down in HEK293T cells
with BCL10-specific siRNA smartpool (Dharmacon) using Lipo-
fectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen); non-targeting siRNA pool was
used as a control.
HaCaT cells harboring a dox-inducible CARD14 gene were gener-
ated using retroviral transduction. Briefly, full-length CARD14 was
subcloned into pDG2lenti_Flag rtTA3 puro (LMBP7944) lentiviral
vector. Viral particles were produced in HEK293T cells (3 × 106 cells
per 75-cm2 flask) transfected with 10 lg CARD14-lentivector along
with VSV-G and packaging plasmids. Cells were washed 6 h later,
and 7 ml of fresh media was added to the flask. Supernatant
containing viral particles was collected 48 h after transfection and
filtered through a 0.45-lm filter. Two milliliters of the supernatant
supplemented with 8 lg/ml polybrene was applied to HaCaT cells
seeded at 105 cells per well of a 6-well plates. Infection was repeated
6 h later for additional 18 h. Cells were expanded and selected by
addition of puromycin (1.5 lg/ml). Expression of CARD14 was
induced by the addition of 1 lg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) and con-
firmed by immunoblotting. In knockdown experiments, HaCaT cells
were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Twenty-four
hours and 48 h later, cells were transfected with 5 pmol of non-
targeting or MALT1-specific siRNA smartpool (Dharmacon) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Six hours later, cells were
trypsinized and seeded in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Belgium) at
4 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates in the presence or absence of
1 lg/ml of doxycycline to induce CARD14 expression. Media were
exchanged the next day for fresh OptiMEM, and cells were left for
additional 8 h or 24 h, after which supernatants were collected for
IL-8 (eBioscience, CA, USA) and MCP-1 (BD Biosciences) measure-
ment by ELISA.
Primary human keratinocytes were purchased from Cell Systems
(FC-0007, Troisdorf, Germany) and cultured in Dermalife-K (LM-
0027, Cell Systems, Germany). For transfection, 2.5 × 104 cells were
seeded in 24-well plates and 24 h later transiently transfected using
PromoFectin (PromoKine, Heidelberg, Germany). INTERFERin�
(Polyplus Transfection, France) was used for reverse transfection of
4 × 104 cells with 10 nM of non-targeting or MALT1-specific siRNA
smartpool (Dharmacon). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were
transfected with plasmid DNA as described. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cell supernatants were collected and cytokine levels
were measured by ELISA or human cytokine array (ProteomePro-
filer�, R&D Systems, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
All cells used were free of mycoplasma as measured via the Plas-
moTest Mycoplasma detection kit (InvivoGen, San Diego, USA).
NF-jB-dependent reporter assay
Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were lysed in

Co-immunoprecipitation
HEK293T cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells on 90-mm Petri
dishes and transfected with a total of 5 lg DNA. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were lysed in MALT1 IP buffer (20 mM Tris–
HCl pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100)
supplemented
with
protease
and
phosphatase
inhibitors.
Cell
extracts were pre-cleared with 1 lg of total rabbit IgG (sc-2027,
Santa Cruz) and 15 ll protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Proteins were precipitated with 1 lg of
anti-MALT1 antibody (Abcam) for 2 h at 4°C followed by the
addition of 15 ll protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads
were washed four times with 1 ml lysis buffer and resuspended
in 40 ll Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE
and analyzed by Western blotting.
