Objective: The Predictors of Remission in Depression to
Individual and Combined Treatments [PReDICT] study aimed
to identify clinical and biological factors predictive of treatment
outcomes in major depressive disorder among treatment-
naive adults. The authors evaluated the efficacy of cognitive-
behavioral therapy (CBT) and two antidepressant medications
(escitalopram and duloxetine) in patients with major depres-
sion and examined the moderating effect of patients’ treat-
ment preferences on outcomes.
Method: Adults aged 18–65 with treatment-naive major de-
pression were randomly assigned with equal likelihood to
12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram (10–20 mg/day),
duloxetine (30–60 mg/day), or CBT (16 50-minute sessions).
Priortorandomization,patientsindicatedwhethertheypreferred
medication or CBT or had no preference. The primary outcome
was change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HAM-D), administered by raters blinded to treatment.
Results: A total of 344 patients were randomly assigned, with
a mean baseline HAM-D score of 19.8 (SD=3.8). The mean
estimated overall decreases in HAM-D score did not signif-
icantly differ between treatments (CBT: 10.2, escitalopram:
11.1, duloxetine: 11.2). Last observation carried forward re-
mission rates did not significantly differ between treatments
(CBT: 41.9%, escitalopram: 46.7%, duloxetine: 54.7%). Pa-
tients matched to their preferred treatment were more likely
to complete the trial but not more likely to achieve remission.
Conclusions: Treatment guidelines that recommend either
an evidence-based psychotherapy or antidepressant medi-
cation for nonpsychotic major depression can be extended
to treatment-naive patients. Treatment preferences among
patientswithoutpriortreatmentexposuredonotsignificantly
moderate symptomatic outcomes.

Choosing the initial form of treatment is the most funda-
mental decision clinicians face in caring for patients with
major depressive disorder. Current guidelines recommend
that most patients should initially be treated with either an
antidepressant medication or an evidence-based psycho-
therapy (1), based on the roughly equivalent efficacy, on
average, of psychotherapy and medication treatments for
major depression (2). This average equivalency, however,
masks the substantial variability in outcomes that exists
across patients. There is great need to develop methods for
identifying the best treatment for a particular individual
depressed patient. Variously referred to as personalized
medicine, precision medicine, or personalized intervention,
this approach aims to match each individual patient to a
treatment most likely to prove beneficial through identifying
moderators of likely outcomes to specific treatment options
(3, 4).
Few clinical or socio-demographic variables have em-
erged as prescriptive factors to allow specific differential
recommendations of psychotherapy versus pharmacother-
apy, and the identified factors are not consistent across
studies. Previously identified moderators from large trials
include lower cognitive dysfunction and greater work dys-
function predicting better outcomes with cognitive therapy
and imipramine, respectively (5); a history of early childhood
trauma and better response to a cognitive-behavioral analysis
system of psychotherapy compared with nefazodone (6);
being married, being unemployed, experiencing a greater
number of recent life events, or prior treatment with anti-
depressants associated with superior improvement with
cognitive therapy compared with pharmacotherapy (7, 8);
and psychomotor activation predicting better overall out-
come with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
compared with interpersonal therapy (9).

ARTICLES
 Studies of biological measures predicting outcomes in
depression have primarily been conducted in studies of a
single treatment modality (10). Though valuable, these
studies do not inform clinicians about which treatment is
likely to be better or worse for a given patient, necessary in-
formation for clinical decision making. An exception to this
uncertainty was a recent positron emission tomography (PET)
study, which found that metabolic activity in the right anterior
insula differentially predicted treatment outcomes in patients
with major depression treated with the SSRI escitalopram or
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (11, 12). However, this
finding awaits replication and formal experimental testing.
In the absence of useful treatment-prediction moderators
for major depression, treatment guidelines recommend that
patient preferences be considered for making treatment rec-
ommendations (1). Surveys of treatment- and non-treatment-
seeking depressed patients have found that roughly 70%
express a preference for psychotherapy over medication (13).
Therelativepreferenceforpsychotherapymaybeevengreater
among ethnic minority groups, including Latinos (14) and
African Americans (15), although these conclusions remain
uncertain. In contrast, preference for medication has been
associated with greater severity of illness (16).
Most randomized trials evaluating the effects of patient
preference for medication or psychotherapy treatment have
found no effect of preference on treatment efficacy (17), al-
though two meta-analyses that examined the effects of
preference across all studies (not limited to randomized tri-
als) found a small effect of better outcomes among patients
receiving their preferred treatment (18, 19). Treatment
dropout or attrition is another important outcome related to
preferences, with meta-analyses demonstrating that patients
who do not receive their preferred treatment are more likely
to terminate care prematurely (19).
An important potential confound for prediction medicine
and the impact of preference on outcomes is patients’ prior
lifetime treatment exposures (20). Prior treatment may in-
troduce a selection bias in that patients’ willingness to par-
ticipate in a randomized trial comparing active treatments
might be affected by their prior experience with a particular
treatment. A second, and highly salient, concern for personal-
ized interventions is the possibility of persisting psychological
(21, 22) or biological (23, 24) effects from previous treatments
that affect response to treatments in a randomized trial. These
considerations emphasize the value of treatment-naive patient
samples for examining the effects of patient preferences and
biological variables in predicting treatment outcomes.
To address the need for personalized medicine approaches
for major depression, we conducted the Emory Predictors of
Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treat-
ments (PReDICT) study that aimed to identify patient-level
biological and psychological factors that predict short- and
long-term outcomes to three differing treatments: CBT,
escitalopram, and duloxetine, a serotonin norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). To minimize confounding of as-
sociations between treatments and outcomes that could arise
from patients’ prior treatment exposures, participation in this
trial was limited to treatment-naive patients with major
depressive disorder. Herein, we report the primary clinical
results from the initial 12-week randomized monotherapy
treatment phase, along with the effects of treatment preferences
on outcomes. Based on our prior work (25), we hypothesized
that there would be no effect of matching to preference on
depression symptom outcomes but that mismatched patients
would be more likely to terminate the trial prematurely.
METHOD
Study Overview
We previously published a detailed description of the PReDICT
study rationale, methods, and design (26). The study was
conducted through the Emory University Mood and Anxiety
Disorders Program and involved two clinics: 1) the primary
Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program Clinic at Emory Univer-
sity, including a satellite location in Stockbridge, Georgia, and 2)
a purely Spanish-speaking clinic at Grady Hospital in Atlanta
(27). The Emory Institutional Review Board and the Grady Hos-
pital Research Oversight Committee granted study approval.
Patients
Patients were recruited primarily through advertising, al-
though a minority of patients were referred from primary care
clinics. All patients provided written, informed consent prior
to beginning study procedures. The study enrolled men and
women, aged 18–65 years, who met DSM-IV criteria for
current major depressive disorder and who had never pre-
viously received treatment for a mood disorder. We defined
“previous treatment” as patient-reported treatment for major
depression, dysthymia, or depressive disorder not otherwise
specified with either 1) a marketed antidepressant at a mini-
mum effective dose for 4 or more consecutive weeks or 2) 4 or
more sessions of an evidence-based and structured psycho-
therapy for depression (i.e., CBT, behavior therapy, inter-
personal therapy, or behavioral marital therapy). Patients who
had received prior supportive therapy were eligible, but they
were not permitted to participate in such psychotherapy during
the study.
Eligible patients had a primary psychiatric diagnosis
of nonpsychotic major depressive disorder and a 17-item
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (28) total
score$18atscreeningand$15atthebaselinevisit.Exclusion
criteria included a lifetime history of bipolar disorder, primary
psychotic disorder, or dementia, or a current (past 12 months)
diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorder,
or dissociative disorder. Additionally, patients were excluded
if they met DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse within
3 months, substance dependence within 12 months of the
randomization visit, or if their urine tested positive for drugs
of abuse. Additional exclusionary criteria included any life-
time treatment with citalopram, escitalopram, or duloxetine.
Women who were, or planned on becoming, pregnant or
breast-feeding during the trial were excluded, as were any

 patients with significant uncontrolled medical conditions, or
any condition that could interfere with the study or the in-
terpretation of the study results.
Diagnostic and Outcome Measures and Procedures
The diagnosis of major depressive disorder was made using
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders
(29)andconfirmedthroughanevaluationbyastudypsychiatrist.
In addition to the HAM-D, depressive symptoms were
evaluated using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
Scale (MADRS) (30), and two patient self-report measures,
the Beck Depression Inventory-I (BDI) (31) and the Quick
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (32).

PATIENT PREFERENCES AND DEPRESSION TREATMENT OUTCOMES
 (HAM-A) (33). Demographic variables and family history of
psychiatric illness were collected via self-report.
Assessment of Preferences
As part of the informed consent process, patients read par-
agraphs describing the medication and CBT treatments used
in the study. The study physician also explained that, on
average, people with major depression are equally likely to
benefit from CBT or medication, and that the study’s goal was
to identify characteristics of individuals that could be used to
choose specific treatments for patients in the future. Patients
were informed that their preference would not influence the
treatment they received because treatment was assigned
randomlyand that in order to take part in the study they needed
to be willing to start the type of treatment assigned to them.
Preference was assessed by a single question asking patients if
their preferred treatment was: “no preference,” “cognitive
behavior therapy,” or “medication.” Those who expressed a
preference then indicated whether the strength of their
preference was “mild,” “moderate,” or “very strong” (25).
Randomization
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to one of three possible
treatments: 1) escitalopram 10–20 mg/day, 2) duloxetine
30–60 mg/day, or 3) CBT, 16 individual sessions. In order to
ensure equal allocation across treatment groups, prior to
opening the study for enrollment, the treatment assignment
was generated using randomized permuted blocks. Separate
randomization blocks were stratified for the English- and
Spanish-language clinics. The treatment assignments were
placed in sealed opaque envelopes by Emory employees
uninvolved in the study. At a patient’s baseline visit, after the
study psychiatrist confirmed that all eligibility criteria for
randomization had been met, within the patient’s clinic the
study coordinator opened the next-in-sequence envelope to
determine the treatment assignment.
Study Visits and Treatments
After randomization, patients returned at weeks 1–6, 8, 10,
and 12 to complete the symptom rating scales conducted by
trained raters blind to treatment assignment, self-reports,
andabriefassessmentbyastudyphysician.Spanish-speaking
raters and physicians also performed assessments at the
English-speaking site in order to enhance treatment and
assessment consistency. Patients received gift cards worth
approximately $5.00 per visit to offset travel-related costs.
Patients who did notachieve remission (defined below)at the
end of week 12 were eligible to enter a 12-week combined
treatment phase, in which combined psychotherapy and
medication was provided; results of this phase of the study
will be reported in a subsequent article.
Pharmacotherapy. Study medications were compounded in
the Emory Investigational Drug Service pharmacy and
contained the equivalent of either 10 mg of escitalopram
or 30 mg of duloxetine. Patients randomly assigned to
medication were started on one capsule per day, and if the
patient had not meaningfully improved by week 4, the dose
was increased to two capsules once daily, though the treating
psychiatrist could raise the dose at week 3 if deemed clin-
ically necessary. If the response to treatment plateaued
during the trial, or if remission was not achieved by week 6,
an increase to two capsules per day was required. If adverse
events were sufficiently distressing to the patient, the dose was
reverted to one capsule per day. To assess adherence, serum
concentrations of escitalopram and duloxetine were measured
atweek12.Theweek-12samplewasalsotestedforthepresence
of 10 other antidepressants to ensure that patients were not
surreptitiously using other antidepressants.
CBT. Doctoral-level and experienced master’s-level providers
trained in the specific CBT protocol for the study provided
the therapy utilizing a standardized treatment protocol
(34). To complete the 16 visits during the 12 weeks of in-
tervention, patients randomly assigned to CBT met with
their therapist twice per week for the first 4 weeks and then
weekly for the remaining 8 weeks, though some flexibility in
the timing of visits was permitted when necessary. Therapist
supervision occurred weekly, sessions were videotaped, and
competencywasrated,usingtheCognitiveTherapyScale(35),
by the Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and the Academy
of Cognitive Therapy. Anytime a session score dropped below
40, the session was reviewed in weekly supervision with the
therapist and additional training was undertaken to assure
improvement and continued scores above 40.
Concomitant Medications
Medications used to manage acute chronic medical condi-
tions were permitted. Patients were not permitted to use
other psychoactive medications, with the exception of hyp-
notics,whichwerepermitteduptothreetimesperweek when
requested by patients.

 Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared across treatment
groups using one-way analyses of variance for continuous
variables and chi-square for categorical variables. For treat-
ment outcomes, three analysis sets were defined. The primary
analysis for this article was the change in HAM-D score,
performed on the intent-to-treat population, defined as all
randomly assigned patients. Change in HAM-D score over the
course of treatment was modeled using a linear-mixed model,
with time as a continuous predictor (growth curve model) and
individual-level random effects for both intercept (initial de-
pression severity) and slope (change in depression severity
over time). The effects of interest were the treatment group-
by-time interactions. Main and interaction effects of clinic
(Spanish versus English language) were tested, as well as time,
treatment group, and time-by-treatment group interactions.
Similar models were developed to assess change in scores on
the MADRS, BDI, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptom-
atology, Self-Report, and HAM-A.
Secondarily, for the purpose of assessing categorical out-
comes, we used a last observation carried forward data set,
defined as all randomly assigned patients who initiated
treatment and had at least one follow-up rating assessment.
Four mutually exclusive categorical outcomes were defined
based on the last valid HAM-D rating: 1) nonresponse: ,30%
reduction from baseline; 2) partial response: 30%249% re-
duction from baseline; 3) response without remission: $50%
reduction from baseline, but HAM-D score .7; and 4) re-
mission: HAM-D score #7. For these outcomes, we tested for
clinic-by-treatment group interactions.
Because the PReDICT study was designed to identify
biomarkers predictive of treatment outcome, we also analyzed
a per-protocol completer data set. This sample comprised
randomly assigned patients who met all inclusion/exclusion

 criteria, had no major protocol violations, completed the
12 weeks of treatment, and whose week-12 pharmacokinetic
measures did not contradict the randomized treatment as-
signment (i.e., patients assigned to medication who had no
detectabledrug,orthoseassignedtoCBTwhohadadetectable
antidepressant at week 12). Categorical outcomes in the per-
protocol sample employed the same definitions as the last
observation carried forward sample, with the exception that
remission was defined as a HAM-D score #7 at both weeks
10 and 12 (the a priori definition specified in the protocol).
For testing predictors of remission and completion, we
performed two sets of analyses for each outcome: a set with
each measure as a predictor of remission (main effect) and
another set testing each measure as a possible moderator
of the remission effect (simultaneous main and interaction
effects). All analyses were performed using logistic regres-
sion with a similar structure. However, the effects of pref-
erence and preference matching on remission were assessed
using logistic regression with targeted coding of the base-
line groups, reflecting the fact that both preference and
preference matching were also treatment specific. To assess
odds of remission in various preference groups, appropriate
frequency weights were used to account for the fact that the
probability of amatch was not thesame in the medication and
CBT groups.
RESULTS

in Figure S1 in the data supplement accompanying the on-
line version of this article. Five hundred fifteen individuals
consented to participate in the trial, and 344 were randomly
assigned: 114 to escitalopram, and 115 each to the CBT and
duloxetine arms. Twenty-eight patients did not return for a
postrandomization assessment, and thus the last observation
carried forward data set comprised 316 patients; 234 met all
criteria for inclusion in the per-protocol completer sample.
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics of the
randomized sampleare summarized in Table 1. Demographic
characteristics did not differ between the treatment groups.
The only clinical characteristic that significantly differed
between the groups was age at onset, which was slightly
younger in the duloxetine group. The mean HAM-D score
indicated moderate severity (mean=19.8 [SD=3.8]), and more
than half (52%) of the participants were in their first major
depressive episode. Hispanic participants were more socio-
economically disadvantaged than blackor white participants,
with lowerlevels of full-timeemployment andeducation, and
were less likely to have private insurance.
Of the 344 randomly assigned patients, 21 (6.1%) had pre-
viously received an antidepressant medication of inadequate
dose or duration to meet our definition of previous treatment.
Seventy-eight (22.3%) reported receiving anon-evidence-based
psychotherapeutic intervention or ,4 sessions of an evidence-
based psychotherapy for depression. Among patients having
had prior psychotherapy, 43.8% (32/73) remitted compared
with 48.9% (119/243) of those who had not (x2=0.593, df=1,
p=0.441). Remission rates also did not significantly differ be-
tween patients with (5/20, 25%) and without (146/296, 49.3%)
prior antidepressant exposure (x2=3.52, df=1, p=0.061). Simi-
larly, treatment completion was unrelated to prior psycho-
therapy (p=0.98) or antidepressant exposure (p=0.107).

 Scale scores were above 40 for all therapists except two
whose average was just slightly below 40. Of the nine sched-
uled pharmacotherapy visits for medication-treated patients,
the mean number of visits attended was 8.2 (SD=2.0) for the
medication-treated intent-to-treat sample and 8.9 (SD=0.4) for
thecompletersample.Themeanescitalopramdoseatendpoint
was 16.2 mg/day (SD=5.1), and 16.9 mg/day (SD=4.5) at week
12 for completers. The mean duloxetine dose at endpoint
was 48.0 mg/day (SD=15.0), and 49.6 mg/day (SD=14.1) for
completers. Among the drug-treated completers, 80% re-
ceiving escitalopram were titrated to 20 mg/day, and 71%
of duloxetine-treated patients were titrated to 60 mg/day
at some point during the 12 weeks. The mean serum drug
concentrations at endpoint were 30.9 ng/ml (SD=19.7) for
escitalopram and 44.6 ng/ml (SD=59.1) for duloxetine. Sed-
ative medications were used by 22.4% of the CBT and
duloxetine groups and by 25.4% of the escitalopram group;
these counts did not significantly differ (x2=0.48, p=0.79).
Per-Protocol Completion Rates
Patients randomly assigned to CBT were less likely to be per-
protocol completers than patients in either of the medication
groups (CBT: 60.0%; escitalopram: 75.4%; duloxetine: 68.7%,
x2=6.31, df=2, p=0.043). Per-protocol completers, compared
withnoncompleters,hadlowerdepressionseverity(HAM-D:
mean=19.2 [SD=3.5] compared with mean=21.1 [SD=4.0]) and
lower anxiety (HAM-A: mean=15.4 [SD=4.7] compared with
mean=17.4 [SD=5.9]) at baseline.
Outcomes
There were no significant clinic-by-treatment group inter-
actions on HAM-D, and thus clinic effects were removed
from the presented models. The mean estimated overall
improvement on the primary outcome of the HAM-D was
10.9 pointsfor the intent-to-treat sample, which didnot differ
significantly across the three groups (CBT: 10.2; escitalo-
pram: 11.1; duloxetine: 11.2; F=0.53, df=2, 257, p=0.589).
Among completers, the mean reduction in HAM-D score
was 10.5, which also did not significantly differ between the
CBT (mean=9.8), escitalopram (mean=11.1), and duloxetine
(mean=10.7)groups(F=0.88,df=2,231,p=0.415).Therawdata
means over time for the three treatment arms are shown in
Figure 1; there was no significant time-by-treatment inter-
action, indicating the change over time did not differ across
treatments. The rates of remission and response by treatment
group are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. Among the
last observation carried forward sample, 47.8% remitted and
an additional 12.3% achieved response without remission.
Among completers, 46.6% remitted and another 21.4%
achieved response without remission. Remission rates did
not significantly differ between treatment arms in either the
last observation carried forward (CBT: 41.9%; escitalopram:
46.7%; duloxetine: 54.7%; x2=3.55, df=2, p=0.170) or per-
protocol (CBT: 43.5%; escitalopram: 44.2%; duloxetine:
51.9%; x2=1.36, df=2, p=0.507) samples.
The modeled outcomes for each of the four depression
scales and for the HAM-A are presented in Table S1 in the
online data supplement. The primary result of no significant
difference between the treatment groups in mean change on
the HAM-D was replicated for the MADRS, Quick Inventory
of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report, and BDI. Mean
change on the HAM-A also did not significantly differ be-
tween the treatment arms.
Effect of Preferences on Outcomes
Preference data were obtained for 341 (99.1%) of the patients,
of whom 225 (66%) expressed a treatment preference (CBT:
N=121 [35.5%]; medication: N=104 [30.5%]). The 28 patients
who did not return after randomization did not significantly
differfromtherestofthesampleintheirexpressedtreatment
preferences and were excluded from the outcome analyses.
Treatment preferences did not differ between patients
with and without private insurance (Pearson x2=0.254,
p=0.88), but white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and
Hispanic patients did significantly differ in their treatment
preferences. In contrast to white non-Hispanic patients, who
showed roughly equal distribution across the no-, CBT-, and
medication-preference options, nearly one-half (47.5%) of
black non-Hispanic patients preferred CBT, and few (19.8%)
Hispanics preferred medication (Figure 2). The preference
differences across the groups was statistically significant
(x2=17.16, df=4, p=0.002). The numbers of patients matched
versus mismatched within each level of preference strength
were as follows: mild: N=26 compared with N=24; moderate:

 N=54comparedwithN=53;verystrong:N=26comparedwith
N=40, respectively. Strength of preference did not differ be-
tween those preferring CBT compared with those preferring
medication (Z=21.74, p=0.08).
Preferred treatment type did not significantly predict
completion across the medication-, CBT-, and no-preference
groups (completion rates: 77.9%, 71.9%, and 69.8%, respec-
tively; x2=1.93, df=2, p=0.38). However, among those
expressingapreference,thecompletionratewassignificantly
higher among those matched compared with those mis-
matched to their preferred treatment (82.2% compared with
67.8%, respectively, x2=6.19, df=1, p=0.013). This differential
completion rate among matched and mismatched patients
wasdrivenbythosewithmoderateorverystrongpreferences
(mild: x2=0.42, p=0.517; moderate: x2=4.24, p=0.039; very
strong: x2=3.13, p=0.077) (Figure 3). There was also a main
effect of baseline HAM-D severity on completion rates
(greater severity among those less likely to complete:
p=0.016), but this effect did not significantly differ between
those matched compared with those mismatched to their
preferred treatment (interaction effect: p=0.154).
Of the 225 patients expressing a preference, 107 (47.6%)
were matched to their preferred treatment, and 118 (52.4%)
were mismatched. Last observation carried forward out-
comes were available for 207 of the 225 patients who
expressed a preference. Having any preference was associ-
ated with a non-significantly lower likelihood of remission on
the HAM-D (odds ratio=0.74, p=0.31), which was similar
among those preferring CBT (odds ratio=0.72) or medication
(odds ratio=0.76) (Table 4). Being randomly assigned to the
preferred treatment did not significantly increase the overall
remission rate (odds ratio=1.42, p=0.31) or the remission rate
specific to CBT or medication (Table 4 [also see Table S2 in
the online data supplement]). Strength of preference also did
not significantly affect remission rates (mild: 56.3%; mod-
erate: 41%; very strong: 45.6%, x2=3.04, df=2, p=0.22). As
shown in Figure 3, remission rates among matched and
mismatchedpatientsdidnotsignificantlydifferbystrengthof
preference (mild: x2=2.93, p=0.09; moderate: x2=0.077,
p=0.78; very strong: x2=0.102, p=0.24).
Other Clinical Predictors of Outcomes
The logistic regression analyses of other clinical and socio-
demographic variables found that baseline depression
severity (HAM-D), baseline anxiety (HAM-A), and presence
of a current anxiety disorder all predicted lower likelihood of
remission in both the completer and last observation carried
forward samples, but age, gender, race, chronicity, employ-
ment, marital status, and chronicity of episode did not (see
Tables S3 and S4 in the online data supplement). Completion
rates were also predicted by baseline depression and anxi-
ety severity, with the additional finding that minority race/
ethnicity patients were significantly less likely to complete
the study than white patients (African American: 65.6%;
Hispanic:66.7%;Caucasian:82.1%)(seeTableS5intheonline
data supplement). None of these analyses identified a sta-
tistically significant moderator of remission or completion
between the three treatment groups.
DISCUSSION
This study represents the largest randomized clinical trial, to
our knowledge, conducted at a single institution in patients
with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, none of the
patients had ever previously received a minimally adequate
course of an evidence-based treatment. Among the 344 ran-
domly assigned patients, the average benefit from 12 weeks
of treatment with CBT, escitalopram, or duloxetine did not
meaningfully differ in terms of mean change in symptom
severity or proportion of patients achieving remission.
These results are consistent with other studies of depression
that have reported roughly equivalent mean outcomes with
evidence-based psychotherapy and medication treatments
(36–40).
We found that patients matched to their preferred
treatment did not achieve remission significantly more fre-
quentlythanmismatchedpatients.Thisabsence ofdifference
in remission occurred despite a significantly higher rate of
treatment completion among the matched patients. These
results replicate a similarly designed randomized trial that
compared escitalopram and CBT among previously treated
patients (22). The results of these two trials, considered along
with similar results from other large trials (16, 37, 38, 41–44),
suggest that overall remission rates are roughly equivalent
regardless of preference matching, even if dropout is greater
among mismatched patients. However, retention itself is
an important outcome of relevance, particularly for pa-
tients with chronic forms of depression. We found a clinically

 meaningful number needed to treat for increasing completion
(6.94 for matched compared with mismatched patients).
Thus, until better predictors of remission probability are
identified (as reported in our companion study to the pre-
sent article [see reference 45]), there may be value in using
patient preferences to select initial treatments, particularly
for those with moderate or strong preferences.
Consistent with other reports, we found that Hispanic
and black non-Hispanic patients had treatment preferences
that differed from white non-Hispanic patients (14, 15).
Specifically, black patients were significantly more likely to
prefer psychotherapy, and few Hispanic patients preferred
medication.
The impact of matching to preference on the outcome of
attrition is less clear.Consistentwithpriorwork (44),wefound
that patients were more likely to complete the trial if they were
matchedtotheirtreatmentpreference,thoughothers havenot
found this effect (42, 46–48). Previous findings (25, 49) that
preferencefor medication treatment (regardless of treatment
received) predicted attrition were not replicated in the
current analysis. The inconsistent results across studies
may derive from differences in socioeconomic status or
prior treatment experiences of the samples enrolled.
Other investigators have reported that preferences may
affect indirect measures of outcome, such as treatment en-
gagement (50), adherence (43), and working alliance. Of
these, only the association between preference and strength
of therapeutic alliance has been replicated across studies (44,
50, 51). These results suggest that patients who receive their
preferred treatment may invest more fully in their treatment,
which makes the finding that preference does not affect
improvement all the more striking. This discrepancy implies
that biological or psychosocial factors are stronger deter-
minants of treatment efficacy than patient preference.
Strengths of the study include the large number of ran-
domly assigned patients within a single institution, thereby
minimizing confounding arising from potentially differing
applications of treatments across study sites (52). The gen-
eralizability to the broader population of major depression
patients would appear to be strong, given the diverse racial
and ethnic composition of our sample. Because the PReDICT
study enrolled treatment-naive patients, preferences were
not influenced by prior treatment experiences, though this
may limit generalization to patients with prior treatment
experiences. The CBT treatment was delivered with high
fidelity; however, dissemination may be hampered by the
limited availability and quality of systematic CBT in com-
munity settings (53). The completion rate in the CBT arm
(60%) was on the lower end of the range of psychotherapy
arm completion rates from other large medication versus
psychotherapy trials (55%287%) (36–40). The completion
rate across the two medication arms was 72%, similar to the
rates observed in other trials (56%289%) (36–40).
A potential limitation is that the maximum dose of
duloxetine used was 60 mg/day; higher doses are often used
in clinical practice, which suggests that the full efficacy of
duloxetine may not have been detected. Another limitation,
which is unavoidable in psychotherapy versus medication
trials, is that patients were not blind to their treatment as-
signment and that CBT patients had substantially greater
contact with the treatment providers. The majority of the
randomly assigned patients were recruited through adver-
tising, which may limit generalizability to spontaneously
treatment-seeking samples. Other limitations to generaliz-
ability include the exclusion of patients with mild depressive
symptoms or concomitant substance use disorders and those
with very strong treatment preferences who were unwilling
toberandomlyassigned.Becausemanypatientsexpressedno
treatment preference, our analyses of the impact of prefer-
ence on outcomes were underpowered, and larger samples
might have detected statistically significant effects. Without
a “patient’s choice” treatment arm, we could not address
whether receiving one’s preferred treatment by choice,
rather than by chance via randomization, would have led to
improved outcomes. Assessing patients prior to randomi-
zation about their ambivalence toward continuing in treat-
ment, particularly if they experienced side effects or minimal
early improvement, may have informed the treatment dis-
continuation analyses (54).
There are two important implications of our results that
can inform treatment guidelines. First, guideline recom-
mendations that psychotherapy or antidepressant medica-
tions are equallyappropriatefor theinitialtreatmentof major
depression can be extended to treatment-naive patients.
Second, because ethnic minorities comprised more than one-
half of our study’s population, these treatment recommen-
dations can be extended with confidence beyond the white
non-Hispanic population, who comprised the majority of all
prior randomized treatment studies comparing pharmaco-
therapy with psychotherapy.
In contrast to the finding that no clinical or socio-
demographic variables significantly moderated differential
remissionratesinthePReDICTstudy,ourneuroimagingdata
have proven to have predictive value. In the companion study
to this article, we report that resting-state functional con-
nectivity predicted remission and nonresponse rates with
roughly 80% accuracy (45). This finding is consistent with
our prior PET study that also found anterior insula metab-
olism to predict symptomatic outcomes among CBT- and
SSRI-treated patients (11, 12). Other biological assessments
examined to date in the PReDICT data set have not proven to
serve as moderators of outcomes. Pharmacokinetic analyses
and an ex-vivo assay measuring the degree of inhibition of
the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters were not
predictive of outcomes among the medication-treated
patients (55). We also found that hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis sensitivity, as measured by the dexamethasone-
corticotropin-releasing hormone test, did not moderate
remission outcomes (56). Given the poor replication of
demographic and clinical moderators of outcomes to medi-
cation compared with psychotherapy treatments, the ad-
