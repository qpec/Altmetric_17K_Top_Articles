Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells provide the first line of defense against malaria parasite infection.
However, the molecular mechanisms through which NK cells are activated by parasites are
largely unknown, so is the molecular basis underlying the variation in NK cell responses to
malaria infection in the human population. Here, we compared transcriptional profiles of
responding and non-responding NK cells following exposure to Plasmodium-infected red
blood cells (iRBCs) and identified MDA5, a RIG-I-like receptor involved in sensing cytosolic
RNAs, to be differentially expressed. Knockout of MDA5 in responding human NK cells by
CRISPR/cas9 abolished NK cell activation, IFN-γ secretion, lysis of iRBCs. Similarly, inhibi-
tion of TBK1/IKKε, an effector molecule downstream of MDA5, also inhibited activation of
responding NK cells. Conversely, activation of MDA5 by liposome-packaged poly I:C
restored non-responding NK cells to lyse iRBCs. We further show that microvesicles con-
taining large parasite RNAs from iRBCs activated NK cells by fusing with NK cells. These
findings suggest that NK cells are activated through the MDA5 pathway by parasite RNAs
that are delivered to the cytoplasm of NK cells by microvesicles from iRBCs. The difference
in MDA5 expression between responding and non-responding NK cells following exposure
to iRBCs likely contributes to the variation in NK cell responses to malaria infection in the
human population.

 Author summary
Malaria is an important parasitic disease with a major public health concern. Malaria
pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between parasitic and host factors. A better
understanding of early host response and the determinants of immunity are essential to
developing innovative therapeutic approaches. Natural killer (NK) cells are important
immune cells in protection against malaria infection but show significant differences in
their responses in the human population. Here we analyze the differences between human
NK cells that respond to and don’t respond to malaria infection. We found that human
NK cells that respond to malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBC) have higher levels of a
pathogen recognition receptor, MDA5. This receptor is activated by small vesicles released
from iRBC. By activating MDA5 with a small molecule agonist, we can improve non-
responder NK cells to clear iRBC. Our study provides new insights into the mechanism by
which NK cells control malaria infection and possible NK cell-based intervention of
malaria infection in human.
Introduction
Human malaria is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, and of which, P. falciparum
causes most cases of severe malaria. The host innate immune system is the first line of defense
against Plasmodium infection, and the outcome of early host-parasite interaction is a strong
determinant for later immunopathology and adaptive immune responses [1]. Natural killer
(NK) cells, a key cell type of innate immunity, play a critical role in limiting acute malaria
infection by both cell-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ secretion [2]. In murine models,
malaria infection leads to a rapid proliferation of NK cells [3], and depletion of NK cells results
in higher parasitemia and accelerated disease progression [4–6]. In malaria-infected children,
elevated NK cell counts and increased NK cell cytotoxicity are correlated with lower parasite-
mia [7]. Similarly, elevated NK cell counts are observed in adult malaria patients [8]. NK cells
can directly lyse Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) [9, 10] and are also one of the
earliest sources of IFN-γ and soluble granzyme following experimental infection of malaria-
naïve volunteers with P. falciparum [11]. Furthermore, a single P. falciparum challenge is suffi-
cient to induce lasting NK cell responses [12].
Innate immune cells, such as NK cells, recognize pathogens through pattern-recognition
receptors (PRR). Studies have shown that activation of human macrophages and dendritic
cells (DCs) by iRBCs requires Toll-like receptors (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), which
includes RIG-1, MDA5, and LGP2. Engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 by P. falciparum glycosyl-
phosphatidylinositol (GPI) stimulates macrophages and DCs to secrete TNF-α [13, 14]. Para-
sitic DNA and RNA also activate DCs via TLR9 [15] and MDA5 [16], respectively. In contrast,
TLRs are individually dispensable for NK cell responses to malaria infection in mice [17].
Although NKp30 has been shown to bind PfEMP1 [18], the role of PfEMP1 in NK cell activa-
tion remains controversial because NK cells can still be activated by parasite that does not
express surface PfEMP1 [19] and blocking of NKp30, NKp44 or NKp46 with antibodies does
not affect NK cell control of parasitemia in vitro [10]. To date, human NK cell activation by
iRBCs was shown to require cell-cell contact involving cell adhesion molecules such as LFA-1
[10], but the nature and identity of parasite molecular pattern and the specific PRR involved
are largely unknown.
Interestingly, NK cell responses to malaria infection vary significantly in the human popu-
lation. For example, one study reported an average of 2.4% of NK cells are IFN-γ-positive in

 mild malaria patients [8], whereas a different study reported an average of 14% of IFN-γ-posi-
tive NK cells [12]. Variations in NK cell responses to iRBCs in vitro are also observed. Based
on percentages of NK cells that express IFN-γ, donors have been classified as responders or
non-responders [20]. The observed heterogeneity in NK cell responses to malaria infection has
been attributed to differences in NK cell receptor expression, such as killer cell immunoglobu-
lin-like receptors (KIR) [20], and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol use [21, 22].
The molecular basis underlying the variations of NK cell responses to malaria infection has
not been fully investigated.
In this study, we investigated the nature and identity of parasite component and NK cell
receptor that are involved in human NK cell responses to malaria infection. By comparing
gene expression between NK cells from responders and non-responders, we identified MDA5,
an RLR for sensing cytosolic RNA, as being differentially expressed. MDA5 is critical for NK
cell responses to malaria infection as inhibition of MDA5 in responder NK cells abolishes NK
cell responses to iRBCs and activation of MDA5 in non-responder NK cells restores NK cell
responses to iRBCs. We further show that RNA-containing microvesicles released from iRBCs
can activate NK cells by fusing with NK cells. Our study thus shows that parasite RNA-con-
taining microvesicles from iRBCs and MDA5 in NK cells are involved in NK cell sensing of
malaria infection and activation of NK cell responses. The difference in MDA5 expression
between NK cells from responders and non-responders is likely a significant factor that con-
tributes to the variation in NK cell responses to malaria infection in the human population.
Results
NK cell responses to iRBCs are heterogeneous in human population
In our study of NK cell responses to iRBCs, we noticed differences in the control of parasite-
mia by NK cells from different individuals. In our assay, purified human NK cells (>95%)
from malaria-naïve individuals were co-cultured with 3D7 strain of P. falciparum infected-
RBCs at a starting parasitemia of 0.5%. As shown in Fig 1A, parasitemia reached ~12% by 96 h
without NK cells. In the presence of NK cells from one donor, the parasitemia was only ~2%,
whereas in the presence of NK cells from a different donor, the parasitemia was ~10%. To
compare parasitemia across different experiments with NK cells from different individuals, we
calculated percentage of parasitemia reduction as [(parasitemia without NK cells–parasitemia
with NK cells) / parasitemia without NK cells] x 100 (see Materials and Methods) and defined
individuals whose NK cells reduced parasitemia by more than 50% as responders and those
whose NK cells reduced parasitemia by less than 50% as non-responders. On average,
responder NK cells (R-NK) reduced parasitemia from 13.5±6.6% to 3.5±1.8% (p<0.0001,
n = 19) (Fig 1B), corresponding to a parasitemia reduction of 71±7.4% (n = 19) (Fig 1C),
whereas non-responder NK cells (NR-NK) reduced parasitemia from 11.5±5.6% to 9.6±4.9%
(p = 0.07, n = 12) (Fig 1B), corresponding to a parasitemia reduction of 25±17% (n = 12,
p<0.0001) (Fig 1C). Similar levels of R-NK cells (49.9±3.4%, n = 15) and NR-NK cells (48.4
±2.5%, n = 15, p>0.05) were alive after 96 h in the co-cultures (Fig 1D), suggesting that the
observed difference in parasitemia is not due to difference in the survival of R-NK and NR-NK
cells during the assay.
NK cell activation was assessed by assaying expression of activation markers CD69, CD25,
and CD107a. Following co-culture with iRBC for 96 h, NK cells were activated to express
CD69 and CD107a (Fig 1E–1G, S1 Table) but the percentages of CD69-positive or CD107a-
positive NK cells were significantly higher from responders than non-responders as indicated
by log2 fold changes (Fig 1I). CD25 was only significantly induced on R-NK cells, but not on
NR-NK cells, following co-culture with iRBC (Fig 1E and 1H, S1 Table). No significant

 changes in expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 was
observed when R-NK and NR-NK cells were co-cultured with iRBC as compared to RBC
(S1A–S1C Fig). Of the C-type lectin receptors, both NKG2A and CD94 were significantly
upregulated on NK cells following co-culture with iRBC, but there was no difference between
responder and non-responder NK cells (S1D and S1E Fig, and S1 Table). No significant differ-
ence in expression of NKG2C and NKG2D was observed when R-NK and NR-NK cells were
co-cultured with iRBC versus RBC (S1F and S1G Fig). Similarly, no significant difference in
expression of the adhesion molecules, such as 2B4, CD36, CD11a, CD18, DNAM-1, and CD2,
was observed (S1H–S1M Fig).
NK cell function was examined by assaying for expression of effector molecules granulysin,
IFN-γ, and perforin by intracellular staining. R-NK cells significantly upregulated expression
of granulysin and IFN-γ, but not perforin, following co-culture with iRBC but not with RBC
for 96 h (Fig 1J–1M, S1 Table). No significant increase in expression of granulysin, IFN-γ and
perforin were observed when NR-NK cells were co-cultured with iRBC as compared to RBC.
Cytokines in culture supernatants at 48 h following iRBC co-culture was measured by multi-
plex immunoassay. IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-8 were consistently detected, while
IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33 were below the 2.5 pg/ml detec-
tion limit (Fig 1N). Of these cytokines, only IFN-γ levels were significantly higher in R-NK cell
cultures (3312±1972pg/ml, n = 19) compared to NR-NK cell cultures (254±177pg/ml, n = 12,
p<0.0001).
To verify the observed heterogeneity of NK cell responses, we further tested R-NK and
NR-NK cells on three different strains of P. falciparum parasites–HB2 (isolated in Honduras),
T994 (isolated in Thailand) and W2mef (isolated from Indochina). As shown in Fig 1O,
regardless of the parasite strain, R-NK cells consistently reduced parasitemia by 50–88%, while
NR-NK cells only reduced parasitemia by 6–46% (S2 Table). Collectively, these results show
the heterogeneity of NK responses to iRBCs among different individuals in the human popula-
tion, corroborating with a previous report [20].
Low NK cell responses are associated with severe malaria
To investigate the clinical relevance of our observation, we purified NK cells from patients
with uncomplicated malaria (UM) and severe malaria (SM) and performed in vitro iRBC kill-
ing assay. NK cells from UM patients reduced parasitemia by 76.0±16% (n = 13), while NK
cells from SM patients reduced parasitemia by 60±23% (n = 12) (p = 0.0464) (Fig 1P). The four
donors of non-responder NK cells that reduced parasitemia by less than 50% were all from the
SM patients. Although the sample size of the current study was small and further studies are
required to firmly establish the association between NK cell activity and disease severity, the
preliminary results are consistent with an association between low NK cell response and severe
malaria [7, 23].

 NK cell responses to iRBCs involve pathogen pattern recognition receptors
To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying NK cell responses to iRBC between
responders and non-responders, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling analy-
sis. NK cells from five different responders and five different non-responders were individually
co-cultured with either iRBC or RBC for 96 h. NK cells were purified by cell sorting from the
four different cultures: R-NK + iRBC (R-iRBC), R-NK + RBC (R-RBC), NR-NK + iRBC (NR-
iRBC), and NR-NK + RBC (NR-RBC), for RNA extraction. Gene expression microarray was
performed using HumanHT-12 v4 Expression Beadchip (Illumina), which has 47321 probes
targeting about 31000 annotated genes.
To determine if gross transcriptional differences existed between the groups, we performed
sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) [24]. Delineation of population
relationships with the top two principle components (PC) showed segregation of R-iRBC
group from the other three groups (Fig 2A). Next, we performed a comprehensive pairwise
comparison of each group to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups by
linear modeling with a false discovery rate of 5% [25]. A total of 64 DEGs was identified (Fig
2B). 59 DEGs were identified between R-NK cells co-cultured with either iRBC or RBC (R-
iRBC vs R-RBC) (S3 Table). 50 DEGS were identified between R-NK and NR-NK cells co-cul-
tured with iRBC (R-iRBC vs NR-iRBC) (S4 Table). Between these two comparisons, 45 DEGs
were shared. No DEGs were identified between R-NK and NR-NK cells co-cultured with RBC.
Similarly, no DEGs were identified between NR-NK co-cultured with either iRBC or RBC.
To visualize the magnitude of expression of each DEG across samples, z-scores were com-
puted [26]. A heatmap was generated using the derived z-scores with corresponding dendro-
grams for samples and genes derived via hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance (Fig
2C). Hierarchical clustering across all samples showed that the samples can be classified into
two main groups corresponding to R-iRBC vs the other three groups. Notably, apart from
EIF3L, whose expression was lower in NK cells from R-iRBC samples, all the other DEGs had
higher expression in NK cells from R-iRBC samples.
We performed functional network-based analysis of the DEGs using ConsensusPathDB
[27] to identify pathways in which the DEGs could potentially be involved in. The top 10 path-
ways identified were primarily involved in immune responses and pathogen recognition (Fig
2D). We focused on PRR pathways as they are likely involved in NK cell interactions with
iRBCs. The top PRR pathway identified was the RLR signaling pathway. In addition, TRAF3-
and TRAF6-dependent pathways were also identified. As these pathways act downstream of
Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [28], it is possible that TLRs are involved in NK cell
responses to iRBCs.
MDA5 mediates NK cell responses to iRBCs
To investigate the role of RLR signaling pathway in NK cell response, we identified the DEGs
enriched in the RLR signaling pathway. Expression levels of these enriched DEGs were all con-
siderably higher in the R-iRBC group compared to the other three groups (Fig 3A). Of the
three known RLR (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) in cytosolic RNA sensing, only IFIH1 transcript,
which encodes MDA5, was significantly elevated. MDA5 protein level was also significantly
higher in R-NK than NR-NK cells following co-culture with iRBCs for 96 h (MFI: 433±93 vs
283±63, p = 0.004, n = 7) (Fig 3B & 3C).
To determine the requirement of MDA5 in NK cell control of parasitemia, we knocked
down MDA5 in primary NK cells from responders by lentiviral expression of CRISPR/Cas9
and a guide-RNA targeting either MDA5 (gMDA5) or a scramble sequence (gScrble). After 2
weeks of puromycin selection, MDA5 protein level was reduced by ~70% in NK cells

 transduced with gMDA5 as compared to NK cells transduced with gScrble by Western blot
analysis (Fig 3D). Following co-culture of transduced NK cells with iRBCs for 48 h, MDA5-
knocked down NK cells reduced parasitemia by 21±7% (n = 3) whereas gScrble-transduced
NK cells reduced parasitemia by 63±11% (n = 3, p<0.01) (Fig 3E & 3F), suggesting a require-
ment for MDA5 in mediating NK cell responses to iRBCs.
As a complementary approach, we tested the effect of the MDA5 agonist, lipofectamine-
packaged poly I:C on NK cells [29]. As shown in Fig 3G, at lipofectamine-poly I:C concentra-
tions of 10 μg/ml (900±125, n = 6, p = 0.0012) and 100 μg/ml (1271±317, n = 6, p = 0.0005)
CD69 expression on NK cells was significantly increased compared to lipofectamine treated

 controls (538±156, n = 6). However, despite the increase in CD69 expression, no significant
increase in IFN-γ secretion was detected at 100 μg/ml lipofectamine-poly I:C (421±366, n = 5,
p = 0.58) as compared to lipofectamine treated controls (310±120, n = 4) (Fig 3H). We further
evaluated whether NR-NK cell responses to iRBCs could be restored by activating MDA5.
Indeed, lipofectamine-packaged poly I:C enhanced NR-NK cell responses to iRBCs in a dose-
dependent manner, with significant parasitemia reduction observed at 10 μg/ml (37±11%,
n = 5, p = 0.02) and 100 μg/ml (48±7%, n = 5, p<0.005) (Fig 3I and 3J), whereas poly I:C with-
out lipofectamine-formulation did not. As a control, lipofectamine-formulated 5’pppRNA,
which activates RIG-I, did not induce any significant reduction of parasitemia (Fig 3K).
We also examined the effect of blocking TBK1/IKKε, which is a downstream effector mole-
cule in the MDA5 signaling pathway [30], on NK cell control of parasitemia. R-NK cells were
co-cultured with iRBCs in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor of TBK1/IKKε, Bx795
[31], for 96 h. Compared with 70±5.1% (n = 8) reduction in parasitemia in the absence of the
inhibitor, the parasitemia reduction was reduced to 28±14% (n = 8, p<0.001) in the presence
of Bx795 (Fig 4A & 4B). Bx795 also inhibited NK cell activation by iRBCs as CD69 expression
was significantly reduced from a MFI of 850±491 (n = 6) to 285±176 (n = 6, p = 0.02) (Fig 4C
& 4D) and the percentages of CD25 positive NK cells fell from 38.2±19.6% to 17.3±11.3%
(n = 8, p<0.001) (Fig 4E). IFN-γ secretion by NK cells was similarly reduced (3527±1070 pg/
ml vs 232±120 pg/ml, n = 4, p = 0.01) in the presence of Bx795 (Fig 4F). Together, these results
show that activation of MDA5 is required for NK cell responses to iRBCs.
Microvesicles from iRBCs activate NK cells via RLR pathway
MDA5 is a member of cytosolic RLR involved in RNA sensing. To identify the trigger for
MDA5 signaling in R-NK cells, we focused on RNA-containing microvesicles [32]. It had
been shown that iRBCs actively release microvesicles, especially late during schizont-stages
[33]. These microvesicles carry not only parasite-derived proteins [33] but also parasite
DNA and RNA [43]. We reasoned that microvesicles could deliver parasite RNAs to the
cytosol of NK cells to activate MDA5, similar to lipofectamine-packaged Poly I:C. To test
this hypothesis, we purified microvesicles from RBC and iRBC cultures and referred to
them as MVs or iMVs, respectively. iMVs were labeled with a lipophilic dye PKH26 and
added into R-NK cell culture at 1 μg/ml. After 24 h, 18.0±2.3% of NK cells were positive for
PKH26 (p<0.0001, n = 4) (Fig 5A & 5B). To further prove the uptake of iMVs by R-NK
cells, we stained R-NK cell membrane with a green lipophilic dye PKH67 and incubated
them with PKH26-stained iMVs for 24 h. Confocal microscopy and z-stack 3D volume ren-
dering showed that the PKH26-stained iMV (white arrow) was located within the confines
of the PKH67-stained NK cell membrane (Fig 5C), suggesting membrane fusion between
iMVs and NK cells.
Studies have shown that MDA5 can be activated by single-strand uncapped RNA [34], dou-
ble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of 3kb or larger [35], as well as viral mRNA [36]. To determine
the presence of large RNA species in iMVs, total RNA was extracted from both MVs and
iMVs. The capped RNA and uncapped 5’pppRNA and 5’ppRNA were separated by labeling
uncapped RNAs with desthiobiotin followed by streptavidin column [37]. The capped RNA
species and uncapped RNA were both reverse transcribed to cDNA, amplified and visualized
on an agarose gel. As shown in Fig 5D, very little if any uncapped 5’pppRNA and 5’ppRNA
were detected in either MVs or iMVs. In contrast, capped RNA with size as large as 8 kb was
readily detected in iMVs but not MVs. Consistent with recent results showing abundant RNA
species within iMVs [38, 39], our results show that iMVs contain large RNA species that could
be delivered to MDA5 in NK cells.

 To determine if iMVs activate NK cells, R-NK cells were cultured with RBCs, iRBCs, MVs,
and iMVs for 48 h and NK cell activation was measured by assaying for CD69 upregulation.
MFI of CD69 was increased significantly from 310±184 (n = 8) to 902±487 (n = 8, p<0.01)
when R-NK cells were co-cultured with RBCs and iRBCs, respectively (Fig 5E & 5F). No signif-
icant change in CD69 MFI was observed when R-NK cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml of
MVs (316±63, n = 3) or 1μg/ml of iMVs (323±204, n = 7). However, at 10 μg/ml of iMVs, MFI
of CD69 was significantly increased to 651±383 (n = 5). The observed activation of NK cells by
iMVs was inhibited by Bx795 as CD69 MFI was reduced from 700±155 in the absence of
Bx795 to 275±47 in the presence of Bx795 (n = 3, p = 0.04) (Fig 5G). However, iMVs failed to
induce significant production of IFN-γ by NK cells even at concentrations of 100 μg/ml (Fig
5H). These results suggest that iMVs can prime, but not fully activate, NK cells through the
MDA5-TBK1/IKKε pathway.
We have shown previously that LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) is involved in NK cell engagement
with iRBCs [10]. We determined if iMVs induce a conformational change in LFA-1 from low
affinity to either intermediate or high-affinity conformation. R-NK cells were cultured in the
presence of either MVs or iMVs at 10 μg/ml for 48 h and NK cells were stained with m24, an
anti-LFA-1 antibody that specifically binds to an epitope on LFA-1 that is only exposed in the
intermediate and high-affinity state [40]. Significantly higher percentages of NK cells were pos-
itive for m24 in the presence of iMVs (22.0±4.4%, n = 4) than in the presence of MVs (1.8
±0.7%, n = 4, p<0.0001) (Fig 5I and 5J). Thus, iMVs also induce a conformational change in
LFA-1 from a resting to a primed state on R-NK cells.

 We also determined if iMVs can improve NR-NK cells to control parasitemia. As expected,
incubation of NR-NK cells with iRBCs led to a reduction of parasitemia by 25±13% (n = 5)
(Fig 5K). Although no significant increase in parasitemia reduction was observed when 10 μg/
ml iMVs were added into the culture of NR-NK cells and iRBCs, a significant increase (55
±4%, n = 5, p = 0.001) was detected when 100 μg/ml iMVs was added, suggesting iMVs can
enhance killing of iRBCs by NR-NK cells.
Discussion
NK cells play a critical role in the immediate responses to malaria parasite infection through
rapid activation of cytotoxic activities and secretion of cytokines. Poor NK cell cytotoxicity is
often associated with acute malaria [7, 9] and the low NK cell cytotoxicity in pregnant women
is associated with higher chance of a positive blood smear for malaria parasites [23]. Interest-
ingly, NK cell responses to malaria infection vary significantly in the human population. NK
cells from ~30% of malaria naïve individuals do not become activated nor produce much IFN-
γ in response to iRBCs [20]. We also observed similar heterogeneity of NK cell responses to
iRBCs among malaria naïve individuals. Besides deficiencies in NK cell activation and IFN-γ
production, we further show that NK cells from non-responders are unable to control parasite-
mia in vitro. Analysis of NK cells from patients with uncomplicated or severe malaria also sug-
gests an association of non-responding NK cells with severe malaria.
Our transcriptional analysis of NK cells from responders and non-responders sheds light
on the possible molecular basis underlying the variations in NK cell responses to malaria infec-
tion. We identified a total of 64 DEGs between R-NK cells co-cultured with iRBCs and the
other three groups (R-NK cells co-cultured with RBCs, and NR-NK cells co-cultured with
either RBCs or iRBCs). Most of these DEGs are involved in pathways in immune responses
and pathogen recognition, especially the RLR signaling pathway. MDA5, one of the three
RLRs, has been shown to be required for the control of P. yoelii infection in mice [41], and for
recognition of Plasmodium RNA by murine hepatocytes and dendritic cells [16]. Consistently,
we show that MDA5 knockdown significantly reduced R-NK cell lysis of iRBCs. Inhibition of
TBK1/IKKε, an effector kinase downstream of MDA5, also significantly reduced R-NK cell
control of parasitemia. Conversely, NR-NK cells were ‘rescued’ by an MDA5 agonist to control
parasitemia in vitro. These results show that MDA5 is critical for NK cell responses to iRBCs
in human and the difference in their expression following exposure to iRBC may be a signifi-
cant factor contributing to the variations of NK cell responses to malaria infection in the
human population. Because NR-NK cell responses to iRBCs can be restored by an MDA5 ago-
nist, our finding also suggests a possible approach to enhance NK cell activity to malaria infec-
tion in non-responders.
MDA5 belongs to a class of intracellular RNA sensors and has typically been associated
with recognition of RNA viruses [42]. What are the parasite components that are recognized
by MDA5? As parasites reside inside RBCs, how do parasite components gain access and acti-
vate MDA5 in the cytoplasm of NK cells? iRBCs are known to shed nucleic acid-containing
histograms of R-NK cells cultured with RBC (NK+RBC), iRBCs (NK+iRBCs), MVs at 10 μg/ml (NK+MV10), iMVs at 1 (NK+iMV1) and 10 μg/ml (NK+iMV10)

 microvesicles as a form of horizontal cell-cell communication [43]. Recently, Sisquella et al
reported the presence of parasite mRNA species in iMVs and delivery of nucleic acids to acti-
vate the STING pathway by fusion of iMVs with macrophages [44]. We show that NK cells can
uptake microvesicles from iRBCs. The fusion of microvesicles with the plasma membrane of
NK cells likely releases the nucleic acid-cargo into the cytoplasm of NK cells [45, 46], thereby
activating MDA5. Consistently, signaling through the downstream effector molecules, such as
TBK1/IKKε, lead to activation of NK cells, including expression of CD69, conformation
change of LFA-1 to the intermediate/high-affinity state, secretion of IFN-γ and expression of
cytotoxicity. Compared to macrophage activation through STING pathway by iMVs, the RLR/
MDA5 pathway is required for NK cell activation by iMVs. Thus, our findings identify the par-
asite components that are recognized by MDA5 and reveal the mechanism by which parasite
components gain access and activate MDA5 in the cytoplasm of NK cells.
It is notable that no DEG was identified between unstimulated R-NK and NR-NK cells.
Consistently, R-NK and NR-NK cells are of similar differentiation and maturity status (S2
Fig). These results would suggest that prior to exposure to iRBC, there is no gross difference
between R-NK and NR-NK cells, and the difference in their ability to control parasitemia likely
arises from their responses to iRBC. It has been reported that resting or naïve NK cells exhibit
minimal effector functions, such as cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production following stimu-
lation through activation receptors [47] or PRRs [48]. The transition of naïve NK cells to fully
activated effector NK cells involve an intermediate primed state [49]. Unlike naïve NK cells,
primed NK cells upregulate activation markers, such as CD69. However, unlike effector NK
cells, primed NK cells do not exhibit cytotoxicity or secrete IFN-γ. NK cells can be primed by
certain subsets of dendritic cells [50], by cytokines, such as IL-18 [51], and by tumor cell lysates
[49]. We found that iMVs activates NK cells to express CD69 but not IFN-γ secretion, suggest-
ing that iRBC-derived microvesicles prime NK cells through MDA5.
We have shown previously that NK cells form stable conjugates with iRBCs in an LFA-1-depen-
dent manner before activation and lysis of iRBCs. Induction of the expression of the intermediate/
high-affinity LFA-1 by iMVs would strengthen this interaction. The prolonged interaction between
NK cells and iRBCs, in turn, could facilitate the directional release of iMVs to NK cells and likely
provides additional signals for full activation of NK cells. In this respect, studies have shown that
LFA-1 itself is an important NK cell activation receptor, and the ligation of LFA-1 can lead to the
acquisition of cytotoxicity [52]. This notion is consistent with the observations that though IL-12
and IL-18 could activate NK cells, production of IFN-γ still requires direct contact with iRBCs [53].
Thus, it would appear that R-NK and NR-NK cells might have a different threshold in the activa-
tion of MDA5, and such small difference in MDA5 responsiveness could amplify the effect of iRBC
on NK cells, leading to significant differences in the control of parasitemia. Interestingly, polymor-
phisms in MDA5 have been reported to affect responses to a variety of viruses, including Coxsack-
ievirus [13], Enterovirus 71 [14], and Hepatitis C virus [15]. As far as we know, no MDA5
polymorphism has been reported to affect the course of malaria infection. Based on our result, it
would be of significant interest to investigate this possibility in further studies.
In summary, our study identifies how NK cells respond to parasite-infected RBCs and
reveal the molecular basis underlying the variations of NK cell responses to malaria infection
in the human population.

 Adenine-1 buffer (CPDA-1, JMS). PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Health-
care) as per manufacturer protocol. Purified PBMCs were resuspended in freezing medium
(85% fetal bovine serum [FBS, Gibco], 15% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO, Sigma]) and stored in
liquid nitrogen. RBCs were washed twice in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:1 with col-
lected plasma, and stored at 4˚C for malaria culture.
Buffy coat from malaria patients was performed at the Chittagong Medical College Hospi-
tal, Bangladesh. Adult patients (>12 years) were enrolled using the modified World Health
Organization criteria for severe falciparum malaria, as defined previously [54]. All patients
were enrolled < 24 hours after treatment commencement with either parenteral artemisinin
or quinine. Severe malaria was defined as any P. falciparum parasitemia in adults, detected by
asexual stages on a peripheral blood slide or a positive rapid diagnostic test in combination
with one or more: 1) GCS <11; 2) Hematocrit < 20% with parasite count > 100,000/ mm; 3)
Jaundice with bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with parasite count > 100,000/ mm; 4) Serum
creatinine > 3 mg/dL; 5) Hypoglycemia with venous glucose < 40 mg/dL; 6) Systolic blood
pressure < 80mmHg with cool extremities; 7) Peripheral asexual stage parasitemia > 10%; 8)
Peripheral venous lactate > 4 mmol/L, 9) Peripheral venous bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L; 10)
Respiratory insufficiency. Uncomplicated Malaria required the presence of P. falciparum asex-
ual stages on a peripheral blood-slide or a positive rapid diagnostic test and the absence of any
of the complications of severe malaria.
P. falciparum culture and infection
P. falciparum strains 3D7 (MRA-102, contributed by Daniel J. Carucci), HB2 (MRA-767, con-
tributed by ATCC), T994 (MRA-153, contributed by David Walliker), and W2mef (MRA-615,
contributed by Alan F. Cowman) were obtained through BEI Resources Repository, NIAID,
NIH. Parasites were cultured at 2.5% hematocrit using human RBCs in malaria culture media
(MCM) [55]. Cultures were incubated in a Heracell 150 incubator (Thermo Scientific) at 37˚C
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 3% O2 and 92% N2. Schizont-stage iRBCs were harvested by cen-
trifugation on a 60% Percoll gradient [55].
Parasitemia was quantified by flow cytometry and Giemsa-staining [55]. Parasite DNA was
stained using Hoechst 33342 (20 μg/ml) (Thermo Scientific). To compare parasitemia from
different experiments with NK cells from different individuals, we calculated the reduction in
parasitemia as follows:
%Parasitemia reduction ¼ Parasitemiano NK � ParasitemiaNK
Parasitemiano NK
� 100
In vitro NK cell assays
NK cells (CD56+CD3-) were obtained from PBMC or patient buffy coat by negative selection
using EasySep Human NK Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies). The purity of NK
cells was consistently between 95–100% (S3 Fig). Synchronized schizonts-stage iRBCs at a
parasitemia of 0.5% were incubated with NK cells at a ratio of 1:10. The following antibodies
from BioLegend were used to quantify expression of the indicated NK cell markers: CD3
(UCHT1), CD56 (HCD56), CD69 (FN50), CD25 (BC96), CD107a (H4A3), NKp30 (P30-15),
NKp44 (P44-8), NKp46 (9E2), NKG2A (16A11), NKG2D (1D11), CD94 (DX22), 2B4 (C1.7),
CD36 (5–271), CD11a (HL111), CD18 (1B4/CD18), DNAM1 (11A8), CD2 (RPA-2.10), LFA-1
(m24), Perforin (dG9), Granulysin (DH2), and IFN-γ (4S.B3). Anti-NKG2C (#134522) was
obtained from R&D Systems. To control for the inter-individual differences and experimental

Poly I:C was obtained from Invivogen (tlrl-pic) and used at 10 μg/ml. The packaging of
poly I:C was performed using lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher) as per manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. Bx795 (SML0694, from Sigma-Aldrich) was used to inhibit TBK1/IKKε at a concentra-
tion of 10 nM. Quantification of cytokines was performed using LEGENDplex Human
Inflammation Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend) at 48 h time point.
To generate MDA5 knockout human NK cells, NK cells were isolated from PMBCs and
transduced with lentivirus. Lentivirus was produced in H293FT cells using a 3 plasmid system
comprising plentiCRISPRv2 (#52961) [56], pVSVG (#8454) and pCMV-dR8.91. gRNA
sequence targeting MDA5 was GCGTTCTCAAACGATGGAGA (http://www.e-crisp.org/
E-CRISP/) and scrambled gRNA sequence was GCACTACCAGAGCTAACTCA. Transduced
NK cells were cultured in selection medium comprising of RPMI, 10% FBS (Gibco), puromy-
cin (2μg/ml) (Gibco), SCF (20ng/ml), Flt-3L (10ng/ml), IL-15 (10ng/ml), IL-7 (20ng/ml), IL-3
(5ng/ml), β-mercaptoethanol (50μM) (Gibco) for 2 weeks. All cytokines were purchased from
Peprotech. NK cells were washed thrice to remove selection medium prior to co-culture with
iRBCs. Western blot of MDA5 and GAPDH was performed using anti-MDA5 (#5321, Cell
Signaling Technology) and anti-GAPDH (#5174, Cell Signaling Technology), respectively.
Flow cytometry
Cells were stained with the indicated antibodies for 15 mins at 4˚C in flow buffer (0.2% bovine
serum albumin [BSA, Sigma], 0.05% sodium azide [Sigma] in PBS). For intracellular staining,
brefeldin A (final concentration 5 μg/ml) was added to the culture 6 h before cell harvesting and
staining. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4˚C for 30 min, followed by per-
meabilization in perm buffer (0.1% saponin in PBS) at 4˚C for 30 min. Antibody staining was
then performed in perm buffer at 4˚C for 30 min. Stained samples were analyzed on a BD LSR
II flow cytometer, and data analyzed by FACS Diva (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo (TreeStar). Iso-
type-matched control antibodies were used for all fluorochrome-isotype combinations.
Imaging
Culture chambers were fabricated from Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using Sylgard 184 Sili-
cone elastomer kit (Sigma-Aldrich), cured overnight in a 70˚C oven, and cleaned with a
plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma). Culture chambers were then mounted onto Menzel-Gla
¨ser
22×60 mm #1 glass coverslips at 70˚C. Live-cell imaging was performed on an inverted Olym-
pus IX71 fitted with an Olympus Planapo 60×/1.4 oil lens. Microscope stage was equipped
with a Tokai Hit INU Live Cell Microscope Chamber, where the temperature was maintained
at 37˚C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 3% O2 and 92% N2. Images were acquired using a Hama-
matsu ORCA-ER (C4742-80-12AG) CCD camera and analyzed using ImageJ.
Microvesicle isolation
Microvesicles were concentrated using the method described by Mantel et al [33]. Briefly,
iRBCs or RBC culture supernatants were first centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 mins. Microvesicles
were then pelleted from the resultant supernatants at 100000 g for 1 hr using a Ti70 rotor on
an Optima L-100K ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). The resultant pellet was resuspended in
2 ml PBS, layered over 10–70% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 10000 g for 16 h using an

 SW28Ti rotor. Microvesicles were collected at the interface between 50% and 60% sucrose.
Labeling of MV was achieved using either PKH26 or PKH67 (Sigma-Aldrich), as per manufac-
turer protocol with minor modification. Post-labelling, excess dye was absorbed and washed
away with 1% BSA solution 3 times. Microvesicles were then concentrated in a 10 kDa Amicon
Ultra-0.5 mL (Merck Millipore) filter. MV concentration was estimated using Nanodrop
(Thermo Scientific).
Total RNA from microvesicles was extracted using Trizol (Thermofisher) and capped with
desthiobiotin-GTP (NEB) using vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme (NEB) as per manufac-
turer’s protocol. Desthiobiotin-GTP capped RNA was bound to streptavidin column (NEB)
and competitively eluted using free biotin (5 mM) (Sigma). Flow-through, containing origi-
nally capped RNAs, and eluted RNA species, containing originally uncapped RNAs but in
vitro capped RNAs, were then reverse transcribed to cDNA with random primers, amplified
(Clontech) and visualized on a 1% agarose gel.
RNA transcriptional analysis
NK cells (1x106) were co-cultured with iRBCs (1x105) or the same number of RBCs as
described above. After RBCs were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific), live NK
cells were purified by cell sorting for RNA extraction by TRIzol (ThermoFisher). Extracted
RNA was then processed at DUKE-NUS Genome facility. RNA quality was assessed by electro-
phoretic assay on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using a Nano chip (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano
chip). 500ng of total RNA with a RIN value of >7.0 was used for biotin-labelling using Illu-
mina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion Inc.) to generate complementary RNA
(cRNA). 750ng of biotin-labeled cRNA was then hybridized on the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4
Beadchip according to Manufacturer’s instruction (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Beadchips
were washed and stained according to manufacturer’s instruction and scanned using Illumina
BeadArray Reader (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).
Microarray data were analyzed using R [57]. BeadChip data was converted to an expression
set, variance stabilized and quantile-normalized using the lumi package [58]. Differentially
expression genes (DEG) were identified via linear modeling using the limma package [25],
with a false discovery rate (Bonferroni correction) of 0.05. Pathways were generated using
ConsensusPathDB (http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de) and visualized with PathVisio [59] using
WikiPathways [60]. Heatmaps were made with GENE-E (https://software.broadinstitute.org/
GENE-E/). Transcriptomic data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at
EMBL-EBI (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6574/) under acces-
sion number E-MTAB-6574.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD). Differences between paired sam-
ples were analyzed using a paired t-test, while unpaired samples were analyzed with Student’s
t-test. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All calculations were per-
formed using the GraphPad 6.01 software package.
Ethics statement
Whole blood was donated by healthy non-malarial immune adult volunteers at the National
University Hospital of Singapore Blood Bank. Informed consents were obtained from all
donors in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of National
University of Singapore (NUS-IRB 10–285). Buffy coat from malaria patients was obtained

S1 Fig. Variation of NCRs, C-type lectin receptors and adhesion molecules on NK cell fol-
lowing co-culture with iRBCs. Responder (R-) or non-responder (NR-) NK cells were co-cul-
tured with either RBC or iRBC for 96 hrs. Surface expression of the NCRs–NKp30 (A), NKp44
(B), and NKp46 (C); C-type lectin receptors–NKG2A (D), NKG2C (E), NKG2D (F), and
CD94 (G); and adhesion molecules– 2B4 (H), CD36 (I), CD11a (J), CD18 (K), DNAM-1 (L)
and CD2 (M) were assessed by flow cytometry. Each dot represents a different individual.
Joined lines show experimental pair.

S2 Fig. Expression of NK cell maturation markers on responder and non-responder NK cells.
(A) Live NK cells from 5 responders (green) and 5 non-responder (yellow) were isolated and pro-
cessed for microarray transcriptomic analyses. Heatmap of gene expression log2-ratios of selected
NK cell differentiation markers is displayed. The relative expression values are color-coded: red–
high expression, blue–low. (B-F) Surface expression of NKG2A (B), CD94 (C), CD36 (D),
NKp46 (E) and CD57 (F) on responder (R-) or non-responder (NR-) NK cells. (G-H) Percentage
of CD56+CD16+ (G) and CD56+CD16- (H) cells in responder and non-responders. Each dot rep-
resents a different individual. Error bars represent mean ± SD. ns: not significant.

S3 Fig. Purity assessment of NK cells after negative selection. NK cells were purified from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic beads negative selection. Purified NK cells
were then stained with DAPI, anti-CD3 (UCHT1) and anti-CD56 (HCD56). Singlets were first
gated using FSC-H against FSC-A. NK cell population was then selected on SSC-A against
FSC-A. Next, DAPI-negative cells were gated. NK cell purity was then assessed on a CD3
against CD56 plot. Shown were plots from 3 different donors. Number indicates the percent-
age of the gated population.
