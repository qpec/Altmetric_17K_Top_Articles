Abstract: Subclinical micronutrient deficiency in older adults is associated with chronic age-related
diseases and adverse functional outcomes. In Germany, the older population is at risk of insufficient
micronutrient intake, but representative studies on micronutrient status in old and very old adults
are scarce. This study’s objectives were to estimate the prevalence of subclinical vitamin D, folate,
vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies among older adults, aged 65 to 93, from the KORA-Age study
in Augsburg, Germany (n = 1079), and to examine associated predictors, using multiple logistic
regression.
Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), folate, vitamin B12, and
iron were analyzed. The prevalence of subclinical vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies were
high, with 52.0% and 27.3% of individuals having low 25OHD (<50 nmol/L) and low vitamin B12
concentrations (<221 pmol/L), respectively. Furthermore, 11.0% had low iron (men <11.6 µmol/L,
women <9.0 µmol/L) and 8.7% had low folate levels (<13.6 nmol/L). Common predictors associated
with subclinical micronutrient deficiency included very old age, physical inactivity, frailty and
no/irregular use of supplements. Subclinical micronutrient deficiency is a public health concern
among KORA-Age participants, especially for vitamins D and B12.
The predictors identified
provide further rationale for screening high-risk subgroups and developing targeted public health
interventions to tackle prevailing micronutrient inadequacies among older adults.

1. Introduction
Deficiencies in essential vitamins, minerals and trace elements (micronutrients) affect an estimated
2 billion people, in both developing and developed countries. This ‘hidden hunger’ has negative
health impacts among vulnerable groups in the population, especially older adults [1].
Epidemiological evidence suggests that subclinical micronutrient deficiencies in older adults are
associated with chronic age-related diseases and adverse functional outcomes. Older adults with low
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels have a significantly higher risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus,
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and osteoporosis-related fractures [2]. Age-associated declines in muscle
mass and strength (sarcopenia), which in turn affect balance, gait, and overall independence [3], have
been linked to low 25OHD levels as well [4]. Vitamin B12 and folate are necessary for one-carbon
metabolism and DNA synthesis, and have been investigated in relation to degenerative diseases,
including CVD, cognitive dysfunction and osteoporosis [5]. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent
nutritional deficiency worldwide and its main consequence is anemia [6], which has been associated
with an increased risk of developing dementia in old age [7].
Ageing is associated with physiological changes that can impact the nutritional and more
specifically the micronutrient status of older adults. Importantly, energy requirements decrease due to
a loss of lean body mass and a reduction in physical activity, resulting in decreasing energy intakes.
At a low energy intake, older adults may be at increased risk for specific micronutrient deficiencies,
unless their diets contain micronutrient-rich foods. Moreover, older adults’ abilities to absorb and
utilize specific micronutrients become less efficient (e.g., reduced gastric acid secretion preventing the
release of vitamin B12 from foods [5]; decline in subcutaneous vitamin D synthesis capacity and lowered
renal conversion to its active form [8]). Last, but not least, the likelihood of multiple chronic diseases,
such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer, use of multiple medications and
variable diet quality, associated with appetite loss, chewing/swallowing difficulties and socioeconomic
barriers, may affect and even increase requirements for specific micronutrients [9,10]. All these factors
make it difficult to ensure an optimal micronutrient supply for the older population.
Due to the role of micronutrient status in chronic disease and health prevention, it is important to
quantify the magnitude of subclinical micronutrient deficiency and to identify subgroups at risk in the
older population. Results from the second German National Nutrition Survey (NVS II) uncovered
a high prevalence of insufficient dietary intake of vitamin D, folic acid and calcium in older adults
aged 65 years and over. Vitamins B1, B2, B12 and iron were additional critical micronutrients in older
women [11]. More recently, the national ‘German Health Interview and Examination Survey for
Adults’ (DEGS1) revealed that 69.9% of women and 62.6% of men, aged 65 to 79, had low 25OHD
<50 nmol/L [12], signaling a potentially serious public health issue. Nationally representative studies
on the statuses of other micronutrients, in old and very old adults, in Germany, are scarce.
To support health care in developing purposive prevention measures that handle micronutrient
inadequacies among older adults, factors associated with subclinical micronutrient deficiencies in
older adults have to be identified. Besides insufficient dietary intake and impaired absorption, low
micronutrient levels in older adults have been studied in relation to increasing age, female sex, poor
eating habits, low physical activity, smoking, obesity, low kidney function, presence of chronic diseases,
intake of drugs, non-use of supplements and, specifically for vitamin D, low sunlight exposure and
winter season [13–18]. Despite recent concerns about the possible high prevalence of subclinical
micronutrient deficiencies in the German older population, and apart from vitamin D [12,18], there is
a lack of data on both micronutrient status and its predictors in older adults.
In light of the growing ageing population, as well as the high societal relevance of successful
healthy ageing, this cross-sectional study aimed to provide insight into the magnitude of subclinical
micronutrient deficiency in German older adults, aged 65 and over, from the population-based KORA
(Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg)-Age study. Based on the micronutrients
identified in the NVS II as possible public health concerns in the German older population, we
selected four critical micronutrients with available nutritional biomarkers in the KORA-Age dataset.

Specific objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of subclinical vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin
B12 and iron deficiencies in this older population, using serum biochemical biomarkers; and (ii) to
identify predictors of subclinical micronutrient deficiency using multiple logistic regression. Possible
predictors examined included socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health factors, as well as the use of
supplements containing specific micronutrients.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
Data for the present analysis was obtained from the population-based KORA-Age study,
conducted in 2008/2009, which was a follow-up of all participants, aged 65 and over on
31 December 2008 (n = 9197), who took part in at least one of four cross-sectional MONICA (Monitoring
of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease)/KORA health surveys S1–S4 conducted
between 1984 and 2001, among the inhabitants of Augsburg and surrounding counties. Details
about the general study design and participants have been described previously [19]. Briefly, a
self-administered health questionnaire was mailed to all eligible participants of the KORA-Age cohort,
i.e., those who were still alive and reachable in 2008/2009 (n = 5991). The response rate was 76.2%
(n = 4565). Moreover, 68.9% of eligible participants took part in a standardized telephone interview
(n = 4127). The present analysis refers to a sex and age-stratified random sample of n = 2005 eligible
individuals of whom n = 1079 (537 men, 542 women) participated in an extensive physical examination
in 2009 (response rate 53.8%). All examinations were performed by trained interviewers. A flowchart
of the KORA-Age 2008/2009 recruitment and retention profile is shown in Supplementary Figure S1.
2.2. Ethical Considerations
Prior to their inclusion in the study, written informed consent was obtained from all participants or
from the patient’s caregiver when the participant was unable to make an informed decision. The Ethics
Committee of the Bavarian Medical Association (Bayerische Landesärtzekammer) approved the study
protocol (date of approval: 11 November 2008, reference number: 08064).
2.3. Blood Sample Processing
Non-fasting blood samples were collected between February and November 2009 at the KORA
study center and drawn into serum gel S-Monovette tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Blood was
gently inverted twice and rested for 30 min at room temperature until complete coagulation.
After centrifugation at 15 ◦C for 10 min, the serum obtained was aliquoted into Nunc cryotubes
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For the analysis of iron status, serum probes were
kept at 4 ◦C for a maximum of 6 h and directly analyzed at the central laboratory of Augsburg
Hospital. For vitamin D, folic acid and vitamin B12 status, serum probes were frozen at −80 ◦C
at the KORA study center, transported on ice and stored at a minimum of −80 ◦C until analysis,
in partner laboratories, between August and September 2011. Months of blood collection were
categorized according to calendar seasons: spring (February–May), summer (June–August) and
autumn (September–November).
2.4. Biochemical Analyses of Nutritional Biomarkers
Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12) were
measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, Elecsys 2010, Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variations were 4.9% and
<10% for 25OHD, 7.0% and <10% for folate and 5.3% and <10% for vitamin B12. Iron levels were
measured by photometric measurements, using the chromophore Ferene® (Dimension® Iron Flex®
reagent cartridge, Dade Behring, Inc., Newark, DE, USA). The inter-assay coefficient of variation was
<10%, and the maximal permissible imprecision and inaccuracy were 4% and 6%, respectively.

2.5. Cut-Off Points to Classify Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
Exact cut-off points for classifying subclinical micronutrient deficiencies remain debated.
Recently, a serum 25OHD level of ≥50 nmol/L was recommended as an indicator of optimal vitamin
D status by the critical review of the German Nutrition Society (DGE) for DACH countries (Germany,
Austria and Switzerland) [20] as well as the last Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR 2012) [21].
Accordingly, subclinical vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25OHD level of <50 nmol/L.
Subclinical folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies were defined as serum folate <13.6 nmol/L [22] and
serum vitamin B12 <221 pmol/L [23], respectively. For serum iron, cut-offs were <11.6 µmol/L for
men and <9.0 µmol/L for women [24].
2.6. Assesment of Predictors
The selection of potential predictors of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies was informed by
the literature and their availability in the KORA-Age dataset. Variables were grouped into three
categories (socio-demographic, lifestyle, health factors) plus the season of blood collection for vitamin
D. Assessment methods and categorization of variables are described in Supplementary Table S1.
Briefly, the variables—sex, age groups and family status—were collected using the short form of
the Demographics Standards of the German Society of Epidemiology [25]. Educational attainment was
estimated by recording years of school completed. With the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI),
the risk for malnutrition was assessed by measuring albumin, weight and height [26]. The Nutrition
Score, indicating the risk of general malnutrition, was calculated using the German short form of
the SCREEN II (Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition, version II)
questionnaire [27]. The physical activity assessment included the frequency and duration of activity
in summer and in winter [28]. Alcohol intake was assessed as daily average intake, based on the
last weekend and the last weekday, according to a validated recall method [29]. Multi-morbidity
was defined as suffering from two or more morbidities [30]. Information on smoking status was
based on self-report and participants were classified as never smokers, former smokers, or current
smokers [31]. The body mass index (BMI) was defined as the body mass (weight) measured in
kilograms divided by the square of the body height measured in meters. Frailty was defined according
to the five criteria proposed by Fried et al. [32] in a slightly modified way, depending on the availability
of information [33]. The glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated from serum creatinine as
an indicator of renal function [34]. Use of medications and supplements ingested in the last seven days
was collected through a database supported computer software (IDOM, Instrument for Databased
Assessment Of Medication) [35], together with the mode, dosage and frequency of ingestion [36].
The micronutrient composition of supplements was available from a database established by staff of
the Helmholtz Zentrum München. Polypharmacy was defined as the use of ≥5 medications, taken
regularly and prescribed (without herbal or homeopathic medications).
2.7. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages.
Due to non-normally distributed concentrations, serum levels of nutritional biomarkers were expressed
as median and interquartile range (IQR), from the first (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3). When biomarker
levels fell below the cut-offs for subclinical micronutrient deficiency, micronutrient status was
categorized as ‘subclinical deficiency’ for the respective micronutrient. Prevalence estimates of
subclinical micronutrient deficiency were reported with weighted percentages, using the Bavarian
population per 31 December 2015 for age and sex standardization (www.statistikdaten.bayern.
de/genesis/).
Pearson’s chi-squared tests were conducted to assess sex and age differences in
prevalence estimates.
To investigate predictors of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies, we defined subclinical
micronutrient deficiency as the dependent variable and predictors as the categorical independent
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1276
5 of 19
variables. The category with the ‘lowest risk’ was considered as reference for each independent
variable (e.g., male sex, 65–74 years, never smoker etc.). Participants with missing information in one
or more variables were excluded, except for frailty, which had a high number of missing values (n = 84).
To avoid deletion of numerous information-rich participants, all participants with missing frailty status
were considered as a separate category of the frailty variable. The analysis was performed separately
for 25OHD, folate, vitamin B12 and iron, according to the following scheme. We started with a binary
logistic regression, for each of the potential predictors, by calculating unadjusted odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Variables that were significant at p < 0.25 were considered for
inclusion in the multiple logistic regression model. Sex and age groups were forced into every model.
As simultaneous intake of multiple supplements is frequent among older adults, we considered, for
each nutritional biomarker, only supplement intake of the corresponding micronutrient. The final
model, with variables significant at p < 0.05, resulted from a stepwise selection procedure, which is
a combination of the forward and backward selection techniques. Model estimates are presented as
fully adjusted ORs along with 95% CIs. All analyses were performed using the statistical software
package, SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

3.1. Baseline Characteristics of Study Participants
A description of baseline characteristics is shown in Table 1, stratified by sex.
A total of
n = 1079 individuals, aged 65 to 93 years, participated in the study, including 542 (50.2%) women.
Overall, 47.7% of participants were physically inactive and 30.2% had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, indicating
obesity. Current smokers accounted for less than 5% of the population. Only 4.6% of all individuals
were frail, but 37.9% were pre-frail. The prevalence of older adults having one or at least two diseases
was 24.7% and 66.8%, respectively. Noticeable sex differences were observed for the variables, family
status, educational level and alcohol consumption.

SCREEN II: Seniors in the Community Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition, version II; eGFR: estimated
glomerular filtration rate; number of missing values: a 39, b 12, c 39, d 13, e 1, f 6, g 84, h 13.
Seniors regularly using supplements containing vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12 and iron
accounted for 6.7%, 9.5%, 8.9% and 2.8% of the male population, and 19.2%, 12.0%, 12.2% and 3.9% of
the female population, respectively. In these regular users, the median amounts of vitamin D, folic acid,
vitamin B12 and iron consumed from these supplements per day were, for men, 6.2 µg (IQR: 3.6–10.0),
400.0 µg (IQR: 200.0–714.3), 3.3 µg (IQR: 1.8–10.0) and 5.0 mg (IQR: 1.7–35.0), and for women 10.0 µg
(IQR: 5.0–20.0), 300.0 µg (IQR: 200.0–400.0), 3.0 µg (IQR: 1.5–9.0) and 4.0 mg (IQR: 3.5–5.0), respectively.
Serum concentrations of 25OHD, folate, vitamin B12 and iron were measured in n = 1040, n = 1043,
n = 1044 and n = 1050 KORA-Age individuals, respectively. Accordingly, a total of n = 39 (25OHD),
n = 36 (folate), n = 35 (vitamin B12) and n = 29 individuals (iron) had missing values in serum
nutritional biomarker measurements. Using Pearson’s chi-squared tests, KORA-Age individuals
with missing micronutrient values were more likely to be very old (85–93 years); to live alone, to be
divorced or widowed; to be less active or inactive; to be alcohol abstainers; to have a normal BMI

(18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2) and to have a low kidney function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (data
not shown).
3.2. Prevalence of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
Serum concentrations of nutritional biomarkers and total age- and sex-standardized prevalence
of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies are presented in Table 2, stratified by sex.
Median concentrations of 25OHD, folate,
vitamin B12
and iron were 48.3 nmol/L
(IQR: 31.4–69.6), 24.5 nmol/L (IQR: 18.2–33.3), 277 pmol/L (IQR: 214–376) and 16.1 µmol/L
(IQR: 13.1–20.0), respectively.
More than half of KORA-Age participants (52.0%) had low 25OHD concentrations.
In season-specific analyses, the prevalence of a subclinical vitamin D deficiency was 60.9% in
spring (February–May), 46.9% in summer (June–August) and 45.4% in fall (September–November).
The prevalence of a subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency (27.3%) was also high. Approximately 10% of
individuals had low levels of iron and folate. In sex-specific analyses, the prevalence of subclinical
deficiencies were more common in women for 25OHD (59.0% vs. 44.4%) and folate (9.4% vs. 8.0%)
and in men, for vitamin B12 (28.5% vs. 26.0%) and iron (13.5% vs. 8.4%). Using Pearson’s chi-squared
tests, these sex differences in prevalence were significant for 25OHD and iron (p < 0.001).
The prevalence of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies, by age groups, is shown in Figure 1.
The prevalence increased gradually with age for all micronutrients. Specifically, the proportion of
participants with serum 25OHD <50 nmol/L increased from 43.8% in the age group 65–74 years, to
74.2% in the age group 85–93 years. In Pearson’s chi-squared tests, divergences between age groups
were significant for all biomarkers (25OHD: p < 0.001; folate: p < 0.001; vitamin B12: p = 0.008; iron:
p = 0.001).

nutritional biomarker measurements. Using Pearson’s chi-squared tests, KORA-Age individuals 
with missing micronutrient values were more likely to be very old (85–93 years); to live alone, to be 
divorced or widowed; to be less active or inactive; to be alcohol abstainers; to have a normal BMI 
(18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2) and to have a low kidney function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (data not 
shown). 
3.2. Prevalence of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency 
Serum concentrations of nutritional biomarkers and total age- and sex-standardized prevalence 
of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies are presented in Table 2, stratified by sex. 
Median concentrations of 25OHD, folate, vitamin B12 and iron were 48.3 nmol/L (IQR: 31.4–69.6), 
24.5 nmol/L (IQR: 18.2–33.3), 277 pmol/L (IQR: 214–376) and 16.1 µmol/L (IQR: 13.1–20.0), 
respectively. 
More than half of KORA-Age participants (52.0%) had low 25OHD concentrations. In season-
specific analyses, the prevalence of a subclinical vitamin D deficiency was 60.9% in spring (February–
May), 46.9% in summer (June–August) and 45.4% in fall (September–November). The prevalence of 
a subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency (27.3%) was also high. Approximately 10% of individuals had low 
levels of iron and folate. In sex-specific analyses, the prevalence of subclinical deficiencies were more 
common in women for 25OHD (59.0% vs. 44.4%) and folate (9.4% vs. 8.0%) and in men, for vitamin 
B12 (28.5% vs. 26.0%) and iron (13.5% vs. 8.4%). Using Pearson’s chi-squared tests, these sex 
differences in prevalence were significant for 25OHD and iron (p < 0.001). 
The prevalence of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies, by age groups, is shown in Figure 1. 
The prevalence increased gradually with age for all micronutrients. Specifically, the proportion of 
participants with serum 25OHD <50 nmol/L increased from 43.8% in the age group 65–74 years, to 
74.2% in the age group 85–93 years. In Pearson’s chi-squared tests, divergences between age groups 
were significant for all biomarkers (25OHD: p < 0.001; folate: p < 0.001; vitamin B12: p = 0.008; iron: p = 
0.001).

3.3. Predictors of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
As illustrated in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, 15 variables were tested in a binary logistic
regression for the association between subclinical micronutrient deficiencies and each of the potential
predictors, plus the season of blood collection for 25OHD. Besides sex and age groups, common
potential predictors with p-values < 0.25 included educational level, nutritional status (Nutrition Score),
physical activity, alcohol consumption, frailty and use of micronutrient-containing supplements.
The final results of the multiple logistic regression analyses are shown in Table 3.
Common predictors that were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with low levels of several
micronutrients were identified. Seniors aged 85 and over had two times higher odds of having
low 25OHD (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–3.8, p = 0.003), low folate (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.3, p = 0.011)
and low vitamin B12 levels (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.2, p = 0.004) compared to their 65–74-year old
counterparts. Physical inactivity remained significantly associated with low 25OHD (OR = 1.6, 95%
CI 1.2–2.2, p = 0.001), low folate (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.4, p = 0.006) and low vitamin B12 levels (OR = 1.4,
95% CI 1.0–1.8, p = 0.042). Both pre-frailty and frailty were strong independent correlates of subclinical
25OHD and iron deficiency. Frailty increased four-fold, the odds of a subclinical iron deficiency,
compared to non-frail individuals (OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.6–10.2, p = 0.002). Moreover, non/irregular
users of supplements, containing specific micronutrients, had four to five times higher odds of having
low 25OHD (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 3.1–7.6, p < 0.001), low folate (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.4–16.1, p = 0.024) and
low vitamin B12 levels (OR = 4.7, 95% CI 2.5–10.2, p < 0.001), compared to regular users.
A few predictors remained independently associated with low levels of specific micronutrients
only (Table 3). Springtime, female sex and obesity were significantly associated with a subclinical
25OHD deficiency. Former smokers had lower odds of having low 25OHD levels, compared to
non-smokers. Polypharmacy was associated with better vitamin B12 levels. Regarding folate, drinkers
of ≥20 g alcohol per day had lower odds of having low folate levels than non-drinkers. Finally,
having a moderate/major and even low risk for malnutrition (as assessed by the GNRI), male sex and
polypharmacy were associated with an increased risk for low iron levels.

4. Discussion
The determination of the magnitude and predictors of subclinical micronutrient deficiency in
KORA-Age older adults revealed that the prevalence of subclinical vitamin D and B12 deficiencies
were high. Very old age, physical inactivity, frailty and no/irregular use of micronutrient-containing
supplements were common predictors of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies.
4.1. Prevalence of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
Direct comparison of our findings with other studies is hampered by the lack of international
consensus as to which nutritional biomarker (biochemical and/or functional), which assay
methodology, and which cut off point should be used to define a subclinical micronutrient deficiency
in older adults [23,37]. Nevertheless, our population-based data is in line with previous studies that
have suggested that subclinical vitamin D and B12 deficiencies are prevalent public health problems
among older adults [12,15,38–42].
In the present study, low 25OHD levels were found in more than half (52.0%) of KORA-Age
participants, and were more frequent in women (59.0%) than in men (44.4%). These findings lie in the
range of national estimates from selected European countries that have used 25OHD < 50 nmol/L as the
cut-off, including Germany (women 69.9%, men 62.9%) [12], Austria (women 62.3%, men 64.8%) [38],
France (women 42.2%, men 36.5%) [39] and England (women 57.0%, men 49.0%) [15].
Around one out of four participants (27.3%) had a low vitamin B12 concentration in the KORA-Age
study population. In line with our data, a subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported in
10–15% of older adults aged 60 and over in the USA [40,41], and even in 23–35% of older adults aged
80 and over in the USA [42].
The prevalence of subclinical deficiencies for both serum folate and serum iron (~10%) was less
of a concern in the studied older adults. Recent studies in the USA [43] and in Brazil [44] pointed to
a prevalence of <5% for folate deficiency among older adults aged 60 and over, though it is important
to note that these countries have adopted national folic acid fortification policies. For serum iron,
comparable studies in older adults are lacking; other studies have focused on identifying more
advanced cases of iron deficiency or anemia, or they have used, in combination with serum iron or
without, other functional nutritional biomarkers of iron status, such as transferrin saturation, serum
ferritin, or blood hemoglobin measurements [45–47]. In these studies, the prevalence of iron deficiency
or anemia was only moderate (≤11%) in the older population.
Risk factors for subclinical micronutrient deficiency among older adults include: (i) decreased
energy needs due to a loss of lean body mass and a decline in physical activity; (ii) age-associated
physiological changes that affect absorption and utilization of micronutrients (e.g., decreased renal
production of the active vitamin D form by the aging kidney [8]), and finally (iii) the presence of
multiple chronic diseases, nutrient-drug interactions and variable diet quality, which may affect
micronutrient requirements [9,10]. To identify older adults who would benefit most from subclinical
micronutrient deficiency screening, we next discuss other factors that are associated with subclinical
micronutrient deficiencies among older adults.
4.2. Predictors of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
4.2.1. Common Predictors of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
Very Old Age
Seniors aged 85 and over were two times more likely to have low 25OHD, low folate and low
vitamin B12 levels compared to their younger counterparts. It is well known that micronutrient
inadequacies increase beyond 65 years [37,48], and even more in octogenarians and older [15,42].
The efficiency of producing vitamin D in the skin decreases with age [8], and may be coupled
to age-related factors that limit sunlight exposure, such as being more housebound. A subclinical
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1276
12 of 19
vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults is mainly caused by inadequate dietary intake and malabsorption.
Chronic atrophic gastritis (a chronic inflammation causing loss of the gastric acid-producing cells,
which is prevalent in ~30% of older adults) and the intake of drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors,
histamine receptor 2 antagonists and biguanides, affect the secretion of gastric acid, thereby preventing
the release of vitamin B12 from foods. Other contributing risk factors for low vitamin B12 levels in older
adults include Helicobacter pylori infection and intestinal bacterial overgrowth [5,23]. An insufficient
folate status in older adults seems to be mainly due to poor diet [49].
Physical Inactivity
Physical inactivity was associated with low 25OHD, folate and vitamin B12 concentrations.
In epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, physical activity is often used as a proxy for time
spent outdoors and indirectly for sunlight exposure. Accordingly, housebound seniors and those
spending less time doing outdoor physical activity have decreased 25OHD levels [16]. Not surprisingly,
being physically active was associated with higher 25OHD levels in our study. It has to be noted that
our variable probably only gives a rough estimate of time spent outside, as it was not possible to
distinguish outdoor from indoor activities.
Brock et al. found a positive association between both outdoor and indoor physical activities and
25OHD, suggesting that physical activity per se may also be a surrogate for better general health [50].
This may explain the findings for folate and vitamin B12. Prospective studies are needed to confirm
a potential physiological link between physical activity and micronutrient concentrations.
Frailty
Pre-frail and frail individuals had a higher risk for subclinical 25OHD and iron deficiency.
Prior cross-sectional and prospective studies among KORA-Age participants found low 25OHD
levels to be associated with prevalent (pre-)frailty [33], incident pre-frailty and pre-frailty/frailty
combined [51].
To our knowledge, the relationship between low serum iron levels and frailty
occurrence has not been extensively investigated, yet Pires Corona et al. found that anemic older
adults with low hemoglobin levels were more likely to be frail [52].
Although our findings suggest that (pre-)frailty may be a predictor of a subclinical micronutrient
deficiency, it has also been suggested that poor nutrition itself can favor the development of frailty [53].
No/Irregular Use of Supplements
No/irregular use of supplements was a strong common predictor of subclinical 25OHD and
folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Prior studies in older adults have found that supplement use is
a major predictor of vitamin D status [14,17] and is linked to higher vitamin B12 and folate levels [54,55].
Although 44.7% of KORA-Age participants used supplements containing vitamins or minerals [36],
only around 10% took supplements containing vitamin D, folate and vitamin B12, respectively.
As shown previously [56,57], optimal serum micronutrient levels, such as vitamin D, folate and
vitamin B12, can be maintained by supplementation. The possibility that regular supplementation with
these specific micronutrients might help older adults in satisfying their requirements, and prevent
chronic diseases via the correction of low levels, as found earlier [56], is of major interest and could
stimulate research on biological pathways that link supplement intake, micronutrient status and
disease state.
No/irregular use of iron-containing supplements was not significantly associated with
a subclinical iron deficiency in our study. It is important to note that there are concerns about
the adverse effects of iron-containing supplements [6], including nausea, epigastric discomfort and
constipation, all of which are dose-related. In case of iron deficiency anemia, it is recommended to
seek consultation from a physician, in order to use appropriately dosed iron-containing supplements.

4.2.2. Further Predictors of Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency
Vitamin D (Springtime, Female Sex, Obesity, Former Smoking)
In line with previous studies among older adults, we found that springtime, female sex and
obesity were significantly associated with low 25OHD levels [15–17]. Seasonal variations in 25OHD
status are well known. During cold and dark months, older adults may spend more daylight hours
indoors, resulting in less sun exposure. Furthermore, in Germany, from October to March, UVB
radiation is too low to induce vitamin D synthesis by the skin [58]. Sex differences may be due
to unaccounted confounders, such as clothing style, use of sun protection, and to dietary intake.
Concerning the inverse association with obesity, it has been suggested that vitamin D is accumulated
in adipose tissue, resulting in decreased bioavailability and lower circulating 25OHD levels in the
blood of obese persons [59].
The investigation of smoking status yielded inconsistent results. In studies classifying former
smoking as a separate category [15,60], former smoking was not found to be a significant predictor of
low 25OHD levels. In our data, former smoking was associated with higher 25OHD levels than never
smokers. Schwab et al. showed that former smokers, among KORA-Age individuals, were two times
more likely to ingest vitamin and mineral-containing supplements compared to never smokers [36].
It is therefore conceivable that smoking cessation went along with improved diet and lifestyle habits
that increased vitamin D intake. These unaccounted factors, such as improved intake of foods rich
in micronutrients or longer times spent outdoors, may have confounded the observed association.
Furthermore, there is always the possibility for a type I error due to multiple comparisons.
Vitamin B12 (No Polypharmacy)
Some drugs reduce absorption or affect the metabolism of vitamin B12 via known mechanisms
(such as proton pump inhibitors or histamine receptor 2 antagonists) or unknown mechanisms (such as
metformin) [23]. Conversely, we found that polypharmacy was associated with sufficient vitamin B12
levels. Differentiating between the different types of medications ingested was outside the scope of
this analysis, but it would be interesting to find out which medication(s) may positively impact on
vitamin B12 status.
Folate (Alcohol Consumption)
Contra-intuitively, drinkers of ≥20 g alcohol per day had higher folate levels than abstainers.
The consumption of ≥20 g of alcohol is equivalent to ≥0.5 L beer, ≥0.2 L wine or ≥3 small spirits
of 2 cL [61], and was more frequent in men (n = 246) than women (n = 61) (Table 1). Differentiating
between alcohol levels revealed that the majority of these female (n = 54) and male drinkers (n = 163)
used between ≥20 and <40 g/day, which is still considered as moderate drinking for men. A lower
proportion of men were high (between ≥40 to <60 g/day, n = 60) to heavy drinkers (>60 g/day, n = 23),
respectively. Our variable category thus mostly covered moderate to high drinkers, and only a few
heavy drinkers.
In observational epidemiological studies in humans, folate deficiency has been shown to be
common in excessive alcohol drinkers and alcoholics [62], suggesting that alcohol consumption may
affect folate status preponderantly at higher alcohol doses. Also, light to moderate alcohol consumption
is known to be associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality [61]. It is thus possible that the dose
at which alcohol was consumed in our study—mostly moderate amounts—was not harmful, but had
a positive effect on health in general, thereby possibly affecting folate status. Possible mechanisms
involved need further investigation. Nonetheless, caution is warranted as the observed association
with alcohol use might be confounded by other factors that influence both traits. Another possible
explanation for this counter-intuitive finding is the selection bias associated with the follow-up design
of the KORA-Age study, whereby more health-interested individuals involved in former KORA studies,
and probably fewer sick individuals with reduced alcohol consumption levels, participated.

Iron (Male Sex, GNRI, Polypharmacy)
Participants with a moderate/major and even low risk for malnutrition (GNRI) were at higher risk
for low iron levels. The GNRI is a nutrition-related risk index that can predict the risk for morbidity and
mortality in hospitalized older adults, in relation to malnutrition-associated pathologies. Our finding
suggests that the GNRI may be a marker for subclinical iron deficiency in older adults. However, as the
GNRI has primarily been established for use in hospitalized older adults, it may not necessarily be
appropriate among community-dwelling older adults. Further research is warranted in this regard [26].
Men were at higher odds of having low iron levels, despite having higher median iron
concentrations than women (Table 2). Sex divergence may be due to the use of a higher cut-off
for men, as recommended in the literature [24]. Moreover, serum iron may increase after the ingestion
of iron-containing foods [6], suggesting that sex differences may also be due to unequal dietary intakes.
Finally, polypharmacy was inversely associated with iron status. Iron status in older adults is known to
be affected by a number of medications [6], including antacids and proton pump inhibitors. Knowing
which medication type may reduce iron levels is of interest from a prevention point of view and needs
further research.
4.3. Strengths and Weaknesses
The KORA-Age study is singular in the sense that it includes a large (>1000 participants) and
socio-demographically representative sample of old, and even very old, adults in Germany. Caution is
warranted when generalizing findings on a national level, as possible regional differences in eating
habits and latitude may exist. The assessment of multiple predictors of subclinical micronutrient
deficiency was rendered possible by the extensive health assessment of participants and the quality of
the KORA-Age data, which has been collected by trained interviewers and systematically controlled
before entry into the KORA-Age database.
The use of biomarkers of micronutrient status is both a strength and a limitation of our study.
Nutritional biomarkers may not necessarily reflect the amount of micronutrient intake from foods, and
may be affected by multi-morbidity, inflammation and nutrient-drug interactions, especially in older
adults. Nevertheless, biomarkers relate to the nutritional status of micronutrients after absorption in
the body, and can directly reflect subclinical deficiency at the blood level.
Certain laboratory procedures, used for the assessment of micronutrient status were not the ‘gold
standard’, e.g., the immunoassay procedure used in this study versus the commonly used Lactobacillus
rhamnosus microbiological assay for measuring serum folate levels [22]. Also, the use of serum iron
levels for the evaluation of iron status may be misleading because they are subject to diurnal rhythms
and increase after the ingestion of iron-containing foods. However, serum iron concentrations indicate
the adequacy of the iron supply to developing red blood cells [6], and may be used as a screening tool
for a subclinical deficiency, as opposed to an established clinical deficiency. To identify more advanced
cases of iron deficiency or anemia, additional measurements that use functional nutritional biomarkers
are essential, including serum/plasma soluble transferrin receptor, serum/plasma ferritin, or blood
hemoglobin measurements [22].
Another limitation arises from the cross-sectional design of this analysis, which precludes
any direct cause-effect relationships between subclinical micronutrient deficiency and predictors.
Also, causality cannot be definitively proven, owing to the possible correlation with other unknown
or unmeasured predictors. Yet, a causal effect in one or the other direction is possible and has to be
further examined in prospective studies.
5. Conclusions
Using serum nutritional biomarkers, determination of the magnitude of subclinical vitamin D,
folate, vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies, among KORA-Age older adults, revealed that more than half of
individuals had low 25OHD levels and more than a quarter had low vitamin B12 levels. The prevalence
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 1276
15 of 19
of subclinical deficiencies for both folate and iron (~10%) were less of a concern. Very old age, physical
inactivity, frailty and no/irregular use of micronutrient-containing supplements were identified as
common predictors of subclinical micronutrient deficiencies in the studied older adults.
Our findings provide further rationale for screening subgroups at high-risk for subclinical
micronutrient deficiencies.
The possibility that regular and appropriately dosed micronutrient
supplementation might help older adults otherwise unable to follow dietary guidelines in satisfying
their requirements, and prevent chronic diseases via the correction of low micronutrient levels, is
of major interest and could stimulate research on biological pathways that link supplement intake,
micronutrient status and disease state.
