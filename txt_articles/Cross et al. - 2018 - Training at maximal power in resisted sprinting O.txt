Abstract
Aims
In the current study we investigated the effects of resisted sprint training on sprinting perfor-
mance and underlying mechanical parameters (force-velocity-power profile) based on two
different training protocols: (i) loads that represented maximum power output (Lopt) and a
50% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity and (ii) lighter loads that repre-
sented a 10% decrease in maximum unresisted sprinting velocity, as drawn from previous
research (L10).
Methods
Soccer [n = 15 male] and rugby [n = 21; 9 male and 12 female] club-level athletes were indi-
vidually assessed for horizontal force-velocity and load-velocity profiles using a battery of
resisted sprints, sled or robotic resistance respectively. Athletes then performed a 12-ses-
sion resisted (10 × 20-m; and pre- post-profiling) sprint training intervention following the L10
or Lopt protocol.
Results
Both L10 and Lopt training protocols had minor effects on sprinting performance (average of
-1.4 to -2.3% split-times respectively), and provided trivial, small and unclear changes in
mechanical sprinting parameters. Unexpectedly, Lopt impacted velocity dominant variables to
a greater degree than L10 (trivial benefit in maximum velocity; small increase in slope of the
force-velocity relationship), while L10 improved force and power dominant metrics (trivial ben-
efit in maximal power; small benefit in maximal effectiveness of ground force orientation).

 Conclusions
Both resisted-sprint training protocols were likely to improve performance after a short train-
ing intervention in already sprint trained athletes. However, widely varied individualised
results indicated that adaptations may be dependent on pre-training force-velocity
characteristics.
Introduction
Many popular sporting codes feature some derivative of ‘sprinting’ as a central tenant of per-
formance. This ranges from sports where sprinting ability is the sole measure of success, such
as the 100-m dash, to sports requiring athletes to sprint while moving an external mass, such
as the bobsled. The relationship between sprinting acceleration and practical on-field success
is not synonymous across all sporting disciplines. For example, a rugby player has little need
for the same ability to generate high levels of velocity that are commonly witnessed in 200-m
sprinters. In contrast, a 200-m sprinter is typically much lighter than the average rugby player,
and never needs to partake in recurrent low-velocity collisions and driving forward with exter-
nal mass. As such, there are distinct bands of force and velocity capacities specific to individu-
als, and perhaps sporting codes, that would benefit from understanding if we are to maximize
the transfer between training and practical performance [1–3].
During sprint acceleration, as with many other maximal movements, the mechanical ability
to generate force under a range of velocities can be measured and expressed in the force-veloc-
ity (Fv) relationship. The integral of these two variables explains the ability of the athlete to
express and maximize power, and has been of interest in enhancing performance in a range of
movements and disciplines [4–6]. During multi-joint accelerative movements, the relationship
between external force production and velocity is typically fitted with linear regressions, with
power-velocity being parabolic and fitted using 2nd or 3rd order polynomial relationships [7].
The intercepts of this relationship represent the maximum capacity of the neuromuscular sys-
tem; the force production theoretically possible in the absence of velocity (F0), and the maxi-
mum theoretical velocity until which horizontal force can be produced (v0). Maximal power
(Pmax) is determined as the optimal combination of Fv capacities, existing in the centre of the
Fv relationship as the peak of the power-velocity (Pv) curve (for illustration, see Fig 1C). In the
case of sprinting, these relationships represent the diverse abilities of force production at a
range of velocities in a horizontal direction. The comparison of these variables, and the slope
of the linear regression between them (SFv), can provide insight into a number of factors
underlying performance [8]. For example, Fv profiles have been shown to differ between
rugby players [9] and may differentiate athletes who have suffered hamstring injury [10, 11].
In jumping, an ‘optimal profile’ can be calculated that, if attained, will maximize jump height
for a maintained level of Pmax ceteris paribus [1, 2, 12].
Fv characteristics are typically assessed using either a multiple trial method, comprising sev-
eral resisted trials performed against a range of resistance, or a single trial method, comprising
a single accelerative bout [7]. Both methods have been shown to provide linear Fv profiles in
field testing conditions using widely accessible tools [13–15]. Most research in sprint running
has used a single trial method, due to an ability to represent the mechanical output expressed
during a ‘free’ (i.e. unresisted) sprinting acceleration. Samozino et al. [13] recently validated a
method of profiling full sprinting acceleration phases using input data accessible to most
coaches (distance- or velocity-time data of sufficient frequency). While this method provides a

 simple means of gaining insight into the mechanical abilities expressed by an individual, it
does not yet provide a means of qualifying training goals and loading parameters [8]. Imple-
menting a multiple trial method [14] is much more taxing on the individual, but can provide
insight into loading parameters that may be of value in training implementation. This method
has been recently utilized in overground resisted sled sprinting utilizing known air and sled-
friction coefficients [16] and instantaneous maximum velocity (sports radar identical to that
validated for the single-trial method [13]). In fact, the multiple trial method provides similar
Fv data to that determined from a single sprint, and could be practically used to select loading
parameters that model the external mechanical characteristics experienced during sprint
phases [15]. Unfortunately, a clear practical problem with the multiple trial method is a need
for distinct knowledge of the complex friction characteristics at play [16]. While computing
friction coefficients is necessary in quantifying horizontal force production during resisted
sprints, and complex experimental designs are needed in research of this sort, it may be needed
to meet the aims of practitioners only interested in quantifying accurate training load. As will
be described in this paper, the advent of the single trial method [13, 15] makes it possible
to determine the individual optimal load without the need to directly quantify friction
coefficients.
Members of this research group recently published a study comparing the Fv data deter-
mined from trials of external loading to that of a single unloaded sprint, and found that

velocity profile of the athlete (data for a 1.73 m, 95-kg rugby player). Note that the exact same procedures were used with the soccer players, except that the initial raw
velocity data were recorded using a radar gun (as in Samozino et al. 2016).

 resisted sprint loads could feasibly model the external mechanical characteristics experienced
during sprint phases, albeit with some error [15]; the broad interpretation of this finding being
that training in targeted conditions may transfer to effective changes in specific force and veloc-
ity capacities, and concomitant changes in accelerative performance. As such, we believe the
most interesting factor regarding the Fv relationship when assessed during resisted sled sprint-
ing is the magnitude of loading corresponding to the various sections of the spectrum. A spe-
cific example are the loading conditions corresponding to Pmax (i.e. ‘optimal loading Lopt’ at
the optimal running velocity [vopt, Fig 1C]), which have shown to to constitute a resisted-sled
load of up to 96% of body-mass (~50% decrement in maximum velocity) [14]. Theoretically,
training using such a load may result in increased ability to produce Pmax, and a practical
increase in ability to transfer force throughout the sprinting phases (i.e. an increase in both
force and velocity capacities) [8]. While these theories are sound, and not novel with regards
to the wider circle of resistance training [8, 17], this concept is scarce in the narrative of the
sprint training literature and has not been tested experimentally.
Resisted sprinting has been implemented as a method of overloading capacities specific to
sprinting acceleration performance [18]. However until recently few researchers have
exceeded relatively light loading parameters (e.g. approximately ~10% velocity decrement) for
fear of creating dissimilar conditions to unresisted sprinting resulting in negative adaptations
(e.g. slower running velocity and/or altered running technique) [19–21]. This restriction in
approaches has resulted in a general lack of knowledge around the effects of training at magni-
tudes that would constitute anything other than a ‘velocity’ based external training stimuli
(based on the proposed model). There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that training
using much heavier resistances may be beneficial for accelerative performance [22, 23], how-
ever more evidence is required, especially with accurately and individually determined Lopt.
When it comes to manipulating the constraints of sprinting determinants, there is no real
consensus on the method of implementing resisted sprint training. The aim of this pilot study
in trained rugby and soccer players was to compare the effects on sprint performance and
mechanical outputs of a resisted sprint training program centred on the individual Lopt for
Pmax versus a control, lighter load associated with a decrement of 10% in maximal running
velocity (L10). We hypothesise that resisted sprint training in the individual optimal loading
condition (i.e. in the Fv zone of Pmax production) would result in greater improvement of
force and power capacity (i.e. early acceleration), than more traditional, lighter loading proto-
cols designed to develop the application of force at high velocities.
Methods
Participants and protocol
Participants were recruited, tested and trained at two locations: Finland and France. Both soc-
cer [15 males; 27.1±4.8 years; 176±3.6 cm; mean±SD], and rugby [9 males and 12 females; 27.1
±2.3; 175±9.7 cm; mean±SD] players volunteered to the study. They were all currently compet-
ing at club regional level (and within their national team for 5 rugby athletes) level and unin-
jured (<3 months pre-testing). All soccer players and all rugby players belonged to the same
teams, and they performed the very same soccer/rugby program (training sessions and games)
in addition to the sprint intervention. Soccer players did not perform any additional or gym-
based strength work, and rugby players (both male and female) performed one gym-based
strength maintenance session per week, with same content for all. Thus, any fluctuation would
be included within the results of all athletes as they were split into the different analysis groups.
The remaining team specific training was two soccer sessions (one rather intense and one of
lower intensity) and one official game per week for the soccer players, and two to three rugby

 training sessions for the rugby players, with one game during the weekend. The intervention
was performed in-season for both soccer and rugby players.
The procedures and methods used at each testing location were identical, with the excep-
tion of how horizontal resistance was applied to the athlete and running velocity sampled. Soc-
cer players used a resisted sled while rugby players used a portable robotic resistance device
(1080 Sprint, 1080 Motion, Lidingo
¨, Sweden). All athletes were accustomed with the testing
and training procedures and followed a progressive habituation training to heavy resistance
prior to the beginning of the study. This study was based on the assessment, and subsequent
prescription, of horizontally applied resistance based on the operational procedures outlined
in recent research [14]. The athletes were individually assessed for horizontal force-velocity
and load-velocity profiles, by utilizing a battery of sprints against increasing resistance (sled
loads or robotic resistance). Rigorous pilot testing was performed before deciding on the resis-
tance modalities. Both resistive techniques were able to provide targeted and constant decre-
ments in maximal resisted velocity–the likes of which is the essential target of applying loading
parameters, whatever the modality–and consequently presented very similar load/resistance-
velocity linear relationships. Since the methodology of this study was based on the sprinting
kinetics developed at maximum resisted velocity [14, 16], we posit that the modality of resis-
tance had a negligible effect, provided that the resistance experienced by the athlete was con-
stant and measureable at peak running velocity.
Athletes were divided randomly into training groups, within each team (soccer, male rugby
and female rugby), so that equal numbers of players formed the two intervention groups. This
random assignment ensured similar base values of maximal power output, gender and sport
practice. Moreover, this allocation procedure ensured that players in both groups followed
similar additional training content (soccer or rugby training, gym-based strength training or
official games) than their teammates from the other group. Because of the equal separation of
athletes to training groups, any differences in activities due to athlete code (e.g. increased
weight training volume in rugby player) should be accounted for in the group allocation and
subsequent results. The training intervention comprised of a 12-session training intervention
at a loading protocol that either represented a 10% decrement in their individual maximum
velocity (L10; n = 18), or at their individual optimal loading for maximal power (Lopt; n = 18).
Ethical approval was provided by the University of Jyva

obtained from the subjects prior to the study.
Equipment
Soccer players.
To provide resistance, athletes were harnessed at their waist and shoulders
(attachment point mid-low back via 3-m non-elastic tether) to a heavy-duty, custom-made
sprint sled loaded with a selection of weight plates. Sprinting performance was measured by a
sports radar gun (Model: Stalker ATS II, Applied Concepts, Dallas, TX, USA), attached to a tri-
pod set at 5 m and a height of 1 m, collecting outward bound velocity-time data at 46.9 Hz.
Training equipment was identical to that used during testing, with the exception of the radar
gun (which was only used during pre-, mid- and post-testing). The device has been widely
used in the assessment of sprinting speed [24], including in resisted sprinting using loads
equating that utilized in the current study [14].
Rugby players.
The resistance used for the assessment, and subsequent training, of rugby
players was applied using a robotic resistance device (1080 Sprint) featuring a servo motor
(2000 RPM OMRON G5 Series Motor, OMORON Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) to provide
resistance modes in 1 kg increments (1–30 kg load range). The motor is attached to a

 composite fiber cord that is wrapped around a spool, and attached to the athlete by a hip har-
ness around the pelvis. During operation, the device was placed on the ground, secured by a
selection of weight plates so as to render it immovable. The isotonic resistance mode was used
and horizontal resistance was selected in 1 kg increments closest to those determined by the
testing (%BM) and training protocol (Lopt and L10). Instantaneous velocity time data were col-
lected from the manufacturer software at a rate of 333-Hz. This device has been used in a
recently published resisted sprint study [25].
Pre- and post-training testing procedures
All testing procedures were completed on grass fields, where the athletes subsequently per-
formed their training. Athletes wore footwear typical to a maximal sprinting session. A stan-
dardised ~30-min warm-up including jogging, dynamic stretching, and submaximal 45-m
stride outs (70, 80 and 90% of maximal self-selected effort) was performed. A 5-min active-
recovery period directly preceded the commencement of testing, during which procedures
were verbally recommunicated. The testing battery consisted of two ‘unresisted’ maximal
30-m sprints, and four sprints performed with increasing resistive loads up to maximal achiev-
able velocity (vmax) with a 5-min passive rest between trials.
Each trial required the athlete to take up a standing split-stance, behind a marked line, and
sprint forward without any pre-start backward movement. When performing a resisted trial,
athletes were instructed to ‘lean-in’ to the tether, and take up all slack before any initial forward
movement, to ensure there was no ‘jerking’ or ‘bouncing’ of the sled. Athletes were instructed
to be as ‘forward’ as possible, to eliminate any backward movement or countermovement that
might affect their sprinting results. Verbal encouragement was provided to ensure a full maxi-
mal-effort throughout each trial.
Loading selection, and sprint distance.
Five sprinting conditions were prescribed for
each athlete: unresisted, 25, 50, 75 and 100% BM. Absolute loading parameters were used in
the sled condition, and converted to relative resistance (0.35 conversion coefficient, provided
by the manufacturer) in the robotic resistance condition. For example, if an athlete required a
40-kg load (50% of BM), the resistance programmed into the machine was set to 14-kg. The
span of loading parameters was selected to provide a wide array of data for each athlete and to
enable the accurate plotting of load-velocity relationships. Distances for each load were mod-
eled based on previous research [14] and pilot testing of what was required to reach maximal
velocity in the participants tested, as follows: 30-m unresisted, 30-m at 25%; 20-m at 50%;
20-m at 75%; 15-m at 100% BM or its´ 1080 Sprint equivalents.
Data analysis
Two types of data processing were applied in this study: (i) the assessment of sprint mechanical
outputs from the acceleration phase of an unresisted sprint (see details below and in Fig 1C);
and (ii) computation of individual loading parameters from multiple resisted sprints com-
bined into a load-velocity relationship (Fig 2B).
Sprint mechanical outputs.
For each unresisted trial, external horizontal force produc-
tion was modelled from centre of mass movement using a validated method (described in
detail elsewhere [13]). Briefly, a mono-exponential function was applied to raw velocity-time
data [7] using a purpose-built software platform (Build version: 14.0, National Instruments
Corp., Austin, TX, USA). From this point, macroscopically the acceleration of the athlete’s
centre-of-mass can be calculated with respect to changing vh over time. Net horizontal antero-
posterior ground reaction forces (Fh) can be modelled by considering the total system mass
(m; in this case, the body-mass of each given athlete), and aerodynamic friction force (Faero)

maximal velocity was averaged for the last 2 s of each sprint and plotted against load to obtain the linear load-velocity
profile, from which optimal load (Lopt) and the load that induced a 10% decrease in maximal velocity (L10) were
computed. Note that Lopt is produced at optimal velocity vopt = 0.5v0 [14], data described in Fig 1.

 were determined as the x and y intercepts of the linear regression and the slope (respectively).
Pmax was determined as the optimal combination between F0 and v0 ([F0, v0]/4) [7]. The opti-
mal conditions for power (vopt and Fopt) were calculated at the point of Pmax, corresponding to
0.5�v0 and 0.5�F0. A decrement of 10% from vmax was also calculated for application to the
load-velocity profile, which will be discussed in the following section. Ground reaction force
vector orientation (elsewhere termed “mechanical effectiveness of ground force application”
[26]) was quantified through the ratio of force (RF) [26], calculated as the ratio of the horizon-
tally-oriented (antero-posterior) component (i.e. Fh) to the total estimated ground-reaction
force signal. Note that RF is expressed in percent, but is the mathematical equivalent of the
angle of ground reaction force vector orientation. A high RF is equal to a more horizontally
directed ground reaction force vector [26], and vice versa. The linear decrease in RF with
velocity was calculated and presented as an index of ground reaction force vector orientation
throughout the acceleration phase (DRF) [26].
Load-velocity, Lopt and L10 computations.
The force-velocity relationship using multiple
trials of resistive loads has been previously validated shown to be linear [14]. Consequently, an
associated linear load-velocity profile can be created to represent a span of loading under
which mechanical conditions can be targeted.
Peak averaged 2-s velocity (i.e. the average velocity attained and maintained for 2-s at maxi-
mum effort) were taken for each sled load the athlete sprinted against, and matched with the
exact resistance protocol from each respective sprint (as close as possible to 25, 50, 75, and
100% of athlete’s average BM). The data were then fit with a least-square linear regression to
generate an individualised load-velocity profile for each athlete (Fig 2). In this data, the unre-
sisted sprint was included as either a ‘zero load’ condition, or against the minimal possible
resistance provided by the equipment (for sleds and robotic resistance, respectively). These
data were then combined with that calculated using the simple method [13], represented in
Fig 1, to calculate individualised training parameters to be applied for each training group. In
the case of the experimental group training at optimal loading (Lopt), the velocity at which
Pmax was produced (vopt) was substituted into the equation determined from the linear regres-
sion to provide the loading that corresponded to this velocity. The same method was applied
to the group training at a 10% decreased velocity, where the loading parameter corresponding
to a 10% decrement from the unresisted sprint maximum velocity (vmax) was determined by
applying entering this parameter into the linear regression. Specifically, the loading parameters
for the experimental group were calculated based on the fact that (i) the corresponding run-
ning velocity is vopt = 0.5v0 and (ii) the linear load-vmax relationship allows calculation of Lopt
from the known vopt. Using the same approach, for the control group, L10 was determined
using the same load-vmax relationship. In this case, L10 was determined as the loading corre-
sponding to 0.9�vmax. As a result, each athlete was provided with individualised resisted sprint
training parameters that constituted a specific mechanical condition experienced during an
unresisted sprint.
Application of training loads, and training modalities
Due to a lack of information on the best method of applying resisted sprint overload, the train-
ing protocol was the same as presented in a recent pilot study in soccer players [22].
After two sessions of familiarization to heavy and very heavy loads over the span of two
weeks, athletes were subject to a 12-session block of testing and training (Table 1). During ses-
sions 1 and 12, the optimal load (Lopt) and the load inducing a 10% decrease in maximal speed
(L10) were determined for each player as described in Figs 1 and 2. Sessions 2 to 10 consisted
of training (10 repetitions of 20 m resisted sprints, separated by approximately 5 min passive

 rest). At sessions 1, 6 (mid-program) and 12, the sprint force-velocity-power profiles were
determined using the field method of [13] over 2 unresisted 30-m sprints.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are presented as means ± standard deviation. Changes in athlete scores
were evaluated using effect sizes (ES) and 90% confidence limits. Magnitude-based inferences
were calculated using modified statistical Excel spreadsheets from sportsci.org (xPostOnly-
Crossover.xls; xParallelGroupsTrial.xls). Two separate statistical methods were used to assess
the effectiveness of each method of training. Pre- post-analysis was performed on each group’s
data, to provide a clear effect of whether there were substantial and clear changes as a result of
the training intervention. A second parallel group trials assessment compared the interven-
tions. The thresholds used to interpret the magnitude of effects measured were based on the
work of Hopkins and colleagues (sportsci.org) [27]. Probabilities that differences were higher,
lower or similar to the smallest worthwhile difference (preset at a value of 0.20) were evaluated
qualitatively as: possibly, 25–74.9%; likely, 75–94.9%, very likely, 95–99.5%; most (extremely)
likely, >99.5%. The true difference was assessed as unclear if the chance of both higher and
lower values was >5%.
Results
All Fv relationships, pre- and post-training were well fitted by linear regressions (all r2>0.98,
typical example in Fig 1C). Similar results were obtained for all linear load-velocity relation-
ships for both the radar and the 1080 Sprint protocols (all r2>0.924).
The main result from the group comparison (Lopt versus L10 between-group differences)
showed a likely trivial between-group difference in 20-m performance and Pmax increase post-
training. All results are presented in Table 2, with between-groups differences presented in Table 3.
Discussion
Overall, both optimally loaded (Lopt) and ‘10% decrease in vmax’ loaded interventions (L10)
provided beneficial effects in a range of performance variables (Table 2). The magnitude of

 changes experienced were often marginal (small and trivial), and there was a lack of clear dis-
tinction in the group effects between the training cohorts (Table 3). Our initial hypothesis was
that conditions of high horizontal force exhibited during training would transfer into a linked
increase in the corresponding mechanical capacity (i.e. increased F0), with training in condi-
tions of lower force resulting in emphasised improvements in the opposite capacity (v0).
Instead, what we observed were clear trends for small changes in both force and velocity capa-
bilities as a result of both modalities of training. Among the possible explanations of this unex-
pected result is a possible interaction effect between pre-test values of Fv profiles, and the
timing of post-training measurements, that was common to all subjects; this and other points
will be discussed towards the end of this article.
A detailed commentary of the methods, including suggestions of how they may be best
applied in a practical context, is available as supplementary material (S1 Table and S1 Text).
While this section includes discussion of the results as they pertain to the outcome of the train-
ing implementation, we believe this additional content is important for practitioners wishing
to implement the methods in the field, without an ability to access the types of equipment
widely available to researchers.
L10 produced small measureable increases in practical performance measures, with a reduc-
tion in sprint times between -2.28 to -1.96%. However, Lopt produced negligible group changes
overall -1.40 to -1.81%. The changes observed were within the range (-0.5 to -9.12%) reported

 in a recent systematic review [18] from a range of resisted sprint training interventions. The
comparison between the effects of the training interventions were largely inconclusive, with
the majority of comparative analyses requiring more data to provide clear statistical inferences
(changes are unclear; Table 3). These results appear to stand in opposition to the theory that
training in conditions that represent a particular mechanical condition will transfer to changes
in said condition [8, 15]. Indeed, a recent example in jumping [12] clearly showed that training
in the conditions of high force resulted in developments of this capacity. Moreover, previous
literature on resisted sprinting (albeit limited in nature) remains unclear, and more research is
required to test whether heavier training may specifically benefit the development of accelera-
tion based stimuli [18]. As such, these somewhat counterintuitive results will be discussed fur-
ther in the paragraphs following.
The result of lighter loading providing a platform for the development of maximum force,
and conversely heavier loading developing velocity, appears to refute our initial hypothesis of
specific mechanical adaptations in sprint training. There are some factors that we believe may
help clarify these unexpected results. Firstly, the change scores and associated inferences were
relatively similar (although clear) between training protocols (Table 2). While the statistical
interpretation for some effects was different (i.e. trivial vs. small), it could be questioned
whether these results were separated by enough of a margin to be practically worthwhile.
Regardless, this simply would appear to support a conclusion that loading may not substan-
tially affect the outcomes of this manner of resistive sprint training. One possible explanation
for this unexpected outcome may be found in the spread of results observed in the team sport
players studied. For example, while the effects of the training interventions were different in

 respect to their effects on RF%max (small inference, likely negative), the range of change scores
observed from the groups were wide (12.15 ± 15.50% and 7.96 ± 12.52%, for L10 and Lopt
changes, respectively). These results may suggest that while there were no statistically measure-
able differences in the groups at baseline with regards to practical performance measures, the
adaptations experienced by the athletes studied were highly individualised.
We theorise a scenario where athletes adapted to the stimuli provided to them based on the
level and balance of Fv capacities exhibited pre-test (i.e. their initial Fv profile). For example,
athletes with a more velocity-oriented profile (i.e. less negative SFv or flatter linear Fv relation-
ship) may have improved their force capacity, regardless of the magnitude of resistive stimulus
applied; it is important to note that resisted sprint training using loading constituting L10 train-
ing (or indeed lighter) may represent force-dominant training for some athlete presenting a
low F0/RF%max profile. The unfortunate factor about this theory, is that due to the limited
information on sprint Fv profile it is difficult to qualify a priori individual strengths and weak-
nesses in mechanical capacities. One possible avenue of such an approach is comparing indi-
vidual scores to a group average/median value, however due to a current lack of normative
data these types of analyses are not possible. In jumping the existence of an individualized opti-
mal balance between mechanical capacities has been proven [2], and it is possible that a model
of individual optimal Fv capacities applies to that developed during a sprint running accelera-
tion phase. If such an approach is validated in sprinting, an athlete’s particular orientation
with regards to this theoretical optimal profile may influence their results from a given training
program. This may, partially explain why some athletes in this study improved and not others,
even when presented with a greater ‘force-oriented’ stimulus (Lopt sled). To further explore
this theory, we tested the correlation between individual pre-score SFv and training-induced
changes in F0 and observed a significant interaction effect (r = 0.39; P<0.02). Similarly,
changes in RF%max appeared to be related to the pre-intervention levels expressed in each indi-
vidual (r = -0.66; P<0.0001). Simply, changes in RF%max were greater for participants who pre-
sented lower values pre-intervention, whatever training method they followed. Consequently,
it seems logical that an athlete expressing a low RF%max value would improve his RF%max fol-
lowing training using a lighter stimuli (L10) than an athlete with high RF%max value following
heavier training (Lopt). However, no statistically observable differences were found between
groups in these variables at baseline. Taken present and previous findings together, the quest
for effective training load stimuli to improve sprint mechanical output and performance re-
quires a more individualized approach as to the specific needs (and thus margins of improve-
ment) of athletes. These theories require further investigation, and we recommend that in the
future, athletes should be assigned to intervention group(s) based on their initial Fv character-
istics [12], rather than randomly as in the current pilot study.
Another possible consideration is the different nature of what happened within sprints dur-
ing the resisted sprint stimulus before the athletes reached maximal resisted speed (note: maxi-
mum resisted velocity is methodologically the point around which loading was profiled,
allocated and trained). It is possible that while the conditions at maximum resisted velocity tar-
geted specific adaptations in the way that we hypothesized [15], the time spent before that
peak was attained (i.e. 2 to 4 seconds depending on the participants, Fig 2A) while accelerating
confounded the results. That is, during each sprint of the training program, the Lopt group
probably spent ~4 seconds below vopt (thus training at vopt only a very short amount of time in
the sprint), and as a consequence potentially not enough time at Pmax. (~2–3 seconds). Perhaps
if the athletes had performed less sprints, but more time at vopt (~6 seconds) we may have seen
different adaptations. There seems to be a trade-off between accelerating from zero to vopt and
maintaining vopt at the targeted Pmax velocity. Although it might be technically challenging to
use such a setting in sprint running, future research could investigate the effect of a resistance

 onset applied only once the athletes have reached vopt after an unresisted acceleration, as in
sprint cycling [28, 29]. This type of investigation could clarify the role played by the accelera-
tion phase work against Lopt compared to the work performed in the Fopt / vopt conditions as a
stimulus to improve Pmax.
Finally, all athletes were tested post-training at the same time after the last session of the
protocol. It cannot be ruled out that the systematic 2-week time window used between the
end-of-training and post-testing was not optimal for some athletes. It is possible that the adap-
tation necessary to transfer heavy-sled resistance training over several sessions to improve
sprint acceleration performance and mechanical outputs may have taken longer in some ath-
letes. As seen in elite rugby players following a development and tapering protocol [30], and
confirmed by our experience with elite players using heavy-resistance sprint training (unpub-
lished data), sprint performance and physical qualities show variable kinetics of ‘peak adapta-
tion’. Such variability is included in a ‘single post-training measurement session’ design.
However, since this is the case in most sprint training studies, further research should deter-
mine the training-induced adaptation kinetics after heavy-sled resisted training in order to
verify if, and to what extent, athletes show peak adaptation windows and between-participants
variability in the occurrence of these peaks. Overall, the efficacy of a range of periodization
protocols on adaptations, including total sprinting load (per session, and macro-cycle length),
and tapering lengths (i.e. time course of adaptations in following weeks), should be studied in
more detail, to allow for peak performance following a resisted sprint training program.
Limitations and future directions
There are a number of limitations that need to be considered in the interpretation of the results
of this study. Namely, while the aims of this research were to provide a clear insight into the
effects of training using differing loading protocols and clarify the effects of training at high/
low loads, we believe the sample studied (e.g. size, sporting codes, mixed-sex) may have influ-
enced our results. Future researchers should look to replicate similar studies with larger and
more homogenous cohorts (e.g. 100-m sprinters). In addition, no group was used in this study
with players performing an equivalent program of unresisted (no additional load) sprints.
Thus we cannot compare the results obtained in the Lopt and L10 groups to those of standard,
unresisted sprint training. This decision was made due to the constraints inherent to an in-sea-
son study in a team sport competition context, and because such a sprint training program
resulted overall in trivial changes in sprint acceleration mechanical outputs and performance
in the control group of a similar protocol [22]. Partly for the same reason (in-season interven-
tion in competitors), the Lopt program (Table 1) did not include sprints at Lopt exclusively, but
a load progression was set over the first four weeks of training. This was performed in addition
to the familiarization sessions prior to the intervention to ensure a safe and progressive adapta-
tion to the high-load stimulus. One consequence was that the Lopt group did a total of 80
sprints at Lopt and 20 sprints at L10 over the 10 weeks of training versus 100 sprints at L10 in the
L10 group. Although we do not think this is a major bias, further intervention should use per-
fectly balanced training content between groups. While the surfaces used for training were
controlled and maintained to the best of our ability, with weather relatively stable throughout
the experiments, it is possible that minor variations in surface conditions may have affected
the resistance experienced by the athletes using sled resistance [16]. Moreover, it is possible
that the use of different methods of providing resistance to the athletes may have affected the
results. While we assume that the two devices provided identical type resistance at their maxi-
mal resisted velocity, it is possible the actual characteristics of the resistance experienced by the
athletes may have differed to a degree not captured by matched velocity measurement. To our

 knowledge, no research exists on the topic of differing methods of applying matched horizon-
tal resistance, however the topic should be of interest to coaches looking at the best method
applying such loading to meet their athletes’ specific needs.
Conclusion
Seemingly in contrast to our hypothesis, the group effects of sprint training at optimal power
did not appear to be substantially different than training using traditional lighter loading proto-
cols. However, individual adaptations to the type of training imposed were varied, leading us to
conclude that pre-training Fv profile (among other confounding factors) may have contributed
to the results observed in the athletes. Despite seeming lack of clarity in these results, it should
be noted that both resisted-sprint training protocols were likely to improve performance after a
short training intervention in already sprint trained athletes. We hope the results of this study
will add to the developing narrative of resisted sprint literature, and will serve to guide future,
well-designed research in the area of individualised programming for resisted sprinting.
