Abstract
Background
Attempted suicide is the main risk factor for suicide and repeated suicide attempts. How-
ever, the evidence for follow-up treatments reducing suicidal behavior in these patients is
limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Attempted Sui-
cide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP) in reducing suicidal behavior. ASSIP is a novel
brief therapy based on a patient-centered model of suicidal behavior, with an emphasis on
early therapeutic alliance.
Methods and Findings
Patients who had recently attempted suicide were randomly allocated to treatment as usual
(n = 60) or treatment as usual plus ASSIP (n = 60). ASSIP participants received three ther-
apy sessions followed by regular contact through personalized letters over 24 months. Par-
ticipants considered to be at high risk of suicide were included, 63% were diagnosed with
an affective disorder, and 50% had a history of prior suicide attempts. Clinical exclusion cri-
teria were habitual self-harm, serious cognitive impairment, and psychotic disorder. Study
participants completed a set of psychosocial and clinical questionnaires every 6 months
over a 24-month follow-up period.
The study represents a real-world clinical setting at an outpatient clinic of a university
hospital of psychiatry. The primary outcome measure was repeat suicide attempts during
the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures were suicidal ideation,
depression, and health-care utilization. Furthermore, effects of prior suicide attempts,
depression at baseline, diagnosis, and therapeutic alliance on outcome were investigated.
During the 24-month follow-up period, five repeat suicide attempts were recorded in the
ASSIP group and 41 attempts in the control group. The rates of participants reattempting

 suicide at least once were 8.3% (n = 5) and 26.7% (n = 16). ASSIP was associated with an
approximately 80% reduced risk of participants making at least one repeat suicide attempt
(Wald χ2
1 = 13.1, 95% CI 12.4–13.7, p < 0.001). ASSIP participants spent 72% fewer days
in the hospital during follow-up (ASSIP: 29 d; control group: 105 d; W = 94.5, p = 0.038).
Higher scores of patient-rated therapeutic alliance in the ASSIP group were associated with
a lower rate of repeat suicide attempts. Prior suicide attempts, depression, and a diagnosis
of personality disorder at baseline did not significantly affect outcome. Participants with a
diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (n = 20) had more previous suicide attempts
and a higher number of reattempts.
Key study limitations were missing data and dropout rates. Although both were generally
low, they increased during follow-up. At 24 months, the group difference in dropout rate was
significant: ASSIP, 7% (n = 4); control, 22% (n = 13). A further limitation is that we do not
have detailed information of the co-active follow-up treatment apart from participant self-
reports every 6 months on the setting and the duration of the co-active treatment.
Conclusions
ASSIP, a manual-based brief therapy for patients who have recently attempted suicide,
administered in addition to the usual clinical treatment, was efficacious in reducing suicidal
behavior in a real-world clinical setting. ASSIP fulfills the need for an easy-to-administer
low-cost intervention. Large pragmatic trials will be needed to conclusively establish the effi-
cacy of ASSIP and replicate our findings in other clinical settings.

Introduction
The high toll of deaths by suicide is a major global public health problem [1]. In spite of a
broad range of prevention efforts, suicide rates have not declined [2]. Rates in the US have
increased in recent years [3], and the number of suicide attempts in adults has been estimated
to be about 1.3 million per year [4]. Individuals with a history of attempted suicide have rightly
been identified as a main target group for clinical suicide prevention [5]. A recent meta-analy-
sis reported a 1-year rate of hospital admissions due to repeat attempts of 17%, with a rate of
self-reported reattempts of 21.9% [6]. The risk of completed suicide for individuals who have
previously attempted suicide is from 40 to over a 100 times higher than that of the general pop-
ulation [7,8]. The risk increases with each subsequent suicide attempt, and remains high for
more than 30 years [9]. However, there is a lack of interventions demonstrating a long-term
reduction of suicidal behavior [10,11]. Exceptions are the treatment studies by Fleischmann
et al. [12], Brown et al. [11], and, most recently, Rudd et al. [13] reporting significant risk
reductions over 18, and 24 months. The Fleischmann et al. study was a multicenter study in
which 1,867 individuals who had attempted suicide were offered a brief psychoeducative ses-
sion combined with long-term contact with phone calls or visits over a period of 18 months.
The intervention group had significantly fewer deaths from suicide than the group with usual
treatment. In the Brown et al. study, which included 120 participants who had attempted sui-
cide, the intervention group received at least ten (up to 24) sessions of cognitive therapy with
an emphasis on developing safety plans for future suicidal crises. Case managers ensured

 treatment adherence of “no show” patients and compliance to ongoing psychiatric treatment. The
cognitive therapy group had a significantly lower reattempt rate and a 50% reduced risk of reat-
tempting suicide during 18 months of follow-up. In their study with 152 active-duty soldiers, Rudd
and co-workers found that a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy with 12 to 16 or more sessions plus
usual mental health care (including case managers) was associated with a 60% lower risk of attempt-
ing suicide during 24 months of follow-up. Other studies have found that minimal outreach inter-
ventions after attempted suicide, such as contacting patients with regular postcards or standardized
letters, are associated with a reduction of suicides [14–16], although findings have not been consis-
tent [17,18]. Considering the limited resources available for the provision of adequate treatment for
patients who attempt suicide, there is a clear need for brief, focused, and effective treatments [19].
A major barrier to effective treatment is poor treatment compliance, with 50% or more of
patients failing to attend or withdrawing from follow-up treatment within 1 week [20,21]. One
reason for this may be that suicidal patients often feel misunderstood by health professionals
[22]. According to the traditional medical model, clinicians tend to see suicide as a symptom of
mental disorder, while, for people in a suicidal crisis, the central issue is their very personal
experience of pain, anguish, hopelessness, and loss of self-esteem [23]. Although adequate
treatment of the psychiatric disorder associated with suicidal behavior is important, exploring
the very individual, subjective experience of a suicidal crisis requires a patient-centered, collab-
orative treatment approach [22]. In line with such an approach is the concept of suicide as
goal-directed action [24], in which suicide is seen as a solution to a subjectively unbearable
mental state. Central to action theory is the notion that people have the narrative competence
to explain their actions, i.e., how they reached the point of harming themselves. We previously
reported an association between a narrative interviewing style and therapeutic alliance [25].
Therapeutic alliance is a consistent predictor of outcome across psychotherapies [26]. Based
on guidelines for clinicians formulated by an international working group [27], we developed a
brief therapy program for patients who have recently attempted suicide, the Attempted Suicide
Short Intervention Program (ASSIP). A major focus of ASSIP lies in the development of an
early therapeutic alliance, combined with psychoeducation, a cognitive case conceptualization,
safety planning, and continued long-term outreach contact.
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ASSIP plus treatment as
usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone in reducing the rate of repeated suicide attempts during
24-month of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were suicidal ideation, depression, and
health-care utilization. Furthermore, we investigated the moderating effect of baseline factors
such as therapeutic alliance in the therapy sessions, prior suicide attempts, depression at base-
line, and diagnosis on outcome.
Methods
Design
Patients admitted to the emergency unit of the Bern University General Hospital following
attempted suicide were seen on a routine basis by the duty psychiatrist, who asked them for
their consent to be contacted by the study team. The signed agreement forms were then for-
warded to the study team. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned
to the ASSIP or the control group. Simple randomization was carried out using shuffled
unmarked sealed envelopes. Similar to a modified Zelen design [28,29], participants were con-
tacted following randomization and informed that they had been allocated to one of the two
groups. Participants in the control group were offered a single assessment interview. This
was considered necessary for ethical and safety reasons [30]. Written informed consent was
obtained from participants of both groups after detailed description of the study. Suicidality

 was assessed with the Suicide Status Form (SSF-III) [31] at the initial session. Both groups con-
tinued TAU. Study therapists did not have any influence on TAU. A set of questionnaires was
filled out by participants after the initial session and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
Local regulations did not require registration of the study before patient recruitment started
in 2009. In Switzerland, the Federal Act on Research Involving Human Beings, which requires
registration in a public registry, was implemented January 1, 2014. Registration at
ClinicalTrials.gov was done after completion of the study. We have not conducted and are not
currently conducting any related clinical trials. Future trials will be registered prospectively.
The study procedure was approved by the local ethics committee in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki [32]. The original project description was evaluated by the research
ethics committee of the University of Bern (registration number 144/08, Kantonale Ethikkom-
mission Bern). The trial protocol was submitted on October 9, 2008, resubmitted on April 27,
2009, and accepted on May 22, 2009 (S1 Text).
The study was conducted according to the trial protocol, with minor changes made in the
course of the study: (1) the total number of participants in the study protocol (80) was later
increased to 120 due to a revised power calculation; (2) time intervals of more than 3 months
between suicide attempt and first interview were allowed due to the high number of referrals to
the study; (3) habitual self-harm as an exclusion criterion was added later for clarification (see the
definition of attempted suicide in “Participants”); (4) in response to peer review, reattempt-free
survival, hazard ratios, and group differences were calculated based on multiple imputed datasets.
Power Analysis and Sample Size
Power calculations were based on the results of previous randomized controlled trials with a
comparable design [33,34]. We estimated an expected repetition risk of 30% in the control
group, and 15% in the treatment group. We calculated the required sample size for the compar-
ison of survival curves between two groups under the Cox proportional hazards model for clin-
ical trials [35]. For a desired statistical power of 80% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.44 for time to
next suicide attempt between treatment groups, with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, a total
sample size of n = 116 was required.
Participants
All participants included in the study had recently attempted suicide. Attempted suicide was
defined according to Silverman et al. [36] as a “self-inflicted, potentially injurious behavior
with a nonfatal outcome for which there is evidence (either explicit or implicit) of intent to
die.” In German-speaking countries, similar to in North America, self-harm is usually defined
as non-suicidal self-injury, different from suicidal behavior with intent to die [37]. We there-
fore deemed it necessary to explicitly exclude habitual self-harm, which is typically associated
with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Further exclusion criteria were seri-
ous cognitive impairment, psychotic disorder, insufficient mastery of the German language,
and residency outside the hospital catchment area. Information regarding the circumstances of
the suicide attempt was collected from the hospital records. For diagnostic information, we
used the hospital diagnoses based on the 10th revision of the International Classification of
Diseases [38]. Up to four psychiatric diagnoses per participant were recorded.
ASSIP Treatment Protocol
ASSIP was administered in three 60- to 90-min sessions, usually on a weekly basis. A fourth session
was added if necessary. These face-to-face therapy sessions were supplemented by regular, person-
alized letters to the participants for 24 months. The manual used throughout the study was first

 published in German [39] in May 2013; the translation in English [40] followed in June 2015. The
manual is highly structured, and interventions for each session are described in detail.
First session.
A narrative interview [41] was conducted in which patients were asked to
tell their personal stories about how they had reached the point of attempting suicide. The aim
of the narrative interview is to reach—in a biographical context—a patient-centered under-
standing of the individual mechanisms leading to suicidal behavior and to elicit specific vulner-
ability factors and trigger events. All interviews were video-recorded, with the patients’ written
consent. Suicide risk was assessed using the SSF-III [31].
Second session.
Patient and therapist, seated side-by-side, watched sequences of the
video-recorded first session. The aim of the video playback [42] is to reactivate the patient’s
mental state during the suicidal crisis, in a safe environment, and provide a detailed reconstruc-
tion of the transition from an experience of psychological pain and stress to the suicidal action.
Automatic thoughts, emotions, physiological changes, and contingent behavior were identified.
Patients received a psychoeducative handout (“Suicide Is Not a Rational Act”) as a homework
task (S2 Text), to be returned with personal comments at the next session. Following the ses-
sion, the therapist prepared a written draft of the case conceptualization.
Third session.
The patients’ comments to the handout were discussed. The case conceptu-
alization was revised collaboratively. A list of long-term goals, individual warning signs, and
safety strategies was developed in close cooperation with the patient. The written case concep-
tualization and the personal safety strategies were printed out and given to the patient, with
additional copies for other health professionals involved in treatment. Long-term goals, warn-
ing signs, and safety strategies were copied to a credit-card-size folded leaflet and given to the
patient. In addition, participants received a crisis card with a list of telephone numbers of pri-
vate and professional helpers who could be contacted in case of a suicidal crisis. Patients were
instructed to carry both with them at all times, and to use them in the event of a crisis.
Letters. Participants were sent semi-standardized letters over a period of 24 months, every
3 months in the first year and every 6 months in the second year. The letters reminded partici-
pants of the long-term risk of future suicidal crises and the importance of the safety strategies.
Letters were signed personally by the ASSIP therapist. Usually, one or two personal sentences
were added, and participants were invited to give feedback about how things were going.
For further details see ASSIP manual [40].
Control Group
Participants assigned to the control group underwent a single clinical interview, which included a
structured suicide risk assessment using the SSF-III. A written summary of the risk assessment
was sent to the health professionals responsible for the participant’s usual clinical care.
ASSIP Therapists
ASSIP was provided by four therapists: two clinicians experienced in clinical suicide prevention
(K. M., psychiatrist, and A. G.-M., psychologist) and two therapists (M. M. and S. Bühler, both
psychologists) with an average of 2 years in clinical practice, who were introduced to ASSIP
and the study procedures during a 1-week training. Adherence to the highly structured treat-
ment manual, which provides clear tasks for each session, was ensured by regular peer reviews
and supervision using the video-recorded interviews.
Treatment as Usual
Information on the co-active treatment was based on patient’s self-reports in the set of ques-
tionnaires completed every 6 months. In both groups, TAU included inpatient, day patient,

 and individual outpatient care as considered necessary by the clinicians in charge of patient
management. Some patients changed from inpatient to outpatient status during ASSIP ses-
sions. Thirty-eight (63%) participants in the ASSIP group and 32 (53%) in the control group
were on psychotropic drugs at the time of the initial interview.
Measures
The set of questionnaires was completed by the study participants at the conclusion of the ini-
tial session, and identical questionnaires were sent to both groups every 6 months over a period
of 2 years.
Personal and sociodemographic characteristics.
A 33-item questionnaire was developed
to collect sociodemographic and health-related data, including information on suicidal behav-
ior. The questions related to suicidal behavior and self-harm were as follows: (1) “Did you in
the past 6 months try to take your own life?”; (2) “How often did you in the past 6 months have
thoughts about taking your own life?”; and (3) “How often did you in the past 6 months physi-
cally harm yourself (e.g., cutting, burning, hitting)?”. According to the definition of attempted
suicide used in this study, physical self-harm during follow-up was not recorded as a suicide
attempt. In order to complete outcome data at the end of the follow-up period, we searched
hospital records and contacted the responsible general practitioners and therapists to check for
suicide attempts and completed suicide.
Penn Helping Alliance Questionnaire.
The 11-item self-rating Penn Helping Alliance
Questionnaire (HAq) [43] was used to evaluate the quality of the patient–therapist relationship
(therapeutic alliance). The HAq has demonstrated good validity for psychotherapy outcomes
[44]. The German version [45] was used.
Beck Depression Inventory.
The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to
measure the severity of depression [46,47].
Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS)—a 21-item
self-report instrument measuring the intensity of the patients’ attitudes, behaviors, and plans
related to suicidal behavior [48,49]—was used.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis was conducted on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population to ensure unbiased com-
parisons between the two groups and to address concerns regarding withdrawal and noncom-
pliance. To address the issue of missing data, multiple imputations by chained equations were
implemented. Estimates of 20 imputed datasets were combined using Rubin’s rule; the mean
and 95% CI of the test statistics and p-values are reported. We calculated standard errors and
CIs for the Cox hazards coefficients based on the square root of the within-individual variance
of the individual imputed datasets and the between-individual variance across the multiple
imputed datasets. We found no differences between analyses conducted with the original and
the imputed dataset. In the survival analysis, binary events were used (0 = no suicide attempt in
the follow-up; 1 = one or more suicide attempts in the follow-up). A p-value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant, and all tests were two-sided. Survival analyses of partici-
pants who made a repeat suicide attempt at least once during the follow-up period were con-
ducted using the Kaplan-Meier estimator [50]. Log-rank tests (Mantel-Haenszel test) were
performed to calculate survival curve differences between the two groups, and associated Wald
χ2 tests were conducted to test the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments at any
assessment time point. A Cox proportional hazards regression model [51] for discrete data
using “exact partial likelihoods” was used to determine hazard ratios for the two groups.
Demographic data and secondary outcome measures were analyzed using nonparametric

 methods (χ2 tests, Mann-Whitney U test) in the case of count variables (e.g., days of hospitali-
zation, number of suicide attempts) or where data were not normally distributed. BSS and BDI
scores were analyzed using ANCOVA. As a sensitivity analysis and to account for potentially
autoregressive relationships among scores, we also fitted mixed effects regression models.
All analyses were performed using the SPSS 18.0 software package and R (version 3.2.1;
http://www.r-project.org) with the packages “survival” (v. 2.38) and “mice” (v. 2.22).
Data are deposited in the Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.85nf3 [52].
Results
Enrollment Statistics
Between June 2009 and December 2012, 291 individuals were referred to the study (see Fig 1);
98 (34%) did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 73 (25%) refused to participate in the study.
The most frequent reasons for exclusion were language problems and psychotic disorders. Of
those who refused to participate, several denied having had suicidal intention and others
refused any kind of treatment or gave circumstantial reasons, such as work commitments and
lack of child care, for not being able to attend treatment sessions. Ultimately, 120 patients were
randomly assigned to the study groups.
Participant Characteristics
Fifty-four (45%) male (mean age 40 years, SD = 14) and sixty-six (55%) female (mean age 36
years, SD = 14) participants entered the study (see Table 1). Sixty-three percent were diagnosed
with affective disorder, 44% with neurotic and stress-related disorder, and 25% with substance
abuse disorder (see Table 1). Prior suicide attempts were reported by 50%; 26% had a history of
multiple (two or more) prior suicide attempts. Intentional overdosing was the most frequent
method used (68%), followed by cutting (13%), jumping (7%), and hanging, shooting, and
drowning (10%). Treatment and control groups did not differ in demographic or clinical vari-
ables, with the exception of the number of outpatient sessions prior to the index suicide attempt.
Attrition Rates and Missing Data
The dropout rates for the ASSIP and control groups were 5% (n = 3) and 22% (n = 13) at 12
months, and 7% (n = 4) and 22% (n = 13) at 24 months, respectively. Reasons for withdrawal
from the study were, e.g., refusal to cooperate because of change of ASSIP therapist during fol-
low-up, or, in the control group, seeing “too little profit.” In each group, one death by suicide
was recorded: one participant in the ASSIP group died by suicide in an acutely psychotic state,
and one participant in the control group died by suicide while in hospital care. Three natural
deaths occurred in the control group. The number of missed assessments (questionnaires) did
not significantly differ between groups (χ2
3 = 7.08, p = 0.07), with the largest difference in
missed assessments observed at 24 months (ASSIP group: 10%; control group: 37%).
Primary Outcome Measures
Repeated suicide attempts.
During the 24-month follow-up period, five reattempts were
recorded in the ASSIP group, and 41 reattempts in the control group (see Table 2). The rates of
participants reattempting suicide at least once were 8.3% (n = 5) and 26.7% (n = 16), respec-
tively (ITT analysis). Using the Kaplan-Meier estimator with multiple imputations, the esti-
mated mean suicide-attempt-free survival rate at 12 months was 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1.00) in
the ASSIP group and 0.93 (95% CI 0.89–0.96) in the control group (Fig 2; Table 3). At 24
months, the mean rates were 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–1.00) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.71–0.87),

 respectively. The group difference in number of participants reattempting suicide was signifi-
cant (log-rank/Mantel-Haenszel test, mean χ2
1 = 16.5, 95% CI 15.4–17.6; mean p < 0.001).
The mean hazard ratio was 0.17 (95% CI 0.07–0.46), indicating that the ASSIP group had an
83% reduced risk of attempting suicide during the 24-month follow-up period compared to the
control group (Wald χ2
1 = 13.1, 95% CI 12.4–13.7, p < 0.001).
We used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the effect of four
baseline covariates on outcome: BDI sum score, previous suicide attempts, diagnosis (sub-
stance abuse disorder, affective disorder, neurotic and acute stress reaction, personality disor-
der), and recent outpatient treatment (number of sessions in the past 6 months). This model
revealed a hazard ratio for suicide reattempt for the ASSIP group of 0.15 (95% CI 0.05–0.44,
p < 0.001) compared to the control group. For the BDI sum score and the diagnosis of person-
ality disorders the hazard ratios were 0.96 (95% CI 0.93–0.99, p = 0.016) and 0.39 (95% CI
0.17–0.89, p = 0.022), respectively. Prior suicide attempts, a diagnosis of substance abuse, and
number of outpatient sessions did not contribute to the model. The overall model showed a

 significant group difference (Wald χ2
8 = 31.9, 95% CI 30.3–33.4, p < 0.001). ASSIP was associ-
ated with an 85% reduced risk of participants making at least one repeat suicide attempt. A
diagnosis of personality disorder was associated with a 61% higher risk of reattempting suicide,
while the BDI sum score increased the risk by 4% per unit.
Furthermore, we tested the effect of a history of multiple suicide attempts on outcome by
including “two or more prior attempts” as a covariate. The treatment effect remains, with a
hazard ratio of 0.22 (95% CI 0.08–0.61), indicating a 78% reduction of risk due to ASSIP. The
overall model is significant (Wald χ2
2 = 23.5, 95% CI 22.4–24.6, p < 0.001).
Participants with a diagnosis of BPD had more previous suicide attempts (median = 2, inter-
quartile range [IQR] = 1–2.25) than other participants (median = 0, IQR = 0–1, W = 1,450,
p < 0.001). We therefore separated the 20 participants with BPD from the total sample for addi-
tional analysis. For the 100 remaining participants, suicide-attempt-free survival at 24-month
was 0.96 (95% CI 0.91–1.00) for the ASSIP group and 0.84 (95% CI 0.76–0.93) for the control
group (see Fig 2). The therapy effect was significant (χ2
1 = 12.7, 95% CI 11.8–13.5, p < 0.001),
with a mean hazard ratio of 0.11 (95% CI 0.03–0.49), indicating that when individuals with BPD
were excluded, the ASSIP group had a 89% lower risk of attempting suicide during the 24-month
follow-up period than the control group (Wald χ2
1 = 8.7, 95% CI 8.3–9.1, p = 0.004).
We additionally tested the sensitivity of the treatment effect. In our model, we predicted the
primary outcome, one or more suicide reattempts, by treatment and by previous suicide
attempts using a logistic regression. We found a significant effect of treatment (coeffi-
cient = 1.66, 95% CI 0.58–2.88, p = 0.004), while the effect of previous suicide attempts was not
significant (coefficient = 0.20, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.44, p = 0.08). This finding is consistent across
all imputed datasets (therapy effect, mean p = 0.004, 95% CI 0.003–0.006; previous suicide
attempts, mean p = 0.10, 95% CI 0.07–0.12).
Secondary Outcome Measures
Suicide ideation.
Differences in suicide ideation (BSS) during the four follow-up measure-
ments were investigated using a mixed-model ANCOVA on the imputed data. We found a

 significant reduction in suicide ideation over time (F3,354 = 8.83, p < 0.001; 24-month coeffi-
cient: −0.12, 95% CI −0.20 to −0.05), but no group effect (F1,114 = 0.69, p = 0.41). No interaction
of group × time was found (F3,354 = 1.0, p = 0.40). Because of differences in diagnoses and num-
ber of previous suicide attempts (Table 1), these variables were included as covariates in the
ANCOVA, revealing a significant effect of prior suicide attempts (F1,114 = 17.0, p < 0.001; coef-
ficient: 0.05, 95% CI 0.02–0.07) and diagnoses (F1,114 = 12.8, p < 0.001) on BSS scores. Prior
suicide attempts correlated positively with BSS scores (Spearman’s rho = 0.27, p < 0.001), indi-
cating more suicide ideation in this patient group. These results were supported by using a lin-
ear mixed model. We found a significant effect over time (at 18 months: coefficient = −0.07,
95% CI −0.13 to −0.02, t357 = −2.55, p = 0.011; at 24 months: coefficient = −0.14, 95% CI −0.20
to −0.09, t357 = −5.03, p < 0.001), but no group effect (coefficient = −0.02, t114 = −0.52,
p = 0.60). Three diagnoses (affective disorder: coefficient = −0.19, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.07, t114 =
−3.01, p = 0.003; substance abuse disorder: coefficient = −0.23, 95% CI −0.41 to −0.05, t114 =

t114 = −5.18, p < 0.001) and prior suicide attempts (coefficient = 0.05, 95% CI 0.02–0.07, t114 =
4.12, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with BSS scores.
Health-care utilization.
In the first 12 months, 16 participants (27%) in the ASSIP group
and 20 participants (33%) in the control group were admitted to psychiatric inpatient treat-
ment. ASSIP participants had 72% fewer days of inpatient care (median = 29, IQR = 7–68)
than control participants (median = 105, IQR = 39–158, W = 94.5, p = 0.038). At 24 months,
18 (30%) ASSIP participants and 23 (38%) control participants had been admitted to hospital.
ASSIP was associated with 63% fewer days of hospitalization (median = 33, IQR = 11–65) than

 control treatment (median = 90, IQR = 23–180), but the difference at 24 months did not reach
significance (W = 139.5, p = 0.08). The groups did not differ with respect to the total number of
outpatient sessions at 12 months (W = 1,392.5, p = 0.41) and 24 months (W = 1,487.5,
p = 0.57).
Depression. Although ASSIP was not expected to have an effect on depression, we ana-
lyzed the BDI scores during follow-up using a mixed-model ANCOVA on the imputed data.
Similar to the results for the BSS, we found a significant reduction over time (F3,354 = 18.9,
p < 0.001), but no group effect (F1,114 = 1.99, p = 0.16). The covariates previous suicide
attempts (F1,114 = 8.5, p = 0.004) and diagnoses (F1,114 = 20.5, p < 0.001) had a significant effect
on BDI scores; a diagnosis of personality disorder was associated with higher BDI scores. These
results were supported by using a linear mixed model. We found a significant effect over time
(at 12 months: coefficient = −2.25, 95% CI −3.79 to −0.72, t357 = −2.89, p = 0.004; at 18 months:
coefficient = −2.35, 95% CI −3.89 to −0.82, t357 = −3.02, p = 0.003; at 24 months: coefficient =
−5.79, 95% CI −7.33 to −4.26, t357 = −7.44, p < 0.001), but no group effect (coefficient = 0.10,
t114 = 0.08, p = 0.94). Three main diagnoses (affective disorder: coefficient = −9.76, 95% CI
−13.2 to −6.34, t114 = −5.65, p < 0.001; substance abuse disorder: coefficient = −10.5, 95% CI
−15.4 to −5.46, t114 = −4.15, p < 0.001; neurotic and acute stress reaction: coefficient = −13.5,
95% CI −17.4 to −9.52, t114 = −5.18, p < 0.001) and prior suicide attempts (coefficient = 0.90,
95% CI 0.29–1.51, t114 = 2.92, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with BDI scores.
Therapeutic Alliance as Moderating Factor
In the ASSIP group, a linear model demonstrated that therapeutic alliance (HAq score) at the
first ASSIP session was inversely related to BSS score at 12 months follow-up (t57 = −3.02,
p = 0.004; coefficient: −0.26, 95% CI −0.43 to −0.09, R2 = 0.18) and 24 months (t57 = −3.11,
p = 0.003; coefficient: −0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.08, R2 = 0.30); the relationship between HAq
scores at the third ASSIP session and BSS scores was not significant. Furthermore, the ASSIP
group showed a significant increase in therapeutic alliance from the first to the third session
(HAq at first session, median = 4.91, IQR = 4.3–5.2; HAq at third session, median = 5.32,
IQR = 4.9–5.6, W = 257.5, p < 0.001, paired test).
Discussion
This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of ASSIP, a novel brief therapy for indi-
viduals who have attempted suicide administered in addition to TAU. The ASSIP group had a
18.4% lower rate of participants making at least one repeat suicide attempt compared to the
control group at 24 months, indicating a 83% reduction of the risk of further suicide attempts
in the survival analysis. It has been estimated that interventions that reduce suicide attempts by
25% may lead to a 2.6% reduction in the suicide rate, resulting in approximately 1,000 lives
saved annually in the US [53]. Emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations due
to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts have been estimated to result in over 1 million hospi-
tal visits per year, leading to costs of US$4.7 billion [1,54]. ASSIP fulfills the demands for a
low-cost intervention [55]. Considering the generally limited treatment resources for this
patient group, we believe that ASSIP may have a considerable potential for reducing suicidal
behavior, increasing treatment provision for patients attempting suicide, and reducing health-
care costs. Large pragmatic trials will be needed to conclusively establish the efficacy of ASSIP
and replicate our findings in other clinical settings.
A strength of the study is that the intervention was based on a published manual. The treat-
ment protocol is highly structured and, in our experience, easy to understand for therapists as
well as for patients. In Finland, ASSIP is currently being used in an increasing number of crisis

12 / 21
 centers [56]. Thus, we believe that ASSIP can be easily applied in other treatment settings. The
study has high external validity due to its real-world setting. Similar to clinical practice, patients
seen in the emergency department were informed that referral to ASSIP was part of the routine
procedure following attempted suicide. Patients at high risk of suicide were seen for a first
interview as soon as they were considered safe for escorted transport to the study premises at
the outpatient department. The proportion of participants with a history of one or more prior
suicide attempts at baseline was relatively high (50%); other studies report a range of 13% to
24% [57]. This indicates that our sample had a relatively high proportion of individuals with
increased suicide risk.
Remarkably, the treatment group spent less time in the hospital during the follow-up
period. This may be for two reasons. First, patients in the ASSIP group were often discharged
from inpatient care earlier, presumably because the clinicians relied on ASSIP as an effective
add-on treatment. Second, the low number of days spent in the hospital by the treatment
group probably reflects the reduction of suicide attempts during follow-up.
The treatment effect on suicidal behavior was not reflected in the BSS, measuring primarily
suicidal ideation. This finding is consistent with the main objective of ASSIP, which is to imple-
ment safety strategies targeting suicidal behavior, and not to reduce suicidality. As part of the
therapy interventions, participants were informed that suicidal crises could again be triggered
at any time in the future. Furthermore, the results are in line with other studies [11] that found
no significant effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on suicide ideation.
ASSIP is informed by multiple theories and models. But what makes it effective? First, we
believe that it is important for patients to know that the goals of the therapy are limited.
Patients were informed that they had an increased risk of future suicidal crises and that the
therapy would not cure them from suicidality. The declared aim of the therapy was for patients
to understand what makes them suicidal, and to develop safety strategies in case of future sui-
cidal crises. The psychoeducative handout is consistent with this aim, promoting the concept
of the suicidal mode as an out-of-the-ordinary state of mind that can be triggered at any time
by specific adverse experiences [58], and stating that the safety strategies must be applied
before the suicidal mode is fully activated. Second, we believe that ASSIP’s patient-centered,
collaborative approach to suicidal behavior promotes therapeutic alliance and maximizes treat-
ment engagement, a central element of ASSIP. This is supported by the association of therapeu-
tic alliance measures with outcome and the increase in the scores of therapeutic alliance (HAq)
in the ASSIP group between session one and session three. The latter is consistent with results
from psychotherapy research, which suggest that ratings of alliance in the third therapy session
are a good predictor of adherence to treatment and outcome [59]. Key elements of ASSIP are
designed to promote “the active and purposeful collaboration between patient and therapist”
[60] and include narrative interviewing [25] and video playback [42], both novel concepts in
the treatment of suicidal individuals. Third, ASSIP incorporates established therapeutic con-
cepts, such as safety planning [61] and follow-up contact with regular, personalized letters
[14,16]. To our knowledge, so far, no published treatment studies have combined psychological
interventions with subsequent ongoing contact through letters. We assume that the regular let-
ters not only provided a feeling of connectedness with the ASSIP therapist, but also may have
acted as reminders of patients’ increased suicide risk and may have increased awareness of
problems that could trigger future suicidal crises.
There are a number of limitations to be considered. First of all, it has to be taken into
account that small trials may result in large effect sizes. Therefore, larger studies will be needed
to determine the evidence for the efficacy of ASSIP in reducing suicidal behavior. A problem of
treatment studies with long-term follow-up is dropouts and missing data. The cumulative
dropout rates increased during follow-up, with higher rates in the control group. This is a well-

 known phenomenon [54], which was dealt with by ITT analysis, as recommended in the CON-
SORT guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trial results [55]. The problem of missing
data was addressed by using multiple imputations. Multiple imputations reduce bias attribut-
able to missing outcome data and resulted in our study in a more conservative treatment effect
compared to the original data.
The groups differed in a few clinical baseline variables, although these differences were not
statistically significant, except for the number of outpatient sessions prior to study inclusion.
An analysis using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model with these baseline variables
as covariates had no significant influence on the treatment effect: risk reduction for the ASSIP
group remained above 80%. The proportion of participants with a history with two or more
prior attempts was higher in the control group. However, using “two or more prior attempts”
as a covariate did not significantly reduce the treatment effect of ASSIP relative to control
treatment.
Information on repeated suicidal behavior was primarily based on participants’ self-reports
in the questionnaires. Others [6,33] have reported on the problem of under- and over-report-
ing in patients’ self-reports of suicidal behavior, and the discrepancy between self-reports and
hospital-based data. We dealt with this problem by complementing self-reported data with
searching medical records and contacting health professionals involved in TAU.
Data on co-active treatment consisted of self-reports every 6 months on the setting and the
duration of TAU. We did not collect information on the nature of the co-active follow-up treat-
ment. Generally, the provision of psychiatric in- and outpatient treatment in the region of Bern
can be considered to fulfill high standards of clinical care. The health-care system is a mixture
of state and private funding, with mandatory health insurance. Psychiatric outpatient treat-
ment is easily available, with a heavy emphasis on psychotherapy, and with no restrictions on
duration. This suggests that the treatment effect cannot be attributed to insufficient co-active
treatment.
“Contamination” of ASSIP and control group could not be avoided. Others [62] have com-
mented on the difficulty therapists experience in keeping control and experimental groups
“pure.” In our study, initial assessment interviews with the control group were conducted by
the therapists who also delivered ASSIP. In practice, the interviews with the control group
often included narrative elements. Furthermore, ongoing personal contact with the control
group was maintained through the study questionnaires sent to participants with a personally
signed letter. In addition, some control participants contacted the therapist for help during the
follow-up period. This kind of contamination most likely had the effect of reducing group dif-
ferences in the primary and secondary outcome measures.
Comparison with Other Studies and Implications
With three therapy sessions, ASSIP is considerably shorter than any other specific treatments
for individuals who have attempted suicide [11,13,33,63,64]. An exception is the treatment in
the Fleischmann et al. study [12], in which individuals who had attempted suicide were offered
a single psychoeducative session, supplemented by regular outreach contact after discharge.
Other effective therapy protocols [11,13] have included elements of active outreach contact
(phone calls, home visits). It has been pointed out that outreach elements providing a “lifeline,”
ideally based on a therapeutic relationship, may be important for the reduction of suicide risk
[65]. In line with this, ASSIP combines face-to-face sessions with regular personalized letters
during follow-up. The results support the notion that psychological interventions combined
with regular outreach elements may be particularly effective in reducing the risk of further sui-
cidal behavior. Furthermore, the present study suggests that a therapeutic relationship can be

 established in a brief psychological intervention. The finding that the HAq scores of the first
ASSIP session were associated with less suicidal ideation during follow-up suggests that a nar-
rative interview technique may be an important element for establishing an early therapeutic
alliance. Other interventions in ASSIP such as cognitive case conceptualization based on a vul-
nerability–trigger model, psychoeducation, and collaboratively developed crisis response plans
are elements used in cognitive-behavioral therapy treatment protocols. A relapse prevention
task [38,66] was added to the ASSIP manual as an optional session after completion of the
study, and was thus not administered in the present study.
A shortcoming of current therapies is that, to our knowledge, none of the randomized con-
trolled treatment studies so far have been replicated. The probability that a treatment will be
implemented and evaluated in other clinical settings will be higher when the therapy protocol
is simple and highly structured. We believe that ASSIP fulfills these requirements.
Conclusions
ASSIP, a manual-based brief therapy for patients who have attempted suicide, administered in
a real-world clinical setting, was efficacious in reducing suicidal behavior over 24 months.
ASSIP thus fulfills the need for a brief, easy-to-implement, and low-cost intervention. We
believe that ASSIP has the potential for dissemination in various treatment settings and for
reducing of the costs of health care for patients attempting suicide. Large pragmatic trials will
be needed to conclusively establish the efficacy of ASSIP and to replicate our findings in other
clinical settings.

 Editors' Summary
Background
Suicide is a serious public health problem. Over 800,000 people worldwide die by suicide
every year. In the US, one suicide death occurs approximately every 12 minutes. While the
causes of suicide are complex, the goals of suicide prevention are simple—reduce factors
that increase risk, and increase factors that promote resilience or coping. Factors that
increase suicide risk include family history of suicide, family history of child abuse, previ-
ous suicide attempts, history of mental disorders (particularly depression), history of alco-
hol and substance abuse, and access to lethal means. Factors that are protective against
suicide include effective clinical care for mental, physical, and substance abuse disorders;
connectedness to family and community; and problem solving and conflict resolution
skills. A previous suicide attempt is the main risk factor for repeat attempts and for com-
pleted suicide. Fifteen to 25 percent of people who attempt suicide make another attempt,
and five to ten percent eventually die by suicide.
Why Was This Study Done?
A number of suicide prevention treatments have been developed. Most of them involve
therapy sessions and personal follow-up. While some of them have been shown to work in
clinical trials—often with participants who have made a previous suicide attempt—few
interventions have proven to be effective consistently in different settings. For this study,
the researchers developed a treatment called Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Pro-
gram (ASSIP) composed of three therapy sessions shortly after the suicide attempt and fol-
low-up over two years with personalized mailed letters. They wanted the therapy part to
be short, in order to provide a treatment that would allow a psychiatric service to cope
with the large number of patients seen in the emergency department after a suicide
attempt. The therapeutic elements of the treatment emphasized building an early thera-
peutic alliance, which would then serve as a basis (“anchoring”) for long-term outreach
contact through regular letters. The therapy sessions and letters follow a detailed script,
which the researchers developed into a manual that includes a step-by-step description of
the highly structured treatment, checklists, handouts, and standardized letters for use by
health professionals in various clinical settings. This study was done to test whether ASSIP
can reduce suicidal behavior in addition to routine treatment.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
The researchers carried out a randomized clinical trial testing ASSIP in people who had
attempted suicide (the majority by intentional overdosing) and been admitted to the emer-
gency department of the Bern University General Hospital in Switzerland. Participants
were randomly assigned to two groups. The treatment group received ASSIP in addition
to treatment as usual (inpatient, day patient, and outpatient care as deemed appropriate by
the hospital clinicians); the control group received a single structured assessment interview
plus treatment as usual. The study objective was to evaluate—with follow-up question-
naires and health-care data—whether ASSIP can reduce the rate of repeated suicide
attempt in the 24 months after a suicide attempt. The researchers also compared suicidal
ideation (i.e., whether and how often participants had suicidal thoughts), levels of depres-
sion, and how often people were hospitalized between the two groups.

 A total of 120 patients who had recently attempted suicide were randomly allocated to
treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus ASSIP. The 60 ASSIP participants received
three therapy sessions followed by regular contact over 24 months. During the first ther-
apy session, the patient was prompted to tell the story of how he or she had reached the
point of attempting suicide. Narrative interviewing is a key element of ASSIP’s patient-
centered collaborative approach. The first session was videotaped, and parts were watched
and discussed by patient and therapist during the second session, to recreate the experi-
ence of psychological pain and analyze how stress developed into suicidal action. During
the final session, therapist and patient developed a list of long-term goals, warning signs,
and safety strategies. These were printed and given to the patient in a credit-card-sized
folded leaflet along with a list of telephone help numbers. Patients were told to carry both
items at all times and to use them in the event of an emotional crisis. Over the subsequent
two years, patients received six letters from their therapist reminding them of the risk of
future suicidal crises and the importance of the collaboratively developed safety strategies.
During the 24 months of follow-up, one death by suicide occurred in each group, five
repeat suicide attempts were recorded in the ASSIP group, and 41 repeat suicide attempts
were recorded in the control group. ASSIP was associated with an approximately 80%
reduced risk of repeat suicide attempt. In addition, ASSIP participants spent 72% fewer
days in the hospital during follow-up. There was no difference in patient-reported suicidal
ideation or in levels of depression.
What Do these Findings Mean?
The results show that ASSIP, administered in addition to the usual clinical treatment, was
able to reduce suicidal behavior over 24 months in patients who had recently attempted
suicide. The addition of ASSIP to usual treatment directly or its effect on repeat attempts
might also reduce health care costs. The absence of effects on suicidal thoughts and
depression is consistent with ASSIP’s objective to help people cope with crises as opposed
to eliminating them. The study’s findings in a real-world clinical setting (a university hos-
pital in the Swiss capital) are promising. They justify further testing in large clinical trials
and diverse settings to answer conclusively whether and where ASSIP can reduce repeat
suicide attempts, prevent deaths from suicide, and reduce health-care costs.
