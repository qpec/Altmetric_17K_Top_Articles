IMPORTANCE Population-based studies on the prevalence of symptoms after Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery are sparse. Knowledge about possible predictors of these
symptoms is important for prevention.
OBJECTIVES To examine patients’overall well-being and the prevalence and predictors of
medical, nutritional, and surgical symptoms after RYGB surgery, and their association with
quality of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey was conducted from March 3 to July 31, 2014,
among 2238 patients who underwent RYGB surgery between January 1, 2006, and
December 31, 2011, in the Central Denmark Region. A comparison cohort of 89 individuals
who were matched with patients according to sex and body mass index but who did not
undergo RYGB surgery were surveyed as a point of reference. Data analysis was conducted
from September 1, 2014, to June 25, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence and severity (based on contacts with health
care system, ranging from no contact to hospitalization) of self-reported symptoms following
RYGB surgery. Prevalence ratios (PRs) of symptoms associated with different predictors were
computed. The association between number of symptoms and quality of life was investigated
using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS Of 2238 patients undergoing RYGB surgery, 1429 (63.7%) responded to the survey.
Among these patients, 1266 (88.6%) reported 1 or more symptoms a median of 4.7 years
after RYGB surgery. Mean age at the time of the survey was 47.1 years (range, 26.9-68.0
years), and 286 were men (20.0%). A total of 1219 of 1394 patients (87.4%) reported that
their well-being was improved after vs before RYGB surgery, while 113 (8.1%) reported
reduced well-being. Symptoms after RYGB surgery were reported by 1266 patients (88.6%);
966 patients (67.6%) had been in contact with the health care system about their symptoms
vs 31 [34.8%] of those in the comparison group, and 416 (29.1%) had been hospitalized vs
6 [6.7%] of those in the comparison group. The symptoms most commonly leading to health
care contact after RYGB surgery were abdominal pain (489 [34.2%]), fatigue (488 [34.1%]),
and anemia (396 [27.7%]). The risk of symptoms was higher among women (crude PR, 1.23;
95% CI, 1.11-1.37), among patients younger than 35 years (PR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.36), among
smokers (PR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20), among unemployed persons (PR, 1.15; 95% CI,
1.06-1.24), and in those with surgical symptoms before RYGB surgery (PR, 1.34; 95% CI,
1.25-1.43). Quality of life was inversely associated with the number of symptoms (r = –0.30;
P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most patients reported improved well-being after RYGB
surgery, but the prevalence of symptoms was high and nearly one-third of patients were
hospitalized, 4- to 5-fold more than among the comparison group. Predictors of symptoms
included young age, female sex, smoking, and experiencing symptoms before RYGB surgery.
Development of weight loss procedures with fewer subsequent symptoms should be a
high priority.

F
or patients with morbid obesity, bariatric surgery,
including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery,
is an effective treatment for weight loss and diseases
associated with obesity.1,2 However, various medical, nutri-
tional, and surgical symptoms requiring treatment
may occur after RYGB surgery3-5 and may impair patients’
quality of life (QoL). These symptoms have generally been
classified as surgical or medical and nutritional depending
on the primary treatment procedures. Common surgical
symptoms after RYGB surgery include gallstones (7%-16%
after 18-26 months’ follow-up)6,7 and kidney stones
(≤8% after 19-42 months’follow-up).8 Well-known medical
and nutritional symptoms include dumping syndrome
(12%-42% after 1-2 years),9-11 hypoglycemia (0.2% of
patients were hospitalized within 0-20 years),12 diarrhea
(18% of patients with anal leakage of stool potentially pro-
voked by diarrhea after 2 years),13 peripheral neuropathy
(16% of patients, with unknown follow-up period),14 and
anemia (23%-47% after 24-48 months).15-17 Commonly
observed symptoms in clinical practice, such as abdominal
pain and fatigue, are sparsely described in the literature
on RYGB surgery despite the importance of such symptoms
for patients’functional status and QoL.18,19 Thus, a large
population-based study with long-term follow-up of
patients who had undergone RYGB surgery, providing a
more comprehensive examination of symptom prevalence,
is warranted.
Knowledge of possible predictors is important to pre-
vent symptoms related to RYGB surgery after the procedure.
Most patients undergoing RYGB surgery are women; recent
studies have pointed toward a higher risk of hospitalization
after RYGB surgery for women than for men,20,21 whereas
others have found no influence of sex on the rate of hospi-
talization after the procedure.22 Furthermore, advanced age
has been associated with increased risk of hospitalization
after surgery.20,21,23 Increased mortality and morbidity after
other types of surgery has been observed for smokers,24
unmarried patients,25 and unemployed persons.26 Whether
such demographic and lifestyle factors also predict symp-
toms after bariatric surgery, to our knowledge, have not yet
been examined.
Previous studies have reported improved physical
QoL but not mental QoL after bariatric surgery.27,28 The
influence of medical and nutritional symptoms on QoL
after RYGB surgery has, to our knowledge, not been
examined previously. As surgical symptoms have been
associated with reduced QoL,29 we hypothesized that
patients with medical and nutritional symptoms following
RYGB surgery have a poorer QoL than do patients with no
symptoms.
We aimed to conduct a comprehensive study of the well-
being and the severity and burden of common symptoms
after RYGB surgery. Furthermore, we examined possible pre-
dictors of symptoms requiring health care contact after
RYGB surgery, including demographic, clinical, socioeco-
nomic, and lifestyle factors. Finally, we examined the asso-
ciation of medical, nutritional, and surgical symptoms with
QoL after RYGB surgery.
Methods
Setting
The Central Denmark Region has a population of approxi-
mately 1.27 million people. All residents are registered in the
Civil Registration System (CRS) and assigned a unique per-
sonalidentificationnumber(CRSnumber).30,31TheDanishNa-
tional Board of Health provides tax-supported health care, in-
cluding RYGB surgery. In Denmark, all patients must be seen
by the general practitioner to be referred to secondary care
(outpatient and inpatient clinics or hospitalization).32
Participants
We obtained CRS numbers for all 3121 patients undergoing
RYGB surgery (International Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision, codes KJDF10 [gastric bypass] and KJDF11 [laparo-
scopic gastric bypass]) within Central Denmark between
January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2011 (>99% of the opera-
tions were laparoscopic RYGB surgery). The CRS provided
data on the vital status of all patients. Patients who were
deceased (n = 32), had emigrated (n = 14), had unknown
vital status (n = 1), had a CRS-registered restriction against
researcher inquiries (n = 791), or were unknown at their reg-
istered address (n = 45) were excluded (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). The study questionnaire was mailed to 2238
eligible patients on March 3, 2014. Two reminders were sent
to those who did not respond. On June 8, 2015, a compari-
son cohort of 89 individuals who did not undergo RYGB sur-
gery and who were matched with patients according to sex
and body mass index were recruited via the Internet; this
cohort also responded to the questionnaire.
AccordingtoDanishlegislation,33questionnairestudiesdo
not require a separate permission from the Danish Scientific
Ethical Committee. Patients provided written consent to par-
ticipate in the surveys.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire included items on sex, age, height, weight,
preoperative surgical symptoms, cohabiting status, educa-
tional level, employment status, tobacco smoking, surgical
symptoms after RYGB surgery (abdominal pain [eg, leakage,
herniation], kidney stones, and gallstones), and medical and
nutritional symptoms after RYGB surgery (diarrhea, anemia,
fatigue, neurologic symptoms, dumping, and hypoglyce-
mia). Questions on hospitalizations owing to plastic surgery
after RYGB surgery were not included. For each symptom that
occurred after RYGB surgery, we asked patients if the symp-
tom had led to any contact with the health care system, cat-
egorizing patients as follows: 1, no contact; 2, any contact (in-
cluding contact with general practitioner, visit in outpatient
specialty clinic, and hospital admission); 3, contact with sec-
ondary care only (visit in outpatient specialty clinic and hos-
pital admission); and 4, hospital admission (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Contacts with the health care system owing to
routine follow-up visits after RYGB surgery were not in-
cluded in this questionnaire. Presence of symptoms prior to
RYGB surgery was also queried.

The Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scoring System (18
questions)34 and the Dumping Symptom Rating Scale (9
questions)9 were included in the questionnaire. The 2 scales
are Likert scales, both ranging from 1 to 7. For hypoglycemia
anddumping(generalandgastrointestinalsymptomsaftergas-
trectomy), the severity of the symptoms and health-seeking
behavior were estimated from a scoring system, in contrast
with the other symptoms. We defined mild hypoglycemia as
a score of 36 to 71 (symptomatic to the patient), moderate hy-
poglycemia as a score of 72 to 89 (likely to lead to contact with
primarycare),andseverehypoglycemiaasascoreof90ormore
(likelyrequiringcontactwithsecondarycare).Wedefinedmild
dumping as a score of 18 to 35 (symptomatic to the patient),
moderate dumping as a score of 36 to 44 (likely to lead to con-
tact with primary care), and severe dumping as a score of 45
or more (likely to lead to contact with secondary care).
We assessed QoL using the Mental Composite score (MCS)
(6 items) and the Physical Composite score (PCS) (6 items) of
the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), which has been
validated in the general Danish population.35 The scores for
all items are summed and transformed into a scale from 0 to
100 (0 indicates poorest possible health state; 100, best pos-
sible health state). A score below 50 indicates poor mental or
physical health. The SF-12 scores were calculated using Health
Outcome Scoring Software, version 4.5 (Optum Inc). We also
included a question addressing current well-being compared
with well-being before RYGB surgery.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2014, to June
25, 2015. We tabulated characteristics of the cohort that un-
derwent RYGB surgery and the comparison cohort and tabu-
lated the prevalence and severity of symptoms. For the
cohort that underwent RYGB surgery, we computed the preva-
lence and the unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs)
ofsymptoms,comparingpossiblepredictorsofsymptomslead-
ing to any health care contact, using Poisson regression analy-
sis. The variables predefined as possible predictors were sex
(male or female), age (<35 years, 35-44 years, or ≥45 years), sur-
gical symptoms before RYGB surgery (abdominal pain, kid-
ney stones, or gallstones), cohabiting status (living with some-
one or living alone), educational level (≤9 years, 10-12 years,
or >12 years), employment status (full time, part time, or un-
employed), and tobacco smoking (yes or no). All PRs were ad-
justed for demographic (age and sex), clinical (preoperative
BMI, percentage weight loss, and surgical symptoms before
RYGB surgery), socioeconomic (cohabiting status, employ-
ment status, and educational level), and lifestyle (smoking)

tom prevalence according to this factor.
Patients who underwent RYGB surgery were grouped ac-

Results
A total of 1429 patients undergoing RYGB surgery (63.7%)
responded to the survey; 286 (20.0%) were male. Median time
sinceRYGBsurgerywas4.7years.Meanageatthetimeofthesur-
vey was 47.1 years (range, 26.9-68.0 years); the current median
body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) was 29.7, corresponding to a median
totalweightlossof35.7%.AsseeninTable1,thecomparisonco-
hort was matched on current body mass index (29.4) and sex
(22.5% male), yet it was slightly younger (mean age, 37.7 years).
Prevalence of Symptoms After RYGB Surgery
A total of 1266 patients (88.6%) who underwent RYGB sur-
gery reported 1 or more symptoms (Table 2) vs 70 (78.7%) in
the comparison cohort. The symptoms most commonly re-
ported among patients who underwent RYGB surgery were fa-
tigue (776 [54.3%]), dumping (749 [52.4%]), and abdominal
pain (778 [54.4%]). Of those reporting fatigue, 512 (66.0%) also
reported dumping and 533 (68.7%) reported abdominal pain.
Of the patients reporting dumping, 494 (66.0%) also re-
ported abdominal pain. Symptoms leading to any health care
contact were reported by 966 patients (67.6%) in those under-
going RYGB surgery and 31 (34.8%) in the comparison cohort.
The most frequent symptoms after RYGB surgery that led to
any health care contact were fatigue (488 [34.1%]), abdomi-
nal pain (489 [34.2%]), and anemia (396 [27.7%]). We esti-
mated that 130 patients (9.1%) were likely to have health care
contact owing to dumping and 95 (6.6%) owing to hypoglyce-
mia. Dumping and hypoglycemia alone accounted for only 24
(1.7%) of the total health care contacts.

son cohort (Table 2). A total of 376 of 476 hospitalizations
(79.0%) after RYGB surgery were owing to surgical symptoms
and 100 (21.0%) to medical and nutritional symptoms.
Predictors of Symptoms Leading to Health Care Contact
After RYGB
We found a higher prevalence of symptoms leading to
health care contact among women (PR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-
1.37), patients with surgical symptoms before RYGB surgery
(PR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.25-1.43), unemployed patients (PR, 1.15;
95% CI, 1.06-1.24), smokers (PR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20),
and patients younger than 35 years (PR, 1.24; 95% CI,
1.13-1.36) (Table 3). Mutually adjusting for demographic,
clinical, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors yielded almost
unchanged PRs.
Stratification for medical and nutritional symptoms and
surgical symptoms after RYGB surgery provided results that
were consistent with the results of all symptoms combined,
with some exceptions. More women had medical and nutri-
tional symptoms (PR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.24-1.69). For surgical
symptoms, the sex difference was smaller (PR for women, 1.15;
95% CI, 0.98-1.34), but the association with surgical symp-
toms before RYGB surgery was strong (PR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.74-
2.14). Concerning analysis restricted to hospitalizations, re-
sults were similar except for higher PRs for patients who
underwent RYGB surgery and experienced a large amount of
postoperative weight loss (PR for weight loss ≥35%, 1.53; 95%
CI,1.29-1.82)andforthosewithsurgicalsymptomsbeforeRYGB
surgery (PR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.48-2.07) (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Well-being After RYGB Surgery
In total, 1219 of 1394 (87.4%) patients felt better or much bet-
ter and 113 (8.1%) reported reduced well-being after RYGB sur-
gery (Figure). Those who felt worse had substantially higher
prevalence of symptoms after RYGB surgery (102 of 113 pa-
tients [90.3%] vs 846 of 1281 [66.0%]; P < .001). There was no
difference between the groups in the prevalence of surgical
symptoms before RYGB surgery (27 of 113 patients [23.9%] vs
228 of 1281 [17.8%]; P = .11).

Quality of Life
Based on the SF-12, the median MCS was 41.8 (IQR, 34.8-
45.9) for patients who underwent RYGB surgery and 39.7 (IQR,
31.7-44.7) in the comparison cohort. The median PCS was 53.0
(IQR, 46.1-55.4) and 53.5 (IQR, 49.4-55.2), respectively. For pa-
tientswhounderwentRYGBsurgeryandexperiencednosymp-
toms, the median MCS was 44.1 and the median PCS was 54.2
compared with a median MCS of 33.6 and a median PCS of 45.0
for those with 4 or more symptoms. The Spearman rank cor-
relation coefficients between number of symptoms and MCS
and PCS were ρ = –0.30 and ρ = –0.23, respectively (Table 4).
Discussion
Our study showed that 87.4% of the patients reported that they
felt better after RYGB surgery. Nevertheless, 88.6% of pa-
tients reported 1 or more symptoms (mild to severe) a median
of4.7yearsafterRYGBsurgery.Inthecomparisoncohort,78.7%
of the participants reported symptoms, indicating that mild
symptoms are a part of “normal” physiological features in pa-
tients with obesity. Approximately two-thirds of patients who
underwent RYGB surgery had health care contact owing to
symptoms and 29.1% had been hospitalized, 79.0% owing to
surgical symptoms and 21.0% owing to medical symptoms, a
higherpercentagethanpreviouslyreported.21Thepatientswho
underwent RYGB surgery were hospitalized 4- to 5-fold more
than the comparison cohort.
Predictors of symptoms included younger age, female sex,
smoking, and unemployment. Finally, a higher number of
symptoms was associated with lower health-related QoL and
reduced well-being after RYGB surgery.
Most patients reported a better or much better well-being
aftersurgerydespiteahighprevalenceofsymptoms.Thosewho
reported worse well-being were characterized by a high preva-
lenceofsymptoms.ObesityisassociatedwithreducedQoL,pos-
sibly owing to stigmatization, reduced mobility, and obesity-
related diseases.27 Satisfaction with weight loss after RYGB
surgery may outweigh some dissatisfaction with symptoms af-
ter surgery. Previous studies have focused on symptoms lead-
ing to hospitalization.20,22,23 Morgan et al20 found that 18% of
patientswerehospitalizedafterbariatricsurgery(meanfollow-
up, 41 months) compared with 29.1% in our study. However,
they did not report on anemia, neurologic complications, gall-
stones,kidneystones,fatigue,anddiarrhea,whichmayexplain
this difference. Our study also revealed a high prevalence of
symptomsrequiringcontactwithageneralpractitioner,figures
that,toourknowledge,havenotbeenreportedpreviously.Our
results are consistent with the prevalences reported in studies
regarding severe dumping, anemia, kidney stones, gallstones,
andneurologicsymptoms.6-11,14-17,36-39Dumpingmay,however,
be an integrated part of the effect of RYGB surgery in inducing
weightloss.Becausehypoglycemiaconsistsofunspecificsymp-
toms, patients with this condition might be overlooked or mis-
diagnosed. Prevalence estimates to date have been based on
hospital admission data although many patients with hypogly-
cemia are not hospitalized.12
IncorroborationwiththefindingsbyTelemetal21andMor-
gan et al,20 we identified a higher prevalence of symptoms
among women. The discrepancy with Stroh et al,22 who found
no difference between sexes after adjustments, may be ex-
plained by anemia not being included in that study. In an ad-
ditional analysis excluding anemia, we found that both the un-
adjusted and adjusted results were unchanged.

In contrast to 3 previous studies,20,21,23 we found that
younger age was associated with a higher prevalence of symp-
toms. However, the results of those studies are not directly
comparable.Thosestudiesincludeddifferentsymptoms,20,21,23
examined 30-day complication rates,23 or only examined
hospitalizations.20,21 After restricting our study to care re-
ceived in the hospital, the association with younger age per-
sisted (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We hypothesize that age
may be an important factor in the conception of symptoms (ie,
younger patients may accept fewer symptoms than older pa-
tients before contacting a physician).
We found that both cohorts had a reduced health-related
QoL vs that of the comparison cohort, which is consistent with
the results reported by Raoof et al.40 We only measured the
QoL after surgery and therefore were not able to identify
changes in QoL. In those undergoing RYGB surgery, 955 of 1314
patients (72.7%) had an MCS below the cutoff for depression
risk;inthecomparisoncohort,66of85individuals(77.6%)had
an MCS below the cutoff for depression risk.41 The negative ef-
fect of symptoms that occur after RYGB surgery on the pa-
tients’reported QoL suggests that screening for depression
might be beneficial among patients undergoing RYGB sur-
gery, especially among patients with several symptoms.
Since some of the symptoms (eg, diarrhea and fatigue)
are common in the general population, we focused on symp-
toms leading to health care contact as indicators of symptom
severity. All Danish patients undergoing RYGB surgery are
offered 2 years of postoperative follow-up outpatient visits
and then annual follow-up visits in primary care; there is a
risk that patients will be unable to remember whether the
visit was related to symptoms or simply a part of the postop-
erative follow-up program, which could lead to inaccurate
reports on symptom-related visits. This risk does not apply
for symptoms leading to hospitalization; these data were
verified by data from the Danish National Patient Registry42
on admissions owing to kidney stones and gallstones. We
found satisfactory consistency between self-reported and
registry-based data as described by a sensitivity and specific-
ity greater than 0.80 (eTable 2 in the Supplement).43 We
assumed that these diagnoses were accurately remembered
by the patients and were coded correctly.
The main strengths of our study are its large size, popu-
lation-based sample, relatively long time frame, and exami-
nation of a broad range of symptoms and demographic fac-
tors. The size of our comparison cohort was rather small;
however, the matching of the comparison cohort for sex and
body mass index was good and we believe our comparisons
reflect the prevalence of symptoms in overweight individu-
als . Another concern is that the questionnaire relied on self-
reported symptoms elicited a long time after surgery. We did
not ask about time relation between surgery and symptoms
since we considered that to be a risk of misclassification and
that recall bias would be large. The time elapsed since sur-
gery also poses a risk of misclassification in answers concern-
ing preoperative symptoms and weight. Furthermore, we had
to construct cutoff points for hypoglycemia and dumping syn-
drome based on clinical knowledge, and not all scales have
been validated exactly in the way we used them.9,34 The cut-
off points we defined for dumping produced prevalence esti-
mates consistent with those in the existing literature. Al-
though our questions were comprehensive, focusing on the
most common symptoms after RYGB surgery, we may have
missed some symptoms. These often rare symptoms are, how-
ever, not expected to change the outcome.
Only 63.7% of patients completed the questionnaire. Non-
respondents tended to be younger, but the age distribution dif-
fered only by a few percentage points, not comprising a risk of
bias (eTable 3 in the Supplement). More nonrespondents than
respondents underwent RYGB surgery during 2010-2011, but
there were no significant differences in PRs at time since sur-
gery (eTable 4 in the Supplement). More of the nonrespon-
dents were male; since male sex was associated with a lower
risk of symptoms, we would expect an even larger sex differ-
ence than what we observed. It is possible that the respon-
dents had symptoms that they were interested in addressing.
Atthesametime,respondentssatisfiedwiththeresultsoftheir
operation may have wished to report their satisfaction.
Conclusions
The vast majority of patients reported better or much better
well-being after RYGB surgery. However, the amount of
symptoms and health care contacts after RYGB surgery is
rather high and represents a significant burden from an indi-
vidual perspective as well as for society. Nearly one-third of
patients had been admitted to a hospital owing to these
symptoms, mainly surgical symptoms. Focus on the QoL
among patients with many symptoms may be required since
such patients are at risk of depression. Development of new
weight loss treatments with less risk of subsequent symp-
toms should be a high priority.
