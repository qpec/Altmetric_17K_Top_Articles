Abstract
Understanding the minimal dose of physical activity required to achieve improvement in
physical functioning and reductions in disability risk is necessary to inform public health
recommendations. To examine the effect of physical activity dose on changes in physical
functioning and the onset of major mobility disability in The Lifestyle Interventions and Inde-
pendence for Elders (LIFE) Study. We conducted a multicenter single masked randomized
controlled trial that enrolled participants in 2010 and 2011 and followed them for an average
of 2.6 years. 1,635 sedentary men and women aged 70–89 years who had functional limita-
tions were randomized to a structured moderate intensity walking, resistance, and flexibility
physical activity program or a health education program. Physical activity dose was asse-
ssed by 7-day accelerometry and self-report at baseline and 24 months. Outcomes included
the 400 m walk gait speed, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), assessed at
baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, and onset of major mobility disability (objectively defined by
loss of ability to walk 400 m in 15 min). When the physical activity arm or the entire sample
were stratified by change in physical activity from baseline to 24 months, there was a dose-
dependent increase in the change in gait speed and SPPB from baseline at 6, 12, and 24
months. In addition, the magnitude of change in physical activity over 24 months was related

the lowest quartile of physical activity change HR 0.23 ((95% CI:0.10–0.52) P = 0.001) in the
physical activity arm. We observed a dose-dependent effect of objectively monitored physi-

increases (> 48 minutes per week) in regular physical activity participation had significant

Introduction
Physical inactivity is among the strongest predictors of physical disability in elders[1,2]. Fur-
thermore, exercise prevents or improves conditions that underlie disability in older adults,
including falls[3–6], hip fracture[7,8], cardiovascular disease[9,10], and diabetes[10–12]. Lon-
gitudinal studies suggest regular physical activity is associated with reduced mortality and risk
of physical disability[13,14]. Several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of physical
activity programs on functional outcomes in older adults[15–19].
An important but understudied issue in physical activity trials in older adults is interven-
tion adherence and the minimum dose necessary to achieve benefit. Previous physical activity
intervention trials have reported that adherence among older adults is generally high (70–
85%)[18,20,21]. However, many of these studies were of relatively short duration (6–18
months), and measured physical activity adherence by self-report or other indices of participa-
tion such as session attendance. To address gaps in knowledge regarding physical activity for
disability prevention, the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Study (the LIFE
Study), a Phase 3 multicenter RCT compared a supervised moderate-intensity walking and
resistance training physical activity program to a health education program on the incidence
of major mobility disability was conducted[22]. The LIFE study demonstrated that a struc-
tured moderate intensity physical activity program reduced major mobility disability by 18%
and persistent mobility disability by 28%, compared with a health education program[23].
In the present study, we examined whether differences in the dose of physical activity per-
formed were associated with improvements in physical functioning and reductions in disabil-
ity incidence. This analysis was an exploratory aim of the LIFE study. We also examined the
stability/consistency of these results by examining the dose of physical activity using both
objectively measured daily physical activity using accelerometry and self-reported minutes of
walking plus weight training exercise.
Materials and methods
From February 2010 to December 2011, 14,831 participants were screened for the LIFE study
at eight field centers; 1,635 of these participants were eligible and randomized (818 to physical
activity and 817 to health education) (Fig 1).
Eligibility
Comprehensive details of the LIFE study have been published previously[22,24]. Briefly, the
LIFE study eligibility criteria were designed to target older persons (age 70–89 years) who
were: a) inactive (reporting <20 min/week in the past month performing regular physical
activity and <125 min/week of moderate physical activity); b) at high risk for mobility

 Study interventions
Physical activity intervention.
The physical activity intervention included walking-based
aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance training in a supervised class setting (2 x per week)
with additional home-based physical activity goals[28]. The goal was to progressively move
participants towards at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity, con-
sistent with the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans report[29].
Walking was the primary mode of physical activity, given its widespread popularity and
ease of administration across a broad segment of the older adult population[30,31]. Partici-
pants also completed a 10-minute lower extremity resistance training program with ankle
weights after walking exercise, a set of balance exercises, and a brief lower extremity stretching
routine. Individualized home-based walking goals supplemented the supervised program.
Health education intervention.
The health education intervention provided age-specific
health information about “successful aging”. Health education consisted of workshops on top-
ics relevant to older adults (e.g., negotiating the health care system, travel safety, nutrition,
etc.). Each session included a brief program of seated upper extremity stretching/flexibility
exercises. Health education classes met weekly for the first 26 and from week 27 on the pro-
gram was offered two times per month and participants were prompted to attend at least once
per month.
Study assessments
Participants were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 month clinic visits by staff masked to
intervention arm allocation. Home, telephone, and proxy assessments were attempted if the
participant could not come to the clinic. Since objective measures of physical activity were
assessed through month 24 on all participants (i.e. minimum follow-up was 24 months), we
have confined our analysis to this time frame.
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The SPPB consists of a standing balance
test, a usual pace 4 meter walk, and five timed repeated chair stands[32]. Each performance
measure is assigned a categorical score ranging from 0 (inability to complete the test) to 4 (best
performance possible) and a summary score ranging from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best
performance) was calculated.
400 m walk test and assessment of major mobility disability.
Participants were asked to
walk 400 m at their usual pace, without overexertion, for 10 laps on a course defined by 2
cones placed 20 m apart. They could stop and rest for up to 1 minute for fatigue or related
symptoms. Gait speed was calculated from the time to complete the walk and the distance
covered.
Major mobility disability was defined as the inability to complete the 400 m walk test within
15 min without sitting and without the help of another person or walker[22]. Use of a cane
was acceptable. When major mobility disability could not be objectively measured because the
participant was not able to come to the clinic and lacked a suitable walking course at their
home, institution or hospital, an alternative adjudication of the outcome was based on directly
observed inability to walk 4 m in <10 sec, or self-, proxy-, or medical record-reported inability
to walk across a room. If participants met these alternative criteria, it was considered that they
would also not be able to complete the 400 m walk within 15 minutes.
Accelerometry.
Participants were instructed to wear an accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X)
on their hip for seven consecutive days except during sleep, showering/bathing, and swim-
ming. Movement was captured along the vertical axis in 1-minute epochs, and non-wear time
was defined as 90 minutes of consecutive zero counts[33]. An outlier minute was defined as
having an activity count value that exceeded all of the participant’s non-outlier minutes and

 additionally the activity count value had to exceed the nearest value for the day by 1000 and
exceed the median of the 2nd highest daily value by 3500. Data were considered valid if appar-
ent wearing evidence was � 600 minutes per day for at least five days. Data reduction focused
on technical and procedural errors as well as evident outliers. Ultimately, data from a total of
1,131 participants (566 from the physical activity intervention, 565 from the health education
intervention) were used in this analysis. To be included in the analysis, they must have had a
baseline measure and at least one of the follow-up measure.
Total physical activity was calculated as the average number of daily activity counts per
minute. This measure correlates with energy expenditure assessed using oxygen consumption
in older adults[34]. In the absence of well-accepted evidence-based accelerometry cut-points
for physical activity intensity in older adults, a cut-point was set that demarcated time during
activity (> 760 activity counts/minute)[35,36]. Data were expressed in min/week, and adjusted
for wear time.
Self-reported physical activity.
Participants completed a shortened version of the Com-
munity Health Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS-5) physical activity question-
naire[37]. The CHAMPS-5 assessed the average weekly minutes spent in walking and weight
training from 5 specific items in this instrument related to these specific activities. These items
queried frequency and duration of engagement in moderate to heavy strength training, light
strength training, walking uphill or hiking up hill, walking fast or briskly for exercise, and
walking leisurely for exercise or pleasure.
Hospitalizations.
Because physical activity participation may be influenced by inter-cur-
rent illness, we used reported hospitalizations as a measure of inter-current illness. At each
contact, participants (or proxies if the participant was not available) were questioned about
hospitalizations since the last visit. All records for hospitalizations were obtained and adjudi-
cated independently by two experts who were blinded to randomization arm.
Statistical analysis plan
The mean and standard deviation (SD) of change in physical activity from baseline by ran-
domized arm at each visit were computed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare
the change in physical activity between randomization groups. Baseline characteristics, strati-
fied by quartiles of change from baseline in accelerometer-determined physical activity at 24
months (interquartile ranges derived from physical activity arm) and by intervention arm,
included means (± SD) for continuous variables or counts (%) for discrete variables. Analysis
of variance was used to compare continuous characteristics across quartiles of change and a
chi-square test was used to compare discrete characteristics across quartiles of change.
Physical activity measures, including minutes spent in activity associated with >760 activity
counts/minute (by accelerometry) and CHAMPS-reported min/week in walking/weight train-
ing were the primary predictors of interest. They were categorized based on quartiles of
changes at 24 months in the physical activity arm in the models. Baseline measures and
changes to follow-up from baseline at 6, 12, and 24 months (treated as continuous measures or
quartiles) were included in the analysis as an index of the dose of physical activity achieved.
The outcomes included the SPPB, 400 m walk speed, and onset of major mobility disability.
Analyses were initially restricted to the physical activity arm alone; however, we also examined
these relationships using the same quartiles for both groups combined to examine changes in
physical activity that occurred irrespective of intervention assignment. SPPB and 400 m walk
speed were analyzed using mixed effects models with an unstructured parameterization for
longitudinal covariance. For the analyses of the physical activity arm, models contained the fol-
lowing terms: field center and sex (both used to stratify randomization), baseline outcome

 measure, clinic visit, hospitalization, baseline physical activity measure, quartile of change in
the physical activity measure, and quartile of change in the physical activity measure and clinic
visit. For the entire sample analysis (both physical activity and health education), we addition-
ally adjusted for randomization arm. Least squares means and their standard errors were pre-
sented from these models.
The effect of change in physical activity on time until major mobility disability was tested
using a time-dependent Cox regression model, stratified by field center and sex. Failure time
was measured from the time of randomization. Follow-up was censored at the first occurrence
of loss-to-follow-up, death or the month 24 assessment. For participants who did not have any
outcome assessments, a half hour of follow-up time was assigned, since we knew that they
completed the 400 m walk at baseline. The models contained the following terms: baseline and
change in physical activity measure, hospitalization, and randomization arm when the entire
sample was used.
Results and discussion
The change in accelerometer-determined activity and the change in self-reported walking plus
weight training were significantly greater in the physical activity arm than health education at
all time points (P < 0.001) (Table 1.). Baseline characteristics by quartile of accelerometer-
determined physical activity are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Baseline differences in number of
chronic conditions were observed in the PA arm and in gait speed in both arms across
quartiles.
The mixed model analyses revealed statistically significant and clinically meaningful differ-
ences of the effect of quartile of change in accelerometry-based measures of change in activity
from baseline to 24 month on the change in 400 m gait speed (Fig 2) for the physical activity
arm over time (P < 0.001). The difference in gait speed change from lowest to the highest
quartiles was between 0.05 and 0.10 m/s. This finding also held for the entire sample (Fig 2)
(P < 0.001). These relationships remained when hospitalization was removed from the models
(data not shown).
The mixed model analyses also revealed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful
difference of the effect of quartile of change in accelerometry-based measures of activity from
baseline to 24 month in SPPB score for the physical activity arm over time (Fig 3A)
(P < 0.001). The difference in SPPB change from lowest to the highest quartiles was between

 0.5 and 1.5. Again, this held true when the entire sample was combined (Fig 3B) (P < 0.001).
These relationships remained when hospitalization was not included in the models (data not
shown).
The changes in physical activity by self-reported minutes of walking plus weight training
from baseline to 24 months were also associated with significant changes in 400 m gait speed
(P < 0.001) and SPPB scores (P < 0.001) (Table 4) in the physical activity arm and when the
entire sample was combined (Table 5). Again, the results were stable when models were run
excluding hospitalizations (data not shown).
We examined the relationship between quartiles of change in accelerometry-based activity
and change in both self-reported walking plus weight training with the onset of major mobility
disability for the physical activity arm and entire sample from baseline to 24 months. The rela-
tionships were statistically significant in the physical activity arm (P � 0.003) and in the entire
sample overall (P � 0.001). For the physical activity arm alone, the onset of major mobility dis-
ability was reduced by 24% (P = 0.412), 22% (P = 0.489), and 77% (P = 0.001) in quartiles 2, 3,
and 4 of change in accelerometry-based activity respectively and increased by 7% (P = 0.802),
and reduced 57% (P = 0.007), and 75% (P < 0.001) in quartiles 2,3, and 4 of change in self-
reported walking plus weight training respectively (Table 6). The hazard ratios were very simi-
lar for the entire sample (Table 7) and when hospitalization was removed as a covariate (data
not shown).
The major results from this study were that changes in physical activity measured objec-
tively by accelerometry as well as by self-report were associated with improvements in physical
functioning over 24 months as well as a reduction in the onset of major mobility disability in a
dose-dependent manner. These associations were stable when examined in the physical activ-
ity arm alone or when the physical activity and health education arms were combined. We
observed similar results of physical activity participation on physical functioning and major
mobility disability whether using accelerometry or self-report measures.

 The magnitude of the increase in physical function in the physical activity arm was related
to accelerometry-determined changes in physical activity and was progressively greater across
all four quartiles of change. Observational studies have reported significant relationships
between self-reported physical activity measures [38–41] and objective measures of physical
functioning in older adults[42–44]. McDermott et al. reported that the decline in physical per-
formance in patients with peripheral artery disease is slower in individuals who report walking
3 or more times per week, compared to those who walk for exercise less frequently or not at all
[45]. In contrast to these observational studies, results reported here are from a randomized
controlled trial and show greater improvements in physical functioning in individuals who
participate in more physical activity. The difference in gait speed change from lowest to the
highest quartiles was between 0.05 to 0.10 m/s, a magnitude which has been associated with
reductions in mortality risk [46] and patient-reported outcomes[47]. The difference in SPPB
score change from lowest to highest quartiles was between 0.5 and 1.0 and is within the range
of a clinically meaningful difference[48].
Greater differences in both the change in self-reported physical activity and objectively
measured activity were related to prevention of major mobility disability. The present analysis
demonstrated a robust decline in major mobility disability in the highest quartile of change in
accelerometer-determined physical activity. The change in physical activity observed in the
highest quartile translated to approximately 43 minutes per week. This level of physical activity
is approximately the dose of a single LIFE study physical activity session[28]. These data sug-
gest that an increase in the dose of physical activity equivalent to a single LIFE physical activity
session per week was sufficient to dramatically reduce disability risk and result in meaningful
improvements in physical functioning.
The dose effect of physical activity on physical function and major mobility disability was
also observed when we combined data from both study arms. This finding highlights that par-
ticipants randomized to physical activity and whose adherence to the intervention was rela-
tively low achieved smaller benefits, however, any participant randomized to health education

 The strengths of this investigation are the objective measurement of physical activity, the
substantially greater length of the follow-up than in prior studies, and the study population,
which consisted of individuals at high risk for mobility disability. Furthermore, the results of
our analysis when both intervention arms were combined indicate that if participants increased
or decreased their levels of activity over the course of the trial, irrespective of group assignment,
their change in physical functioning or mobility disability was related to this change in activity.
In addition to these strengths, there are several study limitations. Among them are the fact that
the LIFE Study was not designed to specifically address varying doses of physical activity on
physical functioning and disability risk. Differences in health status and inter-current illness
may influence physical activity behavior and therefore may be potential confounders in these
analyses. In addition, since both independent and dependent variables were assessed over the
same time intervals it is not possible to establish temporal precedence. However, our models
were stable even when inter-current hospitalizations were included in the analyses.
Conclusion
In conclusion, greater changes in physical activity behavior measured objectively by accelero-
metry and self-report were associated with clinically meaningful improvements in physical
functioning and reductions in the development of major mobility disability. The dose of
change in physical activity associated with the greatest benefit was greater than 48 minutes per
week of physical activity. These data have important public health implications for the benefits
of physical activity in mobility-limited older adults. These data support that beneficial effects
of physical activity can be realized with substantially less physical activity than is currently rec-
ommended for most inactive older adults.
