Abstract: There are concerns about the accuracy of the health information provided by alcohol
industry (AI)-funded organisations and about their independence. We conducted a content analysis
of the health information disseminated by AI-funded organisations through Twitter, compared with
non-AI-funded charities, to assess whether their messages align with industry and/or public health
objectives. We compared all tweets from 2016 from Drinkaware (UK); Drinkaware.ie (Ireland); and
DrinkWise (Australia), to non-AI-funded charities Alcohol Concern (UK), Alcohol Action Ireland,
and FARE (Australia). Industry-funded bodies were significantly less likely to tweet about alcohol
marketing, advertising and sponsorship; alcohol pricing; and physical health harms, including
cancers, heart disease and pregnancy. They were significantly more likely to tweet about behavioural
aspects of drinking and less likely to mention cancer risk; particularly breast cancer. These findings
are consistent with previous evidence that the purpose of such bodies is the protection of the alcohol
market, and of the alcohol industry’s reputation. Their messaging strongly aligns with AI corporate
social responsibility goals. The focus away from health harms, particularly cancer, is also consistent
with previous evidence. The evidence does not support claims by these alcohol-industry-funded
bodies about their independence from industry.
Keywords: alcohol industry; public health; cancer; social media; thematic analysis
1. Introduction
As part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, alcohol companies fund a range
of social aspects/public relations organisations (SAPROs). The stated aims of such organisations
are to educate the public and promote “responsible drinking” [1,2], but a growing body of evidence
indicates they exist primarily to improve public relations, distract from evidence-based policies and
resultant legislation that might be harmful to profits, emphasize personal over corporate responsibility,
and mislead the public on health risks [3–8]. This is consistent with the global alcohol producers’
commitments, which have been a focus of alcohol industry (AI) corporate social responsibility
messaging, and are cited by industry as evidence of a commitment to meaningful social contribution,
yet avoid population-level measures listed in the WHO’s global alcohol strategy (see Table 1), which are
most likely to reduce overall alcohol consumption [9,10] and, therefore, negatively affect profits [11,12].

Even in instances of apparent overlap in priorities between the WHO and global producer
commitments, evidence is emerging in areas such as strengthening marketing regulation [15,16],
reducing drink driving [17], or providing information to the public [18,19] that the majority of industry
initiatives are not only inconsistent with available evidence of effectiveness [5], but often occur
alongside industry opposition to evidence-based policies [20,21]. In spite of this conflict, in many
countries SAPROs are the main source of information on alcohol and health for consumers [3].
In the UK, Ireland and Australia, the main AI-funded SAPROs serving as providers of health
information on alcohol are Drinkaware, Drinkaware.ie and DrinkWise, respectively.
Drinkaware (UK) first appeared in 2004 as an alcohol information website developed by the
Portman Group. The Portman Group is an alcohol-producer-funded organization, and at the time, the
UK government’s strategy for reducing alcohol-related harms had assigned them responsibility for the
provision of information on alcohol to the public [22]. The Drinkaware Trust was then established as a
separate charity in 2007, following a 2006 memorandum of understanding between the alcohol industry
and a number of government agencies [4], and remains funded primarily by alcohol producers and
sellers [23]. Its stated purpose is to “work in partnership with others to help reduce alcohol-related
harm by helping people make better choices about their drinking” [23]. Drinkaware and other
SAPROs were recently found to be misleading the public on alcohol and cancer risk, including
presenting misleading information about the independent effects of alcohol consumption on cancer
risk, using similar framings to those developed by the tobacco industry to obscure the evidence
on smoking and lung cancer, in some cases not mentioning cancer in general, and breast cancer
specifically [19]. Such organisations also place considerable emphasis on potential confounders in
the alcohol-cancer relationship, minimising the role of alcohol by pointing to a wide range of other
non-modifiable risk factors for cancer [19]. Emphasis is also placed on how knowledge of mechanisms
is incomplete, apparently as a way of disputing the relationship. For example, “Scientists have not
identified any single mechanism that explains exactly why alcohol increases the risk of developing
cancer” (Drinkaware) [19] and “Although alcohol is a well-established risk factor for breast cancer, the
mechanism by which alcohol consumption may cause breast cancer is not fully known. The relationship
between alcohol consumption and breast cancer is undergoing vigorous research” (SAB Miller) [19].
This can be compared with tobacco industry arguments about smoking and lung cancer—e.g., “Science
has still to ascertain precise biological mechanisms whereby prolonged exposure to constituents
of tobacco smoke causes these diseases” [24]. More recently, a controversial partnership between
Drinkaware and Public Health England (PHE) attracted widespread criticism from the public health
community [25].
Drinkaware.ie is a national not-for-profit organization in Ireland, which, similar to Drinkaware
(UK), is funded primarily by alcohol industry contributions, and has as a stated mission . . . “to work
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 892
3 of 12
with others to fundamentally and permanently change attitudes and behaviours so that drinking
to excess and drinking underage become unacceptable.” [26] Drinkaware.ie was established as the
consumer-facing brand of the Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society (MEAS), itself established in 2002
as an independent not-for-profit by representatives of the Irish alcohol industry, with responsibility for
developing a code of practice for alcohol marketing and for funding educational campaigns directed
at the public and at alcohol retailers [27].
DrinkWise (Australia) was established in 2005 by the alcohol industry as a not-for-profit
organization, with the stated aim . . . “to help bring about a healthier and safer drinking culture
in Australia.” [28]. Unlike Drinkaware (UK) and Drinkaware.ie, DrinkWise initially was also in receipt
of government funding for the first four years of its existence [3]. The independence, evidence-base for
activity and transparency of DrinkWise have been challenged by public health researchers who have
suggested that Drinkwise’s focus is on individually-oriented research and on social marketing and
education campaigns, which the evidence shows are of limited effectiveness [29]. Moreover, recent
research on Drinkwise points to confusion amongst the public about its industry funding [30], and
presents evidence that current campaigns may be reinforcing social norms relating to heavy drinking
among young people [31].
All three organisations are public sources of alcohol-related information, and the extent to
which their content matches WHO-recommended initiatives or alcohol industry producer initiatives,
particularly in terms of responding to seasonal or one-off issues at the national level, is not well
understood. Social media is an important communication platform for such charities to interact with
followers, advocate, lobby, build interest and launch campaigns [32–35]. It has also been identified
as a potentially rich data source for health research, with a recent systematic review identifying 137
research articles using Twitter, 108 of which involved the analysis of tweets, primarily in the form
of content analysis [33]. The strengths of analysing tweets in particular are ease of access and the
real-time nature of content generation and distribution.
We therefore sought to compare the Twitter output of these industry-funded organisations to
a leading national alcohol charity in each country (Alcohol Concern, Alcohol Action Ireland and
FARE), to assess the extent to which messages align with industry and/or public health objectives.
The inclusion of UK, Ireland, and Australia kept the task manageable, while allowing for a direct
comparison between major industry-funded, and non-industry funded sources.
2. Materials and Methods
We downloaded and coded all tweets from January-December 2016 from the AI-funded sources
Drinkaware (UK, n = 835 tweets); Drinkaware.ie (Ireland, n = 232); and DrinkWise (Australia, n = 89).
The sources of non-AI-funded tweets were Alcohol Concern (UK, n = 730), Alcohol Action Ireland
(n = 475), and FARE (Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, Australia, n = 444). After an
initial pilot coding exercise in which three coders blind-coded 50 tweets randomly-selected using the
random number generator in Excel, coding was conducted independently by two coders, consulting
with others where a code was unclear. Where older tweets were unavailable on Twitter we downloaded
them from an online Twitter archive. We were primarily interested in determining which health
topics AI-funded organisations tweeted about, compared to independent non-industry organisations,
because of previous findings that AI-funded bodies present misleading health information, particularly
information on cancer, to the public [8,19]. A coding frame was developed by iteratively coding all
tweets by topic based on text content, and other characteristics of the tweets, particularly the content
of the images in the tweets (whether the tweet contained images of women, young women, children,
young adults, people drinking or alcoholic beverages). The coding was recorded in Microsoft Excel
(Excel 2016, Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA). This form of content analysis is common in
health research, and has also been used frequently in the analysis of corporate communications, for
example as part of policy debates [36–38]. The analysis and reporting adheres to guidance on the
collection, analysis and presentation of Twitter data [39].

We developed a series of hypotheses a priori based on previous evidence of AI strategies and
campaigns. If AI-funded bodies are independent of the alcohol industry (as is argued by Drinkaware,
see for example [40]), then no clear pattern should be observed, and their tweets should not reflect
alcohol industry positions. On the other hand if, as has been noted previously [41], these bodies exist
primarily to reflect and defend industry positions, then their Twitter activity should reflect industry
arguments, concerns and topics, and should be significantly different from those of non-industry
affiliated charities.
Our prior hypotheses were:
H1: The topics covered by AI-funded bodies would be similar to the Global Alcohol Producers
Commitments [42]. These are: reducing under-age drinking; strengthening and expanding marketing
codes of practice; providing consumer information and responsible product innovation; reducing
drinking and driving; and enlisting the support of retailers to reduce harmful drinking.
H2: That tweets by AI-funded bodies would have a focus on behavioural aspects of drinking and
drink-related harms (i.e., visible antisocial behaviour, rather than chronic health harms), as has been
found previously [18];
H3: That AI-funded bodies would be less likely to tweet warning consumers about pregnancy
and related issues, and about cancers [8,19]. Since the number of tweets about cancer is low overall,
we also included all cancer related tweets from 2017, as this would allow the frequency of tweeting
about specific types of cancer to be analysed;
H4: That Twitter communications by AI-funded bodies would be primarily addressed to young
women (because visible public drinking and alcohol-related anti-social behaviour in young women is
a PR risk to the industry [18]);
H5: That they would emphasis non-regulatory and self-regulatory initiatives [15];
H6: That tweets by AI-funded bodies would show evidence of normalisation of new drinking
occasions (e.g., work drinks days), because of evidence that industry CSR ‘responsible drinking’
campaigns can have the dual effect of promoting drinking [2,43], and
H7: Related to H6, that Twitter activity of AI-funded bodies would be more likely to include
alcohol, and drinking-related images.
H8: For the analyses of images in the tweets, based on previous research and knowledge of
AI priorities we hypothesised that images in tweets by AI-funded bodies would be more likely to
include women, and young women in particular; children; images of alcoholic drinks, and images of
people drinking.
The data were analysed in SPSS (SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY, USA:
IBM Corp).
We used Z tests to analyse the most common 20 topics, comparing industry-related to non-industry
related bodies. Two-tailed p-values and 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions
are presented.
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of Themes
After coding, the tweets were grouped into forty-five topics across all sources (i.e., both
industry-funded and non-industry-funded), plus an ‘other’ category (i.e., where individual tweets
could not be coded to any of the 45 topics). Similar tweets were coded into the same category, then the
categories ordered by overall frequency. The twenty most common topics tweeted about are broken
down by organisation in Table 2, and listed in order of overall frequency of appearance (for the full list
of 45 topics see Supplementary Table S1).

Table 3 compares the topics covered by AI-funded organisations as a group, with non-AI-funded
organisations (charities and independent not-for-profit bodies) in terms of these top twenty topics.
It shows that in every health-related topic area except two (mental health and calories/obesity),
AI-funded organisations were significantly less likely to tweet about that topic.

For example, AI-funded bodies were significantly less likely to tweet about alcohol marketing,
advertising and sponsorship; issues related to alcohol pricing, including MUP; physical health harms,
including cancers, heart disease, dementia and diabetes; and fertility and pregnancy. They were less
likely to tweet about anger/aggression as a consequence of drinking too much; and about the impact
of alcohol on emergency services.

Alcohol industry-funded bodies were significantly more likely to tweet about drinking too much,
cutting down, children and underage drinking, teens/parents, staying safe while drinking, alcohol
units and guidelines, calories/obesity, and alcohol-free or low alcohol drinks. They are also more likely
to tweet about drink driving.
Consistent with the initial hypotheses, they are significantly more likely to tweet about
issues related to the Global Alcohol Producers “Producers Commitments to Reduce Harmful
Drinking” (especially underage drinking, drinking and driving), behavioural aspects of drinking
(anger/aggression; drink driving; “cutting down/cutting back”); and informational aspects—e.g.,
knowing about guidelines and units.
3.2. Cancer-Related Tweets
One hypothesis was that industry-funded bodies would tweet less about specific types of cancer,
given that there is previous evidence that they downplay the risk of cancer from alcohol consumption,
in particular breast cancer. We analysed the cancer tweets from each source, to determine which
specific cancers were mentioned across 2016 and 2017. It was only possible to include two of the
industry-funded sources and two of the non-industry-funded sources as there were no relevant
cancer-related tweets from other sources. We included only tweets from any source which mentioned
cancer risk, and excluded tweets which did not specifically mention risk of cancer from alcohol
consumption. The latter were typically tweets which included a Twitter handle from a cancer charity,
but without specifically mentioning alcohol consumption. We were able to include tweets from
industry-funded sources Drinkaware, and Drinkaware.ie, and from the independent charities Alcohol
Concern and Alcohol Action Ireland; a total of 59 mentions of cancer from industry-funded sources,
and 116 from independent alcohol charities (Supplementary Table S2).
The total number of tweets mentioning alcohol and cancer risk was lower for the two AI-funded
bodies combined across both years (n = 59 (3.1%)) vs. the non-AI-funded bodies (n = 116 (9.48%)).
When tweeting about cancer, the AI-funded bodies were significantly less likely to mention breast
cancer (9/59 mentions of breast cancer: 15.25%) than non-AI-funded bodies (38/116; 32.76%) (Z = 2.47;
95%CI of difference = 3.62, 31.4; p (2-tailed) = 0.014).
Over half of Drinkaware’s cancer-related tweets in 2016 mentioned oral cancer. In four of
these tweets, Drinkaware stated that the risk of oral cancer comes from ‘excessive’ drinking, which
is inaccurate.
3.3. Content of Tweeted Images
We coded the visual content of the images included in tweets, comparing industry-and
non-industry–funded sources. We examined how often women, children, and images of alcoholic
beverages, as well as images of alcohol being drunk were represented Table 4.

The industry-funded bodies were significantly more likely to show the relevant drinking, image
or population group in every case. In each case most of this difference was due to Drinkaware tweets—
(i.e., in each case Drinkaware was by far the largest group (see Supplementary Table S1)). For example
where there was an image of people, 17.7% of Drinkaware tweets included only or mainly young
women; the largest comparable percentage for a non-industry body was 2.7% (Alcohol Concern).
We found no evidence of these AI–funded bodies using images in their Twitter feed to extend
drinking occasions (thus rejecting Hypothesis 6).
Table 5 summarises the study findings according to the eight main study hypotheses.
Table 5. Summary of findings relating to the eight key hypotheses.
Hypotheses
Finding
H1: The topics covered by AI-funded bodies would
be similar to the Global Alcohol Producers
Commitments. (reducing under-age drinking;
strengthening and expanding marketing codes of
practice; providing consumer information and
responsible product innovation; reducing drinking
and driving; and enlisting the support of retailers to
reduce harmful drinking).
AI–funded bodies were more likely to tweet about
reducing underage drinking; alcohol-free and
low-alcohol drinks (relevant to product innovation); and
drinking and driving. Not enough tweets clearly
attributable to marketing codes of practice, or enlisting
the support of retailers to permit analysis.
They were significantly more likely to mention
information aspects of drinking—e.g., the alcohol
guidelines, and knowing about units.
H2. That AI-funded tweets would have a focus on
behavioural aspects of drinking and drink-related
harms (i.e., visible antisocial behaviour, rather than
chronic health harms).
AI-funded organisations were much more likely to tweet
about behavioural aspects of drinking (e.g., drinking too
much; ‘staying safe’; ‘cutting down/cutting back’).
H3. That AI-funded bodies would be less likely to
tweet warning consumers about pregnancy and
related issues, and about cancers.
AI-funded organisations were significantly less likely to
tweet about pregnancy or fertility; cancers, and breast
cancer specifically; and alcohol harms more generally.
H4. That AI-funded organisations’ Twitter
communications would be primarily addressed to
young women (because visible public drinking and
alcohol-related anti-social behaviour in young
women is a PR risk to the industry).
AI–funded organisations’ images were significantly more
likely to include women, and young women specifically.
H5. That they would emphasis non-regulatory and
self-regulatory initiatives.
AI-funded organisations were significantly less likely to
mention taxation or pricing (e.g., minimum unit pricing);
more likely to mention the alcohol guidelines, which are
non-regulatory.
H6. That they would show evidence of normalisation
of new drinking occasions (e.g., work drinks days),
because of evidence that industry CSR ‘responsible
drinking’ campaigns can have the dual effect of
promoting drinking.
No clear evidence of this was observed in the data; the
hypothesis was, therefore, rejected.
H7. Related to H6, that industry-funded
organisations’ Twitter activity would be more likely
to include alcohol, and drinking-related images.
Industry-funded organisations’ tweets were significantly
more likely to show people drinking, and alcoholic
beverages.
H8. For the analyses of images in the tweets, based
on previous research and knowledge of AI priorities
we hypothesised that industry-funded organisations’
images would be more likely to include women, and
young women in particular; children; images of
alcoholic drinks, and images of people drinking.
Industry-funded bodies (predominantly Drinkaware)
were significantly more likely to show the relevant
drinking, image or population group in every case.
4. Discussion
Babor and Robaina (2013) in their analysis of the activities of alcohol industry CSR organisations,
describe how “ . . . there are common corporate interests across the spectrum of industry organizations,
which sometimes conflict with public health and medical priorities but, at other times, are compatible
with them” [41].
This analysis provides a clear analysis of the commonalities these organisations share with their
corporate funders, and how they may conflict with public health priorities. It is clear firstly that these
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 892
8 of 12
AI-funded bodies Twitter activities are consistent with the global alcohol producers’ commitments, as
listed in Table 1 [42]. This activity prioritises behavioural aspects of drinking, with a particular focus
on young women, rather than on specific health harms. This is consistent with previous evidence that
the purpose of such bodies is the protection of the alcohol industry’s reputation and, in particular, to
protect against the reputational harms caused by publicly visible alcohol-related antisocial behaviour
(ASB), particularly in young women [18].
Consistent with this, these industry-funded organisations are significantly less likely to tweet
about chronic health harms, cancers in particular. They are also much less likely to tweet (if at
all) about issues which are likely to negatively impact on the alcohol industry, particularly alcohol
advertising, sponsorship, and regulation of pricing (e.g., MUP). By selectively focusing on issues
like ASB, AI-funded bodies’ Twitter activity may help shape perceptions as to what is needed to
address alcohol-related harms; that is, education and individual responsibility, as opposed to more
effective approaches, such as regulation of the industry and the conditions under which they supply
and sell their products. This is a well-documented alcohol industry strategy, and it suggests that these
organisations’ Twitter activities are closely aligned with that strategy [15,44].
The focus away from health harms, particularly cancer, by the alcohol industry-funded
organisations is also consistent with what is already known. One other pattern also may be apparent.
In the UK during 2016, (when most of the data were collected) there was considerable UK media
discussion on breast cancer and alcohol, particularly in the early part of the year when the UK Chief
Medical Officers (CMO’s) new alcohol consumption guidelines were released (on 6 January 2016).
There was considerable media discussion of alcohol and breast cancer risk, following the discussion of
this issue by the CMO. During this period the focus of tweets from the Drinkaware account were on
oral cancer, rather than breast cancer, and most of their tweets about oral cancer tweets were confined
to this period. Furthermore, the message conveyed was, at times, inaccurate, associating the risk with
“excessive” drinking. The risk of oral cancer with alcohol consumption is in fact linear.
Industry-funded organisations’ pattern of tweeting about alcohol and pregnancy is also
significantly different from non-industry-funded bodies (i.e., Hypothesis 3). It is known that AI-funded
bodies misrepresent the evidence on the risks of alcohol consumption in relation to pregnancy and
fertility [45], and provide inadequate and unclear information on pregnancy—for example, by smaller
pregnancy warning labels on wine bottles (more likely to be drunk by women); and not using red
(‘stop’) pregnancy warning labels [46]. The findings here are consistent with this: AI-funded bodies do
not appear to use Twitter to raise awareness about pregnancy and fertility. It is possible that this is
because it potentially has a negative effect on the female market, which is increasingly important to
the alcohol industry [47,48].
In general this focus in industry messaging away from health harms and towards individual
behaviours may also be seen as an attempt to (re)define or (re)capture the narrative, a recognised
industry tactic across many industries [49]. In this case, it may reflect an alcohol industry framing of
the issue of alcohol harms as one of individual responsibility, and ‘lack of control’ of one’s drinking, as
opposed to a public health problem. This may explain the differences between the industry-funded
and non-industry funded organisations, in which harms they discuss.
This framing may also be seen in the images included in the tweets. The AI-funded bodies
were significantly more likely to use alcohol and drinking images. Alcohol/drinking images have
been shown to act as a cue to alcohol craving and drinking [50–52], and it has also been found that
alcohol information materials encouraging ‘responsible drinking’ can have the opposite effect, by
encouraging drinking [7,31]. The use of images, in the absence of explicit advertising, and their impact
is well documented by studies of tobacco industry (strategies. For example, that industry’s close
relationship with Hollywood and the association between exposure to smoking imagery in films
and smoking initiation and consumption are well established [53,54]. Working through front group
Netnographica, the tobacco industry has also exploited social media platforms by paying young social
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 892
9 of 12
media influencers to post images of smoking and cigarettes without disclosure of payment, thereby
reaching millions of followers [55].
Overall, these suggest that there is a difference between the stated visions, values and missions of
the AI-funded bodies, and their actual activities. For example, Drinkaware states that they will fulfil
their vision of reducing alcohol-related harm by raising awareness of the harms of alcohol as well as
providing impartial and evidence-based information [56]. These analyses show that their messages
delivered via social media are very different from those of independent organisations, do not reflect
many public health priorities, and appear to align with alcohol industry-interests.
Further, it is also notable that industry-funded organisations are more likely to tweet about
Alcohol-free or low alcohol drinks, perhaps reflecting the rapid industry development of this market.
One implication of these differences is that industry-provided information may represent a risk
to public health, if it selectively frames alcohol harms in particular ways, and misrepresents health
information (as is known to be the case). Moreover lack of consistency across industry-funded and
non-industry-funded sources of health information may cause doubt in the public mind, for example
by appearing to show a lack of consensus on the health harms of alcohol consumption, or the levels of
alcohol associated with specific harms.
The significant strength of this study is the direct, quantitative comparison with independent,
non-industry-funded organisations, and the analysis of both text, and images. The main limitation
is that we have no direct information on the intentions behind the Twitter activity—e.g., no internal
documents or evidence of why certain words or images were chosen, nor how the use and content of
Twitter accounts is managed and governed or how tweet content is developed within the organisations.
We, therefore, make the assumption that the content of tweets reflect the aims and values of the
organisations as opposed to individuals within them. We are also unable to confirm the prioritisation
afforded to tweeting within each of the organisations’ communications approaches and whether this
differs between organisations. However, our conclusions are supported by the fact that the findings
are consistent with previous findings regarding AI activities and strategies.
There are also some potentially important areas for further research. Further detailed analysis of
the imaging in AI tweets and websites is needed. We also noted instances where images and graphic
design aspects of industry tweets appeared to subvert health information in the accompanying text.
Further analysis of such ‘nudge’ type methods in industry social media activity and on their websites,
and the impact these have on the user, would be very important.
5. Conclusions
This analysis provides further evidence that SAPROs such as Drinkaware and DrinkWise may
be a mechanism by which alcohol industry framings are disseminated to the public. The concerns
of these industry-funded bodies, as evidenced through their Twitter activity, closely mirror alcohol
industry positions (e.g., the Global Alcohol Producers commitments) and strategies. These strategies
are represented strongly in their tweets, particularly focusing on individual responsibility, rather than
industry responsibility; not mentioning alcohol marketing, availability and pricing; under-representing
health harms, and cancers in particular; focusing on young women because of the reputational risk
to the industry caused by visible drunkenness in women; and a selective focus on the behavioural
aspects of drinking. Claims by these bodies about their independence from industry are not supported
by the evidence.
