igh salt intake is a major risk factor for hypertension and 
is associated cardiovascular events.1–3 The World Health 
Organization has proposed salt reduction as the key dietary 
target for 2025 to reduce mortality from the main noncom-
municable diseases.4 Most countries in the world have a tra-
ditionally high salt intake and consume dietary salt far beyond 
the 5 g/d recommended by the World Health Organization.5–7 
The worldwide prevalence of hypertension has tremendously 
increased during the previous several decades.8 Thus, effec-
tively restricting salt consumption is crucial for preventing 
hypertension induced by high salt intake in the population.
Current measures for reducing salt intake include edu-
cation on healthy lifestyles, a campaign for the use of salt 
spoons, and the promotion of low-sodium salt with the addi-
tion of magnesium and potassium.9 However, traditional cook-
ing habits and changes in the taste of food have dampened the 
effectiveness of salt reduction at the population level.6,7 High 
salt intake is associated with altered salt sensitivity and the 
development of a demand for salted food.9,10 Thus, an alterna-
tive strategy for reducing salt intake may be to modify the 
perception of saltiness.
It is well established that the central gustatory system and 
the mesolimbic structures are critical for taste signal process-
ing and hedonic responses to foods. Palatability is the conse-
quence of the stimulation of brain reward pathways, which 
indicates that an individual’s salt preference may be associ-
ated with the neural hedonic properties of salted foods.11 The 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), as the secondary taste cortex, has 
been shown to be specifically associated with hedonic aspects 
and thus the subjective pleasantness of taste.12
Capsaicin—the major pungent component of chili pep-
per—has been shown to influence salt sensitivity in humans.13 
Epidemiological and experimental studies have indicated an 
extensive protective role of spicy food or capsaicin against 
Abstract—High salt intake is a major risk factor for hypertension and is associated with cardiovascular events. Most 
countries exhibit a traditionally high salt intake; thus, identification of an optimal strategy for salt reduction at the 
population level may have a major impact on public health. In this multicenter, random-order, double-blind observational 
and interventional study, subjects with a high spice preference had a lower salt intake and blood pressure than subjects 
who disliked spicy food. The enjoyment of spicy flavor enhanced salt sensitivity and reduced salt preference. Salt 
intake and salt preference were related to the regional metabolic activity in the insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) 
of participants. Administration of capsaicin—the major spicy component of chili pepper—enhanced the insula and 
OFC metabolic activity in response to high-salt stimuli, which reversed the salt intensity–dependent differences in 
the metabolism of the insula and OFC. In animal study, OFC activity was closely associated with salt preference, and 
salty-taste information processed in the OFC was affected in the presence of capsaicin. Thus, interventions related to 
this region may alter the salt preference in mice through fiber fluorometry and optogenetic techniques. In conclusion, 
enjoyment of spicy foods may significantly reduce individual salt preference, daily salt intake, and blood pressure by 
modifying the neural processing of salty taste in the brain. Application of spicy flavor may be a promising behavioral 
intervention for reducing high salt intake and blood pressure.  (Hypertension. 2017;70:1291-1299. DOI: 10.1161/

cardiometabolic diseases.14–18 It is worth examining whether 
spicy food consumption may reduce dietary salt intake 
and whether spicy flavor may affect salty-taste perception. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that capsaicin administration 
could reduce salt intake by modifying the neural process-
ing of salty-taste signals. To test this hypothesis, we initially 
examined the participants’ preferences for salty and spicy fla-
vors, salt intake, and blood pressure in a community-based 
cross-sectional study. We subsequently validated the effect 
of capsaicin on the neural perception of saltiness through 
a randomized, double-blind interventional study. Finally, 
we validated our hypothesis in rodents using optogenetic 
approaches.
Methods
Detailed Methods are provided in the online-only Data Supplement. 
The human study was conducted according to the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All protocols and experimental procedures 
were approved by the institutional ethics committee of the hospital, 
Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee, Daping 
Hospital, Third Military Medical University.
Statistical Analyses
In human study, the baseline characteristics of the participants 
were compared between the groups using the χ2 test for categori-
cal variables and the 2 sample t test for continuous variables. The 
2 sample t test was used to evaluate differences in the positron 
emission tomography images between the groups. Linear regres-
sion analysis was performed to assess the relationships among salt 
intake, salt preference, and changes in regional glucose metabo-
lism. Multivariable adjustment for variables, including age, sex, 
educational level, work status, fasting blood glucose, body mass 
index, and waist circumstance, as well as the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CIs), were estimated by covariance 
analysis with a univariate general linear model. Numeric results 
are presented as the mean±SD or the mean and 95% CI. The posi-
tron emission tomography/computed tomography images were 
processed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 8.0), and a 
critical P≤0.005 (uncorrected) with a cluster filter of 5 voxels (1 
voxel=8 mm3) was used to identify significant differences. SPM{t} 
maps were superimposed on a standard magnetic resonance imag-
ing brain template. In the animal study, the results are represented 
as the mean±SEM. Comparisons between the groups were made 
using a 2-tailed unpaired Student t test or 1-way ANOVA with 
Tukey multiple comparisons test. The Mann–Whitney nonparamet-
ric U test was used to analyze data with an abnormal distribution. 
Numeric statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software, 
version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc), or GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0 
(GraphPad Software); a 2-sided P value of <0.05 indicated statisti-
cal significance.
Results
Baseline Characteristics of the Study Participants
The baseline characteristics of the participants are presented 
in Table 1. A preference for higher salt was associated with an 
older age, heavier physical labor, higher prevalence of hyper-
tension, and lower levels of education. Sensitivity to salt was 
also changed in the high-salt preference group, along with a 
less sensitive perception of saltiness (P=0.02) and a higher 
threshold for declaring a solution to be intolerably salty 
(P<0.01). Notably, the qualitative analysis indicated a graded 
effect of salt preference on daily salt intake (P<0.01), with 
mean values of 11.7±4.8, 13.1±5.3, and 14.3±4.7 g/d in the 
low-, medium-, and high-salt preference groups, respectively. 
The participants with a high salt preference had higher sys-
tolic blood pressure (131±15 versus 122±18 mm Hg, respec-
tively; P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (82±11 versus 
75±11 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.001) than the participants 
who had a low salt preference. Our findings indicated only 
minor changes after adjustment for several participant char-
acteristics (Table S2 in the online-only Data Supplement). 
The participants with a high salt preference had higher salt 
intake (≈1.8 g/d; 95% CI, 0.7–2.9 g/d; P<0.01), systolic 
blood pressure (≈5.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.7–8.4 mm Hg; 
P<0.01), and diastolic blood pressure (≈4.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, 
2.0–6.7 mm Hg; P<0.001) than the participants who had a 
low salt preference.
Spicy Flavor Reduced Salt Intake and Blood 
Pressure by Modifying Salt Preference and 
Sensitivity
We subsequently examined whether spicy flavor affected salt 
intake and blood pressure. A higher salt preference was asso-
ciated with a lower spice preference, which was represented 
by the proportion of participants who rated a given capsaicin 
solution as tolerable (Table 1; P<0.01). Furthermore, a high 
spice preference was associated with a more sensitive percep-
tion of saltiness (Table S1; P=0.001) and a lower threshold 
for declaring a solution to be intolerably salty (Table S1; 
P=0.001). These findings indicated that a spice preference 
may affect salt preference and sensitivity.
Next, we investigated whether spice preference affected 
salt intake and thus blood pressure. A qualitative analysis indi-
cated that the degree of spice preference affected salt intake 
and blood pressure (Figure 1A through 1C). The mean salt 
intake was 13.4±5.1, 10.9±4.5, and 10.3±3.9 g/d in the low, 
medium, and high-spice preference groups, respectively. 
Moreover, the participants with a high spice preference had a 
lower systolic blood pressure (118±15 versus 126±17 mm Hg, 
respectively; P<0.01) and lower diastolic blood pressure 
(73±9 versus 78±12 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.01) than the 
participants who had a low spice preference. These values 
showed few changes after adjustment for several participant 
characteristics (Table 2). After adjustment, the participants 
with a high spice preference maintained a lower salt intake 
(2.5 g/d; 95% CI, 1.1–3.8 g/d; P<0.001), lower systolic blood 
pressure (6.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, 2.4–10.9 mm Hg; P<0.01), and 
lower diastolic blood pressure (4.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.0–7.0 
mm Hg; P<0.05) than the participants who had a low spice 
preference.
Capsaicin Administration Increased Insular and 
OFC Responses to Salty Taste
High levels of cognitive processing influenced the responses 
to environmental stimuli, such as salty foods. We subsequently 
examined how brain metabolism changes in response to a salt 
stimulus in individuals with high salt consumption. The salt 
intake and salt preference scores were positively correlated 
with the regional metabolic activity as determined by positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography in the insula 
and OFC under stimulation with 150 or 200 mmol/L NaCl 
(Figure S1). In humans, responses recorded from the insula 
have been correlated with the subjective intensity of taste.19

Intensity-dependent changes in metabolic activity were iden-
tified in the insula and thalamus using different concentra-
tions of NaCl stimulation (150 and 200 mmol/L; Figure S2). 
This finding indicated that increased brain metabolic activity 
is associated with high salt intake and high-salt preference 
scores in humans.
We subsequently addressed whether changes in salt-
induced brain metabolic activity may be modified by capsaicin 
administration. A human behavioral study showed that cap-
saicin administration at 0.5 μmol/L did not produce a burn-
ing sensation on the tongue but did increase the perception of 
saltiness.13 We showed that 0.5-μmol/L capsaicin administra-
tion significantly increased activity in the insula and OFC in 
response to high salt stimulation (Figure 2A and 2B). Notably, 
the intensity-dependent metabolic activity changes reversed 
when 0.5 μmol/L capsaicin was added to the solution of 
150 mmol/L NaCl (Figure 2C and 2D). Most importantly, the 
brain regions activated by capsaicin overlapped with the brain 
regions stimulated by salty taste (Figure 2E). These results 
indicate that capsaicin can modify the sensation of salt inten-
sity via the activation of brain regions involved in the hedonic 
experience of salt.
Peripheral Salty-Taste Signals and Spicy Flavor 
Evoked Neuronal Population Activities of OFC
We further examined the findings in rodent models. We used 
a fiber fluorometry method to record the neuronal population 
activity in terms of calcium wave signals20 and investigated 
the potential role of capsaicin in central salty-taste process-
ing in both anesthetized and freely moving mice (Figure 3A 
and 3B). The calcium waves evoked by different concentra-
tions of NaCl solutions with or without capsaicin exhibited

distinct waveforms (Figure 3A and 3B), which indicate that 
salty tastes were encoded by neurons in the OFC. Notably, 
the time courses of calcium waves are in the range of 2 to 
5 seconds, which are highly comparable with the typical 
activation timing of functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing signals.21 Furthermore, the amplitude of the 200-mmol/L 
NaCl–evoked waves was significantly higher than the 
150-mmol/L NaCl–evoked waves in the anesthetized mice, 
whereas the amplitude of the 150-mmol/L NaCl–capsaicin-
evoked waves was significantly higher than the 150-mmol/L 
NaCl–evoked waves in both the anesthetized (Figure 3C 
and 3D) and freely moving (Figure 3E and 3F) mice. Thus, 
these results suggested that a peripheral salt stimulus could 
evoke higher OFC activity levels and in a dose-dependent 
manner, which could be affected by a capsaicin stimulus. 
Nevertheless, the frequency of the 150-mmol/L NaCl–
capsaicin-evoked waves was significantly larger than the 
150-mmol/L NaCl–evoked waves in the freely moving mice 
but not the anesthetized mice (Figure S4A and S4B), which 
indicates that the OFC neural excitability could be changed 
by a capsaicin stimulus at normal physiological conditions.
Interventions Related to OFC Altered Salt 
Preference
Finally, we investigated whether intervening in OFC activity 
could result in changes in the salty-capsaicin preference through 
activating or inhibiting neuronal activity by means of optogenet-
ics in mice. The salt preference of mice was determined by cal-
culating the relative ratio of licking actions for different solutions 
(Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). In 1 example of 
a naive mouse, the ratio of licks for the 150-mmol/L NaCl solu-
tion was significantly higher than the 200-mmol/L NaCl solution 
(Figure S5A), which indicates that the mouse prefers the former 
salt level. However, the mice exhibited a significantly lowered 
preference for the 150-mmol/L NaCl with capsaicin solution 
than only the 150-mmol/L NaCl solution (Figure S5A), which 
suggests that the existence of capsaicin may enhance the sensi-
tivity of salt. To confirm the neuronal projection from the primary

V-EGFP (adeno-associated virus–vec-
tor expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein; retro) was 
injected into the OFC of mice, and the retrogradely labeled neu-
rons in the area of insula cortex was identified (Figure 4A). The 
mice were then injected with AAV-ChR2 (AAV vector express-
ing channelrhodopsin-2) or AAV-ArchT (archaerhodopsin) for 
the activation or inhibition of neuronal activities in the OFC. 
We subsequently analyzed mouse licking behavior in the gus-
tometer with a 30-minute test session during which they under-
went optogenetic stimulation or inhibition through an optical 
fiber (Figure 4B and 4C; Figure S5B). By stimulating the OFC 
activity, the preference for the 200-mmol/L NaCl solution was 
further decreased, whereas the preference for the 150-mmol/L 
NaCl solution significantly increased in the mice (Figure 4D 
and 4E). In contrast, the mice exhibited a significantly increased 
preference for the 200-mmol/L NaCl solution and a decreased 
preference for the 150-mmol/L NaCl solution after OFC activ-
ity inhibition (Figure 4D and 4E). These results suggested that 
the stronger activation of the OFC strengthened the aversion for 
high-salt solutions and hedonic for low-salt solutions, vice versa. 
Furthermore, the mice exhibited a decreased preference for the 
150-mmol/L NaCl solution with capsaicin during OFC activ-
ity stimulation (Figure 4F), which indicates that capsaicin may 
influence the perception of salty taste in the OFC. To validate the

the spontaneous and optogenetically evoked calcium waves 
in the OFC of Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mice. Spontaneous and 
optogenetically evoked calcium waves recorded at a given loca-
tion had similar waveforms (Figure S5C), which indicates that 
the optogenetically activated neuronal population is largely the 
same as the neuronal population involved in the salt prefer-

The major findings in this study demonstrate that the enjoy-
ment of spicy taste enhanced the sensitivity to salty taste and 
lowered the daily salt intake and blood pressure in participants. 
Furthermore, high salt intake and salt preference were closely 
correlated with increased brain activity in the insula and OFC 
of the participants. Capsaicin administration increased activa-
tion of the insula and OFC in response to high-salt stimuli, 
which reversed the salt intensity–dependent differences in 
activity in the insula and OFC. Similar to humans, salty-taste 
information processed in the OFC was affected in the pres-
ence of capsaicin in mice. Optogenetic stimulation on the 
OFC strengthened the aversion for high-salt solutions and 
hedonic for low-salt solutions, which could be reversed by the 
addition of capsaicin in salt solutions.
The estimation of dietary salt intake using various method-
ologies has indicated that the mean salt consumption is ≈11.0 
to 14.0 g/d (2.5 g salt contains 1 g sodium) in the population,6,22 
which far exceeds the dietary salt intake level recommended 
by the World Health Organization. Substantial effort has been 
made to reduce salt intake; however, the high consumption of 
dietary salt in China has hardly changed during the previous sev-
eral decades.9,23 Similarly, despite numerous initiatives, sodium 
consumption in the United States has been relatively constant 
and well above recommended amounts for more than a decade.10 
Thus, the identification of an alternative strategy for reducing salt 
intake is critical for the prevention of salt-induced hypertension.
Chili pepper is perhaps the world’s most widely consumed 
spice,24–26 and both spicy and hot are reported to be among the 
most appealing flavors in both China and the United States.27 
A human study showed that the administration of capsaicin at 
a low concentration that does not cause a burning sensation on 
the tongue may enhance saltiness.13 In this study, we showed 
that the participants who liked spicy food had a reduction of 
≈2.5 g in their daily salt intake, which is noteworthy because 
the reduction of daily salt intake by 3 g has been shown to 
produce a protective effect against hypertension and related 
cardiovascular diseases.28 Furthermore, Lv et al14 also showed 
that consumption of spicy foods was inversely associated with 
total and certain cause-specific mortality in a Chinese popula-
tion. Because chili pepper is the most popular flavor substitute 
worldwide, the consumption of spicy foods may beneficially 
reduce dietary salt intake in the general population.
The human preference for salted food is the hedonic 
response to saltiness and is strongly influenced by its sensory 
properties.29 The central gustatory system and the mesolimbic 
structures play critical roles in discerning salt-taste signals as

aversive or pleasant. The insula has appeared to be more sen-
sitive to the intensity of taste and is involved in establishing 
emotionally relevant sensory experiences30; the OFC is sug-
gested as a secondary taste cortex that receives inputs from 
the insula cortex,31 which has been shown to be particularly 
associated with hedonic aspects and thus the subjective pleas-
antness of taste in humans.32 Moreover, the OFC has been 
suggested in the control of appetite and food intake.33 In our 
human neuroimaging study, we determined that the metabolic 
activity changes of the OFC in response to salt stimulus were 
positively correlated with individual daily salt intake and 
salt preference. Similar findings were obtained in the animal 
study, with increased OFC activity in response to ascending 
concentrations of NaCl solutions applied peripherally. Seemly 
discrepancy results of salt preference were obtained in the 
intervening of OFC activity from our optogenetic experimen-
tal studies. Nevertheless, it has also been reported that both 
pleasant and aversive tastes were presented in the OFC.34 
Furthermore, the OFC has been reported to play a key role 
in guiding behavior adaptively on the basis of reward value, 
including receiving rewards and punishments and processing 
of the values.35 Thus, it is rationale to assume that the OFC 
activity represented pleasantness for lower concentrations 
of salt solution, with an aversion reaction for higher concen-
trations of salt solution. This finding also explains the dose-
dependent increment of neural calcium wave amplitudes 
recorded at the OFC in response to various concentrations of 
salt solutions.
In this study, we determined that capsaicin administration 
increased the metabolic activity in both the insula and the OFC 
in response to salty-taste stimuli. Notably, capsaicin mediated 
an increase in brain activity that could reverse the differences 
in the intensity-dependent activity induced by salty-taste stim-
uli identified in these brain regions. As reported, a remarkable 
difference of the OFC from other related brain nuclei was the 
greater convergence of neurons to taste features, which pro-
vided a basis for different behavioral responses to particular 
combinations of oral sensory stimuli.31 Taken together with 
the findings of our optogenetic experimental study on the 
OFC, it seems that capsaicin may turn the aversion reaction 
for a salt solution into a lower concentration. Our previous 
studies have also indicated a protective role of capsaicin in 
cardiometabolic diseases.15,18,36 Through direct intervention on 
OFC neuronal activities while monitoring salty-taste prefer-
ence, we provided additional evidence of the influence of cap-
saicin on central salty-taste perception (Figure S6).
Study Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, our clinical study was 
limited by its cross-sectional nature. It is unknown whether 
the current findings may be generalized to other populations 
outside of China. Moreover, the correlation between the enjoy-
ment of spicy flavor and reduced salt intake must be validated 
through a prospective intervention study. Second, an accuracy 
measurement of individual daily salt intake is helpful to evalu-
ate this relevance; however, it is difficult to use in a population 
survey. Third, the animal studies suggested a potential salt-
reduction effect of capsaicin; however, the underlying mecha-
nisms remain elusive.
Perspectives
High salt intake contributes to the pathogenesis of hyperten-
sion and its associated cardiovascular events. Healthy life-
styles have been used to reduce salt intake for many years; 
however, traditional cooking habits and changes in the taste 
of food have dampened the effectiveness of salt reduction 
at the population level. This clinical trial combined with an 
experimental study for the first time shows that salt intake and 
salt preference were related to the regional metabolic activ-
ity in the insula and OFC of individuals. Furthermore, cap-
saicin administration enhanced insula and OFC metabolism 
in response to high-salt stimuli; thus, the enjoyment of spicy 
foods significantly reduced individual salt preference, daily 
salt intake, and blood pressure by modifying the neural pro-
cessing of salty taste in the brain (Figure S6). Capsaicin rich 
in Chili pepper is perhaps the world’s most widely consumed 
food with spicy flavor. Considering the unsatisfactory effect 
of the existing salt-reduction strategy, this study provided 
insights for the enjoyment of spicy flavor as a promising and 
precise behavioral intervention for reducing high salt intake 
and blood pressure.

What Is New?
• This study is the first investigation to demonstrate the enjoyment of spicy 
flavor enhances central salty-taste perception.
• Capsaicin administration enhances insula and orbitofrontal cortex me-
tabolism in response to high-salt stimuli and reverses the salt intensity–
dependent differences in activity in these brain areas.
• Optogenetic intervention on the orbitofrontal cortex alters salt preference 
in rodents.
What Is Relevant?
• Enjoyment of spicy foods may significantly reduce individual salt pref-
erence, daily salt intake, and blood pressure by modifying the neural 
processing of salty taste in the brain.
• The consumption of foods with spicy flavor promotes a novel lifestyle 
intervention for reducing high salt intake and blood pressure.
Summary
Spicy food supplementation is a promising strategy for salt reduc-
tion at the population level, either as a functional dietary factor or 
in conjunction with conventional lifestyle changes.
