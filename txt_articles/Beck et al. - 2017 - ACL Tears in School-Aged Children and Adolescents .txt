BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are thought to occur with increasing 
frequency in young patients. No study has shown increased incidence over time. We 
hypothesized the incidence of ACL tears in young patients has increased over the past 20 
years.
METHODS: This descriptive epidemiology study is a retrospective review of insurance billing 
data of all patients aged 6 to 18 years with Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Revision 
codes for ACL tear and reconstruction or International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification codes from 1994 to 2013. Injuries were normalized to 
persons per year enrolled in the insurance database based on age and sex. Analysis was 
performed based on sex and age (6–14, 15–16, and 17–18 years).
RESULTS: The rate of ACL tears per 100 000 person-years averaged 121 ± 19 (range 92–151). 
All trends increased significantly except for the male 6- to 14-year-old and 17- to 18-year-
old age groups. Overall there was an annual increase of 2.3%. Females had significantly 
higher incidence except in the 17- to 18-year-olds. Females peaked at age 16 years and 
males at age 17 years, with rates of 392 ACL tears and 422 ACL tears per 100 000 person-
years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ACL tears in pediatric patients increased over the last 20 
years. Females were at higher risk except in the 17- to 18-year -old group. Peak incidence 
is noted during high school years. These data help target the most at-risk patients for ACL 
prevention programs.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Recent reports 
of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in 
young patients suggest the incidence is increasing. 
However, true incidence data are scarce. Female 
patients are at higher risk of ACL injury than males 
participating in similar activities.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We present incidence data 
for ACL tears in young patients and show that the 
incidence increased over the past 20 years. Girls 
exhibit higher risk until age 17. The ages most at risk 
are 16 for girls and 17 for boys.

Midsubstance tears of the anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL) were 
classically thought to be rare injuries 
in young patients, with tibial spine 
avulsion fractures supposedly 
representing the equivalent injury in 
patients with open physes. 
1 Others 
have noted that ACL tears seem to be 
presenting with greater frequency 
in pediatric patients, including 
patients as young as 5 years 
old.

6 The increase in ACL surgical 
consultations in young patients has 
been attributed to multiple factors, 
including increased participation in 
high-demand year-round sports at an 
earlier age, better clinician awareness 
and recognition of the signs and 
symptoms of ACL tears, increased 
female athletic participation, and 
the expanded role of magnetic 
resonance imaging in the diagnosis 
of intra-articular knee pathology.

Identifying these injuries may 
be important to avoid additional 
intra-articular knee injuries and 
chondral damage through activity 
modification or recently developed 
surgical reconstruction techniques 
that minimize or avoid physeal 
damage.

21 Large population-
based epidemiologic studies often 
group young patients together and 
report very low rates of ACL injuries 
in school-aged patients, and none to 
our knowledge have looked at the 
change in incidence over time.22, 
 
23 
Thus, the goal of this study was to 
review the billing database of a large 
metropolitan insurance network to 
determine whether the number of 
ACL tears has increased over the past 
20 years. We also sought to examine 
differences between sex, age, and 
delay in surgery over the study 
period. We hypothesized that there 
would be an increase in the incidence 
of ACL tears in patients ≤18 years 
of age over the past 20 years, with 
female patients showing a higher rate 
of increase than male patients.
METHODS
A retrospective review of insurance 
billing data in a large metropolitan 
network was performed for all 
children and adolescents aged 
6 to 18 years with International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) codes for ACL tears and 
Current Procedural Terminology, 
Fourth Revision (CPT-4) codes for 
ACL reconstruction from January 
1994 to December 2013. Patients 
were included if they had ≥2 
occurrences of ACL diagnosis 
codes (844.2 or 717.83) on medical 
claims ≤4 months apart, or ≥1 
ACL procedure codes (29888) 
during the study period. Therefore, 
all patients with ACL tears were 
included, not just those with surgical 
reconstruction. Multiple ACL injuries 
per patient were counted if >4 
months elapsed between diagnoses. 
Patients were excluded if they were 
outside the included age ranges, if 
the first diagnosis code was outside 
a member’s enrollment period, or if 
they had only 1 ICD-9-CM code.
Analysis included year-by-year 
total incidence of ACL injury and a 
breakdown by sex and ages grouped 
6 to 14 years, 15 to 16 years, and 
17 to 18 years. Denominators were 
normalized to patients per year 
enrolled in the insurance database 
based on age and sex to calculate 
rates per 100 000 person-years 
specific to that cohort. Because 
we used the insurance network, 
all patients in the network were 
captured by the insurance data 
search. In addition, because we 
queried it on a yearly basis, we were 
able to control for patients entering 
and leaving the insurance network. 
Delay in surgery was calculated by 
time between first ICD-9-CM code 
and Current Procedural Terminology 
code for each ACL injury. The annual 
percent of ACL tears surgically 
reconstructed was calculated.
The trend of annual incidence 
for each age and sex cohort was 
tested for significance with Poisson 
regression analysis. Logistic 
regression was used to look for 
significant change in annual surgery 
rates. Linear regression was used 
to look for significant change in the 
delay in surgery. Differences between 
sexes were tested with Poisson 
regression analysis for change in 
annual incidence and for differences 
in overall and age-specific rates.
RESULTS
Total patients enrolled in the 
insurance database within our study 
age range averaged 136 000 ± 15 000 
per year, with approximately an 
even number of male and female 
patients each year. A total of 3303 
ACL tears were identified over the 
study period, 1584 (48%) ACL tears 
in male patients and 1719 (52%) in 
female patients. The overall annual 
incidence of ACL tears averaged 
121 ± 19 (range 92–151) per 100 000 
person-years (or 0.121%) ( 
Fig 1 
and  
Table 1). The incidence in male 
patients averaged 114 ± 22 (range 
83–160) per 100 000 person-years 
(or 0.114%). The incidence in female 
patients averaged 129 ± 24 (range 
98–184) per 100 000 person-years 
(or 0.129%). The breakdown by 
age groups over time for overall 
patients, male patients, and female 
patients is shown in  
Figs 2,  
3, and 4, 
respectively.
The incidence of ACL tears by age 
overall is shown in  
Fig 5. Poisson 
regression analysis indicated that 
differences in incidence between 
male and female patients by age 
were statistically significant for 
each age category (P < .001). 
Female patients peaked at age 16 
years with an incidence of 392 ACL 
tears per 100 000 person-years (or 
0.392%), and male patients peaked 
at age 17 years with an incidence of 
422 ACL tears per 100 000 person-
years (or 0.422%). We found no 
significant difference between 
the amount of change in ACL tear

and female patients overall 
(P = .6) and across the age groups 
(P = .2); however, overall incidence 
was significantly higher in female 
patients (129 ACL tears per 100 000 
person-years vs 114 ACL tears per 
100 000 person-years; P < .001) 
and in the 6- to 14-year-old (33 ACL

Overall we found that the number 
of ACL tears per 100 000 person-
years increased 2.3% per year. Male 
patients had an increase of 2.2% 
per year, and female patients had 
an increase of 2.5% per year. The 
subgroup with the highest increase 
was female 15- to 16-year-olds, 
whose incidence increased 2.6% per 
year.

Logistic regression showed that the 
percentage of ACL tears surgically 
reconstructed significantly increased 
(P < .001) ( 
Fig 6 and

linear regression analysis identified 
a significant increase in the delay to 
surgery over the study period

DISCUSSION
Through analysis of insurance data on 
a captured population of patients, we 
were able to calculate true incidence 
numbers for a large metropolitan 
population of pediatric patients. Over 
the 20 years analyzed, we found a 
2.3% annual increase in the number 
of ACL tears in patients aged 6 to 18 
years. Female patients had significantly 
higher rates of injury in the younger 
ages, but in the 17- to 18-year-old age 
group male patients had a significantly 
higher incidence. Subgroup analysis 
showed that female patients in all 3 
age groups had a significant increase 
in incidence of ACL tears over the 
study period, whereas only the male 
patients aged 15 to 16 years had an 
increased incidence. We also found 
that the percentage of ACL injuries 
surgically reconstructed increased, and 
the average time from injury to surgery 
increased significantly over our study 
period.
This study is the first of its kind to 
identify an increase in the incidence 
of ACL tears in young patients over 
the last 20 years. These data are novel 
in that they report incidence of ACL 
injury within a known, closed cohort. 
Data were obtained on a yearly basis, 
so the insurance database allows 
for correction of patients entering 
and leaving the insurance plan. In 
addition, using the insurance database 
means data are not restricted to a 
single institution because the ACL tear 
could be diagnosed in >1 location, 
or the surgery could be performed 
in a separate location, and all of 
this information would be captured 
within the insurance database. These 
measures should add to a more 
complete understanding of what we 
have suspected in terms of increases 
in pediatric ACL injury over time.

The average annual incidence of 
ACL injuries found in our study 
(0.12%) is similar to those found 
in large population-based studies. 
Nordenvall et al 
23 used data from the 
Swedish National Patient Register 
to estimate the sex- and age-specific 
incidence of ACL tears in Sweden. 
They found the average annual 
incidence to be 78 per 100 000 
inhabitants (or 0.078%). Very few 
injuries were found in patients <10 
years old, and the incidence was 
similar in male and female patients 
in the 11- to 20-year-old age group 
of 144 per 100 000 inhabitants (or 
0.14%). Gianotti et al 
22 reported 
data from New Zealand’s Accident 
Compensation Corporation showing 
a similar breakdown of incidence 
by age and sex. They also showed 
very few ACL injuries in patients <10 
years old. Their incidence in 15- to 
19-year-olds was between 65 and 
100 per 100 000 person-years for 
female and male patients respectively 
(or 0.065%–0.10%).
It is important to note that previous 
studies define rates of injury in 
different units. Studies looking at risk 
for ACL injuries in athletes or military 
personnel present their rates based 
on exposure-based denominators to 
the sport or activity by either hours 
or season. Population-based studies 
often define rates based on absolute 
time-based denominators such as 
incidence per 100 000 person-years. 
Moses et al 
24 attempted to compare 
multiple studies by converting 
incidence rates in exposure-based 
studies to annual units. They found 
studies reporting population 
incidence with a low annual median 
incidence of 0.03%. Studies of 
ACL injury data from military and 
professional sports showed much 
higher annual incidences of up to 
2.14% and 3.67%, respectively. 
Dodwell et al 
25 showed an increase 
in the rate of ACL reconstructions 
performed on pediatric (defined as 
ages 3 to 20 years old) patients in 
New York State from 1990 to 2009. 
In their study, population estimates 
from the US Census Bureau were 
used as the denominator to obtain 
rates per 100 000 population. 
They found that the rate rose 
from 17.6 ACL reconstructions 
per 100 000 population in 1990 
to 50.9 ACL reconstructions per 
100 000 population in 2009, or a 
190% increase over their study 
period. This compares to the more 
modest 2.3% yearly increase in our 
population. Their analysis by sex 
found that male patients had a 15% 
higher rate of ACL reconstructions, 
where our study showed higher 
rates in female patients except for 
the 17- to 18-year-old patients. 
Lively and Feathers 
17 found an 
increasing incidence of ACL injuries 
in a collegiate population based on 
incoming athletes’ injury history 
at a single institution from 1996 to 
2008. An athlete had a 2.7 greater 
odds of having a previous ACL injury 
in 2008 than those who arrived in 
1996. Although their analysis showed 
a nearly linear increasing trend 
by year, there was no significant 
correlation with sport (P = .41) or sex 
(P = .71).
In this study, female patients on 
average had a higher incidence 
overall and across the 6- to 14-year-
old and 15- to 16-year-old age groups 
than their male counterparts. ACL 
injury rates have been shown in 
multiple studies to be 2 to 8 times 
higher in female than male patients 
when comparing exposure to sex-
comparable sports. 
4, 
 
14, 
 
20 Reasons 
for this observed difference are 
thought to be related factors such as 
geometry of the intercondylar notch 
and smaller size of ACL, as well as 
biomechanical and neuromuscular 
factors such as higher quadriceps-to-
hamstring ratio and landing from a 
jump with less hip and knee flexion 
and more hip adduction, leading to 
increased dynamic knee valgus with 
greater knee abduction angles. 
26 It is 
interesting that male patients in the 
17- to 18-year-old age group of our 
study surpassed female patients, with 
significantly higher rates. Proposed 
explanations for this observation 
include higher intensity of collision 
sports in older male athletes, fewer 
female adolescents participating in 
sports at this age, and female athletes 
prone to ACL injury having already 
sustained injuries and no longer 
competing.
Through subgroup analysis by age 
and sex, we attempted to identify the 
most at-risk patients over our study 
period. Much effort has recently 
been put forth in the sports medicine 
community to develop prevention 
programs with neuromuscular and 
proprioceptive training, especially for 
female athletes. 
26 Noyes and Barber-
Westin 
27 conducted a systematic 
review of 8 neuromuscular retraining 
studies in female athletes. Three 
studies found a significant reduction

in the number of noncontact 
ACL injuries, with a relative risk 
reduction ranging from 75% to 
100%. The remaining 5 studies 
found no significant decrease with 
their programs; however, the overall 
ACL injury rates in these studies 
were much lower. There was a large 
discrepancy in how the programs 
were performed, based on the 
frequency, duration, supervision, and 
compliance. Myer et al 
28 performed 
a meta-analysis of neuromuscular 
training studies, specifically looking 
at the effectiveness the programs 
for different age participants. They 
included 14 clinical trials and found 
a significant age-related reduction 
in injury rate, with an odds ratio of 
0.28 in the 14- to 18-year-old female 
athletes, compared with an odds ratio 
of 0.48 in the 18- to 20-year-olds and 
1.01 in the >20-year-olds. Thus the 
programs seem to be more effective 
in younger patients. In our cohort, all 
subgroups of the female patients and 
the male 15- to 16-year-old subgroup 
showed a significant increase in ACL 
injury incidence over time. Because 
the injury rates in these cohorts seem 
to be increasing, they may also be 
the most likely to benefit from injury 
prevention programs.
Two additional findings of this study 
are that the percentage of injuries 
surgically reconstructed increased 
and the average time to surgery 
increased over our study period, 
although the time to surgery increase 
was small (<1%) and clinically 
insignificant. A traditional treatment 
approach for ACL injuries in young 
patients has been to attempt a trial 
of conservative treatment until the 
child is close to the end of growth, 
based on the assumption that the 
risk of limb length discrepancy 
and angular growth disturbances 
decreases as the patient approaches 
skeletal maturity.

29 Recent 
studies have shown poor outcomes 
with nonoperative treatment. 
Lawrence et al11 showed that 
delaying surgery of a complete ACL 
tear for >12 weeks correlated with 
a significant increase in the number 
of irreparable medial meniscal tears 
and lateral compartment chondral 
injuries. Because of this risk, multiple 
new surgical techniques have been 
developed that range from physeal-
sparing, to partial transphyseal, to 
complete transphyseal reconstruction 
with smaller, more vertical tunnels. 
1 
Studies reporting on these techniques 
are small retrospective cohorts, 
and the procedures are technically 
demanding, but the outcomes are 
encouraging. Our data suggest that 
because of the encouraging results 
in the recent literature, surgeons 
are more confident treating these 
injuries with surgical reconstruction 
at younger ages.
Our study has several limitations. 
The data were pulled from a specific 
regional geographic insurance 
database. Therefore, the injury 
and surgical treatment rates may 
reflect regional differences and 
thus may not be representative of 
other areas of the United States 
or in other countries. The people 
covered under this insurance plan 
also probably represent people 
of a certain socioeconomic class. 
Patients with a different quality of 
insurance or no insurance may have 
more or less exposure to at-risk 
activities and higher barriers to 
access of care, which may affect the 
overall incidence rate. The insurance 
database itself has limitations. 
We attempted to identify repeat 
injuries in patients who have a new 
diagnosis code after 4 months, and 
this assumption fails to include 
new injuries that occur in the first 
4 months after return to sport. For 
patients with multiple injuries, we 
were unable to distinguish between 
primary tear of the contralateral 
knee and a recurrent tear of the 
originally injured knee. In addition, 
patients with ACL injuries could 
have been missed by entering or 
leaving the health insurance plan 
before getting the 2 ICD-9-CM 
codes required for inclusion, so the 
incidence may actually be higher 
than that which is reported here. 
Despite these limitations, this is the 
first study quantifying and showing 
an increase in the incidence of ACL 
tears in school-aged children and 
adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS
This study is the first to show that the 
incidence of ACL tears in pediatric 
patients (age 6 to 18 years) has 
significantly steadily increased by 
about 2.3% annually over the last 
20 years. Female patients in all age 
categories and male patients in the 
15- to 16-year-old category showed 
the greatest increases and accounted 
for most of the overall increase. Both 
male and female adolescents have a 
peak incidence during high school 
years (age 16 years for female and 
17 years for male adolescents). 
Future studies identifying the 
mechanism of injury in young 
patients will be helpful for proposing 
prevention training.
