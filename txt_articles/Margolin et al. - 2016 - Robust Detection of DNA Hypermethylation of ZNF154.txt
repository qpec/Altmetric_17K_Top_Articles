Sites that display recurrent, aberrant DNA methylation in cancer represent potential biomarkers for screening
and diagnostics. Previously, we identified hypermethylation at the ZNF154 CpG island in 15 solid epithelial
tumor types from 13 different organs. In this study, we measure the magnitude and pattern of differential
methylation of this region across colon, lung, breast, stomach, and endometrial tumor samples using next-
generation bisulfite amplicon sequencing. We found that all tumor types and subtypes are hypermethylated at
this locus compared with normal tissue. To evaluate this site as a possible pan-cancer marker, we compare the
ability of several sequence analysis methods to distinguish the five tumor types (184 tumor samples) from
normal tissue samples (n Z 34). The classification performance for the strongest method, measured by the
area under (the receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC), is 0.96, close to a perfect value of 1.
Furthermore, in a computational simulation of circulating tumor DNA, we were able to detect limited amounts
of tumor DNA diluted with normal DNA: 1% tumor DNA in 99% normal DNA yields AUCs of up to 0.79. Our
findings suggest that hypermethylation of the ZNF154 CpG island is a relevant biomarker for identifying solid
tumor DNA and may have utility as a generalizable biomarker for circulating tumor DNA. (J Mol Diagn 2016,

One in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer,
despite an emphasis on prevention, early detection, and
treatment that has lowered cancer death rates by 20% in the
past two decades.1,2 Further improvements in survival rates
are likely to come from improving the limits of detection
sensitivity at earlier stages of cancer. Currently, a diagnosis
results from a cadre of screening and diagnostic tools that
may include physical examination, radiographic imaging,
sputum cytologic testing, blood tests, endoscopy, and/or
biopsies. However, new approaches that rely heavily on
genomic information may change future testing strategies.
The future looks bright because minimally invasive sam-
pling techniques coupled with genomic features that distin-
guish tumor cells from normal cells have the potential to detect
cancer at earlier stages. For example, circulating tumor cells or
cell-free plasma DNA can be detected in venous peripheral
blood and tested for the presence of common mutations.3
Cell-free tumor DNA can also be detected in buccal

 epithelium, saliva, urine, stools, and bronchial aspirates.4 Such
DNA has been used to detect mutations in patients with both
localized and metastatic cancers.5 Moreover, somatic muta-
tions in ovarian and endometrial cancers can potentially be
detected using Papanicolaou specimens.6
In addition to genetic mutations, epigenetic markers are
emerging as tools with discriminatory power for disease detec-
tion. For example, DNA methylation is a robust epigenetic
marker for which a number of commercially available tests have
been developed. These tests detect tissue-specific DNA
methylation using clinical specimens and are used in colorectal
cancer (SEPT9, blood; VIM, stool), lung cancer (SHOX2,
bronchial fluid), and brain cancer (MGMT, tumor).7 One
advantage of this approach is marker stability under common
storage conditions.4 However, despite DNA methylation’s
potential as a diagnostic marker, a general lack of consensus on
the methods remains. This is the principal reason for its slow
implementation in clinical diagnostics.4,7
Previously, our laboratory reported a pan-cancer hyper-
methylation signal around a CpG island near human ZNF154.8
This signal was initially detected by us in ovarian and endo-
metrial cancers and replicated by us in multiple, independent
cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), incorpo-
rating a total of 15 distinct tumor collections from 13 different
organs with almost 6000 samples.8 These previous analyses
relied on data generated from Illumina Infinium methylation
arrays (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) to detect the methylation
levels at select CpG sites. In this study, we measure the
ZNF154 methylation signal across five tumor types using
bisulfite amplicon sequencing. With this method, individual
sequence reads are used to quantitate methylation levels of all
CpGs within the amplicon while providing quantitative data
for each DNA molecule in the pooled sample. Furthermore,
the approach provides an intrinsic measure of quality control
by tracking bisulfite conversion efficiency at cytosines in the
non-CpG context wherein extensive amounts of unconverted
cytosines signal an incomplete conversion reaction. This
procedure is both time efficient and cost-effective because
multiple samples can be sequenced in parallel using a 96-well
plate and, as we report, generate reproducible measurements
when assayed in independent experiments. The amplicon
sequencing provides greater resolution of a target region than a
methylation array by covering all amplified CpGs, revealing
patterns of DNA methylation useful for distinguishing tumor
from normal samples.
We report that the magnitude and reproducibility of the
ZNF154 hypermethylation signal across five solid tumor
types reinforces the potential of this site as a biomarker for
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Next, we assess the
potential application of various computational data clas-
sification methods toward cancer screening. By investi-
gating a variety of technical approaches to characterize
methylated bases within the sequenced samples, we iden-
tify features useful for distinguishing tumor samples from
normal samples. Finally, we use a computational simula-
tion to demonstrate the utility of these features in
classifying samples as tumor or normal tissue at various
abundance levels; here, tumor DNA methylation patterns
are compiled into a background of normal DNA methyl-
ation patterns, at limiting dilution levels, mimicking the
fractions at which ctDNA is recovered from blood.
Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation
GM12878 and K562 Cell Lines
GM12878 is a lymphoblastoid cell line with a relatively
normal karyotype and low DNA methylation levels. It was
obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research
(catalog no. GM12878; Camden, NJ). K562 is an immor-
talized chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line. It has high
methylation levels compared with GM128788 and was
obtained from the ATCC (catalog no. CCL-243; Manassas,
VA). Genomic DNA from GM12878 cells and K562 cells
was harvested in triplicate using the QiaAmp DNA Mini Kit
(catalog no. 51304), and DNA from each replicate was
serially diluted to 100, 50, and 20 ng of total starting ma-
terial, in duplicate (thus yielding 18 replicate samples per
cell line). During the bisulfite conversion step, nine samples
failed, wherein six were generated from the 100-ng
dilutions.
Gynecologic Samples
The Cooperative Human Tissue Network, funded by the
National Cancer Institute, provided eight normal endometrial
tissue samples. DNA was extracted using the QiaAmp DNA
Mini Kit (catalog no. 51304; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), DNA
quality was assessed using the 260:280 ratio measured with a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and DNA was quantified with
a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Samples
consisted of atrophic endometrium obtained from routine
hysterectomy or pelvic resection for nonendometrial cancers in
postmenopausal individuals. In addition, 42 endometrial tumor
samples were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue
Network. They included 20 endometrioid carcinomas (EECs),
11 serous tumors, and 11 clear cell tumors. Tissues were snap
frozen after surgery and stored at �80�C. Genomic DNA was
isolated using the Puregene Blood Kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. DNA quality and concentration
were assessed using a SmartSpec Plus spectrophotometer
(BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Lung, Stomach, Colon, and Breast Tumor Panels
We purchased 96-well plates that contained genomic DNA
from tumor and normal samples for each tumor type from
Amsbio (Cambridge, MA). Normal DNA was obtained from
pathologically normal donors; samples were not isolated
from normal adjacent tissues from donors with tumors. Amsbio
extracted genomic DNA from a variety of frozen tissues using a
modified guanidine thiocyanate technique and dissolved it in
1� TE buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmol/L EDTA).
Margolin et al

jmd.amjpathol.org - The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics
 Each plate contained 40 tumor samples and eight normal tissue
samples in technical duplicates. Each well contained 5 mL of
genomic DNA at approximately 4 ng/mL, yielding 20 � 3 ng of
genomic DNA per sample (mean � SD).
Methylation Analysis
Each dilution of genomic DNA was bisulfite converted with
the EZ DNA Methylation-Direct Kit (catalog no. D5020 for
a single sample or D5023 for the plate; Zymo Research,
Irvine, GA), PCR amplified, and sequenced.
Human Methylation Array
Gynecologic samples were analyzed with the Human-
Methylation27 Illumina BeadChip. The hybridization
reaction was performed according to the manufacturer
protocol, and samples were scanned using the Illumina
iScan System.
Amplicon Generation
To generate a 302-bp PCR product from ZNF154, we used
forward (50-GGTTTTTATTTTAGGTTTGA-30) and reverse
(50-AAATCTATAAAAACTACATTACCTAAAATACTC-
TA-30) primers. The primers contained different adapters at
their 50 ends: forward adapter: 50-ACACTCTTTCCCTAC-
ACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-30, reverse adapter: 50-GTG-
ACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-30. The
primer design assumed all non-CpG Cs are converted with
sodium bisulfite to Ts. The primers annealed to regions in the
genomic DNA sequence devoid of any cytosines in a CpG
context. PCR reactions contained 0.25 mL of 5-U/mL TaKaRa
EpiTaq HS DNA Polymerase (for bisulfite-treated DNA)
with 10� EpiTaq PCR Buffer, 5 mL of 25 mmol/L MgCl2,
6 mL of 2.5 mmol/L dNTP mix (catalog no. R110A;
TaKaRa Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan), and 1 mL each primer at
12.5 mmol/L in 50-mL total volume. Cycling conditions
were 95�C for 10 minutes, 45 cycles of 95�C for 30 sec-
onds, 48�C for 30 seconds, and 72�C for 60 seconds, and
72�C for a 7-minute final extension. PCR products were
verified by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel.
After PCR, one or two rounds of product cleanup were
performed by adding 37.5 mL of Agencourt Ampure XP
PCR Purification Beads [catalog no. A63881; Beckman
Coulter Genomics (formerly Agencourt), Danvers, MA]
to the 50-mL PCR mixture. PCR products were verified by
electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Following cleanup,
barcodes (Illumina Amplicon Indexing Oligos) were
added in a second round of PCR, using 25 mL of 2�
Phusion Master Mix (catalog no. M0531L; New England
Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA) and 1 mL each bar-coded
primer at 25 mmol/L in 50-mL total volume. Cycling
conditions were 98�C for 30 seconds, 8 cycles of 98�C for
10 seconds, 65�C for 30 seconds, and 72�C for 30 sec-
onds, and 72�C for a 5-minute final extension. A final
round of XP PCR purification bead cleanup was applied,
as before, to remove excess bar-coding oligonucleotides.
Amplicon Sequencing
PCR products were sequenced at the NIH Intramural
Sequencing Center using the Illumina MiSeq platform with
reagent kit version 3 (Illumina Inc.) to generate paired-end,
300-bp reads (200 bp for the lung plate). Briefly, agarose gel
analysis was performed for each well in the 96-well
amplicon plate. On the basis of the intensity of the prod-
uct bands, the relative concentration of each sample was
estimated. Using these values, a pool was created that
adjusted for relative differences. The concentration of this
pool was determined using the Illumina/Universal Library
Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc., Wilmington,
MA). An aliquot of the pool was run on a MiSeq (Illumina
Inc.) using a MiSeq Reagent Nano kit version 3. This
quality control run consisted of 25 cycles followed by a
6-cycle index read, which provided an accurate profile of the
representation of the samples in the pool. If necessary, an
additional volume of poorly represented amplicons was
added to the pool. The final pool was then sequenced on the
MiSeq. Both MiSeq runs were spiked with a PhiX control
library to improve base diversity. The PhiX library typically
accounted for 30% to 50% of reads. Postrun processing of
data were performed using RTA version 1.18.42 and
CASAVA software version 1.8.2 (Illumina Inc.).
Presentation of Changes in Methylation
We report methylation levels in percentages or fractions
(percentage per 100). Importantly, to avoid possible confusion,
when we note a methylation difference of X%, we refer to an
absolute difference of X units (0 to 100), not a relative X%
change from the current methylation level. For example, if the
reference methylation level is 30%, then a 10% difference
from the reference level indicates 20% or 40% methylation,
not 27% or 33%.
Alignment of Sequencing Data
We have observed that base quality deteriorates substan-
tially in the second half of the paired-end sequence reads,
especially the second reads. Therefore, because the reads
were expected to overlap, we adjoined the first 200 bp from
the first read to the first 102 bp from the second read (after
reverse complementation) to produce single fragments of
the expected 302-bp length.
We aligned the resulting full-length fragments to the human
genome version GRCh37/hg19 using Bismark version 0.7.12.9
This procedure filtered out nonaligning reads and returned the
number of aligned reads and methylation levels at each C,
including each of the 20 CpGs in the amplicon and cytosines
in non-CpG contexts, and mean methylation across each
sample in CpG, CHG, and CHH contexts (where H represents
A, C, or T). Non-CpG methylation was used as an internal
upper-bound estimate of the inefficiency of bisulfite conver-
sion because little appreciable cytosine methylation occurs
outside CpG dinucleotides. Moreover, the alignment files
contained the patterns of methylated bases within individual
sequence reads.
ZNF154 Methylation Analysis and Modeling
The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics - jmd.amjpathol.org
285
 The mapping efficiency (ie, the percentage of reads
aligned to the genome out of total sequenced reads) varied
from 0% to 89% (median, 18%) across sample replicates.
Most, if not all, of the unaligned reads show clear primer
dimer signatures, such as repeated forward and/or reverse
primer and adaptor sequences, and typical poly-A artifactual
base calls extending beyond the actual fragment size. These
fragments were the most likely cause of the additional lower
bands observed on our agarose gels; however, genomic
alignment effectively filters them from the analysis.
The fraction of cytosine nonconversion in non-CpG
contexts calculated by the Bismark application is, in
fact, an underestimate because it takes into account the
cytosines in the primer regions, which are expected to
be always converted due to primer design (the primers
hybridize only to Cs that are converted to uracil). To
directly
estimate
nonconversion
percentages
in
the
aligned reads, we examined the Cs in a CHG and CHH
context. The 302-bp ZNF154 amplicon contains 14 Cs
in a CHG context (two within each of the primer re-
gions and 10 between) and 59 Cs in a CHH context
(six and four within the forward and reverse primers,
respectively, and 49 between). Therefore, Bismark es-
timates were corrected by factors of 14/10 Z 1.40 and
59/49 Z 1.20 for CHG and CHH contexts, respectively.
Indeed, when we directly analyzed nonconversion per-
centages
in
the
aligned
reads,
excluding
cytosines
within primer regions, the slopes in linear regressions
of our direct estimates versus Bismark estimates closely
agreed with these factors: 1.35 and 1.22 for CHG and
CHH contexts, respectively.
We use the nonconversion percentage in non-CpG
context as an upper limit of the inefficiency of sodium
bisulfite treatment. Assuming a similar effect at all cyto-
sines, we can correct the reported CpG methylation levels.
In this way, we calculate a true percentage of methylation
CpG as mt Z 100 (mo � e)/(100 � e), where mo is the
observed percentage of mCpG, and e is the nonconversion
percentage of unmethylated cytosines. Hence, the differ-
ence between the observed and true levels is mo � mt Z
(100 � mo) e/(100 � e).
Taking the maximum of the four estimates of non-CpG
methylation/nonconversion for each sample as e (ie, two direct
estimates for CHG and CHH contexts, as described above, and
two estimates from Bismark), the median correction in per-
centage of mCpG, or the median of mo � mt, was 0.4, and the
maximum was 2.8 (on a scale of 0 to 100). Given such a small
effect, we kept the uncorrected values.
Sample Reproducibility
Comparison of sample duplicates in the four 96-well
tumor plates revealed that duplicates with >1000 aligned
reads closely agreed, in accord with recent reports.10
However, two outlier samples on the colon plate had
duplicate methylation signals of 60% and 20% (with
>1000 aligned reads in each duplicate), indicating that
duplicates from the two samples had been inadvertently
swapped. These samples were removed from the analysis.
To maximize the number of samples retained for further
analysis, we summed reads from both duplicates for each
sample. A sample was retained if there were >1000
aligned reads in total unless the following two conditions
occurred: each duplicate had >250 aligned reads, and
mean CpG methylation differed by >0.2 (20%) between
duplicates. The last condition excluded the two suspicious
colon samples (but nothing else).
Analysis of Clinical Data
Most postalignment analysis was performed using the R
language for statistical computing version 3.1.1 (http://www.
r-project.org).11We used analysis of variance (R functions lm
and anova) to regress mean sample methylation on age, sex,
and tumor diagnosis (subtype and differentiation level or
grade). We used both a full and shortened version of diag-
nostic data; the shortened version excluded tumor differenti-
ation levels (not available for stomach) and produced fewer
categories, with larger sample sizes. We used single-term
deletions in the model (R function drop1) to estimate the
significance of these predictors; there were no interaction
terms in the model.
Extraction of Sequencing Read Methylation Patterns
Most aligned reads (approximately 99.5%) had the expected
starting coordinate (chr19:58220404); most of the rest
aligned to neighboring bases, with several single-occurrence
exceptions. Only reads with 20 CpGs (based on Bismark
context calls) that were aligned to the expected starting
coordinate were retained, yielding 93% to 98% (median,
96%) of the aligned reads reported by Bismark application.
This finding is consistent with a Phred base quality score of
approximately 30 (ie, a base call error rate of 0.001). The 20
CpGs translate to 40 bases that can be miscalled, which
occur at rates of approximately 0.04, or 4%, of aligned
reads. Comparing mean sample methylation between the
values reported by Bismark and those based only on the
reads we retained, the maximal absolute difference was
negligible, 0.6% or 0.006 (the median absolute difference
was only 0.13%).
Hierarchical Clustering of Samples Based on the Most
Abundant Patterns
The 1000 most frequent methylation patterns in each sample
were kept, with their union yielding 57,926 distinct patterns.
The union of the 30 most abundant patterns in normal and
30 most abundant patterns in tumor samples yielded 45
distinct patterns that were used in hierarchical clustering.
Selection of the most abundant patterns was based on
ranking the means of the pattern fractions across tumor and
normal tissue samples. On average, at least twice as many
single-C read patterns were observed in normal samples
than were expected from our estimates of inefficient sodium
bisulfite conversion of fully unmethylated reads (P < 10�6,
Margolin et al
286
jmd.amjpathol.org - The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics
 Wilcoxon signed-rank test), arguing that the single-C pat-
terns are likely to be real events and not artifacts of
incomplete conversion.
The fractions of these 45 patterns across 218 samples
were log-transformed after replacing any fractions with a
value of zero with values represented by one-tenth the
minimal nonzero value for that pattern across all sam-
ples. To perform hierarchical clustering, we used the R
functions heatmap.2 (package gplots) and hclust (pack-
age stats) with the ward.D2 agglomerative clustering
method and Euclidean distance. Because the data were
log-transformed, distance was based on fold changes in
pattern fractions.
Calculation of Read Fractions with k Methylated CpGs
As stated previously, only sequence reads with 20 CpGs
(based on Bismark context calls) that aligned to the starting
coordinate chr19:58220404 were retained. In each sample,
sequence reads with equal numbers of methylated CpGs (0
to 20; ie, values of k), were counted together in the read
fractions (nk). The sum of all nk was normalized to 1. Using
the set of nk, we defined the following ratios:
x Z n20/(n0 þ n20),
(1)
yZn20=ðn20 þ P5
kZ0nkÞ;
(2)
and z Z (n19 þ n20)/(n0 þ n19 þ n20).
(3)
Note that the mean mCpG fraction per sample can be
calculated as follows:
mZðP20
kZ0knkÞ=ð20P20
kZ0nkÞ.
(4)
ROC Curve Classification
We used the R package pROC to calculate area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) CIs
(using the default deLong method12). We used the R
package ROCR for convex hull calculation.13,14 The P
value for the AUC was obtained from a Wilcoxon rank
sum test evaluating the hypothesis that the distribution of
the ranks in the two groups (normal tissue and tumor
samples) is equal (if this hypothesis is correct, the AUC
should be 0.5).
Dilution Simulations
We randomly matched one of the 34 normal samples, Nj, to each
tumor, Ti, of the 184 tumor samples and mixed the two sample
signals together at a chosen fraction, f, yielding an in silico
diluted tumor value, Dij, where Dij Z (1�f ) � Ti þ f � Nj.
Each Ti was randomly matched with one of the normal
tissue samples 100 times, resulting in a set of 18,400 in silico
tumor DNA dilutions. All Ti’s and Nj’s were represented as
vectors containing normalized frequencies nk of aligned reads
with given numbers of methylated CpGs (k between 0 and 20)
and methylation levels at each of the 20 CpGs. The fraction, f,
of normal signal in the mixture ranged from 0.1 to 0.99, with
intermediate values of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9,
0.925, 0.95, and 0.975. In the ROC analysis, each dilution
level (or f ) was analyzed individually.
Machine Learning Classification
We applied k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector
machine (SVM) algorithms, using the three alternative
sample representations: i) methylation values at each of
the 20 individual CpGs, ii) the 45 most recurrent pattern
frequencies, and iii) frequencies of groups of patterns nk
with k methylated CpGs (0 � k � 20). For our compu-
tationally diluted data sets we used only the first and third
representations.
Each representation was used as is or log-transformed.
To avoid infinities due to log (0) in the latter case, we
tried three alternative thresholds, e Z {1e�5, 1e�3, 0.1},
and the data were transformed as log(data þ e). To
implement KNN algorithms, we used the knn.cv function
from the R package class, with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 nearest
neighbors; even numbers were omitted to avoid randomly
resolved draws. To implement SVM, we used the svm
function from R package e1071 and wrote a wrapper code
to perform the leave-one-out cross-validation. We set the
svm parameter class.weights as inversely proportional to
the class sizes used in training, with the mean set to 1, and
used five alternative cost values: 0.1, 1, 10, 100, or 1000.
Other parameters were assigned the default values; for
example, we used radial kernel.
Results
Regional Assessment of ZNF154 DNA Methylation
Our previous analysis of DNA methylation data in TCGA
cohorts revealed that the ZNF154 transcription start site (TSS)
is hypermethylated in 15 different solid epithelial tumor types
compared with baseline methylation in normal tissue.8
Although all available probe sites from the Illumina 450 k
Infinium methylation array were examined, the sparsity of
probes across the ZNF154 locus prohibited analysis of the
breadth of the hypermethylated region (HMR). We could only
estimate that the HMR was between approximately 750 and
11,700 bp long. However, whole genome bisulfite sequencing
data from matched tumor and normal colorectal tissue pub-
lished in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo; accession number GSE46644) displayed a 1.5- to
2.0-kb region of tumor hypermethylation that centered around
the ZNF154 TSS (Figure 1A), and other samples showed a
similar HMR as well.15,16 On the basis of these data, we
designed a 302-bp PCR amplicon to cover a part of the
ZNF154 HMR we identified,8 including the TSS and part of
the associated CpG island (Figure 1, B and C). This 20-CpG
amplicon is positioned centrally in the tumor-specific HMR,

 which should be optimal for distinguishing tumor from normal
samples.
Validation of Bisulfite Amplicon Sequencing
Reproducibility Using Cell Line DNA
The harsh conditions imposed by sodium bisulfite treatment
cause fragmentation and damage to DNA molecules, sug-
gesting that repeated sampling from very low quantities of
DNA could give variable results when drawn from the same
starting material. Therefore, we assessed the technical vari-
ability of our PCR amplification method by sampling ampli-
fiable DNA molecules at very low amounts, simulating the
amplification of low-copy-number tumor DNA fragments.17
For this purpose, we sampled genomic DNA at 20, 50, and
100 ng (in duplicate) from three replicate culture flasks of the
tumor-derived cell line K562 and the non-tumor cell line
GM12878. We treated each sample with bisulfite, generated
PCR amplicons, added barcodes, and sequenced the products
on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence reads were aligned
to a converted human genomic reference at the target locus
(hg19, chr19:58220404e58220705) using the tool Bismark.9
For GM12878, 16 samples yielded aligned reads totaling
1276 to 120,500 reads per sample at the amplicon locus with a
median of 23,460. For K562, 11 samples yielded aligned
reads, with 1796 to 237,900 reads per sample and a median
number of 26,480 (see Materials and Methods).
For both cell lines, MiSeq sequencing data across replicates
from different starting DNA concentrations revealed robust
methylation signals with minimal variation (Figure 2). The
consensus profiles of methylation at each CpG emerged from
overlap of 15 of the 16 GM12878 replicates and 10 of the 11
K562 replicates. Notably, for each cell line, one replicate fell
out of the consensus profile. Excluding these outlier samples,
the mean percentage of mCpG for K562 cells was 40.7%
compared with 10.1% for GM12878. The SD of the per-
centage of mCpG at each of the 20 CpG dinucleotides was
small, ranging from 0.5% to 3.4% for GM12878 and 0.6% to
3.8% for K562. Moreover, the methylation trends were similar
to those observed in the Illumina array methylation data
generated by the ENCODE Consortium for K562 and
GM12878 at four probes in the same region (Figure 2).
Thus, methylation at ZNF154 discriminates a tumor-derived
cell line, K562, from a nontumor cell line, GM12878, derived
from the transformation of phenotypically normal human
lymphoblasts (P Z 2 � 10�5, Wilcoxon rank sum test,
including the outliers). Using as little as 20 ng of genomic
DNA, bisulfite amplicon sequencing produced reproducible
data with minimal deviation (approximately 2%) in methyl-
ation signal between technical replicates. Importantly, we
conclude that the use of technical replicates helps to filter
unreliable measurements.

 locus in genomic DNA extracted from eight normal endo-
metrial samples and 42 endometrial tumors, comprising a
collection of 20 EEC, 11 serous tumors, and 11 clear cell
tumors.
A single technical replicate of each tumor sample was
assessed, and samples with at least 1000 aligned reads were
considered (excluding only one low-grade EEC sample with
402 aligned reads). By averaging the signal across the
amplicon, we found that tumors had a 66% increase in
median
methylation
levels
relative
to
normal
tissue
(P Z 2 � 10�5, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Figure 3A). All
tumor stages were hypermethylated relative to normal tissue
(P � 0.01, t-test). Stage IV tumors (one serous and one clear
cell sample) were hypermethylated relative to each of the
lower stages (P � 0.05, t-test) (Supplemental Figure S1);
however,
no
significant
methylation
differences
were
observed among endometrioid, serous, and clear cell tumor
subtypes at this locus.
We compared Illumina methylation array data to bisulfite
sequencing data generated from these same samples and
found that the two array probes overlapping the amplicon
produced consistent results with the bisulfite sequence data
(Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.96 and 0.97 and mean
differences of 5.7% and 3.9%) (Figure 3B and Supplemental
Figure S2). The agreement between the sequencing and
array methylation values was strongest at very high
methylation levels (>80% mCpG) and more variable at
lower methylation levels (<40% mCpG). One advantage of
amplicon sequencing is the ability to assess bisulfite con-
version of unmethylated cytosines within the amplicon,
where incomplete conversion creates a false-positive signal
for methylation. We examined all Cs in non-CpG contexts
in our endometrial samples and found minimal non-
conversion (between 0.3% and 6.4% unconverted Cs at non-
CpG positions, with a median of 2.6%).
We observed several additional characteristics in the
sequencing data. For example, a slight decrease in median
methylation occurred in tumors across four CpGs that sur-
round the TSS (chr19:58220579) (Figure 3A), suggesting
that this area is more resistant to DNA methylation than
surrounding regions. In addition, the variability in percent-
age of methylation across samples was greater at each CpG
position in tumors than in normal tissue. The low variance
in normal samples was expected because of their lowered
heterogeneity compared with tumor samples. Finally, some
tumor samples had lower methylation levels than some
normal tissue samples (Figure 3A), with low percentage of
mCpG, which is consistent with reports from TCGA that
some tumors lack DNA hypermethylation profiles.18 How-
ever, all tumor samples had mean methylation levels higher

 than the median level of the normal samples. Taken
together, these data confirm that methylation levels at the
ZNF154 amplicon separate most uterine tumor samples
from normal samples.
Methylation Measurements in Lung, Stomach, Colon,
and Breast Tumors and Normal Tissues
Next, we assessed DNA methylation in lung, stomach, colon,
and breast tumor panels, each with 40 tumor and eight normal
tissue samples. All samples were examined in duplicate to
estimate measurement accuracy. As with our analysis of
endometrial cancer, we used samples that had >1000 aligned
sequenced reads, resulting in informative sample sizes of 46 for
lung cancer (40 tumor and six normal tissue samples), 40 for
stomach cancer (34 tumor and six normal tissue samples), 36
for colon cancer (30 tumor and six normal tissue samples), and
47 for breast cancer (39 tumor and eight normal tissue samples).
In each of these data sets, the mean methylation within the
amplicon region was greater in tumors than in normal tissue.
The median percentage of mCpG in normal samples was
20%, 8%, 19%, and 4% for lung, stomach, colon, and breast
tissue, respectively. In comparison, stomach and breast
tumors had 20% and 31% increases in median methylation
relative to corresponding normal tissue (P Z 3.0 � 10�4
and P Z 2.1 � 10�4, respectively; Wilcoxon rank sum test)
(Figure 4A). Colon and lung tissue had greater increases of
44% and 45%, respectively (P Z 3.9 � 10�4 and
P Z 4.1 � 10�6, respectively; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
Thus, the four tumor types were consistently hyper-
methylated at this locus compared with normal samples. The
large magnitude of this hypermethylation bodes well for a
strong discriminant in each tissue type. Methylation mea-
surements between duplicates with >1000 aligned reads were
consistent (Figure 4B), and the replicate data strongly
correlated (Pearson correlation coefficients, �0.966).

 The characteristics associated with these tumor data were
consistent with our previous findings. For example, the me-
dian methylation around the ZNF154 TSS (chr19:58220579)
revealed a decrease with higher methylation levels at the CpG
sites to the left and to the right. Variance was also greater in
tumor samples than normal tissue samples. Moreover, the
four tumor types included a subset of samples with methyl-
ation levels comparable to or below that observed for normal

 tissue samples. One tumor sample in each of the lung,
stomach, and colon collections and three in the breast
collection had mean methylation levels below the median of
their respective normal tissues. This finding is consistent with
TCGA reports of tumor samples that do not reveal aberrant
DNA methylation.8,18 We also performed quality control
assessment of the samples and concluded that nonconversion
rates of cytosines to thymines in all non-CpG contexts were
extremely low, indicating that the false methylation rate was
low (between 0.2% and 1.2%, all medians �0.6%).
Each tumor panel in our analysis provided information on
tumor subtype and relative grade (differentiation level), as well
as patient age and sex. Using linear regression, we assessed
whether mean methylation was predicted by subtype (with or
without grade), age, or sex. All tumor types were hyper-
methylated compared with normal tissue samples (P < 0.05)
(Supplemental Figure S3). However, no statistically significant
differences appeared between tumor subtypes, after correcting
for age and sex. Sex was associated with methylation levels in
stomach and colon tumors (where males tended to have
lower and higher methylation, respectively, than females)
(Supplemental Figure S4), with marginally significant P values
(0.055 for stomach and 0.051/0.016 for colon, using subtype
andgrade/subtype).Despitethesmallsamplesizesforsubtypes
and stages, we found some differences when comparing me-
dian methylation levels. For example, in lung, small cell car-
cinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas seemed to have 15%
greater median methylation than adenocarcinomas and bron-
chioalveolar carcinomas (although not reaching statistical
significance at P Z 0.23, t-test). Moreover, we found 25%
greater median methylation in colon and lung adenocarci-
nomas relative to stomach adenocarcinomas (P < 0.02, t-test).
Adenocarcinomas represented a large proportion of the
subtypes in the endometrial (41/41), lung (11/40), stomach
(31/34), colon (30/30), and breast (39/39) tumors. This is not
surprising because adenocarcinoma is the most commonly
diagnosed tumor subtype for each of these tissues.19e22 When
analyzing only adenocarcinomas, tumors had a mean of 30%
hypermethylation in the lung and colon tumors relative to
normal tissue and >20% in breast and stomach tumors relative
to normal. In lung tissue, squamous cell and small cell
carcinomas are associated with a history of tobacco use23 and
are considered aggressive tumors; they found even higher
median methylation levels in our data set. Breast tumors in our
study were predominantly represented by invasive ductal
carcinomas (33/39), which have a median methylation level of
34% compared with just 4% in normal breast tissue.
Classification of Tumor and Normal Samples Using
Methylation Patterns
To evaluate the ZNF154 CpG island (CGI) as a pan-cancer
marker for detecting tumors, we pooled the data from endo-
metrial,colon,stomach,lung,andbreasttissuesamples,givinga
total of 34 normal and 184 tumor samples. We examined pat-
terns of methylation and compared their frequencies between
tumor and normal samples. Next, we assessed the performance
of various approaches for classifying samples as either tumor or
normal based on these pattern frequencies.
We began by recording the position of each methylated
CpG in each aligned read for every sample. The 20 CpG
positions in our amplicon provided 220 or >1,000,000
possible methylation patterns. Each pattern was represented
as a string of 20 characters encoding the methylation state of
each CpG in the amplicon as either methylated or unme-
thylated. We identified the 30 most frequent patterns across
normal samples and the 30 most frequent patterns across
tumors. Counting the 15 patterns common to both groups,
the union yielded 45 distinct patterns. These patterns fell
into two main categories: those with 0 or 1 methylated CpGs
and those with high numbers of methylated CpGs (18, 19, or
20). The low-methylation reads were frequent in both
normal and tumor samples, whereas the high-methylation
reads were primarily present in tumors (Figure 5A).
Initially, each sample was categorized as a tumor or
normal sample using this set of 45 patterns. In unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of samples (Figure 5B), we desig-
nated the left topmost branch as negative or normal sample
classification and the right branch as positive or tumor
sample classification. The true-positive rate of classification
was 81%, with a false-positive rate of 6%.

 Alternatively,
we
binned
all
possible
methylation
patterns by the total number of methylated CpGs per
read. With exactly 0 to 20 methylated CpGs, each
aligned read was placed into one of 21 possible groups.
We then used the normalized frequencies of aligned
reads in these groups to classify tumors. Their distri-
bution across normal and tumor samples is shown in
Figure 6. In normal samples, approximately half of
aligned reads were not methylated (Figure 6A), and
most of the remaining reads contained <10 methylated
CpGs. However, there was a tiny fraction of completely
methylated reads (median, 0.04% of reads). In tumors
(Figure 6B), completely unmethylated reads were less
common, at 19%, and completely methylated reads
were much more common than in normal samples, at
15%. All 184 tumors had completely methylated reads.
Unfortunately, the presence of completely methylated
reads in at least a subset of normal samples prevented
classifying tumors simply based on the presence of
these reads.
Finally, the frequency of all or a subset of these
methylation pattern groups was used to classify each
sample. We created ratios defined by subsets of these
methylation pattern groups to assess the optimal classifi-
cation
approach
(see
Materials
and
Methods).
We
compared the classification performance of these ratios
with that of the mean methylation fraction per sample, m
(Figure 7A), using ROC curve analysis. This analysis
allows one to choose any desired specificity and sensi-
tivity represented along the curve. The two groups of
patterns that differed the most were fully unmethylated
and fully methylated reads. Focusing on just these two
groups, we defined a ratio, x, to distinguish tumor from
normal tissue samples (Figure 7B). In the absence of
partially methylated reads, x would represent the mean
methylation fraction per sample, becoming identical to m.
We also combined fully unmethylated reads with reads
with low methylation (five or fewer mCpGs) to define the
ratio, y (Figure 7C). Similarly, we combined fully meth-
ylated reads with reads with near complete methylation (at
19 CpGs) to define the ratio, z (Figure 7D). The three
ratios, x, y, and z, performed similarly, with AUCs be-
tween
0.946
and
0.959.
This
represents
marginal
improvement over the AUC value of 0.936 obtained using
m and indicates that the strongly discriminating signals
detected in tumor tissue can be classified using the mean
methylation level. Nevertheless, the same simplicity may
not apply to samples generated from circulating tumor
DNA where the tumor signal is likely to be diluted in a
background of nontumor signal.

 Simulation: Detection and Classification of Dilute
Tumor DNA in Blood
Given our robust detection of hypermethylation in solid
tumor surgical resections from different cancer types, we
investigated the clinical relevance of the ZNF154 CGI locus
as a pan-cancer marker in a blood-based screening. We
constructed a collection of in silico data designed to simulate
dilution experiments using the data set generated from 34
normal tissue and 184 tumor tissue samples from panels
comprising five tumor types. Briefly, each dilution sample
was generated by randomly and repeatedly matching each
tumor sample to a normal tissue sample, independent of
sample origins, and mixing their data together in a defined
ratio. We varied the fraction of normal signal in the mixture
from 0.1 (10%) to 0.99 (99%), balancing the tumor contri-
bution from 90% to 1% of the input methylation signal. Each
dilution level gave rise to a separate data set. We assumed that
the low methylation signal observed in our 34 normal tissue
samples was a suitable approximation of methylation that we
may observe in normal blood, in agreement with data from
methylation array studies (eg, Gene Expression Omnibus;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; data sets GSE64950 with
36 samples from six individuals and GSE55763 with 2711
samples from 2664 individuals).24 For example, the mean �
SD methylation of the four CpGs within the amplicon that are
also represented on the methylation arrays (Figure 2) was
12% � 7% in our normal tissue samples, comparable to
the BMIQ-normalized25 measurements of 10% � 5% and
6% � 3% in the GSE55763 and GSE64950 data sets,
respectively.

Simulation: distinguishing endometrial, colon, stomach, lung, and breast tumors from normal samples when tumor signal is diluted. The graphs
are arranged as in Figure 7. Tumor signal characteristics (gray CDFs) were simulated by mixing 1% tumor signal with 99% randomly picked normal signal.
Normal samples are the same as in Figure 7 (black CDFs). A: Diluted tumors were practically indistinguishable from normal samples when relying on m, with an
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.54. BeD: By contrast, the capacity for classification persisted over dilutions for the other
signal measures, x, y, and z (AUCs of 0.73, 0.75, and 0.63, from left to right). As an example of the use of the convex hull (gray off-diagonal line), C shows
an increase in the AUC from 0.75 to 0.79. CDF, cumulative distribution function; FPR, false-positive rate (ie, 1 � specificity); TPR, true-positive rate

 For each set of tumor dilutions, we performed the same
classification analysis as was performed for the original
tumor to normal comparison (Figure 7). The x and y ratios
yielded the highest AUC values for all dilution levels, from
0 (undiluted) to 99% (Figure 8). As shown in Figure 7, the
AUC for mean methylation, m, classification was just
slightly below that for other predictors when considering
undiluted samples. However, it deteriorated much faster
than the others with higher dilution levels. The y ratio,
which incorporates aligned reads with one to five methyl-
ated CpGs, performed slightly but consistently better than x,
which is based solely on fully methylated and fully unme-
thylated reads. In addition to x, y, and z, we also considered
a classification based on the fraction of fully methylated
read outs of all reads. This measure performed similar to z at
low dilutions, similar to x at intermediate dilutions, and
similar to y at higher dilutions (not shown).
At the dilution using 90% normal data, the ratios x and y
performed well, with AUCs of approximately 0.89, whereas
the AUC for the m-based ROC was much worse, at 0.68.
Even at the highest dilution considered, 99%, the x and y
ratios had substantial ability to discriminate between tumor
and normal samples, with AUCs of approximately 0.74
(P < 3 � 10�6, Wilcoxon rank sum test; 95% CI,
0.63e0.85) (Figure 9, B and C). At this dilution, the AUC
for the m-based ROC was only 0.54, near the value of
random guessing of 0.5 (P Z 0.42; 95% CI, 0.43e0.64)
(Figure 9A).
Finally, to estimate the classification capacity of our
approach for individual tumor types, we performed dilution
simulations similar to those described above but with only
one tumor type present at a time. We used the same, pooled
set of normal tissue samples in each case, as an approxi-
mation of normal blood and to maximize the selection
(Supplemental Figure S5). Endometrial and colon tumors
were the easiest to classify, with the best AUCs, >0.95, up
to 90% dilution. Breast tumors were the hardest to classify,
with all AUCs at <0.90. In lung tumors, the AUC based on
m (mean methylation) performed better than the alternatives
(x, y, and z) at up to 70% dilution, but it quickly degraded at
higher dilutions. We note that the results of our analysis that
pooled tumors of all types together (Figure 8) reflected the
relative numbers of samples of each type.
By modeling the data anticipated from blood samples,
in which the amplification of target ctDNA will be mixed
with target DNA from normal cells, we have explored
whether
our
methods
have
potential
for
clinical
di-
agnostics. Even when tumors contributed just 1% to the
total methylation signal, we could discriminate tumors
from normal tissue samples using specific methylation
patterns at the ZNF154 CGI, with an AUC of 0.74
(Figure 9, B and C). A mathematical technique, con-
structing a convex hull, can improve the ROC curve and
increase
the
AUC13,14;
this
somewhat
improved
our
classification performance to the AUC of 0.79 (Figure 9C
and Supplemental Figure S5).
Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning
In addition to the straightforward classification schemes
described above, we investigated how well we could distin-
guish tumors from normal tissue using KNN and SVM
algorithms. When we considered the solid tumor data
(Supplemental Figure S6), the performance of SVM using the
most abundant pattern frequencies was somewhat better than
hierarchical clustering performance (Figure 5B) using the
same data (ie, frequencies of the 45 most recurrent patterns).
Overall, however, KNN and SVM classification performance
was similar across the three alternative representations
(Supplemental Figure S6) and, moreover, similar to the per-
formance based on scalar predictors m, x, y, and z defined in
the main text (Figure 7). We also applied SVM and KNN
cross-validation to our computationally diluted data sets but
found no performance gain. For example, at 90% dilution,
SVM and KNN performance was at best comparable to that
of x- or y-based classification, whereas at 99% dilution the
SVM and KNN predictions were often worse than a random
guess (true-positive rate less than false-positive rate) or had
severe underfitting26 (Supplemental Figure S7).
Thus, we conclude that machine learning classifiers pro-
vide no additional benefit over approaches using simple
methylation ratios with respect to the classification of tumor
versus normal tissue using methylation around the ZNF154
CGI. The advantage of the scalar predictors m, x, y, and z is
that they are easy to interpret and work with, which cannot
be said about the machine learning algorithms, which
require much more validation and parameter selection.
Discussion
We used deep bisulfite sequencing to examine recurrent
hypermethylation around the ZNF154 TSS in five solid tumor
types: lung, stomach, colon, breast, and endometrium. We
confirmed that the ZNF154 amplicon region was significantly
hypermethylated in these tumor types relative to normal
samples. Furthermore, this hypermethylation occurred in most
tumors examined, regardless of subtype, stage of differentia-
tion, age, or sex. The discrimination between all tumor sub-
types and normal controls was most prominent in endometrial,
colon, and lung tissues (Supplemental Figures S1 and S3). We
did not have adequate sample sizes to thoroughly investigate
all subtype differences, except, perhaps, for endometrial tu-
mors, in which we have not observed differential methylation
among different subtypes. Therefore, further experimental
testing with greater sample sizes and different tumor types may
reveal associations between ZNF154 methylation and tumor
subtypes, novel epitypes, disease pathology, or targeted
therapies.
Given the reproducibility of hypermethylation across a
breadth of solid tumor types and the sensitivity detected in
our simulated dilutions, we predict that the ZNF154 amplicon
can distinguish ctDNA in a blood-based test. Although
ZNF154 Methylation Analysis and Modeling

295
 published studies have detected and assessed the fraction of
ctDNA based on mutations,27e29 mutation detection requires
specific knowledge about the patient’s mutation, and at this
time it is not always clear what levels of ctDNA should be
considered abnormal or warrant intervention.3,30e32 Further-
more, it is difficult to implement mutation testing in ctDNA
as a generalized diagnostic test for cancer because the mu-
tations are so varied. Presence of ctDNA has also been
detected and quantified using DNA hypermethylation.33
Consistent with this idea, we found that elevated methyl-
ation levels at ZNF154 appear to be prevalent across different
tumor types providing application as a generalized test while
potentially complementing ctDNA mutation testing applied
to specific cancer types.
Estimates of ctDNA amounts in blood vary widely, ranging
from fractions of a percent to most sample DNA.3,27e30,33 Our
computational simulation provides insight into how ZNF154
methylation analysis could be applied to blood samples. At a
simulated 90% dilution, in which the tumor contributes only
10% of DNA signal, classification performance was good,
with AUCs of 0.89 (Figure 8) (x and y ratios). Even a simu-
lated 99% dilution yielded an AUC of 0.79. Because different
tumor types have different hypermethylation levels and pro-
files, both relative to their normal tissue controls (Figures 3
and 4) and to the pooled normal tissues, we observed the
best performance of the potential ZNF154 biomarker for the
endometrial and colon tumors (Supplemental Figure S5).
Overall, our in silico dilution estimates suggest that hyper-
methylation of the ZNF154 CGI region should be robustly
detected as long as the ctDNA fraction is at or above single-
digit percentage levels. Such sensitivity should be adequate
to detect advanced cancer and some intermediate and early
tumors, depending on the tumor type.30 We note that our solid
tumor DNA samples may themselves be a mixture of tumor
and normal cells, introducing an inherent dilution to the tumor
methylation
signal
and
making
our
estimates
overly
conservative.
We considered our methylation detection relative to other
detection techniques. Currently, the predominant method used
in DNA methylation-based cancer diagnostics is methylation-
specific PCR (MSP), including its quantitative variants
(qMSP).7,31,32,34e40 The qMSP approach assumes that all
CpGs in the targeted locus are either fully methylated or
unmethylated and aims to quantify these two patterns. By
comparison, our classification approach based on the ratio x of
fully methylated reads to the sum of fully methylated and fully
unmethylated reads was among our best performers. When we
included partially methylated reads, only a modest improve-
ment occurred (Figure 8) (x is close to y), whereas including
near-completely methylated reads together with fully methyl-
ated reads led to decreased performance (Figure 8) (compare z
to x ratios). Of note, qMSP provides no way to avoid some
amplification of incompletely methylated reads together with
fully methylated reads. Moreover, an amplicon of 300 bp is
atypically long for MSP. As a proxy, when we discarded the
five rightmost CpGs in the amplicon and reanalyzed our data,
the
classification
performance
decreased
(Supplemental
Figure S8), indicating an advantage to using longer reads.
The largest decrease in classification, compared with the
analysis using all 20 CpGs, was observed at the highest
dilution (99%), with a top AUC of just 0.64; however, the
classification based on m (mean methylation) remained the
worst. Therefore, given all the considerations above, MSP
classification performance is likely to be lower than the
method described here. Furthermore, recent work comparing
different methods of DNA methylation measurement has
found that sequencing reveals better precision than qMSP.41
In the case of actual (nondiluted) solid tumors, a simple
classification based on mean mCpG (m) performed on par
with the ratio-based classifiers (x, y, and z), whereas for
diluted tumors the best classification performance was
achieved using combinations of frequencies of methylation
patterns of individual DNA fragments (using x or y).
Classification based on mean mCpG does not require such
detail, but it performs the worst (Figure 8). Because neither
arrays nor standard pyrosequencing (or Sanger sequencing)
generate the detailed data provided by bisulfite sequencing,
they will not provide optimal analyses. Likewise, other
groups using bisulfite amplicon sequencing did not quantify
methylation patterns of individual reads. This appears
problematic, given the random fragmentation of amplicons
generated there.10
Evaluation of ZNF154 methylation as a biomarker for
cancer will require direct measurement in body fluids using
the method described here. Given that plasma cell-free DNA
fragments average <300 bp, our amplicon size might need
optimization.3 Another factor that may potentially improve
tumor detection is having internal DNA standards to quan-
tify the DNA concentration.40 This information could be
used to quantify the number of fully methylated reads per
unit volume of blood, which may serve as an additional
discriminative tumor signature. Ultimately, assessment of
early- versus late-stage samples will reveal the range of
diagnostic potential provided by this locus. We note that our
analyses use a comparison of tumor to unmatched normal
tissue samples, which precludes assessment of elevated
methylation levels in premalignant tissues. Detection of
premalignant tissue might in fact be beneficial, although in
the context of a blood test we might see a hypermethylation
signal only if such DNA reaches the bloodstream. We also
note that we have not assessed tumor heterogeneity, which
could influence the median methylation levels we measure
in different tumor types.
In summary, bisulfite amplicon sequencing potentially
recovers all read patterns present in a sample, allowing a
more detailed analysis of methylation. With the use of this
approach, ZNF154 hypermethylation may represent a
pan-cancer biomarker for solid tumors and could poten-
tially be used to diagnose tumors through circulating
tumor DNA. A natural extension would then be tracking
the effectiveness of chemotherapy or tumor recurrence
using blood samples.
