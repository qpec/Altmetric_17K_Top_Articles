BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the source of advanced cancer patients’ information about their progno-
sis and determine whether this source of information could explain racial disparities in the accuracy of patients’ life expectancy esti-
mates (LEEs). METHODS: Coping With Cancer was a prospective, longitudinal, multisite study of terminally ill cancer patients
followed until death. In structured interviews, patients reported their LEEs and the sources of these estimates (ie, medical providers,
personal beliefs, religious beliefs, and other). The accuracy of LEEs was calculated through a comparison of patients’ self-reported
LEEs with their actual survival. RESULTS: The sample for this analysis included 229 patients: 31 black patients and 198 white patients.
Only 39.30% of the patients estimated their life expectancy within 12 months of their actual survival. Black patients were more likely to
have an inaccurate LEE than white patients. A minority of the sample (18.3%) reported that a medical provider was the source of their
LEEs; none of the black patients (0%) based their LEEs on a medical provider. Black race remained a significant predictor of an inaccu-
rate LEE, even after the analysis had been controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and the source of LEEs. CONCLUSIONS: The
majority of advanced cancer patients have an inaccurate understanding of their life expectancy. Black patients with advanced cancer
are more likely to have an inaccurate LEE than white patients. Medical providers are not the source of information for LEEs for
most advanced cancer patients and especially for black patients. The source of LEEs does not explain racial differences in LEE
accuracy. Additional research into the mechanisms underlying racial differences in prognostic understanding is needed. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Many advanced cancer patients lack an accurate understanding of their illness and prognosis.1,2 Advanced cancer patients
tend to underestimate the severity of their diagnosis,3,4 view their prognosis in overly positive and unrealistic terms,5-7 and
inaccurately believe that the goal of treatment is to cure their cancer.4,8 In recent studies of advanced cancer patients, fewer
than 20% had an accurate understanding of their prognosis.7,9,10
These misunderstandings are related to patients’ treatment decisions. Advanced cancer patients who do not recog-
nize that their illness is terminal are more likely to prefer11,12 and receive aggressive care at the end of life (EOL).5,6 They
are also less likely to discuss EOL care with their physicians,13 complete advance directives,7,13 receive care consistent with
their preferences,12 and receive hospice services.11 Patients’ estimates of their life expectancy are also related to their treat-
ment preferences. Advanced cancer patients who believe that they have at least a 90% chance of living 6 months or more
prefer life-extending care over palliative care at higher rates than patients with more realistic prognostic estimates (<90%
chance of living 6 months).5
Inaccurate illness understanding is particularly prevalent and problematic among black cancer patients. Despite similar
rates of EOL care discussions with providers,14 black patients are less likely to understand their illness and prognosis than
white patients.15 In addition, black patients are less likely to complete advance directives14-17 and receive hospice care17,18
and are more likely to receive aggressive EOL care14,18,19 and care inconsistent with their preferences14 than white patients.
Identifying factors that explain patients’ understanding of their illness may identify ways to reduce racial disparities
in advance care planning and EOL care. Numerous factors, including religious beliefs,17 care settings (rural vs urban),18

 socioeconomic status,18,20 and the effectiveness of EOL
care discussions, may contribute to black/white disparities
in illness and prognostic understanding.14 However, the
results of prior research are mixed.11,15,20 One unexa-
mined factor that may explain cancer patients’ misunder-
standing of their prognosis and racial differences in this
understanding is the patients’ source of information on
their prognosis. The purpose of this study was to examine
the source of advanced cancer patients’ information
on their prognosis and to determine whether the source of
this prognostic information explains racial disparities in
patients’ understanding of their prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Coping With Cancer is a National Cancer Institute– and
National Institute of Mental Health–funded prospective,
longitudinal, multisite study of terminally ill cancer
patients and their informal caregivers. Patients were
recruited from September 1, 2002 to February 28, 2008.
Patients in the current sample were recruited from outpa-
tient clinics at the Yale Cancer Center (New Haven,
Conn), the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare Sys-
tem Comprehensive Cancer Clinics (West Haven, Conn),
the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (Dallas,
Texas), the Parkland Hospital Palliative Care Service
(Dallas, Texas), the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Bos-
ton, Mass), Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston,
Mass), and New Hampshire Oncology-Hematology
(NHOH). Approval was obtained from the human sub-
jects committees of all participating centers; all enrolled
patients provided written consent and received $25 for
their participation.
The eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of meta-
static cancer, disease progression after first-line or later
chemotherapy, a life expectancy of 6 months or less as
determined by a member of the patient’s health care team,
a patient age of 21 years or older, adequate stamina to
complete study procedures, the presence of an informal
caregiver, the absence of significant cognitive impairment
in the patient and caregiver,21 and English or Spanish
proficiency.
Trained research staff conducted a structured inter-
view in English or Spanish with each patient at study
entry. Each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes.
Patients were followed until death or the study’s closure in
March 2010. For patients surviving beyond the closure of
their participating site, the date of death was obtained
from the National Death Index (the last death occurred in
December 2011). We lacked the necessary information to
conduct a National Death Index search for 99 patients;
these patients were excluded from these analyses.
Of the 993 eligible patients, 726 (73.1%) completed
the study measures. The most common reasons for non-
participation were a lack of interest (n 5 109), caregiver
refused (n 5 33), and being too upset (n 5 23). There
were no differences between participants and nonpartici-
pants except that participants were more likely to be
Hispanic (12.1% vs 5.8%, P 5 .005). However, for
the current analysis, only patients who identified as
non-Hispanic black or white were included.
Measures
Demographic and disease characteristics
Self-reported demographic characteristics included age, edu-
cation, sex, race, marital status, religious affiliation, and in-
surance status. Each patient’s cancer diagnosis was obtained
from a medical record review at the baseline. The Charlson
comorbidity index, the Karnofsky performance status, and
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance sta-
tus were obtained by trained research staff using a coding
process that was applied uniformly across all patients.
Self-reported life expectancy estimate
(LEE) and LEE source
The self-reported LEE was assessed with a single item:
“How long do you think you have left to live?” Patients
provided their responses in months and years. Participants
were then asked to indicate the source of their LEEs.
Response options included the following: oncologist,
other clinic staff, palliative care physician, patient’s perso-
nal belief, patient’s religious belief, and other. The oncol-
ogist, other clinic staff, and palliative care physician
response options were grouped into the single category of
medical provider.
Accuracy of LEEs
The accuracy of patients’ LEEs was calculated through a
comparison of patients’ self-reported LEEs with their
actual survival times. Each patient’s actual survival time
was based on the date of death. For patients who died
within the study observation period, the date of death was
collected from patients’ medical records. For patients who
survived the study observation period, the date of death
was obtained from the National Death Index. The accu-
racy of patients’ LEEs was assessed with 5 indicators: 1)
the proportion of patients (yes vs no) whose LEEs fell
within 3 months of their actual survival, 2) the proportion
of patients (yes vs no) whose LEEs fell within 6 months of
their actual survival, 3) the proportion of patients (yes vs

 no) whose LEEs fell within 12 months of their actual sur-
vival, 4) the proportion of patients (yes vs no) whose LEEs
differed by greater than 2 years from their actual survival,
and 5) the proportion of patients (yes vs no) whose LEEs
differed by greater than 5 years from their actual survival
Statistical Analysis
The relations between race and patient demographic and
disease characteristics were examined with the chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test for binary characteristics and with
the t test or Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous
characteristics. The relations between race and the accuracy
of patients’ LEEs and source of LEEs were examined with
logistic regression analyses and Fisher’s exact test. Finally,
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
used to examine the relation between race and the accuracy
of patients’ LEEs; we controlled for patient demographic
and disease characteristics and the source of LEEs. With a
forward selection model, demographic and disease charac-
teristics significantly associated with race were entered into
the models at a significance threshold of P < .2, and they
were retained in the final models if they were significant at
P < .05. All analyses were conducted with SAS software
(version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The final sample consisted of 229 patients: 198 white
patients (86.5%) and 31 black patients (13.5%). The
sample was 55% male with an average age of 60.1 years
(standard deviation, 12.4 y). White patients were older
(P 5 .03) with higher education levels (P < .001) and
were more likely to be married (P 5 .03) and insured
(P < .01). Black patients were less likely to be Catholic
(P < .001) and more likely to be Pentecostal (P 5 .02)
and Baptist (P 5 .004) than white patients. Black patients
were also less likely to be recruited from the Simmons
Comprehensive Cancer Center (P 5 .03), the Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute or Massachusetts General Hospital
(P 5 .01), and NHOH (P < .01) and were more likely to
be recruited from Parkland Hospital (P < .001) than
white patients (Table 1).
Race and Accuracy of LEEs
Only 11.79% of the sample patients accurately estimated
their life expectancy within 3 months of their actual sur-
vival (Table 2). Approximately one-quarter of the sample
(25.33%) accurately estimated life expectancy within 6
months of survival, and 39.30% accurately estimated it
within 12 months of survival. Furthermore, the LEEs of
43.67% of the sample differed from actual survival by
more than 2 years, and the LEEs of 27.95% differed by
more than 5 years.
White patients were more likely to accurately esti-
mate their survival within 12 months of their actual sur-
vival than black patients (Table 2; odds ratio [OR], 5.18;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75, 15.37; P 5 .003).
The LEEs of white patients were also less likely to differ
from their actual survival by 2 (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-
0.44; P < .001) and 5 years (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.07-
0.35; P < .001) than the LEEs of black patients. Only
12.90% of black patients’ LEEs were within 12 months of
their actual survival, 77.42% differed from their actual
survival by at least 2 years, and 64.52% differed by at least
5 years. Racial differences in LEE accuracy within 3 and 6
months of actual survival were not significant (P > .05).
Race and Source of LEEs
Less than one-fifth of the total sample (18.3%) reported
that a medical provider was the source of their LEEs. The
majority of the sample (70.7%) reported that they based
their LEEs on personal beliefs; 6.6% based their LEEs on
their religious beliefs. White patients were more likely to
base their LEEs on a medical provider than black patients
(P < .001; Table 3 and Figs. 1 and 2). Notably, none of
the black patients (0%) reported that a medical provider
was the source of their LEEs. Black patients were more
likely to base their LEEs on their religious beliefs than
white patients (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.13; P < .001).
Race and Source of LEEs in Predicting
LEE Accuracy
Race and the source of LEEs were not significantly associ-
ated with LEEs within 3 and 6 months of actual survival in
bivariate analyses (P > .05). Additional analyses predicting
these indicators of LEE accuracy were not conducted. In
univariate analyses predicting the LEE within 12 months of
actual survival (Table 4), patients who reported that their
medical provider was the source of their LEEs were almost
2.5 times more likely to have an accurate LEE than patients
who did not rely on a medical provider (OR, 2.44; 95%
CI, 1.24-4.83; P 5 .01). In multivariate analyses predicting
LEEs within 12 months of actual survival, patients who
were white (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.13-11.07; P 5 .03),
were not married (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28-0.98; P 5 .04),
and were recruited from NHOH (OR, 4.71; 95% CI,
2.48-8.94; P < .001) were more likely to have an accurate
LEE. The source of LEEs was not associated with LEE
accuracy in multivariate analyses.

 Patients whose LEEs were based on a medical pro-
vider were more than 2 times less likely to report an
LEE that differed by 2 years from actual survival than
patients who did not rely on a medical provider in
bivariate analyses (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.93; P 5
.03; data not shown). In multivariate analyses predict-
ing LEEs that differed by 2 years from actual survival,
black race (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.68; P < .01)
and personal belief as the sources of the LEE (OR,
2.42; 95% CI, 1.25-4.70; P < .01) were associated
with a greater likelihood of an inaccurate LEE. Patients
recruited at NHOH were also less likely to report an
inaccurate LEE in multivariate analyses (OR, 0.16;
95% CI, 0.08-0.35; P < .001),
In univariate analyses, patients who based their
LEEs on a medical provider were more than 3 times more
likely to have an accurate LEE than patients who did not
rely on a medical provider (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.78;
P 5 .02; data not shown). Basing the LEE on religious
beliefs was associated with a more than 4 times greater
likelihood of an LEE that differed by 5 years from actual
survival (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.48-12.74; P 5 .01). In
multivariate analyses, recruitment at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute/Massachusetts General Hospital (OR,
0.33; 95% CI, 0.11-0.94; P < .05) and NHOH (OR,
0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.29; P < .001) were associated with
a lower likelihood of an inaccurate LEE. In addition,
black race (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.94; P < .05) was
associated with a greater likelihood of an LEE greater than
actual survival by 5 years. Patients who based their LEEs
on a medical provider were more likely to have an accurate
LEE (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-0.91; P < .05).

 DISCUSSION
This study examined the source of black and white
advanced cancer patients’ information on their life expect-
ancy and the relation between race and the source and ac-
curacy of patients’ LEEs. The majority of the sample
reported inaccurate LEEs, and black patients were more
likely to have inaccurate LEEs than white patients. Less
than one-fifth of the patients reported basing their LEEs
on information from a medical provider. Black patients
were less likely to base their LEEs on medical providers
than white patients. In fact, no black patients reported
basing their LEEs on information from medical providers.
In univariate analyses, basing the LEE on a medical pro-
vider was associated with a more accurate LEE, whereas

 basing the LEE on religious beliefs was associated with a
less accurate LEE. However, racial differences in LEE
accuracy remained after we had controlled for the source of
LEEs. Black race was associated with a greater likelihood of
an inaccurate LEE after we had controlled for sociodemo-
graphic and disease characteristics and the source of LEEs.
The small proportion of patients who reported basing
their LEEs on information from their medical providers is
concerning. An advanced cancer patient’s life expectancy is
determined primarily by the characteristics of the patient’s dis-
ease and treatment response,22,23 and this is the expertise of
the medical team. However, patients are not basing their
LEEs on the source most able to provide accurate information.
This pattern may explain research indicating that advanced
cancer patients frequently do not understand the terminal na-
ture of their illness.5,6,9,11,15 These findings are problematic in
light of evidence that patients who overestimate their progno-
sis are less prepared for EOL and prefer and receive more
aggressive EOL care,5,11 which has been associated with
greater distress and worse quality of life and death for patients
and worse bereaved caregiver adjustment.24,25
Rather than relying on their medical providers, the
majority of both black and white patients in this study
reported basing their LEEs on their personal beliefs. Reli-
gious beliefs was an alternative response option for this
item; therefore, we can assume that these personal beliefs
are not religious in nature. Outside this, however, the
characteristics, content, and source of these beliefs are
unclear. Additional research is needed to understand the
nature of these beliefs.
Racial differences in the source of prognostic infor-
mation were striking. Notably, none of the black
patients reported basing their LEEs on information
from medical providers. This finding is concerning in
light of evidence that minority cancer patients are more
likely to receive aggressive care at the EOL than white
patients19 and are less likely to receive EOL care consist-
ent with their stated preferences.14,19 Black cancer
patients have less trust in the health care system and
medical providers than white patients.26,27 This mis-
trust may explain black patients’ tendency to rely on
other sources of information for their LEEs to a greater
degree than white patients. Furthermore, the majority
of oncologists are white28 and do not share the cultural
and educational background of their black patients;
this may affect communication29 and reduce patients’
willingness to rely on the information provided by their
medical providers.
Black patients were also more likely to base their
LEEs on their religious beliefs than white patients. Across
studies, racial minorities endorse higher levels of religios-
ity and greater use of religion to cope.27 This study adds

 to this body of work by suggesting that black patients also
rely on their religious beliefs to explain specific aspects of
their cancer. Integrating black patients’ religious beliefs
into patient-provider discussions of prognosis may be a
culturally sensitive strategy for improving patients’ under-
standing of prognostic information.
After we had controlled for sociodemographic char-
acteristics and the source of LEEs, race remained a signifi-
cant, albeit slightly weaker, predictor of LEE accuracy.
Black patients were 2 to 3 times less likely to have an accu-
rate LEE than white patients in adjusted analyses. These
findings indicate that the source of LEEs is important but
does not completely explain racial differences in prognos-
tic understanding. Racial categories place a single label on
complex cultural beliefs and values that vary across and
within racial groups. Because of this complexity, it is not
surprising that single indicators such as the source of LEEs
do not account for racial differences in prognostic under-
standing. However, the source of LEEs may be one factor
that contributes to racial differences in prognostic under-
standing. Furthermore, the relation between the source
and accuracy of LEEs in this study suggests that the source
of LEEs is an important factor to consider when we are
attempting to improve patients’ understanding of their
illness.
This study is limited by the small sample of black
patients and a cross-sectional design that does not allow
for an examination of changes in patients’ LEEs over
time. In addition, these results cannot be generalized to
patients with diseases other than advanced cancer and
patients of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Research
on patients with other terminal illnesses and patients from
different racial and ethnic backgrounds such as Hispanic
and Asian Americans will provide insight into strategies
for tailoring prognostic discussions to meet the unique
needs of a greater range of diverse patient populations.
Furthermore, because of the small number of patients
who reported basing their LEEs on palliative care physi-
cians and other clinic staff, we were unable to examine
differences in LEE accuracy across different medical pro-
viders. Future research that examines differences in LEE
accuracy across providers will provide insight into the
most effective source of this information for black and
white advanced cancer patients. Finally, the majority of
the sample patients overestimated their life expectancy. As
a result, we were unable to examine differences between
patients who overestimated their life expectancy and
patients who underestimated their life expectancy. Over-
estimation of life expectancy likely has different implica-
tions for patients’ psychosocial well-being, advance care
planning, and treatment decisions than underestimation.
Understanding predictors of overestimation versus under-
estimation, including racial and ethnic differences, will
provide a more detailed understanding of various ways in
which patients misunderstand their illness, help to iden-
tify patients at risk for overestimation and underestima-
tion, and inform interventions to correct unique types of
illness misunderstanding. Despite these limitations, this
study points to the need for culturally sensitive communi-
cation training programs for medical providers that con-
sider patients’ religious and personal beliefs. However, it
is important to note that the source of patients’ LEEs did
not explain racial differences in the accuracy of LEEs.
Ongoing research is needed to understand the mech-
anisms underlying racial differences in patients’ under-
standing of their illness. Important factors to explore
include the timing, source, and content of discussions of a
patient’s prognosis and how black and white patients
understand and use this information to make treatment
decisions. In addition, explication of the nature of
patients’ religious and personal beliefs related to prognos-
tic understanding will allow providers to integrate these
beliefs into prognostic discussions. Because of the perso-
nal and potentially individualized nature of these beliefs,
mixed methods research designs that provide both in-
depth and aggregate views of these factors will be impor-
tant. These findings will inform targeted interventions to
improve all patients’ illness understanding and to reduce
racial disparities in illness understanding.
