l Duvelisib significantly
improved progression-
free survival and
overall response rates

CLL/SLL patients.
Duvelisib (also known as IPI-145) is an oral, dual inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
d and g (PI3K-d,g) being developed for treatment of hematologic malignancies. PI3K-d,g
signaling can promote B-cell proliferation and survival in clonal B-cell malignancies, such as
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In a phase 1 study,
duvelisib showed clinically meaningful activity and acceptable safety in CLL/SLL patients.
We report here the results of DUO, a global phase 3 randomized study of duvelisib vs
ofatumumab monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory (RR) CLL/SLL. Patients
were randomized 1:1 to oral duvelisib 25 mg twice daily (n 5 160) or ofatumumab IV
(n 5 159). The study met the primary study end point by significantly improving
progression-free survival per independent review committee assessment compared with
ofatumumab for all patients (median, 13.3 months vs 9.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 5 0.52;
P < .0001), including those with high-risk chromosome 17p13.1 deletions [del(17p)] and/or
TP53 mutations (HR 5 0.40; P 5 .0002). The overall response rate was significantly higher
with duvelisib (74% vs 45%; P < .0001) regardless of del(17p) status. The most common
adverse events were diarrhea, neutropenia, pyrexia, nausea, anemia, and cough on the
duvelisib arm, and neutropenia and infusion reactions on the ofatumumab arm. The DUO trial data support duvelisib as
a potentially effective treatment option for patients with RR CLL/SLL. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov
as #NCT02004522. (Blood. 2018;132(23):2446-2455)
Introduction
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult
lymphoproliferative disorder in Western countries, with .20 000
estimated new cases in the United States in 2017 and .4600
deaths.1 The timing and selection of therapy is largely informed
by multiple clinical and biological factors, specifically disease stage,
presence of poor prognostic molecular features such as 17p13.1
deletions [del(17p)] and TP53 mutations, and the general status of
individual patients, many of whom are elderly with comorbid
conditions precluding aggressive chemoimmunotherapy.2,3 Che-
motherapy, specifically alkylating agents and purine analogs, and
monoclonal CD20 antibody therapy have long represented the
traditional backbone of frontline therapy.4 The comparator agent
for the DUO trial, ofatumumab, is a humanized anti-CD20 antibody
with single-agent efficacy against refractory CLL and a US Food and
Drug Administration–approved treatment option.5,6 Recently ap-
proved therapies targeting key pathways of CLL cell proliferation
and survival, particularly Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphati-
dylinositol 3-kinase d (PI3K-d), and BCL2, have greatly improved
outcomes for CLL patients and have been integrated into the CLL
treatment landscape.7 However, except for allogeneic stem cell
transplantation, there is general consensus that current therapies

From 
 for CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are not curative, and
most patients will ultimately die of their disease.8,9 Given the in-
evitable development of resistance or intolerance to available
therapies, there remains an urgent need to develop novel effective
and tolerable CLL/SLL treatment options.
Duvelisib is an oral dual PI3K-d,g inhibitor that targets key sig-
naling pathways that promote the growth and survival of he-
matologic malignancies. PI3K-d inhibition blocks the survival and
proliferation of malignant B cells,10-12 whereas PI3K-g inhibition
disrupts the recruitment and differentiation of T cells and
macrophages within the tumor microenvironment that support
malignant B-cell maintenance.13-16 Dual PI3K-d,g inhibition has
shown greater activity in preclinical models of CLL than blocking
either isoform alone.17-21 Accordingly, duvelisib’s unique ther-
apeutic potential offers a novel approach to treat patients with
CLL/SLL.
The efficacy and safety profile of duvelisib monotherapy for the
treatment of hematologic malignancies was demonstrated in a
phase 1 trial.22,23 Clinically meaningful activity was observed in
a cohort of relapsed or refractory (RR) CLL/SLL patients with
a 56% overall response rate (ORR) and a median progression-
free survival (PFS) of 15.7 months.22,24 Reductions in serine/
threonine protein kinase B phosphorylation (p-AKT) and pro-
liferating (Ki671) CLL cells were seen in CLL patient samples
following duvelisib administration, demonstrating pharmaco-
dynamic evidence of PI3K inhibition. Based on the combined
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic data
from this phase 1 study, duvelisib 25 mg twice daily was selected
as a clinically active dose for a phase 3 investigation in CLL/SLL.22
Building on these encouraging phase 1 results, the global
phase 3 randomized DUO study was initiated in 2014 to fully
characterize the efficacy and safety of duvelisib monotherapy
in patients with RR CLL/SLL when compared with an approved
standard of care, ofatumumab monotherapy. Herein are reported
the final analysis results for this trial.
Methods
Study design and treatment
DUO is a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3
trial comparing the efficacy and safety of duvelisib monotherapy
with ofatumumab monotherapy for RR CLL/SLL. Between
21 January 2014 and 9 December 2015, 319 patients with RR
CLL/SLL were randomized 1:1 to study treatment with duvelisib
(n 5 160) or ofatumumab (n 5 159) at 62 clinical study sites in
11 countries. Patients were required to have active CLL/SLL dis-
ease necessitating treatment, per the International Workshop on
CLL25 criteria or Revised International Working Group26 criteria
that had progressed during or relapsed after at least 1 previous
CLL/SLL therapy. Radiologically measurable disease, defined as
at least 1 lymph node or tumor mass measuring .1.5 cm by
computed tomography scan, was required. Other standard el-
igibility requirements included adequate renal and hepatic
function, hemoglobin $8.0 g/dL, and platelet count $10 000 mL
with or without transfusion support. There was no eligibility
requirement with regard to neutrophil count. Key exclusion
criteria included prior treatment with BTK or PI3K-d inhibitors;
refractoriness to prior ofatumumab therapy; or a history of
Richter transformation, prolymphocytic leukemia, or allogenic
stem cell transplant. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis con-
comitant with study drug treatment was required for all patients
on both treatment arms. Per protocol, antiviral prophylaxis was
recommended to be implemented at the discretion of the
treating investigator.
Patient stratification at randomization included the presence or
absence of del(17p), grade 4 cytopenia, and refractoriness/early
relapse to purine analog based therapy (defined as progression
,12 months after fludarabine/pentostatin). Patients randomized
to the duvelisib arm self-administered 25 mg capsules twice
daily continuously in 28-day cycles except for the first cycle
(21 days) to align with administration of ofatumumab infusions.
Patients were allowed to take duvelisib for up to 18 cycles, until
disease progression, or until unacceptable toxicity. Additional
treatment with duvelisib beyond 18 cycles was allowed based on
the judgement of the investigator. Guidance for adverse event
(AE) management was provided in the protocol and included
dose modifications (interruptions and reductions) for treatment-
related grade 2 or higher pneumonitis or pneumonia, grade 3
or higher nonhematologic AEs, febrile neutropenia, and throm-
bocytopenia with hemorrhage. Corticosteroids were recom-
mended for colitis or persistent or recurrent severe diarrhea and in
combination with antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with
pulmonary symptoms or radiographic changes suspicious for
pneumonitis.
Ofatumumab arm dosing was based on the dose and schedule
outlined in the approved product labeling for monotherapy in
relapsed CLL at the time the study was initiated and could not
exceed the 12 doses (within 7 cycles) as described in the pre-
scribing information.27
Study visits for duvelisib arm patients occurred on cycle 1 day 1
and 8, cycle 2 day 1 and 15, and day 1 of every other cycle
thereafter. Study visits for ofatumumab arm patients were similar
except for additional visits on cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 2 day 8
and 22, for study drug infusions. Patients on either treatment arm
that experienced radiographically confirmed progressive dis-
ease had the option to cross over to a separate extension study
to receive the opposite therapy.
Study end points and assessments
The primary end point was PFS, defined as time from ran-
domization to first documentation of progressive disease as
determined by an independent review committee (IRC) or death
attributable to any cause. Key secondary end points included the
following: (1) ORR, with overall response (per IRC determination)
defined as the best response of complete response/remission
(CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery, partial response/
remission (PR), or PR with lymphocytosis (PRwL), according to the
International Workshop on CLL25,26 or Revised International
Working Group response criteria,28 with modification for treatment-
related lymphocytosis; and (2) overall survival (OS). Per protocol,
a response of PRwL was limited to patients with lymphadenopathy
as the only abnormal baseline group A criterion (eg, no organo-
megaly and normal blood lymphocyte count ,4000/mL) who
achieved a PR ($50% reduction in lymphadenopathy) but had
postbaseline isolated progressive lymphocytosis. Response
assessments for both arms included complete blood count
with differential, computed tomography scan, disease-associated

 symptom review, and bone marrow biopsy (for CR confirma-
tion only) that were performed after every 2 cycles until cycle 7,
every 4 cycles until cycle 19, and then every 6 cycles until dis-
ease progression, start of new anticancer therapy, or subject
withdrawal.
Efficacy analysis and statistics
PFS was compared between the duvelisib and ofatumumab
treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test (1-sided) with the
overall 1-sided significance level controlled at .025. The hazard
ratio (HR) for duvelisib/ofatumumab and the corresponding
2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using
a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, and PFS for both
arms was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The ORR was
analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to compare
treatments. OS (time from randomization to death) was compared
between treatment arms using a stratified 1-sided log-rank test,
and the HR along with the 95% CI was estimated using a stratified
Cox model. Kaplan-Meier plots for OS were generated for each
treatment group. The lymph node response rates ($50% reduc-
tion in target lymph nodes from baseline) between treatment arms
was analyzed using the 1-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
Safety methods
AEs and hematology and blood chemistry laboratory values
were assessed at each study visit or as clinically warranted and
coded using MedDRA version 16.1. The severity of AEs and
applicable laboratory values was graded according to the Na-
tional Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Ad-
verse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03.

Results
Patient baseline characteristics and disposition
The baseline characteristics and stratification of study patients
were well balanced between the 2 treatment arms (Table 1).
Patients were predominantly male (60%) with a median age in
both arms of 69 years. Most patients had a baseline ECOG PS of
0 or 1, with a similar percentage of patients with an ECOG PS of
2 (duvelisib 7%; ofatumumab 10%). The median time from initial
diagnosis was 7.5 years for duvelisib and 6.7 years for ofatu-
mumab, and 56% of patients in both arms were greater than or
equal to Rai stage III at the start of therapy. Nearly half of
duvelisib- and ofatumumab-treated patients had bulky disease
(46% and 45%, respectively), and both arms had similar median
baseline lymphocyte counts (38 3 109/L and 35 3 109/L). Central
laboratory determination of molecular features identified del
(17p) and/or TP53 mutation in approximately one-third of
patients (duvelisib 31%; ofatumumab 33%) and unmutated IGHV
status in 69% and 73% of duvelisib and ofatumumab patients,
respectively.

From 
 On both study arms, the median number of prior therapies was
2, with approximately one-third having received $3 prior lines
of therapy (supplemental Table 1; available on the Blood Web
site). Most patients had previously received an alkylating agent
(93% duvelisib; 95% ofatumumab), a monoclonal antibody (78%
duvelisib; 83% ofatumumab), and purine analog (60% duvelisib;
71% ofatumumab).
Of the patients randomized into each arm, 158 and 155 patients
initiated treatment with duvelisib and ofatumumab, respectively
(Table 2; supplemental Figure 1). As of the 19 May 2017 data
cutoff date, 124 duvelisib-treated patients had discontinued
treatment, with the most common reasons being AEs (35%),
disease progression (22%), subject withdrawal (8%), and death
(8%). All ofatumumab-treated patients had discontinued treat-
ment; most (67%) completed treatment as per protocol, whereas
others discontinued because of disease progression (20%),
subject withdrawal (5%), and AEs (4%). At the time of disease
progression, 8 (5%) duvelisib patients opted to cross over
to ofatumumab therapy, and 89 (57%) ofatumumab-treated
patients opted to cross over to duvelisib therapy in a separate
extension study. Efficacy and safety data for that study will be
reported separately.
Efficacy
The primary efficacy end point for this study was PFS as de-
termined by IRC, with ORR and OS as key secondary end points.
With a median overall follow up of 22.4 months for the duvelisib
and ofatumumab arms, median PFS by blinded IRC review
was significantly longer for the duvelisib arm compared with
the ofatumumab arm (13.3 months vs 9.9 months, HR 5 0.52,
P , .0001) (Figure 1A). The estimated probability of being
progression-free at 6 months and 12 months was 78% and 60%,
respectively, in the duvelisib arm, and 72% and 39% in the
ofatumumab arm. Improvement in PFS with duvelisib compared
with ofatumumab was also observed per investigator assessment
(17.6 months vs 9.7 months, HR 5 0.40, P , .0001; Figure 1B).
PFS was also extended with duvelisib in multiple predefined
CLL/SLL subgroups examined, including patients with high-risk
cytogenetic markers (Figure 2A). In the subset of patients with
del(17p)/TP53 mutations, median PFS by IRC assessment
was 12.7 months with duvelisib vs 9.0 months for ofatumumab
(HR 5 0.40, P 5 .0002), with an estimated probability of being
progression-free at 6 months and 12 months of 73% and
55% with duvelisib, and 63% and 30% with ofatumumab
(Figure 2B). By investigator assessment, median PFS in patients

 with del(17p)/TP53 mutations was 13.8 months with duvelisib
and 9.5 months with ofatumumab (HR 5 0.41, P 5 .0003) with an
estimated probability of being progression free at 6 months and
12 months of 77% and 66% with duvelisib, and 53% and 33%
with ofatumumab (Figure 2C). Duvelisib maintained a favorable
odds ratio relative to ofatumumab for all subgroups analyzed,
including refractory/early relapse (HR 5 0.51), baseline grade 4
cytopenia (HR 5 0.14), and prior anticancer therapy within the
past 12 months (HR 5 0.40).
The ORR per IRC response assessment for duvelisib was also
significantly higher compared with ofatumumab (73.8% vs 45.3%;
P , .0001) (Figure 3). In the duvelisib arm, nearly all responses
were PR (72.5%) with the exception of 2 patients: 1 patient
achieving a CR (0.6%) and 1 patient achieving a PRwL (0.6%).
Responses on the ofatumumab arm were also predominantly
PRs (44.7%) with a CR (0.6%) in 1 patient (supplemental Table 2).
Duvelisib treatment was particularly effective in targeting the
lymph node disease compartment, with a lymph node response
by IRC assessment of 85.0% (95% CI, 79.5-90.5) compared with
15.7% (95% CI, 10.1-21.4) in the ofatumumab arm (P , .0001;
Figure 3). Median OS was not reached on either treatment arm
with a 12-month probability of survival of 86% (HR 5 0.99; 95% CI,
0.65-1.50) for both treatments (supplemental Figure 2).
Safety
AEs were assessed during the treatment periods of each arm.
Median treatment exposure was approximately twice as long
among duvelisib-treated patients (median duration 50 weeks)
compared with ofatumumab-treated patients (median duration
23 weeks). Per protocol, ofatumumab treatment did not exceed
the 12 doses (;6 months) specified in the ofatumumab pre-
scribing information. As of the data cutoff, 49% of duvelisib-
treated patients had received more than a year of treatment,
with 31% and 12% having received 1.5 years and 2 years of
treatment, respectively. AEs that occurred in $10% patients
during these respective AE reporting periods (ie, not exposure
matched) are presented in Table 3. Nearly all patients in both
arms experienced an AE. The most common hematologic AEs
with duvelisib and ofatumumab were neutropenia (33% and
21%), anemia (23% and 10%), and thrombocytopenia (15% and
6%), respectively. The nonhematologic AEs most commonly
reported with duvelisib were diarrhea (51%), pyrexia (29%),
nausea (23%), and cough (21%). Colitis, as a distinct event from
diarrhea, was reported in 13% with 8% of patients having diarrhea
directly preceding and/or overlapping with the colitis event.
Median time to first event of diarrhea or colitis was ;4 months
and 7 months, respectively. With ofatumumab, infusion-related
reaction (19%), cough (14%), and diarrhea, rash, and fatigue
(12% each) were the most common nonhematologic AEs.
AEs $grade 3 occurred in 87% of duvelisib arm patients and
48% of ofatumumab arm patients. In the duvelisib arm, the most
common severe events were neutropenia (30%), diarrhea (15%),
pneumonia (14%), and anemia (13%). On the ofatumumab arm,
only neutropenia (17%) occurred in $10% of patients. As pre-
viously observed in the phase 1 study,22,24 severe immune-related
toxicities ($grade 3) were noted in duvelisib-treated patients. In
this phase 3 study, the occurrence of severe immune-related
toxicities included colitis (12%) and pneumonitis, alanine trans-
aminase, or aspartate transaminase increase (3% each). Although
these events were primarily managed with dose interruptions,
60% of patients with pneumonitis or colitis received steroid
therapy with resolution reported in nearly all patients at the time
of data cutoff. None of these events were fatal.
Infectious AEs were more frequently reported in the duvelisib
arm (69% vs 43%) with pneumonia (18%) and URTI (16%) rep-
resenting the most common events. P jirovecii pneumonia oc-
curred in 3 duvelisib-treated patients and 1 ofatumumab-treated
patient, 3 of whom were not receiving prophylaxis at the time
of their infections despite being required per protocol and
1 duvelisib-treated patient who discontinued prophylaxis be-
cause of intolerance. Of the duvelisib-treated patients who
discontinued treatment because of AEs, colitis and diarrhea
were the only AEs occurring in $5% of patients (both 5%).
Treatment discontinuations from the other immune-related
toxicities of pneumonitis (2%) and elevated aspartate trans-
aminase levels (1%) were infrequent.
Serious AEs are summarized in supplemental Table 3. Pneumonia
was the most frequently reported serious AE in both treatment
arms (duvelisib 15%; ofatumumab 3%). There were 19 fatal AEs
on the duvelisib arm (supplemental Table 4), 4 of which were
assessed by investigators as related to study drug: staphylococcal
pneumonia (n 5 2) and sepsis and general health deterioration
(n 5 1 each). On the ofatumumab arm, 7 patients had fatal AEs,
although none were attributed to ofatumumab treatment.
Pharmacodynamic measurements
Twenty-four chemokines and cytokines were measured in pa-
tient serum samples, and the median percent change from
baseline to cycle 2 day 1 was determined to assess treatment-
related effects associated with the targeting of leukemia cells
and the tumor microenvironment,29,30 as described in the sup-
plemental Methods section. Sixteen chemokines were sig-
nificantly reduced from baseline in duvelisib-treated patients
(P , .05; Figure 4). Ofatumumab-treated patients had levels
that were not statistically decreased from baseline, whereas
the duvelisib-treated patients had decreased levels that were
highly significant: CCL1 (P , .0001), CCL17 (P , .0001), CXCL10
(P , .0002), CXCL11 (P , .0009), CXCL9 (P , .0001), and
interleukin-10 (P , .0001). In total, 10 chemokines showed
.50% median decreases in duvelisib-treated patients.
Discussion
In this pivotal phase 3 DUO study, duvelisib monotherapy
resulted in statistically significant improvement in PFS and
ORR compared with ofatumumab in patients with RR CLL/SLL,

From 
 including those with del(17p)/TP53 mutations. This improve-
ment was consistently observed across all sensitivity and sub-
group analyses for both efficacy end points. In the duvelisib
arm, the median PFS as determined using investigator re-
sponse assessments was notably longer than IRC-assessed PFS
(17.6 months vs 13.3 months). This difference likely reflects in-
herent differences in methodologies used to derive responses and
determine progression between the 2 evaluator groups. With the
IRC PFS largely based on radiological data, the investigator-
derived PFS, incorporating both radiological and real-time clini-
cal assessments, as would be applied in the standard oncology
care setting, likely represents a more clinically relevant PFS.
Clinically meaningful reductions in target lymph nodes were
observed in most patients treated with duvelisib (85%), repre-
senting a statistically significant treatment effect over ofatumumab
(16%) (P , .0001). Median OS was similar between the 2 treat-
ment arms, which may be explained by the availability of multiple
CLL therapies to rescue patients on either arm following disease
progression, including administration of duvelisib in a separate,
optional extension study to 89 patients who had confirmed
progressive disease on ofatumumab in the DUO study.
Based on the study design, the treatment period for duvelisib
was longer than ofatumumab (median exposure 50 weeks vs
23 weeks), which resulted in a longer AE reporting period for
duvelisib compared with ofatumumab. Of the patients treated
with duvelisib, 49%, 31%, and 12% received more than a year,
18 months, and 2 years of treatment, respectively. The duvelisib
AE profile observed in this trial was consistent with the drug
safety profile to date,22,24 with the majority of AEs presenting
as grade 1 or 2 events. Many of the more common AEs, such as
cytopenias and constitutional symptoms, are also well-recognized
complications of CLL/SLL. Similar to other B-cell receptor pathway

From 
 inhibitors, infections (particularly pneumonias and URTIs)31,32 were
frequently observed on duvelisib, representing the most common
severe and serious AEs; 3 patients died because of treatment-
related infections. Although a well-recognized major cause of
morbidity and mortality in CLL given the humoral immunode-
pression inherent to the disease33,34 and therapy-induced im-
munosuppression, infections remain an important risk with
duvelisib treatment. The protocol requirement for P jirovecii
pneumonia prophylaxis may have mitigated against the risks of
these opportunistic infections, which have been reported with
other B-cell receptor inhibitors.35-39 Of interest, the 3 duvelisib-
treated patients who experienced P jirovecii infections during
the study were not receiving prophylaxis because of protocol
deviations or medication intolerance.
Several prespecified AEs of interest relating to possible immu-
nomodulatory effects of PI3K-d/g inhibition40-45 were closely
monitored in this study. Incidences of neutropenia, diarrhea,
colitis, transaminase elevations, pneumonitis, and rash with
duvelisib therapy were moderate and manageable with early
intervention and dose modification as required per protocol. Of
these, colitis was the most commonly observed severe ($grade
3) event, reported in 12% of duvelisib treated patients, and
severe cases of pneumonitis, transaminase elevations, and toxic
skin eruption/rash were reported in ,3%. None of these events
were fatal. These potential immune-mediated toxicities, iden-
tified in clinical studies with the PI3K-d specific inhibitor idela-
lisib, infrequently led to discontinuations of duvelisib therapy.
Malignant B-cell proliferation and survival in CLL/SLL is pro-
moted by PI3K.10-12 The PI3K-d/g isoforms are also expressed in
cells comprising the tumor microenvironment where they pro-
vide supportive signaling.13-16 As a dual PI3K-d/g inhibitor,
duvelisib has the potential to target cell autonomous mitogenic
and survival signaling, as well as the supportive tumor micro-
environment that further enables CLL proliferation.30,46 An
analysis of patient blood protein profiles showed significant
reductions in the levels of serum chemokines and cytokines
associated with malignant B cells, consistent with decreases in
CLL viability and proliferation, as previously reported.24 Con-
sidering the dual inhibitor action of duvelisib, the pattern of
chemokine change may reflect the inhibition of both PI3K-d
and PI3K-g signaling within the tumor microenvironment.
This report of the DUO study data represents the second phase 3
randomized trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of an oral
PI3K inhibitor in relapsed CLL patients. In a prior study, idelalisib,
an oral inhibitor of the PI3K-d isoform, in combination with rit-
uximab showed improved PFS compared with rituximab mono-
therapy (not reached vs 5.5 months) and response rate (81% vs
13%) in patients with relapsed CLL who have clinically significant
coexisting medical conditions.47 The incidence of the more
common AEs in the idelalisib 1 rituximab arm, such as cytopenias,
constitutional symptoms, and diarrhea, occurred at similar rates in
the duvelisib arm of the DUO trial. However, at the time of the
idelalisib trial analysis, patients in the idelalisib 1 rituximab arm
had only received study drug for a median of 3.8 months com-
pared with the much longer exposure of duvelisib of nearly a year
in the DUO trial. This large difference in drug exposure and ob-
servation periods makes it difficult to compare incidences across
trials. Additionally, the timing of some immune-mediated tox-
icities, such as colitis and pneumonitis, which tend to emerge with
longer drug exposure, may be more accurately represented in this
study with a longer duration of assessment. Interestingly, however,
the incidence of high-grade transaminitis AEs with duvelisib was
low in this study. The AE profile with duvelisib monotherapy
remains consistent across studies22,23 and manageable with ap-
propriate intervention via dose modifications, routine medical
care, and prophylactic measures. Additional characterization of
key safety events associated with the use of idelalisib40 and PI3K
inhibitors as a whole41 has greatly informed the guidance for
maximizing safe administration of drugs in this class.

From 
 comparing to duvelisib monotherapy at the time of study initia-
tion. However, the use of single-agent ofatumumab for the
treatment of relapsed CLL has diminished in recent years, being
supplanted by newer agents that target the B-cell receptor
pathway. In addition to idelalisib in combination with rituximab,
ibrutinib, an oral BTK inhibitor, received full approval in 2014
based on a phase 3 randomized study demonstrating significantly
improved PFS compared with ofatumumab (median PFS not
reached vs 8.1 months [HR 5 0.22]).7 Treatment indications have
since expanded to include ibrutinib use as a frontline CLL therapy.
Despite advantages of being an effective and well-tolerated
therapy, it is not curative, and treatment discontinuations be-
cause of disease progression and drug intolerance have been
described in published reports.48-50 Given the unfortunate reality
that many patients have or acquire resistance or intolerance to
currently available, targeted therapies, or have comorbidities that
may preclude their safe use, there remains a critical medical need
for additional, novel, targeted therapies for patients with RR CLL/
SLL, especially those with del(17p)/TP53 mutations. These com-
bined safety and efficacy results suggest that duvelisib mono-
therapy may offer an effective treatment of CLL/SLL patients in
need of additional therapeutic options.
