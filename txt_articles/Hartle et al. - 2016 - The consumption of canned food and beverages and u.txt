Abstract
Background—Exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous and includes dietary and 
environmental pathways. BPA is rapidly glucuronidated in the body, and both BPA and its 
conjugates can be readily measured in urine.
Objectives—To investigate the contribution of canned food and beverages, known sources of 
BPA contamination, to BPA biomarkers of exposure using dietary and urinary BPA concentration 
information in a representative sample of the U.S. population.
Methods—We evaluated 7,669 NHANES 2003–2008 participants 6 years and older with 24-hour 
dietary recall information and urinary BPA concentrations available. Using linear regression 
models, we evaluated the associations between recent canned food and beverage consumption and 
urinary BPA concentrations, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results—We found 9% of our participants consumed one canned food in the past 24 hours and 
2% consumed two or more canned foods. The consumption of one canned food vs. none was 
associated with 24% (95% CI 1.11, 1.38) higher urinary BPA concentrations. The consumption of 
two or more canned foods vs. none was associated with 54% (95% CI 1.27, 1.88) higher urinary 
BPA concentrations. The consumption of one or more of some specific types of canned foods vs. 
none were associated with higher urinary BPA concentrations: 41% (95% CI 1.23, 1.63) higher 
BPA for vegetable and fruit, 70% (95% CI 1.18, 2.44) higher for canned pasta, and 229% (95% CI

 1.22, 4.30) higher for canned soup. Canned beverages were not associated with urinary BPA 
concentrations.
Conclusions—Canned food, including some specific types such as canned vegetable and fruit, 
canned pasta, and canned soup were associated with higher levels of urinary BPA concentrations.

Background
Bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic chemical with endocrine disrupting properties approved for 
use in food packaging in the 1960’s (FDA 2015), is commonly utilized as a monomer base 
for polycarbonate plastic (PC) and as a linkage in epoxy resins. PC is a hard, clear plastic 
used in a wide range of consumer products including food storage containers (FDA 2015; 
Krishnan et al. 1993). Enamel coatings made of epoxy resins are used to line the inside of 
many food and beverage containers (Biles et al. 1997; FDA 2015). Additional BPA uses 
include as a color developer in thermal receipts (Biedermann et al. 2010; T. Geens et al. 
2012; Liao and Kannan 2011), in medical devices (Tinne Geens et al. 2012), and as a 
component of some dental composites (Joskow et al. 2006; Olea et al. 1996).
The widespread use of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins in consumer products 
(Melzer et al. 2010; Tsai 2006; Willhite et al. 2008) has contributed to the ubiquitous BPA 
exposure in the human population, with BPA being detected in the urine of 92.6 % of the 
American population (Calafat et al. 2008). Although BPA exposure has been measured in 
household dust and air (Loganathan and Kannan 2011; Wilson et al. 2007) and in water 
contaminated by landfill leachate (Vandenberg et al. 2007; vom Saal et al. 2007), diet is 
considered the main contributor of BPA exposure (Christensen et al. 2015; Kang et al. 2006; 
von Goetz et al. 2010; Wilson et al. 2007).
BPA in food packaging is a concern due to its propensity to leach into the product. BPA 
molecules migrating into the food from its incomplete polymerization in the manufacturing 
of epoxy resins of cans was recognized in 1995 (Brotons et al. 1995). Subsequent studies 
have shown that BPA can leach into food from polycarbonate plastic bottles, plastic storage 
containers, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stretch film (Biles et al. 1997; Brede et al. 2003; 
Lopez-Cervantes and Paseiro-Losada 2003; McNeal et al. 2000; Noonan et al. 2011; 
Schecter et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011). Intervention studies have shown an ability to 
decrease or increase urinary BPA concentration by controlling the consumption of known 
sources of BPA from the food system (Carwile et al. 2011; Rudel et al. 2011; Teeguarden et 
al. 2011). Studies closely following dietary intake and collecting multiple biomarker 
samples validated with pharmacokinetics data have shown that about two-thirds of BPA 
exposure can be attributed to diet, and one third is unaccounted for (Christensen et al. 2015). 
Analysis of fasting data have also shown that when dietary intake stops, BPA is still present 
in the body indicating non-food pathways or possible storage of BPA in fat (Stahlhut et al. 
2009).

 When BPA is ingested by humans, it is transformed by the liver into bisphenol A-
glucuronide, a highly water soluble compound (Volkel et al. 2002). In pharmacokinetics 
studies, BPA’s half-life in the body is less than six hours, and BPA is completely eliminated 
from the body in 24 hours (Volkel et al. 2002). Because of its rapid clearance from the body 
through urine, total urinary BPA compounds, comprised of free plus conjugated BPA, are the 
most appropriate BPA exposure assessment marker (Melzer et al. 2010). The best urinary 
collection method including single samples vs. 24-hour sampling, and the timing of 
sampling have been investigated (Arakawa et al. 2004; Christensen et al. 2012; Dekant and 
Volkel 2008; LaKind and Naiman 2015; Lassen et al. 2013; Mahalingaiah et al. 2008; Ye et 
al. 2011). The conclusions of those studies vary depending on a researcher’s intent to 
determine individual or population level BPA exposures and short-term vs. long term 
exposure profiles. Spot urine samples collected by large cross-sectional population level 
surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), can 
characterize average population exposures (Lakind and Naiman 2008; Ye et al. 2011).
The goal of this research was to evaluate the dietary contributions to urinary BPA in a 
representative sample of the US population. Using NHANES data, we focused on the dietary 
information collected in the 24-hour exposure window prior to collection of a urine sample 
for BPA testing. The 24-hour dietary recall food coding provided identification on canned 
food and canned beverages, dietary components known to be BPA exposure sources, 
allowing the inclusion of those dietary sources of BPA in the current analyses.
Methods
Study population
This study utilizes three cycles of publicly available NHANES data: 2003–2004, 2005–
2006, and 2007–2008 (CDC 2003, 2005, 2007c). NHANES is an ongoing cross-sectional 
survey of the non-institutionalized US population that employs a complex, multi-stage 
survey design. Total urinary BPA concentration was first measured in NHANES 2003–2004 
in a random one-third subsample of the NHANES population six years and older as part of 
the environmental phenols panel. Each subsequent survey cycle has followed the same BPA 
sampling plan. For this analysis, we used data from 7699 persons six years and older who 
completed their NHANES 2003–2008 interviews and examinations, environmental phenol 
panel, and for whom BPA data were present. We excluded 355 with missing diet data, and 
942 participants missing other relevant covariates, leaving 6372 participants for the study’s 
models. The study population is similar to the overall 7669 population in participant 
characteristics such as age, sex, education and race/ethnicity [data not shown].
Biomonitoring measurements
Urinary samples were collected when the participant visited the Mobile Examination Center 
(MEC). From the MEC, the urine samples were frozen and shipped for BPA analysis to the 
Division of Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental 
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2004, 2007a).

 The processing laboratories used a lab method especially designed by NHANES to be 
sensitive to measuring BPA and other environmental phenols on the panel in urine. The 
method utilized solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled on-line to high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). They also used 
isotopically labeled internal standards to detect relatively low levels of phenols for 100 μL of 
urine (CDC 2007b). The detection limits within an NHANES cycle were consistent. For the 
2003–2004 cycle, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.36 ng/ml. For 2005–2006 and 2007–
2008, the LOD was 0.4 ng/ml. The percent of samples below the LOD was 6.5% for 
NHANES 2003–2004, 7.1% for NHANES 2005–2006 and 6.4% for NHANES 2007–2008 
(CDC 2007b, 2009b, 2011). NHANES represented values below the limit of detection with 
the calculation LOD/√2 (CDC 2009a).
Dietary Measures
On the same day as the urinary sample for BPA analysis was collected, the 24-hour dietary 
recall data were recorded by an interviewer during the MEC appointment (CDC 2002). 
These data were called “Day 1” to distinguish them from the second day of dietary recall 
information that was recorded from a phone interview 3 – 10 days after the MEC 
appointment. Since BPA is rapidly glucuronidated and cleared in the urine in approximately 
24 hours (Nachman et al. 2014; Volkel et al. 2002), Day 1 24-hour dietary recall is an 
appropriate time to evaluate the associations between potential BPA food exposure and 
urinary BPA concentrations.
Following the 24-hour dietary recall, the dietary data are coded into food items using the 
USDA Food Codes (CDC 2006). USDA Food Codes are adjusted with every two-year 
NHANES cycle; removing codes that are underutilized and adding new codes for new 
commonly consumed food products. To analyze the association of consumption of food 
potentially high in BPA with urinary BPA concentrations, we re-coded the USDA Food 
Codes into categories based on the supporting information provided by the USDA Food 
Code fields entitled “main description” and “additional description” (USDA 2006, 2008, 
2010). The food re-coding categories were: (1) foods that are definitely canned as worded in 
their description, (2) foods that are possibly canned, (3) canned beverages, and (4) foods that 
are not canned. Within the canned food codes, there was further categorization into five 
canned food groups based upon categories utilized in published studies (Bureau of Chemical 
Safety 2010; Cao et al. 2011; Holmes et al. 2005) of BPA and canned food. These canned 
food groups included: dairy, meat and fish, vegetable and fruit, soup, and pasta. For more 
details on which canned foods were placed in each food group, see Supplemental Material, 
Table 1. Canned beverages were not readily recognized with food code descriptions. In order 
to identify canned beverages from the dietary recall, USDA Food and Nutrient Database for 
Dietary Studies (FNDDS) food weights and food portion descriptions were utilized (USDA 
2006, 2008, 2010). Portion descriptions identified the canned drinks and the associated 
portion code could link these descriptions to USDA Food Codes. (Moshfegh A, personal 
communication).
Re-coding of the USDA Food Codes reaped the definitely canned food numbers of 265, 257, 
and 258 for NHANES 2003–2004, 2005–2006, and 2007–2008, respectively. We reserved

 the “definitely canned” grouping for foods definitively stated as being canned in the main 
and additional descriptions of the USDA Food Codes. In cases where a canned food was 
combined with another food packaging type into one food code, dietary components 
identified by these types of food codes had to be placed in the “possibly canned” food 
category for this research. For food codes that could possibly be canned, the corresponding 
numbers for each cycle were 137, 134, and 134, respectively.
Supplemental Table 2 shows the number of food codes that were identified by the re-coding 
process per canned food category. It also displays the number of times an item in a canned 
food category was reported to be eaten. The use of the term “item” in this table relates to the 
number of eating events a participant reported for a certain food and does not correspond to 
a specific portion size. Canned vegetable and fruit represent the majority of the canned food 
items that were identified, as well as the number of canned items that were consumed. The 
top three canned food groups eaten were canned vegetable and fruit, accounting for 50% of 
the canned food eaten, followed by canned meat and fish at 33%, and canned pasta at 8%.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Stata (Stata 12.1 College Station, Texas). Statistical 
analysis accounted for the NHANES complex sampling design using strata, primary 
sampling units and specific sample weights for the BPA subsample following NHANES 
guidelines (CDC 2013). Standard errors were estimated using the Taylor series method of 
linearization to take into account stratification and clustering in “masked variance pseudo-
psu” and “pseudo-stratum” variables in the NHANES dataset.
We used simple and multiple linear regressions on natural log-transformed urinary BPA 
concentrations to evaluate the association between canned foods and BPA exposure. In these 
models, the exponentiation of the beta coefficient corresponds to the geometric mean ratio of 
urinary BPA concentrations per unit increase in canned food consumption. The covariates 
selected for adjustment were informed by previous BPA exposure studies in NHANES that 
described relevant possible confounders based on sociodemographic and lifestyle 
characteristics (Calafat et al. 2008; Lakind and Naiman 2011; Nelson et al. 2012). They 
included gender, age, race, income, education, and smoking. We also included creatinine as 
a covariate to account for urine dilution (Barr et al. 2005) and included it in our models as a 
continuous variable. Before adding urine creatinine concentrations into the regression 
models, the creatinine concentration was normalized by taking the square root. This is one 
recommended method to allow for BPA concentrations to be adjusted for urinary creatinine 
while still allowing the other covariates in the model to remain independent of urinary 
creatinine concentration fluctuations (Barr et al. 2005).
The study population was grouped into five age categories: 6–11 years, 12–19 years, 20–39 
years, 40–59 years, and 60 years and up. These age categories allowed comparability of this 
research to previous studies (Calafat et al. 2008; Lakind and Naiman 2008) and a roughly 
even distribution of the population among the age groups. Race and ethnicity were based on 
self-report and subsequently categorized by NHANES into five categories of Non-Hispanic 
White, Non-Hispanic Black, Mexican Americans, Other Hispanic, and Other ethnicity 
including Mixed Race in the analysis. We preserved as much information about the race/

 ethnic categories as publicly available in NHANES to potentially inform future public health 
interventions.
For participants 20 years and older, we used self-reported education data and categorized it 
into four groups: less than high school, high school graduate or equivalent, some college, 
and college graduate and above. For participants 6–19 years of age, we used the education 
level of the head of household. For income, we used the poverty income ratio (PIR). Income 
category divisions were decided based upon the poverty income ratio cut points used for the 
public food assistance programs Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and 
the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) (USDA 2003, 2015). The income groupings 
were PIR 0.000–1.3000; 1.301 – 3.501, and 3.501 and above (CDC 1996).
To assess smoking exposure, including both active smoking and secondhand smoke 
exposure, we utilized the serum cotinine values, a specific tobacco biomarker, as follows: 
unexposed (serum cotinine < 0.011 ng/ml, the limit of detection [LOD]); exposure to 
secondhand smoke (LOD 0.011 – 10 ng/ml); and active smokers (≥10 ng/ml) (Avila-Tang et 
al. 2013). Adjusting for smoking is important as published research found associations 
between smoking and urinary BPA concentrations (Braun et al. 2011; He et al. 2009). BPA 
can be a substantial component of cigarette filters making BPA exposure an issue for those 
exposed from active smoking or secondhand smoke (Jackson and Darnell 1985).
Results
After recoding the 24-hour dietary recalls into canned food categories, 11% of participants 
reported consuming one or more canned food and 17% reported consuming one or more 
canned beverages. When combining definitely and possibly canned food consumption, 41% 
consumed at least one or more canned food (Table 2). The mean number of definitely 
canned foods and beverages consumed per day was 0.40 (Table 1). Canned food and 
beverage consumption was higher in men than women; by age was highest in young adults; 
by race/ethnicity was higher in non-Hispanic Whites, especially compared to other Hispanic 
and to other races; and was lower in participants with the lowest income group, in 
participants with lowest and highest education, and among participants not exposed to 
secondhand smoke.
After multivariable adjustment, increasing canned foods consumption was associated with 
higher urinary BPA concentration for the whole population, for the adult population, and for 
children (Table 2). Overall, compared to no definitely canned food consumed in the past 24 
hours, the adjusted GM ratio (95% CI) for urinary BPA concentrations was 1.24 (1.11 – 
1.38) for one canned food and 1.54 (1.27 – 1.88) for two canned foods or more (p-trend 
<0.001). The corresponding GM ratios for definitely and possibly canned foods were 1.12 
(1.04 – 1.20) and 1.24 (1.12 – 1.37) (p-trend <0.001). For specific foods, the GM ratio (95% 
CI) of urinary BPA for consumption of one or more canned food versus none was 1.41 (CI 
1.23, 1.63) for canned vegetable and fruit, 1.70 (1.18, 2.44) for canned pasta, and 2.29 (1.22, 
4.30) for canned soup (Table 3). Canned beverages were not associated with urinary BPA 
concentrations.

 The associations between canned food and urinary BPA concentrations were stronger among 
children compared to adults, with GM ratios (95% CI) comparing one and two or more 
definitely canned foods vs. no canned food equal to 1.33 (1.09 – 1.62) and 1.75 (1.14 – 
2.70), respectively, for youth, and 1.21 (1.07, 1.37) and 1.49 (1.18, 1.89), respectively, for 
adults (Table 2). For specific canned foods, the youth and adult models showed a significant 
association between BPA concentration and consumption of canned vegetable and fruit with 
a GM ratio (95% CI) of 1.57 (1.21, 2.02) for youth and 1.37 (1.17, 1.60) for adults, and for 
canned pasta 1.62 (1.36, 1.93) and 1.68 (1.00, 2.81) for youth and adults, respectively (Table 
3). The two age groups differ in their GM ratios for soup with the youth GM ratio not 
achieving statistical significance (1.41 (0.66, 3.03)).
Discussion
In this representative sample of the US population, canned food consumption in the last 24 
hours was associated with higher urinary BPA concentrations in both children and adults. 
The association was stronger for children. Canned beverages were not associated with higher 
urinary BPA concentrations. Among specific canned foods, canned vegetable and fruit, 
canned pasta, and canned soup were associated with higher BPA concentrations while 
canned dairy and canned meat and fish were not. The association was strong for canned soup 
for the overall population, however, the strong association of urinary BPA concentration and 
soup consumption did not hold for the youth population (GM ratio (95% CI) of 1.41 (0.66, 
3.03)). These findings need to be interpreted cautiously as the number of participants 
consuming canned soup was small (n=23 overall, n=8 for youth) with soup only representing 
3% of the canned food eaten. This study is the first known analysis of NHANES data for 
dietary contributions of BPA exposure using USDA Food Codes. A major strength of the 
study includes the use of a nationally representative sample to evaluate associations between 
sources of exposure and biomarkers of internal dose.
One of the biggest challenges in this research was accurately identifying canned food from 
the dietary recall. The USDA Food Codes applied to the dietary recall are designed to 
capture the foods eaten for nutritional analysis. Their ability to be used for environmental 
health purposes is problematic because of the placement of several similar food items with 
different food packaging into the same food code. For example, one food code description of 
peaches is “peach, not specified as to raw, cooked, canned, frozen, or dried”. This means 
when dietary recalls are coded, the self-reporting of peaches eaten in any of these five forms 
will be placed into the same food code. As a result of this method, capturing the 
consumption of canned fruit, amongst other foods, was challenging. The conservative 
approach we applied of only using “definitely canned” for foods definitively stated as being 
canned in the main and additional descriptions of the USDA Food Codes with no overlap 
with other food packaging types might have missed a number of canned foods, but it is a 
more specific definition. The “definitely and possibly” food category which included canned 
food combined with another food packaging type into one food code is less specific and 
although the number of participants consuming canned foods is larger, and thus increasing 
power, the associations may have resulted in an underestimation of the associations. With 
both approaches we found statistically significant associations, although the strength of the 
association was stronger for the conservative definition, consistent with a more specific

 definition. Overall, this study was successful in developing a method for identifying canned 
food and canned beverages from NHANES 24-hour dietary recall data using the USDA 
Food Codes and packaging information from the FNDDS files.
Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data have some limitations, most of which are accounted for 
with the NHANES sample design and our research purpose of investigating population level 
trends. This type of dietary recall data cannot be used to represent long-term intake as 
dietary intake is highly variable from day to day and by the day-of-the-week. Twenty-four-
hour dietary recalls also rely on self-reported data which may not be accurate. The 
NHANES data collection works to account for these shortcomings by collecting dietary data 
on different days of the week and to collect data from a representative sample of the U.S. 
population, so that the resulting population level data can be used to assess group trends 
(Willett 1990).
Some food categories were more easily identified by the canned coding methodology. 
Canned vegetables were identified by over 140 food codes, leading to the reporting of 443 
instances or 47% of canned food consumed by the sub-population analyzed (Supplemental 
Table 2). This is a more precise reflection of the potential for canned vegetable consumption 
in the United States as the USDA has calculated that 24% of the total vegetables available 
for consumption are canned (Buzby et al. 2010). For fruit, the USDA has estimated that 6% 
of all fruit available for consumption is canned (Buzby et al. 2010). We identified only 25 
instances of canned fruit consumption in the overall population, and only 3 instances in the 
sub-population modeled, a probable underestimation of actual consumption.
We compared the trends in BPA exposure from canned food and beverage exposure to prior 
research. There is extensive literature investigating BPA contamination of food and 
beverages, developing the best analytical methods for detection and determining the factors 
influencing BPA migration, with some references listed here (Bureau of Chemical Safety 
2010; Cao et al. 2009, 2010, 2011; Goodson et al. 2002; Imanaka et al. 2001; Lorber et al. 
2015; Munguia-Lopez et al. 2005; Noonan et al. 2011; Sajiki et al. 2007; Schecter et al. 
2010; Thomson and Grounds 2005; Yonekubo et al. 2008; Yoshida et al. 2001). For the 
following discussion, we compared our findings to research conducted in North America to 
provide a closer comparison to the foods purchased and consumed in the United States 
(Bureau of Chemical Safety 2010; Cao et al. 2009, 2010; Cao et al. 2011; Lorber et al. 2015; 
Noonan et al. 2011; Schecter et al. 2010). Although there is considerable variability in the 
BPA concentrations between foods and within food types (Noonan et al. 2011), we expected 
our population data would reflect the following trends previously identified in the literature: 
BPA concentration (ng/g) is lower in canned beverages than canned foods (Cao et al. 2009, 
2010), canned vegetables, specifically green beans, peas, and creamed corn can have high 
BPA concentration values (Bureau of Chemical Safety 2010; Cao et al. 2010; Cao et al. 
2011; Lorber et al. 2015; Noonan et al. 2011; Schecter et al. 2010), and canned tuna and 
canned soup, especially condensed soup, tend to have higher BPA concentration values 
(Bureau of Chemical Safety 2010; Cao et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2011). We found most of these 
trends to be present in our models. Canned beverages did not have an association with 
urinary BPA concentrations (p-trend = 0.44). The consumption of more canned vegetables 
with a GM ratio (95% CI) of 1.42 (1.23 – 1.63) and canned soup with 2.29 (1.22, 4.30) were

 associated with higher urinary BPA concentrations. An unexpected trend found in our data 
was for canned fruit. Our initial analysis separated canned fruit into its own category due to 
the documented difference in can linings for fruit (Noonan et al. 2011; Oldring and Nehring 
2007). The industry practice, confirmed by Noonan’s laboratory, is for epoxy-phenolic 
coating to be absent on fruit can side walls, although there are sometimes coatings on the 
ends of the cans. Our model of canned fruit alone (not presented in Table 3), had a GM ratio 
(95% CI) of 1.23 (1.09, 1.39) for the consumption of one or more canned fruit versus none. 
This fruit model is based on a very small number of items (n=5), so this result may not be 
reflective of a real trend. For some analyses that stratified the data (e.g. the MEC 
appointment time sensitivity analysis) we could not determine the effect estimate for canned 
fruit only and we had to combine it with canned vegetables. For the same statistical 
reasoning, we combined tuna with meat in our final models. Our initial analysis separated 
canned tuna into its own category due to the reported high concentrations of BPA (Bureau of 
Chemical Safety 2010; Cao et al. 2010). Canned tuna alone (not presented in Table 3), had a 
GM ratio (95% CI) of 1.62 (1.13, 2.35), a positive association that was masked by our 
grouping with meat.
We considered the possible difference in urinary BPA concentration and canned food and 
beverage consumption by MEC appointment times. We conducted a sensitivity analysis 
comparing morning appointments (n=3605), afternoon appointments (n=2656), and evening 
appointments (n=1408). We found that the same trends existed for the morning and the 
afternoon appointments for the overall populations for all canned categories except for soup 
with a GM ratio (95% CI) of 1.77 (0.96, 3.25) for consumption of one or more servings of 
soup versus none for the morning appointments. The evening appointments exhibited the 
most deviation from the overall population trends, with canned food GM ratio (95% CI) of 
1.19 (0.97, 1.47), canned food and beverages with 1.04 (0.91, 1.19), canned pasta with 0.81 
(0.43, 1.53), and canned soup with 1.96 (0.77, 5.02) no longer being statistically significant. 
One explanation for this change in trend is that the evening appointment urinary BPA 
concentrations most likely reflected more recent consumption of BPA containing foods than 
food eaten on the previous day, as recorded in the 24-hour dietary recall.
To improve the dietary recall data’s ability to be used for environmental health food 
packaging studies, utilization of the USDA Food Codes Standard Reference (SR) Links may 
be a good starting point (USDA 2010). SR links describe the components of a food that were 
used to calculate nutritional analysis. For example, the food code 28340660 for “chicken or 
turkey vegetable soup, home recipe” is linked to 12 different SR items. These SR links often 
include canned food that would have been useful for canned food consumption analysis. The 
SR codes are rich with canned food links to USDA Food Codes: for 2003–2004, 1162 
canned food codes; for 2005–2006- 1130; and for 2007–2008- 1312 [data not shown]. In the 
case of chicken or turkey vegetable soup, this food code is linked to “tomato juice, canned, 
with salt,” SR code number 11540. The recipes associated with a food code can only be used 
for nutritional analysis and do not necessarily reflect what people actually consumed. SR 
codes for canned foods cannot be used to determine packaging. A preliminary study of SR 
links tested regression models that include the SR codes for canned foods into the analysis. 
No statistically significant associations were discovered, affirming the inability to use the SR 
codes for food packaging studies. If dietary recall data collected more information about

 food packaging similar to the details provided in SR codes, it might be possible to identify 
additional sources of canned food.
Our study using NHANES 2003–2008 data captures a crucial window of time in the use of 
BPA in the food system. BPA was authorized for use in all food applications at the time of 
the 2003–2008 NHANES utilized in this research. Starting in 2008, the BPA landscape 
started to shift more dramatically. In April 2008, Health Canada declared BPA to be a 
“dangerous substance” (Buka et al. 2009). Soon after, major manufacturers of polycarbonate 
plastic bottles abandoned the use of BPA and large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys-R-
Us, announced the phase-out of BPA containing baby bottles. May of this same year, the 
United States Congress requested that BPA be removed from infant formula packaging due 
to its health hazards. States started to introduce legislation to limit uses of BPA in food 
packaging in 2008 and, by 2009, over 20 states had introduced legislation to ban BPA in 
baby bottles and sippy cups (Houlihan et al. 2011; NCSL 2015). By January 2010, FDA had 
released a report expressing “some concern” for BPA in children’s products and cans. As 
BPA was being removed from packaging, there was an increase in the use of alternative 
bisphenols such as Bisphenol F (BPF) and Bisphenol S (BPS) that could be measured in 
humans (LaKind and Naiman 2015; Liao and Kannan 2013; Ye et al. 2015). Overall, the 
largest changes in BPA applications were in infant and toddler products, products not used 
by our sampled population of six years and older, with the official legislation to remove the 
use approval for BPA in PC baby bottles and sippy cups and in infant formula packaging 
occurring in 2012 and 2013 (FDA 2012, 2013). Our sampled time period and population 
could have been affected by the decision by some canned food manufacturers and reuseable 
water bottle manufacturers to use BPA alternatives. NHANES environmental phenol testing 
does not measure bisphenol analogues, so overall bisphenol exposure analyses cannot be 
conducted.
A future research recommendation for NHANES would be to enhance the current dietary 
and urinary biological data collection system. The first morning void should be collected on 
the same day that the 24-hour dietary recall is performed. Research has shown that this 
urinary sample would likely be capturing the previous night’s dinner exposure to BPA 
(Teeguarden et al. 2011). The short time frame between consumption and dietary recall 
collection could also improve the accuracy of the food consumption reported and enhance 
researchers’ ability to characterize BPA dietary exposure. As analogues of BPA are currently 
not measured in NHANES, future efforts to sample for BPA and its alternatives in packaging 
including BPF and BPS are needed to understand the current state of overall bisphenol 
exposure in the U.S. population. These suggested expansions in the NHANES data 
collection could be an important step in strengthening epidemiologic data about BPA 
exposures.
Conclusions
This analysis of NHANES dietary recall data showed that canned foods contribute to BPA 
exposure in the population of the United States, including both children and adults. Urinary 
BPA concentrations increased with the number of canned foods, and specifically with 
consumption of canned vegetable and fruit, pasta, and soup. Most of these trends mirror

 findings of laboratory studies that directly measured BPA concentration of canned food and 
beverages and confirm the importance of banning the use of BPA from those products to 
prevent dietary exposure to BPA.
