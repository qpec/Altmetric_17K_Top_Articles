OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of veterinary pharmaceutical-related exposures to 
children based on calls to a regional poison control center.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pediatric (≤19 years of age) exposures to 
pharmaceutical products intended for animal use, managed by a regional poison control 
center from 1999 through 2013, was conducted. Case narratives were reviewed and coded 
for exposure-related circumstances and intended species. Descriptive statistics were 
generated.
RESULTS: From 1999 through 2013, the Central Ohio Poison Center received 1431 calls that 
related to a veterinary pharmaceutical exposure for children ≤19 years of age. Most of the 
pediatric calls (87.6%) involved children ≤5 years of age. Exploratory behavior was the 
most common exposure-related circumstance (61.4%) and ingestion accounted for the 
exposure route in 93% of cases. Substances commonly associated with exposures included: 
veterinary drugs without human equivalent (17.3%), antimicrobial agents (14.8%), and 
antiparasitics (14.6%). Based on substance and quantity, the majority of exposures (96.9%) 
were not expected to result in long-term or lasting health effects and were managed at 
home (94.1%). A total of 80 cases (5.6%) were referred to a health care facility, and 2 cases 
resulted in a moderate health effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Children ≤5 years of age are most at risk for veterinary pharmaceutical-related 
exposures. Although most exposures do not result in a serious medical outcome, efforts 
to increase public awareness, appropriate product dispensing procedures, and attention 
to home storage practices may reduce the risk of veterinary pharmaceutical exposures to 
young children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: With 74.1 million 
US households owning at least 1 pet and one-
half of households with a child ≤19 years of age, 
unintentional pediatric exposure to pet medication 
may occur. No previous studies have examined these 
exposures. 
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study calls attention 
to the potential risk of pediatric poisonings from 
veterinary pharmaceutical products and highlights 
some opportunities for public health offi
 cials, 
pediatricians, pharmacists, and veterinarians to 
improve education to parents and other childcare 
providers.

Unintentional poisoning is one of 
the leading causes of injury and 
death among children ≤19 years 
of age. 
1 
 
– 
4 Each year in the United 
States, preventable poisonings 
in children result in >60 000 
emergency department visits and 
approximately one million calls to 
poison centers.5 
– 
7 Almost one-half 
(48%) of the annual calls to poison 
centers involve children ≤5 years of 
age. 
7, 
 
8 Young children are more likely 
to be exposed due to developmental 
changes, such as improved mobility, 
that allow them to explore and 
interact with their environment.8 
 
– 
11 
Additionally, parents and caretakers 
may underestimate the child’s ability 
and developmental stage, thus 
leaving toxic substances within reach 
of the child. 
8
One of the most common sources 
for poisonings among children is 
unintentional exposure to general 
pharmaceutical products. 
8, 
 
9 
According to the Association of 
American Poison Control Centers, 
children <6 years of age account for 
more than half of all unintentional 
pharmaceutical exposures. 
7, 
 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
–23 
Previous research has described 
common risk factors, such as 
improper storage of medication 
in handbags, on the counter, or in 
containers that allow easy access to 
children. 
9, 
 
11 Prevention strategies for 
reducing exposures include use of 
child-resistant containers, behavior 
modification through education, and 
regulations, such as requiring the 
use of child-resistant containers for 
topical products. 
11
Although previous veterinary 
pharmaceutical studies have focused 
on occupational hazards among 
veterinary health professionals, 
none have examined pediatric 
exposure. 
24 
 
 
–28 With nearly 63% of 
all US households, or 74.1 million, 
owning at least 1 pet and one-half of 
households with a child ≤19 years 
of age, the risk for exposure to pet 
medication is high. 
29 It is common 
for pets to be prescribed regular 
veterinary pharmaceutical 
products as preventives for 
internal and external parasites or 
to treat a chronic health condition, 
such as hypothyroidism or 
osteoarthritis. 
24, 
 
30 
– 
33 Additionally, 
acute health conditions for pets 
may require introducing new 
medications to a household for 
a short period of time. Some 
products used in veterinary practice 
are specifically developed for 
veterinary use, whereas others are 
human pharmaceutical products 
that have been prescribed for 
a veterinary patient. 
34, 
 
35 More 
recently, antineoplastic drugs, such 
as mitotane, cyclophosphamide, 
chlorambucil, and procarbazine as 
well as other highly toxic substances, 
have been prescribed more 
frequently to veterinary patients to 
treat a wider range of conditions. 
36
Veterinary pharmaceutical products 
are commonly administered by using 
techniques that aid in improving 
the likelihood of the animal 
receiving the proper dose such as 
mixing medication with food or 
compounding oral medication into a 
topical formula. While these delivery 
techniques are more convenient 
for the owner and the pet, previous 
studies have found they increase 
the likelihood of human exposure 
in occupational settings. 
36 It can be 
assumed that these same techniques 
used in households with young 
children may also increase the risk of 
pediatric exposure.
The purpose of this study was 
to describe the epidemiology of 
veterinary pharmaceutical exposures 
among children ≤19 years of age 
by examining help calls to a single 
regional poison center in the 
Midwest.
METHODS
Data from the Central Ohio Poison 
Center (COPC) were retrospectively 
analyzed to determine the 
epidemiologic characteristics and 
trends of pediatric (≤19 years 
of age) exposure to veterinary 
pharmaceuticals from January 1, 
1999 through December 31, 2013. 
The COPC, 1 of 55 poison centers 
that service the United States and its 
territories, provides free, confidential 
poison prevention, assessment, and 
treatment advice for central and 
southeastern Ohio residents. 
37
Case Selection Criteria
During the study period (1999–
2013), a total of 563 523 calls were 
placed to the regional poison center. 
A key word search of calls placed to 
the COPC was performed by using 
specific veterinary and animal-
related terminology (ie, veterinary, 
veterinarian, animal, pet, and pocket 
pet) and specific animal species 
(ie, dog, canine, pup, cat, kitten, 
reptile, snake, rabbit, rodent, etc). 
A total of 5298 potential cases were 
identified. Case narratives were 
individually reviewed by 1 author 
(ST) and confirmed by a second 
author (KJR) and coded for inclusion 
criteria, circumstance surrounding 
the exposure, and animal species, for 
which the pharmaceutical product 
was intended. Cases for exposure 
to pet food, rat poison, animal bite 
or scratch wounds, and animal 
ingestion of human medication 
were excluded. In addition, 15 cases 
were excluded due to intentional 
misuse, abuse, or suicide involving a 
veterinary pharmaceutical product. 
After reviewing the narratives, 2954 
cases met the inclusion criteria for 
human exposure to a veterinary 
pharmaceutical product, defined 
as a product prescribed for use in 
animals. Cases involving patients 
≥20 years of age were excluded 
(n = 1523). A total of 1431 cases, 
involving children ≤19 years of 
age, were retained and included 
in the analysis. For calls involving 
exposure to multiple substances, 
each substance was ranked by the 
Poison Center Specialist in order 
of its perceived contribution to the

reported clinical effects. We limited 
data analysis to the first substance 
ranked, which was judged to be the 
primary contributor.
Variables
Circumstances of exposure 
were coded into 4 categories: 
(1) mistaken identification (eg, 
inadvertent use of the veterinary 
product when intending to use a 
human medication), (2) exploratory 
behavior (eg, unintentionally 
obtained medication, for example, by 
climbing on the counter or searching 
through a bag and finding the pet’s 
medication), (3) unintentional 
delivery (eg, accidental exposure of 
a veterinary pharmaceutical product 
while attempting to medicate an 
animal), and (4) other (including 
when exposure circumstance 
was not specified). Cases were 
coded for animal species for 
which the prescribed medications 
were intended (ie, canine, feline, 
amphibian/reptile, small mammal/
pocket pets/ferrets, birds, fish, 
other, or not specified). Substance 
description categories were collapsed 
into 17 pharmaceutical classifications 
based on type of use, such as topical 
products or body system treated. 
For example, antivomiting and 
antidiarrheal medications were 
collapsed into the same category 
as gastrointestinal products. Age 
groups were existing categories 
coded by Poison Center Specialists 
(ie, nurses or pharmacists: ≤5 years, 
6–12 years, and 13–19 years of age). 
Medical outcomes was classified by 
Poison Control Specialists as no or 
minor effect (“minimally bothersome, 
rapidly resolving effects that 
usually involve the skin or mucous 
membranes”), not followed (judged 
as nontoxic exposures [clinical 
effects not expected] or minimal 
clinical effects possible [no more than 
minor effect possible]), unrelated 
effect, unable to follow (judged as 
potentially toxic exposure), and 
moderate effect (“more pronounced 
or more systemic in nature, 
treatment usually required, but not 
life threatening”). 
7
Using the National Poison Data 
Systems’ established definitions, 
other variables included patient’s 
sex, exposure site (eg, residence, 
other residence, workplace, other), 
management site (eg, managed on 
site [patient treated at home or at 
any other non–health care facility 
[HCF]), patient referred to a HCF, 
other/unknown), route of exposure, 
medical outcome, and level of health 
care received.
Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Considerations
Data were analyzed by using 
IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) 
software, and descriptive statistics 
were generated. This study was 
reviewed and deemed exempt by 
the Institutional Review Board at 
Nationwide Children’s Hospital 
(IRB13-00878).
RESULTS
General Characteristics
From January 1, 1999 through 
December 31, 2013, the COPC 
received 1431 pediatric (≤19 
years of age) calls regarding 
human exposure to veterinary 
pharmaceutical products, averaging 
95 pediatric exposure calls annually. 
The lowest number of pediatric 
veterinary pharmaceutical exposures 
(n = 56) occurred in 1999 and the 
highest number of exposures (n = 
112) occurred in 2006. Exposed 
children ranged from 1 month to 19 
years of age, with a mean age of 3.2 
years (SD, 3.7). Exposure was the 
highest among children ≤5 years of 
age, accounting for 87.6% of calls 
for pediatric exposure to veterinary 
pharmaceutical products ( 
Table 1). 
Boys accounted for 51.2% of all 
cases. The majority of exposures 
(88.0%) were related to veterinary 
pharmaceutical products intended 
for canine use. The most common 
route of exposure was ingestion 
(93.0%) followed by ocular (2.3%) 
and dermal (1.1%). The majority of 
exposures (96.4%) occurred at home, 
and 94.1% of all calls were managed 
on site without referral to an HCF.
Exposure Circumstance
The most common reason for 
exposure was exploratory behavior 
(61.4%) followed by unintentional 
delivery of medication (23.3%) (7.6% 
of calls did not have sufficient detail 
to determine the circumstances). 
Children ≤5 years of age accounted 
for the majority of exposures 
resulting from exploratory behavior 
and unintentional delivery (94.1% 
and 88.9%, respectively) ( 
Fig 1). 
Mistaken identification, although less 
common, occurred among children in 
all age groups, but especially among 
children 13 to 19 years old ( 
Fig 1). 
More than half (56.4%) of cases 
among children 13 to 19 years were 
classified as mistaken identification.
Substance Categories and Level of 
Care
The major substance categories 
associated with COPC calls 
included miscellaneous veterinary 
pharmaceutical products without 
human equivalent (17.3%), 
antimicrobial agents (14.8%), 
antiparasitics (14.6%), and 
analgesics (11.1%) ( 
Table 2). Over 
the study period, there were 80 
exposure calls (5.6%) that were en 
route or referred to a HCF, and the 
majority of these patients (88.8%) 
were ≤5 years of age and treated/
evaluated and released (60.0%). Of 
the cases en route or referred to a 
HCF, the most common veterinary 
pharmaceutical substances 
associated with the exposure 
included analgesics (17.5%), 
antiparasitics (12.5%), miscellaneous 
veterinary pharmaceuticals (12.5%), 
and anticonvulsants (10.0%).
In most cases, patients had no or 
minimally bothersome symptoms

TOMASI et al 
(49.1%) or did not require additional 
follow-up because the exposure 
was determined to be nontoxic or 
only minimal clinical effects were 
expected (47.9%). Of the cases with 
no or minor effects (n = 702), 99 
(14.1%) had a minor effect. Two 
cases were recorded as having a 
moderate medical outcome. The first 
moderate outcome case involved a 
3-year-old child who ingested the 
pharmaceutical product ivermectin, 
which is routinely used as an oral 
preventive for canine heartworm 
disease and requires a veterinary 
prescription. The second moderate 
outcome case involved a 9-month-
old child who ingested 100 mg of 
doxepin, a dibenzoxazepine tricyclic 
compound generally prescribed for 
canines with psychogenic dermatoses 
related to stress or anxiety. 
38
DISCUSSION
During the 15-year study period, 
there were 1431 calls to the COPC 
regarding pediatric exposure to a 
veterinary pharmaceutical product, 
with an average of 95 calls per 
year. The majority of cases involved 
children ≤5 years of age, occurred 
at home as a result of the child’s 
exploratory behavior, and resulted in 
no or minor health effects. Most cases 
were managed at home, and thus 
required significant health resources 
from the poison center, such as 
follow-up calls and time involved 
researching product safety efficacy.
Similar to previously published 
toxicology studies that investigated 
pediatric exposure to human 
pharmaceuticals, the children in 
our study experienced few adverse 
outcomes. 
2, 
 
4, 
 
8, 
 
9, 
39, 
 
40 Children 
are most commonly exposed to 
pharmaceutical toxic substances as 
a result of their exploration of their 
environment without the intention of 
causing self-inflicted harm; therefore, 
they are not typically exposed to dose 
ranges that could lead to moderate 
or major health effects. However, 
some prescriptions, both human and 
veterinary, could be highly dangerous 
even at low dosages, especially for 
small children.
Although pediatric exposure 
to veterinary pharmaceuticals 
may exhibit many of the same 
characteristics of pediatric exposure 
to human pharmaceuticals and other 
toxic substances, this study highlights 
some unique aspects associated 
with veterinary pharmaceutical 
product exposures. Knowledge 
of these unique circumstances 
could help health professionals 
expand preventive educational 
materials on toxic substances as 
well as more effectively organize

and manage future cases. For 
example, exploratory behavior is 
still an important circumstance 
that increases the risk of pediatric 
exposure, and therefore, veterinary 
pharmaceuticals should be stored 
with the same recommendations as 
human pharmaceuticals. 
41 However, 
unintentional delivery of medication 
is a common circumstance of 
veterinary pharmaceutical exposures 
that is not commonly associated 
with other pediatric exposures. 
Approximately one-fourth of the 
children in this study were exposed 
to a veterinary pharmaceutical 
during the process of attempting 
to administer the medication to 
animals. Common scenarios stated 
in the case narratives involved the 
pet spitting out the medication and 
the child retrieving it from the floor. 
Other narratives described that pet 
owners would mix the veterinary 
medications in food to encourage 
ingestion by the animal. Although this 
is a common practice recommended 
by veterinary health professionals for 
easier administration of veterinary 
medication to animals, it may 
also increase the risk of pediatric 
exposure because children can 
access the medication, especially if 
the animal does not ingest the food 
immediately. Providing guidance for 
mixing medication with food could 
include keeping it out of the child’s 
reach until ready to administer it to 
the pet and instructing owners to 
make sure that the pet finishes all 
the food before allowing the child 
to have contact with the pet or the 
food. For topical medications, health 
professionals could suggest the child 
not be present when administering 
medications to avoid accidental 
exposure. One alternative option 
could be to deliver pet medications 
after the child has gone to bed. 
Parents should also be instructed 
to give topical products time to dry 
before permitting the child to interact 
with the pet.
Mistaken identification was 
an important circumstance 
leading to exposure to veterinary 
pharmaceutical products, particularly 
in the 13- to 19-year-old age group. 
Older children may be responsible for 
administering their own medications 
as well as assisting with the family 
pet’s medications. These products 
can resemble human pharmaceutical 
products or be stored in similar 
child-resistant containers, leading to 
a simple confusion between products. 
Therefore, storing veterinary 
medications in a separate location 
from human medications may 
reduce the number of unintentional 
exposures due to mistaken 
identification. Users should also keep 
all products, including human and 
veterinary pharmaceutical products, 
in their original, child-resistant 
containers with the label attached.
Since the passing of the 1970 Poison 
Prevention Package Act (PPPA), US 
human pharmaceutical products are 
required to be dispensed in child-
resistant packaging to reduce the 
chance of pediatric exposure and 
decrease the volume of exposure 
to the toxic substance.

regulates special child-resistant 
packaging for any drug for human 
use that is intended for oral 
administration and is required by 
federal law to be prescribed by a 
licensed practitioner. 
4, 
 
5, 
 
34, 
40 Other 
than animal products that contain 
iron, the PPPA states no regulations 
over veterinary pharmaceutical 
products for oral administration. 
5, 
 
34, 
 
42 
However, most states, including 
Ohio, have state laws that regulate 
the dispensing of veterinary 
pharmaceutical products. 
34 In 
Ohio, drugs that are required to 
be prescribed by a licensed health 
professional must be labeled and 
packaged in accordance with state 
and federal drug laws. Although the 
federal child-resistant packaging 
laws specifically refer to human 
oral pharmaceutical products, 
under Ohio’s law, veterinarians who 
prescribe and dispense medications 
for their patients are required 
to obtain a Terminal Distributor 
of Dangerous Drugs license.43 
This license classifies veterinary 
pharmaceutical products as 
dangerous drugs, which then indicates 
oral veterinary products are to follow 
the same packaging, labeling, and 
record keeping regulations as human 
oral pharmaceutical products. 
44 On 
a national level, the use of child-
resistant packaging for all veterinary 
pharmaceutical products dispensed 
by veterinarians for at-home use is 
also recommended by the American 
Veterinary Medical Association’s 
Council on Biological and Therapeutic 
Agents. 
45
There are limited data on veterinary 
compliance with child-resistant 
packaging regulations. Although 
veterinarians are encouraged to 
dispense pharmaceutical products 
in child-resistant containers, actual 
compliance is unknown. There are 
numerous examples of products that 
may not be routinely dispensed in 
child-resistant containers, including: 
single doses of flea, tick, and 
heartworm prevention, injectable 
formulations of buprenorphine 
for feline mucosal administration, 
topical creams and ear medications, 
and liquid intestinal deworming 
medications. These medications are 
generally loaded into an oral syringe 
with a slip-on cap and placed in a 
plastic, sealable bag or are dispensed 
as a single blister pack dose in a plastic 
bag, both with the label on the outside 
of the bag. This type of packaging 
could easily lead to separation of the 
pharmaceutical product from the 
prescription label as well as allow easy 
access for a young child.
This study has limitations. Data were 
from a single poison center, which 
receives calls and handles cases 
from a limited geographical region 
in a Midwestern state. Obtaining 
data from a single regional poison 
center limits the ability to generalize 
the results for other regions of the 
United States and determine the true 
impact of veterinary pharmaceutical 
products in pediatric poisonings. 
Another potential limitation was 
the inconsistency with recording 
substance classifications. For 
example, 1 case with a moderate 
outcome listed the substance 
category as a nonpharmaceutical 
product when the narrative 
statement recorded that the child 
had ingested ivermectin in the form 
of canine heartworm prevention. 
Other examples include the 
inconsistency seen with recording 
other veterinary antiparasitic 
products, such as piperazine. Some of 
the poison control specialists coded 
these substances as antiparasitics, 
whereas others recorded the same 
pharmaceutical product in the 
miscellaneous veterinary drug 
without human equivalent category, 
demonstrating that poison control 
specialists are sometimes unfamiliar 
with some veterinary pharmaceutical 
product categories and their uses. 
Developing an inclusive veterinary 
pharmaceutical product guide for 
poison control specialists could aid 
with consistent coding of veterinary 
pharmaceutical substances and 
expedite the search for specific cases 
in future epidemiology studies. 
Finally, this study only reviewed data 
that were voluntarily provided to 
the COPC. Other pediatric veterinary 
pharmaceutical exposures might 
have sought medical care at other 
health care facilities or private 
physician offices without reporting 
the data to the COPC. Alternatively, 
some cases may have decided not 
to seek any form of medical advice 
or treatment. Therefore, this study 
may underestimate the impact of 
pediatric exposure to veterinary 
pharmaceutical products. Despite 
these limitations, this study is the 
first to our knowledge to examine 
pediatric exposure to veterinary 
pharmaceutical products.
CONCLUSIONS
To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to describe the epidemiologic 
characteristics of veterinary 
pharmaceutical products among 
children ≤5 years of age. Although 
the majority of exposures resulted in 
no or a minor health effects, efforts 
to prevent these types of injuries 
are still needed. Despite current 
pharmaceutical prevention efforts 
and packing regulations, parents 
and caregivers may not recognize 
the potential risk for veterinary 
pharmaceutical product exposures in 
their home. Prevention and education 
efforts should focus on appropriate 
product dispensing, home storage 
practices, and proper medication 
delivery to help reduce the risk of 
veterinary pharmaceutical exposure 
to young children.
