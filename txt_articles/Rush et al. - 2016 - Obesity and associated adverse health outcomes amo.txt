Cohort Study
Toni Rush1,2,3, Cynthia A. LeardMann3, and Nancy F. Crum-Cianflone1,3,4
Objective: To assess the prevalence of obesity and associated health outcomes among US service
members and veterans.
Methods: Data from three survey cycles (2001–2008) of the Millennium Cohort Study were used to
examine the prevalence of obesity and associated health outcomes.
Results: Of the 42,200 individuals, 25% were of normal weight in 2007/2008. Rates of obesity were sig-
nificantly higher among veterans (32%) compared with service members (20%). Over a 7-year period,
obesity rates doubled among both service members (10%–20%) and veterans (14%–32%). Participants
with obesity were significantly more likely to be male, older, less educated, in the Army or Navy, and sep-
arated/retired from the military. Hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea were significantly more common
among individuals with obesity compared with participants with normal weight (all P < 0.05). Individuals
with obesity also had significantly higher rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder than indi-
viduals with normal weight and had lower mental and physical functional scores (all P < 0.05).
Conclusions: These findings indicate an urgent need to enhance strategies for preventing and reducing
excess weight gain within the military and veteran populations. Such strategies should aim to ensure a fit
military force and promote health after military service.

Introduction
Obesity has become a national health crisis, with a nearly threefold
increase in prevalence (13%–36%) among the US general population
in the past decades (1,2). The consequences of obesity are multiple,
including adverse health outcomes, premature death, and associated
societal and psychosocial costs (3,4). Although weight and body com-
position standards must be met for accession and retention in the US
military, the military may not be immune to the ongoing obesity epi-
demic. Most national data on obesity are obtained through surveys of
the general population, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (5) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;
however, these surveys do not specifically sample military personnel.
Data on obesity among active duty military personnel have largely
been derived from serial cross-sectional surveys [i.e., the Department
of Defense (DoD) Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active
Duty Military Personnel] (6,7), while veteran data have often relied on
substudies using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (8,9).
While some studies have suggested that military members may have
lower rates of obesity compared with the general population (10), a
recent study indicated that the prevalence of overweight and obesity
rose from 50.6% to 60.8% among active duty service members
between 1995 and 2008 (7); however, these data were collected using
serial cross-sectional surveys and did not evaluate the same cohort
over time. A prospective investigation of body weight over time among
a sample of service members and veterans followed longitudinally,
examining factors associated with overweight/obesity, is needed.

Obesity
 Knowledge regarding the patterns of weight gain among service
members is not only important for understanding health and fitness
of the military force, but also the impact on society since military
members and veterans make up approximately 13% of the adult US
population (9). Hence, data on the prevalence and associated factors
of obesity among military populations are needed for informing both
military-specific and national preventive and health care programs.
We utilized data from the largest prospective study in US military
history, the Millennium Cohort Study, to describe the prevalence of
obesity among current and former service members over time and to
assess cross-sectional associations with health outcomes.
Methods
Study population
Designed to prospectively evaluate the health impact of serving in
the military, the Millennium Cohort Study launched in 2001 and
includes members from all service branches and components. The
first panel of the study was a probability-based sample of the entire
military population. Participants were randomly selected from US
military rosters, with over-sampling of selected subgroups of inter-
est, as previously described (11). All participants voluntarily agreed
to participate and gave informed consent.
Of the 77,047 participants who enrolled in the first panel and com-
pleted a baseline survey between 2001 and 2003 (referred to as the
2001 survey cycle), 55,021 (71%) completed the first follow-up
questionnaire (2004–2006; referred to as the 2004 survey cycle), and
54,790 (71%) members completed the second follow-up question-
naire (2007–2008; referred to as the 2007 survey cycle). Previous
studies have found the Millennium Cohort to be a representative
sample of service members not influenced to participate by poor
health, and analyses on weighting for nonresponse have not identi-
fied changes in metrics for mental disorders (12,13). For this analy-
sis, we evaluated participants who completed a baseline and two
follow-up surveys in order to assess BMI changes over time using
the same study population (n 5 46,437). Individuals missing body
weight or height data from the questionnaires were excluded
(n 5 4,237), yielding a total study population for the current analysis
of 42,200 participants.
Data sources
The Millennium Cohort survey includes self-reported height and
body weight measures from which BMI was calculated. The survey
also includes a comprehensive set of mental, physical, and func-
tional health questions. Demographic and military variables were
obtained from official military personnel files from the Defense
Manpower Data Center. Deployment data, including in and out of
theater dates,
were obtained
from electronic military records.
Deployment status was based on being deployed at least once in
support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan prior to completing
the 2007 survey. Military separation/retirement was determined
using official military personnel files provided by Defense Man-
power Data Center.
BMI was categorized (14) as underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), nor-
mal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and
obesity (�30 kg/m2). Underweight and normal weight were com-
bined, and referred to as normal, due to low numbers of individuals
who were underweight (<1%) in our cohort. BMI was calculated
for each survey time point and shown over three time periods.
The associations of obesity with physical, mental, and functional
health outcomes were examined using 2007 survey data. Physical
health outcomes included hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea, and
coronary heart disease (CHD). For each physical health outcome,
participants reported if they had been diagnosed by a doctor or
health professional in the last 3 years. In addition, the total number
of diagnosed medical conditions was determined by summing the
number of conditions endorsed from 40 possible conditions (e.g.,
depression, gallstones, fibromyalgia, migraines) and were catego-
rized as 0, 1, 2, and �3.
Mental health outcomes, which included post-traumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD) and depression, were based on self-report of either a
professional-diagnosed condition in the past 3 years or a positive
screen from a standard assessment measure on the 2007 survey.
The PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version is a 17-item measure of
PTSD symptoms interpreted according to the Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. A positive
PTSD screen was based on having a moderate or higher level of at
least one intrusion symptom, three avoidance symptoms, and two
hyperarousal symptoms (15,16). Corresponding to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, the nine
items of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was adminis-
tered to assess depression using the following two criteria: (1)
endorsement of a depressed mood or anhedonia; and (2) responding
“more than half the days” or “nearly every day” to at least five of
the nine items, where suicidal ideation was counted if present at
all (17,18).
Current levels of stress and worry were evaluated using 10 items—
including “worrying about your health” and “financial problems or
worries”—scored from 0 (not bothered at all) to 2 (bothered a lot)
from the PHQ (18). Categories for stress and worry were defined as
low (score of <15), moderate (score of 15–18), and high (score of
>18).
Functional health was assessed by the Physical Component Sum-
mary and Mental Component Summary scores that were calculated
from data obtained from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short
Form Health Survey, Veterans version. Higher scores for both the
Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary
represent better health (19). Continuous scores were collapsed into
three categories based on approximately 1 standard deviation (SD)
of the baseline scores from the mean, with “low” representing scores
below the 15th percentile and “high” representing scores above the
85th percentile (20). Somatic symptoms were assessed using the
PHQ
15-Item
Somatic
Symptom
Severity
Scale
(PHQ-15).
The PHQ-15 consists of 15 somatic symptoms scored from 0 (not
bothered at all) to 2 (bothered a lot). Scores of 15 or higher
(referred to as multiple somatic symptoms) have shown to be signif-
icantly associated with increased impairment and higher health care
utilization (21).

management and statistical analyses were conducted using SAS ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Study population characteristics and factors
associated with obesity
Among the 42,200 military members and veterans at the 2007 sur-
vey, the mean (SD) age was 42 (9.0) years, 74% were male, and
71% were non-Hispanic white. Seventy-five percent were on active-
duty service, while 25% had separated or retired from military serv-
ice [mean (SD) time since separation/retirement 5 3.8 (1.9) years].
Data from the 2007 survey demonstrated that 210 (<1%) partici-
pants were underweight, 10,752 (26%) were normal weight, 21,452
(51%) were overweight, and 9,786 (23%) had obesity.
Participants with obesity were proportionately more likely to be
male, older, non-Hispanic black less educated, in the Army or Navy,
nondeployers, and separated/retired from the military (Table 1). For
example in 2007, 20% of current service members had obesity com-
pared with 32% of veterans (P < 0.001). There was no significant
change in the percentage of obesity among veterans when the time
since separation from the military was divided into periods of <1
year, 1 to 3 years, and >3 years since separation (30%, 31%, and
32%, respectively), suggesting that the increase in obesity may occur
close to the time of military separation.
Obesity and body weight change trends
over time
The mean BMI of the study population significantly increased dur-
ing the study timeframe: 26.1 kg/m2 in 2001, 26.8 kg/m2 in 2004,
and 27.5 kg/m2 in 2007 (P < 0.0001). Data, stratified by gender and
service status (current vs. former service members), showed that the
percentage of service members with obesity (�30 kg/m2) increased
over time among each of the four groups, with the female and male
veteran groups having the largest increases (8%–26% and 16%–
35%, respectively). The percentage of service members/veterans
who were of normal weight or underweight (<25 kg/m2) diminished
over time (Figure 1).
Similar to BMI changes over time, the study population had a mean
(SD) body weight change of 14.1 (6.9) kg during the 2001 to 2007
study period. Overall, 35% of service members/veterans gained 3%
to 10% of their body weight, while 22% gained more than 10% of
their body weight between 2001 and 2007. Females and males had a
mean (SD) weight increase of 4.5 (7.3) kg and 4.0 (6.8) kg,
respectively.
Associations between obesity and
health outcomes
In cross-sectional analysis using weighted data from the 2007 survey
cycle, participants with obesity were significantly more likely to
report having hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea, and CHD, com-
pared with individuals with normal weight (all P < 0.001; Table 2).

 with �3 medical conditions compared with normal weight individu-
als (24% vs. 12%; P < 0.001; Table 1). Participants with obesity
were also more likely to screen positive for mental health condi-
tions, including depression and PTSD (P < 0.0001), and multiple
somatic symptoms (P < 0.0001; Table 2). Finally, those with obesity
had lower mental and physical functional health scores, and more
self-reported life stressors/worries compared with normal weight
individuals (all P < 0.0001; Table 2).
Discussion
This study provides data on obesity trends among military service
members and veterans, indicating a doubling of the prevalence
between 2001 and 2007. Although the prevalence of obesity was
lower among service members compared with the general US popu-
lation (2007: 20% vs. 34%) (1), veterans had a nearly identical rate
(32%), demonstrating the propensity for excessive weight gain
around the time of leaving the military. This study also demon-
strated an association between obesity and numerous adverse physi-
cal, mental, and functional health outcomes in this relatively young
cohort. The high prevalence of obesity and associated adverse health
effects indicate the need to enhance strategies for preventing excess
weight gain within military and veteran populations.
Our study demonstrated that military personnel, even during service
time, are susceptible to weight gain and development of obesity.
Data from the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors showed that
obesity increased from 9% to 13% between 2002 and 2005 and
remained elevated (13% in 2008) (6,7). Our study confirmed this
rising trend using confidential survey data and demonstrated a con-
tinuing rise in prevalence of obesity among current service members
(10% in 2001–2003, 15% in 2004–2006, and 20% in 2007–2008).
Findings from our veteran sample provide an even more concerning
trend—despite being out of the service for only a mean of 3.8 years,
veterans had a similar prevalence of obesity compared with the gen-
eral population. Previous studies also demonstrated that veterans
have similar or higher rates of obesity compared with nonveterans,
but these studies often evaluated individuals long after leaving mili-
tary service (8,9,22-24). Previous findings from the Millennium
Cohort suggest that veterans often gain excess weight near the time
of discharge, thus highlighting a critical time for the implementation
of preventive strategies (25). This association between weight gain
and separation from the military indicates that having served in the
US military does not protect against subsequent obesity—perhaps
some of this may be a result of the military’s weight maintenance
programs (including mandatory biannual weight checks and fitness
testing) being based on negative consequences rather than the inter-
nalization of standards for healthy living.
Our data also revealed an increasing prevalence of obesity among
veterans over the past decade. A study of veterans in 2004 showed
that 25% of male and 21% of female veterans with obesity (8), and
our data showed a continued progression of these obesity rates
(25%–34% for male veterans and 19%–26% for female veterans in
2004–2006 and 2007–2008, respectively). These data are important
for the overall health of the nation, as military personnel (in particu-
lar veterans) comprise a sizable proportion of the US population,
with a notable increase in the number of veterans since the Iraq and

 Afghanistan conflicts (3,22). These study findings demonstrate high
obesity rates in veterans despite having experienced both environ-
mental and cultural factors that promote healthy body weight while
in the military.
Excessive body weight does not exist in isolation, but has important
consequences for the health and well-being of the individual.
Despite evaluating a young, otherwise healthy, population, this study
demonstrated significant relationships between obesity and several
physical health outcomes, including hypertension, diabetes, CHD,
and sleep apnea. In prior studies using Millennium Cohort data,
many of these outcomes were significantly associated with obesity
(e.g., diabetes, CHD, Achilles tendinitis, and plantar fasciitis) after
adjustment for demographic, behavioral, and military characteristics
(26-28). Other studies in the general population have identified other
physical health conditions that have been associated with obesity,
including dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancers
(e.g., endometrial, breast, colon) (4,29,30).
Similar to previous studies, our study also showed significant cross-
sectional relationships between obesity and mental health conditions,
including depression and PTSD (3,31,32). Using data from the Mil-
lennium Cohort Study, a recent study found that PTSD was associated
with a subsequent 3-year weight gain and the development of obesity
(33). Mental health illnesses may result in unhealthy dietary habits in
response to stress or emotional regulation; poor physical activity hab-
its; use of medications that cause weight gain; and/or neuroendocrine
changes that contribute to obesity. It is also possible that obesity may
predispose to the development of mental health conditions (5).
Although several studies in the general population have described
demographic groups at highest risk for obesity, military data are
more limited. Our study found that female service members and vet-
erans were less likely to have obesity than their male counterparts.
This contrasts with national data showing that, in 2007 to 2008,
36% of women had obesity compared with 32% of men (34).
Although, women may under-report their body weight and may have
higher body fat than demonstrated by BMI (35), these factors likely
do not explain the differences in obesity between military and civil-
ian women. It is possible that females who have joined the military
have specific attributes toward physical fitness and weight mainte-
nance compared with their civilian counterparts.
Similar to other studies, we found that increasing age was associated
with obesity (5,6), which may be the result of progressive accumula-
tion of small weight increases over time. We also found that blacks
had higher rates of obesity despite having similar access to health
care and food services within the military setting.
Regarding military-specific characteristics, those in a health care
occupation and prior deployers were proportionally less likely to
have obesity. The Army and Navy had a higher prevalence of obe-
sity, while the Marine Corps had the lowest, similar to results of
DoD surveys (36). Further examination showed that the percentage
of obesity was lower in each age category for the Marines, indicat-
ing that there are likely service-related differences. The types of
people who join and type of work performed in each service may
contribute to different rates of obesity. For example, rates of obesity
by the service branch may be related to differences in behaviors,
such as smoking and exercise habits.
Obesity’s impact on the military has been described as a national
security risk (37). The obesity epidemic has affected the number of
eligible recruits (38) as the military recruits come from a population
with increasing obesity rates. After military entry, excess weight
contributes to early discharges prior to completion of service term,
amounting to costs of $60 million per year (37). Among those who
remain in service, obesity may negatively affect career progression
(e.g., promotion or selection for professional military schools) and
deployability. Finally, there are additional costs associated with
service-connected disabilities, decreased productivity, absenteeism,
and premature mortality (5).
While the military and veteran leaders are currently addressing
many of the concerns mentioned above, the present data are impor-
tant for informing programs and policies that specifically aim to
address obesity and overall health behaviors among US service
members and veterans. For example, the Performance Triad imple-
mented by the US Army Surgeon General addresses some of these
issues by using public health initiatives that focus on quality sleep,
activity engagement, and improved nutrition (see www.armymedi
cine.mil for more information). In addition, other DoD programs
(e.g., Operation Live Well) focus on active lifestyles and healthy
eating habits (see www.health.mil/livewell). Such programs may
benefit
from this
study’s findings, in conjunction
with other
research, to strengthen their program aims and goals. Military serv-
ice time and transition out of the military represent critical times for
establishing lifelong healthy behaviors, which could not only ensure
a fit force but also reduce post-service-related costs for the DoD,
Department of Veterans Affairs, and US health care system, as well
as enhance the quality of life for thousands of veterans.
Several study limitations should be noted. We utilized self-reported
data provided on confidential surveys, which may misclassify some
individuals due to misreporting weight and height measurements
(39). However, when self-reported weight from the Millennium
Cohort questionnaire was compared with fitness records within 60
days of each other among a sample of Air Force personnel, 75%
reported weight within 3% of the weight recorded on their fitness
record. We utilized BMI as an estimate of body fat, but this measure
may be influenced by muscle mass. For this article, our research
team specifically focused on obesity; however, we also reported
weight changes (kg) over time. Researchers have found that BMI is
an adequate measure to assess excessive weight and its associated
morbidities in population studies (5,40).
Another potential limitation is that we evaluated military members
who were in the service during 2000; hence, our study did not
include more recent military accessions. However, this approach
allowed for longitudinal assessments of BMI trends among service
members and veterans utilizing the same population—a notable limi-
tation of prior studies (6,10). In addition, it was not possible to
assess weight change in survey nonresponders who were generally
younger, less educated, and more likely to have left the military
(13); such characteristics may have underestimated obesity rates in
our study. While our study population may not be representative of
the overall military or veteran population, analyses were weighted
based on the age and sex of the overall military population. The
reported prevalence rates are unadjusted, which could overestimate
or underestimate obesity in some groups by not adjusting for varia-
bles such as smoking and physical exercise. Finally, our study
examined the cross-sectional associations of BMI and various health

 outcomes; future longitudinal studies that examine the trajectories of
body weight over time and long-term health outcomes are planned.
In summary, this is the first study to prospectively follow a large
cohort of military members and veterans during 2001 to 2007 and
describe obesity trends and associated health outcomes. Although
active duty military members were less likely to have obesity com-
pared with civilians, this rapidly reversed after separation from mili-
tary service, with veterans being as likely to have obesity as civil-
ians. These results can be used to inform both DoD and Veterans
Affairs leadership of the current obesity rates and trends in both
service member and veteran populations. Given the associations of
obesity with multiple adverse physical, mental, and functional health
outcomes in this relatively young cohort, body weight management
strategies should stand as a DoD and national priority.O
