Introduction: Advocates of human maternal placentophagy report that encapsulated placenta is an excellent source of dietary iron. Our study
compared the effect of ingested encapsulated placenta on maternal postpartum iron status versus that of a beef placebo.
Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study (N = 23) was conducted among healthy human research participants
experiencing a normal pregnancy. Maternal iron status was measured via hemoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin taken from blood samples drawn
in the participants’homes at 4 time points: the 36th week of pregnancy, within 96 hours of parturition, between days 5 and 7 postpartum, and
during week 3 postpartum. Iron concentrations in the encapsulated placenta and encapsulated beef placebo were compared using inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
Results: Seventy-eight percent (18/23) of study participants’hemoglobin concentrations were above the World Health Organization cutoff for
gestational iron deficiency (� 11.0 g/dL) during the 36th week of pregnancy. Results revealed no statistically significant differences (hemoglobin,
P = .603; ferritin, P = .852; transferrin, P = .936) in maternal iron status (including postpartum iron rebound in the first week postpartum)
between women in the placenta supplement (n = 10) and placebo (n = 13) groups. Average iron concentrations were considerably higher in
encapsulated placenta (0.664 mg/g) compared to the encapsulated beef placebo (0.093 mg/g) but provided only 24% of the recommended daily
allowance (RDA) for iron among lactating women based on the study’
s maximum daily intake.
Discussion: The current study suggests that encapsulated placenta supplementation neither significantly improves nor impairs postpartum
maternal iron status for women consuming the RDA of dietary iron during pregnancy and lactation, compared to a beef placebo. This may be an
especially important finding for women who are iron deficient postpartum and whose only source of supplemental dietary iron is encapsulated
placenta, as this may provide an inadequate source of supplemental iron in cases of deficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, the practice of human maternal placenta ingestion,
known as placentophagy, has gained popularity among
women in industrialized societies, who cite its many pur-
ported health benefits. As the practice has become more
common, increasingly human placentophagy appears to
be spreading from home birth settings to hospital births.1
Advocates of this practice cite the ubiquity of placentophagy
among mammals generally and note the hypothesized
adaptive value of the behavior for mammalian mothers put
forward by scientists (eg, maternal pain reduction, increased
milk production, postpartum nutrition). For human mothers,
many placentophagy practitioners and advocates believe the
practice results in a host of benefits, including increased
energy, and improved and more rapid postpartum recovery,
among others.1–3
It is possible that some of the benefits purported by
maternal placentophagy advocates are related to the iron
content in full-term placentas4 that may help restore iron
depleted during birth. Many pregnant and postpartum

women are advised by medical professionals to take iron
supplements in order to prevent or reverse iron deficiency
and iron-deficiency anemia.5 Iron deficiency and its more
serious manifestation, iron-deficiency anemia, are character-
ized mainly by fatigue, followed by additional symptoms of
pallor, weakness, labored breathing, headache, palpitations,
and dizziness.6 Iron-deficiency anemia has been shown to
impair cognitive performance, lead to emotional instability,
and increase the risk of postpartum depression.7,8
The increased dietary iron requirements associated with
pregnancy are reflected in the higher recommended daily
allowance (RDA) for iron among pregnant (27 mg/day),
compared to nongravid (18 mg/day) and lactating (9 mg/day)
women aged 19 to 50.9 Because of these increased demands,
iron status often falls during pregnancy. Iron-deficiency
anemia during gestation is defined by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as hemoglobin concentrations less
than 11.0 g/dL10 and represents the median cutoff value
for postpartum anemia among various researchers.11 Iron
deficiency during pregnancy and postpartum is a significant
global health problem.12 In Western industrialized countries,
iron deficiency is estimated to affect 25% to 40% of pregnant
women13 and 14% to 24% of women one week postpartum.11
The placenta is a highly vascularized, iron-rich organ.4
Placentophagy advocates propose that ingesting the organ

 ✦ One of the many purported benefits of human maternal placentophagy is the excellent source of dietary iron placenta
provides postpartum mothers.
✦ Typical daily intakes of encapsulated human placenta provide only very modest amounts of dietary iron, and affect post-
partum maternal iron status no differently than a beef placebo.
✦ Encapsulated placenta is an insufficient source of iron for women who are iron deficient postpartum.
in any form (eg, raw, cooked, dried and encapsulated) pro-
vides an excellent source of dietary iron (and perhaps even
a preferred iron source) needed by postpartum women.2,3
Many new mothers choose to ingest their placenta as a natural
alternative to hormone and nutrient supplements.2 Owing to
its improved bioavailability, heme (ie, animal source) iron, in
particular, may be an important component of these placenta
supplements, potentially providing improved recovery from
depleted iron stores compared to standard, nonheme (ie,
plant source) iron supplements.6
The aim of the current pilot study was to compare the iron
status of women ingesting their own encapsulated placenta to
those ingesting a dehydrated and encapsulated beef placebo
over a 3-week postpartum period among women participating
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial.
METHODS
Design
The present study was part of a larger randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled pilot project investigating the
effects of placentophagy on maternal postpartum affect, re-
covery, and a select hormonal profile; this analysis is limited
to results addressing maternal postpartum iron status.
Participant Recruitment
Study participant volunteers were required to be healthy,
pregnant females aged older than 18 years who had previously
decided to ingest their placentas postpartum. Potential partic-
ipants were excluded from the study if they had experienced
any serious pregnancy complications, ever ingested hu-
man placenta in the past, or used drugs, smoked tobacco, or
consumed alcohol at the time of enrollment. Given the partic-
ipants’prior decision to engage in maternal placentophagy, all
potential participants were informed that because the study
was placebo controlled and double blind, there was a 1-in-2
chance that they would not be assigned to the encapsulated
placenta group and would instead receive a placebo.
Potential participants were informed about the study
via web page or social media pages for a local organization
that provides placenta encapsulation services and informa-
tion (Placenta Benefits LTD) or by word-of-mouth via the
professional network of midwives and physicians associated
with this organization. Interested women were provided with
contact information for a research team member who could
then provide more information and answer any questions
about the study and could schedule the first meeting with the
research team.
This study was approved by the University of Nevada, Las
Vegas’(UNLV’
s) institutional review board and institutional
biosafety committee. In part, because the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) does not regulate human placenta
when it is processed in a woman’
s home and for her own
consumption, the study was designated as exempt from the
FDA’
s requirements regarding an investigational new drug
(IND) and trial registration requirements as a controlled
clinical investigation. In addition, per FDA guidelines, an
essential nutrient deficiency (eg, scurvy, pellagra, iron de-
ficiency) is not considered a disease for which treatment or
prevention requires IND approval.
Participant Procedures
Active data collection for this study occurred between De-
cember 2013 and March 2015. Participants met with 2 female
research assistants on 4 separate occasions. Table 1 provides a
participant placenta-placebo supplement schedule, including
supplement dosage.
Time 1
Potential participants contacted a research team member
via phone or e-mail and were given information about the
study, including inclusion and exclusion criteria and the
study timeline, and any questions they had were answered
by the researcher. Those who believed they met the inclusion
criteria and were interested in participating in the study
scheduled an initial meeting with 2 research team members
during the 36th week of pregnancy. During this meeting,
potential participants provided written informed consent
and were then asked to complete a screening and background
information questionnaire. Those who met the inclusion
criteria for the study provided a blood sample. All blood
samples for the first participant meeting were collected in
participants’homes or in the Metabolism, Anthropometry,
and Nutrition Laboratory at UNLV, and all but one were
collected in the morning or early afternoon (before 1 pm).
Approximately 0.6 mL of blood was collected through a
finger-stick blood draw into a capillary blood collection
lithium heparin tube and placed in an ice-pack cooler. Blood
samples were centrifuged at 2000xg, room temperature, for
5 minutes, no more than 4 hours after collection. Plasma from
each sample was then pipetted into microcentrifuge tubes and
stored at -40°C until they were shipped with dry ice to a labo-
ratory for analysis. An additional 0.03 mL (0.015 mL × 2 mea-
surements) of blood was collected for immediate hemoglobin
analysis. In instances where the 2 measurements differed, the
mean average of the 2 hemoglobin values were used.

Meeting 4.
Time 2
Within 4 days (96 hours) of parturition, the placenta en-
capsulation process was completed and the second meeting
occurred. At this meeting, the participant provided a blood
sample for analysis of hemoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin,
the participant was provided with capsules containing her de-
hydrated placenta or a beef placebo, and dosage instructions
were given.
Encapsulation Procedure
The encapsulation process occurred over an approximately
12-hour period, and during this time, the encapsulation
provider met with the participant twice for approximately
one hour, first to begin the process and next to complete
the encapsulation procedure. Where possible, the second
meeting with the research team members was scheduled
during one of the 2 times when the placenta encapsulation
provider was in the participant’
s home preparing the capsules.
Upon arrival at the participant’
s home, the encapsulation
provider began the encapsulation procedure by rinsing the
preserved placenta in water. Placentas from women giving
birth at home were typically refrigerated before encapsulation
processing, while placentas from women giving birth at the
hospital were typically frozen before processing. Next, the
placenta was steamed until the internal temperature reached
71°C (160°F). It was then dried approximately 8 to 10 hours
in a food dehydrator. While the placenta was dehydrating,
the encapsulation provider left the participant’
s home and
returned once the placenta was fully desiccated to pulverize
and homogenize the dehydrated tissue in a food processor
and encapsulate the resulting granulated tissue according to
the standard practices of Placenta Benefits LTD, the organiza-
tion that provided encapsulation services.14 The participants
were supplied with their own processed and encapsulated
placenta or an encapsulated placebo made of organic, grass-
fed, dehydrated beef, prepared in the same fashion as the
placenta supplements. Dehydrated beef was selected as the
placebo in the study for its similar appearance to that of
dehydrated and pulverized placenta and as a comparison to
human placenta as a supplement-based heme dietary iron
source. Participants were then instructed to take two 550 mg
capsules 3 times per day for days 1 to 4, two 550mg capsules
2 times per day for days 5 to 12, and two 550mg capsules
once per day from day 13 to the completion of the study
(approximately day 20). The 3300 mg/day maximum dosage
(days 1-4), follows recommendations of the encapsulation
provider,15 as well as a placenta medicinal-use text by
Enning,16 and is consistent with the median Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) dosage recommendation (3000
mg) for powdered zi he che (dried human placenta) found in
the TCM Materia Medica.17
Group assignment to placenta or placebo was based
on the results of a web-based, computerized number ran-
domizer. Neither the participant nor the researchers having
direct contact with the participant knew which capsule type
was supplied. Only the study principal investigator (PI) had
access to the randomization results, and the PI did not have
any direct contact with study participants. The participants’
group assignment was revealed to the encapsulation provider
only upon completion of placenta processing and encapsu-
lation in the participant’
s home. At this juncture, participants
received identical-looking containers of capsules containing
either their own encapsulated placenta or the encapsulated
beef placebo. (Pre-prepared containers of encapsulated beef
placebo were provided to the encapsulation provider in each
participant’
s home by a research team member.) The encap-
sulation provider had no direct contact with the participant
after learning the group assignment; the capsule containers
were simply left for the study participant by the encapsula-
tion provider after dosage instructions were provided. The
placenta or placebo capsules that were not assigned to the
study participant were transported to and stored in a locked
laboratory freezer by study researchers until the conclusion
of the study.
Time 3
The third meeting occurred between the fifth and seventh
days postpartum, where the participant completed a food
frequency questionnaire about her dietary intake over the
past year, including dietary supplements taken, and provided
a blood sample for hemoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin
analysis. Participants’ dietary iron intake was assessed via
administration of the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire
referring to the previous 12 months.18
Time 4
The fourth and final meeting occurred during the third week
postpartum (between days 21 and 27) where participants pro-
vided a blood sample for hemoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin
analysis. At the conclusion of this meeting, the participant
was debriefed and her group assignment was revealed. If she
was assigned to the placebo group, her placenta capsules were
returned to her at this time. Participants were compensated
for their time with an $80 gift card to their choice of a local
retailer; their choice of the following service, worth anywhere
from $50 to $80: housecleaning services, meal delivery,
or grocery delivery; and placenta encapsulation services
(approximate value of $300).
Assessment of Iron Status
Iron status was assessed via hemoglobin, transferrin, and fer-
ritin levels in participant blood samples.12,19 In iron-replete
individuals, the majority of iron (� 70%) is considered
functional iron, with the remaining 30% existing as transport

3
 or storage forms. The vast majority of functional iron exists as
hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying metalloprotein in red blood
cells. Hemoglobin concentration in blood is often used to
assess iron status and to screen for iron deficiencies.20 In the
current study, hemoglobin was measured in whole blood and
analyzed on site in the participant’
s home using a STAT-Site
(Stanbio; Boerne, TX) hemoglobin meter; expected values for
adult females range between 11.0 and 18.0 g/dL.21 Ferritin,
the intracellular protein that constitutes the primary storage
form of iron, is regularly used in clinical settings to identify
depleted iron stores. Transferrin, a glycoprotein that binds
iron, serves to transport iron in the bloodstream. When func-
tional iron stores are depleted, transferrin levels increase as
iron stores are mobilized into circulation.20 ZRT Laboratory
(Beaverton, OR) analyzed for plasma transferrin and ferritin
via immunoassay drawn from finger-stick capillary blood
samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA) for transferrin
and ferritin were used, with the following expected values:
transferrin, 202 to 364 mg/dL; and ferritin (women aged
17-60 years), 13 to 150 ng/mL.22 Samples were analyzed
using the Immulite Expand (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics,
Tarrytown, NY) immunoassay autoanalyzer.
Statistical Analyses
Given the longitudinal nature of the data, a repeated-measures
analysis was conducted using a mixed-model approach.
When data did not meet the assumptions of sphericity, the
Greenhouse-Geisser estimate was used as a robust approxi-
mation to the F-test. All modeling analyses were conducted
in IBM SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
When data represent multiple measurements on the same
individuals, statistical power is less impacted by relatively
small sample sizes. However, to be thorough, we further
calculated robust effect sizes using Hedges’g.23 These effect
sizes provide a measure of magnitude representing the
standardized differences observed between the placebo and
placenta group, with larger values indicating that a larger
relative difference was observed. Effects were calculated at
each time period for each protein for the difference between
placebo and placenta means. Interpretation of these effect
sizes is represented by a magnitude of difference such that
0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 represents a moderate effect,
0.8 represents a large effect, and 1.3 represents a very large
effect.24,25 In other words, the larger the effect size between
means at each time point, the larger the actual magnitude of
difference between the study groups. Effect sizes, along with
P values, provide for more readily interpretable results than
P values alone when sample sizes are small, or when absolute
mean difference are meaningful for practical interpretation
of results. Effect sizes were calculated using the Ellis applet
online effect size calculator.26
RESULTS
Participant Demographics
A total of 36 women enrolled in the study. Of these, 9
participants withdrew or were excluded from the study—5
from the placenta group and 4 from the placebo group.
A total of 23 participants are included in the present analysis
(n = 10 placenta group; n = 13 placebo group) (Figure 1).
Participants were primarily white, educated, married, and
with higher income. The demographic profile of participants
in the current study is largely consistent with that of other
published research of women who have engaged in maternal
placentophagy in the past.1 Detailed participant demographic
information can be found in Table 2.
Iron-Deficient and Iron-Replete Status of
Participants in Placenta and Placebo Groups
Based on hemoglobin concentrations and WHO11 cutoff
values for anemia during gestation, 22% (5/23) of study
participants were iron deficient (�11.0 g/dL) during the 36th
week of pregnancy. Of these, 3 (13%) were in the placenta
group, and 2 (9%) were in the placebo group. Similarly, during
meetings 2 through 4, the proportion of women below the
11.0 g/dL cutoff for postpartum iron deficiency11 was slightly,
but consistently, higher in the placenta group, compared to the
placebo group (see Supporting Information: Appendix S1).
Dietary Iron Intake
Estimates of study participant iron intake included daily
dietary and diet supplement iron sources but not iron that
may have been provided by the placenta or placebo sup-
plement administered during the course of this study (see
Supporting Information: Appendix S2). Based on data from
the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire, only one of the
study’
s 23 participants was not meeting the RDA for iron
during pregnancy. Table 1 includes estimated mean daily
total, heme, and nonheme iron intakes for study participants.
Hemoglobin
Within-participant analysis of hemoglobin data for placenta
and placebo groups showed a statistically significant (F =
15.520, P � .0001) change over the 4 time periods (Figure
2A). There was a decrease in hemoglobin at meeting 2,
followed by an improvement in hemoglobin at meetings 3
and 4. However, the interaction of hemoglobin and condition
was not significant (F = 0.440, P = .603). In other words, the
hemoglobin of the placenta and placebo groups changed over
time but changed in similar ways. Effect sizes ranged from
small to moderate, with absolute magnitudes of 0.27, 0.50,
0.69, and 0.58 across the 4 time periods, respectively.
Transferrin
Within-participant analysis of transferrin data for pla-
centa and placebo groups also shows a statistically significant
(F = 50.868, P �.0001) change over time (Figure 2B). As with
hemoglobin, however, the interaction of transferrin and con-
dition was not significant (F = 0.082, P = .936), meaning
once again that placenta and placebo groups changed
significantly over time but changed in a parallel fashion.
Between-participant effects show that the average difference
between placenta and placebo groups was not statistically
significant (F = 2.699, P = .115). Moderate effect sizes were

Ferritin
Within-participant analysis of ferritin data revealed a similar

data were Log10transformed prior to analysis in order to
satisfy the normality assumption of the statistical tests. These
results also show a steady increase of ferritin over time, indi-
cating improved iron status over the 3-week period. However,
the interaction of ferritin and condition was once again not
statistically significant (F = 0.121, P = .852). Small effect sizes
were present in the data, with absolute magnitudes of 0.33,

DISCUSSION
Pregnancy, birth, and the peripartum period present consid-
erable physiologic challenges to women. Iron deficiency is
often a by-product of the demands associated with human
reproduction. Iron deficiency can be particularly problematic
for women with short interbirth intervals, those who do
not exclusively breastfeed, are obese, or are low-income
individuals.27,28 Iron deficiency can also negatively affect
the children of women who are iron deficient.29–32 Cur-
rently, many maternal placentophagy advocates claim that
encapsulated placenta is an excellent source of iron for
postpartum women.2,3 To date, however, there have been no
rigorous scientific studies that have investigated this or other
health benefit claims associated with human placentophagy,
although several calls for carefully conducted scientific
investigations of the practice have recently been made by
researchers.1,33,34
Clinical studies have shown that, even among iron-
replete pregnant women, maternal iron levels (measured
as hemoglobin concentration) typically drop immediately
postpartum (within 24 to 48 hours) and then rebound within
7 days.11,35 Serum or plasma ferritin also typically increases
by the end of the first week postpartum. By contrast, serum
or plasma transferrin is typically inversely associated with
iron stores; transferrin levels usually elevate in response to
iron deficiency immediately after birth and then decrease in
response to iron repletion in postpartum weeks one through
8.11 Contrary to some claims by maternal placentophagy
advocates, our results did not reveal improved iron rebound
in the first 3 weeks postpartum among participants con-
suming placenta capsules compared to those taking a beef
placebo.
The results of this study provide some of the very first
clinical data regarding the effects of human maternal placen-
tophagy on human postpartum physiology and postpartum
maternal iron status. The current study suggests that encap-
sulated placenta supplementation (two 550 mg capsules 3
times per day for days one to 4, two 550mg capsules 2 times
per day for days 5 to 12, and two 550mg capsules once per day
for days 13 to 21 postpartum) neither significantly improves
nor impairs postpartum maternal iron status for women
consuming at least adequate amounts of dietary iron during
pregnancy and the peripartum period, compared to a beef
placebo. This is the case, even though laboratory analyses
revealed a considerably higher average concentration of iron
in the study placenta capsules versus that of the beef placebo.
Iron concentrations were determined for the contents of both
participant placenta and beef placebo capsules using induc-
tively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (methods described
in detail elsewhere).36 The average iron concentration of the
participant placenta capsules was 0.664 mg/g, while the iron

 concentration of the beef placebo capsules was 0.093 mg/g,
representing a 7-fold higher concentration in the placenta
capsule content. The average amount of iron this provided pla-
centa group participants, however (based on the study’
s max-
imum daily intake of 3300 mg/day), was only 2.2 mg/day, or
roughly 24% of the RDA for iron among lactating women aged
19 to 50 years.9 Thus, while the iron concentration of pro-
cessed, encapsulated placenta appears to be higher than that of
comparable amounts of dehydrated beef, the calculated daily
intake for women taking up to 3300 mg of processed placenta
per day is relatively modest and may help account for the lack
of significant difference in postpartum iron status, including
iron rebound in the first few days postpartum, between the
placenta and placebo groups. It may also indicate that, among
women with adequate dietary iron intake, the bioavailability
of iron in human processed placenta is not significantly
greater than that of comparable intakes of dehydrated
beef.
Our findings may be especially important for women who
are iron deficient prenatally and/or postpartum, and whose
only source of supplemental dietary iron is encapsulated
placenta, as this likely will provide an inadequate source
of supplemental iron in cases of deficiency. Appendix S1
indicates the number of participants in both the placenta
and placebo groups whose hemoglobin values were below
the 11.0 g/dL cutoff for iron-deficiency anemia at each of
the 4 time points of the study. While the small number
of participants who were iron deficient postpartum in the
present study precludes a meaningful statistical comparison
of participants in the placenta and placebo groups who were
iron deficient, hemoglobin values among these participants
before (36 weeks’gestation, and within 4 days of parturition)
and after placenta or placebo supplementation (between days
5 and 7 postpartum, and between days 21 and 27 postpartum)
suggest that placenta capsule supplementation was likely no
more effective at restoring maternal iron levels than a beef
placebo supplement during the first 3 weeks postpartum. This
may not be surprising given that iron deficiency is typically
slow to respond to oral iron supplementation therapy. The
standard course of oral iron therapy for iron deficiency is at
least 80 mg of elemental iron (equivalent to 250 mg of iron
sulphate) per day, for up to 6 weeks.12
The current study has several important limitations.
Primary among these is its small sample size, the demo-
graphic homogeneity of the study participants (including
socioeconomic status and infant feeding method), and its
evaluation of postpartum iron status almost entirely among
women consuming adequate amounts of dietary iron dur-
ing pregnancy and in the immediate postpartum period.
However, given the longitudinal nature of the data and
the moderate effect sizes for transferrin and hemoglobin,
sample size issues may not be a significant concern with
these data. Larger samples certainly would be important
to replicate these findings and to better understand if the
small effects noted in ferritin were real or if they were
the results of an underpowered analysis for this particular
protein.
In addition, because of logistical constraints, mostly due
to delays associated with patient discharge and the release
of placentas from hospitals, encapsulation processing did
not take place until postpartum day 4 in some cases, mean-
ing placenta or placebo supplementation for a number of
participants did not begin until day 5 postpartum. Although
unlikely, it is possible that this delay represented a critical
missed window of therapeutic value for iron supplementation
in the form of human placenta.
Finally, our study did not account for possible differ-
ences in therapeutic effect due to variations in supplement
dosage or preparation methods, as we evaluated the effect of
encapsulated human placenta supplementation based only
on a single, prominent placenta encapsulation specialist’
s
dosage recommendations and preparation protocol. Future
studies may find that higher daily intakes of encapsulated
human placenta lead to improved iron rebound (compared
to placebo) among postpartum women or that other placenta
preparation techniques yield higher amounts of dietary iron
or improve absorption.
The current study is the first rigorous scientific investiga-
tion of one oft-cited potential health benefit of encapsulated
human placenta supplementation: postpartum maternal iron
status. Further research is needed to confirm our results and
to investigate potential physiologic effects on postpartum
iron status not included in the current study. To this end,
future research might include focusing on participants with
iron-deficiency anemia who are taking prescription iron sup-
plements (oral and intravenous) both with and without pla-
centa supplementation. Such studies would allow researchers
to examine whether encapsulated placenta supplements (or
other means of maternal placentophagy) impede, improve,
or have no effect on recovering iron levels in women who
are iron deficient postpartum and treated with standard
therapies.

 CONFLICT OF INTEREST
This study was made possible, in part, by the collaboration
between the study authors and Placenta Benefits LTD, a hu-
man placentophagy information and advocacy website and
encapsulation service provider. Placenta Benefits LTD encap-
sulation providers were paid the standard fee for the placenta
encapsulation services they provided to study participants.
Placenta Benefits LTD encapsulation providers were blinded
to the participants’group assignment before encapsulation
and did not have any contact whatsoever with study partici-
pants after the encapsulation process was complete and group
assignment was revealed. No Placenta Benefits LTD personnel
were involved in any part of the study design, data collection,
data analysis, or manuscript preparation. None of the study
authors have any financial interest in Placenta Benefits LTD or
any other human placentophagy advocacy or services entity.
