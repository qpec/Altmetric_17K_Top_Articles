IMPORTANCE Proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) has the potential to reduce toxic effects in the
definitive management of locally advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but long-term
prospective data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To report the final (5-year) results of a prospective study evaluating concurrent
chemotherapy and high-dose PBT to treat unresectable stage III NSCLC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this open-label, single-group assignment study, with
median follow-up of 27.3 months for all patients and 79.6 months for survivors, 64 patients
were enrolled and analyzed; inclusion criteria were unresectable IIIA/IIIB histologically
confirmed NSCLC, Karnofsky performance status 70 to 100, and 6-month prediagnosis
weight loss of no more than 10%. Staging used positron emission tomography and/or
computed tomography. Induction chemotherapy was allowed.
INTERVENTIONS Concurrent chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) and passively scattered
PBT (74-Gy relative biological effectiveness) in all patients.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival (PFS), actuarial distant metastasis, and locoregional recurrence.
Patterns of treatment failure were categorized as local/regional or distant. Acute and late
toxic effects were prospectively assigned using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, v3.0.
RESULTS Of 64 patients (22 [34%] female; median [range] age, 70 [37-78] years; stage IIIA,
30 [47%]; IIIB, 34 [53%]), 17 (27%) were alive at last follow-up. Median OS was 26.5 months
(5-year OS, 29%; 95% CI, 18%-41%). Five-year PFS was 22% (95% CI, 12%-32%); 5-year
actuarial distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence were 54% (n = 36) and 28%
(n = 22), respectively. Treatment failures were largely (31 [48%] patients) distant, with low
rates of crude local (10 [16%]) and regional (9 [14%]) recurrences. Rates of grade 2 and 3
acute esophagitis were 18 (28%) and 5 (8%), respectively. Acute grade 2 pneumonitis
occurred in 1 (2%) patient. Late toxic effects were uncommon: 1 (2%) patient developed an
esophageal stricture (grade 2) and 1 (2%) grade 4 esophagitis. Late grades 2 and 3
pneumonitis occurred in 10 (16%) and 8 (12%), respectively. Two (3%) patients developed a
bronchial stricture (grade 2), and 1 (2%) a grade 4 bronchial fistula. There were no acute or
late grade 5 toxic effects.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Concurrent chemotherapy and PBT to treat unresectable
NSCLC afford promising clinical outcomes and rates of toxic effects compared with historical
photon therapy data. Further optimization of proton therapy, particularly intensity-modulated
proton therapy, is still needed.

 N
on–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a major health
burden worldwide; importantly, both the disease—as
well as its treatment—can cause symptomatic dete-
rioration. In unresectable locally advanced disease, concur-
rent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is recommended, but patients
often find it difficult to tolerate because they frequently have
comorbidities and suboptimal performance status.1,2
The use of proton beam therapy (PBT) is an attractive op-
tion with which to reduce toxic effects of CRT.3,4 The unique
Bragg peak results in deposition of the highest dose within a
targeted area with virtually no dose distally. Implications for
lung cancer therapy include the ability to safely deliver the de-
sired dose while maintaining low doses to cardiopulmonary
structures, which may affect toxic effects, functional status,
quality of life, and/or survival.
Retrospective analyses have demonstrated that PBT de-
creasestheratesofseverepneumonitisandesophagitisascom-
paredwith3-dimensionalconformalradiotherapy(3DCRT)and
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), despite dose esca-
lationfrom60to74Gyrelativebiologicaleffectiveness(RBE).5,6
In addition, our institutional phase 2 study of concurrent che-
motherapy and passively scattered PBT for unresectable stage
III NSCLC yielded encouraging outcomes and toxicity pro-
files at 20-month follow-up.7 Herein, we present final results
of a phase 2 open-label, single-group assignment study with
long-term (median, 79.6 months) follow-up.
Methods
Complete methodology for this study, which was approved by
the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institu-
tional Review Board and ethics committee (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT00495170), is described elsewhere.7 All pa-
tients signed informed consent.
Briefly,inclusioncriteriaforthisstudywereinoperableand
histologically and/or cytologically proven stage III NSCLC, in-
cluding negative systemic workup with positron emission to-
mography–computed tomography (PET-CT) and brain com-
puted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. Other
criteria included Karnofsky performance status of 70 to 100,
medically fit to receive concurrent and/or induction chemo-
therapy, weight loss no more than 10% in the 6 months be-
fore diagnosis, and ability to provide informed consent. Pa-
tientswerenotenrolledincasesofpriorchestradiationtherapy
and/or pregnancy. Those with prior and/or concomitant
malignant neoplasms were also not enrolled, with the excep-
tion of curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ, cutane-
ous basal cell carcinoma, or vesical superficial transitional
cell carcinoma.
Passively scattered proton therapy planning first com-
menced with a 4-dimensional CT simulation scan, from which
thereconstructedmaximum-intensityprojectionimage,aswell
as 10 breathing phases, was used to contour an internal gross
tumorvolume.7,8Thiswasfollowedbytheadditionofan8-mm
isotropic expansion to construct the internal clinical target vol-
ume and edited clinically, followed by a 5-mm expansion to
form the planning target volume (PTV) for evaluation pur-
poses. However, the actual PTV for proton planning was indi-
vidualized per beam and designed on the basis of density,
depth, energy, and other factors.7 The dose distribution was
calculated using the average 4-dimensional CT images. Elec-
tive nodal irradiation was not performed in this study. Dose
constraints to organs-at-risk have been previously described.6
Using a prescription dose of 74 Gy (RBE) for all patients (as-
suming RBE of 1.1), the PTV was required to be covered with
at least 95% of this prescribed dose. Prior to PBT delivery, com-
pensators and apertures were designed for the final treat-
ment plan to control the depth and lateral portions of the pas-
sivelyscatteredprotonbeams,respectively.Treatmentforeach
fraction was set up using orthogonal kilovolt x-ray images.
Sixteen of 64 (25%) patients underwent adaptive replan-
ning therapy 2 to 5 weeks after initial proton therapy (me-
dian, 4 weeks). The most common reason for adaptive replan-
ning was tumor shrinkage and/or anatomical changes. Most
adaptive replanning involved beam energy changes and/or
compensator modification to improve target coverage and
avoid normal tissue overdosing.
Patients received weekly infusions of carboplatin (area un-
der the curve of 2 units) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) during PBT,
in addition to induction and/or adjuvant chemotherapy at sys-
temic doses as judged by the treating physician. Typically, car-
boplatin-paclitaxel were used for adjuvant chemotherapy;
either carboplatin-paclitaxel or cisplatin-etoposide were used
for induction chemotherapy. Antiemetics and intravenous hy-
dration were given in all patients. Chemotherapy schedules
could be modified at clinical discretion, or in cases of aber-
rant laboratory test values (resulting in a treatment break).
Follow-up was performed 6 weeks after CRT to assess ad-
verse events (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 3), with a complete interval history and physi-
cal examination, laboratory studies, and thoracic CT. Subse-
quent clinical follow-up was held every 3 months for the first
2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. Positron emission
tomography and/or computed tomography was required dur-
ing the first 2 to 6 months after therapy, and as clinically indi-
cated thereafter. Acute toxic effects were defined as occur-
ring within 90 days after last treatment and late toxic effects
thereafter.
Key Points
Question Is proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) safe and effective in
the long term to treat unresectable stage III non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC)?
Findings This open-label, single-group assignment phase 2 study
evaluates survival, toxic effects, and patterns of treatment failure
with concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose PBT in 64 patients
with unresectable stage III NSCLC. This management was found to
be efficacious with promising rates of grade 3 and above toxic
effects as compared with historical photon therapy data.
Meaning Concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose PBT may be
an important option with which to definitively treat locally
advanced NSCLC.

 Enumeration of treatment failures was conducted on the
basis of follow-up imaging schedules as detailed herein; these
were defined according to radiologic features. In case of find-
ings suspicious for recurrence, PET-CT was always done, but
rebiopsy was not routinely performed. Local treatment fail-
ure was defined as tumor appearance within the PTV; the ap-
pearance of pathologically appearing lymph nodes on imaging
outside the PTV was denoted as regional treatment failure. Re-
currence beyond local and nodal sites was classified as dis-
tant failure.
The primary objective of the study was to improve over-
all survival (OS). We hypothesized that the median survival
time would be increased from a baseline of 16 months1 to 24
months. Using the normal approximation, we calculated that
65 patients would be required to have an 80% chance of dem-
onstrating improvement using a 1-sided test with signifi-
cancelevelof.05.Statistics,usingasignificancelevelofα < .05,
were performed with Stata/MP 14.2 statistical software. The
primary end point, OS, was calculated using Kaplan-Meier
methodologyfromthebeginningofenrollmenttodateofdeath
or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined
from enrollment to any treatment failure or death; other more
specific end points were distant metastasis and locoregional
recurrence rates. In the presence of competing risks (eg, death)
when performing survival analyses for any recurrence, alter-
native cumulative-incidence competing risk methodology was
used to overcome the overestimated probabilities of recur-
rences. Combined major late toxic effects were also analyzed
using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Multivariate Cox propor-
tional hazards modeling was used to examine predictors of OS
when adjusting for each of the collected potential confound-
ing variables.
Results
From 2009 to 2011, 121 patients were screened and 84 pa-
tients were enrolled on the protocol (Figure 1). Sixty-four pa-
tients were eligible for analysis; 20 patients were excluded due
to inappropriate staging (n = 8), lack of follow-up informa-
tion (n = 9), or not having received protocol-specific proton
therapy (n = 3). Typically, most patients on protocol were not
considered ideal for photon-based radiotherapy such as IMRT
owing to extensive disease involvement as judged by the treat-
ing physicians and insurance reviewers, and/or likelihood of
significant clinical improvement as compared with IMRT (as
evaluated by both treating physicians and insurance compa-
nies). In addition, these patients needed to have insurance ap-
proval (except for self-payers), and Medicare for patients 65
years or older was the most common insurance. Table 1 dis-
plays clinical characteristics of the analyzed patients. Of note,
30 (47%) and 34 (53%) patients were stages IIIA and IIIB, re-
spectively. The median Karnofsky performance status was 90
(range, 70-100). All patients received a course of concurrent
CRT,andnonerequiredprotontreatmentbreaks.Twenty(31%)
and 18 (28%) patients received induction and adjuvant che-
motherapy,respectively.Medianfollow-upwas27.3(range,2.7-

tients had died.

 (31 of 64 patients) and 62% (31 of 50) of all recurrences. Al-
most all distant treatment failures were not accompanied by
local or regional relapses. The crude overall incidence of lo-
cal and regional recurrences was 10 (16%) and 9 (14%) pa-
tients, respectively. Isolated local and regional relapses were
uncommon (4 [6%] and 2 [3%] patients, respectively). Five-
yearactuarialdistantmetastasis,locoregionalrecurrences,and
any recurrence were 54% (95% CI, 40%-68%), 28% (95% CI,
18%-43%), and 64% (95% CI, 51%-76%). Figure 2B shows rates
of locoregional, distant metastatic, and any recurrence using
death as a competing risk.
On multivariate analysis, there were 4 parameters inde-
pendently correlative for poor OS: Karnofsky performance sta-
tus 70 to 80 vs 90 to 100 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.48; 95% CI, 1.33-
4.65; P = .004), stage IIIB vs IIIA (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.09-3.83;
P = .03), tumor location in left lung or right lower lobe vs right
middle and/or right upper lobe (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.03-3.50;
P = .04), and pretreatment tumor size of greater than 7 cm vs
7 cm or less (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.07-5.31; P = .03).
Acute toxic effects are enumerated in Table 2. Rates of
grade 2, 3, and 4 esophagitis were 28% (n = 18), 8% (n = 5), and
0. Grades 2, 3, and 4 pneumonitis occurred in 2% (n = 1), 0, and
0 patients. Cardiac arrhythmia and ischemia occurred in 2 (3%)
patients each. There were no acute or grade 5 adverse effects.
Table 3 displays late toxic effects. Three (5%) patients
experienced grade 2, 1 (2%) grade 3, and 1 (2%) grade 4
esophagitis. One patient (2%) developed an esophageal stric-
ture (grade 2). Grades 2 and 3 pneumonitis occurred in 10
(16%) and 8 (12%), respectively. Two (3%) patients developed
a bronchial stricture (grade 2), and 1 (2%) a grade 4 bronchial
fistula. Grade 2 cardiac arrhythmia occurred in 4 (6%) pa-
tients, and 2 (3%) patients each developed grades 2 and 3 peri-
cardial effusion. There were no late grade 5 adverse effects.
Figure 2C shows combined major late toxic effects using
Kaplan-Meier methodology.
Discussion
In light of encouraging previous data, it is imperative to pro-
vide long-term prospective experiences for the safety and ef-
ficacy of PBT as part of combined-modality management for
locally advanced NSCLC. Herein, we demonstrate that con-
current PBT and chemotherapy was safe and efficacious from
the long-term perspective, and hence justifies further pro-
spective investigation.
There are several reflections from this analysis. First, the
study was designed in 2004, when PET imaging had recently
been approved for lung cancer staging; image quality was still
poor and did not include a CT component in outside facili-
ties, which could cause substantial understaging of the dis-
ease by modern standards. However, the observed median OS
of 26.5 months was encouraging and in accord with our origi-
nal statistical goal of 24 months. Local tumor control was
equally noteworthy, and the observed patterns of treatment
failure were largely expected. The low rate of regional (or, iso-
lated regional) relapses provides further evidence in favor of
omittingelectivenodalirradiation;theoveralllowrateoflocal/
regional recurrences indicates that current 4-dimensional CT–
based planning, as well as compensator smearing parameters
and range uncertainty margins, is adequate.7 However, it is
naturallydifficulttoascribethelowrecurrenceratestotherapy
itself vs a potential contribution by the strong commitment to
image guidance and/or adaptive replanning. In addition, the
presence of learning curves for new technologies is inevi-
table, and we noted that many proton treatment plans in the
present study could be further optimized. Next, regarding the
multivariate analysis findings, an interesting finding was the
effect of tumor location. Left-sided and right lower lobe dis-
ease displayed worse OS, which potentially could be related
to their proximity to the heart (discussed subsequently in light
of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 0617 study),
although assessment of the precise dosimetry in that trial is
ongoing and will be subsequently reported.
When comparing with our preliminary prospective data
(median OS, 29.4 months),7 which had a median follow-up of
19.7 months, these data display that concurrent PBT and che-
motherapy yielded comparable OS (26.5 months) in the long-
term setting, as well as low overall rates of late adverse events.
Another retrospective series of 134 patients with stage II to III
NSCLC treated with concurrent chemotherapy and PBT (60-74
Gy [RBE]) and median 4.7-year follow-up demonstrated me-
dian OS of 30.4 months for patients with stage III disease (ma-
jority IIIA), as well as similar relapse patterns.6 Of 77 patients
receiving 74 Gy (RBE), 3 (4%) developed grade 3 esophagitis,
andanotherdevelopedgrade4esophagealstricture;2(3%)de-
veloped grade 3 pneumonitis. Next, a prematurely termi-
nated phase 2 study from the University of Florida (n = 14) dis-
playedamedianOSof33months(majorityofpatientshadstage
IIIA disease); the PFS figure of 14 months is similar to that ob-
served here.9 Our data are also consistent with preliminary re-
porting of the phase 2 randomized study to compare IMRT vs
passivescatteringprotontherapyinlocallyadvancedNSCLC.10
To this extent, it is important to note that in anatomically un-
favorable circumstances, such as disease “wrapping” around
critical structures, it is unlikely that passively scattered PBT
willprovideadequateconformalitytocompletelypreventhigh
dosesfromreachingvariousorgans-at-riskduetolackofproxi-
mal conformality and limitations of 3-dimensional planning
(eg, bronchi or esophagus, which may lead to strictures and/or
fistulas).11 Instead, the investigation of other techniques such
as intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may be most
useful for anatomically challenging areas, and further pro-
spective investigation is required in this realm.4
Outcomes and toxic effects in this study appear promis-
ing as compared with studies of 3DCRT and/or IMRT and con-
current chemotherapy, although those series evaluated a va-
riety of stages and treatment methods.12,13 Median OS in the
largest IMRT-chemotherapy series (n = 165, median 31.3-
month follow-up for survivors, 16.5 months overall) was 21.6
months;18%ofthecohortdevelopedgrade3esophagitis.There
was a 12% rate of grade 3 pneumonitis and 2 (1%) patients ex-
perienced grade 5 pneumonitis. Comparative figures for the
RTOG 0617 trial will be presented subsequently. It is also note-
worthythatIMRTproducesfewertoxiceffectsthan3DCRTand
has therefore been proposed to be the standard technique in

 this clinical setting.14 From a technological development point
of view, IMRT should be more appropriately compared with
IMPT (owing to similar planning features), and 3DCRT should
becomparedwithpassivescatteringprotontherapy(withsimi-
lar image guidance and planning maturity). Prospective stud-
ies to address these issues are ongoing.

 0617 trial (N = 544 patients) investigating receipt of 74 vs 60
Gy of photon-based radiotherapy.15 In addition to finding
statistically inferior median OS in the high-dose arm (20.3
vs 28.7 months), factors independently associated with
worse OS included heart V5 and V30 and planning target vol-
ume (PTV) size, but not radiotherapy technique (3DCRT vs
IMRT). This is supported by a recent retrospective single-
institutional analysis of 322 patients demonstrating that
heart V50 and lung V5, among others, independently corre-
lated with OS.16 A secondary analysis of RTOG 0617 has
recently been performed to compare 3DCRT with IMRT.17
Despite the IMRT group having larger PTVs and PTV to nor-
mal lung ratios (and more frequent stage IIIB disease), out-
comes between both cohorts were statistically similar. In
addition, patients receiving IMRT received significantly less
cardiac dose and experienced fewer cases of grade 3 or
higher pneumonitis (3.5% vs 7.9%). In RTOG 0617, overall,
grade 3 or higher pulmonary events occurred in 20% vs 19%
for the 60 and 74 Gy cohorts, respectively; grade 3 or higher
esophagitis was observed in 7% vs 21%. Corresponding fig-
ures in the present work were 12% and 11%, respectively.
Taking the results of RTOG 0617 and placing them in con-
text with these data, the role of dose escalation is still
controversial,18 in part because potential improvement in tu-
mor control could be masked by treatment-related morbidity
and mortality. Because dosimetric properties (but not treat-
ment technique) seem to correlate with OS, it could be pos-
ited that advanced, highly conformal modalities in them-
selves may not directly affect outcomes but could do so
secondarily by means of controlling cardiopulmonary doses.
This notion must be further tested before definitive conclu-
sions can be drawn, however. To this extent, the unique prop-
erties of PBT are thus noteworthy in being able to deliver high
tumor doses while maintaining low cardiopulmonary doses,
which theoretically could improve survival over photon-
based therapy. In addition, it is well known that proton therapy
significantly reduces the “low-dose bath” to normal struc-
tures as compared with photon therapy. Preliminary data in-
dicate that this unique aspect of proton therapy might mini-
mize immune suppression caused by scattering radiation and
lead to higher lymphocyte counts.19 In addition, retrospec-
tive data supporting an OS benefit in patients treated with PBT
vs photon therapy have recently been reported.20 As com-
pared with RTOG 0617, the median OS and toxic effect rates
of the present study seem favorable as compared with the
74-Gy arm therein.
Our results also have implications for future work delin-
eating the cost-effectiveness of PBT for locally advanced
NSCLC.21 It has been postulated that PBT is economically fa-
vorable for these cases, but the overall quality of evidence is
low.22 Without long-term information on outcomes and toxic
effects,however,cost-effectivenessisdifficulttoevaluate,and
this prospective report should thus provide a notable build-
ing block for cost-effectiveness studies. Our demonstration of
favorable OS, as well as low rates of adverse events as com-
pared with photon-based CRT series, will likely play a role in
its estimated cost-effectiveness because the known increase
in PBT costs could likely be offset by cost reductions due to
fewer clinically manifested toxic effects, particularly late toxic
effects. The prospective finding of fewer patient-reported se-
vere symptoms with PBT over 3DCRT or IMRT treatment por-
tends an impact on quality-of-life data, which also play a role
in cost-effectiveness.23
Limitations
Thisstudyislimitedbyseveralfactors,includingtheuseofnon-
standardizedinductionand/oradjuvantchemotherapy,hetero-
geneity in the population regarding other salient clinical fac-
tors, as well as applicability based on the unresolved issues
regarding RTOG 0617 data as discussed herein. Nevertheless,
in light of these findings, the next major step to be taken will
bethroughmulti-institutionalprospectivetrials,suchasthePCG
LUN005 and RTOG 1308 studies. The continued advancement
of IMPT will also be crucial to address whether this should be
the standard of care over passively scattered PBT for some or
most if not all patients with locally advanced NSCLC.
Conclusions
This is the final report with long-term follow-up of a phase 2
open-label, single-group assignment study evaluating dose-
escalated (74 Gy [RBE]) PBT and concurrent chemotherapy as
part of definitive treatment for stage III unresectable NSCLC.
Altogether, with median follow-up of 79.6 months for alive pa-
tients, we observed encouraging clinical outcomes and low
rates of toxic effects in both the acute and late settings, com-
paring favorably with historical data using photon-based
therapy,particularlyregardingtoxiceffects.Theseresultshave
implications for ongoing issues regarding the role of dose es-
calation in this population, further optimization of proton
therapy such as IMPT, and cost-effectiveness.
