Influence of EMS-physician presence
on survival after out-of-hospital
cardiopulmonary resuscitation: systematic
review and meta-analysis
Bernd W. Böttiger1*, Michael Bernhard2, Jürgen Knapp3 and Peter Nagele4
Abstract
Background: Evidence suggests that EMS-physician-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OOHCA) may be associated with improved outcomes, yet randomized controlled trials are not
available. The goal of this meta-analysis was to determine the association between EMS-physician- versus
paramedic-guided CPR and survival after OOHCA.
Methods and Results: Studies that compared EMS-physician- versus paramedic-guided CPR in OOHCA published
until June 2014 were systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. All studies were
required to contain survival data. Data on study characteristics, methods, and as well as survival outcomes were
extracted. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis due to a high degree of heterogeneity among
the studies (I2 = 44 %). Return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC], survival to hospital admission, and survival to
hospital discharge were the outcome measures.
Out of 3,385 potentially eligible studies, 14 met the inclusion criteria. In the pooled analysis (n = 126,829),
EMS-physician-guided CPR was associated with significantly improved outcomes compared to paramedic-guided
CPR: ROSC 36.2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 31.0 – 41.7 %) vs. 23.4 % (95 % CI 18.5 – 29.2 %) (pooled odds
ratio [OR] 1.89, 95 % CI 1.36 – 2.63, p < 0.001); survival to hospital admission 30.1 % (95 % CI 24.2 – 36.7 %) vs.
19.2 % (95 % CI 12.7 – 28.1 %) (pooled OR 1.78, 95 % CI 0.97 – 3.28, p = 0.06); and survival to discharge 15.1 %
(95 % CI 14.6 – 15.7 %) vs. 8.4 % (95 % CI 8.2 – 8.5 %) (pooled OR 2.03, 95 % CI 1.48 – 2.79, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that EMS-physician-guided CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is
associated with improved survival outcomes.

Background
The optimal emergency medical service (EMS) system
configuration and staffing for out-of-hospital cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are controversial [1–3].
In several countries, EMS physicians are an integral part
of prehospital EMS teams and are often dispatched to
the most severe cases, including cardiac arrest. EMS
physicians have undergone special training in emergency
medicine that often goes beyond current advanced cardiac
life support standards [1–7]. Despite the intuitive appeal
of having EMS physicians guiding out-of-hospital CPR,
there is only limited evidence about the influence of EMS-
physician-guided CPR on outcomes after out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OOHCA). Studies comparing the effect of
different EMS systems (i.e., EMS-physician-staffed versus
nonphysician (paramedic)-staffed systems) and their ef-
fects on survival in OOHCA patients are notoriously diffi-
cult to conduct and thus are limited [1–3]. Interestingly,
almost all large-scale comparative studies demonstrate a
survival benefit associated with EMS-physician-guided
CPR for OOHCA [2–5, 7].

 The goal of this study was therefore to summarize
the
existing
evidence
comparing
EMS-physician-
guided
versus
paramedic-guided
CPR
and
survival
after OOHCA.
Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [8] and Meta-analysis Of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guide-
lines [9] were followed in this meta-analysis.
Search strategy
We performed a literature search accessing MEDLINE,
EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for studies published
until June 2014 using the following search terms and key-
words: PubMed: (Heart arrest [mh] OR ((cardiac [tw] OR
heart [tw]) AND arrest [tw])) AND (prehospital [tw] OR
pre-hospital [tw] OR out-of-hospital [tw] OR “emerg*
physician*” [tw] OR “prehosp* physician*” [tw]) AND
(ALS [tw] OR advanced card* support* [tw] OR advanced
cardiac life support [mh] OR resuscitat* [tw] OR resuscita-
tion [mh] OR cardiopulmonary resuscitation [mh]). The
search strategy was based on combinations of Medical
Subject Heading terms and text words and was not re-
stricted to a specific language or year of publication. Elec-
tronic databases were searched—Cochrane Database for
Systematic Reviews and Central Register of Controlled
Trials (http://www.cochrane.org/), MEDLINE (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed), and EMBASE (https://www.
elsevier.com/solutions/embase-biomedical-research) —and
hand searches of journals, review articles, and books were
performed. In addition, we manually checked the reference
list of each article. The main focus of this study was on
prospective clinical trials, and we also included analysis of
retrospective observational cohort studies.
Study selection
Since no randomized controlled clinical trials were avail-
able, we included in this meta-analysis all prospective and
retrospective observational cohort studies. The following
eligibility criteria were required for inclusion: observational
cohort studies; comparison between EMS-physician-
guided and paramedic-guided CPR; survival data available;
adult population; and OOHCA. Articles were considered
if published in English or German. For the study by
Hagihara et al. [10], we selected only the propensity-
matched cohort to reduce selection bias (n = 9231 EMS-
physician-treated cardiac arrests versus 9231 paramedic-
treated cardiac arrests).
Data extraction
Information about sample size, study design, and charac-
teristics was extracted from the articles as well as the
following data: patients treated by EMS physicians and
paramedics, patients achieving return of spontaneous
circulation (ROSC), surviving to hospital admission, and
to hospital discharge, as well as 30-day survival. Survival
to hospital discharge was the primary outcome variable.
If survival to hospital discharge data were not available,
we used ROSC and hospital admission as the primary
outcomes. We used 30-day survival data if survival to
discharge data were not available.
Statistical analysis
We performed the analysis with the Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis software, version 2.2.064 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ,
USA). Risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were
(re)calculated for each study and pooled in both a fixed-
effects model and a random effects model. The Compre-
hensive Meta-Analysis software uses the inverse variance
method for weighing studies. However, other methods can
be selected, such as Mantel–Haenszel. The results in our
meta-analyses did not differ between each method. Hetero-
geneity among studies was formally assessed by the Q and
I2 statistics. Publication bias was tested with the Egger’s
regression test.
Results
The literature search identified 3153 publications that
met the search criteria. Detailed evaluation of abstracts
and full articles resulted in 14 studies that met inclusion
and exclusion criteria (Fig. 1, Table 1) [4, 5, 7, 10–20].
Quality of the included studies was variable and the het-
erogeneity was high (I2 = 44 %). The funnel plot of in-
cluded studies shows a small likelihood of publication
bias (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The total pooled sam-
ple size was 126,829 cardiac arrest patients.
In the pooled analysis, EMS-physician-guided CPR was
associated with significantly improved outcomes compared
with paramedic-guided CPR. The pooled estimate for
ROSC for EMS-physician-guided CPR was 36.2 % (95 % CI
31.0–41.7 %) and for paramedics was 23.4 % (95 % CI
18.5–29.2 %) (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.89, 95 % CI 1.36–
2.63, p <0.001) (Fig. 2a; Additional file 1: Figure S2A). The
pooled estimated survival-to-hospital admission rate for
EMS-physician-guided CPR was 30.1 % (95 % CI 24.2–
36.7 %) and for paramedics was 19.2 % (95 % CI 12.7–
28.1 %) (pooled OR 1.78, 95 % CI 0.97–3.28, p = 0.06;
Fig. 2b; Additional file 1: Figure S2B). The pooled estimated
survival-to-hospital
discharge
rate
for
EMS-physician-
guided CPR was 15.1 % (95 % CI 14.6–15.7 %) and for
paramedics was 8.4 % (95 % CI 8.2–8.5 %) (pooled OR
2.03, 95 % CI 1.48–2.79, p <0.001; Fig. 2c; Additional file 1:
Figure S2C).
Discussion
The results
of this
meta-analysis
show
that
CPR
guided by EMS physicians is associated with improved
Böttiger et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:4 
Page 2 of 8
 rates of ROSC, hospital admission, and hospital dis-
charge compared with CPR guided by paramedics in
OOHCA patients.
This meta-analysis included 14 international studies
with a pooled sample size of more than 126,000 patients.
Two studies from Japan [10, 17] accounted for nearly
90 % of the total sample size and thus had the biggest
weight in the meta-analysis. Because the individual stud-
ies were largely consistent in the effect size estimate, we
did not perform sensitivity analyses excluding these two
studies.
This study excluded several studies that had excel-
lent methodology but did not directly compare EMS-
physician-guided with paramedic-guided CPR, which
may influence its generalizability. In several studies, EMS
physicians provided advanced life support whereas para-
medics were only allowed to perform basic life support
without the administration of resuscitation drugs or
advanced airway management. On the other hand, most
countries that have a paramedic-only EMS system allow
paramedics a nearly identical scope of prehospital practice
compared with EMS physicians. Therefore, it is unclear
whether our results show predominantly the superiority of
advanced life support in OOHCA over basic life support
or a true superiority of EMS-physician-guided CPR. In the
multicenter Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support
Study (OPLAS) study, Stiell et al. [21] directly compared
advanced with basic life support for OOHCA and found
no positive effect of advanced life support by paramedics
on survival after OOHCA. This observation would argue
against a predominant effect of advanced life support over
basic life support.
This meta-analysis has several limitations. First, meta-
analyses pool existing evidence and are thus dependent
on the scientific quality of included studies. Typically,
meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials provide
the strongest and most robust evidence. In our study, no
randomized controlled trials exist that compare EMS-
physician-guided with paramedic-guided CPR and prob-
ably never will, due to the fact that whole states and
countries
operate
one
particular
EMS
system
and
switching systems is very costly. Despite the nonrando-
mized nature of studies included in this meta-analysis
[4, 5, 7, 10–20], the evidence favoring EMS-physician-
guided CPR for OOHCA appears to be robust since
almost all studies found a similarly positive survival effect.
Second, selection bias may have influenced individual
study results. In some EMS systems, EMS-physician-
staffed ambulances may have not been dispatched to cases
of OOHCA that were futile based on the assessment of an
ambulance crew on the scene. Alternatively, EMS physi-
cians may have determined on scene that initiation of
CPR was not appropriate, which may have influenced the
denominator of “potential cardiac arrests”. This would
have limited EMS-physician-guided CPR to OOHCA
cases with a higher likelihood of successful resuscitation.

 Third, the geographic distribution of EMS systems is
highly variable and is often influenced by many historical
factors that all may have confounded the results of this
meta-analysis.
If the results of this meta-analysis are true—that is,
EMS-physician-guided CPR provides survival benefit in
OOHCA over paramedic-guided CPR—what may be the
causes? What could EMS physicians provide beyond
what paramedics already contribute? First, it has been
demonstrated that because of the limited number of in-
vasive procedures performed by EMS crews (like airway
management, tracheal intubation, etc.) in out-of-hospital
patients, it is very difficult to obtain or maintain life-
saving skills [22–25]. As an example, even after 150 at-
tempts at intubating the trachea in elective surgical pa-
tients under optimal conditions in the operating room
the success rate is only 95 % [26]. In the out-of-hospital
setting, however, conditions are generally more difficult,
leading to more challenging prehospital airway manage-
ment [27, 28]. On the other hand, EMS physicians are
often anesthesiologists who maintain airway skills in the
operating room while working only part-time in EMS
medicine. Second, physician presence during CPR has
been reported to increase compliance with guidelines,
resulting in less hands-off time during CPR [11].
A
randomized
controlled
trial
comparing
EMS-
physician-guided versus paramedic-guided CPR will not
be possible due to many reasons. Therefore, despite the
significant limitations which are readily acknowledged, this
systematic review provides the only available evidence for
the effectiveness of a paramedic versus EMS-physician-
based emergency response system for prehospital cardiac
arrest. Perhaps there may be opportunities for natural ex-
periments when EMS systems change from paramedics to
EMS physicians or vice versa. Additional analyses using
large-scale registry data may help to elucidate this topic in
the future.
Conclusions
In summary, findings from this meta-analysis suggest
that CPR guided by EMS physicians is associated with
improved survival compared with paramedic-guided CPR
in OOHCA patients.
