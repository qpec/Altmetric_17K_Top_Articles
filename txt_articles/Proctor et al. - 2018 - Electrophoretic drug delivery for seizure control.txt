The persistence of intractable neurological disorders necessitates novel therapeutic solutions. We demonstrate 
the utility of direct in situ electrophoretic drug delivery to treat neurological disorders. We present a neural probe 
incorporating a microfluidic ion pump (FIP) for on-demand drug delivery and electrodes for recording local neu-
ral activity. The FIP works by electrophoretically pumping ions across an ion exchange membrane and thereby 
delivers only the drug of interest and not the solvent. This “dry” delivery enables precise drug release into the 
brain region with negligible local pressure increase. The therapeutic potential of the FIP probe is tested in a ro-
dent model of epilepsy. The FIP probe can detect pathological activity and then intervene to stop seizures by 
delivering inhibitory neurotransmitters directly to the seizure source. We anticipate that further tailored engi-
neering of the FIP platform will enable additional applications in neural interfacing and the treatment of neuro-
logical disorders.
INTRODUCTION
The failure of systemic drug treatments to address numerous neu-
rological disorders has spurred the development of alternative 
approaches that attempt localized treatment. These localized treat-
ments focus therapy on the region of the brain affected by the 
pathology, thereby enhancing the effectives of the treatment while 
reducing side effects inherent in systemic treatments. Some of these 
approaches such as optogenetics (1–4) and designer receptors ex-
clusively activated by designer drugs (5) have shown promise but 
have been limited by safety concerns about the need for viral trans-
fer of engineered proteins and molecules (6). Other treatments such 
as syringe injection or convection-enhanced delivery of drugs are 
prone to clogging or reflux and may also cause local edemas due to 
the pressure increase at the injection point (7–9).
In this work, we show that electrophoretic drug delivery can 
overcome the above problems by coupling the benefits of a highly 
localized, on-demand treatment with drugs that specifically control 
cellular functions. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential using 
epilepsy as a model system. Epilepsy, which affects 1% of the world 
population and remains drug-resistant in 30% of the cases (10, 11), 
is a prototypical example for which systemic drugs have failed in the 
clinic despite having strong antiepileptic effects because of their 
side effects, toxicity, and/or failure to cross the blood-brain barrier 
(12). The intermittent nature of epileptic seizures makes the disorder 
particularly well suited for a therapeutic approach such as electro-
phoretic drug delivery that acts only when needed, for instance, just 
before the onset of a seizure.
Here, we present an electrophoretic drug delivery device based 
on the organic electronic ion pump (OEIP), which offers the ability 
to deliver drugs with precise spatiotemporal control (13, 14). In 
contrast to other drug delivery devices, the ion pump works by elec-
trophoretically pumping ions across an ion exchange membrane 
and thereby delivers only the drug of interest and not the solvent 
(aside from a few water molecules per ion that make up the hydra-
tion shell). This “dry” delivery is of paramount importance for bio-
logical interfacing as it enables an intimate interface between the 
drug delivery outlet and the target cells, allowing large amounts of 
drug delivery with negligible local pressure increase. Previous re-
ports of OEIPs have shown much promise for interfacing with bio-
logy; however, challenges in scaling down these devices have limited 
their in vivo applications within the brain to date (15–19).
To that end, we engineered neural probes incorporating an ion 
pump for on-demand drug delivery and electrodes for recording 
local neural activity (Fig. 1A). The implant features a modified ver-
sion of the OEIP known as a microfluidic ion pump (FIP), which 
significantly reduces the voltage required to deliver ions (drugs) and 
simplifies replenishing/exchanging the ion reservoir (20). The FIP 
implant features a U-shaped microfluidic channel (cross-section, 
50 m × 40 m) formed using photocurable epoxy (SU8) layers for 
the base and walls (10 and 40 m in thickness, respectively) and a 
parylene-C top layer (4 m in thickness). Fabrication of the SU-8/
parylene–based microfluidic channel was enabled by a novel solid- 
on-liquid fabrication approach (21) using capillary patterning, as 
shown in fig. S1 and described in Materials and Methods. Small 
holes (15 m diameter) etched through the parylene-C layer at the 
end of the implant coated with a poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS)–based 
anion exchange membrane (6 m in thickness) serve as the drug de-
livery outlet for FIP, while a gold electrode (150 nm) at the base of the 
fluidic channel serves as the ion pump source electrode. The ion pump 
outlets are flanked by two poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):PSS 
(PEDOT:PSS)–coated (2 m thickness) electrodes for recording 
local electrophysiological activity with superior signal-to-noise 
ratio (22).
RESULTS
The drug delivery capability of the probe was tested in a bath of 
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) by loading the microfluidic 
channel with an aqueous solution of the drug of interest and apply-
ing up to 1 V between the source electrode and an external target

electrode. We found that the FIP probe is capable of pumping a 
variety of small positively charged ions with important biological 
functions including K+, Ca2+, acetylcholine, and -aminobutyric 
acid (GABA). Taking GABA delivery as an example, the net trans-
ported charge across the device operated at 1 V as a function of time 
is shown in Fig. 1B (solid line, left y axis) along with the net amount 
of GABA delivered from the device (closed symbol, right axis). The 
close agreement between the net transported charge and the amount 
of GABA delivered indicates that the FIP operates with a pumping 
efficiency approaching unity, meaning nearly all the ions transport-
ed across the anion exchange membrane are the drug of interest. 
Figure 1B shows that the probe can deliver in excess of 10−3 nmol of 
GABA within seconds. Taking a volume defined by the diffusion 
length of a cationic neurotransmitter (23, 24), the FIP can thus 
quickly tune the local concentration of GABA above 10−5 M, which 
is within the range demonstrated to inhibit neural activity (25, 26).

The passive diffusion of GABA out of the FIP in the absence of an 
applied bias was roughly two orders of magnitude less than the ac-
tive pumping rate (Fig. 1B, open symbols, right y axis). This suggests 
that, even ignoring the existing powerful GABA uptake mecha-
nisms, passive diffusion alone cannot raise extracellular GABA con-
centrations enough to inhibit local activity (20).
Having benchmarked the drug delivery capacity, we used epilepsy 
as a model system to test the therapeutic potential of the FIP im-
plant. Seizure-like events (SLEs) were induced by local injection of 
4-aminopyridine (4AP) into the hippocampus of anesthetized mice 
following previously reported procedures (Fig. 1C) (27–30). 4AP 
has been suggested to block certain voltage-gated K+ channels, 
which increases the necessary repolarization time for neurons, es-
sentially leaving the intracellular potential positive for longer peri-
ods of time, leading to the synchronous firing of larger populations 
of neurons (Fig. 1D) and ultimately SLEs (31). We chose to use 
GABA as a therapeutic agent because it is an endogenous inhibitory 
compound that can be quickly metabolized after delivery, thus lim-
iting the potential deleterious effects of long-term network activity 
shutdown. GABA inhibits neural activity by inducing uptake of Cl− 
(Fig. 1D), thereby lowering the intracellular potential and corre-
spondingly the ability of a neuron to fire. Previous in vitro work 
indicated that GABA can be effective for stopping 4AP-induced 
epileptiform activity (16, 18). The inducible SLE model was de-
veloped by testing a range of 4AP concentrations with and without 
concurrent implantation of the FIP probe loaded with GABA at 
the 4AP injection site (see Materials and Methods). Figure 1E shows 
a representative recording of neural activity in the hippocampus 
from one of the channels of a 32-channel silicon depth probe im-
planted in the space immediately adjacent to the 4AP injection site 
(Fig. 1C). The recording sites of the Si probe were spaced in a linear 
array with 100 m between recording sites, allowing simultaneous 
recording in the cortex as well as the hippocampus. Interictal spikes 
observable on all recording channels of the Si probe were observed 
within 20 min of injection, indicating that the local 4AP injection 
led to coordinated pathological events far beyond the injection site. 
The onset of interictal spikes was typically followed by increasingly 
intense SLEs lasting several seconds and, with larger doses, the 
onset of status epilepticus (uninterrupted SLE lasting more than 
1 hour). The response to 4AP injection was the same regardless of 
the presence of the unactivated FIP implant, indicating that nei-
ther the physical presence of the implant nor the passive diffusion 
of GABA from the probe had a significant effect on SLE induction.
After validating the SLE model, we tested the therapeutic ca-
pability of electrophoretic drug delivery by using the FIP probe to 
deliver GABA at the 4AP injection site. Electrophysiology record-
ings from the ion pump electrodes were observed following the 4AP 
injection, and the ion pump was turned on immediately following 
the first pathological events. Representative recordings from the 
injection site show the stark contrast between the case of no FIP 
treatment (Fig. 2A) compared to FIP treatment initiated immedi-
ately after the first SLE (Fig. 2B). In the case of the FIP interven-
tion, no additional SLEs were observed after initiating the GABA 
delivery (Fig. 2B, green arrow), whereas mice with 4AP dosing and 
no FIP intervention developed additional seizures lasting over 
an hour.
As promising as these results are, a treatment that could prevent 
all pathological events would be preferable to a treatment that is only

enacted after a pathological and potentially damaging activity has 
already started. With that in mind, the ability to prevent pathologi-
cal activity was subsequently tested by initiating the FIP treatment 
(Fig. 2C, green arrow) before the 4AP injection (Fig. 2C, red arrow). 
Neither interictal spikes nor seizures were observed when the 
GABA delivery was initiated before the 4AP injection. Figure 3 
overviews the frequency of pathological events for the control ex-
periments with 4AP injection but no GABA delivery (n = 8), the 
case of GABA delivery after 4AP injection (n = 3), and the case of 
GABA delivery before 4AP injection (n = 4) (see table S1 for the 
complete data set). The decrease in pathological activity was found 
to be significant (P < 0.05) in the case of delivering GABA before 
4AP relative to the control experiments. This finding opens the 
door to coupling electrophoretic drug delivery with advanced elec-
trophysiology analysis algorithms that have shown promise for pre-
dicting the onset of seizures (32–35), thereby enabling a closed loop 
system that could prevent pathological events before they occur.
Control experiments delivering an equivalent dose of Na+ in 
place of GABA did not have a notable effect on 4AP-induced activity 
(table S1), demonstrating that it is not the applied current from the 
ion pump that modulates electrophysiological activity but rather 
the delivered molecules. This illustrates the importance of choosing 
the appropriate drug of interest and effectively rules out the small 
current stimulus (average, <35 nA) associated with the FIP opera-
tion as the primary therapeutic mechanism.
The lasting effect of the FIP treatment was explored by admin-
istering a second injection of 4AP several minutes after completion 
of an initial period of GABA delivery. As shown in Fig. 4, in the 
Fig. 3. Frequency of pathological activity recorded for control experiments 
with only 4AP as well as for the case of delivering GABA after 4AP and the case 
of GABA before 4AP.

absence of additional GABA delivery, the second 4AP injection in-
duced a series of intense SLEs. This suggests that, as expected, the 
initial dose of GABA was rapidly metabolized, which is important 
for avoiding potential side effects that may otherwise occur from 
maintaining elevated levels of GABA.
The effect of the FIP treatment was further explored by analyz-
ing the recordings in frequency domain. Figure 4 highlights time/
frequency plots for periods before, during, and after the FIP treat-
ment as well as during SLEs induced by a second dose of 4AP. 
Low-frequency activity (1 to 5 Hz) characteristic of physiological 
activity in anesthetized mice was observed in the periods before, 
during, and after the FIP operation, while the SLE period featured 
frequencies up to 40 Hz. Recording artifacts from the FIP opera-
tion featured as periodic low-frequency activity (<1 Hz) in the time/
frequency plot during the FIP treatment. The persistence of phys-
iological rhythms despite GABA delivery suggests that while the 
GABA dosing was sufficient to stop pathological events, it had only 
negligible effects on physiological activity. We presume that this is 
due to the highly localized dosing of relatively small amounts of 
GABA (less than 1.5 nmol over 50 min).
As a final analysis, we verified the localization of the three im-
plants by histology and estimated the area of influence of the FIP 
probe. Representative traces of the FIP probe, 4AP injection sy-
ringe, and Si depth probe can be seen in the histology slices in Fig. 5 
(A, B, and C, respectively). The implants were labeled with 
1,1′- 
dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate 
(DiI; shown in red) to visualize the trace (see Materials and Methods). 
The histology confirms placement in the hippocampus, with the 
outlets of the FIP probe placed within approximately 300 m of 
the tip of the 4AP syringe. The area of influence of the FIP probe 
was estimated by a half sphere centered on the outlets of the ion 
pump with a radius of approximately 550 m equal to the average 
diffusion length of a cationic neurotransmitter in extracellular space 
after 1000 s (Fig. 5A, green circle) (23, 24). This estimated area 
extends across the hippocampus and encompasses the volume of the 
injected 4AP solution (Fig. 5B, red circle). We note, however, that 
this may underestimate the effect of inherent uptake mechanisms 
for GABA, which might decrease the diffusion length (23, 36, 37). 
Likewise, it should be expected that the area of influence would vary 
depending on the drug of interest, with smaller molecules not native 
to the body likely diffusing further (23).
DISCUSSION
Having demonstrated here the utility of FIP treatment in an acute 
study, we note that further technological developments will be re-
quired to enable chronic testing. To that end, the FIP platform can 
readily adapt lessons learned from the development of other medi-
cal implants with regard to engineering long-term biostability 
(38, 39), reducing foreign body response (40, 41), and incorporating 
closed-loop actuation (42–44). In terms of drug reservoir capacity, 
it is of note that the FIP implants in this study were not connected 
to a fluidic pump during treatment and the small amount of deliv-
ered drug found to be effective represents less than 1% of the total 
drug capacity loaded in the implants. This suggests that chronic 
FIP treatment may only require relatively infrequent reloading of 
the drug reservoir.
Looking ahead, we believe that electrophoretic drug delivery 
devices can be further adapted to best treat epilepsy and other 
neurological disorders. While epilepsy is particularly challeng-
ing as it presents in many forms, it has been found that approxi-
mately 60% of the patients have a single focal point (45), and these 
are the patients that are most likely to find conventional drug 
treatments inadequate (46). Thus, a single FIP implant at the sei-
zure focus may prove a viable treatment option for these pa-
tients. On the other hand, patients with nonfocal epilepsy may 
benefit from the use of multiple FIP implants and/or a single 
implant with multiple drug delivery outlet locations. In addition 
to epilepsy, we foresee that a FIP implant could be used, for in-
stance, to deliver dopamine for the treatment of Parkinson’s dis-
ease with the possibility of using integrated recording sites to 
optimize the dosing frequency. Likewise, a FIP implant could 
deliver chemotherapeutic agents to an inoperable brain tumor 
and/or to the tissue surrounding a resected tumor. These topics 
will be the subject of future research.
Here, we have introduced a neural probe incorporating electro-
phoretic drug delivery and recording capabilities. The drug delivery is 
made possible by an integrated FIP, which can deliver small ions such 
as neurotransmitters on demand via electrophoresis through an ion

exchange membrane. The FIP probe demonstrated the capability 
to detect, stop, and even completely prevent SLEs in an animal model 
by timely delivery of inhibitory neurotransmitters to the seizure 
source. Although this work is focused on epilepsy treatment, we an-
ticipate that tailored engineering of the FIP platform will enable 
additional applications for electrophoretic drug delivery in neural 
interfacing and the treatment of neurological disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
FIP probe fabrication
Probes were fabricated following standard photolithography prac-
tices using plastic photomasks (Selba), a SUSS MJB4 contact aligner, 
and an SCS Labcoater 2. Glass sides with dimensions of 50 × 76 mm 
were cleaned and coated with 2-m-thick parylene-C. The base 
layer was subsequently formed by selective ultraviolet (UV) expo-
sure (201 mJ/cm2) and development of a 10-m-thick spin- 
coated 
SU8 film (SU-8 2000 series, MicroChem). A photoresist liftoff pro-
cess using Oscar 5001 (Orthogonal) was used to pattern gold inter-
connects (2-nm Cr, 150-nm Au) deposited by thermal evaporation. 
Following Au liftoff, substrates were activated with 100-W O2 plas-
ma (Oxford RIE 80 plus) for 1 min and spin-coated with a 40-m-
thick SU8 layer. Selective UV exposure and development of the SU8 
layer formed the walls of the microfluidic channel. Substrates were 
rinsed with acetone and deionized (DI) water and then activated for 
15 s with a 30-W O2 plasma before filling the fluidic channel with 
2 l of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (Alfa Aesar) dissolved 
in DI water (680 mg/ml). Approximately 4 m of parylene-C was 
deposited on the substrates, thereby encapsulating the ionic liquid 
within the fluidic channel. AZ9260 was subsequently spin-coated, 
exposed, and developed using MF-26A, followed by reactive ion 
etching to open the probe outline, electrode openings, fluidic con-
nections ports, and ion pump outlets. Residual photoresist was 
rinsed away with acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then rubber 
adhesive fluidic connectors were applied to the fluidic inlet/outlets 
before removing probes from the parylene-coated glass substrates 
using a razor blade. The upper part of the free-standing probes 
was glued to Kapton substrates (500HN, 127 m thick) for added 
structural support (not including the implantable shank). Follow-
ing 1 min of 100-W O2 plasma activation, the first 0.5 mm of the 
probe tips was dip-coated into an aqueous dispersion of PE-
DOT:PSS (PH 1000 from H.C. Stark) containing 5 volume percent 
(volume %) of ethylene glycol, 0.1 volume % of dodecyl benzene sul-
fonic acid, and 1 weight % of 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane. 
The devices were then placed in an oven at 120°C for 1 hour. After 
cooling to room temperature, the microfluidic channels were flushed 
with DI water at a rate of 5 l/min for 30 min. The PEDOT:PSS 
covering the ion pump outlets was then selectively exposed to a 10% 
solution of sodium hypochlorite (Sigma-Aldrich) by flushing the 
fluidic channel with the solution at a rate of 2 l/min for 30 s, fol-
lowed by 45 min of flowing DI water.
FIP probe characterization
FIP probes were characterized by loading the microfluidic channel 
with an aqueous solution containing the drug of interest (for exam-
ple, 0.05 M GABA in DI water) and then placing the probe shanks 
into a solution of ACSF containing a PEDOT:PSS-coated head screw 
equivalent to that used for in vivo measurements. A Keithley 2612A 
Source Measure unit with customized LabVIEW software was used 
to apply a voltage between the source electrode and the target head 
screw and measure the resulting current.
Quantification of GABA in the target electrolyte
The microfluidic channel was filled with a GABA source solution 
(0.05 M in DI water), and the probe shank was placed into 500 l 
of ACSF solution with a PEDOT:PSS-coated headscrew. One-volt 
pulses were applied between the source and target electrodes (100 s 
on, 1 s off), while the current was measured. The target solution 
was then collected, and the concentration of GABA was measured 
using a GABA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit 
(ImmuSmol) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the 
diffusion measurements, we first ensured that the ion bridge was 
already filled with ions by running the devices at 1 V for 100 s. We 
then changed the target solution and started the diffusion measure-
ments. Diffusion time points less than 20 min were estimated on 
the basis of a linear extrapolation to time zero. Both active pump-
ing and diffusion data points represent the average of at least three 
samples.
4AP seizure model
The voltage-gated K+ channel blocker was injected locally with a 
programmable automatic pump into the pyramidal layer of CA1 
hippocampus to induce local epileptic seizure. One injection of 250 nl 
of 25 or 50 mM 4AP dissolved in ACSF was injected to the left 
hemisphere of the mouse hippocampus. Neuronal activity was re-
corded 1 hour before 4AP injection for control. In every experiment, 
neuronal activity was recorded for a minimum of 2 hours following 
drug administration.
Surgery and recording
Seventeen adult male OF1 mice were used for the experiments. 
Mice were entrained to a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle with 
food and water available ad libitum. All experimental procedures 
were performed according to the ethical guidelines of the Institut de 
Neuroscience des Systèmes and approved by the local Ethical Com-
mittees and Veterinary Offices. Surgeries and experiments were 
done under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (ketamine, 100 mg/kg; 
xylazine, 10 mg/kg body weight). Mice were fixed in a mouse 
stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). After a subcutaneous injec-
tion of the local painkiller ropivacaine, craniotomy was made from 
bregma (anteroposterior, 1.0 mm; mediolateral, 1.2 mm; dorsoventral, 
2.8 mm from the surface). Skull was opened; dura was removed; and 
silicon probe (NeuroNexus), FIP probe, and a Hamilton syringe for 
4AP injection with a borosilicate glass capillary (inside diameter, 
0.86 mm; outside diameter, 1.5 mm) were lowered into the hippo-
campus. Capillary was pulled with a pipette puller (P-1000, Sutter 
Instrument). The tip of the capillary was between 50 and 100 m. 
Recordings were made with a 64-channel Neuralynx amplifier.
Electrophysiology recording analysis
For pathological spike detection, the hippocampal local field poten-
tial from the CA1 pyramidal layer was down-sampled and band 
pass– 
filtered. CA1 pyramidal layer was chosen on the basis of trace 
localization in histology images. Spike events were identified when 
the envelope was at least 3 SDs above the baseline by a semiautomatic 
method, identifying interictal spikes and epileptic spike activity 
(47). The frequency of the pathological spike activity was calculated 
2 hours following drug administration.

Histology and immunocytochemistry
Animals were transcardially perfused first with saline and then with 
150 ml of fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 
0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Tissue blocks were cut on a vibratome 
(Leica VT1200S, Leica Microsystems) into 40-m coronal sec-
tions. After extensive washes in PB, GFAP staining was used [GFAP 
Monoclonal Antibody (GA5), Alexa Fluor 488, Thermo Fisher]. 
Electrodes, syringes, and ion pumps (occasionally) were covered by 
DiI (NeuroTrace DiI, Thermo Fisher) for the visualization of the 
traces. Sections were mounted on SuperFrost slides and covered with 
a mounting medium containing DAPI (VECTASHIELD Antifade 
Mounting Medium with DAPI, Vector Laboratories). Confocal 
images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope 
using either a 10× or a 20× objective with the z-stack tiling function 
of the acquisition software (ZEN).
