Replication defective viral genomes (DVGs) generated during virus replication are the pri-
mary triggers of antiviral immunity in many RNA virus infections. However, DVGs can also
facilitate viral persistence. Why and how these two opposing functions of DVGs are achieved
remain unknown. Here we report that during Sendai and respiratory syncytial virus infections
DVGs selectively protect a subpopulation of cells from death, thereby promoting the
establishment of persistent infections. We find that during Sendai virus infection this phe-
notype results from DVGs stimulating a mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS)-mediated
TNF response that drives apoptosis of highly infected cells while extending the survival of
cells enriched in DVGs. The pro-survival effect of TNF depends on the activity of the TNFR2/
TRAF1 pathway that is regulated by MAVS signaling. These results identify TNF as a pivotal
factor in determining cell fate during a viral infection and delineate a MAVS/TNFR2-mediated
mechanism that drives the persistence of otherwise acute viruses.

 P
ersistent viral genomes are observed after a number of acute
viral infections in humans, including respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), measles, and Ebola1–3. A number of host
factors,
such
as
impaired
or
altered
cytokine
production
and progressive loss of immunological functions, support the
maintenance of persistent infections4. However, the processes and
cellular mechanisms determining the onset of viral persistence
after acute viral infections remain unknown.
The innate immune response is the first active host barrier to
virus replication and is essential to control the infection and
activate adaptive responses that result in virus clearance. The
antiviral innate response is initiated upon recognition of viral
molecular patterns by cellular sensor molecules. Activation
of these sensor pathways leads to the expression of genes with
pro-inflammatory, antiviral, and pro-apoptotic activities that
control virus growth and spread. During infections with impor-
tant human pathogens including RSV, parainfluenza virus, and
measles virus, the antiviral response is triggered by replication
defective copy-back viral genomes (DVGs) that accumulate
during viral replication5–8. DVGs potently stimulate intracellular
RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that signal through the mitochon-
drial
antiviral-signaling
(MAVS)
protein
to
stimulate
the
expression of genes that control virus replication and spread, and
direct clearance of infected cells9, 10.
Paradoxically, some species of DVGs can promote the estab-
lishment of persistent RSV, parainfluenza virus, measles virus,
and other viruses during infections in tissue culture11–14 and are
proposed to be responsible for establishing persistent Ebola virus
infections in humans1. This pro-persistence activity of DVGs
has been related to the continuous competition for the viral
polymerase between full-length genomes and DVGs, resulting
in alternating cycles of replication of full-length and defective
genomes15–17.
However,
this
mechanism
cannot
explain
the survival of virus-infected cells in the presence of strong
pro-apoptotic and antiviral molecules, including type I IFNs and
TNFα, that are induced in response to sensing of DVGs10.
In order to better understand the host–virus interactions driv-
ing the establishment of persistent infections of otherwise acute
viruses, we developed a technology that allowed us to investigate at
a single cell level the mechanisms behind the different activities of
DVGs in infected cells. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization
targeting ribonucleic acid molecules (RNA FISH) to distinguish
DVGs from standard viral genomes during infection, we reveal
that during infection with the murine parainfluenza virus Sendai
(SeV) or RSV DVGs accumulate only in a subpopulation of
infected cells, and that these cells survive the infection longer than
cells enriched in full-length virus Survival of DVG-high cells is
dependent on MAVS signaling, and we identify TNFα produced
in response to MAVS signaling as pivotal in determining cell fate
during SeV infection. We show that while cells harboring full-
length viral genomes die from virus-induced TNF-mediated
apoptosis, cells enriched in DVGs regulate the expression and
activity of a TNFR2/TRAF1 pro-survival program that protects
them from TNF-induced apoptosis. Overall, this study reveals a
mechanism by which distinct viral genomic products determine
cell fate upon infection by taking advantage of the dual functions
of TNFα to perpetuate both virus and host.
Results
DVGs dominate in a subpopulation of infected cells. To better
understand the impact of DVGs during infection, we established a
RNA FISH assay that allowed us to differentiate SeV full-length
genomes (FL-gSeV) from SeV DVGs at a single cell level. As copy-
back DVGs are generated from the 5ʹ end of the viral genome and
thus have a high sequence homology with the FL-gSeV18, 19, we
designed a two-color probing strategy to distinguish DVGs from
FL genomes within infected cells (Fig. 1a). To detect replicating
virus, a set of probes labeled with Quasar-570 (pseudo-colored
red) was prepared against the 5ʹ end of the positive sense viral
RNA and a different set of probes labeled with Quasar-670
(pseudo-colored green) was prepared against the 3ʹ end of the
positive sense SeV genome, which covers the viral genomic
sequence shared with DVGs. As a result of this design, DVGs are
only bound by Quasar-670-labeled probes (denoted “DVG”),
while FL-gSeV are bound by a combination of Quasar-570 and
Quasar-670-labeled probes (denoted “FL-gSeV” and appearing as
orange in the images) (Fig. 1a). To test the specificity of the
labeling, we infected cells with SeV lacking DVGs (LD) alone or
complemented with purified defective particles containing DVGs
(pDPs). As expected, cells infected with SeV LD demonstrated a
strong FL-gSeV signal and no DVG signal, while addition of pDPs
resulted
in
detection
of
cells
with
strong
positive
DVG
signal (Fig. 1b). Confirming their specificity, Quasar-670-labeled
DVG probes detected in vitro transcribed DVG RNA transfected
into cells and did not cross-react with the synthetic RNA poly I:C
or with host GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 1c and Supplementary
Fig. 1a, b).
Analysis of various epithelial cell lines infected with SeV
containing high levels of DVGs (HD) showed an unexpected
heterogeneous distribution of Quasar-570 and 670 signals at 24
and 48 h post infection. Differential accumulation of DVGs and
FL-gSeV among infected cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c)
occurred regardless of the initial amount of input virus (Fig. 1e
and Supplementary Fig. 1d). The phenotype was recapitulated
upon hybridization with probes that targeted the negative sense
FL-gSeV (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Importantly, both FL-gSeV and
DVGs probe pools had comparable sensitivity, which was similar
to that of viral product-specific RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 1f).
Further, RT-qPCR of sorted cells negative for both Quasar-570
and 670 staining (Non-detected: ND, gated in blue), DVG-high
(gated in green), and FL-gSeV high (FL-high, gated in orange),
confirmed their differential content of FL-gSeV and DVG by RT-
qPCR (Fig. 1f–h). Note that DVG-high cells also contained a
relatively small amount of full-length viral genomes, which are
expected to provide the viral machinery for DVG replication. An
intermediate cell population showing strong Quasar-670 signal
and positive for Quasar-570 (INT, gated in yellow) was also
observed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1f, g). This population
demonstrated moderate levels of SeV NP transcript, moderate
FL-gSeV, and relatively high levels of DVGs by RT-qPCR
(Fig. 1h). Because of its intermediate nature, we excluded this
population from further analysis in this study.
To characterize the temporal distribution of DVGs among the
infected cell population, we analyzed cells infected with SeV
HD by RNA FISH followed by flow cytometry. FL-high and
DVG-high cells were detected as early as 6 h post infection and
their percentage increased during the time course of infection,
corresponding well with cell imaging (Fig. 1i, j). DVG-high cells
accumulated quickly upon infection, plateaued, and decreased at
later time points, while accumulation of FL-high cells followed
behind, reminiscent of the waves of accumulation of defective
interfering particles and FL-genomes observed in long term
infected cultures (Fig. 1k)20, 21. As expected based on their
previous
characterization
as
primary
triggers
of
antiviral
immunity8, 10, 22, early accumulation of DVG-high cells was
associated with expression of high levels of IFNB1 mRNA
(Fig. 1l). In contrast, the kinetics of SeV NP mRNA expression
followed that of the FL-high populations, but not that of the
DVG-high population. Taken together, these data demonstrate a
heterogeneous physical and functional distribution of DVGs and
FL-gSeV during SeV infection.

 DVG-high cells survive infection and promote persistence. To
examine how DVG accumulation in a subpopulation of cells
impacts the establishment of persistently infected cultures, we
infected susceptible LLC-MK2 cells with SeV LD or HD and
monitored the presence of infected cells overtime. Cultures
infected with SeV LD died 8 days after infection (Fig. 2a, b), while
cultures infected with SeV HD recovered from a cell death crisis
and were passaged for at least 17 days (Fig. 2a, b and Supple-
mentary
Fig.
2a).
Remarkably,
a
substantially
higher
proportion of DVG-high cells survived by day 5 post SeV HD
infection compared to FL-high cells (Fig. 2a), and by day 17 post
infection ∼34% of the total survivors were DVG-high compared

 to 5.47% FL-high (Fig. 2c). Importantly, infectious virus was
detected in the supernatant of survivor cells on day 17 post
infection, confirming the generation of a persistent productive
infection (Fig. 2d). In order to confirm a direct role for DVGs in
promoting the generation of persistently infected cultures, pDPs
were used to supplement SeV LD infections. As expected,
extended survival of the infected population was rescued by
supplementation with pDPs whereas supplementation with UV
inactivated pDPs did not promote cell survival (Supplementary
Fig. 2b–d). Similar to SeV HD-infected cells, cells that survived
infection with SeV LD supplemented with pDPs contained
replicative viral genomes and retained a significant population of
DVG-high cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). The predominance of
DVG-high cell in the surviving cell population together with our
inability to generate persistently infected LLC-MK2 cultures
during infection with SeV LD virus stocks suggest that DVGs
confer resistance to SeV-induced cell death. In support, the per-
centage of dead cells measured by viability staining was sig-
nificantly higher in FL-high cells than DVG-high cells at 24 and
48 h post infection (Fig. 2e, f). Notably, the percentage of dead
cells among the DVG-high sub-population did not significantly
increase over time, whereas the percentage of dead cells among
FL-high cells increased at 48 h post infection matching the spike
of total cell death in the culture (Fig. 2g). To assess whether
DVGs protect cells from apoptosis, a major mechanism of cell
death during SeV infection23, 24, we stained the cultures for the
hallmark apoptotic molecules active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP-
1. A significantly smaller population of DVG-high cells stained
positive for these markers compared to FL-high cells (Fig. 2h, i,
and Supplementary Fig. 2g) demonstrating that DVGs protect
cells from apoptosis during infection.
To investigate whether the differential accumulation of DVGs
and FL-genomes among infected cells and the associated
phenotypes applied to other paramyxoviruses, we infected A549
cells with RSV having either high or low content of DVGs (HD
and LD, respectively) and analyzed the cultures by RNA FISH
using specific probes designed following the same strategy
described for SeV. As with SeV HD infection, heterogeneous
accumulation of RSV DVGs and full-length RSV genomes
(FL-gRSV) was observed in the infected culture (Fig. 3a, b).
Similar to SeV infection, cells infected with RSV LD did not
generate distinguishable DVG signal (Fig. 3c). In addition,
infection with RSV HD resulted in a persistently infected culture
with survivor cells containing substantial amounts of both
FL-gRSV and DVGs (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3),
while cells infected with RSV LD died after 1 week of infection
(Fig. 3c, d). Further, DVG-high cells were protected from virus-
induced cell death, as the percentage of apoptotic cells stained for
active caspase-3 was significantly lower in DVG-high cells
compared to FL-high cells (Fig. 3e, f). Taken together, DVG-
high cells are less prone to apoptosis than FL-high cells during
SeV and RSV infection and extended cell survival associates with
the establishment of persistent infections.
DVG-high cells express a unique pro-survival transcriptome.
To characterize the mechanism protecting DVG-high cells from
apoptosis, we identified candidate pathways by transcriptionally
profiling sorted FISH-stained ND, FL-high, and DVG-high cells
24 h post SeV HD infection. A detailed description of the pipeline
for these studies is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4a. Sorted
populations with higher than 90% purity from multiple inde-
pendent experiments were pooled after RNA extraction and used
for total transcriptome profiling (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c).
Confirming the distribution of viral genomes in the different
populations, RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated even coverage of the
full length genome in the FL-high population, while it showed a
strong bias towards the 5ʹ end of the genome in the DVG-high
population, as expected based on the origin of SeV copy-back
DVGs (Supplementary Fig. 4d).
RNA-Seq analysis identified 1800 differentially expressed genes
among the FL-high, DVG-high, and ND populations (≥ two-fold
change in expression with ≤ 1% false discovery rate). Increased
expression of a number of genes in the different cell populations
was validated by RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Hierarchical
clustering revealed at least three distinct clusters of co-regulated
genes. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 represent genes with relatively higher
expression in ND cells, DVG-high cells, or FL-high cells,
respectively (Fig. 4a). Gene Ontology analysis of cluster 1
(upregulated in ND cells) was highly enriched in genes involved
in cell cycle checkpoints, complement and antigen presentation,
and the IFN signaling pathway (Fig. 4b). Cluster 3 (upregulated in
FL-high cells) showed enrichment in genes involved in the
unfolded protein responses, oxidation–reduction pathways, and
steroid metabolism (Fig. 4b). Cluster 2 (upregulated in DVG-high
cells) demonstrated the enrichment of anti-apoptotic factors and
a number of pro-survival pathways, including mitogens and
growth factors, the TNF pathway, and the NF-kB/Rel pathway
(Fig. 4b). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed
enriched signatures associated with pro-survival pathways in
the DVG-high population (Fig. 4c, d). These signatures include
TNF-related genes with anti-apoptotic functions, such as the TNF
receptor 2 (TNFR2 or TNFRSF1B), TNF receptor associated
factor 1 (TRAF1), and the TNF alpha induced protein 3

 induction of IFNs and expression of cytokines and chemokines,
consistent with a well-described role of DVGs in initiating
antiviral immunity9, 10, 22. Collectively, these studies show that
host cells enriched in DVGs actively engage both an antiviral and
a pro-survival program.
DVG-high cells survive apoptosis triggered by MAVS/TNF.
To determine if accumulation of DVG-high cells and death of
FL-high cells depend on the antiviral response induced by
DVGs9, 10, we analyzed infections of cells lacking the critical
adaptor protein MAVS (MAVS KO) or lacking the type I IFN
receptor (IFNAR1 KO). Differential accumulation of DVG-high
and FL-high cells remained unchanged in MAVS or IFNAR1 KO
cells, suggesting that the heterogeneous accumulation of DVGs is
independent of the engagement of the antiviral response (Fig. 5a).
In addition, the percentage of apoptotic cells in both DVG-high
and FL-high populations, remained similar in wild type (WT)
and IFNAR1 KO cells (Fig. 5a–c). In contrast, MAVS KO cells
exhibited reduced apoptosis in both subpopulations (Fig. 5a–c),
indicating that a MAVS-dependent process drives apoptosis in
these cultures. The lower level of apoptosis in SeV HD-infected
MAVS KO cells compared to controls was not due to reduced
viral replication, as MAVS KO cells showed increased viral
replication (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).
Transcriptional profiling suggested that TNFα-related path-
ways are implicated in defining the cell fate during SeV infection.
Due to the well-documented dual roles of TNFα in both inducing
cell death and conferring survival29, we next investigated whether
TNFα signaling orchestrates the differential pro- and anti-
apoptotic responses of FL-high and DVG-high cells. As expected,
SeV infection induced high levels of TNFα protein and mRNA in
a MAVS-dependent but IFNAR1-independent manner (Fig. 5d
and Supplementary Fig. 5c). The absence of TNFα secretion in
MAVS KO cells correlated with their decreased level of apoptosis
in response to SeV infection (Fig. 5a, b), and supplementation of
MAVS KO cells with TNFα, but not IFNβ, significantly increased
apoptosis upon infection with SeV HD (Fig. 5e) or LD
(Supplementary
Fig.
5d,
e).
Moreover,
a
combination
of
neutralizing antibodies against TNFα and its receptors signifi-
cantly reduced the level of total active caspase-3 expression
(Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 5f), indicating that the MAVS/
TNF axis regulates cell death in these cultures.
To investigate whether TNFα differentially impacts apoptosis
of FL-high and DVG-high cells, we quantified the percentage of
active caspase-3 positive cells among each sub-population during
infection in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Unexpect-
edly, while it increased apoptosis of DVG-high cells, blocking
TNFα signaling significantly reduced apoptosis of FL-high cells,
indicating that TNFα signaling protects DVG-high cells and kills
FL-high cells (Fig. 5g). Interestingly, supplementation of MAVS
KO cells with increasing doses of TNFα enhanced apoptosis in
the infected culture (Fig. 5h), but did not phenocopy the
differential effect on cell death of FL-high and DVG-high cells
seen in WT infected cells as both sub-populations were
susceptible to TNFα-induced apoptosis to a similar extent at all

 doses tested (Fig. 5h, i). Taken together, these results suggest that
DVG-high cells lose protection from TNFα-mediated apoptosis
in absence of MAVS and suggest a direct role of MAVS signaling
in promoting the survival of DVG-high cells.
MAVS signaling dictates the survival of DVG-high cells. We
next investigated how DVG-high cells become less prone to
TNFα-mediated apoptosis compared to FL-high cells within the
same infected culture. Based on RNA-Seq data showing upregu-
lation of several genes in the TNFR2 signaling pathway in DVG-
high cells, including TNFR2 itself (TNFRSF1B) and TRAF1, we
hypothesized that the TNFR2 pathway is responsible for the
protection of DVG-high cells from virus-triggered apoptosis. To
test
this
hypothesis,
we
neutralized
either
the
primary
TNF receptor TNFR1 or TNFR2 in SeV HD-infected cultures
(Fig. 6a, b) and tested for apoptosis of the different sub-popula-
tions.
Treatment
with
TNFR2
neutralizing
antibodies
significantly increased apoptosis of DVG-high but not FL-high
cells, suggesting a pro-survival function of TNFR2 signaling in
cells enriched in DVGs. In contrast, blocking TNFR1 signaling
reduced cell death in FL-high but had no impact on the survival
of the DVG-high population (Fig. 6a, b) suggesting that
TNFR1 signaling is not necessary for DVG-survival. In agreement
with a pro-survival role for TNFR2 in DVG-high cells, knock-
down of the TNFR2 adaptor molecule TRAF1 or the downstream
effector BIRC3 increased apoptosis in DVG-high cells but not in
FL-high cells (Fig. 6c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly,
DVG-mediated upregulation of TNFR2 signaling was controlled
by MAVS, as MAVS KO cells showed impaired upregulation
of surface TNFR2 expression and blunted expression of the
pro-survival genes TRAF1, BIRC3, and TNFAIP3 upon infection
with SeV HD (Fig. 6e, f). Thus, the TNFR2 pathway, which is
upregulated in DVG-high cells in a MAVS-dependent manner,
protects this population from SeV-induced TNFα-mediated
apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of SeV HD-infected cells with
TNFR2 neutralizing antibody led to massive cell death, similar to
infection with SeV LD, but cells that eventually recovered showed
a significantly reduced percentage of infection after long-term
subculture compared to untreated cells (Fig. 6g–j). Together,
these data demonstrate that engagement of the MAVS/TNFR2
axis by DVGs allows a sub-population of infected cells to survive
TNFα-mediated apoptosis, which is exploited by the virus to
achieve long-term persistence.

 Discussion
In this study we demonstrate that while cells respond to DVGs
inducing the expression of antiviral molecules that restrict virus
production, they also engage a pro-survival TNFR2/TRAF1-
dependent mechanism that promotes viral persistence. Our data
support a model in which enrichment of DVGs over full-length
viral genomes in infected cells leads to engagement of a MAVS-
dependent
pathway
that
while
driving
antiviral
and
pro-apoptotic activities through the production of IFNs and
TNFα, protects the cytokine-producing cell from death by
inducing and engaging TNF-related pro-survival factors (Fig. 6k).
These observations not only explain a long-standing paradox
between the reported immunostimulatory and pro-persistence
activities of DVGs, but also reveal complex host-pathogen

 interactions that may, in part, explain the co-existence of viruses
and their hosts in immunocompetent individuals.
The testing and validation of this model was only possible after
developing the ability to identify and distinguish DVGs from
FL-genomes at a single cell level. Prior to our imaging approach,
DVGs were usually detected by PCR or northern blot in bulk
infected cultures, masking the heterogeneity of viral genome
distribution among infected cells, as well as the distinct cellular
responses towards the infection. Of note, given the diversity of
DVGs, it is likely that distinct DVG species are generated during
infection and that the ability of different DVGs to promote virus
persistence varies. Our study assessed exclusively the function of
copy-back DVGs. As copy-back DVGs confer the most potent
immunostimulatory activity to paramyxovirus infections we
considered it relevant to follow their activity, regardless of the
potential function of other DVGs. Moreover, we provide evidence
that copy-back DVG-546 present in cultures infected with SeV
HD8, 22, 30 is the predominant copy-back species detected in our
assays (Supplementary Fig. 4d). RSV, in contrast, produces a
discrete population of copy-back DVGs5 and our probes are
designed to capture the large majority of these copy-back DVGs.
Interestingly, in A549 and LLC-MK2 cells the DVG signal was
widely spread within the cell cytoplasm, while the FL-gSeV signal
was concentrated in a perinuclear region of the infected cells
(Fig. 1d, j) indicating a differential intracellular localization for
FL-gSeV and DVGs. In agreement, in cells infected with SeV
lacking DVGs (SeV LD), FL-gSeVs were concentrated in the
perinuclear region (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The
impact of the intracellular distribution of viral genomes is
unknown and is currently under investigation.
DVG specific RNA FISH revealed two phenomena that chal-
lenge the prevailing view of the temporal and spatial dynamics of
DVGs during infection and provide new insights into their con-
tribution to virus persistence. First, instead of a homogenous
distribution of DVGs together with FL-viral genomes among
infected cells, DVGs predominantly occupied a sub-population of
the infected cells. Second, changes in the percentage of DVG-high
cells throughout the course of infection coordinated well with
changes in the percentage of FL-high cells, providing an alter-
native explanation for the long standing observation of waves of
DVGs and FL-viral genome predominance in infected cultures.
Our evidence of distinct cellular populations based on viral
genomic content and the resulting differential susceptibility to cell
death reveal an underappreciated cellular level of regulation of
persistent viral infections.
Our data demonstrate that during virus infection cells with a
high content of FL-gSeV are susceptible to TNFα but not type-I
IFN mediated apoptosis. The apparent lack of pro-apoptotic
activity of IFN over FL-high cells is likely caused by the strong
IFN signaling antagonistic activity of paramyxovirus proteins31.
TNFα is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can be induced by viral
infection and plays important roles in the control of virus
dissemination32, 33. Expression of TNFα has been reported in
many paramyxovirus infections, including RSV, SeV, Newcastle
disease viruses, and parainfluenza virus 5 (also known as simian
virus 5)34, 35. Importantly, TNFα expression is stimulated by
DVGs in both SeV and RSV infections5, 22. In addition, purified
defective viral particles from SeV can cause selective apoptosis of
transformed cells by activating the TNF-related apoptosis-indu-
cing ligand (TRAIL) both in vitro and in vivo36. Together, this
evidence indicates that DVGs can drive TNF-mediated apoptosis
of virus-infected cells through a mechanism distinct from that
leading to cell death after LD infections, likely caused by virus-
induced cell stress.
Unexpectedly,
transcriptome
analysis
revealed
a
robust
pro-survival TNF signature in DVG-high cells. In addition,
neutralization of TNFα and its receptors during SeV infection
resulted in significantly increased apoptosis of DVG-high cells
confirming a critical requirement for cell extrinsic TNF signaling
in promoting their survival. The enhanced survival of DVG-high
cells compared to FL-high cells could potentially also be
explained by reduced lytic virus replication in DVG-high cells as
DVGs interfere with the replication of the FL-gSeV by competing
for the usage of the viral polymerase16, 17. However, both SeV-
and RSV-induced apoptosis were significantly reduced in MAVS
KO cells despite similar or even higher levels of replication
compared to WT controls, indicating that virus replication is not
the sole determinant of cell fate during infection. The pro-survival
response to TNFα signaling is a well-documented protective
mechanism
mediated
by
NF-kB
induced
upregulation
of
pro-survival molecules, including TRAF1, A20 (TNFAIP3), and
cIAP2 (BIRC3)37–40. Here we identified a TNFR2/TRAF1 medi-
ated pathway as essential to the survival of DVG-high cells.
Notably, the expression and activity of key elements in this
pathway, including TNFR2 and TRAF1, required the engagement
of MAVS signaling in DVG-high cells and in the absence of
MAVS TNFα treatment rendered DVG-high and FL-high cells
equally susceptible to apoptosis. This discovery uncouples the role
of the TNF pathway in dictating the individual cell fate during
infection and identifies the interaction of DVGs with the MAVS-
mediated antiviral pathway as a critical factor in defining cell
survival upon infection.
The mechanism driving the heterogeneity of FL genomes
and DVG distribution and the associated innate immune
responses during initial viral infection remains unclear. Cell to
cell variation in type I IFN expression has been demonstrated in a
number of systems in association with differential expression of
innate immune limiting factors41, 42. These studies imply that
select host factors may control differential responses towards
virus infection. Interestingly, our data show that the hetero-
geneous distribution of FL genomes and DVGs among infected
cells along with the associated differential cell death rate is not

 significantly altered in IFNAR1 KO or MAVS KO cells (Fig. 5a),
suggesting that factors additional to the type I IFN pathway are
involved. One possibility is that the cell cycle status at the time of
infection is a critical factor in determining heterogeneity. Another
possibility is that stochastic DVG accumulation in infected cells
drives the phenotype. In this case, it is expected that DVG
accumulation is a dominant phenotype and when cells are seeded
with DVGs, either through stochastic infection with viral pDPs or
through generation of DVGs during virus replication, DVGs take
over the viral replication process. Interestingly, our preliminary
experiments show that natural accumulation of DVGs during SeV
replication in vivo follows a similar heterogenic pattern, where
some cells in the lung epithelium accumulate DVGs and others
do not, demonstrating that this process is not limited to in vitro
infections.
Overall, here we describe an intricate mechanism in which
virus and host come to a balance to establish a symbiotic inter-
action. The virus benefits from this mechanism because it allows
extended survival of virus-infected cells, establishing a persistent
infection. This relationship is founded in the dual role of TNFα in
targeting highly infected cells (FL-high) for apoptosis while
protecting cells with active MAVS signaling (DVG-high) from

 cell death. This mechanism fundamentally changes our under-
standing of the relationship between antiviral responses and viral
persistence and reveals potential therapeutic targets to eliminate
persistent viral reservoirs.
Methods
Cell cultures and stable cell lines. A549 cells (human type II alveolar cells,
ATCC, #CRM-CCL185), LLC-MK2 (monkey kidney epithelial cells, ATCC,
#CCL-7), and control, MAVS KO, and IFNAR1 KO A549s were cultured at 5%
CO2 and 37 °C conditions with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 50
mg/ml gentamicin. KO A549 cells were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 as follows:
The oligonucleotide sequences sgMAVS-for: CACCGGAGGGCTGCCAGGTCAG
AGG and sgMAVS-rev:AAACCCTCTGACCTGGCAGCCCTC (IDT); sgIFNAR1
(set 1) for: CACCGGACCCTAGTTGCTCGTCGCCG and sgIFNAR1 rev: AAACC
GGCGACGAGCAACTAGGGTC; sgIFNAR1 (set 2) for: CACCGTGGGTGTTGT
CCGCAGCCGC and sgIFNAR1 rev: AAACGCGGCTGCGGACAACACCCA
(Invitrogen) were used to generate single guide RNAs (sgRNA) to target MAVS or
IFNAR1 genes. The forward and reverse oligonucleotides were inserted into the
plasmid vector pLenti-CRISPR (Addgene, Plasmid #52961) using BsmBI restriction
sites. The resulting plasmids were packaged in pseudo lentiviral particles and used
to establish the gene KO as previously described43. KO of MAVS was confirmed by
western blotting (Santa Cruz, sc-166538) and mutations in the gene were verified
by PCR using the following primers: MAVS-For: CTCCCCTGGCTCCTGTGCT
CC and MAVS-Rev: AACTCCCTTTATTCCCACCTTG. Specific elimination of
MAVS activity was confirmed upon transfection of 0.25 μg/105 cells of MAVS-
expression plasmid (MAVS-WT, Addgene, Plasmid #52135) into KO cells and
measuring antiviral gene expression 16 h post infection (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
In addition, most experiments were repeated in a second independently generated
MAVS KO cell line. Specific elimination of IFNAR1 was confirmed by flow
cytometry (anti-hIFNAR1 antibody kindly provided by Serge Y. Fuchs, University
of Pennsylvania) after IFNα treatment of cells and mutations were verified by PCR
using the primers IFNAR1-For: GCTAGCTAGGAGGAAAGGCG and IFNAR1-
Rev: GGGTTTAATCTTTGGCGCGG. All cell lines used in this study were
authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Profiling at ATCC, treated with
mycoplasma removal agent (MP Biomedicals), and monthly tested for mycoplasma
before use.
Viruses. Sendai virus strain Cantell HD and LD stocks (SeV HD, high DVG
particle content; SeV LD, low DVG particle content) were prepared in embryo-
nated chicken eggs as described previously9, 10. SeV LD used in this study had a
medium tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/HA titer of 98120 and SeV HD a
TCID50/HA titer of 4916. RSV LD (stock of RSV derived from strain A2, ATCC,
#VR-1540 with a low content of DVGs) and RSV HD (derived from RSV LD) were
prepared and characterized as described previously44. For SeV titration, LLC-MK2
cells (ATCC, #CCL7) were infected with triplicate serial 1:10 dilutions of the virus
stock or supernatant from infected cell cultures (Fig. 2d only) in the presence of
2 mg/ml of trypsin. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, supernatants from each well
were tested by hemagglutination of chicken RBCs for the presence of virus particles
at the end point dilution as describe in ref. 9. For virus infections in vitro, cells were
incubated with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.5 TCID50 per cell
unless otherwise indicated in the figure. Of note, to maintain consistency, the MOI
was calculated throughout the manuscript based on the titration of virus stocks in
LLC-MK2 cells, regardless of the cell type infected.
Purified defective particles preparation. Purified defective particles (pDPs)
preparation was performed as previously described10. Briefly, allantoic fluid from
100 SeV Cantell-infected embryonated eggs was concentrated by high-speed
centrifugation. The resulting pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/2 mM EDTA
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was then added on top of a 5–45%
endotoxin free sucrose (Fisher) gradient prepared using a gradient maker
(BioComp). Gradients were centrifuged at 28,000 rpm (133,907 × g) for 1.5 h and
the fraction containing low-density viral particles was collected and re-purified
using the same procedure. Final low-density fractions were concentrated by
centrifugation at 21,000 r.p.m. (75,619 × g) for 2 h. Pellets were suspended in PBS
and stored at −80 °C. The content of pDPs particles was determined by calculating
the TCID50/HA ratio as reflection of infectious over non-infectious particles as
described previously10. pDPs used in this study had a TCID50/HA ratio of 96.9.
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitro-
gen) according to the manufacturer’s specifications and 1–2 μg of RNA was reverse
transcribed using the High Capacity RNA-to cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems).
cDNA was amplified with specific primers in the presence of SYBR green (Applied
Biosystem). qPCR reactions were performed in triplicates using an Applied
Biosystem ViiA7 Real-time Lightcycler. For the primers used, see Supplementary
Table 1. For FL-gSeV and SeV DVGs detection, 1–2 μg of isolated total RNA were
reverse transcribed with specific primers for DVG (5′ GGTGAGGAATCTATAC
GTTATAC 3′) and FL-gSeV (5′-TGTTCTTACTAGGACAAG-3′) using
Superscript III without RNaseH activity to avoid self-priming. Recombinant RNase
H (Invitrogen) was later added to the reverse transcribed samples. cDNA was
amplified with viral product-specific qPCR primers listed in Supplementary Table 1
in the presence of SYBR green (Applied Biosystem). Copy numbers were
normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. RSV DVGs were detected by PCR
as described in ref. 5.
Preparation of in vitro transcribed DVG RNA. To generate in vitro transcribed
SeV DVG RNA, a plasmid expressing SeV-DVG (pSL1180-DVG546 described
previously45, was linearized and in vitro transcribed using the MEGAscript T7 kit
(Ambion) in the presence of RNase inhibitors (Invitrogen). The resulting products
were then treated with DNase and then precipitated with LiCl (both included in the
MEGAscript T7 kit). All in vitro transcribed DVG RNA had a optical density 260
nm (OD260)/OD280 ratio of 2.00–2.25, and a OD260/OD230 ratio of 2.20–2.60.
RNA FISH and immunofluorescence staining. RNA fluorescence in situ hybri-
dization (RNA FISH) was performed according to published protocols with some
modifications45. The probes used for both SeV and RSV detection were single
stranded DNA oligos (20 nucleotides) each labeled with one fluorophore (Quasar
570 or Quasar 670, Biosearch Technologies). Briefly, probes detecting positive
sense (+) FL-gSeV genome and most viral mRNA targeted position 1 to 11,151 of
the SeV genome (GenBank: AB855654.1, excluding the 5ʹ end that encompasses the
DVG sequences) and labeled with Quasar 570; probes detecting positive sense (+)
DVGs targeted position 14,944 to 15340 of the SeV genome and were labeled with
Quasar 670 (targeted sequence for each probe is listed in Supplementary Table 2).
For detecting negative sense FL-gSeV, a pool of Quasar-570-labeled probes target
position 1 to 13,685 of the negative sense FL-gSeV was used (targeted sequence for
each probe is listed in Supplementary Table 3). For RSV FISH probes: a pool of 32
probes detecting positive sense FL-gRSV genome were designed targeting from
position 1 to 11959 of the RSV genome (GenBank: AF035006, excluding the 5ʹ end
that encompasses the RSV DVG sequences) and labeled with Quasar 570; probes
detecting positive sense copy-back RSV DVGs targeted position 14,923 to 15,222 of
the RSV genome and were labeled with Quasar 670 (targeted sequence for each
probe is listed in Supplementary Table 4).
For RNA FISH, cells were plated onto coverslips (Corning) at a density of
4 × 105 cells per well in six-well plates and grown overnight at 37 °C. The cells were
washed once with ice-cold PBS followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde in PBS
for 10 min and then permeabilized in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were then
equilibrated in wash buffer containing 10 % formamide and 2× saline sodium
citrate (SSC, 1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate, all from Thermo
Fisher Scientific). RNA FISH was performed by hybridizing fixed cells with probes
(125 nM for SeV and 250 nM for RSV) diluted in 50 μl hybridization buffer
consisting of 10 % formamide, 2× SSC, and 10 % (wt/vol) dextran sulfate.
Hybridization was performed overnight in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. Nuclear
staining using 0.5 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) was performed afterwards
and the coverslides were mounted in GLOX anti-fade media (10% glucose, 1 M
Tris-HCl pH8.0, glucose oxidase, catalase, diluted in 2× SSC; all from Sigma) before
imaging. For RNA FISH coupled with immunofluorescence (IF) (RNA FISH-IF),
fixed cells were permeabilized with 70% ethanol for 1 h. Permeabilized cells were
then incubated with anti-human active caspase-3 antibody (1:100 dilution; Cell
Signaling, cat. no. 9661) or anti-human cleaved PARP-1 antibody (1:100 dilution;
Cell Signaling, cat. no. 5625) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit
IgG (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen, cat. no. R37116) diluted in 1% BSA in the presence
of 40 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen, cat. no. 10777-019). Stained cells were
incubated in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min prior to RNA FISH, washed with PBS,
and then equilibrated in wash buffer. RNA FISH was then performed as described
above.
Wide-field and fluorescence microscopy and image processing. Fluorescence
imaging acquisition was performed with a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope
equipped with a × 20, × 40 and a × 100-1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion
objective (Zeiss) and a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera. Bright field image acquisition
was performed on an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope equipped with a ×20
objective and a Spot Idea 5 MP Scientific Digital camera system (Diagnostic
Instrument). Images were processed using Volocity LE (PerkinElmer).
Image analysis and quantification. Image analysis and quantification were
performed using the Meta-morph software (Molecular Devices). Exposure time,
gain, and offset were held constant for all images. The multi-wavelength cell-
scoring module was applied to determine average fluorescent intensity of Quasar
570, Quasar 670 probe signals, or targeted host protein signals in each cell. Pixel
brightness of the signals in multiple empty areas of each image was used as a
reference to set the threshold for positive staining of probes/antibodies. Because of
the bi-color FISH probe design strategy for distinguishing DVG from FL-gSeV,
each individual cell was quantified for their viral RNA content as a ratio of
Quasar 670 versus Quasar 570 probe signal fluorescent intensity (gSeV/DVG
or gRSV/DVG). For image quantification of SeV infected cells, a ratio below 0.8
was considered as FL-high cells, between 0.8 and 1.0 as intermediate (INT) and
above 1.0 as DVG-high. For image quantification of RSV infected cells, a ratio

11
 below 0.5 was considered as FL-high cells, between 0.5 and 0.8 as INT and above
0.8 as DVG-high. For quantifying FISH coupled with active caspase-3 staining
images, same threshold value of gSeV/DVG or gRSV/DVG ratio was used to
categorize cells into FL-high or DVG-high. Positive scoring using a set threshold
for positive staining identified active-caspase 3 positive and negative cells. The
percentage of active caspase-3 positive cells among FL-high and DVG-high cells
was then calculated based on the score. All image quantifications shown were
obtained from at least 500 cells from four different fields in each repeat through at
least three independently repeated experiments.
RNA FISH-FLOW and FACS sorting. The procedure described previously for RNA-
FISH of cells fixed in slides was used for RNA FISH-FLOW except that cells were kept
in suspension throughout the staining process. Briefly, cells were trypsinized to release
them from monolayers, resuspended in 1% FBS/PBS, and fixed and permeabilized in
100% methanol for at least 15 min on ice. Hybridization was performed in 100 μl
hybridization buffer containing 1.25 μM RNA FISH probes for 16 h in a humidified
chamber at 37 °C. Cells were suspended in GLOX anti-fade media before flow
cytometry/FACS. For live/dead staining, trypsinized cells were incubated with efluor-
506 fixable viability dye (L/D Aqua, eBioscience) and diluted in 1% FBS/PBS in the
presence of 40 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) prior to fixation. Data were
acquired in a BD LSRFortessa instrument (filter 582/15-Green for the detection of
Quasar 570-gSeV probe; 670/30-Red for the detection of Quasar 670-DVG probe;
515/30-Blue for the detection of L/D staining). A BD FACSAria II instrument was
used for sorting RNA FISH hybridized cells. Sorted cells (≥90% purity from
parental gate) were centrifuged and put in TRIzol (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction
and RNA-Seq analysis. Flow cytometry data analysis was performed using the BD
FACSDiva (BD Bioscience) or FlowJo (Tree Star) softwares.
RNA-Seq of FISH FACS-sorted cells. Four sub-populations of cells (ND, FL-high,
DVG-high and INT) were sorted from infected cultures after RNA FISH. RNA-Seq
was performed in two replicates where the RNA of each replicate was a pool from
three independent FISH-FACS sortings (six independent sortings in total). RNA
samples from FISH-FACS-sorted cells were prepared as follows: RNA extracted
using TRIzol reagent was re-purified using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quality of the RNA was assessed by using the RNA Pico
6000 module on an Agilent Tapestation 2100 (Agilent Technologies). A schematic
diagram for the FISH-FACS-sorting pipeline coupled with RNA-Seq is provided in
Supplementary Fig. 5a. Briefly, total cDNA libraries were prepared starting from
75 ng of extracted raw RNA using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT kit
with Ribo-Zero Gold, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were
run on a Illumina NextSeq500 instrument to generate 75 bp, single-end reads,
resulting in 21–53 million reads per sample with an average Q30 score ≥96.8%. All
data were processed and analyzed using R programming language (v 3.2.2, R core
team, 2016) and the RStudio interface (v 0.99.489), as described previously46.
For host transcriptome analysis, raw fastq files were mapped to the human
transcriptome (cDNA; Ensembl release 86) using Kallisto with 60 bootstraps
per sample46, 47. Annotation and summarization of transcripts to genes was carried
out in R, using the TxImport package48. Differentially expressed genes (≥twofold
and ≤ 1% false discovery rate) were identified by linear modeling and Bayesian
statistics using the VOOM function in Limma package49, 50. Gene Ontology (GO)
was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration of
Data (DAVID)51. GSEA was analyzed through the Molecular Signatures Database
(MSigDB) using the C2 canonical pathway collection52. For genome alignment, seq
reads from duplicates of each population were combined and aligned to the full
length genome of SeV strain Cantell using the Subread aligner in the RSubread
package53. This allowed us to extract the viral reads from the total. Resulting BAM
files were visualized as a track on the full length SeV Cantell genome using the
Genious software (version 7.1.9, Biomatters develop team) to obtain the
different coverages of viral reads from each of the four populations.
TNFR2 extracellular staining for flow cytometry. Extracellular staining of
TNFR2 on A549 cells for flow cytometry was performed as follows: cells harvested
in 1% FBS/PBS were stained with anti-human-TNFR2 antibodies (2 µg/106 cells,
R&D system, cat. no. AF726) in 1% FBS/PBS on ice for 40 min, washed three
times with 1% FBS/PBS and then subjected to secondary antibody staining with
goat anti-donkey Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Invitrogen; 1:1000 diluted in 1% FBS
PBS) on ice for 30 min. Stained cells were acquired in a BD LSRFortessa instrument
and analyzed using the FlowJo (Tree Star) software.
TNFα neutralization and supplementation of infected cells. For TNFα
neutralization experiments, 70–80% confluent A549 cells were pre-treated with
neutralizing antibody against TNFα, TNFR1, and/or TNFR2 (all from R&D system,
cat. nos. AF-210-NA, MAB225, and AF726, respectively) at 2 µg/ml/antibody
or with IgG control antibody (R&D system, cat. no. MAB002) at the same
concentration diluted in 400 µl of DMEM-2% FBS culture media. After 3–4 h,
pre-treated cells were infected with SeV HD at a MOI of 1.5 diluted in 100 µl of the
same media. Samples were collected after 20 and 30 h post infection for analysis.
For long-term sub-culture, cells were treated with control IgG or TNFR2
neutralizing antibody on days 1, 3, and 5 post SeV HD infection and treated cells
were split and re-plated at the same cell number. Media was changed every
3–5 days depending on the condition of the cells. For TNFα supplementation
experiments, human recombinant TNFα (Peprotech) was added to the media of
infected cells at the indicated doses after 16 h of SeV HD infection. Samples were
collected 8 h post treatment for further analysis.
RNA interference. siRNAs for human TRAF1 (ON-TARGET plus smart pool,
7185, including 4 target sequences: GAAGGACGACACAAUGUUC, GAACU-
CAGGAGAAGGCUCA, GGAAAGAGAACCCAUCUGU, UGUGGAAGAU-
CACCAAUGU), human BIRC3 (ON-TARGET plus smart pool, 330, including
four target sequences: CAUGUGAACUGUACCGAAU, UAACGAAAAUGCCA-
GAUUA, GUUCAUCCGUCAAGUUCAA, UCAACUGCCGGAAUUAUUA) and
the ON-TARGET plus non-targeting control pool were obtained from GE health,
Dharmacon. Briefly, 3 × 104 A549 cells were transfected with 50 μM of siRNAs
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacture’s protocol. After 16 h of incubation, media was replaced with com-
plete cell culture media without antibiotics. After 40 h of transfection, cells were
infected with SeV HD (MOI = 1.5 TCID50 per cell) for 24 h. Cells were harvested
with TRIzol for RNA preparations, put in P-40 lysis buffer for protein preparations,
or fixed with 4% formaldehyde for image analysis. As control, cells were treated
with equal amount of non-targeting scramble siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAi-
MAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism
version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A statistically significant
difference was defined as a P < 0.05 by either one-way or two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), significance of variance (F value), or Student’s t with or
without a post hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons on the basis of specific
data sets as indicated in each figure legend.
Data availability. The RNA-Seq data that support the findings of this study have
been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for public access
(GSE96774). All other data are available upon request from the corresponding
