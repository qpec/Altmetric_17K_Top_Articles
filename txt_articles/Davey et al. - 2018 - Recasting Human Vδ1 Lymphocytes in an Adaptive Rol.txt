Recasting Human Vd1 Lymphocytes in an
Adaptive Role
Martin S. Davey,1,3 Carrie R. Willcox,1,3 Alfie T. Baker,1 Stuart Hunter,1,2 and Benjamin E. Willcox1,*
gd T cells are unconventional lymphocytes commonly described as ‘innate-like’
in function, which can respond in both a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent and
also major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted TCR-dependent man-
ner. While the relative importance of TCR recognition had remained unclear,
recent studies revealed that human Vd1 T cells display unexpected parallels with
adaptive ab T cells. Vd1 T cells undergo profound and highly focussed clonal
expansion from an initially diverse and private TCR repertoire, most likely in
response to specific immune challenges. Concomitantly, they differentiate from
a Vd1 T cell naïve (Tnaïve) to a Vd1 T cell effector (Teffector) phenotype, marked by the
downregulation of lymphoid homing receptors and upregulation of peripheral
homing receptors and effector markers. This suggests that an adaptive paradigm
applies to Vd1 T cells, likely involving TCR-dependent but MHC-unrestricted
responses to microbial and non-microbial challenges.
gd T Cells and the Lymphoid Stress Surveillance Hypothesis
gd T cells have coevolved alongside ab T cells and B cells for at least the past �450 million
years of vertebrate evolution [1,2], each distinguished by related but distinct somatically
recombined antigen receptors. However, our understanding of these different lineages is
strikingly imbalanced. Critical to our understanding of ab T cell and B cells is the classical
adaptive paradigm (Box 1). Within this, seminal discoveries have established the core function
of the ab T cell lineage: to enable immune responses to target cells based on the presence on
their surface of antigenic peptide in the context of MHC molecules; similarly, we understand
that B cells, which underpin humoral immunity, enable the production of soluble antibodies
capable of recognising a diverse range of antigenic targets in native, 3D conformation. In
keeping with Burnet’s suggestion that ‘receptor occupation’ is key in driving the activation and
clonal selection of adaptive lymphocytes [3], structural studies have confirmed both the
involvement of clonotypically unique hypervariable loops in ab TCR/peptide-MHC and B cell
receptor (BCR)/antigen engagement, and the significance of such interactions in regulating
multiple facets of their immunobiology (Box 1).
Originally identified serendipitously during studies defining ab TCR genes [4,5] gd T cells have
by contrast remained somewhat mysterious both in terms of the immunological niche they
occupy and the key reason(s) for their evolutionary preservation as a third lymphocyte lineage
within vertebrate immunity. Moreover, although gd T cells are implicated in a range of immune
settings, including antimicrobial immunity, antitumour immunity, and tissue homeostasis
(reviewed in [6]), the central paradigms that govern their development and antigen recognition
functions are unresolved. Finally, despite remaining a focus of ongoing interest, the closely
related issue of the importance and exact role of gd TCR occupation in gd T cell biology remains
a central question.
Highlights
Vd1 T cells are the predominant tissue-
associated gd T cell subset in humans,
and can recognise signs of cellular
dysregulation, including viral infection
and transformation. They are often
assumed to be innate-like effectors.
The Vd1 TCR repertoire is initially
diverse, yet a few clonotypes typically
expand 
heavily 
over 
time. 
Such
expanded clonotypes are diverse in
sequence both within and between
individuals.
Clonal expansion occurs concurrently
with differentiation from Vd1 Tnaïve to
Vd1 Teffector status, alongside a switch
from lymphoid to peripheral homing
receptors, and upregulation of cyto-
toxic pathways.
This concurrent expansion and differ-
entiation suggests an adaptive-like
response, likely driven by diverse sti-
muli, 
including 
microbial 
pathogen
infection.

 One concept emerging from mouse studies of gd T cells is that certain gd T cell subsets, instead
of functioning via conventional adaptive paradigms, may instead act as ‘innate-like’ lympho-
cytes. Notably, murine gd T cells express distinct TCRg and TCRd combinations at different
anatomical sites, and often display semi-invariant TCR repertoires, in some cases featuring
highly restricted CDR3 regions [7–9]. They can be preprogrammed during thymic development
to differentiate into discrete effector populations producing either interleukin-17 (IL-17) or
interferon-gamma (IFN-g) [10,11]. More recently, intra-epithelial lymphocyte populations have
been shown to be selected in tissues after birth, dependent on the expression of particular
butyrophilin-like molecules (BTNLs) [12]. Such populations of ‘activated-but-resting’ uncon-
ventional lymphocytes are thought to be capable of reacting directly to dysregulated target cells
without the need for clonal expansion and differentiation. These data align with the idea such
subsets may recognise a limited range of host-encoded stress ligands [13], and suggest that
their TCRs act like surrogate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for molecular signals of
microbial/non-microbial stress. In humans, the gd T cell subset that aligns most clearly to this
biology is characterised by a Vg9/Vd2 chain pairing, and represents the predominant peripheral
blood subset (1–10% of T cells) [14]. Based on their restricted TCR Vg and Vd gene segment
usage and CDR3 lengths, presence of common CDR3 motifs, foetal generation, polyclonal
production of IFNg and Tumour Necrosis Factor-a (TNFa) following exposure to pyrophos-
phate antigens (P-Ags), and strong dependency of TCR-mediated recognition on the BTN3A1
Ig-like protein, this subset arguably conforms to such an innate-like functional paradigm,
although the exact mechanisms underlying its recognition of target cells remain unclear. To
some extent, the features of these gd T cell subsets mirror those of unconventional ab T cell
subsets [e.g., mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs) and invariant natural killer cells
Box 1. Hallmarks of Classical Adaptive Immunity
Notably, ab T cells and B cells share key hallmarks of classical adaptive immunity.
Generation of a Diverse Antigen Receptor Repertoire and Tolerance Mechanisms
Both ab T cell and B cell lineages feature somatically recombined TCRs and BCRs, with repertoires featuring high
diversity in their hypervariable complementarity-determining region loops, particularly CDR3. For both lineages,
selection events during lymphocyte development are critical for immune tolerance. ab T cells undergo positive and
negative selection in the thymus; B cells, in the bone marrow, undergo both antigen-independent positive selection,
based on tonic BCR signalling, and processes that eliminate or mitigate autoreactive specificities, including negative
selection and anergy induction.
Clonal Expansion from a Diverse Immune Receptor Repertoire
The selection of individual clonotypes from within the diverse naïve immune receptor repertoire allows expansion of
specific ab T cell and B cell clonotypes bearing receptors that critically enable amplified responses to specific immune
challenges, such as pathogen infection.
Differentiation into Long-Lived Effectors
Concurrent with clonal expansion, both ab T cell and B cell lineages not only undergo differentiation to effectors, but
also permit the maintenance of long-lived clonotypically expanded populations, enabling immunological memory,
whereby faster and more potent immune responses are induced in response to secondary antigenic challenge.
Critical Importance of Antigen Receptor–Ligand Interactions
Diverse studies highlight the central role for TCR–pMHC and BCR–ligand interactions in directing ab T cell and B cell
development, maintenance, clonal amplification and activation, and memory formation, emphatically validating the
concept that ‘receptor occupancy’ is a central driver of adaptive lymphocyte biology.

 (iNKTs)], which also feature highly restricted TCR repertoires [15,16], and have been shown to
recognise relatively nonpolymorphic ligands [MHC class I-related gene protein (MR1) and
Cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1), respectively].
These observations led to the development of the lymphoid stress surveillance hypothesis [17],
which postulates that such effectors, by circumventing the requirement for clonal selection and
differentiation, may provide protection from microbial or non-microbial stress challenges during
the initial phase of the response, before adaptive immune responses have been generated.
A key finding in this area has been that such subsets can be activated not only via their TCR, but
also independently by TCR-extrinsic signals. For example, mouse dendritic epidermal T cells
(DETC, a subset of gd T cells present in murine skin) can be activated directly via NK receptor
(NKR)-mediated recognition of stress ligands expressed on stressed epithelium, independently
of the TCR [18]. Moreover, while human Vg9/Vd2 T cells exhibit potent TCR-dependent
recognition of P-Ag-exposed target cells, they can also be activated by NKG2D–ligand
interactions and are responsive to cytokines such as IL-12/IL-18 [19–21]. In addition, recent
studies on mouse skin and gut gd T cell subsets suggest that TCR signals, potentially mediated
via interactions with BTNLs, are required for the development, homing, and establishment of
their effector program [11,12]; however, these cells can become hyporesponsive to TCR
signals and function in an TCR-independent manner to respond to signs of cellular stress [22].
In addition to Vg9/Vd2 T cells, a second human gd T cell compartment exists, bearing Vd2-
negative TCRs, of which the Vd1 component is dominant. Vd1 T cells are the most prevalent
subtype of gd T cells at birth [23], and the dominant gd T cell subtype in peripheral tissues in
adults, such as the gut [24,25] and skin [26]. Vd1 T cells have remained very much an enigma in
terms of the fundamental paradigms underlying their biology. Based on their predominant
effector phenotype, their potent cytotoxicity/cytokine production, combined with their ability to
recognise both virally infected and also cancerous cells, and their expression of NKRs [27–29],
they have often been assumed to act in an innate-like fashion, similar to NK cells, potentially
enabling recognition of diverse cellular stress signals in target cells. However, here we review
recent data that have revised this picture, and suggest instead that Vd1 T cells exhibit a radical
new adaptive immunobiology. These data highlight some of the most significant questions in gd
T cell biology, including the importance and exact role of the gd TCR that defines the lineage,
but ironically, is so poorly understood.
TCR Repertoire Analyses Reveal Vd1 T Cell Clonal Amplification
The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches has allowed in-depth analyses of
the TCR/BCR repertoire within the ab and B cell lineage, respectively [30,31]. Furthermore,
application of these technologies to human peripheral blood gd T cells has provided valuable
information on clonal evolution within the gd T cell lineage. The approaches used include either
DNA-based or RNA-based methods, with the former highlighting the requirement to purify gd T
cells from ab subsets to avoid contamination of TCRg sequences recombined in mature ab T
cells [32]. One inherent challenge of these methods is the potential for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and sequence errors [33]. In the absence of in silico error correction and
appropriate data handling, this can result in retention of erroneous sequences, often resulting
from single-base errors of other higher frequency clonotypes. Therefore, caution should be
applied when interpreting highly similar TCR base sequences. The availability of public software
packages dedicated to the interpretation of NGS TCR sequencing data (MiTCR [34], MiXCR
[35], and TcR [36]), which provide robust error correction, should alleviate such challenges.
Moreover, since RNA-based approaches are potentially vulnerable to bias, based on the overall
448 
Trends in Immunology, June 2018, Vol. 39, No. 6
 level of RNA differing between cells in different activation and/or differentiation states, ideally
parallel techniques, such as single-cell PCR-based TCR analysis, should be considered to
validate NGS-based TCR frequencies correlate with cell number on a specific platform [37–39].
Such studies have not only shed substantial light on Vd1 T cell immunobiology, but equally
importantly, have also highlighted features of the Vd1 repertoire that contrast markedly with that of
both peripheral blood Vg9/Vd2 T cells and thymically programmed mouse gd T cells. First, based
on analyses of cord blood samples, the Vd1 TCR repertoire at the start of life, which features a
variety of Vg chain pairings, is clonotypically diverse, featuring a range of CDR3 lengths apparently
unrelated in sequence. Importantly, these neonatal cord blood Vd1+ repertoires are essentially
entirely unfocussed: in other words, it appears that ‘all clonotypes are created equal’, with no
single sequence exceeding 1–2% of the repertoire (Figure 1). This contrasts with the Vg9/Vd2
population, which, even in foetal and cord blood, includes relatively prevalent Vg9-JgP clonotypes
that are public (i.e., shared at either the nucleotide or amino acid level between individuals) and are
present throughout life, consistent with selection of a semi-invariant repertoire preprogrammed in
development for polyclonal P-Ag recognition [32,40–42].
A second important finding from such studies is that, in comparison to cord blood repertoires,
adult Vd1 repertoires are in general substantially more focussed, typically resulting from the
presence of a relatively small number (e.g., <5) of heavily expanded clonotypes, and which
often account for a large proportion of the total adult Vd1 repertoire. Of note, parallel single-cell
TCR analysis was used by Davey et al. [38] and Ravens et al. [39] to confirm that these
represented genuine numerical clonal expansions, and were not biased by RNA abundance.
Strikingly, both adult and cord blood Vd1+ TCR repertoires were overwhelmingly private (i.e.,
unique to an individual at both a nucleotide and amino acid level; even more so than TCRb [38]),
with the Complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) lengths of expanded clonotypes highly
diverse, and their sequences apparently unrelated, both within and between individuals [38].
These features appeared to stem from the addition of high levels of nontemplated (N)

Figure 1. Clonal Expansion in the Vd1 Repertoire. At birth, neonatal Vd1 T cell populations comprise a broad set of
private clonotypes. During the progression to adulthood, most human Vd1 T cell repertoires undergo clonotypic focussing
towards a limited set of private clonally expanded T cell receptors (TCRs). Despite this, in some individuals, clonal expansion
and focussing is not evident and their Vd1 T cell repertoires remain diverse. While human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is
directly implicated in driving clonal expansion in Vd1 T cell repertoires, other immunological stimuli are clearly capable of driving
TCR-specific responses. The TCRd tree plots depict representative Vd1 T cell repertoires at each stage of life. Each coloured
block represents a single unique Complementarity determining region (CDR)-3d. Each repertoire was private and clonotypes

 nucleotides (introduced by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) or occasionally palindromic
(P) nucleotides (a mean of 19 N/P nucleotides for Vd1 CDR3) during variable (diversity) joining [V
(D)J] recombination. Both the private nature of the Vd1 repertoire and the presence of such
dominant clonal expansions contrast markedly with the Vg9/Vd2 TCR repertoire, which dis-
plays less pronounced focussing and contains several public Vg9 sequences in cord blood and
adults [32,38,41]. Moreover, compared with Vd1 T cells, the Vg9/Vd2 T cell repertoire features
restricted CDR3g and CDR3d lengths, with CDR3d2 sequences generally considerably shorter
than CDR3d1 sequences. Similarly, TCRab repertoires also display CDR3 length restriction,
which is likely imposed by the structural constraints of peptide–MHC recognition [43].
gd TCR repertoire analyses have also highlighted factors driving such clonal expansions. In
particular, Ravens et al. showed that acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection following stem cell
transplantation (SCT) can drive expansion of Vd2neg (predominantly Vd1) TCR clonotypes [39];
Vd repertoires were also noted to be private. These findings build on numerous studies
highlighting the importance of Vd2-negative T cells in responses to CMV infection following
kidney transplantation and in healthy donors [29,44,45], including spectratyping data consis-
tent with a degree of clonotypic focussing in CMVpos healthy donors [29]. Despite this, the link to
CMV infection is not necessarily straightforward, because both Ravens et al. [39] and Davey
et al. [38] noted that the Vd1 repertoire of some CMVpos individuals lacked clonal expansions,
indicating that Vd1+ TCR clonal expansion was not an inevitable consequence of CMV infection
(Figure 1). The reason for this is unclear, but could conceivably reflect different routes of
infection, greater/lesser dependency of the anti-CMV response on Vd2neg Vd1neg gd T cells,
and/or the presence of ‘holes’ in the Vd1 TCR repertoire in some individuals. Further studies are
required to address these possibilities. Moreover, several CMVneg individuals also had heavily
expanded Vd1 clonotypes, indicating that CMV infection is not the sole immune challenge that
stimulates Vd1 T cell responses (Figure 1). Consistent with diverse stimuli for the Vd1 subset,
expansion of Vd1 T cells has also been noted in response to HIV [46] and in synovial fluid in
Lyme disease [47], while two case reports describe Vd1 clonal focussing after EBV infection in
SCT [48,49]. Nevertheless, infectious stimuli underlying clonotypic focussing in healthy donors,
other than CMV, remain to be identified. Finally, irrespective of the stimuli inducing such
responses, both Davey et al. [38] and Ravens et al. [39] provide evidence that such expanded
clonotypes can be long-lived, and persist for at least 2 years, consistent with long-term
contributions to immunosurveillance.
Clonal Selection in Vd1 T Cells Induces Adaptive Changes in Phenotype and
Function
Davey et al. [38] combined NGS TCR sequencing, single-cell TCR analyses, and a flow
cytometric immunophenotyping approach to delineate different Vd1 subsets in adult peripheral
blood and cord blood samples. Notably, a naïve-like CD27hi Vd1 subset was identified
expressing highly diverse TCRs and multiple markers common to naïve T cells, including
IL-7R, CD28, CD62L, and CCR7 (Figure 2); we hereafter apply the term ‘Vd1 Tnaïve’ to this
subset. Importantly, although such Tnaïve cells were typically a minor fraction of adult peripheral
blood Vd1 T cells, essentially the entire Vd1 T cell subset in cord blood was clonotypically
unfocussed. By contrast, clonotypically expanded Vd1 TCRs present in adults invariably
resided within a differentiated effector CD27lo/neg compartment largely absent in cord blood,
which was detected to different extents within adult peripheral blood Vd1 T cells across a 20-
person cohort. This compartment shared several phenotypic features with conventional
Teffector populations, including expression of granzymes, perforin, and CX3C chemokine
receptor 1 (CX3CR1; Figure 2); we hereafter apply the term ‘Vd1 Teffector’ to this subset.
Importantly, the observation that the Vd1 compartment of the minority of adult donors who
450 
Trends in Immunology, June 2018, Vol. 39, No. 6
 retained relatively diverse Vd1 TCR repertoires was dominated by Vd1 Tnaïve cells confirmed the
validity of this phenotypic distinction, and highlighted that clonal expansion and differentiation
were not inevitable consequences of Vd1 T cell maturation.
These phenotypic features of Vd1 Tnaïve and Teffector subsets point towards an adaptive biology.
First, the transition from Vd1 Tnaïve to Teffector subset is accompanied by a reprogramming of
homing receptor expression. Vd1 Tnaïve cells uniformly express high levels of central lymphoid
homing markers. By contrast, Vd1 Teffector cells exhibit strong downregulation of CCR7 and
CD62L, but increased CX3CR1, which binds to fractalkine, an endothelial homing chemokine.
The respective expression profiles of these markers on Vd1 Tnaïve and Teffector subsets closely
mirrored expression on CD8 naïve and TEMRA cell populations, respectively. Correspondingly,
and as suggested for CX3CR1hi CD8 memory Teffector cells [50], CX3CR1hi Vd1 Teffector cells may
be involved in endothelial immunosurveillance. In terms of function, whereas Vd1 Tnaïve cells,
such as naïve CD8 T cells, were devoid of cytotoxic effector markers (e.g., perforin, and
granzymes A and B), these were heavily upregulated in Vd1 Teffector cells (equivalent to CD8
TEMRA populations). Moreover, Vd1 Teffector cells retained a rapid proliferative capacity and TCR

Figure 2. Phenotypic Changes in Vd1 T Cells upon Adaptive Expansion. Vd1 T cells displaying a diverse T cell
receptor (TCR) repertoire expressed high levels of Cluster of differentiation 27 (CD27). Conversely, clonally focussed TCR
repertoires either displayed reduced expression or had completely downregulated CD27. These CD27hi and CD27lo/neg
Vd1 T cells also displayed markers and functional responses consistent with naïve and effector T cells, respectively. Vd1
Tnaïve cells, alongside a broad gd TCR repertoire, expressed the co-stimulatory receptor CD28, lymphoid tissue homing
receptor CCR7, tissue access molecule CD62L, and mounted a proliferative response to the lymphoid tissue-associated
homeostatic cytokine interleukin 7 (IL-7). By contrast, Vd1 Teffector cells had downregulated CD28, CCR7, CD62L, and
IL7Ra and upregulated cytotoxic granzymes, perforin, and endothelial homing receptor CX3C chemokine receptor 1
(CX3CR1), and proliferated in response to the peripheral tissue-associated cytokine IL-15. Both populations were
unresponsive to innate stimuli (IL-12 and IL-18) but retained TCR responsiveness (anti-CD3 stimulation), with Vd1 Teffector
cells becoming rapidly activated, whereas Vd1 Tnaïve cells responded over a longer period of time.

 sensitivity, and were preferentially sensitive to IL-15 relative to Vd1 Tnaïve cells, which conversely
(and similar to naïve CD8 T cells) were preferentially responsive to IL-7 and exhibited slower
proliferation following TCR stimulation. These findings strongly suggest that the TCR-diverse
CD27hi and highly TCR focussed CD27lo/neg populations represent bona fide naïve and effector
Vd1 subsets, respectively (Figures 2 and 3).
These findings demonstrate that, far from representing a preformed effector subset from birth,
Vd1 T cells are initially highly naïve in phenotype and feature an entirely unfocussed TCR
repertoire. They also suggest that differentiation to an effector phenotype is not an inevitable
developmental process, but is inextricably linked to clonal amplification, and drastically affects
both cytotoxic capability and homing receptor expression (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Adaptive Stress Surveillance Paradigm. Both Vd1 Tnaïveand Teffectorcells circulate in the peripheral blood. Vd1
Tnaïve populations (expressing CCR7 and CD62L) are likely to migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue, via CCL19 and CCL21
chemokine gradients. Access to secondary lymphoid tissue permits encounter of homeostatic interleukin 7 (IL-7), maintaining
Vd1 Tnaïvecells and allowing their persistence throughout adulthood. Vd1 Tnaïvecells may also encounter cognate antigen either
in the lymphoid tissues, akin to ab T cells, or elsewhere, and give rise to Vd1 Teffector cells. Circulating Vd1 Teffector populations
may enter peripheral tissues, accessing homeostatic IL-15 concentrations. Access to peripheral tissues may indicate a stress
surveillance role and antimicrobial function, through T cell receptor (TCR)–ligand engagement.

 between Vd1 T cells and the Vg9/Vd2 T cell subset. They suggest that the gd TCR is central to
the biology of Vd1 T cells, and lead us to suggest a previously unrecognised mode of MHC-
unrestricted adaptive immunobiology applies to the Vd1 T cell subset (Box 2). This paradigm
and the evidence that underpins it, has several implications worthy of consideration that will
likely frame future investigations.
Tolerance Induction
The Vd1 and Vg9/Vd2 T cell subsets develop at different stages, consistent with a distinct
underlying immunobiology and TCR repertoire for the two compartments. Vg9/Vd2 T cells are
generated during development in the foetal liver, and later the foetal thymus, and are only
present in small numbers in the postnatal thymus [51,52]. Development may require positive
selection for BTN3A1 reactivity and/or self phosphoantigens, such as isopentenyl pyrophos-
phate (IPP), and subsequent expansion after microbial exposure during early childhood [53]. By
contrast, Vd1 T cells are the dominant gd T cell population in the postnatal thymus. It is unclear
whether human gd T cells undergo thymic selection. The diversity of CDR3 lengths and
sequences for Vd1 and associated Vg TCR chains would suggest a strong potential for
autoreactivity; however, there is little evidence of negative selection in gd T cells [32]. Alterna-
tively, peripheral tolerance mechanisms may be involved in deleting or inducing the anergy of
strongly autoreactive cells, or other mechanisms similar to NK licensing or arming (reviewed in
[54]) may be used to set thresholds for Vd1 reactivity. Vd2neg gd T cells express inhibitory NKRs,
such as LILRB1/ILT2, which may be involved in this process [28]. Additionally, TCR self-
reactivity may involve low-affinity TCR–ligand interactions and may require additional co-
stimulatory signals or adhesion molecules to lead to productive TCR signalling [55].
T Cell Priming and Migration
Although the cellular mechanisms underlying initiation of Vd1 clonal expansions are unclear, the
immune phenotype of Vd1 Tnaïve cells suggests preferential access to secondary lymphoid
organs, as opposed to clonally expanded Vd1 Teffector subsets. This implies that Vd1 Tnaïve cells
most likely recirculate between blood and lymph tissues (Figure 3), and suggests that clonal
amplification requires lymphoid tissue-derived factors and/or is initiated during a priming step in
secondary (or possibly tertiary) lymphoid organs. Future studies assessing the differentiation
status and localisation of Vd1 T cells in secondary and/or tertiary lymphoid organs will be
required to address these suggestions, and may shed light on whether specific antigen-
presenting cell types are involved in priming. Conversely, the increased expression of CX3CR1
on Vd1 Teffector populations and their enhanced sensitivity to IL-15 suggests that they prefer-
entially home to solid tissues, and contribute to a more clonotypically focussed repertoire at
such sites. Further studies comparing the phenotypic features and TCR diversity of peripheral
blood Vd1 T cells with those in solid tissues will address these issues.
Box 2. Key Principles of Adaptive Stress Surveillance
We propose that three key tenets of an adaptive immunobiology apply to Vd1 T cells. We suggest that:
(i) specific stress stimuli, including microbial infection and/or colonisation, are capable of triggering the clonal expansion
and differentiation of Vd1 Teffector clonotypes from a highly diverse, unfocussed Vd1 Tnaïve pool;
(ii) as for ab T cells and B cells, ‘receptor occupancy’, in this context the ability of the Vd1 gd TCR to engage cognate
ligands, drives clonal expansion and initiates differentiation to the effector state; and
(iii) clonally expanded Vd1 Teffector populations, which are relatively long-lived, provide enhanced protection against
recurrent immune challenges.

 Mechanisms and Targets Underpinning Vd1 gd TCR Ligand Recognition
Defining the ligands recognised by the gd TCR remains a major goal and one that may help
unlock the molecular basis by which gd T cells recognise abnormal target cells (Table 1).
Most gd TCR ligand investigations have focussed on peripheral blood populations. Importantly,
our understanding of the Vd1 TCR repertoire in solid tissues is limited. However, a recent study
highlighted a Vg4Vd1 subpopulation, present at variable frequencies in colorectal tissue in
different individuals, which underwent TCR-dependent activation in response to BTNL3/8-
positive target cells [12]. A priority for future investigations is to understand whether BTNL3/8
act as direct ligands for this Vg4Vd1 subpopulation, and whether the TCR repertoire and
phenotype of such cells reflect a semi-invariant innate-like paradigm or an adaptive immunobi-
ology. In addition, a more comprehensive understanding of the Vd1 TCR repertoire in different
solid tissues is required.
Current data on peripheral blood Vd1 T cells indicate a highly diverse TCR repertoire both in
terms of Vg chain pairing and Vd1/Vg CDR3 regions. Notably, there are no obvious similarities in
the CDR3 regions of clonally amplified Vd1 TCRs, either in terms of lengths or sequences.
Moreover, these features may apply to other Vd2-negative TCRs [38]. The high degree of CDR3
diversity within the Vd1 TCR repertoire, including use of diverse Vg gene segments, contrasts
markedly with other unconventional T cell populations thought to recognise single germline-
encoded ligands (e.g., iNKTs [15], MAITs [16], and Vg9/Vd2 T cells [38,39]), which feature semi-
invariant TCR repertoires, including prominent public CDR3 clonotypes; by contrast, the Vd1
TCR repertoire is both diverse and essentially private [38,39].
Importantly, the high diversity of the peripheral blood Vd1 TCR repertoire, including in
expanded clonotypes, may not necessarily exclude recognition of a limited range of physi-
ologically relevant ligands shared between individuals. Of note, there is precedent for
degeneracy in ab TCR recognition, whereby the same peptide–MHC complex can be
recognised by TCRs of diverse sequence [56]. Similarly, antibodies featuring diverse
CDR loops can recognise the same protein antigen, either via distinct or similar surface
epitopes [57,58]. However, an alternative, and possibly more likely scenario, is that the high
Vd1 TCR diversity reflects a diversity of ligands recognised. This is arguably supported by the
diverse array of ligands proposed for Vd2-negative TCRs [55,59–62] (Table 1). A major
challenge is to make sense of this seemingly unrelated group of ligands and decipher key
underlying principles; however, the basis for making such judgements has hitherto remained
entirely unclear. Based on the central assumption that TCR–ligand binding (‘receptor
occupation’) drives clonal expansion, the adaptive paradigm we outline suggests a set
of criteria (based on clonotype frequency, phenotype, CDR3 involvement, and ligand
expression pattern; Table 1) by which the position of candidate ligands within this adaptive
framework could be assessed.
Re-evaluation of current gd T cell ligands in light of these criteria prompts several observations.
Since reactivities to CD1c [60] and CD1d [61,63,64] described to date reflected extremely low
percentages of the Vd1 T cell repertoire (contributing <0.05% and <0.16% of total T cells,
respectively; Table 1), they are unlikely to represent in vivo expanded Vd1 Teffector clonotypes.
However, they could derive from Vd1 Tnaïve subsets, and conceivably changes in lipid cargo in
different physiological settings may drive TCR-mediated Vd1 clonal expansions. Similarly,
phycoerythrin (PE) [62], a model BCR antigen derived from a marine alga, was also convincingly
demonstrated to be a direct gd TCR ligand in mice, and for an extremely low proportion of the
human Vd1 T cell repertoire (<0.025% of CD3+ T cells, Table 1), excluding recognition by

455
 expanded Vd1 Teffector clonotypes. Despite this, PE recognition may reflect the potential of Vd1
TCRs to recognise foreign antigens in intact form.
One human gd TCR reactivity, to Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) [55], arguably fulfils
the criteria for recognition by an expanded Vd1 Teffector clonotype, albeit involving a Vd5 TCR
(Table 1). In addition, the LES TCR that recognised EPCR was a private TCR sequence, in
keeping with the properties of Vd1 TCRs and the finding that recognition of EPCR was
restricted to a single patient. Despite this, it enabled gd TCR and EPCR-mediated recognition
of CMV-infected fibroblast and/or endothelial cells. Interestingly, although EPCR expression
was not enhanced by CMV infection, LES gd T cell activation was dependent on a TCR-
extrinsic ‘multimolecular stress signature’, which included induction of increased expression
of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on target cells after CMV infection [55].
Moreover, while similar changes were evident in some tumour lines, it is also clear that
overexpression of EPCR itself is linked to genetic changes during tumourigenesis [65], and
has also been linked to chemoresistance [66]. Conceivably, the dependence of effector
function on TCR-extrinsic changes in addition to the presence of TCR ligands could be an
important factor in the maintenance of gd T cell tolerance in the absence of relevant microbial
and/or non-microbial stress stimuli. If, as previously suggested, the LES–EPCR reactivity
proves to be ‘unique but paradigmatic’, then other private ligands may map onto other private
expanded clonotypes. A repertoire-based ligand identification strategy, ideally focussing on
multiple gd TCR specificities expanded in response to a single immune challenge, should
confirm this, and may reveal commonalities between ligands (e.g., expression on a particular
tissue relevant to the specific pathogen infection). In addition, other modes of stress stimulus-
induced gd TCR–ligand-mediated activation could be envisaged, for example involving
increased expression of the ligand, altered post-translational modification of the ligand, or
decreased levels of target cell-expressed ligands for gd T cell inhibitory receptors. Clearly,
future studies in this area, guided by the criteria outlined above, may resolve some of these
key questions.
Nature of Immune Stimuli for Vd1 Responses
Although CMV appears to trigger clonal expansion of Vd1 T cells, the fact that CMV-seronega-
tive adults still frequently harbour major Vd1 Teffector populations indicates that other immune
stimuli, possibly other infectious challenges, must trigger specific Vd1 responses. Consistent
with this, several pathogens have been linked with increased numbers or clonality of Vd2-
negative T cells, including HIV [46], Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) [48,49], and other microbial
infections [1]. Despite this, the link between a given pathogen infection, specific Vd1 clonal
expansion, and an augmented recall response to that challenge warrants further study. Several
reasons suggest that the transition from Vd1 Tnaïve to Teffector status accompanying such clonal
expansions would increase the speed and potency of effector responses: notably, Vd1 Teffector
cells express perforin and granzymes, whereas Vd1 Tnaïve cells do not; moreover, Vd1 Teffector
cells exhibit enhanced and more rapid production of cytokines and proliferation relative to Vd1
Tnaïve cells following CD3/CD28 stimulation [38]. In addition, previous studies have highlighted
Vd2-negative Teffector responses to CMV-infected target cells following CMV infection [27],
alongside an increased proportion of Vd1 T cells bearing an effector phenotype relative to CMV-
seronegative individuals [29]. However, an increased understanding of how such alterations link
with clonotypic changes is needed. Given the diverse stimuli that could underpin the generation
of clonotypic Vd1 Teffector responses, this will require analysis of human samples before and
after relevant infections, and comparison with individuals who either remained uninfected or did
not exhibit postinfection clonal expansions. Such analyses will also allow the relative kinetics of
the phenotypic transitions and clonal expansion to be assessed.

 Evolutionary Advantage of Adaptive MHC-Unrestricted gd T Cell Stress Surveillance
The universal presence of gd T cells in vertebrates suggests that compelling reasons must
exist for their evolutionary conservation [1]. In addition to providing semi-invariant gd T cell
populations that have evolved recognition modes highly distinct from ab T cell subsets,
potentially involving germline-encoded targets, such as BTN3A1 [67,68] and BTNL/Selection
and upkeep of intraepithelial T cells (Skint) family members [12,69], it is interesting to consider
what evolutionarily advantageous immune functions adaptive gd T cell subsets might alter-
natively provide. With regards to CMV infection, the only pathogenic challenge currently
confirmed as driving the clonotypic expansion of human Vd1 T cells, much evidence supports
a role for NK cells [70] and CD8 T cells [71] in anti-CMV immunity. However, CMV has also
evolved numerous immune evasion strategies targeted at disrupting essential components of
CD8/NK immunosurveillance, including the MHC presentation pathway [72], and sequestra-
tion of ligands for conserved activatory ligands for germline-encoded NKRs, such as natural
killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) [70]. Evolution of a stochastically recombined immune
receptor repertoire allowing MHC-unrestricted recognition of ‘altered/stressed self’ via
diverse and potentially private gd TCR reactivities to intact cell surface antigens, would likely
complement such strategies and may prove more challenging for pathogens to evade.
Conceivably, such subsets could also enable direct recognition of foreign pathogen proteins
on the surface of infected host cells. Recent data from mouse models suggesting that gd T
cells provide as potent protection against CMV as the CD8 T cell compartment [73,74] are
consistent with these ideas; however, further studies are required to understand the immu-
nobiology of the gd subsets involved and the molecular basis of the recognition events in
which they are involved.
Concluding Remarks
Recent studies have substantially revised our understanding of Vd1 T cells. The coincident
clonal expansion and differentiation of Vd1 T cells not only represent a ‘smoking gun’ that the gd
TCR is likely to be central to their immunobiology, but also lead us to propose that Vd1 function
is underpinned by a novel MHC-unrestricted adaptive paradigm. This contrasts with Vg9/Vd2 T
cell immunobiology, which appears to be predominantly innate-like, highlighting the coexis-
tence of adaptive and innate-like paradigms within the human gd T cell lineage.
This adaptive perspective for Vd1 T cells prompts a reassessment of previous studies, and also
provides an intellectual framework around which future investigations can be designed, which
should help answer the many unresolved questions (see Outstanding Questions). Of these, the
question of what represent bona fide physiological ligands for Vd1 gd TCRs in the context of this
adaptive paradigm is central, but importantly the repertoire and immunophenotype-based
observations upon which the paradigm is built suggest objective criteria by which to assess
such reactivities and plan future studies. Moreover, there is an expanding evidence base for the
importance of Skint/BTN/BTNL molecules in mouse gd T cell development and biology
[12,69,75]. Understanding the full significance of this family in human gd T cell biology in
the context of parallel innate-like and adaptive-like paradigms is another aim.
An improved understanding of human gd T cell biology will hopefully accelerate therapeutic
exploitation of their function. Despite limited understanding of gd TCR ligand recognition, there
is already substantial therapeutic interest in gd T cells, particularly in the cancer immunotherapy
arena, not least due to their MHC-unrestricted recognition of target cells and potent cytotoxic
function. In addition, the ability to immunophenotypically delineate Vd1 Tnaïve from Teffector
subpopulations should provide a means to probe Vd1 T cell responses against diverse
microbial and non-microbial immunological challenges at different life stages, which would
