ABSTRACT
Background Consumers obtain information about foodborne illness prevention from many sources, including television media. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate a variety of cooking shows with celebrity chefs to understand their modeling of food safety behaviors.
Methods Cooking shows (100 episodes) were watched from 24 celebrity chefs preparing meat dishes. A tabulation of food safety behaviors was
made for each show using a checklist.
Results Proper modeling of food safety behaviors was limited, with many incidences of errors. For example, although all chefs washed their
hands at the beginning of cooking at least one dish, 88% did not wash (or were not shown washing) their hands after handling uncooked meat.
This was compounded with many chefs who added food with their hands (79%) or ate while cooking (50%). Other poor behaviors included not
using a thermometer (75%), using the same cutting board to prepare ready-to-eat items and uncooked meat (25%), and other hygiene issues
such as touching hair (21%) or licking fingers (21%).
Conclusions This study suggests that there is a need for improvement in demonstrated and communicated food safety behaviors among
professional chefs. It also suggests that public health professionals must work to mitigate the impact of poorly modeled behaviors.

Introduction
An estimated 48 million Americans, or about one in six, are
exposed to foodborne illnesses each year in the USA.1 These
illnesses often result in a huge cost, both economic and social,
as those affected experience loss of health or even life.2 As a
source of illness that can be reduced though improved beha-
viors, many efforts by regulatory and educational institutions
have been made towards the prevention of these illnesses.
Many of these efforts focus on improving food safety beha-
viors in the populace with the aim of increasing the hurdles
these bacteria or viruses must overcome to ultimately affect a
consumer.3,4
Foodborne illnesses are a matter of public health, as out-
breaks can quickly affect a large group of people, and can be
especially harmful to those who already have weaker immune
systems such as residents of nursing homes, hospitals or
schools.5–8 Foodborne illnesses find their way into the popu-
lace through a number of avenues, including restaurants,
grocery stores and the home itself. Despite the relatively com-
monplace nature of these illnesses, many consumers errone-
ously believe that foodborne illness comes almost exclusively
from outside the home.9,10 On the contrary, the home can be
a large source of foodborne illness and can even result in out-
breaks of foodborne illness in the community.5,11,12
Consumers get food safety information from a variety of
sources, whether learned in the home, in an educational setting,
from government agencies and through media. However, this
knowledge has been shown to be fairly limited,13 and observa-
tional studies have shown poor practices of these food safety
behaviors.14–18 Studies have shown that educational efforts in

 communities can increase knowledge of appropriate food
safety behaviors.19,20
Unfortunately, even when consumers have this knowledge,
they may not change their behaviors to reflect this knowledge.21
People are habitual creatures and often times will choose to
follow the practices they are familiar with rather than adopting
safety recommendations.9 This makes it difficult to change
behaviors in consumers to prevent foodborne illness.
Increased media exposure to food safety issues has been
suggested as an avenue to increase consumer awareness and
practices of food safety practices.10 One potential source of in-
formation for consumers is cooking shows.22 Although some
studies have shown that cooking shows may not be overly in-
fluential in changing how or what people eat,23–25 they still may
be able to influence food safety among their viewers.26
Celebrity chefs have risen in popularity throughout the
years and can serve as a type of role model for consumers.27
Their position allows them to be influential in determining
food preparation and what is acceptable in food.24 Their
prevalence in our society is so ingrained that even children
have been shown to be aware of, and thus potentially influ-
enced by, celebrity chefs.28 However, food safety practices
have been shown to be poorly followed on some television
shows.26,29–31
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the behaviors
modeled by chefs across a wide variety of cooking programs
found on television and online. The focus of this study was
on recipes that contain meat as it is relatively easy to cross-
contaminate the bacteria from meat during its preparation,
and meat, including poultry and fish, may be one of the main
sources of foodborne illness.32
Methods
A total of 100 episodes of cooking shows were watched
during the period of January to October 2015. Shows were
randomly chosen that were available through either cable or a
variety of online services, such as Hulu, Netflix or Amazon.
Each show was analyzed with respect to their adherence to
common food safety practices.
The questionnaire developed for this study relied both on
expert food safety knowledge and on prior studies of this
nature.26,29,30 Behaviors in the observational sheet followed
the recommended practices from the Fight Bac! Program, in-
cluding Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill.33 The questionnaire
consisted of a list of food safety behaviors, and an option to
tally the number of times each behavior was observed during
the episode, as well as a free response question to capture any-
thing not included on the sheet. Both positive and negative
food safety behaviors were included for observation.
Additional information about each show was collected, in-
cluding show duration and episode, number of dishes prepared
and chef. Shows were chosen that contained meat dishes, as the
likelihood for contamination is greater when preparing meat.
Data were collected, tabulated and analyzed using Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, W
A, USA).
Results
A total of 100 episodes of cooking shows were watched by
the reviewers for this study. These episodes were hosted by 24
different chefs and covered 30 unique series. Episodes varied
between �20 and 40 min in length. The series that were
watched for this review are listed in Table 1.

 All of the episodes featured at least one meat dish, with
some episodes containing up to five meat dishes. The shows
varied in how they handled the preparation of the meat
dishes, with the majority of episodes (84%) preferring to
focus on one dish at a time, though some did focus on one
dish while occasionally checking on another (12%), and the
remainder prepared more than one dish simultaneously.
Preparing one dish at a time, especially when meat is involved,
may help prevent cross-contamination to other dishes that
will not be fully cooked.
The most common type of meat that was prepared during
the shows was beef (40% of episodes had at least one), fol-
lowed by seafood (36%), chicken (32%), pork (22%) and
lamb, goat or other game (11%). Of the meat that was pre-
pared, the cuts that were most often used were pieces such as
breast or steak (75% of episodes), followed by whole meats
such as an entire turkey (22%), ground meat (16%), cured
meat such as bacon or sausage (11%), and the remaining as
liver or other organ meats. Finally, it is important to note that
although many meats were cut on the show (45% of epi-
sodes), other dishes were either pre-cut or no cutting was
needed such as in ground meat.
A summary of observations by chef can be seen in Table 2,
with total number of observations and number of episodes
containing the behavior listed. None of the chefs who were
included in this study were shown washing their hands before
beginning, though one chef (Emeril Lagasse) mentioned hand
washing before cooking once.
After handling meat items, only some of the chefs (7 of the
24) were shown washing their hands, and not after every time
they touched the meat, though one chef (Alton Brown) wore
gloves on occasion when working with uncooked meat. Only two
chefs demonstrated hand washing without cross-contamination
(e.g. touching the same objects before and after washing). Several
of the chefs (7 of the 24) were shown only rinsing their hands
after handling uncooked meat. Half of the chefs (12 of the 24)
verbally mentioned that hand washing should take place after
handling the meat. Almost all of the chefs (21 of the 24) were
observed handling uncooked meat without washing their hands
during an episode.
The most common behavior in the separate category, exhib-
ited by 19 of the chefs (79%), was adding food using their
hands when the food would not be cooked further. Half of the
chefs ate while cooking at some point during their programs,
and 38% of the chefs sampled the food using their hands either
during or after cooking. Combined with the lack of hand
washing shown after touching raw meat, this could lead to food-
borne illness if consumers followed the example of the chefs.
Safe cutting board use, either changing or washing the cutting
surface after cutting uncooked meat, was only demonstrated by
�33% the chefs. Some of the chefs (25%) were shown cutting
ready-to-eat (RTE) items on the same cutting board as the meat,
though none of the chefs who changed or washed their cutting
board were shown to do that. Ready-to-eat items were shown
touching uncooked meat items in some cases (21% of chefs).
Either of these behaviors can lead to cross-contamination of the
RTE items, leading to foodborne illness.34
The method that the chefs used to determine whether the
meat was finished cooking was tracked to see whether the
recommended method by the USDA and other agencies
(thermometer usage35) was followed. Temperature informa-
tion was only given by six of the chefs (25%), for a total of
four poultry recipes, four beef recipes, three pork recipes and
one seafood recipe. Almost all (96%) of the chefs indicated
that color was a good method to use to determine doneness,
followed close by time (88% of the chefs). This is an area for
improvement, as consumers may not know what temperature
to cook an item to, and recipes typically do not contain that
information.22
Discussion
Main findings of this study
Celebrity chefs across a variety of programming did not
demonstrate proper food safety behaviors. Worse, they often
displayed behaviors that would lead to cross-contamination
among those cooking. Behaviors most commonly seen
included handling raw meat without hand washing, sampling
and handling ready-to-eat foods with hands and not giving
appropriate indicators for meat doneness.
The behaviors modeled by the chefs could lead to incidences
of foodborne illness, especially among those who mimic their
behaviors at home. As potential educators of appropriate
cooking behaviors, these chefs instead either ignore food safety
or at best demonstrate only very limited positive behaviors. As
consumers observe this behavior at home, it could lead them to
believe that the food safety behaviors they know are not that im-
portant, or that it the poor behaviors are acceptable practice.26
What is already known on this topic?
Observational research has previously been done on a limited
selection of celebrity chefs and their demonstration of food
safety behaviors. Celebrity chefs often do not demonstrate ap-
propriate food safety behaviors during their cooking program-
ming. Poor hand sanitation, prevalent cross-contamination and
inappropriate cooking and cooling procedures have been shown
on those programs that have previously been observed.26,29–31
What this study adds?
This study included a more broad view of cooking shows
available in the USA, including content that was available

FOOD SAFETY BEHAVIORS OBSERVED IN CELEBRITY CHEFS 109
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article-abstract/39/1/105/3065729 by guest on 04 June 2019
 both on cable networks and online and with a wide variety of
chefs. Previous studies have focused on either a very limited
number of shows26,29 or have focused only on what is avail-
able through cable television.30 With the rise of internet view-
ership of television, it is important to take into account shows
that are still available to public through online means.36,37
Our results suggest that the problem with modeling poor
food safety behaviors is widespread among cooking shows
across a variety of networks and sources. This suggests that
(i) chefs need better model behavior and (ii) that, in the
absence of that modeling, public health workers must not
only promote positive behaviors, but caution against model-
ing behaviors based on television celebrities.
Conclusion
The purpose of this study is not to put the blame on any indi-
vidual chef, but to show that there is a larger problem present
with our food television culture. Whether a chef ’s behaviors
are different on the air than they would be elsewhere, or
whether their good food safety behaviors are simply edited
out due to time, their ‘tedious’ nature, or other reasons, celeb-
rity chefs are simply not demonstrating good food safety
behaviors, and are more often demonstrating poor food
safety behaviors. Although some viewers may recognize those
poor behaviors and choose not to follow them, others may
think that a behavior is fine, or not that important because
they see that behavior modeled by someone who is more
experienced than they are. This is an issue that must be
addressed in a larger public health education context.
Television shows that demonstrate cooking to a home audi-
ence are in a perfect position to demonstrate and discuss good
food safety habits. The idea of ‘good food’ should remain in-
separable from safe food, and the knowledge of proper food
safety behaviors is crucial to making both happen. This study
shows that there is a large gap that needs to be bridged to help
our society improve its food safety behaviors.
It is important to realize that these behaviors can affect the
populace who look at television for both entertainment and
education. Though the producers of these shows may con-
sider them as simply entertainment, and thus not focus on
the food safety aspect, consumers still rely on cooking shows
for food safety information, as well as information on food
preparation.38,39 It is therefore essential that those who
produce cooking shows include basic food behaviors and in-
formation or that public health educators of food safety help
those they reach realize that the shows likely demonstrate
poor behaviors. In addition, public health advocates should
push television shows to help education by modeling appro-
priate food safety behaviors.
