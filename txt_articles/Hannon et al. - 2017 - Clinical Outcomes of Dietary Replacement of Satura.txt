strong evidence that replacement of SFA with UFA may ben-

Introduction 
 
In the United States, 35.5% of adults are currently af-
fected by obesity  
[1] 
, a condition linked to over 20 comor-
bidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 dia-
betes (T2DM), and hyperlipidemia  
[2] 
. Hyperlipidemia is 
defined by low levels of high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (HDL-C), or elevated concentrations of total choles-
terol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
or triglycerides (TG). Lipid dysregulation affects 31.7% of 
adults living in the United States  
[3] 
. High cholesterol lev-
els (both TC and LDL-C) are risk factors for the develop-
ment of CVD and stroke due to their role in atheroscle-
rotic progression  
[4] 
.
 
The rise in the prevalence of obesity is partially attrib-
uted to decreased physical activity levels and poor dietary 
choices  
[5] 
. Research has linked a western diet, high in sat-

Abstract 
 
Background: 
 Obesity and dyslipidemia are frequently treat-
ed with dietary interventions before pharmacotherapy is 
given. Diets high in unsaturated fat have proven advanta-
geous to disease treatment.  
Aims: 
  
The purpose of this sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the evidence 
of the effect of saturated fatty acids (SFA) replacement with 
unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in metabolically healthy adults 
with overweight and obesity on markers of dyslipidemia and 
body composition.  
Methods: 
 Keyword search was per-
formed in PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library for ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of fat-
ty acid substitution in adults with overweight and obesity. 
Meta-analysis was performed on interventions assessing li-
poprotein levels and body composition. Publication bias 
was assessed by funnel plot inspection, Begg’
s, and Egger’
s 
test.  
Results: Eight RCTs enrolling 663 participants were in-
cluded in the review, with intervention durations between 4 
and 28 weeks. Although nonsignificant ( 
p = 0.06), meta-anal-
ysis found UFA replacement to reduce total cholesterol con-
centrations by 10.68 mg/dL (95%CI –21.90 to 0.53). Reduc-

urated fatty acids (SFA), commonly found in animal prod-
ucts such as red meat, butter, and dairy products, to weight 
gain and heightened metabolic risk  
[6] 
. The 2015–2020 Di-
etary Guidelines for Americans recommend obtaining no 
more than 10% of total daily energy from SFA  
[7] 
. An even 
lower percentage, 5–6%, is recommended by the American 
Heart Association for individuals with high TC  
[8] 
. This 
guidance is due to evidence linking a low-SFA diet with 
reduced risk of CVD. Serum cholesterol values are often 
used as a predictor for CVD risk, as high TC and LDL-C 
are strong predictors of CVD mortality  
[9] 
. Current strate-
gies to manage cholesterol levels include a combination of 
pharmacotherapy and dietary modifications, the former 
being implemented after no benefit was achieved by the 
latter. Dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean and Di-
etary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets have become 
increasingly popular with both practitioners who tailor di-
etary recommendations to their patients and individuals 
trying to lose weight and manage cholesterol levels  
[10, 11] 
. 
Among other recommendations, the Dietary Approaches 
to Stop Hypertension and Mediterranean diets emphasize 
SFA reduction with a concurrent increase in mono- and 
poly-unsaturated fatty acids (UFA)  
[12] 
. Monounsaturat-
ed (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) are common 
in foods such as nuts, non-tropical plant oils, and cold-
water fish. These UFA can lower CVD risk through the 
reduction of de novo cholesterol synthesis when consump-
tion is increased  
[13] 
. Elevated UFA consumption may be 
more beneficial in reducing serum cholesterol levels than 
a low-fat diet alone  
[14] 
. It is standard practice for regis-
tered dietitians and health care providers to recommend 
diets high in UFA and low in SFA but often only after a 
patient has been diagnosed with dyslipidemia or CVD. In-
deed, many studies and reviews confirm the effectiveness 
of SFA replacement with UFA for CVD risk reduction but 
these studies and reviews have been conducted among 
populations with preexisting diagnoses  
[15, 16] 
.
 
A growing area of research focuses on persons with 
obesity who, despite excess adiposity, are considered to be 
metabolically healthy due to an absence of comorbidities 
 
[17–19] 
. In order to prevent weight gain and development 
of chronic disease, lifestyle modifications, such as chang-
es in diet and exercise habits, are often the first recom-
mendations given by health care professionals  
[20] 
. Be-
havioral changes are preferred over pharmacological or 
surgical interventions but can be difficult to implement 
and ensure compliance. However, interventions involv-
ing UFA replacement for SFA in individuals who are 
overweight and with obesity have been linked to both pos-
itive  
[21, 22] 
 and null  
[23, 24] 
 metabolic outcomes. To our 
knowledge, no systematic review has been conducted on 
the effect of dietary replacement of SFA with UFA in met-
abolically healthy individuals with excess body weight 
(BW). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-
analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary modi-
fications in the form of SFA replacement with UFA, in the 
forms of both MUFA and PUFA on serum cholesterol 
levels and body composition outcomes in metabolically 
healthy adults with overweight or obesity.
 
Methods 
 
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in 
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
 
Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines  
[25] 
. The 2009 
PRISMA checklist is available in the online supplementary 
 
materials (for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.com/
doi/10.1159/000477216).
 
Study Eligibility Criteria 
 
Studies that met the following criteria were included in the re-
view: adults ( 
≥ 
18 years of age) meeting criteria for overweight and 
obesity (body mass index [BMI]  
≥ 
25 kg/m 
2 
, or waist circumference 
[WC]  
≥ 
94 cm for men or  
≥ 
80 cm for women  
[26] 
, or waist-to-hip 
ratio  
≥ 
0.96 for men or  
≥ 
0.81 for women)  
[27] 
 without diagnosis of 
metabolic disease, enrolled in randomized control trial (RCT) in-
terventions that included dietary replacement of SFA with UFA 
within the setting of a controlled feeding study or among free-living 
individuals. Interventions that focused on management of chronic 
conditions such as CVD or diabetes were excluded. Short-term 
studies with intervention duration less than 1 week were excluded.
 
Search Strategy 
 
PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched from 
database inception through June 24, 2016 using different combina-
tions of keywords: saturated fat, unsaturated fat, obesity, over-
weight, and cholesterol. After acquiring initial search results, title 
and abstracts of articles were evaluated for suitability. Then, full-text 
articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion. A cited reference 
search (forward reference search) and a reference list search (back-
ward reference search) were also conducted based on the eligible 
articles identified through keyword search. Articles obtained 
through forward/backward reference search were screened and 
evaluated using the same study selection criteria. The reference 
search was repeated on all newly identified articles until no addi-
tional articles were found. Two authors (B.A.H. and S.V.T.) jointly 
determined the inclusion and exclusion of all articles retrieved for 
full text evaluation and resolved discrepancies through discussion. 
Interrater agreement was determined using Cohen’
s κ. The litera-
ture search was conducted following quality standards of Littell  
[28] 
.
 
Data Extraction 
 
The review team extracted the following information from each 
article included in the review: authors, year published, study design, 
dietary treatment information (specifically the percentages of SFA 
and UFA), intervention duration, participant characteristics (e.g., 
gender, age), number of participants who completed the study, and

pre- and post-intervention mean values and SDs of outcome mea-
sures. When needed, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were converted from 
mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 38.67, and TG were converted 
from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 88.57  
[29] 
.
 
Meta-Analysis 
 
Meta-analysis was performed on each outcome of interest, in-
cluding TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, BMI, body fat percentage (BFP), 
BW, fat mass (FM), and WC. Two studies  
[30, 31] included multiple 
intervention arms that were relevant to this review, but experimen-
tal groups were combined in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity between 
studies was assessed using the  
I 
2 index. An  
I 
2 index greater than 50% 
was considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity in accordance 
with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions  
[32] 
. For studies with substantial heterogeneity, random ef-
fects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes and 95% CIs. 
Fixed effects models were used when  
I 
2 
 statistics was less than 50%. 
Subgroup analysis was performed within energy-restricted and en-
ergy-balanced diets. Meta-regression was conducted on TC, LDL-C, 
HDL-C, TG, and WC with intervention duration as the covariate. 
Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot inspection, Begg’
s test, 
and Egger’
s test. If necessary, SDs were imputed from standard error 
of CIs from the original publication. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using RevMan, version 5.3.5 (Nordic Cochrane Center, The 
Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Stata, ver-
sion 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
 
Study outliers were identified through sensitivity analysis of the 
four primary outcomes, where pooled effects were calculated after 
sequential removal of each article included in the meta-analysis. A 
study was considered to be an outlier if the resulting pooled effect 
size was  
≥ 
10% different from the overall pooled effect size.
 
Study Quality Assessment 
 
Seven dichotomous questions (1 = yes, 0 = no) were used to as-
sess individual study quality, adapted from Wu et al.  
[33] 
. The 
studies were given a score between 0 (lowest quality) and 7 (high-
est quality) based on a sum calculated for the following: (1) a con-
trol group was used, (2) statistically nonsignificant differences ex-
isted between baseline characteristics of control and treatment 
groups, (3) a high-SFA run-in period was used, where all partici-
pants were fed the same diet before randomization, (4) measure-
ment tools for data collection were clearly explained in the meth-
ods section, (5) all potential confounders were controlled for, (6) 
study procedures were well defined, and (7) bias was adequately 
controlled. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess in-
dividual study bias. Each study was rated as low risk (listing of 
methods used to properly control bias), high (bias not controlled), 
or unclear (if methods were not explicitly stated) on the categories 
of randomization, blinding procedures, attrition reporting, in-
complete outcome data, and selective reporting.
 
Results 
 
Literature Search 
 
The PRISMA flowchart describing the article selection 
process is presented in  
Figure 1 
. A total of 1741 articles 
(597 from PubMed, 871 from Cochrane Library, and 273 
from CINAHL) were identified from keyword search, in 
which 1650 were excluded in title/abstract review. Com-
mon reasons for exclusion included studies conducted in 
animals, children, or adults with a chronic disease, or if 
dietary replacement did not involve UFA. The remaining 
90 articles were selected for full-text review, during which 
81 articles were excluded for not meeting study selection 
eligibility criteria. Reasons for exclusion included studies 
involving postprandial or acute outcomes, studies with-
out an intervention, interventions that did not include 
SFA replacement, interventions that were not applicable 
to the review (i.e., behavioral or physical activity inter-
vention), outcome measures were irrelevant to this re-
view, or participants that did not meet the inclusion cri-
teria. These are presented in online supplementary Ta-
ble 1. Eight articles were determined to be eligible 
following full-text review. The interrater κ score was 0.93.
 
Characteristics of Included Studies and Participants 
 
Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included stud-
ies. All 8 studies included in the review were RCTs, with 
intervention durations between 4 and 28 weeks. The in-
cluded studies were published between 1999 and 2014, 
and involved a total of 663 participants. Three studies 
enrolled only men  
[31, 34, 35] 
. Three studies included ad 
libitum diets where compliance was monitored using 
food logs or communication with a registered dietitian or 
research staff  
[31, 34, 36] 
. The other 5 studies were con-
trolled feeding studies, and all food was provided to the 
subjects over the course of the intervention  
[35, 37–40] 
. 
All studies enrolled a control group that was provided a 
diet high in SFA. Three studies included a high-SFA run-
in period for all subjects  
[34, 37, 40] 
. Five studies utilized 
energy-restricted diets in both control and experimental 
conditions  
[31, 35, 36, 38, 39] 
. All 8 interventions were 
isocaloric between the control and experimental diets, 
and experimental diets contained an increased propor-
tion of UFA in the form of a combination of MUFA and 
PUFA. MUFA were provided in the form of olive oil  
[37, 
40] 
, almonds, and canola oil-enriched biscuits  
[36] 
, and 
both tree nuts and avocados were included  
[35] 
. PUFA 
were provided in the form of peanuts  
[31] 
, sunflower seed 
oil  
[38] 
, and encapsulated oils  
[39] 
. The high-SFA diets 
contained 14–24% of total energy from saturated fat. Re-
placement diets substituted SFA only for MUFA  
[34, 35, 
38, 40] 
, only for PUFA  
[39] 
, or for a mixture of PUFA 
and MUFA  
[31, 36, 37] 
. All studies included a baseline 
measure of body composition and obtained serum lipid 
levels.

Eight studies reported significant reductions in TC, 
LDL-C, TG, and BW in the subjects consuming high-
UFA diets. One study reported null results  
[39] 
. Piers et 
al.  
[35]  
reported a significant difference in TC and LDL-C 
reduction in the high-UFA diets compared to those rich 
in SFA.
 
Effects of SFA Replacement on Serum 
Cholesterol Levels 
 
 
Table 2 reports results from meta-analysis on the ef-
fects of SFA replacement on serum cholesterol lev-
els. Replacement of dietary SFA with UFA was found to 
reduce TC concentrations by 10.68 mg/dL (95% CI 
–21.90, 0.53, I 
2 = 95%,  
p = 0.06). The pooled estimates 
of the effect of SFA replacement with UFA on se-
rum concentrations of LDL-C (–8.70 mg/dL, 95% CI 
–19.17, 1.77,  
I 
2 = 96%,  
p 
 = 0.10), HDL-C (1.15 mg/dL, 
95% CI –4.57, 6.86,  
I 
2 
 = 98%,  
p = 0.69), and TG (–9.07 
mg/dL, 95% CI –23.55, 5.42  
I 
2 = 96%,  
p = 0.22) were also 
statistically nonsignificant. Forest plots are presented in 
 
Figure 2 
. 
 
 
Subgroup analysis for studies involving energy re-
striction found negative, although nonsignificant, 
pooled effect estimates for TC (–12.13 mg/dL, 95% CI 
–27.13, 2.88,  
I 
2 = 97%,  
p 
 = 0.11), LDL-C (–8.52 mg/dL, 
95% CI –22.12, 5.08,  
I 
2 = 97%,  
p 
 = 0.22), HDL-C (–0.79, 
95% CI –2.34, 0.77, I 
2 = 71%,  
p = 0.32), and TG (–14.66 
mg/dL, 95% CI –38.20, 8.87,  
I 
2 
 = 95%,  
p 
 = 0.22) in calo-
rie-restricted studies. In energy-balanced studies, 
pooled effect sizes for TC (–10.48 mg/dL, 95% CI –27.28, 
6.31,  
I 
2 = 80%,  
p = 0.22) and LDL-C (–9.21 mg/dL, 
95% CI –23.19, 4.76,  
I 
2 = 75.4%,  
p 
 = 0.2), HDL-C 
(5.84 mg/dL, 95% CI –10.74, 22.41,  
I 
2 
 = 98%,  
p = 0.49), 
and TG (–2.12 mg/dL,  
I 
2 = 95%,  
p = 0.74) were not 
 
significantly different between experimental groups. 
Subgroup  
effect sizes were not statistically different 
from the overall pooled effect sizes when tested at a 
signi 
ficance level of 0.05. Forest plots for subgroup 
 
analysis are available in the online supplementary mate-
rial.

ration (in weeks) and serum lipid levels. The relevant re-
gression coefficients for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG 
were 0.34 ( 
p 
 = 0.75), –0.73 ( 
p 
 = 0.41), –0.03 ( 
p

0.91 ( 
p = 0.09), respectively.
 
Effects of SFA Replacement on Body Composition 
 
 
Table 3 reports results from the meta-analysis on the 
effects of SFA replacement on BMI, BFP, BW, FM, and 
WC. No effect sizes were found to be statistically signifi-
cant. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant effect size 
for WC in energy-restricted studies, in favor of the SFA 
diet (1.58 cm,  
I 
2 
 = 37%,  
p 
 = 0.02). Forest plots are available 
in the online supplementary material. 
 
Meta-regression found no significant associations be-
tween intervention duration (in weeks) and body compo-
sition measures. The relevant regression coefficients for 
BFP, BW, and WC were 0.17 ( 
p = 0.37), 0.17 ( 
p = 0.46), 
and 0.76 ( 
p = 0.62), respectively.
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
 
Sensitivity analysis revealed the pooled effect size 
changed by  
≥ 
10% following individual study omission for 
7 out of 8 studies for TC, 6 out of 8 for LDL-C, 5 out of 
8 for HDL-C, and 5 out of 8 for TG. However, none of the 
pooled effect sizes observed during sequential omission 
of studies were significantly different from the overall ef-
fect size for any of the 4 outcomes at a significance level 
of 0.05. The removal of Moreira Alves et al  
[31] resulted 
in a significant effect of the UFA diet over the SFA diet 
for TC ( 
p = 0.02) and LDL-C ( 
p = 0.04). Removal of

. Full results from the sensitivity 
analysis are presented in online supplementary Table 2. 
Study heterogeneity, shown by the

stantially altered for any outcome.
 
Publication Bias 
 
No evidence of publication bias was identified for any 
outcomes of this review using Begg’
s test. Egger’
s test, 
however, indicated an evidence for publication bias in the 
outcome of TG ( 
p = 0.037).
 
Quality Assessment 
 
 
Table 4 summarizes results from study quality assess-
ment. All studies used a control group, reported no sig-
nificant differences between groups at baseline, con-
trolled for potential confounding variables, and clearly 
stated randomization procedures. Four studies did not 
employ blinding procedures  
[31, 35, 36, 38] 
. Seven stud-
ies documented attrition rates  
[31, 34–38, 40] 
. Results 
from the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool report that all stud-
ies were at low risk of bias due to incomplete data 
 
reporting. The full Cochrane Risk of Bias tool is pre-
sented in the online supplementary material ( 
Fig. 3 
). 
Three studies, Hartwich et al.  
[38] 
, Kriketos et al.  
[39] 
, 
and Piers et al.  
[35] showed high risk due to blind-
ing procedures. Only one study, Piers et al.  
[35] 
, was 
found to have high risk of bias due to randomization. 
The average quality assessment score was 5.3 out of 
7 (SD = 0.75).
 
Discussion 
 
This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the 
effect of dietary replacement of SFA with UFA in metabol-
ically healthy adults with overweight and obesity, and 
found no statistically significant effects on the modification 
of lipid profiles. However, the reductions in TC trended 
toward significance ( 
p = 0.06). WC was significantly re-
duced in the SFA condition, solely in energy-restricted 
studies. However, as only two calorie restriction studies re-
ported WC data, strong conclusions cannot be made from 
these findings. Intervention durations for the included 
studies were between 4 and 28 weeks. Despite this range, 
meta-regression calculations found no association between 
the duration and reduction in serum lipid levels.
 
A review published in 1997  
[41] described the effects of 
different fatty acids on serum cholesterol levels, and estab-
lished that SFA are associated with an increase of serum 
lipids, and that UFA decrease serum lipids. Another review 
examining the impact of SFA reduction on CVD risk ob-
served a significant reduction in CVD events, an effect that 
was more pronounced when SFA was replaced with PUFA 
 
[42] 
. Schwingshackl et al.  
[43] 
 found that high MUFA diets 
significantly reduced FM and blood pressure but had no 
effect on serum lipid values, which contrast the TG reduc-
tion described here. Studies involving increased MUFA in-
take have been primarily conducted in the context of the 
Mediterranean diet, which include large quantities of non-
tropical oils, and is considered to prevent heart disease to a 
great extent  
[44] 
. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has

also been associated with lower serum TG concentrations 
in a previous meta-analysis of RCTs  
[45] 
. The incongrui-
ties could be related to the presence of other lipid-lowering 
components within a Mediterranean diet, such as fiber 
from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and higher intake 
of high-PUFA cold-water fish. It is therefore possible that 
increasing MUFA consumption alone may not produce as 
strong of a hypocholesterolemic effect as a diet that also 
contains elevated amounts of PUFA.
 
The mechanism by which UFA alters serum choles-
terol levels has been examined both in vivo and in vitro. 
PUFA directly alter protein expression by upregulating 
mRNA levels and increasing the number of cellular LDL-
receptors  
[46] 
. This increase in LDL-receptors occurs pri-
marily in hepatocytes, resulting in a cholesterol influx in-
crease. PUFA also decrease de novo lipogenesis and very 
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion by fatty acid 
synthase suppression  
[47] 
. These effects are not seen in

diets high in SFA or MUFA. The mechanism by which 
MUFA decrease serum cholesterol levels is less clear. Like 
PUFA, MUFA also have mechanistic effects at the mRNA 
level but act on hepatic apolipoproteins. MUFA have 
been linked to lower levels of apolipoprotein C-III mRNA 
 
[48] 
, a protein present on LDL-C particles and precursor 
of VLDL. By downregulation of this protein, VLDL and 
LDL-C concentrations are reduced in circulation, and are 
therefore protective against CVD.
 
Dietary changes are consistently recommended for in-
dividuals at risk for obesity-related comorbidities prior to 
medication or surgery  
[49] 
. Common recommendations 
for weight loss include energy restriction, reduction of 
sugar intake, increased fruit and vegetable consumption, 
and a decrease in energy from SFA. The exact level of SFA 
energy restriction is clearly established. The American 
Heart Association recommends less than 7% of total en-
ergy from SFA, and the Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee allows up to 10% of total calories  
[3, 7] 
. The 
acceptable macronutrient distribution range for fat is 20–
35% of total calories, but evidence is currently lacking re-
garding the percentage of SFA versus UFA  
[50] 
. Addi-
tionally, more research is needed in both calorie-restrict-
ed and energy-balanced settings. This systematic review 
and meta-analysis demonstrates that there is not strong 
enough evidence to state that the replacement of SFA 
with UFA, in the form of MUFA and PUFA, may alter 
lipid profiles in adults with overweight and obesity. How-
ever, this dietary replacement, in conjunction with other 
health behaviors, may be beneficial. However, additional 
robustly designed trials are needed to confirm the effect 
of dietary fat modification for prevention of obesity-re-
lated comorbidities. Through controlled-feeding studies 
especially, researchers can manipulate the composition of 
dietary fat to achieve partial or total replacement of SFA 
with UFA to determine if there is an ideal balance of the 
2 for protection against obesity-related chronic disease.
 
 
Reductions in WC were observed in the control and 
SFA condition in calorie-restricted studies only. Calorie 
restriction has been proven to induce weight and FM loss 
in patients with obesity  
[51] 
. The findings of this review 
may substantiate the notion that calorie restriction over-
all is more effective for central adiposity reduction than 
alterations in macronutrient distribution. Naude et al. 
 
[52] investigated differences in macronutrient distribu-
tion for weight loss and CVD risk, and found that, for 
participants who were overweight or with obesity, there 
were no significant differences in weight loss between low 
carbohydrate (<45% of total energy) and balanced carbo-
hydrates (45–65% of total energy) diets within the first 6 
months of treatment. These results were replicated in 
participants with T2DM. This review found no signifi-
cant effects on any outcomes of interest using meta-anal-
ysis. The inconsistencies and null results here further em-
phasize the need for additional trials to inform future sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses so that conclusions 
may be drawn regarding effective macronutrient and di-
etary fat distributions for the management of obesity and 
chronic disease.
 
There were several limitations pertaining to this 
study. Only eight studies with small to moderate sample 
size were included in the meta-analysis. Many studies 
were rejected after full-text review, and the most com-
mon reason for exclusion was when participants were 
already diagnosed with disease, such as dyslipidemia or 
T2DM. Study findings are applicable only to adults with 
overweight and obesity and those who have not been 
previously diagnosed with a chronic disease. If this re-
view included all participants with overweight and obe-
sity, it is possible that more studies would have been in-
cluded in the meta-analysis, perhaps resulting in differ-
ent conclusions. Additional RCTs are warranted to 
determine the effects of diet on lipid concentrations and 
body composition among individuals with overweight 
and obesity. Another limitation was high study hetero-
geneity, but it did not appear that one study was driving 
this heterogeneity, as evidenced by sensitivity analysis. 
Though all studies were deemed to be at low risk of bias 
through the use of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, some 
included studies scored as high risk in certain categories. 
Piers et al.  
[35] 
, which had high risk of bias for blinding 
and for randomization procedures, employed a cross-
over study design. Participants served as their own con-
trols, and were recruited from an ongoing study con-
ducted by the same authors. This causes concern for 
 
familiarity between researchers and participant charac-
teristics; however, the sample size was only 8 individuals 
and was proven to not have a significant effect in the 
result of our sensitivity analyses. Kriketos et al.  
[39] re-
ported adequate randomization procedures; however, it 
was not stated that the researchers were blinded to the 
condition the participants were enrolled for. Hartwich et 
al.  
[38] was not a blinded study and did not discuss ran-
domization of participants. But, these biases did not 
prove to alter the results, as evidenced by sensitivity 
analysis. There was no evidence for publication bias in 
the meta-analysis as indicated in funnel plot inspection, 
Begg’
s, and Egger’
s tests. Funnel Plots are available in the 
online supplementary material. However, these tests are 
potentially underpowered due to a small number of

studies included. Publication of large-scale clinical trials 
of dietary interventions, including those reporting null 
results, are needed to add to the growing body of evi-
dence-based nutritional guidance and practice  
[53] 
. Null 
studies are crucial to improve our understanding of nu-
tritional therapies that are beneficial, but more impor-
tantly to identify which therapies are not. Though not all 
outcomes of this review were found to be statistically 
significant, this review and others of its kind will serve 
to direct future research studies on differences in fatty 
acid composition, on outcomes of circulating lipids, and 
body composition.
 
Conclusions 
 
This review provides evidence that dietary replace-
ment of SFA with UFA may be marginally effective in 
improving lipid profiles in metabolically healthy adults 
with overweight and obesity. Reductions in WC may be 
more effectively achieved by calorie restriction than 
modification of dietary fat alone. It is possible, however, 
that these results may be applicable only to adults with-
out any diagnosis of chronic disease, and more research 
is warranted to strengthen the evidence that replace-
ment of saturated fat for unsaturated fat improves hy-
perlipidemia. Well-designed replacement interventions 
should be conducted in these populations, as well as 
subgroups such as different ages, ethnicities, or genders, 
to better understand the impact of these dietary inter-
ventions on obesity and related metabolic disease pre-
vention.
