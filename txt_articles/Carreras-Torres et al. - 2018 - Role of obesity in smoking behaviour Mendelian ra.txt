ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To determine whether body mass index, body fat 
percentage, and waist circumference influence 
smoking status and intensity.
DESIGN
Mendelian randomisation study.
SETTING
UK Biobank, with replication of results from the 
Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) consortium.
PARTICIPANTS
European descent participants from the UK Biobank 
cohort (n=372 791) and the TAG consortium 
(n=74 035).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Risk of current and past smoking, number of cigarettes 
smoked per day, age of smoking initiation.
RESULTS
The Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated 
that each standard deviation increment in body mass 
index (4.6) increased the risk of being a smoker (odds 
ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.23), 
P<0.001). This association was replicated in the TAG 
consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). 
Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in 
body mass index was estimated to increase smoking 
intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95% confidence 
interval 0.50 to 1.26, P<0.001) in UK Biobank and 
1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 
to 2.07, P=0.002). Similar results were also seen for 
body fat percentage and waist circumference in both 
UK Biobank and the TAG consortium data.
CONCLUSIONS
These results strongly suggest that higher adiposity 
influences smoking behaviour and could have 
implications for the implementation of public health 
interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence of 
these important risk factors.
Introduction
Obesity and tobacco smoking are important risk factors 
for a wide variety of non-communicable diseases,1 
but their inter-relationship is complex and not well 
understood. Observational studies consistently show 
an inverse association between current cigarette 
smoking and body weight, followed by weight gain 
after smoking cessation.2-6 The first association is 
thought to be an effect of smoking on reducing appetite, 
and the second could be a consequence of higher 
caloric intake due to replacement of the smoking habit 
with food intake.7 8 Paradoxically, smokers have been 
reported to present with higher waist circumference 
than never smokers.9 A positive correlation between 
body mass index and smoking intensity in both 
current and former smokers has also been reported.2 
6 These observations might be due to other lifestyle 
factors, because physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, 
and alcohol consumption are positively correlated 
with both adiposity and smoking parameters.2 4 
However, general and abdominal obesity could also 
increase the propensity to take up smoking, as well 
as increase smoking intensity. People who are obese 
might start smoking as a weight reduction strategy, 
or alternatively, obesity could enhance nicotine 
dependence and affect smoking intensity.10 Further 
understanding of the causal relation between obesity 
and smoking behaviour is important for clinical and 
public health initiatives that aim to reduce both risk 
factors, and could also inform aetiological research 
for diseases where obesity and smoking have been 
implicated.
Mendelian randomisation is an analytical approach 
that uses genetic markers of an exposure rather than 
the exposure itself, the major advantage being that 
germline genetic associations cannot be explained 
by reverse causation and are less susceptible to 
confounding.11 An association that is observed 
by Mendelian randomisation is therefore likely to 
reflect a causal relation.12-14 Genetic variants that are 
associated with body mass index, body fat percentage, 
and waist circumference can therefore be used as 
proxies to attain unconfounded estimates of the 
influence of obesity on smoking behaviour. Recent

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Smokers have lower body weight on average than non-smokers, but tend to 
gain weight after quitting smoking; however, active smokers who smoke more 
intensively tend to weigh more than light smokers 
A link between obesity and smoking behaviour could have implications for 
weight control and smoking prevention strategies, as well as for prevention of 
multiple non-communicable diseases
The influence of obesity on smoking behaviour is difficult to assess in traditional 
observational studies

genome wide association studies revealed 77 genetic 
regions associated with body mass index, 12 with body 
fat percentage, and 45 with waist circumference, in 
large European based samples of more than 100 000 
participants,15-17 providing robust instruments for use 
in our Mendelian randomisation analyses.
Initial genetic evidence suggests a possible common 
biological basis for nicotine addiction and obesity.18 
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that obesity 
causally influences the risk of being a smoker and also 
of smoking intensity using a Mendelian randomisation 
framework based on 372 791 individuals from the UK 
Biobank cohort, and independent data from 74 035 
individuals from the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) 
consortium.
Methods
Genetic variants that are strongly associated with 
adiposity parameters were identified on the basis 
of results from the largest genome wide association 
study published so far.15-17 These genetic variants were 
subsequently used as proxies for adiposity parameters 
and evaluated in relation to smoking parameters in 
the UK Biobank sample. Details of the methods and 
relevant study samples are provided below.
UK Biobank sample
UK Biobank is a prospective cohort that recruited 
more than 500 000 men and women aged 40-
96 years between 2006 and 2010, and collected 
anthropometric, health, and lifestyle data, as well as 
biological samples.19 Of 487 409 individuals who were 
genotyped in UK Biobank, we used data for 372 791 
European descent participants with valid adiposity 
and smoking behaviour measures at recruitment. 
European background was genetically assessed 
through principal component analyses of data from 
genome wide association studies. Sample quality 
control steps are given in the supplementary methods.
Obesity and smoking behaviour measures
Body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist 
circumference
Body mass index was calculated as weight divided 
by height squared (kg/m2). Standing height (cm) 
was measured by a Seca 202 device (SECA). Body fat 
percentage was estimated by bioelectrical impedance, 
with measures ranging from 1% to 75% in 0.1% 
increments. Weight and bioimpedance were measured 
by the Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyser 
(Tanita Corporation of America). Finally, waist 
circumference was manually measured in centimetres.
Smoking behaviour
Three smoking behaviour parameters were collected 
by questionnaire or interview at recruitment. We 
categorised smoking status as never, former, or current 
smokers. In former and current smokers (n=169 056), 
we also analysed the number of cigarettes smoked per 
day and age of smoking initiation. Cigarettes per day 
was included in the analysis if the answer was between 
one and 150, and we received a total of 113 295 valid 
answers. Age of smoking initiation (years) was log-
transformed to reduce positive skew in the distribution, 
and null responses were rejected (that is, not answered 
or age was lower than 5 years or higher than current 
age), giving 119 939 valid answers.
Statistical methods
Relation between direct adiposity measures and 
tobacco smoking in UK Biobank
To provide a baseline assessment of the relation 
between direct adiposity measures and smoking in 
UK Biobank, directly measured body mass index, 
body fat percentage, and waist circumference were 
evaluated in relation to risk of being a smoker by use of 
logistic regression (ever v never smokers, and former v 
current smokers), and in relation to smoking intensity 
(cigarettes smoked per day) and age of smoking 
initiation by use of linear regression. Models were 
adjusted for age, sex, and population stratification.
Genetic instruments for the adiposity exposures
We built genetic instruments for our exposure 
measures of interest (body mass index, body fat 
percentage, and waist circumference) using single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs were 
independently (linkage disequilibrium R2 measure 
<0.01) associated with body mass index, body fat 
percentage, or waist circumference measures (at 
P<5×10−8) in the largest European descendent genome 
wide association studies so far.15-17 After considering 
linkage disequilibrium, 73 independent SNPs were 
maintained as instruments for body mass index,15 
12 SNPs for body fat percentage,16 and 44 for waist 
circumference.17
We extracted these genetic variants from the UK 
Biobank imputed dataset to calculate genetic scores 
for body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist 
circumference by summing up the increasing-trait 
allele dosages weighted by their relative effect size on 
adiposity parameters (βGP), as reported in the original 
genome wide association studies15-17 (Σi dosageGPi×βGPi). 
SNPs with ambiguous strand codification (adenine/
thymine or cytosine/guanine) were replaced by SNPs 
in tight genetic linkage (R2 >0.8) using the proxysnps 
R package (European populations; Bioconductor) 
or removed from the analyses. All SNPs had an 
imputation quality score (R2) higher than 0.95. The 
SNP effects (βGP) used to build the genetic scores were 
originally scaled according to a standard deviation 
increment (SDX) of the adiposity trait in the discovery 
study (SDbody mass index=4.6; SDbody fat percentage=6.6%; SDwaist 
circumference=12.2 cm); hence, a one unit increment in the 
genetic score would indicate one standard deviation 
increase in the adiposity phenotypes according to the 
discovery sample. 
The fraction of variance in the phenotype explained 
by the SNPs in the discovery study was 2.4% for body 
mass index,15 0.6% for body fat percentage,16 and 
1.6% for waist circumference.17 To evaluate potential 
pleiotropic effects by socioeconomic factors, we

also re-evaluated associations by excluding SNPs 
nominally associated (P<0.05) with the Townsend 
deprivation index in UK Biobank. These sensitivity 
criteria resulted in the exclusion of 14 SNPs from 
the body mass index instrument, two from the body 
fat percentage instrument, and nine from the waist 
circumference 
instrument.

association with adiposity parameters (βGP and

also evaluated a subset of 40 SNPs that were reported 
to cluster in at least one neuronal related biological 
pathway (neuronal developmental processes, neuronal 
expression, 
neurotransmission 
or 
hypothalamic 
expression, and regulatory function).15
Power assessment
Power estimation for the Mendelian randomisation 
analyses were performed on the basis of the phenotype 
variance explained by the genetic instruments and the 
analysed sample size.20 We observed sufficient power 
(>80%) to detect a risk increase for being a smoker of 
1.13 for the body mass index instrument, 1.18 for the 
waist circumference instrument, and 1.31 for the body 
fat percentage instruments in both the UK Biobank 
and TAG study samples separately (supplementary fig 
A-I), with similar results available for former smokers 
(supplementary fig A-II). The minimum number of 
extra cigarettes smoked per day that our analyses 
were able to detect using the genetic instruments for 
body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat 
percentage were 0.09, 0.11 and 0.19, respectively 
(supplementary fig A-III). And finally, we had enough 
power to detect differences in log-transformed years 
of age of smoking initiation of 0.11, 0.14, and 0.24 
using the body mass index, waist circumference, and 
body fat percentage genetic instruments, respectively 
(supplementary fig A-IV).
Estimation of the effect of obesity on smoking 
behaviour by use of a genetic score
We estimated the influence of obesity on smoking 
behaviour by including the genetic scores for body mass 
index, body fat percentage, or waist circumference as 
explanatory variables in logistic regression models 
(ever v never smokers, and former v current smokers) 
or linear regression models (cigarettes smoked per 
day, and age of smoking initiation), with smoking 
parameters as response variables. These regression 
models were adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array, 
and population stratification.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses were based on summary statistics 
for genetic associations included in supplementary 
table A. We used Mendelian randomisation-Egger 
weighted linear regression of the SNP-to-smoking effect 
estimates (βGD) on the SNP-to-obesity effect estimates 
(βGP)21 to detect overall directional pleiotropy biasing 
our initial risk estimates, and SNPs behaving as genetic 
outliers (supplementary methods provides more 
details). The corresponding funnel plots, showing the 
contribution of the SNP ratio estimates (βGDi/βGPi) to the 
Mendelian randomisation estimates, were generated by 
use of the ggplot2 R package (R Project; supplementary 
methods). Additional sensitivity analyses based on 
the distribution of SNP ratio estimates (βGDi/βGPi) were 
performed, namely the weighted median approach22 
and the modal based estimate approach.23 These 
methods are less sensitive to the effect of pleiotropic 
variants behaving as outliers, and to the presence of 
invalid instruments (supplementary methods). Finally, 
to identify individual SNPs strongly influencing 
the association estimates, we obtained Mendelian 
randomisation estimates leaving out one SNP at a 
time from the instrumental variable and plotting the 
resulting effect estimates in a histogram. Individual 
SNPs that strongly influence the overall effect estimate 
would be reflected with a deviating effect estimate. 
We also repeated the analyses on the UK Biobank 
sample separately by sex, and tested the between-sex 
heterogeneity (supplementary methods).
Replication of the results
To validate the estimated causal effects of obesity on 
smoking behaviour obtained from the UK Biobank 
sample, independent summary statistics of the 
obesity SNPs for smoking behaviour from genome 
wide association studies were obtained from the TAG 
consortium24 through MR-Base (www.mrbase.org/),25 
an online platform for Mendelian randomisation 
analyses. The TAG data included the same smoking 
behaviour parameters as the UK Biobank sample, 
including smoking status (ever v never (n=74 035) 
and former v current (n=41 278)), cigarettes per day 
(n=38 181), and log-transformed age of smoking 
initiation (n=24 114; supplementary table A). The SNP 
summary data for adiposity parameters were from the 
original genome wide association study where these 
SNPs were identified, similar to the UK Biobank data 
analyses. We used a likelihood based approach26 to 
perform Mendelian randomisation analyses based on 
summary data for the smoking behaviour parameters 
for obesity SNPs (supplementary methods). Sensitivity 
analyses were performed as described for UK Biobank 
data.

of adiposity and smoking behaviour variables in the UK 
Biobank sample are described in table 1 and table 2. 
As observed in previous studies, current smokers had 
a lower body mass index than never smokers (−0.22 
(95% confidence interval −0.27 to −0.16)). Conversely, 
former smokers had a higher body mass index than 
current smokers (1.04 (0.98 to 1.09)).
When considering the risk of smoking in response 
to direct adiposity measures, each standard deviation 
increase in measured body mass index (4.6) was 
associated with a lower risk of being a current smoker 
(odds ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 
0.96)), compared with being a never smoker (fig 1). 
However, each standard deviation increase was also 
associated with a higher risk of being an ever (current 
and former) smoker (1.12 (1.11 to 1.13)), compared 
with being a never smoker (fig 1). Furthermore, higher 
measured body mass index, body fat percentage, and 
waist circumference were associated with an increased 
risk of being a former smoker compared with being a 
current smoker (all P<0.001; fig 2). Additionally, each 
standard deviation increase in directly measured body 
mass index was associated with smoking intensity 
in current smokers (0.65 extra cigarettes smoked per 
day (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.75)) and in 
ever smokers (1.74 extra cigarettes (1.68 to 1.79); fig 
3). Finally, higher body mass index was associated 
with smoking initiation at younger ages (by about 
two months earlier per standard deviation increase 
of body mass index; fig 4). Body fat percentage and 
waist circumference showed similar associations with 
smoking behaviour parameters as those for body mass 
index (fig 1, fig 2, fig 3, and fig 4).
Validity of genetically determined adiposity 
measures in predicting measured adiposity in UK 
Biobank
Each unit increase in the genetic scores reflected one 
standard deviation of measured phenotypes. A one 
unit increase in the body mass index genetic score was 
associated with a 4.0 (95% confidence interval 3.9 to 
4.1) increase in measured body mass index in the UK 
Biobank and explained 1.6% of measured body mass 
index variance. This relation was slightly stronger in 
women (4.2 (4.0 to 4.3)) than in men (3.9 (3.7 to 4.0); 
Pheterogeneity=0.003). Similarly, the genetic score for body 
fat percentage was strongly associated with measured 
body fatness (5.1% per unit of increase in the genetic 
score of body fat percentage (95% confidence interval 
4.8% to 5.3%; 0.2% of measured variance of body 
fat percentage). This relation was slightly stronger 
in women (5.5% (5.1% to 5.9%)) than in men (4.6% 
(4.2% to 5.0%); Pheterogeneity=0.002). 
Finally, one unit of increase in the genetic score of 
waist circumference corresponded to 10.1 cm of waist 
circumference (95% confidence interval 9.7 to 10.4; 
0.9% of measured variance of waist circumference), 
but no sex differences were observed (Pheterogeneity=0.67). 
These estimates can be compared with the standard 
deviation observed for obesity parameters in the 
original discovery studies that defined the respective 
genetic instruments (4.6 for body mass index, 
6.6% for body fat percentage, and 12.2 cm for waist 
circumference).
Association between genetically determined 
adiposity and smoking behaviour
Smoking status
By contrast with the analysis using directly measured 
body mass index, each genetically predicted standard 
deviation increase in body mass index showed a similar 
risk increase of being a current smoker (odds ratio 1.24 
(95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.33) or ever smoker 
(1.18 (1.13 to 1.23); fig 1). Similarly, one standard 
deviation increase in predicted body fat percentage 
was positively associated with being a current smoker 
(1.53 (1.32 to 1.77)) or ever smoker (1.23 (1.13 to 
1.34); fig 1). The genetic score for waist circumference 
was also positively associated with being a current 
smoker (1.33 (1.21 to 1.46)) or ever smoker (1.24

(1.17 to 1.31); fig 1). The associations of genetically 
predicted body mass index and waist circumference 
with risk of being a smoker were replicated in the 
TAG data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33) and 1.32 (1.15 to 1.52), 
respectively; fig 1). Sensitivity analyses provided little 
evidence for genetic outliers, particularly influential 
SNPs, or directional pleiotropy. However, a funnel 
plot and density function indicated heterogeneity 
among SNP estimates, especially for body mass 
index and waist circumference (PSNP-heterogeneity<0.01; 
supplementary figs B-D).
Smoking cessation
There was no association between the genetically 
determined body mass index or waist circumference 
and the odds of quitting smoking in UK Biobank (odds 
ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.04) 
and 0.93 (0.84 to 1.02), respectively) or in the TAG 
study (1.06 (0.91 to 1.24) and 0.98 (0.81 to 1.19), 
respectively; fig 2). A standard deviation increment 
in body fat percentage was associated with a lower 
odds of quitting smoking (0.78 (0.67 to 0.90)), but this 
association was not replicated in the TAG study (0.98 
(0.71 to 1.36)). Sensitivity analyses did not reflect 
any bias in the initial risk estimates (PIntercept >0.03; 
supplementary figs E-G).
Number of cigarettes smoked per day
Each genetically predicted standard deviation increase 
in body mass index was positively associated with 
smoking intensity in current smokers (1.14 extra 
cigarettes smoked per day (95% confidence interval 
0.48 to 1.80)) and ever smokers (0.88 (0.50 to 1.26); 
fig 3). A similar association was also observed for waist 
circumference (0.83 (0.01 to 1.64) in current smokers 
and 1.09 (0.62 to 1.56) in ever smokers; fig 3). These 
associations were replicated in TAG ever smokers (1.27 
extra cigarettes (0.46 to 2.07) per standard deviation 
increase in body mass index and 1.54 (0.54 to 2.54) 
per waist circumference increase; fig 3). The body 
fat percentage genetic score did not appear initially 
associated with smoking intensity in the UK Biobank 
ever smokers (0.35 (−0.40 to 1.10)), nor in the TAG 
sample (1.46 (−0.23 to 3.15); fig 3). 
Sensitivity analyses in ever smokers did not detect 
pleiotropic effects biasing these initial estimates. 
However, the SNP representing the FTO gene region 
in the three genetic instruments (rs1421085 for body 
mass index and body fat percentage, and rs62048402 
for waist circumference) had an important influence 
on the overall association estimate, and exclusion 
of this SNP suggested stronger associations between 
the genetic instruments and smoking intensity. In UK 
Biobank, the associated extra cigarettes smoked per 
day were 1.23 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.65) 
per standard deviation increase in body mass index, 
0.98 (0.08 to 1.88) per body fat percentage increase, 
and 1.64 (1.11 to 2.17) per waist circumference 
increase. In the TAG consortium, the extra cigarettes 
smoked per day were 1.36 (0.50 to 2.22) per standard 
deviation increase in body mass index, 1.62 (−0.23 
to 3.50) per body fat percentage increase, and 1.82 
(0.75 to 2.90) per waist circumference increase 
(supplementary figs H-J).
Age of smoking initiation
Initial analyses provided some evidence for a causal 
role of adiposity in affecting age at smoking initiation, 
with each standard deviation of higher body mass 
index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference 
associated with a younger age of smoking initiation 
(−0.01 log-transformed years (about two months; 95% 
confidence interval −0.02 to −0.002); −0.01 (−0.03 
to 0.005); and −0.02 (about four months; −0.03 to 
−0.01); respectively). However, these associations 
were not replicated in the TAG sample (−0.01 (−0.03 to 
0.01); 0.01 (−0.04 to 0.05); and −0.02 (−0.04 to 0.01); 
respectively). Sensitivity analyses did not reflect any bias 
in the initial risk estimates (supplementary figs K-M).

Pleiotropy by social deprivation
We evaluated whether pleiotropy by social deprivation 
could have affected our results by rerunning the 
analyses after removing SNPs nominally associated 
with the Townsend deprivation index. The association 
estimates between obesity measures and smoking 
were largely unaffected (supplementary figs N-Q), 
with the exception of the analyses on age of smoking 
initiation. Each standard deviation increase in body 
mass index was not associated with age of smoking 
initiation in the UK Biobank (−0.001 log-transformed 
years (95% confidence interval −0.010 to 0.007)) or 
in the TAG sample (−0.005 (−0.028 to 0.019); fig 4). 
Similar results were seen with body fat percentage 
(−0.007 (−0.023 to 0.010) in UK Biobank and 0.023 
(−0.027 to 0.073) in TAG sample; fig 4). 
By contrast, each standard deviation increase in 
waist circumference was still associated with a younger 
age of smoking initiation in the UK Biobank (−0.013 
log-transformed years (about two months; −0.024 
to −0.003), although this relation was not replicated 
in the TAG sample (−0.020 (−0.048 to 0.008); fig 
4). These results indicate that social deprivation is 
unlikely to explain our observed associations between 
adiposity parameters and being a smoker and smoking 
intensity.
Biological basis for association of body mass index 
on smoking habits
We further explored the mechanistic basis of the 
association between the genetic instrument of 
body mass index and smoking habits by separately 
analysing SNPs clustering in neuronal pathways. We 
observed a particularly prominent role for these SNPs 
with risk of ever being a smoker and smoking intensity 
(supplementary figs N and P). Using the neuronal-body 
mass index genetic score, the odds ratio for being an 
ever smoker was estimated as 1.21 (95% confidence 
interval 1.14 to 1.28) in UK Biobank and 1.26 (1.08 to 
1.47) in the TAG sample. Using the non-neuronal-body 
mass index genetic score, the corresponding estimated 
odds ratios were 1.18 (1.13 to 1.23) and 1.12 (0.94 to 
1.33), respectively (supplementary fig N; and funnel 
plots in supplementary fig B). 
Similarly, the association between number of 
cigarettes smoked per day and neuronal-body mass 
index genetic score was 1.41 extra cigarettes (95% 
confidence interval 0.89 to 1.93) in UK Biobank and 
1.81 (0.72 to 2.89) in the TAG sample. A weaker or 
null association was observed using the non-neuronal-
body mass index genetic score (0.88 (0.50 to 1.26) and 
0.62 (−0.58 to 1.83), respectively; supplementary fig 
P and funnel plots in supplementary fig H). However, 
the heterogeneity tests between neuronal and non-
neuronal genetic score analyses were not significant 
(P>0.10).
Analyses stratified by sex
Analyses stratified by sex did not indicate major 
differences in the associations between the genetic 
scores for body mass index, body fat percentage, 
and waist circumference with smoking parameters 
(supplementary figs R-U). However, heterogeneity 
was observed for the association between body fat 
percentage and smoking cessation. Each standard 
deviation increase in body fat percentage was 
associated with a lower odds of smoking cessation in 
women (0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.76)), 
but not in men (0.96 (0.78 to 1.18); Psex-heterogeneity=0.003; 
supplementary fig S).

Based on comprehensive genetic data from nearly 
450 000 individuals,27 our study provides evidence

taking up smoking, smoking intensity, and smoking 
cessation. These results highlight the role of obesity in 
influencing smoking initiation and cessation, which 
could have implications for public health interventions 
aiming to reduce the prevalence of these important risk 
factors. 
Relation between obesity and smoking
Based on our Mendelian randomisation analysis from 
UK Biobank and the TAG consortium, we observed 
consistent risk increases of being a smoker with 
increased increments in body mass index and waist 
circumference. These associations contrast with those 
attained by directly measured risk factors, which reflect 
an inverse association between general adiposity 
and current smoking status. Previous Mendelian 
randomisation studies have provided evidence for a 
causal role of smoking on body weight reduction.28 29 
These observations highlight a complex bidirectional 
relation between obesity and tobacco smoking, that:
•  
Taking up smoking reduces obesity in a causal 
manner, possibly because of a reduced appetite in 
smokers.7 8
•  
Higher levels of obesity increase the risk of 
individuals taking up smoking, as well as smoking 
intensity. 
The fact that smokers generally have a lower body mass 
index suggests that the effect of smoking on general 
obesity is stronger than the countering effect of obesity 
on smoking. In addition, the previously reported 
correlation between measured waist circumference 
and smoking status and intensity,9 together with the 
supporting 
Mendelian 
randomisation 
analysis,30 
suggests that smoking leads to the accumulation of 
central obesity. Obesity is now recognised as one of 
the most important health hazards accounting for 
a large fraction of early deaths worldwide. Given 
the overwhelmingly detrimental impact of tobacco 
exposure on health in general31 as well as on the risk 
of multiple cancers and chronic diseases,32 our results 
highlight the importance of jointly considering the risk 
of both smoking and obesity in any population or in 
clinical interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence 
of these risk factors. This joint consideration might be 
of particular importance for overweight children and 
young adults who are at risk of taking up smoking. 
Finally, we observed an inverse association between 
body fat percentage and smoking cessation in women, 
but not men. This result could explain some of the 
causes of unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking, 
reinforcing the need of combining weight control and 
smoking cessation strategies, particularly in women.
Evidence for common neurobiological basis 
between adiposity and smoking and its implication 
in clinical and public health interventions
We found that associations of body mass index with 
measures of tobacco exposure appeared to be primarily 
driven by SNPs clustering in neuronal pathways. This 
observation suggests a common biological basis for 
addictive behaviours, such as nicotine addiction 
and higher energy intake.33 34 This could result in 
overweight smokers maintaining smoking at higher 
rates as a result of a genetically predisposed compulsive 
behaviour.35
Study limitations
As in any Mendelian randomisation analysis, several 
assumptions were made, including that the genetic 
instruments were associated with the risk factor of 
interest, were independent of potential confounders, 
and could only affect the outcome through the risk 
factor and not through alternative pathways (that is, 
through pleiotropy). We note that the first assumption 
was satisfied because robustly associated gene 
variants were identified from the largest genome 
wide association study for each obesity parameter. 
Whether the other two assumptions held was not 
readily testable, although we conducted thorough 
sensitivity analyses that did not highlight any 
obvious violation of these assumptions. Secondly, a 
potential confounder of our results was population 
stratification by sociodemographic factors. Indeed, it 
was previously shown that the genetic instrument for 
body mass index was associated with various factors 
related to social class among women, including lower 
annual household income and level of deprivation.36 
However, no such associations were seen in men. 
In our study, the associations between the genetic 
instruments of obesity and individuals taking up 
smoking and smoking intensity were consistently 
observed in both men and women, separately, and also 
when we excluded SNPs that were potentially linked 
to social deprivation. Therefore, apart from the inverse 
association between body fat percentage and smoking 
cessation observed in women only, population 
stratification by sociodemographic factors would not 
seem likely to explain those results.
