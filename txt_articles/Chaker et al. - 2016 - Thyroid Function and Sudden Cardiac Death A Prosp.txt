BACKGROUND: The association between thyroid function and 
cardiovascular disease is well established, but no study to date has 
assessed whether it is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). 
Therefore, we studied the association of thyroid function with SCD in a 
prospective population-based cohort.
METHODS: Participants from the Rotterdam Study ≥45 years with thyroid-
stimulating hormone or free thyroxine (FT4) measurements and clinical 
follow-up were eligible. We assessed the association of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone and FT4 with the risk of SCD by using an age- and sex-adjusted 
Cox proportional-hazards model, in all participants and also after restricting 
the analysis to euthyroid participants (defined by thyroid-stimulating 
hormone 0.4–4.0 mIU/L). Additional adjustment included cardiovascular 
risk factors, notably hypertension, serum cholesterol, and smoking. We 
stratified by age and sex and performed sensitivity analyses by excluding 
participants with abnormal FT4 values (reference range of 0.85–1.95 ng/
dL) and including only witnessed SCDs as outcome. Absolute risks were 
calculated in a competing risk model by taking death by other causes into 
account.
RESULTS: We included 10 
318 participants with 261 incident SCDs 
(median follow-up, 9.1 years). Higher levels of FT4 were associated 
with an increased SCD risk, even in the normal range of thyroid function 
(hazard ratio, 2.28 per 1 ng/dL FT4; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–3.97). 
Stratification by age or sex and sensitivity analyses did not change the 
risk estimates substantially. The absolute 10-year risk of SCD increased in 
euthyroid participants from 1% to 4% with increasing FT4 levels.
CONCLUSiONS: Higher FT4 levels are associated with an increased risk 
of SCD, even in euthyroid participants.

t
hyroid hormone is critical for the development and 
function of nearly all organs and tissues, with the 
cardiovascular system being one of the major tar-
gets. Thyroid hormone is known to increase heart rate, 
increase cardiac contractility, alter systolic and diastolic 
function, and decrease systematic vascular resistance.1 
Thyroid dysfunction, even in the subclinical range, is as-
sociated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular 
risk factors and disease.2–4 Both overt and subclinical 
hypothyroidism are associated with hypertension, dys-
lipidemia, and coronary heart disease (CHD),4,5 whereas 
an excess of thyroid hormone, subclinical and overt 
hyperthyroidism, increases the risk of atrial fibrillation 
(AF), CHD, and heart failure (HF).2,6 However, little is 
known about the association between thyroid (dys)func-
tion and the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD 
is defined as unexpected natural death from a cardiac 
cause within a short time period, in general, <1 hour 
from the onset of symptoms, in a person without any 
previous condition that would appear fatal.7 SCD ac-
counts for >50% of cardiovascular deaths and 15% to 
20% of total mortality.8 As much as 75% of SCDs have 
been attributed to CHD (known or unknown), and the risk 
factors for CHD and SCD are therefore very similar and 
include older age, male sex, hypertension, HF, smoking, 
and dyslipidemia.7,9,10 Additional risk factors include non-
ischemic cardiac disease (eg, congenital heart disease) 
and noncardiac disorders (eg, drug-induced).10 However, 
the predictability of SCD in the general population re-
mains poor, because almost half of the SCD cases are 
the first presentation of cardiac disease.11 It is therefore 
of crucial importance to identify additional risk factors 
other than well-established cardiovascular risk factors. 
We hypothesized that thyroid function is associated with 
an increased risk of SCD and aimed to determine this as-
sociation and possible subgroups at risk in a population-
based cohort study.
MethODs
setting
All analyses were performed in the Rotterdam Study 
(RS), a prospective population-based cohort study that 
investigates determinants and occurrence of cardiovas-
cular, neurologic, ophthalmologic, psychiatric, and endo-
crine diseases in the middle-aged and elderly population. 
The aims and design of the RS have been described in 
detail elsewhere.12 We included participants from 3 in-
dependent cohorts within the Rotterdam Study. The RS 
Cohort 1 (RSI) includes participants aged ≥55 years, 
and baseline data were collected from 1990 to 1993. 
RS Cohort 2 (RSII) includes participants aged ≥55 years, 
and baseline data were collected from 2000 to 2001. 
For the RS Cohort 3 (RSIII), all residents of Ommoord 
aged ≥45 years who had not been invited before were 
asked to participate, and baseline data were collected 
from 2006 to 2008. The Medical Ethics Committee of 
the Erasmus University and the Ministry of Health, Wel-
fare and Sport of the Netherlands approved the study 
protocols, implementing the Wet Bevolkingsonderzoek: 
ERGO (Population Studies Act: Rotterdam Study). All in-
cluded participants provided a written informed consent 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki to par-
ticipate in the study and to obtain information from their 
family physicians.
study Population
Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) or free thyroxine (FT4) mea-
surements made at the baseline visit of the study co-
horts RSI (RSI-1), RSII (RSII-1), and RSIII (RSIII-1). Because 
a number of participants from RSI did not have thyroid 
measurements at the first visit, they were included in 
the analyses by using data from their third visit 3 (RSI-3) 
and were followed up from the date of their laboratory 
measurement. A total of 10 
318 participants from the 3 
cohorts were included in our analyses. All study partici-
pants were followed up from the day of baseline labora-
tory testing to date of SCD, to death from other causes, 
or to December 12, 2010, whichever came first.
clinical Perspective 
What is new?
• Thyroid dysfunction, even in the subclinical range, is 
a known risk factor for coronary heart disease, but 
the association with sudden cardiac death (SCD) is 
unknown.
• In this study, we evaluated the association of thyroid 
function measurements with SCD in >10 
000 partici-
pants of a population-based study.
• In participants with a normal thyroid function (ie, 
euthyroid participants), we show that higher free 
thyroxine levels are associated with a 2.5-fold 
increased risk of SCD, independent of cardiovascu-
lar risk factors.
• The absolute 10-year risk to die of SCD increased 
from 1% to 4% with higher free thyroxine levels.
What are the clinical implications?
• The predictability of SCD in the general population is 
poor and almost half of the SCD cases are the first 
sign of cardiac disease; therefore, identification of 
additional risk factors for SCD is important.
• Free thyroxine could be an additive marker in risk 
prediction and screening in the general population.
• Additional research is needed to assess the pos-
sible additional benefit of the use of free thyroxine 
levels in risk stratification for prevention of SCD.

assessment of thyroid Function
For RSI-1, serum TSH (TSH Lumitest; Henning) and FT4 
levels (FT4; Vitros, ECI Immunodiagnostic System; Or-
tho-Clinical Diagnostics) were determined in a random 
subset of the baseline serum samples (n=1855). For 
RSI-3, RSII-1, and RSIII-1, thyroid function assessment 
was also performed in baseline serum samples for TSH 
and FT4 (the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay 
for thyroxine and thyrotropin, ECLIA, Roche). The refer-
ence ranges of the 2 tests did not differ substantially 
and had a good Spearman correlation coefficient (0.96 
for TSH, P<0.0001; 0.81 for FT4, P<0.0001). We de-
termined the cutoff values for the normal range of TSH 
as 0.4 to 4.0 mIU/L according to national guidelines and 
our previous studies.13 The reference range for FT4 was 
0.85 to 1.95 ng/dL (11–25 pmol/L).14 Euthyroidism was 
defined as a TSH value within the reference range. Hy-
pothyroidism was defined by TSH mIU/L >4.0 and FT4 
<0.85 ng/dL, whereas, with subclinical hypothyroidism, 
FT4 was still within the reference range. Hyperthyroidism 
was defined by TSH mIU/L <0.4 and FT4 >1.95 ng/dL, 
whereas, with subclinical hyperthyroidism, FT4 was still 
within the reference range. 
scD Definition and case ascertainment 
Information on SCD was obtained from medical records 
and death certificates. Deaths were considered from 
study entry through December 12, 2010. SCD was de-
fined in accordance with the Myerburg definition,15 which 
is endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology,16 
as “a natural death due to cardiac causes, heralded 
by abrupt loss of consciousness within one hour from 
onset of acute symptoms.” Pre-existing heart disease 
may have been known to be present, but the time and 
mode of death are unexpected. We included cases of 
unwitnessed death if the person was seen in a stable 
medical condition 24 hours preceding death and if there 
was no evidence of a noncardiac cause of death. We 
considered both witnessed and unwitnessed SCD cases 
for the main outcome, and we conducted a sensitivity 
analysis excluding participants with unwitnessed SCD. 
In addition, in case of sparse information, cases were la-
beled as SCD when treating physicians labeled death as 
sudden or unexpected.17 Case validation and definition 
of SCD has been described previously in publications 
from the Rotterdam Study.17,18 In short, SCD cases were 
adjudicated by 2 independent reviewers. SCD cases 
were coded as possible if there was insufficient informa-
tion in the medical file regarding the period before and 
until death to code an SCD as certain. We conducted a 
sensitivity analysis excluding SCD cases coded as pos-
sible. If there was disagreement, this was resolved by 
consensus meetings. All cases were ultimately reviewed 
by a senior cardiologist. 
Baseline and Other Measurements 
Blood pressure was measured twice by using a random-
zero sphygmomanometer and averaged. Hypertension 
was defined as having a systolic blood pressure >140 
mm 
Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mm 
Hg or 
using antihypertensive medications at baseline (diuret-
ics, antiadrenergic agents, β-blockers, calcium channel 
blockers, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in-
hibitors). Smoking was categorized in current or noncur-
rent smokers. QT interval was measured on a resting 
ECG. Heart rate variability was automatically deter-
mined by Modular ECG Analysis System. We assessed 
the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal RR in-
tervals19: a time-domain heart rate variability marker, 
based on all the RR intervals on the 10-second ECGs. 
For the analyses with heart rate variability, we removed 
ECGs with excessive noise, excessive baseline wander, 
premature ventricular beats, and premature supraven-
tricular beats. Outliers of heart rate variability values 
were visually checked and discarded if related to poor 
signal quality. Pulse rate was measured twice with a 
pulse oximeter and averaged. Serum total cholesterol 
was measured using standard laboratory techniques. 
Diabetes mellitus was defined by an impaired fasting 
glucose ≥7 mmol/L, nonfasting glucose use ≥11.1 
mmol/L, or use of glucose-lowering medication. Body 
mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared. Ascertainment of AF 
in the RS has been described in detail previously.20 In 
short, it was ascertained by using 3 methods: (1) ECG 
at baseline and during follow-up, ascertained by a cardi-
ologist; (2) medical information obtained from the gen-
eral practitioners, after ascertainment of ECG; and (3) 
national registry of hospital discharge diagnoses. Cases 
of incident HF were obtained by continuous monitoring 
of participants during follow-up through automated link-
age with files from general practitioners.12,21 All available 
data on HF, such as hospital discharge letters and notes 
from general practitioners, were copied from the medi-
cal records. HF was adjudicated in accordance with the 
guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology22 and 
included typical signs and symptoms of HF confirmed 
by objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction. 
statistical analysis 
We assessed the association of TSH or FT4 at base-
line, in separate models, with the risk of SCD both in 
the full and the euthyroid range of thyroid function (de-
fined by TSH 0.4–4.0 mIU/L), using Cox proportional-
hazards model. We also evaluated the risk of SCD ac-
cording to thyroid state with euthyroidism as reference. 
All primary analyses were sex and age adjusted. Multi-
variable models additionally adjusted for cohort, pulse 
rate, hypertension, serum cholesterol, diabetes melli-

tus, body mass index, smoking, and QT interval, after 
applying multiple imputation for missing data of these 
covariates (missingness <3% for all covariates). Vari-
ables in the multivariable models represent the most 
common confounding or mediating factors of the as-
sociation between thyroid function and SCD. Absolute 
10-year risk probabilities were estimated, given the co-
variates used in the primary Cox proportional-hazards 
model, according to the Fine and Gray model.23 This 
model takes the competing risks of death due to all 
other (non-SCD) causes into account. We also derived 
the subdistribution hazard ratios for including variables 
from this model. Predefined stratification by sex, age 
categories, and cohort were performed. The cutoff of 
the age categories was 65 years, which is close to 
the median age of our population. Sensitivity analyses 
included (1) restricting the analyses to euthyroid indi-
viduals with witnessed SCDs as outcome, (2) exclud-
ing possible SCD events, (3) restricting the analyses to 
euthyroid participants with normal FT4 values and ex-
cluding individuals using thyroid medication defined as 
hormone replacement therapy or antithyroid drugs (eg, 
methimazole), (4) additionally censoring participants at 
thyroid medication use during follow-up, (5) excluding 
abnormal FT4 values and thyroid function–altering med-
ication (defined as thyroid medication, amiodarone, or 
corticosteroids), and (6) additionally excluding partici-
pants with CHD and HF at baseline, and (7) adjusting 
the analyses additionally for heart rate variability. We 
explored the possible role of incident AF or HF in the 
association between thyroid function and SCD by cen-
soring the analyses at time of AF or HF. Follow-up data 
on HF incidence was available in 6893 participants. 
Furthermore, we compared the hazard ratios of SCD 
with those of total mortality, total cardiovascular mor-
tality, and nonsudden cardiovascular mortality, as well. 
The proportional-hazards assumption was assessed 
with plots and test of Schoenfeld residuals. The propor-
tional-hazards assumption was met for all analyses. We 
also performed a goodness-of-fit test for the Fine and 
Gray model for the absolute risk estimation, using the 
Zou Laird Fine test, and this revealed no linear, quadrat-
ic, or log time varying effects of FT4 in the full or euthy-
roid range (P>0.35 for all analyses). Nonlinearity was 
tested by using fractional polynomials and adding qua-
dratic terms to the model. The best fit was determined 
to be linear. TSH was log transformed for all continu-
ous analyses to approximate normality, whereas FT4 
levels were normally distributed. Fractional polynomi-
als were performed by using STATA (StataCorp. 2013. 
Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. StataCorp LP). 
Schoenfeld plot, Schoenfeld test, and competing risk 
calculations were performed in R (survival and cmprsk 
packages R-project, Institute for Statistics and Math-
ematics, R Core Team [2013], version 3.0.2). All other 
statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS ver-
sion 21 (SPSS IBM). Results of this study are reported 
according to the STROBE statement guidelines.24
resUlts
We included 10 
318 participants with a maximum follow-
up of 21.2 years and a median of 9.2 years (interquartile 
range, 3.8–11.1). A total of 261 SCD events occurred 
during follow-up (incidence rate = 3.1 per 1000 person-
years), and completeness of follow-up was 97.9%.25 
When restricting the analysis to euthyroid participants, 
there were 231 cases. Of the total number of partici-
pants, 10 
314 had TSH measurements and 10 
225 had 
FT4 measurements. Baseline characteristics are shown 
in Table 1.
thyroid Function and scD 
Higher levels of FT4 were associated with an increased 
risk of SCD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.87 per 1 ng/
dL increase of FT4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–
2.86) (Table 2). The log relative hazard between FT4 and 
SCD, and the distribution of FT4 in the population, as 
well, are plotted in Figure 1. When restricting the analy-
sis to euthyroid participants, there was an increased risk 
of SCD events with a HR of 2.26 (95% CI, 1.30–3.94). 
In line with an increased risk for higher FT4 levels, high-
er TSH levels were associated with a concomitant de-
creased risk but failed to reach statistical significance

(HR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.80–1.04, per 1 unit increase of 
natural log transformed TSH). The highest in comparison 
with the lowest tertile of FT4 had a higher risk of SCD 
in the full range (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01–1.83; P for 
trend, 0.022; Table 3). Sensitivity analyses did not alter 
risk estimates substantially (Table 4). When restricting 
the analysis to euthyroid participants with normal FT4 
values, the absolute 10-year risks increased from 1% to 
almost 4% with increasing FT4 values (Figure 2). There 
seemed to be a differential risk of SCD in different age 
groups (online-only Data Supplement Table I). However, 
the number of cases in the younger age category (≤65 
years) was small and the P for interaction (P>0.30) was 
insignificant. Stratification analyses for sex and cohort 
did not show differential risks (P for interaction for all 
analyses >0.40; online-only Data Supplement Table I). 
Participants with subclinical or overt hypo- or hyperthy-
roidism did not have a higher risk of SCD than euthyroid 
participants (online-only Data Supplement Table II), but 
the number of events per category was small. Censoring 
the analyses at the time of incident AF or HF did not alter 
risk estimates meaningfully (online-only Data Supplement 
Tables III and IV), neither did censoring the analyses for 
both AF and HF (data not shown). The subdistribution HRs 
obtained from the competing risk model were slightly 
more attenuated for all variables than the HRs obtained 
from the conventional Cox proportional-hazards model, 
but remained qualitatively similar for the FT4 analyses 
(online-only Data Supplement Table V). In comparison 
with the SCD analyses, the risk estimates were slightly 
higher for nonsudden cardiovascular mortality and slight-
ly lower for total mortality (online-only Data Supplement 
Table VI).
DiscUssiOn
In the current study, higher FT4 levels were associated 
with an increased relative and absolute risk of SCD, 
even in the normal range of thyroid function. The rela-
tive risk estimates were similar in the analyses with only 
witnessed SCDs as outcome or when excluding preva-
lent cases of cardiac diseases and patients using thyroid 
function–altering medication. This is the first study ad-
dressing the association between thyroid function and 
SCD in the general population. Two earlier studies that 
evaluated the relation between thyroid function and SCD 
were conducted in specific patient populations (HF pa-
tients and diabetic hemodialysis patients). These studies 
did not investigate the association of FT4 with SCD and 
had conflicting results.26,27 The SCD-HeFT study (Sudden 
Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial), conducted in HF 
patients, found no difference in SCD risk between TSH

categories.27 The 4D Study (Die Deutsche Diabetes Di-
alyse Studie), investigating 1000 diabetic hemodialysis 
patients, reported a greater risk of SCD in patients with 
subclinical hyperthyroidism.26 In the current study, ad-
ditional adjustment for diabetes mellitus at baseline and 
exclusion of participants with prevalent HF did not alter 
risk estimates substantially. In addition, stratification 
by age and sex showed no differential risk. This sug-
gests that the association of higher FT4 levels with an in-
creased risk of SCD is not driven by a certain subgroup.
Thyroid hormone is an important overall regulator of 
the cardiovascular system.1 The pathways through which 
thyroid hormone can interfere with the cardiovascular sys-
tem are both direct and indirect, as well (eg, cardiovascu-
lar risk factors). Thyroid hormone directly influences the 
adrenergic system where it has a stimulatory effect on 
β-adrenergic signaling leading to positive chronotropic, 
dromotropic, and inotropic effects.28 This hyperdynamic 
state, which causes many of the symptoms in hyperthy-
roid patients, could be one of the mechanisms explain-
ing the relation between thyroid hormone and SCD. Fur-
thermore, thyroid hormones have been shown to lead to 
QT-interval prolongation,29,30 which, in turn, is related to 
cardiovascular disease, in general,31 and SCD, in particu-
lar.18 Another pathway could be through various cardio-
vascular risk factors related to thyroid dysfunction, and 
thus leading to ischemic heart disease, in turn, a large 
contributor in SCD. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has 
also been related to CHD and HF in large collaborative in-
dividual participant efforts.2–4 In the current study, we did 
not find evidence for either hypotheses as including pulse 
rate, reflecting a chronotropic effect of adrenergic sys-
tem stimulation, and various cardiovascular risk factors, 
including QT-interval duration and heart rate variability, 
did not change risk estimates in the multivariable analy-
ses. The exact mechanism for the association between 
thyroid hormone and SCD therefore still needs to be de-
termined. Alternative pathways could be via the effects of 
thyroid hormone on the activity and availability of several 
cation transporters such as cardiac Na,K-ATPase32,33 or 
via the transcription and translation of several cardiac 
genes (eg, α- and β-myosin heavy chain genes).34 
We find an effect of FT4 on the risk of SCD, whereas the 
association with TSH is less evident. These findings seem 
to be in line with previous literature investigating the risk 
of thyroid function on several clinical end points.14,35–37 
Thyroid hormone levels are regulated by the hypothala-
mus-pituitary-thyroid axis, which has a unique set point for 
each individual.38 There is a wide variety of factors that 
can modulate this set point, including illness and ageing. 
A change in set point over time might be an explanation 
why the association with FT4 is stronger than for TSH. We 
do not have repeated measures of thyroid function and 
can therefore not investigate if changes in TSH over time 
could explain the apparent discrepant findings between 
FT4 and TSH. We find roughly similar estimates for SCD, 
cardiovascular disease mortality, and total mortality. This 
was not surprising, because the association between 
thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease mortality 
(mainly consisting of CHD mortality) has been described

disease from a certain TSH value cutoff mainly based on 
data regarding CHD outcomes from large collaborative 
studies. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause 
of the burden of disease and mortality in elderly individu-
als worldwide.40 In high-income countries, cancer mortal-
ity is the second leading cause. Although the underlying 
mechanisms are probably different than cardiovascular 
disease mortality, the association of high thyroid dysfunc-
tion and cancer has been described previously and could 
therefore also contribute to the association found with 
total mortality. The associations of thyroid function with 
cardiovascular disease mortality and of thyroid function 
and SCD seem to both be independent of cardiovascu-
lar risk factors. However, bigger sample size and more 
detailed data are needed to determine whether these as-
sociations share the same or have distinct pathways.
SCD develops within a short time frame, and there is 
limited time to start intervention and cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation. Therefore, identification of modifiable risk 
factors is crucial in the setting of identification of certain 
populations or subgroups at risk, and in screening and 
prevention, as well. In the current study, we were not able 
to demonstrate differential risks by age and sex, but the 
association between thyroid function and SCD was more 
pronounced within the normal range of thyroid function. 
This likely can be explained by the fact that participants 
with a thyroid function outside the reference range have 
a higher probability of being treated, which will alter their 
risk. In contrast, people with FT4 levels in the normal 
range have no indication for treatment and are usually 
stable with very little intraindividual variation, reflecting 
the individual set point. When we exclude those using

levothyroxine or antithyroid drugs at baseline or during 
follow-up, risk estimates only slightly shift toward the risk 
in euthyroid participants. However, in our study, no con-
clusions on the benefits or risks of thyroid medication 
can be drawn. Ideally, this should be investigated in a 
randomized controlled trial. 
strengths and limitations
Major strengths of our study are the number of partici-
pants and covariates included in the analyses. All data 
were collected irrespective of the current hypothesis. 
Furthermore, we were able to phenotype SCD in detail 
and make a distinction between witnessed and unwit-
nessed types. The setting of a population-based cohort 
and the long follow-up allowed for the estimation of long-
term absolute risks. Limitations include possible residual 
confounding and the availability of 1 baseline measure-
ment of thyroid function, not allowing for assessment of 
temporal changes of TSH and FT4. Furthermore, there 
were a limited number of participants with FT4 values 
outside the reference range (190 participants). The vast 
majority of participants in the study were of white de-
scent; therefore, our results might not be generalizable 
to other populations.
conclusions
In summary, we describe an increased risk of SCD with 
increasing FT4 levels, even when restricting the analysis 
to euthyroid participants.
