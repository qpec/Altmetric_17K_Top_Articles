IMPORTANCE Adherence to long-term therapies in chronic disease is poor. Traditional
interventions to improve adherence are complex and not widely effective. Mobile telephone
text messaging may be a scalable means to support medication adherence.
OBJECTIVES To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of
mobile telephone text messaging on medication adherence in chronic disease.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO,
and CINAHL (from database inception to January 15, 2015), as well as reference lists of the
articles identified. The data were analyzed in March 2015.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials evaluating a mobile telephone text message
intervention to promote medication adherence in adults with chronic disease.
DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently extracted information on study
characteristics, text message characteristics, and outcome measures as per the predefined
protocol.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Odds ratios and pooled data were calculated using
random-effects models. Risk of bias and study quality were assessed as per Cochrane
guidelines. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.
RESULTS Sixteen randomized clinical trials were included, with 5 of 16 using personalization,
8 of 16 using 2-way communication, and 8 of 16 using a daily text message frequency. The
median intervention duration was 12 weeks, and self-report was the most commonly used
method to assess medication adherence. In the pooled analysis of 2742 patients (median age,
39 years and 50.3% [1380 of 2742] female), text messaging significantly improved
medication adherence (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.52-2.93; P < .001). The effect was not
sensitive to study characteristics (intervention duration or type of disease) or text message
characteristics (personalization, 2-way communication, or daily text message frequency). In a
sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on
study quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21-2.29; P = .002). There was moderate
heterogeneity (I2 = 62%) across clinical trials. After adjustment for publication bias, the point
estimate was reduced but remained positive for an intervention effect (odds ratio, 1.68; 95%
CI, 1.18-2.39).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mobile phone text messaging approximately doubles the
odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into adherence rates improving from
50% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic disease) to 67.8%, or an absolute
increase of 17.8%. While promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the
short duration of trials and reliance on self-reported medication adherence measures. Future
studies need to determine the features of text message interventions that improve success,
as well as appropriate patient populations, sustained effects, and influences on clinical
outcomes.

A
dherenceisdefinedastheextenttowhichapatientcor-
rectly follows a prescribed therapy. Adherence is the
medically preferred term because it reflects active in-
volvement of the patient and a therapeutic alliance between
the patient and his or her physician.1 This term is in contrast
to compliance, which reflects more unidirectional con-
notations.1,2 Adherence to long-term therapies in developed
countriesistypicallyreportedtobeapproximately50%at1year
after initiation of therapy, with worse rates in lower socioeco-
nomic groups and in developing countries.3,4 Poor adherence
has been linked to successive hospitalizations, increased need
for medical interventions, morbidity, and mortality.5 In addi-
tion,medicationnonadherenceresultsinincreasedhealthcare
cost,withestimatesfromNorthAmericaofapproximately$100
billion being spent annually and $2000 spent per patient per
year in excess physician visits.6
Interventions that improve adherence may have far
greater effect on the health of a population than any im-
provement in specific medical treatment.7 A review article by
Haynes et al8 concluded that almost all interventions that
were effective for long-term care were complex and not
widely effective. There is widespread need for convenient
and feasible innovations to help patients remain adherent to
medications.9 In recent years, mobile health (mHealth) has
emerged as a strategy to improve the implementation of
evidence-based medicine and support public health by using
mobile digital devices.10 The usefulness of this medium has
been explored to improve treatment adherence. Electronic
reminders can be delivered in various forms. The use of
mobile apps (software applications) requires specialized
devices (smartphones, tablet computers, or personal digital
assistants).11 Other media for reminders are pagers or dedi-
cated devices for audiovisual reminders. However, their
availability within usual health care is low and presents a
challenge for translation into routine clinical practice.
Mobile telephone text messaging may be a more feasible
platform to deliver electronic reminders in practice. The tech-
nologyisoldandthereforecanbedeliveredtoanyexistingmo-
bile telephone. Subscription to mobile telephones is ever in-
creasing. According to one estimate, there were approximately
7 billion mobile subscribers by the end of 2014, roughly cor-
responding to the global population.12 This technology is in-
creasingly used by people from all socioeconomic classes,13,14
age groups,13 and continents.15
In recent times, text messages have been widely used as
a reminder and support in various health programs. While pre-
vious reviews have shown favorable effects of text messag-
ing, only narrative reviews of text messages without
meta-analysis16,17 and a meta-analysis18 that included a di-
verse range of electronic interventions (text messages, audio-
visual reminders, pagers, and beepers) have been published
to date. The aim of this review was to estimate the effect of
textmessagingonmedicationadherenceinadultswithchronic
medical disorders. Secondary aims were to describe and ex-
amine the effect of characteristics of text message interven-
tions,includingfrequencyofmessaging,interactivity,andcus-
tomization, and to describe perceptions and acceptability to
participants.
Methods
ThisreviewwaswrittenanddetailedinaccordwiththePreferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
statement and the Cochrane Collaboration reporting items for
systematic reviews and meta-analyses.19
Literature Search
A computerized literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE,
CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, and trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov and ANZCTR [http:
//www.anzctr.org.au/]) was conducted using Medical Subject
Headings and keywords. The keywords included (1) inter-
vention (text messaging, text messages, short message service,
mobile phone, and cellular phone) and (2) medication use
(adherence, nonadherence, compliance, noncompliance, refuse,
refusal, treatment refusal, and patient compliance). No restric-
tion on publication date was applied. The electronic database
was last searched on January 15, 2015.
Study Eligibility
We included trials based on the following criteria: (1) the trial
studied adult patients (≥18 years) with chronic disease, (2) the
patientsreceivedamobiletelephonetextmessageintervention
designed to promote medication adherence, (3) the design was
a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with at least 4 weeks’follow-
up, and (4) the trial reported quantitative measures of the ef-
fect of text messaging on medication adherence. We excluded
studiesbasedonthefollowingcriteria:(1)theprimaryinterven-
tion under consideration was not limited to text messages, (2)
the focus was solely disease management or education and did
notreportmedicationadherenceorreportedonlysurrogateout-
comes (eg, CD4 cell count or glycated hemoglobin level), and
(3) the study involved psychiatric, military, or institutionalized
patients. The latter criterion was to avoid the potential influ-
ence of psychosocial or institutional controls on adherence.
Data Extraction
Two of us (J.T. and R.K.) independently screened all identified
titlesandabstractsfromtheliteraturesearchusingapredefined
protocol.Wereviewedreferencelistsofrelevantarticlesforad-
ditional publications. Full texts of screened articles were re-
viewed for inclusion criteria and study quality. Disagreements

independent reviewer (C.K.C.). If more than 1 publication of an
originaltrialwasidentified,sucharticleswereassessedtogether
to maximize data collection. We extracted data on study char-
acteristics, text message characteristics, and outcomes.
We used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions20 guidelines for trials with multiple interven-
tion arms. When reported, we used the overall intervention ef-
fect. Otherwise, we combined trial arms (ie, text message vs
non–textmessagearms).Wedidnotfollowthealternativestrat-

ditional arms and treated this group as a non–text message in-
tervention arm. For trials reporting multiple follow-ups, the
final follow-up corresponding to the study duration was used.
Assessment of Study Quality
Twoofus(J.T.andR.K.)independentlyassessedtheriskofbias
of included studies, with any disagreements resolved by dis-
cussion and a third opinion (C.K.C.) to reach consensus. We as-
sessedthemethodologicalriskofbiasofincludedstudiesinac-
cord with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions,19 which recommends reporting of the following
individualelementsforRCTs:randomsequencegeneration,ran-
domization sequence concealment, masking, completeness of
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources
of bias. Each item is judged as being at high, low, or unclear risk
of bias. Studies were deemed to be at highest risk of bias if they
were scored as being at high or unclear risk of bias for the se-
quence generation or randomization concealment domains.
Statistical Analysis
Weusedasoftwareprogram(ComprehensiveMeta-analysis,ver-
sion2.2.064;Biostat)forstatisticalanalyses.22Weusedthemean

fect size. Cohen d values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are generally con-

Tweedie26 to impute the missing studies. We performed sub-
groupanalysisbasedonstudyandtextmessagecharacteristics.
There are no clear guidelines or criterion standard recom-
mendations on how to assess medication adherence or de-
fine adherence outcomes.27,28 Our primary analysis was to ex-
amine the effects of text message interventions on medication
adherence. We defined adherent patients as those individu-
als determined to be adherent as defined by the individual in-
cluded trials. For trials that reported multiple measures of ad-
herence, we selected the most objective measure of adherence
according to a predefined hierarchy (ie, electronic monitor-
ing over pill count over self-recall, as well as a continuous scale
over a dichotomized scale.18
Results
Study Characteristics
We assessed 44 full-text articles for eligibility and identified
16 RCTs21,29-43 (Figure 1, Table 1, and eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment) involving 2742 patients that met our inclusion criteria.
The median sample size was 97 (range, 21-538). The median
age of participants was 39 years (age range, 31-64 years), and
50.3% (1380 of 2742) were female. The studies evaluated vari-
ous chronic diseases, including human immunodeficiency vi-
rus (HIV) infection,29,30,32,34,35,37 cardiovascular disease
(CVD),31,36,38,41,43 asthma,21,39 allergic rhinitis,42 diabetes
mellitus,40 and epilepsy.33 The median intervention duration
was 12 weeks (range, 4-48 weeks).
Self-recall was the most commonly used method to as-
sess adherence,21,31-34,36,38,41,42 followed by medication event
monitoring system29,30,36,37 and pill count.29,30,43 Adherence
outcome data were reported in 12 studies21,29,31-35,37,38,41-43 as
proportion of patients adherent and in 4 studies30,36,39,40 as
proportion of medication doses taken as prescribed. The ad-
herence cutoff was defined at 95% in 6 HIV trials and 1 CVD
trial, at 90% in 1 HIV trial, at 80% in 1 CVD trial, and at 80% in
one hypertension trial. The control arm in 15 studies was stan-
dard therapy. Only 1 study30 compared the text message in-
tervention with a control arm (using additional 1-way pager or
beeper).
Text Message Characteristics
There was considerable variation in the text message inter-
vention characteristics (Table 2). Fifteen studies sent text mes-
sages at a fixed predetermined frequency. One study40 used
real-time medication monitoring in which patients were sent
a text message reminder only if the participant failed to open
the medication dispenser. Five studies30,31,36,38,41 incorpo-
ratedpersonalizationintotheirmessages.Forexample,thetrial
by Khonsari et al31 used the following personalization: [Mr or
Ms] [patient name], please take [medicine quantity] tablet of
[medication name] at [time]. Eight studies used a 2-way com-
municationstrategy,whichwasmandatoryin4studies30,32,36,41
and encouraged in 4 studies.21,33-35 The message content was
predominantly medication reminders31,33-43 but also in-
cluded medical educational information21,33,35-37,43 or non-
medical general topics29,30,32 (eg, jokes, Bible verses, humor,

etc). With respect to frequency; the most common pattern
was a daily text message in 8 studies,21,30,31,36-39,42 followed
by a weekly text message in 3 studies.32,35,37 Only 1 study41
used a variable frequency pattern, with daily send for 2
weeks, followed by alternate days for 2 weeks, and then
weekly for the remainder of the study duration. Four
studies31,36,40,41 matched message send times with the time
of patients’medication doses. The sending of messages was
managed by automation or computer programs in 10
studies.29-33,36,38,40,41,43
Meta-analysis of the Intervention Efficacy
In the pooled analysis of 2742 patients, text message in-
terventions significantly improved medication adherence
(OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.52-2.93; P < .001) (Figure 2). The
weighted mean effect size (Cohen d) was 0.41 (95%
CI, 0.23-0.59). Text message interventions were similarly
effective when analyses were restricted to text message
studies31,32,34,35,37,40-42 reporting outcomes by intent to treat
(OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.51-3.37; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.45) (eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement) or by per-protocol analysis (OR,
1.65; 95% CI, 1.07-2.53; P = .02; Cohen d, 0.28) (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement). We did not find significant effects of text
messages on adherence in subgroup analysis based on text
message characteristics and study variables (Table 3). There
was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 62%) across clinical trials.
Publication bias was detected by funnel plot asymmetry
(eFigure 3 in the Supplement) and Egger regression coeffi-
cient (1-tailed P = .02). Using trim-and-fill imputation for
missing studies, the point estimate was reduced but
remained positive, with an OR of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.18-2.39;
P < .05).

Risk of Bias and Sensitivity Analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis based on the quality of
studies. Fourteen studies described a randomization se-
quence generation technique that was at low risk of bias. Ten
studies used a low-risk method for randomization conceal-

Discussion
We identified 16 RCTs that investigated the effect of text mes-
saging on medication adherence in patients with chronic dis-
ease.Wefoundthattextmessageinterventionsincreasedmedi-
cation adherence, with an approximate doubling of the odds
of patients’achieving adherence to their medication regi-
mens. This increase translates into adherence rates improv-
ing from 50% (assuming this percentage as the baseline rate
in patients with chronic disease from the literature in devel-
oping countries3,7) to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of
17.8%. Given the simplicity of the intervention and potential
scalability, this finding suggests that text message–based in-
terventions could have substantial potential to improve medi-
cation adherence in patients with chronic disease. Our find-
ings are consistent with previous observations that text
messaging can be a useful tool for behavioral change in dis-
ease prevention44 and monitoring and management.45,46 Our
analyses indicated the presence of publication bias. How-
ever, even after taking this bias into account, the effect esti-
mate was still significantly positive. There was also substan-
tial heterogeneity noted, which is likely because of several
reasons, including clinical heterogeneity (true variation of
effect arising from variation in the characteristics of the text
message interventions and variation in the patient popula-
tions).Nevertheless,thereisalsolikelymethodologicalhetero-
geneity, most likely arising because of variability in the ways
outcomes were defined and measured in each study.
Improving medication adherence is a challenge. Various
interventions targeting medication adherence have been re-
ported, including patient education and counseling, allied
health support (pharmacist-based or nurse-led interven-
tions), use of reminders (beepers, pagers, smartphone apps,
and automated telephone calls), packaged medications, and
frequentclinicvisits.1Successfulstrategiesusuallyinvolvemul-
timodal combinations. However, implementing such com-
plex combination methods is resource intensive and may not

be feasible in routine clinical practice.2 A systematic review
by Kripalani et al47 reported adherence outcomes of interven-
tions broadly categorized as informational, behavioral, and
combined interventions. Most effective informational inter-
ventions showed small to medium effect sizes (Cohen d range,
0.35-0.68) only when intensive counseling was offered over
multiple sessions. Even behavioral interventions showed
mixed success. Other techniques, such as specialized packag-
ing, direct observed therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy,
didnotsignificantlyaffectadherenceorclinicaloutcomes.The
review by Haynes et al8 concluded that interventions effec-
tive for long-term care are complex and require a combina-
tion of multiple approaches. Our meta-analysis showed a
comparable effect size (Cohen d, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.59) of
a mobile telephone text message intervention in enhancing
adherence. The distinct advantages of text messaging over
other interventions are simplicity and ease of administra-
tion, often in an automated fashion using a computerized
program.
Another area of interest is the effect of text message char-
acteristics. The characteristics of interventions in this meta-
analysis varied substantially. While certain characteristics of
text message–based programs such as increased message fre-
quency and 2-way communication have been suggested to im-
prove outcomes, we found no significant heterogeneity of ef-
fects across subgroups within this review. However, the results
of a comparative analysis between these subgroups should be
interpreted with caution and regarded as inconclusive be-
cause of sparse data available for analysis. However, some
aspects are noteworthy. Interventions that delivered person-
alized messages showed a moderate effect size (Cohen d, 0.63;
95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P < .01), which suggests that sending a text
message with one’
s preferred name may increase acceptance
and participant engagement. There was no significant differ-
encebetweendailytextmessages(Cohend,0.48;95%CI,0.17-
0.79) compared with less frequent messaging (Cohen d, 0.35;
95%CI,0.13-0.57),whichiscontrarytoconcernsraisedinother
studies37,48 that daily reminders may lead to habituation and
response fatigue. However, one possible explanation is that re-
sponse fatigue may be a feature of longer-duration interven-
tions, while the median length of studies in this review was 3
months.
Overall, the text message intervention had high accep-
tance rates. The patients in our meta-analysis were middle-
aged (age range, 31-64 years), and 50.3% (1380 of 2742) were
female. Most studies did not report the educational or socio-
economic status of the participants. Hence, there were insuf-
ficient data to determine whether these individual character-
istics may be associated with variation in response.
While there has been mounting evidence largely in favor
of texting interventions, many questions remain unan-
swered. There is a need for future high-quality studies to ad-
dress more comprehensively what features of programs make
them more effective. For example, is there greater benefit with
more text message sophistication such as fixed-frequency or
real-time medication monitoring, matched short message ser-
vice with medication times, varied message content, person-
alization, and 2-way communication? Also, do text message–
based interventions work better in some groups of patients
comparedwithothers?Forexample,dotheyvarybasedonpar-
ticipant characteristics such as nonadherence, cultural back-
ground, type of disease, educational level, and socioeco-
nomic class? This information will help inform how best to
formulate text message–based interventions for different pa-
tient cohorts.
One unique feature of text message interventions is the
ability to offer confidential and unobtrusive support, which is
an advantage of text messaging over other electronic remind-
ers such as pagers or beepers. In the study by Hardy et al,30
one-third of the control subjects objected to the use of beep-
ers, which provoked curiosity from people around them and
violated confidentiality. This concern was not reported in as-
sociation with the text message intervention arm in any study,
perhaps because of widespread use and recognition of con-
ventional text message alert tones, which are less likely to
arouse curiosity among peers. There is still a potential for
problems in the case of unattended mobile telephones with-
out password lock or smartphones with a message preview
function, but these concerns can be managed with appropri-
ate participant training.
There are several limitations of our meta-analysis. First,
this study is subject to publication bias, although the effect of
publication bias is likely small based on the fail-safe N test by
Orwin.49 This test provides an estimate of the number of miss-
ing studies. At a generally acceptable threshold of 0.1 for the
effect size, this value was 34, which means that we would need
to locate an additional 34 studies with a mean standard dif-
ference in means of 0 to bring the combined standard differ-
ence in means to below 0.1. Second, the adherence levels that
defined patients as adherent varied among the studies. For ex-
ample, these thresholds in HIV studies were 90% in the study
by Pop-Eleches et al37 vs 95% in the study by Lester et al;32 and
in CVD studies they were 80% in the study by Wald et al41 vs
95% in the study by Quilici et al38. If the threshold is lowered,
it can overestimate the effect of text messaging on adherence
and vice versa. Third, many studies used self-reporting to de-
termine the outcomes, which carries the possibility of recall
bias and social desirability bias. Self-recall is commonly used
to measure adherence owing to the convenience, the lack of a
criterion standard, and the challenges of recording behaviors
objectively. However, it tends to overestimate adherence, and
there is no consensus on optimal recall periods (3 days, 7 days,
or 1 month).50 Social desirability bias may also be an impor-
tant consideration in the studies included given their cul-
tural diversity. Fourth, the RCTs identified in our meta-
analysis had short intervention duration and follow-up
(median, 12 weeks), and none of the studies reported data on
adherence behavior beyond the end of the trial or completion
of the intervention. The short duration of the trials suggests
uncertainty about the duration of the effect, the time-effect
relationship, and the continuation or decay of the effect after
the intervention is withdrawn. While our meta-analysis iden-
tified a positive effect of text messaging on medication adher-
enceintheshortterm,itisuncertainifthisinfluencewilltrans-
late into longer-term effects on adherence behavior or on
clinical outcomes.

Conclusions
We found that mobile telephone text messaging increased
adherence to taking medications among middle-aged
patients with chronic disease. The ease of use, instanta-
neous relay of information, and boundless reach make it an
attractive tool for public health. While our analyses indicate
some heterogeneity across clinical trials, this finding is
likely because of variation in the characteristics of the inter-
ventions studied and in the definitions of outcomes among
the studies. These results should be interpreted with cau-
tion given that most trials were of short duration and that
most used self-reported outcome measures. Hence, uncer-
tainty remains about the effect size of text messages over
longer periods and on objective measures of outcome.
Future research on the benefit of different features of text
message interventions, the longevity of the effect, and the
influence on objective clinical measures of outcomes are
needed to help better identify the role of text message inter-
ventions to improve medication adherence in chronic dis-
ease care.
