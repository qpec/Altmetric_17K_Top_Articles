he Canadian Heart Health Strategy and Action Plan and 
similar cardiovascular health promotion efforts in other 
countries have been introduced to reduce the incidence 
of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1–3 However, major geographic 
disparities persist in cardiovascular hospital admission and mor-
tality rates.4,5 Previous studies have shown that variations in the 
prevalence of traditional cardiac risk factors account only par-
tially for this variation, which suggests that other factors also play 
a role.4 A potentially important contributing factor is the health 
care system. Clinical practice guidelines recommend best prac-
tices for the detection and management of traditional CVD risk 
factors, but rates of adherence to these guidelines may vary.6 In 
Canada, despite a universal health care system, geographic varia-
tion in the supply of physician services is a policy concern and 
may contribute to regional disparities in health care outcomes.7–10

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Variations in the preva-
lence of traditional cardiac risk factors 
only partially account for geographic 
variations in the incidence of cardiovas-
cular disease. We examined the extent to 
which preventive ambulatory health 
care services contribute to geographic 
variations in cardiovascular event rates.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study 
involving 5.5 million patients aged 40 to 
79 years in Ontario, Canada, with no hos-
pital stays for cardiovascular disease as of 
January 2008, through linkage of multiple 
population-based health databases. The 
primary outcome was the occurrence of 
a major cardiovascular event (myocar-
dial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular-
related death) over the following 5 years. 
We compared patient demographics, car-
diac risk factors and ambulatory health 
care services across the province’s 14 
health service regions, known as Local 
Health Integration Networks (LHINs), and 
evaluated the contribution of these vari-
ables to regional variations in cardiovas-
cular event rates.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular event rates 
across LHINs varied from 3.2 to 5.7 events 
per 1000 person-years. Compared with 
residents of high-rate LHINs, those of low-
rate health regions received physician ser-
vices more often (e.g., 4.2 v. 3.5 mean 
 
annual family physician visits, p value 
for LHIN-level trend = 0.01) and were 
screened for risk factors more often. Low-
rate LHINs were also more likely to 
achieve treatment targets for hypercholes-
terolemia (51.8% v. 49.6% of patients, p = 
0.03) and controlled hypertension (67.4% 
v. 53.3%, p = 0.04). Differences in patient 
and health system factors accounted for 
74.5% of the variation in events between 
LHINs, of which 15.5% was attributable to 
health system factors alone.
INTERPRETATION: Preventive ambulatory 
health care services were provided more 
frequently in health regions with lower 
cardiovascular event rates. Health system 
interventions to improve equitable access 
to preventive care might improve cardio-
vascular outcomes.

be used to study the delivery and outcomes of clinical CVD care 
in the entire population over time.11,12 
In this CANHEART Regional Variations cohort study, we sought 
to identify patient and health system factors associated with 
regional variations in the incidence of major cardiovascular 
events. In particular, we studied the delivery of preventive health 
care services provided by family physicians. A better understand-
ing of key contributing factors could lead to more targeted and 
effective interventions to address disparities in CVD event rates.
Methods
Data sources
As part of the CANHEART initiative, we created a population-based 
cohort of 5.5 million community-dwelling adults aged 40–79 years 
as of Jan. 1, 2008, who had resided in Ontario for at least the 2 pre-
vious years. We identified them through record linkage of 17 popu-
lation-based health databases using unique, encoded identifiers, as 
described in detail elsewhere.11 Our cohort was restricted to pri-
mary prevention patients, defined as those with no history of a hos-
pital stay for cardiovascular disease in the previous 20 years. 
We obtained baseline demographic and risk factor informa-
tion from the Ontario Registered Persons Database, the Ontario 
Hypertension Database, the Ontario Diabetes Database and 
other data sources (Appendix 1, Supplement 1, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160823/-/DC1).13,14 
Information on health behaviours, ethnicity, laboratory test 
results and blood pressure measurements were obtained from 
representative samples of the Ontario population linked to the 
Can 
adian Community Health Survey; the Immigration, Refugees 
and Citizenship Canada Permanent Resident Database; the 
Dynacare Medical Laboratories database; and the Electronic 
Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD), 
respectively (Appendix 1, Supplements 1 and 2). Information 
about phys 
ician services, medication use (for patients aged 
≥ 65 yr) and clinical events was obtained from population-based 
physician billing, drug benefits, hospital discharge and vital sta-
tistics records.
Cardiovascular health and health system indicators
A set of key primary prevention (e.g., cardiovascular health and 
health system) indicators were identified by a CANHEART expert 
panel (Appendix 1, Supplement 3). Depending on the context, the 
indicators were measured either before Jan. 1, 2008, or from 
Jan. 1, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2012, across Ontario’s 14 health service 
regions, known as Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). 
Where possible, we modelled our indicator definitions to be con-
sistent with the Canadian Cardiovascular Harmonized National 
Guidelines Endeavour (C-CHANGE) clinical practice guidelines.6
Primary outcome
Our primary outcome was the occurrence of a major CVD event 
during the 5-year follow-up period (2008–2012). A major CVD 
event was defined as hospital admission due to myocardial 
 
infarction or stroke, or cardiovascular-related death (from ische-
mic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics, including means and proportions, were cal-
culated for baseline demographic characteristics and each indi-
cator by LHIN. Incidence rates of the primary outcome were 
reported as events per 1000 person-years of follow-up. Perfor-
mance on all indicators and outcomes were age- and sex-
standardized to the 2006 Ontario census population. To examine 
for linear trends between each indicator and the incidence of 
CVD at the LHIN level, we calculated Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients and their associated p values for each indicator. 
To simplify the presentation of descriptive results, we com-
bined the 14 LHINs into 3 groups: those with low event rates 
(3 LHINs), medium event rates (7) and high event rates (4) based 
on their population’s CVD risk from an age- and sex-adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards model that incorporated LHIN-specific ran-
dom effects (described below). We considered LHINs whose 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for their random effect lay entirely below 
(or above) 1.0 as low-rate (or high-rate) regions; remaining LHINs 
were deemed medium-rate regions. Because the relative ranking 
of LHINs by CVD event rate was similar among men and women 
(Appendix 1, Supplement 4), our analyses focused on combined 
results for men and women.
To determine the incremental impact of patient and health 
system factors on the occurrence of a CVD event, we fit a 
sequence of multivariable multilevel Cox proportional hazards 
models in which the effects of LHINs were assumed to follow a 
normal distribution and modelled as random effects (or frailty 
terms), and patient-level covariates modelled as fixed effects.15 
To quantify the heterogeneity in CVD event rates between LHINs, 
we calculated the median hazard ratio (HR) from the variance of 
the LHIN-specific random effects.16,17 The median HR quantifies 
the median difference in CVD risk for an identical patient in all 14 
LHINs when all possible comparisons of higher- versus lower-risk 
LHINs are made, as opposed to comparing individual LHINs 
against a single reference LHIN, as in conventional statistical 
methods.16
We sequentially adjusted for (a) age and sex, (b) patient fac-
tors, including traditional cardiac risk factors, neighbourhood 
income and ethnicity, and (c) health system factors, including 
lipid screening, family physician visits and periodic health exami-
nation rates, and determined the amount of variation explained 
by each model.18,19 We determined the proportion of variation 
explained by each step of adjustment by computing the percent 
change in the variance of the LHIN-specific random effects from 
an unadjusted model. We used similar models to examine the 
likelihood of receiving selected preventive health services after 
adjusting for cardiovascular risk. We used multiple imputation 
methods for missing data in the models (Appendix 1, Supple-
ment 5).20 
All data were analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative 
Sciences, Toronto, with the use of SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc.).

Results
Baseline characteristics of the study population by CVD event 
rate group are shown in Table 1, and by LHIN in Appendix 1, Sup-
plement 6. Mean age was 54.6 ± 10.4 years, and 52.0% were 
women. Residents of low-rate LHINs were more likely than those 
in medium- and high-rate LHINs to be a member of an ethnic 
minority group, recent immigrant, have completed high school 
and to reside in an urban area.
Cardiac risk factors
The prevalence of traditional cardiac risk factors is reported in 
Table 1 and Appendix 1, Supplement 6. Compared with low-rate 
regions, residents of high-rate regions were more likely to smoke, 
be obese, have a higher mean systolic blood pressure, and have 
suboptimal daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (all 
p < 0.01). In contrast, baseline prevalence of diabetes and mean 
total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were 
similar across LHINs.

Health system factors
Performance on cardiovascular health system indicators is shown 
in Table 2 by event rate group, and by LHIN in Figure 1 and Appen-
dix 1, Supplement 7. In all LHINs, almost 90% of individuals visited 
a family physician in 2006–2007. Individuals living in low-rate LHINs 
had a higher mean annual number of visits (4.2 v. 3.6 and 3.5 in the 
medium- and high-rate LHINs, respectively; R = −0.65, p = 0.01 for 
LHIN-level trend). Similar trends were observed for visits to a spe-
cialist (R = −0.74, p = 0.003), the proportion of residents who 
received at least 1 periodic health examination between 2005 and 
2007 (R = −0.93, p < 0.001), and dyslipidemia and diabetes screening 
rates (both R = −0.89, p < 0.001). Multivariable risk-adjusted models 
predicting annual visits to a family physician, dyslipidemia screen-
ing and having a periodic health exam showed similar gradients by 
CVD event rate (Appendix 1, Supplement 8).
Related to risk factor management, patients with hypertension 
living in low-rate LHINs made more annual visits to a family physician 
for hypertension during the follow-up period (R = −0.70, p = 0.005) 
and had higher rates of blood pressure control (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) 
than those living in medium- and high-rate regions (R = −0.59, 
p = 0.04). Overall, 31.7% of Ontarians 65 years of age or older were 
receiving statins, with similar rates across LHINs. Statin use was 
higher among those with diabetes living in low-rate LHINs than in 
other health regions (R = −0.71, p = 0.004). The mean proportion of 
statin users achieving treatment targets was also higher in low-rate 
LHINs than in high-rate regions (R = −0.57, p = 0.03), whereas mean 
rates of glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin ≤ 7%) among individ-
uals with diabetes were similar (p = 0.7).
Cardiovascular events
Overall, 103 280 CVD events were identified over 27 million years of 
patient follow-up between 2008 and 2012 (mean duration of follow-
up 4.9 ± standard deviation 0.6 yr). The age- and sex-standardized 
incidence rate of major CVD events varied nearly twofold, from a 
low of 3.2 events per 1000 person-years in the Central LHIN to a 
high of 5.7 events per 1000 person-years in the North West and 
North East LHINs (Figure 2; Appendix 1, Supplements 4 and 9). The

Toronto Central) were urban communities of the Greater Toronto 
Area. The 2 regions with the highest incidence were in northern 
Ontario, the least densely populated area of Ontario.
Multilevel models
Table 3 shows the results from sequential multilevel modelling 
adjusted for demographic characteristics, risk factors and health 
system factors. Hazard ratios by LHIN are shown in Appendix 1, 
Supplement 10. Adjustment for differences in age, sex and tradi-
tional cardiac risk factors explained 33.2% of the variation in CVD 
incidence between health regions. Additional adjustment for 
socioeconomic status and ethnic composition accounted for a fur-
ther 25.8% of the variation, and adjustment for health system fac-
tors accounted for an additional 15.5%. The median HR between 
LHINs also decreased proportionately, from an unadjusted median 
HR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.10–1.31) to 1.11 (1.05–1.15) in the fully 
adjusted model, which indicated a median relative difference of 
11% in the hazard of events when comparing a higher-rate LHIN 
with a lower-rate LHIN after adjustment for all of these factors.

health system indicators determined in this study is available at

Interpretation
The CANHEART initiative was designed to facilitate the study of car-
diovascular health and delivery of ambulatory preventive health care 
to the adult population in all regions of Ontario, Canada. We found 
an inverse association between LHIN-level CVD event rates and 
health system factors, such as number of ambulatory care visits to 
family physicians, and rates of dyslipidemia and diabetes screening, 
controlled blood pressure among patients with hypertension and 
statin use among people with diabetes. Residents of high-rate re-
gions were the least likely to  
receive certain preventive services, even 
though they had the highest rates of smoking and obesity and the 
lowest rates of  
dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Cumulatively, 
74.5% of the regional variation could be explained, of which 15.5% 
was due to health system factors.

Our study suggests that, even in a country with a universal health 
insurance system, higher rates of preventive health care contribute 
to lower rates of CVD events at a regional level.21 Our findings pro-
vide new information that health system factors may be important 
contributors to regional variations in CVD event rates. Although their 
medical needs were greater, residents of LHINs with the highest CVD 
event rates had the fewest family physician visits per year. The lower 
numbers of visits may reflect differences in health-seeking behav-
iour between residents of different LHINs, but they may also reflect 
differences in access to care. Ontario has had long-standing chal-
lenges in recruiting and retaining primary care physicians to north-
ern and more rural parts of the province, where wait times for 
urgent primary care visits are the longest and physician shortages 
the greatest.9 More frequent visits provide family physicians more 
opportunities to deliver preventive care such as early screening for 
risk factors, encouraging lifestyle changes (e.g., diet and exercise), 
and titrating medical therapy (e.g., statins) to treatment targets if 
lifestyle interventions are ineffective.22,23 Periodic health examina-
tions, which typically focus on preventive care, were conducted 
most frequently in the regions with low CVD event rates. Although 
lower numbers of family physician visits may be explained in part by 
greater numbers of visits with nurses and nurse practitioners in 
high-rate LHINs, we did not have data to examine this possibility.
Our analyses also suggest that differences in the ethnic composi-
tion of residents of LHINs contributed to regional variations in CVD 
incidence. Ontario is one of the world’s most ethnically diverse juris-
dictions. A relatively high proportion of individuals in ethnic minority 
groups and recent immigrants live in health regions with the lowest 
CVD event rates, specifically LHINs in the Greater Toronto Area. Previ-
ous analyses of the CANHEART database have shown a “healthy 
immigrant” effect, with CVD event rates that were 30% lower among 
recent immigrants than among long-term residents of Ontario.24 East 
Asian immigrants (predominantly ethnic Chinese) were at lowest 
risk, and South Asian immigrants at highest risk, albeit with rates 
similar to long-term residents. In the current study, the lowest CVD 
rates were observed in the LHIN with the highest relative proportion 
of Chinese residents, whereas the 2 LHINs with the highest event 
rates had the lowest proportion of recent immigrants.
Our results are consistent with those reported in other studies, 
which have shown that variations in the prevalence of traditional risk 
factors explain part but not all of the geographic variation in CVD inci-
dence.25–30 In the British Regional Heart Study, traditional risk factors 
explained as much as 50% of differences in CVD risk among 7335 
men living in 24 towns, with smoking being the most important fac-
tor.29 An ecologic study in China found that variation in hypertension 
prevalence across provinces was the most important factor contrib-
uting to geographic variation in stroke mortality.26 The British Wom-
en’s Heart and Health Study found that, in addition to traditional risk 
factors, variations in statin use contributed to regional variation in 
CVD incidence among 7173 women living in 23 towns.27
Limitations
Our study has some important limitations. Although we studied 
several key health indicators and system factors, we did not have 
complete information on all indicators for the entire study popula-
tion (e.g., medication use by those less than 65 years old and blood

pressure control among people with hypertension) or some health 
system factors (e.g., nurse practitioner visits, hospital-based labo-
ratory tests and privately funded health care services) to enable 
their inclusion in our multilevel models. However, we reported the 
LHIN-level performance on these indicators from analyses con-
ducted on subsamples of the study population where possible, 
which have been shown to be representative of the entire popula-
tion.11 We also examined individual exposure to health system fac-
tors over only a few years, whereas cumulative lifetime exposure to 
preventive health care may be more important.
Conclusion
The CANHEART Regional Variations cohort study showed that 
regional variations in CVD-related health behaviours, ethnic com-
position and ambulatory preventive care were associated with 
regional variations in the incidence of CVD events in Ontario. Res-
idents of regions with the greatest burden of cardiac disease 
were paradoxically less likely to receive certain preventive health 
services. In a system designed to facilitate equitable access to 
health care, interventions to improve rates of preventive care in 
high-rate regions might improve cardiovascular outcomes.
