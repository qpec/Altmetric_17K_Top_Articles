Aims
It is unclear whether the potential benefits of physical activity differ according to level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)
or strength. The aim of this study was to determine whether the association between physical activity and mortality is
moderated by CRF and grip strength sufficiently to inform health promotion strategies.
Methods
and results
498 135 participants (54.7% women) from the UK Biobank were included (CRF data available in 67 702 participants).
Exposure variables were grip strength, CRF, and physical activity. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
events were the outcomes. 8591 died over median 4.9 years [IQR 4.3–5.5] follow-up. There was a significant inter-
action between total physical activity and grip strength (P , 0.0001) whereby the higher hazard of mortality associated
with lower physical activity was greatest among participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (hazard ratio, HR:1.11
[95% CI 1.09–1.14]) and lowest among those in the highest grip strength tertile (HR:1.04 [1.01–1.08]). The interaction
with CRF did not reach statistical significance but the pattern was similar. The association between physical activity and
mortality was larger among those in the lowest tertile of CRF (HR:1.13 [1.02–1.26]) than those in the highest (HR:1.03
[0.91–1.16]). The pattern for CVD events was similar.
Conclusions
These data provide novel evidence that strength, and possibly CRF, moderate the association between physical activity
and mortality. The association between physical activity and mortality is strongest in those with the lowest strength
(which is easily measured), and the lowest CRF, suggesting that these sub-groups could benefit most from interventions
to increase physical activity.

Introduction
The independent, protective associations of physical activity, cardio-
respiratory fitness (CRF), and strength with mortality are well estab-
lished, with studies generally reporting stronger associations with
mortality for CRF and strength than for physical activity.1–3 Increas-
ing physical activity is a major mechanism by which CRF and strength
can be increased;4–6 thus the association between physical activity
and mortality is partially mediated by its effect on CRF and strength
and is partially independent of them.7 However, around half of the
variation in CRF and strength is inherited8,9 and it is unclear whether
the association between physical activity and mortality is moderated
by a person’s underlying level of CRF and strength. There are limited
data suggesting that low levels of physical activity are associated with

 increased hazard of mortality in men and women with low CRF, but
that the association between physical activity and mortality may be
weaker in those with high CRF. Data are completely lacking
on whether the association between physical activity and mortality
varies by strength.
Understanding the interactions between physical activity, CRF,
and strength has implications for health promotion strategies.
Currently, physical activity interventions are generally targeted at
everyone in the least active sub-group of the population.10 This is
based on the overall curvilinear relationship between level of phys-
ical activity and all-cause mortality which suggests that the incre-
mental benefit is greatest among those with the lowest baseline
level of physical activity.4,11 However, this approach assumes that
the association between physical activity and mortality is consistent,
irrespective of CRF and strength or other characteristics. If the
relationship between physical activity and mortality does differ ac-
cording to strength and CRF, information on grip strength—which
is easily measured—and CRF could help to define better the sub-
group of the population who could benefit most from physical
activity interventions. The purpose of this study was therefore to
determine whether the associations of physical activity with mortal-
ity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events were influenced by
CRF and grip strength among adults enrolled in UK Biobank, a
very large, prospective, population-based cohort study.
Methods
Study design
Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited 502
682 participants (5.5% response rate), aged 40–69 years from the gen-
eral population.12 Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centres
across England, Wales, and Scotland13 where they completed a
touch-screen questionnaire, had physical measurements taken and pro-
vided biological samples, as described in detail elsewhere.13,14 In this
prospective, population-based study, all-cause mortality, and incidence
of CVD were the outcomes; CRF, grip strength, and total physical activ-
ity were the exposure variables; and socio-demographic factors (age,
sex, ethnicity, area socioeconomic deprivation index), smoking status,
body mass index (BMI), diagnosis of diabetes, cancer, heart disease
(stroke, high blood pressure angina, and heart attack) and longstanding
illness were covariates. Our sample was restricted to the 498 135 par-
ticipants who had valid data on mortality status at follow-up and baseline
data for at least one of the following: grip strength, physical activity, and
CRF. Physical activity and grip strength data were available for 498 135
and 495 786 participants, respectively. 77 961 participants, recruited
from August 2009, underwent a CRF test and valid CRF data were ob-
tained in 67 702 participants.
Procedures
Date of death was obtained from death certificates held by the National
Health Service (NHS) Information Centre for participants from England
and Wales and the NHS Central Register Scotland for participants from
Scotland. Hospital admissions were identified via record linkage
to Health Episode Statistics records for England and Wales and to the
Scottish Morbidity Records for Scotland. Incident cardiovascular
vascular disease was defined as an ICD 10 code of I21, I21.4 and
I21.9, recorded on a death certificate or hospital admission (see Supple-
mentary material online for details). Grip strength was assessed using a
Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the mean of the right
hand and left hand values, expressed as kg, was used in the analysis.
Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a 6-min incremental
ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age,
height, weight, resting heart rate, and sex. Heart rate was monitored
pre-exercise, throughout activity and during recovery via a four-lead
ECG. The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolat-
ing the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero Watts) and the
heart rate and work rate at the end of the test, to the age-predicted
maximal heart rate (208–0.7 × age15 assuming a linear relationship.16
Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated
from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate
and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in mL kg21 min21) ¼ 7 + (10.8 ×
work rate (W))/body mass (kg))17 and then expressed in terms of max-
imal METs (where 1 MET ; 3.5 mL kg21 min21). Physical activity was
based on self-report, using the IPAQ short form,18 and total physical ac-
tivity was computed as the sum of walking, moderate and vigorous ac-
tivity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-h/week). Total time
spent in sedentary behaviours were derived from the sum of self-
reported time spent driving, using computer and watching television.
Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of resi-
dence, using the Townsend score.19 Age was calculated from dates of
birth and baseline assessment. Smoking status was categorized into
never, former, and current smoking. Medical history (physician diagnosis
of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, dia-
betes, or long-standing illness) was collected from the self-completed,
baseline assessment questionnaire. Alcohol intake frequency was col-
lected using a self-reported lifestyle questionnaire. Height and body
weight were measured by trained nurses during the initial assessment
centre visit. Body mass index was calculated as (weight/height2) and
the WHO criteria to classify BMI into: underweight ,18.5, normal
weight 18.5–24.9, overweight 25.0–29.9, and obese ≥30.0 kg m22.
Body composition (body fat and fat-free mass) was measured using
bio-impedance by trained nurses. Further details of these measure-
ments can be found in the UK Biobank online protocol (http://www.
ukbiobank.ac.uk) and our Supplementary material online.
Statistical analyses
The relationship between grip strength, CRF, and physical activity was
explored using Pearson correlation coefficients. The associations of
grip strength, CRF, and total physical activity with all-cause mortality
and CVD events were investigated using Cox-proportional hazard mod-
els. Two approaches were used. Firstly, separate associations of grip
strength, CRF, and physical activity with mortality/CVD events were cal-
culated. Grip strength, CRF, and physical activity were treated as con-
tinuous variables and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated per 1 SD
difference in fitness, grip strength, and total PA, using age- and sex-
specific z-scores. To enable comparability with other reports in the lit-
erature, HRs were also calculated for a 5 kg difference in grip strength,
1-MET difference in CRF, and 5-MET-h/week difference in total physical
activity. Secondly, joint associations between physical activity, CRF, and
mortality/CVD events and physical activity, grip strength, and mortality/
CVD events were calculated. Age- and sex-specific quintiles for phys-
ical activity and age- and sex-specific tertile for grip strength and CRF
were derived and HRs were calculated, with the referent category
comprising individuals who were in both the highest quintile of physical
activity and the strongest/fittest tertile. To investigate whether CRF
and/or grip strength moderated the association between physical activ-
ity and mortality/CVD events, we also tested the statistical significance
of interaction terms and conducted sub-group analyses where
appropriate.
For each of the approaches described above, we ran four incremental
models that included an increasing number of covariates: ‘model 0’ in-
cluded age, sex; ‘model 1’ included age, sex, ethnicity (white, black,

 South Asian, Chinese, and other), smoking status (current, former, and
never), BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and
obese), deprivation index and alcohol intake as covariates; ‘model 2’
also adjusted for depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension,
cancer, diabetes, or long-standing illness; and ‘model 3’ also adjusted for
total sedentary time per day, as well as total physical activity per day and
grip strength as appropriate. Finally, ‘model 4’ was equivalent to ‘model
2’ but participants with a history of cancer, stroke, angina, or myocardial
infarction at baseline were excluded from the analysis. Cardiorespira-
tory fitness was not included as a covariate in the models for physical
activity or grip strength because data on CRF were only available for
�14% (n ¼ 67 702) of the UK Biobank cohort. The proportional hazard
assumption was checked by tests based on Schoenfeld residuals.
All analyses were performed using STATA 14 statistical software
(StataCorp LP).
Ethical approval
The UK Biobank study was approved by the North West Multi-Centre
Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided written in-
formed consent to participate in the UK Biobank study. The study
protocol is available online (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
Results
8591 (1.7%) participants died over a median follow-up period of 4.9
years [IQR 4.3–5.5] and 2.1 years for CVD [IQR 1.4–2.8]. Over the
follow-up period, 8591 participants died and there were 3433 CVD
events, of which 2787 were fatal.
The main characteristics of the participants by quintiles of total
physical activity, tertile of CRF, and grip strength are summarized
in Supplementary material online, Tables S1–S3, respectively. The
correlation between grip strength and CRF was moderate (r ¼
0.415, P , 0.0001), but total physical activity only correlated weakly
with both CRF (r ¼ 0.111, P , 0.0001) and grip strength (r ¼ 0.088,
P , 0.0001). Excluding people with diabetes, cancer, longstanding
illness, and heart-related disease in a sensitivity analysis did not alter
these correlations (Supplementary material online, Table S4).
Table 1 shows the HRs for all-cause mortality for physical activity,
grip strength, and CRF. Higher levels of activity, strength, and CRF
were associated with lower mortality, with stronger associations
observed for grip strength and CRF than for physical activity. These
associations were slightly attenuated, but remained statistically

 Table S6 show the same data for CVD events. Here a significant in-
crease in CVD events with decreasing physical activity was only ob-
served in those in the lowest tertile for grip strength or CRF. There
was a statistically significant interaction between physical activity and
grip strength with CVD events.
When the sensitivity analyses were performed following exclu-
sion of all participants with a history of cancer, stroke, angina, or
heart attack from the analysis, the findings were not substantially al-
tered (Table 1; Supplementary material online, Table S5, model 4).
Similarly, when first year follow-up events were removed from
the analysis, the results were not altered.
Discussion
The main finding of this study is that the association of physical ac-
tivity with mortality and CVD events is moderated by grip strength
and possibly CRF. Grip strength and CRF were moderately corre-
lated with each other, but both had weak correlations with self-
reported physical activity: all three factors were associated with
mortality, independent of each other, and potential confounders.
The associations between grip strength (HR of 1.35 per SD differ-
ence) and CRF (HR 1.29) with mortality were of similar magnitude
and were both stronger than the association physical activity (HR
1.15) and mortality in the group overall. However, although physical
activity was inversely associated with all-cause mortality in all levels
of grip strength and those with low and middle CRF, the association
was strongest in those with the lowest strength, and possibly lowest
CRF, suggesting that these sub-groups would potentially benefit
most from interventions aimed at increasing physical activity. For
CVD events, significant increases in risk with decreasing physical ac-
tivity were only evident in those with the lowest strength or lowest
CRF. The evidence is stronger in relation to grip strength which
could be easily measured in clinical practice and, therefore, may
be a useful method of identifying a high risk group and targeting in-
terventions accordingly.
Our finding of inverse associations between of CRF,2 grip
strength,20 and total physical activity3 and all-cause mortality is in
agreement with previous studies. A meta-analysis conducted on
102 980 study participants reported that 1-MET lower CRF was as-
sociated with a 13% increased hazard of all-cause mortality.2 These
results are similar to our findings, where we show that 1-MET lower
CRF is associated with an HR of 1.11 for all-cause mortality. In our
study, adjusting for a history of disease and excluding participants
with pre-existing CVD-related diseases or prior cancer, attenuated
the HR for a 1-MET reduction in CRF by about a third to 1.08.
A similar association was observed for grip strength, where a 5-kg
lower grip strength was associated with an HR of 1.22 for all-cause
mortality. A comparable result was reported in a recent study con-
ducted on the 139 691 participants in the PURE study,20 where a
5 kg lower grip strength was associated with an HR of 1.16 for all-
cause mortality. As was observed for CRF, our HR for all-cause
mortality per 5-kg reduction in grip strength was attenuated by
about a third to 1.12 HR after adjusting the model for disease history
or by excluding participants with pre-existing CVD-related diseases
or cancer. Thus, low CRF and grip strength were both significantly
associated with higher mortality hazard, independent of pre-existing
disease, and our results appear to have good external validity.
Blair et al.1 reported an inverse additive association of physical ac-
tivity and CRF in relation to all-cause mortality among 35 519 parti-
cipants from the Aerobic Centre Longitudinal Study. Mortality was
highest among the unfit, inactive group, and lowest among the fit,
highly active group. However, when these analyses were adjusted
for confounders, the association disappeared,1 possibly due to insuf-
ficient statistical power. Our study has substantially greater statistic-
al power due to its much larger size. The trends demonstrated in
Figure 1 clearly illustrate that for those who have low CRF or grip
strength, there is a strong, dose-related relationship between phys-
ical activity and all-cause mortality whereas among those with high
CRF or grip strength, the association is much weaker. These findings

 are relevant for public health policies. These currently encourage in-
creased physical activity among all those who are physically inactive;
however, based on our results, tailoring physical activity interven-
tions at individuals who have low grip strength or low CRF it may
have a greater impact on reducing disease or mortality outcomes
for these individuals who have a ‘low fitness profile’ (i.e. physically
inactive plus low strength or low CRF). There is evidence from ran-
domised controlled trials that inactive individuals who undergo life-
style intervention, including increased physical activity, reduce their
risk of all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality.21 However, it is un-
known whether individuals who have a ‘low fitness profile’, could ac-
tually benefit even more by increasing their PA. Thus this needs to
be further investigated using appropriate intervention trials. Regard-
ing the applicability of CRF or grip strength on clinical settings; we
know that CRF is not easy to measure in routine clinical practice,
however, grip strength requires little training, is simple and cheap
to administer, and has high reproducibility.22 Therefore, it could eas-
ily be administered as a screening tool in routine clinical practice to
identify individuals for whom increasing physical activity would be
particularly beneficial.22
Hand-grip strength is highly correlated with leg strength, and thus
provides a valid index of overall limb muscle strength throughout
the age range.23 There is some evidence to suggest that resistance
training interventions—which improve strength—can increase in
glycolytic capacity and up-regulate insulin action and capacity for
glucose utilization in muscle.24 Randomized trials have also shown
that resistance exercise training can improve glucose regulation, li-
pid levels, and reduce adiposity and type 2 diabetes risk,25 all well-
known risk factors for mortality. Thus, the association between grip
strength and mortality is mechanistically plausible. Similarly, animal
model studies have demonstrated that selective breeding low car-
diorespiratory fitness leads to an adverse cardio-metabolic risk pro-
file26 and reduced life-expectancy27 in rats, implying a causal
relationship between CRF and mortality.
Strengths and limitations
The UK Biobank provided an opportunity to test our research ques-
tion in a very large, prospective cohort and the main outcome used
in this study was collected using NHS death records. Additionally,
strength and CRP were objectively assessed using validated meth-
ods, trained staff, and standard-operating procedures. Hand-grip
strength is highly correlated with leg strength and provides a valid
index of overall limb muscle strength throughout the age range.23
Although the response rate to UK Biobank was only 5.5%, the UK
Biobank cohort is representative of the general population with re-
spect to age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation within the age range re-
cruited, although it is not representative in other regards.12 While
this limits the ability to generalize prevalence rates, estimates of
the magnitude of associations regarding disease or mortality risk
in the current study will not be affected by this and will therefore
be generalizable.12,28 Reverse causality is possible in any observa-
tional study; however, when all participants with existing disease
were removed from the analysis the effect and direction of the as-
sociation remained significant. Although existing disease and co-
morbidities present before the UK Biobank measurement day
were self-reported, these self-reported records were based on dis-
ease that had been medically diagnosed. Data for atrial fibrillation
and heart failure were not explicitly reported as separate conditions
in the dataset at baseline, but these conditions are likely to have
been captured in the ‘long-standing illness’ variable that we adjusted
for in our models. Thus, any potential confounding effects of these
conditions would have been largely captured in our statistical adjust-
ments. Endpoint determination for CVD events was based only on
ICD-10 codes and was not subject to further scientific adjudication.
Physical activity was measured by self-report using a validated ques-
tionnaire. Thus misreporting of activity levels may have attenuated
the association between physical activity and mortality compared
with objective physical activity measurement.29 However, this is un-
likely to have substantially confounded the differential influence of
physical activity on mortality risk across the grip strength and CRF
groups, unless the extent misreporting of physical activity was sys-
tematically higher in the high CRF and high grip strength groups,
where the effects of physical activity on mortality were least strong.
Cardiorespiratory fitness data were only available in �14% of par-
ticipants, although this sub-group was representative of the wider
cohort (see Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2). How-
ever, the absence of a significant interaction between CRF and phys-
ical activity with mortality—despite similar trends to those for the
grip strength and physical activity with mortality—may reflect a
lack of statistical power to detect effect in this smaller sample. As
dietary intake data were only available for around half of the cohort
(n ¼ 211 066), we did not include this as covariate in our models.
Alcohol intake was available for the entire cohort and we did adjust
for this; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other that
dietary factors could have influence our findings.
In conclusion, insufficient physical activity is a preventable con-
tributor to the global burden of morbidity and mortality. However,
to maximize potential public health gains population-level interven-
tions to encourage physical activity in the whole population could be
complemented by specific interventions targeted at the sub-group
of the population who are at highest risk. Cardiorespiratory fitness
and strength are both predictors of all-cause mortality and CVD
events independent of physical activity. Our results suggest that
the ability of physical activity to reduce hazard of death or CVD
events may be greatest among those with low baseline strength
and fitness. Current guidelines advocate targeting physical activity
interventions merely on the basis of current levels of physical activ-
ity. Our findings suggest that targeting on the basis of strength, and
possibly fitness, could greatly improve our ability to identify those
individuals who could benefit most, thereby increasing the clinical
and cost effectiveness of physical activity interventions. These
conclusions require testing in the context of a future randomized
controlled trial.
