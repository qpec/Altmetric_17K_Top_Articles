Background-—Many adults eligible for statin therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention are untreated. Our objective was to
investigate patient-reported reasons for statin underutilization, including noninitiation, refusal, and discontinuation.
Methods and Results-—This study included the 5693 adults recommended for statin therapy in the PALM (Patient and Provider
Assessment of Lipid Management) registry. Patient surveys evaluated statin experience, reasons for declining or discontinuing
statins, and beliefs about statins and cardiovascular disease risk. Overall, 1511 of 5693 adults (26.5%) were not on treatment. Of
those not on a statin, 894 (59.2%) reported never being offered a statin, 153 (10.1%) declined a statin, and 464 (30.7%) had
discontinued therapy. Women (relative risk: 1.22), black adults (relative risk: 1.48), and those without insurance (relative risk: 1.38)
were most likely to report never being offered a statin. Fear of side effects and perceived side effects were the most common
reasons cited for declining or discontinuing a statin. Compared with statin users, those who declined or discontinued statins were
less likely to believe statins are safe (70.4% of current users vs. 36.9% of those who declined and 37.4% of those who discontinued)
or effective (86.3%, 67.4%, and 69.1%, respectively). Willingness to take a statin was high; 67.7% of those never offered and 59.7%
of patients who discontinued a statin would consider initiating or retrying a statin.
Conclusions-—More than half of patients eligible for statin therapy but not on treatment reported never being offered one by their
doctor. Concern about side effects was the leading reason for statin refusal or discontinuation. Many patients were willing to
reconsider statin therapy if offered. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2019;8:e011765. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.011765.)
Key Words: cardiovascular disease prevention • patient education/teaching • statin therapy
A
therosclerotic
cardiovascular
disease
(ASCVD)
remains the leading cause of mortality in the United
States, with nearly half of US adults projected to have
some form of ASCVD by 2030.1 HMG-CoA reductase
(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) inhibitors, or
statins, are among the most effective medications for
prevention of ASCVD.2 In 2013, the American College of
Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/
AHA)
released
guidelines
for
statin
use
for
ASCVD
prevention, broadening statin recommendations to >12
million newly eligible high-risk adults in the United States
for primary prevention.3
Unfortunately, a large gap in statin use remains between
guideline recommendations and actual clinical practice for
both primary and secondary prevention. Even among the
highest risk patients, those with established ASCVD, utiliza-
tion is low.4–6 We recently reported that up to a quarter of
those eligible for treatment were not on a statin in community
practice.7 Statin underutilization results from failure of
clinicians to identify and offer statins to eligible patients,

 patient refusal when offered, and discontinuation by some
patients who are tried on the medication.8 Delineating the
extent and causes of each of these aspects will help clinicians
design appropriate interventions to improve both primary and
secondary ASCVD prevention.
In this study, we analyzed data from the PALM (Patient and
Provider Assessment of Lipid Management) registry to
evaluate (1) patient-reported reasons for lack of statin
utilization, including lack of therapy being offered, patient
refusal, and discontinuation of prior treatment, and (2)
differences in beliefs regarding safety and efficacy of statin
therapy and perceived risk of ASCVD between current statin
users and those who were never offered, declined, or
discontinued treatment.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure.
Patient Population
The PALM registry was a cross-sectional registry in the United
States designed to evaluate lipid management practices and
patient and provider beliefs about cholesterol, statin therapy,
and heart disease. PALM enrolled 7938 patients from 140
cardiology, primary care, and endocrinology practices in the
United States who were potentially eligible for statin therapy,
including adults on statins, adults with risk factors for ASCVD,
and adults with prior ASCVD. Patient surveys evaluated
patient-reported current statin utilization and prior statin
experience as well as beliefs regarding statin efficacy and
safety, risk of ASCVD, and trust in the healthcare provider.9
Surveys were collected on an iPad using a digital question-
naire that patients completed at enrollment. Core lab lipid
panels were measured for all patients, and chart abstractions
were completed to assess clinical characteristics. Enrollment
was conducted between May 27, 2015, and November 12,
2015. All participants provided signed informed consent to
participate, and each site obtained institutional review board
approval for participation.
Among 7938 patients enrolled, 563 (7.1%) did not have
either baseline chart review data (n=34, 0.4%) or lipid values
(n=167, 2.1%) or did not complete a survey (n=347, 4.4%) and
were ineligible for this analysis. Among those with survey
data, we included 5693 participants who would have been
recommended for statin therapy according to the 2013 ACC/
AHA guideline10: (1) prior ASCVD (prior coronary artery
disease
or
coronary
revascularization,
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm, carotid artery stenosis, peripheral arterial disease
or peripheral revascularization, and prior stroke or transient
ischemic attack), (2) LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol) ≥190 mg/dL, (3) type 2 diabetes mellitus and age 40–
75 years, or (4) estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5% by the
pooled cohort equations and age 40 to 75 years.
At the time of enrollment, patients were asked whether
they were currently on a statin or had previously been on any
statin. Those never on a statin were asked whether they had
ever been recommended a statin by a healthcare provider.
Among those previously offered a statin and those who
discontinued therapy, reasons for declining or discontinuing
therapy were assessed. Patients were categorized into 4
groups: those currently on therapy, former statin users who
had discontinued therapy, those who had been offered
therapy by their doctor but declined, and those who reported
they had never been offered statin therapy. Beliefs about
statins and their own risk of heart disease were surveyed
using 5-point Likert scales and then categorized into binary
variables for analysis. See Data S1 for the survey questions
used in this analysis.
Analysis
Patient characteristics and beliefs were compared between
current users and those who were never offered treatment,
declined, or discontinued therapy. In descriptive analyses,
categorical variables were summarized using percentages and
compared using v2 tests, continuous variables were pre-
sented using median (interquartile range), and these were
compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Reasons for lack of
statin use were evaluated overall and stratified by indication.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• More than half of patients eligible for but not on statin
therapy report never being offered a statin by their doctor.
• Fear of side effects and perceived side effects are the most
common reasons for declining or discontinuing statin
therapy.
• Willingness to take a statin is high, among both patients
who have declined statin therapy and those who have never
been offered one.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• A significant opportunity exists to increase statin utilization
by improving physician recognition of eligible patients.
• Addressing patient perception of statin safety, especially
among patients who decline or discontinue statin therapy,
may improve statin utilization.
• Patients who previously discontinued their statin may be
receptive to retrying one if offered by their physician.

Reasons for Statin Underutilization

 To evaluate characteristics associated with never versus
ever being offered a statin, which included those who declined
or discontinued a statin, a multivariable model with Poisson
regression was used to display the relative risks of the
outcomes modeled.11 Clustering of patients within the same
hospital was accounted for using the generalized estimating
equation method.12 Variables considered and included in the
model were age, race (white, black, or other), sex, Hispanic
ethnicity, education (at least some college versus middle/high
school), household income (nominal categorical variable),
insurance (government, private, other, or none), type of site
specialty (cardiology, primary/family care/internal medicine,
endocrinology/other). The linearity of age in respect to the
outcome “never being offered a statin” was checked and fitted
as linear spline terms with 2 knots at 60 and 75, allowing
different slopes. Except for the income variable, the percentage
of missing for all variables above was <3%. The income value
was missing for �7.0% of patients, and 26.9% of patients
answered “I prefer not to answer this question.” We used
multiple imputation with 20 imputations to impute all missing
values of all variables. SAS procedure PROC MI was used for the
imputation process, and SAS PROC MIANALYZE was used to
combine the results of analysis carried out from 20 imputed
data sets. The results of how factors associate with outcome
were presented as relative risks with 95% CIs.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4
(SAS Institute).
Results
Of the 5693 adults in the PALM registry who met ACC/AHA
guidelines for statin therapy, 3184 (55.9%) had prior ASCVD
and 2509 (44.1%) had an ACC/AHA indication for primary
prevention statin use. The median ages of these primary and
secondary prevention populations were 66 and 70 years,
respectively; 51.9% and 36.3%, respectively, were female; and
17.7% and 10.1%, respectively, self-identified as black race.
Overall, 26.5% (n=1511) of adults recommended for
treatment were not on treatment, including 37.7% (n=945)
of those recommended for primary prevention and 17.8%
(n=566) of those recommended for secondary prevention. Of
the 1511 adults recommended for but not on statin therapy,
894 (59.2%) reported never having been offered a statin, 464
(30.7%) reported having previously taken a statin but discon-
tinuing therapy, and 153 (10.1%) had been offered statin
therapy but declined (Figure 1).
Patient Characteristics
Table 1 shows characteristics of patients recommended for
statins for either primary or secondary prevention stratified by
statin use: current users, discontinued, declined, and never
offered. Current statin users were more likely to be male
(60.6%) than those who discontinued (42.5%) or declined
(41.8%) statin therapy. Current statin users also had the
highest rate of any atherosclerotic disease (62.6%), followed
by those who discontinued statins (52.2%) and those who
declined a statin (37.9%). Education levels were similar
between current users and those who discontinued or
declined statins (63.6% versus 66.4% and 58.3%, respectively,
with at least some college; P=0.24 and P=0.18). There was no
statistically significant difference in income levels among
current users, those who discontinued, and those who
declined statins. However, those who declined statins were
more likely to have private insurance (67.3%) than current
statin users (57.3%, P=0.02) or former statin users (55.3%,
P=0.0002). There was no significant difference in use of
nonstatin lipid-lowering medications between current and

 former statin users (26.9% versus 28.6%, P=0.43), but those
who declined statins were more likely than current users to
use nonstatin therapy (35.8%, P=0.02). Total cholesterol and
LDL-C levels were highest in former statin users. Among the
primary prevention population, estimated 10-year ASCVD risk
was similar for those on a statin and those who discontinued,
declined, or reported never having been offered a statin
(14.4–14.5% 10-year ASCVD risk; Table 1).
Patients Never Offered Statin Therapy
Compared with current statin users, PALM participants who
were eligible for statin therapy but reported never being
offered a statin by their provider were more likely to be
female (51.1% vs 39.4%, P<0.001), of black race (20.9%
versus 12.1%), and of Hispanic ethnicity (14.0% versus
10.1%, P=0.0005) and less likely to have prior ASCVD (29.8%
versus 62.6%, P<0.001) and to see a cardiologist (28.4%
versus 50.3%, P<0.001), and had lower rates of private
insurance, college education, and lower household incomes
(Table 1).
In multivariable analyses, black race compared with white
race (relative risk: 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20–1.80; P=0.001), having
“other” or no insurance compared with private insurance
(relative risk: 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06–1.81; P=0.02), and female
sex (relative risk: 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06–1.41; P=0.006) were all
associated with increased likelihood of never being offered
statin therapy (Table S1).
Reasons for Lack of Statin Utilization
Reasons for lack of statin utilization varied by indication.
Among adults recommended for primary prevention but not
on a statin (n=945), lack of statin utilization was largely due to
participants reporting never being offered a statin (n=628,
66.5% of those not on a statin for primary prevention) rather
than participants reporting discontinuing (n=222, 23.5%) or
declining (n=95, 10.1%). In contrast, among those recom-
mended for statins for secondary prevention not on therapy
(n=566), similar numbers of adults reported discontinuing
treatment (n=242, 42.8% of those not on a statin for
secondary prevention) and never being offered therapy
(n=266, 47.0%), whereas 58 (10.2%) reported being offered
but declining therapy.
Among the 153 patients who declined statin therapy, fear
of side effects was the most commonly cited reason (36.8%
overall, 36.7% primary prevention, and 37.0% secondary
prevention), followed by a preference to focus on diet or
exercise (25.0%) and belief that statins were not necessary
(19.4%; Figure 2). The primary prevention groups reported
declining statin therapy more often than the secondary
prevention cohort because of wanting to try diet and exercise
(32.2% versus 13.0%, P=0.01), a dislike for taking medication
(22.2% versus 7.4%, P=0.02), and preferring natural remedies
(22.2% versus 5.6%, P=0.008).
Among the 464 former statin users who reported discon-
tinuing statin therapy, more than half (51.3%) were on a statin
for ≥1 year, 29.4% between 1 month and 1 year, and 12.6%
for <1 month. The most common reason patients reported for
stopping statin therapy was perceived side effects (55.0%;
Figure 3). Only 18.2% of adults who discontinued a statin felt
they no longer needed one, with primary prevention patients
more likely than secondary prevention patients to state that
the statin was no longer needed (23.4% versus 13.5%,
P=0.007).
Patient Beliefs
Table 2 shows patient-reported concerns about heart disease
and beliefs in statin safety and risks. Compared with current
statin users, those who discontinued statin therapy were
more likely to report worrying about heart attack or stroke
(50.7% versus 38.9%, P<0.0001) and less likely to agree that
high cholesterol increases the risk of heart attack or stroke
(78.8% versus 85.8%, P=0.0002). In contrast, there was no
difference between worry about heart disease or believing
that high cholesterol increases the risk for heart attack or
stroke between those who declined a statin and current statin
users.
Compared with current statin users, those who discon-
tinued or declined statins were less likely to report believing
that statins are effective or safe: 70.4% of current statin
users agreed with the statement that “statins are safe,”
compared with only 37.4% of those who discontinued statins
(P<0.0001) and 36.9% of those who declined therapy
(P<0.0001). When queried about specific symptoms, differ-
ences in the beliefs in risk were attenuated. Those who
discontinued statins were more likely than current users to
believe that statins can cause liver damage (61.1% versus
54.7%, P<0.05) or muscle aches (76.0% versus 61.1%,
P<0.0001) but not diabetes mellitus (17.6% discontinued
versus 13.0% current, P=0.06). More than 1 in 4 former and
current statin users reported believing that statins cause
memory loss (29.4% versus 27.1%, respectively, P=0.46).
Participants who declined statins were most likely to report
that statins cause diabetes mellitus (24.6%, P=0.007 com-
pared with current users) but otherwise had beliefs similar to
those of current statin users.
There was a greater percentage of missing data for the
questions regarding patient beliefs about statin therapy
than on other parts of the survey. Participants who were
never offered statin therapy were most likely to have
missing data regarding their beliefs about the medication
(Table S2).

Reasons for Statin Underutilization

 Willingness to Take Statin Therapy
Among those who discontinued statin therapy, willingness to
retry a statin was high. When asked if they would be willing to
retry a statin if recommended by their doctor, 11.2% did not
answer or did not know, and only 29.1% were unwilling to
retry a statin (Figure S1). In contrast, 21.3% of those who had
discontinued a statin were “possibly” willing and 38.4% were
“very likely” or “almost certainly” willing to retry a statin.
Willingness to take a statin was also high among those
who were never offered a statin. When asked if they were
willing to try a statin if recommended by their doctor, 41.9%
were “very likely” or “almost certainly” willing to take a statin,
25.8% were “possibly” willing to take a statin, and only 16.7%
reported they were unwilling to take a statin (Figure S1).
Discussion
A large gap remains in use of statins between those patients
recommended by national guidelines for statin therapy and
those actually receiving one. In the PALM registry, a cross-
sectional evaluation of contemporary lipid management in
clinical practice, 27% of adults recommended for statin
therapy were not on a statin. The majority of patients (59.2%)
who were not on a statin reported they did not recall ever
being offered one by their doctor, which was the leading
cause of patients not being on therapy, followed by patient
discontinuation of treatment (30.7%) and patients declining
therapy (10.1%). Among those who declined or discontinued
therapy, fear of side effects and perceived side effects were
the leading reported factors for lack of treatment. Worry
about ASCVD risk was greater among those who discontinued
statins, whereas current users were most likely to believe
statins are safe or effective.
Among those recommended to take a statin but not
currently on one, a majority reported never being offered a
statin by their provider. In multivariable modeling, black
adults, women, and those without insurance were least likely
to report ever being offered a statin, raising concern about
how differences in who is offered a statin may be contributing
to disparities in care. Although it is impossible to know
whether these patients were, in fact, never offered statin
therapy or if they were but did not recall the conversation,
these patients are likely to be open to a new conversation
about statin therapy with their physician. Importantly, even
among those who discontinued or who recalled having
declined a statin, willingness to reconsider therapy was high.
Thus, it appears that there is a large population of patients

 who are eligible for therapy but who have never been offered a
statin or who do not recall being offered a statin but are
willing to consider therapy.
Previous work evaluating statin utilization has examined
clinical and demographic factors, such as age, sex, race, and
comorbidities, but has not focused on how statin utilization
may be affected by patient beliefs regarding statin therapy or
concern about heart disease.13–15 In this study, among those
who were offered therapy but declined, fear of side effects
was by far the most commonly cited reason for not initiating
therapy. Although the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline emphasizes
the importance of a clinician–patient risk/benefit discussion,
little guidance is provided on the best way to discuss real and
perceived statin-related side effects. Although statins are
associated with certain risks, negative news stories about
statins are common and have been associated with increased
rates of statin discontinuation.16 Although we were unable to
determine the degree to which patients’ decisions to decline
statin therapy were related to factual versus incorrect beliefs
about statin safety, misperceptions about statins are com-
mon; >1 in 4 adults in PALM believed that statins can cause
memory loss, including 27.1% of those currently on statins.
Efforts to improve statin uptake should include resources for
clinicians to accurately describe the risks of statin therapy
while combating misperceptions and addressing patient fears
about medication.
Poor medication persistence with statin therapy has been
previously documented, ranging from 40% to 70% at 1
year17,18 and up to 50% of adults discontinuing statin therapy
by 5 years.19 In the PALM registry, statin discontinuation
accounted for about a third of lack of statin use overall, and
nearly half of adults not on statin therapy for secondary
prevention had previously tried but discontinued a statin,
most often due to patient-perceived side effects. Overall rates
of perceived statin intolerance in the PALM registry were
much higher than the rate expected from clinical trials,
suggesting that many patients are falsely attributing other
symptoms to their statin.20 This is consistent with other
studies showing high rates of perceived side effects from
statins.21–24
Adults who discontinued their statins were more likely to
worry about heart disease than those on statins. Those who
discontinued or declined statins were less likely to believe
that statins were effective or that high cholesterol caused
heart attack and stroke and substantially less likely to believe
statins are safe than those on therapy. Consequently, it
appears that fear of statins, not a lack of fear of ASCVD,
appears to be driving underutilization in adults who have

 discontinued or declined statin therapy. Focusing clinician–
patient risk/benefit conversations on addressing concerns
about statin side effects may be more effective than focusing
on ASCVD risk alone.
Fortunately, in both former and “never” statin users,
willingness to try or retry a statin was high, with more than
half of former statin users reporting some degree of
willingness to retry a statin. Many patients can be success-
fully rechallenged with a statin after experiencing perceived
side effects. For example, in the GAUSS-3 (Goal Achievement
After Utilizing an Anti-PCSK9 Antibody in Statin Intolerant
Subjects 3) trial, 43.8% of patients who were statin intolerant
were successfully rechallenged with atorvastatin 20 mg.25
Providers should maintain an ongoing dialogue with their
patients about their willingness to retry a statin and discuss
barriers to reinitiation.
Our
study
had
several
limitations.
First,
the PALM
registry enrolled patients who were potentially eligible for
statin therapy, including those already on statin therapy.
This may have overestimated statin use in the study
population. Second, patients self-reported prior statin use
and whether they had been offered a statin in the past.
Self-reported end points are subject to recall bias and may
have led to underestimating the rate of discontinuing a
statin, declining therapy, and being offered a statin. Third,
although the overall survey response rate in PALM was
high, participants were able to skip questions, and many
never statin users chose to not answer questions regarding
statin
beliefs.
This
may
represent
an
opportunity
for
education, as these patients appear to have few precon-
ceived notions about statin therapy. Fourth, the subsample
of patients who agreed to participate in PALM may not be
representative of the nation. For example, adults who were
more skeptical of medications or the healthcare system or
who had less trust in their providers may have been less
likely to enroll in PALM. Finally, our data come from a
group of practices enrolling in the PALM registry and from
enrolled patients at the time of a visit with a healthcare
provider. Therefore, this sample represents patients who
are actively seen in the healthcare system and cannot be
used to explain reasons for underutilization in those without
access to health care.

Reasons for Statin Underutilization

 Conclusion
Significant opportunity for improvement in statin utilization
remains among adults eligible for but not on statin therapy in
the United States. The most commonly reported reason that
patients recommended for statins were not on a statin was
because they had never been offered one. Willingness to
initiate or reinitiate statin therapy was high in both former and
never statin users. Perceptions about statin safety, rather
than perceptions about ASCVD risk or statin benefit, appear
to be driving statin underutilization among those who decline
or discontinue therapy.
