Abstract
Background
Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is an underdiagnosed condition. Several published cohorts have reported favor-
able mid-term outcomes after SIJ fusion using titanium implants placed across the SIJ. Herein we report long-term
(24-month) results from a prospective multicenter clinical trial.
Methods
One hundred and seventy-two subjects at 26 US sites with SI joint dysfunction were enrolled and underwent mini-
mally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants. Subjects underwent structured assessments preop-
eratively and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively, including SIJ pain ratings (0-100 visual analog scale),
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form-36 (SF-36), EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D), and patient satisfaction. Ad-
verse events were collected throughout follow-up. All participating patients underwent a high-resolution pelvic CT
scan at 1 year.
Results
Mean subject age was 50.9 years and 69.8% were women. SIJ pain was present for an average of 5.1 years prior to
surgical treatment. SIJ pain decreased from 79.8 at baseline to 30.4 at 12 months and remained low at 26.0 at 24
months (p<.0001 for change from baseline). ODI decreased from 55.2 at baseline to 31.5 at 12 months and re-
mained low at 30.9 at 24 months (p<.0001 for change from baseline). Quality of life (SF-36 and EQ-5D) improve-
ments seen at 12 months were sustained at 24 months. The proportion of subjects taking opioids for SIJ or low
back pain decreased from 76.2% at baseline to 55.0% at 24 months (p <.0001). To date, 8 subjects (4.7%) have un-
dergone one or more revision SIJ surgeries. 7 device-related adverse events occurred. CT scan at one year showed
a high rate (97%) of bone adherence to at least 2 implants on both the iliac and sacral sides with modest rates of
bone growth across the SIJ.
Conclusions
In this study of patients with SIJ dysfunction, minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants
showed marked improvements in pain, disability and quality of life at 2 years. Imaging showed that bone apposition
to implants was common but radiographic evidence of intraarticular fusion within the joint may take more than 1
year in many patients.
This prospective multicenter clinical trial was approved by local or regional IRBs at each center prior to first pa-
tient enrollment. Informed consent with IRB-approved study-specific consent forms was obtained from all patients
prior to participation.

 Background
Pain emanating from the sacroiliac joint (SI joint)
may explain 15-23% of chronic low back pain in the
outpatient setting.1,2 SI joint dysfunction (i.e., pain
and disability resulting from abnormal function of
the joint) may be even more prevalent (up to 40%) in
patients with prior lumbar fusion.3,4 The impact of SI
joint pain on quality of life is substantial and often
disabling, similar to that observed with other promi-
nent orthopedic conditions such as lumbar spinal
stenosis and degenerative hip arthritis.5 Quality of
life may be as or more depressed in preoperative SI
joint fusion patients compared to those undergoing
commonly performed lumbar spine surgeries.6
Substantial evidence points to the SI joint as a valid
cause of pain. The SI joint is a richly innervated
joint7 and instillation of local anesthetic into the SI
joint blocks pain provoked by joint pressurization.8,9
Therapeutic evidence validates the SI joint as a cause
of pain: blinded trials of both periarticular steroids10,11
and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the lateral
branches of sacral nerve roots have shown (albeit
temporary) pain relief.12,13
Commonly provided non-surgical treatments for SI
joint pain include physical therapy, chiropractic ma-
nipulations, intraarticular SI joint steroid injec-
tions,10,11,14 and RF neurotomy (ablation) of the dorsal
ramus of L5 as well as the S1-S3 dorsal rami innervat-
ing the SI joint.12,13 But for one 12-month study,15 no
high-quality evidence supports long-term pain relief
from RF ablation, no study supports long-term pain
relief associated with steroid injections, and no pub-
lished high-quality evidence supports the effective-
ness of physical therapy in SI joint pain unrelated to
pregnancy.
Open SI joint arthrodesis, which was first reported in
the 1920s,16-18 is now infrequently performed for
chronic non-traumatic pain, due primarily to relative-
ly large incisions, lengthy hospital stays (3-5 days)
and long recovery periods (often lasting months).
Complication rates are high,19 non-union relatively
common20-22 and patient satisfaction variable.19 Mini-
mally invasive alternatives to open SI joint fusion
have gained popularity in recent years23 and most
published reports describe use of a series of triangu-
lar titanium implants coated with a porous titanium
plasma spray (iFuse Implant System®, SI-BONE,
Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).24-30 Previously we reported
1-year outcomes from a prospective, multicenter
clinical trial of this device in SI joint dysfunction due
to degeneration and/or disruption of the joint.31
Herein we report 24-month clinical and radiographic
outcomes.
Methods
Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with iFuse Implant System
(SIFI, NCT01640353) is a prospective, multicenter
single-arm clinical trial. The study protocol was In-
stitutional Review Board (IRB)-approved at each par-
ticipating clinical site prior to patient enrollment.
The study was sponsored by the device’s manufac-
turer (SI-BONE, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). All study
data underwent both remote and on-site data moni-
toring, and all study data were 100% source-verified.
One hundred ninety-four patients were enrolled be-
tween August 2012 and December 2013 at 26 sites.
Of these, 10 withdrew prior to SI joint fusion and da-
ta from 12 subjects at a single site were eliminated
due to the site’s persistent non-compliance with the
study protocol, leaving 172 subjects enrolled and
treated. Two additional sites were terminated more
than 1 year into the study for protocol non-
compliance, resulting in 3 additional subjects not
having 24-month study follow-up.
Enrollment criteria were as follows. To participate,
adult (age 21-70) patients had to have low back pain
for at least 6 months inadequately responsive to con-
servative care, a baseline SI joint pain score of at
least 50 on the 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS),
an Oswestry Disability Index score of at least 30%,
and diagnosed SI joint dysfunction due to degenera-
tive sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruption. Diagno-
sis was based on a history of pain at or near the SI
joint,8 positive provocative testing on at least 3 of 5
established physical examination tests,32 and at least
a 50% decrease in pain after image-guided injection/
arthrogram into the SI joint with local anesthetic.33-37
Patients had to have the necessary mental capacity to
participate, be physically able to comply with study

 protocol requirements and sign a study-specific in-
formed consent form. Patients were excluded for the
following reasons: severe back pain due to other
causes (e.g., known hip or spine conditions), diag-
nosed sacral pathology of other origin, recent (<1
year) major trauma to the pelvis, metabolic bone dis-
ease (osteoporosis or other bone conditions), any
chronic rheumatologic condition or chondropathy,
allergy to titanium, use of medications that impair
bone quality or soft-tissue healing, neurologic condi-
tion that would interfere with physical therapy, infec-
tion, pregnancy or planning to become pregnant,
known or suspected drug abuse, psychiatric condi-
tion that could interfere with study participation,
currently a prisoner or ward of the state, participa-
tion in another investigational study or involvement
in litigation, on disability leave, or receiving workers’
compensation related to their back or SI joint pain.
All study sites obtained IRB approval for the study
and patients who agreed to participate signed a
study-specific informed consent form prior to any
study-specific procedure.
Baseline (pre-surgery) assessments included a de-
tailed medical history, physical examination, and sev-
eral assessments, including VAS SI joint and lower
back pain, disability as measured by Oswestry Dis-
ability Index (ODI),38 and quality of life as measured
by both EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D)39 and Short Form-36
(SF-36).40 ODI is a validated ten-question survey for
disability due to back pain. EQ-5D is a validated five-
question broad quality of life measure that can be
combined into a single index and represents the time
trade-off (TTO) utility of current health using US
norms. EQ-5D US norms (means and quantiles)
were taken from population-based surveys.41 SF-36 is
a validated 36-question 8-subscaled generic quality of
life measure. SF-36 physical component summary
(PCS) summarizes overall physical health, with pop-
ulation norms with mean 50 and standard deviation
of 10. Similarly, SF-36 mental component summary
(MCS) summarizes overall mental health, with simi-
lar population norms.
Subjects underwent minimally invasive SI joint fu-
sion under general anesthesia and fluoroscopic guid-
ance, with placement of (typically three) implants, as
described previously.31 The iFuse implant, made
from titanium with a titanium plasma spray (TPS)
porous coating, is triangular in cross section, ranges
from 30-70 mm in length and 4-7 mm in inscribed di-
ameter. The implant’s triangular shape is designed to
minimize rotation and maximize surface area. The
procedure incorporates an interference fit between
the implant and adjacent osseous walls to reduce mi-
cromotion. The porous TPS coating allows for bio-
logical fixation in bone. The study protocol asked
participating surgeons to perform the procedure ac-
cording to the manufacturer recommendations, in-
cluding placement of at least 2 implants across the SI
joint. Subjects requiring treatment of both SI joints
could undergo either bilateral same-day surgery or
staged surgery within 60 days of the first. Subjects
were discharged home at the surgeon’s discretion.
Intraoperative and postoperative measures included
number and size of implants, procedure time, fluo-
roscopy time, blood loss and length of stay.
Postoperatively, subjects were asked to remain at
heel-toe touch-down protected weight-bearing using
a walker or crutches for three weeks followed by pro-
gressive increases in weight-bearing until fully ambu-
latory. Beginning 1-3 weeks postoperatively, subjects
were asked to undergo individualized physical thera-
py at a recommended frequency of twice a week for 6
weeks. Post-operative physical therapy involved ac-
tivity modification to minimize pain recurrence, mo-
bility and stability exercises, as well as adjacent seg-
ment joint mobilization for stiffness and pain control,
and general conditioning exercises. Direct manipula-
tion of the treated SI joint was discouraged.
Subjects were asked to return for study-required
follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-
operatively. Follow-up assessments consisted of re-
view of adverse changes in health, ambulatory and
work status, medication use for SI joint or back pain,
physical examination, pain, function and quality of
life questionnaires. Subjects underwent pelvic later-
al, inlet and outlet X-ray at 3, 6 and 24 months and
CT scan at 12 months as part of the study.
Adverse events, defined as any negative change in
health according to an international clinical trial stan-
dard (ISO14155:2011), were monitored continuously
and assessed at all study visits. For each event, inves-

 tigators were asked to rate severity and relatedness to
the study device, the device placement procedure
and, if present, pre-existing conditions. Relatedness
was captured as definitely, probably, possibly, unlike-
ly and unrelated to the device, procedure or pre-
existing condition, and each event was categorized by
body system.
Study endpoints and cohorts. The primary study
endpoint, evaluated at six months after the most re-
cent SI joint fusion (to accommodate subjects who
underwent planned staged bilateral surgery), was a
binary success/failure composite endpoint. A subject
was considered a success if all of the following were
met: reduction from baseline VAS SI joint pain by at
least 20 points, absence of device-related serious ad-
verse events, absence of neurological worsening re-
lated to the sacral spine, and absence of surgical re-
intervention (removal, revision, reoperation, or sup-
plemental fixation) for SI joint pain. The 20-point
VAS threshold was selected as the minimum clinical-
ly important difference (MCID) in chronic lower
back pain.42,43 Various MCIDs for ODI in low back
pain have been reported;42,44-46 we selected a relatively
conservative and commonly used threshold of 15. An
intent-to-treat approach was used for the primary
endpoint; success rates were calculated at subse-
quent time points using all available data but without
imputing missing values. The impact of missing data
on pain reduction and ODI was evaluated using a last
observation carry forward (LOCF) approach. All
other analyses used available data only. The study’s
secondary endpoints included an analysis of patient
success rates at other time points as well as improve-
ment from baseline in VAS SIJ Pain, ODI, SF-36
PCS and EQ-5D scores. All analyses included all en-
rolled subjects, including a small number of subjects
who, during post-enrollment monitoring, were deter-
mined to be ineligible for the study. Pre-specified
were the following subgroup analyses: underlying
condition (degenerative sacroiliitis vs. sacroiliac joint
disruption), history of prior lumbar fusion, smokers
vs. non-smokers, and unilateral vs. bilateral SI joint
fusion. Additional unplanned subgroup analysis was
performed.
The study included detailed imaging analyses of 3, 6,
and 24-month X-rays as well as a 12-month high-
resolution pelvic CT scan. All CT scans were read
independently by 3 non-conflicted bone radiologists
subcontracted by an independent core radiographic
laboratory (BioMedical Systems, Inc. St. Louis,
MO). A “2 out of 3” approach was used to deter-
mine a consensus read for each endpoint, with the
main reader adjudicating discrepancies. The primary
imaging endpoint was the proportion of subjects
showing at least 30% apposition of bone to both the
iliac and sacral sides of at least 2 of 3 iFuse implants
on 12-month CT scan. Primary safety parameters in-
cluded: radiolucency (defined as lucency around the
device consistent with possible loosening of the de-
vice), device failure/fracture, device breach (defined
as presence of the distal end of the implant in the
sacral foramen or outside the osseous envelope of the
sacrum), device migration and adverse bone reaction.
Additional radiographic endpoints included bridging
bone across the SI joint (and extent thereof), positive
bone remodeling response and heterotopic ossifica-
tion. A single reader read inlet/outlet/lateral pelvic
X-rays at months 3, 6 and 24, scoring a subset of the
above-described endpoints.
Sample Size. Study sample size was determined by
pre-planned interim analysis with a predictive enroll-
ment stopping rule. Study enrollment was stopped in
December 2013 with 172 subjects enrolled and treat-
ed as a result of a positive predicted success rate
analysis.
Statistical analysis. For continuous variables,
changes from baseline were compared using repeated
measure analysis of variance. Confidence intervals
for proportions were calculated using standard meth-
ods. Analysis of procedure-related variables focused
on the index (first side) procedure only. All statistical
analyses were performed using R.47
Results
Of 194 patients who were eligible and signed a con-
sent form, 10 voluntarily withdrew prior to SI joint
fusion. All data from 12 subjects at a single site were
excluded due to persistent non-compliance with the
study protocol, leaving 172 enrolled and treated sub-
jects. Analysis excludes data from an additional 3
subjects, who were excluded after the month 12 visit

 for persistent site non-compliance with the protocol.
During post-enrollment monitoring, 21 patients
(Supplementary Table 1) were found to not meet all
eligibility criteria; as these subjects were already en-
rolled and treated, all were included in statistical
analyses.
Baseline characteristics. Subjects averaged 50.9
years old, most (96.5%) were Caucasian and 69.8%
were women. Baseline SI joint pain (mean 79.8
points, 0-100 scale) and Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI, mean 55.2) levels were high. On average, pain
had persisted for 5.1 years (range 0.43 to 41.08
years). Quality of life (QOL) was substantially dimin-
ished (mean EQ-5D TTO of 0.43 and mean SF-36
PCS of 31.7), values that are substantially lower than
normal populations.5 131 (76.2%) subjects were taking
opioid medications for SI joint or low back pain at
baseline and many subjects (44.2%) had a history of
prior lumbar fusion. SI joint pain persisted despite
prior SI joint-focused physical therapy (64.5% of sub-
jects), prior SI joint steroid injections (94.2%) and
prior RF ablation of the SI joint (15.7%).
Procedure characteristics. Fourteen (8.1%) subjects
underwent planned bilateral SI joint fusion. Proce-
dure time averaged 46.6 minutes (range 13.0 to 111.0
minutes) and mean estimated blood loss was 51.0 cc
(median 30 cc, range 5.0-800.0 cc, see Table 2). One
subject, an outlier, had 800 cc of blood loss due to in-
jury to the superior gluteal artery. Four implants
were used in 12.8% cases; three were used in 83.7% of
cases and 2 in 3.5% of cases. Subjects were dis-
charged in a mean of 0.79 days (range 0 to 7 days);
164 (95.3%) were discharged either the same day or
within 2 days.
Subject trial flow. Of the 172 participants, 167
(97.1%) had 6-month follow-up, 157 (91.3%) had
12-month follow-up and 149 (86.6%) had 24-month
follow-up (Figure 1). Reasons for incomplete
24-month follow-up included the following: 5 had
withdrawn consent to participate, 2 had died from
causes unrelated to the SI joint, 10 were documented
to be lost to follow-up, 5 were unavailable for other
reasons, including termination of the site by the
sponsor in 3 subjects and substance abuse in 1.
Primary endpoint. At month 6, 138 of 172 subjects
met the study’s success endpoint definition, for an

 intent-to-treat success rate of 80.2% (95% posterior
credible interval 73.8-85.7%). Using available data on-
ly, the 12-month success rate was 127/159 (79.9%)
and the 24-month success rate was 119/149 (79.9%).
At all time points, the observed success rates exceed-
ed the study’s pre-determined threshold for success
(Bayesian posterior probability of study success
>0.999). Pre-specified subgroup analysis showed no
statistically significant differences in 24-month suc-
cess rates by underlying diagnosis, a history of prior
lumbar fusion, smoking status, or unilateral vs. bilat-
eral SI joint fusion surgery.
Pain and quality of life outcomes. During follow-
up, mean (SD) SI joint pain improved from a base-
line of 79.8 (12.8) points to 26.0 (26.7) points at
month 24 (see Figure 2); the reduction in pain was
statistically significant (p<.0001) at every time point,
including month 1. Similarly, mean (SD) Oswestry
Disability Index score, a measurement of disability
due to back pain, improved from a baseline of 55.2
(11.5) points to 30.9 (20.5) at month 24, with statisti-
cally significant reductions at each time point. For
both VAS SI joint pain and ODI, there was no varia-
tion in response by preplanned subgroups (underly-
ing diagnosis, history of prior lumbar fusion, smok-
ing status, or bilateral vs. unilateral procedures). Ad-
ditional subgroup analyses (e.g., age, race, ethnicity,
number of postoperative rehabilitation visits, gender,
years of SI joint pain, history of pain beginning dur-
ing pregnancy or soon thereafter) showed no varia-
tion in response. Analyses that included imputation
of missing data using the LOCF method showed only
minimal differences in 24-month SI joint pain and
ODI reductions resulting from missing data (-3.1
points [0-100 scale] for VAS SI joint pain and -1.6%
for ODI [0-100% scale]). The proportions of subjects
having VAS SI joint pain improvements ≥20 points at

 spectively. The proportions of subjects with SI joint
pain improvements of at least 40 points at months 6,
12 and 24 were 66%, 70% and 72%, respectively. The
proportions with ODI scores <30 (indicating no or
mild disability) were 46.2%, 50.3% and 46.3%, respec-
tively. That is, the ODI improvement seen at 6
months was maintained at 2 years.
Quality of life was measured using EuroQOL-5D and
SF-36, two commonly used global assessments. Over
the 24-month follow-up period, EQ-5D time trade-
off index, which was markedly depressed at baseline
(mean 0.43) improved by 0.27 points (p<.0001,
Table 3). Similarly, compared to baseline, all SF-36
subdomains improved at all time points assessed
(Figure 3).
Other effectiveness outcomes. At each study visit,
subjects were asked to report ambulatory and work
status, and to compare current pain levels and ability
to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) to their
status prior to surgery (Figure 4). Prior to SI joint fu-
sion, 89.5% of subjects were fully ambulatory. Recov-
ery of loss of ambulatory status related to surgery
was rapid (by month 3, Figure 4) and by month 24,
the same proportion (89.2%) reported being fully am-
bulatory. Prior to SI joint fusion, 37.4% of subjects
were not working due to back or other pain. By
month 24, the proportion not working due to back or
other pain decreased to 25.0% (McNemar test,
p=0.0013). Throughout follow-up, subjects reported
improved pain compared to baseline, with 88.5% re-
porting decreased pain at 24 months and only 4.1%
reporting an increase in SI joint pain. Recovery of ac-
tivities of daily living was also rapid: one month after
surgery 53.2% reported less limitations of ADLs, and
by month 24, 79.7% reported less limitation and only
6.1% reported more limitation.

 Satisfaction rates were high, with 78.1% reporting be-
ing very satisfied with SI joint treatment by month 24
and 93.8% being very or somewhat satisfied. 74.7% in-
dicated they would definitely have the procedure
again; 88.4% indicated they would probably or defi-
nitely have the procedure again.
Medication use. At each study visit, medications
used for SI joint or low back pain were collected. The
proportion of subjects taking opioid analgesics for SI
joint or low back pain decreased from 76.2% immedi-
ately prior to surgery to 55.0% at month 24 (Figure
4). At month 24, 37 who were taking opioids at base-
line had stopped taking them; in contrast, only 7 who
were not taking opioids at baseline had started them
by month 24 (McNemar test, p<.0001). Of those
who began taking opioids, 2 had had contralateral SI
joint fusion, one had recently undergone revision
surgery, and 1 had back pain related to a fall 5 months
after SI joint fusion.
Device-related events. All negative changes in
health were collected as adverse events, consistent
with an international clinical trial standard (ISO
14155:2011). The number of adverse events was large
(454 events in 153 subjects), but the majority were
unrelated to the device or SI joint fusion procedure
(a full listing of adverse events is provided in Supple-
mentary Table 2). Four adverse events (2.4% of all
subjects) were rated by the investigator to be definite-
ly device-related (Table 4) and 3 (1.8%) were proba-
bly related. Neuropathic pain related to implant im-
pingement on sacral nerve roots occurred in 3 cases
(including one non-study-related case), all of which
resolved with immediate repositioning of implants.
In 4 cases, SI joint or hip pain was attributed to the
presence of an implant or bone growth around the
implant.
Procedure-related events. Twenty-six events were
rated as probably or definitely related to the place-
ment procedure (Table 4). The most common events
were wound infection, irritation or drainage, SI joint
pain related to implant malposition (described)
above, and recurrent SI joint pain related to inade-
quate device placement. One subject had a deep
wound infection that required surgical debridement.
Adverse event severity. Seventy-three events were
noted to be severe, of which 1 was probably or defi-
nitely related to the device and 7 were probably or
definitely related to the procedure. The device-
related severe event was the above-described case of
neuropathic pain related to suboptimal implant
placement. The 6 procedure-related events were the
above case plus: two cases of recurrent or persistent
pain due to suboptimal implant position requiring re-
vision surgery (described above), one case of postop-
erative surgical pain requiring brief hospitalization,
one case of postoperative nausea/vomiting requiring
prolonged hospitalization, and one case of deep
wound infection requiring surgical wound debride-
ment.
Revisions. Revision surgery of the index side(s) oc-
curred in 8 cases (4.7%). In 2 cases, subjects awoke
with new onset leg pain; pain resolved when im-
plants were repositioned slightly. In 4 cases, SI joint
pain improved only minimally after SI joint fusion

with the lower implants not placed sufficiently into
the sacrum. In 1 case, radiolucencies along the im-
plants were present on CT scan. All 4 underwent
placement of additional devices with improvement in
SI joint pain thereafter. One subject underwent
staged bilateral SI joint fusion with initial pain relief
on the index side followed by pain recurrence 6
months later. Workup showed bilateral labral tears
and evidence of possible femoral acetabular impinge-
ment. Since repeat bilateral SI joint block provided
temporary pain relief but intra-articular hip injec-
tions did not, he underwent traditional open SI joint
arthrodesis followed by placement of one additional
implant in each SI joint, which resulted in improved
SI joint pain. Finally, one subject underwent L4-S1
fusion at a different institution approximately 13
months after right-sided SI joint fusion. A few
months later, recurrent index-side SI joint pain de-
veloped. CT showed that the S1 screw was touching

 the proximal SI joint implant. Because the subject
had pain relief with a repeat SI joint block, the sub-
ject underwent revision surgery in which the caudal
implant was removed and an additional (non-iFuse)
device placed across the joint. The investigator be-
lieved that recurrent SI joint pain could have been
from additional stress transfer to the SI joint after the
lumbar fusion, or possibly related to the S1 pedicle
screw touching the proximal iFuse implant.
Imaging findings. Imaging analysis was based on
scheduled pelvic X-rays (inlet, outlet and lateral) at
months 3, 6 and 24 and a 12-month high resolution
pelvic CT scan. The study’s primary radiographic
endpoint was based on the 12-month CT scan.
X-ray analysis. 146 subjects (84.9%) underwent 1 or
more scheduled pelvic X-rays (inlet, outlet and later-
al) at months 3, 6 and 24. Of these, 128 (87.7%) had
an X-ray at all 3 time points. Areas of lucency around
one or more implants was present on the right side in
39 subjects and on the left side in 33 subjects. In the
majority of cases (24 and 21 subjects, respectively)
radiolucency was confined to the distal tip of the im-
plant within the sacrum. In a minority of cases (15
and 12 subjects, respectively), radiolucency on the
right or left side spanned a longer section of the im-

plant within either the sacrum or ilium (Table 6).
CT analysis. Twelve month CT was done in 159 of
161 (98.8%) subjects still participating at month 12.
Bone adherent/adjacent to placed implants covering
>30% of the surface area of the implant was seen in
>90% of implants (Table 5). Bony apposition to at
least 30% of the implant surface area on both the iliac
and sacral sides of 2 or more implants, the study’s
primary imaging endpoint, occurred in 97% of treated
sides. Of the 3 cases where apposition could not be
confirmed, the CT was technically inadequate in 2.
Radiolucency was seen in 9 of 91 cases on the right
and in 8 of 93 cases on the left. The degree of radi-
olucency was <15% in most cases and radiolucency
was typically seen when the distal end of the implant
was barely (e.g., <1 cm) into the sacrum. Breach of
the implant into the sacral foramen was present in a
small number of cases (4 on the right and 8 on the
left). No patient had symptoms related to breach
seen on the month 12 CT. No device failure or de-
vice migration was seen. Adverse bone reaction was
generally absent; in 3 (right) and 6 (left) cases, small
cystic changes or scattered erosions were seen. Bone
remodeling was seen in >80% of treated SI joints.
Bridging bone was seen in a minority of cases (20 on
the right, 19 on the left) either adjacent to or distant
from placed implants.
Discussion
Our study, the first prospective multicenter report of
2-year outcomes after minimally invasive SI joint fu-
sion, provides strong evidence that patients can be
diagnosed with SI joint dysfunction and successfully
treated with triangular titanium implants placed dur-
ing a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Study
data show marked improvement in SI joint pain ex-
tending to 2 years, with parallel changes in disability
as measured by ODI, and quality of life as measured
by two commonly used instruments (SF-36 and
EQ-5D). The proportion of subjects with clinically
important (≥15 points) improvement in ODI was
meaningful (about two-thirds). Quality of life im-
provements were substantial as measured by EQ-5D
and approximately 1 SD for SF-36. We observed par-
allel improvements in self-rated global assessments
of pain levels, limitations in activities of daily living,

 vides strong support for minimally invasive SI joint
fusion as a standard treatment choice in patients with
SI joint dysfunction unresponsive to non-surgical
treatment. Our study also confirms that a minimally
invasive surgical approach is associated with expect-
ed benefits of minimal blood loss, relatively short
procedure times, a short hospital length of stay, and a
low rate of adverse events.
SI joint pain has a marked impact on quality of life.
Baseline quality of life scores in study subjects are
consistent with a high burden of disease5 and quality
scores in our cohort were at least as depressed as
those of other major orthopedic conditions common-
ly treated surgically, such as lumbar spinal stenosis
and degenerative hip arthritis.5 We observed marked
improvements in quality of life after SI joint fusion
with two commonly used quality of life instruments
(EQ-5D and SF-36). The improvements seen in all
measured parameters (pain, disability and quality of
life) were impressive given the long duration of SI
joint pain (on average 5 years) and the high rate of
failure of prior therapies (64% had received physical
therapy, 94% had received SI joint steroid injections
and 16% had received RF ablation). In contrast to oth-
er studies of spine surgeries, in which patients with
prior spine surgery are typically excluded, our study
allowed patients with prior lumbar fusion to partici-
pate, as this is known to be a risk factor for SI joint
degeneration,51 possibly by increasing adjacent seg-
ment stresses.52 Prior lumbar fusion was common
(44.2%) and many patients had a history of concomi-
tant spine and hip disease, making the observed im-
provement in pain and QOL all the more impressive.
Interestingly, pre-specified subgroup analysis showed
that subjects with a history of prior lumbar fusion re-
sponded similarly to those without such a history.
Outcomes observed in our trial were comparable to
those of other accepted surgical spine treatments. In
our study, 69.1% of subjects had 15 or more point im-
provement in ODI at 2 years, values similar to that
observed after CHARITE artificial disc replacement
(68%53). In an early study of lumbar fusion using re-
combinant bone morphogenetic protein, 83% of sub-
jects had a 15-point or more improvement in ODI at
month 24.54 In another randomized trial of lumbar fu-
sion with recombinant bone morphogenetic protein,
71% had 15-point improvements.55 Mean improve-
ment in ODI in our cohort (24.5 points) was about
the same as that observed in SPORT’s lumbar de-
generative spondylolisthesis study (24 points56),
slightly larger than that observed in SPORT’s lumbar
stenosis trial (20 points in the “as treated” analysis
of the randomized and observational cohort57), and
smaller than that observed in SPORT’s lumbar disc
herniation study (37.6 points58). Improvements in our
cohort occurred despite the common finding of prior
lumbar fusion (44.2%) and concomitant hip or spine
disease (24.4% spinal stenosis, 14.0% hip problems,
9.3% prior sacral trauma), conditions that often result
in exclusion from other clinical trials.
SI joint pain has often been called “controversial”
and challenging to diagnose, especially because other
conditions (e.g., lumbar disc disease, hip osteoarthri-
tis) can mimic SI joint pain. Unfortunately, no imag-
ing study finding currently available is pathognomon-
ic of SI joint dysfunction. Similar to other painful
conditions, there is no gold standard for the diagno-
sis of any pain generator, and the idea that SI joint
dysfunction diagnosis is challenging may stem, in
part, from this void. Nonetheless, the diagnostic al-
gorithm used in our study, which includes a typical
history of off-center buttocks or low back pain below
L5 and a positive Fortin finger test,59 positive find-
ings on 3 or more physical examination provocative
maneuvers that stress the SI joint and reproduce SI
joint pain, and confirmatory diagnostic SI joint block,
identified a patient population with a high response
rate to definitive treatment, with high long-term posi-
tive response rates. The high response rate validates
the diagnostic approach. The use of diagnostic
blocks in other pain conditions is commonly per-
formed, and confirmatory diagnostic SI joint block is
recommended by multiple pain and anesthesia spe-
cialty societies.33-37
Opioid use in the US has been termed an epidem-
ic60,61 and concern remains about rising rates of pre-
scribed opioid use for pain treatment. Chronic opioid
use after lumbar fusion is common, occurring in
>50% of patients in one study.62 In this study, chronic
opioid use was associated with less return to work,
and chronic opioid use prior to lumbar fusion was as-
sociated with failed back syndrome, additional

 surgery, depression and extended work loss. In a
community-based comparison of surgical vs. non-
surgical treatments for chronic low back pain, the
proportion of patients taking opioids at 1 year de-
creased in non-surgical but not surgical patients.63 In
a prospective case series, the proportion of spine
surgery patients who were taking opioids preopera-
tively and at 1 year did not change.64 In the SPORT
studies, the likelihood of opioid use amongst patients
taking opioids at baseline decreased, while the inci-
dence of new opioid use amongst non-users at base-
line was modest.65 Surgical treatment in SPORT was
associated with a lower incidence of opioid use com-
pared to non-surgical treatment, but the non-
randomized nature of treatment selection severely
limits the comparison. Moreover, the overall propor-
tion of SPORT participants taking any opioids at
each study visit was not reported. In our study, the
incidence of opioid use at baseline was high (76.2%),
which may reflect the underlying severity and
chronicity of disease, and the reduction in opioid use
was important (55.0% at 24 months, a reduction of
28.2%). This reduction was consistent with results
from a randomized trial of SI joint fusion, showing a
reduction of opioid use at 6 months in the SI joint fu-
sion group but an increase in the non-surgical
group.50 We note that pain and disability did not re-
solve completely in our cohort, and the use of opi-
oids remained high. Potential explanations include:
1) the presence of comorbid conditions that require
opioid use, 2) the long duration of SI joint pain (aver-
age of 5 years in our cohort), which could itself limit
pain and disability improvement due to social or psy-
chological factors, and 3) complications from prior
surgeries, especially lumbar fusion, which may have
been provided to patients on the basis of misdiagno-
sis of lower back pain as coming from the spine in-
stead of the SI joint.
Imaging findings in our study, read by radiologists at
an independent core laboratory, were instructive.
The titanium implants used to perform SI joint fu-
sion were designed for biological fixation in bone,
and the study’s primary imaging endpoint, the pro-
portion of subjects showing bony apposition to at
least 30% of the implant surface area on both the iliac
and sacral sides of 2 or more implants, occurred in
97% of treated sides, validating the implant’s design.
The presence of bone on the implants suggests good
bony integration and permanent stabilization of the
SI joint. The number of implants with radiolucencies
suggestive of implant loosening were small. As noted
above, 97% of patients showed adherence of bone to
at least 2 implants on both the sacral and ilial sides.
The significance of scattered radiolucencies on im-
plants is therefore unclear. Lucencies were more ap-
parent on X-ray; these were typically around the
leading edge of the implants that were placed less
than 1 cm deep into the target sacrum. While lucen-
cies along the implant’s length may suggest a risk for
inadequate fixation, the clinical impact may be limit-
ed in the long term by fusion across the SI joint itself.
To date, only 1 of 172 patients underwent implant re-
vision as a result of symptomatic loosening that was
apparent along a major portion of the implant. Im-
plant breach into the sacral foramen or beyond the
sacral cortical bone anteriorly or posteriorly were
present in a small number of patients, most of whom
were asymptomatic. No device failures or migration
were seen. Adverse bone reaction was generally ab-
sent, with a small number of cases showing small cys-
tic changes or scattered erosions. Bone remodeling,
predominantly in the ilium, was seen in >80% of
treated SI joints, suggesting a positive impact of sta-
bilization on bone structure.
Bridging bone across the SI joint was seen in a mi-
nority (approximately 22%) of cases. Given that a
five-year study using the same imaging technique
(pelvic CT) showed bridging bone in most cases
(87%),49 it is apparent that the technique used in our
study may require longer periods of time to produce
radiographically visible full bony bridging across the
joint. Whether alternative techniques aimed at accel-
erating bony fusion across the SI joint (e.g., intraop-
erative decortication) produce incremental patient
benefits is unknown. What is clear is that both short-
and long-term data from our study indicate excellent
pain, disability and quality of life improvements with
the current device and technique, providing strong
evidence that placement of porous TPS-coated trian-
gular titanium implants transarticularly across the SI
joint through a lateral approach results in clinically
important beneficial patient outcomes. Implants
clearly blocked joint motion and produced positive
clinical outcomes even without radiographically visi-

 ble arthrodesis of the SI joint (at 1 year).
In our cohort, revision surgeries were required in a
small number of cases. Early revisions were per-
formed in 2 cases to address radicular symptoms re-
lated to implant malposition; radicular pain resolved
rapidly in both subjects on repositioning of offending
devices. In 4 cases, SI joint pain did not improve and
CT scan showed poor implant placement with caudal
implants not fully engaging the sacrum. Revision
surgery in these cases, with placement of additional
implants, resulted in improved symptoms. These
findings highlight the importance of placing a suffi-
cient number of devices across the SI joint. Multiple
studies have demonstrated superior SI joint stability
with two-screw constructs compared to a single
screw for unstable pelvic fractures.66-68 Moreover,
biomechanical studies show that placement of 3
iFuse implants across a SI joint reduced motion in
flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation,
with larger reductions observed using a transarticular
configuration when compared with an inline (poste-
rior) configuration.69 One subject had pain associated
with radiolucencies around the implant. Finally, in
one study subject, failure to improve may have been
explained by competing pathology. Overall, the revi-

pears to be low (3.6% or less at 4 years)70 compared to
other lumbar spine surgical procedures.71,72
All negative changes in health were collected as ad-
verse events in our study, which resulted in a high
number of reported events. However, because the
study protocol used an international clinical trial
standard (ISO14155:2011), which defines an adverse
event as any negative change in health, most adverse
events were unrelated to the study device or proce-
dure. Only 7 events were deemed related to the study
implant, of which 3 were related to poor implant
placement causing nerve irritation and one was relat-
ed to a fall associated with inadequate implant place-
ment. 26 events were deemed related to the study
procedure; the events were not unexpected and all
resolved.
Several devices are now commercially available in the
US and other geographies to perform minimally in-
vasive SI joint fusion. Some of these devices are
placed across the articular SI joint using a lateral-to-
medial approach, as done in our study. Other devices
(none of which are currently cleared by US FDA) are
placed into the dorsal ligamentous portion of the SI
joint via a posterior approach. The dorsal/posterior
approach typically involves removal of a portion of
the dense dorsal ligaments and the interosseous liga-
ment, which may acutely destabilize the joint.73,74 As
no implants are placed across the SI joint with the
dorsal technique, the biomechanics of the dorsal
technique will differ from the lateral technique.
Thus, while it is unknown whether the results of our
study are applicable to other lateral transfixing de-
vices, it is highly unlikely that our results are applica-
ble to devices placed through a dorsal approach.
Our study has several advantages. First, participants
were carefully screened against predetermined eligi-
bility criteria and results represent the prospective
experience of multiple surgeons. Second, the trial
was executed according to an international clinical
trial standard (ISO14155:2011). Third, study data
were collected on electronic case report forms at pre-
determined postoperative time points and all data
were rigorously monitored and source verified.

 The study has two primary limitations: 1) lack of a
concurrent control group undergoing non-surgical
treatment and, 2) a 24-month follow-up rate that was
not as high as desired. Regarding the control group,
direct comparisons can be made to INSITE (NC-
T01681004), a companion, randomized clinical trial
run contemporaneously with the current study. In
INSITE, patients enrolled using identical eligibility
criteria were randomized to receive either SI joint fu-
sion using the same device/procedure as used herein
or non-surgical management, consisting of medica-
tion management, physical therapy, SI joint steroid
injections and radiofrequency ablation of the SI joint.
Baseline characteristics of SIFI and INSITE were
very similar.50 12-month results from INSITE indi-
cated a profound difference in response between sur-
gical and non-surgical care, with superior outcomes
for all effectiveness parameters measured. Moreover,
pain and disability responses to SI joint fusion were
very similar between the two studies. INSITE’s non-
surgical group’s response validates that the positive
health effects seen in the current study are robust
and distinct from the natural course of disease.
Marked improvement in pain, disability and quality
of life in the absence of a definitive intervention
would not be expected anyway, given the long mean
pain duration (>5 years on average) and the lack of
prior response to physical therapy and steroid injec-
tions, which were common in the treated patient
population and which have very little support in the
literature as being effective.
Second, 13.4% of subjects were lost to follow-up dur-
ing the study or did not have 24-month visits. Pain
and ODI scores in exiting subjects were higher than
subjects who continued to participate; however, the
impact of missing values on pain and ODI scores
were analyzed and found to be minor, and do not ef-
fect overall study conclusions. Recently published
24-month follow-up rates in spine surgery random-
ized trials conducted under investigational device ex-
emption have shown similar long-term participation
rates (83%/80%,75 89%/82%,76 98%/94%,77 91%/90%,78
81/82%,79) to that in our study (86.6%).
Combined with results from other studies, our study
confirms that SI joint fusion with iFuse implants has
proven to be safe and effective, and hence a reason-
able surgical treatment option for patients with SI
joint dysfunction not responsive to non-surgical care.
Conclusions
This prospective multicenter clinical trial provides
strong evidence that minimally invasive SI joint fu-
sion using triangular porous coated implants placed
across the SI joint improved pain, disability and qual-
ity of life at 24 months in patients with SI joint dys-
function due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroili-
ac joint disruption, and was associated with a de-
crease in opioid usage for SI joint or low back pain.
Imaging showed evidence of stabilization and early
fusion of the SI joint.
