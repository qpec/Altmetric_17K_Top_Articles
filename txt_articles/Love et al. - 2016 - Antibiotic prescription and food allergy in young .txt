Abstract 
Background: To assess the relationship between any systemic antibiotic prescription within the first year of life and 
the presence of an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for food allergy (FA).
Methods: This was a matched case–control study conducted using South Carolina Medicaid administrative data. 
FA cases born between 2007 and 2009 were matched to controls without FA on birth month/year, sex, race/ethnic-
ity. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of FA diagnosis. All models were 
adjusted for presence of asthma, wheeze, or atopic dermatitis.
Results: A total of 1504 cases and 5995 controls were identified. Receipt of an antibiotic prescription within the initial 
12 months of life was associated with FA diagnosis in unadjusted and adjusted models (aOR 1.21; 95 % CI 1.06–1.39). 
Compared to children with no antibiotic prescriptions, a linear increase in the aOR was seen with increasing antibiotic 
prescriptions. Children receiving five or more (aOR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.31–2.05) antibiotic prescriptions were significantly 
associated with FA diagnosis. The strongest association was noted among recipients of cephalosporin and sulfona-
mide antibiotics in both unadjusted and adjusted models.
Conclusions: Receipt of antibiotic prescription in the first year of life is associated with FA diagnosis code in young 
children after controlling for common covariates. Multiple antibiotic prescriptions are more strongly associated with 
increases in the odds of FA diagnosis.

Background
In the United States, food allergy affects between 4 
and 8 % of children and is most prevalent during the 
first years of life. From 1997 to 2007, the prevalence of 
reported food allergy increased 18 % among children 
under age 18 years [1]. In a prospective study of 480 con-
secutive newborns followed through their third birth-
day, nearly 8 % of the cohort was food allergic [2]. Food 
allergy contributes significantly to healthcare utiliza-
tion with an estimated average of 317,000 ambulatory 
visits per year to emergency departments or physician 
offices [3]. A threefold increase in overall hospitalizations 
related to food allergy has been reported from 1998 to 
2000 through 2004–2006 [1, 3].
Newborn children need exposure to immunogenic 
material to develop a healthy, functional immune system. 
Changes in the composition, richness, and abundance of 
microbiota that colonize the human gut during infancy 
has been theorized to play a role in development in atopic 
disease, including food allergen sensitization [4]. Com-
mensal bacteria have been shown to protect against food 
allergen sensitization in mice [5]. Attempts to translate 
these findings to early infancy in one study revealed that 
infants with low gut microbiota richness and elevated 
proportion of Enterobacteriaceae relative to Bacteroides 
spp. were associated with subsequent food allergen sen-
sitization at 1 year of age [6]. In this study, we sought to 
explore the association between antibiotic prescription in 
the first year of life and the presence of any food allergy 
diagnosis code in young children.

Patients and methods
Study design, data source, and participant selection
We performed a matched case–control study using 
Medicaid billing data for children from birth to age 3 in 
2010 were obtained from the South Carolina Office of 
Research and Statistics, a clearinghouse for administra-
tive and vital records data in South Carolina (SC). Cases 
were identified as those children in 2010 with an office 
visit or hospitalization associated with specific ICD-
9-CM codes attributed to food allergy (Table 1). Controls 
were selected from among children from birth to age 3 
who were enrolled in SC Medicaid in 2010 and never 
had a diagnosis of food allergy documented in Medic-
aid billing records since their birth. Four controls were 
matched to each case using birth month, birth year, sex 
and race/ethnicity. Both cases and controls were limited 
to children who were enrolled in SC Medicaid for the 
entirety of their first year of life.
Exposure and covariate data
The primary exposure of interest was systemic antibi-
otic prescription in the first year of life. Information 
about all antibiotic and epinephrine prescriptions in the 
first year of life was obtained, along with the timing of 
the purchase since birth, from pharmacy billing records 
submitted to Medicaid. A dichotomous variable was cre-
ated which indicated whether a child had at least one 
antibiotic prescription billed during the first 12 months 
of life. In addition, variables indicating the total number 
of antibiotic prescriptions filled in the first 12 months 
were created. Additional analyses categorized antibiotics 
by class using the American Hospital Formulary System 
classification. Models were also estimated by creating 
categorical variables indicating the number of antibiotic 
prescriptions filled (1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5) compared to the 
referent group, no antibiotic prescriptions filled. Prior to 
estimating any regression models, antibiotic exposure for 
cases was limited to prescriptions that were filled prior to 
the first diagnosis of food allergy.
Statistical analysis
Using conditional logistic regression to account for 
matching, we estimated the association of antibiotic pre-
scription and presence of FA diagnosis by using odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95 % CIs. Bivariate, conditional logistic 
regression was initially performed to identify significant 
variables (p < 0.05) associated with case status. Variables 
tested included a dichotomous variable for receipt of 
any antibiotics in the first 12 months, labor and delivery 
factors (e.g. antibiotics or steroids administered during 
childbirth), maternal factors (e.g. maternal age, smoking 
status prior to or during pregnancy), and child factors 
(e.g. neonatal intensive care admission, gestational age, 
presence of asthma, wheeze, or atopic dermatitis). Signif-
icant variables were then used to examine the association 
between any antibiotic prescription and case status using 
multivariable, conditional logistic regression models.
We performed several sensitivity analyses. We exam-
ined assumptions about the sensitivity and specific-
ity FA diagnosis using ICD-9-CM coding. We repeated 
unadjusted and adjusted conditional logistic regression 
models only when the FA diagnosis code was submitted 
by an allergy or immunology provider. Additionally, we 
developed a model where only cases with epinephrine 
prescription (and corresponding matching controls) were 
considered. Finally, we considered a model that excluded 
diagnoses that were felt to have lower sensitivity or speci-
ficity, dermatitis, rhinitis, and urticaria. All data analy-
ses were performed using Stata/IC statistical software,

Results
Sample characteristics
The final study sample included 5995 controls and 1504 
cases with at least one food allergy related diagnosis 
code. The relative proportion of each ICD-9-CM diagno-
sis code among cases is presented in Table 1. Key baseline 
clinical characteristics of the sample according to food 
allergy diagnosis are presented in Table 2. As expected, 
significantly more cases had concomitant asthma, atopy, 
and wheeze (p < 0.001 for all). In the control group 
tobacco abuse during and before pregnancy was signifi-
cantly more common (p < 0.05). Vaginal birth was the 
preferred delivery approach in the control group, and 
breastfeeding upon hospital discharge was more com-
mon in the case group. Only 15 % of children with FA 
diagnosis had a prescription for epinephrine filled by a 
pharmacy. The diagnosis of FA was made by an allergy or 
immunology provider in 20 % of FA cases.
Dermatitis (n = 655) was the most commonly reported 
food allergy related diagnosis. Allergic gastroenteritis and 
colitis (n = 130), anaphylaxis (n = 87) and other unspeci-
fied allergy (n = 50) were less commonly diagnosed. 
Specific allergies to milk (n = 99), egg (n = 77), peanut 
(n = 70), and seafood (n = 29) were also reported, but 
the majority of cases did not have a specific food allergen 
identified.
Antibiotic prescriptions
A total of 9324 antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed 
in cases and controls. The overall proportion of patients 
receiving antibiotics by class were as follows: penicillin 
(38.2 %), cephalosporin (15.1 %), macrolide (13.1 %), and 
sulfonamide (5.4 %) antibiotics. These antibiotic classes 
represented nearly all antibiotics prescribed. The mean 
number of antibiotic prescriptions received was 1.53 for 
cases and 1.17 for controls (p < 0.001). Significantly more 
controls did not receive any antibiotic course during the 
first year of life compared to cases with food allergy, 56.6 
vs. 52.0 respectively (p = 0.001). Among those receiving 
antibiotics, the mean number of days to first antibiotic 
prescription was not significantly different between cases 
and controls, 179 and 182 days, respectively (p = 0.33).
Association of antibiotic prescription and Food allergy 
diagnosis
Receipt of an antibiotic prescription within the initial 
12 months of life was associated with FA diagnosis in 
unadjusted models (OR 1.22; 95 % CI 1.08–1.37) (Table 3). 
Additionally, after adjusting for vaginal birth, breastfeed-
ing status, gestational age, maternal age, smoking status, 
urban residence, pre-pregnancy diabetes, and presence 
of asthma, wheeze, or atopic dermatitis, the association 
between receipt of an antibiotic prescription and FA diag-
nosis remained unchanged (see Table 4). We also modeled 
specific types of food allergy based on available diagnostic 
coding; however, only peanut allergy diagnosis (aOR 2.10; 
95 % CI 1.04–4.22) was associated with children receiving 
antibiotic prescription. Compared to children with no anti-
biotic prescriptions, a linear increase in the aOR was seen 
with increasing antibiotic prescriptions. Children receiving 
three (aOR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.01–1.70), four (aOR 1.43; 95 % 
CI 1.06–1.92), or five plus (aOR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.31–2.05) 
antibiotic prescriptions were significantly associated with 
FA diagnosis. In both unadjusted and adjusted models, the 
strongest association was noted among recipients of cepha-
losporin and sulfonamide antibiotics (Table 5).
Sensitivity analyses
Table 5 summarizes several sensitivity analyses compared 
to the original bivariate and multivariate models (Model 
1). The odds of antibiotic exposure were not significant 
when limiting the analysis to FA cases with diagnosis by 
allergy or immunology provider (aOR 1.29; 0.98–1.70). 
The results were unchanged from the original model for 
both unadjusted and adjusted models (aOR 1.24; 95 % 
CI 1.03–1.50) when diagnoses of allergic gastroenteritis, 
allergic urticaria, and allergic rhinitis attributable to food 
were removed. The odds of antibiotic exposure were sig-
nificantly increased relative to the original model when 
only cases with epinephrine prescription were consid-
ered (aOR 2.91; 95 % CI 1.96–4.32).
Discussion
In our sample of children enrolled in the South Caro-
lina Medicaid Program, we identified an association 
between antibiotic prescription and presence of food

allergy diagnosis code in young children. Children with 
diagnosis of food allergy received significantly more anti-
biotics than controls even though we censored further 
antibiotics after the initial FA diagnosis in the case group. 
Our approach could have reduced the observed associa-
tion between antibiotics and food allergy, since controls

had an unlimited number of antibiotic exposures up to 
the end of month 12, while for cases the potential for 
exposure continued only until the initial food allergy 
diagnosis. However, we felt it was important to enforce 
this restriction since considering antibiotic prescriptions 
filled after the initial food allergy diagnosis as potential 
risk factors would have been nonsensical.
In our study, increasing quantity of antibiotic prescrip-
tions was associated with a higher incidence of food 
allergy. We theorize that this could affect the likelihood 
of food allergen sensitization in several ways. Multiple 
courses of antibiotics increase the likelihood that chil-
dren are on an antibiotic while introducing a new food. 
Secondly, there are more opportunities for microbiota 
dysbiosis with more frequent antibiotic administration.
Commensal gut flora serves an important role in both 
immune system development and immune tolerance.

and cell mediated immune function [7, 8]. Also, the inter-
action with normal gut flora is important in the devel-
opment of regulatory T-cells and IgA antibody, both of 
which are important in developing tolerance to foreign 
proteins such as food [9, 10]. Emerging evidence suggests 
that alterations in commensal flora due to early antimi-
crobial use may increase the risk of obesity, inflamma-
tory bowel disease, and allergic diseases [11–18]. Recent 
articles suggest that even antimicrobial food additives or 
antimicrobials in health care products may be associated 
with increased allergic disease [19, 20]. In addition, chil-
dren born via Caesarian section may have increased food 
allergy in addition to other atopic disease, possibly due 
to the lack of early colonization with beneficial bacteria 
from the mother’s urogenital tract [21, 22].
Conflicting findings are available for the few studies 
which have examined the association between antibiotic 
exposure and diagnosis of food allergy. In one small ret-
rospective case control study (n = 99 cases) utilizing the 
same ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes as our study, neither 
postnatal nor perinatal antibiotic exposure was associ-
ated with subsequent food allergy diagnosis [23]. Another 
study was designed to look at several allergic diseases and 
was not powered to identify food allergy specifically. Of 
the 3306 children studied, 173 had food allergy at age 4, 
and 230 had food allergy at age 8. While antibiotic use 
was associated with food allergy, the association was not 
significant in adjusted models [24]. More recently, in a 
large nested case–control study (n = 16,237) maternal 
exposure to antibiotics and increasing antibiotic expo-
sure in children were associated with cow’s milk allergy 
[25]. Our results are consistent with these previous find-
ings, and suggest that other types of food allergen sen-
sitization besides cow’s milk may be associated with 
antibiotic exposure early in life.
Infections represent one of the most frequently 
encountered diseases in childhood, and prescriptions 
for systemic antimicrobials account for about 30 % of all 
prescriptions in pre-school children. In the US, children 
aged 3 months to 3 years of age received, on average, 2.2 
antimicrobial prescriptions per year between 1996 and 
2000 [26], and between 10 and 20 courses of antibiot-
ics by the age of 18 [27]. Most of these prescriptions are 
for otitis media, although most cases are caused by viral 
infection. Additionally, some studies have suggested high 
rates of antimicrobial prescribing for viral infections such 
as bronchitis and upper respiratory infection. In one 
study, 44 % of children with common colds, 46 % of those 
with upper respiratory infections, and 75 % of children 
with bronchitis were treated with antibiotics [28]. Data 
suggests that this pattern continues despite educational 
efforts and increasing reports of bacterial resistance 
[29–31]. Antibiotics are not devoid of adverse effects: 
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash are common and 
well known short-term side effects reported in children 
receiving antimicrobial agents. Antibiotics are known 
to affect the GI flora, with the potential to cause antibi-
otic–induced diarrhea or Clostridium difficile associated 
disease [32–35]. Antibiotics with broader spectrum of 
activity are more likely to have an impact on commensal 
flora than narrower spectrum agents. We are just begin-
ning to understand the potential long-term effects of 
microbiotia dysbiosis due to antibiotic exposure.
Strengths of our study include matching on demo-
graphic variables including month and year of birth, 
multivariate analysis that controlled for variables previ-
ously associated with food allergen sensitization in other 
studies, and a large sample of FA children; however, our 
study has several limitations. First, we defined food allergy 
using ICD-9 codes; thus, we cannot determine whether 
patients had food allergy versus food intolerance. The 
only definitive diagnostic test for food allergy is a double-
blind, placebo-controlled challenge [36], but this is not 
frequently done in clinical practice. Additionally, there is 
not one single diagnostic code for food allergy, but rather 
several codes exist which define the allergen or clinical 
presentation of allergy. In clinical practice, inconsistent 
or varied use of diagnosis codes between providers could

lead to under or over reporting of true food allergy. On 
the other hand, we chose FA diagnosis codes for our study 
based upon prior retrospective analyses of administrative 
records, and we conducted sensitivity analyses compar-
ing diagnosis by provider type, receipt of epinephrine, and 
exclusion of diagnoses to examine this. Second, children 
at risk for food allergy often have other associated allergic 
diseases; therefore, such children may receive more anti-
biotics simply because of these illnesses. Atopic dermatitis 
predisposes to recurrent skin infections such as impetigo 
and Staphylococcal abscesses, and asthma exacerbations 
or wheezing episodes are often treated with antibiotics. 
We controlled for asthma, wheezing and atopic derma-
titis in all logistic regression models to account for this. 
Finally, our study population consisted of patients receiv-
ing Medicaid benefits, thus our study may be more repre-
sentative of a lower socioeconomic group than the general 
population. Lower socioeconomic status has been associ-
ated with higher rates of asthma and allergic rhinitis [37], 
but recent data cite higher rates of peanut sensitization 
among higher socioeconomic families [38–40]. Additional 
investigation in a more socioeconomically diverse popula-
tion would also be beneficial.
Conclusion
In summary, we identified an association between anti-
biotic prescription and presence of food allergy diagno-
sis code in young children. Our results require cautious 
interpretation due to the limitations as discussed; how-
ever, our findings offer a plausible hypothesis for increas-
ing food allergy prevalence since increased antibiotic 
use is common in many westernized countries. Further 
research is needed to examine this association in larger, 
more diverse patient populations with confirmed food 
allergy.
