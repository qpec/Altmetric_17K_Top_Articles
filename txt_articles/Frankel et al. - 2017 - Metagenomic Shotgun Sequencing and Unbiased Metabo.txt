Abstract
This is the first prospective study of the effects of human gut microbiota and metabolites on immune checkpoint inhibitor
(ICT) response in metastatic melanoma patients. Whereas many melanoma patients exhibit profound response to ICT,
there are fewer options for patients failing ICT—particularly with BRAF-wild-type disease. In preclinical studies, specific
gut microbiota promotes regression of melanoma in mice. We therefore conducted a study of the effects of pretreatment
gut microbiota and metabolites on ICT Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response in 39 metastatic melanoma
patients treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab plus nivolumab (IN), or pembrolizumab (P). IN yielded 67%
responses and 8% stable disease; P achieved 23% responses and 23% stable disease. ICT responders for all types of
therapies were enriched for Bacteroides caccae. Among IN responders, the gut microbiome was enriched for
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, and Holdemania filiformis. Among P responders, the
microbiome was enriched for Dorea formicogenerans. Unbiased shotgun metabolomics revealed high levels of
anacardic acid inICT responders. Based on these pilot studies, bothadditional confirmatory clinical studiesand preclinical
testing of these bacterial species and metabolites are warranted to confirm their ICT enhancing activity.

Introduction
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICT) achieves durable remissions
in up to half of patients with metastatic melanoma [1]. However, a
substantial number of patients fail to benefit from ICT, and others
experience severe autoimmune adverse events including dermatitis,
colitis, hepatitis, and hypophysitis [2]. In this setting, investigators have
sought to identify host or tumor characteristics that impact ICT response.
Tumor mutations, gene expression and protein expression,
tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cell infiltration, and levels
of circulating lymphocytes/monocytes/eosinophils are associated with
ICT resistance and response [3–6]. To date, no method reproducibly
modulates these factors and increases ICT response.
There is mounting evidence that gastrointestinal tract bacteria,
collectively known as the gut microbiota, can influence and modulate
host immune responses [7,8]. In preclinical mouse models, the
composition of the host gut microbiota is a major factor determining
ICT response [8–10]. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated tumor-bearing
mice do not respond to immune therapy [8]. B16 melanoma–bearing
mice treated with Bifidobacterium spp. show increased tumor DC
antitumor immune gene expression and enhanced anti–PD-L1

 immunotherapy response [9]. Furthermore, gut commensals
Bacteroides thetaiotamicron or B. fragilis are necessary for
anti-CTLA4 antibody anti-B16 melanoma in vivo efficacy [10].
DCs and T cells mixed with either of these Bacteroides species in vitro
increased T-cell interferon γ production and in vivo tumor growth
inhibition. In all the above studies, the gut bacteria induced
maturation of anti-melanoma DCs and T cells.
Based on these observations, we initiated a study of metastatic
melanoma patients initiating ICT. Patients were stratified for type
of immunotherapy and response to ICT [Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria]. Fecal samples were
collected and analyzed for gut microbiota and metabolite
composition. We report the ICT efficacy in 39 metastatic
melanoma patients and correlate clinical responses with gut
microbiota taxonomic profiles, gut metabolite levels, and patient
dietary and antibiotic histories.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Samples
The study design was a single-site, correlative study of the effects of
gut microbiota and metabolites on ICT efficacy in 39 adult
melanoma patients. The study was approved by the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board
(STU 012016-056). The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. We enrolled patients with a histologic
diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma that were scheduled
to begin ICT and willing to collect stool specimens, store them in a
freezer, and deliver them to our facility. In addition, patients had to
have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Tumor sizes were
evaluated within 4 weeks prior to beginning therapy by exams, CT
scans, and/or MRIs. Therapy consisted of one of four ICT regimens:
1) outpatient ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for four doses (I);
2) nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks
for four doses followed by nivolumab alone at 240 mg IV every 2
weeks (IN); 3) nivolumab alone at 240 mg IV every 2 weeks (N); or
4) pembrolizumab alone at 2 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (P). Repeat
exams and scans were obtained every 2 to 3 months. Demographics,
antibiotic use, and probiotic exposure were recorded for each patient.
Patient histories were also interrogated for consumption of foods
enriched for identified plant xenobiotic in excess in ICT nonpro-
gressors based on metabolomic profiling. Patient response, stable
disease, and progression were evaluated by RECIST v1.1 criteria as
reported [11].
Fecal specimens were collected at patient's homes and immediately
frozen, transferred to our clinic on ice, and immediately stored at −
80°C until sample processing. Fecal gDNA was extracted as
previously described [12,13]. Briefly, ~ 200-mg fecal aliquots were
suspended in 0.7 ml extraction buffer (200 mM NaCl, 200 mM Tris,
20 mM EDTA, 6% SDS) and 0.5 ml phenol-chloroform-isoamyl
alcohol, pH 7.9 (Ambion). Cells were lysed by bead-beating with
0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec) subjected to
additional phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extractions. Crude
DNA extracts were treated with RNAseA (Qiagen) and
column-purified (PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen). DNA was assayed
for purity by spectroscopy, and DNA concentrations were quantified
by a fluorescence-based assay (Quan-iT PicoGreen dsDNA, Life
Technologies).
Metagenomic Shotgun Sequencing (MSS) and Analysis
MSS data (mean of 85,339,022 reads per sample; range
39,703,594 to 121,707,762 reads) were generated from sequencing
fecal gDNA fragments from adult melanoma patients (n = 44; 39
samples prior to ICT therapy and 5 repeat samples within 1 month of
starting ICT) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (100-bp pair-end reads) at
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Genomics
Core Facility.
Taxonomic and functional analysis of MSS data was performed as
previously described [13,14]. Briefly, raw MSS data were quality
controlled using NGS-QC (http://www.nipgr.res.in/ngsqctoolkit.
html), and human sequences were removed with the NCBI
BMTagger Human Contamination Screening Tool (ftp://ftp.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/bmtagger/). Taxonomic composition was
performed by using the computational tool MetaPhlAn [15].
Functional pathway abundance was calculated using HUMAnN
[16] and FMAP [17]. The open-source software package QIIME [18]
was used to measure the diversity indexes using the species-level
MetaPhlAn profiles as input. Linear discriminate analysis coupled
with effect size measurements (LEfSe) was used to quantitate
differential taxonomic and functional pathway abundance between
groups (responders versus nonresponders) as previously reported by
our laboratory [13,14].
Unbiased Gut Metabolomic Profiling with Ultrahigh
Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass
Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS)
Unbiased gut metabolomic profiling by UPLC-MS/MS was
performed by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) as previously described
[19]. Briefly, aliquots of the fecal samples used for MSS were sent to
Metabolon; lyophilized; subjected to methanol extraction; and split
into aliquots for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS in the positive (two
methods), negative, and polar ion mode, followed by normalization to
account for differential volume extracted. Compounds were identified
by automated comparison to reference chemical library entries with
subsequent visual inspection for quality control as previously
described [20]. Peaks were quantified using area under the curve.
For studies spanning multiple days, a data normalization step was
performed to correct variation resulting from instrument interday
tuning differences. For statistical analyses and data display, any
missing values were assumed to be below the limits of detection; these
values were imputed with the compound minimum (minimum value
imputation). Standard statistical analyses (e.g., Welch's two sample
t test) were performed in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) on log-transformed
data; P b .05 was considered significant. An estimate of the false
discovery rate (q-value) was also calculated to take into account the
multiple comparison that normally occur in metabolomics-based
studies, with q b 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a
result. The current analysis was restricted to the 1901 compounds of
known identity (named biochemicals).

Statistical Analyses
Comparison of alpha diversity metrics was analyzed by Mann-Whitney
tests, and when multiple comparisons or more than two groups were
analyzed, Bonferroni's correction to the significance level α was invoked.

 Hierarchical clustering was performed using R (version 2.1.2, package
hclust). Wilcoxan signed-rank test was calculated in R (version 2.1.2).
Statistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad Prism Software
(San Diego, CA) unless otherwise indicated.
Results
Thirty-nine metastatic melanoma patients were enrolled, consented,
provided pretreatment fecal samples, underwent ICT, and had
follow-up exams and scans (Table 1). Briefly, patients were
predominantly male (n = 30, 77%). Median age was 68 years with
a range of 37 to 92. Twenty-two patients had a single site of
metastases: 11 lung, 4 nodes, 4 liver, 2 SQ, and 1 bone. Fourteen
patients had two sites of metastases, including three lung/liver; three
lung/nodes; three nodes/SQ; two nodes/bone; and one each with
lung/SQ, SQ/adrenal, and lung/adrenal. And three patients had three
sites of metastases: lung/liver/nodes, lung/nodes/SQ, and lung/liver/
bone, respectively (Table 1). Twenty-four patients showed RECIST
response (19, 49%) or stable (5, 13%) disease to ICT, what we
classify as responders in this study, and 15 showed progression. Of
those patients treated with IN alone, 16 (67%) were responders (14
RECIST response, 2 stable) and 8 (33%) showed progression. P
treatment alone resulted in 6 (46%) responders (3 RECIST response,
3 stable). One patient each was treated with I alone and N alone; each
was a responder (Table 2). The disease control rate (response plus
stable disease) for both IN and P is consistent with prior studies: a
59% response rate and 13% stable disease rate in a Phase 2 study of
IN [21] and a 44% response rate and 8% stable disease rate in a Phase
1 study of IN [22].
We performed MSS on patient fecal specimens collected prior to
ICT to determine if we could detect significant differences in gut
microbiota populations between responders and those with progres-
sive disease (Figure 1). MSS has several advantages over the more
commonly used 16S rRNA sequencing: 1) elimination of the PCR
bias seen with 16S rRNA sequencing, where specific gut microbiota
taxa can be either over- or underrepresented depending on the choice
of primers and 16S rRNA variable region used for amplification
[23–25]; 2) higher degree of gut microbiome taxonomic resolution,
particularly at the species level, which is important since bacteria
belonging to the same genus can exhibit significantly different
phenotypes or effects on the host [12,26]; and 3) insight into
functional pathways, such as the metabolic potential of the
microbiome. From a taxonomic standpoint, among all treated
patients, ICT responder microbiomes were significantly enriched
with B. caccae (P = .032; linear discriminant analysis coupled with
effect size measurements, LEfSe; Kruskal-Wallis test) and Streptococcus
parasanguinis (P = .048) compared to those with progression (Figure 2).
Among those patients treated only with IN, responder microbiomes
were enriched with the Firmicute phylum members Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii (P = .032) and Holdemania filiformis (P = .043) and the
Bacteroidetes phylum member Bacteroides thetaiotamicron (P = .046)
(Figure 2). Among those patients treated only with P, responder
microbiomes were enriched with Dorea formicigenerans (P = .045).
(Figure 2). Interestingly, despite distinct gut microbiota signatures,
overall gut microbiome diversity was not significantly different
between responders and those with progressive disease
(Supplemental Figure 1).
We then reviewed two specific clinical characteristics that could
have a significant effect on the gut microbiomes of our patients:
antibiotic exposure and probiotic use. Only three patients on the
study received systemic antibiotics immediately before or during the
treatment course. Patient 7 (P7, responder) received a 2-week course
of ceftriaxone prior to therapy. P22 (progression) received 2 weeks of
ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole after two ICT cycles.
P44 (responder) received a course of nitrofurantoin after four ICT
cycles. Of these various antibiotic treatments, only metronidazole
would have activity against (killed) the anaerobic commensals
microbiota that were significantly enriched in responder microbiomes
(Figure 2) [12,27]. Unfortunately, we did not collect longitudinal
fecal samples for P22 and could not ascertain whether the antibiotic

 therapy significantly depleted these bacterial species. In terms of
probiotics, only one patient (P23) took daily doses of the probiotic
Lactobacillus rhamnosus, including prior to ICT therapy. Of note,
P23’s microbiome profile did not show any detectable L. rhamnosus.
No specific clinical response or toxicity was significantly associated
with antibiotic or probiotic use.
Since changes in an individual patient's gut microbiome over time
can be associated with physiologic changes, as we have previously
shown in other patient populations [13,14], we performed repeat gut
microbiota profiling on five patients (P7, responder; P14, responder;
P23, responder; P33, responder; P54, progressive). Repeat samples
were obtained within 1 month of starting ICT therapy. In general, the
repeat sample clustered (in terms of gut microbiota abundance) with
the initial sample, but specific gut microbiota abundances did change
during this time (Supplemental Figure 2). Given the limited sample
size, additional longitudinal studies will need to be done to determine
whether changes in specific gut microbiota populations over the
duration of ICT therapy are associated with clinical response.
MSS analysis also revealed differences in microbiome gene content
(by identifying the presence/absence and calculating abundance of
microbial functional pathways) between responder and progressive
microbiomes. Among all ICT recipients, responder microbiomes
were significantly enriched with bacterial enzymes involved in fatty
acid synthesis (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway ko00061; P = .046; linear discriminant analysis coupled
with effect size measurements, LEfSe; Kruskal-Wallis test). Among
IN recipients, responder microbiomes were enriched with bacterial
enzymes involved in inositol phosphate metabolism (KEGG pathway
ko00562; P b .05; LEfSe; Kruskal-Wallis test).
Gut microbiota–derived products, such as short-chain fatty acids,
and inositol phosphates, can induce host physiologic changes (e.g.,
attenuation of colitis and anti-tumor effects) in the absence of bacteria
[28,29]. Hence, we performed unbiased shotgun metabolomic
profiling on the same patient fecal specimens used for MSS to
determine if we could detect significant differences in gut metabolites
between responders and those with progressive disease. Of the 1901
evaluable compounds (known and named biochemicals), among all
ICT recipients, 83 metabolites were significantly different when
comparing the responder group to the progressive group (49
increased; 34 decreased; P b .05, Welch's two-sample t test).
Among those patients treated only with IN, responder metabolomes
were significantly enriched in 45 and depleted in 22 metabolites
(P b .05, Welch's two-sample t test). Finally, among those patients
treated only with P, responder metabolomes were significantly
enriched in nine and depleted in five metabolites (P b .05, Welch's
two-sample t test) (Figure 3, A and B).
Significantly enriched and depleted metabolites in responder
metabolomes were involved in numerous metabolic pathways (Figure 3,
C and D). Inositol metabolomes were not significantly increased in IN
responder metabolomes as our MMS functional analysis would have
suggested. Inositol is known to be difficult to detect in unbiased metabolic
screening assays, but targeted inositol mass spectrometry approaches can
accurately measure inositol concentrations [30]. Thus, additional studies
will be needed to determine if this metabolite is increased in IN responder
metabolomes. Strikingly, 15:2 anacardic acid levels were markedly
increased in all ICT (62-fold, P = .0077, Welch's two-sample t test)
and IN (94-fold, P = .0288) responders. Anacardic acid is an alkyl
derivative of salicylic acid and produced in the nutshell of cashews [31] and
also in mangos. Interestingly, anacardic acids stimulate phagocytes and can
augment bactericidal activity [32,33]. Since anacardic acid is considered a
xenobiotic and not known to be a bacterial byproduct or metabolite, we
expanded our patient histories to include queries regarding regular
consumption of plant-related products with high levels of anacardic acid
including cashews. Of note, five of six patients with the highest 15:2
anacardic acid levels reported consuming cashews at least weekly.
Discussion
This is the first detailed report of human gut microbiome
metagenomic and metabolomic profiling in melanoma patients
treated with combination anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 immunother-
apy (IN) as well as anti-PD1 therapy alone (P). Using a combination
of MSS and unbiased metabolomics profiling, we were able to
identify specific gut microbiota species and numerous gut metabolites
that were associated with response to ICT therapy in all patients
treated with ICT and also subsets of patients treated with the same
regimen (IN and P).
Some data suggest that gut microbiota–induced immune effects are
dependent on the specific type of cancer therapy administered [9,10].
On the other hand, the gut commensal Eubacterium limosum is
associated with protection against relapse in adult SCT patients [34]
regardless of conditioning regimens and GVHD prophylaxis,
suggesting that gut microbiota may have anticancer immune-

 augmenting effects that are therapy independent. Our findings of
distinct gut microbes associated with human ICT response for IN and
P are unique and consistent with results in preclinical models [9,10].
We described four specific bacterial species involved in modulating
ICT response. Bacteroides species have been previously reported to
enhance anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint efficacy in mice [10] and
are presumed to directly contact and stimulate host DCs and T cells
via pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We conjecture that the
B. thetaiotamicron found to be enriched in anti-CTLA4 plus
anti-PD1 responders in this study may work by a similar immune
mechanism. Furthermore, we found a number of bacteria in the
Firmicutes phylum (members of the Clostridiales order — Faecali-
bacterium prauznitzii, Holdemania filiformis, and D. formicigenerans)
associated with anti-CTLA4 plus anti-PD1 clinical efficacy. Interest-
ingly, a recent study also reported gut Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
synergy with anti-PD1 clinically [35]. Interestingly, patients with
increased Faecalibacterium and response also showed greater
tumor CD8+ T-cell densities. Carbonnel and colleagues performed

Differential taxonomic abundance was analyzed by linear discriminate analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) projected
as a histogram (A, C and E) or cladrogram (B, D and F). All listed bacterial groups were significantly (P b .05, Kruskal-Wallis test) enriched
for their respective groups (responder versus progressive).

 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool from melanoma patients
receiving anti-CTLA4 antibody pretreatment and before each
antibody infusion [36]. The bacterial diversity and species abundance
were not altered by anti-CTLA4 therapy. Firmicutes including F.
prausnitzii L2-6, butyrate-producing bacterium L2–21, and Gem-
miger formicilis were enriched in responders.
Our snapshots of patient gut microbiomes pretreatment may not
accurately reflect potential variations in taxome distribution over days
to months of therapy. In our limited sampling of repeat testing on five
patients, while there was evidence for relative stability of the
microbiome based on matched hierarchical clustering of species
abundances among the patient samples, there was also evidence that

 changes in composition (trending towards significant) were already
ensuing. Thus, while an individual gut microbiome can remain stable
for long periods of time, antibiotics [37] and diet changes [38] can
rapidly alter the gut microbiome. Future studies of distal gut
microbiota in ICT should include sequential monitoring to detect
effects of ICT and the malignant disease.
The detailed molecular mechanism for immune enhancement by
any of the bacteria in humans remains unknown. However, in vitro
studies with DCs have implicated some of these bacterial species with
immune modulation. B. thetaiotamicron releases 10- to 80-nm outer
membrane vesicles (OMVs) that contain mucin-degrading glycosi-
dase hydrolases and sulfatases [39]. These enzymes degrade the gut
mucin and permit the OMVs to reach and be phagocytosed by DCs.
The OMVs also contain toxins, adhesins, and enzymes that trigger
DC activation. B. caccae and B. thetaiotamicron are anaerobic
gram-negative organisms with surface lipopolysaccharide that
stimulate DCs in a TLR4-dependent manner [40]. The five
response-related bacteria merit in vitro testing with human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions. When
bacterial species are combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab in
mixed lymphocyte reactions, interleukin-2 and interferon-γ can be
measured in the supernatant, providing an indirect assay of DC
activation [41]. Furthermore, fulfilling Koch's postulates will require
testing the proposed bacteria in antibiotic gut microbiome–depleted
C57/BL6 mice with B16/F10 melanoma receiving nivolumab and
ipilimumab, as has been successfully applied for testing cGAMP
analogs [42].
There was no discernible effect of patient exposure to systemic
antibiotics or probiotics, albeit the number of patients receiving
antibiotics (3) and probiotics (1) was low. The lack of effect of the
probiotic on P3 is consistent with a baseline stable commensal
community that inhibits overgrowth of the probiotic organism
[43,44]. No particular response or toxicity was linked to antibiotic or
probiotic exposure in this limited study.
In attempt to gain functional insight into changes in the gut
microbiome, investigators have used metagenomic functional
pathway analysis, but increased or decreased abundance of genes
within a given microbiome is difficult to interpret. Gut metatran-
scriptomics are challenging given the lability of mRNA and difficulty
in standardizing sample collection. By KEGG analysis, we observed
increased inositol metabolism enzymes among IN responders.
Greater patient numbers and accurate measurement of gut inositol
levels may clarify the role and significance of inositol-related
molecules, but there are multiple prior reports of inositol phosphates
in innate immunity and anti-cancer activity [29,45]. We performed
unbiased gut metabolomics profiling in an attempt to gain greater
functional insight. Surprisingly, among the 1901 evaluable metab-
olites, the most dramatic correlation with response was seen with a
plant xenobiotic 15:2 anacardic acid. As noted previously, anacardic
acids stimulate neutrophils and macrophages [32,33]. Similar to the
effects of particular bacterial species, the activation of macrophages/
DCs may enhance T-cell recruitment to tumor metastases and,
consequently, enhance ICT. In fact, anacardic acid has been shown to
have antitumor effect in several preclinical models [46]. Furthermore,
preclinical and clinical studies are warranted on this potentially simple
therapeutic intervention.
While these preliminary observations do not establish a causal
connection between gut microbiota/gut metabolite and ICT efficacy,
we plan to pursue larger follow-up clinical studies and more detailed
laboratory investigations. These studies may lay the foundation for
optimizing the host response to ICT.
