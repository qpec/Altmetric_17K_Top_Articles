tSTUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-
analysis.
U
tBACKGROUND: The addition of hip strength-
ening to knee strengthening for persons with 
patellofemoral pain has the potential to optimize 
treatment effects. There is a need to systematically 
review and pool the current evidence in this area.
U
tOBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of hip 
strengthening, associated or not with knee 
strengthening, to increase strength, reduce pain, 
and improve activity in individuals with patello-
femoral pain.
U
tMETHODS: A systematic review of randomized 
and/
or controlled trials was performed. Partici-
pants in the reviewed studies were individuals 
with patellofemoral pain, and the experimental 
intervention was hip and knee strengthening. 
Outcome data related to muscle strength, pain, 
and activity were extracted from the eligible trials 
and combined in a meta-analysis.
U
tRESULTS: The review included 14 trials 
involving 673 participants. Random-effects meta-
analyses revealed that hip and knee strengthen-
ing decreased pain (mean difference, –3.3; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: –5.6, –1.1) and improved 
activity (standardized mean difference, 1.4; 95% 
CI: 0.03, 2.8) compared to no training/placebo. In 
addition, hip and knee strengthening was superior 
to knee strengthening alone for decreasing pain 
(mean difference, –1.5; 95% CI: –2.3, –0.8) and 
improving activity (standardized mean difference, 
0.7; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.3). Results were maintained 
beyond the intervention period. Meta-analyses 
showed no significant changes in strength for any 
of the interventions.
U
tCONCLUSION: Hip and knee strengthening 
is effective and superior to knee strengthening 
alone for decreasing pain and improving activity in 
persons with patellofemoral pain; however, these 
outcomes were achieved without a concurrent 
change in strength.

P
atellofemoral pain is a chronic condition 
characterized 
by 
retropatellar 
and/
or peripatellar pain that worsens with 
squatting, sitting, climbing stairs, and 
running.44 Although the annual incidence and true
prevalence 
are 
still 
unknown, 
it has been de-
scribed as one of 
the most common 
musculoskeletal 
conditions presenting to general practice 
and sports medicine clinics.45,48 The pain 
and disability resulting from patellofemo-
ral pain not only limit short-term perfor-
mance in daily and physical activities, but 
also have the potential to interfere with 
long-term social participation, as 90% of 
patients report pain lasting up to 4 years 
after the onset of symptoms and 25% re-
port significant symptoms lasting up to 
20 years.29,48
Although the etiology of patellofemo-
ral pain is not fully understood, the con-
dition is thought to be multifactorial, 
including both local and nonlocal fac-
tors.11,22,30,32,34 Local factors are related to 
the patellofemoral joint and surround-
ing tissues, such as altered mechanics 
of the joint and impaired quadriceps 
function.9,13 Nonlocal factors are related 
to the mechanics of the distal and proxi-
mal joints, such as increased foot prona-
tion and increased hip adduction and

medial rotation during weight-bearing 
tasks.24,42,46 Theoretically, weakness of 
the hip abductors, lateral rotators, and 
extensors is thought to lead to exces-
sive hip adduction and medial rotation, 
which contributes to altered tibiofemoral 
and patellofemoral joint kinematics and 
patellofemoral joint stress.23
Traditionally, rehabilitation protocols 
for treating persons with patellofemoral 
pain have focused exclusively on local fac-
tors, such as the use of knee orthoses (eg, 
patellar taping and bracing) and strength-
ening of the quadriceps muscles.5,6,8,41 Al-
though there is a lack of evidence on the 
use of knee orthoses,41 knee strengthen-
ing increases patellofemoral joint contact 
area6 and reduces pain intensity.5,15,44 It 
has been suggested that strengthening 
of the hip abductors, lateral rotators, and 
extensors, associated or not with knee 
strengthening, may reduce excessive hip 
adduction and medial rotation during 
weight-bearing activities and decrease 
patellofemoral joint stress. This sugges-
tion is supported by the reported associa-
tions among increased hip adduction and 
medial rotation and weakness of the hip 
abductors, lateral rotators, and extensors, 
a deficiency commonly demonstrated by 
individuals with patellofemoral pain.35,42 
In fact, recent prospective studies have 
demonstrated that increased peak hip me-
dial rotation angle during a landing task5 
and greater peak hip adduction angle in 
recreational runners30 are risk factors for 
the development of patellofemoral pain. 
Therefore, the addition of hip strength-
ening for the treatment of persons with 
patellofemoral pain has the potential to 
reduce pain and improve performance of 
activities of daily living.
To date, 4 systematic reviews have ex-
amined the effects of exercise interven-
tions in individuals with patellofemoral 
pain.4,37,39,44 The first review suggested 
that hip strengthening had a positive ef-
fect on pain reduction, with effect sizes 
ranging from 0.54 to 0.62.4 The second 
review found that the addition of hip 
strengthening decreased pain during 
activity (mean difference, –2.2; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: –3.8, –0.6) 
and usual pain (mean difference, –1.8; 
95% CI: –2.8, –0.8), but did not change 
functional ability (standardized mean 
difference [SMD], 0.6; 95% CI: –0.4, 
1.6) in comparison to knee strengthen-
ing alone.44 However, the findings of 
this review were based on 4 clinical tri-
als with substantial statistical heteroge-
neity (I2 = 82%-90%). The third review 
found hip strengthening to be effective 
for improving pain and patient-reported 
function, with moderate-to-strong effect 
sizes. However, the absolute values were 
not provided, and the inclusion of a non-
randomized trial might have introduced 
bias into the results.37 The fourth review 
included 7 randomized clinical trials and 
concluded that hip strengthening was ef-
fective in reducing pain and improving 
functional capabilities, without changes 
in strength, compared to no intervention, 
placebo intervention, or any other type of 
treatment.39 A quantitative description 
of the results was provided, without the 
benefit of a meta-analysis.39
Given that different trials have been 
examined in different reviews and that 
previous reviews have included a few 
studies with substantial statistical het-
erogeneity or did not pool the results 
from different trials, a meta-analysis of 
the current evidence is warranted. The 
aim of this systematic review was to ex-
amine the efficacy of knee strengthening, 
associated or not with hip strengthen-
ing (from now on referred to as hip and 
knee strengthening), to increase strength, 
reduce pain, and improve activity in in-
dividuals with patellofemoral pain. The 
specific research questions were:
1. Does hip and knee strengthening 
increase strength, reduce pain, and 
improve activity in individuals with 
patellofemoral pain? Are any benefits 
maintained beyond the intervention 
period?
2. Is hip and knee strengthening more 
effective than knee strengthening 
alone for increasing strength, reduc-
ing pain, and improving activity in 
individuals with patellofemoral pain? 
Are any benefits maintained beyond 
the intervention period?
To make recommendations based on 
a high level of evidence, this systematic 
review included only randomized and/or 
controlled trials.
METHODS
Identification and Selection of Trials
T
he review was registered at 
PROSPERO (CRD42015027762).
Searches were conducted in the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, Cochrane Database of System-
atic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
and Physiotherapy Evidence Database 
(PEDro) databases for relevant studies, 
without date or language restrictions. 
The search strategy was registered at 
PubMed/MEDLINE, and the authors 
received notifications with potential pa-
pers related to this systematic review. 
Search terms included words related to 
patellofemoral pain and randomized, 
quasi-randomized, or controlled trials, 
and words related to strength train-
ing (APPENDIX A, available at www.jospt.
org). Titles and abstracts were displayed 
and screened by 2 reviewers to identify 
relevant studies. Full paper copies of 
peer-reviewed, relevant papers were re-
trieved and their reference lists screened 
to identify further relevant studies. The 
Methods section of the retrieved papers 
was extracted and independently re-
viewed by 2 reviewers using predeter-
mined criteria (TABLE 1). Both reviewers 
were blinded to authors, journal, and re-
sults. Disagreement or ambiguities were 
resolved by consensus.
Assessment of Trial Characteristics
Quality The quality of included trials 
was assessed by extracting the PEDro 
scale scores from PEDro (www.pedro.
org.au). The PEDro scale is an 11-item 
scale designed for rating the method-
ological quality (internal validity and 
statistical information) of randomized 
trials. Each item, except for item 1, con-
tributes 1 point to the total score (range,

0-10 points). Reliability of the total score 
is 0.68 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.76) for consensus 
ratings.26 When a trial was not included 
in the PEDro database, it was scored by a 
reviewer who had completed the PEDro 
scale training tutorial.
Participants Studies had to include 
individuals with patellofemoral pain. 
Patellofemoral pain was defined as ret-
ropatellar pain (behind the patella) or 
peripatellar pain (around the patella), 
mostly occurring when load was put on 
the knee extensor mechanism, such as 
when climbing stairs, squatting, run-
ning, cycling, or sitting with flexed knees. 
Studies including participants with 
other knee conditions, such as Hoffa’s 
syndrome, Osgood-Schlatter syndrome, 
Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome, 
iliotibial band friction syndrome, ten-
dinopathies, neuromas, intra-articular 
pathology (including osteoarthritis and 
rheumatoid arthritis), traumatic injuries 
(eg, injured ligaments, meniscal tears, 
patellar fractures, and patellar luxation), 
plica syndromes, and more rarely occur-
ring pathologies, were not included.22,44 
The number of participants and their 
age, level of physical activity, and baseline 
pain intensity were extracted to assess 
the similarity of the subject populations 
among studies.
Intervention The experimental inter-
vention had to consist of a hip- and/or 
knee-strengthening program using body 
weight, free weights, machines, or elas-
tic resistance. The intervention had to 
be of a dose that would be expected to 
improve strength (ie, it had to involve re-
petitive and/or effortful muscle contrac-
tions), and it had to be stated or implied 
that the purpose of the intervention was 
strengthening.2,40 Session duration, ses-
sion frequency, program duration, and 
characteristics of the strength training 
(ie, muscles, type of exercises, setting, 
load, and progression) were recorded to 
assess the similarity of the interventions 
among the studies. The control inter-
vention was defined according to each 
research question: (1) to examine the ef-
ficacy of hip and knee strengthening, the 
control intervention could be nothing, 
placebo, or any other non–lower-limb 
intervention; (2) to examine the effect 
of hip and knee strengthening compared 
with knee strengthening alone, the con-
trol intervention could be a single-joint 
resistance training applied to the knee 
muscles only.
Outcome Measures Three outcome 
measures were of interest: strength, 
pain, and activity. The strength measure-
ment had to be reported as peak force/
torque generation and representative 
of maximum voluntary contraction (eg, 
manual muscle test or dynamometry). 
When multiple measures of strength 
were reported, only measures obtained 
from the trained muscle(s) were used. If 
it was appropriate to use the measures 
from several different muscles targeted 
in the intervention, then the means and 
SDs of the individual measurements 
were summed.1,28
The pain measurement had to be re-
ported as pain intensity and based on 
validated self-reporting methods (eg, vi-
sual analog scale or numeric rating scale). 
When multiple measures of pain inten-
sity were reported in 1 study (eg, pain at 
rest, worst pain, or pain during activity), 
the means and SDs of the individual 
measurements were averaged. Question-
naires examining multiple aspects of pain 
(eg, pain duration and/or pain frequency) 
were included when pain intensity was 
separately reported.
The activity measurement had to be 
a direct measure of capacity or perfor-
mance. When multiple measures of activ-
ity were reported in 1 study, the measure 
used to calculate the sample size or the 
measure that combined more activities 
was used. Questionnaires examining 
multiple outcomes (eg, Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Osteoarthri-
tis Index) were used if they were the only 
available measure of activity. The timing 
of the measurements of outcomes and the 
procedure used to measure the different 
outcomes were recorded to assess the ap-
propriateness of combining studies in the 
meta-analysis.
Data Analysis
Information about the method (ie, design, 
participants, intervention, measures) and 
results (ie, number of participants and 
mean ± SD of outcomes of interest) was 
independently extracted by 2 reviewers. 
Disagreement or ambiguities were re-
solved by consensus. Where information 
was not available in the published trials, 
details were requested from the corre-
sponding author.
The postintervention scores and/or 
change scores were used to obtain the 
pooled estimate of the effects of the in-
tervention, immediately postintervention 
and in the long term (ie, after a period of 
no intervention), using the fixed-effects 
model. In the case of significant statisti-
cal heterogeneity (I2>40%),18 a random-
effects model was applied. Post hoc 
sensitivity analysis was planned when the 
result of the random-effects model was 
different from that of the fixed-effects 
model. The analyses were performed us-

Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, 
Denmark). For all outcome measures, 
the critical value for rejecting H0 was 
set at a level of .05 (2 tailed). The pooled 
data for each outcome were reported as 
the weighted mean difference (95% CI) 
or SMD (95% CI) between the groups. 
Standardized mean differences were in-
terpreted as small (less than 0.4), moder-
ate (0.4-0.7), or large (greater than 0.7).18 
Where data of trials could not be included 
in a pooled analysis, the between-group

RESULTS
Flow of Trials Through the Review
T
he electronic search strategy 
identified 5053 papers (excluding 
duplicates). After screening titles, 
abstracts, and reference lists, 52 poten-
tially relevant full papers were retrieved. 
Forty failed to meet the inclusion criteria 
and 2 papers were found after the search 
update. Therefore, 14 papers were includ-
ed in this systematic review. One of the 
papers17 reported a trial with 3 arms (hip 
and knee strengthening, knee strength-
ening, and nonintervention group); 
therefore, 15 relevant comparisons were 
reported among the 14 included trials. 
FIGURE 1 shows the flow of papers through 
the review.
Characteristics of Included Trials
The 14 trials involved 673 participants 
and investigated the effects of hip and 
knee strengthening for increasing 
strength (n = 9), reducing pain (n = 14), 
and improving activity (n = 12) in people 
with patellofemoral pain (TABLE 2). Four 
trials compared hip and knee strengthen-
ing with nothing/placebo, providing data 
to answer the first study question.7,17,21,25 
Eleven trials compared hip and knee 
strengthening with knee strengthen-
ing alone, providing data to answer the 
second study question.3,10,12,14,16,17,19,20,27,36,38 
Additional information on 8 papers was 
requested from the authors.
Quality The mean PEDro score of the 
trials was 5.8 (range, 3-8) (TABLE 3). The 
majority of trials randomly allocated 
participants (93%), had similar groups 
at baseline (86%), had less than a 15% 
dropout rate (71%), had blinded asses-
sors (57%), and reported between-group 
differences (86%) and point estimate and 
variability (93%). However, the majority 
of trials did not report concealed alloca-
tion (57%), and half did not report an in-
tention-to-treat analysis (50%). No trials 
blinded participants or therapists.
Participants The mean age of the partici-
pants ranged from 21 to 35 years across 
trials. The majority of trials (72%) in-
cluded participants who reported pain 
duration of greater than 3 months, with 
a mean pain intensity ranging from 3 to 
8 out of 10 across trials. Four trials in-
cluded active participants, 6 included 
sedentary participants, and 4 trials did 
not report whether the included partici-
pants were active or sedentary.
Intervention In all trials, the experi-
mental intervention was strengthening 
of the hip muscles. In the majority of tri-
als (79%), hip strengthening was accom-
panied by knee strengthening. The main 
hip muscle groups targeted in the experi-
mental groups were the lateral rotators 
(13 trials), abductors (12 trials), and ex-
tensors (4 trials). One trial25 delivered hip 
strengthening exclusively via functional 
exercises. Participants undertook train-
ing mostly 2 or 3 times per week (9 trials) 
for an average ± SD of 6 ± 2.5 weeks. De-
tailed information regarding the type of 
exercises, load, setting, and progression 
is provided in TABLE 2. The control group 
received no intervention or placebo inter-
vention in 4 trials, and knee strengthen-
ing alone in 11 trials. Four trials delivered 
additional therapy to both experimental 
and control groups.
Outcome Measures Measures of strength 
consisted of maximum voluntary force 
production obtained during isometric 
contractions in 4 trials, concentric con-
tractions in 1 trial, eccentric contractions

intensity were based on validated self-
reporting methods obtained using a nu-
meric rating scale (0-10) in 2 trials and 
a visual analog scale (0-10) in 12 trials. 
Pain intensity was reported as “worst 
pain” in 4 trials, “pain in activity” (eg, 
ascending stairs or walking) in 4 trials, 
or “pain in different situations” (eg, pain 
at rest, worst pain, and pain in activity) 
in 4 trials. Two trials3,36 did not report 
the characteristics of pain measurement. 
Measures of activity were always based 
on questionnaires that reflected perfor-
mance in activities of daily living. The

Effect of Hip and Knee Strengthening
Strength The overall effect of hip and 
knee strength training on strength was 
examined by pooling postintervention 
data from 2 trials (n = 70)7,21 with a mean 
PEDro scale score of 6. There was sub-
stantial statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 
82%), indicating that the variation be-
tween the results of the trials was above 
the variation expected by chance. When 
a random-effects model was applied, hip 
and knee strengthening did not signifi-
cantly change strength compared with no 
strengthening/placebo (SMD, 0.8; 95% 
CI: –0.4, 2.1) (FIGURE 2). No trials exam-
ined the effect of intervention beyond the 
intervention period.
Pain The effect of hip and knee 
strengthening on pain was examined by 
pooling postintervention/change score 
data from 3 trials (n = 112)7,17,21 with a 
mean PEDro scale score of 6.3. There 
was substantial statistical heterogene-
ity (I2 = 81%), indicating that the varia-
tion between the results of the trials was 
above the variation expected by chance. 
When a random-effects model was ap-
plied, hip and knee strengthening sig-
nificantly reduced pain by 3.3 points 
out of 10 (95% CI: –5.6, –1.1) compared 
with no strengthening/placebo (FIGURE 3). 
The maintenance of benefits beyond the 
intervention period was examined in 1 
trial (PEDro scale score, 7/10).7 The 
mean difference between groups after 1 
year was –3.9 points out of 10 (95% CI: 
–7.4, –0.4) in favor of the experimental 
group.
Activity The effect of hip and knee 
strengthening on activity was exam-
ined by pooling postintervention data 
from 3 trials (n = 114)7,17,21 with a mean 
PEDro scale score of 6.3. There was 
substantial statistical heterogeneity (I2 
= 90%). When a random-effects model 
was applied, hip and knee strength-
ening significantly improved activity, 
with an effect size of 1.4 (95% CI: 0.03, 
2.8), compared with no strengthening/
placebo (FIGURE 4). The maintenance of 
benefits beyond the intervention period 
was examined in 1 trial (PEDro scale 
score, 7/10).7 The mean difference be-
tween groups after 1 year was –12.0 out 
of 96 (95% CI: –24.7, 0.7) in favor of the 
experimental group.
Effect of Hip and Knee  
Strengthening Compared  
With Knee Strengthening Alone
Strength The effect of hip and knee 
strengthening, compared with knee 
strengthening alone, on strength was ex-
amined by pooling postintervention data 
from 6 trials (n = 359)10,12,14,19,27,38 with a 
mean PEDro scale score of 6.7. Hip and 
knee strengthening did not significantly 
change strength compared with knee 
strengthening alone (SMD, 0.2; 95% 
CI: –0.1, 0.4; I2 = 0%) (FIGURE 5). One 
trial36 did not provide viable data to be 
included in the meta-analysis. The effect 
of intervention beyond the intervention 
period was examined in 2 trials.12,38 No 
significant change was found in strength 
of the hip and knee muscles between the 
groups 4 weeks beyond the intervention 
period (mean difference, 0.4 Nm/kg; 
95% CI: –0.4, 1.3)12 or 6 weeks beyond 
the intervention period (mean differ-
ence, –2 Nm/kg; 95% CI: –10, 6).38

pooling postintervention data from 5 
trials10,12,16,20,38 (n = 188). Hip and knee 
strengthening resulted in a significant 
improvement in activity, with an effect 
size of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.0; random ef-
fects), compared with knee strengthening 
alone 12 ± 5.7 weeks beyond the interven-
tion period (FIGURE 9).
DISCUSSION
T
his systematic review provides 
evidence that hip and knee strength-
ening is effective in reducing pain 
and improving activity in individuals 
with patellofemoral pain. The review also 
indicated that hip and knee strengthen-
ing results in greater decrease in pain 
and improvement in activity compared 
to knee strengthening alone. Impor-
tantly, benefits were maintained beyond 
the intervention period. Interestingly, 
the meta-analyses indicated that hip and 
knee strengthening did not significantly 
change strength when compared with 
no exercise/placebo intervention or with 
knee strengthening alone.
The nonsignificant change in strength 
found in this review may be explained by 
the fact that the strengthening interven-
tions were not of sufficient duration and/
or intensity. Although the literature in-
dicates a rapid increase in neurological 
activation of the motor units during the 
initial phases of strength training, most 
of the muscle adaptations occur after 8 to 
12 weeks of training.32 The average dura-
tion of the strength training in this review 
was 6 weeks. Only 3 trials,7,10,21 which in-
vestigated 8 to 12 weeks of hip and knee 
strengthening, provided data regarding

ticipant’s body weight, when the Ameri-
can College of Sports Medicine guidelines 
suggest a load of 60% to 70% of 1-repeti-
tion maximum for novices.2 In addition, 5 
trials did not report the load applied dur-
ing strength training. Unfortunately, the 
majority of trials (9 trials) did not report 
the duration of the intervention sessions, 
which could reflect important training 
properties such as volume of training, 
contraction velocity, or rest intervals. In 
summary, the current evidence is insuf-
ficient to support or refute the efficacy 
of strength training to increase muscle 
strength in people with patellofemoral 
pain. Further randomized clinical trials, 
with appropriate training duration and 
intensity as well as appropriate sample 
sizes, are warranted.
Despite the lack of strength increases, 
hip and knee strengthening exercises sig-
nificantly decreased pain intensity and 
improved activity in people with patel-
lofemoral pain, with results being main-
tained beyond the intervention period. 
The meta-analyses indicated that hip 
and knee strengthening decreased pain 
intensity by 3.3 points compared with no 
exercise/placebo, and by 1.5 points com-
pared with knee strengthening alone. 
According to Ostelo et al,31 the cutoff
 
value for minimal important change in 
pain is 1.5 points (or 30% improvement 
from baseline). Because the average ± 
SD pain intensity of the participants in 
the present review was 5.3 ± 2.5 points, 
the changes after intervention represent, 
respectively, 60% and 30% decreases in 
pain intensity, which are sufficient to be 
considered clinically meaningful.31 The 
meta-analyses also indicated that hip 
and knee strengthening had a large posi-
tive effect on self-reported activity (SMD, 
1.4) compared with no exercise/placebo, 
and a moderate positive effect (SMD, 0.7) 
compared with knee strengthening alone.
Improvements in pain and activ-
ity could be related to the inclusion of 
weight-bearing exercises (eg, squats), 
which might have had positive effects on 
other variables related to patellofemoral 
syndrome, such as lower-limb pattern of 
motion47 and ankle flexibility.33 In addi-
tion, the strength training also may have 
increased hip and knee muscle endur-
ance, as training intensity and repeti-
tions, in the majority of the trials, were 
delivered according to the recommended 
parameters for endurance training.2 A 
recent study demonstrated that people 
with patellofemoral pain exhibit dimin-
ished hip muscle endurance compared 
with healthy controls.43 However, these 
hypotheses are speculative at this point, 
and further research is needed to better 
understand the effects of strengthening 
exercises on strength outcomes.
The results of our review are in accor-
dance with a previous Cochrane meta-
analysis44 that demonstrated that hip and 
knee strengthening decreased pain inten-
sity (mean difference, –1.8; 95% CI: –2.8, 
–0.8), and add evidence regarding the ef-
ficacy of strengthening on self-reported 
activity. Therefore, this review provides 
additional evidence on the effect of hip 
and knee strengthening, as the conclu-
sions are based on meta-analyses of 13 
randomized trials and 1 controlled trial 
of reasonable quality. Furthermore, the 
results indicate that the decrease in pain 
intensity and improvements in activity 
were maintained beyond the interven-
tion period, with moderate-to-large ef-
fect sizes, suggesting that benefits were 
incorporated into daily life.
This systematic review has some limi-
tations. Given that a score of 8 was likely 
to be the maximum achievable PEDro 
scale score, owing to the difficulty in 
blinding therapists or participants, the 
mean PEDro scale score of 5.8 for the 
14 included trials represents moderate 
quality, suggesting that the findings were 
credible. Other sources of bias were lack 
of reporting concealed allocation and 
whether an intention-to-treat analysis 
was undertaken. Additionally, the num-
ber of participants per group (mean, 24; 
range, 7-100) was quite low, opening the 
results to small-trial bias. It is recom-
mended that future randomized clinical 
trials provide appropriate sample-size 
calculations so that further systematic re-
views can plan sensitivity analyses based 
on the number of participants.
The current meta-analyses included 
studies that provided hip strength train-
ing and hip and knee strength training to 
the experimental group, which could be 
considered a confounding factor. How-
ever, the exclusion of the 2 studies12,14 that 
provided hip strengthening alone did not 
change the effects on strength (SMD, 0.2; 
95% CI: –0.1, 0.6), pain intensity (mean 
difference, –1.8; 95% CI: –2.4, –1.1), and 
activity (SMD, 0.9; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.6). At 
this time, there is insufficient evidence to 
indicate that hip strengthening alone is 
more effective than knee strengthening. 
Therefore, it is suggested that clinicians 
provide both hip and knee strengthening 
to decrease pain and improve activity in 
people with patellofemoral pain.
Another confounding factor could be 
the inclusion of 3 studies10,14,27 that pro-
vided trunk muscle training (eg, transver-
sus abdominis). However, the exclusion 
of these studies from the meta-analyses, 
again, did not change the effects on 
strength (SMD, 0.2; 95% CI: –0.2, 0.6), 
pain intensity (mean difference, –1.6; 
95% CI: –2.4, –0.9), and activity (SMD, 
0.9; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.7). Based on this in-
formation, further systematic reviews 
should plan subgroup analyses.
Apart from the above-noted limita-
tions, this systematic review has several 
strengths. Heterogeneity among the trials 
pooled in the meta-analyses, based on a 
random-effects model, was low. Overall, 
the included trials were similar in their 
clinical characteristics. Most of the trials 
included adults with moderate-to-high 
levels of pain intensity, lasting for more 
than 3 months. Although most of the tri-
als failed to report the session duration, 
they provided similar session frequen-
cies (mean ± SD, 3.5 ± 1.4 per week) and 
program durations (mean ± SD, 6.0 ± 2.5 
weeks). In addition, this systematic re-
view included 4 recent randomized trials 
since the last review was published,39 and 
also investigated whether the benefits of 
intervention are maintained beyond the 
intervention period.

CONCLUSION
T
his systematic review with meta-
analyses provides evidence that 
hip and knee strengthening is not 
only effective, but also superior to knee 
strengthening alone, for decreasing pain 
intensity and improving activity in people 
with patellofemoral pain. The results of 
the meta-analyses, based on 14 trials, in-
dicated that strength training of the hip 
muscles, accompanied by strengthen-
ing of the knee muscles, 3 times a week 
for 6 weeks can be expected to decrease 
pain and improve activity in people with 
moderate-to-high levels of patellofemo-
ral pain. The training benefits are main-
tained beyond the intervention period. 
Future studies, with appropriate training 
duration and intensity, are recommended 
to elucidate the effects of hip and knee 
strengthening on increasing strength. t
KEY POINTS
FINDINGS: Hip and knee strengthening is 
not only effective, but is also superior to 
knee strengthening alone for decreasing 
pain intensity and improving activity in 
people with patellofemoral pain. These 
results were maintained beyond the in-
tervention period.
IMPLICATIONS: Strength training of the hip 
muscles, accompanied by strengthening 
of knee muscles, should be included in 
clinical management of individuals with 
patellofemoral pain in order to reduce 
pain and improve activity.
CAUTION: Strengthening interventions 
were not of sufficient duration and/or 
intensity, and there is insufficient evi-
dence to support or refute their efficacy 
in improving muscle strength.
