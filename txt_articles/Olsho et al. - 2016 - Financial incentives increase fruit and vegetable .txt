ABSTRACT
Background: US fruit and vegetable (FV) intake remains below
recommendations, particularly for low-income populations. Evi-
dence on effectiveness of rebates in addressing this shortfall is
limited.
Objective: This study evaluated the USDA Healthy Incentives Pilot
(HIP), which offered rebates to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP) participants for purchasing targeted FVs (TFVs).
Design: As part of a randomized controlled trial in Hampden
County, Massachusetts, 7500 randomly selected SNAP households
received a 30% rebate on TFVs purchased with SNAP benefits. The
remaining 47,595 SNAP households in the county received usual
benefits. Adults in 5076 HIP and non-HIP households were ran-
domly sampled for telephone surveys, including 24-h dietary recall
interviews. Surveys were conducted at baseline (1–3 mo before
implementation) and in 2 follow-up rounds (4–6 mo and 9–11 mo
after implementation). 2784 adults (1388 HIP, 1396 non-HIP) com-
pleted baseline interviews; data were analyzed for 2009 adults (72%)
who also completed $1 follow-up interview.
Results: Regression-adjusted mean TFV intake at follow-up was
0.24 cup-equivalents/d (95% CI: 0.13, 0.34 cup-equivalents/d) higher
among HIP participants. Across all fruit and vegetables (AFVs),
regression-adjusted mean intake was 0.32 cup-equivalents/d (95%
CI: 0.17, 0.48 cup-equivalents/d) higher among HIP participants.
The AFV–TFV difference was explained by greater intake of 100%
fruit juice (0.10 cup-equivalents/d; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.17 cup-equivalents/d);
juice purchases did not earn the HIP rebate. Refined grain intake
was 0.43 ounce-equivalents/d lower (95% CI: 20.69, 20.16
ounce-equivalents/d) among HIP participants, possibly indicat-
ing substitution effects. Increased AFV intake and decreased
refined grain intake contributed to higher Healthy Eating Index–
2010 scores among HIP participants (4.7 points; 95% CI: 2.4, 7.1
points).
Conclusions: The HIP significantly increased FV intake among SNAP
participants, closing w20% of the gap relative to recommendations
and increasing dietary quality. More research on mechanisms of action
is warranted. The HIP trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02651064.

INTRODUCTION
Few Americans meet national recommendations for fruit and
vegetable (FV)6 intake (1–4). The shortfall is particularly pro-
nounced among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals
(3, 5), including participants in the USDA Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program (SNAP) (6–10). Serving .46 million
Americans in 2014 at a cost of $74 billion (11), the SNAP is the
nation’s largest nutrition assistance program and an important
part of the US social safety net. Increasing FV intake may de-
crease the burden of disease among SNAP participants by re-
ducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (12, 13) and
cancer (14).
High prices are one barrier to increasing the intake of FVs
among low-income individuals (15–18). A review of observa-
tional evidence found that a 10% price reduction is associated
with a 7% increase in spending for fruit and a 6% increase for
vegetables (19). Other research has tested the effects of price
interventions on food choices and weight control in real-world
settings (20). A few small experimental field studies have as-
sessed the impact of price interventions on FV purchases and
intake. Most of these have examined the impact of providing
a free coupon or voucher exchangeable for FVs (21–25), with 2
more-recent studies testing the effects of price discounts or re-
bates (26, 27). However, these studies have used relatively small
convenience samples in limited settings (e.g., a single supermarket

 or farmers’ market), with relatively short intervention and follow-
up periods (28). In addition, to our knowledge, few have assessed
the impact on dietary intake (28), and those that have done so
have typically relied on simple food frequency questionnaires
instead of gold-standard dietary recall methods.
Researchers and policymakers have recommended further
study of price incentives as a strategy for nutrition promotion
(29–31), especially among SNAP participants (8). The 2015
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended pilot
studies of price incentives and other strategies to encourage
healthier SNAP purchases (32), and many communities have
initiated local FV coupon or voucher programs for SNAP par-
ticipants at farmers’ markets (33, 34). However, to our knowl-
edge, no prior experimental studies have tested the effects of
price incentives that target SNAP participants.
Congress authorized funds for a new pilot study of price in-
centives for SNAP purchases of FVs and other healthful foods as
part of the US Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (the
Farm Bill). On the basis of this legislative authority, the USDA
Food and Nutrition Service designed the Healthy Incentives Pilot
(HIP) to investigate the impact of a 30% rebate on FV purchases
for SNAP participants. The HIP is the first program ever to
implement a price rebate directly through the SNAP’s electronic
benefit transfer (EBT) card. This article reports the results of the
HIP evaluation, which used a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
design to test the impact on SNAP participants’ intake of FVs
and other foods, as measured via a 24-h dietary recall interview
(NCT02651064). The HIP evaluation is one of the most ambi-
tious RCTs of a price rebate to date.
METHODS
Study design
The HIP evaluation study design included multiple quantita-
tive and qualitative components, described in full elsewhere (35,
36); for the sake of brevity, only those evaluation components
directly relevant to the key findings presented in this article are
described here. The HIP evaluation used a parallel 2-arm design
with a 1:6 participant allocation ratio and a 1:1 ratio for survey
data collection.
Participants
To facilitate recruitment of sufficient numbers of retailers to
participate in the HIP, it was necessary to select a local site for the
pilot, in lieu of a nationwide implementation. Through a com-
petitive grant application process (37), in August 2010, the USDA
Food and Nutrition Service selected Massachusetts to implement
the pilot in Hampden County. The selection of Massachusetts was
based on its strength in design, implementation, staffing, and
management plans, including substantial demonstrated support
from community partners and a wide variety of retailers and
farmers’ markets that accept the EBT card. Hampden County,
located in western Massachusetts, includes urban, rural, and
suburban populations; has the lowest median household income
in the state; and has high rates of obesity and related chronic
illnesses. The great majority of SNAP participants in Hampden
County live, work, and shop within county borders. This geo-
graphic self-sufficiency created enough opportunities for HIP
households to earn the rebate, and minimized the potential for
boundary effects (38).
The Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance
(DTA) screened all 55,300 SNAP households with a residential or
mailing address within Hampden County for eligibility. Child-
only cases—households that did not include $1 member aged
$16 eligible to serve as the SNAP head of household—were not
eligible for the HIP; nor were SNAP participants who signed
benefits over to residential or treatment facilities. The DTA
provided the study team with administrative case file records for
the 55,095 SNAP households in Hampden County that met eli-
gibility criteria as of mid-July 2011.
Random assignment
With the use of blocked random assignment, the study team
selected 7500 SNAP households to participate in the HIP (the HIP
group). Twelve household-level blocking cells were created by
completely cross-classifying eligible SNAP households by ge-
ography (3 levels: Springfield, Chicopee/Holyoke, and Hampden
County remainder); household size (2 levels: 1-person and $2-
person); and sex of household head (2 levels: male-headed and
female-headed). With the use of PROC SURVEYSELECT in
SAS (version 9.3), the study team selected HIP participants who
reflected target totals within each blocking cell via simple ran-
dom sampling without replacement. The remaining 47,595
eligible SNAP households in Hampden County (the non-HIP
group) continued to receive SNAP benefits as usual, without
earning the HIP rebate.
The study team verified proportional allocation across the 2
study arms by examining the percentage of the 2 groups within
each blocking cell. The team used linear regression to perform
a robust global F test (robust to non-normality and hetero-
scedasticity) of the HIP assignment variable on baseline house-
hold characteristics from the case file extract to verify balance
across groups.
Intervention
HIP participants received a 30% rebate on purchases of tar-
geted fruit and vegetables (TFVs) while using their SNAP
benefits at participating retailers. Each HIP participant was eli-
gible to earn the HIP rebate for a 12-mo period; implementation
was staggered over 3 equal-size waves of participants, with start
dates of 1 November 2011, 1 December 2011, and 1 January
2012, respectively. TFV purchases were identified at checkout,
with the rebate deposited directly back into participants’ SNAP
EBT accounts. To prevent misuse and ensure that total rebate
payments would not exceed $2 million, the rebate total was
capped at $60 $ household21 $ mo21; in practice, ,10 house-
holds reached this spending cap, with mean monthly spending
of $12.16 on TFVs in HIP households during the pilot.
TFVs earning the rebate included fresh, canned, frozen, and
dried FVs without added sugars, fats, oils, or salt, excluding white
potatoes, mature legumes (dried beans and peas), and 100% juice.
These are the same set of FVs eligible for the Special Supple-
mental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Fruit
and Vegetable Cash Value Voucher.
Several initial informational and promotional mailings to HIP
participants included EBT card sleeves listing eligible TFVs.

 Although there was no explicit promotional campaign, the col-
orful EBT sleeves and other mailings could be viewed as en-
couraging FV consumption. In addition, starting in the 5 mo
immediately before the first implementation wave, the DTA
offered 140 voluntary participant training sessions. These
training sessions described how the HIP rebate worked and which
foods were eligible. In all, only w100 HIP participants, or
w1.3% of all HIP participants, attended training sessions. To
support HIP participants on an ongoing basis throughout the
pilot, the DTA developed a number of additional resources, in-
cluding a dedicated HIP toll-free call line, e-mail address, and
website, and several additional informational and promotional
mailings. The HIP call line received w800 calls over the life of
the pilot, with most questions fielded focusing on how the rebate
worked.
All 474 SNAP-authorized retailers in Hampden County were
invited to participate in the HIP. The 104 retailers that agreed to
participate accounted for w60% of SNAP redemptions in the
county. Eligible retailer types included supermarkets, super-
stores, grocery and food specialty stores, convenience stores,
and farmers’ markets; the great majority of retailers not agreeing
to participate (343 of 370, or 93%) were smaller grocery or food
specialty or convenience stores that carried few food items eli-
gible to earn the HIP rebate. All but one of Hampden County’s
major supermarket and superstore chains agreed to participate.
Additional details on HIP implementation have been published
elsewhere (38).
Survey sample
After assignment of treatment status and wave, the evaluation
selected a stratified random sample of 5076 respondents (2538
HIP and 2538 non-HIP) to participate in 3 rounds of survey data
collection conducted by trained interviewers: a baseline survey
over a 3-mo period before the start of the intervention (August–
November 2011); an early-implementation follow-up survey be-
tween 4 and 6 mo after the start of the intervention, and a second
late-implementation follow-up survey between 9 and 11 mo after
the start of the intervention.
The initial sampling frame, constructed from the adminis-
trative case file records supplied by the DTA, included 9286
individuals aged $16 y within the 7500 HIP households, and
59,652 individuals within the 47,595 non-HIP households, for
a total of 68,938 individual SNAP participants eligible for
sampling. For the survey, the evaluation defined 72 strata based
on HIP participation status (2 levels: HIP and non-HIP),
blocking cell (12 levels: 3 geographic regions 3 2 household
sizes 3 2 household head sex categories as described above),
and implementation wave (3 levels: implementation start dates
of 1 November 2011, 1 December 2011, and 1 January 2012).
Exact baseline selection probabilities and target sample size by
stratum have been published elsewhere (36).
All respondents who completed baseline data collection and
still received SNAP benefits were eligible to participate in
early-implementation data collection; similarly, all respondents
who completed early-implementation data collection and still
received SNAP benefits were eligible to participate in late-
implementation data collection. Post hoc tests confirmed that
attrition from the SNAP did not significantly differ between the
HIP and non-HIP groups.
One randomly selected respondent aged $16 y in each
household was chosen as the focal adult for survey data col-
lection. In addition, each surveyed respondent identified the
household’s primary shopper (the person doing the grocery
shopping for the household most often) to answer additional
questions about shopping and spending habits. In 79% of house-
holds completing data collection, the selected respondent and the
primary shopper were the same individual.
To preserve allocation concealment, baseline data collection
was completed by telephone interviewers blinded to the allo-
cation sequence, before the DTA notified HIP households about
their selection for the pilot. Advance notification letters were sent
to each selected respondent before each round of data collection.
These letters did not mention the HIP, instead referring to the
study as examining “how SNAP is working for families in
Hampden County.”
As described in greater detail elsewhere (35), the initial sample
size was targeted to ensure a final sample of $1500 respondents
(750 HIP and 750 non-HIP) completing the baseline round and
$1 follow-up round of data collection, after accounting for
noncontacts, refusals, partial completions, and attrition from the
SNAP. This final sample size was targeted to enable detection of an
HIP/non-HIP difference in intake of 0.25 TFV cup-equivalents/d
with 80% power; this target was selected based on a review of
previously published elasticity estimates that suggested that
a 30% price reduction is associated with an w0.5 cup-equivalent
increase in FV intake (19). In practice, response rates were
higher and attrition lower than anticipated. A total of 2784
households (1388 HIP and 1396 non-HIP) completed baseline
data collection; 2009 of these (72%; 1010 HIP and 999 non-
HIP) completed $1 follow-up interview and were included in
the final analytic sample. The flow of participants through the
study is described in Figure 1.
Ethics
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Abt
Associates Institutional Review Board, and was conducted in
accordance with that body’s ethical standards. All survey par-
ticipants provided verbal consent.
Data collection
Trained interviewers conducted telephone interviews in ei-
ther English or Spanish. For the relatively few respondents
with a primary language other than English or Spanish, family
members or friends provided survey translations. The evaluation
sent field locaters to respondents’ homes when respondents could
not be reached by telephone; respondents reached in person who
agreed to participate used a cellular telephone provided by the
field locater to complete the interview. To compensate survey
respondents for their time, the evaluation provided a $20 in-
centive for completing the baseline survey, a $30 incentive for
completing the early-implementation follow-up survey, and
a $40 incentive for completing the late-implementation follow-
up survey. For respondents who used their own cellular tele-
phones to complete the interview, the evaluation provided an
additional $10 incentive to compensate for minutes used.
Baseline survey data collected for the selected respondent
included respondent demographic characteristics, attitudes and

 perceptions about FVs, and responses to an FV consumption
screener based on the Eating at America’s Table Study fruit and
vegetable screener (39); primary shoppers at baseline moreover
reported on household demographic characteristics, participa-
tion in nutrition assistance programs, the household food envi-
ronment, and food shopping and spending.
The 2 follow-up survey rounds omitted items on respondent
demographics and participation in nutrition assistance programs,
but added items on exposure to nutrition education and promotion
and experiences with the HIP. In addition, the follow-up inter-
views included a 24-h dietary recall with the use of the Auto-
mated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM) (40), providing a complete
accounting of dietary intake over the previous day. The AMPM
approach yields less underreporting of food and nutrient intake
than other assessment methods, reduces issues with respondent
literacy and memory, and minimizes respondent burden (41). To
enable estimation of usual dietary intake, a 10% subsample of
sampled respondents in each follow-up round also were asked to
complete a second 24-h dietary recall for a nonconsecutive day.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure for the evaluation was daily
TFV intake. The evaluation also estimated impacts on a range of
secondary outcome measures. First, to assess the extent to which
HIP impacts varied across different types of TFVs, the evaluation
examined individual USDA Food Patterns (FP) components (42)
of TFVs: total fruit; citrus, melons, and berries; other fruit; total
vegetables; dark green vegetables; red and orange vegetables
(tomatoes and other red and orange vegetables); starchy vege-
tables (excluding white potatoes); and other vegetables. Second,
to assess possible spillover effects, the evaluation examined
impacts on intake of all fruit and vegetables (AFVs), including
TFVs, as well as FV types not qualifying for the HIP rebate:
100% juice, legumes, and white potatoes; FVs acquired outside
retail locations (e.g., from restaurants, cafeterias, or food pan-
tries); and FVs in mixed foods prepared from FVs and other
ingredients. All FV outcomes were measured in cup-equivalents
per day (1 cup = 237 mL). Third, to investigate the possibility of
the substitution of FV intake for intake of other foods, the
evaluation examined the intake of the following FP components:
total grains (whole grains and refined grains); total dairy; total
protein foods; oils; solid fats; added sugars; and alcoholic drinks.
Grains and protein foods were measured in ounce-equivalents per
day (1 ounce = 28.3495 g). Total dairy was measured in cup-
equivalents per day (1 cup = 237 mL). Oils and solid fats were
measured in gram-equivalents per day. Added sugars were
measured in teaspoon-equivalents per day (1 teaspoon = 4.929
mL). Alcohol was measured in drinks per day (1 drink = 14 g).
Finally, to assess whether the HIP affected overall dietary quality,
the evaluation examined the impact on the Healthy Eating Index
(HEI)–2010 (43). All intake measures were constructed from
AMPM 24-h dietary recall interview data linked to the USDA
Food Patterns Equivalents Database (44) to compute FV and
dairy cup-equivalents, grain and protein food ounce-equivalents,
oil and solid fat gram-equivalents, teaspoons of added sugar, and
drinks of alcoholic beverages. HIP impacts on other intermedi-
ate outcomes, including shopping and spending, the house-
hold food environment, and attitudes and perceptions about
FVs, have been reported elsewhere (36, 45).
Statistical analyses
The analyses included all participants who completed baseline
data collection and $1 follow-up interview. All analyses in-
corporated sampling weights while accounting for the unequal
probability of respondent selection across strata and for sur-
vey nonresponse; details of construction of these weights have
been published elsewhere (36, 46). To account for respondents
with $1 follow-up interview, SEs and test statistics were
nonnormality- and heteroscedasticity-robust and clustered at
the respondent level. Results with P values , 0.05 (2-tailed
test) were considered to be statistically significant. All statis-
tical analyses were completed in Stata SE version 11.2.
Primary analyses
Because HIP participation status was randomly assigned,
a direct comparison of mean intake in the HIP and non-HIP
groups would yield an unbiased and consistent estimate of HIP
impacts. However, to improve the precision of impact estimates,
we estimated impacts by using ordinary least-squares regression
models and including baseline covariates. Included covariates
were blocking and stratification variables (Hampden county
geography, household size and composition, sex of household
head, and implementation wave); AMPM interview character-
istics (first or second AMPM interview per survey round,
weekend indicator, and respondent characterization of intake
relative to usual amounts); respondent demographics (baseline
age group, sex, and race/ethnicity); usual reported intake mea-
sures from the Eating at America’s Table Study fruit and
vegetable screener; and baseline composite scale measures of
availability of FVs in the home, positive attitudes about foods
and FVs, and perceived barriers to grocery shopping and to
consumption of FVs. To account for item nonresponse for
composite scales, we used mean imputation to replace missing
values and included an indicator for imputed values in the re-
gression (47).
Differences in impacts by FV component
To assess differences in impacts across various components of
FV intake, it was important to account for the fact that different
components comprised greater or lesser proportions of total
intake. To address this issue, we directly estimated intake in
proportional terms in the following manner. First, we normalized
each intake measure by dividing by the control group mean.
While using this normalized measure as the dependent variable in
our impact regressions, the estimated impact can be interpreted as
a proportional change (e.g., an estimated proportional impact of
0.15 implies that HIP increases intake by 15%). To account for
a potential individual-level correlation of residuals across FP
components, we estimated impacts jointly across all components
with the use of Seemingly Unrelated Regression Equations (48).
Finally, we jointly tested for differences in proportional impacts
across selected groups of components.
Impacts on HEI-2010
We estimated means and SEs for the HEI-2010 and its indi-
vidual components separately for the HIP and non-HIP groups
with the use of the population ratio method (49). Because the
population ratio approach does not incorporate covariates readily,
mean HEI-2010 scores were not adjusted for baseline respondent

 characteristics, as means for other outcomes reported here.
However, as noted above, comparisons of unadjusted means
across HIP and non-HIP groups yield unbiased estimates of
impacts under the RCT design, although there may be some loss
in precision from omission of baseline covariates.
RESULTS
Study population, nonresponse, and attrition
Study participants included in the final analytic sample (n =
2009) were similar between the HIP and non-HIP groups, both
in baseline demographic characteristics (Table 1) and baseline
nutritional profile (Table 2). It is not possible to compare di-
rectly our sample to the national SNAP population, because
national statistics are not reported separately for participants
aged $16 y. With that caveat, compared with the national
population of all SNAP households, our study households were
less likely to be single-family households and to include elderly
members. Study participants also were proportionally more
likely to be male and to be Hispanic than was the broader
population of SNAP participants (50).
There were some statistically significant differences between
sampled persons who were or were not included in the final
analytic sample (implementation wave, geography, sex of house-
hold head; sex, age, race/ethnicity, disability status, and marital
status of sample respondent; Supplemental Table 1), and between
those who did or did not complete $1 follow-up interview (per-
ceived barriers to grocery shopping; Supplemental Table 2).
These losses to follow-up did not introduce imbalance across
the HIP and non-HIP groups. All analyses incorporated sam-
pling weights that accounted for survey nonresponse and at-
trition from the SNAP.
Impact on TFV intake
The estimated impact of the HIP on the primary outcome of
interest, regression-adjusted TFV intake pooled across all in-
terviews from the 2 follow-up rounds, is shown in Figure 2. TFV
intake was 0.24 cup-equivalents/d (95% CI: 0.13, 0.34 cup-
equivalents/d; 1 cup = 237 mL) higher in the HIP group than in
the non-HIP group (P , 0.001). In percentage terms, this is 26%
higher in the HIP group than in the non-HIP group.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of a change in impact be-
tween follow-up interviews. The test for differences in impact
across rounds was performed with the use of a linear regression
model with the change in intake between early- and late-
implementation periods as the dependent variable, and the same
set of explanatory variables as in the primary analyses. The
sample for these analyses included only those respondents
completing both early- and late-implementation interviews (n =
2959 recalls from 1484 respondents). There was no statistically
significant difference in impact on TFV intake (P = 0.653)
between the early-implementation round (impact: 0.18 cup-
equivalents; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.33 cup-equivalents) and the late-
implementation round (impact: 0.24 cup-equivalents; 95%
CI: 0.09, 0.38 cup-equivalents). Therefore, we reported only
pooled results for the 2 follow-up rounds together in the re-
mainder of this section; separate impacts by follow-up round
have been reported elsewhere (36).
Impacts on TFV intake by component are shown in Table 3.
The HIP had a positive and statistically significant impact on
intake of targeted fruit alone (impact: 0.11 cup-equivalents; 95%
CI: 0.03, 0.18 cup-equivalents) and of targeted vegetables alone
(impact: 0.13 cup-equivalents; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.20 cup-equivalents).
In proportional terms, this represents a 23% increase in intake of
targeted fruit, and a 30% increase in intake of targeted vegeta-
bles; we found no evidence that these proportional impacts
differed significantly (P = 0.461).
Among targeted fruit, we did not find a statistically significant
impact of the HIP on intake of citrus, melons, and berries (impact:
0.01 cup-equivalents; 95% CI: 20.02, 0.04 cup-equivalents), but
we did find statistically significant impacts on the intake of other
fruit (impact: 0.09 cup-equivalents; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.15 cup-
equivalents). In proportional terms, this represents 10% for citrus,
melons, and berries, and 27% for other fruit; we found no evidence
that these proportional impacts differed significantly (P = 0.260).
Similarly, among targeted vegetables, we found statistically
significant impacts on the intake of dark green vegetables
(impact: 0.03 cup-equivalents, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.05 cup-
equivalents), tomatoes (impact: 0.02 cup-equivalents, 95% CI:
0.00, 0.03 cup-equivalents), and other vegetables (impact: 0.06
cup-equivalents, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.10 cup-equivalents), but not on
the intake of other red and orange vegetables (impact: 0.01 cup-
equivalents, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.03 cup-equivalents) or starchy
vegetables (impact: 0.01 cup-equivalents, 95% CI: 20.01, 0.03
cup-equivalents). Once again, we found no evidence that the
proportional impacts significantly differed (P = 0.099).
Impacts on all FV intake and components
Estimated impacts on AFVs and components, including both
TFV and various FV aggregates not qualifying to earn the HIP
rebate, are shown in Table 4. The HIP had a positive and sta-
tistically significant impact on AFV intake (impact: 0.32 cup-
equivalents; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.48 cup-equivalents), approximately
one-tenth of a cup larger than the impact on TFV intake. The
HIP impact on nonqualifying FVs was not statistically signifi-
cant (impact: 0.08 cup-equivalents; 95% CI: 20.02, 0.19 cup-
equivalents). The HIP impact on TFVs was greater than the
impact on nonqualifying FVs in proportional terms (26% for
TFVs compared with 6% for nonqualifying FVs; P = 0.004).
Although there was no HIP impact on most types of non-
qualifying FVs, there was one exception. The HIP had a positive
and significant impact on the intake of 100% fruit juice (impact:
0.10 cup-equivalents; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.17 cup-equivalents). In
proportional terms, this represents a 21% increase in the intake of
100% fruit juice. Impacts on other categories of nonqualifying
FVs (FVs acquired outside stores and FVs from prepared foods,
legumes, and white potatoes) were generally small in magnitude
and not statistically significant. The proportional impact on the
intake of 100% fruit juice was significantly greater than the
(statistically nonsignificant) proportional impact on other non-
qualifying FVs (21% compared with 21%, P = 0.012). In
contrast, we did not find evidence that the proportional impact
on the intake of 100% fruit juice differed from the 26% impact
on TFV intake (P = 0.577). In other words, the intake of 100%
fruit juice responded to the HIP in a manner similar to TFVs,
and not similarly to other nonqualifying FVs, even though 100%
fruit juice did not qualify to earn the HIP rebate.

 Impacts on other foods
HIP impacts on other foods by USDA FP component are
shown in Table 5. The HIP reduced the intake of total grains
(impact: 20.44 ounce-equivalents; 95% CI: 20.73, 20.16
ounce-equivalents; 1 ounce = 28.3495 g). This difference was
primarily driven by lower consumption of refined grains in the
HIP group than in the non-HIP group (impact: 20.43 ounce-
equivalents; 95% CI: 20.69, 20.16 ounce-equivalents). We take
this as evidence that the HIP resulted in a substitution of refined
intake with FV intake. There were no statistically significant
impacts of the HIP on other FP components. Although the intake
of alcoholic beverages was statistically significantly higher in
the HIP group than in the non-HIP group, this difference was
driven entirely by the presence of 7 extreme outliers in the early-
implementation round who reported $8 drinks of alcohol in the
prior 24 h. When excluding those individuals from the analysis,
the difference between the HIP group and the non-HIP group is
not statistically significant.
Impacts on dietary quality
The impacts of the HIP on the HEI-2010 and its components are
described in Table 6. Consistent with the observed increase in
AFV intake in the HIP group, there were statistically significant
increases in HEI-2010 component scores for total fruit, whole
fruit, total vegetables, and beans and greens. The reduction in
intake of refined grains in the HIP group generated a statistically
significant improvement in the HEI-2010 refined grains score. In
total, positive impacts on these individual HEI-2010 components
contributed to a 4.7-point positive impact on the total HEI-2010
score (95% CI: 2.4, 7.1 points), equivalent to an w8% increase.
DISCUSSION
The HIP increased TFV intake among SNAP participants by
about one-quarter cup, w26%. Healthy People 2020 recom-
mends 2.0 cup-equivalents FVs/d for every 1000 kcal consumed;
estimated total energy intake in the non-HIP group was 1797 kcal,
implying a recommended FV intake of 3.6 cup-equivalents/d for
this population. Intake in the non-HIP group was w2.3 cup-
equivalents/d, or w1.3 cup-equivalents/d less than the Healthy
People 2020 recommendation (51); from this simple calculation,
we conclude that the HIP decreased the FV intake gap by w20%.
Epidemiologic studies suggest that even relatively small increases
in FV intake are associated with appreciable reductions in mor-
bidity and mortality (52, 53).
The observed 26% increase in TFV intake was broadly con-
sistent with the 19% increase we projected on the basis of
previously published price elasticities (19). This increase implies
a price elasticity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.26); as discussed

 elsewhere, much larger samples would be necessary to obtain
precisely estimated elasticities in an RCT setting (54). Two other
recent RCTs of price discounts conducted in more-limited su-
permarket settings (26, 27) also found positive impacts of FV
price discounts on FV intake, although it is not possible to

 A diversity of FV intake is recommended in federal dietary
guidance. In our study, no one FP component of TFVs appeared
to have responded more strongly to the intervention in propor-
tional terms. This contrasts with prior studies finding larger
impacts of financial incentives for fruit than for vegetables (26,
55), although those studies did not formally test for proportional
differences.
Interestingly, the intake of 100% fruit juice rose by approx-
imately the same proportion as TFV intake, even though 100%
fruit juice did not qualify to earn the HIP rebate. This finding
raises questions about the mechanism through which the HIP
operates (45). A pure price effect can explain only increases in
intake of foods whose price is directly affected. The spillover
effect to 100% fruit juice may suggest that a promotional or
marketing mechanism is also important: perhaps explicit pro-
motion of FVs through HIP direct mailings and informational
sessions or implicit promotion through the singling out of FVs to
earn the HIP rebate caused participants to increase their intake of
FVs, even in forms that do not earn the rebate. However, it is
unclear why such an effect would be limited to 100% fruit juice,
while failing to extend to legumes, white potatoes, and other
nonqualifying FV categories. An alternative explanation is that
confusion about the HIP intervention led participants to believe
incorrectly that 100% fruit juice did qualify to earn the rebate.
Lending some support to this hypothesis, only about one-half of
HIP participants reported that it was “easy” or “very easy” to
remember what FVs qualified. However, potentially at odds with
this explanation, although self-reported participant understand-
ing increased between early and late implementation (P =
0.023), there was no associated decrease in the impact of the
HIP on the intake of 100% fruit juice between rounds (P =
0.672). Note, however, that the study is not well powered to
detect subgroup differences in impacts.
There is some indication that the increase in FV intake as
a result of the HIP was offset at least partially by a decrease in the
intake of refined grains, although we did not see comparable
decreases in the intake of other non-FV FP components. Because
of the large number of non-FV FP components examined, this
finding should be viewed as exploratory.
The increase in FV intake paired with the decrease in refined
grains together contributed to an increase in overall dietary quality,
with HEI-2010 scores in the HIP group nearly 5 points higher at
follow-up than those in the non-HIP group. Adjusting for other
demographic factors, estimates from NHANES 2001–2008 show
that HEI scores are 1.25 points lower among SNAP participants
than among SNAP nonparticipants (56), suggesting that the net
effect of HIP is more than large enough to close the gap.
An important policy consideration is the extent to which the
positive impacts of the HIP would be sustained, or even in-
creased, if the program were rolled out more broadly. As noted
above, only w60% of SNAP expenditures in Hampden County
occurred at retailer facilities that participated in the HIP. Uni-
versal retailer participation might increase the magnitude of HIP
impacts, particularly because, as reported elsewhere (36, 45), the
rebate in general does not appear to induce SNAP participants to
change where they shop for FVs. A wider rollout in addition
would offer more opportunities for explicit marketing, pro-
motion, and nutritional education activities in concert with the
rebate. Such complementary strategies could lead to larger
impacts than the rebate alone (57). On the other hand, it is also
possible that increased promotion and marketing could have the
perverse effect of attenuating the impact on AFV intake by re-
ducing participant confusion around the eligibility of 100% fruit
juice to earn the rebate.
Our study is subject to several important limitations. First,
study participants included in the analysis differed on a range of
demographic characteristics from those initially sampled but
not included in the analysis. Although we used nonresponse
weighting to adjust analyses to account for observable differ-
ences, it is possible nonetheless that our analysis sample differed
from the broader Hampden County SNAP population in unob-
servable ways. Second, we did not continue to follow households
that were sampled at baseline but exited the SNAP program
before follow-up. Although an HIP/non-HIP balance was main-
tained over time, this attrition nonetheless may have influenced
our findings, e.g., if households less responsive to the rebate were
more likely to exit the SNAP. Third, because we did not fol-
low respondents after the intervention ended, we cannot assess
whether HIP effects were sustained after households ceased
receiving the HIP rebate. Fourth, because our intake estimates
relied on self-reported data, we cannot rule out the possibility that
Hawthorne effects were increasing self-reported consumption of
FVs in the HIP group. As reported in detail elsewhere (45),
observed EBT expenditures were lower than would be expected
based on the reported increase in intake. However, the AMPM
24-h recall method is considered to be the gold standard approach
for collecting data on dietary intake, and it is likely to be less
subject to this form of bias relative to simple food frequency
assessments. Fifth, our study was explicitly powered to enable the
detection of impacts on our confirmatory outcome, TFV intake in
the pooled sample. Although we report impacts on secondary
outcomes, statistical power for these outcomes was weaker; these
estimates were not adjusted formally for multiple comparisons,
and therefore should be considered exploratory. Finally, although
the RCT design boasts strong internal validity, it is not clear that
the results are externally generalizable, i.e., we cannot predict the
extent to which these results may apply in different settings or
populations.
In conclusion, financial incentives are a promising strategy for
increasing FV intake in the SNAP population. The estimated
impact was sufficiently large to close about one-fifth of the gap
between current and recommended amounts of FV intake, and
more than sufficient to close the entire gap in the dietary quality
of HIP participants as measured by the HEI-2010 relative to their
non-SNAP–participating peers. Citing the precedent of the HIP,
the USDA more recently has funded the Food Insecurity Nu-
trition Incentive grant program, which offers grants for programs
to increase FV consumption among SNAP participants through
point-of-purchase incentives (58). More research is needed on
mechanisms of action and potential long-term effects and health
outcomes.
We thank our USDA Food and Nutrition Service project officer, Danielle
Berman, for her guidance and support throughout the conduct of the Healthy
Incentives Pilot evaluation. The evaluation would not have been possible
without the support of the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assis-
tance, under the oversight of Frank Martinez Nocito, including Maryann
Carroll’s assistance with eligibility determination and sampling frame de-
velopment. Westat’s Suzanne McNutt and Crystal MacAllum led collec-
