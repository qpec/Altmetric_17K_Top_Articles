whilst intoxicated

Abstract
Background: A rank based social norms model predicts that drinkers’ judgements about their drinking will be
based on the rank of their breath alcohol level amongst that of others in the immediate environment, rather than
their actual breath alcohol level, with lower relative rank associated with greater feelings of safety. This study tested
this hypothesis and examined how people judge their levels of drunkenness and the health consequences of their
drinking whilst they are intoxicated in social drinking environments.
Methods: Breath alcohol testing of 1,862 people (mean age = 26.96 years; 61.86 % male) in drinking environments.
A subset (N = 400) also answered four questions asking about their perceptions of their drunkenness and the health
consequences of their drinking (plus background measures).
Results: Perceptions of drunkenness and the health consequences of drinking were regressed on: (a) breath
alcohol level, (b) the rank of the breath alcohol level amongst that of others in the same environment, and (c)
covariates. Only rank of breath alcohol level predicted perceptions: How drunk they felt (b 3.78, 95 % CI 1.69 5.87),
how extreme they regarded their drinking that night (b 3.7, 95 % CI 1.3 6.20), how at risk their long-term health was
due to their current level of drinking (b 4.1, 95 % CI 0.2 8.0) and how likely they felt they would experience liver
cirrhosis (b 4.8. 95 % CI 0.7 8.8). People were more influenced by more sober others than by more drunk others.
Conclusion: Whilst intoxicated and in drinking environments, people base judgements regarding their drinking on
how their level of intoxication ranks relative to that of others of the same gender around them, not on their actual
levels of intoxication. Thus, when in the company of others who are intoxicated, drinkers were found to be more
likely to underestimate their own level of drinking, drunkenness and associated risks. The implications of these
results, for example that increasing the numbers of sober people in night time environments could improve
subjective assessments of drunkenness, are discussed.

Background
Excessive alcohol consumption places drinkers’ health at
risk both in the long term and during the drinking episode
[1]. In the drinking episode intoxication can lead to risk tak-
ing behaviours such as unsafe sex, driving a motor vehicle
while intoxicated, criminal or social misdemeanors of vary-
ing levels of seriousness, and continuation of drinking until
ataxia, coma and even death occur [2, 3]. Mis-estimations
of the degree of personal intoxication may contribute to
such behaviours, leading a person to believe that they are
able to undertake a task safely when they are not, or to be-
lieve that they can continue drinking without becoming
dangerously intoxicated. Understanding how people judge
their drunkenness whilst intoxicated, how their current
state of intoxication impacts on their health, and how such
estimates can be systematically biased, is an important first
step towards designing environments and honing in-
terventions to reduce excessive drinking and drunken

However,
whilst
much
research
has
focused on how people evaluate the heaviness of their
drinking (e.g., [4–7]), this research is normally conducted
with participants whilst they are sober, and little is known
about how people evaluate their drunkenness whilst actu-
ally under the influence of alcohol and in a drinking envir-
onment. The importance of this becomes greater where
there are concentrations of drinkers, a phenomenon
which has increased in UK cities that have been focal
points for concentrated development of the night time en-
vironment, leading to a high density of licensed premises.
Whilst intoxicated, people might be assumed to judge
their levels of drunkenness based solely on how much
they have actually drunk. This intuitive “actual intoxica-
tion” approach is perhaps a partial motivation for calls
to increase the availability of information on the amount
of alcohol consumed, for example through mandatory
labeling of bottles with alcohol units [8].
We propose in contrast a rank based social norms
model, which we test in a sample of intoxicated individ-
uals through modeling the relationship between people’s
objective drunkenness (based on breath alcohol concen-
tration, BrAC, measured using an alcometer) and their
ratings of their drunkenness, as well as the relationship
between their BrAC and the attitudes they held at that
moment about the health consequences of their drinking.
Specifically we hypothesize that when drinking alcohol
amongst others people’s perception of their own level of
drunkenness is influenced by the perception of their level
of inebriation relative to others in their immediate vicinity.
Our focus is on social drinking and we make no reference
to alcohol consumption that occurs in isolation. The
“actual intoxication” approach neglects existing social
norms research which indicates that - at least whilst indi-
viduals are sober - people are highly influenced by their
perceptions of how their levels of drinking compare to
those of others within their reference groups (e.g., [4–7]).
Whilst this conclusion has been established for sober
individuals, the same may not hold for real world settings
(i.e., for intoxicated individuals in drinking environments).
First, it is not clear whether drinkers compare their
levels of intoxication to the actual levels of intoxication
of those in the same drinking environment, or to their
incorrect beliefs about the levels of intoxication of
others. Generally, social norms research has shown that
people have an inaccurate impression of how much others
drink - possibly being motivated by a desire to self-
enhance through seeing themselves as relative lower
drinkers - and that it is this inaccurate impression that af-
fects judgements of the heaviness of actual drinking [4, 7].
However such research, conducted with sober participants
in non-drinking environments requires participants to rely
on memory to make comparisons, and this involvement
of memory may lead to biased judgements about personal
drinking [9]. In contrast, people can actually observe the
intoxication levels of others whilst in drinking environ-
ments [10], providing opportunities for people to be more
influenced by the actual rather than remembered states of
others. The physical presence of others may reduce the
biasing effect of memory.
Second, it is also not clear whether: (a) comparisons to
others would bias the basic relationship between objective
and subjective drunkenness (such that subjective drunken-
ness would be predicted by both objective drunkenness and
social comparisons), or (b) the relationship between object-
ive and subjective drunkenness is wholly based on compari-
sons to others (such that when statistically controlling for
social comparisons there would no longer be a relationship
between objective and subjective drunkenness).
Third, the cognitive mechanisms through which people
compare their level of drinking to that of others are not
known. In making specific predictions for this study, we
were guided by independent research from psychophysics
which focuses on how people judge the magnitude of
stimuli (see [11]). Such research is directly relevant as it
concerns how people make subjective judgements (here,
drunkenness) based on objective magnitudes (here, object-
ive intoxication). Historically, such research has followed a
path of initially assuming that people are influenced by
the actual magnitude of the stimuli (here, actual intoxica-
tion, see [12]), subsequently assuming people are influ-
enced by how a stimulus differs from some measure of
central tendency (here, for example, how one’s intoxica-
tion differs from the average intoxication within the envir-
onment, [13]), and finally showing that people are only
sensitive to how a stimuli ranks within the environment
(here, how one’s drinking ranks within the immediate en-
vironment, see [11]). The rank hypothesis has been sup-
ported in a variety of other psychophysiological [14–16]
and social [17–21] domains. Such a perspective raises the
possibility that individuals in drinking environments may
base the estimates of the heaviness of their drinking
wholly on how their level of intoxication ranks relative to
that of others (rather than rank based comparisons
providing an
additive
bias).
Showing
that
common
mechanisms apply in different areas furthers the develop-
ment of a more unified and integrated psychology [22]
where the same cognitive mechanisms are shown to
operate across multiple domains.
Fourth, if people do compare themselves to others, it is
not clear whether their judgements of their own intoxica-
tion would be equally, more, or less influenced by people
who drink more than they do relative to those who drink
less. The alcohol and social norms literature suggests that
sober people have a tendency to over-estimate how much
others drink, this effect being consistent with a self-
enhancement bias motivated by a desire to see one’s
consumption as relatively lower (e.g., [4, 7]). This might
Moore et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:798

 suggest that people would be more influenced by those
who drink more than they do themselves. However, it is
again not clear that findings based on sober individuals in
classroom or home settings would generalize straightfor-
wardly to intoxicated individuals in real world environ-
ments. In such real world settings more sober people may
be more salient, leading to a greater relative comparison to
those who have drunk less. It is also not clear which com-
parisons a self-enhancement bias may predispose; when
sober people focus on general alcohol consumption it may
seem preferable to drink less, whereas whilst in a “party”
mood and intoxicated in a drinking environment it may
seem preferable to drink relatively more. Thus the very self-
enhancement biases that predispose comparisons to heavier
drinking people in sober environments may predispose
comparisons to lower level drinkers in real world ones.
In this study we examine for the first time how people
judge their drunkenness and the health consequences of
their drinking whilst they are intoxicated in social drinking
environments. The focus on health was motivated by
recent calls for more social norms research to focus on
perceptions of the health consequences of personal levels
of drinking in addition to simply perceptions of the heavi-
ness of drinking [9, 23]. Based on previous social norms
research we hypothesize that such judgements will be
influenced by how the individual compares themselves to
others. As such others are salient in this environment we
further hypothesize that people will be influenced by
how the individual’s intoxication ranks amongst the
actual levels of intoxication of others in the environ-
ment. Finally, based on independent research from
cognitive science [11, 12], we hypothesize that judge-
ments will be wholly based on how the individual’s
intoxication compares to others in the environment,
and that these comparisons will be rank based, arising
from the same cognitive mechanisms used to judge
psychophysical stimuli. We have developed no specific
hypothesis as to whether people will be more influ-
enced by those who are more or less intoxicated and
leave this test as exploratory.
Method
Participants and procedure
This research was a component of a larger twenty-four
month study [24], twelve months of which involved a
large scale street survey. The data collection reported
here was undertaken in busy night time environments
characterised by a high density of premises licensed for
the on-site sale and consumption of alcohol. Full project
details and instrument validation are published elsewhere
[10, 24, 25]. The study was scrutinised and approved by
the Cardiff Dental School Research Ethics Committee. The
survey involved two pairs of surveyors who approached
every seventh individual walking past designated sampling
landmarks (central locations through which a high volume
of pedestrians would pass). We estimate the median group
size was four [26] and therefore selection of every seventh
individual would mean we were less likely to consecutively
select individuals from the same social group. Individuals
were approached and asked to participate. Those who
consented breathed into alcometers, calibrated to ±3 μg
alcohol/100 ml breath, which recorded respondents’ ob-
jective BrAC. Participants were also asked what time they
began drinking alcohol that evening (from which session
duration was derived), and completed the Fast Alcohol
Screening Test (FAST) which is used to assess respon-
dents’ historical levels of risky alcohol consumption [27].
The sampling strategy attempted to ensure that a represen-
tative sample was approached and all those approached
were deemed eligible to participate unless they were at
work (e.g. police officers). Surveys were typically conducted
between 8 pm and 3 am on Friday and Saturday evenings.
Verbal consent to participate was requested from each
participant and all study participants were told that they
could stop participating at any time. In total, alcometer
reading, gender, and location information were recorded
for 1,862 people across four locations (63.2 % were male,
consistent with the gender composition of the areas sam-
pled [28]). These participants were part of the wider study
programme. In addition, 669 participants were invited to
answer additional questions specifically for the current
study. Five hundred and thirty four participants (80 %)
consented to participate and 477 completed the key four
questions (set out below). There were no significant
differences in BrAC between those who responded to all
four questions and those who completed three or fewer (t
< 0.1). Of these 477 participants, 39 did not provide gender
information and 38 did not answer the covariation ques-
tions (e.g., FAST test, time starting drinking etc.). This left
a usable study sample of 400 participants who completed
all relevant measures (representing a 60 % response rate
from those asked to participate).
Four questions were administered to assess perceived
drunkenness and potential health risks of the current levels
of drinking; (1) drunkenness (“how drunk are you right
now, on a 1 (totally sober) to 10 (completely drunk)
scale?”), (2) extreme drinking (“how extreme has your
drinking been tonight, on a 1 (not at all) to 10 (completely
extreme) scale?”), (3) risk to long-term health (“if you drank
as much as you have tonight every week how likely is it
that you will damage your health in the next 15 years, on a
1 (definitely will not) to 10 (definitely will) scale?”), and (4)
risk of liver cirrhosis (“if you drank as much as you have to-
night every week how likely is it that you will get cirrhosis
of the liver in the next 15 years, on a 1 (definitely will not)
to 10 (definitely will) scale?” . The key question used to test
the theory was the first, with the second used to replicate
the finding with alternate wording that stressed personal

 drunkenness as a function of that respondent’s history of
alcohol use. The third question assessed the subsidiary
question of how people judge the long term health risks
associated with their drinking whilst intoxicated, supported
by the fourth which aimed to show that the same results
can apply to assessment of risk on a specific as well as a
general health evaluation.
The study therefore made use of two sets of data. All
those from whom BrAC was recorded were used in the
ranking process. A subset of these participants also
completed the risk judgement questions and it was their
responses that were used to test hypotheses on the
relationship between rank (relative to the larger pool of
respondents) and judgements. Finally, our hypotheses
were specific to drinkers in the drinking environment.
Therefore respondents who yielded a BrAC of 0 μg/
100 ml were not eligible for inclusion in the rank-
judgement analyses, although they were included in the
larger pool from which rank was determined as they
were present in the same environment.
All aspects of the research presented here were scrutinised
and approved by the Medical and Dental Research Ethics
Committee, Cardiff University prior to data collection.
Analytic strategy
We tested whether participants’ judgements were pre-
dicted by BrAC rank within a reference group using estab-
lished statistical procedures developed for this purpose
elsewhere [9, 29]. Using the whole sample of 1,862 people,
we first created eight reference groups based on all
combinations of gender and the four locations, on the as-
sumption that these are the people with whom partici-
pants would compare. We included gender in the
definition of reference group given the considerable
differences in drinking style by gender [30]. On average,
the reference group size was 231.75 respondents (min =
142, max = 343). For each person within our study group
(N = 400), we next calculated a new variable for each
individual representing the rank of an individual’s BrAC
within the reference group through the formula;
Ri ¼ i−1
ð
Þ
n−1
ð
Þ
ð1Þ
where the number of respondents who yielded a BrAC
lower than that of the individual (i - 1) was compared
with the total number of people within that individual’s
reference group (n - 1) to provide a relative rank score
(Ri) normalised between 0 and 1. The primary test,
conducted separately for each of the four outcome
questions, involved simultaneously regressing outcome
on both BrAC and rank BrAC, including covariates.
These covariates critically included how the person’s
intoxication differed from the average intoxication of
those around them, in order to rule out this rival explan-
ation of how relative comparisons are made. Only rank
BrAC was hypothesised to predict each outcome.
Control variables
Several variables (which may have had a confounding
effect) were assessed for use as covariates in a planned
sensitivity analysis. Session duration might have an inde-
pendent effect with those who had been drinking longest
over-estimating the effects of alcohol through fatigue.
Also included was the time of survey which was reduced
to before and after 11 pm, a time that denotes a transi-
tion from drinking in regular pubs to nightclubs and so
distinguishes between early evening and late night
drinkers. Finally, FAST scores, which indicate patterns of
risky drinking [27, 31], were included as these capture
drinkers’ historical levels of harmful drinking.
Results
Descriptive data of participants’ responses on all measures
are presented in Table 1. Figure 1 is a histogram of all
respondents’ BrACs by gender, excluding those who did
not yield a positive BrAC. BrAC was normally distributed
for those who recorded a positive BrAC score, and ranged
from less than 19 μg/100 ml breath to >100 μg. The
average participant had drinking levels in excess of stand-
ard UK and US drink driving limits (35 μg/100 ml), with
10 % of the most intoxicated drinkers surveyed yielding an
average BrAC of 106.4 μg/100 ml (n = 183). On average,
participants saw themselves as moderately drunk and
moderately at risk (scoring 4.5 to 6.4 on the 10 point
scale). Men (mean BrAC = 52.3 μg/100 ml, SD = 30.0)
yielded higher alcometer scores than women (mean BrAC
= 43.0 μg/100 ml, SD = 27.8; t = 6.64, p < 0.001), and a
one-way ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of
location on BrAC (F(1, 1,860) = 44.0, p < 0.001). These
differences by gender and location indicate that there was
sufficient variation between the reference groups for rank

and

to
provide
meaningfully
different
measures. There was an association between rank BrAC
and BrAC (ρ = 0.95, p < 0.001). We therefore used the
variance inflation factor (VIF)
to assess collinearity
between the explanatory variables BrAC and Ri. The VIFi
is given by (1 – R2
i )-1 where R2
i is the R2 from regressing
the ith independent variable on all other independent
variables. The VIF shows how much the variance of the
coefficient estimate is being inflated by multicollinearity.
A VIFi >10 indicates harmful collinearity [32]. In this case
a VIF of 7.71 was observed.
Regression models were used to test hypotheses (see
Table 2), with separate models for perceived drunken-
ness, extreme drinking, general health risks, and risk of
cirrhosis of the liver. Model 1 shows that when the
perceptions were regressed only on BrAC, there was a ro-
bust positive association in each. Those who were more in-
toxicated believed their health was at greater risk. Model 2
similarly shows that when the perceptions were regressed
only on the rank of BrAC, there was again a positive associ-
ation. Those who were ranked more highly in terms of
intoxication believed their health was at greater risk. Model
1 explained less variance for all outcome measures than

yielded a BrAC greater than zero and were included in the
judgement analyses (N = 400)

 Model 2. The key test of the hypothesis is presented in
Model 3, where the perceptions are jointly regressed on
both BrAC and rank BrAC (controlling for the distance
between the person’s BrAC and the mean of the reference
group).
The
results
are
consistent
across
outcomes
measures: only rank retains a significant positive relation-
ship with outcomes. Taken together this suggests that when
intoxicated and in a drinking environment, people’s judge-
ments of their drunkenness (and the attendant health con-
sequences) are only influenced by the rank of their BrAC,
such that a lower relative rank corresponds with an under-
appreciation of their level of intoxication. Any apparent
zero-order relationship between BrAC and the judgements
is apparently due to BrAC acting as a proxy for rank BrAC,
as controlling for the latter removes the relationship. Model
4 presents a sensitivity analysis, repeating the tests in Model
3 whilst adjusting the exposure-outcome effect estimate for
potential confounds (duration of drinking, time of assess-
ment, gender, age, and FAST scores). The results remained
the same whilst controlling for these variables.
To test whether people were more influenced by those
who ranked above or below them, the regressions in
Model 2 were re-run but with the rank amongst the

through Eq. 2 it is possible to find the value of η that ex-
plains any variance in the outcome variables (perceived risk
and intoxication) best; η > 1 indicates an upward bias and
that drinkers are more influenced by more intoxicated
drinkers whereas η < 1 indicates a downward bias and that
respondents are more influenced by more sober drinkers
[33]. To determine the value of η an iterative process was
used in which values of η from 0.01 to 5 in 0.01 steps were
regressed onto outcomes. The value of η yielding the great-
est R2 value was then selected for each outcome. For all
judgements respondents were more influenced by those
who were more sober: perceived drunkenness η = 0.70, ex-
treme drinking η = 0.14, long-term health η = 0.17 and liver
cirrhosis η = 0.21. In other words introducing sober people
into a drinking environment would be predicted to have
greater impact on judgements, making people feel more at
risk and more intoxicated, compared to the effect on
decreasing feelings of riskiness one might expect if very in-
toxicated people were introduced into the environment. It
appears that drinkers are more self-aware of their own level
of intoxication when in the presence of those who are sober.
Discussion
The study sheds new light on how people judge their
drunkenness and the health consequences of their
drinking whilst actually intoxicated in real world drinking
environments. In such situations the relationship between
actual intoxication and drinking perceptions was accounted
for by how the person’s consumptions ranked amongst
others. Thus, using the same cognitive processes as used in
other psychophysical judgements, perceptions of one’s
intoxication appear to arise from comparison to others.
People are also more influenced by those who are more
sober than them, relative to those who are more intoxicated.
The research builds on previous social norms work by
indicating that people’s judgements of their alcohol use
depend on their perception of how intoxicated other
people are. The study expands on knowledge by: (a)
extending the social norms perspective to judgements
made whilst intoxicated in drinking environments; (b)
showing that in such settings people are influenced by
the actual rather than imagined behaviour of others; (c)
showing that in this context people are more influenced
by those who drink less (whilst in social norms research
using sober subjects, people tend to underestimate their
relative drinking, suggesting a greater focus on those who
drink more); and (c) consistent with one other paper [9],
suggesting that when comparing to others, people are
influenced by the rank position relative to others.
The finding that people are specifically sensitive to
rank position suggests that a basic evolutionary mechan-
ism may be implicated. Animals, ranging from crayfish
to monkeys, are generally very sensitive to rank position
within a hierarchy [34], and in the clinical literature
there is increasing realisation that mental disorders may
partially arise from a mis-regulation of mechanisms that
were adaptive in the evolutionary past [35]. Specifically,
whilst high sensitivity to rank position (including hyper-
vigilance, lower appetite, reduced sexual behaviour, and
general withdrawal amongst those of low rank) would
have conferred a survival advantage in the evolutionary
past, such hard wired tendencies may influence people
in negative ways in modern society [36–39]. On the
basis of the results described here, we suggest that an in-
built sensitivity to rank position amongst others can
maladaptively lead people to assume they are less drunk
and at risk than they actually are if they rank low
amongst other drinkers. Such rank sensitivity may also
explain why drinking increases in a society; if everyone
drank another 10 units per week, no one would believe
themselves to be at more at risk of alcohol related
disorder as their rank positions would remain the same.
Future research could usefully examine whether this
rank sensitivity can be harnessed through intervention;
asking whether, for example, telling people how they
rank amongst a broader reference population (e.g., “you
are in the top 5 % of drinkers”) would decrease drinking
more than the dominant social norms intervention
approach of telling people how much more they drink

 than the average or typical person. Consistently, the
“nudge” [40] approach of behavioural economics suggests
that greater behavioural change occurs when information
is presented in line with people’s natural ways of process-
ing information. Given that people are influenced by more
sober others, a further “nudge” maybe achievable by
increasing the mix of consumers in drinking environ-
ments, incentivising the presence of more sober people,
for example through soft drink pricing, or by attracting a
more diverse population of entertainment seekers, or by
introducing a range of ‘capable guardians’ such as street
pastors, taxi marshalls and city ambassadors who, in
addition to their formal roles, would also act as sober
comparators with which at risk drinkers would compare
themselves. More research is needed here since research
on behavioural strategies to reducing misuse at the point
of sale is very limited [25]. However, it is clear from the
findings of the present study that alcohol harm reduction
strategy should capitalise on knowledge that people in
drinking environments make decisions to drink more on
the basis of their observation of people around them.
All studies that study alcohol use in context face nu-
merous difficulties, challenges and are therefore limited.
This is usually offset by the considerable advantages of
studying behaviour in situ. Never-the-less, this paper
has several limitations. First, the operationalization of a
social network here assumes those in the same environ-
ment who are consuming alcohol influence one another.
This may not be consistent with the generic social net-
work approach, in as far that many of those in this study
probably have no social relationship. However, those
surveyed will have been aware of other people’s pres-
ence at least visually. Given the marked effect of alcohol
on appearance, such as alcohol-related ataxia, visual
cues will play an important role in the formation of
judgements. This does warrant further investigation and
studies might consider the ecology of influences from
immediate social groups through to those in the same
venue and environment. Furthermore, the measure for
rank intoxication could potentially be subject to less
measurement error than the more objective BrAC and
this is a concern when measures are correlated [41], as
is the case here. However, theoretically the expectation
that rank outperforms absolute measures is robust [11,
12, 15, 16] and in areas where measurement area is
less likely a factor (such as large scale comparisons
between rank income and absolute income in predict-
ing well-being [29]) rank performs similarly. We are
therefore confident that the effects reported here are
genuine. Nevertheless, the matter warrants further at-
tention
and
research
could
partially
address
this
through manipulating the context in which measures
are taken such that the expectation is that rank would
systematically vary.
Conclusion
While this paper is primarily interested in the manner in
which context, or the reference set comprised of other
drinkers, informs judgements of being at risk from alco-
hol consumption, there are obvious links with the trad-
itional
literature
on
perceptions
of
intoxication
generally. For example, self-rated intoxication becomes
less accurate as the level of intoxication increases [42].
Certainly the factors that govern drinkers’ choices re-
garding further alcohol consumption are many and
intertwine in complex ways; possibly only a few are
amenable to intervention. The environment is one factor
that is modifiable and it is encouraging to note that
changes in licensed premises density correspond with
changes in the prevalence of outcomes, such as violence
and excessive alcohol consumption, that are related to
both alcohol and poor decision making [43]. A high
density of licensed premises would mean fewer alterna-
tive venues that do not sell alcohol and therefore a
greater density of drinkers in those environments. A
logical next step is therefore to consider the distribution
of drinkers in environments varying by premises density
as a potential feature that links alcohol use with exces-
sive consumption and harm.
