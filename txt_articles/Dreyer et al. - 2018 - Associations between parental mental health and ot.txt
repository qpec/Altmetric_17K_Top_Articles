Objective To identify the degree to which parental 
diagnosis of depression or other long-term conditions, 
parental health-seeking behaviours and household factors 
were associated with a healthcare utilisation among 
children and young people (CYP) (0–15 years).
Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study of electronic 
health records, from 25 252 patients registered at a large, 
London-based primary care provider. The associations 
between children’s healthcare utilisation and the 
characteristics of the child, their parents/carers and their 
household structure were examined using multivariable 
regression.
results Controlling for parental utilisation, parental 
depression (vs not) was significantly associated with 
increased healthcare utilisation for CYP. Odds ratios for CYP 
with siblings=1.41 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.80) for emergency 
department (ED) attendances, 1.67 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.11) 
for outpatient appointments, 1.47 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.03) 
for inpatient admission, and rate rato=1.28 (95% CI 1.04 
to 1.78) for general practitioner (GP) consultations. After 
adjusting for child and parental characteristics, parental 
general practice attendance (+1 from mean) was 
predictive of increased CYP general practice attendance, 
rate ratio 1.07 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.08) for CYP with siblings. 
Parental ED attendance also increased the risk of CYP ED 
attendance, with OR 1.27 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.44) for CYP 
with siblings.
Conclusions Parental depression is associated with 
increased utilisation of ED, outpatient and inpatient 
services by CYP, as well as with increased GP consultations 
among adolescents. Our results demonstrate that 
healthcare utilisation by CYP is associated with the health-
seeking behaviour of adults in their household.
IntrODuCtIOn
The rising rates of emergency department 
attendance and inpatient admissions in chil-
dren and young people in England1 are of 
concern to clinicians and policy makers. 
While much emergency and inpatient care 
is often an appropriate form of treatment, 
increasing rates of care in an acute setting 
results in high and potentially avoidable 
spending. There are also wider opportunity 
costs, such as scarce skilled paediatric staff 
being based in hospitals delivering acute care, 
rather than in community settings delivering 
preventive care and health promotion.
Numerous studies have shown that interven-
tions and new models of care have significant 
potential to reduce demand for emergency 
department attendance.2–6 However, it has 
proved difficult to realise these reductions in 
practice, which may reflect lack of research 
What is already known on this topic?
 
► An association between parental self-reported 
healthcare utilisation and parent-reported patterns 
of child utilisation has been demonstrated us-
ing survey data and self-reported health and care 
information.
 
► No existing studies examine the association between 
child healthcare utilisation and parental health, 
 
accounting for the adults and siblings within a 
household and their underlying healthcare usage 
patterns.
What this study hopes to add?
 
► After adjusting for child and parental charac-
teristics, parental depression is associated with 
41% increased odds of emergency department 
(ED) attendance, 47% increased odds of inpatient 
 
admission and 67% increased odds of outpatient 
 
appointments in children and young people (CYP).
 
► After controlling for other factors, parental utilisation 
of general practice appointments and ED attendance 
increase the risk of children and young people’s util-
isation of these services.

or interventions to address wider determinants of health-
care seeking behaviour among children.
While there has been extensive research into the role 
that health inequalities play in healthcare activity7 8 and 
into system-level factors that influence emergency admis-
sions,4 9 there has been little consideration as to the 
influence that family context might play on the health-
care utilisation of children. There is some evidence that 
family context may have an important role influencing 
the healthcare utilisation and needs of their children, 
through the availability of knowledge, skills, social 
support10–12 and health-seeking behaviour and prefer-
ences.13 Poor parental mental health is associated with 
negative health outcomes for children,14 and parental 
anxiety is a contributing factor to a child’s utilisation of 
healthcare services.15 Furthermore, shared genetic risks 
and the wider social determinants in the household16 
could account for a clustering of health behaviours in 
households. However, there has been surprisingly little 
focus on family context and the role this plays on child 
healthcare activity.
A large portion of the evidence regarding the impact of 
parental health on children’s healthcare utilisation comes 
from small, retrospective studies, relying on self-reported 
health and care information,17–19 and survey data where 
parents report their previous healthcare utilisation.20–22 
Few studies have used person-level data from electronic 
health records in primary care. Previous studies failed 
to account for all aspects of parental health, with some 
focusing on specific long-term conditions10 19 23 or only 
examining one parent.10 21 Furthermore, there is limited 
evidence from countries with healthcare systems that are 
free at the point of use and offer universal coverage, as 
most analyses originate from the insurance-based US 
system.13 18 19 21 23 
In this paper, we analyse electronic health records from 
25 252 patients registered at a primary care provider in 
London. We created household groups by identifying 
patients living at the same address, and then modelled 
the impact of parental healthcare utilisation and long-
term conditions on four types of children’s healthcare 
utilisation (general practice appointments, emergency 
department attendance, inpatient admissions and outpa-
tient appointments), controlling for child, parental and 
household characteristics.
MethODs
study setting, dataset, inclusion and exclusion criteria
Our dataset contained electronic health records from 
25 252 patients registered (as of September 2015) at a 
multisite general practice, in the borough of Greenwich, 
South East London. The records included patient demo-
graphic information, previous long-term condition diag-
noses, a neighbourhood indicator and a unique house-
hold identifier. Long-term conditions were identified 
from the general practitioner (GP) record using Quality 
and Outcomes Framework (QOF) read codes; these 
included arterial fibrillation, asthma, cancer, chronic 
heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, dementia, depression and/or 
anxiety, diabetes, epilepsy, heart failure, hypertension, 
a learning disability, a mental health condition (schizo-
phrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses), 
osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, peripheral artery disease, 
palliative care, rheumatoid arthritis and stroke or tran-
sient ischaemic attack.24
Full details of the date and type of general prac-
tice appointments were available. Utilisation counts of 
secondary care services (emergency department atten-
dances, inpatient admissions and outpatient appoint-
ments) were also available; these secondary care data 
were reported to the general practice by secondary 
care providers, and then recorded on patient electronic 
health records by well-trained coders.
We extracted information on the healthcare util-
isation of all patients from 22 September 2015 to 21 
September 2016. Patients living at the same address 
were identified using the unique household identi-
fier. We defined ‘children and young people’ (CYP) 
as patients under the age of 16 years, and ‘parents’ as 
patients aged 18–55 years. Our cohort of interest were 
all children and parents in households with at least one 
‘CYP’ and one ‘parent’ where a ‘parent’ is any parent, 
carer or adult living in the household. Patients aged 16 
and 17 years were excluded from this analysis. Further-
more, any person living at the same address that was 
not registered at the general practice was not included 
in this analysis.
Outcomes
Four different outcomes were investigated relating to 
CYP’s utilisation of healthcare services in primary and 
secondary care over the year: the number of general 
practice appointments, and any emergency depart-
ment attendance, inpatient admission and outpatient 
appointment.
Covariates
The observed CYP characteristics were age, sex, socio-
economic deprivation and diagnosis of any long-term 
conditions using Quality and Outcomes Framework 
(QOF) read codes. We categorised age into three 
groups: ‘0–5’, ‘6–10’ and ‘11–15’. To determine a CYP’s 
socioeconomic status, we used the neighbourhood 
indicator associated with their household’s address and 
ranked the 2010 index of multiple deprivation scores to 
produce five quintiles (with 1 being the most deprived 
and 5 the least). An indicator variable was used to show 
whether a CYP had any long-term conditions present 
on their electronic health record, which were assigned 
from clinical notes by clinical coders at the practice.
Parental characteristics were mean age, mean count 
of healthcare utilisation and presence of long-term 
conditions; these variables were all calculated at the 
household level, using information from all parents.

Open access
To avoid data sparsity issues, only common long-term 
conditions which were present in the parents of at least 
50 CYP were reported on and used in our model. For 
each CYP healthcare utilisation outcome modelled, the 
appropriate mean parental healthcare utilisation vari-
able was included in the model.
Household characteristics included the number of 
adults aged 18–55 years (‘1’ or ‘2+’), the number of 
CYP aged 0–15 years, the presence of any patient aged 
65 years and over and the total number of patients in 
the household.
statistical methods
Adjusting for CYP characteristics, parental long-term 
conditions and mean parental healthcare utilisation, 
we used multivariable generalised linear models25 to 
examine the association between CYP healthcare utili-
sation and the characteristics of the CYP, their parents 
and their household structure, including clustering of 
behaviour among CYP with siblings.26 27 Rate and Odds 
Ratios (ORs) were produced to interpret the results. 
Further details on statistical methods used can be 
found in online supplementary appendix 1.
subgroup analysis
To examine the different effects of the covariates across 
different age groups, a subgroup analysis was performed. 
The model was run on three different subgroups of CYP, 
the first only included those aged 5 years or younger, 
the second only included those between aged 6 and 
10 years and the third included those aged between 11 
and 15 years.
sensitivity analysis
We performed two sensitivity analyses. The first restricted 
our analysis to examining the impact of characteristics of 
female adults in the household, in order to see whether 
maternal rather than parental health has different associ-
ations with CYP health. Finally, we increased the thresh-
olds for our secondary care outcomes to at least two 
instances of use to determine whether the model is robust 
at higher levels of utilisation and to determine whether 
there were any notable changes (including statistically 
significant changes) in the results.
ethics statement
Routinely collected, retrospective, pseudonymised data 
were used for this analysis, with a data sharing agreement 
approved by the Valentine Health data holders. Data 
were analysed as part of an audit and quality improve-
ment initiative with Valentine Health. No furthers ethics 
approval was required.
results
There were 6738 CYP (aged 0–15 years) in the dataset; 
614 did not live with an adult (aged 18–55 years) leaving 
6124 CYP in our analysis cohort living in 3373 house-
holds. Where a CYP was identified as living with no adult, 
based on the opinion of the practice staff, we assumed 
the adults were registered at other practices. Forty-one 
per cent (2485) of the CYP lived in households with one 
potential parent, 41% (2503) with two and 19% (1136) 
with three or more adults between 18 and 55. Seventy-four 
per cent (4519) CYP had siblings and 26% (1605) CYP 
did not. The most common parental long-term condition 
was depression (depression and/or anxiety), with 16% 
(980) of CYP having a diagnosed parent (see table 1).
A full description of the characteristics of the CYP 
cohort is provided in supplementary appendix 2–4. Seven-
ty-four per cent (4510) of CYP had at least one general 
practice appointment, and the mean number of appoint-
ments was 2.7 (SD 3.3). In the study year, 20% (1203) 
of CYP had an emergency department attendance, 9% 
(562) an inpatient admission and 18% (1114) an outpa-
tient appointment (see online supplementary appendix 
3). Six per cent (395) of CYP had at least one long-term 
condition (see online supplementary appendix 3).
Characteristics for children with siblings are not notably 
different to characteristics of children without siblings, 
and results from modelling CYP with siblings and CYP 
without siblings were consistent. For the purposes of 
brevity, only results for CYP with siblings are reported on 
here, but results for CYP without siblings are available as 
supplementary material. The best fitting models for each 
outcome of interest, including inpatient admissions and 
outpatient appointments, are given in online supplemen-
tary appendix 5.
When controlling for the characteristics of CYP only 
(model 1), we found that being older and not having any 
long-term condition diagnoses was significantly associ-
ated with reduced utilisation of all four types of healthcare 
(p<0.01) (see tables 2 and 3, and online supplementary 
appendix 6).
Controlling for other CYP and parental characteristics 
(model 2), parental healthcare utilisation was associated 
with increased CYP healthcare utilisation across all four 
healthcare services: general practice rate ratio: 1.07 (95% 
CI 1.06 to 1.08); emergency department attendance OR: 
1.27 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.44); inpatient admission OR: 1.43 
(95% CI 1.06 to 1.93); and outpatient attendance OR: 
1.08 (95% CI 101 to 1.15). For example, a one point 
increase in parental emergency department utilisation is 
associated with a 27% increased odds of child emergency 
department attendance. Parental depression (vs not) was 
positively associated for all secondary care utilisation, with 
OR for emergency department attendance 1.41 (95% CI 
1.10 to 1.80), inpatient admissions 1.47 (95% CI 1.07 to 
2.03) and outpatient appointments 1.67 (95% CI 1.32 to 
2.11). A parental diagnosis of osteoarthritis was positively 
associated with increased attendance at general practice, 
rate ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.52) (see tables 2 and 
3, and online supplementary appendix 7).
In CYP aged 11–15 years, the association between 
parental depression and general practice utilisation 
was significant and stronger than in the younger age 
groups (rate ratio: 1.28 (96% CI 1.04 to 1.57)). A similar

trend can be seen in outpatient utilisation with OR 2.13 
(95% CI 1.38 to 3.27) for children aged 11–15 years 
(see online supplementary appendix 7). Although not 
significant, the same trend can be seen for emergency 
department attendances. The association between osteo-
arthritis and general practice appointments was consis-
tent with the main results; however, the subgroup analysis 
did not inform any specific trends as the sample size of 
the subgroup by age was too small. Further research is 
needed to understand what is driving the association 
between osteoarthritis and general practice utilisation. 
Samples size was too small to conduct a subgroup analysis 
for CYP without siblings.
Our findings from the sensitivity analyses, which 
included restricting parental characteristics to maternal 
characteristics only, and increasing the thresholds for our 
secondary care outcomes, were consistent with our main 
results (see supplementary appendix 8 and 9).
DIsCussIOn
Parental depression was associated with a statistically 
significant increase in secondary care utilisation. We also 
found that parental and CYP healthcare utilisation were 
associated in both primary and secondary care.
The mechanism behind this association is complex, 
bidirectional and likely to be a combination of factors, 
including increased parental perception of vulnerability 
of the CYP, recognising a need for medical support from 
the health system,10 a lack of social support28 and under-
lying patterns of parental behaviour.13 For example, 
parental anxiety is well recognised as a contributing 
factor in healthcare-seeking behaviour, especially for 
young children.15 However, parental depression may also 
be a consequence of prolonged illness in a child. For 
parents with depression, our findings highlight the wider 
impact mental health conditions have on outcomes for 
families and paediatric care and the potential benefits to 
those suffering from depression from proposed increased 
investment in mental health services.29
To our knowledge, there have only been two studies 
examining the general healthcare utilisation of CYP in 
relation to their parents in the National Health Service; 
one of which was quantitative which found that living 
with an adult with a mental health condition was associ-
ated with a 17% increase in emergency admissions.30 31 
Our results are consistent with findings from previous 
international studies, with one paper finding that 
parental depression was associated with between a 15%

and 35% increase in emergency department attendances 
for children.10 23 In contrast, studies that examined both 
parental healthcare utilisation and self-reported measures 
of parental health have found that parental health is not 
associated with child healthcare utilisation.13 21 32
This study has a number of strengths. We analysed the 
electronic health records of all registered patients at a 
large general practice and did not rely on self-reported 
healthcare utilisation. As the practice provides care to all 
residents in the local area and is free at the point of use, 
it provides a unique insight into family and community 
structures within its catchment area. The completeness of 
our sample means that we were properly able to account 
for those registered with the practice and accurately 
include parental diagnoses of long-term conditions, as 
well as accurately account for healthcare utilisation. We 
also benefited from being able to analyse all children in 
a household at the same time, taking account of clus-
tering at the household level in order to more accurately 
examine the impact of parental health.
A number of limitations of this study should be noted. 
Patients are all registered at, and live in the proximity of, 
one general practice in South East London, and there 
may be area-level effects or specific policies at this general 
practice that influence patient behaviour. As a result, this 
cohort may not be representative of the general popula-
tion. This impacts the generalisability of these results to 
other areas across the country. The sample size limited our 
ability to perform subgroup and sensitivity analyses and 
to detect significance of parental conditions in models of 
families with no siblings. We classified all patients living at 
a single address as families and as being either a parent 
or a child; however, there may be multiple families at a 
single address or unrelated people that are included in 
the analysis. The number of parental long-term conditions 
across households is low due to the sample size, which 
reduces the power of our models. As a result, conditions, 
which may be significant in predicting healthcare utilisa-
tion in CYP, may not be identified. Secondary care data 
were reported to the general practice by secondary care 
providers; there is a risk that some secondary care utili-
sation is unreported. Furthermore, although the dataset 
was comprehensive, there are several factors that were not 
available, including social support, either through grand-
parents or other family living in the area but not living in 
the household or through more formal structures. Each of 
these factors may influence both healthcare utilisation and 
children’s health outcomes. Finally, we were only aware of 
patients registered at the practice, so our households may 
be missing people who live there that are not registered or

are registered at another practice. While we would expect 
all CYP to be registered at a general practice, and CYP in 
the same household to be registered at the same practice as 
their parents, we could be missing parents, especially those 
with no long-term conditions or healthcare utilisation and 
families with parental disharmony where parents live in 
different areas.
Our research demonstrates the utility of the house-
hold linkage and its clinical relevance; further research is 
needed on a fully linked dataset across the health economy, 
which also contained information on household structure 
(including but not limited to a maternal link).
Parental long-term conditions are a predictor of CYP 
utilisation of secondary healthcare services, in partic-
ular parental depression is a predictor of emergency 
admissions for CYP. The results presented in this paper 
suggest that a holistic assessment of family needs, partic-
ularly parental mental health and social support, may 
be an effective approach to improving the health and 
well-being of CYP. A number of studies have provided 
evidence of the benefits of integrated care on meeting 
patient needs and managing the demand for health-
care services.6 33 34 Innovative models of integrated 
care, such as Connecting Care for Children,33 may be 
able to facilitate family appointments that allow for an 
authoritative diagnosis or reassurance about the child’s 
medical needs, while taking account of parental health 
and family needs. Strong primary and social care provi-
sion for a whole family could provide efficacious and 
efficient care, increasing equity in health outcomes for 
children.
