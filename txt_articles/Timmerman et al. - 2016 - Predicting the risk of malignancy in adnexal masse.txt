Abstract   
 
Background – Accurate methods to preoperatively characterize adnexal tumors are 
pivotal for optimal patient management. A recent meta-analysis concluded that the 
International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) algorithms such as the Simple Rules 
are the best approaches to preoperatively classify adnexal masses as benign or 
malignant. 
Objective - To develop and validate a model to predict the risk of malignancy in 
adnexal masses using the ultrasound features in the Simple Rules. 
Study Design – International cross-sectional cohort study involving 22 oncology 
centers, referral centers for ultrasonography, and general hospitals. We included 
consecutive patients with an adnexal tumor who underwent a standardized 
transvaginal ultrasound examination and were selected for surgery. Data on 5020 
patients were recorded in three phases between 2002 and 2012. The five Simple 
Rules features indicative of a benign tumor (B-features) and the five features 
indicative of malignancy (M-features) are based on the presence of ascites, tumor 
morphology, and degree of vascularity at ultrasonography. Gold standard was the 
histopathologic diagnosis of the adnexal mass (pathologist blinded to ultrasound 
findings). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of malignancy 
based on the ten ultrasound features and type of center. The diagnostic performance 
was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-), positive and 
negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and calibration curves.

Results – Data on 4848 patients were analyzed. The malignancy rate was 43% 
(1402/3263) in oncology centers and 17% (263/1585) in other centers. The AUC on 
validation data was very similar in oncology centers (0.917, 95% CI 0.901 to 0.931) 
and other centers (0.916, 95% CI 0.873 to 0.945). Risk estimates showed good 
calibration. 23% of patients in the validation data set had a very low estimated risk 
(<1%), 48% had a high estimated risk (≥30%). For the 1% risk cutoff, sensitivity was 
99.7%, specificity 33.7%, LR+ 1.5, LR- 0.010, PPV 44.8% and NPV 98.9%. For the 
30% risk cutoff, sensitivity was 89.0%, specificity 84.7%, LR+ 5.8, LR- 0.13, PPV 
75.4% and NPV 93.9%. 
Conclusion – Quantification of the risk of malignancy based on the Simple Rules has 
good diagnostic performance both in oncology centers and other centers. A simple 
classification based on these risk estimates may form the basis of a clinical 
management system. Patients with a high risk may benefit from surgery by a 
gynecological oncologist, while patients with a lower risk may be managed locally.

Introduction 
 
Ovarian cancer is a common and lethal disease for which early detection and 
treatment in high volume centers and by specialized clinicians is known to improve 
survival.1–4 Hence, accurate methods to preoperatively characterize the nature of an 
ovarian tumor are pivotal. In 2008 the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) 
group described the Simple Rules.5 These are based on a set of five ultrasound 
features indicative of a benign tumor (B-features) and five ultrasound features 
indicative of a malignant tumor (M-features). When using the Simple Rules, tumors 
are classified as benign if only B-features are observed and as malignant if only M-
features are observed. If no features are observed or if conflicting features are 
present, the Simple Rules cannot classify the tumor as benign or malignant 
(inconclusive results). Masses in which the Simple Rules yield an inconclusive result 
can be classified using subjective assessment by an experienced ultrasound 
operator, or given the high prevalence of malignancy in this group they can all be 
classified as malignant to increase the sensitivity for ovarian cancer.6 On prospective 
validation both by the IOTA group (two studies including 1938 and 2403 patients, 
respectively)7,8 and by other research teams (nine studies including a total of 2101 
tumors)9–17, the Simple Rules were applicable in 77 to 94% of tumors (range between 
studies). The malignancy rate ranged from 1% to 9% in cases classified as benign, 
from 69% to 94% in cases classified as malignant, and from 13% to 53% in 
inconclusive cases. In a meta-analysis comparing the ability of 19 methods to 
discriminate between benign and malignant adnexal masses before surgery, the 
Simple Rules had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 81% when classifying 
inconclusive tumors as malignant.18 In the meta-analysis the Simple Rules and the

IOTA logistic regression model LR219 were superior to all other methods.  This 
suggests that evidence-based approaches to the preoperative characterization of 
adnexal masses should incorporate the use of Simple Rules or the LR2 model. LR2 
is a mathematical risk prediction model based on age and five ultrasound variables 
(presence of blood flow in a papillary structure, irregular cyst walls, ascites, acoustic 
shadows and maximum diameter of the largest solid component).  
The Simple Rules have been well-received by clinicians, and the Royal College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the United Kingdom have included the Simple 
Rules in their Green Top guideline on the assessment and management of ovarian 
masses in premenopausal women.20 
Despite a combination of simplicity and excellent performance, important limitations 
of the Simple Rules are the inconclusive results in a proportion of cases and the 
absence of an estimated risk of malignancy. The ability to provide accurate risk 
estimates is highly relevant for risk stratification and individualized patient 
management. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a model to 
calculate the risk of malignancy in adnexal masses based on the ten ultrasound 
features in the Simple Rules.

Materials and Methods 
 
Study design and setting 
This international multicenter cross-sectional cohort study involves patients from 22 
centers (oncology centers and other hospitals, Table 1) with at least one adnexal 
(ovarian, para-ovarian, or tubal) tumor selected for surgery by the managing clinician. 
Exclusion criteria were (1) pregnancy at the time of examination, (2) refusal of 
transvaginal ultrasonography, (3) declining participation, and (4) surgical intervention 
more than 120 days after the ultrasound examination. Data collection was carried out 
within the framework of the IOTA collaboration. The primary aim of the IOTA studies 
is to develop and validate methods for making a correct diagnosis in adnexal tumors 
prior to surgery. This aim is pursued by prospectively examining a large number of 
patients with ultrasound using a standardized examination technique and 
standardized terms and definitions to describe ultrasound findings.21 Through 
consecutive phases, data were collected from 24 centers in ten countries. In phase 1 
data were collected between 1999 and 2002, in phase 1b between 2002 and 2005, in 
phase 2 between 2005 and 2007, and in phase 3 between 2009 and 2012. Data from 
phase 1 were used to develop the Simple Rules and were therefore not used in the 
present study. The research protocols were approved by the Ethics Committees in 
each contributing center.

each patient to collect clinical information. All patients underwent a standardized 
transvaginal ultrasound examination by a principal investigator, who was a 
gynecologist or radiologist with extensive experience in gynecological ultrasound and 
with a special interest in adnexal masses. Transabdominal sonography was added in 
women with large masses that could not be visualized completely by the transvaginal 
approach. For women with multiple masses, the dominant mass was selected for 
statistical analysis.8,19,21–24 To apply the Simple Rules, information on the following 
variables is required: the diameters of the lesion (mm), the diameters of the largest 
solid component (mm), type of tumor (unilocular, unilocular-solid, multilocular, 
multilocular-solid, solid), presence of wall irregularity, ascites, acoustic shadows, 
number of papillary structures, and the color score, the latter reflecting 
vascularization on Doppler ultrasound (1, no flow; 2, minimal flow; 3, moderate flow; 
4, very strong flow). Detailed information can be found in previous reports.8,19,21–24 
The five B-features and the five M-features were not directly recorded, but were 
derived from the variables described above. 
 
Reference standard 
The reference standard denotes whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on 
the histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor following surgical removal. Surgery was 
performed through laparoscopy or laparotomy, as considered appropriate by the 
surgeon. Excised tumor tissues were histologically examined at the local center. 
Histological classification was performed without knowledge of the ultrasound results. 
Borderline tumors were classified as malignant.

Statistical analysis 
Using the IOTA data from phases 1b and 2, we estimated the risk of malignancy by 
quantifying the predictive value of each of the ten features of the Simple Rules and of 
the type of center in which the patients underwent an ultrasound examination 
(oncology center vs. other hospital; the definition of oncology center being tertiary 
referral center with a specific gynecological oncology unit). The predictive values for 
malignancy were determined by the regression coefficients estimated by 
multivariable logistic regression. Interaction terms were not considered. The analysis 
included a random intercept to account for variability between centers.25 
The risk estimates were externally validated on IOTA phase 3 data. The area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and 
predictive values were calculated through a meta-analysis of center-specific results26, 
similar to a previous validation study using phase 3 data.8 Positive and negative 
likelihood ratios were derived from these results. The risk cut-offs considered to 
classify a mass as malignant were 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%. 
Calibration plots were constructed to assess the relationship between calculated risks 
and observed proportions.25,27  
After external validation, the risk calculation was updated using the same procedure 
but now using all available data (phases 1b, 2, and 3) to fully exploit all available 
information.

Results 
 
During IOTA phases 1b, 2 and 3, data on 5020 patients were recorded at 22 centers 
(two centers from IOTA phase 1 did not take part in later phases). Data on 172 
patients were excluded either because the patients fulfilled an exclusion criterion 
(n=124; 43 women were pregnant and 81 women were operated on more than 120 
days after the ultrasound examination), or because of data errors or 
uncertain/missing final histology (n=47) or protocol violation (n=1). This leaves data 
on 4848 patients (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3). The development set (phases 1b 
and 2) contains data on 2445 patients recruited at 11 oncology centers (n=1548) and 
eight other centers (n=897). The temporal validation set (phase 3) contains data on 
2403 patients recruited at 11 oncology centers (n=1715) and seven other centers 
(n=688).  
The malignancy rate was 34% (1665/4848) overall, 43% (1402/3263) in oncology 
centers and 17% (263/1585) in other centers. The observed malignancy rate varied 
between 22% and 66% at oncology centers and between 0% and 30% at other 
centers. The median age was 42 years (interquartile range 32 to 54) for patients with 
a benign tumor and 57 years (47-66) for patients with a malignant tumor. All 80 
observed combinations of the ultrasound features in the Simple Rules are listed in 
Table 4. For the same combination of features, the observed malignancy rate was 
usually higher in oncology centers than in other centers.

The coefficients of the regression analysis for the development data are presented in 
Table 5. B-features were allocated negative coefficients, and hence decrease the 
estimated risk of malignancy. M-features were given positive coefficients. Ultrasound 
examination in oncology centers was assigned a positive coefficient. The AUC of the 
risk estimates to predict malignancy was 0.928 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.913 to 
0.940). The AUC was similar in oncology centers (0.926, 95% CI 0.910 to 0.940) and 
other centers (0.937, 95% CI 0.896 to 0.963). 
 
Results for the validation set (n=2403) 
When externally validated, the AUC was 0.917 (95% CI 0.902 to 0.930) (Figure 1a). 
The AUC was very similar in oncology centers (0.917, 95% CI 0.901 to 0.931) and in 
other centers (0.916, 95% CI 0.873 to 0.945). In all but three centers, the AUC was at 
least 0.90. Two centers had an AUC of 0.89 and one small center had an AUC below 
0.80 (Figure 2). The estimated risks were well calibrated in all validation patients 
(Figure 1b) and when assessed for patients from oncology centers and other 
hospitals separately (Figure 3).  
22.8% of the patients in the validation set had a calculated risk of malignancy <1%, 
while 48.5% had a calculated risk ≥30%. For the 1% calculated risk cutoff, sensitivity 
was 99.7%, specificity 33.7%, LR+ 1.5, LR- 0.010, PPV 44.8% and NPV 98.9%. For 
the 30% calculated risk cutoff, sensitivity was 89.0%, specificity 84.7%, LR+ 5.8, LR- 
0.13, PPV 75.4% and NPV 93.9% (Table 6). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+ 
and LR- for the same risk cutoff differed between oncology centers and other centers 
(Table 7).

Results for the total dataset 
The regression coefficients for the updated analysis on all data (n=4848) are shown 
in Table 8. Feature B1 (unilocular cyst) was most predictive of a benign tumor 
(coefficient -3.4), while feature B3 (acoustic shadows) was least predictive 
(coefficient -1.7). Feature M2 (ascites) was most predictive of malignancy (coefficient 
2.7) and feature M4 (irregular multilocular-solid tumor with largest diameter ≥ 
100mm) was least predictive (coefficient 1.0). Type of center had a coefficient of 0.9. 
For example, consider a patient examined at an oncology center and in whom 
features B3, M2, and M5 are present. This patient has a regression score of -0.97 
(intercept) – 1.66 (B3) + 2.65 (M2) + 1.55 (M5) + 0.92 (oncology center) = 2.49. The 
estimated risk of malignancy is 92.3%. Further details on this calculation are given in 
Table 8. 
For patients classified as benign by the original Simple Rules approach (i.e. only B-
features present) we observed estimated risks between <0.01% and 15.2% (in 
oncology centers: <0.01% to 15.2%; in other hospitals: <0.01% to 6.7%), and for 
patients classified as malignant (only M-features present) between 50.2% and 
>99.9% (in oncology centers: 71.7 to >99.9%; in other hospitals: 50.2 to 99.7%). For 
tumors classified as inconclusive by the original Simple Rules approach (i.e. no 
features or conflicting features present), we observed estimated risks between 1.3% 
and 99.1% (in oncology centers: 1.3 to 99.1%; in other hospitals: 2.1 to 88.2%), 
demonstrating the heterogeneity of this group.

Table 9 summarizes the range of estimated risks for individual patients depending on 
the number of B-features and M-features present in the tumor, based on the updated 
analysis (n=4848). In general, the estimated risk of malignancy was at least 42.0% if 
more M-features than B-features were present (N=1295, 27% of all tumors) and was 
at most 0.29% when two or more B-features and no M-features were present 
(N=175, 3.6% of all tumors). The estimated risk when no feature was present was 
48.7% for patients from oncology centers and 27.5% for patients from other centers 
(N=954, 20% of all tumors). Patients with conflicting features (one or more B-feature 
and one or more M-feature) were uncommon (N=161, 3.3% of all tumors). The type 
of feature is most important in patients with only one B-feature and no M-features: 
estimated risks vary between 1.2 and 15.2%. Based on these results a simple 
classification of adnexal masses based on the number of B-and M-features present 
can be used (Table 10).

Comment  
 
Principal findings of the study 
In this study we have developed a method to estimate the individual risk of 
malignancy in an adnexal mass using the ultrasound features in the IOTA Simple 
Rules. On prospective validation the risk estimates showed good ability to 
discriminate between benign and malignant tumors (AUC 0.917) and good 
agreement between the calculated risks of malignancy and the true prevalence of 
malignancy.  
 
Implications of the work 
The Simple Rules are intuitively attractive because of their ease of use.9–17,20 
However, when used as originally suggested they allow only a categorization of 
tumors into three groups: benign, malignant or inconclusive. In this study we show 
that the Simple Rules can also be used to estimate the risk of malignancy in every 
adnexal mass and so can be used for individualized patient management.  The type 
of center also needed to be included in our risk estimation, because the risk of a 
malignant tumor is higher in oncology centers than in others. The B-feature B1 
(unilocular cyst) was most predictive of a benign tumor, while the B-feature B3 
(acoustic shadows) was least predictive. The M-feature M2 (ascites) was most 
predictive of malignancy while the M-feature M4 (irregular multilocular-solid tumor 
with largest diameter ≥ 100mm) was least predictive. Many clinicians would probably 
agree that conservative management could be an option for tumors with a very low 
risk of malignancy (e.g. <1%), provided that this is appropriate when taking clinical 
 MANUSCRIPT

circumstances into account. In the current study 23% of the validation patients fell 
into this group (16% of patients in oncology centers and 31% of patients in other 
centers). Some clinicians might consider conservative management also for patients 
with a risk of malignancy <3% (32% of the validation patients in the study), at least if 
the patient is asymptomatic and if she is seen in a non-oncology center. On the other 
hand, most clinicians would probably agree that patients with a risk of malignancy 
≥30% would benefit from being referred to a gynecologic oncology center for further 
investigation and treatment. In the current study, 48% of the validation patients 
belonged to this high-risk group (61% of patients in oncology centers and 18% of 
patients in other centers). Patients with intermediate risks could be managed 
differently depending on local circumstances, e.g. depending on whether there is 
liberal or restricted access to ultrasound experts or gynecologic oncologic surgery. 
Some might want to operate on patients with intermediate risks in regional centers or 
refer such patients for second opinion ultrasonography by an expert.  
The coefficients can be used to calculate a reliable and well-calibrated individual risk 
estimate. Using Table 9, this risk of malignancy can be directly read off for 97% of all 
patients without the need for a computer. The other 3% of patients have tumors with 
both M-features and B-features, for these patients the precise individual risk estimate 
needs to be calculated using a computer or mobile app. However, they all belong to 
the elevated risk and very high-risk groups. Table 10 shows an even simpler 
classification of patients into different risk groups. Our results may lay the basis for a 
clinically useful imaging and management system such as the GI-RADS 
(Gynecologic Imaging Reporting and Data System) system28, as shown in Table 9 
and 10. While the GI-RADS system is based on subjective assessment of ultrasound

images, this new system would be based on more objective ultrasound criteria and 
type of center.  
The Simple Rules risk classification is an alternative to other algorithms such as the 
Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI)29, the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm 
(ROMA)30,  OVA-131,32 and the IOTA logistic regression models (LR1, LR219, 
ADNEX24).  Three studies have compared the IOTA methods with RMI and ROMA on 
the same study population.8,12,33,34 LR2 and the Simple Rules (classifying 
inconclusive cases as malignant) reached higher diagnostic accuracies than RMI 
8,12,33 and LR2 outperformed ROMA.34 These findings were confirmed in a systematic 
review and meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic performance of 19 prediction 
models.18 The multivariate index assay OVA-1 has been validated by two large 
multicenter studies in the USA.31,32 OVA-1 has never been compared with IOTA 
algorithms on the same set of patients, but it seems to have lower specificity at 
similar sensitivity, resulting in much higher rates of false-positives.35,36  
When prospectively validated on IOTA phase 3 data (i.e. on the validation set in the 
present study), the Simple Rules risk estimates, LR2, and subjective assessment 
(using six levels of diagnostic confidence) had similar diagnostic performance in 
terms of discrimination between benign and malignant tumors: the AUC for LR2 was 
0.918 (95% CI 0.905-0.930)8, for subjective assessment 0.914 (95% CI 0.886-0.936)8 
and for the Simple Rules risk estimate 0.917 (95%CI 0.902-0.930). The discriminative 
ability of the ADNEX model was slightly better: AUC 0.943 (95%CI 0.934 to 0.952).24 
The ADNEX model has the advantage over the other methods of not only 
differentiating benign from malignant disease but also giving risk estimates for four 
subgroups of malignant disease (borderline tumors, stage I invasive ovarian cancer,

stage II-IV invasive ovarian cancer and metastases in the ovaries from other primary 
tumors).24,37    
Because CA-125 is not used as a variable in the Simple Rules, it is not included in 
the Simple Rules risk classification. However, adding information on serum CA-125 
levels to ultrasound information does not seem to improve mathematical models to 
discriminate between benign and malignant adnexal masses.38  
Instead of using an algorithm, experienced examiners might still prefer to give an 
instant diagnosis using the IOTA Easy Descriptors. This is feasible in 42 - 46% of 
patients.8,39,40 The Easy Descriptors apply to endometriomas, dermoid cysts, simple 
cysts, and obvious malignancies.39 
In future studies, the Simple Rules risk estimates need to be prospectively and 
externally validated, and their use in a classification system for clinical management 
has to be investigated. 
 
Strengths and weaknesses 
The strength of this study is the use of a large multinational database in which 
patients were prospectively collected using well-defined terms, definitions and 
measurements. After development and temporal validation, the risk calculation was 
updated using all 4848 patients.  The large sample size is likely to yield generalizable 
results.

The study also has limitations. First, our risk calculation model was developed and 
validated exclusively on patients who underwent surgery. This is because we found it 
necessary to use the histological diagnosis as the gold standard. Second, all 
ultrasound examiners in the study were experienced, and so our results may not be 
applicable with less experienced operators. However, published studies have shown 
that the Simple Rules retain their performance in the hands of less-experienced 
examiners.10–12,14–17 This is likely to be also true of our Simple Rules risk calculation 
system, because the same ultrasound variables were used to calculate the risks. 
Conclusions 
We conclude that individual risk estimates can be derived from the ten ultrasound 
features in the Simple Rules with performance similar to the best previously 
published algorithms. A simple classification based on these risk estimates may form 
the basis of a clinical management system. This will hopefully facilitate choosing 
optimal treatment for all patients presenting with adnexal masses.

To use this model to estimate the risk of malignancy, add -0.97 (intercept) to the applicable 
coefficients to obtain the regression score (RS). Conversion of RS into a risk estimate is done using 
the formula (exp(RS)/(1+exp(RS)).

B-feature: benign feature; M-feature: malignant feature 
This table shows the risk of malignancy (in %) for the number of B and M features present. If only one 
feature applies, the risk for the specific B or M feature is depicted. 
The upper table applies to oncology centers, the lower table to other centers. Dark green color 
indicates very low risk of malignancy, green color low risk, yellow color moderate risk, orange color 
elevated risk, and red color very high risk. These Tables are intended to be used together with the 
original Simple Rules form.5

This simplified system only provides risk ranges for the number of B-and M-features present, but 
facilitates clinical triaging in the absence of electronic devices. Personalized risk estimates can be 
obtained in a second step.

Figure 1. Validation ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve (Panel A) and 
calibration curve (Panel B) for the calculated risk of malignancy (n = 2403). In the 
ROC curve the results for cut-offs 20% and 25% nearly coincide. Gray line: ideal 
calibration, black line: calibration curve, gray area: 95% confidence band. In the 
calibration plot, the distribution of estimated risks of malignancy is depicted in a 
histogram at the bottom, the positive bins showing the number of patients with 
malignant tumors, and the negative bins showing the number of patients with benign 
tumors.
