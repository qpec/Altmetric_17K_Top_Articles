Abstract
Introduction The chemical components of olive fruit pro-
vide a wide range of cardiovascular benefits. Arterial stiff-
ness is an important cardiovascular risk factor and can be
assessed using the Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI).
Objective The objective of this study was to assess the
impact of a proprietary standardized olive fruit extract
(SOFE) in subjects at risk for arterial stiffness.
Methods Twelve of 36 subjects were assigned to each of
the following groups for this 11-day, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled study: Group 1: 250 mg SOFE—50 mg
active ingredient, hydroxytyrosol (dosage achieved with
two capsules per day); Group 2: 500 mg SOFE—100 mg
active ingredient, hydroxytyrosol (dosage achieved with
two capsules per day); and Group 3: placebo.
Results All three groups showed a decrease in CAVI
scores, although no significant between-group differences
were observed. Group 2 had the largest reduction, with
mean CAVI scores decreasing from 11.02 to 8.91. Group 2
showed the strongest response in visual analog scale (VAS)
energy intensity (11.71% increase). Results for C-reactive
protein (CRP) blood levels showed no changes of statistical
significance between groups. Mean triglyceride levels from
Group 2 decreased by 21.64%, the most significant change
among all three groups.
Conclusions SOFE, an olive fruit extract containing many
of the phytochemicals shown to provide cardiovascular
benefits, was safe and well-tolerated. SOFE 500 mg had a
greater effect on CAVI scores, suggesting improved arterial
elasticity, and a clear reduction in triglycerides compared
with placebo and SOFE 250 mg. The decreased CAVI scores
suggest that increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
and lowering triglycerides with SOFE could potentially
reduce patients’ risk of developing atherosclerosis. Although
more studies are needed, positive cardiovascular health
trends, including improved vessel elasticity and positive
triglyceride effects, were evident with SOFE.
Key Points
Phenolic phytochemicals found in olive fruit are
potent inhibitors of LDL oxidation, and this type of
oxidation is considered to be a key mechanism in the
development of atherosclerosis.
Arterial stiffness is a non-traditional cardiovascular
risk factor, and long-term evidence has shown it to
be a marker of all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality, including fatal and non-fatal coronary
events.
The decreased CAVI index suggests that increasing
C-HDL and lowering triglycerides with SOFE could
potentially reduce patients’ risk of developing
atherosclerosis.

 cardiovascular benefits [1–6]. In addition to its high oleic
acid content (which is considered to be ‘neutral’ in terms of
cardioprotection) [7], substantial evidence indicates that
the protective effects of olive oil can be ascribed to the
antioxidant properties of its phenolic compounds (PCs),
which are absent in seed oil [8–11]. One of those com-
pounds, hydroxytyrosol, is a virgin olive fruit oil phenolic
phytochemical with proven health benefits that has been
used to generate new lipophilic antioxidants to preserve
fats and oils against autoxidation [1].
1.2 In Vitro and Preclinical Studies of Olive Fruit
Oil Phenolic Compounds (PCs)
In vitro studies have shown phenolics in olive fruit oil to be
strong radical scavengers. In order to evaluate the com-
parative physiological effects of hydroxytyrosol and its
lipophilic derivatives, hydroxytyrosol acetate and ethyl
hydroxytyrosol ether, in high-cholesterol fed animals,
Tabernero et al. [1] fed male Wistar rats (n = 8) a standard
diet (C group), a cholesterol-rich diet (Chol group), or a
cholesterol-rich diet supplemented with PCs (hydroxyty-
rosol group, hydroxytyrosol acetate group, and ethyl
hydroxytyrosol ether group) for 8 weeks. Plasma levels of
total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles-
terol, glucose, insulin, and leptin, as well as malondialde-
hyde (MDA) in serum increased in Chol rats compared
with C rats (P \ 0.05). Rats fed the test diets containing
hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives had improved glucose,
insulin, leptin, and MDA levels and antioxidant capacity
status, with hydroxytyrosol acetate being the most effective
compound. The results confirmed the metabolic effects of
hydroxytyrosol, which are maintained and even improved
by its hydrophobic derivatives, particularly hydroxytyrosol
acetate [1]. Studies in other animal models have shown that
PCs extracted from extra virgin olive oil (hydroxytyrosol,
tyrosol, and oleuropein) significantly inhibited the oxida-
tion of LDL cholesterol [12–14].
In a randomized, crossover controlled trial involving 200
healthy male volunteers, Covas et al. [2] evaluated whether
the phenolic content of olive oil, which includes hydroxy-
tyrosol, further benefits plasma lipid levels and lipid
oxidative damage compared with monounsaturated acid
content. The study was conducted at six research centers in
five European countries. A linear increase in high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels was observed for low-,
medium-, and high-polyphenol olive oil. The total choles-
terol: HDL cholesterol ratio decreased linearly with the
phenolic content of the olive oil, and triglyceride levels
decreased by an average of 0.05 mmol/L for all olive oils.
Oxidative stress markers decreased linearly with increasing
phenolic content. Mean changes for oxidized LDL levels
were 1.21 U/L (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8 to 3.6),
-1.48 U/L (95% CI -3.6 to 0.6), and -3.21 U/L (95% CI
-5.1 to -0.8) for the low-, medium-, and high-polyphenol
olive oil, respectively. The investigators concluded that olive
oil is more than a monounsaturated fat—its phenolic content
can also benefit plasma lipid levels and provide protection
from oxidative damage [2].
1.3 Clinical Studies of Olive Fruit Oil PCs
Verhoeven et al. [3] conducted a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized trial in 50 subjects with metabolic
syndrome, as defined by ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel
III)
criteria.
Patients
received
capsules
containing
10.82 mg of monacolins and 9.32 mg of hydroxytyrosol or
placebo for 8 weeks. In the intervention group, LDL
cholesterol was lowered by 24%, whereas it increased by
1% in the control group (P \ 0.001). Other effects
observed were reductions in total cholesterol (-17% in the
intervention
group
vs.
?2%
in
the
control
group;
P \ 0.001),
apolipoprotein
B
(-15%
vs.
?6%;
P \ 0.001), and triglycerides (-9% vs. ?16%; P = 0.02).
Oxidized LDL decreased by 20% in the intervention group
and increased by 5% in the control group (P \ 0.001). The
investigators concluded that the combination of active
products (which included hydroxytyrosol as well as the
statin [HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor] monacolin) in this
study may be an alternative therapeutic approach in people
who do not need, cannot, or do not want to be treated with
chemical statins [3].
A
direct
relation
between
cardiovascular
diseases
(CVDs) and oxidation of LDL is now well-established, and
oxidation of LDL particles is strongly associated with the
risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial
infarction [15].
1.4 Arterial Stiffness
Arterial stiffness is an important risk factor for cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality [19], and can be assessed
using several methods, including the Cardio-Ankle Vas-
cular Index (CAVI). CAVI is a well-studied marker that is
calculated from the pulse wave velocity (PWV) and
adjusted to blood pressure (BP) values, and is therefore less
dependent on changes in BP than conventional markers
[16]. CAVI has been shown to be a biomarker for evalu-
ating the severity of arterial fibrosis with higher sensitivity
and specificity than PWV [16].
CAVI
reflects
the
stiffness
of
arterial
segments,
including the aorta, femoral artery, and tibial artery. This
index was originally derived from Bamwell-Hill’s equation
and stiffness parameter b [17]. CAVI has been shown to be
a marker for numerous cardiovascular risk factors, such as
hypertension [18], diabetes mellitus [19], hyperlipidemia
356
P. Pais et al.
 [20], smoking [21], and epicardial adipose tissue [22].
CAVI may also play a role as a surrogate marker of sub-
clinical atherosclerosis, and substantial data have shown
associations between CAVI and components of CVD, such
as coronary atherosclerosis [19, 23], carotid atherosclerosis
[24], and stroke [25, 26].
Miyoshi and colleagues [27] investigated the association
of CAVI with coronary atherosclerosis and left ventricular
(LV) systolic and diastolic function in 206 consecutive
subjects with ischemic heart disease (IHD) undergoing
coronary angiography. The investigators found CAVI to be
independently associated with LV systolic and diastolic
function as well as coronary artery disease in patients with
IHD. The investigators concluded that determination of
arterial stiffness using CAVI may be useful for risk strat-
ification and secondary prevention in patients with IHD
[27]. There is some indication that CAVI is also useful in
evaluating atherogenic risks in metabolic syndrome [28].
The primary aims of assessing arterial stiffness using
CAVI have not been merely to aid in early detection of
atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and other cardiovascular
conditions, in order to allow timely treatment and change
in lifestyle, but also to quantitatively evaluate the pro-
gression of disease and the effectiveness of treatment [29].
Based on the in vitro and clinical profiles of the phenolic
phytochemicals that are found in olive fruit, we were
interested in quantifying the impact on cardiovascular
assessments of a proprietary standardized olive fruit extract
(SOFE) [Proliva� (Euromed, Barcelona, Spain)] that con-
tains many of those same PCs.
2 Study Objectives
This study was designed to assess and explore the benefi-
cial effects of SOFE, specifically for CAVI score reduc-
tions and for exploratory purposes for other key analytes.
2.1 Primary Objective for Efficacy Evaluation
The primary objective of this study was to assess the
impact of SOFE on the following in subjects with arterial
stiffness:
•
CAVI.
•
Energy visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire.
•
CRP (C-reactive protein).
•
Blood chemistry.
2.2 Endpoints
The primary study endpoints were the reduction and/or
improvement of the following cardiovascular parameters:
•
CAVI reduction C7 B9.
•
Increase in energy assessed with a VAS questionnaire
(exploratory).
•
CRP (exploratory).
The secondary exploratory endpoints were potentially
positive outcomes on blood chemistry analytes (Table 1)
that could be abnormal as a consequence of atherosclerotic
risk, as assessed by CAVI prior to treatment.
3 Methodology
After protocol approval by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB), 36 male and female subjects between 45 and
65 years of age were prescreened to confirm if they met the
inclusion and exclusion criteria for this 11-day, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study. We replicated the timeline
from the pilot study (11 days) to be consistent with the

 initial design. Thirty-six subjects were selected to partici-
pate. For each subject, the study concluded 11 days after
enrollment and included three follow-up visits (Days 0, 5,
and 10).
Informedconsentfromeachparticipantwasobtainedbefore
they were administered the test articles. On Day 0 (baseline),
the CAVI test, medical history, and physical examinations
were performed on all subjects. Physical examination included
measurements of body mass index (BMI), BP, and tempera-
ture. On Day 0, participants who did not meet the inclusion
criteria were removed from the study. Participants not
responding to phone calls within a 3-day period after the pre-
viouscallwere excluded.OnDay0,participantsinbothgroups
initiated the 11-day treatment (Table 2).
Project managers followed up with all patients when
treatment was competed. If an adverse event occurred after
study completion, the subject was evaluated by the physician
and the evaluation recorded in the Adverse Event Form.
To enable evaluation of the test article in the context of
the patient’s normal diet, the study design precluded life-
style changes such as restricting or encouraging the con-
sumption of olive oil or any other product that may have
affected study results. This applied to both treatment
groups.
3.1 Test Articles
The test articles in this study were presented as follows:
•
Capsules marked as HFGBVHFD: white bottles con-
taining 24 capsules each.
•
Capsules marked as QEDWESDA: white bottles con-
taining 24 capsules each.
•
Capsules marked as OILKOJPUL: white bottles con-
taining 24 capsules each.
The active ingredient in the SOFE formulation was
hydroxytyrosol.
Test articles for this study were supplied/labeled as
follows:
•
HFGBVHFD: 125 mg SOFE/each; dose: two capsules
per day (hydroxytyrosol 50 mg).
•
QEDWESDA: 250 mg SOFE/each; dose: two capsules
per day (hydroxytyrosol 100 mg).
•
OILKOJPUL: placebo; dose: two capsules per day.
Coded capsules were identical in appearance and were
packed in identical bottles labeled with the patient number,
treatment code, and appropriate period of the study. This
ensured that all study personnel as well as all subjects

3.4 Appropriateness of Measurements
3.4.1 Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI)
As mentioned in Sect. 1.4, CAVI is a marker of arterial
stiffness calculated from the PWV and adjusted to BP
values, and is therefore less dependent on changes in BP
than conventional markers [16]. CAVI has also been
shown to be a biomarker for evaluating the severity of
arterial fibrosis with higher sensitivity and specificity
than PWV [16]. CAVI was implemented in this study
using a VaSera VS-1000 vascular screening system
(Fukuda Denshi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cuffs were
applied to bilateral upper arms and ankles, with subjects
lying in a supine position and holding their heads along
the midline. ECG electrodes were placed on both wrists,
and the CAVI microphone for detecting heart sounds
was placed over the sternum. Subjects rested in this
supine position for at least 10 min before the start of
monitoring. CAVI was calculated using the following
formula (Eq. 1):
CAVI ¼ a ð2p=DPÞ � In(Ps=PdÞ � PWV2
�
�
þ b
ð1Þ
where, Ps is systolic BP, Pd is diastolic BP, DP is Ps - Pd,
p is blood density, and a and b are constants.

 3.4.2 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Questionnaire
VAS questionnaires have been used since the 1920s to
measure subjective phenomena due to their brevity, uni-
versality, and ease of use and scoring [30]. Combined with
research showing that the performance of single-item VAS
questionnaires rivals that of longer questionnaires with
respect to correlation with clinical variables and sensitivity
to change [31], the above-described properties have led to
widespread use of VAS questionnaires in both clinical
medicine and research. For example, VAS questionnaires
have shown great utility in measuring numerous symptoms
relevant to fibromyalgia, including energy, satiety, func-
tional ability, and pain [30].
VAS questionnaires measuring fatigue have also been
shown to be highly reproducible and sensitive for quanti-
fying symptom severity and treatment response in multiple
patient populations [31]. They focus on the current phe-
nomena, providing a subjective assessment for each sub-
ject; the underlying causes of those phenomena are
excluded from the assessment.
The following VAS questions were used to measure
energy:
•
Intensity of energy right now?
•
Fatigue intensity right now?
•
Appetite intensity right now?
•
Feeling warm right now?
•
Stomach discomfort right now?
•
How satisfying did you find the study product, in
general?
Each VAS questionnaire consisted of 100 mm hori-
zontal lines containing the extreme sensations at either end,
as shown in Fig. 1. Subjects completed the VAS ques-
tionnaire by placing a vertical slash on the line corre-
sponding to their sensation.
3.4.3 C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
CRP has been the most widely used biomarker for quan-
tifying inflammation in CVD [32–35] and is the only
reproducible indicator for which a standardized assay has
been developed [36, 37].
All CRP tests used the immunoturbidimetric method,
and were carried out by Laboratorio Clı
´nico Centro
Integral de Diagno
´stico Me
´dico, an independent analytical
laboratory based in Guadalajara, Mexico.
3.4.4 Blood Chemistry
A
long-standing
association
exists
between
elevated
triglyceride levels and CVD [38, 39]. However, the extent
to which triglycerides directly promote CVD or represent a
biomarker of risk has been debated for 3 decades [40]. To
this end, two National Institutes of Health consensus con-
ferences evaluated the evidentiary role of triglycerides in
cardiovascular risk assessment and provided therapeutic
recommendations for the management of hypertriglyc-
eridemia [41, 42].
In the present study, all blood chemistry analytes,
including triglycerides, were evaluated as exploratory
endpoints. Blood chemistry tests and measurement meth-
ods are displayed in Table 3.
3.5 Treatment Compliance
To ensure treatment compliance, adequate instructions
regarding treatment administration, study procedures,
and informed consent were given to participants prior to
study initiation. A project manager was assigned to
follow-up with all subjects daily to evaluate treatment
progress.
3.6 Data Quality Assurance
Project managers and their assistants were provided with
detailed instructions on protocol conduct prior to study
initiation. The study was monitored regularly, and at each
monitoring visit all documentation and CRF entries were
verified for accuracy. The quality assurance monitor
ensured that the project managers maintained accurate,
timely, and complete records.
3.7 Statistical Methods
Continuous quantitative variables were presented as the
mean with standard deviation. To assess changes between
different measurements of the study variables, non-para-
metric tests were used (Wilcoxon rank test). Continuous
quantitative variables were evaluated using the Kruskal–
Fig. 1 Example of the visual analog scale questionnaire used in this study
360
P. Pais et al.
 Wallis method. The intragroup difference was calculated
using the Wilcoxon rank test.
3.8 Sample Size
The sample size was selected based on the assumption that
using a sample size four times that of a previous pilot study
would be sufficient.
3.9 Protocol Deviations
Clinical sites worked under Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
guidelines. As standard procedure, all protocol deviations
during the study were to be documented. The Sponsor and
IRB were to receive copies of the Note to Study and
Deviation Form(s), when applicable. After each notifica-
tion had been made, a CAPA (Corrective and Preventive
Action) form was to be included in the Quality Assurance
Report, and appropriate follow-up implemented according
to standard operating procedures. There were no protocol
deviations in this study.
3.10 Ethics Statement
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles that have their origin in the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki, and that are consistent with GCP and the appli-
cable regulatory requirement(s). Clinical sites followed
ICH Good Clinical Practices (E6), which were developed
under the Helsinki Declaration. All personnel involved in
this study had been certified with GCP training.
The study was conducted in accordance with all appli-
cable regulatory requirements. Prior to study initiation, the
study protocol was submitted to an independent IRB,
Investigacio
´n Biome
´dica para el Desarrollo de Fa

SA de CV, Zapopan, Jalisco, Me
´xico. The study com-
menced after an affirmative decision of the IRB concerning
the conduct of the study was sent in writing to the inves-
tigator. Freely given informed consent was obtained from
study participants.

three groups (Fig. 5). Other blood chemistry results were
unchanged or remained within the normal range and are
displayed in Table 4.
4.2 Adverse Events
Pharmacological intervention with SOFE at both doses
(250 and 500 mg) produced results that were similar to
those of placebo. Patient profiles of liver and kidney
function were not significantly changed during the 11 days
of treatment. Both active treatment groups were equally
exposed to SOFE, and recorded similar electrolytic pro-
files, indicating that, for 11 days, treatment with SOFE was
as safe as placebo regarding function of the kidney, the
organ responsible for homeostasis of the body’s electrolyte
system. These results were consistent with those of the
protein profile, as the bioavailabilities of albumin and
globulin did not change significantly during the study. No
adverse events were reported in laboratory tests.
In general terms, oral ingestion of SOFE in a range of
250–500 mg was administered safely for 11 days to
patients with significant arterial stiffness and at risk for
atherosclerosis (CAVI scores C9).
5 Discussion
5.1 Review of Key Results
In this study, all three groups showed a decrease in CAVI
scores, although no significant differences were observed
between the control and SOFE groups at the end of treat-
ment. Group 2 had the largest reduction among all three
groups, with mean CAVI scores decreasing from 11.02
(suspected arteriosclerosis) at baseline to 8.91 (borderline)
at the end of the 11-day treatment period.

 Although there were no statistically significant changes
between the three study groups in the VAS evaluation, the
data show trends that can be taken into consideration when
designing a longer study by including a larger sample size.
Group 2 showed the strongest response in energy
intensity, with an 11.71% increase from baseline.
Results for CRP blood levels showed no changes of
statistical significance between groups, and no trends could
be determined. A larger study sample would be needed to
assess variation between timepoints individually for each
study group and variation between groups.
Mean triglyceride levels from Group 2 (SOFE 500 mg)
decreased by 21.64% after the 11-day treatment period,
showing the most significant change among all three
groups (P = 0.03 vs. placebo). Other blood chemistry
results were unchanged, remaining within normal limits.
A number of trials provide added insight to the clinical
utility of phenolic phytochemicals, and are consistent with
the findings of the present study.
5.2 Relevant Clinical Trials of Olive Oil
As noted in Sect. 1.2, PCs present in virgin olive oil (e.g.,
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and oleuropein) have shown anti-
inflammatory and antioxidative effects in CVD. The PCs in
virgin olive oil may explain some of the protective effects
found in epidemiological studies [43].
Moreno-Luna et al. [6] conducted a double-blind, ran-
domized, crossover dietary intervention study to examine the
influence of a polyphenol-rich olive oil on BP and endothelial
function in 24 young women with high-normal BP or stage 1
essential hypertension, and concluded that the consumption of
a diet containing polyphenol-rich olive oil can decrease BP
and improve endothelial function in this population.
Estruch et al. [44] conducted a multicenter randomized
trial to evaluate the Mediterranean diet for the primary
prevention of cardiovascular events. The investigators
randomly assigned participants who were at high cardio-
vascular risk, but with no CVD at enrollment, to one of the
following three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented
with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supple-
mented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce
dietary fat). The rate of major cardiovascular events (my-
ocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular
causes) was the primary endpoint. Based on the results of
Fig. 3 Cardio-ankle vascular
index: progressive percentage of
reduction effect. Projections
from Day 15 to Day 55 are only
estimations based on the
percentage variation taken from
study Day 10 with respect to
Day 5. Results may vary from
subject to subject and from
group to group in a study with a
larger sample size and a longer
treatment period. Many other
objective and subjective factors
may affect the outcome of the
results of a larger study

 an interim analysis, the trial was stopped after a median
follow-up of 4.8 years. A total of 7447 subjects were
enrolled (age range 55–80 years); 57% were female. A
primary endpoint event occurred in 288 participants. The
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% CI
0.54–0.92) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.54–0.96) for subjects
receiving the Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil
(96 events) and those assigned to the Mediterranean diet
with nuts (83 events), respectively, compared with the
control group (109 events). The investigators concluded
that
among
subjects
at
high
cardiovascular
risk,
a
Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive
oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular
events, and that the primary between-group differences
involved the supplemental items. The investigators added
that ‘‘extra-virgin olive oil and nuts were probably
responsible for most of the observed benefits of the
Mediterranean diets’’ [44].
Similarly, although the high ratio of unsaturated to sat-
urated fats found in the Mediterranean diet may contribute
to its substantial benefits in CHD, it appears that olive oil
may be working in other ways as well. The antioxidant
activities of its PCs, shown to inhibit key elements in the
pathogenesis of heart disease, are very likely important
[43].
5.3 Relevant Clinical Trials of Other Fruit Products
Containing PCs
Although lacking polyphenols, white wine contains PCs
such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, which are character-
istic of extra-virgin olive fruit oil, and, as detailed in
Sect. 1.2, share similar antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties [7]. The effects of white wine and extra-virgin
olive fruit oil on inflammatory markers was evaluated in
ten healthy volunteers and ten patients with chronic kidney

Quality Initiative) stage III–IV, in a prospective, single-
blind, randomized, crossover trial. Plasma markers of
chronic inflammation were significantly reduced in CKD
patients during the combined consumption of white wine
and olive fruit oil, suggesting a possible anti-inflammatory
effect of this nutritional intervention [45].
In another trial, vascular function testing and microarray
analysis were performed by Yonei et al. [46] to evaluate
the physical effects of cassis (Ribes nigrum) juice, which
contains polyphenols, in healthy women assigned to one of
four cassis groups (polysaccharide content: 0, 50, 125, and
250 mg) or a water control group (duration of intake:
2–8 weeks). The following were used to assess vascular
function: CAVI, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI),
accelerated plethysmography, and flow-mediated dilation
(FMD). Cassis juice (polysaccharide content: 125–250 mg)
(n = 16) increased the body fat percentage (?2.5%;
P = 0.011), decreased systolic (121.3 ± 15.8 mmHg at
baseline,
-4.8%;
P = 0.001)
and

and

percentage
increase
in

temperature
was
dependent on polysaccharide (P \ 0.05) and polyphenol
(P \ 0.01) contents. The investigators concluded that
cassis
juice
induced
limb
peripheral
vasodilatation,
increased in blood flow, and decreased BP. Coupled with
the role that vascular endothelium plays in vasodilatation
associated with various messenger RNA expressions, the
investigators suggested that polyphenol-containing cassis
juice may also improve endothelial cell function [46].
5.4 Interpretation of Relevant Data by Regulatory
Agencies
Following a request from the European Commission, the
Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies was
asked to provide a scientific opinion to address the sub-
stantiation of health claims for polyphenols contained in
olive oil products. The food constituent, which is the
subject of the health claims, is polyphenols (e.g., hydrox-
ytyrosol and oleuropein complex) contained in olive (olive
fruit, olive mill waste waters or olive oil, Olea europaea L.
extract and leaf).
The Panel reported that polyphenols in olive products
that are standardized by their content of hydroxytyrosol
and its derivatives are sufficiently characterized in relation
to the effects claimed by their manufacturers. On the basis
of the data presented, the Panel concluded that a cause and
effect relationship has been established between the con-
sumption
of
standardized
olive
oil
polyphenols
and
protection of LDL particles from oxidative damage. The
Panel noted that, in order to realize the benefits of that
claim, 5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (e.g.,
oleuropein complex and tyrosol) derived from olive oil
should be consumed daily. These amounts, if provided
through moderate amounts of olive oil, can be easily
consumed in the context of a balanced diet. The Panel
further noted that concentrations in some olive oils may be
too low to allow the consumption of this amount of
polyphenols in the context of a balanced diet [47].
5.5 Atherosclerosis, Arterial Stiffness, and CAVI
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that
develops in lesion-prone regions of medium-sized arteries.
Atherosclerotic lesions may be present and clinically silent
for decades before becoming active and producing patho-
logical conditions such as acute myocardial infarction,
unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death [48].
As indicated in Sect. 1.4, arterial stiffness is a non-tra-
ditional cardiovascular risk factor, and long-term evidence
has shown it to be a marker of all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality, including fatal and non-fatal coronary events
[49, 50].
Nakamura et al. [23] found a strong association between
CAVI and the presence of coronary atherosclerosis based
on their ordinal logistic regression analysis. Kadota et al.
[51] suggested the use of CAVI as a screening tool for
atherosclerosis based on their findings from a general
population study of 1014 adults that showed strong sig-
nificant associations of CAVI scores with carotid intima-
media thickness and with homocysteine, after adjustment
for age and sex [51]. Accordingly, it can be concluded that
CAVI scores reflect arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis and
arteriosclerosis—conditions
that
are
overlapping
and
inseparable [52].
As noted in Sect. 1.2, phenolic phytochemicals found in
olive fruit are potent inhibitors of LDL oxidation, and this
type of oxidation is considered to be a key mechanism in
the development of atherosclerosis [53]. Other mechanisms
by which polyphenols may be protective against CVDs are
antioxidant, antiplatelet, and anti-inflammatory effects as
well as increasing HDL, and improving endothelial func-
tion [54]. Polyphenols may also contribute to stabilization
of atheroma plaque [15].
5.6 Limitations of the Present Study
Based on the trends seen in this study, a longer treatment
period with a larger sample size may more accurately
define the placebo effect as well as the full extent of SOFE
efficacy. For example, had the period of treatment been
extended, it is likely that the trend for the core values
SOFE in Subjects with Arterial Stiffness Risk
365
 would have continued, as was the case in a study by Satoh
et al. [28] in which the CAVI score continued to fall for
12 weeks following oral intake of 1.8 g of highly purified
eicosapentaenoic acid [28]. Similarly, the effects of
pitavastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase) in low-
ering the rear CAVI consumption index were sustained for
12 months in a clinical trial by Miyashita et al. [55].
These results were consistent with data reported by the
same research group regarding the effect of the angiotensin
II blocker olmesartan medoxomil (20 mg/day orally) and
the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (5 mg/day orally)
administered for the same time interval [56].
In addition, a study cohort of 90–120 subjects might be
required to demonstrate statistical significance between
groups at the P [ 0.05 level in a future trial following the
same methods.
6 Conclusions
In the present study, the intake of 250 and 500 mg oral
SOFE, an olive fruit extract containing many of the PCs
shown to provide a wide range of cardiovascular benefits,
was safe and well-tolerated over 11 days, based on the
results of analyses of blood chemistry and blood metabo-
lites. Although there were no statistically significant
changes versus baseline for the acute and extended mea-
surements at Day 11, oral administration of SOFE 500 mg
had a greater effect on CAVI scores, suggesting improved
arterial elasticity, and a clear reduction in triglycerides
compared with placebo and SOFE 250 mg.
The decreased CAVI scores reported in the present
study suggest that increasing HDL cholesterol and lower-
ing triglycerides with SOFE could potentially reduce
patients’ risk of developing atherosclerosis. The minimal
improvements seen in the placebo group indicate that, in
patients not exposed to the SOFE contained in Proliva�,
the parameters of primary and secondary efficacy did not
change.
Although more studies are needed, positive cardiovas-
cular health trends, including improved vessel elasticity
and positive triglyceride effects, were evident with SOFE.
