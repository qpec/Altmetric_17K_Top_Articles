Abstract
Background Absorption of current rapid-acting insulins is
too slow for patients with diabetes mellitus to achieve
optimal postprandial glucose control. Faster-acting insulin
aspart (faster aspart) is insulin aspart in a new formulation
with faster early absorption. We compared the pharma-
cokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart and
insulin aspart across a clinically relevant dose range.
Methods In this randomised, double-blind, crossover trial,
46 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus received single
subcutaneous doses of faster aspart and insulin aspart at
0.1, 0.2 (repeated three times to estimate within-subject
variability) and 0.4 U/kg in a euglycaemic clamp setting
(target 5.5 mmol/L).
Results Consistently for the three doses, faster aspart
demonstrated faster onset and greater early absorption and
glucose-lowering effect versus insulin aspart. Across all
three doses, onset of appearance occurred approximately
twice as fast (approximately 5 min earlier) and early
insulin exposure (AUCIAsp,0–30min) was approximately 1.5-
to 2-fold greater for faster aspart versus insulin aspart.
Likewise, onset of action occurred approximately 5 min
faster and early glucose-lowering effect (AUCGIR,0–30min)
was approximately 1.5- to 2-fold larger for faster aspart
versus insulin aspart. Relative bioavailability was approx-
imately 100% and total glucose-lowering effect was similar
for faster aspart versus insulin aspart. Dose–concentration
and dose–response relationships were comparable between
faster aspart and insulin aspart. Within-subject variability
in glucose-lowering effect was low for faster aspart (co-
efficient of variation approximately 20%) and not signifi-
cantly different from insulin aspart.
Conclusion The faster onset and greater early insulin
exposure and glucose-lowering effect with faster aspart
versus insulin aspart are preserved across a broad range of
doses and consistently observed from day to day.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02033239.
Key Points
Onset of appearance was twice as fast, and early
insulin exposure and glucose-lowering effect were
up to twofold greater, with faster-acting insulin
aspart compared with insulin aspart across a
clinically relevant dose range of 0.1–0.4 U/kg in
subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Within-subject day-to-day variability in early and
total glucose-lowering effect was low for faster-
acting insulin aspart and comparable with insulin
aspart, with coefficients of variation for both insulins
in the range of 18–25%.
Faster-acting insulin aspart has the pharmacological
properties to provide clinical benefits over current
rapid-acting insulin analogues in terms of improved
postprandial glucose control.

 1 Introduction
Achievement of recommended glycosylated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) targets in patients with diabetes requires optimi-
sation of postprandial glucose control [1, 2]. The devel-
opment of rapid-acting insulin analogues (insulin aspart,
insulin lispro and insulin glulisine) has provided improved
postprandial glycaemia through accelerated absorption and
earlier onset of action compared with regular human
insulin [3–5]. Nonetheless, even with rapid-acting insulin
analogues, absorption is too slow to achieve optimal con-
trol of postprandial glucose when administered at the start
of the meal [6–8]. It has been shown that administration of
current rapid-acting insulin approximately 15 min before
the start of the meal provides the best possible postprandial
glycaemia with these products [7]. The injection–meal
interval compensates for the delay from subcutaneous
injection
until
the
circulating
insulin
concentration
becomes sufficient to match the carbohydrate uptake fol-
lowing a meal [8]; however, in accordance with current
labelling, and for ease and convenience, many patients with
diabetes use a shorter or no injection–meal interval [9].
Thus, there is a need for insulins with more rapid phar-
macological properties that better mimic the endogenous
prandial insulin secretion in healthy individuals.
Faster-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is insulin
aspart in a new formulation including two well-known
additional excipients, L-arginine and niacinamide, which
provide a stable formulation with faster early absorption.
L-arginine and niacinamide are both listed in the US FDA
inactive ingredient database, in products for injection, at
higher concentrations than used in faster aspart [10]. In a
previous trial in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM), a single dose of faster aspart 0.2 U/kg provided
twice as fast onset of appearance, twofold greater early
insulin exposure and 50% greater early glucose-lowering
effect within the first 30 min after injection compared with
insulin aspart [11].
In patients with diabetes, mealtime insulin requirements
can vary substantially depending on carbohydrate content
and glycaemic index of the meal. It is therefore important
to assess whether the improved pharmacological properties
of faster aspart versus insulin aspart at 0.2 U/kg [11] are
also found across a broader dose range. Moreover, as
reliable titration of an insulin product depends on an
established dose–response relationship, it is pertinent to
investigate the
dose–concentration
and
dose–response
relationships of any new insulin. Finally, the degree of
variability in insulin action between similar consecutive
insulin injections has considerable impact on the ability to
achieve strict glycaemic control without the risk of hypo-
glycaemia [12, 13]. Thus, it is highly relevant to investigate
within-subject variability in the glucose-lowering effect of
faster aspart.
In this glucose clamp study, we compared faster aspart
and insulin aspart with respect to pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties across three clinically rele-
vant dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg). Furthermore, we
investigated the dose–concentration and dose–response
relationships of faster aspart, and compared the within-
subject variability in glucose-lowering effect between fas-
ter aspart and insulin aspart. The study was conducted in
subjects with T1DM, who are regarded as the optimal
population in glucose clamp studies because the glucose-
lowering effect can be compared between exogenous
insulins without interference from endogenous insulin
secretion [14].
2 Methods
2.1 Study Design and Participants
This was a randomised, single-centre (Profil, Neuss, Ger-
many), double-blind, eight-period, crossover trial. The
local health authority (Bundesinstitut fu
¨r Arzneimittel und
Medizinprodukte) and an independent ethics committee
(A
¨ rztekammer Nordrhein) reviewed and approved the trial
protocol. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
(trial identifier: NCT02033239).
Eligible subjects were men and women 18–64 years of
age (both inclusive), with T1DM for C12 months before
inclusion in the trial, treated with multiple daily insulin
injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for
C12 months [total daily insulin dose\
1.2 (I)U/kg/day and
total daily bolus insulin dose \ 0.7 (I)U/kg/day], with
HbA1c B9.0% (B75 mmol/mol), body mass index (BMI)
of 18.5–28.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) and fasting C-pep-
tide B0.3 nmol/L. Subjects were excluded if they had
clinically significant concomitant diseases, clinically sig-
nificant abnormal values in clinical laboratory screening
tests, were smokers or were currently treated with other
drug(s) that may interfere with glucose metabolism.
Informed consent was obtained from all individual
participants included in the study.
2.2 Procedures
The trial consisted of 10 visits: a screening visit, eight
dosing visits separated by a 3- to 15-day washout period,
and a follow-up visit. All subjects received three dose
levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg) of faster aspart and insulin
aspart to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-
namic properties between treatments, and to investigate the
dose–concentration and dose–response relationships. To
650
T. Heise et al.
 estimate the within-subject variability, subjects were ran-
domised to receive either two additional doses of faster
aspart 0.2 U/kg or two additional doses of insulin aspart 0.2
U/kg (Fig. 1). The eight dosing visits were conducted in
randomised sequence.
The trial products were faster aspart (100 U/mL; Novo
Nordisk,
Bagsværd,
Denmark)
and
insulin
aspart
(NovoRapid�; 100 U/mL; Novo Nordisk), both in a blin-
ded PDS290 pen-injector prefilled pen (Novo Nordisk).
Trial products were administered by subcutaneous injec-
tion into a lifted skinfold of the lower abdominal wall
above the inguinal area by a qualified person with no other
tasks in the study, to keep its double-blind nature.
At each dosing visit, subjects attended the clinical site
in the morning after having fasted since 2200 h the eve-
ning before (except for water ad libitum and B20 g of
rapidly absorbable carbohydrate if needed to prevent
hypoglycaemia). A euglycaemic glucose clamp procedure
(ClampArt�; Profil) was then conducted as previously
described [11]. Initially, subjects received a variable
intravenous infusion of regular human insulin [15 IU
Actrapid� (100 IU/mL; Novo Nordisk) in 49 mL saline
and 1 mL of the subject’s blood] or glucose (20%) for
1–4 h before dosing to obtain a blood glucose target level
of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). The intravenous insulin
infusion rate was manually adjusted by attending staff
based on actual blood glucose measurements, while the
intravenous glucose infusion rate was automatically
adjusted by ClampArt� in order to keep blood glucose at
the target level throughout the glucose clamp. Dosing of
the trial product occurred after blood glucose concentra-
tion had been stable for C1 h, with no infusion of glucose.
After dosing, the rate of intravenous insulin infusion (if
any) was gradually reduced and terminated completely
when blood glucose had fallen by 0.3 mmol/L (5 mg/dL).
The intravenous glucose infusion was then initiated. The
clamp lasted for up to 12 h after dosing, but was stopped
earlier if blood glucose consistently exceeded 11.1 mmol/L
(200 mg/dL) without the need for intravenous glucose
infusion during the last 30 min. Mean profiles of intra-
venous insulin infusion from -60 min until blood glucose
had fallen by 0.3 mmol/L (5 mg/dL), and mean profiles of
blood glucose concentration from -60 min until 30 min,
are shown in Online Resource 1, Fig. S1. The quality of
the conducted clamps was high and comparable across
treatments and dose levels (Online Resource 1, Table S1)
[15].
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment were
drawn within 2 min pre-dose, then every 2 min from dos-
ing until 20 min post-dose, every 5 min from 20 to 80 min,
every 10 min from 80 min to 2 h, every 15 min from 2 to
2.5 h, and then at 3, 3.5, 4, 5.5, 7, 9 and 12 h post-dose.
2.3 Assessments
Free serum insulin aspart concentrations (polyethylene
glycol-precipitated) were measured by a validated insulin
aspart-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with
a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 10 pmol/L. The
glucose infusion rate needed to keep the blood glucose
concentration at the clamp target level was recorded
automatically every minute during the glucose clamp.
Safety assessments included adverse events, local tolera-
bility at the injection site, hypoglycaemic episodes (de-
fined as ‘confirmed’ when they were either ‘severe’
according to the American Diabetes Association, i.e.
requiring third-party assistance [16], or verified by a
plasma glucose level of \
3.1 mmol/L [56 mg/dL]), lab-
oratory safety parameters, physical examination, vital
signs and electrocardiogram.

 2.4 Endpoints
Endpoints were onset of appearance [time from trial pro-
duct administration until the first-time serum insulin con-
centration CLLOQ (10 pmol/L)], time to early 50% of
maximum insulin concentration (tEarly 50% Cmax), time to
maximum insulin concentration (tmax), onset of action
[time from trial product administration until the blood
glucose concentration had decreased by C0.3 mmol/L
(5 mg/dL) from baseline], time to early 50% of maximum
glucose infusion rate (tEarly 50% GIRmax), and time to max-
imum glucose infusion rate (tGIRmax) [all to evaluate onset
of exposure and onset of glucose-lowering effect]; early
partial areas under the curve (AUCs) for serum insulin
(AUCIAsp,0–15min,
AUCIAsp,0–30min,
AUCIAsp,0–1h,
AUCIAsp,0–1.5h, and AUCIAsp,0–2h) and glucose infusion rate
(AUCGIR,0–30min,
AUCGIR,0–1h,
AUCGIR,0–1.5h,
and
AUCGIR,0–2h) to evaluate early exposure and early glucose-
lowering effect; and total exposure (AUCIAsp,0–t), maxi-
mum concentration (Cmax), total glucose-lowering effect
(AUCGIR,0–t; primary endpoint), and maximum glucose
infusion rate (GIRmax) to evaluate overall exposure and
glucose-lowering effect.
For
calculation
of
onset
of
appearance
and
AUCIAsp,0–15min, insulin aspart concentration was imputed
during the time interval from dosing until the time of the first
observed insulin aspart concentration above LLOQ using
compartmental modelling (see Online Resource 1, page 4 for
details). For consistency, this approach was also used for the
initial part of the AUC in the calculation of all other AUCIAsp
endpoints. AUCIAsp,0–t was derived by calculating the AUC
until the time of the last quantifiable insulin aspart concen-
tration, and then extrapolating until 12 h (last pharmacoki-
netic sampling time point) based on the terminal slope.
AUCGIR,0–t was calculated until the time of the last observed
glucose infusion rate [
0. Endpoints were derived from the
raw profiles, except for tEarly
50%
GIRmax, GIRmax and
tGIRmax, which were derived from LOESS smoothed glu-
cose infusion rate profiles (using a smoothing factor of 0.1) in
order to ensure robust calculation of these endpoints.
2.5 Statistical Analyses
2.5.1 General Statistical Considerations
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) at a 5% significance level
based on all randomised subjects receiving at least one
dose of trial product. Safety endpoints were summarised by
descriptive statistics, also based on all subjects receiving at
least one dose of trial product. Unless otherwise stated
(post hoc analyses), the statistical analyses conducted were
planned prior to database lock.
2.5.2 Sample Size Calculation
Based on the primary endpoint, AUCGIR,0–t, the number of
completers required in this trial was 24 subjects to obtain
C90% power for distinguishing between the three faster
aspart dose levels, assuming true ratios for AUCGIR,0–t of
1.35 (0.2 vs. 0.1 U/kg, and 0.4 vs. 0.2 U/kg) and a within-
subject standard deviation (on the log-scale) of 0.31 (from
a previous trial with faster aspart [11]). However, in order
to obtain sufficient power also for evaluating differences
between faster aspart and insulin aspart, the number of
required completers was increased to 40 subjects. This
yielded 80% power for detecting a geometric mean treat-
ment ratio of 1.2 for AUCGIR,0–1h based on an assumed
within-subject standard deviation (on the log-scale) of 0.29
[11].
2.5.3 Analysis of Onset, Exposure and Glucose-Lowering
Effect
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints were
log-transformed (except onset of exposure endpoints, onset
of glucose-lowering effect endpoints, AUCGIR,0–30min and
AUCGIR,0–1h) and compared between faster aspart and
insulin aspart at each dose level (post hoc for AUCGIR,0–t)
in a linear mixed model, with period, treatment, dose and
the interaction between treatment and dose as fixed effects
and subject as a random effect. For endpoints that were not
log-transformed, the model further included an interaction
between subject and dose as a random effect, and the
variance parameters were dependent on dose. For end-
points that were not log-transformed, treatment ratios and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using
Fieller’s method [17].
2.5.4 Analysis of Dose–Concentration and Dose–Response
To
investigate
the
dose–concentration
relationship,
AUCIAsp,0–t and Cmax were log-transformed and analysed
using a linear mixed model, with treatment and period as
fixed effects, log-dose and an interaction between treat-
ment and log-dose as covariates, and subject as a random
effect. The log-AUCIAsp,0–t versus log-dose, and the log-
Cmax versus log-dose slopes, were estimated for each
treatment, and it was tested if the slope for faster aspart
was different from 1.00 (indicating a deviation from dose
proportionality) and if the slopes differed between treat-
ments (post hoc).
To investigate the dose–response relationship, ratios
(and 95% CIs) between dose levels were estimated
within each treatment for AUCGIR,0–t using the same
model as described in Sect. 2.5.3 for AUCGIR,0–t (pri-
mary analysis). To further explore the functional form of
652
T. Heise et al.
 the dose–response relationship, AUCGIR,0–t and GIRmax
were log-transformed and analysed using a non-linear
mixed model, with period as a fixed effect, subject as a
random effect, and a quadratic function of dose on the
original scale as a covariate, depending on treatment. For
each treatment, it was tested if the second-order coeffi-
cient describing the curvature of the dose–response
relationship was statistically different from zero (indi-
cating deviation from dose linearity). Moreover, the
functional form of the dose–response relationship was
compared between treatments by simultaneously testing
if the coefficients describing the dose–response rela-
tionship differed between treatments.
2.5.5 Analysis of Within- and Between-Subject Variability
in Glucose-Lowering Effect
To compare the within- and between-subject variability in
glucose-lowering effect between faster aspart and insulin
aspart,
AUCGIR,0–1h,
AUCGIR,0–2h
(both
post
hoc),
AUCGIR,0–t and GIRmax (both post hoc for between-subject
variability) were analysed separately for the three dose
administrations of faster aspart 0.2 U/kg and insulin aspart
0.2 U/kg. The log-transformed endpoints were analysed
using a linear mixed model, with treatment as a fixed effect
and subject as a random effect, with variance parameters
depending on treatment. Within- and between-subject
coefficient of variations in percent (CV%) were estimated
and compared assuming an F-distribution of the variance
ratio.
2.5.6 Analysis of Relative Bioavailability
In order to assess the relative bioavailability between faster
aspart and insulin aspart combined for all three dose levels,
AUCIAsp,0–t was log-transformed and analysed using a
linear mixed model, with period and treatment as fixed
effects, log-dose as a covariate, and subject as a random
effect. Similar bioavailability for faster aspart and insulin
aspart was claimed if the 90% CI for the treatment ratio
was fully within 0.80–1.25 [18, 19].
2.5.7 Analysis of the Relationship
between Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
In order to investigate the relationship between expo-
sure and glucose-lowering effect for faster aspart,
AUCGIR,0–t
and
GIRmax
were
log-transformed
and
analysed in a linear mixed model, with subject as a
fixed effect and log-AUCIAsp,0–t or log-Cmax, respec-
tively, as a covariate.
3 Results
3.1 Subjects
Of 53 subjects screened, 46 were randomised and treated
and 43 completed the trial (Fig. 1). Two subjects withdrew
consent after three and four dosing visits, respectively, and
one subject was withdrawn after seven dosing visits due to
not being able to attend the next scheduled visit. The mean
(±standard deviation) age of the 46 randomised subjects
was 44.0 (±10.4) years. The majority of subjects were
male (76.1%) and all were White. Mean body weight was
77.4 (±10.8) kg and mean BMI was 24.6 (±2.4) kg/m2.
Mean duration of diabetes was 20.8 (±10.0) years, and
mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.4% (±0.8%). At entry into
the study, 30 subjects were treated with multiple daily
injection therapy and 16 subjects used continuous subcu-
taneous insulin infusion.
3.2 Onset, Early Exposure and Early Glucose-
Lowering Effect
A left-shift of the mean serum insulin aspart concentration–
time profile was observed for faster aspart compared with
insulin aspart at all three dose levels (Fig. 2). Likewise, the
glucose-lowering effect profile was shifted to the left for
faster aspart versus insulin aspart across the three dose
levels (Fig. 3).
Across all three dose levels, onset of appearance
occurred approximately twice as fast for faster aspart
compared with insulin aspart, and tEarly 50% Cmax was also
earlier with faster aspart than with insulin aspart (Fig. 4a
and Online Resource 1, Table S2). Early insulin exposure
was consistently greater for faster aspart than for insulin
aspart within the first 30 min after dosing, irrespective of
dose level, as shown by the greater AUCIAsp,0–15min and
AUCIAsp,0–30min for faster aspart versus insulin aspart
(Fig. 5a).
Onset
of
action
occurred
5–6 min
faster,
and
tEarly 50% GIRmax also occurred earlier, with faster aspart
than with insulin aspart across all three doses (Fig. 4b and
Online Resource 1, Table S3). Early glucose-lowering
effect was consistently greater for faster aspart than for
insulin aspart at all three dose levels, as shown by the
greater partial AUCGIR’s for faster aspart versus insulin
aspart within the first 2 h after dosing, except for
AUCGIR,0–30min and AUCGIR,0–2h at 0.1 U/kg (Fig. 5b).
Estimated means as well as treatment ratios and/or dif-
ferences for faster aspart versus insulin aspart are shown
for all pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints in
Online Resource 1, Tables S2 and S3.

 3.3 Dose–Concentration and Dose–Response
Mean 5-h serum insulin concentration–time profiles for
faster aspart and insulin aspart at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg are
presented in Fig. 6 and show that insulin exposure
increased with increasing dose. Analysis of dose propor-
tionality for faster aspart indicated that the increases in
AUCIAsp,0–t and Cmax with increasing dose of faster aspart
were slightly greater than dose proportional, as the mean
and 95% CIs for the log-dose slopes were 1.21 (1.15–1.26,
p \ 0.001)
for
AUCIAsp,0–t,
and
1.18
(1.10–1.25,
p \ 0.001) for Cmax, i.e. slightly different from 1.00.
However, the same was observed for insulin aspart [1.20
(1.14–1.25),
p \ 0.001,
for
AUCIAsp,0–t;
and
1.08
(1.00–1.16), p = 0.052, for Cmax], and the departures from
dose proportionality did not differ statistically significantly
between faster aspart and insulin aspart for AUCIAsp,0–t
(p = 0.809) or Cmax (p = 0.094). In quantitative terms, a
log-dose slope of 1.21 corresponds to a 12% increase in
total exposure following a 10% increase in the faster aspart
dose.
Mean 5-h glucose infusion rate profiles for faster aspart
and insulin aspart at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg are presented in
Fig. 7 and show that the glucose-lowering effect increased
with increasing dose. The total glucose-lowering effect

 (AUCGIR,0–t) for both faster aspart and insulin aspart was
approximately twice as high at the 0.2 U/kg dose than at
the 0.1 U/kg dose (Table 1). In contrast, AUCGIR,0–t for the
0.4 U/kg dose was only 73% larger than for the 0.2 U/kg
dose level for both faster aspart and insulin aspart, i.e. less
than expected for a doubling of the dose. The estimates of
GIRmax also showed a levelling off with increasing dose for
both treatments (Online Resource 1, Table S3), suggesting
that some subjects approached a maximum plateau of
insulin action at the higher insulin dose of 0.4 U/kg.
Accordingly, analysis of dose linearity indicated that the
increases in AUCGIR,0–t and GIRmax with increasing dose
were slightly less than linear (p \ 0.01 for AUCGIR,0–t, and
p \ 0.001 for GIRmax). The coefficients of the function
describing
the
dose–response
relationship
were
not
statistically significantly different between faster aspart and
insulin aspart for AUCGIR,0–t (p = 0.786) and GIRmax
(p = 0.944).

 aspart (Table 2). Results on between-subject variability for
early, total and maximum glucose-lowering effect are
provided in Online Resource 1, Table S4, and showed no
statistically significant differences between faster aspart
and insulin aspart.
3.5 Relative Bioavailability and Overall Glucose-
Lowering Effect
The estimated treatment ratio and 90% CI of faster aspart
versus insulin aspart for AUCIAsp,0–t for all three dose
levels together were 0.97 (0.94–1.01). Thus, the bioavail-
ability of faster aspart was similar to insulin aspart as the
90% CI for AUCIAsp,0–t was fully within the interval of
0.80–1.25.
AUCGIR,0–t and GIRmax were both comparable for faster
aspart and insulin aspart at all three dose levels, with all
treatment ratios being close to 1.00 (Online Resource 1,
Table S3), suggesting similar total glucose-lowering effects
for faster aspart and insulin aspart when administered at
identical dose levels.
3.6 Relationship between Pharmacokinetics
and Pharmacodynamics
The relationships between total exposure (AUCIAsp,0–t) and
total glucose-lowering effect (AUCGIR,0–t), and between
Cmax and GIRmax, for faster aspart are presented in Online
Resource 1, Fig. S2. From the coefficient of determination
(R2), approximately 50% of the variability in total and
maximum glucose-lowering effect could be explained by
total exposure and maximum concentration, respectively.
3.7 Safety
Both faster aspart and insulin aspart were well tolerated
and no safety issues were observed during the trial. There
were no clinically significant findings in safety laboratory
parameters, vital signs, physical examination or electro-
cardiogram, and no confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes or
injection site reactions occurred during the trial.
4 Discussion
The key finding of this trial was that across three different
clinically relevant dose levels, faster aspart showed faster
onset of exposure and greater early exposure, which led to
faster onset of action and greater early glucose-lowering
effect compared with insulin aspart.
With the left-shift of the pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic time profiles, faster aspart better replicates the
physiological insulin action profile in response to a meal
than insulin aspart. This finding may imply that faster
aspart has the potential to provide clinical benefits over
current rapid-acting insulin analogues in terms of improved
postprandial glucose control in subjects with diabetes.
Indeed, in a phase III study in subjects with T1DM treated
in a basal-bolus regimen, faster aspart showed superiority
over insulin aspart with respect to change from baseline in
2-h postprandial glucose increments in a standardised meal
test [20]. In addition, a statistically significant difference in
favour of faster aspart was observed with respect to change
from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increments.
Consistent with the pharmacodynamic time profiles of
faster aspart versus insulin aspart, the treatment difference
in the meal-test was more pronounced after 1 h than after
2 h [20]. In the same study, HbA1c reduction was shown to
be statistically significantly greater for faster aspart versus
insulin aspart [20]. In another phase III study in subjects
with T2DM treated in a basal-bolus regimen plus met-
formin, the reduction from baseline in 1-h postprandial
glucose increments was statistically significantly greater
for faster aspart versus insulin aspart in a meal-test, while
the difference in the reduction from baseline in 2-h post-
prandial glucose increments in favour of faster aspart did
not reach statistical significance [21]. In that study, non-
inferiority in HbA1c reduction was demonstrated for faster
aspart versus insulin aspart [21]. No statistically significant
differences were observed in overall rate of severe or
confirmed hypoglycaemia in either of the two studies
[20, 21].
Current rapid-acting insulins provide the best possible
prandial glucose control if administered approximately
15 min before the start of the meal to compensate for the
lag time occurring from subcutaneous injection until suf-
ficient insulin has been absorbed into the circulation to
handle the carbohydrate uptake after meal ingestion [7, 8].
Despite this, a lot of patients with diabetes use no, or only a
very limited, injection–meal interval in line with approved

 labelling [9]. The improved pharmacodynamic properties
of faster aspart versus insulin aspart would be expected to
facilitate mealtime dosing, thereby reducing the need for an
injection–meal interval with faster aspart. Moreover, the
pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart may open for
the option of postmeal dosing when needed. Thus, treat-
ment with faster aspart at 20 min postmeal has been
investigated and showed non-inferior HbA1c reduction
versus insulin aspart administered at mealtime in addition
to comparable overall rates of severe and confirmed
hypoglycaemia in subjects with T1DM [20].
In the current study, it is reassuring to observe that the
within-subject variability in early, as well as total, glucose-
lowering effect was at the same low level for faster aspart
as for insulin aspart, being in the range of 18–25%. Insulin
aspart has previously been shown to have a within-subject
variability in glucose-lowering effect of approximately
15–25%, which is comparable to that of regular human
insulin, insulin lispro and insulin glulisine [22–25]. This is
in contrast to the somewhat higher within-subject vari-
ability in glucose-lowering effect of 48–99% reported for
several basal insulin preparations, such as insulin glargine
100 U/mL, neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin and
protaminated insulin lispro [26–28]. At the same time, it is
on par with the within-subject variability of 20 and 27%
shown for insulin degludec and insulin detemir, respec-
tively [26, 27]. With the relatively low variability in glu-
cose-lowering effect of faster aspart between subsequent
administrations, it is anticipated that its faster onset and
greater early exposure and glucose-lowering effect will be
consistent from day to day in clinical practice. Between-
subject variability was also shown to be comparable for
faster aspart and insulin aspart in the current study,
although this is less clinically relevant since insulin should
always be titrated according to individual needs.
We have no immediate explanation for the fact that the
increase in AUCIAsp,0–t and Cmax with increasing dose of
faster aspart was slightly greater than dose proportional.
The same was observed for insulin aspart in the present
study and has also been previously observed for the insulin
aspart component of insulin degludec/insulin aspart [29].
The deviation from dose proportionality observed in the
present study corresponds to a 12% increase in total
exposure and maximum concentration in response to a 10%
increase in the faster aspart dose. Such a minor deviation is
not considered to impose any practical implications in the
clinical setting.
We observed a slight levelling off for both AUCGIR,0–t
and GIRmax when the dose increased from 0.2 to 0.4 U/kg
of faster aspart and insulin aspart. The same has been
observed previously in dose–response studies with regular
human insulin, insulin glulisine and insulin aspart at dose
levels of 0.3–0.35 U/kg, presumably indicating saturation
of glucose-lowering effect in some subjects [30, 31]. Thus,
at dose levels of 0.3–0.4 U/kg, some subjects may
approach their maximum rate of insulin-stimulated glu-
cose disposal, which on average lies in the range of
10–15 mg/kg/min [32, 33]. However, it is important to note
that saturation of glucose-lowering effect is mainly an
experimental phenomenon caused by the fixed-dose levels
administered in a glucose clamp study. In the clinical set-
ting, individual insulin titration should ensure that subjects
remain on the linear part of their insulin dose–response
curve.
In the present study, Cmax for the 0.1 U/kg dose was
slightly lower, and Cmax for the 0.2 U/kg dose was slightly
higher, for faster aspart versus insulin aspart. This implied
that tEarly 50% Cmax for faster aspart relative to insulin aspart
was slightly underestimated at the 0.1 U/kg dose, and
slightly overestimated at the 0.2 U/kg dose [34]. However,
importantly, GIRmax was similar between faster aspart and
insulin aspart at all three dose levels. Therefore, a fully
reliable comparison between treatments was possible for
the
corresponding
pharmacodynamic
endpoint,
tEarly 50% GIRmax, showing a consistently shorter time to
achieve half maximum glucose-lowering effect for faster
aspart versus insulin aspart.
5 Conclusions
In the current study comparing the pharmacological char-
acteristics of faster aspart and insulin aspart in subjects
with T1DM, faster aspart showed faster onset and greater
early insulin exposure and glucose-lowering effect versus
insulin aspart across a clinically relevant dose range. The
ultra-fast-acting properties of faster aspart were consis-
tently observed from day to day. The results of the current
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study appear to trans-
late to the clinical setting as larger phase III trials show that
faster aspart provides clinical benefits over insulin aspart in
terms of improved postprandial glucose control [20, 21].
