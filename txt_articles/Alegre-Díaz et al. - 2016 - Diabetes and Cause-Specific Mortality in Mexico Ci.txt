Abstract
Background—Most large, prospective studies of the effects of diabetes on mortality have 
focused on high-income countries where patients have access to reasonably good medical care and 
can receive treatments to establish and maintain good glycemic control. In those countries, 
diabetes less than doubles the rate of death from any cause. Few large, prospective studies have 
been conducted in middle-income countries where obesity and diabetes have become common and 
glycemic control may be poor.
Methods—From 1998 through 2004, we recruited approximately 50,000 men and 100,000 
women 35 years of age or older into a prospective study in Mexico City, Mexico. We recorded the 
presence or absence of previously diagnosed diabetes, obtained and stored blood samples, and 
tracked 12-year disease-specific deaths through January 1, 2014. We accepted diabetes as the 
underlying cause of death only for deaths that were due to acute diabetic crises. We estimated rate 
ratios for death among participants who had diabetes at recruitment versus those who did not have 
diabetes at recruitment; data from participants who had chronic diseases other than diabetes were 
excluded from the main analysis.
Results—At the time of recruitment, obesity was common and the prevalence of diabetes rose 
steeply with age (3% at 35 to 39 years of age and >20% by 60 years of age). Participants who had 
diabetes had poor glycemic control (mean [±SD] glycated hemoglobin level, 9.0±2.4%), and the 
rates of use of other vasoprotective medications were low (e.g., 30% of participants with diabetes 
were receiving antihypertensive medication at recruitment and 1% were receiving lipid-lowering 
medication). Previously diagnosed diabetes was associated with rate ratios for death from any 
cause of 5.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0 to 6.0) at 35 to 59 years of age, 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 
3.3) at 60 to 74 years of age, and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1) at 75 to 84 years of age. Between 35 and 
74 years of age, the excess mortality associated with previously diagnosed diabetes accounted for 
one third of all deaths; the largest absolute excess risks of death were from renal disease (rate 
ratio, 20.1; 95% CI, 17.2 to 23.4), cardiac disease (rate ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.2 to 4.2), infection 
(rate ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 4.0 to 5.5), acute diabetic crises (8% of all deaths among participants who 
had previously diagnosed diabetes), and other vascular disease (mainly stroke). Little association

 was observed between diabetes and mortality from cirrhosis, cancer, or chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.
Conclusions—In this study in Mexico, a middle-income country with high levels of obesity, 
diabetes was common, glycemic control was poor, and diabetes was associated with a far worse 
prognosis than that seen in high-income countries; it accounted for at least one third of all deaths 
between 35 and 74 years of age. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust and others.)
DIABETES IS INCREASINGLY COMMON IN many countries1,2 and has been found to increase the 
risk of death from a wide range of diseases.3 However, most large studies of diabetes have 
been conducted in high-income countries where patients have access to good medical care 
and can receive treatments to establish and maintain good glycemic control. In a meta-
analysis of 97 prospective studies, which were conducted mainly in high-income countries, 
self-reported diabetes less than doubled the rate of death from any cause.3,4 In contrast, in 
middle-income and low-income countries, where resources to manage diabetes may be more 
limited and vascular-protective medications may be underused,5 the effects of diabetes on 
mortality from other diseases could be substantially larger. In many such countries, the 
prevalence of diabetes has increased considerably over the past few decades.1,2
Mexico is a middle-income country6 that has among the highest prevalences of obesity and 
diabetes in the world,1,7 and among persons with diabetes in Mexico, glycemic control is 
often poor8 and is often not combined with treatment to control other risk factors (e.g., 
blood pressure and cholesterol). We report the findings from a prospective study of the effect 
of diabetes on cause-specific mortality in approximately 150,000 Mexican adults who were 
followed for an average of 12 years.
Methods
Recruitment and Study Oversight
From 1998 through 2004, we visited households within two districts of Mexico City and 
invited all residents 35 years of age or older to participate in a prospective study.9 We 
recorded age, sex, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol intake, smoking 
status, and physical activity), current medications, and medical history (including previously 
diagnosed diabetes). We measured height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences and 
measured blood pressure while the participant was sitting. A 10-ml blood sample was 
obtained from each participant, transported at 4 to 10°C in insulated boxes that contained ice 
packs, refrigerated overnight at 4°C, and then separated the next morning. Plasma and buffy-
coat samples were stored locally at −80°C, then transported on dry ice to Oxford (United 
Kingdom) for long-term storage over liquid nitrogen.
Research ethics approval was obtained from the Mexican Ministry of Health, the Mexican 
National Council for Science and Technology, and the University of Oxford, United 
Kingdom. All the study participants provided written informed consent. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data.

 Glycated Hemoglobin Measurements
Assays of glycated hemoglobin can be performed reliably10 from buffy-coat samples. We 
performed these assays in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17025–
accredited Wolfson Laboratories of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological 
Studies Unit, by means of validated high-performance liquid chromatography with the use 
of HA-8180 analyzers (Arkray) with calibrators traceable to standards specified by the 
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC). The resulting values were expressed 
in IFCC units of millimoles per mole; we then converted the values to Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial (DCCT) glycated hemoglobin percentages by multiplying the number 
of millimoles per mole by 0.0915 and adding 2.15.11
Mortality Follow-up
Death registration in Mexico City is reliable and complete, with almost all adult deaths 
certified medically and with few attributed to unknown causes.12 Deaths were tracked up to 
January 1, 2014, through electronic linkage to the death registry. Deaths of study participants 
that were recorded in the death registry were confirmed by subsequent visits to the 
participants’ homes. All diseases noted on the death certificate are coded in the registry 
according to criteria specified in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
(ICD-10).13 Study clinicians reviewed death certificates and accepted diabetes as the 
underlying cause only for deaths that were considered to be due to acute diabetic crises. For 
all other deaths with any mention of diabetes as an immediate or antecedent cause of death 
(i.e., in Part I of the death certificate), the study clinicians selected an appropriate underlying 
cause other than diabetes.
Statistical Analysis
For the main analyses in this study, the presence of diabetes was defined as a (self-reported) 
previous medical diagnosis of diabetes, the use of antidiabetic medication, or both. We also 
performed sensitivity analyses in which the definition of diabetes was expanded to include a 
baseline glycated hemoglobin level of at least 6.5%. Participants who had received a 
diagnosis of diabetes before 35 years of age and who required insulin at the time of 
recruitment were considered likely to have type 1 diabetes.
The relationship between the presence of diabetes at the time of recruitment and the 
mortality rate was evaluated with the use of a Cox regression model that excluded data from 
participants who had certain other chronic diseases (i.e., chronic kidney disease, ischemic 
heart disease, stroke, cirrhosis, cancer, or emphysema) and from participants for whom any 
covariates were missing. These rate ratios for death were adjusted for the following 
covariates: age at risk (up to ten 5-year age groups), location (two districts), educational 
level (four groups), smoking status (never, former, light, moderate, or heavy), and 
anthropometric characteristics (height, weight, and waist and hip measurements). Rate ratios 
for death were not adjusted for either blood pressure or lipid levels, since these factors could 
themselves be affected by diabetes and adjustment for them would make little difference.3 
Most age-specific analyses combined the rate ratios for men and women (which were 
generally similar).

 In all analyses, we standardized death rates to a uniform age distribution in men and women 
combined by averaging all the age-specific rates in the age range of 35 to 74 years. We 
anticipated that mortality rates among study participants could differ substantially from 
those among other Mexicans. Therefore, to extrapolate our data to Mexico as a whole, we 
estimated absolute disease-specific mortality rates by multiplying all our standardized death 
rates by a common factor so that their total matched the Mexican national death rate for the 
year 2012.14 For each disease category, we used the rate ratio at 35 to 74 years of age to 
calculate the mean mortality rate among the proportions of persons with (p) and without (1 − 
p) diabetes as rate ratio× A and A, respectively, with A calculated such that (p × rate ratio × 
A) + (1 −p) × A equaled the estimated disease-specific national mortality rate. Analyses 
were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute) and the R 
statistical package, version 2.11.1 (www.r-project.org/).
Results
Recruitment
Of 112,333 eligible households visited, 106,059 (94%) yielded a total of 159,755 potential 
study participants. Of these potential participants, 8135 had a history of ischemic heart 
disease, stroke, cancer, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney 
disease and the data from these participants were therefore excluded from our analyses of 
rate ratios; the data from an additional 5574 participants were excluded from our analyses 
either because data were missing or because the participants were 85 years of age or older at 
the time of recruitment. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the remaining 146,046 
participants at the time of recruitment.
Self-Reported Diabetes Status and Glycated Hemoglobin at Recruitment
The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes among men and women combined 
increased steeply with age, from 3% at 35 to 39 years of age to greater than 20% by 60 years 
of age (Fig. 1). The mean (±SD) time from the diagnosis of diabetes to the time of 
recruitment was 7±6 years among persons 35 to 59 years of age, 11±8 years among persons 
60 to 74 years of age, and 13±9 years among persons 75 to 84 years of age (Table 1). Most 
participants with diabetes had type 2 diabetes, because only 1% had received a diagnosis of 
diabetes before 35 years of age and required insulin. Among all participants with previously 
diagnosed diabetes, approximately two thirds reportedly used a sulfonylurea, approximately 
one fifth used a biguanide, and approximately 80% used at least some antidiabetic 
medication.
Baseline glycated hemoglobin levels were available for 142,101 participants (97%) (Table 
1). Among those with previously diagnosed diabetes at the time of recruitment, 36% of 
participants had a baseline glycated hemoglobin level of greater than 10.0%, and the mean 
glycated hemoglobin level was 9.0% (and was even higher among younger participants) 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). By contrast, the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level among participants 
without previously diagnosed diabetes was 5.6%, with only 5.8% of the participants having

 a level of at least 6.5% (which would indicate undiagnosed diabetes) and 1.5% having a 
level of greater than 10.0%.
There was little difference in body-mass index between participants with and participants 
without previously diagnosed diabetes (Table 1). However, among participants without 
diabetes, body-mass index at the time of recruitment was strongly predictive of incident 
diabetes during follow-up, as indicated by its strong relationship with the prevalence of 
diabetes in a subgroup of survivors who were resurveyed from 2015 through 2016 (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Diabetes and Rates of Death from Any Cause
Over the course of approximately 12 years of follow-up, 9674 deaths from all causes 
occurred between 35 and 84 years of age among participants who had no known disease 
other than diabetes before recruitment. Figure 1 shows the rate ratios for death from any 
cause among participants with versus participants without previously diagnosed diabetes, 
according to sex and age group. These rate ratios for death, which were similar for men and 
women, were 5.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0 to 6.0) at 35 to 59 years of age, 3.1 
(95% CI, 2.9 to 3.3) at 60 to 74 years of age, and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1) at 75 to 84 years 
of age. The age-specific rate ratios were similar in the two study districts (data not shown).
Table 2 shows the excess number of deaths before 75 years of age associated with diabetes 
that had been diagnosed before recruitment. Although previously diagnosed diabetes 
represents a crude measure of exposure to diabetes and does not include the effects of 
diabetes with onset during follow-up, the excess risk associated with previously diagnosed 
diabetes still accounted for 30% of all deaths. When the definition of diabetes at the time of 
recruitment was broadened to include all participants who had a glycated hemoglobin level 
of at least 6.5% (i.e., to include participants who had diabetes that was undiagnosed), the 
percentage of all deaths accounted for by the excess risk associated with diabetes increased 
from 30% to 35% (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Diabetes and Disease-Specific Mortality
Figure 2 lists the rate ratios for several underlying causes of death between 35 and 84 years 
of age (for additional details on the specific causes of death, see Figs. S2 through S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Among participants in whom diabetes was diagnosed before 
recruitment, 301 of the 3786 deaths (8%) were from acute diabetic crises. In addition, 92 
deaths due to acute diabetic crises occurred among participants who did not have previously 
diagnosed diabetes (median baseline glycated hemoglobin among these participants, 6.1%). 
Thus, approximately three quarters of the deaths that were attributed to acute diabetic crises 
during the 12-year follow-up period occurred among participants in whom diabetes had been 
diagnosed before recruitment.
Likewise, with respect to mortality from the aggregate of all renal disease, 1032 deaths 
occurred among participants with previously diagnosed diabetes and 390 deaths occurred 
among those without previously diagnosed diabetes; thus, approximately three quarters of 
the deaths from renal disease during the 12-year follow-up period occurred among persons 
who had a diagnosis of diabetes before recruitment. The rate ratios for death from renal

 disease among patients with previously diagnosed diabetes were 31.1 (95% CI, 24.2 to 39.8) 
at 35 to 59 years of age, 13.9 (95% CI, 11.5 to 16.9) at 60 to 74 years of age, and 5.1 (95% 
CI, 4.1 to 6.3) at 75 to 84 years of age.
Apart from acute diabetic crises and renal disease, the conditions associated with the largest 
rate ratios for death were cardiac disease, cerebrovascular and other vascular disease, and 
infection. All involved similar age-specific rate ratios, which were more extreme at younger 
ages (and virtually identical for men and women; data not shown).
Diabetes was also strongly associated with mortality from peptic ulcer disease but was not 
associated with mortality from cirrhosis (which in most cases was alcoholic cirrhosis). There 
was little association between diabetes and death from chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, death from cancer as a whole, or death from particular types of cancer (Fig. S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), although with respect to death from particular types of 
cancer, the finding should be interpreted with caution, given the limited number of deaths 
from cancer in this study.
Overall, between 35 and 74 years of age, the excess risk of death associated with diabetes 
accounted for approximately one third of all deaths from vascular causes and one third of all 
other deaths. The analyses of mortality were not affected materially when they were 
repeated without adjustment for smoking status, level of education, and anthropometric 
characteristics; when they were repeated with additional adjustment for alcohol intake, 
physical activity, and blood pressure; when they were repeated with inclusion of data from 
participants who had a previously diagnosed disease other than diabetes or with exclusion of 
data from the first 5 years of follow-up (data not shown); or when the disease-specific 
outcome used in the analyses was death from the disease of interest mentioned anywhere in 
Part I of the death certificate (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Estimates of Absolute Mortality
Figure 3 shows absolute estimated disease-specific mortality rates, standardized to national 
mortality rates in Mexico for the year 2012, among persons with and persons without 
previously diagnosed diabetes (see the Statistical Analysis section). Between 35 and 74 
years of age, the absolute excess risk of death associated with diabetes was greatest for renal 
disease, followed by cardiac disease, infection, acute diabetic crises, and the aggregate of all 
other vascular diseases (mainly stroke).
Discussion
Diabetes is more common15 and has a much larger effect on mortality in Mexico than in 
major high-income countries.3,4,16 By 60 to 74 years of age, approximately one quarter of 
the participants in the current study had received a medical diagnosis of diabetes, as 
compared with approximately 7% in the United Kingdom17 and approximately 15% in the 
United States15 at the time of our baseline survey, and even after adjustment for other risk 
factors, the rate of death from any cause between 35 and 74 years of age was approximately 
four times as high among participants with diabetes as among those without diabetes. In 
contrast, meta-analyses of prospective studies from mostly high-income countries showed 
Alegre-Díaz et al.

 that persons with diabetes had less than twice the rate of death from any cause as those 
without diabetes.3
A probable explanation for our more marked rate ratios for deaths from any cause is 
inadequate medical care, including poor glycemic control.18,19 More than one third of 
participants with diabetes diagnosed before recruitment had a baseline glycated hemoglobin 
level of greater than 10.0%, as compared with only approximately 5% of persons with 
diagnosed diabetes in cohorts from high-income countries.3,16,20 Furthermore, 8% of all 
deaths among persons with previously diagnosed diabetes in the current study were due to 
acute diabetic crises, as compared with less than 1% of deaths among persons with diabetes 
in the United States.21 In contrast to previous studies,3 our rate ratios for deaths from any 
cause were similar in men and women, which perhaps reflects similar glycemic control and 
duration of diabetes (Table 1).
A key feature of our study is that the study clinicians reviewed all death certificates, which 
contained detailed information about the sequence of events leading up to death.22 World 
Health Organization conventions for assigning the underlying cause of death attribute to 
diabetes all deaths from vascular and renal diseases if diabetes was mentioned anywhere in 
Part I of the death certificate.13 This coding system can result in the undercounting of deaths 
from vascular and renal disease among persons with diabetes, which in turn can result in 
artificially low rate ratios for death for the associations of diabetes with these diseases. 
Hence, in the current study, we accepted diabetes as the underlying cause only for deaths 
that occurred during acute diabetic crises. Our comparisons of study participants with versus 
without previously diagnosed diabetes at recruitment therefore yielded appropriately large 
rate ratios for death from vascular and, particularly, renal disease. Our coding conventions 
do not, of course, affect the rate ratios for deaths from any cause, which are also large.
Our study has certain limitations. First, we cannot rule out some residual confounding. 
Second, our study is not representative of Mexico as a whole. The participation rate in the 
study was high, however, so the study should be reasonably representative of the adults who 
were contacted at home (two thirds of whom were women) in the two study districts. In 
addition, our baseline estimates of the prevalence of diabetes are similar to those obtained by 
a large national survey in Mexico that was conducted at approximately the same time.23 
Moreover, in subsequent nationally representative 2006 and 2012 surveys of Mexican adults, 
glycemic control among persons with diagnosed diabetes was even worse than that reported 
in our study8; therefore, our estimates of the importance of diabetes to mortality in Mexico 
as a whole may even be slightly low. As in many prospective studies,3 we did not check self-
reports of medically diagnosed diabetes against medical records, but the glycated 
hemoglobin findings (and high rate ratios for deaths from any cause) suggest that such 
reports were reasonably reliable, with generally normal glycated hemoglobin levels among 
persons who reported no diabetes.
Sensitivity analyses in which the definition of diabetes was broadened to include all 
participants with a glycated hemoglobin level of at least 6.5% at baseline showed a higher 
percentage of all deaths accounted for by diabetes than the percentage reported in the main 
analysis (35% vs. 30%). Furthermore, the additional inclusion of deaths related to the effects 
Alegre-Díaz et al.

 of diabetes diagnosed after recruitment would result in an even higher percentage of deaths 
accounted for by diabetes (perhaps approximately 40%; for example, 15% of the deaths 
from acute diabetic crises occurred in persons who did not have previously diagnosed 
diabetes and who had a baseline glycated hemoglobin level of less than 6.5%).
The greatest absolute excess risks of death associated with diabetes were from renal disease 
(primarily chronic kidney disease), vascular disease, infection, and acute diabetic crises. 
Assuming causality, approximately three quarters of the deaths between 35 and 74 years of 
age among Mexicans with diabetes were due (directly or indirectly) to their diabetes. Age-
specific mortality rates correlated with the duration of diabetes (data not shown), so the 
lifetime hazard would be even greater for persons in whom diabetes develops in early adult 
life rather than in later adult life. Overall, we estimate that diabetes was a direct or indirect 
cause of at least one third of all deaths between 35 and 74 years of age in our study, which is 
double the indirect estimates for Mexico that relied on rate ratios for death from studies in 
other countries.1,24 In addition to their relevance to Mexico, our results are relevant to many 
other populations worldwide, including many millions of U.S. Mexican Americans, among 
whom the prevalence of diabetes is twice as high as that among U.S. non-Hispanic white 
persons15 and glycemic control is worse.20
In Mexico, the aggregate of mortality rates from vascular disease, diabetes, and renal disease 
between 35 and 74 years of age increased slowly from 1998 to 2008, a period during which 
rates declined steeply in the United States (Fig. S9 and S10 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). When recruitment into this study ended in 2004, half of all Mexican adults had 
no health insurance, but during the course of the next 8 years, health care provision 
improved substantially with the introduction of Seguro Popular,25 which, during the period 
from 2004 through 2012, extended health insurance nationwide.26 In 2008, mortality rates 
from vascular, diabetic, and renal disease in Mexico began to decrease, which perhaps 
reflected better health care provision.8 Nevertheless, mortality rates remain high, as does the 
prevalence of diabetes.1,8
In this middle-income country, the large excess mortality associated with diabetes reflected 
both the high prevalence of diabetes, which is partly due to widespread obesity that affects 
the incidence of diabetes, and the poor prognosis associated with diabetes, which is partly 
due to inadequate treatment of diabetes, associated risk factors,8 and diabetic complications. 
Poor glycemic control increases the risk of microvascular disease,27 but during the period of 
our study, regular testing for albuminuria was rare8 and renal-replacement therapy was 
limited. Thus, persons with chronic kidney disease often had poor outcomes.28
Mexico recently introduced its National Strategy for Overweight, Obesity and Diabetes, 
which includes health education, improved opportunities for exercise, taxation of sugary 
drinks and high-calorie foods, and earlier identification and monitoring of risk factors, 
including diabetes.29 Within a year after the introduction of this new national strategy, 
preliminary data suggested that the consumption of sugary drinks had diminished.30 
However, despite whatever is achieved in the next few decades by lifestyle interventions 
(e.g., with respect to adiposity, exercise, and smoking),29–32 diabetes will still affect many 
people in Mexico and will require treatment to reduce the risk of premature death.

 Health care delivery can target both diabetes itself and other determinants of the risk of 
death or disability from the many different diseases that diabetes can cause.27,33–35 In this 
middle-income country with a high prevalence of overweight and obesity and with 
insufficient control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, diabetes was a 
cause of at least one third of all deaths between 35 and 74 years of age (twice the current 
indirect estimates for Mexico),1,24 with the excess mortality attributed chiefly to renal 
disease, vascular disease, infection, and acute diabetic crises.

 Figure 1. Prevalence of Previously Diagnosed Diabetes and Its Relevance to Rates of Death from 
Any Cause during 12-Year Follow-up.
Panel A shows the prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes among all study participants. 
I bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The dashed lines indicate the age at which the 
prevalence of diabetes was 20%. Panel B shows the rate ratios for death from any cause 
among participants with and participants without previously diagnosed diabetes at 
recruitment. The rate ratios for death exclude data from any participants who had previously 
diagnosed chronic disease other than diabetes (chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart 
disease, stroke, cirrhosis, cancer, or emphysema) and are adjusted for standard features (age, 
smoking status, district, educational level, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences). 
The size of each square is proportional to the amount of data available, and unshaded 
diamonds represent the values for men and women combined. Horizontal lines represent 
95% confidence intervals.

Shown are the numbers of deaths and disease-specific rate ratios for death among 
participants with versus participants without previously diagnosed diabetes at recruitment, 
according to age group and to the disease to which the participant’s death was attributed. 
The rate ratios for death exclude data from any participants who had previously diagnosed

 not shown for deaths attributed to acute diabetic crises because all such deaths were due to 
diabetes, irrespective of whether diabetes was diagnosed before recruitment. The size of 
each square is proportional to the amount of data available. Horizontal lines represent 95% 
confidence intervals. Of the 393 participants who died from an acute diabetic crisis, baseline 
glycated hemoglobin levels were available for 389 participants, of whom 332 (85%) either 
had diabetes diagnosed before recruitment or had a baseline glycated hemoglobin level of at 
least 6.5% and 57 (15%) had no diagnosis of diabetes before recruitment and had a baseline 
glycated hemoglobin level of less than 6.5%. Numerical values for the rate ratios may vary 
slightly from the position of the squares because of rounding.

 Figure 3. Mortality Rates for Each Cause of Death Among Participants with and Participants 
without Previously Diagnosed Diabetes.
Shown are the absolute estimated disease-specific rates of deaths according to the cause of 
death among persons with and persons without previously diagnosed diabetes. The analysis 
combines the percentages of participants in the current study who died between 35 and 74 
years of age from particular diseases, the disease-specific rate ratios for death at 35 to 74 
years of age, and 2012 national mortality rates in Mexico. The rates for all bars sum to the 
rates of death from any cause. The unshaded portions of the bars represent the mortality rate 
for the specific cause of death among participants without previously diagnosed diabetes. 
The shaded portions of the bars represent excess risk of death that was either associated with 
previously diagnosed diabetes or that was due to acute diabetic crises. The weighted average 
of the death rates shown (for 16% of persons with diabetes plus 84% of persons without 
diabetes) match uniformly age-standardized 2012 Mexican national rates at 35 to 74 years of 
age for 50% men plus 50% women. Infective diseases include peptic ulcer disease and 
exclude any infection in another plotted category. For stroke alone, annual rates of death

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Differences between men with diabetes and men without diabetes were significant (P<0.05) for all 
characteristics except waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, and the use of antithrombotic medication. All differences between women with 
diabetes and women without diabetes were significant except for body-mass index and hip circumference. Analyses excluded data from participants 
with previously diagnosed chronic disease (chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke, cirrhosis, cancer, or emphysema). IQR denotes 
interquartile range, and NA not applicable.
†At recruitment, we recorded only the decade of diagnosis of diabetes; mean duration of diabetes was estimated by assuming each diagnosis date to 
be in the middle of its possible range.
‡These factors were considered to be indicative of type 1 diabetes.
§Glycated hemoglobin assays are available for 97% of participants.
¶Glycated hemoglobin values that indicate no diabetes are nonnormally distributed, with many being several standard deviations above the median. 
Values of at least 6.5% indicate undiagnosed diabetes; values greater than 9.0% reflect poor glycemic control. (Mean glycated hemoglobin was 
8.4%, 9.1%, and 9.5% among participants who reported taking 0, 1, or at least 2 antidiabetic medications, respectively, but adherence to medication 
is unknown.)
‖Among participants with previously diagnosed diabetes, the percentage with a glycated hemoglobin level of greater than 10.0% was 44% among 
persons 35 to 44 years of age, 44% among persons 45 to 54 years of age, 37% among persons 55 to 64 years of age, 27% among persons 65 to 74 
years of age, and 19% among persons 75 to 84 years of age.
**Iztapalapa is a poorer district than Coyoacán.
††Values were standardized to the age distribution of all men and women without chronic disease (other than diabetes) at recruitment.
‡‡The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
§§Some participants were receiving more than one antihypertensive medication.

*Plus–minus values are means ±SE.
†Estimates of age-specific rate ratios for death among participants with diabetes at recruitment versus participants without diabetes at recruitment 
were adjusted for age, sex, district, educational level, smoking status, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences. Analyses excluded data 
from participants with a previous diagnosis of chronic kidney disease or ischemic heart disease, stroke, cirrhosis, cancer, or emphysema.
‡When the definition of diabetes was expanded to include participants who had undiagnosed diabetes (glycated hemoglobin level ≥6.5%) at 
recruitment, the percentage of all deaths associated with diabetes increased to 35% (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The attributable 
fraction is approximately one third for both deaths from vascular disease and the aggregate of all other deaths. (This value still excludes any deaths 
due to diabetes with an onset after recruitment among persons with a glycated hemoglobin level <6.5% at recruitment.)
