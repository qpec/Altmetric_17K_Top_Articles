Zika virus (family Flaviviridae) is an emerging arbovirus. Spread by Aedes mosquitoes, it was
first discovered in Uganda in 1947, and later in humans elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa,
arriving in south-east Asia at latest by the mid-twentieth century. In the twenty-first century,
it spread across the Pacific islands reaching South America around 2014. Since then it has
spread rapidly northwards reaching Mexico in November 2015. Its clinical profile is that of a
dengue-like febrile illness, but associations with Guillain–Barre
´ syndrome and microcephaly
have appeared recently. The final geographical range and ultimate clinical impact of Zika virus
are still a matter for speculation.
Introduction
Zika virus (family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus) is a positive-
sense ssRNA arbovirus within a family that includes several
other arboviruses of major clinical importance, such as
Yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Tick-borne encephalitis
virus and Dengue virus. First isolated in 1947 in the Zika
forest region of Uganda from a Macaca monkey (Dick
et al., 1952), the first human case was detected in Nigeria
in 1954 (MacNamara, 1954). The arthropod vectors are
several mosquitoes of the genus Aedes (Diagne et al.,
2015). Both urban (Grard et al., 2014) and sylvatic (Berthet
et al., 2014) transmission have been demonstrated. Epizoo-
tics occur in monkeys (McCrae & Kirya, 1982), but it is
unclear as yet whether primates are an obligatory reservoir
in the transmission cycle in humans.
The classic clinical presentation resembles dengue fever,
but also chikungunya: a fever accompanied by polyarthral-
gia, myalgia, maculopapular rash and headache. This com-
plicates differential diagnosis. Serological testing can,
however, distinguish Zika virus infection from that of
dengue and chikungunya (Aubry et al., 2015). The virus
remained one of the many neglected curiosities of tropical
medicine, and no efforts were made to develop a vaccine or
treatment in view of its low case numbers and low clinical
impact relative to other arboviruses. This situation changed
in the twenty-first century, first with the large-scale
outbreaks in the Pacific islands, beginning on Yap in
Micronesia in 2007 (Lanciotti et al., 2008) and then with
the emergence of the first Zika virus disease cases in
Brazil in early 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015). Zika virus also
began to spread northwards at a rapid rate across South
and Central America, reaching Mexico by late November
2015 (ECDC, 2015).
Zika virus genome
The positive-strand RNA genome organization of the virus
follows that of related flaviviruses: 59-C–prM–E–NS1–
NS2A–NS2B–NS3–NS4A–NS4B–NS5-39 (Kuno & Chang,
2007), with one single ORF encoding the structural pro-
teins C, M and E, and the non-structural proteins which
carry out functions in replication and assembly. In all like-
lihood, antagonism of host responses will be mediated by
one or several of these non-structural proteins. The 59
and 39 untranslated regions are important in flavivirus
genome
cyclization
and
replication
with
conserved
sequences (CS1–3) found in related flaviviruses. Kuno &
Chang (2007) identified variation in CS1 and CS3 of
Zika virus strain MR 766 (order CS3–CS2–CS1) and this
should be further investigated when more sequencing
data become available, as it may influence replication,
and possibly virus–host interactions and pathogenicity.
Phylogenetics, evolution and epidemiology
Analysis of the origins of what is now apparent as a pan-
demic of Zika virus has been largely retrospective, based
on sequencing of isolates collected across Africa and
south-east Asia during the course of the twentieth century
(Faye et al., 2014). Only with the arrival of Zika virus in the
Pacific islands (Lanciotti et al., 2008) did more systematic
sequencing efforts commence and the first full-length
genome was obtained (Kuno & Chang, 2007). Twenty-
one full-length Zika virus genomes are currently available
in GenBank and nine of those have collection date infor-
mation in their GenBank record. A phylogenetic tree
reconstructed using these is shown in Fig. 1(a), illustrating
the emergence of the south-east Asian strain from Africa

and the subsequent seeding of the Pacific islands epidemic
from south-east Asia, as shown elsewhere (Buathong et al.,
2015); the wider relationship of Zika virus to other
flaviviruses is shown in Fig. 1(b). Active tracking of the
spread of Zika virus across the Pacific and into the
Americas, and sequencing of older clinical isolates, have
produced a total of 215 Zika virus sequences in GenBank,
although many are short fragments.
Phylogenetic studies using these sequences (Faye et al.,
2014) have nevertheless enabled the date of emergence of
Zika virus in East Africa to be estimated at 1920, with a
confidence range on this date of 1892–1947. Serological
surveys carried out in Uganda in the wake of the initial dis-
covery of the virus in the late 1940s showed seropositivity of
6.1% in humans (Dick et al., 1952). However, by the late
1960s, Kenya demonstrated seropositivity to Zika virus at
52% overall but with wide variation between areas (Geser
et al., 1970). Levels of seropositivity were lower in Nigeria
during the late 1960s (Moore et al., 1975), but had risen
to 56% by 1980 (Adekolu-John & Fagbami, 1983). Zika
virus has subsequently been reported across a wide range
in Central and West Africa, with some examples referenced
here (Berthet et al., 2014; Grard et al., 2014).
The same phylogenetic study (Faye et al., 2014) also dated
the transmission of East African Zika virus to south-east
Asia around 1945 (confidence range 1920–1960), where
the virus was first detected in the late 1960s in Malaysia
(Marchette et al., 1969) and subsequently across south-
east Asia. Various phylogenetic analyses have confirmed
that Pacific island Zika virus is related to the Asian lineages
(e.g. Alera et al., 2015; Buathong et al., 2015) (see Fig. 1).
The first appearance of Zika virus in this new eastward
movement was on the Micronesian island of Yap in 2007
(Duffy et al., 2009; Lanciotti et al., 2008). Confounding
factors in establishing the exact dates of dispersion of
Zika virus are the ease with which Zika virus disease can
be confused with dengue fever and chikungunya fever.
The next Pacific outbreak occurred in French Polynesia in
2013 (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014) and was associated with
42 cases of Guillain–Barre
´ syndrome (Roth et al., 2014).
The observation that blood samples collected from 2011
to 2013 had only 0.8% seropositivity to Zika virus suggests
that the introduction to Polynesia was not long before the
identification of the index case (Aubry et al., 2015). The
scale of the Polynesian outbreak was unprecedented, with
28000 infections recorded in the first 4 months. Further

phylogenetic analyses (e.g. Alera et al., 2015; Buathong
et al., 2015) showed Polynesian Zika virus to be more
closely related to the south-east Asian strains than to the
Yap Island outbreak sequences, suggesting an independent
introduction to Polynesia from south-east Asia. Subsequent
spread in the Pacific occurred in 2014 to New Caledonia
(Dupont-Rouzeyrol et al., 2015), the Cook Islands (Pyke
et al., 2014) and Easter Island (Tognarelli et al., 2015).
Transmission to the Americas appears to have originated
in the Pacific Islands, a conclusion again based on
phylogenetic analysis (Zanluca et al., 2015). The Brazilian
state of Bahia was the first to identify cases (Campos
et al., 2015). An official announcement by the Brazilian
Ministry of Health was made on 14 May 2015, but patients
with Zika symptoms had been reported in the city of
Salvador from 15 February 2015 onwards. By 10 December
2015, Zika virus had spread to 18 other Brazilian states
(ECDC, 2015). Two events that may have led to Zika
virus’s introduction to Brazil are the 2014 FIFA World
Cup tournament and an international canoe-racing event
(Musso, 2015). As Pacific nations were only represented
among the canoe racers, the latter may be the likeliest
introduction point.
The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently
issued alerts to the presence of Zika virus in several Latin
American
countries:
Colombia,
Surinam,
Guatemala,
El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Venezuela and Panama.
The pandemic of Zika virus, drawing on empirical reports
of seropositivity, genome sequences with collection infor-
mation, phylogenetic analyses and WHO reports for the
American stages, is shown in Fig. 2.
Clinical presentation of American Zika virus
The African form of Zika virus replicated many of the
symptoms often associated with arboviruses. The 2007 out-
break in Micronesia presented with rash, fever, arthralgia
and conjunctivitis as the most common symptoms, and
headache, vomiting and oedema in a minority. The disease
is acute but self-limiting. Symptoms across six case clusters
from 1962–2010 are reviewed by Heang et al. (2012). The
observation of Guillain–Barre
´
syndrome among Zika
cases in Polynesia represented an increase in the potential
clinical severity of the disease (Roth et al., 2014).
On 21 November 2015, the WHO notified the presence of
739 cases of microcephaly in nine states of north-
eastern Brazil (http://www.who.int/csr/don/27-november-
2015-microcephaly/en/), the same region as the Zika
virus outbreak in that country. The association has not
yet been demonstrated directly, but has been integrated
into risk assessments by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control; additionally three deaths from
Zika virus disease (one newborn, one 16-year-old and
one adult) have been reported, the first known occurrences
(ECDC, 2015). The strong possibility exists of sexual trans-
mission in two cases (Foy et al., 2011; Musso et al., 2015),

perinatal transmission in two cases (Besnard et al., 2014)
and a theoretical possibility of transmission by transfusion
based on the presence of virus in 3% of asymptomatic
Polynesian blood donors (Musso et al., 2014). Such obser-
vations suggest that Zika virus, once introduced from an
area of arboviral transmission, could lead in some cases
to disease even in the absence of vector-based transmission.
Conclusions and future prospects
Any country in which mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are
present could be a potential site for future Zika virus
disease outbreaks. This might include southern Europe
and the USA, where Aedes albopictus has been spreading
invasively but other competent species may also be present.
Introductions

occurred
on

Competence studies are required in vulnerable regions in

be
accelerated.
Moreover, precautions need to be taken to avoid the
pathogen entering public blood banks.
