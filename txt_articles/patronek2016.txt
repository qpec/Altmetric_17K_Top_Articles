Abstract 
15 
Use of behavior evaluations for shelter dogs has progressed despite their lack of 
16 
scientific validation as reliable diagnostic tools, and results of these evaluations are 
17 
often used to make life-and-death decisions. Despite acknowledging the significant 
18 
limitations of evaluations, most authors suggest that the solution is to continue to 
19 
attempt to remedy deficiencies. We take a contrary position, and use existing data and 
20 
principles of diagnostic test evaluation to demonstrate how reliably predicting 
21 
problematic behaviors in future adoptive homes is vanishingly unlikely, even in theory, 
22 
much less under the logistical constraints of real world implementation of these 
23 
evaluations in shelters. To do this, we explain why it would be difficult, if not impossible, 
24 
to calculate robust values for sensitivity and specificity of a shelter canine behavior 
25 
evaluation as required for any valid diagnostic test. We further explain the 
26 
consequences of disregarding the impact of prevalence on the predictive value of a 
27 
positive test (e.g., eliciting biting or warning behavior from the dog in the behavior 
28 
evaluation). Finally, we mathematically demonstrate why, for any plausible combination 
29 
of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence of biting and warning behaviors, a positive test 
30 
would at best be not much better than flipping a coin, and often be much worse, 
31 
because many of the dogs who test positive will be false positives. Shelters already 
32 
screen out from adoption obviously dangerous dogs during the intake process. 
33 
Subsequent provocative testing of the general population of shelter dogs is predicated 
34 
on an assumption of risk that is far in excess of existing data and relies on assumptions 
35 
about dog behavior that may not be supportable. We suggest that instead of striving to 
36 
 MANUSCRIPT

3 
bring out the worst in dogs in the stressful and transitional environment of a shelter and 
37 
devoting scarce resources to inherently flawed formal evaluations that do not increase 
38 
public safety, it may be far better for dogs, shelters, and communities if that effort was 
39 
spent maximizing opportunities to interact with dogs in normal and enjoyable ways (e.g., 
40 
walking, socializing with people, playgroups with other dogs, games, training). These 
41 
activities are likelier to identify any additional dogs whose behavior may be of concern, 
42 
will enrich dogs’ lives and minimize the adverse impact of being relinquished and 
43 
confined to a shelter, be more indicative of the typical personality and behavior of dogs, 
44 
and may help make dogs better candidates for adoption.

Introduction 
49 
Use of formal canine behavior evaluations in animal shelters as a way to assess 
50 
propensity for various undesirable behaviors in dogs prior to making them available for 
51 
adoption to the public has been going on for more than 2 decades. The first published 
52 
report of a behavior evaluation of shelter dogs appeared in the literature in 1991 (Van 
53 
der Borg et al., 1991), and various other instruments have been developed since 
54 
(Haverbeke et al., 2015). These range from very systematic batteries of tests designed 
55 
by individuals credentialed in animal behavior, to ad-hoc procedures developed by 
56 
shelter staff members, to impromptu combinations of both that have been modified 
57 
and adapted according to the preferences of different users. Although each evaluation is 
58 
different, they generally include exposing dogs to a series of provocative stimuli (tests) 
59 
in a semi-controlled environment in order to determine whether behaviors such as 
60 
growling, snarling, snapping, lunging or biting can be elicited, sometimes along with 
61 
other behaviors that might prove either problematic or even desirable (e.g., trainability) 
62 
in an adoptive home. In our experience, the resources required to conduct these 
63 
evaluations are substantial, and shelters may rely upon the results to make life-and-
64 
death decisions for dogs, so the consequences are significant for all involved. 
65 
The extent of use of formal canine behavior evaluations is unknown, but results from 
66 
one on-line convenience sample of mostly small, private sheltering organizations 
67 
indicated that about 25% of the organizations used one, with most of those (60%) using 
68 
a test of their own design (D’Arpino et al., 2012). Large, public shelters however were 
69 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
5 
very underrepresented in that sample. Although we have no systematic information 
70 
either on why shelters came to adopt this practice or their current reasons for 
71 
maintaining it, anecdotal reports among people involved in shelter work suggest that 
72 
they originally emanated from a desire to protect the public from potentially dangerous 
73 
dogs. In some cases, this has grown to include making the best match between dogs and 
74 
adopters or trying to identify behavioral issues that may require attention while in the 
75 
shelter. Another underlying motivation may be to remove or mitigate some of the 
76 
emotional stress on shelter staff when confronted with making euthanasia decisions in 
77 
order to make space for incoming dogs. In these situations, the behavior evaluation 
78 
process could provide the appearance of a less arbitrary, more justifiable rationale than 
79 
number of days in the shelter or workers’ opinions about which dogs would be more 
80 
attractive to adopters. It is also possible that shelter staff or board members may have 
81 
been influenced by reports in the medical, veterinary, and behavioral literature in which 
82 
dog bites frequently are framed as an epidemic (despite declines of about 90% in 
83 
reports of dog bites from the 1970’s through the 2000’s) (NCRC, undated). Numerous 
84 
published reports about reasons for relinquishment of dogs to shelters may also have 
85 
contributed to an impression that shelter dogs are “damaged goods”, somehow 
86 
markedly different from owned dogs. This would be unfortunate, since data indicate 
87 
that human-related factors such as housing, cost of care and/or veterinary treatment, 
88 
and family problems are important contributors to relinquishment (Weiss et al., 2015; 
89 
see Coe et al., 2014 for a comprehensive review). Furthermore, being relinquished for a 
90 
manageable problem (e.g., housetraining) likely reflects more on the owner’s 
91 
 MANUSCRIPT

6 
commitment and ability than on the dog. The desire on the part of shelters to avoid 
92 
liability may also play a role, but the question is one that needs study.a  
93 
How do we begin to evaluate the merits of canine behavior evaluations in shelters as 
94 
valid diagnostic instruments? The goal of a clinical diagnostic is to determine whether or 
95 
not a subject has a particular condition or trait. This is seldom straightforward for any 
96 
diagnostic test, as there is not always a clear biological “black and white” cutpoint for an 
97 
individual who is positive or negative for a condition. It is even more challenging for a 
98 
condition requiring a subjective assessment. A good example is the radiology literature, 
99 
where studies have shown that agreement about the diagnosis of a physical condition or 
100 
disease state on a radiograph at a single point in time is far from perfect, even among 
101 
seasoned specialists working under ideal conditions (e.g., Arealis et al., 2014; Khan et al., 
102 
2011; Matsunaga et al., 2009). For a canine behavior evaluation, ‘diagnosis’ would 
103 
involve ascertaining not only whether a dog did or did not exhibit a behavior of interest 
104 
on one or more tests in the shelter but that the behavior, if it occurred, constituted a 
105 
stable trait that would be expressed in other contexts and that it posed a danger. In the 
106 
unlikely case that the first of these conditions could achieve reliability, the other two 
107 
remain entirely speculative. 
108 
                                                        
a Interestingly, legal experts have not come to an agreement about what effect 
performing such an evaluation would have on a shelter’s liability in the event of a bite. 
They have, however, identified several strategies to reduce liability, such as being sure 
that ownership of the dog is transferred at the time of adoption and disclosing any 
information the shelter has regarding prior behavior (Lutz, 2009).

A large body of science has developed around the principles of developing, assessing, 
109 
validating, and using diagnostic tests. The formulas and principles for evaluating key 
110 
attributes of diagnostic tests (sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive test, 
111 
predictive value of a negative test) are well-established and fairly straightforward. 
112 
However the process of doing so is complicated and costly, and it is unsurprising that no 
113 
behavior evaluation for shelter dogs has yet been scientifically validated. Given the 
114 
resource-constrained environments of animal shelters, and a sincere desire to adopt 
115 
best practices when possible, promotion and use of behavior evaluations for shelter 
116 
dogs has progressed well ahead of their scientific validation as a reliable diagnostic tool. 
117 
Indeed, one of the authors has been involved in efforts to develop, implement and 
118 
validate such behavioral tests [GJP] and the other [JB] has been involved in 
119 
administering tests. The limitations of canine behavioral evaluations have been well 
120 
described, although the tendency is that after conceding these points, most authors 
121 
suggest that the solution is to attempt to remedy the deficiencies (Rayment et al., 2015; 
122 
King et al., 2012; Mornement et al., 2010; van der Borg et al., 2010; Diesel et al., 2008; 
123 
Christensen et al., 2007; Diederich & Giffroy, 2006; Taylor & Mills, 2006).  
124 
In this paper, we take a contrary position and argue that it might be time to step back 
125 
and ask a more fundamental question – namely, is it even feasible to develop a canine 
126 
behavioral evaluation that is sufficiently predictive of certain unwanted behaviors in the 
127 
future home to justify the cost to shelters and dogs? To address that question, we 
128 
unpack each of the criteria and assumptions for constructing and validating diagnostic 
129 
tests, and examine some conceptual issues related to canine behavior and conducting

these tests in a shelter. We will limit the discussion to the evaluation of behaviors 
131 
considered as dangerous by the test designers because of the emphasis on provoking 
132 
warning and biting behaviors, and because this is consistently the top, sometimes the 
133 
only, priority of organizations that use behavior evaluations. Finally, we will explain why 
134 
eliciting warning and biting behaviors (referred to here as a positive finding or positive 
135 
test) in particular is no better than flipping a coin in terms of informative value for either 
136 
improving public safety or justifying euthanasia decisions for dogs, and make 
137 
recommendations for moving forward. The simulations described in this manuscript 
138 
demonstrate how achieving a result better than simple chance with regard to reliably 
139 
predicting whether dogs will exhibit growling, snarling, snapping or biting behavior that 
140 
becomes problematic in their adoptive homes is vanishingly unlikely, even in theory, 
141 
much less under the logistical constraints of real world implementation in shelters.   
142 
 
143 
Key attributes of diagnostic tests 
144 
Sensitivity and specificity 
145 
Every diagnostic test has two inherent characteristics, sensitivity and specificity, that 
146 
play a major role in determining the performance or validity of that test in real-world 
147 
populations of individuals. Sensitivity is the percentage of individuals who are actually 
148 
positive for the condition whom the test identifies as positive, and specificity indicates 
149 
how many of those who are actually negative for the condition the test identifies as 
150 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
9 
negative. These characteristics influence the ability to predict an accurate result (either 
151 
positive or negative) on an evaluation for any given individual dog. Sensitivity and 
152 
specificity may be calculated after the four cells (a, b, c, and d) of a 2 x 2 table (Figure 1) 
153 
are filled in with the correct values. These concepts are reviewed in depth in standard 
154 
epidemiology texts and there may well be hundreds of papers explaining them in the 
155 
scientific literature (perhaps an indication of the extent to which clinicians find them 
156 
confusing); a very succinct and accessible summary has been published by Akobeng 
157 
(2007), and much information is available on the Internet.  
158 
A key component of calculating sensitivity and specificity involves comparing the test 
159 
results against a reference standard (e.g., best available confirmatory diagnostic) for the 
160 
condition in question (in Figure 1, we label this as “Response of the dog post-adoption”). 
161 
We contend it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to calculate sensitivity and 
162 
specificity for a behavior evaluation. One obstacle is that this reference standard cannot 
163 
ethically or practically be fully implemented in order to determine the rate of either true 
164 
positives or false positives.  
165 
Animal shelters take seriously their responsibility to protect the public, and no one 
166 
wants to place a dog in a situation where s/he would be a danger to herself or others. 
167 
Consequently, it is common practice in shelters for dogs being surrendered with a 
168 
history of biting or serious attempts to bite to be euthanized (or sometimes placed with 
169 
a qualified rescue group or sanctuary). The same is usually true for a dog who attempts 
170 
to bite any of the shelter personnel or is too threatening to be safely handled. Therefore, 
171 
 MANUSCRIPT

10
many dogs suspected of having the condition of interest (i.e., believed to be true 
172 
positives for biting and/or warning behavior) will have been removed from the testing 
173 
pool. This issue will become very important later when we consider the critically 
174 
important influence of the prevalence of problematic behavior on the predictive value 
175 
of a positive test in the behavior evaluation when applied to the general population of 
176 
shelter dogs, most of whom do not have a known history of biting or warning behavior. 
177 
Some shelters do place dogs believed to have manageable behavior problems into 
178 
adoptive homes, and when that occurs, it is typical that the adopter will be provided 
179 
management instructions to minimize, if not eliminate, opportunities for that behavior 
180 
to be triggered or behavior modification instructions to change the dog’s responses. This 
181 
was done, for example, with dogs who had tested positive for food guarding at the 
182 
Wisconsin Humane Society and were adopted (Mohan-Gibbons et al., 2012). However, 
183 
such sensible and pragmatic precautions to prevent a problem would also interfere with 
184 
evaluating test performance in a research context.  
185 
 
186 
Consistency of definitions for behavioral endpoints 
187 
Validating any behavioral evaluation would require clear criteria for the problematic 
188 
behavior being studied (Overall, 2015), and we believe those criteria should also have 
189 
clinical relevance in the home environment, as opposed to simply showing that the 
190 
same behavior can be replicated after adoption through additional testing. The word 
191 
“aggression” commonly appears in discussions of canine behavior and canine behavior

 MANUSCRIPT

11
evaluations to denote one category of problematic behaviors of concern. A full 
193 
discussion of what is meant by the term “aggression” is beyond the scope of this article. 
194 
We have avoided use of the term and place it here in quotes to emphasize that it has 
195 
been used in so many different contexts that it may have little practical value. The term 
196 
itself is subject to multiple, sometimes contradictory, definitions even in the behavior 
197 
literature. One group of authors found different categorizations and descriptions of 
198 
human-directed aggression in each of 7 articles, and a general failure to distinguish 
199 
between context, motivation of the dog, and emotion (Kikucjhi et al., 2014).  
200 
We believe there would be general agreement among behaviorists that aggression is a 
201 
heterogeneous group of postures and actions that are part of the normal behavioral 
202 
repertoire of the dog, which can occur on a spectrum and vary in frequency and 
203 
intensity over time, with different stimuli, and in different environments. Behaviors 
204 
labeled as aggressive in shelters typically include both warning signals (growling, 
205 
snarling, snapping and sometimes barking and lunging) and actual biting (both injurious 
206 
and non-injurious), but sometimes behaviors so labeled are simply neutral or even 
207 
affiliative, as in the case of the dog described as aggressive because he “climbs” the 
208 
leash with his mouth in an effort to use it as a tug toy and/or resist its direction, or even 
209 
the dog who has been severely deprived of opportunities for inter- or intra-species 
210 
interaction and so thrashes around on leash in an effort to close the distance between 
211 
himself and any person or dog who comes into view. There is evidence from published 
212 
studies that many of the behaviors elicited during a behavior evaluation that might be 
213 
deemed to indicate an aggressive temperament are more normal than pathological. For 
214 
 MANUSCRIPT

12
example, Guy et al. (2001) collected information on frequency of certain aggressive 
215 
behaviors in dogs toward familiar people (e.g., growling, growling/snapping over food or 
216 
objects, and biting) via a survey from 3,226 dog owners attending 20 general veterinary 
217 
practices. Many of these responses (18.5%) were for dogs <1 year of age, reflecting high 
218 
visitation rates for puppies. Behaviors were counted as aggressive even if the owner felt 
219 
the dog was just growling during play or a bite was during play/deemed accidental. The 
220 
rate of growling, and/or snarling was 41%, and biting was 15.6%, suggesting that these 
221 
are normal, common behaviors in the home, and that using these terms to define 
222 
dangerous behavior would need to be done with considerable qualification of the 
223 
intensity, frequency, and circumstances. Therefore, we argue that merely showing that 
224 
a dogs’ response to a stimulus (e.g., growling when seeing a stranger approaching in the 
225 
testing room at a shelter) can be predicted does not necessarily confirm that the dog’s 
226 
behavior is abnormal, nor that the owner will see it as problematic given the 
227 
circumstances, or that it will present a problem in the future home.  
228 
In practice, shelter behavior evaluations define “aggressive” behaviors as having passed 
229 
the threshold of whatever the specific agency deems as too much for adoptability, 
230 
under the assumption that the same type and level of behavior would occur in the home 
231 
following presumptively equivalent stimuli. This threshold on the test can range from a 
232 
single growl on any one of a battery of tests, to multiple bites to a model or device used 
233 
for testing, e.g., a fake hand used to interfere with a dog while he is eating or a doll used 
234 
to simulate a child in the shelter. So in practice, the term, “aggressive” is defined more 
235 
by circumstance and institutional policy than behavioral science, and by itself has little 
236 
 MANUSCRIPT

13
value as a reference standard.  With respect to the appropriate reference standard, 
237 
Sheppard & Mills (2003) point out the problems inherent in a medical model where 
238 
even normal behavior is pathologized and dichotomized as present/absent, much like an 
239 
infectious disease or injury that needs to be diagnosed and treated. The utility of this 
240 
categorical approach in human psychology has been criticized by none other than Dr. 
241 
Allen Frances, the chair of the DSM-4 Task Force, in his book “Saving Normal: An 
242 
Insider's Revolt against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and 
243 
the Medicalization of Ordinary Life” (Frances, 2014).  
244 
To further complicate matters, unlike diagnosing a physical condition such as a tumor or 
245 
coronary artery disease, which over the course of hours or days will be comparatively 
246 
static, dog behavior is extraordinarily plastic and can vary from moment-to-moment in 
247 
both frequency and intensity in response to a particular stimulus or to different stimuli. 
248 
Two stimuli might appear essentially similar to people, but be perceived as very 
249 
different by dogs due to other contextual factors that differ between shelters and 
250 
homes, or even within the shelter. For example, we are aware of evaluations where 
251 
dogs presented with another dog on a leash reacted in a way that resulted in them 
252 
being deemed dog aggressive, but when those same dogs were allowed to interact with 
253 
other dogs off-leash in a shelter play group, no dog-dog issues were noted. One study of 
254 
a food aggression test widely used in shelters found low predictability with regard to 
255 
subsequent food guarding in the home, and reported there was little concern on the 
256 
part of the adopters about whether the behavior occurred or not, as simple 
257 
management practices such as isolating the dog during feeding could easily prevent a 
258 
 MANUSCRIPT

14
problem (Marder et al., 2013). Another study also found poor predictability with respect 
259 
to food guarding (Mohan-Gibbons et al., 2012). Few dogs continued to express guarding 
260 
behavior after 3 months in a home in spite of low owner compliance with protocols 
261 
recommended for dogs who had shown food guarding. In fact, against the shelter’s 
262 
advice, owners often engaged in the provocative behavior that had elicited guarding in 
263 
the behavior evaluation (e.g., picking up the food bowl while the dog was eating) 
264 
without any similar response. Furthermore, dogs the shelter identified as food guarders 
265 
were returned at a lower rate than the general adopted population, and none were 
266 
returned for food guarding. In preliminary results of a study of shelters that 
267 
discontinued food-guarding tests, no difference has been found in adoption, return, 
268 
length of stay or live release rates since suspending testing for food guarding (Weiss, 
269 
2016). Therefore, determining what types of provocative tests in the stressful, 
270 
unfamiliar environment of a shelter would be relevant for eliciting a behavior of actual 
271 
concern in the very different environment of a future home seems extremely 
272 
problematic.  
273 
 
274 
Single tests vs. battery tests 
275 
It might be argued that this simple scenario we have discussed of a single provocative 
276 
test would not accurately reflect sensitivity and specificity in shelter practice, where 
277 
batteries of individual tests or subtests (potentially with each having different 
278 
sensitivities and specificities), are used collectively to make a determination about a 
279 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
15
dog’s behavioral tendencies. Battery testing, however, comes with its own trade-offs in 
280 
sensitivity and specificity. In the typical battery test situation, a number of individual 
281 
tests are performed sequentially and in general the next test is not dependent on the 
282 
first (i.e., parallel testing). In these circumstances, if the results of the test are combined 
283 
in an “or” fashion, where a positive result on any test results in a dog being deemed 
284 
“positive” for the condition, then the overall sensitivity of the evaluation is greater than 
285 
for any test alone, but the overall specificity will be lower, and therefore more false 
286 
positives will occur. By contrast, if the results of individual tests are combined in an “and” 
287 
fashion, where a positive result on several tests is required to declare a dog “positive” 
288 
for the behavior, then the specificity will be higher for the evaluation overall compared 
289 
with an individual test, but the sensitivity will be lower.  Other concerns arise when a 
290

In summary, canine behavior evaluations lack an essential component of any valid 
293 
diagnostic test, since key attributes of test validity (sensitivity and specificity) have not 
294 
been, and likely cannot be, calculated in the context of a research situation in real 
295 
shelters and adoptive homes. Furthermore, there is neither consensus nor confirmatory 
296 
research on the specific behaviors elicited during a provocative test in a shelter, the 
297 
relevant intensity of those behaviors, or the frequency of those behaviors in the various 
298 
subtests that would be considered indicative of a potentially dangerous dog. One would 
299 
expect that these deficiencies alone would be sufficient to dispel any notion that canine 
300 
behavior evaluations can be scientifically validated for use on shelter dogs, but for

purposes of continuing this hypothetical scenario, we will assume these hurdles have 
302 
been overcome.  
303 
 
304 
Assessing potential predictive value of behavioral evaluations 
305 
As Akobeng (2007) emphasizes, while sensitivity and specificity are critical for 
306 
determining the validity of a diagnostic test or risk assessment instrument, they do not 
307 
have any practical value in conveying the likelihood of a particular individual having a 
308 
particular diagnosis or engaging in a particular behavior. That clinically relevant 
309 
information is provided by two other attributes of a diagnostic test: the positive 
310 
predictive value and the negative predictive value, also calculated from the four cells in 
311 
the 2 x 2 table (Figure 1). 
312 
To continue with our hypothetical scenario (and accepting the unrealistic assumption 
313 
that sensitivity and specificity can in fact be calculated in shelters participating in 
314 
behavior evaluation research), to get the point where the predictive value of the 
315 
evaluations can be calculated, we first need to establish plausible ranges of sensitivity 
316 
and specificity, recognizing that they must fall between 0.0 and 1.00 (0 and 100%). In 
317 
Supplementary Table 1, we summarize a sample of published values for human medical 
318 
and behavioral diagnostic tests. An extensive list is available on-line 
319 
(http://www.getthediagnosis.org/browse.php?mode=dx). As these data and other 
320 
readily available resources indicate, even within a specific medical condition, there can 
321 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
17
be a considerable range for both sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests in different 
322 
studies.  
323 
For our hypothetical scenario, we have decided to draw on sensitivity and specificity 
324 
values published for behavioral risk assessment in humans (as opposed to say a test for 
325 
cancer or infectious disease, which involves comparatively less subjectivity in its 
326 
administration and interpretation). In particular, a large meta-analysis of risk 
327 
assessments of people summarized 37 individual studies in 24,827 people from 13 
328 
countries and reported overall values of 92% and 36%, for sensitivity and specificity, 
329 
respectively, for predicting violent offending and 41% and 80%, respectively, for 
330 
predicting criminal offending (Fazel et al., 2012)b (Supplementary Table 1). We will use 
331 
these in our simulation.  
332 
Students as well as clinicians often confuse the probabilities for sensitivity/specificity 
333 
and positive/negative predictive value since all are calculated from the same 2 x 2 table, 
334 
and the distinctions may indeed seem subtle. Nevertheless, the proportion of dogs with 
335 
problematic behavior who test positive on a behavioral evaluation (sensitivity) is very 
336 
different from the proportion of dogs who test positive who also actually have 
337 
problematic behavior (predictive value of a positive test), as is the proportion of dogs 
338 
                                                        
b This meta-analysis also illustrates the level of replication (i.e, number of different 
studies in different populations) needed to derive reasonably robust values for these 
key test parameters. Even if a single solid study of a canine behavior evaluation were 
published, that study must be replicated in different shelters to assert it was in any way 
generalizable. Given the very limited resources for animal shelter studies, the notion of 
sufficient replication strikes us as highly unlikely.

without problematic behavior who test negative (specificity) different from the 
339 
proportion of dogs with negative tests who will not exhibit problematic behavior 
340 
(predictive value of a negative test). This can be visualized by examining the direction of 
341 
the calculations in Figure 1 – which differs by going either down columns (sensitivity and 
342 
specificity) or across rows (predictive values).  
343 
The problem posed by prevalence 
344 
It is critical to appreciate that the predictive value of any diagnostic test is strongly 
345 
influenced by prevalence of the condition in question in the population being evaluated. 
346 
Prevalence is what connects the validity of the test, as determined by sensitivity and 
347 
specificity, with conditions in the real world. A corollary of this is that in a low prevalence 
348 
situation, the predictive value of a negative test will tend to be very high (few false 
349 
negatives), whereas the predictive value of a positive test will be low (i.e., there will be 
350 
many false positive results).  
351 
What might we use to estimate plausible values for prevalence of problematic behaviors 
352 
related to aggression in the population of shelter dogs? One measure of interest to 
353 
shelters as well as adopters would be biting humans. Dog bite statistics are extremely 
354 
variable across the US, and suffer from a variety of problems with reporting and 
355 
definition, which make generalizable estimates difficult to come by (Devadas et al., 
356 
2013). However, for this exercise, we will start with the highest numbers ever reported 
357 
in the general US population: 4.7 million persons estimated to have been bitten by dogs 
358 
in 1994 and 4.5 million in 2001–2003, based on samples from the ICARIS-1 (Sacks et al., 
359 
 MANUSCRIPT

19
1996) and ICARIS-2 (Gilchrist et al., 2008) telephone surveys, respectively, done by the 
360 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In those surveys, respondents were simply asked, “In 
361 
the past 12 months, has anyone in your household been bitten by a dog?” No criteria for 
362 
what constituted a bite was provided, so presumably this must include both reported 
363 
and unreported bites, many of which were inevitably trivial in nature (e.g., no medical 
364 
treatment required even if assessment was sought, self-treated bites, etc.) and/or bites 
365 
that were likely accidental. It should be noted that the prevalence reported by other 
366 
sources for reported bites or medically attended bites is substantially (80–90%) lower 
367 
(Patronek & Slavinsky, 2009). Another widely used statistic would be the estimated 
368 
number of medically attended bites (799,701 in ICARIS-1 [Sacks et al., 1996] and 
369 
885,000 in ICARIS-2 [Gilchrist et al., 2008). Those estimates would also include some 
370 
bites evaluated by physicians due to concern about infection or rabies rather than injury 
371 
per se, and which required minimal to no treatment, but again we will use that estimate 
372 
without qualification. Using those CDC-ICARIS estimates of prevalence for all bites, a 
373 
population of ~52 million dogs in the US in 1991 and ~63 million in 2001 (Wise et al., 
374 
2002), and conservatively assuming that each bite represents a different dog, would 
375 
mean that <9% of dogs bite a person at any level of severity or concern in a given year.c  
376 
For a prevalence of ~9% of dogs biting (derived from the CDC-ICARIS surveys) and a test 
377 
with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 36% (values for predicting risk of future 
378 
                                                        
c Another way to look at these numbers of course is to conclude that >90% of dogs did 
not bite anyone in a given year, and that <1.5% of dogs inflicted a bite for which medical 
assessment was sought, regardless of whether treatment was actually necessary. The 
proportion actually requiring medical treatment or hospitalization would be much lower.

violent offending from the meta-analysis in Supplementary Table 1, with risk of biting 
379 
substituted for risk of future violent offending), the positive predictive value of such a 
380 
test would be only ~12%, meaning that ~88% of dogs identified as likely to bite on the 
381 
evaluation would be false positives! For the lower prevalence of ~1.3% of dogs 
382 
associated with medically attended bites (interpolating medically attended bites to be 
383 
~842,000 in 2001), and using 63 million for the size of the US dog population, the 
384 
predictive value of identifying potentially only more serious bites would be ~2%, 
385 
meaning that almost all (98%) dogs identified by the test as likely to bite in the future 
386 
would be false positives (see http://vassarstats.net/clin2.html). Alternatively, using test 
387 
parameters for risk of future criminal offending (sensitivity 41% and specificity 80%) and 
388 
a prevalence of ~9%, the predictive value of identifying a dog as exhibiting biting or 
389 
warning behavior in the behavior evaluation would be slightly better (~17%) but still 
390 
hardly useful, with ~83% of positive tests being false positives for future behavior. 
391 
It might be argued that prevalence estimates of biting from random community samples 
392 
used in the CDC-ICARIS surveys is either unrealistically low for use in shelter dog 
393 
populations or that behaviors other than those resulting in an actual bite should be 
394 
screened for. If increasing public safety is the ultimate goal, this argument is difficult to 
395 
defend since many more dogs express warning signals than actually bite. But we will put 
396 
this aside and say for the moment that there is also value in predicting which dogs will 
397 
express warning behaviors in homes, and so it is essential to know or estimate the 
398 
prevalence of these behaviors. To answer that question, we need to determine what 
399 
 MANUSCRIPT

21
would be a plausible upper limit on prevalence of biting/warning/attempting to bite 
400 
combined in the tested shelter population. Here we provide four independent estimates. 
401 
A national telephone survey sponsored by the ASPCA suggests that about 16% of dogs 
402 
who are rehomed, whether to a friend, family member, veterinarian, or shelter/rescue, 
403 
are rehomed due to owner-perceived aggression (no definition provided). In other 
404 
words, among 391 owners who rehomed one or more dogs during the previous five 
405 
years, 46% indicated this was due to a pet-related problem and 35% of these described 
406 
it as due to aggression, for an overall value of ~16% in rehomed dogs (i.e., 35% x 
407 
46%=16%) (Weiss et al., 2015). We cannot know, of course, how many of those were 
408 
actually misinterpretations of play or greeting behavior, but for our purposes here, we’ll 
409 
take them at face value since they were problematic for the owners. To investigate 
410 
other support for that estimate (~16%), we examined data from the Regional Shelter 
411 
Relinquishment Study sponsored by the National Council on Pet Population Study and 
412 
Policy (1995–1996), which reported that at least one behavioral reason (out of a 
413 
possible of 5 behavioral reasons) was listed for 1,984 dogs relinquished to 12 US animal 
414 
shelters (Salman et al., 2000). For 379 dogs for whom behavior was listed as the only 
415 
reason for relinquishment, biting was listed as the most common reason (22.2%), with 
416 
17.4% listing aggression to people and 11.3% listing aggression to animals. Similarly, for 
417 
422 people listing mixed reasons for relinquishments, 9.7% listed biting and 12.1% 
418 
aggression to people. Taking the most conservative position (assuming that each reason 
419 
was mutually exclusive, which they were not), those data would imply that about 
420 
284/1984 dogs (14.3%) were relinquished for biting or other kinds of aggression. 
421 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
22
Allowing for the non-mutually exclusive nature of the reasons in that study, the true 
422 
proportion of dogs relinquished for these problems was likely lower. For a third source 
423 
of data, Bollen & Horowitz (2008) report owner-provided behavioral history for 1,911 
424 
dogs relinquished to an open-admission shelter for whom history in the prior home was 
425 
provided. Of these, 217 (11.3%) were categorized as having a positive aggression history 
426 
because their owners reported that they had “growled, snarled, lunged, snapped or 
427 
bitten” in response to “strangers or visitors” or “being approached while eating” or 
428 
“having possessions taken away” or “being removed from furniture” or “being handled.” 
429 
Finally, a convenience sample survey of 3,897 dog owners in the UK suggests a 
430 
prevalence rate similar to the 11% and 16% cited above for dogs relinquished to shelters 
431 
among owned dogs. For each question framed along the lines of “does your dog . . ?”, 
432 
owners were asked about currently occurring behavior, behavior which had but no 
433 
longer occurred, behavior that had ever occurred, and also whether they considered the 
434 
behavior a problem. Among these owners, 579 (14.8%) reported a history (ever having 
435 
occurred) of barking, lunging, growling, or biting family members, and/or unfamiliar 
436 
people entering the home, and/or encountered outside the home (Casey et al., 2014). 
437 
This was a lifetime prevalence of ever occurring, and the questions were not mutually 
438 
exclusive, so the number 14.8% must include some owners reporting >1 type of 
439 
aggressive behavior ever occurring. Indeed, 200 of these responses indicated that they 
440 
occurred in the past but were not presently a problem, which further underscores the 
441 
plasticity and circumstantial nature of dog behavior.

23
All of these independent sources of data suggest that a prevalence of ~16% is a plausible 
443 
starting point for these types of problematic behavior in dogs relinquished to shelters. 
444 
And given that some unknown portion of dogs surrendered with a history of biting or 
445 
aggressive behavior will typically be euthanized or otherwise removed from the pool of 
446 
dogs undergoing formal behavior evaluation, we believe it is also a conservative 
447 
estimate for prevalence in the evaluated population (in the sense that a larger number 
448 
will maximize the predictive value of a positive test and put the results of a dog behavior 
449 
evaluation in a more favorable position than a smaller estimate of prevalence) and one 
450 
we will use in our hypothetical scenario. 
451 
 
452 
Completing the simulation – the problem of false positive results 
453 
Now that we have identified plausible starting values for test sensitivity and specificity, 
454 
as well as prevalence of problematic behaviors related to aggression, we can complete 
455 
the simulation. If a behavioral evaluation with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 36% 
456 
(again, same values for predicting future violent offending in people in Supplementary 
457 
Table 1) was performed in a population of dogs with a baseline prevalence of 
458 
problematic behavior of ~16%, the predictive value of a positive test would be at best 
459 
~22%, meaning that 78% of dogs testing positive would be false positives. Using the 
460 
values for any criminal offending (41% and 80%, respectively) from the human risk 
461 
assessment meta-analysis yields a positive predictive value of 28%, meaning that 72% of 
462 
positive tests will be false positives. These scenarios are explained in Figure 2.

It might be argued that the validity of a canine behavior evaluation is likely to be much 
464 
better than the measures of sensitivity and specificity characterizing human behavioral 
465 
assessments for predicting future violence or criminal offending. This would be a weak 
466 
argument in our opinion, given the number of studies and human subjects participating 
467 
during 30 years of work summarized in the paper by Fazel et al. (2012), but again, for 
468 
purposes of the exercise, let’s say that sensitivity and specificity in our canine scenario 
469 
are a wildly optimistic 85% and 85%; which generally exceeds those reported from 
470 
rigorously conducted human diagnostic tests. Having both values be high is unusual, as 
471 
most diagnostic tests typically involve a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. 
472 
With the prevalence remaining at 16%, the predictive value of identifying warning and 
473 
biting on the behavioral evaluation would be only 52% (Also explained in Figure 2). This 
474 
means that even under unreasonably optimistic conditions favoring the performance of 
475 
a behavior evaluation, the chance of a dog who tests positive actually being positive is 
476 
about the same as flipping a coin. It is clear that making a euthanasia decision (or any 
477 
other type of decision) on the basis of such test results would be nonsensical.  
478 
An endless number of simulations is possible here, and the three we have used in this 
479 
manuscript are presented in Figure 3, showing the effect on the predictive value of a 
480 
positive test for various combinations of test sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence of 
481 
problematic behavior, however one might chose to define that latter term. As Figure 3 
482 
demonstrates, all of the three simulations are associated with a very high proportion of 
483 
false-positive results, not only at any plausible prevalence of problematic behavior, but 
484 
even at implausible levels of behavior that was likely to be unusual or problematic in the

home. Simple on-line calculators are available that allow anyone to perform their own 
486 
simulations, and we would encourage readers to do so (e.g., see http://vassarstats.net/; 
487 
http://vassarstats.net/clin2.html). It should also be noted that in all three of our 
488 
hypothetical scenarios, the predictive value of a negative test is very high (>90%), 
489 
meaning that a dog who tested negative in the shelter behavioral evaluation would 
490 
likely continue to fail to show problematic behavior in the home. Again, this is 
491 
unsurprising for a screening test with high sensitivity performed in a population with 
492 
low prevalence of the condition. 
493 
Is there any other evidence to support our analysis? Planta & De Meester (2007) 
494 
examined performance of a diagnostic test for dog aggression called the Socially 
495 
Acceptable Behavior Test, which involved 16 individual subtests performed outdoors. 
496 
Those authors defined aggressive biting during the test as including “aggressive bites or 
497 
snaps and also aggressive attacks indicated by lunging on the leash which were 
498 
prevented”. The study was conducted in a sample of 330 privately owned dogs, 
499 
recruited from breeders and behavior consultants. Interestingly, 94/330 (28.5%) of the 
500 
dogs had actually previously bitten a person at least once. That sample, unlike shelter 
501 
samples, provided the availability of a reference standard, as they obtained information 
502 
about the dog’s behavior in the home over at least 1 year after the test. We agree it is 
503 
appropriate to call this a reference standard because the owners were familiar with the 
504 
dogs, the dogs had been in the familiar environment where presumably normal 
505 
behavior would be as stable as behavior can be, and the owners had the opportunity to 
506 
observe the dogs regularly. The prevalence of snapping, biting or lunging in an attempt 
507 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
26
to bite an artificial hand or a doll during the test in that sample was high (37.3%), 
508 
presumably in part due to animal behavioral consultants’ clients being one of the two 
509 
sources of the sample. Nevertheless, when they used “no aggressive behavior at all” (a 
510 
very strict interpretation) as the standard on both the test and in the home, there was 
511 
high sensitivity (84%) and high specificity (81%), but the positive predictive value of the 
512 
test was 64.2%, again only somewhat better than chance. When only 1 incident of 
513 
aggressive behavior in a subtest was used as the cut-off for defining a positive test, a 
514 
slightly more generous value, the sensitivity was 67%, the specificity was 95%, and the 
515 
positive predictive value was 83%. A logical question that comes up in this scenario 
516 
where so many dogs had a previous history of biting people, is what exactly would be 
517 
the clinical relevance of a true positive test – all of these dogs were pets living in homes, 
518 
despite the identification of “aggressive” behavior on the Socially Acceptable Behavior 
519 
test.  
520 
We have found only three studies (other than the food guarding follow up studies 
521 
mentioned above) that have attempted to compare the test results of dogs in a shelter 
522 
to their behavior post-adoption. Van der Borg et al. (1991) published a paper reporting 
523 
sensitivity and negative predictive values for a canine behavioral evaluation in shelter 
524 
dogs, using the reference standard of owner-reported behavior in the new home. 
525 
However, using the data as presented in their paper (their table 3) and the formulas as 
526 
they described them to generate sensitivity (82.1%) and negative predictive value 
527 
(84.8%) in their table 3, the corresponding predictive value of a positive test would be 
528 
only 61%, for a false positive rate of 39%.  Alternatively, using the descriptors present in 
529 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
27
their table 3, we calculated a false positive rate of 59% - either way, the results suggest 
530 
that a positive test was not very useful. The second of the follow-up studies (Valsecchi 
531 
et al., 2001) did not ask owners about the dog’s real life behavior, but rather sent an 
532 
evaluator out to retest the dog after rehoming; whether the results of the in-home 
533 
responses to the test stimuli matched those of the shelter test seems irrelevant to the 
534 
primary issue of whether the dog was considered a good pet or whether his behavior 
535 
posed a danger in the home or community, which was not evaluated in the study. The 
536 
third, Christensen et al. (2007), could record only false negatives, as all the positives, 
537 
both true and false, had been euthanized rather than adopted.  This illustrates one of 
538 
the problems we raised earlier for calculating sensitivity and specificity. The rate of 
539 
lunging, growling, snarling, snapping, or biting within 13 months of adoption among the 
540 
dogs who passed the test was 40.9%, which is exactly the rate that Guy et al. (2001) 
541 
found in a general population of dogs brought to veterinary clinics. It is interesting to 
542 
note that none of these prospective studies included any report of an injurious bite, 
543 
although it is unclear whether all of them asked about this.  
544 
 
545 
Our evaluation of behavior evaluations 
546 
In summary, for any plausible combination of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, a 
547 
positive test (i.e., eliciting problematic behavior from the dog in the behavior 
548 
evaluation) is not much better than flipping a coin, and often much worse because, for 
549 
reasons already explained, many of the dogs who test positive will be false positives (see

Figure 4 for a summary of our argument). These results are in line with the conclusions 
551 
of Fazel et al. (2012), who after an extensive meta-analysis of 73 studies involving risk 
552 
assessments of 24,827 people, concluded “…even after 30 years of development, the 
553 
view that violence, sexual, or criminal risk [in people] can be predicted in most cases is 
554 
not evidence-based. This message is important for the general public, media, and some 
555 
administrations who may have unrealistic expectations of risk prediction for clinicians.”  
556 
We believe that the mathematical improbability of behavioral evaluations done in a 
557 
shelter providing reliable information about warning and biting behavior in a future 
558 
home is sufficient to settle the question regarding the merit of these evaluations. 
559 
However, beyond the mathematical improbability of success, there are additional 
560 
significant pragmatic methodological concerns that would need to be addressed before 
561 
an evaluation could be validated. Even if we believe we have standardized the stimuli 
562 
used in a provocative test in the shelter (something we suspect is highly unlikely in the 
563 
real-world diversity of animal shelters), it will never be possible to fully account for the 
564 
emotions associated with a dog being abandoned and losing the familiarity, safety and 
565 
security of her home. It is our opinion that this is a fundamentally insurmountable 
566 
limitation as well. Dogs in shelters may well act in a self-defensive way because of the 
567 
fear and uncertainty associated with that environment. Behaviors such as growling,

snarling, snapping, and biting are highly situation-dependent and can be elicited by an 
569 
almost infinite possible number of stimuli. Moreover, these behaviors, like all behaviors, 
570 
are subject to learning, and a cognitively complex being like a dog is constantly 
571 
processing new information that affects which stimuli he perceives as safe or dangerous.

It seems overly optimistic to believe that the behavior of a dog during individual 
573 
provocative tests in a behavior evaluation, whether due to exacerbation or suppression 
574 
of normal tendencies, would consistently and reliably predict what would occur in an 
575 
entirely different setting and how it might change over time.  
576 
The take home message is that shelters have almost certainly, despite the best of 
577 
intentions, placed undue faith in a diagnostic process that was not fully understood and 
578 
that has not been scientifically established as being valid or suitably predictive for 
579 
positive findings to make critical decisions about dogs. Our analysis shows that 
580 
substituting plausible values for those unknown attributes would mean that a behavior 
581 
evaluation conducted in the typical population of shelter dogs would result in a high 
582 
proportion of dogs who test positive for warning or biting behavior being incorrectly 
583 
labeled for future behavior, i.e., be false positives, and potentially denied the 
584 
opportunity for adoption. Substituting very optimistic instead of plausible values for 
585 
sensitivity and specificity improves this picture, but still produces results that are no 
586 
better than flipping a coin. The explanation for this is simple: The likely prevalence of 
587 
seriously problematic behavior (meaning a degree and/or frequency of biting or warning 
588 
behavior in response to stimuli that would make them unsafe in a community setting) in 
589 
shelter dogs is in general simply too low (particularly when overtly dangerous dogs are 
590 
removed from the adoption pool at intake or before formal behavior evaluation) to 
591 
render the results of a positive test much more informative than chance. In the case of a 
592 
positive test, it is much more likely that the test has failed the dogs, rather than the 
593 
dogs failing the test.

If not behavioral evaluations, then what? 
596 
We are not suggesting that shelters should abandon efforts to make reasonable 
597 
attempts to place only behaviorally sound dogs in the community, and we recognize 
598 
that there are cases where the correct decision about adoption is not straightforward.  
599 
Nevertheless, given our analysis, the solution is not to settle for a false sense of security 
600 
or take emotional comfort by relying on a flawed diagnostic, which in a low prevalence 
601 
situation and in the real-life environment of an animal shelter is likely to unfairly label 
602 
and potentially condemn dogs who exhibit behaviors deemed problematic during the 
603 
test. Perhaps with a different balance between enthusiasm and critical thinking, we 
604 
would have recognized long ago how unlikely it was that it would be possible to 
605 
accurately predict future behavior in a new and unknown environment with a test 
606 
conducted in subjects whose behavior is likely influenced by the emotions associated 
607 
with abandonment, stress and fear in an unfamiliar environment. A mathematical 
608 
simulation now confirms this.  
609 
So the question becomes, what exactly is necessary and responsible in a shelter, and 
610 
how should scarce resources be spent? Nothing in the prevalence estimates we 
611 
reviewed suggest that overall, dogs who come to spend time in a shelter (and are not 
612 
screened out based on history or behavior at intake or shortly thereafter) are 
613 
dramatically more or less inclined toward problematic warning or biting behavior than 
614 
are pet dogs in general. Consider the implications of the remarkable reductions in

euthanasia in communities across the country who have chosen to focus their efforts on 
616 
saving lives, e.g., an open-admission shelter in Hilllsborough County, FL which reduced 
617 
its euthanasia rate from 49% in 2010 
618 
(http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/12696) to 13% in 2015 
619 
(http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/18075). In that shelter, 
620 
the number of dogs euthanized for all reasons (including health) was actually lower 
621 
(13%) than the prevalence of problematic behavior we used in our hypothetical scenario 
622 
(16%). Shelters across the US have engaged in concerted efforts to remove barriers to 
623 
adoption and decrease the number of dogs euthanized, and overall, there is no 
624 
indication this has compromised public safety. It is also highly unlikely that the 
625 
improvement in adoption rate has come about because of a marked improvement in 
626 
the behavior profile of admitted dogs. That leaves us with the conclusion that many 
627 
stated problematic behaviors during behavior evaluations may not be so problematic 
628 
after all in the future home.  
629 
The simplest solution may well be the most reasonable: to collect behavior histories on 
630 
dogs at the time of relinquishment whenever possible and attempt to verify any serious 
631 
incidents reported, and to designate as ineligible for adoption dogs who inflict injurious 
632 
bites or are too threatening to handle in the shelter. Subsequent provocative behavioral 
633 
testing of the general population in shelters seems predicated on an assumption of risk 
634 
from dogs that is far in excess of the data, and on assumptions about canine behavior 
635 
that may not be supportable. Instead of striving to bring out the worst in dogs in the 
636 
stressful and temporary environment of a shelter, and devoting scarce resources to

inherently flawed and unvalidated formal evaluations, how much more productive 
638 
might it be to focus our energies on giving every dog the opportunity to be at his or her 
639 
best? It may be far better for dogs, shelters, and communities if effort was spent 
640 
regularly interacting with every shelter dog in normal and even enjoyable ways (e.g., 
641 
walking, socializing with people, playgroups with other dogs, games, and training) in 
642 
order to enrich their experience and minimize the adverse impact of being relinquished 
643 
and confined to an unfamiliar environment, rather than investing additional resources in 
644 
what is likely a losing proposition for all concerned. With proper training of staff about 
645 
normal dog behavior, those activities are likelier to identify any additional dogs whose 
646 
behavior may be of concern, to be more indicative of the typical personality and 
647 
behavior of dogs, and help make dogs better candidates for adoption in the process.

Figure 1: Standard 2 x 2 table for calculating key attributes of a canine behavior 
evaluation
Sensitivity: The ability of the test to correctly identify dogs who have the problematic behavior; it 
is calculated as the proportion of dogs with the behavior who test positive. Calculated DOWN the 
first COLUMN [a/(a+b)] 
Specificity: The ability of the test to correctly identify dogs who do not have the problematic 
behavior; it is calculated as the proportion of dogs without  the behavior who test negative. 
Calculated DOWN the second COLUMN [d/(c + d)]
Predictive value of a positive test (positive predictive value): The proportion of dogs who test 
positive who actually have the problematic behavior. Calculated ACROSS the first ROW [a/(a + c)]. 
This answers the critically important question, “If a dog tests positive in the shelter, what is the 
probability that s/he has the problematic behavior”?
Predictive value of a negative test (negative predictive value): The proportion of dogs who test 
negative who are actually free of the problematic behavior. Calculated ACROSS the second row 
[d/(b + d)]. This answers the critically important question, “If a dog tests negative in the shelter, 
what is the probability that s/he does not have the problematic behavior?” 
aOnly for purposes of simplifying the mathematical analysis for this hypothetical scenario, we will assume that 
problematic behavior in the home can be unambiguously defined and dichotomized into present/absent. 
Problems with these assumptions are discussed in the text.

bAssuming a validated test was available for shelters; see Figure 3 for values.
Belief: “Behavior after a 
provocative stimulus on 
test(s) during behavior 
evaluation in a shelter is 
predictive of behavior of 
concern in a future home.”
Reality: Unknown and 
unproved; some evidence 
shows tests are not 
predictive or useful.
Belief: “Dog behavior 
is reliably static over 
time and place.”
Reality: No! Dog 
behavior can change 
over time and place, 
in response to stress 
vs. security, different 
stimuli, and due to 
learning.
Belief: “A research 
shelter site can 
adopt out dogs 
believed to have 
dangerous 
behaviors to detect 
incidence of true 
positive and false 
positive tests.”
Reality: Ethically & 
pragmatically 
inadvisable.
Belief: “It is possible to 
calculate sensitivity and 
specificity of a behavior 
evaluation.”
Reality: Not yet accomplished 
and likely not possible.
Belief: “It would be feasible 
to conduct replication 
studies in new shelter 
settings.”
Reality: Not yet done, and 
very unlikely given resources 
available.
Use ≤ 16% a for prevalence 
of problematic biting and 
warning behaviors in shelter 
dogs being evaluated when 
calculating predictive value 
of a positive test. 
Use realistic values for test 
sensitivity and specificity b
Belief: “Studies in different 
shelter settings will confirm 
results of prior research.”
Reality: Unlikely, given 
heterogeneity of shelters 
and testing conditions in 
real-life.
