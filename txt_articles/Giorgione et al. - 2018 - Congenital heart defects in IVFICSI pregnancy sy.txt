ABSTRACT
Objective There is no consensus in current practice
guidelines on whether conception by in-vitro fertilization
(IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) techniques
is an indication for performing a fetal echocardiogram.
The aim of the study was to assess whether congenital
heart defects (CHD) occur more often in pregnancies
conceived
after
IVF/ICSI
as
compared
with
those
conceived spontaneously.
Methods A systematic search for studies was conducted
of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus from
inception to September 2017. The search included
the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms
alone or in different combinations: ‘IVF’, ‘IVF/ICSI’,
‘ART pregnancy’, ‘assisted conception’, ‘birth defect’,
‘congenital heart defects’ and ‘congenital malformation or
abnormalities’. Studies comparing neonatal incidence of
CHD in pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI and those
conceived spontaneously were included. Studies reporting
on other types of assisted reproductive technology
(ART) or lacking information concerning termination of
pregnancy were excluded. Chromosomal abnormalities
were excluded in all analyzed studies. A meta-analysis
of selected cohort studies was conducted to estimate
the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI using a
random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity among the
studies was evaluated with the I2 statistic and Q-test.
Results Forty-one studies were identified for review
including
six
case–control
and
35
cohort
studies.
Data of eight selected cohort studies were used for
meta-analysis. A total of 25 856 children conceived from
IVF/ICSI techniques and 287 995 children conceived
spontaneously, involving both singleton and multiple

gestations, were included in the analysis. Total CHD
events were 337/25 856 (1.30%) and 1952/287 995
(0.68%) in the IVF/ICSI and spontaneous conception
groups, respectively. The risk of CHD was significantly
increased in the IVF/ICSI group as compared with
the spontaneous conception group (pooled OR, 1.45;
95% CI, 1.20–1.76; P = 0.0001; I2 = 44%; P = 0.08).
In
the
subgroup
of
singleton
IVF
pregnancies,
a
significant difference was also obtained (OR, 1.55;
95% CI, 1.21–1.99; P = 0.0005; I2 = 36%; P = 0.18)
and also multiple confounding factors adjusted ORs
showed statistical significance (pooled OR, 1.29; 95% CI,
1.03–1.60; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; P = 0.43).
Conclusion Fetuses conceived with IVF/ICSI methods are
at an increased risk of developing CHD compared with
those conceived spontaneously. However, this finding
deserves further investigation due to heterogeneity of both
ART procedures and cardiac defects. Copyright © 2017

INTRODUCTION
Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common
forms of congenital disorders and a significant cause
of perinatal mortality. According to the EUROCAT
registry, CHD occur in about 0.76% of live births
and 0.61% when excluding underlying genetic diseases.
However, some studies report an incidence of up to 1.5%,
particularly when all cases of intrauterine fetal death
(IUFD), termination of pregnancy (TOP) and stillbirth
are included1–3. Including early spontaneous miscarriages
would allow the calculation of an incidence of CHD
close to ‘reality’, but these cases are nearly impossible
to record.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
 34
Giorgione et al.
Chromosomal anomalies (particularly Down, Edwards,
Patau, Turner and Di George syndromes) and genetic
mutations are responsible for less than 15% of CHD and,
in most cases, the etiology of CHD remains unknown.
Hence, it is critical to assess potential new risk factors
for CHD in order to improve detection rate and possibly
outcome in affected cases.
Previous studies assessing the risk of CHD in preg-
nancies
conceived
after
in-vitro
fertilization
(IVF)/
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) showed a slightly
higher risk in this group as compared with spontaneous
conceptions4–8.
Previous
meta-analyses
also
showed
an increased risk of all congenital malformations in
IVF/ICSI infants9–11 without significant risk difference
between IVF and ICSI11,12. This may be due to the ART
procedure or to several other risk factors such as the
underlying cause of infertility or the higher incidence
of twin pregnancy associated with ART13–15. There is
no consensus in current practice guidelines on whether
IVF/ICSI conception is an indication for performing
fetal echocardiography16–22. The American Institute of
Ultrasound in Medicine, American Society of Echocar-
diography and American Heart Association (AHA)20–22
consider IVF an indication for a detailed cardiac scan,
but only the AHA guidelines include IVF or ICSI among
maternal indications for fetal echocardiography with rec-
ommendation class/level of evidence of IIa/A estimating
an absolute risk of 1.1–3.3% among live births22.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis
was
to
estimate
the
risk
of
CHD
in
pregnancies
conceived by IVF/ICSI as compared with those conceived
spontaneously.
METHODS
Eligibility criteria
This
study
was
performed
following
the
PRISMA
guidelines23. Population- or hospital-based cohort and
case–control studies reporting data on CHD among
infants conceived by IVF/ICSI and infants conceived
spontaneously were included. In case–control studies,
cases were defined as fetuses/infants with CHD and
controls were babies without birth defects or with other
malformations not associated with ART. Only full-text
articles in the English language were included, while
duplicate publications, studies with insufficient data on
the control group or with poor methodology, reviews and
case reports were excluded. Studies reporting data only
on multiple pregnancies or with overlapping data were
not considered.
Among the studies included in the systematic review,
those chosen for the meta-analysis were required to
fulfill the following requirements: (1) cohort study; (2)
inclusion of IVF/ICSI pregnancies with exclusion of
studies involving other assisted reproductive techniques,
particularly ovulation induction (OI) and/or intrauterine
insemination (IUI); (3) inclusion of IUFD, stillbirths and
TOP; and (4) exclusion of all chromosomal abnormalities.
Search strategy and study selection
A systematic search of pertinent articles was conducted
in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases
from inception to September 2017, including extensive
search of data from the literature. The search included
the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms
alone or in different combinations: ‘IVF’, ‘IVF/ICSI’,
‘ART pregnancy’, ‘assisted conception’, ‘birth defect*’,
‘congenital heart defects*’, ‘congenital abnormality*’ and
‘congenital malformation*’. Additionally, the reference
lists of related reviews were manually searched.
Two authors (V.G. and P.C.) reviewed independently
all the articles using the predetermined inclusion and
exclusion criteria. First, titles and abstracts of identified
records were screened, checking for duplicates. Second,
the full-text articles were selected by the same investigators
(Figure 1). Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion
until a consensus was reached between the authors.
In the systematic review data on CHD in pregnancies
resulting from other infertility treatments such as OI,
IUI, frozen embryo transfer (FET), in-vitro maturation
(IVM) and preimplantation genetic screening or diagnosis
(PGS/PGD) were not considered when they were presented
separately from data of IVF/ICSI; in the meta-analysis
only data on IVF/ICSI were included. Chromosomal
abnormalities were excluded case by case at the time
of manual counting of the congenital abnormalities.
Ascertainment of birth defects was performed after
birth (ranging from a few days to 10–15 years of age) in
all studies and postmortem in those studies including TOP.
The prenatal diagnosis and modality of CHD diagnosis
were specified when possible.
Data extraction and presentation
Study characteristics were extracted independently by
two authors (V.G. and P.C.) and included the following:
first author’s name, year of publication, country of
origin, study period, study design, age at assessment of
malformation or CHD, ART type and controls, sample
size of both groups, maternal age, number of singleton
and twin fetuses in both groups, and inclusion of TOP,
IUFD and stillbirths.
The PRISMA statement was used for reporting the
Methods, Results and Discussion sections of the current
review23. Extracted data from all included articles are
shown in Table S14,5,7,8,15,24–59.
Assessment of risk of bias
Risk of publication bias was assessed by the use of funnel
plots (data not shown).
Quality assessment of studies was performed using
the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (Tables S2 and S3)60. The
domains of assessment included selection, comparability
and outcome assessment biases. After assessment of risk
of bias, its influence on the effect estimates was evaluated
by sensitivity analysis.

Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart summarizing inclusion of studies in systematic review and meta-analysis.
The following potential biases in the methodology
of the studies included in the review were evaluated:
different protocols of ART across the large interval of
time covered by studies (1996–2017); characteristics
and size of the population, such as maternal age and
number of multiple pregnancies; and several different
types of CHD with variable degrees of severity. Other
sources of bias were assessed, such as funding bias and
multiple citation bias (different studies with overlapping
databases).
Therefore,
studies
that
were
sufficiently
similar to provide a clinically meaningful summary were
included in the meta-analysis.
Statistical analysis
Incidence of CHD was calculated pooling events and cases
of all cohort studies (incidence of CHD = total number of
CHD/total number of individuals).
The meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled
odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI using the random-effects
model and generic inverse variance method. Statistical
heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated by the
I2 value. Publication bias was evaluated with the use of
funnel plots, where appropriate.
A
sensitivity
analysis
was
performed
to
assess
whether the effect size was dependent on the study
type
or
study
quality
(high-quality
studies)
and
singleton
pregnancies.
‘High-quality’
studies
were
defined by a Newcastle–Ottawa scale score greater than
or equal to 8.
A secondary meta-analysis on the type of CHD
was conducted using data on different CHD subtypes
provided by only three studies7,51,59. We defined two
groups: (1) major CHD, which included hypoplastic left
heart syndrome (HLHS), transposition of great arteries
(TGA), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), coarctation of the aorta
(CoA) and atrioventricular septal defect; and (2) minor
CHD in which ventricular septal defects (VSD) and atrial
septal defects (ASD) were considered.
Finally, we performed a further secondary meta-
analysis considering those studies reporting OR adjusted
for potential confounding factors in singletons37,38,43.
When more than one regression model was provided,
estimates adjusted for the largest number of confounding
variables were considered.
All
analyses
included
in
the
meta-analysis
were
performed using Review Manager 5.361.
In
the
qualitative
evaluation
of
CHD
subtypes,
statistical
comparisons
among
groups
were
made
with a chi-square test, and the difference was consid-
ered to be statistically significant when the P value
was < 0.05.

RESULTS
Study selection and study characteristics
Forty-one observational studies were included in the
systematic review (Table S1)4,5,7,8,15,24–59. Of these,
35/41 were cohort studies, including nine clinic-based
studies, and 6/41 were case–control studies, including
two clinic-based studies.
Of the 41 studies included, 32 reported data on CHD
in pregnancies resulting from IVF or IVF/ICSI together,
and five reported only data on ICSI pregnancies. In five
studies, the type of ART was not specified or included
also OI and/or IUI5,8,49,53,55. The clinical assessment of
cardiac malformations was performed in all studies after
birth at different times in live births or postmortem in
TOP, and in 14/41 studies also during pregnancy. Six
studies specified that CHD diagnosis was confirmed by
a pediatric cardiologist5,7,48,53,55,56. Only live births were
included in 16/40 of the studies, in 11/40 studies live
births and IUFDs and/or stillbirths were considered and in
13/40 of the studies both IUFDs and stillbirths were taken
into account together with live births. Votava-Smith and
colleagues56 did not report the outcome of pregnancies
studied.
Case–control studies: descriptive analysis
Gutarra-Vilchez and colleagues36 performed a retrospec-
tive population-based case–control study in which cases
were newborns or fetuses following TOP with at least
one major birth defect and controls were a random sam-
ple of babies without birth defects. The exposure factor
studied in both populations was ART. They reported
310/2911 (10.6%) cases of CHD in the natural concep-
tion group and 40/161 (24.8%) CHD in the ART group
and, specifically, 28/83 (33.7%) in the IVF/ICSI group.
The association between IVF/ICSI and CHD was signifi-
cant in both crude and adjusted analyses for confounding
factors such as advanced maternal age, parity, pre-existing
diabetes, obesity, maternal infection and fetal gender (OR,
4.27; 95% CI, 2.67–6.83; P < 0.001; adjusted OR, 2.83;
95% CI, 1.57–5.08; P < 0.05).
In the study conducted by Reefhuis et al.4, mothers
of fetuses or newborns with a major birth defect (case
group) and mothers of infants without birth defects
(control group) were included and mode of conception
was analyzed. ART techniques that included IVF, ICSI and
zygote/gamete intrafallopian transfer were significantly
associated in singletons with septal heart defects, in
particular ASD secundum or not otherwise specified (OR,
3.4; 95% CI, 1.8–6.2) and VSD plus ASD (OR, 5.4;
95% CI, 2.1–12.5). These results were observed also
after adjusting for maternal age, study center, parity,
family income and prematurity.
On the contrary, Schofield et al.53 did not show a
significant association between ART and CHD (singleton
only: OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.4–3.0), although children with
CHD were conceived more frequently by ART (24/410,
5.9% in case group; 20/408, 4.9% in control group;
P = 0.54). Data were collected in a referral pediatric
cardiac hospital.
Tararbit et al.5,55 published two case–control studies
on the risk of CHD after ART using data of the Paris
Registry of Congenital Malformations from which they
selected cases that were fetuses/infants affected by CHD
and controls that were fetuses/infants with isolated mal-
formations not associated with ART (clubfoot, angioma,
skin abnormality, polydactyly, syndactyly or congenital
hip dislocation). ART was associated with CHD after
adjusting for maternal age, socioeconomic factors and
year of birth in infants without chromosomal abnormal-
ities (adjusted OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7). The risk was
higher for IVF and ICSI than for only OI; moreover,
IVF/ICSI techniques were associated with malformation
of the outflow tracts and ventriculoarterial connections
(adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.8), conotruncal CHD
and double outlet right ventricle (adjusted OR, 1.8;
95% CI, 1.0–3.3) and slightly less with VSD (adjusted
OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9–2.0)5. Finally, considering only
HLHS, TGA, TOF and CoA in live births, stillbirths and
TOP, they confirmed the association between ART and
TOF (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6–4.2) with the greater
risk in pregnancy conceived by ICSI (adjusted OR, 3.0;
95% CI, 1.0–8.9)55.
Among fetuses that underwent an echocardiogram at a
tertiary referral center, 619/2761 (22.4%) had a diagnosis
of CHD (case group) and 2142/2761 (77.6%) had nor-
mal cardiac structure (control group). Studying the mode
of conception, there was no association between IVF/ICSI
and CHD, also after controlling for maternal age and mul-
tiple gestation (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.77–1.7; P = 0.51)56.
Cohort studies
Overall incidence
In all cohort studies, CHD incidence was calculated
including only IVF and/or ICSI infants, except in the
studies by Davies et al.8 and Parazzini et al.49 who
reported data on all ART techniques. CHD occurred
in 1.21% (2719/224 145) of the IVF/ICSI group and
in
0.49%
(67 554/13 863 410)
of
the
spontaneous
conception group (Table S4).
Meta-analysis
Eight
studies7,37,38,43,47,48,51,59
fulfilled
the
inclusion
criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Among
those that included TOP, IUFD and stillbirths, Davies
et al.8 was excluded because they also considered ART
techniques other than IVF/ICSI (Table S1).
Overall, 25 856 fetuses conceived from IVF/ICSI tech-
niques were compared with 287 995 fetuses conceived
spontaneously, both in singleton and multiple pregnan-
cies. The total CHD events were 337/25 856 (1.30%) and
1952/287 995 (0.68%) in the IVF/ICSI and spontaneous
conception groups, respectively (Figure 2). For IVF/ICSI
children compared with those conceived spontaneously,

a significantly increased risk of CHD was observed
(OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20–1.76; P = 0.0001; I2 = 44%;
P = 0.08).
Sensitivity analysis that included seven high-quality
studies7,37,38,43,48,51,59 showed that the risk of CHD in
fetuses conceived after IVF/ICSI was significantly higher
than in those conceived naturally, irrespective of the
study quality (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.19–1.77; P = 0.0003;
I2 = 52%; P = 0.05) (Figure 3).
In the secondary analysis based on the few available
data on specific types of CHD (Figure 4), the slightly
increased risk of all cardiac malformations after IVF/ICSI
was not significant (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.68–1.86;
P = 0.33, I2 = 38%; P = 0.16) and seemed to be related
to minor CHD (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.66–2.56; P = 0.45;
I2 = 54%; P = 0.11) rather than major CHD (OR, 0.62;
95% CI, 0.16–2.39; P = 0.49; I2 = 33%; P = 0.22).
Considering
only
children
born
from
singleton
pregnancies37,38,43,48,51, CHD was higher in the IVF/ICSI
group than in infants conceived naturally with lower
heterogeneity among the two groups (OR, 1.55; 95% CI,
1.21–1.99; P = 0.0005; I2 = 36%; P = 0.18) (Figure 5).
When considering three studies that reported the adjusted
ORs for maternal age and parity in singletons37,38,43, the
meta-analysis showed also an increased risk of CHD
among IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with controls
(pooled OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03–1.60; P = 0.02) with
no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.43) (Figure 6).
Qualitative evaluation of CHD subtypes in cohort
and case–control studies
Figure 7 and Table 1 show the qualitative distribution
between IVF/ICSI and control groups of a specific type
of CHD reported in four studies in which both live
births and TOP were considered4,7,51,59. Minor CHD-like
VSD and ASD, as well as HLHS were more frequent
in IVF/ICSI pregnancies than in controls, whereas TOF,
TGA and CoA were less frequent in the IVF/ICSI group
as compared with the spontaneous conception group

only for TOF, TGA and VSD.
DISCUSSION
Summary of evidence
The risk of CHD in IVF/ICSI pregnancies is significantly
increased by about 50% as compared with pregnancies
conceived spontaneously, with stable significance in
most
subgroup
analyses.
In
particular
a
subgroup
analysis of three studies adjusted for maternal age, parity
and other confounding factors maintained statistical
significance37,38,43.
Interpretation
Previous meta-analyses showed increased risk of birth
defects9,10
and cardiovascular defects11
in IVF/ICSI
pregnancies. The rate of TOP for prenatally diagnosed
CHD (without chromosomal anomalies) is 30–50%, and
this is often related to disease severity and maternal
geographic origin62. TOP reduces the incidence of CHD

by about 20% and particularly that of major defects63.
It is unclear whether mode of conception can influence
the decision of ART couples towards interruption of their
‘precious’ pregnancies, in cases of CHD64. To overcome
this potential bias, the meta-analysis was conducted
considering only studies in which the incidence of TOP
was well documented. Prenatal surveillance may also
show considerable variations and it is generally believed
to be more rigorous in ART than in non-ART pregnancies,
with potential increase of detection rate63–65. However,
all studies included in the meta-analysis reported similar
standard prenatal and postnatal care methodology.
Maternal age has a well-known association with
major chromosomal defects associated with CHD66,
but also represents an independent risk factor for
some non-chromosomal CHD67. This could explain
why, despite exclusion of all chromosomal defects, the
odds ratio decreased only slightly after adjustment for
maternal age (Figure 6). In other studies, the adjustment
for maternal age did not modify the association between
ART and CHD5,8. However, a recent experiment in the
mouse model confirmed such age-related risk for CHD
and proposed preventive lifestyle interventions68. Older
women can have additional risk factors of CHD such as
pregestational diabetes, autoimmune disease, infection,
drug exposure, poor oocyte quality, uterine aging or
other causes of infertility.
Subanalysis excluding twins confirmed the findings of
the pooled analysis and that of a previous study14. A
slight decrease of the overall effect was expected after
exclusion of monochorionic twins, but this was not

Giorgione et al.
obtained by our analysis, most likely due to the rarity
of both monochorionicity and CHD69–71.
Qualitative analysis summarizing data collected from
four studies concerning types of CHD associated with
IVF/ICSI 4,7,51,59 (Figure 7 and Table 1) showed that VSD
were more frequent in IVF/ICSI, whereas TOF and TGA
were more common in pregnancies conceived sponta-
neously. This issue remains unresolved and controversial,
being consistent with results reported by Reefhuis et al.4
and divergent from other studies that showed a specific
association between ART and conotruncal defects, in
particular TOF5,55. These qualitative data should be eval-
uated with caution as adjustment for confounding factors
is impossible and there is potential selection bias related
to different approaches of ART and non-ART patients.
A recent meta-analysis from our group showed that
IVF/ICSI pregnancies present placental dysfunction with
lower pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A)
and higher free β-human chorionic gonadotropin con-
centrations in the first trimester72. Recent data also
show that, in pregnancies with isolated major CHD,
there is significantly lower PAPP-A and placental growth
factor in the absence of impaired placental perfusion
and increased risk of pre-eclampsia73,74. Therefore, it
is reasonable to hypothesize that IVF/ICSI pregnancies
present an increased risk of CHD as a consequence of
early placental dysfunction.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of our study include that it is the first systematic
review and meta-analysis focussing on the incidence of
CHD in a specific subset of ART pregnancies (IVF/ICSI);
it provides evidence suggesting the need for increased
fetal surveillance in IVF/ICSI pregnancies with fetal
echocardiography, particularly in twins; and it provides
preliminary data summarizing type of CHD associated
with IVF/ICSI (mainly VSD).
Our study has some limitations. ART pregnancies
encompass many different techniques such as OI, IUD,
IVF and ICSI and there are several other variables that
could affect fetal development and pregnancy outcome,
including different drug protocols of ovarian controlled
stimulation, methods of gametes and embryonic micro-
manipulation including cryopreservation and PGS/PGD,
transfer of blastocyst vs cleavage stage embryos, sperm
retrieval techniques and sperm/egg/embryo donation.
We considered only IVF/ICSI pregnancies in which both
sperm and egg are handled medically. The association
between ICSI and fetal anomalies is controversial8,11,12.
Subanalysis of IVF vs ICSI was impossible in our
study due to paucity of data38. Evaluation of cause of
infertility was also not possible and this can be associated
with congenital malformation, rather than IVF/ICSI
treatments8,13,15,75,76. Infertile couples achieving preg-
nancy naturally after a significant delay (> 12 months or
had previous IVF/ICSI treatment) are likely to be the best
control group to study the risk of CHD; nevertheless,
only a few studies have analyzed this15,47,76. Moreover,
the detection rate of CHD varies due to timing of
assessment, expertise of the examiner and methodology
used. It is possible that, in the IVF/ICSI group, prenatal
surveillance may have been more accurate resulting in a
greater detection (and incidence) of CHD.
Finally, CHD is a heterogeneous group of disorders
including both severe and life-threatening diseases and
minor defects amenable to spontaneous resolution, such
as isolated small VSD77–79. Therefore, since malformation
assessment was performed across a wide time span in the
studies, some types of minor CHD could have been missed
in both groups.

This

an

CHD
in
IVF/ICSI pregnancies as compared with those conceived
spontaneously, by about 50%. We recommend fetal

in
all
pregnancies
from
IVF/ICSI
in accordance with recent AHA practice guidelines22
with

referral
to
specialist
care
in
selected
cases. This method should improve prenatal diagnosis,
management and referral of affected pregnancies for
delivery and pre-/postnatal intervention, with potential
improvement of outcome80. Future studies on ART
should investigate further the role of imprinting disorders
in CHD (Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome), stratify for
maternal age or ovarian reserve and develop primary
prevention study protocols on the association between
periconceptional intake of folic acid supplements and
the
risk
of
CHD81–83,

on
the
role
of
other
micronutrients such as the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
in cardiogenesis84. While research on this topic gets
underway, the administration of a high-dose of folic acid
supplementation would be desirable in IVF/ICSI patients.
