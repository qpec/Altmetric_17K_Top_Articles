SUMMARY
Natural genetic variation in the human genome is a
cause of individual differences in responses to med-
ications and is an underappreciated burden on
public health. Although 108 G-protein-coupled re-
ceptors (GPCRs) are the targets of 475 (�34%)
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)-approved
drugs and account for a global sales volume of
over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence
of genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by
drugs is unknown. By analyzing data from 68,496
individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs
show genetic variation within functional regions
such as drug- and effector-binding sites in the
human population. We experimentally show that
certain variants of m-opioid and Cholecystokinin-A
receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug
response. By analyzing UK National Health Service
drug prescription and sales data, we suggest that
characterizing GPCR variants could increase pre-
scription precision, improving patients’ quality of
life, and relieve the economic and societal burden
due to variable drug responsiveness.
INTRODUCTION
A system of rigorous clinical trials and regulation exist to ensure
that a new drug is safe and effective when reaching the market.
However, natural human genetic variation(s) may cause individ-
uals to respond differently to the same medication. For instance,
genetic variation is linked to differences in response to anti-hy-
pertensive drugs such as b-blockers, angiotensin receptor
blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
(Johnson, 2008; Liggett et al., 2006; Mialet Perez et al., 2003).
Natural variation may also increase the propensity for adverse
reaction to drugs (Roden and George, 2002). Thus, genetic vari-
ation in drug targets may alter therapeutic efficacy and safety of
drugs. Inadequate accounting for adverse drug reactions cost a
fiscal burden of �30 billion US dollars annually in the US alone
(Sultana et al., 2013). Hence, understanding genetic variation in
drug targets has direct bearing on tailoring drug prescriptions
(i.e., personalized healthcare) to maximize efficacy and safety
while reducing side effects.
Many druggable targets for treatment of common diseases
involve G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate ther-
apeutic effects of �34% of the marketed drugs (Santos et al.,
2017; Rask-Andersen et al., 2014; Hauser et al., 2017). The sales
of GPCR targeting drugs represent a global market share of over
27% (The IDG Knowledge Management Center, 2016). Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs target at least 108
GPCRs (herein referred as GPCR drug targets), with an additional
66 receptors targeted by agents that are/were in clinical trials (Ta-
ble S1). Some drugs act through several targets and frequently
include GPCRs. Thus, GPCRs serve as primary and secondary
targets and determine the pharmacological profiles of the re-
sponses (Allen and Roth, 2011; Hauser et al., 2017). Although
studies have identified polymorphisms in GPCRs that lead to var-
iable or adverse drug response (Table S2), the prevalence and
impact of genetic variation among all human GPCRs that are tar-
geted by FDA-approved drugs remain unknown. In this study, we
present a comprehensive analysis and map of the pharmacoge-
nomics landscape of GPCR drug targets (Figure 1).
Prevalence and Incidence of Natural Variation in GPCR
Drug Targets
What is the prevalence of GPCR drug targets to harbor a
missense variation (MV) within an individual? An investigation
of complete genotype information for 2,504 ‘‘healthy’’ individuals
from the 1000 Genomes Project (Auton et al., 2015) showed that,
on average, an individual harbors 68 missense variations within
the coding region of one-third of the GPCR drug targets (Fig-
ure 2A). Of these, an average of 8 variants per individual have
previously

clinical
associations
with
altered
drug
response (Figure 2B). For instance, the heterozygous A307T vari-
ation (minor allele frequency [MAF]: 0.49) in the follicle stimu-
lating hormone receptor (FSHR) is prevalent in women who
develop polycystic ovary syndrome and is associated with a
higher responsiveness to exogenous FSH (Dolfin et al., 2011).
The G9S variant (MAF: 0.48) in the dopamine receptor 3
(DRD3) is linked to increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity
upon Levodopa treatment in subjects with Parkinson’s disease
(Rieck et al., 2016) (Figure 2C). Analysis of 1,762 trios (father,
mother, offspring) (Turner et al., 2017) revealed that 6 offsprings
harbor at least one new de novo MV in a GPCR drug target. In

 other words, a new, non-lethal, missense, germline mutation in a
GPCR drug target arises in 1 of every �300 newborns (Figure 2D).
These observations collectively suggest that GPCR drug targets
are likely to show substantial variation with new missense muta-
tions continuing to arise within their coding region.
Mutational Landscape of GPCR Drug Targets
In addition to MV, mutations that introduce a stop codon, cause
a frameshift or affect essential splice sites constitute loss-of-
function variations (LoF). The abundance of a protein-coding
gene may be affected by deletions and/or duplications (copy
number variation [CNV]). Such mutational events may alter the
functional property and/or change the abundance of a drug
target, either of which can influence drug efficacy, safety profile,
and adverse reaction. How much variability is seen in the GPCR
drug targets in the human population? To characterize the spec-
trum and prevalence of variation in GPCR drug targets, we inves-
tigated data from the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC),
which contains aggregated information on MVs, LoFs, and
CNVs for �60,000 ‘healthy’ individuals (Lek et al., 2016; Ruderfer
et al., 2016). This allowed us to characterize the mutational land-
scape of currently druggable GPCRs in the human population.
We find a total of 14,192 MVs in 108 GPCR drug targets,
with a mean of 128 rare (MAF <1 3 10�3) and 3.7 common
(MAF R 1 3 10�3) variants per receptor (Figure 3A and S1A).
On average, 25% of all positions in each of the 108 GPCRs
contain a MV (Figure 3A). GPCR drug targets have, on average,
a LoF mutation in 9.3 different positions per receptor (Figure 3B).
Our conservative estimate suggests that on average, at least 120
of the 60,706 individuals harbor such LoF mutations (i.e., stop
codon, essential splice site, and frameshift mutation) in a
GPCR drug target (0.2%; STAR Methods). In fact, a minimum
of one LoF variant has been observed in each of the 108 GPCRs
suggesting that heterozygosity, regulatory epistasis, and buff-
ering mechanisms such as allele-specific expression might
offset the effects of these drastic mutations in healthy individuals
(Lappalainen et al., 2011; Kukurba et al., 2014). Many GPCR drug
targets are also susceptible to CNVs and each of the GPCRs
analyzed had on average two duplications and three deletions
reported in the ExAC dataset (Figure 3C).
The m-opioid receptor (MOR; OPRM1), targeted by analgesics,
is one of the highly variable GPCR drug targets in the human
population (Table S3; Figure S1B). Integrating the information
about the extent of variability of GPCR targets with the FDA-
approved drugs revealed that several of the highly polymorphic
GPCRs are targeted by a large number of drugs (Figures
S2A–S2C). Thus, the extensive genetic variation in GPCR drug
targets may contribute to a substantial, and as yet underappre-
ciated, variability in drug responses between individuals in the
population.

 Putative Functional Impact of Variants in GPCR Drug
Targets
Can the observed variants of a receptor affect drug response
and what fraction of the variants is likely to have an impact?
We analyzed each of the MVs and investigated whether they
map to functionally relevant regions (i.e., ligand binding, effector
binding, allosteric sodium binding pocket, activation micro-
switches, and post-translational modification sites) to infer
possible impact (Figure 4A; Table S4). We identified functional
sites based on data from all 196 available GPCR-ligand crystal
structures; published literature and 2,544 experimentally vali-
dated post-translational modification sites (PTMs). 2,036 muta-
tions in the different receptors fall within known functional sites
(14.3% of 14,192 MVs; Z score = 3.7; p = 1.5 3 10�4; permuta-
tion test; Figure 4A; Table S4).
Examination of structures of GPCRs bound to FDA-approved
drugs revealed missense variation in the drug-binding pocket of
several receptors (Figure S3). For instance, 8 of the 9 positions in
the drug-binding pocket of maraviroc (antiretroviral drug) in the
CCR5 receptor exhibit polymorphism suggesting that patients
carrying such variant CCR5 receptors may show altered
response when treated for HIV infection. One in every 10 MV
resides in the G-protein- or b-arrestin-binding interface (Table
S4). For instance, of the 108 GPCR drug targets, we find that
for 67 receptors, there is at least one allele with a mutation in
the highly conserved 3.50350 position (GPCRdb numbering)
and for 41 receptors in the position 8.49349. These positions
make extensive non-covalent contacts with G-protein and
arrestin, respectively (Kang et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2017; Ras-
mussen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017) and hence are important
for intracellular signaling and drug response. This suggests that
individuals with such receptor variants may exhibit differences in

G-protein selectivity or biased signaling
and thus respond differently to the same
drug due to differences in GPCR signaling.
Missense variants were also observed in
other functional sites that influence GPCR
structure, dynamics, activation, allostery,
and function. These include mutations in
the allosteric sodium-binding pocket that
modulate receptor activity (Katritch et al., 2014), micro-switches
that are critical for receptor conformational changes (Trzaskow-
ski et al., 2012; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016; Wacker et al.,
2013), as well as post-translational modification sites such as
N-glycosylation in the N-terminal tail and phosphorylation in
the C-terminal tail that can influence receptor expression and
signaling, respectively (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2014) (Table S4;
Figure S4A). Individuals carrying such variant receptors may
respond differently to drugs because of altered basal activity
and signaling due to perturbation of residues important for
conformational changes. They may also show differences
because of altered expression, localization, trafficking, or desen-
sitization due to disruption of residues important for key post-
translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation sites).
Analysis of the putative functional impact of these variants by
SIFT and PolyPhen revealed that 9,522 of the 14,192 MVs have
the potential to cause a functional impact due to changes in
the physicochemical properties of the variant (Figure 4B; herein
referred to putative functional sites). Of these, 1,772 MVs map to
the 2,036 known functional sites described above (i.e., �87% of
the known functional site variations have been captured by SIFT
or PolyPhen; permutation test; Z score = 24.5; p < 1 3 10�5). MVs
with putative functional impact map more often within the trans-
membrane region and loops compared to variants of unknown
functional impact (Wilcoxon rank-sum test for normalized
segment lengths; TM segments: p < 2.2 3 10�16; extracellular

loops:

variations may influence receptor conformation, dynamics, and
signaling by affecting allosteric sites, effector selectivity sites,
receptor stability, and oligomerization (Congreve et al., 2017;
Costa-Neto et al., 2016; Flock et al., 2015, 2017; Gahbauer

et al., 2013, 2016; Wacker et al., 2017).
Pharmacological and Clinical Effects of Receptor
Variants
Are the individuals with variant receptors likely to respond differ-
ently to drugs? To investigate this, we compiled experimental
data on ligand-mutant GPCR interactions. Consistent with the
findings above, of the 49 experimentally tested mutations corre-
sponding to naturally occurring variants in 24 receptors, 32%
(16 of 49) show at least a 5-fold change in affinity or potency to
one of the ligands tested. Of these, 68% (11 of 16) fall within
known or putative functional sites (Table S4). These observations
suggest that naturally occurring variations in these drug targets
can affect drug binding.
We then analyzed data on drug-missense variant associations
from population-based clinical studies and compiled a dataset of
statistical association between mutations in 16 different posi-
tions among 11 receptors and altered response to one of 39
approved drugs (Figure 4B; Table S2). These drugs cover treat-
ment of diverse disorders ranging from metabolic, respiratory,
nervous, and reproductive system disorders to cardiovascular
diseases. We categorized the diseases for which a drug is
administered and linked this information with the variant, and

 the position on the receptor. Of the 16 variants that have been
associated with an altered drug response, four variants reside
within putative functional sites and have modest to high allele
frequencies (MAF = 0.18 – 0.49; Figure 4B). The rest of the
MVs reside outside of functional sites, suggesting that such
mutations may be affecting yet-to-be characterized functional
sites. Such sites may facilitate interactions with other factors
such as chaperones, membrane proteins, cytosolic proteins,
and membrane lipids, form a part of oligomerization interface
or linear motifs within disordered regions, or may influence
receptor biogenesis and expression homeostasis (Chen et al.,
2014; van der Lee et al., 2014; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2014; Bou-
crot et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2017).
Natural Receptor Variants Can Impact Drug Response
and Bias Signaling
In order to better understand the implications of the observed
variations, we experimentally investigated the impact of varia-
tions in two GPCR drug targets. We first analyzed the m-opioid
receptor, a highly variable GPCR drug target with one of the high-
est numbers of FDA-approved drugs (Figure S2). Previously
uncharacterized polymorphisms around the ligand-binding site
were selected and tested using a real-time bioluminescence
resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay, which monitors state
transitions in G-protein subunits upon receptor stimulation.
Quantifying the onset kinetics of G-protein activation by GPCRs
(KON) in this assay approximates potency, while the maximal
response amplitude (RMax) reflects the efficacy (Masuho et al.,
2015a) (Figures 5A, 5B, S5A, and S5B). Our assay could reliably
discriminate differential effects of full agonist (morphine) from
that of partial agonist (buprenorphine) and antagonist (naloxone),
compared to the endogenous agonist endomorphine-1 for the
wild-type receptor (Figure 5C).
Three of the variants exhibited a range of functional alterations
in m-opioid receptor signaling (Figures 5D and 5E). One variant
(M153V3x36) resulted in partial loss of function, reducing its
responses to both full agonists and the partial agonist. The two
other variants uniquely altered m-opioid receptor pharmacology
by biasing drug action in a drug selective fashion. Specifically,
the K235N3x40 variant behaved like the wild-type receptor in
response to the endogenous ligand. However, K235N3x40 dis-
played increased efficacy and potency to buprenorphine relative
to the wild-type. KON estimates show that the potency of
responses to full agonist morphine also increased, but that of en-
domorphine-1 decreased with no change in their efficacies
(RMax). Such behavior is expected to produce little difference in
baseline phenotypes in individuals carrying this mutation but
would be expected to augment responsiveness to treatment
with synthetic opioids, increasing the risk of an inadvertent
overdose. Another variant V302I6x55 exhibited gain-of-function
effects with increased potencies to full agonists and efficacy of
the partial agonist. Importantly, both gain-of-function variants
maintained G-protein signaling when treated with an antagonist
naloxone, an activity not seen with wild-type human m-opioid re-
ceptor but previously reported for the mouse receptor (Masuho
et al., 2015a). These findings suggest that individuals with this
variant receptor may manifest loss of efficacy when treated
with naloxone, which is typically administered as a detoxifying
agent in patients with opioid overdose. Further adverse reactions
might arise in response to combinatorial medications, e.g., bu-
prenorphine/naloxone if prescribed for management of opioid
abuse (Boyer, 2012; Orman and Keating, 2009). Thus, receptor
variants can have specific effects on the response to some drugs
that may not be evident from their response to natural ligand.
We also examined changes in G-protein-binding specificity by
investigating the effect of polymorphisms at the G-protein-bind-
ing interface in the cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR). This re-
ceptor couples to several G proteins to manifest its physiological
effects (Dufresne et al., 2006) (Figures 5F, 5G, S5C, and S5D).
Wild-type CCKAR robustly coupled to all four Ga subfamilies
(RMax in Figure 5H; for order of preference, see kON in Figure 5H).
Notably, two polymorphisms in the G-protein-coupling interface
(R139I3x50 and R150W34x54) differentially altered coupling prefer-
ence (Figures 5I, 5J, S5C, and S5D). The R150W34x54 variant
showed increased signaling efficacy via Gao and Gaq, but
diminished signaling efficacy via Ga13 with no alteration in Gas
coupling. In contrast, this variant exhibited diminished potency
of Gao, Gaq, and Ga13 but not Gas activation. On the other
hand, the R139I3x50 variant showed equally diminished efficacy
across all four G proteins, yet potency was diminished only for
Gao, Gaq, and Ga13 but not for Gas. Thus, polymorphisms at
the G-protein-coupling site can change the balance of G-pro-
tein-coupling profiles to the same drug. For these experiments,
we used caerulein, a previously FDA-approved drug (agonist,
which closely mimics the endogenous peptide agonist), that
was retracted from the market. Nevertheless, it highlights that
the susceptibility to adverse reactions to drugs can differ de-
pending on the variant, and that this should be considered in
the drug development process (especially, agonists) against
receptors that can couple to multiple G-protein families.
The effect of a polymorphism on drug response is more com-
plex than what can be measured in overexpression, cell-based
studies, as one needs to consider the entire human physiology.
Although drugs (especially agonists) require only certain abun-
dance of the receptor to bring about their maximal response,
the expression of a variant allele can (1) result in gain-of-function

 effects to certain drugs, or (2) alter effector selectivity that will be
relevant even in a heterozygous condition with a wild-type allele.
In this context, analysis of allele-specific expression data in
humans revealed that a significant fraction of the GPCR drug
targets are expressed in a mono allelic manner (Figure S5E;
p < 1 3 10�5). This suggests that the overall abundance of the
wild-type (WT) and variant receptor may vary in different hetero-
zygous individuals harboring the same receptor variant. Thus,
the presence of a wild-type allele may not always buffer the
effects of a variant allele.
Taken together, these observations provide a map of poten-
tial pharmacological implications of natural variation in human
GPCRs. To facilitate studies on yet-to-be characterized
variants, we provide a comprehensive receptor tool and visu-
alization in a new section of the GPCR database (Figure S6;

Drugs and Targets that Are Affected due to Functional
Site Variability
Which receptors have polymorphisms in a significant fraction of
their functional sites? For this, we analyzed the ExAC data and
identified receptors that show most and least variation in known
functional sites. On average, each receptor harbors at least one
polymorphism in 23% of the known functional sites (Table S5).
Among the highly variable GPCR drug targets are the somato-
statin SST5 receptor (SSTR5), cholecystokinin A receptor
(CCKAR), dopamine D5 receptor (DRD5), and the calcitonin
receptor (CALCR), all of which display amino acid alterations in
more than 40% of the known functional sites (Figure 6A). Thus,
for some receptors, the high incidence of variation (i.e., fraction
of known functional sites with a MV) makes drug effects more
likely, whereas the drug targets with less variability could be
expected to maintain the expected drug response. We then
developed a score for each drug to rank them based on how
likely they are to manifest altered response due to variability in
the fraction of known functional site in its drug target(s) (Table
S6). We find that ergoloid (for treating cardiovascular disease),
olanzapine, and asenapine (both for treating schizophrenia) are
drugs whose targets are most variable and thus are more likely
to manifest variable response (Table S6).
What fraction of the human population is likely to carry a
variant GPCR drug target with a mutation in a known or putative
functional site? We find that on average, 3.1% of the 2,504 indi-
viduals in the 1000 Genomes Project carry at least one allele with
a missense variation in a known functional site in any given
GPCR drug target (11.9% in known or putative functional site;
Table S5). For instance, over 86% and 69% of the individuals
carry at least one allele with a missense mutation in a known
functional site in the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) and
glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor, respectively, that are
targeted by the common antiemetic nabilone, and several anti-
diabetic drugs such as exenatide. In line with what we observed
for m-opioid receptor variants, this suggests that a substantial
fraction of the population might carry variant receptors and
remain healthy but have the potential to display differences in
drug response when treated with a drug. Using the genotype
information of mutations in known and putative functional sites,
we ranked drugs whose targets are most variable (i.e., fraction of
population) in their functional sites and thus are more likely to
manifest different response (Table S6).
The information and the framework that we describe here can
be used to prioritize drugs (Table S6) for pharmacovigilance in-
vestigations by regulatory bodies, post-market follow-up studies
such as in drug repurposing efforts, as well as in personalizing
prescriptions (e.g., dose, treatment regime, etc.). The informa-
tion on the spectrum and prevalence of receptor variation (Table
S5) can also be used for patient stratification of those entering
clinical trials in order to maximize success in clinical outcomes.
Possible Economic Impact of Drug Target Variability
Just in the UK alone, the National Health Service spent
�1.7 billion pounds in primary care for GPCR targeting drugs
in 2016 (�21% of all drug cost). What is the economic burden
of drug cost associated with genetic variation in GPCR drug tar-
gets? For this, we investigated all the 279 FDA-approved drugs
that are prescribed actively in the UK, the number of prescribed
items for a 6-year duration as available in the National Health
Service health records (2011–17), and the cost associated with
prescriptions. Drugs that are highly prescribed bind to receptors
that are polymorphic within known and putative functional sites
in the human population (Figure 6B). We find the same trend
when considering LoF and CNVs (Figures S7A and S7B). For
example, the highly polymorphic drug target, m-opioid receptor,
mediates the effect of morphine, tramadol, codeine, buprenor-
phine, and fentanyl among other drugs (n = 22) that are
prescribed over 4 million times each month and account for sales
of more than 432 million British Pounds (GBP) per year just in the
UK. Even if a small fraction (7%, from Table S5) of these prescrip-
tions are ineffective or lead to unexpected adverse reactions,
such a difference may contribute to a differentially effective treat-
ment outcome and a significant economic burden (an estimate of
�30 million GBP per year in the UK alone).

considering known and putative functional sites as well as homo-
zygosity/heterozygosity, and economic burden estimates, we
present an interactive resource at http://gpcrdb.org/mutational_
landscape/economicburden. In this simplistic estimate of eco-
nomic burden (STAR Methods), each prescription is treated as
being made for a separate individual due to patient anonymity
(i.e., we do not account for the recurrent prescription of the
same individual). Furthermore, information about the dose per
prescription, and how this has been altered based on patient
response is not considered. While we do not independently
weigh the variables in our equation, at the level of an individual,
the estimates can be higher or lower depending on the exact
response due to the polymorphism (i.e., known and putative
functional site, homozygosity, heterozygosity, neutral, loss- or
gain-of-function effects) and the patient’s alternative manage-
ment by the National Health Service.
Providing a broad estimate, in the UK, the possible economic
burden on the National Health Service due to ineffective pre-
scription of drugs targeting GPCRs could range between
14 million (considering % of individuals with both alleles having
a mutation only in known functional sites) and 501 million
(considering % of individuals with at least one allele having a
mutation in known or putative functional sites) GBP annually
(Figure 6C; Table S7; STAR Methods). These estimates do not
take into account other sources of economic burden such as
hospital prescriptions, nature of the illness (e.g., chronic v/s
short-term treatment for acute disease), age of patient (i.e.,
life-years of treatment), mutations outside of the coding region
that affect drug target expression level, associated additional
patient care and additional hospital costs in the case of adverse
drug reaction. The calculations suggest that polymorphisms in
GPCR drug targets may constitute a substantial, unaccounted
healthcare expense. Thus, investing efforts on understanding
and actively incorporating the effect of drug target polymor-
phisms and drug response in trials and the clinic has the

 potential to curtail the recurrent, unaccounted expenditure on
public health.
Future studies should carefully collect more information and
consider various factors such as the exact effect of heterozy-
gous nature of a receptor polymorphism (i.e., loss of function,
gain of function, buffering), the dose and ways in which drugs
are prescribed (e.g., repeat prescriptions), efficacy is measured
in clinical practice, and drug kinetics (that will vary in different in-
dividuals). These factors will be different depending on the drug,
receptor, individual, disease, country and medical practice, and
need to be considered for each receptor and drug independently
to obtain robust estimates of economic burden due to variable
drug response. We hope that the resource and analysis platform

Figure 7. GPCR Variants Can Contribute to Altered Drug Response
(A) Receptor response outcome upon binding to an endogenous ligand binding (E) and upon drug treatment (D). A receptor variant may induce phenotype-altering
(e.g., disease) perturbations (endogenous ligand) and/or altered drug response (and combinations thereof). The position of the missense variation (top right)
renders its effect. Some mutations may have no effect on the binding of the endogenous ligand or the drug and are entirely neutral. Mutations in/near the ligand-
binding interface might affect endogenous ligand signaling, drug response, or both. Mutations in the effector-binding interface (G protein/arrestin) most likely
affect both endogenous ligand signaling and drug response.
(B) Differences in drug response due to different mutations between individuals in a population. The drug target variation spectrum may differently affect individual
drug responses by potentially altering ligand potencies and efficacies, receptor conformation, surface expression, and/or biasing signaling. Personalized target
sequencing could facilitate prognosis of a patient’s drug response. Additionally, pharmacological characterization of genetic variants that have been cataloged in
humans could foster precision prescription.

DISCUSSION
Despite the importance of GPCRs as a major family of drug
targets, no receptor variants are included in the labeling informa-
tion of drugs (FDA, 2014; Thompson et al., 2014; Raimondi et al.,
2017). Although most variants have minor consequences and are
not described in the literature, even severe adverse effects are
estimated to only be reported in 1%–10% of cases (Giacomini
et al., 2007), possibly due to a lack of a single post-marketing
surveillance system for registering such effects. Additionally,
the effects that drugs produce are often confounded by drug-
drug interactions due to their combinatorial use, overlap with
disease symptoms, and general health status of the patient.
Disentangling the contribution of the variation with respect to
the disease condition or physiological differences and drug
treatment outcomes can help understand how and why certain
mutations are buffered under normal physiological conditions
in the healthy human population but could cause different re-
sponses to drugs (Figure 7A).
While significant efforts are under way for generating large-
scale information on genome variation, there is still a huge gap
between generating such data and understanding the impact
of genome variation (Gallion et al., 2017). Moreover, there are
limited experimental resources and efforts for mechanistic un-
derstanding of the effects of natural variation. As a first step,
detailed characterization of the various polymorphisms in a given
GPCR with different doses of FDA-approved drugs from the rele-
vant cells and in native condition can provide insights into
predicting individual responses, leading to more precise pre-
scriptions (Figure 7B).
Genetic factors and polymorphisms outside of the coding
region can aggravate or alleviate drug response. For instance,
synonymous substitutions in exons and mutations within introns
can affect splicing patterns; mutations in the inter-genic region
can affect regulatory elements and influence the expression
levels of drug targets (Ward and Kellis, 2012), both of which
can affect drug response. Variation in downstream effectors
(e.g., G proteins, arrestin, GRKs) or enzymes that metabolizes
drugs (e.g., cytochrome P450) or those that regulate drug uptake
can contribute to altered drug reaction (Evans and McLeod,
2003). Other factors such as difference in drug absorption,
food effects, tissue distribution, clearance, drug administration
compliance, as well as heterogeneity in the disease etiology
can all contribute to variability in drug response (Sim and Ingel-
man-Sundberg, 2011; Lauschke et al., 2017). On the other end
of the spectrum, buffering mutations, epistatic interactions,
allele-specific expression, and the heterozygous nature of the
mutations within an individual might minimize the potential
effects of a polymorphism in a drug target under normal drug-
free conditions (Lappalainen et al., 2011; Kukurba et al., 2014;
Miosge et al., 2015). Thus, it is important to characterize all rele-
vant mutations in the human population, in the right experimental
setting, to delineate the direct effects of polymorphisms on drug
responses while addressing these issues on a receptor-by-re-
ceptor and drug-by-drug basis.
Until recently, drug prescriptions had not been guided by
pharmacogenomics, due to the cost and complexity needed to
identify, analyze, and interpret genetic variation data (Relling
and Evans, 2015). With the advent of sequencing technology
and increased international efforts such as the 1000 Genomes
Project, ExAC/gnomAD, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
among others, we are in a unique position with unprecedented
access to the vast information on polymorphisms in the healthy
and diseased individuals. Characterizing the effects of such var-
iants can be an important step in the design and interpretation of
clinical trial studies and could be translated into pre-clinical
testing to minimize adverse effects based on pharmacogenom-
ics considerations at a much earlier stage. This can supersede
the one-size-fits-all approach in drug treatment, help to prioritize
drugs for post-marketing follow-up studies and thus can serve
as an important step to personalized optimization of the dosing
for already-approved drugs.
In light of the guidelines provided by the FDA for labeling drugs
(US Food and Drug Administration, 2013), the findings presented
here underscore the importance of characterizing the drug target
variants for personalized medicine. Furthermore, access to com-
plete genotype data will be critical to assess the individual risk,
prevalence of variation, and their potential impact on adverse
drug response. Characterizing variants has the potential to also
shed light into receptor biology and help discover principles of
how different ligands (e.g., agonists, antagonists, etc.) mediate
signaling by binding at allosteric and orthosteric sites. Efforts
such as the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Con-
sortium, Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics, Pharmacogenomics
Research Network, among others are already under way. Dedi-
cated,large-scaleefforts,similartotheENCODEproject,forphar-
macological characterization of the variants of drug targets would
be vital to accomplish this goal. The conceptual framework pre-
sented here can be adapted to study other drugs and drug targets
such as ion channels, kinases, and nuclear receptors. We hope
that the findings from our study and the resource that we present
will fuel and equip further advances in personalized medicine.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell Lines and Tissue Culture
HEK293T/17 cells were grown in culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
MEM non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin) at 37�C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. This cell line is derived from a female and was purchased
from ATCC.
METHOD DETAILS
Use of generic residue numbering systems to compare GPCR positions
In order to make the findings presented here applicable to all GPCRs, the GPCRdb numbering system (http://gpcrdb.org) was used
throughout this study (Isberg et al., 2015). The structure-based GPCRdb numbering scheme is an adaption of the sequence-based
Ballesteros-Weinstein scheme with corrections for helix bulges and constrictions. GPCRdb numbers are distinguished by a unique
separator x and may be used alone, e.g., 5x47, or together with one of the sequence-based schemes (such as Ballesteros-Wein-
stein), e.g., 5.46x47. Cross-class comparisons of generic residue positions (note, that e.g., 6x50 in Class A does not correspond
to 6x50 in Class B) were conducted according to a class residue translation table (Isberg et al., 2015). The offset to the Class A
x.50 to the corresponding Class B position can be deduced from following offsets: TM1-7: 4, 7, 4, 0, �4, 5, 4. Class A to C is translated
with the following offset for TM1-7: 4, �4, 4, �10, 0, 2, �5. Class A to F is translated by TM1-7: �3, �1, 0, 0, 4, �1, 0. For example, the
Class C 4x50 position corresponds to the 4x60 position in Class A receptors.
Datasets
FDA-approved drugs and their GPCR targets
All FDA-approved drugs and agents that are/were in clinical trials that target GPCRs were obtained from GPCRdb (Hauser et al.,
2017). In this list, every single FDA-approved drug-receptor interaction has a source reference article obtained via DrugBank (ver.
5.0.7) (Law et al., 2014) and literature search. The respective references (PubMed IDs) are available as annotation. Other annotations
include primary and secondary targets of approved drugs and additional targets that reached clinical trials. For the latter, information
about whether it is still in clinical trials (‘‘ongoing’’) or terminated is provided. Approved agents that are close analogs of the equivalent
endogenous ligands are noted. The list of drug-GPCR interactions is provided in Table S1. Please see www.gpcrdb.org/drugs/
drugbrowser (for all drug-receptor pairings) and www.gpcrdb.org/drugs/drugmapping (for a GPCR drug target overview). The data-
set from Hauser et al. (Hauser et al., 2017) contains 475 FDA-approved drugs that target 108 GPCRs. Additionally, it contains 532
agents in clinical trials (discontinued and ongoing) targeting a total of 165 receptors. Of these, 66 receptors do not have any FDA-
approved drug (i.e., not part of the 108 GPCR drug targets).
Genotype data
To estimate the number of coding loci with missense mutations (with respect to the reference human genome GRCh37/hg19) within
the GPCR drug targets in an individual, we obtained genotype data for 2,504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project (Auton et al.,

 2015). Each of the genomes of the 2,504 individuals was separately investigated for missense variants in GPCR drug targets and their
clinical association with altered drug response in literature.
De novo mutations data
To estimate the de novo missense mutation rate within GPCR drug targets, we obtained de novo mutations from 1,762 control trios
(without any reported pathological conditions) compiled from ten different studies from denovo-db (Turner et al., 2017).
Genetic variation data
We retrieved natural genetic variation data for all GPCRs from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), which compiled exome-
sequencing data from various large-scale cohorts spanning 60,706 unrelated individuals from 6 distinct human populations. We ex-
tracted polymorphism data for the coding-region of the 108 GPCR drug targets and GPCRs that reached clinical trials (n = 66) via their
respective Ensembl transcript IDs as used in the GPCRdb (Table S5). Minor Allele frequencies (MAFs) were calculated as the ratio of
allele counts of the less frequent allele to the total number of alleles at that locus. Each variant was mapped to its respective structural
segment (e.g., transmembrane regions, intra-cellular loops, extra-cellular loops, etc.), generic residue position (i.e., GPCRdb
numbering), receptor class, ligand-type and family classification according to the GuideToPharmacology (Southan et al., 2016)
and GPCRdb (Munk et al., 2016a) using custom R and python pandas scripts.
Densities (number of MVs normalized to the protein length) were calculated using the respective protein length. Missense variants
were categorised into ‘‘changed’’ and ‘‘similar’’ depending on whether the amino acid substitution switched defined categories such
as hydrophobic (‘A’, ‘C’, ‘F’, ‘I’, ‘L’, ‘M’, ‘V’, ‘W’, ‘Y’), aromatic (‘F’, ‘H’, ‘W’, ‘Y’), polar uncharged (‘S’, ‘T’,’N’, ‘Q’), helix breakers
(‘P’, ‘G’), negative (‘D’, ‘E’) and positive (‘H’, ‘K’, ‘R’) or remained within the same category. Loss of function (LoF) mutations was
extracted by filtering for essential splice sites, gained stop codon or frameshift mutations. As no genotype data were available, to
calculate the number of individuals with a LoF mutation, we estimated the minimum number of individuals with LoF mutations.
For this, we extracted positions within a GPCR drug target with the highest allele count for LoF mutations and corrected for homo-
zygous individuals (i.e., the number of homozygotes were subtracted from the total allele count to arrive at the number of heterozy-
gous individuals). This number (minimum population frequency) reflects the minimum number of heterozygous individuals, who carry
at least one LoF mutation in a GPCR drug target. Copy number variations (CNVs) were analyzed from 59,898 human exomes for all
GPCR drug targets (Ruderfer et al., 2016). For a total of 82 receptor genes out of the 108 GPCR drug targets, CNVs could be confi-
dently called. We calculated the z-score for each category (number of missense variants, missense variant density, number of loss of
functions, loss of function minimum population frequency, number of deletions and number of duplications) by
z � score = x � m
s
where:
x is the observed value for the category considered.
m is the mean of the 108 GPCR drug targets in a given category.
s is the standard deviation of the 108 GPCR drug targets in a given category.
The absolute value of the z-score represents the distance between the individual observed value and the population mean in units
of standard deviation. We then used hierarchical clustering ‘heatmap.20 from ‘gplots’ in R to identify receptors that are highly poly-
morphic in multiple mutation categories (Figure S1B).
Estimation of putative functional impact of variants in GPCR drug targets
An analysis of the putative functional impact of variants was obtained using SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2003) (sorting intolerant from
tolerant) and PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2013) (polymorphism phenotyping). A missense variant position was classified as a putative
functional site if SIFT (0-1; 0-0.05: deleterious, > 0.05: tolerated) or PolyPhen outcome (0-1; 0-0.1: benign, 0.1-0.2: possibly
damaging, > 0.2: probably damaging) predicted a deleterious or possibly damaging outcome. This resulted in the identification of
9,522 variants (referred to as putative functional sites).
Engineered in vitro mutations
Data on 28,779 experimentally characterized in vitro mutations was retrieved from the GPCRdb (Pa
´ ndy-Szekeres et al., 2017). From
this dataset, we extracted 9240 mutants for human receptor constructs and with reported effect values on ligand affinity/potency.
This includes experimental values for different ligands for a total of 1,996 distinct receptor positions. Additionally, all experimental
data obtained by investigating orthologous receptors from related species such as mouse, rat, hamster, dog, pig and rhesus ma-
caque were included if the corresponding generic structural-alignment position in the human receptor was identical in amino acid
(Isberg et al., 2015). The combined dataset comprised of 13,223 mutants in 68 distinct receptors and a total of 928 unique ligands.
We then looked for identical amino acid substitutions (same receptor, position, wild-type and mutant amino acid) that mimicked a
naturally occurring variant in the ExAC dataset for the 108 GPCR drug targets. In cases where there were multiple data points, we
considered maximum fold changes. (Table S4). A cut-off of 5-fold for the maximal absolute fold changes was applied for experimental
in vitro support of impact on drug response (Munk et al., 2016b).

 Clinical annotations
Clinical information about missense variant-drug pairs with reported changes in efficacy, dosage or toxicity/ADR were manually
curated from the literature and PharmGKB, which aggregates the impact of human genetic variation on drug response (https://
www.pharmgkb.org/). We obtained the level of evidence for each association as listed in PharmGKB. If it was not available, we as-
signed the evidence level based on PharmGKB criteria (https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/clinAnnLevels), so as to guide the reader in
terms of the evidence that is available for a particular clinical association with a receptor variant. All figures and text referring to clinical
associations have been limited to a level of evidence of 3 or above (3, 2 and 1). In this annotation scheme, 4 is the lowest level of
evidence and 1 is the highest level of evidence. Disease annotations were extracted from the indications in the drugs@FDA database
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/) or the actual study that reported the altered drug response. Higher disease
ontology categories were assigned using the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) retrieved from the Open Targets database
(Koscielny et al., 2017). Corresponding positions and amino acid substitutions of reported SNP identifiers were retrieved using
BioMart for the ‘‘canonical transcripts’’ as stored in GPCRdb (Table S5) (Smedley et al., 2015). Network analysis between disease
categories, drugs and missense variants were done using Cytoscape 3.4.
Allele-specific expression data
We obtained information on allele-specific expression of genes from published literature (Savova et al., 2016). Briefly, genes were
classified as those with monoallelic and biallelic expression, by integrating gene-expression data and specific chromatin signatures
of gene expression (co-occurrence of silencing mark on Histone H3K27me3 and active mark H3K36me3 on the gene body) in six
different cell types. We assessed for enrichment of GPCR drug targets among genes with monoallelic expression using permutation
test.
Fraction of receptor length with a polymorphism or population with variant receptor
For each of the GPCR drug targets we calculated: (i) the ratio of receptor length with missense variation in a known functional sites per
GPCR drug target using the ExAC data (Table S5) and (ii) the fraction of affected individuals in the human population (n = 2,504; based
on the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, Table S5). The fraction of affected individuals was calculated using four different criteria by
considering individuals who have a variation in (i) known functional sites in both alleles (homozygous), (ii) known functional sites in at
least one allele (i.e., homozygous and heterozygous), (iii) known or putative functional sites in both alleles (homozygous), and (iv)
known or putative functional sites in at least one allele (i.e., homozygous and heterozygous). Known functional sites include ligand
binding, effector binding, post-translational modification site, sodium binding site and micro-switches. Putative functional sites
include those predicted to be deleterious based on SIFT or PolyPhen.
Drug scores for prioritization
We developed a score for each FDA-approved drug (n = 475) to rank them based on how likely they are to manifest altered response
due to the prevalence of known functional site variability of its target(s) in the human population.
The drug score (Table S6) based on the fraction of known functional site that are polymorphic in a drug target using the ExAC data
was calculated by:
variability score for a drug; Spolymorphic =
X
fraction of known functional sites that are polymorphic for each receptor targeted by the drug
The drug score (Table S6) based on prevalence of affected individual (i.e., 1000 Genomes Project) was calculated by:
variability score for a drug; Saffected% = fraction of affected individuals with a MV in a functional site of the respective drug targetðsÞ
The fraction of affected individuals was calculated using four different criteria by considering individuals who have a variation in (i)
known functional sites in both alleles (homozygous), which is the most conservative, (ii) known functional sites in at least one allele
(i.e., homozygous and heterozygous), (iii) known or putative functional sites in both alleles (homozygous), and (iv) known or putative
functional sites in at least one allele (i.e., homozygous and heterozygous), which is the least conservative.
National Health Service prescription data
Every month, the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK publishes anonymised data about the drugs prescribed by general prac-
titioners. National Health Service data were retrieved from openprescribing.net (DataLab-EBM, 2017) (08/2017) for the list of drugs
targeting GPCRs and mapped back to their reported target of therapeutic action. From the 475 queried FDA-approved drugs, data
were available for 279 drugs targeting 92 distinct GPCRs (not all FDA-approved drugs are prescribed in the UK due to alternative
treatments). Items are the number of times the drug appeared on a prescription form that month (defined by National Health Service
Digital as ‘‘A prescription item is a single supply of a medicine, dressing or appliance written on a prescription form’’). The actual cost
is the estimated cost to the National Health Service, which is usually lower than Net Ingredient Cost (‘‘the basic price of a drug, i.e. the
price listed in the Drug Tariff or price lists’’). Openprescribing.net provides the actual cost by subtracting the average percentage
discount per item received by pharmacists based on the previous month from the Net Ingredient Cost, but adding in the value of
e4
Cell 172, 41–54.e1–e8, January 11, 2018
 a container allowance for each prescription item (DataLab-EBM, 2017). Total National Health Service spending was aggregated over
each month of 2016 and compared with the total GPCR-targeting drugs to calculate the share for the GPCR targeting drugs (Figure 1).
Indications were grouped according to the British National Formulary (BNF), which is a reference book containing the standard list of
medicines prescribed in the UK and also includes information on indications, dosage and side effects.
Estimation of economic burden
The economic burden estimate was calculated using the following formula:
estimated economic burden per drug ð£Þ = average NHS cost per drug per year ð£Þ x
%individuals with a MV in a functional site of the respective drug targets
where:
d The average National Health Service cost is the average yearly cost over a 4-year period (2013-2016) per GPCR targeting drug
that is listed (n = 279). 2012 and 2017 have partial sales data and were not considered.
d % Individuals is the percentage of affected individuals with a missense variant in a functional site of the respective drug target(s)
(n = 2,504 individuals from 1000 Genomes Project genotype data as a representative for the UK population; this data includes
non-Caucasian populations as well) (Table S5).
d The % of affected individuals was calculated using four different criteria by considering individuals who have a variation in
(i) known functional sites in both alleles (homozygous), which is the most conservative, (ii) known functional sites in at least
one allele (i.e., homozygous and heterozygous), (iii) known or putative functional sites in both alleles (homozygous), and (iv)
known or putative functional sites in at least one allele (i.e., homozygous and heterozygous), which is the least conservative.
d Known functional sites include ligand binding, effector binding, post-translational modification site, sodium binding site and
micro-switches. Putative functional site include those predicted to be deleterious based on SIFT or PolyPhen (see above).
More specifically, for each drug we collected the respective targets and computed economic burden using the following four
criteria above: considering (i) % individuals with homozygous alleles in known functional sites, (ii) % individuals with at least one
variant allele in a known functional site, (iii) % individuals with homozygous alleles in known or putative functional sites and (iv)
% individuals with at least one variant allele in a known or putative functional sites.
For these estimates, we have incorporated the following considerations (below). The economic burden estimates will vary if one
scales/factors these variables differently:
1. We have considered that each prescription (National Health Service data) is made for a unique individual, due to patient an-
onymity. Furthermore, information about the dose per prescription, and how this has been altered based on patient response is
not explicitly modeled.
2. The effect of known and putative site polymorphisms as well as homozygous/heterozygous conditions are all treated the same
way. One could also obtain estimates by weighing these variables differently on a case-by-case basis for each receptor/drug.
3. The focus has been prescription only from GPs. There might be significant additions to the economic burden if one also con-
siders hospital prescriptions.
4. We used the data from 1000 Genomes Project as representative of the UK population, which may vary depending on the
receptor.
5. We have not explicitly modeled the age, gender, nature of illness (chronic v/s short-term) and mutations in non-coding regions,
which may affect expression level of drug targets.
Interaction interface, functional, and structural site assignment
Post-translational modification sites
We obtained publicly available experimental data on post-translational modification sites for the GPCR drug targets (including
Ubiquitylation, Phosphorylation, Palmitoylation, Hydroxylation, N/O-linked Glycosylation, Sulfation, Prenylation, ADP-ribosylation,
Methylation, Sumoylation, Acetylation, Disulfide bond and S-Nitrosylation) from dbPTM (Huang et al., 2016). Additionally, all post-
translational modification sites from PhosphoSitePlus (03/2017) from low-throughput experimental techniques, proteomic mass
spectrometry and shotgun proteomic experiments were collected and combined with the dbPTM dataset (Hornbeck et al., 2015)
(Table S4). Each post-translational modification site was cross-validated for identical amino acids in both dbPTM and its correspond-
ing GPCRdb wild-type amino acid. For each receptor, we then obtained the post-translational modification sites with reported
missense variation.
Generic transmembrane ligand-interacting sites
Ligand interaction sites were extracted from all 196 available receptor-ligand crystal structure complexes featuring 43 unique
GPCR ligand-receptor complexes from Chordate organisms and higher (excluding organisms such as Herpesvirus 5 and Todarodes
Cell 172, 41–54.e1–e8, January 11, 2018
e5
 pacificus). The union of ligand-interacting positions were aggregated for each of the 42 unique crystallized receptors including
aromatic, polar, and hydrophobic interactions within 4.5 A
˚ of the co-crystallized ligand (Pa
´ ndy-Szekeres et al., 2017; Munk et al.,
2016b). This led to a total set of 457 ligand-binding residues. Ligand binding site definition for receptors without structural information
have been inferred from the receptor family level (based on NC-IUPHAR receptor family nomenclature obtained from GPCRdb) for
which structural information was available (e.g., dopamine D5 receptor ligand-binding site is inherited from dopamine D3 receptor). To
infer the ligand binding site from the crystallized receptor, we used only positions that have a generic numbering in the GPCRdb
numbering scheme (Isberg et al., 2015), which excludes ligand-interacting positions for most of the loops (three ECL2 positions,
including 34x52 at the top of the 7TM ligand cavity, are included). For ortholog receptors (e.g., mouse, rat, bovine), we inferred
generic positions only if the corresponding human residue is identical to the ortholog receptor. This allowed ligand-binding pocket
characterization for 24 families and a total of 139 receptors. We provide annotation as to whether a position is a known ligand-binding
site (LB) from a crystallized structure or an inferred one from a related structure of the same receptor family in Table S4.
Arrestin binding interface
All available GPCR-arrestin complexes (PDB: 4ZWJ, PDB: 4PXF, PDB: 5DGY, all are Class A rhodopsin structures) were retrieved
from the PDB and visualized using PyMol. The inter GPCR-arrestin residue contact network (RCN) for these structures was computed
using Arpeggio (Jubb et al., 2017) with the maximum range of interaction set to 4.5 A
˚ . The union of all interacting residue positions was
taken and corresponding residues (with same GPCRdb numbers) were retrieved from the GPCRdb WebServices. This led to the
identification of 29 arrestin contacting positions that were used for the effector interaction site analysis. Arrestin residue positions
were applied to other classes by their corresponding generic position (see Use of common residue numbering systems to compare
GPCR positions).
G protein binding interface
The inter GPCR-G protein residue contact network was generated as described for arrestin. For the class A interface, the b2AR-Gs
(PDB: 3SN6), A2A-Gsmini (PDB: 5G53) and Rhodopsin-Gt-C-peptide (PDB: 3DQB, PDB: 3PQR, PDB: 4A4M) were used. This led to the
identification of a total of 33 G-protein interacting positions on the receptor. The class B GPCR-G protein interface was calculated
using the Calcitonin Receptor-Gs (PDB: 5UZ7) and the GLP-1-Gs (PDB: 5VAI) structures. For class C and class F receptors, the union
of both class A and B interface positions were considered as the G protein coupling positions.
Microswitches
Residues involved in mediating the conformational transition during activation (microswitches) were obtained from the literature
(Trzaskowski et al., 2012). These include: D/E3x49, K/Y7x43, R3x50, F5x47, Y5x58, E6x30, T6x34, W6x48, P6x50, N7x49, P7x50, Y7x53, I3x40.
Additionally, we considered the ‘‘P-I-F’’ motif (P5x50, I3x40 and F6x44) as an important motif for conformational rearrangements
upon receptor activation (Wacker et al., 2013). The positions 3x46, 6x37 and 7x53 were also considered as microswitches due to
their importance in structural rearrangements (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016). Micro-switches were only considered for Class A
receptors.
Sodium ion pocket
Residue positions (n = 15) of the sodium pocket were extracted from Katritch et al. (Katritch et al., 2014) and comprised of N1x50,
V1x53, L2x46, A2x47, A2x49, D2x50, S3x39, L3x43, F6x44, W6x48, N7x45, S7x46, N7x49, P7x50, Y7x53. The Na+ pocket was only considered
for Class A receptors.
Structural site assignments
Segments of structural sites were extracted using class-specific multiple sequence alignments. Helix segments were assigned
based on a residue independent generic numbering position as described in the GPCRdb (e.g., 1x50 - > TM1). Residues falling be-
tween transmembrane regions were assigned to their respective loop region (extracellular and intracellular loops 1-3). Residues
before TM1 and after Helix 8 were assigned C-terminal and N-terminal, respectively.
Pharmacological validation
Selection criteria for in vitro variants
We performed functional analysis and pharmacological validation of mutations in two GPCRs for the ligand binding (OPRM) and
G protein binding (CCKAR). We selected the m-opioid receptor, due to its importance in analgesia, physical dependence and respi-
ratory depression. Additionally, m-opioid receptor is targeted by nearly 40 FDA-approved drugs and is one of the highly polymorphic
receptor. Specifically, a structural analysis identified 5 variants of potentially damaging or altering effects upon drug binding. These
include M153V3x36, K235M5.39x40, K235N5.39x40, V238I5.42x43 and V302I6x55. For the Cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) we inves-
tigated the effect of polymorphisms at the G protein binding interface, which is known to couple to several G proteins to produce its
physiological effects (Dufresne et al., 2006). We selected 7 variants at positions, which are potentially important to interact with the
G protein, that were predicted to be deleterious in SIFT and PolyPhen and all mutations changed their residue properties (see Genetic
variation data). These include R139I3x50, Q148E34x52, R150Q34x54, R150W34x54, E243K5x72, N304H6x26, V311E6x33. Experimental
outcome of all selected variants is provided in Figure S5.
Genetic constructs
Human wild-type and mutant receptors were synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) by GenScript. pCMV5 plasmids encoding
Gao, Gaq, and Gas were gifts from Dr. Hiroshi Itoh (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan). Plasmids encoding Venus
156-239-Gg1, and Venus 1-155-Gg2 were gifts from Dr. Nevin A. Lambert (Augusta University, USA) (Hollins et al., 2009).

Cell 172, 41–54.e1–e8, January 11, 2018
 masGRK3ct-Nluc construct were generated as reported previously (Masuho et al., 2015a). PTX-S1 in mammalian expression vector
was kindly provided by Dr. Eitan Reuveny (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) (Raveh et al., 2010).
Transient transfection
We coated 6-cm culture dishes during incubation for 10 min at 37�C with 2.5 mL of Matrigel solution (approximately 10 mg/mL growth
factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in culture medium). Cells were seeded into the 6-cm dishes containing Matrigel solution at
a density of 4 3 106 cells/dish. After 4 hr, expression constructs (total 10 mg/dish) were transfected into the cells using PLUS
(10 ml/dish) and Lipofectamine LTX (12 ml/dish) reagents. Venus 156-239-Gg1 (0.42 mg), Venus 1-155-Gg2 (0.42 mg), and
masGRK3ct-Nluc (0.42 mg) was transfected with different amount of Ga and receptor constructs. m-opioid receptor (2.52 mg),
cholecystoninin A receptor (2.52 mg), GaoA (0.42 mg), Gaq (0.84 mg), Gas (2.52 mg), or Ga13 (1.68 mg) was used. Empty vector
pcDNA3.1(+) was used to normalize the total amount of transfected plasmid DNA. PTX-S1 (0.42 mg) was transfected with Gaq,
Gas, and Ga13 to inhibit possible coupling to endogenous Ga belonging to Gi/o subfamily.
BRET assay for monitoring G protein activity
BRET experiments were performed as previously reported with slight modifications (Masuho et al., 2015a, 2015b). Sixteen to twenty-
four hours post-transfection, HEK293T/17 cells were washed once with BRET buffer (PBS containing 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.1%
glucose) and detached by pipetting with BRET buffer gently. Cells were harvested with centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min and resus-
pended in BRET buffer. Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 cells per well were distributed in 96-well flat-bottomed white microplates
(Greiner Bio-One). The Nluc substrate, furimazine, were purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tion. BRET measurements were performed using a microplate reader (POLARstar Omega or PHERAstar FSX, BMG Labtech) equip-
ped with two emission photomultiplier tubes. All measurements were performed at room temperature. The BRET signal is determined
by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by Venus-Gb1g2 (535 nm with a 30-nm band path width) over the light emitted by
masGRK3ct-Nluc (475 nm with a 30-nm band path width). The average baseline value recorded before agonist stimulation was sub-
tracted from BRET signal values, and the resulting difference (DBRET ratio) was plotted as traces. The transiently transfected cells
were stimulated by endomorphin-1 (100 mM), morphine (100 mM), buprenorphine (10 mM), naloxone (100 mM) for m-opioid receptor or
caerulein (30 mM) for CCKAR at 5 s. No agonist-induced activation of G proteins was detected from the negative control that omitted
CCKAR. Each trace represents the mean of the responses measured in three or six wells. The maximal value recorded upon agonist
stimulation was reported as RMax. The activation rate constants (kON) were obtained by fitting a single exponential curve to the traces
with Clampfit ver. 10.3 software (Molecular Devices).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Pharmacological validation
Statistical analysis to analyze the experimental data was performed with GraphPad Prism 6. Statistical parameters are reported in
Figure Legends. All graphs pertaining to the experimental data were made with SigmaPlot 12.5.
ESTIMATION OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Enrichment of receptors with allele-specific expression
Enrichment of GPCRs among genes with monoallelic expression was assessed with permutation tests by performing 100,000
randomizations. In each randomization, each GPCR was replaced with a random gene and the number of such randomly obtained
genes that overlapped with genes with monoallelic expression was noted. From the random distribution, we computed the Z-score,
which captures the distance of the actual number of observations (e.g., GPCRs with monoallelic expression) to the mean of random
expectation in terms of the number of standard deviations. We estimated p value as the ratio of the number of simulations where the
random observations were greater than or equal to the number of actually observed values to the total number of randomizations
(100,000).
Enrichment of MVs in known functional site
To assess for enrichment of MVs affecting known functional sites, we obtained a list of random sites with similar number of sites with
MV for all GPCRs and then counted the number of random sites that overlapped with known functional sites. We performed 100,000
such randomizations to obtain a distribution of random expectations. Z-score and p values were estimated as described above.
Statistical significance for overlap between known and putative functional sites
For assessing whether the overlap between known and putative functional sites (deciphered from SIFT and PolyPhen predictions)
was significantly higher than expected by chance, we randomly replaced each known functional site with a random site with a
missense mutation in GPCRs and noted how many of these random mutant sites overlapped with the putative functional sites.
We performed 100,000 such randomizations and obtained a distribution of expected overlap by chance. Z-score and p values
were estimated as described above.

 Statistical significance for putative functional sites in different structural segments
We estimated statistical significance of differences in the distribution of putative functional sites and uncharacterized sites in different
structural segments of GPCRs using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (Figures S4C; absolute counts and S4D; normalized
for segment length).

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
Missense variation mapping of specific receptors
To analyze and characterize the extent of genetic variation, we incorporated all missense variations and functional annotations into
the framework of the GPCRdb (http://www.gpcrdb.org/) that allows researchers to map all missense variants for a selected receptor,
using NC-IUPHAR receptor nomenclature, onto a snake–like diagram and helix-boxplot of the selected receptor residue topologies.
Further, information regarding amino acid substitution, allele counts, allele frequencies, functional annotations, SIFT/PolyPhen
scores and heterozygosity for each individual position is provided (www.gpcrdb.org/mutational_landscape/). A statistic page is
presented for an overview of genetic variation in GPCR drug targets (www.gpcrdb.org/mutational_landscape/statistics). Possible
economic impact of drug target variability can be analyzed and estimated for individual drugs and different groups of drugs via
http://www.gpcrdb.org/mutational_landscape/economicburden. The National Health Service spending on each drug can be
obtained from the drug-receptor pairing page, which includes specific information of the drug such as indication, target family, target
category (primary/secondary), status, drug type, mechanism of action and references (www.gpcrdb.org/drugs/drugbrowser). The
natural variation dataset can be downloaded in full, accessed via an extensive API (http://gpcrdb.org/services/reference/), or

 Figure S1. Frequency of Genetic Variants in GPCR Drug Targets, Related to Figure 3
(A) The allele frequency spectrum (ExAC data) of the 108 GPCR targets of approved drugs shows that most genetic variants are rare (single observations or allele
frequency % 0.01%). Common variants (> 0.01%) exist for 358 sites. The coloring shows missense variations with an amino acid property change (‘changed’) and
missense variations, where the mutant amino acid substitution is within the same class of amino acid properties (‘similar’).
(B) To assess the most polymorphic GPCR drug targets (rows) across different categories including for MVs, LoFs and CNVs, Z-scores were calculated within
categories (columns) and grouped by hierarchical clustering. Receptors with high genetic variation are highlighted in red (Table S3).

(A) Sortable variant table is provided for every receptor with more detailed information on the type and nature of each amino acid substitution, information about
allele counts and frequency, predicted functional impact scores (SIFT and PolyPhen) and functional site annotation.
(B) Genetic variation density (red intensity levels) on a GPCR classification tree (item ‘statistics’).
(C) Data points can be visualized for every selected non-olfactory GPCR (missense variants in red shown for adrb2_human) on a snake-like diagram (top) or a helix
plot (bottom) with additional information shown on mouse-over (allele count, allele frequency, amino acid change, number of homozygotes, predicted effects by
SIFT and PolyPhen).
(D) Missense variants can also be visualized on a consensus snake-like diagram for single families or ligand-types of GPCRs (gradient red for all Class A peptide
angiotensin receptors). Each position then gives the number of observed mutations and the list of observed amino acid changes.
(E) National Health Service spending data from 2011 to 2017 for 279 FDA-approved drugs. This is shown for Buprenorphine. The natural variation dataset can be
downloaded per receptor (www.gpcrdb.org/mutational_landscape/) or accessed programmatically via an extensive API.

Figure 6
(A–C) For each FDA-approved drug, a pot of the number of prescribed items by the National Health Service each month (y axis, logarithmic scale in thousands)
against (B) the percentage of individuals with loss of function mutations and (C) maximum number of copy number variations in its therapeutic GPCR target is
shown. Sales volume is shown in million GBP per month.
