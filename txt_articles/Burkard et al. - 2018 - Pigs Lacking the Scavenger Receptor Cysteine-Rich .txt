ABSTRACT
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has a
narrow host cell tropism, limited to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.
CD163 protein is expressed at high levels on the surface of specific macrophage
types, and a soluble form is circulating in blood. CD163 has been described as a
fusion receptor for PRRSV, with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5
(SRCR5) region having been shown to be the interaction site for the virus. As re-
ported previously, we have generated pigs in which exon 7 of the CD163 gene
has been deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in pig zygotes. These pigs express
CD163 protein lacking SRCR5 (ΔSRCR5 CD163) and show no adverse effects when
maintained under standard husbandry conditions. Not only was ΔSRCR5 CD163
detected on the surface of macrophage subsets, but the secreted, soluble pro-
tein can also be detected in the serum of the edited pigs, as shown here by a
porcine soluble CD163-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pre-
vious results showed that primary macrophage cells from ΔSRCR5 CD163 animals
are resistant to PRRSV-1 subtype 1, 2, and 3 as well as PRRSV-2 infection in vitro.
Here, ΔSRCR5 pigs were challenged with a highly virulent PRRSV-1 subtype 2
strain. In contrast to the wild-type control group, ΔSRCR5 pigs showed no signs
of infection and no viremia or antibody response indicative of a productive in-
fection. Histopathological analysis of lung and lymph node tissue showed no
presence of virus-replicating cells in either tissue. This shows that ΔSRCR5 pigs
are fully resistant to infection by the virus.
IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (PRRSV) is
the etiological agent of PRRS, causing late-term abortions, stillbirths, and respiratory
disease in pigs, incurring major economic losses to the worldwide pig industry. The
virus is highly mutagenic and can be divided into two species, PRRSV-1 and
PRRSV-2, each containing several subtypes. Current control strategies mainly involve
biosecurity measures, depopulation, and vaccination. Vaccines are at best only par-
tially protective against infection with heterologous subtypes and sublineages, and
modified live vaccines have frequently been reported to revert to virulence. Here,
we demonstrate that a genetic-control approach results in complete resistance to
PRRSV infection in vivo. CD163 is edited so as to remove the viral interaction domain
while maintaining protein expression and biological function, averting any potential
adverse effect associated with protein knockout. This research demonstrates a

P
orcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is arguably the most eco-
nomically important infectious disease affecting pigs worldwide. The causative
agent of PRRS is PRRS virus (PRRSV), a member of the Arteriviridae family and the order
Nidovirales. Infected pigs of all ages may present with symptoms involving inappe-
tence, fever, lethargy, and respiratory distress. However, the most devastating effects of
PRRSV infection are observed in young piglets and pregnant sows. In pregnant sows,
full abortions or death and mummification of fetuses in utero are observed, and
live-born piglets from an antenatal infection are often weak and display severe respi-
ratory symptoms (1–3). Piglets infected with PRRSV in early life can show diarrhea and,
more commonly, severe respiratory distress due to active PRRSV replication in pulmo-
nary macrophages and subsequent damage in lung tissues (4). Due to the reduction or
loss of pregnancies, death in young piglets, and decreased growth rates in all PRRSV-
infected pigs, it is estimated that the economic impact of PRRSV to pork producers in
the United States alone is more than $650 million annually (5, 6).
There are two different species of PRRSV with distinct geographic distributions:
PRRSV-1 is found primarily in Europe and Asia, overlapping the range of PRRSV-2, which
is found in Asia and the Americas. PRRSV-1 can be further divided into at least three
subtypes, currently based on open reading frame 7 (ORF7) sequences and geographical
distribution, with subtype 1 being pan-European and subtypes 2 and 3 currently being
limited to eastern Europe (7).
PRRSV has a very narrow host cell range, infecting only specific subsets of porcine
macrophages (8–10). Entry of PRRSV into macrophages has been shown to occur via
pH-dependent, receptor-mediated endocytosis (11, 12). Various attachment factors and
receptors have been indicated to be involved in the PRRSV entry process (reviewed in
reference 13). However, only the scavenger receptor CD163, also known as a hemo-
globin (Hb)-haptoglobin (Hp) scavenger receptor or p155, has been confirmed to be an
essential fusion receptor in vitro and in vivo (14–16). CD163 is expressed on specific
subtypes of macrophages. The extracellular portion of CD163 forms a pearl-on-a-string
structure of nine scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains and is anchored by
a single transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic domain (17). A proteolyti-
cally cleaved, soluble form of the protein ectodomain is found in the bloodstream and
is involved in the inflammation and ischemic repair response (18, 19). Transmembrane
anchoring and interaction with SRCR domain 5 (SRCR5) of CD163 were found to be
essential for successful infection with PRRSV (20, 21). CD163 has a variety of biological
functions, including mediating systemic inflammation and the removal of hemoglobin
from blood plasma (reviewed in references 21 and 22). Overexpression of CD163
renders nonsusceptible cells permissive to PRRSV infection (20), and it was found that
CD163 does not mediate internalization but is crucial for fusion (16).
Recent in vivo challenge experiments of pigs in which both copies of the CD163
gene had been knocked out using gene-editing technology confirmed that CD163 is
required for infection by PRRSV-2 and highly pathogenic PRRSV-2 (HP-PRRSV) (14, 23).
Gene-editing technology has also been used to generate pigs in which the CD163
SRCR5-encoding sequence has been replaced with a sequence encoding human
CD163L1 SRCR8 (24), in effect replicating in vivo the previous in vitro domain-swapping
experiment of Van Gorp and colleagues (25). This attempt to maintain CD163 function
rendered pigs and macrophages resistant to PRRSV-1 but not PRRSV-2 infection (24),
making this strategy ineffective in combating both PRRSV species. CD163 has important
biological functions, and the complete knockout could have a negative physiological
impact on the animal, particularly with respect to the inflammation response and/or
infection by other pathogens. Interestingly, whereas all the other eight SRCR domains

 have been shown to be involved in different biological functions, no specific role has
been associated with SRCR5, other than in PRRSV infection (21). Therefore, we gener-
ated pigs lacking SRCR5 by the deletion of exon 7 of CD163 using CRISPR/Cas9 editing
and showed that macrophages from these pigs were resistant to both PRRSV-1 and
PRRSV-2 infection in vitro (15). The aim of the experiments described here was to
determine whether our in vitro results would translate directly in vivo by conducting a
PRRSV challenge of pigs with a CD163 SRCR5 deletion. Furthermore, we aimed to
characterize the biological function of the modified CD163 protein (ΔSRCR5 CD163) as
both a soluble and a cell-bound protein.
RESULTS
Genome editing in zygotes for �SRCR5 CD163 pigs and breeding genotypically
uniform F2 pigs. Founder-generation (F0) animals carrying a deletion of exon 7 in the
CD163 gene, which encodes SRCR5 of the protein, were generated by CRISPR/Cas9
gene editing as previously described (ΔSRCR5 pigs) (15). Briefly, zygotes were micro-
injected with a combination of Cas9 mRNA and guide RNAs targeting sites flanking
exon 7, resulting in double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the deletion of the exon (Fig. 1A).
Cross-breeding of heterozygous founder animals and outbreeding with wild-type pigs
yielded a first generation composed of both heterozygous and biallelic edited animals
FIG 1 Generation of ΔSRCR5 pigs and experimental setup. (A) Genome editing to generate ΔSRCR5 pigs. Genome-edited founder animals were generated by
zygote injection of CRISPR/Cas9 editing reagents using Cas9 mRNA and two guide RNAs, sgSL26 and sgSL28, in combination to generate a deletion of exon
7 in CD163. Animals were bred to generate F1 and F2 generations, focusing on one genotype showing clean religation at the cutting sites of both guide RNAs.
Homozygous F2 animals carry this genotype in both alleles (bottom). (B) Structure prediction and expression of ΔSRCR5 in pulmonary alveolar macrophages
of F2 animals. Protein structure prediction using RaptorX points toward an intact protein product upon the deletion of SRCR5. (C) Experimental design of the
challenge study. Four homozygous (green) and 4 wild-type (orange) siblings from heterozygous/heterozygous mating of the F1 generation animals were
cohoused from weaning. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR amplification across exon 7 (see panel A) and by Sanger sequencing. Piglets were cohoused after
weaning and after acclimation to the specific-pathogen-free unit for 1 week and throughout the 14-day challenge experiment that was initiated by inoculating
each pig intranasally with 5E6 TCID50 of PRRSV-1 subtype 2 strain BOR-57 at day 0 and day 1 of the challenge. The piglets were 7 to 8 weeks of age at the start
of the acclimation period. (D) Piglets 1 day before the start of the challenge.

 (F1 generation) (15). We selected for breeding heterozygous F1 animals displaying a
“clean” deletion between the DSBs, i.e., no “on-target” sequence changes beyond the
desired deletion region. To generate a cohort with comparable genetic backgrounds,
half-sibling heterozygous animals and wild-type animals were bred to yield homozy-
gous ΔSRCR5 animals (Fig. 1A) and wild-type half- and full-sibling animals.
As described above, ΔSRCR5 animals express the ΔSRCR5 CD163 mRNA and protein
at levels equivalent to CD163 transcript and protein levels in wild-type siblings.
Furthermore, the native-structure ΔSRCR5 CD163 is recognized on the surface of
pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) by a commercial antibody (15). We further
analyzed whether template-based protein structure analysis by RaptorX predicted the
folding of each subdomain compatible with a functional ΔSRCR5 CD163 protein (26). As
demonstrated in Fig. 1B, all subdomains in both full-length and ΔSRCR5 CD163 are
predicted to adopt the globular structure and retain the pearl-on-a-string configuration
of the native CD163 protein. This supports our findings indicating the proper folding
and expression of the ΔSRCR5 protein.
Previously, we have shown that PAMs and in vitro-differentiated peripheral blood
monocytes (PBMCs) are resistant to infection with both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. Now, we
aimed to assess the resistance of these pigs to PRRSV-1 infection in vivo. We selected
four homozygous ΔSRCR5 F2 animals and four wild-type controls that were cohoused
from weaning (Fig. 1C). Blood samples were taken from all eight pigs, and a full blood
count was conducted by the diagnostics laboratory at the Royal (Dick) School of
Veterinary Sciences, University of Edinburgh. The blood counts of all animals were
within reference values, indicating good general health and the absence of infection or
inflammation. Furthermore, the hemoglobin levels of all animals were within reference
values, indicating normal function of the hemoglobin/haptoglobin-scavenging activity
of CD163 (Table 1).
At 6 weeks of age, a serum sample was collected from all animals prior to movement
to a specific-pathogen-free unit (SPFU). The cohort was cohoused for the duration of
the experiment and allowed to settle for 1 week prior to the initiation of the challenge.
On day 0 of the challenge with PRRSV-1, a second serum sample was taken, and soluble
CD163 (sCD163) serum levels were assessed using a commercially available enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) recognizing soluble porcine CD163. Serum CD163
levels were found to be 433.2 � 69.57 ng/ml in wild-type pigs and 463.5 � 68.99

 ng/ml in ΔSRCR5 pigs (Fig. 2). These results are not significantly different from each
other (P � 0.7512) and are comparable to sCD163 levels in humans (for example,
see reference 27).
�SRCR5 pigs are resistant to PRRSV-1 infection. At 7 to 8 weeks of age, the pigs
were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV-1 subtype 2 strain BOR-57 (28). Eastern Euro-
pean strains are often associated with higher pathogenicity than other PRRSV-1 strains.
For BOR-57, we previously observed mild respiratory symptoms, elevated core temper-
ature, extensive lung pathology, and high viral loads in serum. For this study, the strain
was selected due to the high viremia and shedding levels expected to occur under
study conditions. The experiment was conducted for a period of 14 days following
inoculation of each pig on days 0 and 1 with 5E6 50% tissue culture infective doses
(TCID50), as determined by assessment on PAMs, of the virus isolate used. Rectal
temperature, respiration, nasal discharge, coughing, and demeanor were recorded
every day, and serum samples were collected on day 0 (prior to challenge) and on days
3, 7, 10, and 14 (prior to euthanasia). Weights were recorded on days 0, 7, and 14 (prior
to euthanasia). People assessing the pigs clinically, conducting the challenge, and
analyzing pathology were blind to the genotype status of the animals.
The rectal temperatures were significantly elevated on days 6 to 9 of the challenge
in the wild-type animals, whereas no fever was observed in the ΔSRCR5 animals
(Fig. 3A). The average daily weight gain of the ΔSRCR5 pigs was higher than that of their
wild-type counterparts over the entire challenge period and significantly higher over
days 7 to 14 (P � 0.0465) (Fig. 3B). One wild-type pig showed decreased demeanor on
days 7 to 8; no respiratory symptoms or other abnormalities in behavior were observed
in any of the other animals during the course of the study, as expected for a PRRSV-1
infection at this age. Viral RNA was isolated from serum, virus levels were quantified by
using a DNA fragment template standard, and viral RNA was extracted from virus stocks
of known infectivity. Whereas the wild-type pigs showed high viremia, no viral RNA was
detected in the serum of ΔSRCR5 pigs (Fig. 3C). The presence of antibodies against
PRRSV was assessed using a commercial ELISA able to detect antibodies against all
PRRSV-1 subtypes and PRRSV-2. PRRSV antibodies were detected in wild-type pigs from
day 7 and present at significant levels (according to the manufacturer’s indicated
positive threshold of a sample-to-positive (s/p) ratio of �0.4) on days 10 and 14 (Fig.
3D) but were not detected in samples from the ΔSRCR5 pigs collected during the
course of the experiment.
FIG 2 Serum levels of soluble C163. Serum samples collected 2 weeks prior to and on day 0 of the
challenge were assessed for the level of sCD163 using a commercial ELISA (n � 4 pigs per genotype,
serum collected at 2 different time points, assessed in duplicate in 3 replicates). Minima/maxima and
90th percentiles are displayed. Statistical analysis using an unpaired t test showed no significant
difference.

 During necropsy, lungs were assessed initially, and detailed photographs of the
dorsal and ventral sides were taken. Lungs were scored for the presence of lesions. An
established scoring system, based on the approximate contribution of each lung
section to the complete lung volume, was employed (29). On average, 61% of the lung
surface of control pigs was found to be mottled tan with areas of consolidations,
compared to 0.25% of lung surfaces in ΔSRCR5 pigs (Fig. 3E and G). Samples of the
lungs were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into sections, and stained for
further analysis. To assess general lung histology, samples were stained with hematox-
ylin and eosin. Sections from each pig were assessed for the presence of interstitial
pneumonia on a scale of 0 to 6 (0, normal; 1, mild multifocal; 2, mild diffuse; 3,
moderate multifocal; 4, moderate diffuse; 5, severe multifocal; 6, severe diffuse). Mi-
croscopic lung lesions characterized by multifocal-to-diffuse interstitial pneumonia with
type 2 pneumocytes, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia were observed only in wild-type
animals (average score, 4) and were not present in lung sections of ΔSRCR5 pigs (Fig.
3E and F, top). The presence of PRRSV antigens was assessed by immunohistochemistry
on lung sections and lymph node sections using a mixture of two different antibodies
against the PRRSV N protein as described previously (30). PRRSV antigens were de-
tected in 3 out of 4 lung sections and 1 out of 4 lymph node sections of wild-type
animals, but no PRRSV antigens were detected in sections from ΔSRCR5 pigs (Fig. 3E
and F, bottom).
Overall, no signs of infection were detected in ΔSRCR5 animals despite the high
initial inoculation volume and persistent exposure to infected wild-type animals that
actively shed virus (the wild-type and edited pigs were cohoused throughout the
experiment). This is a clear demonstration that ΔSRCR5 animals are resistant to PRRSV-1
infection, confirming our previous in vitro results (15).
�SRCR5 pigs show no cytokine response to PRRSV-1 infection and generally
normal cytokine levels. CD163 is involved in the cytokine response to infection and
immune stimuli as well as hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) uptake. Hb-Hp stimulation
has been shown to lead to increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 as well as
IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�) downregulation (31, 32). SRCR domains 1
to 4 and 6 to 9 contain binding sites for TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK),
an anti-inflammatory cytokine that negatively regulates CD163 expression (33, 34).
Stimulation with inflammatory mediators can induce the secretion of soluble CD163
and TNF-� in an ADAM17-mediated manner (35). In order to assess these biological
functions in the ΔSRCR5 pigs, we assayed expression levels of key cytokines.
Quantitative antibody arrays were used to assess the expression levels of 20
cytokines in serum collected from pigs on day 0 (prior to challenge) and on days 3,
7, 10, and 14 of challenge. Overall, baseline cytokine levels as determined on day
0, considered a baseline, were similar between ΔSRCR5 and wild-type pigs. How-
ever, the monokine induced by gamma interferon (IFN-�) (MIG; also known as
CXCL9) was found to show consistently higher levels in wild-type pigs until day 10,
after which no significant difference was detected. MIG is a T-cell chemoattractant
to inflammation sites and involved in the repair of tissue damage. In wild-type

1, mild multifocal; 2, mild diffuse; 3, moderate multifocal; 4, moderate diffuse; 5, severe multifocal; 6, severe diffuse). Immunohistochem-
istry staining against PRRSV-N of lung and lymph node sections was scored, ranging from 0 to 3 (0, no signal; 1, low numbers of positive
cells; 2, moderate numbers of positive cells; 3, abundant). Numbers represent averages (n � 4) � SEM. (F) Lung histology and

inflammatory protein 1� [MIP-1�]), involved in the inflammation response via CCR5
signaling and downregulated by IL-10 (37), was found to be higher in wild-type
than in ΔSRCR5 animals (Fig. 4J). As IL-10 levels were found to be comparable in
both genotype groups, IL-10-mediated downregulation is unlikely to be the cause
of low CCL3L1 levels. In wild-type animals, the level of CCL3L1 was elevated in the
serum on days 10 and 14, whereas no significant IL-10 elevation was found to occur
over the period of the challenge (Fig. 4O).
We observed sequential cytokine responses to PRRSV-1 infection in wild-type ani-
mals, with an early increase in the levels of IFN-�, IL-17A, and the IL-1 receptor
antagonist (IL-1ra) (Fig. 4A to C), followed by an increase in the levels of IL-4, IL-6, and
IL-8 at the high point of viremia, from 7 days postinoculation (dpi) (Fig. 4D to F).
Increased levels of MIG and MIP-1� (also known as CCL4) were observed only tran-
siently at 10 dpi (Fig. 4G and H). In the last period of the challenge, with moderate but
reducing levels of viremia, elevations in the levels of CCL3L1, granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-12, and IL-1� were detected (Fig. 4I to M). All of
these cytokine responses were restricted to wild-type animals, with no cytokine re-
sponse being recorded for ΔSRCR5 pigs. IL-10, transforming growth factor �1 (TGF�1),
and IFN-� levels showed no significant difference between wild-type and ΔSRCR5 pigs
at any of the time points but were found to change significantly over time in the
wild-type animals (calculated using two-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] and Sidak’s
multiple-comparison test) (Fig. 4N to P). IL-18 levels decreased significantly over time in
wild-type animals but were not significantly different from those of ΔSRCR5 pigs at

 each time point (Fig. 4Q). The level of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1
(PECAM1) was significantly elevated on day 3 of the challenge and decreased on day
10 compared to the levels in ΔSRCR5 pigs (Fig. 4R). No significant difference in the
levels of IL-1� and IL-13 was found between ΔSRCR5 and wild-type pigs or over time
(Fig. 4S and T).
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that ΔSRCR5 pigs are healthy under standard
husbandry conditions and maintain the biological function of the CD163 protein while
being resistant to PRRSV infection. So far, we have bred three generations of edited
animals with over 10 litters and have not observed any abnormalities in breeding.
ΔSRCR5 pigs were generated, as previously described (15), by using two short guide
RNAs (sgRNAs) flanking exon 7 of CD163 CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we have shown that
heterozygous and homozygous animals can be bred naturally and yield normal-litter-
size offspring. Our previous data showed that primary PAMs and peripheral blood
monocyte (PBMC)-derived macrophages from ΔSRCR5 pigs are fully resistant to
PRRSV-1 subtype 1, 2, and 3 infection as well as to both typical and atypical PRRSV-2
(15). To confirm that these results translated to the in vivo model, we show here that
ΔSRCR5 pigs are completely resistant to infection with a highly virulent PRRSV-1
subtype 2 strain. The edited animals displayed no clinical or pathological signs of
infection, no viral replication was observed, and no cytokine response (indicative of
low-level virus replication) was observed. This confirms that our previous in vitro results
directly translate to the in vivo situation.
The ΔSRCR5 CD163 protein was previously detected on the surface of CD163-
expressing macrophages using a native-confirmation antibody (15). Analysis of the
ΔSRCR5 CD163 amino acid sequence in silico using RaptorX predicts that posttransla-
tional folding will yield a protein that closely mimics the structure of full-length CD163.
The expression of ΔSRCR5 CD163 in animals has several advantages over previously
described PRRSV-resistant CD163 knockout animals generated by the random intro-
duction of a premature stop codon in exon 3 or exon 7 of the CD163 gene (14, 23). Free
hemoglobin, often released following hemolytic events, can cause serious toxicity to a
system (reviewed in reference 38). CD163 is a direct mediator of Hb-Hp complex uptake
into macrophages, which sequesters and degrades this potentially toxic compound
(39). We have previously shown that PBMC-derived macrophages from ΔSRCR5 animals
are still capable of CD163-mediated Hb-Hp uptake, as demonstrated by HO-1 upregu-
lation and the uptake of the fluorescently labeled Hb-Hp complex (HbAF488-Hp) (15). All
ΔSRCR5 animals showed normal hemoglobin levels in their blood, confirming the
proper clearance of Hb-Hp complexes. Yang et al. recently remade pigs with a prema-
ture stop codon in exon 7 of CD163, resulting in a functional CD163 knockout, as
previously reported (40). Surprisingly, that paper claims that PBMC-derived macro-
phages from CD163 knockout animals are able to take up HbAF488-Hp complexes in
vitro (23), a result that directly contradicts the findings by Schaer et al. and Nielsen et
al. (39, 41) in human macrophages, Etzerodt et al. in cells with murine CD163 (42), and
Boretti et al. in canine macrophages (49), all of which highlight the essential require-
ment for CD163 to be present for Hb-Hp uptake in macrophages.
CD163, in both its cell-bound as well as its secreted forms, has been shown to have
multiple other functions in addition to Hb-Hp scavenging (reviewed in reference 18).
One important aspect is the regulatory function of soluble CD163 following inflamma-
tion and ischemic repair, which was found to result in enhanced regeneration activity
in CD163 knockout mice, resulting in abnormal peripheral blood vessel development
and systemic rather than local regeneration after injury (43). Soluble CD163 is also able
to bind Staphylococcus aureus, which promotes the recognition, phagocytosis, and
killing of this important livestock and human pathogen (44). Soluble CD163 is not the
result of alternative splicing but results from proteolytic cleavage, likely by the metal-
loprotease ADAM17 in the juxtamembrane area following SRCR domain 9 of the protein
(45). Proper folding of CD163 and accessibility of this area are essential for the secretion

 of soluble CD163. Here, we show the presence of soluble CD163 in the serum of
ΔSRCR5 pigs at levels comparable to those in wild-type animals.
CD163 knockout mice have been reported to be significantly more susceptible to
intra-abdominal sepsis, which is linked to haptoglobin-HMGB1 signaling and the
cytokine response (46). It was also found that CD163 plays a role in asthmatic
human patients, and CD163 knockout mice were found to have increased airway
eosinophils and mucus cell metaplasia linked to CCL24 chemokine signaling upon
dust mite challenge (47). We analyzed the function of ΔSRCR5 CD163 in signaling
and the cytokine response by measuring the baseline cytokine levels in ΔSRCR5
pigs compared to their wild-type counterparts. We also monitored the cytokine
levels during the course of the in vivo PRRSV challenge to identify any changes that
could result from low-level PRRSV replication. Whereas we found an orchestrated
sequence of inflammation and immune response signaling in the PRRSV-infected
wild-type animals, no cytokine response was observed in the ΔSRCR5 pigs. Of the
panel of 20 cytokines analyzed, the levels of only one cytokine, CCL3L1, were
significantly different between the two groups of animals over the entire course of
the challenge. The inflammation response protein CCL3L1 is involved in the inflam-
mation response and is downregulated by IL-10, but no significant differences in IL-10
levels between the two genotype groups could be found. We have no explanation for
the higher CCL3L1 level in ΔSRCR5 pigs, but the limited time frame and number of
animals in this study warrant further investigation of this cytokine in the future. Another
cytokine, MIG, showed higher levels in wild-type animals up to day 10, but no
significant difference was observed on day 14. It will be interesting to investigate this
observation further, over a longer period and with larger numbers of animals.
The creation of ΔSRCR5 pigs holds tremendous opportunity for the pork industry
worldwide to improve both animal welfare and productivity at the same time. PRRSV
infection has immunomodulatory outcomes and plays an important role in polymicro-
bial disease, such as the porcine respiratory disease complex. As such, PRRSV-resistant
animals could benefit general health and decrease the need for antimicrobial use at the
same time. However, for the implementation of next-generation breeding/genome-
editing techniques in animal production, both consumer acceptance and the legislative
framework need to be in place.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All animal work was approved by The Roslin Institute’s and the University of Edinburgh’s Protocols
and Ethics Committees as well as the ethics group at Moredun Scientific Ltd. The experiments were
carried out under the authority of UK Home Office project licenses PPL60/4518, PPL60/4482, and
PPL70/8827 under the regulations of the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Humane endpoints
were clearly defined.
Cells and viruses. Primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) for the propagation of PRRSV-1
subtype 2 strain BOR-57 (isolated from a sample from a Belarusian pig in 2009 by T. Stadejek) were
harvested from wild-type research animals aged 6 to 9 weeks as previously described (48). Briefly, animals
were euthanized according to a schedule I method. Lungs were removed and transferred on ice to a
sterile environment. Lung lavage with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and gentle massage were
used to recover PAMs. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 400 � g. When necessary, red
blood cells were removed using red cell lysis buffer (10 mM KHCO3, 155 mM NH4Cl, 0.1 mM EDTA [pH
8.0]) for 5 min before washing again with PBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation as described above
and frozen in a solution containing 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (heat inactivated [HI]; GE Healthcare)
and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma). Cells were frozen gradually at 1°
C/min in a �80°
C freezer
before being transferred to �150°
C.
PAM cells were cultivated in a solution containing RPMI 1640, GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (HI;
Gibco), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 �g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) (RPMI�/�).
Breeding and genotyping of animals. Unrelated founder animals generated by zygote injection of
Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs SL26 and SL28, as described previously (15), were bred to each other or to
wild-type animals to generate heterozygous F1 offspring. F1 animals with a double-strand break and
religation without insertions or deletions at the cutting sites of SL26 and SL28 were selected for breeding
the F2 generation. Animals were genotyped as described previously (15); briefly, genomic DNA was
extracted from ear biopsy specimens using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). The region
spanning intron 6 to exon 8 was amplified using primers oSL46 (ACCTTGATGATTGCGCTCTT) and oSL47
(TGTCCCAGTGAGAGTTGCAG), generating a 904-bp product from the intact allele and a 454-bp product
if the complete deletion of exon 7 had occurred. The PCR products were analyzed by separation on a 1%
agarose gel and by Sanger sequencing.

 Animal challenge with BOR-57. Four days prior to transfer of the animals to the specific-pathogen-
free unit (SPFU), blood and serum samples were taken from all animals by jugular venipuncture, and the
blood samples were subjected to whole-blood-count analyses. Sera were screened by using the Idexx
PRRSV X3 ELISA to confirm that none of the animals had previously been exposed to PRRSV. Animals
were acclimated in the SPFU for 1 week prior to challenge.
Infectivity of BOR-57 stocks was assessed using a TCID50 assay on PAMs immediately after production,
prior to challenge, and on both challenge dates after administration. The BOR-57 inoculum was tested for the
absence of mycoplasma and other major viral pathogens. Animals were inoculated intranasally in the left
nostril with 5 ml of 1E6 TCID50/ml BOR-57 in RPMI�/�. Body weights of the animals were measured on day
0 prior to challenge and on day 7 and day 14 prior to euthanasia. Serum samples were collected on day 0 prior
to challenge and on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 prior to euthanasia by jugular venipuncture into Vacutainer tubes.
After clotting, samples were centrifuged at 2,000 � g for 10 min at 4°
C, and samples were aliquoted and
frozen at �80°
C for further analysis. Clinical observations were recorded daily, making note of the rectal
temperature, demeanor, nasal discharge, coughing, and respiration. Feeding, water consumption, and general
health were observed and recorded daily. Humane endpoints were defined prior to challenge. No animal
reached the criteria for premature termination during the challenge.
Necropsy, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. On day 14 of the challenge, animals were
euthanized according to a schedule I method. During necropsy, the lungs were removed and initially
assessed, and detailed photographs were taken from the dorsal and ventral sides for detailed scoring of
macroscopic lung lesions. An established scoring system, based on the approximate contribution of each lung
section to the complete lung volume, was employed as previously described (29). Briefly, each lung lobe is
assigned a number to reflect the approximate volume percentage of the entire lung represented. The affected
area of each lobe is scored relative to the assigned volume percentage. Lung, mediastinal lymph node, and
PAM samples were collected and frozen, and lung and lymph node samples were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin. Formalin-fixed sections were embedded in paraffin and routinely processed for histological
examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Lung sections were scored for the presence and severity
of interstitial pneumonia, ranging from 0 (normal) to 6 (severe diffuse), as previously described (29).
Immunohistochemical analysis of lung and lymph nodes for the detection of PRRSV antigen was performed
as previously described (30), using a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies, SDOW-17 at 1:5,000 and SR-30
at 1:1,500 (both Research|Technology|Innovation [RTI]), as primary antibodies. Sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin.
Assessment of PRRSV and anti-PRRSV antibody levels in serum. Viral RNA was extracted from the sera
collected on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-
qPCR) using the GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega) and analyzed on a LightCycler II 480 instrument
(Roche). Viral RNA extracted from the PAM cell culture supernatant with a known multiplicity of infection
(MOI) and a custom-synthesized DNA fragment (Invitrogen) of a known concentration (GAGAGCGGCCGC

standards. The primers used were BOR57_FWD (GAAATCCCAGCGCCAGCAAC) and BOR57_REV (TTCCCACTGGG
TGAAAGCGA).
Assessment of soluble CD163 serum levels. Serum samples collected a week prior to and on day
0 of the challenge were analyzed for the presence and level of soluble CD163. A sandwich ELISA was
performed using the porcine CD163 ELISA kit (Elabscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and using serial dilutions of serum.
Analysis of serum cytokine levels using cytokine arrays. Serum samples collected on day 0 (prior
to challenge) and on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 of the challenge were analyzed for the levels of 20 different
cytokines. Cytokine array analyses were performed using porcine cytokine antibody array A (catalog
number ab197479) and array B (catalog number ab197480) (both from Abcam) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
