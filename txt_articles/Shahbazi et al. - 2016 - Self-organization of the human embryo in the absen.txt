Abstract
Remodelling of the human embryo at implantation is indispensable for successful pregnancy. Yet 
it has remained mysterious because of the experimental hurdles that beset the study of this 
developmental phase. Here, we establish an in vitro system to culture human embryos through 
implantation stages in the absence of maternal tissues and reveal the key events of early human 
morphogenesis. These include segregation of the pluripotent embryonic and extra-embryonic 
lineages and morphogenetic re-arrangements leading to: generation of a bi-laminar disc, formation 
of a pro-amniotic cavity within the embryonic lineage, appearance of the prospective yolk sac, and 
trophoblast differentiation. Using human embryos and human pluripotent stem cells, we show that 
the reorganisation of the embryonic lineage is mediated by cellular polarisation leading to cavity 
formation. Together, our results indicate that the critical remodelling events at this stage of human 
development are embryo-autonomous highlighting the remarkable and unanticipated self-
organising properties of human embryos.

 Introduction
The development of a human embryo from a fertilized egg begins with a series of cleavage 
divisions and morphogenetic rearrangements that lead to the formation of a free-floating 
blastocyst. This blastocyst comprises three distinct cell lineages: embryonic tissue (epiblast) 
and two extra-embryonic tissues (hypoblast and trophectoderm) that, after implantation into 
the uterus, will give rise to the yolk sac and placenta respectively. This pre-implantation 
period has been extensively studied using methods that pioneered in vitro fertilization 
(IVF)1, 2. However, on the 7th day of development, the human embryo must implant into 
the uterus of the mother to survive, establish the body plan and to generate the germ layers. 
The failure of an embryo to implant is a major cause of early pregnancy loss3 and yet the 
cellular and molecular changes that take place in the human embryo at this stage remain 
unknown. This is because experiments in vivo are not feasible and there has been no system 
to culture human embryos ex vivo.
Monkey embryos have been used as a model for human embryo development4, 5 and the co-
culture of human blastocysts and endometrial cells6 has provided an experimental system to 
model post-implantation morphogenesis. However, the extent to which these systems 
recapitulate post-implantation development of the human embryo remains an open question. 
Moreover, the potential of human blastocysts for self-organisation has never been explored.
Here, to shed light on the early post-implantation phases of human development, we have 
adapted our recently established protocol for mouse embryos7, 8. The culture system we 
have established allows human embryos to undergo the pre- to post-implantation transition 
in vitro, in the absence of any maternal tissues. By comparing human embryos developing in 
vitro and the Carnegie series of in vivo developing human embryos9, we have identified that 
the key hallmarks of human embryogenesis take place in the absence of any maternal 
tissues, uncovering the self-organising properties of human embryos at this stage.
Results
Establishment of a method to culture human embryos through implantation stages in vitro
In order to gain understanding of the developmental events undertaken by the implanting 
human embryo, we reasoned that we needed an in vitro culture system that would 
recapitulate these processes. To this end, we adapted the culture conditions we had 
previously established for mouse embryos at comparable stages7. Supernumerary pre-
implantation human embryos (at either cleavage or blastocysts stage) donated for this project 
were thawed and placed in culture medium to recover, before the zona pellucida was 
removed (Methods). Embryos were scored by morphological criteria and those showing 
abnormalities (fragmented blastomeres or developmentally arrested) were discarded. We 
first plated human blastocysts on optical grade dishes in 21% O2 and in in vitro culture 
medium 1 (IVC1) which was replaced by IVC2 after 48h7 (Fig. 1a, b). Time-lapse 
microscopy revealed that human blastocysts cultured in IVC1 underwent a series of 
contractions and expansions reflecting collapse and subsequent enlargement of the 
blastocyst cavity (Supplementary Video 1), as observed in IVF clinics10. However, by the 
Shahbazi et al.

 end of day 7, the blastocyst cavity completely collapsed and embryos attached to the dish 
(Fig. 1b-d). At this time the attached embryos started to grow and this growth continued 
until day 12-13 (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Video 2). We previously found that either 
human cord serum (HCS) or KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR) in IVC2 permits peri-
implantation mouse development11. Here we show human embryos develop in medium 
supplemented with KSR up to day 13 (Fig. 1b-d). The experiment was stopped at this point 
because the internationally recognized ethical limit for human embryo culture is up to day 
14 or to the first signs of development of the primitive streak12.
The trend in IVF clinics over recent years has been to culture pre-implantation human 
embryos in hypoxic conditions (5% O2), as this favors embryo survival13 and inhibits 
differentiation in embryonic stem cells14, 15. To investigate whether hypoxic conditions 
offer any advantage to human embryos cultured through implantation, we compared 
development of embryos cultured in 21% O2 to ones cultured in 5% O2 in terms of 
preservation of the pluripotent lineage. Initially, day 5-6 pre-implantation blastocysts had a 
group of inside pluripotent cells as indicated by the presence of the transcription factor 
OCT4 (Fig. 2a, b). However, after 4 days in culture, whereas 49% of embryos (N=59) 
cultured in 21% O2 maintained a cluster of epiblast cells showing expression of the 
pluripotency factor OCT4, none of the embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions (N=20) had 
OCT4-expressing cells (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, cells of embryos in hypoxic 
conditions displayed signs of cell death (Fig. 2c). This suggests that preservation of the 
epiblast in vitro beyond day 7 might benefit from higher O2 concentrations possibly because 
of the increase in embryo size, which may decrease the O2 pressure in the core of the 
embryo. Hypoxia clearly has a complex influence on embryonic development and its effects 
need to be better understood in the intrauterine milieu to determine exactly how it affects 
both mouse and human embryogenesis16. As a result of these findings, here we cultured 
human embryos beyond day 7 in 21% O2, which we show permits further development of 
the pluripotent lineage in vitro.
Development of the embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages during human post-
implantation morphogenesis in vitro
To gain temporal understanding of the cellular and developmental events through early post-
implantation development, we fixed and immunostained human embryos at different time 
points of culture. We used KSR to supplement the medium as it permits a more reproducible 
time course of development than HCS7. We have focused on development between days 7 
and 11, since during these 5 days the embryo undergoes a major reorganisation that is 
necessary for subsequent gastrulation9. Shortly after attachment (day 7-8 of development), 
we observed a clear separation between embryonic (OCT4-expressing, epiblast) and extra-
embryonic (GATA6-expressing, hypoblast) cells, the respective progenitors for the fetus and 
yolk sac (Fig. 3a), whereas in the unattached blastocysts, this segregation of epiblast and 
hypoblast progenitors had not yet taken place (Fig. 2b). This contrasts to mouse embryos, 
where the epiblast and the hypoblast-equivalent (the primitive endoderm) segregate already 
before implantation17; but agrees with observations in human embryos18–22. We found that 
at day 7-8, the epiblast was formed by a cluster of about 20 OCT4-expressing cells 
surrounded by approximately 50 GATA6-expressing hypoblast cells (Fig. 3a, and 
Shahbazi et al.

 Supplementary Table 2). By day 8-9, GATA6-expressing hypoblast cells preferentially 
localized to one side of the epiblast, as occurs in human embryos developing in vivo9. This 
spatial organisation was maintained throughout subsequent developmental stages (from day 
9 to day 11) (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). By day 11, 
the number of OCT4-expressing epiblast cells had significantly increased to an average of 
328 cells, whereas the number of GATA6-expressing hypoblast cells increased up to 79 
(Supplementary Table 2).
To analyse development of trophectoderm, the progenitors of the placenta, we followed 
cytokeratin 7 (CK7), which is highly expressed in trophoblast derivatives23. We found that 
the trophectoderm cells surrounding the epiblast and hypoblast (Fig. 3b) presented a 
polarised epithelial phenotype, evident from the localization of the apical determinant PAR6 
(Fig. 3c). From day 8 onwards, we noted the presence of CK7-expressing multinucleated 
cells in the outermost region of the embryo (Fig. 3d). To determine their exact position with 
respect to the epiblast-hypoblast cluster, we performed a 3D reconstruction of cellular 
shapes, based on the computational segmentation of membranes and nuclei (Fig. 3e). This 
revealed two trophectoderm subpopulations: cells in proximity to the epiblast-hypoblast 
bilayer had a single nucleus, whereas those in the periphery of the embryo were 
multinucleated and displayed characteristic lacunae (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Video 5). 
Based on the expression of CK7, their position and their cellular and nuclear shape, these 
two cell populations are likely to correspond to the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast 
respectively, indicating that development post-implantation trophoblast-derivatives can be 
recapitulated in the absence of any maternal tissue. Together these results demonstrate that 
the development of all three lineages progresses as human embryos develop in vitro.
Human epiblast polarisation and pro-amniotic cavity formation
Next, we focused on the development of the epiblast since it undergoes its first major 
reorganisation at implantation. One of the hallmarks of epiblast transformation is the 
acquisition of a polarised phenotype and the formation of a lumen, the prospective pro-
amniotic cavity9, 24, essential for the subsequent development of the body plan. However, 
the cellular mechanisms underlying lumen formation in humans currently remain unknown. 
While some reports in higher primates point towards cell death within the epiblast as the 
major driver of lumen formation25, alternative reports suggest folding of the epiblast26, or a 
change of polarity in epiblast cells4. Importantly, these hypotheses are based on the 
observations of Rhesus monkey embryos by electron microscopy as to date it has not been 
possible to definitively identify cell types and their features in human embryos at 
implantation. We found that at day 7-8 of development, the epiblast was a cluster of cells 
showing no signs of polarisation (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 1b and 2). However, by day 
8-9, a group of OCT4-expressing epiblast cells became radially organised around a small 
central lumen. These cells were apico-basally polarised in 31% of the embryos 
(Supplementary Table 1), as determined by the polarised apical localization of actin and 
aPKC (the principal kinase of the apical Par polarity complex) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary 
Fig. 1b). The formation of a small lumen at the exact site of incipient apical polarisation 
indicates the onset of pro-amniotic cavity formation within the epiblast. Importantly, we did 
not observe any apoptotic cell, cellular debris or any other indication of cell death in the 
Shahbazi et al.

 incipient pro-amniotic cavity (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results indicate that the epiblast 
becomes polarised by day 9 of in vitro development and suggest that apoptosis is not the 
mechanism driving lumenogenesis in human embryos.
Human bi-laminar disc formation
The next expected remodelling event is the formation of the amniotic epithelium and the 
epiblast disc. In contrast to the mouse, in which the amnion is formed at gastrulation, the 
amnion is expected to form in humans shortly after implantation with those epiblast cells 
adjacent to the hypoblast acquiring a columnar shape, and those in contact with 
cytotrophoblast differentiating into squamous and flat amniotic epithelium. At this stage, 
both tissues line the pro-amniotic cavity24. We observed that as development of embryos 
progressed in vitro, the epiblast and the pro-amniotic cavity expanded in size (Fig. 4a and b, 
Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Video 6) indicative of 
embryo growth. At day 10-11 of development, we could detect two morphologically distinct 
groups of OCT4-expressing cells. 3D reconstructions of cellular shapes revealed that OCT4-
expressing cells located near the hypoblast had a columnar morphology whereas opposite-
facing OCT4-expressing cells had a distinct squamous and flat shape (Fig. 4c and 
Supplementary Video 7). Moreover, these flat OCT4-expressing cells were in close 
proximity to cells with a higher nuclear volume (on average 2.5 times bigger than epiblast 
cells), a feature characteristic of trophoblast cells. These observations suggest that the two 
types of OCT4-expressing cells may represent the epiblast disc and the prospective amniotic 
epithelium.
Human prospective yolk sac formation
The next expected event of human embryo development is the reorganisation of hypoblast 
cells to give rise to a second cavity, the primary yolk sac9, 27, which will provide the blood 
supply to the developing fetus. Remarkably, we found that human embryos developing in 
vitro established a second cavity at day 11 of development (Supplementary Video 8). This 
cavity was localized below the epiblast and was surrounded by GATA6-expressing cells, 
highlighting its hypoblast origin (Fig. 4d, e and Supplementary Video 9). Thus, both 
expression of characteristic lineage markers as well as morphological features suggest that 
formation of the prospective yolk sac can be also recapitulated in human embryos 
developing in vitro (Fig. 4f).
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) recapitulate the events of polarisation and 
lumenogenesis
Since the above results revealed that epiblast polarisation and lumen formation are the first 
features of epiblast morphogenesis after implantation, we next investigated the molecular 
pathways that could be responsible for this critical remodelling. Given the ethical restrictions 
and the limited number of human embryos available for functional studies, we turned to 
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as 
alternative models. In order first to determine whether the extracellular matrix (ECM) 
participates in inducing epiblast polarisation and lumen formation, we cultured individual 
hESCs in 3D matrigel. We found that surrounding cells with ECM enabled lumen formation 
by 24h after cell plating, and so it was sufficient to have two sister cells from a single cell 
Shahbazi et al.

 division for this to take place (Fig. 5a), in agreement with other recent observations28. As 
the hESCs continued to divide, they self-organised around a central lumen. These hESCs-
organoids were apico-basally polarised, as demonstrated by the polarised localization of 
aPKC (Fig. 5a), PAR6 (Fig. 5b), centrosomes (Fig. 5c) and the Golgi (Fig. 5d). They 
retained expression of pluripotency markers such as OCT4 (Fig. 5a), mimicking the 
preservation of OCT4 in the epiblast of in vitro cultured human embryos (Fig. 3). To 
confirm these results we next plated hiPSCs into 3D matrigel as we did with hESCs. We 
found that hiPSCs also polarised and began to form lumens between two cells, while 
retaining OCT4 expression (Fig. 6a). Lumens formed on the apical side of polarised cells 
that displayed apical microvilli and a polarised distribution of aPKC, PAR6 and the Golgi 
(Fig. 6a-c). This polarised organisation was preserved in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor 
Y-27632 (Fig. 6d), commonly used to avoid cell death at the time of plating of hPSCs. We 
could also detect lumen-directed secretion of the anti-adhesive protein Podocalyxin 
(PODXL), implicated in lumen formation through charge-repulsion29, 30 (Fig. 6e, f). The 
observation that hPSC-organoids develop lumens between two cells as they become 
polarised, suggests that lumen formation is not a consequence of cell death. To test this 
possibility directly, we treated hiPSCs with a caspase 3 inhibitor to prevent cell death8 and 
found that polarisation and lumen formation were not affected (Fig. 6g, h). Taken together 
our results indicate that lumen formation is a consequence of cellular polarisation and not 
cell death and lead us to suggest that similar molecular pathways may drive lumenogenesis 
in human embryos soon after implantation.
Discussion
Implantation is a milestone in human development as this is the time when the embryo 
undergoes major remodelling, which is absolutely required for correct gastrulation and 
therefore successful body formation and pregnancy outcome. However, to date, the absence 
of an in vitro culture system to visualise and model this critical developmental transition has 
severely limited our understanding of human embryogenesis. Here, we have established a 
system for the in vitro culture of human embryos that offers a unique opportunity to 
understand human development after implantation. This system has allowed us to uncover 
the major morphogenetic events that normally occur after human embryo implantation 
including: (i) epiblast and hypoblast segregation; (ii) epiblast polarisation; (iii) formation of 
the pro-amniotic cavity and the bi-laminar disc; (iv) appearance of the prospective amniotic 
ectoderm; (v) appearance of yolk sac; and (vi) differentiation of the trophoblast into 
cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast (Fig. 4f). Although this system may not be able to 
fully recapitulate all the complex aspects of human embryogenesis in vivo, it has allowed us 
to reveal a remarkable self-organising capacity of human blastocysts that has been 
previously unknown. The next stage in human development corresponds to primitive streak 
formation but for ethical reasons we are obliged to stop our cultures at day 14 of 
development or before the primitive streak formation12. Thus, our studies have focused on 
the key events of pre-gastrulation stages.
Our results indicate that the formation of the pro-amniotic cavity in the human embryo is not 
triggered by apoptosis, as hypothesised25, but by the epiblast’s polarisation, as proposed in 
monkey embryos4. Because of the limitations to perform functional studies in human 
Shahbazi et al.

 embryos, we have used hPSCs as an alternative model to test this hypothesis, and 
demonstrate that the ECM participates in inducing cell polarisation and lumen formation via 
polarised secretion (hollowing) and not programmed cell death (cavitation). This is similar 
to the mechanism of epiblast polarisation we have recently found to operate in mouse 
embryos8. Thus, remarkably, despite the significant differences in embryo morphology 
between these different mammalian species, the initial steps of post-implantation 
embryogenesis are evolutionarily conserved.
One of the most intriguing aspects of human implantation development is the differentiation 
of the epiblast into the epiblast disc and the amniotic epithelium24. Interestingly, we could 
not recapitulate formation of the amniotic epithelium in our 3D hPSC culture possibly 
because this developmental process requires interaction with extra-embryonic tissues present 
in the whole embryo. It will be of interest to determine the signalling pathways required for 
modelling amnion formation in vitro. Indeed, we anticipate that future studies using the in 
vitro culture systems we report here for both human embryos and hPSCs will shed new light 
on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this mysterious and yet critical stage of human 
development, which will be of basic and clinical importance.

Human embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal
Human blastocysts (day 5 and day 6), were thawed using Kitazato Thawing Media Kit 
VT802 (91182; Kitazato Dibimed; Shizuoka, Japan), or Quinn’s Advantage® Thaw Kit 
(ART-8016; LifeGlobal®Group; Guelph, Canada) depending on the protocol used for 
freezing and following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cleavage stage embryos (day 1, day 
2 and day 3) were thawed using Embryo Thawing Pack (10984010; Origio; Malov, 
Denmark) and cultured in drops of human embryo culture medium (LGGG-020; 
LifeGlobal®Group; Guelph, Canada) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) protein supplement 
(LPGS-605; LifeGlobal®Group; Guelph, Canada) under mineral oil (9305; Irvine Scientific; 
California, US) until blastocyst stage. The zona pellucida of each blastocyst-stage embryo 
was removed by brief exposure to Acidic Tyrode’s solution (T1788; Sigma-Aldrich; St. 
Louis, US), embryos were washed in the human embryo culture medium (LGGG-020; 
LifeGlobal®Group; Guelph, Canada), or SAGE 1-Step™ (67010060A; LifeGlobal®Group; 
Guelph, Canada) and transferred to in vitro culture medium (see below).
Human embryo in vitro culture from pre- to post-implantation stage
The in vitro culture procedure is illustrated in Figure 1a. Day 5-6 human blastocysts devoid 
of zona pellucida were cultured on 8-well IbiTreat μ-plates (IB-80826; Ibidi GmbH; 
Martinsried, Germany) with in vitro culture media at 37°C, in 21% O2/5% CO2 or when 
indicated in 5% O2/5% CO2. For the first 48 h the embryos were cultured in in vitro culture 
medium 1 (IVC1; see below)7. On the in vitro culture day 2 (embryo day 7-8 post 
fertilization), 50% of the culture medium was replaced with the in vitro culture medium 2 
(IVC2; see below)7. From in vitro culture day 3 on, IVC2 medium was used and medium 
was refreshed on daily basis. Two alternative IVC2 compositions were used. The detailed 
composition of the media used is outlined below:

Time-lapse phase contrast images were acquired using spinning disc confocal microscopy 
(3i Intelligent Imaging Innovations) and a Zeiss 0.55 NA 20X (EC PlnN) objective; and 
wide field microscopy (3i Intelligent Imaging Innovations) and a Zeiss Plan-Apo Chromat 
0.75 NA 20X objective . The embryos were imaged in humidified 21% O2. Z-range of 120

 SC101A-1 (System Biosciences)31 was kindly provided by Dr. Madeline Lancaster (MRC 
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). These hPSCs were maintained on 
Geltrex (A15696-01; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, US) –coated culture plates in 
complete serum-free defined hPSC culture media, either Essential 8 (E8; A1517001; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, US) or mTeSR™1 (05850; Stem Cell Technologies; 
Vancouver, Canada). Authentication of the cell lines was done based on pluripotent gene 
expression. No cell lines used in this study were found in the database of commonly 
misidentified cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample and they were not 
routinely tested for mycoplasma.
3D culture of hPSCs
hPSCs were suspended as single cells using StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent 
(A11105-1; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, US) and plated following a 3D on top 
protocol as previously described32. Briefly, IbiTreatμ-plates (IB-80826; Ibidi GmbH; 
Martinsried, Germany) were coated with Matrigel Basement Membrane Growth Factor 
Reduced (354230; Corning; New York, US) and 2×104 cells were plated in either E8 or 
mTeSR™1 medium. After 5 min and upon attachment of the cells to the matrigel layer, the 
medium was removed and either fresh E8 or mTeSR™1 medium supplemented with 5% 
Matrigel was added on top. When indicated, 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Y0503; 
Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, US) or 10/20 μM Caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK (1143-5; 
BioVision; Milpitas, US) were added to the medium.
A step-by-step protocol of the 3D culture of hPSCs can be found at Nature Protocol 
Exchange34.
Immunofluorescence of 3D cultured hPSCs
hPSCs embedded in Matrigel were fixed with either 4% PFA at room temperature or ice-
cold methanol at -20°C for 15 min. The samples were permeabilized with 0.3% Tx100 – 0.1 
M glycine in PBS for 20 min. The primary antibodies mouse monoclonal anti-Oct3/4 (as 
above, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-aPKC (as above, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-
PARD6B (as above, 1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 (clone 35/GM130; 610822; BD 
Biosciences; San Jose, US; 1:200), mouse monoclonal anti–γ–tubulin (clone GTU-88; 
T5326; Sigma, St.Louis, US; 1:500) and mouse monoclonal anti-PODXL (clone 222328; 
MAB1658; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, US; 1:200) were diluted in blocking buffer (1% 
Bovine Serum Albumin – A3311; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, US - and 0.1% Tween) and 
incubated at 4°C over night. Samples were washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween and 
incubated with AlexaFluor®-conjugated secondary antibodies (as above).
Imaging
The images of the fixed samples were acquired using inverted SP5 confocal microscope 
(Leica Microsystems, Manheim, Germany) and Leica 1.3 NA 40X oil (HC PL APO), Leica 
1.4 NA 63X oil (HC PL APO) and Leica 1.3 NA 63x glycerol (HCX PL APO) objectives. 
The images were processed using Fiji (http://fiji.sc), Chimera (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/
chimera/) and MovIT visualization software (BioEmergences, http://
bioemergences.iscpif.fr/)33.

 Statistics and reproducibility
The exact number of embryos analysed in the different conditions, as well as the number of 
embryos that displayed a polarized epiblast is indicated in Supplementary Table 1.
No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Given the nature of the work 
(mostly descriptive) no statistical comparisons were done between different embryos. 
Embryos that showed abnormalities (fragmented blastomeres or developmentally arrested) 
were excluded from the analysis. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Figure 1 involved the assessment of 5 embryos collected across 3 independent experiments. 
Out of these 5 embryos 3 showed a correct development.
Figure 2 involved the assessment of 20 embryos cultured in 5% O2 and collected across 3 
independent experiment. All 20 embryos lacked the pluripotent lineage (phenotype shown in 
the image). Embryos were randomly assigned to either 5% O2 or 21% O2.
Figures 3 and 4 involved the assessment of 59 embryos collected across 6 independent 
experiments. Briefly, 29 embryos preserved a cluster of pluripotent cells; and out of these 29 
embryos, 9 had an organized epiblast.
Figures 5 and 6 involved the assessment of a minimum of 10 hPSC organoids per panel and 
condition. These were collected across a minimum of 2 independent experiments per panel.
Qualitative data are presented in the form of a contingency table (Fig. 6h). This data was 
analyzed using a Fisher’s exact test.
Quantitative data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. The normality of the data was analyzed 
with a D’Agostino&Pearson normality test. Data presented in Fig. 5b displayed a normal 
distribution with significantly different variances. This was analyzed using an unpaired two-
tailed Student’s t test with a Welch’s correction.
