Abstract
Following series of synthetic cannabinoid and synthetic cathinone derivatives, the illicit drug
market has begun to see increased incidence of synthetic opioids including fentanyl and its deri-
vatives, and other chemically unrelated opioid agonists including AH-7921 and MT-45. Among
the most frequently encountered compounds in postmortem casework have been furanyl
fentanyl (N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylfuran-2-carboxamide, Fu-F) and U-47700
(trans-3,4-dichloro-N-(2-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl)-N-methylbenzamide). Both drugs have been
reported to be present in the heroin supply and to be gaining popularity among recreational
opioid users, but were initially developed by pharmaceutical companies in the 1970s as candi-
dates for development as potential analgesic therapeutic agents. A method was developed and
validated for the analysis of U-47700, U-50488 and furanyl fentanyl in blood specimens. A total
of 20 postmortem cases, initially believed to be heroin or other opioid-related drug overdoses,
were submitted for quantitative analysis. The analytical range for U-47770 and U-50488 was
1–500 and 1–100 ng/mL for furanyl fentanyl. The limit of detection was 0.5 ng/mL for all com-
pounds. Within the scope of the method, U-47700 was the only confirmed drug in 11 of the
cases, 5 cases were confirmed for both U-47700 and furanyl fentanyl, and 3 cases were con-
firmed only for furanyl fentanyl. The mean and median blood concentrations for U-47700 were
253 ng/mL (±150) and 247 ng/mL, respectively, range 17–490 ng/mL. The mean and median blood
concentrations for furanyl fentanyl were 26 ng/mL (±28) and 12.9 ng/mL, respectively, range
2.5–76 ng/mL. Given the widespread geographical distribution and increase in prevalence in
postmortem casework, toxicology testing should be expanded to include testing for “designer
opioids” in cases with histories consistent with opioid overdose but with no traditional opioids
present or insufficient quantities to account for death.
Introduction
Opiate drugs are commonly abused in the USA and are common
toxicological findings in death investigation cases. The substances
involved have included natural products (e.g., morphine, codeine),
semi-synthetic opioids (e.g., hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromor-
phone and diacetylmorphine) and synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl,
sufentanil). Within the last 2 years, we have observed a sharp
increase in novel non-prescribed opioids in our death investigation
casework. These include many fentanyl analogs such as acetyl fen-
tanyl (1, 2) and butyryl fentanyl (3), and other novel compounds
such as MT-45 (4, 5) and AH-7921 (6, 7). Structures of these and
related compounds are shown in Figure 1. These substances are

 increasingly encountered on their own or in combination with other
opioids in what appear to be routine intravenous drug deaths.
Traditional laboratory approaches to drug screening may fail to
detect them due to little or no cross-reactivity on traditional
immunoassay tests (8), or failure to include fentanyl analogs in the
mass spectral libraries used in drug screening.
Beginning in late 2015, we began to encounter two novel
opioids, furanyl fentanyl and U-47700 (Figure 1) in postmortem
toxicology casework.
U-47700
(trans-3,4-dichloro-N-(2-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl)-
N-methylbenzamide) (Figure 1) is an opioid analgesic drug devel-
oped by the pharmaceutical company Upjohn in the 1970s and is
structurally related to AH-7921, an earlier experimental opioid
agonist developed by the drug company Allen and Hanbury (9).
U-47700 is a selective µ-opioid receptor agonist, and in animal mod-
els has been demonstrated to have ~7.5 times the potency of mor-
phine (10, 11), while fentanyl has a potency of 50–100 times that of
morphine. U-47700 was never studied in humans, but based on ani-
mal models is expected to produce effects similar to those of other
potent opioid agonists, such as analgesia, sedation, euphoria, consti-
pation, itching and respiratory depression. U-47700 is currently
uncontrolled in the USA; however, in March of 2016, its analog
AH-7921 was placed into the USA Federal Schedule as a schedule I
compound (12). Recently Elliott et al. reported a single case in the
UK of a fatality involving U-47700 (13).
U-50488 (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)
cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide), also developed by Upjohn at the
same time (9), is a κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist, with some
reported µ-opioid receptor respiratory antagonist effects (14).
U-50488 has been studied in animal models for its analgesic, diur-
etic, antitussive and anticonvulsant properties (15). KOR agonists
also mediate the dysphoria and hallucinations associated with drugs
such as levorphanol, pentazocine and salvinorin A. U-50488 is cur-
rently uncontrolled and available from online research chemical sup-
ply companies; however, its abuse potential is unknown. KOR
agonists have, however, been investigated as possible pharmacother-
apeutic agents for treatment of addiction, and other KOR agonists
are generally considered to be addictive (16).
Furanyl fentanyl (N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenyl-
furan-2-carboxamide, “Fu-F”) is a fentanyl derivative, which was
synthesized and patented in 1986, and has a furanyl ring in place of
the methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl bridge (Figure 1). Furanyl
fentanyl has an ED-50 in mice of 0.02 mg/kg (17), which is compar-
able to that of fentanyl (0.016 mg/kg) (18). Although never studied
in humans, furanyl fentanyl would be expected to produce effects
similar to those of fentanyl. One death in Sweden has been reported
involving administration of furanyl fentanyl (7).

 Bioscience (Bristol, UK), furanyl fentanyl was purchased from
Finechems.net (Poland) and AH-7921-d3 hydrochloride (internal
standard) was obtained from Cerilliant Corporation (Round Rock,
Texas). The furanyl fentanyl standard was subsequently verified by
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS), gas
chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and liquid chromatog-
raphy quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LCQTOF), ana-
lysis against a certified reference standard from Cayman Chemical,
and was determined a purity of 75%. Calibration curves for quanti-
tative analysis were adjusted accordingly.
Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
grade water and
methanol for liquid chromatography mobile phases were purchased
from Honeywell (Muskegon, MI). Formic acid was purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Standards, calibrators and control preparation
Stock solutions of U-47700, U-50488 and furanyl fentanyl were pre-
pared at a concentration of 1000 ng/µL in methanol and stored at
−20°C in amber glass vials. A stock solution of the internal stand-
ard, AH-7921-d3, was purchased at a concentration of 100 ng/µL.
A working solution of the internal standard was prepared at a con-
centration of 1 ng/µL.
Calibrators were prepared by spiking from dilutions created
from the stock at concentrations of 10, 1 and 0.1 ng/µL into defri-
brinated sheep’s blood. Only a single source of the reference mater-
ial was available at the time of analysis, so controls were spiked by
a different individual from the same stock. Calibrators for U-47700
and U-50488 were prepared at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, 50,
100, 250 and 500 ng/mL. Calibrators for furanyl fentanyl were pre-
pared at concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, 50 and 100 ng/mL. For opti-
mal quantitative analysis of U-47700 and U-50488, calibrators
below the lowest quantitative value in the samples were dropped to
process all samples within a range within two orders of magnitude
or less. Controls were prepared at values of 5, 80 and 400 ng/mL to
allow the curve to be processed using an appropriate range for the
amount of drug present in the samples. For example, if the appropri-
ate range for quantitation was 1–100 ng/mL, the 5
and 80 ng/mL
controls were used as low and high controls; if the appropriate
range was 30–500 ng/mL, the 80 and 400 ng/mL controls were used
as low and high controls. The controls for furanyl fentanyl were pre-
pared at 5 and 80 ng/mL.
Instrumentation
Analysis was performed by LCMSMS using an Agilent 1100 series
high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 6430
triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA).
Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Agilent ZORBAX
Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 µm) with 0.1% formic
acid in water (MPA) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (MPB) using
a gradient elution with initial conditions of 60:40 (MPA:MPB) and
adjusting to 90:10 over 5 min
and returning to 60:40 at 5.5 min
with a total run time of 10 min using 10 µL injection and flow rate
of 0.5 mL/min (Figure 2). The instrument was operated in positive
electrospray, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (Table I).

 Sample preparation
Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction using 130 mg
Clean Screen® DAU extraction columns (UCT, Bristol, PA). After
aliquoting 500 µL of blood, 50 µL of internal standard solution was
added. Samples were pretreated with 2 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 6),
mixed and centrifuged for 5 min. The columns were conditioned
with 3 mL of methanol, followed by 3 mL of deionized water and
1 mL of phosphate buffer. After application of the sample, the col-
umns were washed with 1.5 mL deionized water, 0.5 mL 0.1 M
acetic acid and 1.5 mL methanol and dried under full vacuum for
5 min. Samples were eluted with 2 mL of ethyl acetate/acetonitrile/
ammonium hydroxide (78:20:2). Finally, the eluent was evapo-
rated to dryness at 40°C and reconstitute in 60:40 mobile phase
(MPA:MPB).
Method validation
A fit-for-purpose method validation was performed by assessing the
limit of detection, linear range, bias, accuracy and precision over the
course of 3 days. Stability was assessed at low (5 ng/mL) and high
(80 ng/mL) control values in duplicate at temperatures of 4°C and
−20°C on Days 2, 3 and 10. Criteria for acceptable performance
were as follows: a signal of three times that of the noise at the limit
of detection, mean bias for the controls had to be <20%, within and
between run precision had to have a coefficient of variation of
<15%, accuracy had to be within 20% of the target concentration
of for limit of quantitation and 15% for all control values. Analytes
were determined to be stable if the percent coefficient of variation
for the response ratio was <15%.
Results
Method validation
The limit of detection for all three compounds was 0.5 ng/mL. The
calibration performance over 3 days of replicates resulted in average
correlation coefficients of 0.9995 and 0.9999 for U-47700 and
U-50488, respectively. The calibration range for furanyl fentanyl
was 1–100 ng/mL and the calibration performance for 3 days of
replicates resulted in an average correlation coefficient of 0.9990.
All calibration curves were quadratic using 1/x weighting regression
analysis of the peak area of the analyte to the peak area of the
internal standard. For U-47700, the bias was 5% for the low controls
(80 ng/mL) and 7% for the high controls (400 ng/mL), when pro-
cessed using a calibration range of 30–500 ng/mL. When using the
calibration range of 1–100 ng/mL for U-47700, the bias was 5% for
the low controls (5 ng/mL) and 6% for the high controls (80 ng/mL).
For U-50488, the bias was 5% for the low controls (80 ng/mL)
and 8% for the high controls (400 ng/mL), when processed using a
calibration range of 30–500 ng/mL, respectively. When using the
calibration range of 1–100 ng/mL for U-50488, the bias was 2% for
the low controls (5 ng/mL) and 6% for the high controls (80 ng/mL).
For furanyl fentanyl, the bias was 7% for the low control (5 ng/mL)
and 5% for the high control (80 ng/mL). Within and between run
precision met acceptability criteria for percent coefficient of variation
and accuracy for all three compounds. All compounds were stable at
temperatures of 4°C and −20°C for up to 10 days, with no significant
change in concentration over 10 days.
The method described was used to analyze blood samples from
postmortem casework in which the presence of U-47700 or furanyl
fentanyl was indicated through unconfirmed peaks in GCMS ana-
lysis from casework in other laboratories, data mining of NMS Labs
LCTOF data, or an artifact in an LC–MS/MS method looking for
AH-7921. AH-7921 and U-47700 both have the same molecular
weight, and although U-47700 appeared in the scan window for
AH-7921, it did not meet acceptance criteria for retention time. This
was verified with the U-47700 standard reference material.
Since no deuterated internal standard was available, to account
for possible matrix effects the method was also validated using
standard addition, with a blank and two spikes (10 and 100 ng/mL).
A subset of case samples (n = 16) was also analyzed according to
both calibration methods. No significant difference in performance
of the controls was seen using the direct calibration curves versus
the standard addition approach, and the quantitative values of the
casework samples agreed within ±30%, suggesting no significant
contributions to inaccuracy from matrix effect.
Case samples
Samples from 20 cases involving deaths occurring between October
2015 and March 2016, and suspected of involving furanyl fentanyl
and/or U-47700 were submitted for analysis. Of the 3 compounds in
the scope, 11 cases were positive for U-47700 only, 3 cases were posi-
tive for furanyl fentanyl alone and 5 cases contained both compounds.
One case was presumptively positive for furanyl fentanyl, but failed to
confirm. U-50488 was not detected in any cases. The mean and
median (N = 7) concentrations for furanyl fentanyl in whole blood
were 26 ng/mL (±28) and 12.9 ng/mL, and were all detected within a
range of 2.5–76 ng/mL. For U-47700, the mean and median concen-
trations (N = 16) were 253 ng/mL (±150) and 247 ng/mL within a
range of 17–490 ng/mL. Within the above cases, all subjects were
male with the exception of 1 female, and the mean age was 28.
A summary of the case history and findings can be found in Table II .
Discussion and conclusions
Opiates are among the most frequently encountered drugs in drug-
related deaths (19–23). In addition to the commonly encountered opi-
ates, there has been increasing reports of opioid derivatives and
“designer opioids” in postmortem casework. Between June 2013 and
December 2015, NMS Labs has reported 582 cases of acetyl fentanyl
use, mostly in death investigation casework, with blood concentra-
tions ranging from 0.11 to 3,900 ng/mL, and mean and median con-
centrations of 133 and 12 ng/mL, respectively. Acetyl fentanyl is
reported to be 10–15 times more potent than heroin, and 80 times
more potent than morphine (24). Since June 2015, butyryl fentanyl, a
fentanyl analog with a potency of approximately a quarter that of fen-
tanyl (24, 25), has been detected by our laboratory (NMS Labs) in
20 cases in a 10-month period between July 2015 and May 2016,
with concentrations ranging from 0.33 to 270 ng/mL.

The decedent had a history of
heroin and prescription drug
abuse. The subject was found
unresponsive laying on his right
side, back against the wall of the
bathroom by family. Two days
prior to this incident, he had
been admitted to the hospital
after passing out, due to a
possible overdose but was also
reporting to family he did not
feel well. Drug paraphernalia
was found on the sink and
suspected heroin packets were
located in the decedent’s wallet.
Upon autopsy, severe pulmonary
and cerebral edema was noted.
Individual was prescribed
Vicodin, Xanax and Effexor.

Novel Synthetic Opioids U-47700, U-50488 and Furanyl Fentanyl
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jat/article-abstract/40/9/709/2527448 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Beginning in October 2015, furanyl fentanyl, another analog,
has been detected by us in over 30 cases, often accompanied by the
novel compound U-47700. Aside from one reported death in
Sweden related to furanyl fentanyl with a reported serum concentra-
tion of 148ng/mL (7), there are no published concentrations of these
compounds in the scientific literature. In 19 of the 20 cases we
describe, U-47700, furanyl fentanyl, or a combination of both drugs
was confirmed. One case initially screened positive for furanyl fen-
tanyl, but was present below the laboratory’s reporting limit on con-
firmation. Five cases, all from North Carolina had both drugs
present.
Reported fentanyl concentrations in deaths attributed to fentanyl
following intravenous administration (as opposed to use of fentanyl
patches) are 27.5 (26), 4.8 (27) and 4.0 ng/mL (28). Fentanyl con-
centrations in 5 decedents, who injected fentanyl extracted from
patches, had concentrations between 5 and 27 ng/mL (29). Furanyl
fentanyl, which has an ED-50 that is comparable to fentanyl (17),
had mean and median concentrations of 26 and 12.9 ng/mL in our
case series, respectively, similar to the range of fentanyl concentra-
tions cited above.
The potency of U-47700 is reported to be ~7.5 times that of
morphine in animal studies (10), making it about 10 times less
potent than fentanyl. In the cases reported here, mean and median
concentrations of U-47700 were 253–247 ng/mL respectively (range
17–490ng/mL), ~10-fold higher than the concentrations in the
reported intravenous fentanyl deaths cited above. The single case
reported by Elliott et al. (13) involved the death of a 27-year-old
male, who subsequently tested positive in urine for quetiapine,
amphetamine, amitriptyline, mexedrone and ketamine; quetiapine
(<0.05 mg/L), amphetamine (<0.1 mg/L) and naproxen (<0.8 mg/L).
U-47700 was subsequently measured at a concentration of 1.46 mg/L
(1,460 ng/mL) in postmortem femoral blood.
Novel compounds continue to appear on a monthly basis,
including the appearance in the USA of W-18 and W-15. These
compounds are two of a series of drugs with analgesic properties of
unknown origin synthesized in Canada in 1981 (30). The research-
ers evaluated these compounds using the mouse phenylquinone
writhing tests, which are a measure of a compounds ability to
induce analgesia. In this study, a dose of 3.7 × 10−2 mg/kg morphine
resulted in 50% inhibition of writhing. The doses of W-15 and
W-18 required for the same degree of inhibition were 0.7 × 10−3
and 3.7 × 10−6 mg/kg, respectively.
Deaths with histories consistent with opioid overdose, but nega-
tive toxicology, should be subjected to further testing for these novel
opioid-like compounds. Additionally, positive fentanyl immuno-
assay screens that fail to confirm for traditional opioids should be
investigated for other fentanyl analogs. The geographical distribu-
tion of these findings indicates that “designer opioids” are wide-
spread across the country and their prevalence in postmortem
casework should be continually monitored.
