ABSTRACT
Background: The November 2010 Joint Commission 
Sentinel Event Alert on the prevention of suicides in 
medical/surgical units and the emergency department 
(ED) mandates screening every patient treated as an 
outpatient or admitted to the hospital for suicide risk. 
Our aim was to develop a suicide risk assessment tool to 
(1) predict the expert psychiatrist’s assessment for risk 
of committing suicide within 72 hours in the hospital, 
(2) replicate the recommended intervention by the 
psychiatrist, and (3) demonstrate acceptable levels of 
participant satisfaction.
Methods: The 3 phases of tool development took 
place between October 2012 and February 2014. An 
expert panel developed key questions for a tablet-
based suicide risk questionnaire. We then performed 
a randomized cross-sectional study comparing the 
questionnaire to the interview by a psychiatrist, 
for model derivation. A neural network model was 
constructed using 255 ED participants. Evaluation was 
the agreement between the risk/intervention scores 
using the questionnaire and the risk/intervention 
scores given by psychiatrists to the same patients. 
The model was validated using a new population of 
124 participants from the ED and 50 participants from 
medical/surgical units.
Results: The suicide risk assessment tool performed at a 
remarkably high level. For levels of suicide risk (minimal 
or low, moderate, or high), areas under the curves were 
all above 0.938. For levels of intervention (routine, 
specialized, highly specialized, or secure), areas under 
the curves were all above 0.914. Participants reported 
that they liked the tool, and it took less than a minute 
to use.
Conclusions: An expert-based neural network model 
predicted psychiatrists’ assessments of risk of suicide in 
the hospital within 72 hours. It replicated psychiatrist-
recommended interventions to mitigate risk in EDs and 
medical/surgical units.

T
he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ranks 
suicide among the top 4 leading causes of death in individuals 
10 to 54 years of age.1 Inpatient suicides consistently rank among the 
top 5 serious events reported to the Joint Commission with 24.5% 
occurring in nonpsychiatric units.2,3 The Joint Commission—formerly 
known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations—is a private nongovernmental, independent, not-for-
profit agency that sets quality and safety standards and accredits and 
certifies more than 20,500 health care organizations and programs 
in the United States. Accreditation and certification by the Joint 
Commission are recognized as symbols of quality. Their 2004–2014 
Sentinel Event database includes 856 reports of inpatient suicides and 
69 reports of self-inflicted injuries.3
The Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert issued in November 
2010 focused on the prevention of suicides in medical/surgical units 
and the emergency department (ED). The Event Alert mandates 
screening every patient treated as an outpatient, in the ED, or 
admitted to the hospital. It also requires placing at-risk patients in 
safer environments. Thus, the Event Alert has serious implications 
for resource utilization.
These Joint Commission requirements increase the burden on 
hospitals to demonstrate absolute safety around an outcome that is 
difficult to predict.4 Suicide has serious and long-lasting consequences 
for families, staff, and hospitals.5 It is in the interest of hospitals to 
fulfill the Joint Commission mandate in a way that is evidence-
based and efficient in terms of resource allocation. Current methods 
of suicide risk screening are not uniformly and systematically 
implemented.6 Quantification of the resources required for their 
implementation remains elusive. Moreover, current screenings are 
generally designed for research conditions without full consideration 
for their “real world” applicability.7
The bridge between validated measures of suicide-related 
behaviors and real-time clinical decision-making has not yet been 
established.8–11 It is customary for psychiatry professionals to 
document a number of modifiable, nonmodifiable, and protective 
risk factors in order to deliver acute and chronic suicide risk estimates. 
The American Psychiatric Association guidelines intend to provide a 
guide to clinicians in treating adult patients with suicidal behaviors. 
However, these guidelines are not meant to serve as a standard of 
care for such treatment.12,13 The gold standard to evaluate suicide 
risk remains the psychiatrist’s evaluation.
The goal of this research was to develop a clinically relevant, self-
administered, easy-to-use, cost-effective, suicide risk assessment 
tool that modeled the critical thinking process of board-certified 
psychiatrists. We hypothesized that the tool would (1) predict the 
expert psychiatrist’s assessment of acute suicide risk in the hospital, 
(2) replicate the recommended intervention of the expert psychiatrist, 
and (3) demonstrate acceptable levels of participant satisfaction. We

note that the goal of this study was not to predict the actual 
risk of death by suicide but to replicate common practices.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
We designed a randomized cross-sectional study to 
evaluate the performance of a tablet-based suicide risk 
assessment tool in the ED setting. We hypothesized that 
the tool would predict the assessment of experienced 
psychiatrists in evaluating a patient’s risk of committing 
suicide in the next 72 hours in the hospital. The study was 
conducted at our university-affiliated academic medical 
center. It consisted of 3 phases and was approved by the 
University Human Research Subjects Institutional Review 
Board.
Phase 1: Model Development
Phase 1, conducted October 9–10, 2012, consisted of 
literature review and model development using nominal 
group technique in collaboration with an expert panel of 
recognized suicidologists during a 2-day workshop.14,15 
Nominal group technique is a facilitated, structured 
group process to build consensus. It typically consists of 
3 phases: problem identification, solution generation, and 
prioritizing of next steps.16 Nominal group technique can 
be used effectively in groups with up to 12 members. The 
method gives equal weight to the opinions of all members 
of the group and arrives at consensus through a series of 
converging, anonymous, “round-robin” voting sessions. 
Nominal group technique is designed to allow the full and 
equal participation of members. It is also relatively efficient 
as the high structure of the process allows the exploration 
of complex issues in a short period of time. Moreover, it 
generates the production of a large number of ideas and a 
sense of closure that are often not achieved in less-structured 
group methods.
Experts were chosen based on their seminal contributions 
to the literature and policy making on suicide risk assessment. 
The experts were Jan Fawcett, MD; David A. Jobes, PhD, 
ABPP; Peter D. Mills, PhD, MS; Morton M. Silverman, MD; 
and Douglas G. Jacobs, MD (who was a contributor but was 
unable to attend the meeting). The experts discussed current 
evidence for suicide screening,17 reviewed best practices 
in suicide risk mitigation, and reviewed simulated cases. 
Using the nominal group technique for the group consensus 
process, they selected relevant variables and assigned ranges 
and weights. A preliminary questionnaire was created and 
translated into a computerized version. Separate models 
of risk and intervention were created. Acute suicide risk 
(referred to hereafter as “Risk”) was defined as the patient’s 
risk of committing suicide within 72 hours in the hospital 
and was classified as minimal, low, moderate, or high. 
Interventions (referred to hereafter as “Intervention”) were 
classified as routine, specialized, highly specialized, or 
secured (Table 1).
Phase 2: Discovery Sample
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) size module, 
Stata 12.1, StataCorp, was used to estimate power with 
varying assumptions.18 We aimed to achieve 90% positive 
predictive validity and 90% negative predictive validity 
under assumptions of α = .05, a base rate of suicidal ideation 
of 5% or less,1 a null hypothesis of positive predictive validity 
and negative predictive validity = 0.5, and 1 – β greater than 
0.8 would be achieved with a sample size of 200.
A total of 801 participants were screened by research 
associates in the ED during a 6-week period. Individuals 
18 years or older and able to provide informed consent 
were approached for participation, regardless of their chief 
complaint, which was assessed by the ED triage nurse (Figure 
1). The screening of participants took place sequentially 
between Monday and Friday from 2 pm–10 pm. Exclusion 
criteria included individuals who were unable to consent 
for participation in the study, intoxicated or unconscious, 
in severe pain or agitation, escorted by law-enforcement 
officers, or held in the hospital on an involuntary basis. 
Two hundred fifty-five participants were included in the 
analysis.
Research associates obtained informed consent from 
eligible participants. Participants were randomly assigned 
to the order in which they completed the suicide risk 
questionnaire and the face-to-face evaluation by 1 of 4 
psychiatrists who were faculty of the University of Vermont 
College of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry, were 
board certified in general psychiatry, had at least 5 years of 
experience in post–residency training, and worked as either 
inpatient or consultation-liaison psychiatrists. Three of 4 
psychiatrists were independent and blinded to all aspects of 
the study. One was involved in the risk assessment process 
and the model development and was aware of the final model 
that was developed. Participants completed satisfaction 
surveys about their experience with the electronic tool and 
with the psychiatrist’s interview (Table 1).
Psychiatrists were randomly assigned to data collection 
shifts. The questions and conduct of the interviews were 
not scripted with a template, as the study team was trying 
to capture the gestalt of the psychiatrist’s assessment in 
the course of a regular clinical encounter. Psychiatrists 
independently entered their risk rating and recommendation 
for intervention on an electronic interface and recorded a 
summary of their critical thinking for each evaluation. The 
Clinical Points
 
■ Assessment of the acute risk of committing suicide in 
general hospitals, as mandated by the Joint Commission, 
requires an effective tool that is not resource intensive.
 
■ This tablet-based suicide risk screening tool replicates a 
psychiatrist’s risk/intervention assessment well, in less 
time than face-to-face assessment, and with adequate 
patient satisfaction. 
 
■ The tool can be valuable in clinical settings where a 
shortage of psychiatry staff to assess patient risk exists.

Suicide Risk Rating 
High
Moderate
Low
Minimal
Even considering mitigating 
protective factors, the 
acute risk of suicide—in the 
following 72 hours—is high 
(suicide is possible and likely).
The combination of risk factors and 
mitigating protective factors yield 
a risk of suicide in the following 72 
hours that is only moderate (suicide 
possible, but unlikely).
Although there may be suicide risk factors 
present, the combination of risk factors 
and mitigating protective factors yields 
a relatively low risk of suicide in the 
following 72 hours (suicide very unlikely).
The risk of suicide in the

time required to complete the suicide risk questionnaire and 
the interview was collected.
Data and screening records were completed using 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt 
University), secure web-based software designed to support 
digital data collection for research purposes. Phase 2 was 
conducted from May 1, 2013, to June 24, 2013.
Statistical analysis. All analyses were conducted 
using IBM SPSS version 21. Specific measures to test the 
hypotheses included calculating the agreement between the 
risk scores using the instrument and the risk scores given by 
psychiatrists to the same patients. Instrument characteristics 
were first examined, including descriptive statistics and 
discriminative power using discriminant analysis. To account 
for potential nonlinear interactions among variables, neural 
network models were used to separately predict the level of 
risk assigned by the psychiatrist and the appropriate level of 
intervention.
Neural network modeling is a technique capable of 
modeling complex functions that are nonlinear and 
interactive. The prediction analysis was conducted using 
a multilayer perceptron network in the neural network 
analysis routine in SPSS. Neural networks are used in 
situations in which a relationship between the independent 
variables and predicted variables exists, is strongly 
suspected, but appears very complex, and is not obvious. The 
input/output relationship is “learned” through “training.” 
Training data, including inputs and corresponding outputs,

are assembled to create the weight attribution. The neural 
network then learns to infer the relationship between the 
two. This initial training is performed only on a subset of 
the data so that the predictive capacity of the model can be 
tested on a new set. Given that training may result in the 
overfitting of the model to the training data, once the initial 
algorithm is created, it is then “tuned” on a small sample 
of participants in order to adjust weights and thresholds to 
minimize the generalizability of the model obtained during 
training. When the neural network has learned to model the 
“unknown” function that relates the input variables to the 
output variables, it is considered properly trained. At this 
point, it can then be used to make predictions for which the 
output is not known. The final step is one of validation. The 
algorithm is tested with an additional set of data that was not 
used for training.
Questionnaire responses were entered as variables along 
with demographic information and chief complaint. Linear 
age and quadratic age were entered as covariates. Analysis 
was run separately using psychiatrist risk assessment as 
the outcome variable and psychiatrist intervention as the 
outcome variable. For each of these outcomes, a training set 
of 70% of the data was used to train the neural network that 
was then tuned with 10% of the sample and finally tested 
on a holdout set of 20% of the sample. Hidden layer units 
were allowed to be determined automatically in the analysis 
program, and batch training was used. Classification outputs 
for risk and intervention for each of the sets of data were 
compared.

Outputs of the ROC curve for each level of risk and 
intervention were created taking into account the entire 
sample of Phase 2. Differences in participant satisfaction 
were analyzed using the Bowker test of internal symmetry.16 
We report on the ROC curve from each of these data sets 
(training, tuning, and holdout) whereby, for each level of Risk 
or Intervention, we examined the sensitivity and specificity 
of the model to predict the expert response. Within SPSS, a 
classification table is created for each categorical dependent 
variable that gives the number of cases correctly classified 
for that category. A ROC curve is then created for each 
categorical dependent variable. Because both the Risk and 
the Intervention variables have more than 2 categories, each 
category was treated as a positive state versus the aggregate 
of all other categories (the equivalent of dummy coding). It 
is from these curves (1 for each level of Risk or Intervention) 
that the areas under the curves were constructed.
Phase 3: Replication and Extension Samples
To determine if the model fit in Phase 2 was replicable 
and could be extended to non-ED patients, we studied a new 
set of 124 participants from the ED and 50 participants from 
medical/surgical units using the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and methods of data collection outlined in Phase 2 (Figures 
2 and 3).

RESULTS
Phase 2
Basic descriptive statistics for the variables 
entering the analysis and demographics are 
presented in Table 2. Individuals presenting 
with a psychiatric chief complaint had lower 
wish to live (median 2.00 vs 3.00, Mann-
Whitney U = 920.5, n1 = 235, n2 = 20, P < .001) 
and higher wish to die (median 2.50 vs 1.00, 
Mann-Whitney U = 1,130.5, n1 = 235, n2 = 20, 
P < .001) than those without a psychiatric chief 
complaint, respectively. The result range for 
“wish to live” and “wish to die” is 0–2 on the 
questionnaire (Table 1). However, the data 
were recoded to be on a scale of 1–3. Measure 
of time taken for interview and questionnaire 
completion was available in 244 cases (95.7%). 
Mean time for the interview from beginning 
to end was 7:57 minutes (SD = 6:46 minutes). 
Mean time for questionnaire completion was 
significantly lower at 0:56 minutes (SD = 0:41 
minutes; t243 = 16.34, P < .001). Segmenting the 
sample by chief complaint shows that, for those 
patients with a psychiatric chief complaint, both 
the expert evaluation (15:42 minutes, SD = 7:39 
minutes) and the questionnaire assessment 
(1:14 minutes, SD = 0:39 minutes) took longer. 
The difference in expert evaluation time was 
statistically significant (t251 = −5.64, P < .001) 
while the difference for the questionnaire 
was not (t244 = −1.78, P = .076). While several 
measures were not normally distributed, 
parametric and nonparametric tests showed 
the same significance; only the parametric tests 
are presented here.
On the basis of a 3-point level of satisfaction, 
91% of participants found the electronic 
questionnaire easy to complete, whereas 95% 
found the interview easy to complete (Kendall 
tau-b = 0.30, P = .024). Twelve percent of 
participants found the length of the electronic 
questionnaire too short, whereas only 6% found 
the interview too short (Kendall tau b = 0.28, 
P = .015). More participants thought that the 
interview was likely to help improve their care 
(53%) compared to the questionnaire (44% of 
participants) (Kendall tau b = 0.62, P < .001).
In terms of the ability of the tool to 
accurately predict psychiatrist opinion, initial 
discriminant analysis demonstrated that the 
group centroids for the minimal and low risk 
groups were nearly identical. Consequently, 
these 2 groups were collapsed into a “low or 
minimal” risk group (Risk). Similar analyses for 
the intervention groups did not demonstrate 
clear overlap among categories in the group 
psychiatrist met all the qualifications mentioned under Phase 2 but was 
less than 5 years out of residency training.
Statistical analysis. The neural network models, built off Phase 2 data, 
were fitted to the new population of ED participants (direct replication) 
and to medical/surgical unit participants (external validity). By using 
the weights determined separately for levels of risk and intervention, 
prediction accuracy of the models for the Phase 3 samples was determined.

centroids, thus intervention (Intervention) was entered as 
a 4-category output variable in the neural network analysis. 
We estimated the clinical implications of collapsing the 
(Risk) categories to be reasonable. In reality, the clinical 
attention afforded to an acute risk estimate of “very unlikely” 
versus “minimal” is not different in the context of a busy 
clinical setting.
For Risk, the neural network optimization converged on 
1 hidden layer with 6 nodes. The classification accuracy for 
the training set was 94% and 94% for the testing set. For the 
holdout set, which was not involved in creating the model, 
classification accuracy was 94%. ROC curves were created 
and areas under the curves were constructed. Areas under 
the curves represent the percent agreement between the 
risk assessment resulting from the interview and the risk 
assessment resulting from the questionnaire. Areas under 
the curves for the Risk levels were 0.97 for the minimal or 
low group, 0.94 for the moderate group, and 0.98 for the high 
group (Table 3).
For Intervention, classification accuracy numbers were 
similar. The optimization converged on a 2 hidden layer 
network, with 7 nodes in the first layer and 6 in the second. 
The classification accuracy for the training set was 95% and 
91% for the testing set. For the holdout set, classification 
accuracy was 88% (Table 3). If the psychiatrists assessed 
Intervention as “routine,” there were no cases for which the 
model predicted anything except “routine.” There was only 1 
classification error by the model for which the psychiatrist’s 
recommendation was “secured.” In this single case, the model 
classified the intervention as “highly specialized.” Areas 
under the curves for the 4 levels were 0.95 for “routine,” 0.92 
for “specialized,” 0.91 for “highly specialized,” and 0.99 for 
“secure,” based on all sets.
Phase 3: Replication (3A) and Extension (3B) Samples
Basic descriptive statistics for the variables entering 
the models and demographics are presented in Table 2. 
The medical/surgical sample (3B) was, on average, 17.4 
years older than the ED sample (3A), t172 = −5.98, P < .001. 
Average scores on wish to live and wish to die were 
similar to the discovery sample. Measure of time for both 
interview and questionnaire completion was available for 
171 subjects (98.2%), and measure of time for questionnaire 
completion was available for all subjects (100%). Mean 
time for the interview from beginning to end was 5:52 
minutes (SD = 4:25 minutes) in the ED and 6:24 minutes 
(SD = 4:00 minutes) in medical/surgical units. Mean time 
for questionnaire completion was significantly lower at 
1:15 minutes (SD = 0:58 minutes) in the ED as compared to 
1:56 minutes (SD = 2:23 minutes) in medical/surgical units 
(t172 = −2.68, P = .008).
Placing variables from Phase 3 into the neural network 
models designed in Phase 2 and providing no further training 
of the network demonstrated high levels of continued 
accuracy. Overall, on the new Phase 3 samples, the model 
predicted the psychiatrists’ assessment of Risk 91% of the 
time (Table 3) and predicted the psychiatrists’ assessment 
of Intervention 89% of the time (Table 3). In a single case, 
the model predicted “routine” intervention when the 
psychiatrist recommended “secured” intervention. While 
this error may seem significant, this participant was not 
labeled “high” Risk by either the model or the psychiatrist. 
On further investigation, this participant was not at acute 
risk for suicide but was at risk for falls and confusion 
secondary to a history of stroke, a documented history 
of cognitive slowing, and a remote history of depression, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcotic 
abuse, resulting in the psychiatrist’s recommendation for a 
“secured” intervention.
For the medical/surgical sample (3B), randomization for 
the 2 sequence groups was 1:1. However, due to random 
variation in accessing the participants in the midst of their 
medical care and coordinating it with expert availability, 
more participants ended up receiving the tablet-based 
assignment first.
DISCUSSION
Our data indicate that a neural network model can 
accurately predict a psychiatrist’s assessment of risk of suicide 
in the hospital within 72 hours and that it can accurately 
replicate psychiatrist-recommended interventions to 
mitigate the risk of suicide in ED and medical/surgical units. 
We have shown that this self-administered, electronically 
based assessment tool is clinically accurate and convenient. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to 
use neural network models to replicate the current gold 
standard—evaluation of acute suicide risk and level of 
intervention made by a psychiatrist.
The strength of this research study is the use of both 
statistical replication within the data analysis (using a holdout 
set) and physical replication (using new data collection) 
in testing the predictive models. In the neural networks, 
both the Intervention and the Risk models predicted the 
holdout sets with high levels of accuracy. This high level of 
accuracy was also seen in the replication and extension sets,

System for Suicide Risk Assessment in Hospitals
This tool has the potential to serve as a clinical 
decision support system, contributing to 
increase quality and reliability in hospitals, 
allowing them to efficiently meet safety and 
regulatory requirements and to optimize 
the use of limited resources by eliminating 
the need for excessive screening of low risk 
groups. Instead, hospitals may focus these 
resources on settings where risk is high.19
More participants perceived that the 
interview would improve their care than 
would the questionnaire. In most situations, 
however, the risk and intervention from 
both the interview and the tool were the 
same, and participant satisfaction for both 
was high. Given that the time needed for 
the electronic questionnaire is a fraction 
of the time for face-to-face assessment, 
future research will determine whether this 
small trade-off in perceived satisfaction 
is worth the cost of the human resources 
and increased wait times for patients. 
Patient education around the usefulness of 
electronic expert systems may be helpful in 
changing perception.
Limitations
Psychiatrists were instructed to conduct 
a face-to-face interview aiming at estimating 
the subject’s risk to commit suicide in the 
hospital in the next 72 hours. This interview 
is an extremely specific task, narrow in 
scope, which is usually embedded in a 
lengthier and broader interview when 
performing a psychiatric evaluation and 
suicide risk assessment.
In this study, “measure of time” is defined 
as the time between the examiner’s entrance 
and exit from the patient’s room. It does 
not include the time spent by the examiner 
to review the subject’s personal health 
information in the electronic medical record 
prior to and after the interview. It also does 
not include the time spent by the examiner to 
think through the data before determining 
the risk and intervention recommendations. 
Despite the significant time difference spent 
with the subjects with a “psychiatric chief 
complaint,” the “measure of time” results 
may lead to the perception by the reader 
of a suboptimal risk assessment, given that 
the time is admittedly faster than a regular 
comprehensive evaluation. The chosen 
definition of “measure of time” was used to 
avoid an overestimation of the length of the 
face-to-face interview, given that the aim of 
a psychiatric interview is not solely a suicide

suggesting high external validity and potential to export the results to new 
samples and alternative settings. Further, the design of the study balanced 
experimental design (randomizing initial assessment modality and assigned 
psychiatrist) in an actual clinical setting.
This suicide risk assessment tool is of potential use in settings with high 
volume and rapid turnover where timely psychiatric expertise is unavailable.

risk assessment. Instructing the psychiatrists to perform a 
full psychiatric evaluation would have, on the other end, 
biased the time comparisons between interview and tool by 
bringing less specificity to the task studied.
Although 4 of the 5 psychiatrists doing the face-to-face 
evaluations were independent and blinded to all aspects 
of the study, 1 was involved in the risk assessment process 
and in the model development and was aware of the final 
model developed. Although the role of this 1 psychiatrist 
may have potentially biased the results toward greater 
agreement between the model and the expert psychiatrists’ 
risk assessments, there was in fact no difference in results 
across all 5 psychiatrists.
All psychiatrists doing the face-to-face evaluations are 
academic psychiatrists with extensive clinical experience in 
the assessment of high risk, complex psychiatric patients at 
a tertiary health care facility. As a group, the examiners have 
more exposure to the full range of suicide risk spectrum than 
a “typical” psychiatrist. Moreover, they practice psychiatry 
in the state of Vermont, which is a very liberal state when it 
comes to putting more weight on the respect for civil liberties 
and the right to self-determination over the treatment of 
psychiatric illness against objection. This represents potential 
biases away from high-risk determinations. To address the 
small sample size of patients predicted as moderate to high 
risk, future work should include replication of the results 
at another institution, in a different state, or in patient 
populations with a psychiatric chief complaint in the ED, or 
who are admitted to inpatient psychiatry units.
In a single case, the model predicted “routine” intervention 
when the psychiatrist recommended “secured” intervention. 
While this error may seem significant, this participant was 
not labeled “high” risk by either the model or the psychiatrist. 
Although this participant was not at acute risk for suicide per 
se, this intervention misclassification represents a limitation.
The tool presented here is meant to “merely” model 
the psychiatrist’s risk assessments and intervention 
recommendations for a very specific patient population and 
clinical setting. The tool does not assist in the prediction 
of suicide. It is a triage and risk mitigation tool. Since 
inpatient suicides are rare, it is difficult to use inpatient 
suicide or inpatient suicide attempts as a dependent variable 
in evaluating the power of the implementation of this tool 
without conducting a large scale, longitudinal, multicenter 
study. These large data collection enterprises require a 
standardized, easy-to-deliver assessment method that can 
be broadly disseminated. We think that the tool we have 
developed will aid to further research into suicide prevention.
In addition, the cost-benefit ratio of universal screening 
and patient perception of quality of care with these models 
will need to be established, along with the satisfaction of 
health care providers with this type of tool. 
Finally, the participation rate and the exclusion criteria 
may also limit generalization of the findings.
