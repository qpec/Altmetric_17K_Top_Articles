Hippocampal projections to the anterior olfactory
nucleus differentially convey spatiotemporal
information during episodic odour memory

The hippocampus is essential for representing spatiotemporal context and establishing its
association with the sensory details of daily life to form episodic memories. The olfactory
cortex in particular shares exclusive anatomical connections with the hippocampus as a result
of their common evolutionary history. Here we selectively inhibit hippocampal projections to
the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) during behavioural tests of contextually cued odour
recall. We find that spatial odour memory and temporal odour memory are independently
impaired following inhibition of distinct, topographically organized hippocampal-AON path-
ways. Our results not only reveal a longstanding unknown function for the AON but offer new
mechanistic insights regarding the representation of odours in episodic memory.

hat happened, when, and where? The ability to readily
integrate elements of a unique event into a single
representation is a fundamental property of episodic
memory1. Encoding, storing, and retrieving contextually unique
episodes is crucial for making sense of the present, forming
predictions about the immediate future, and selecting behavioural
responses relevant to survival2–4.
Lesion and recording studies in humans and non-human
animals have highlighted a central role of the hippocampus
(HPC) in mediating episodic memory5,6. The spatial and tem-
poral context of an event are first encoded within the HPC as the
collective activity of place and time cells7,8. Contextual informa-
tion later serves as a potent retrieval cue, bringing about the rich
multisensory details of the original experience9,10. An emerging
theory holds that the HPC conducts this retrieval process by
reinstating
patterns
of
cortical
activity
observed
during
learning11,12. Yet, it is not known how hippocampal transmission
of contextual information can reproduce the sensory aspects of
episodic memory.
Olfaction is considered the most evolutionarily ancient sense as
evidenced by the direct anatomical connections between the
olfactory cortex and the limbic system13,14. In particular, hippo-
campal projections to the olfactory cortex offer a unique
experimental model for understanding the context-driven recol-
lection of previously encountered sensory stimuli. Recently, we
revealed a dense and topographically organized projection from
the dorsoventral extent of the HPC to the anterior olfactory
nucleus (AON)15 (Fig. 1a). The AON receives unidirectional,
monosynaptic inputs from the CA1, in contrast to other primary
sensory areas that receive hippocampal inputs indirectly via
adjacent medial temporal lobe structures16.
The AON is an ideal site of convergence for olfactory and
contextual information given its anatomical position as the initial
recipient of input from the olfactory bulb and the largest source

 of feedback projections within the olfactory cortex17,18. Con-
sistently, it has been shown that hippocampal inputs to the
AON can alter olfactory perception and odour-guided beha-
viours19. However, the functional role of the HPC-AON pathway
remains unexplored. Here we combine chemogenetic and opto-
genetic
approaches
to
demonstrate
that
information
regarding the spatial and temporal context of odour memory is
delivered by topographically organized hippocampal inputs to the
AON.
Results
AON-projecting HPC cells support context-dependent odour
memory recall. Using c-Fos as a proxy for neural activity we
measured the AON’s response to a novel odour and context,
separately or in combination. We found that the AON exhibits a
widespread increase in c-Fos-positive neurons following exposure
to a novel context-odour pairing, yet neither stimulus alone was
sufficient to evoke an increase in the number of labelled cells
compared with homecage controls (Supplementary Fig. 1). These
results are in line with previous work on the response properties
of AON principal cells and suggest that the AON has a role in
context-odour coincidence detection20,21.
To manipulate activity in the HPC-AON pathway, we infused the
retrogradely propagating canine adenovirus encoding Cre recombi-
nase (CAV2-Cre) into the AON, followed by HPC infusions of an
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying a Cre-dependent
inhibitory hM4D-mCherry (AAV8-hSyn-FLEX-hM4D-mCherry)
or mCherry alone (AAV8-hSyn-FLEX-mCherry) (Fig. 1b). This
allowed us to selectively inhibit AON-projecting HPC cells upon the
administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), thereby limiting the
AON’s response to a context-odour pairing (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Cre-mediated viral mCherry expression was observed throughout
the ventral two thirds of the hippocampal CA1 (Fig. 1c). Three
weeks after viral infusion, mice underwent behavioural tests to
evaluate memory for the associations between odours and the
spatiotemporal context in which they occurred. Assessing the
retrieval of episodic odour information was made possible by
capitalizing on the innate tendency of mice to preferentially
investigate novel stimuli22. Thus, mice can behaviourally express
correct memory by investigating odours paired with a novel position
in
space,
or
temporal
sequence,
more
so
than
familiar
configurations.
We first tested the ability to remember where specific odours
occurred in context. In two encoding phases of a spatial odour
memory test, mice were presented with two different odours
(odour 1 and 2) placed on opposite ends of a distinct context (A)
for 5 min. Mice were then placed in a separate context (B) where
the same odours were positioned in reversed locations. Each
exposure was followed by a 15 min retention delay, the second of
which was preceded by a CNO injection. In the subsequent
retrieval phase, animals were reintroduced to context A wherein
two copies of either odour 1 or 2 were presented on both sides. In
this paradigm, correct memory expression would drive mice to
investigate the odour found at the novel location (NL) within the
context, as seen in control mice expressing mCherry alone
(Fig. 1d). In contrast, CNO-treated hM4D mice investigated both,
otherwise identical odours for a similar proportion of time. These
results cannot be explained by differences in total investigation
time or distance travelled as both groups displayed similar
measures in each (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Next, we examined memory for when specific odours were
encountered. Mice were presented with a sequence of odours in
three successive encoding phases followed by a retrieval phase
where two of the previously encountered odours were reintro-
duced.
Control
mice
preferentially
investigated
the
odour
encountered earlier in the sequence, yet CNO-treated hM4D
mice investigated both odours to a largely equal extent (Fig. 1e).
Importantly, the spatial context was consistent throughout the
test where novelty was only conferred by temporal distance (TD)
between the two odours. Lastly, to examine whether hippocampal
function can be extended to memory for odours regardless of
context, we conducted a novel odour recognition test where
animals were presented with a familiar and previously unexplored
odour. Both groups preferentially investigated the novel odour
despite CNO administration (Fig. 1f). Discrimination ratios
obtained for both groups under all conditions were compared to
zero (chance performance) and the results detailed in Supple-
mentary Table 1. Together, our findings indicate that AON-
projecting HPC cells mediate the retrieval of odour memory only
when it is tied to spatiotemporal context.
Spatiotemporal information is transmitted along distinct
HPC-AON pathways. The ring of cells which constitute the AON
is typically partitioned into four subregions based on their relative
cardinal positions: pars medialis (mAON), pars dorsalis (dAON),
pars lateralis (lAON), and pars ventralis (vAON)17,23. Previous
studies
have
found
that
each
subregion
displays
distinct
cytoarchitectural,
morphological,
neurochemical,
and
con-
nectivity patterns, thereby providing critical foundations for
defining AON subregional boundaries23 (for a review, see ref. 17).
Our
recent
neuroanatomical
study
revealed
a
previously
unknown topographic gradient in HPC-AON projections such
that the ventral-most part of the HPC innervates most heavily the
medial aspect of the AON and, progressively, more dorsal parts of
the HPC innervate increasingly more lateral positions at the
AON15. As a result, our definition of the mAON encompasses the
pars medialis, yet includes a portion of what is traditionally
accepted to be pars dorsalis.
Such topographically organized HPC terminals at the AON
may transmit distinct contextual cues depending on where they
arise within the HPC. To explore this idea, we employed
archaerhodopsin (ArchT) to optogenetically inhibit intermediate
HPC (iHPC) or ventral HPC (vHPC) terminals that innervate
separate AON subregions. One group of mice received bilateral
infusions of AAV-CaMKIIa-ArchT-eYFP into the iHPC with
optic fibre implantations in the lateral AON (lAON) for
inhibiting the iHPC-lAON pathway and another group under-
went viral infusions into the vHPC with optic fibre implantations
in the medial AON (mAON) for inhibiting the vHPC-mAON
pathway (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 4). A control group given
counterbalanced infusions and implantations were prepared
using AAV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) only.
The efficacy of optogenetic inhibition was confirmed in a separate
group of mice unilaterally infused with ArchT, where hippo-
campal
terminal
inhibition
during
a
novel
context-odour
encounter selectively reduced the density of c-Fos positive cells
within the AON ipsilateral to the manipulation, leaving the
contralateral side unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Animals were tested in the same behavioural paradigms used
for hM4D experiments, except inhibition was mediated by light
(532 nm, 12 mW) limited to the retrieval phase. Illumination of
the iHPC-lAON and vHPC-mAON pathways disrupted memory
for where odours were encountered, as both groups were unable
to discriminate odours tied to a spatial location within a specific
context (Fig. 2b). In contrast, only vHPC-mAON, but not iHPC-
lAON pathway inhibition impaired memory for when odours
occurred in a temporal sequence (Fig. 2c). Importantly, all groups
showed similar levels of novelty preference in a context-
independent novel odour recognition test (Fig. 2d). A comparison
of the discrimination ratios with chance performance can be

 found as Supplementary Table 2. The identified impairments in
episodic odour memory retrieval suggest that representations of
space and time are differentially distributed across the AON
whereby both iHPC and vHPC inputs deliver spatial information,
but information regarding the temporal context is supported only
by vHPC inputs.
The behavioural tests employed thus far were designed to
separately examine the spatial and temporal elements of episodic
odour memory. However, given the unified nature of recollected
episodes, it is necessary to probe memory-based behavioural
judgements while the animal concurrently weighs both para-
meters. To investigate further the spatiotemporal contributions of
hippocampal inputs to the AON, we adopted an episodic memory
test where recollection of an odour, its spatial location, and
temporal
occurrence
(what–when–where)
were
tested
simultaneously24,25. The test involved two encoding phases and
one retrieval phase, each separated by a 1 h delay (Fig. 3a). Light-
mediated inhibition was limited to the retrieval phase. During the
encoding phases, mice sampled two distinct odours placed at
adjacent corners of an open field, and then sampled a new set of
odours positioned on the opposite side of the arena. In the
retrieval phase, all four odours were presented, each possessing a
unique spatiotemporal configuration. Encountered odours were
either in a novel location and appeared earlier in temporal
distance (NL/TD), familiar in location/temporally distant (FL/
TD), novel in location/temporally recent (NL/TR), or familiar in
location/temporally recent (FL/TR).
The control group displayed a pattern of investigation
indicative of their novelty preference such that the greatest
proportion of time was spent investigating the odour encountered
in the most novel spatiotemporal combination (NL/TD), while
investigation time for the remaining odours decreased in a
familiarity-dependent manner: (NL/TD) > (FL/TD) ≃ (NL/TR) >
(FL/TR) (Fig. 3a, b). The iHPC-lAON group spent the greatest
proportion (~50%) of time investigating the odour with the FL/
TD configuration, while the NL/TR odour was investigated least.
Strikingly, inhibition of the vHPC-mAON pathway produced an
inverse pattern of investigation to the control group. The odour
presented in the FL/TR configuration was investigated most,
while the NL/TD odour was investigated least. A separate analysis
delineating the spatial and temporal contributions to memory
revealed that iHPC-lAON pathway inhibition impaired spatial
but not temporal odour associations, while the vHPC-mAON
pathway inhibition impaired both components to a similar extent
(Fig. 3c). Collectively, these findings confirm the differential roles
of the iHPC-lAON and vHPC-mAON pathways in conveying
spatiotemporal information during olfactory episodic memory
retrieval.
HPC-AON input is necessary for context-driven odour recall.
The ability to explicitly recollect sensory information is a hall-
mark of episodic memory, particularly when lacking a physical
sensory cue26. Context alone can drive the activity of primary

 olfactory regions to form internal representations of odours
although the underlying neural circuit is unknown9,10. To this
end, we examined whether the HPC-AON pathway could support
this function. Mice were allowed to explore a rich spatial context
in the presence of a pure odour emitted from a cotton swab tip for
30 min per day over nine consecutive days. On day 10, mice were
reintroduced to the context in the absence of the applied odour.
The mismatch between the odour-paired context and the lack of
an emitted scent drives an increase in the investigation time for
the cotton swab (Supplementary Movie 1). Indeed, control mice
exhibited a marked increase in investigation of the cotton swab
upon failure to find the expected odour (Fig. 4a; Supplementary
Fig. 6). In contrast, hM4D- and ArchT-mediated inhibition of the
HPC-AON pathway abolished this behaviour. All groups showed
no increase in investigation time when similarly trained but tested
in a novel context (Fig. 4b). In a separate group of mice trained
on an odour-context association and later exposed to the context
alone, immunostaining for c-Fos revealed a context-driven acti-
vation of the AON, complimentary to similar activity patterns
observed in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7)9,10. Together, these results indicate that HPC-AON
communication is necessary for mediating the context-driven
recollection of odours.
Discussion
The HPC has an essential role in organizing memory for sensory
events within the framework of spatiotemporal context, a func-
tion integral to episodic memory27. Memory for sensory experi-
ences are theorized to be distributed in modality-specific
neocortical networks12,26,28–31. The scattered components of the
engram are bound by the HPC which acts as an integrative hub,
providing storage for context-based associative indices32. Later
during retrieval, the HPC uses the associative index to reinstate
patterns of cortical activity that were observed during encoding11.
One functional magnetic resonance imaging study in particular
provided initial evidence for the reactivation of the olfactory
cortex during odour memory recollection9. In their study, human
subjects were instructed to learn associations between an odour
and a context after which they were examined for the effect of the
context alone on neural activity during memory retrieval. Both
the primary olfactory cortex and the anterior HPC were activated,
adding further support for the role of the HPC in binding sensory
memory traces preserved in modality-specific neural regions.
We show that HPC inputs to the AON are necessary for
mediating the context-driven recollection of odours (Fig. 4). In
our context-driven odour recollection paradigm, the context
alone has been shown to produce an internal representation of
the associated odour and drive behavioural investigation of the
empty odour source10. Whether the activity of place and time
cells within the HPC are themselves sufficient to trigger retrieval
of the odour memory remains unknown. It is possible that the
increased firing rate of ‘misplace’ or mismatch cells within the
HPC facilitates the reinstatement of odour representations within
the AON, particularly when mice failed to find the odour paired
with the context. These hippocampal principal neurons were first
characterized in O’Keefe’s33 landmark paper where place units
were also described. Misplace cells fire maximally after encoun-
tering novel stimuli or at the mismatch between experience
and expectation (i.e., when rats sniffed in a particular location
where a novel stimulus was found or when rats failed to find
the expected stimulus which had been there)33. Thus, the firing of
misplace cells may serve as a signal to instigate odour recollection

 when the odour is no longer present. Inhibition of the HPC-AON
pathway may have interrupted the downstream propagation of
this signal thereby preventing the exploratory behaviour usually
displayed.
To our knowledge, this work provides the first functional
demonstration that hippocampal inputs to the olfactory cortex
are necessary for episodic odour memory. Specifically, we show
that inhibition of hippocampal inputs to the AON results in a loss
of odour memory when it is tied to spatiotemporal context
(Fig. 1). Next, we demonstrated that hippocampal representations
of space and time are differentially distributed across the AON
such that both iHPC and vHPC inputs transmit spatial infor-
mation, whereas information regarding the temporal context is
supported by vHPC inputs (Figs. 2, 3). The segregation of hip-
pocampal inputs by their spatiotemporal contribution is con-
sistent with recording studies which suggest that each dimension
of
an
event
is
coded
independently
within
overlapping
hippocampal neural populations34. Although the dorsal HPC is
commonly thought to dominate spatial processing, particularly
when contrasted to the ventral aspect, this dichotomic perspective
is being revised in light of growing evidence for a hippocampal
model characterized by multiple levels of functional long-axis
gradients and discrete domains35. This alternative perspective
better accommodates recent findings demonstrating iHPC and
vHPC involvement in transmitting spatial information and is in
accordance with our results24,36. Lastly, in addition to the AON,
HPC axon fibres were found, albeit to a much lesser extent,
within the tenia tecta, an extension of the HPC into the olfactory
peduncle. Little is known about the function of this structure,
thus the contribution of HPC inputs to the tenia tecta remains
undetermined.
Ultimately, our findings support a model of episodic odour
memory whereby information regarding odour quality and spa-
tiotemporal context merge at the level of the AON and, as a

 natural consequence of Hebbian synaptic plasticity, produce
cellular populations that represent previously encountered odours
within the context in which they occurred (Fig. 5). Such a system
maintains the fidelity of the original memory and allows access
for retrieval of the full trace via partial cues from either olfactory
or contextual inputs.
Our findings reveal a previously unreported function for the
AON, a structure that has long remained elusive in its role in
olfactory information processing. The AON, in its position
immediately posterior to the olfactory bulb and anterior to the
piriform cortex, maintains connections at nearly every synaptic
step in the olfactory pathway17. Its central arrangement and
extensive command over activity within the olfactory cortex
makes the structure a conceivable repository of episodic odour
engrams. Adding further weight to this possibility is the AON’s
well-documented involvement in the early pathophysiology of
Alzheimer’s disease, a debilitating disorder of episodic mem-
ory37–41. In fact, the AON has repeatedly been identified as the
earliest site of neurodegeneration, including cell loss and the
formation of neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and other
associated
histological
markers42–45.
Complementing
these
observations is a vast body of work which reports olfactory
dysfunction, specifically olfactory memory loss and hyposmia, as
symptoms of the onset of Alzheimer’s disease46–49. Consistently,
our previous findings have also implicated the AON in the top-
down modulation of olfactory sensitivity19. Studies of olfactory
deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease have now prompted
measurements of olfactory ability to be used as clinical bio-
markers in the early diagnosis of the disease50–52.
Our findings implicate the AON as the storehouse of episodic
odour engrams and suggest that its accelerated degeneration may
underlie the olfactory dysfunction observed in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Thus, the HPC-AON pathway provides a novel circuit
model for studying fundamental aspects of human episodic
memory and the odour memory deficits commonly found in
neurodegenerative conditions.
Methods
Animals. Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used in all
behavioural tests. All mice were 8–10 weeks old at the time of surgery and
12–14 weeks old at the time behavioural testing began. Before surgery, mice were
group-housed in a temperature-controlled room on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad
libitum access to food and water. Following surgery, mice were individually housed.
A total of 60 mice were distributed into two groups for hM4D experiments
(hM4D-mCherry: n = 10, mCherry control: n = 8) and three groups for ArchT
experiments (GFP-control: n = 14, iHPC-lAON: n = 12, vHPC-mAON: n = 16).
An additional 29 animals were used for c-Fos immunoreactivity experiments. All
procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care and the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee.
Surgical procedures. CAV2-Cre viral vector was purchased from the Plateforme
de Vectorologie de Montpellier, AAV2/8-hSyn-FLEX-hM4D-mCherry (hM4D)
and AAV2/8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (mCherry control) from the vector core at
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and AAV2/5-hSyn-hChR2-mCherry
(ChR2-mCherry), AAV2/5-hSyn-hChR2-eYFP (ChR2-YFP), AAV2/5-CaMKIIa-
ArchT-eYFP (ArchT), and AAV2/8-CB7-CI-EGFP-RBG (GFP-control) from the
University of Pennsylvania Vector Core. Stereotaxic surgery was conducted on
mice anaesthetized with isoflurane and administered ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) for pain
management. For chemogenetic experiments, CAV2-Cre viral vector was bilat-
erally infused into the mAON (10° angle toward midline; anterior/posterior
(AP): + 2.90, medial/lateral (ML): ± 1.10, dorsal/ventral (DV): − 3.42) and lAON
(no angle; AP: + 3.20, ML: ± 1.10, DV: − 3.90) at a volume of 0.1–0.2 μL and
hM4D into the iHPC (no angle; AP: − 2.70, ML: ± 2.20, DV: − 2.00) and vHPC
(10° angle away from midline; AP: − 2.92, ML: ± 2.15, DV: − 4.90) at a volume of
0.3–0.4 μL. The position immediate to the rhinal fissure was used as a landmark
to delineate intermediate and ventral parts. For optogenetic experiments, ArchT
or GFP-control was bilaterally infused into the iHPC or vHPC in a volume of
0.3–0.4 μL, and optical fibres (200 μm core diameter, 0.39 NA; Thorlabs, Newton,
NJ, USA) threaded through 1.25 mm-wide zirconia ferrules (Thorlabs) were
bilaterally implanted into the lAON or mAON, respectively. For anterograde tra-
cing experiments, ChR2-mCherry was infused into the vHPC and ChR2-YFP was
infused into the contralateral iHPC. All infusions were made by means of pressure
ejection at a rate of 0.1 μL/min through a cannula connected by Tygon tubing to a
10 μL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV). A 15 min interval was allotted after
each infusion to limit the viral spread.
Drugs. CNO obtained from the NIH was dissolved in a solution of 10% dimethyl
sulphoxide and 0.9% saline. A dose of 5 mg/kg of CNO was used in all behavioural
experiments using hM4D-mCherry- and mCherry-only-expressing animals. All
CNO treatments were separated by a minimum of 72 h.
Apparatus for optogenetic experiments. Inhibition of hippocampal terminals at
the AON was conducted by illumination with green light (532 nm, 12 mW) gen-
erated by a diode-pumped solid state laser (Laserglow, Toronto, ON, Canada). The
laser was connected to a 1 × 2 optical commutator (Doric Lenses, Quebec, QC,
Canada), which divided the light path into two arena patch cables attached to the
implanted optical fibres.
Experimental design. Unless otherwise noted, all tests took place in a 50 cm ×
25 cm × 20 cm plexiglass open-topped cage. Odours were presented mixed with
woodchip bedding in 3 cm wide, 1 cm high aluminium cups. Multiple identical
odour cups were used such that an animal never investigated the same cup twice.
The odours used included nutmeg, vanillin, coriander, banana, garlic, cinnamon,
thyme, almond, onion, curry, ginger, savoury, cumin, dill, jasmine, coffee, oregano,
sage, and rosemary. The odours presented and the order of their presentation
between animals was pseudorandomized. For habituation, mice were given 15 min
of exploration time for each unique context prior to initial exposure. Each exposure
was 5 min in length and inter-trial intervals were 15 min. All tests were video-
recorded at 60 fps using a NIKON D5200 equipped with a 30 mm lens. An addi-
tional overhead video was recorded using a Logitech webcam. All videos were
subsequently scored blind to the treatment groups. Exploration was strictly defined
as head up sniffing, directed towards and within 1 cm of the odour source. This
definition excludes the use of the odour cup for sitting or as support during rearing.
Olfactory spatial memory test: In this paradigm adapted from Eacott and
Norman53, mice were tested for memory of odour location in context. The test
chamber was altered to produce two distinct contexts. Zebra-patterned paper was

 used to line the walls of context A, whereas context B had transparent walls
surrounded by red plastic cups and bedding on the floor. Each animal underwent
two encoding phases and one retrieval phase. During the first encoding phase, mice
explored context A where two highly distinct odours were placed at opposite ends
of the chamber (odour 1 on the left and odour 2 on the right). Next, mice were
removed from the chamber and placed in a holding cage. The mice were then
returned to the chamber, except it was now configured as context B and contained
both odours in opposite positions (odour 2 on the left and odour 1 on the right).
The animals were allowed to explore both odours in their new positions before
being placed back into the holding cage. For the retrieval phase, the chamber was
reconfigured as context A but now two copies of one odour were presented on both
sides of the chamber. Time spent investigating the odour cups was measured. The
novel configuration consists of the familiar odour in a novel position within the
original context. The initial context and left/right position of the odour cups were
pseudorandomized.
Olfactory temporal order memory test: This paradigm is based on similar tests
used previously to measure memory for the temporal order of objects54,55. Mice
were tested in a transparent chamber with spatial cues kept constant throughout
the session. Each animal underwent three encoding phases and one retrieval phase.
In the first exposure, mice were placed in the chamber with two copies of one
odour presented on opposite sides of the arena. After exploring both copies, the
animal was removed from the chamber and placed in a holding cage. This process
was repeated two more times using different odours each time. During the retrieval
phase the animal was returned to the chamber, but this time earlier and recently
explored odours were presented on opposite sides. In this case, the odour explored
earlier is more novel given its TD compared with the recently explored odour. The
left–right positions of the first and last odours during the test were
pseudorandomized. Time spent investigating both odours was measured.
Novel odour recognition test: This test was given 72 h after examining
performance on temporal order memory and followed a similar paradigm. The
animals underwent three encoding phases where two copies of a unique odour
were presented in each. On the retrieval phase, mice were presented with the
initially encountered odour and a previously unexplored odour on opposite sides of
the chamber. Time spent investigating each odour was measured.
Olfactory episodic memory test: Animals were first habituated to the apparatus,
which consisted of a 50 cm × 50 cm × 20 cm transparent plexiglass open field for a
30 min period. The animals were then exposed to two encoding phases and one
retrieval phase each separated by a 1 h delay. In the first encoding phase, animals
were given 10 min to explore two different odours located at two adjacent corners
of the arena. In the second encoding phase, the animals were given an additional
10 min to explore another set of unique odours presented on the opposite adjacent
corners. During the retrieval phase, all four odours were presented with the spatial
position of one odour from each set exchanged. This presentation results in each
odour possessing a unique spatiotemporal configuration—NL/TD, FL/TD, NL/TR,
and FL/TR. Successful memory for an integrated (what, when, and where) memory
results in a pattern of exploration such that the odour with the NL/TD
configuration is preferentially investigated the most while the FL/TR configuration
is investigated the least. Time spent investigating all four odours was measured for
5 min in the retrieval phase. Overhead videos were analysed using the ANY-maze
software to produce average heat maps of each treatment group’s position within
the arena.
Context-driven odour recall test: In this paradigm adapted from Mandairon
et al.10, mice were trained to associate a visually distinct context with an odour and
subsequently tested for recollection of the odour when exposed to the context
alone. The testing apparatus consists of a 50 cm × 30 cm × 20 cm plexiglas cage
with colourful visual patterns pasted on the outside of the walls. A wooden
applicator with a cotton swab tip was positioned 3 cm from the floor and 5 cm
from one end of the chamber. Before introducing mice into the chamber, 100 μL of
a pure odourant was applied to the cotton tip. Each mouse was randomly assigned
a monomolecular odourant to be trained with among limonene, isoamyl acetate,
nonane, and 1-pentanol. Mice were allowed to explore the context and the odorized
cotton swab for 30 min per day for 9 consecutive days. On Day 10, mice were once
again placed into the cage, however no odour was added to the cotton swab.
Investigation time of the cotton swab was measured on day 9 and 10 for the first 5
min of their exposure to the context. Upon failure to detect the expected odour,
mice behaviourally expressed memory by spending a greater amount of time
investigating the cotton swab compared to their investigation time when the odour
was present on Day 9.
General histology. After behavioural testing, mice were transcardially perfused
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffer. Brain tissue was extracted and postfixed overnight at 4 °C. The
brains were then cryoprotected using a 30% sucrose in PBS solution. Coronal
40 µm-thick sections were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Germany). The sections
were slide-mounted, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 135 for
5 min and subsequently coverslipped with Aquamount (Polysciences, Inc., War-
rington, PA). Wide-field fluorescent images were captured using a 4 × objective
lens on a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Japan). Confocal images were captured
using a × 20 and × 60 objective through a Quorum spinning disk confocal
microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems,
Incorporated, San Jose, CA) was used to adjust the brightness and contrast of
representative sections.
Immunohistochemistry. For c-Fos immunostaining, free-floating tissue sections
were obtained and washed with PBS with Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and then blocked
with normal donkey serum (5 in 0.1% PBS-T) for 1 h. The sections were subse-
quently incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Fos antibody (1:1000 in PBS-T;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California) for 72 h on a nutating mixer at 4 °C. After
incubation with the primary antibody the sections were submerged in Alexa Flour
594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 in PBS-T; Invitro-
gen) for 90 min at room temperature.
Validation of chemo- and optogenetic inhibition. To characterize the AON’s
response patterns we exposed groups of three animals to one of four conditions:
homecage only, homecage with an applied odour (100 µL of limonene on a cotton
ball), novel context only, or novel context with an applied odour. With the
exception of the homecage control group, all animals were put into each condition
for a total duration of 30 min.
To validate our chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations, we prepared two
groups of four animals—one group received unilateral CAV2-Cre infusions into
the mAON and Cre-responsive hM4D in the vHPC; another received unilateral
ArchT infusions into the vHPC and optic fibre implantations in the mAON. Each
group was exposed to a novel odour-context pairing for 10 min (reduced from
30 min to prevent prolonged illumination in the optogenetic experiment). hM4D-
expressing mice were injected with CNO 15 min prior to exposure whereas ArchT-
expressing mice were illuminated with green light throughout the exposure. In the
subsequent tissue analysis, the mean density of c-Fos-labelled neurons were
compared between each hemisphere.
To examine context-driven AON activity, two groups of three mice were
trained on a context-odour association by placing the animals in a context (50 ×
30 × 20 cm plexiglas closed-lid cage with colourful visual patterns pasted on the
outer walls) with an applied odour for 1 h over three consecutive days. The
mice were killed the following day after exposure to the context-odour pair
or the context alone for 30 min. c-Fos density was measured and compared
to a third group trained and exposed to a context in the absence of an applied
odour.
All animals were transcardially perfused 75 min after initial exposure to their
testing condition.
Cell counting. Every other section from bregma + 3.20 to + 2.34 was collected and
immunostained for c-Fos. Sections were mounted and scanned using a 4 × objec-
tive lens on a fluorescent microscope. c-Fos-positive cell counting was performed
using the cellSens software (Olympus). The area of each AON section was outlined
to form a region of interest (ROI) and the number of mCherry-expressing cells
were counted. Calibration parameters were established using randomly chosen
prominent neurons and adjusted by raising the threshold of detection to a con-
servative level, excluding the majority of false positives. Once set, the calibration
was kept constant. The density of neurons was calculated by dividing the
number of labelled cells in the ROI by the area for each AON section. The mean
density was determined for each animal and for all animals in each experimental
group.
Calculations and statistical analysis. The discrimination ratios were derived
from the exploration time of odour-context pairings during the retrieval phase of
each test. For all tests based on the spontaneous novelty preference paradigm, the
discrimination ratio was calculated as the difference between the times spent
exploring the novel and familiar odour-context configurations divided by the total
amount of time investigating both odours. Here, a value of zero indicates that the
animal investigated both odours to an equal extent. Positive values up to one
indicate preference for the novel combination, whereas a negative value indicates
greater investigation of the familiar odour-context pair. The discrimination ratios
of each group obtained using the behavioural paradigms detailed in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2 were compared to zero (chance performance) using a (two-tailed) one-
sample t-test.
For the episodic memory test, percent investigation time was calculated by
dividing the amount of time spent investigating an individual odour-spatiotemporal
configuration by the time investigating all odours and multiplied by 100%:
NL=TD
NL=TD þ NL=TR

Þ þ FL=TD þ FL=TR

For analysing spatial memory, the difference in the amount of time spent
investigating odours with novel and familiar positions was divided by the total
investigation time:

Performance in novelty preference-based paradigms was compared using t-test
in hM4D experiments and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with testing
group as the factor in optogenetic experiments. Percent investigation time data
collected in the episodic memory test was analysed using a two-way ANOVA with
testing group and odour-spatiotemporal configuration as factors. A two-way
ANOVA was used to analyse data in the contextually cued odour recall test for
hM4D and optogenetic experiments, respectively, using experimental day and
treatment group as factors. Where appropriate, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test
was used for post hoc comparisons. Significance was defined as *P < 0.05, **P <
0.005, ***P < 0.0005, ****P < 0.0001.
