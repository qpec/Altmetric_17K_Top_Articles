Estimates of global, regional, and national incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality of HIV, 1980–2015: the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 HIV Collaborators*
Summary
Background Timely assessment of the burden of HIV
/AIDS is essential for policy setting and programme evaluation. 
In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and 
trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries 
and territories from 1980 to 2015. 
Methods For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data 
from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on 
initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 
cell-count category), on and off
  antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. 
Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and 
prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally 
consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection 
Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV
/AIDS 
(UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions 
from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration 
data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely 
from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for 
garbage coding and HIV misclassifi
 cation.
Findings Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3·3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
3·1–3·4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2·6 million per year (range 2·5–2·8 million) 
since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV
/AIDS has been 
steadily increasing and reached 38·8 million (95% UI 37·6–40·4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV
/AIDS 
mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1·8 million deaths (95% UI 1·7–1·9 million) in 2005, to 
1·2 million deaths (1·1–1·3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV
/AIDS 
across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV
/AIDS mortality and in annual new 
infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections.
Interpretation Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of 
global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, 
development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries 
have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 
and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued eff
 orts from governments and 
international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.

Introduction
HIV
/AIDS is a leading cause of death and disease 
burden, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.1–5 Introduction of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 greatly reduced 
HIV-related mortality.6,7 Creation of the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV
/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 1996; the 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 
2002; and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, galvanised the mobilisation of 
resources to combat the HIV epidemic. In the past 15 years, 
the global com 
munity has provided US$109·8 billion of 
development assistance to curb the HIV
/AIDS epidemic.8 
As a result, HIV mortality has declined overall in 
low-income and middle-income countries since 2004.1
The success of ART and prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission programmes led to ambitious calls to

eliminate HIV as a public health threat. However, 
maintenance and scale-up of suffi
  ciently funded AIDS 
eff
 orts will be crucial to realise the goal of ending the 
AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030.9 
Achievement of these goals, including the UNAIDS 90-
90-90 targets, which aim to have 90% of people living 
with HIV know their status, 90% of those detected 
treated with ART, and 90% of those receiving treatment 
achieving viral load suppression,10 requires a coordinated 
global scale-up of prevention pro 
grammes, pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP), and detection and treatment 
programmes.11 However, development assistance for 
health targeted for HIV has stagnated since 2010, and, in 
many low-income countries, national resources for 
health are scarce and expected to grow slowly.12,13
The ambitious goals set forth by the global community, 
and the few resources available to combat HIV/AIDS, 
emphasise the importance of under 
standing and 
monitoring the trends of each country’s HIV/AIDS 
epidemic. Measurement of disease burden according to 
geographic units enables comparison with other major 
conditions, showing where the epidemic remains a 
dominant cause of health loss and where the burden is 
still rising in spite of national and global eff
 orts. Such 
measurement also enables direct comparison of 
diff
 erent HIV/AIDS metrics, emphasising the specifi
 c 
needs of each geographic region and allowing for a 
more targeted response to the epidemic. 
UNAIDS produces a biannual assessment of 
incidence of infections, prevalence of people living with 
HIV, and deaths from HIV/AIDS;14 the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) provides an alternative assessment 
of these rates. UNAIDS and GBD estimates have 
increasingly converged at the global level.2 Nevertheless, 
estimates diff
 er substantially in several countries, 
particularly 
in 
middle-income 
and 
high-income 
countries, where GBD estimates are based on data from 
vital registration systems and UNAIDS estimates are 
based on prevalence in high-risk groups and estimates 
of the fraction of the population in these groups. This 
report from GBD 2015 provides a unique perspective on 
the national-level epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, which 
includes a comprehensive assessment of HIV/AIDS 
incidence, prevalence, and deaths. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between Aug 18, 2015, and 
April 3, 2016, for studies that comprehensively assessed the 
burden of HIV/AIDS globally. Our search terms included “HIV” 
and “global” and “mortality” or “incidence” or “prevalence”, 
and searches were restricted to articles published in English up 
to April 1, 2016. To our knowledge through the search, Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) and UNAIDS are the only two sources 
that provide comparable evaluations of levels and trends of 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic at both the global and country level. 
UNAIDS has provided global estimates on HIV/AIDS since 
1997, and has developed two epidemiological programs to 
estimate incidence, prevalence, and mortality: Estimation and 
Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum. GBD 2013 used 
improved versions of Spectrum to generate comprehensive, 
comparable estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality across geographies. 
Studies from both organisations have shown rapid changes in 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide and that up-to-date 
epidemiological and demographic information is needed to 
more accurately assess the burden of HIV at both the country 
and global level.
Added value of this study
For GBD 2015, we systematically updated the key inputs to 
our HIV/AIDS estimation process, which includes prevalence 
from national surveys and antenatal care clinics, demographic 
input on fertility and migration, mortality on and off
  
antiretroviral therapy (ART), and background HIV-free 
mortality; updates to these inputs were concluded in 
April, 2016; October, 2015; December, 2015; and April, 2016, 
respectively. We also improved the integration of EPP, 
Spectrum, and the GBD all-cause mortality estimation process 
to make them internally consistent. For countries with 
high-quality vital registration data, we developed a new 
method to improve the accuracy of and consistency among 
estimates of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, and mortality 
leveraging the number of deaths recorded each year as caused 
by HIV/AIDS. This method also allowed us to use vital 
registration data to generate plausible incidence curves in 
countries that are not part of UNAIDS’ results, and in 
subnational units where we previously only had national-level 
data. We developed an ensemble model to reconcile HIV 
mortality estimates from EPP and Spectrum and from those 
indicated in GBD’s all-cause mortality estimation process. 
Remarkable progress has been made in curbing the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic worldwide; however, our fi
 ndings emphasise the 
need for continued eff
 orts from governments and 
international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 
2030, in view of the low ART coverage and stagnation in 
decline of annual new infections in the past decade. 
Implications of all available evidence 
Improving on existing models of HIV/AIDS burden estimates, 
this study provides the most comprehensive and internally 
consistent assessments of the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality worldwide so far. 
This timely report provides much needed assessment of 
achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6, and lays out 
the challenges facing the global community in progress 
towards the HIV goals enshrined in Sustainable Development 
Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets.

Methods 
Study design 
GBD is a systematic, scientifi
 c eff
 ort to quantify all-cause 
mortality; cause-specifi
 c mortality; and disease incidence, 
prevalence, and burden attributable to risk factors by age, 
sex, and geography over time. GBD 2015 includes 
195 countries and territories and covers the time span 
from 1980 to 2015. Additional details of the GBD cause 
hierarchy, data inputs and processing, and estimation 
methods have been published elsewhere.15
In brief, the GBD estimation framework for HIV
/AIDS 
used the general natural history epidemiological models, 
Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum, 
developed by UNAIDS for estimation of the burden of 
HIV/AIDS for their biannual report on the state of the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic at the global and country levels.1 
EPP uses HIV seroprevalence estimates from surveys 
and antenatal care clinics to estimate incidence curves 
that are consistent with the input data of prevalence and 
other factors, including on-ART and off
 -ART mortality 
and 
demographic 
information 
within 
the 
given 
population. Spectrum, a compartmental model, is used 
to generate age-specifi
 c and sex-specifi
 c incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality by use of the incidence curves 
generated in EPP and other key inputs, including 
program data on ART and prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission and other key assumptions of on-ART and 
off
 -ART mortality and HIV-free background mortality. 
Details of methods and parameters in EPP and Spectrum 
have been described previously.16–23
In GBD 2015, we improved on UNAIDS’ estimation 
procedures in four ways. First, we used additional data, 
both from vital registration systems and population 
health surveys, to measure seroprevalence. Second, we 
used consistent estimates of HIV-free mortality in both 
EPP and Spectrum, and in the estimation of on-ART and 
off
 -ART mortality—key inputs to both EPP and 
Spectrum. These HIV-free mortality rates, generated in 
GBD’s all-cause mortality estimation process, have 
linked our HIV/AIDS estimation process and the 
all-cause mortality estimation process. Third, we 
developed an adjustment process—cohort incidence bias 
adjust 
ment—to ensure that incidence and prevalence 
estimates formulated with Spectrum are consistent with 
HIV mortality estimates based on vital registration 
systems when available. Fourth, through an expanded 
literature search, we updated rates of on-ART mortality 
(appendix pp 6–10), particularly for developed countries, 
in close collaboration with the Antiretroviral Therapy 
Cohort Collaboration.24
Due to the interconnected nature of the HIV modelling 
process and the process of estimation of mortality and 
causes of death, data and codes for the GBD 2015 HIV 
estimation process will be made available along with all 
the GBD 2015 results, in compliance with the Guidelines 
for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER) developed by the WHO.25
Mortality estimation 
The GBD estimation framework contains three sources 
for estimates of HIV-specifi
 c mortality: estimated HIV 
mortality from Spectrum; estimated excess HIV
/AIDS 
mortality in our all-cause mortality estimation process;15 
and space–time Gaussian process regression smoothed 
cause-specifi
 c HIV
/AIDS mortality from vital registration

systems that were adjusted for incompleteness and 
misclassifi
 cation of causes of death. We used tailored 
estimation methods to produce fi
 nal estimates of 
mortality depending on age groups, and the availability 
and quality of data for mortality of HIV
/AIDS. 
We assigned countries and territories to one of four 
groups, depending on data availability and quality. Group 1 
included countries with prevalence data from either 
household surveys or antenatal care clinics, most of which 
have generalised epidemics. Group 2A referred to 
countries with high-quality vital registration systems, 
which in GBD 2015 included countries with more than 
25 years of vital registration data with more than 95% 
completeness. Group 2B referred to countries with vital 
registration systems that were not in group 2A. Group 2C 
included countries for which we had no data from a vital 
registration system. Briefl
 y, for adults in group 1 countries, 
we applied an ensemble model to average HIV
/AIDS 
mortality rates from Spectrum and those implied by the 
all-cause mortality estimation process. This approach was 
based on the fact that our estimation processes (appendix 
pp 12–15) in EPP, Spectrum, and all-cause mortality 
models were intrinsically linked by the same HIV-free 
mortality rates at the draw level for group 1 countries. 
Because EPP and Spectrum are largely based on prevalence 
estimates from surveys and antenatal care clinics and 
various assumptions, and all-cause mortality estimation 
process in group 1 countries are mostly based on sibling 
survival data with various biases that need to be corrected 
for, we used our ensemble model to give equal weights to 
HIV mortality estimates from the two processes. 
For adults in group 2A countries, we used the results 
from space–time Gaussian process regression for 
age-specifi
 c HIV mortality. For adults in group 2B and 
2C countries, we used the HIV-specifi
 c mortality rates 
from Spectrum with cohort incidence bias adjustment. 
For children younger than 5 years in group 1, we applied 
the proportion of all HIV deaths estimated within 
Spectrum 
to 
the 
age-specifi
 c 
all-cause 
mortality 
estimates. For children of this age in group 2A countries, 
we used space–time Gaussian process regression 
estimates of HIV mortality. For children aged 5–14 years 
from countries in group 1, we used the average of the 
HIV-specifi
 c mortality rates from Spectrum and the 
implied HIV mortality from the all-cause mortality 
process. For group 2A countries, we used estimates of 
HIV mortality from space–time Gaussian process 
regression. For groups 2B and 2C, we used the estimates 
of HIV-specifi
 c mortality from Spectrum. 
Incidence and prevalence estimation 
We generated incidence and prevalence estimates with 
the recoded Spectrum model with updated assumptions 
of on-ART and off
 -ART mortality and other program data 
from the UNAIDS country fi
 les. 
HIV cause-specifi
 c deaths from vital registration 
systems and sample registration systems are among the 
most reliable sources for estimation of the burden of 
HIV/AIDS. We used our cohort incidence bias adjust-
ment method to scale the sizes of each incidence cohort 
on the basis of the raw estimates of HIV mortality from 
Spectrum, using unadjusted incidence curves and those 
observed in the vital registration system with proper 
incompleteness and cause misclassifi
 cation adjust-
ments.15 For this procedure, we fi
 rst ran space–time 
Gaussian process regression on age-specifi
 c HIV/AIDS 
mortality rates after correcting for garbage codes, HIV 
misclassifi
 cation, and under-registration by use of 
formal demographic methods to generate complete 
time-series estimates by location, sex, year, and age. We 
then restructured Spectrum by addition of another com-
partment such that it could follow groups of people 
living with HIV/AIDS who were infected in a specifi
 c 
year and age group. We then ran the modifi
 ed program 
to produce 1000 draws of incidence, prevalence, and 
mortality for each location and sex combination. From 
this step, we were able to obtain the proportion of each 
infection cohort dying in each year and age cell after 
infection. We then used these proportions to weigh the 
ratio of the numbers of deaths based on the age-specifi
 c 
mortality rates from vital registration and processed by 
space–time Gaussian process regression, and the 
population estimated with Spectrum, and those directly 
from Spectrum. This process greatly improves both the 
model fi
 t on mortality data, closer to what the adjusted 
vital registration suggests, and the incidence mortality 
ratio. Further details of the method are described in 
appendix pp 13–15. 
Uncertainty analysis
We systematically propagated uncertainty across EPP, 
Spectrum, and the all-cause mortality estimation 
processes. We used 1000 draws of the quantities of 
interest throughout all the steps in the estimation 
process. Some key inputs to the HIV estimation process 
did not include uncertainty: these were estimates of 
fertility and population, HIV programme metrics 
(including coverage of ART and prevention of mother-to-
child transmission), and behavioural factors. We present 
results with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).

people living with HIV increased rapidly, from 
2·4 million (95% UI 2·1–2·8 million) in 1985, to 
28·0 million (27·1–29·3 million) in 2000 (fi
 gure 1B). 
From 2000 to 2015, the number of people living with HIV 
increased by 0·8% (95% UI 0·6–1·0) per year, reaching 
38·8 million (37·6–40·4 million) in 2015 (fi
 gure 1B). 
Global mortality peaked in 2005, at 1·8 million 
(95% UI 1·7–1·9 million) and subsequently fell by 5·5% 
(95% UI 5·0–5·9) per year to 1·2 million (1·1–1·3 million) 
in 2015 (fi
 gure 1C). The proportion of people living with 
HIV and receiving ART increased rapidly for both sexes 
between 2005 and 2015, from 6·4% (95% UI 5·6–7·4) to 
38·6% (37·2–40·0) of men, and from 3·3% (3·0–3·6) to 
42·4% (41·0–43·7) of women (fi
 gure 1D).
In 2015, 1·8 million (95% UI 1·7–2·1 million) new HIV 
infections, 75·4% (71·7–78·5) of new cases, were in 
sub-Saharan Africa, with large proportions in western, 
southern, and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (fi
 gure 2A). 
Outside sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia accounted for 
206 830 (171 790–249 700), or 8·5% (7·0–10·0), of new 
infections per year (fi
 gure 2A). Southeast Asia accounted 
for 4·7% (95% UI 2·8–8·1) of global infections in 2015, 
and east Asia accounted for 2·3% (1·7–3·1; fi
 gure 2A). 
Distributions of new infections by sex were broadly 
similar (appendix pp 26–38); and prevalence and 
mortality have also been greatest in sub-Saharan Africa 
(appendix pp 59, 60). HIV infection rates varied 
tremendously across countries in 2015 (fi
 gure 2B; see 
appendix pp 64, 65 for incidence for 1990 and 2005). The 
highest rates of infection were in southern Africa, with 
more than 1% of the population per year becoming 
infected in Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland (fi
 gure 2B). 
Within sub-Saharan Africa, rates in excess of 150 per 
100 000 people occurred in a cluster of countries from 
Nigeria to Tanzania, with the notable exceptions of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (42·0 per 100 000; 
95% UI 12·3–101·7) and Ethiopia (39·4 per 100 000; 
19·7–62·5; fi
 gure 2B). The highest estimated incidence 
rates in Europe were recorded in Russia, and in Asia 
were recorded in Cambodia (fi
 gure 2B). In the Americas, 
only Belize, Guyana, and Haiti had rates of more than 
50 per 100 000 people (fi
 gure 2B). Among the countries 
in the highest quintile of sociodemographic index 
(a composite indicator based on equally weighted 
estimates of lag-distributed income per capita, average 
years of education among populations over 15 years, and 
total fertility rate),15 countries with incidence rates of 
more than 15 infections per 100 000 people included 
Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Trinidad 
and Tobago, and Russia. Annualised rates of change 
show that although incidence substantially declined 
globally from 2005 to 2015, rates increased in 74 countries 
(table).
Due to improved access to treatment, prevalence 
compared with incidence was higher in countries with 
a high sociodemographic index (table). Six countries 
(Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, South Africa, 
and Zimbabwe) had a HIV prevalence of more than 10% 
of the entire population. Nine countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa (Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial 
Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, 
and Zambia) had a prevalence of more than 2·5% of the 
entire population. Outside sub-Saharan Africa, a further 
11 countries (the Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, Dominican 
Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Cambodia, Portugal, Suriname, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines) had prevalence rates between 0·5% and 
2·5% (appendix p 57). In the past 10 years, global scale-up 
of ART has been extraordinary, especially in eastern 
and southern sub-Saharan Africa (fi
 gure 3A). However, 
despite these increases, the proportion of people living 
with HIV and receiving ART is highly variable and 
remains at very low levels in many countries, particularly 
in the Middle East and North Africa, eastern Europe, 
central Asia, east Asia, and some countries in southeast 
Asia (fi
 gure 3B). We recorded coverage in excess of 40% 
in North America, western Europe, Australasia; the arc of 
countries in eastern South America, from Guyana to 
Argentina and Chile; and the corridor of countries from 
Uganda to South Africa (fi
 gure 3B).
HIV death rates and recent time trends vary greatly 
across countries (table). Deaths vary substantially by age,

Data in parentheses are 95% uncertainty intervals. New infections and HIV/AIDS deaths are cumulative for the whole of 2015. The number of people living with HIV is the point prevalence (as a count) at the end 
of 2015. The number of people living with HIV receiving ART and the total number of people living with HIV are year-end point prevalences. We calculated numerators for incidence, prev 
alence, and mortality 
rates with counts as previously described. The denominator for each rate was population at mid-year. We age-standardised rates with the WHO age standard. We calculated ARC as the slope from the log of the 
value in 2015, to the log of the value in 2005: (log[value 2015]–log[value 2005])/10. ART=antiretroviral therapy. ARC=annualised rate of change. SDI=sociodemographic index.

showing both the patterns of incidence by age, diff
 erential 
rates of progression by sex and age, and diff
 erential ART 
coverage (fi
 gure 4A). More women than men died in 
people aged 15–29 years; after age 35 years, there were 
more deaths in men (fi
 gure 4A). Deaths in people aged 
50 years and older account for 10% (95% UI 3·8–11·8) of 
deaths in men and 7·6% (1·5–9·8) of deaths in women 
(fi
 gure 4A). We recorded substantial heterogeneity in 
HIV mortality among countries in 2015 (appendix p 63). 
Among HIV
/AIDS deaths in 2015, 17·8% were caused by 
HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, down from 19·6% in 
2005 (fi
 gure 4A). We compared HIV deaths with the 
number of people living with HIV to provide a simple 
estimate of the annual excess mortality rate (fi
 gure 4B). 
This ratio is a function of the timing of the epidemic and 
the access to and quality of ART and other care. Of note, 
this ratio was much lower in GBD high-income regions 
than in other GBD super-regions.
At the time of writing, the latest available assessment 
from UNAIDS was published in 2016, at the global and 
regional level only.26 UNAIDS country level estimates are 
from their 2014 update for years up to 2014.27 GBD 2015 
estimates of prevalence are in accordance with the 
UNAIDS estimates. For 2015, estimations of the people 
living with HIV were 38·8 million (95% UI 
37·6–40·4 million) in GBD 2015, and 36·7 million 
(34·0–39·8 million) in UNAIDS 2016. Comparisons of 
prevalence estimates at the country level in 2005 and 
2014, show strong concordance between the two estimate 
series, with an average intraclass correlation coeffi
  cient 
of 0·997 (fi
 gure 5A shows prevalence from both sources 
for 2014). The highest relative diff
 erences in prevalence 
among sub-Saharan African countries in 2014 were in 
Senegal, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Congo, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and South Africa, 
where GBD 2015 estimates are at least 10% higher than 
those from UNAIDS 2014 (fi
 gure 5A). UNAIDS tends to 
have much higher estimates of mortality at the peak of 
the HIV
/AIDS epidemic around 2005, and lower 
estimates in 2014, than GBD 2015; we noted a much 
higher level of heterogeneity at the country level 
(fi
 gure 5B). For countries in sub-Saharan Africa, GBD 
estimates of mortality are higher than those from 
UNAIDS 2014 for 26 countries. Among these countries, 
GBD estimates are more than 10% higher than UNAIDS 
2014 estimates in 22 countries. For South Africa, our 
estimated deaths are 17·2% higher than UNAIDS 2014 
estimates. The highest diff
 erences are in Swaziland and 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, where GBD 2015 
estimates are more than 80% higher than UNAIDS’ 
(fi
 gure 5B). 
For estimates of annual new infections, UNAIDS 2014 
has slightly higher estimates for years before 2000. 
Although the estimates are similar between the two 
series for most of the 2000s, the series have diff
 ered 
substantially since 2007 at the global level. UNAIDS 2014 
estimated a much faster rate of decline in annual new 
infections than did GBD 2015. Globally, GBD 2015 
estimates about 2·5 million new infections in 2014, 
whereas UNAIDS estimates about 2 million for the same 
year. UNAIDS 2016 has slightly higher estimates of 
incidence than the 2014 publication, at 2·1 million for 
2015. In terms of annualised rate of decline in new 
infections between 2005 and 2014, GBD 2015 estimates 
about a 0·4% decline per year, whereas the UNAIDS 
estimates from 2014 show a 3·3% decline per year. In

only seven countries (Madagascar, Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, 
Rwanda, and The Gambia) in sub-Saharan Africa, 
annualised rates of decline in new infections are faster in 
GBD 2015 than in UNAIDS 2014. In Côte d’Ivoire, 
Burundi, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Nigeria, Botswana, 
and Kenya, GBD 2015 estimates an increase in numbers 
of new infections, whereas UNAIDS 2014 predicts a 
decline. The biggest diff
 erence is in Kenya, where results 
from GBD 2015 show an increase in annual new 
infections from 60 000 in 2005, to 146 700 in 2014, 
whereas UNAIDS shows a decrease from 73 000 to 56 000 
during the same period. 
Discussion 
Remarkable progress has been made in curbing the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide. HIV incidence reached 
its peak in 1997, and HIV deaths have been declining 
since the mid-2000s. However, annual incidence has 
stayed relatively constant since 2005, after a period of 
faster decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of 
people living with HIV
/AIDS has been steadily 
increasing, and reached 38·8 million in 2015. At the 
country level, disparate levels and trends of the epidemic 
persist. These updated estimates at the global level are 
similar to those published in the GBD 2013 iteration for 
deaths; however, our present estimates for incidence and 
prevalence are lower for 2013 than in GBD 2013.1
The unfolding global HIV pandemic has advanced 
through three phases during which HIV/AIDS mortality 
has increased from 4·73 per 100 000 in 1995, the 
39th-ranked cause of death, to 16·18 per 100 000 in 2015, 
the 11th-ranked cause of death worldwide. In the initial 
phase (1981–97), global HIV incidence and the number 
of people living with HIV increased, followed by huge 
increases in deaths related to the disease. From 1998 to 
2005, incidence declined by 25·4%; however, because of 
the lag between infection and mortality, the number of 
deaths caused by HIV increased. In the third phase, 
mass 
scale-up 
of 
prevention 
of 
mother-to-child 
trans 
mission and ART, particularly in low-income 
sub-Saharan Africa, led to a phase of declining HIV 
mortality, a decade of stagnation in the decline of global 
incidence rates, and steadily rising prevalence. These 
global patterns mask well documented but extraordinary 
heterogeneity across countries. Epidemics leading to 
more than 2·5% of the population being infected have 
happened largely in eastern, southern, and central 
sub-Saharan Africa. Although death rates and incidence 
declined in the past decade in many of these countries, 
they are increasing in many others where prevalence has 
been lower until now, such as Indonesia and the 
Philippines. The scale-up of ART, a key driver of the 
trends, has led to 41% of people living with HIV receiving 
ART worldwide.7 
The scale-up of interventions for HIV
/AIDS represents 
one of the great successes of global health collective 
action. This scale-up, particularly in low-income countries, 
has been fuelled by the increase in develop 
ment assistance 
for HIV from $1·3 billion in 2000, to $10·8 billion in

2015.12,13 The need for HIV programmes, particularly ART 
programmes, continues to grow because of both the 
sustained high incidence of infections and the success of 
ART in extending the lifespan of people living with HIV. 
However, since 2010, development assistance for HIV has 
remained nearly constant.12 This absence of additional 
funding is by stark contrast with the $36 billion needed 
annually to achieve the UN goal to end AIDS by 2030, as 
estimated by Piot and colleagues.9 UNAIDS and other 
international development agencies hope that the growing 
need for funding will be partly solved by expanded health 
spending by low-income countries.28,29 However, Dieleman 
and colleagues12,13 suggest that, on the basis of trends in 
the past few years, health spending in low-income 
countries will grow only slightly in the next 25 years. 
How will the impending fi
 nancing gap be addressed? 
In middle-income countries, increased commitments to 
funding health programmes from national budgets could 
fi
 ll the gap. But in low-income countries, where, as in 
eastern and some countries in southern sub-Saharan 
Africa, HIV rates are the highest, domestic resources will 
not be suffi
  cient. Dieleman and colleagues30 projected that 
government health expenditure is going to increase from 
$30·8 billion (95% UI 29·9–31·8 billion) in 2015, to 
$53·1 billion (47·5–57·9 billion) in 2030, in southern 
sub-Saharan Africa.
Meeting the needs of people living with HIV will 
require a combination of concentrating development 
assistance for HIV on these low-income countries, 
improving the effi
  ciency of HIV programmes, increasing 
domestic fi
 nancing, lowering the cost of treatment 
(including prices of ART drugs), and reducing future 
incidence through more concerted eff
 orts. Development 
assistance eff
 orts will also need to be scaled up if the free 
fl
 ow of low-cost generic drugs is hampered. Additionally, 
public and private sectors need to be incentivised to 
continue research and development of new and better 
prevention and treatment strategies to combat the 
epidemic in the long term. Special eff
 orts need to be 
made in high-risk populations in both concentrated and 
generalised epidemic settings in view of the continued 
high rate of transmission among these subpopulations, 
including men who have sex with men and injecting 
drug users. However, on the basis of the epidemiological 
and fi
 nancial trends, there is a major risk of a substantial 
shortfall in necessary funds to sustain life-saving ART 
programmes. The scarcity of adequate funds to provide 
ART for people living with HIV, together with the 
possibility of increasing drug resistance to existing ART 
treatments, will make achievement of the goal to end 
AIDS by 2030 extremely diffi
  cult.
WHO now recommends universal ART for all people 
with HIV.31,32 In 2015, only 41% of people living with HIV 
were receiving ART; however, the 90-90-90 goals imply 
that 81% should be receiving ART and 73% will have viral 
suppression, which no country has yet achieved. 
Achievement of 81% ART coverage would require 
extension of ART coverage to at least 15·5 million 
additional people living with HIV by 2020, which implies 
an addition of 3·1 million per year between 2015 and 
2020, while ensuring complete treatment adherence. 
Concerted eff
 orts will be needed to scale up detection of 
new infections to meet the target of 90% of people 
knowing their status. The targeted expansion in ART 
coverage would play an important part in reducing the 
still high number of individuals dying from HIV. 
However, such expansion has enormous cost implications 
in an era when even maintenance of coverage in some 
low-income settings could be at risk in the presence of 
declining development assistance for health. Increased 
ART coverage might also play a part in reducing 
population 
transmission 
of 
HIV 
and 
therefore 
incidence.33,34 The quality of ART embodied in the third 
90 target of the UNAIDS strategy remains a major issue, 
as does the potential role of other care in extending 
survival. The simple comparison between HIV deaths 
and HIV prevalence shows that death rates in 
HIV-positive individuals are much lower in high-income 
countries than elsewhere. In fact, probability of death 
from HIV
/AIDS while on ART in sub-Saharan Africa is 
on average 6·5 times higher than the probability in 
high-income countries among diff
 erent age groups and 
time since start of ART treatment.
Calls for the end of AIDS have captured the 
imagination of the global health community.35 Largely 
as a result of the course of the HIV epidemic itself and 
spreading awareness of HIV among the general 
population, incidence declined between 1997, the year 
with peaked incidence, and 2005. However, our present 
estimates of HIV incidence, albeit driven mostly by 
prevalence data, suggest that incidence might not have 
declined much in the past decade. Incidence remained 
high, despite that much development assistance for 
HIV was spent on prevention programmes. Once the 
notable success of scale-up of prevention of mother-to-
child transmission and reductions in transmission to 
children is accounted for, adult incidence remained 
even more resistant to change in the past 10 years. 
Eff
 ective strategies, such as male circumcision and 
PrEP, are available to reduce transmission even without 
changing sexual behaviour.36–38 Barrier methods for HIV 
prevention are also eff
 ective in reducing risk for 
transmission, as are some interventions targeting 
high-risk groups, such as needle exchanges.39,40 Despite 
the existence of these approaches, incidence has not 
changed substantially. Although incidence has declined 
from 40·2 to 33·2 per 100 000 people at an annualised 
rate of decline of 1·9%, annual new infections have 
stayed relatively constant at about 2·5 million a year for 
the past decade. This fi
 nding could be explained by 
many factors, including that viral load suppression 
might be lower than the estimated 70% in low-income 
and middle-income countries, that ART coverage might 
be exaggerated in some countries, or that the rate of

unsafe sex could be increasing in settings where the 
perceived risk of HIV has been reduced.
Worldwide, Millennium Development Goal 6, to halt 
and reverse the spread of HIV and provide universal 
access to treatment for those who need it by 2015, has not 
been achieved. Between 2005 and 2015, 102 of 
195 countries have experienced an increase in annual 
new infections. In sub-Saharan Africa, 15 of 46 countries 
managed to decrease annual infection during the same 
period. No countries had achieved the 81% target in 2015, 
and most developing countries have important gaps to 
fi
 ll by 2020.1 Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to 
end HIV/AIDS by 2030. Achievement of such an 
ambitious goal will require great improvements in 
prevention eff
 orts. The PEPFAR pivot, with its focus on 
high-transmission areas, might provide one such 
strategy,35 but the eff
 ectiveness of this approach is 
unproven, and the planning and evaluation for such 
programmes needs more granular data on the epidemic 
level and trends at the subnational level, which are still 
largely missing in most countries. To further reduce 
mortality from HIV/AIDS, another priority should 
be towards prevention, detection, and treatment of 
tuberculosis among people living with HIV as part of a 
strategy to reduce HIV disease progression and 
transmission, because tuber 
culosis, although largely 
preventable and treatable, is one of the most common 
opportunistic infections and the leading cause of death 
among HIV-infected individuals, as our study has shown. 
Our assessment of HIV incidence and mortality in 
countries without vital registration data is driven by 
prevalence surveys and surveillance data on the 
prevalence of HIV among individuals attending 
antenatal care clinics. Estimation of incidence from 
prevalence is based on a set of assumptions about CD4 
progression rates, off
 -ART and on-ART HIV death 
rates, and ART coverage. Such statistical back-
estimation is inherently uncertain for recent time 
periods for which changes in incidence will not have 
changed prevalence as quickly. So far, eff
 orts to develop 
incidence assays that can diff
 erentiate new from old 
infections have not been suffi
  ciently robust or widely 
enough deployed to include in our or UNAIDS’ 
estimation eff
 orts, and the necessary sample sizes to 
track incidence could be challenging to obtain.41–43 
Repeated measurements, such as the Swaziland HIV 
Incidence Measurement Survey (SHIMS), provide 
information about incidence in very few settings.44 
Compared with the prevalence-based calculations, the 
SHIMS results show 2·4 infections per 100 person-
years (95% UI 2·06–2·75) for 2011, which is consistent 
with GBD 2015 estimations of 2·15 infections per 
100 people (1·91–2·46) for the same year. In view of the 
heightened focus on reducing HIV incidence as part of 
the end-of-AIDS vision, more eff
 orts are needed to 
systematically supplement the approach of estimating 
incidence with prevalence data by use of additional 
information about case notifi
 cations with CD4 status, 
HIV viral load, and alternative assays as they emerge.
Our models, in addition to UNAIDS models for 
estimating HIV incidence and mortality, depend heavily 
on estimates of prevention of mother-to-child trans-
mission and ART coverage. These numbers are 
developed by UNAIDS in consultation with national 
governments, the Global Fund, and PEPFAR.45 However, 
the underlying data at the facility or provider level are 
not available for inspection, critical appraisal, or 
validation. Evidence from countries where survey data 
for use of ART are available, such as Kenya, suggests 
that national assessments of numbers of people on ART 
collated by UNAIDS might be too high.46–48 If these 
fi
 ndings were true in other countries, our estimates of 
ART coverage could likewise be exaggerated, as could 
our estimates of deaths from HIV. Data transparency for 
models used in global health estimation is rapidly 
increasing. GBD have adopted the GATHER guidelines 
developed by WHO and other partners.25 In the future, 
having input data on ART and prevention of mother-to-
child transmission meet the GATHER guideline bar of 
transparency would be highly benefi
 cial. Political 
sensitivities in some countries have restricted the 
transparency of UNAIDS on this issue; even the basic 
incidence and prevalence estimates generated by 
UNAIDS cannot be released for some countries such as 
India and Russia because of such issues. Fostering a 
culture of greater transparency and accountability for 
HIV prevention and treatment programmes will benefi
 t 
everyone concerned with tackling HIV more eff
 ectively 
in the future.
Subnational assessments, when available, suggest much 
spatial heterogeneity of HIV incidence, prevalence, and 
death.49–51 Use of more disaggregated assessments of the 
HIV epidemic will hopefully improve the quality of the 
results and the relevance to HIV prevention and treatment 
programmes. Disaggregated assessments of prevalence 
derived from survey data and surveillance data from 
antenatal care clinics are feasible. Progress will be needed 
on the availability of data for prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission and ART at the local level. Perhaps even 
more challenging is the need for estimates of the various 
demographic inputs required for the modelling eff
 orts, 
including migration, fertility, and HIV-free mortality. The 
push toward district-level or even more fi
 ne-grained 
estimation is one of the most promising directions for 
improved estimation of the epidemic overall. 
Substantial diff
 erences between men and women 
remain in many aspects of the HIV epidemic. Our 
analysis shows that the age pattern of HIV
/AIDS 
mortality is younger in women than in men. This fi
 nding 
is largely thought to result from age-disparate 
relationships in which men tend to have sex with women 
younger than them.52,53 Furthermore, more women use 
ART, as shown by the roughly 15·4% higher ART 
coverage for women than men in 2015. We also recorded 
 Articles

a high level of heterogeneity at the country level, with 
female ART coverage 50% higher than male coverage in 
countries such as Gabon, The Gambia, Nigeria, and 
Sierra Leone; at the same time, in India, Lithuania, and 
Maldives, male ART coverage was 50% higher. 
The GBD 2015 estimates of prevalence are in line with 
those from UNAIDS 2014. The high concordance of 
country-level prevalence estimates between the two series 
is unsurprising given that they are both based on similar 
input datasets for prevalence. Much of the diff
 erence 
between the two estimates is a result of diff
 erent 
assumptions of on-ART and off
 -ART mortality, background 
HIV-free mortality rate, initial CD4 distribution, and CD4 
progression ratios. Further studies and close collaboration 
between UNAIDS and GBD are needed to fully understand 
the relative contribution of each of the aforementioned 
factors to the diff
 erence in estimates of incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality at the country level. 
This analysis of data for HIV has several further 
limitations. First, we have used data from the 
Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration to improve 
the assessment of death rates of patients on ART in 
high-income countries. However, we have not been able 
to incorporate data for the variation in quality of ART 
programmes such as viral load suppression by country. 
This information is not widely available. Second, our 
novel cohort incidence bias adjustment method leverages 
cause-of-death data to correct past incidence for each 
cohort. Although our testing shows that the method 
works fairly well, the information content in the approach 
for adjustments in the most recent time period is much 
more restricted than for earlier periods. Estimates of 
incidence with this approach in the most recent time 
periods might be biased. Third, we have attempted to 
propagate multiple sources of uncertainty into our fi
 nal 
estimates. Because we did not include uncertainty 
caused by variation in the quality of ART and might 
underestimate uncertainty in ART coverage, our fi
 nal 
uncertainty intervals could be too narrow. At the global 
level, our uncertainty levels might also be too narrow 
because we assume uncertainty in each country is 
independent of other countries. Fourth, we have not used 
the surveillance data for new cases in our analysis. 
Integration of such information in the future will 
probably increase the accuracy of incidence and 
prevalence estimates. Fifth, prevalence and programme 
data are still sparse in most countries. Prevalence 
estimates are largely determined by adjusted antenatal 
clinic data and national surveys. To depict the epidemic in 
populations accurately, rigorous data collection is needed. 
For example, ART coverage data should be directly 
collected in surveys through viral load testing, such as in 
the Lesotho 2014 Demographic and Health Survey,54 and 
questions about ART. Sixth, our study focuses on deaths 
with HIV
/AIDS as the underlying cause of death and 
does not account for excess mortality from other 
non-communicable causes of deaths among people living 
with HIV. Seventh, input data tend to be sparse for the 
most recent time period, and our models might have not 
captured the recent progress and lack thereof in some 
countries. Eighth, our models have not directly used 
other important variables, such as prevalence of sexually 
transmitted infections or rates of ART adherence, ART 
treatment failure, and HIV testing, as used by Optima 
(appendix p 56).55 These variables should be included in 
future updates to improve the precision of our estimates. 
Finally, although we integrated HIV cause-specifi
 c 
mortality data in our modelling framework for a large 
group of countries with vital registration data, inclusion 
of additional data sources such as HIV surveillance and 
case report in our analytical framework could improve the 
accuracy of our incidence estimates. 
Enormous progress has been made in reducing HIV 
deaths, especially in low-income countries, through the 
expansion of prevention of mother-to-child transmission 
and ART programmes funded largely through develop-
ment assistance for HIV. However, achievement of the 
UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets will require major changes in 
how programmes are delivered and fi
 nanced. Global 
eff
 orts have had less impact on the incidence of new 
infections than on HIV mortality. Ending the AIDS 
epidemic by 2030 will require a dramatic change in how 
HIV prevention is pursued.
