Abstract
Background
Potentially modifiable lifestyle factors may influence cognitive health in later life and offer poten-
tial to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The concept of cognitive reserve has
been proposed as a mechanism to explain individual differences in rates of cognitive decline,
but its potential role as a mediating pathway has seldom been explored using data from large
epidemiological studies. We explored the mediating effect of cognitive reserve on the cross-
sectional association between lifestyle factors and cognitive function in later life using data
from a population-based cohort of healthy older people.
Methods and findings
We analysed data from 2,315 cognitively healthy participants aged 65 y and over in the Cog-
nitive Function and Ageing Study Wales (CFAS-Wales) cohort collected in 2011–2013. Lin-
ear regression modelling was used to investigate the overall associations between five
lifestyle factors—cognitive and social activity, physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption,
and smoking—and cognition, adjusting for demographic factors and chronic conditions.
Mediation analysis tested for indirect effects of the lifestyle factors on cognition via cognitive
reserve. After controlling for age, gender, and the presence of chronic conditions, cognitive
and social activity, physical activity, healthy diet, and light-to-moderate alcohol consumption
were positively associated with cognitive function, together accounting for 20% (95% CI
17%–23%) of variance in cognitive test scores. Cognitive reserve was an important media-
tor of this association, with indirect effects via cognitive reserve contributing 21% (95% CI
15%–27%) of the overall effect on cognition. The main limitations of the study derive from

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Individual differences in lifestyle factors such as physical activity or diet may be
related to differences in mental fitness in later life.
• Differences in the extent to which mental fitness declines in later life are thought
to arise because some people’s earlier experiences (for example, staying on for
further education or playing a leadership role in a job) make their brains more
resilient to changes resulting from age or illness—they have higher “cognitive
reserve.”
• We wanted to find out whether the concept of cognitive reserve explains how lifestyle
influences mental fitness.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We used data from 2,315 mentally fit participants aged over 65 y who took part in
the first wave of interviews for the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study Wales
(CFAS-Wales).
• Our statistical analyses examined whether a healthy lifestyle (a healthy diet, more
physical activity, more social and mentally stimulating activity, moderate alcohol
consumption, and refraining from smoking), adjusted to take account of age, gender,
and whether people had long-term health conditions, was associated with perfor-
mance on a test of mental ability.
• When we found an association, we then investigated whether this association was
explained by the level of cognitive reserve.
• We found that people with a healthier lifestyle had better mental fitness, and this was
partly accounted for by their level of cognitive reserve.
What do these findings mean?
• These results highlight the importance of policies and interventions that encourage
older people to make changes in their diet, exercise more, and engage in more
socially oriented and mentally stimulating activities.

 • Earlier life experiences build cognitive reserve, which helps to maintain mental fit-
ness in later life, so access to education and opportunities to develop skills in the
workplace are important in developing this resilience.
• The main limitation of this study is that we used data collected at only one time
point, which means that we cannot draw any conclusions about causes or trajectories
—we can only say for sure that lifestyle and mental fitness are related.
Introduction
Cognitive health is a major factor in ensuring the quality of life of older people and preserving
independence. Cognitive health is the development and preservation of the multidimensional
cognitive structure that allows older people to maintain social connectedness, an ongoing
sense of purpose, and the abilities to function independently, to permit functional recovery
from illness or injury, and to cope with residual functional deficits [1]. The key components of
cognitive health are mental abilities and acquired skills, as well as the ability to apply these so
as to engage in purposeful activity [2].
Loss of cognitive health is not an inevitable part of ageing. Some influences on cognitive
health, such as gender, genetic profile, history of chronic disease, early life experiences, and
the impact of socioeconomic adversity and limited educational opportunity [3,4], cannot be
directly modified. Nevertheless, cognitive plasticity—the capacity for enhancement of function
in response to altered inputs or environments—is retained to some degree even in later life
[5,6]. Furthermore, a systematic appraisal of evidence regarding risk and protective factors for
Alzheimer disease has yielded robust evidence for several potentially modifiable lifestyle fac-
tors associated with risk level: cognitive activity, social engagement, physical activity, diet,
alcohol consumption, and smoking [7]. The contribution of modifiable lifestyle factors to cog-
nitive health means that there may be potential to stabilise or improve declining trajectories of
cognitive function. Targeting potentially modifiable lifestyle factors could have positive bene-
fits for cognitive health in later life and serve as a counterweight to elevated genetic risk [8].
In considering the potential for risk reduction, it is important to consider by what mecha-
nisms these lifestyle factors influence cognitive health. Few studies have explored the potential
mechanisms involved. Many of the factors identified as relevant to increasing (smoking and
high alcohol consumption) or reducing (healthy diet and physical exercise) risk of dementia
are equally relevant to other health conditions, particularly through their impact on cardiovas-
cular health [9]. Engagement in cognitive and social activity, however, appears more directly
linked to cognitive health.
The concept of cognitive reserve has been proposed to account for individual differences in
trajectories of cognitive health and rates of cognitive decline [10]. Cognitive reserve has been
defined as the ability of the brain to optimize or maximize performance through differential
recruitment of brain networks or use of alternative strategies [10]. Engagement in mental
activity—for example, through undertaking education or working in occupations that involve
complex demands—is a key determinant of level of cognitive reserve [11,12]. Cognitive reserve
reflects the capacity to provide a buffer against the effects of dementia-related brain pathology
so that a greater burden of pathology is needed before signs of cognitive decline or symptoms
of dementia become evident. It is possible that lifestyle factors may exert their effects on risk
by increasing the efficiency of neural networks and hence enhancing cognitive reserve,

 resulting in greater resilience against the effects of developing neuropathology [13,14]. Cogni-
tive reserve is a latent construct that cannot be directly measured, and assessment therefore
relies on proxy indicators. Although cognitive reserve is often indexed by a single proxy mea-
sure such as education or IQ, emphasis has recently been placed on the need to combine multi-
ple indicators [15].
This potential pathway via cognitive reserve may help to explain the association between life-
style factors and cognitive function and thus inform the development of dementia prevention
or risk reduction strategies. An appropriate first step is to explore the relationships between
these constructs cross-sectionally to determine whether cognitive reserve does indeed play a
mediating role. Few empirical studies have investigated this potential mediating pathway, and,
in particular, it has seldom been explored in large epidemiological cohorts of older people. Fur-
thermore, most studies have used a single indicator of cognitive reserve, typically education; we
could not find any previous studies to date that have used a combined measure of cognitive
reserve when examining the relationship between lifestyle factors and cognition [15]. Identify-
ing a mediating role for cognitive reserve in the relationship between current lifestyle factors
and cognition is complex because it is likely that past lifestyle will also have influenced these
relationships. Therefore, care is needed in selecting appropriate indices to include in a proxy
measure of cognitive reserve. In this study, education and occupational complexity were incor-
porated in a combined proxy measure.
In this cross-sectional analysis, we aimed to explore the potential mediating effect of cogni-
tive reserve, indexed by a combination of educational level and occupational complexity, on the
association between lifestyle factors and cognitive function in later life, using data from a large
population-based cohort of healthy older people in Wales, United Kingdom. We hypothesized
that cognitive reserve would mediate the association between potentially modifiable lifestyle fac-
tors (cognitive activity, social engagement, physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, and
smoking) and cognitive function.
Methods
Study population
Ethical approval was granted by the North Wales Research Ethics Committee (West), refer-
ence number 10/WNo01/37. The Cognitive Function and Ageing Study Wales (CFAS-Wales)
is a longitudinal population-based study of people aged 65 y and over in rural (Gwynedd and
Ynys Mo
ˆn) and urban (Neath Port Talbot) areas of Wales that aims to investigate physical and
cognitive health in older age and examine the interactions between health, social networks,
activity, and participation. Individuals aged 65 y and over were randomly sampled from gen-
eral medical practice lists between 2011 and 2013, stratified by age to ensure equal numbers
in two age groups, 65–74 y and 75+ y. The response rate, in terms of the proportion of those
eligible and contactable who participated, was 44%. A further 13% were unable to participate
because of ill health. Those who provided written consent to join the study were interviewed
in their own homes by trained interviewers and could choose to have the interview conducted
through the medium of either English or Welsh. Participants were followed up 2 y later. In this
study, we conducted cross-sectional analyses with data from the first wave of interviews (data
version 2.0).
While CFAS-Wales is linked to CFAS-II, which was conducted at three sites in England,
there are some differences between the two studies in terms of measures used, and, impor-
tantly for this study, Wales has over the generations had a somewhat different education sys-
tem from that of England. The original CFAS included sites in both England and Wales, and
the analysis attempted to compensate for these differences, but given that this was already a

 cross-sectional analysis, it was considered preferable to ensure as homogeneous a population
as possible, and hence, we restricted our analyses to CFAS-Wales data.
The baseline sample consisted of 3,593 individuals. For the present analysis, it was impor-
tant to exclude people with cognitive impairment to avoid potential reverse causality. We
excluded anyone with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [16] score � 25 (n = 908) or
an AGECAT [17] classification of dementia (n = 185). We also excluded those with an AGE-
CAT classification of depression (n = 333), those living in institutions (n = 95), those without
complete interview data (n = 80), and those with missing cognitive test scores (n = 4). The
sample for this study therefore included 2,315 participants from CFAS-Wales.
Measures
Cognitive function was measured by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), a
brief neuropsychological battery designed to assess a range of cognitive functions in the older
population, with possible scores ranging from 0–107 [18].
Cognitive reserve was measured by combining two proxy indicators: educational level
(years of full-time education) and occupational complexity. Main occupation was recoded
using social class and socioeconomic group systems and then reclassified into 15 groups
reflecting different levels of occupational complexity [19]. The weights for each component
were generated based on the interquartile range to ensure equal contributions to the combined
cognitive reserve score, resulting in the following formula:
Cognitive reserve score ¼ 1:7 � ðyears of educationÞ þ 1 � ðoccupational complexity levelÞ:
Level of physical activity was determined by the reported frequency of engagement in 18
types of mild (light gardening, bowls, light housework, and home repairs), moderate (garden-
ing, electric lawn mowing, cleaning the car, walking at a moderate pace, dancing, floor or
stretching exercises, and heavy housework), and vigorous (jogging, swimming, cycling, aero-
bics or gym, tennis, heavy gardening, and manual lawn mowing) physical activity. A continu-
ous scale was generated using the frequency levels (0 = once a year or less, 1 = several times a
year, 2 = several times a month, 3 = several times a week, and 4 = every day or almost every
day) multiplied by the intensity ratio (mild: moderate: vigorous = 1:2:3), which was based on
the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) ratio suggested in the literature [20].
Current and exsmokers were identified using two questions: “Do you smoke?” and “Have
you ever smoked?”
Self-reported information on the frequency of alcohol consumption over the last 12 mo was
used to classify participants into four groups: nearly abstinent (not at all in the last 12 mo or
once or twice a year); infrequent drinkers (once or twice a month or once every couple of
months); frequent light-to-moderate drinkers (once or twice a week or three or four times a
week); and regular light-to-moderate drinkers (five or six times a week or almost every day).
To describe the overall dietary pattern, a total score for healthy diet was generated. CFAS--
Wales investigated the frequency of eating (never, seldom, once a week, 2–4 times a week, 5–6
times a week, or daily) and the number of servings per day of fresh fruit, green leafy vegetables,
other vegetables, fatty fish, other fish, and wholemeal/brown bread and daily servings of starch
foods, dairy foods, and sugary foods. This analysis focused on the frequency of “Mediterra-
nean-style” food intake including fresh fruit, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, fatty fish,
other fish, and wholemeal/brown bread. The frequency included six levels: never, seldom,
once a week, 2–4 times a week, 5–6 times a week, or daily. Although evidence has suggested
that these are all beneficial components for dementia risk reduction, the amounts and cutoffs
selected considerably vary across studies ([21,22]). To describe the overall dietary pattern, a

 total score for healthy diet was generated based on the six levels of frequency. The range was
between 2 (least frequent) and 30 (most frequent), and the mean was 18.2 (standard deviation
[SD]: 4.4).
A summary score for cognitive and social activity was generated based on the frequency of
seven cognitive (listening to the radio, reading a newspaper, reading a magazine, reading a
book, playing games such as cards or chess, doing crosswords, and doing puzzles) and three
social activities (“How often do you see any of your [children or other] relatives to speak to?”
“Do you attend meetings or any community or social groups?” and “How often do you see any
of your neighbours to have a chat or do something with?”). We combined the scores for cogni-
tive and social activity as in many activities cognitive and social elements are closely interlinked.
Covariates
Information about age, gender, and the presence of chronic conditions was obtained from the
interview. Five chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, and head
injury) were considered to be confounding factors that might influence both lifestyle factors
and cognitive function [7,23,24].
Statistical analysis
The proportion of missing data was small (4%); instances of missing data are documented in
Table 1. Comparison of individuals with complete data and those with missing data showed
no significant difference in cognitive function. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investi-
gate the associations in multiple imputation datasets. Distributions were examined prior to
finalising the analysis plan. Additional information including results of the sensitivity analysis
may be found in the supplemental file (S1 Text).
Linear regression modelling was used to investigate the overall associations between each
lifestyle factor and cognitive function adjusting for demographic factors and chronic conditions.

 Since the five lifestyle factors were likely to be correlated, a full model that included all lifestyle
factors and covariates was tested.
Mediation analysis was used to investigate the mechanisms underlying observed relation-
ships between exposures and outcomes and to examine additional variables hypothesised to be
on the causal pathway [22, 23]. Based on the results for the overall associations, the measure
of smoking was recategorized into two groups (current versus exsmokers/never) in the media-
tion analysis. The frequency of alcohol consumption was treated as a continuous variable, and
the “trend” (changes in cognitive function per increase in frequency level) was tested in the
mediation analysis. To investigate the potential mediating effect of cognitive reserve on the
association between lifestyle factors and cognitive function, three pathways (a, b, and c) were
estimated using linear regression modelling and adjusting for age, gender, and chronic condi-
tions (Fig 1) [25]. For each lifestyle factor, direct and indirect effects were calculated using the
STATA mediation analysis syntax (sgmediation) with bootstrapping confidence intervals [26].
The percentage of indirect pathways among the total effect was calculated to indicate the medi-
ating effect of cognitive reserve on the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive func-
tion. All the lifestyle factors were included in one regression model to explore the overall
indirect effect of cognitive reserve. Adjusted R-squared was used to indicate the proportion of
variance explained by the independent variables. All measures were standardised to provide
comparable coefficients across different lifestyle factors.
Results
Descriptive information for sociodemographic factors, cognitive function, chronic conditions,
and lifestyle factors is shown in Table 1. Among the 2,315 participants, the mean age was 74 y
(SD: 6.3), and 51% were women. The mean CAMCOG score was 93.4 (SD: 5.4; median: 94;
interquartile range (IQR): 7). The average score for cognitive reserve was 28.6 (SD: 6.8), with a
range between 9.7 and 62.0.
Table 2 reports the overall association between cognitive function and the potentially modi-
fiable lifestyle factors. Apart from smoking, all the lifestyle factors were significantly associated

 with cognitive function after adjusting for age, sex, and chronic conditions. Current smoking
had negative associations with cognitive function, but the differences did not achieve statistical
significance. As shown under model 3 in Table 2, people who reported higher levels of cogni-
tive and social activity (0.20; 95% CI 0.16–0.24), higher levels of physical activity (0.11; 95% CI
0.07–0.15), and healthier dietary patterns (0.13; 95% CI 0.09–0.17) had higher CAMCOG
scores. There was a dose-response relationship between cognitive function and frequency of
alcohol consumption, with regular light-to-moderate drinkers having higher average CAM-
COG scores (0.34; 95% CI 0.23–0.46) than abstainers. In the full model including all the life-
style factors (Model 4), significant associations with cognitive and social activity, physical
activity, healthy diet, and regular light-to-moderate alcohol consumption remained apparent,
but the effect sizes slightly reduced. The estimate of adjusted R-squared shows that including
all the lifestyle factors explained about 5% of the variation in cognitive function.
Table 3 reports estimates for the three paths a (association between lifestyle factors and cog-
nitive reserve), b (association between cognitive reserve and cognitive function), and c (associ-
ation between lifestyle factors and cognitive function), as well as the percentage of indirect
effect (a to b) among the overall associations. Dietary pattern had the strongest indirect effect
(0.05; 95% CI 0.04–0.06) compared to the other lifestyle factors; the indirect effect identified
ranged from 36% for diet to 15% for cognitive and social activity. Although smoking showed a
potential indirect effect (−0.05; 95% CI −0.09 to −0.02), the association between smoking and
cognitive function was not significant.
Four lifestyle factors—cognitive and social activity, physical activity, regular light-to-mod-
erate alcohol consumption, and healthy diet—had both direct (0.30; 95% CI 0.24–0.37) and
indirect (0.08; 95% CI 0.06–0.10) associations with cognitive function. The proportion of the
total (direct plus indirect) effect of the four lifestyle factors that was mediated by cognitive
reserve was 21% (0.08; 95% CI 0.06–0.10) (Fig 2A). This full model explained 20% (adjusted R-
square = 0.21) of the variation in cognitive function across the CFAS-Wales participants. Fig
2B and Fig 2C show the mediating effects of individual cognitive reserve components (years of

lifestyle factors. Although the results were similar to those for the combined cognitive reserve
score, the effect sizes for the indirect pathways were smaller in these models. The results of sen-
sitivity analysis from the imputed datasets were similar to the main analysis (S1 Text), and
therefore, the impact of missing data was small.
Discussion
This study investigated the potential mediating effect of cognitive reserve on the association
between cognitive function and potentially modifiable lifestyle factors through cross-sectional
analysis of data from a population-based cohort of older people in Wales. The hypothesis that
cognitive reserve plays a mediating role was largely supported. Cognitive and social activity,
physical activity, regular light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, and healthy diet were all pos-
itively associated with cognitive function and together accounted for 20% of the variance in
cognitive test scores. Smoking, however, was not associated with cognitive function. The
results of the mediation analysis showed that cognitive reserve, indexed by education and
occupational complexity, was an important mediator of the association between the four life-
style factors and cognition, with indirect effects via cognitive reserve contributing 21% of the
overall effect.
This study confirms the relevance of potentially modifiable lifestyle factors for cognition in
later life, and, in line with other reports, it emphasizes the possibilities this affords for support-
ing the maintenance of cognitive health [7,23,27]. Our results are consistent with previous
cross-sectional and longitudinal findings on cognitive and social activity. Cognitive activity
may reduce risk of dementia [28], while aspects of social engagement are associated with better
cognitive function in later life, and possibly with reduced risk of dementia [29]. Similarly,
most observational studies of the effects of physical activity on cognition show an association
between higher levels of physical activity and lower rates of cognitive decline or dementia
[28,30]. Our measure of healthy diet included fruit, vegetable, and fish intake. Research on

 healthy diets emphasizes the benefits of vegetable consumption and adherence to a Mediterra-
nean-style diet [31–33] as protective of cognitive health, although only oily fish consumption
was identified as significant in a systematic review of risk factors [7]. Our findings on alcohol
intake are similar to those of studies reporting that light-to-moderate alcohol intake is associ-
ated with lower risk than abstaining [34–36], although recent research suggests that while fre-
quent drinking earlier in life is significantly associated with increased risk compared to
infrequent drinking, abstaining is not [37]. Smoking, although commonly identified as a risk
factor, was not significantly associated with cognitive function in the present study after
adjusting for possible confounds.
This study also provides evidence that contributes to explaining the mechanisms underly-
ing the association between these lifestyle factors and cognition and supports the view that
cognitive reserve plays an important role in this relationship. Cognitive reserve increases resil-
ience against the effects of neuropathology and hence supports maintenance of function in
later life [11]. Cognitive reserve is not a static property but rather is thought to evolve through-
out the life course [12], and lifestyle choices may contribute to protecting older people against
cognitive decline and dementia by supporting the development, connectivity, and mainte-
nance of brain networks.
The study has several limitations that must be borne in mind. These are cross-sectional data,
and hence, we cannot infer causal relationships. Longitudinal follow-up may provide additional
information, while comparison of those with high and low cognitive reserve would indicate
whether there are differences in lifestyle that distinguish the two groups or alternatively whether
cognitive reserve counteracts the effects of a less active cognitive lifestyle. Evaluating these rela-
tionships is particularly complex because lifestyle factors such as past engagement in cognitive
and social activity may have influenced and contributed to current levels of cognitive reserve.
Indeed, some approaches to assessing cognitive reserve include evaluation not only of past but
also of current engagement in such activities as part of the proxy cognitive reserve measure [15].
Conceptually, therefore, cognitive lifestyle and cognitive reserve become difficult to distinguish,
and this creates challenges for understanding the mechanisms underlying observed associations.
We addressed this possible circularity by using only educational level and occupational com-
plexity, two aspects of past experience likely to be relatively stable, in our combined measure of
cognitive reserve. As a latent construct, cognitive reserve is difficult to assess accurately, and
while evidence suggests that combined proxy measures are more appropriate than single indica-
tors such as educational level, there is as yet no consensus about an optimal approach to mea-
surement. The two indicators we used might be subject to reporting or recall bias or, in the case
of occupation, influenced by changing circumstances. Our proxy measure was, therefore, a rela-
tively crude measure. The implication of this is that our findings are likely if anything to under-
estimate the relationship of cognitive reserve to cognitive function and the extent to which
cognitive reserve mediates the association between lifestyle and cognitive function. However,
there is a need for greater clarity and consensus about the contributors to and measurement of
cognitive reserve and for enhanced study designs that can truly tease out the complexities of the
associations between lifestyle factors, cognitive reserve, and cognition.
We excluded people with cognitive impairment to reduce the risk of reverse causality, but it
is important to remember that people in the very early stages of cognitive decline may with-
draw from social contacts and other types of activity and may change dietary and other habits.
Therefore, the potential effects of reverse causality cannot be completely ruled out. Assessment
of lifestyle factors was based on self-report during interview and could be subject to bias. In
relation to alcohol consumption, the absence of self-reports of heavy drinking or concerns
about alcohol in the CFAS-Wales sample in particular might raise questions about possible
bias, but it is important to note that only three participants (0.1%) were considered by the

 interviewer to have a possible drinking problem. Assessment of cognitive function was limited
to a global score, and a more fine-grained neuropsychological assessment might reveal more
specific associations with particular aspects of cognitive function. There were some missing
data, but the extent of this was small and is unlikely to have influenced the findings. Despite

 these limitations, the particular strength of the study is that it draws on data from a large con-
temporary population-based cohort of older people in the UK.
Conclusions
The findings of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that significant associations
between four potentially modifiable lifestyle factors—cognitive and social activity, physical
activity, healthy diet, and regular light-to-moderate alcohol consumption—and cognition in
later life are mediated by level of cognitive reserve. As these findings are derived from cross-
sectional data, confirmation from longitudinal analyses will be required. However, these find-
ings provide support for the possibility that enhancing cognitive reserve throughout the life-
span, and encouraging participation in cognitive, social, and physical activity and a healthy
diet, may help maintain cognitive health in later life.
