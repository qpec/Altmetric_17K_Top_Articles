Sleep control is ascribed to a two-process model, a widely accepted concept that posits
homoeostatic drive and a circadian process as the major sleep-regulating factors. Cognitive
and emotional factors also influence sleep–wake behaviour; however, the precise circuit
mechanisms underlying their effects on sleep control are unknown. Previous studies suggest
that adenosine has a role affecting behavioural arousal in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a
brain area critical for reinforcement and reward. Here, we show that chemogenetic or
optogenetic activation of excitatory adenosine A2A receptor-expressing indirect pathway
neurons in the core region of the NAc strongly induces slow-wave sleep. Chemogenetic
inhibition of the NAc indirect pathway neurons prevents the sleep induction, but does not
affect the homoeostatic sleep rebound. In addition, motivational stimuli inhibit the activity of
ventral pallidum-projecting NAc indirect pathway neurons and suppress sleep. Our findings
reveal a prominent contribution of this indirect pathway to sleep control associated with
motivation.

irtually all living organisms with a nervous system, ran-
ging from worms to humans, exhibit sleep or sleep-like
behaviour as a neurological function1, 2. Sleep regulation is
conceptualised by the popular “two-process” model that posits
homoeostatic and circadian drives control sleep3. The homoeo-
static process is controlled by sleep pressure, which accumulates
during the course of wakefulness and dissipates during sleep. In
addition, the sleep–wake cycle during the day and night is
regulated by a circadian process that is independent of prior sleep
or wake time and is controlled by an internal biological clock
located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus deep within the brain.
Sleep/wake behaviour, however, is also influenced by cognitive
and emotional factors4–6. Humans often defy sleepiness and stay
awake when attention is necessary, but also experience an ines-
capable desire to sleep during boring situations. The mechanisms
by which motivational stimuli interact with sleep/wake behaviour
are not accounted for by the two-process model and the brain
mechanisms governing the regulation of sleep by cognitive and
emotional factors are largely unknown.
Neural systems that promote sleep have been identified in the
brainstem and basal forebrain7, 8. Animals with lesions of these
brain areas, however, still sleep a significant amount9–11, sug-
gesting the existence of other sleep-inducing circuitry. Pharma-
cological
studies12–14
suggest
that
the
classic
endogenous
somnogen adenosine15, 16 affects behavioural arousal via excita-
tory adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) on neurons in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), a part of the brain that is associated with
motivation, pleasure, and positive reinforcement17,
18. The
mechanism by which these neurons play a key role in the control
of sleep, however, is unknown.
In the present study, we demonstrate that selective activation of
A2AR-expressing NAc neurons strongly induced sleep behaviour
in mice, whereas inhibition of these neurons suppressed sleep.
Based on optogenetic and anterograde-tracing experiments,
we found that the core subdivision of the NAc and the ventral
pallidum (VP) in the basal forebrain are key areas involved in
generating sleep. Homoeostatic sleep pressure produced by sleep
deprivation did not change the neuronal activity of NAc core
A2AR neurons projecting to the VP based on immunohisto-
chemical analysis of c-Fos expression. By contrast, typical
motivational stimuli attenuated the activity of these neurons and
reduced sleep amount. These data reveal the sleep-inducing role
of NAc that is regulated by motivational factors.
Results
Chemogenetic activation of NAc A2AR neurons increases sleep.
We first used a chemogenetic approach to clarify the neurobe-
havioural and electroencephalographic outcomes of activating
A2AR-expressing indirect pathway neurons in the NAc. To target
excitatory “designer receptors exclusively activated by designer
drugs” (DREADD)19 in A2AR neurons located in the NAc, we
used transgenic mice in which Cre-recombinase was expressed
under the A2AR promoter (A2AR-Cre)20, 21. Adeno-associated
viral
vectors
(AAV)
carrying
Cre-recombinase-dependent
hM3Dq
DREADD
(AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry)
were
stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the NAc of A2AR-Cre mice
(NAc-hM3Dq mice; Fig. 1a, b). To investigate the effect of NAc
A2AR neuron stimulation on behavioural activity, we measured
locomotor activity after intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or
clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a hM3Dq ligand that evokes neuronal
excitation. Locomotor activity was decreased in NAc-hM3Dq
mice for 5 h after the administration of CNO at 20:00, i.e., at the
beginning of the dark period when mice usually show high levels
of arousal (Fig. 1c). We then analysed electroencephalogram
(EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings made after vehicle
or CNO injections at 20:00 to measure sleep. Compared with
vehicle injection, injection of CNO led to a dose-dependent and 3
h-long increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is also known as
non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, the major part of
sleep characterised by slow and high-voltage brain waves (Fig. 1d, e
and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The number of prolonged SWS
episodes (duration between 120–470 s) was also significantly
increased (Fig. 1f). Changes in the mean episode number of
wakefulness and SWS, and the number of stage transitions from
wakefulness to SWS or from SWS to wakefulness did not differ
significantly between mice treated with vehicle or CNO for 3 h
after the intraperitoneal injection, as assessed by paired Student’s
t-test (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). To assess whether EEG activity
was altered by chemogenetic activation, we compared the nor-
malised EEG power spectrum of SWS in NAc-hM3Dq mice at
baseline (1 day prior to vehicle injection) and after treatment with
vehicle or CNO, and in A2AR-Cre mice without AAV injections
at baseline (Fig. 1g). The EEG activity in the frequency range of
0.5–25 Hz during SWS was indistinguishable between chemo-
genetically induced and natural (baseline or vehicle treatment)
sleep. We also compared the absolute EEG power spectrum of
SWS in each condition, but detected no statistical differences
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). Moreover, mice treated with vehicle and
CNO had similar SWS spindle frequency (Supplementary
Fig. 1e). These analyses suggest that the induced sleep was likely
physiological sleep rather than abnormal sleep.
Optogenetic activation of NAc A2AR neurons induces SWS. We
then
used
optogenetic
stimulation
of
channelrhodopsin-2
(ChR2), a blue-light-gated cation channel, expressed in NAc
A2AR neurons to further explore the temporal properties of sleep
responses evoked by activating A2AR neurons in the NAc. After
AAV carrying Cre-dependent ChR2 (AAV-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-
mCherry) was stereotaxically injected into the NAc of A2AR-Cre
mice (NAc-ChR2 mice; Fig. 2a, b), we performed whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings of acutely prepared tissue slices con-
taining the NAc (Fig. 2c–i) to test the response of ChR2-
expressing neurons, presumably A2AR neurons, to optogenetic
stimulation. Brief pulses of light (5–15 ms) evoked single action
potentials in ChR2-expressing A2AR neurons, whereas pulses
longer than 15 ms resulted in two spikes (Fig. 2f, g). Light pulses
evoked action potentials with high frequency fidelity between 1
Hz and 30 Hz (Fig. 2h, i). We then stimulated the NAc in vivo in
NAc-ChR2 mice with 5-ms pulses of blue light in the frequency
range of 5–40 Hz at 22:00 when the mice were awake. The latency
to sleep onset, defined as the time from the first light pulse to the
appearance of the first SWS episode lasting longer than 20 s, was
dependent on the pulse frequency as well as on whether the
stimulation was unilateral or bilateral, with NAc-ChR2 mice
showing the shortest sleep latency when stimulated bilaterally at
20 Hz (Fig. 2j and Supplementary Movies 1, 2). Photostimulation
at 20 Hz induced profound SWS, resulting in more than 80%
SWS during the illumination period between 22:00 and 23:00
(Figs. 2k–m). After the last light pulse, NAc-ChR2 mice exhibited
a significant rebound in wakefulness over the next hour compared
with A2AR-Cre mice injected with AAV expressing only mCherry
(NAc-mCherry mice; Fig. 2l, m). The mice essentially behaved
normally during the hour after photostimulation (Supplementary
Fig. 2). We used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute brain
slices to confirm that optical stimulation of ChR2-expressing
A2AR neurons at 20 Hz evoked action potentials during a 1-h
period (Supplementary Fig. 3). The optogenetically induced firing
was sustained at 20 Hz during the initial 5−15 min, depending on
the individual neuron, and then progressively decreased to 3.0 ±
1.8 Hz after 1-h stimulation.

 A strong shift to prolonged SWS episodes with a duration of
60 s or more was observed in NAc-ChR2 mice (Fig. 2n), resulting
in a large increase in the mean duration of SWS episodes
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of
A2AR neurons in the NAc significantly increased the mean
number of SWS episodes and the number of wake-to-SWS or
SWS-to-wake transitions (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). The EEG
activity in the frequency range of 0.5–25 Hz during SWS episodes
was indistinguishable between NAc-ChR2 and NAc-mCherry
mice with photostimulation at 20 Hz (Fig. 2o and Supplementary
Fig. 4d) as well as between NAc-ChR2 mice with no, 5-Hz, or 10-Hz
photostimulation (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Moreover, the number
of SWS spindles during photostimulation was similar between
NAc-ChR2 and NAc-mCherry mice (Supplementary Fig. 4f).
These data suggest that optogenetic activation of A2AR neurons in
the NAc induced physiological sleep rather than abnormal sleep.
Activation of NAc core A2AR neurons induces SWS. The two
components of the NAc, the core and the shell, have anatomically
and functionally distinct projections to the forebrain, dience-
phalon and brainstem22–24. We therefore examined whether sleep
is
differentially affected by specific
stimulation of ChR2-
expressing neurons in the core or shell. We unilaterally injected
AAV-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-mCherry into the NAc core or shell of
A2AR-Cre mice and examined the effect of photostimulation on
SWS between 22:00 and 23:00. Typical examples of EEG, EMG
and hypnograms from mice in the ‘no light’ or ‘light’ conditions
are shown in Fig. 3a, b. Photostimulation of ChR2 in A2AR
neurons in the NAc core strongly increased SWS by 2.9-fold, as
compared to the baseline amount of sleep in mice without light
stimulation between 22:00 and 23:00 (Fig. 3a, c, d), while SWS
was not changed by photostimulation of neurons in the NAc core
that expressed only mCherry (Fig. 3f). In contrast, SWS tended to
be reduced when only A2AR neurons of the medial portion of the

NAc A2AR neurons are thought to release the neurotransmitter
γ-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) upon activation and may thus
induce sleep by inhibiting postsynaptic targets. Brain sections of
A2AR-Cre mice injected with AAV-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-mCherry
into the NAc core that were stained with an antibody against
mCherry revealed that ChR2-mCherry-expressing core neurons
heavily innervated the VP (Fig. 3g). These neurons also made
sparse to moderate projections to well-known arousal-promoting
areas, such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which produces
orexin; the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), which produces
histamine;
and
the
ventral
tegmental
area
(VTA),
which
produces dopamine (Fig. 3h–j). We therefore determined the
extent to which the VP, LH, TMN and VTA contribute to the

 sleep control mediated by the NAc core. We first performed
whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in acute slices to test the
responses to optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-expressing NAc
core terminals in the VP (Fig. 4a–e). Stimulation (5-ms pulses,
10 Hz) of the NAc core terminals decreased the firing rate and
evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) in most of the
recorded VP neurons (Fig. 4b–e and Supplementary Fig. 5a–d),
while no such responses were observed in the LH, TMN or VTA
(Fig. 4e), possibly due to the low density of synaptic connections
on hypothalamic (i.e., LH and TMN) and midbrain VTA
neurons. These findings suggest prominent functional synaptic
connectivity between the ChR2-expressing NAc core and VP
neurons.
Next, we examined the effects of photostimulation of ChR2-
expressing NAc core terminals in the VP, LH, TMN or VTA on
sleep/wake behaviour in A2AR-Cre mice. Light stimulation for 1 h
in the VP portion containing ChR2-expressing NAc core
terminals remarkably increased SWS by 4.0-fold (Fig. 4f, g), an
effect
that
was
similar
to
the
SWS
increase
evoked
by
photostimulation of cell bodies in the NAc core (Fig. 3d),
although stimulation of ChR2-expressing NAc core terminals in
the LH, TMN or VTA did not induce significant changes in SWS
(Fig. 4g). IPSC recordings of VP neurons in acute brain slices
during 1-h photostimulation revealed that the IPSC frequency
was 4.8-fold higher than the baseline at the onset of photo-
stimulation, but returned to the baseline level after 40–50 min
(Supplementary Fig. 5e–g). Because the distance between the
AAV injection site in the NAc and photostimulation site in the
VP is only 0.8 mm, it is conceivable that the changes in SWS
resulted from photostimulation of ChR2 in the NAc core cell
bodies rather than their axonal terminals in the VP. Hence, we
also stimulated an area in the olfactory tubercle 0.8 mm anterior
to the NAc core, which served as an anatomical control site. The
amount of SWS sleep, however, remained unchanged (P > 0.05,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 4; Fig. 4g). To exclude the
possibility that VP terminal stimulation increased SWS by
antidromic activation of the NAc core cell bodies, we unilaterally
lesioned VP cells using the neurotoxin ibotenic acid in mice
expressing ChR2 in the ipsilateral NAc core (Fig. 4h, left panel).
Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing NAc terminals in the VP of
those mice (Fig. 4h, right panel) did not affect SWS (Fig. 4i),
indicating that the VP is necessary for inducing SWS. Optical
stimulation of ChR2 in NAc A2AR neurons also evoked IPSC in
NAc neurons that did not express ChR2 (Supplementary
Fig. 6a–d). This observation may indicate collateral innervation
between NAc neurons25, which likely include VP-projecting
GABAergic neurons of the direct pathway26. GABAergic neurons
are the main neuronal population in the VP27 and therefore, we
tested whether disinhibition of these neurons induces SWS. We
chemogenetically activated VP GABAergic neurons using AAV-
mediated expression of DREADD hM3Dq in mice expressing
Cre-recombinase under the promoter of the glutamate decarbox-
ylase 2 (Gad2) gene which is expressed in neurons that use GABA
as
a
neurotransmitter,
to
catalyse
the
decarboxylation
of
glutamate to GABA (Supplementary Fig. 6e, f). The total amount
of SWS, however, was suppressed for 3 h after administering
1 mg kg−1 CNO to VP-hM3Dq mice, suggesting that SWS is not
likely to be induced after disinhibition of VP neurons, for
example, by inhibiting VP-projecting GABAergic NAc neurons.
NAc core A2AR neurons are necessary for SWS. To examine the
necessity of NAc core A2AR neurons for physiological sleep/wake
behaviour, we chemogenetically inhibited these neurons using
AAV-mediated expression of inhibitory DREADD hM4Di, which
suppresses neuronal activity when CNO is applied19, in the NAc
core of A2AR-Cre mice (NAc-hM4Di mice; Fig. 5a, b). We
intraperitoneally administered CNO in NAc-hM4Di mice at
20:00, and CNO dose-dependently reduced SWS for up to 4 h
(Fig. 5c, d). The total amount of SWS was suppressed by 80% for
4 h with the highest dose of CNO (i.e., 0.3 mg kg−1) compared to
vehicle treatment (Fig. 5d). The number of SWS episodes was
decreased for 4 h after CNO administration (Fig. 5e), whereas the
mean duration of SWS was not changed (Fig. 5f). These results
suggest that NAc core A2AR neuron activity is necessary to induce
SWS under baseline conditions. Moreover, we investigated animal
behaviours for over 1 h after CNO administration (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7) and found that CNO significantly increased foraging
behaviour (including digging and sniffing) compared to vehicle
treatment. CNO administration tended to decrease other beha-
viours, such as grooming and eating, but the difference did not
reach statistical significance (P = 0.084 for grooming, P = 0.35 for
eating, mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Bonferroni’s test, n = 6).
We also examined the role of NAc core A2AR neurons for the
homoeostatic sleep rebound after sleep deprivation by adminis-
tering vehicle or CNO to NAc-hM4Di mice kept awake for 4 h
prior to the drug treatment at 20:00. We observed that vehicle-
and CNO-treated mice had a significant SWS rebound during the
7 h after sleep deprivation and that the CNO-induced decrease of
SWS was similar in sleep-deprived and non-sleep-deprived
animals during the same period (Fig. 5g). Two-way repeated
measures ANOVA revealed no statistically significant interaction
between sleep deprivation and CNO treatment (F(1,5) = 1.53,
P = 0.272, n = 6). Moreover, the amount of SWS rebound after
sleep deprivation or CNO-induced SWS reduction during 7 h was

 not affected by CNO treatment or sleep deprivation, respectively
(Fig. 5h, i). These results suggest that the ability of NAc core
A2AR neurons to induce sleep is independent of homoeostatic
sleep pressure.
Motivational stimuli suppress NAc neuron activity. Finally, we
investigated the patterns of spontaneous activity of the indirect
NAc core-VP pathway under various conditions of sleep and
motivation using immunohistochemical examination of the
expression of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in mice
injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit b (CTb)
into the VP (Fig. 6a, b). Mice that were killed during the light
phase at 12:00 spent more time (95 ± 4.1 min) asleep during the
3 h prior to tissue collection than mice that were killed during the
dark phase at 24:00 when they slept 54 ± 6.2 min during the 3 h
prior to tissue collection (Fig. 6d). Triple labelling for c-Fos,
A2AR, and CTb (Fig. 6c) revealed that mice killed during the day
had a markedly increased number of VP-projecting NAc core
A2AR neurons expressing c-Fos (37 ± 5.0%) compared to mice
that were killed during the night with c-Fos expression in
20 ± 2.0% of VP-projecting NAc core A2AR neurons (Fig. 6e). To
determine the role of homoeostatic sleep factors on the activity of
the indirect NAc core-VP pathway, we deprived mice of sleep for

projecting NAc core A2AR neurons of sleep-deprived mice was
not different from that in non-sleep-deprived mice (Fig. 6g),
however, suggesting that homoeostatic sleep pressure does not

This observation is consistent with our finding that chemogenetic
inhibition NAc core A2AR neurons did not affect sleep rebound

 brain area for motivational behaviour17, 18, we also examined
SWS amount and activity of VP-projecting NAc core A2AR
neurons in the presence of motivational stimuli (e.g., toy, female
mouse or chocolate) or stimuli that are unlikely associated with
motivational behaviour (e.g., regular chow or bedding). The
amount of SWS in mice was significantly lower in the presence of
motivational stimuli compared to mice with non-motivational
stimuli (Fig. 6h). Moreover, the number of NAc core neurons
triple-labelled for c-Fos, A2AR and CTb was lower in male
mice that spent time with a toy, a female mouse, or chocolate
compared to mice in the presence of non-motivational stimuli
(Fig. 6i). These results suggest that motivational stimuli suppress
the activity of VP-projecting NAc core A2AR neurons and SWS.
Discussion
Although the VP is widely considered to be a component of the
basal ganglia, it occupies an area historically known as the sub-
commissural substantia innominata of the basal forebrain28. The
basal forebrain contains intermingled GABAergic, cholinergic

 and glutamatergic cell groups, with GABAergic neurons com-
prising the largest population of nerve cells. Recent findings
revealed a major contribution of GABAergic neurons to wake-
fulness29. Using chemogenetic experiments, Anaclet et al.29
demonstrated that activating GABAergic neurons in the basal
forebrain, which includes the VP, produces wakefulness, whereas
inhibition increases sleep. Therefore, it appears that the NAc core
produces sleep by inhibiting VP GABAergic neurons. The cir-
cuitry by which basal forebrain GABAergic neurons, including
the VP neurons, regulate sleep and wakefulness remains largely
unresolved. A plausible explanation is that basal forebrain
GABAergic neurons inhibit cortical GABAergic interneurons or
deep layer pyramidal cells30, 31 and thus, induce wakefulness by
disinhibiting the cerebral cortex.
In addition to the excitatory afferents to neurons of the indirect
pathway in the NAc, adenosine is an obvious candidate for
activating NAc core neurons because sufficient levels of adeno-
sine, a well-described endogenous somnogen15, are available
under basal conditions and excitatory A2AR are abundantly
expressed in the NAc32, 33. The tonic sleep drive by neurons in
the NAc core may be inhibited by ongoing cognitive and emo-
tional stimuli, but in the absence of such stimuli may allow the
brain to fall asleep by further depressing arousal circuit activity in
the basal forebrain. The reduced activity in the arousal systems
would then release the ventrolateral preoptic sleep-promoting
neurons from inhibition, further promoting sleep. This inter-
pretation is consistent with previous work13 showing that injec-
tions of an A2AR agonist into the preoptic region induces sleep
accompanied by c-Fos expression in both ventral striatal neurons
and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, despite the lack of A2AR in
the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus.
Caffeine, the most widely consumed wake-promoting psy-
chostimulant in the world, is a nonselective adenosine receptor
antagonist34 and at least in rats, mainly produces its arousal effect
through A2AR in the NAc shell14, 35. Our data, however, indicate
that optogenetic activation of the NAc shell does not induce SWS.
As there are functional differences between the NAc shell and
core in mediating reward behaviour22, 36, 37, it is possible that the

 two structures also have different functions for sleep–wake reg-
ulation. Caffeine appears to produce behavioural activity that
induces wakefulness by blocking adenosine at A2AR on NAc shell
neurons, while activation of NAc core neurons can induce sleep.
The neuronal and molecular bases of the need for sleep or,
alternatively, the homoeostatic sleep drive remain unresolved.
One potential mechanism is that the gradual accumulation of one
or
more
endogenous
somnogenic
factors,
including
pros-
taglandins, cytokines and adenosine, during wake underlies the
propensity for homoeostatic sleep38. We demonstrated that the
homoeostatic rebound response to restricted sleep is not regulated
by NAc A2AR neurons and thus other brain regions appear to
mediate the homoeostatic sleep pressure.
On the other hand, NAc A2AR neurons also express inhibitory
dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). Because VTA dopamine plays a
key role in reward and motivational behaviours17, 18, it is possible
that dopamine release from VTA neurons is the reason that
motivational stimuli inhibit NAc core A2AR neurons that project
to the VP and thus, suppress SWS by releasing VP cells from
inhibition. This notion is consistent with findings from recent
papers demonstrating an important role of dopaminergic VTA
neurons in promoting wakefulness39, 40. Moreover, chemogenetic
inhibition of NAc core A2AR/D2R neurons suppresses SWS while
promoting foraging, a typical motivational behaviour. Taken
together, these observations may suggest that the NAc is a key
area where sleep and behavioural responses to motivational sti-
muli are reciprocally regulated.
Methods
Genetic mouse model. We used two genetic mouse lines on a C57BL/6 back-
ground in which Cre-recombinase was expressed under the promoter of the A2AR
gene (A2AR-Cre mouse20) or Gad2 gene (Gad2-Cre mouse41). For behavioural
studies, male mice (8–20 weeks) weighing 25–35 g at the beginning of the
experiments were housed in insulated sound-proof recording chambers maintained
at an ambient temperature of 23 ± 1°C with a relative humidity of 60 ± 2% on an
automatically controlled 12-h light/dark cycle (light on at 8:00), and were provided
free access to food and water. The numbers of mice used in each experiment were
selected based on the expected variations between animals and variability in AAV
microinjections. No method of randomisation or blinding was used in any of the
experiments. Mice were housed individually after AAV injections. All experiments
were performed in accordance with the Animal Care Committee of the University
of Tsukuba and Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, and the National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and every
effort was made to minimise the number of animals used, as well as any pain and
discomfort.
Plasmids. The plasmids pAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry42, pAAV-hSyn-DIO-
hM4Di-mCherry42 and pAAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry43 were kindly
provided by Dr. Bryan Roth (University of North Carolina School of Medicine,
Chapel Hill, NC, USA) and Dr. Karl Deisseroth (Stanford University, Stanford, CA,
USA), respectively. To generate the pAAV-EF1α-DIO-mCherry plasmid, the
hChR2(H134R)-mCherry fragment between AscI and NheI restriction sites in
pAAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry was replaced by a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-amplified fragment containing the mCherry coding sequence.
AAV generation. The AAV of serotype rh10 for AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry
(AAV-M3-DREADD), AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry (AAV-M4-DREADD),
AAV-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-mCherry (AAV-ChR2) and AAV-EF1α-DIO-mCherry
(AAV-mCherry) were generated by tripartite transfection (AAV-rep2/caprh10
expression plasmid, adenovirus helper plasmid, and pAAV plasmid) into 293A
cells. After 3 days, the 293A cells were resuspended in artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(aCSF), freeze-thawed four times, and treated with benzonase nuclease (Millipore)
to degrade all forms of DNA and RNA. Subsequently, the cell debris was removed
by centrifugation and the virus titre in the supernatant was determined using an
AAVpro Titration Kit for Real Time PCR (Takara).
Surgery. Surgeries for brain microinjections were conducted under pentobarbital
anaesthesia (60 mg kg−1, intraperitoneal (i.p.)). Using aseptic techniques, the mice
were injected stereotaxically into the NAc with recombinant AAV-M3-DREADD
(250 nl per injection, 1.1 × 1011 particles ml−1), AAV-M4-DREADD (250 nl per
injection, 1.1 × 1011 particles ml−1), AAV-ChR2 (250 nl per injection, 1.4 × 1011
particles ml−1) or AAV-mCherry (250 nl per injection, 2.4 × 1011 particles ml−1)
with a glass micropipette and an air pressure injector system44. The following
coordinates were used for injections into the NAc of A2AR-Cre according to the
atlas of Paxinos and Franklin45. For AAV-ChR2, unilateral or bilateral injections
were made at 1.2 mm anterior and 0.7–1.3 mm lateral (core/shell: 1.0 mm; core: 1.3
mm; shell: 0.7 mm) to bregma and 4.0 mm below the dura, and for AAV-M3-
DREADD, bilateral injections were made 1.3 mm anterior and 1.0 mm lateral to
bregma, and 4.0 mm below the dura. For AAV-M4-DREADD, bilateral injections
were made 1.2 mm anterior and 1.3 mm lateral to bregma and 4.0 mm below the
dural surface. For VP cell lesions or retrograde NAc labelling, mice were uni-
laterally injected into the VP (0.4 mm anterior and 1.3 mm lateral to bregma, 4.3
mm below the dura) with 5% ibotenic acid (30 nl per injection; Tocris, 0285) or
0.2% CTb (18 nl per injection; List Biological, Cat# 104), respectively. For che-
mogenetic activation of the VP, AAV-M3-DREADD was bilaterally injected into
the VP (0.4 mm anterior and 1.3 mm lateral to bregma, 4.3 mm below the dura) in
Gad2-Cre mice.
For optogenetic NAc cell-body stimulation, a stainless-steel cannula (700 μm
diameter) was placed during surgery above the NAc located 1.2 mm anterior and
0.7–1.3 mm lateral (core/shell: 1.0 mm; core: 1.3 mm; shell: 0.7 mm) to bregma, and
3.0 mm below the dura, so that the tip of the optical fibre was projecting 1 mm
from the end of the cannula during light stimulation. For NAc terminal
stimulation, the stainless-steel cannula was placed in the olfactory tubercle: 2.0 mm
anterior and 1.1 mm lateral to bregma, 3.0 mm deep from the dura; VP: 0.4 mm
anterior and 1.3 mm lateral to bregma, 3.0 mm deep from the dura; LH: 1.4 mm
posterior and 0.9 mm lateral to bregma, 3.8 mm deep from the dura; TMN: 2.3 mm
posterior and 1.1 mm lateral to bregma, 4.3 mm deep from the dura; or VTA: 3.2
mm posterior and 0.3 mm lateral to bregma, 3.1 mm deep from the dura. Cannulas
were fixed on the skull using dental cement.
Mice were also chronically implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for
polysomnography, as previously described in ref. 46. Briefly, the implant comprised
two stainless-steel screws (1 mm diameter) serving as EEG electrodes, one of which
was placed epidurally over the right frontal cortex (1.0 mm anterior and 1.5 mm
lateral to bregma) and the other over the right parietal cortex (1.0 mm anterior and
1.5 mm lateral to lambda). Two insulated Teflon-coated, silver wires (0.2 mm in
diameter), which were placed bilaterally into the trapezius muscles, served as EMG
electrodes. Both EEG and EMG electrodes were connected to a microconnector,
and the whole assembly was then fixed to the skull with self-curing dental acrylic
resin.
Behavioural experiments. After 2−3 weeks for postoperative recovery and
transgene expression, the mice were placed in experimental cages for a 4-days
habituation/acclimatisation period and connected with recording leads. EEG/EMG
signals were recorded at baseline (i.e., sleep/wake behaviour of a freely behaving
mouse) and under different treatment conditions (i.e., chemogenetic and optoge-
netic stimulation) over a period of several days. For experiments with motivational
stimuli, male mice had free access to blocks (rectangular or triangular prisms; one
side was approximately 4 cm), a female C57BL/6 wild-type mouse (10–15 weeks
old), milk chocolate (one Hershey’s Kiss; Hershey), a few pieces of fresh regular
chow, or a pinch of new bedding from 10:00 until the animals were killed.
For DREADD experiments, all A2AR-Cre and Gad2-Cre mice were injected
with vehicle or CNO (Sigma, C0832) at 20:00 (A2AR-Cre mice) and 9:00 (Gad2-Cre
mice) for 2 consecutive days. On day 1, mice were treated with vehicle (saline, i.p.)
and on day 2, mice were treated with CNO (i.p.). For sleep deprivation
experiments, mice were kept awake by cage tapping and exposure to novel objects
for 4 h prior to the dark period and treated with vehicle or CNO at the end of the
sleep deprivation (20:00). Mice were awake for 99.6 ± 0.1% of the time during sleep
deprivation. SWS rebound was calculated based on the difference between SWS
amount from 20:00 to 3:00 in the same animal with and without sleep deprivation.
For optogenetic stimulation, blue light (475 nm) was generated by a RETRA
light engine (Lumencor) and applied through optical fibres (Lucir, 500 μm
diameter). A pulse generator (Grass-Natus Neurology Incorporated) was used to
control the duration and frequency of the light pulses. Fibre-optic rotary joints
(Lucir) were used for unrestricted in vivo illumination. Blue light power intensity at
the tip of the plastic fibre was ~15 mW mm−2, measured by a power metre.
For the c-Fos experiments, we placed mice in experimental cages for a 2−3-day-
habituation period before killing under the following conditions. (1) Mice were
killed during daytime at 12:00 or night at 24:00. (2) Mice were killed at 20:00 after
4-h sleep deprivation or undisturbed sleep–wake behaviour. (3) Mice were killed 2
h after introduction of motivational or non-motivational stimuli at 10:00.
Vigilance state assessment. The EEG/EMG signals were amplified and filtered
(EEG: 0.5–64 Hz, EMG: 16–64 Hz), then digitised at a sampling rate of 128 Hz, and
recorded using SLEEPSIGN software47 (Kissei Comtec). In addition, locomotor
activity was recorded with an infrared photocell sensor (Biotex). The vigilance
states were scored offline by characterising 10-s epochs into three stages, including
awake, SWS and REM sleep, according to standard criteria46. As a final step,
defined vigilance stages were examined visually, and corrected when necessary.
Spindles during SWS were analysed as previously reported48. In brief, EEG was
bandpass-filtered (10–13 Hz) to visually identify sleep spindles from the raw EEG
signals.

 Behavioural analysis. Animal behaviours after photostimulation or CNO injec-
tions were analysed using video recordings as described in a previous report49.
Briefly, behaviours during wakefulness were scored in 4-s epochs as grooming,
foraging (including digging and sniffing), rearing, eating, drinking, ambulation or
quiet waking, when the behaviour accounted for more than 50% of the epoch.
Patch-clamp electrophysiology. A2AR-Cre mice were injected with AAV-ChR2
and after 21 days, then anaesthetised and perfused transcardially with modified
aCSF containing 213 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM
NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM Na-pyruvate, 0.4 mM ascorbic acid, 3 mM MgSO4
and 0.1 mM CaCl2, and saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Coronal brain sections
(NAc, VP, LH, etc., thickness: 300 µm) were cut on a vibratome (VT 1200 S, Leica)
and transferred to normal aCSF containing 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM
NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 25 mM glucose.
Slices were incubated at 32 °C for 30 min and subsequently maintained at room
temperature for 30 min before recording. Patch electrodes had a resistance of 4–5
MΩ with an internal solution containing 105 mM potassium gluconate, 30 mM
KCl, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.3 mM EGTA, 0.3 mM GTP-Na,
and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3, 295–310 mOsm). Cell-attached and whole-cell cur-
rent-clamp and voltage-clamp (held at –70 mV) recordings were made at 30–32 °C
using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Signals were filtered at 4
kHz and digitised at 10 kHz with a DigiData 1440 A (Axon Instruments). Data
were acquired and analysed with pClamp10.3 software (Axon Instruments). ChR2
was stimulated by 470-nm light (5-ms pulses, 1–100 Hz) delivered via an optical
fibre coupled to a laser source (OEM Laser Systems). The end of the optical fibre
was placed 300 μm above the recorded cell. When needed, 25 μM d-(−)-2-amino-5-
phosphonopentanoic acid (d-APV), 5 μM NBQX, and 100 μM picrotoxin were
added into the aCSF to block NMDA, AMPA and GABAA receptors, respectively.
Series resistance compensation was not used, and thus cells with series resistance
changes over 25% were discarded.
Histology. Animals were deeply anaesthetised with an overdose of chloral hydrate
(500 mg kg−1, i.p.) and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with saline
followed by neutral buffered 10% formalin. Brains were removed and placed in
20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C to reduce
freezing artefact. The brains were then frozen on dry ice and sectioned at 30–40 µm
on a freezing microtome.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on free-floating sections as described
previously14. In brief, sections were rinsed in PBS, incubated in 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then sequentially at room
temperature in 3% normal donkey serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBT)
for 1 h and primary antibody diluted in PBT with 0.02% sodium azide overnight.
After overnight incubation with rabbit anti-DsRed antibodies (1:10,000; Clontech,
Cat# 632496), mouse anti-NeuN antibodies (1:2000; Millipore, Cat# MAB377) or
goat anti-CTb antibody (1:15,000; List Biological, Cat# 703), sections were rinsed
and incubated for 2 h in biotinylated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a
dilution of 1:1000. All tissue sections were then treated with avidin-biotin complex
(1:1000; Vectastain ABC Elite kit, Vector Labs) for 1 h, and immunoreactive
cells were visualised by reaction with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.01%
hydrogen peroxide. Tissue sections mounted on glass slides were scanned with a
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer-XR Digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics),
and digital photomicrographs were analysed with Hamamatsu NDPView software
v2.4.26.
For in situ hybridisation, we generated a 476-bp riboprobe for A2AR mRNA
based on sequences from the Allen brain atlas (http://www.brain-map.org/).
Briefly, we amplified the probe fragment by PCR (forward, 5′-CACATCATCAACT
GCTTCACCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CATGAGGCTGTTCCTACCCTAC-3′ conjugated
with T7 promoter) using mouse brain cDNA as template followed by in vitro
transcription to make a digoxigenin-labelled antisense probe. Then, sections were
incubated with 1 μg ml−1 of the A2AR probe at 50 °C overnight, washed in saline
sodium citrate buffer, incubated with peroxidase conjugated anti-digoxigenin
antibody (1:250; Roche) overnight, and reacted with tyramide-conjugated Cy3
(PerkinElmer).
For triple labelling of c-Fos, A2AR mRNA and CTb, we first immunostained c-
Fos with rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (1:2000; Millipore, Cat# ABE457), peroxidase
conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and tyramide-
conjugated fluorescein (PerkinElmer). We then performed A2AR in situ
hybridisation as described above and finally visualised CTb immunoreactivity with
goat anti-CTb antibody (1:15,000), biotinylated anti-goat antibody (1:500; Jackson
ImmunoResearch), and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated streptavidin (1:500;
Invitrogen). Images were analysed with a laser confocal microscope LSM730
(Carl Zeiss).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean and standard error of the
mean (SEM). Statistical comparisons between two groups were performed
using the paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. For t-tests, we established the normality of each dataset using the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Comparisons among multiple parameters were per-
formed by one-way, two-way or mixed model ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
post hoc comparisons. In all cases, P-values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.
