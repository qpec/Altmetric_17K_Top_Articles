Abstract
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that threatens over half of the world’s population.
Despite being endemic to more than 100 countries, government-led efforts and tools for
timely identification and tracking of new infections are still lacking in many affected areas.
Multiple methodologies that leverage the use of Internet-based data sources have been pro-
posed as a way to complement dengue surveillance efforts. Among these, dengue-related
Google search trends have been shown to correlate with dengue activity. We extend a
methodological framework, initially proposed and validated for flu surveillance, to produce
near real-time estimates of dengue cases in five countries/states: Mexico, Brazil, Thailand,
Singapore and Taiwan. Our result shows that our modeling framework can be used to
improve the tracking of dengue activity in multiple locations around the world.
Author summary
As communicable diseases spread in our societies, people frequently turn to the Internet
to search for medical information. In recent years, multiple research teams have investi-
gated how to utilize Internet users’ search activity to track infectious diseases around our
planet. In this article, we show that a methodology, originally developed to track flu in the
US, can be extended to improve dengue surveillance in multiple countries/states where
dengue has been observed in the last several years. Our result suggests that our methodol-
ogy performs best in dengue-endemic areas with high number of yearly cases and with
sustained seasonal incidence.
Introduction
Dengue fever poses a growing health and economic problem throughout the tropical and sub-
tropical world. Dengue is today one of the fastest-growing and most important mosquito-
borne viral diseases in the world, with an estimated 390 million infections each year and
threatening an estimated 3.9 billion people in 128 countries [1]. Infection often causes high

 fever and joint pain, and severe cases can lead to hemorrhage, shock and death. Dengue epi-
demics strain health services and lead to massive economic losses.
Dengue transmission is subject to complex environmental factors influencing the Aedes
aegypti and albopictus mosquitoes which spread the disease. A mosquito is able to transmit
dengue within a few weeks of contracting the virus, and a person bitten by such a mosquito
will usually fall ill within a week, with symptoms lasting for up to 10 days afterward [2, 3].
There is a 5-day window when another mosquito can pick up the virus from an infected per-
son [3]. The time scale of these transmission dynamics lends itself to tracking patterns of infec-
tion at a weekly or monthly level. Seasonal conditions such as temperature and precipitation
can affect mosquito feeding rate, development, and lifespan, contributing to annual seasonality
in observed dengue cases [4–8]. Other factors affecting the local or regional level include
human population density and mobility, mosquito control efforts, and the distribution of the
four dengue virus serotypes, adding complications to efforts to model transmission dynamics
[9, 10].
Dengue mortality and morbidity both need to be addressed to reduce this heavy burden.
The World Health Organization has called for better early case detection among other tactics
to reduce dengue mortality, and for the reduction of dengue morbidity through coordinating
epidemiological and entomological surveillance. Timely identification of outbreaks can inform
and help preventative measures to lower infection rates, including mosquito population con-
trol and providing supplies such as screens and nets for mosquito bite prevention. Thorough,
data-informed implementations of these vector control methods have been found effective in
reducing case counts in many locations, but require sustainable investment to prevent resur-
gence [3, 11], highlighting the need for accurate and timely dengue surveillance tools.
However, such a comprehensive, effective and reliable disease surveillance system for den-
gue is not yet available. Governments traditionally rely on hospital-based reporting, a method
that is often lagged and limited with frequent post-hoc revisions, due to communication ineffi-
ciencies across local and national agencies and the time needed to aggregate information from
the clinical to the state level [12, 13]. This lack of timely information limits the identification
and optimization of effective interventions. Measurement difficulties are compounded by the
fact that a majority of dengue cases are asymptomatic [14].
In this context, building an effective disease surveillance tool is essential to being able to
identify and assess the severity of dengue outbreaks and to enable better assessment of the
effectiveness of ongoing interventions. Such tools should provide accurate and consistent mea-
sures of regional or national infection levels, be updated in near real-time, and be immune to
bureaucratic or resource-related delays. To improve accuracy, these tools should use and link
together multiple sources of information, using both traditional and non-traditional sources.
Over the years, a broad range of traditional epidemiological methods have been proposed
by research teams to fill this time gap of information by supplementing official case counts
with now-cast estimation using dengue incidence data from previous seasons. Autoregressive
models, such as Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, that
take into account recent and seasonal patterns, have been shown to produce useful disease esti-
mates, some including additional variables such as concurrent weather information [15–19].
Other studies have further examined climate-driven models, finding associations of seasonal
and long-term weather patterns such as El Niño with dengue levels in various countries [5, 20–
22]. In addition, various mechanistic models on the dynamics of dengue transmission have
also been explored, with some recent promise [23]. A comprehensive survey of these methods
are given in Andraud et al. [24]
In parallel and complementary to the aforementioned methodologies, the global spread of
the Internet has opened up the opportunity to investigate whether users’ activity patterns on

 Internet search-engines and social media platforms may lead to reasonable estimates of dengue
infection levels [25–27]. In theory, Internet search tracking is consistent, efficient, and reflects
real-time population trends, giving it strong potential to supplement current epidemiological
methods [13, 28]. Studies have previously demonstrated the feasibility of using Internet search
data to track dengue case counts [25, 27]. Google Dengue Trends (GDT), launched in 2011,
was one of the first tools to quantitatively track dengue activity in multiple regions throughout
the world by leveraging the aggregate Google search patterns of millions of users [25]. Since its
start, the methodology behind GDT has been updated to address flaws found in its sister effort,
Google Flu Trends [29–37], before finally being discontinued in August 2015. An assessment
of GDT in Mexico showed mixed prediction accuracy compared to official case counts, with
strong correlation in some states [38].
Despite progress in the use of both dengue time-series information (time series
approaches [15]) and real-time Internet searches for dengue tracking [25], an approach for
accurate tracking of dengue by combining the respective strengths of each data source has
not been documented to the best of our knowledge. We extend a methodology recently
introduced in the flu surveillance literature to combine dengue-related Google searches with
dengue case count time-series to track dengue activity. Specifically, we evaluate the perfor-
mance of the ARGO model (AutoRegressive model with GOogle search queries as exogenous
variables), as introduced in [35], in tracking dengue in five countries/states around the
globe: Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan. These countries were chosen to
explore the applicability of our approach in a diverse set of ecological situations where den-
gue has been identified as an important local threat. Our contribution shows that the lessons
learned to track influenza in data-rich environments, like the United States, can be used to
develop methodologies to track an often-neglected tropical disease, dengue, in data-poor
environments.
Materials and methods
Data
We used two kinds of data sets for our study: (a) historical dengue incidence from govern-
ment-led health agencies and (b) Google search fractions of dengue-related queries, aggregated
at the national-level.
Dengue time-series data. Mexico. Monthly-aggregated dengue case counts data from Jan-
uary 2001 to August 2015 were obtained from Mexico’s Department of Epidemiology. http://
www.epidemiologia.salud.gob.mx/anuario/html/anuarios.html
Brazil. Monthly dengue case counts data from January 2001 to December 2012 were
obtained from the old website of Brazil’s Ministry of Health (http://dtr2004.saude.gov.br/
sinanweb/tabnet/dh?sinannet/dengue/bases/denguebrnet.def) on July 14, 2015. This site is no
longer accessible, since the Ministry has moved to a new website (http://portalsaude.saude.
gov.br/index.php/situacao-epidemiologica-dados-dengue), which now publishes weekly den-
gue data from 2014-present. This site contains annual dengue cases since 1990 but no longer
has the historical monthly data. We confirmed that the annual totals match the sum of case
counts over each year in our dataset.
Thailand. Monthly dengue case count data from January 2003 to August 2015 were
obtained from the Bureau of Epidemiology, Thailand (http://www.boe.moph.go.th/boedb/
surdata/disease.php?ds=66). New data are published in an annual document available on the
site.
Singapore. Weekly dengue case counts from January 10, 2004 to August 29, 2015
were obtained from the Singapore Ministry of Health and were aggregated into months.

Taiwan. Weekly dengue case counts from January 3, 2009 to March 19, 2016 were obtained
from the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare and were aggregated into months. http://
nidss.cdc.gov.tw/ch/SingleDisease.aspx?dc=1&dt=4&disease=061&position=1.
Online search volume data. Google search fractions for dengue-related queries were
obtained from Google Trends (www.google.com/trends).
Online search term selection.
While we initially intended to use Google Correlate (www.
google.com/correlate), which is designed to identify search terms correlating highly with a
given time series over a given country, we found this tool unreliable as many of the search
terms returned were not related at all to dengue. Consequently, we used the Google Trends
(www.google.com/trends) tool to identify the top ten queries most highly correlated with the
term ‘dengue’ in each country, ignoring terms unrelated to dengue (one feature of Google
Trends is that in addition to the trends of a specific term, it gives the top query terms that are
most highly correlated with the specific term). The monthly aggregated search fractions of
these terms were then downloaded within the time period of interest for each country. The
query terms used for each country in this study were later verified by native speakers of each
language and are presented in Table A in S1 Text.
Methods
We used the multivariate linear regression modeling framework ARGO (AutoRegressive
model with GOogle search queries as exogenous variables) [35], previously used to track flu
incidence using flu-related Google searches, to combine information from historical dengue
case counts and dengue-related Google search frequencies with the goal of estimating dengue
activity one month ahead of the publication of official local health reports. ARGO uses a train-
ing set that consists of a two-year moving time window (immediately prior to the month of
estimation) and an L1 regularization approach, to identify the best performing parsimonious
model [39]. This moving window approach allows the model to constantly improve its predic-
tive ability by capturing the changing relationship between Internet search behavior and den-
gue activity.
ARGO model formulation.
Our ARGO model assumes that more dengue-related
searches will be observed in times when more people are affected (either experiencing symp-
toms or hearing about someone who may have been infected) by the virus. This is formalized
mathematically via a hidden Markov model in ARGO as explained in [35].
Let yt = log(ct + 1) be the log-transformed dengue case counts ct at time t, and Xk,t the log-
transformed Google search frequency of query term k at time t. Then

where J is the set of auto-regressive lags, K is the set of Google query terms, and Xt can be
thought of as the exogenous variables to time series {yt} as introduced in [35].
ARGO model parameter estimation.
We take J = {1, . . ., 12} [ {24}, i.e., J consists of the
most recent 12 months and the month exactly two years ago. Such choice of J captures the
influence of short and mid-term yearly fluctuations, as well as long-term seasonality previously
shown to have strong predictive power in dengue [15]. We take K = 10, corresponding to the
top ten dengue-related search terms as described in the data subsection.

 We impose L1 regularity for parameter estimation. In a given month, the goal is to find
parameters μy, α = {αj: j 2 J}, and β = (β1, . . ., β10) that minimize

where λαj, λβk are regularization hyper-parameters.
For a given time window, ARGO automatically selects the most relevant variables to gener-
ate an out-of-sample dengue activity estimate. This is achieved by zeroing out regression coef-
ficients of terms that contribute little (or have redundant information) to the estimation. This
approach leads to interpretable results by allowing us to clearly identify which variables had a
role in detection for each month.
All statistical analyses were performed with R, version 3.2.4.
Benchmark models
For comparison with ARGO, we included estimation results from five alternative methods.
These are:
1. A seasonal autoregressive model without Google information, denoted as SAR, using a time
series of the most recent 3 lags, as well as 2 seasonal lags. Specifically, the monthly time
series model is comprised of time lags 1,2,3,12,24: yt = α1yt−1 + α2yt−2 + α3yt−3 + α12yt−12 +
α24yt−24 + �t, �t � N ð0; s2Þ. This model serves as a baseline for estimates made only using
dengue time-series information.
2. Google Dengue Trends [25], which ended in August 2015. Data are obtained from https://
www.google.org/flutrends/about/. Because Google Dengue Trends reported dengue inten-
sity in a scale from 0 to 1, we dynamically rescaled it using a sliding training window to rec-
reate case estimates.
3. A penalized multivariate linear regression model with Google Trends information only
[34], denoted as GT. This is essentially ARGO without autoregressive lags, and incorporates
a common L1 penalty on the Google Trends data;
4. A seasonal autoregressive model with Google Dengue Trends as exogenous variable,
denoted as SAR+GDT. yt = α1yt−1 + α2yt−2 + α3yt−3 + α12yt−12 + α24yt−24 + β log GDTt + �t,
�t � N ð0; s2Þ.
5. A naive method, which simply uses the case count at the previous month as the guess for
the value of the current month.
All benchmark models (except the naive method) were trained by linear regression with slid-
ing two year windows for fair comparison.
Accuracy metrics
We used five accuracy metrics to compare model performance: root mean squared error
(RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE), mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Pearson correlation.
Mathematically, these accuracy metrics of estimator ^

 Retrospective estimations
Retrospective out-of-sample estimates of dengue case counts were generated for each country
using ARGO and the five benchmark models, assuming we only had access to information
available at the time of estimation. The time windows in which we assessed the performance of
our dengue estimates for each country were chosen based on the availability of official and
GDT benchmark data.
These time windows are: Brazil from Mar 2006–Dec 2012, Mexico from Mar 2006–Aug
2015, Thailand from Oct 2010–Aug 2015, Singapore from Feb 2008–Aug 2015, and Taiwan
from Jan 2013–Mar 2016.
Results
In four of the five countries/states, Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and Singapore, ARGO outper-
formed all benchmark models across essentially all accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, RMSPE,
MAPE, correlation). See Table 1. In particular, by incorporating information from the Internet
searches and the dengue time-series, ARGO achieved better results than using either informa-
tion alone. This accuracy improvement is reflected in the decreased errors during both peaks
of dengue activity and off-season/periods with low levels of infection. See Fig 1. Unlike the
seasonal autoregression with GDT model (SAR+GDT), ARGO avoided the significant over-
shooting problem that has been previously noted in Google Trends data ([35], [40]). This is
especially notable between 2006–2008 and 2012–2014 in Mexico, and 2006–2010 in Brazil.
Taiwan shows notably different results. Of all the available models, the naive and seasonal
autoregressive models have the best performance, but neither is clearly effective. The naive
model has the lowest RMSE and MAE, but the worst RMSPE, MAPE and correlation, while
the seasonal model shows the best RMSPE, MAPE and correlation. In comparison, the other
models have a much greater RMSE to MAE ratio, indicating worse performance during high
prevalence relative to the naive model. ARGO does not outperform the benchmarks in this
case.
This result seems to reflect the distinct case count pattern in Taiwan compared to the other
countries. Taiwan experienced little to no dengue prevalence for years until two epidemic
spikes occurred in 2014 and 2015. In contrast, the other countries experience seasonal fluctua-
tions of dengue over their entire estimation windows. This lack of predictability may be the
reason that both seasonal and Google Trends-based models have greater error than the naive
model, significantly over-estimating the 2015 peak for example. Yet overall, these methods
show greater correlation than the naive method, perhaps because they are more responsive.
Because ARGO over-estimates to a greater extent than the autoregressive methodology, this
again reflects previous observations on the tendency of Google data to overshoot.
ARGO dynamically adjusts weights of dengue time-series and Google Trends data to best
fit the most recent dengue behavior (See Fig. A, B, C, D, and E in S1 Text).
Discussion
Our findings confirm that combining historical dengue incidence information with dengue-
related Google search data, in a self-adjusting manner, leads to better near real-time dengue
activity estimates than those obtained with previous methodologies that exploit the informa-
tion separately. This also confirms that the hidden Markov model framework used by ARGO
is appropriate in this context [35].
ARGO’s uniform out-performance of other benchmark methods for Mexico, Brazil, Thai-
land, and Singapore demonstrates its robustness and broad applicability. ARGO achieves
this by balancing the influence of Internet search data, which quickly change in the face of

 outbreaks, and auto-regressive information, which tempers the estimations to mitigate the
problem of overshooting. The application of an L1 regularization approach [34, 35, 39] helps
identify the query terms most relevant to estimation at any given time, providing easy-to-inter-
pret information as shown in the heatmaps in Figures A, B, C, D, and E in S1 Text. ARGO
dynamically trains on a two-year rolling window, allowing model parameters to adjust over
time to account for changes in Internet users’ behavior. The success of our methodology is
based on the intuition that the more people are affected by dengue, the higher the number of
dengue-related searches will be during an outbreak, and therefore the more likely Google
query information will be useful at detecting dengue activity. This is observed in our findings,
Table 1. Comparison of ARGO to benchmark models across countries and evaluation metrics. The bold face value is the best value among all methods
according to each performance metric. Google Dengue Trends was not published for Taiwan and therefore the GDT benchmark is not available for Taiwan.
The assessment period for the five regions, chosen based on the common available periods for all methods, are: Brazil (Mar 2006–Dec 2012), Mexico (Mar
2006–Aug 2015), Thailand (Oct 2010–Aug 2015), Singapore (Feb 2008–Aug 2015), Taiwan (Jan 2013–Mar 2016). The error value is relative to the naive,

as shown in Table 2. This is consistent with earlier findings that dengue virus prevalence is cor-
related with model performance in sub-regions of Mexico [38]. In addition, in Brazil, Mexico,
and Thailand, the countries where our methodology works best, a clear seasonal pattern is
observed in the disease incidence trends over time, as shown in Table 2.
On the other hand, the results from Taiwan illustrate the limitations of our approach. Tai-
wan does not present either an observable seasonal trend or a high number of dengue cases.
As a result, neither ARGO nor the model using only Google search terms reliably track den-
gue. Low dengue-related Internet search activity during most years and sudden public interest
during the outbreaks of 2014 and 2015, causing mis-calibration of the Google Trends data,
may be another contributor. Other unique characteristics of the Taiwan outbreaks are that
they were largely localized in South Taiwan, where Aedes aegypti is resident, and featured viral
strains from neighboring countries rather than endemic strains [45, 46]. Also of interest is that
the increased case counts occurred during periods of significantly increased temperature and
rainfall [46]. The unpredictable character of these outbreaks present challenges for the perfor-
mance of ARGO, and generally of all the methods considered in our comparison, but also
highlight the potential of incorporating environmental predictors such as temperature and
precipitation in our approaches.
While Internet penetration may seem to be an important factor in assessing the quality of
Google Trends data, the statistics from Table 2 show that it alone is not as effective as dengue
prevalence or seasonality in predicting the overall performance of our methodology. As an
example, although Taiwan has high Internet penetration, the dengue case count may be low
enough over most years that dengue-related searches motivated by other medical or educa-
tional purposes may introduce significant noise in the Google-query data. On the other hand,
ARGO shows strong improvement over the seasonal autoregressive model in Brazil and Singa-
pore, two countries with moderate to high Internet access, compared to Mexico and Thailand,
which have low Internet access, suggesting that web penetration is nevertheless still an impor-
tant factor. Finally, the proportion of the population within a country using Google as a search
engine also provides some insight into the performance of ARGO (Table 2). ARGO shows the
lowest correlation in Taiwan, which happens to have the lowest Google market share among
the countries studied here [42].
Despite dengue and flu having very different biological transmission patterns, the fact that
modifications to the ARGO methodology yield robust and accurate dengue estimates indicates

 the strength of our methodological framework. Although the monthly time scale chosen for
this study was originally chosen based on data availability, inspection shows that a monthly
surveillance approach is better suited for the 2-week serial interval of dengue [47].
The dengue activity estimates obtained with our methodology, like estimates from any
novel digital disease detection tool, are not meant to replace dengue information obtained
from traditional healthcare-based disease surveillance; instead, they can help decision-makers
confirm (or deny) suspected disease trends ahead of traditional disease surveillance systems.
Ultimately, the goal of this effort is to take a step closer to the development of an accurate,
real-time modeling platform, where dengue case estimates can be constantly updated to pro-
vide authorities and non-governmental organizations with potentially actionable and close
to real-time data on which they can make informed decisions, as well as providing travelers
visiting high-risk areas with warnings. Such a platform could bring multiple information
sources together, including but not limited to traditional epidemiological case reports, Google
searches, crowd-sourced data, and climate and transportation information, creating a rapid
response and alert system for users based on their specific location. Timely and precise detec-
tion may turn out to play a large role in reducing infections in the near future by influencing
the timing of vector control efforts, hospital and clinical preparation, and providing public and
individual alerts.
The platform would also enable users to verify dengue risk information with their own
observations, creating a positive feedback loop that would continuously improve the accu-
racy of the tool. We are currently implementing two building-blocks that could help shape
such a platform. The first one consists of a webpage Healthmap.org/denguetrends where
dengue estimates produced with the methodology introduced in this manuscript are contin-
uously displayed, and the second one is a crowd-sourced tool (currently in beta) that offers a
user-friendly online chat system which maps dengue cases worldwide, and gives the public
free access to toolkits that help reduce their risk of infection. This second effort is led by
Break Dengue’s “Dengue Track” initiative www.breakdengue.org/dengue-track/. The
potential impact may be far reaching, as the same models could also be used to track and
map other infectious and mosquito-borne diseases, like Zika, malaria, yellow fever or
Chikungunya.
Real-time implementation of our methods requires robust responses to changes in data
quality, availability, and format. For example, Google correlate data shows internal variability
attributed to re-sampling when the tool is accessed at different times. In addition, epidemio-
logical data is not always published consistently by countries, creating lags in reporting that
would make our methodology (which assumes having access to last month’s dengue case
counts) not applicable.
In order to understand the impact of these data limitations, we performed two robustness
studies of ARGO with respect to (1) the variations in Google Trends data, and (2) the availabil-
ity of the most recent dengue case count data. For the first, we obtained multiple data sets con-
taining the search frequencies of the query terms displayed on Table A in S1 Text by accessing
Google Trends 10 different times during a week. We then produced Dengue activity estimates
with ARGO using these 10 data sets as input. Table B in S1 Text shows that ARGO still outper-
forms all other methods in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and Singapore, despite the random varia-
tions observed in Google Trends data. For the second, we retrained all the models under the
assumption that the dengue case count from the past month was never available due to report-
ing delays. Table C in S1 Text shows that despite the unavailability of the last month dengue
counts, ARGO had competitive predictive performance in the five countries/states when com-
pared to other models (similar to the full data case), suggesting that our methodology is robust
to the time delays in reporting in addition to variations in the input variables.

 While our methods are designed to self-correct over time, the introduction of an interven-
tion to curb dengue activity that could lead to a reduction in dengue cases, such as vector
control or behavioral education (e.g. use of bed nets), may potentially lead our models to tem-
porarily over-predict incidence. However, once such an intervention has been established and
remains active in a given location, our models will self-correct over time to predict the new lev-
els of dengue activity. Sporadic, nation-wide mosquito control methods would provide a big-
ger challenge to dengue case count predictability and, therefore, our model’s usability.
In light of ARGO’s strengths and limitations, future work should analyze the feasibility of
applying our methodology to other countries, finer spatial resolutions, and temporal resolu-
tions. This will be followed by routine reassessments of our methods to identify changes in
information or potential improvements, including new search terms. As an example of such
a change, Brazil has started publishing weekly dengue case counts since 2014. While our
work used only the monthly resolution for fair comparison among all countries, adapting
our methods to shorter time horizons for regions that provide such information would be
useful.
Information on national-level dengue activity may not be ideal for decision-making at the
local level since this information has been aggregated over a wide variety of potentially hetero-
geneous spatial environments. Future work should explore finer spatial resolution estimations
to identify whether region-specific factors may improve or worsen results, similar to what has
been done in [15, 38]. The five countries/states explored in this study vary on orders of magni-
tudes of size; for example, Brazil, Mexico, and Thailand each spans over 100 million square
miles. As a result, these three countries contain wide ecological diversity and potentially vary-
ing patterns of dengue transmission among different sub-regions. It may be expected, for
example, that Brazil would show different levels of seasonality in tropical compared to temper-
ate areas. The success of finer spatial resolutions would depend on the quality of local case
count and Google Trends data; the former can be affected by reporting efficiency, and the lat-
ter can be subject to Internet availability and Google use in a given region. Using national level
data, on the other hand, has the advantage of smoother incidence curves for extraction and
extrapolation of signal at the cost of more granular information. This is reflected in the obser-
vation that ARGO performed best in the three large countries despite the inherent heterogene-
ity within each country. This fits with our previous observation that a combination of higher
dengue prevalence at the national level, seasonality and Google use in these countries leads to
better results. We believe that these strengths and limitations also apply to extending our meth-
odology to other countries/states besides those studied in the paper.
Producing short-term forecasts of dengue activity, in addition to the nowcast presented
here should also be pursued (See [48] for such an extension for flu forecasting). Our approach
may help produce dengue activity estimates in higher spatial resolutions that can lead to alert
systems for people with an increased risk of exposure to the dengue virus at any given point in
time. It is important to keep in mind that state-level or city-level spatial scales with low dengue
activity may present similar challenges to the applicability of our approach as seen in Taiwan.
The incorporation of other Internet-based data sources [48, 49] and cross-country spatial rela-
tionships should also be exploited in order to improve the accuracy in predictions.
