IMPORTANCE Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) might be an attractive
choice for stroke prevention in people without atrial fibrillation who may harbor a potential
source of cardiac emboli, but not if certain individual NOACs carry risks of intracranial
hemorrhage that are heightened relative to aspirin.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
to assess the risk of intracranial hemorrhage with individual NOACs vs aspirin across all
indications.
DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from
inception to May 28, 2018, with the terms novel oral anticoagulants, non–vitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulants, direct oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban,
edoxaban, warfarin, Coumadin, vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA, and
major bleeding, fatal bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage. We restricted our search to clinical
trials on humans. There were no language restrictions.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of 3 months or longer that included a
comparison of the outcomes of NOAC use vs use of aspirin.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently abstracted data from
eligible studies. We computed a fixed-effect estimate based on the Mantel-Haenszel method.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CI were used as a measure of
the association of individual NOAC vs aspirin with the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The
hypothesis that intracranial hemorrhage risk would be higher with NOACs than aspirin was
formulated during data collection.
RESULTS Our principal analysis included 5 randomized clinical trials comparing 1 or more
NOACs with aspirin, with 39 398 individuals enrolled. Pooling the results from the
fixed-effects model showed that a dose of 15 to 20 mg of rivaroxaban once daily was
associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (2 trials; OR, 3.31 [95% CI, 1.42
to 7.72]) compared with aspirin, while a 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban once daily or a 5-mg dose
twice daily (3 trials; OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.93 to 2.21]) and a 5-mg dose of apixaban twice daily
(1 trial; OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.38 to 1.88]) were not.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A 15-mg to 20-mg dose of rivaroxaban once daily is
associated with substantially increased risks of intracranial hemorrhage, while smaller daily
doses of rivaroxaban and apixaban were not, implying that risk increase is dose dependent. It
may be worthwhile to conduct randomized clinical trials comparing specific NOACs in specific
doses (eg, apixaban, 5 mg twice daily) and aspirin in patients without atrial fibrillation, but
with potential sources of cardiac emboli that could cause stroke.

 I
ntracranial hemorrhage is a major concern when an anti-
thrombotic agent is given to a patient, because intracranial
hemorrhage is generally associated with a high risk of
mortality1 and poorer health over a lifetime,2,3 which could off-
set the benefits of antithrombotic treatment in reducing major
ischemic events. Such a concern may lead some physicians to
resort to aspirin in certain situations, such as atrial fibrillation,
when an oral anticoagulant is indicated. However, in a large
clinical trial of patients with atrial fibrillation,4 a 5-mg dose of
apixaban twice daily was shown to not cause more intracra-
nial hemorrhage than aspirin, and the medication substan-
tiallyreducedstrokerisk,therebymakingaspirin,withitsmuch
smaller stroke protection benefit, no longer a viable therapeu-
tic option in people with atrial fibrillation, even from a stand-
point of safety concern.
Considering the low risks of intracranial hemorrhage with
non–vitaminKantagonistoralanticoagulants(NOACs)use,one
may wonder whether NOACs could be applied to clinical sce-
narios beyond atrial fibrillation that traditionally been treated
by aspirin. However, NOACs are not all the same. A network
meta-analysis comparing one NOAC with another clearly show
they are different in terms of effectiveness and safety.5 In-
deed, another large clinical trial showed that a 15-mg dose of
rivaroxaban once daily substantially increased the risk of in-
tracranial hemorrhage in patients with embolic stroke of un-
determined source.6
Although NOACs and aspirin are in general protective in
different vascular beds, NOACs might be an attractive choice
for stroke prevention in certain clinical situations, such as in
people without recognized atrial fibrillation but with an em-
bolic stroke of undetermined source7,8 or atrial cardiopathy9-11
because of their propensity to also cause stroke through car-
diacemboli.Nonetheless,thebenefitofNOACscomparedwith
aspirin for stroke protection is likely to be less promising in
people without atrial fibrillation, compared with people with
atrial fibrillation. Therefore it is even more important to clarify
whether individual NOACs in various doses harbor compa-
rable risks of intracranial hemorrhage with aspirin based on
theevidencecurrentlyavailablebeforeconductingalargeclini-
cal trial in such a population. To do this, we conducted a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
for the comparison across all indications of intracranial
hemorrhage with individual NOACs vs aspirin.
Methods
This study was performed in accordance with the recommen-
dations of the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.12
Data Sources and Searches
We searched PubMed (from 1966 to May 28, 2018), Excerpta
Medica dataBASE (EMBASE; from 1966 to May 28, 2018), the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and
the clinical trial registry maintained at ClinicalTrials.gov with
the terms novel oral anticoagulants, non–vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants, direct oral anticoagulants, dabigatran,
rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, warfarin, Coumadin,
vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA, and
major bleeding, fatal bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage. We
restricted our search to human and clinical trials. There were
no language restrictions. We also reviewed the Introduction
and Discussion sections of retrieved trials and relevant re-
view articles to identify additional trials. Two investigators
(W.-Y.H. and M.L.) independently conducted the literature
search, screen of abstracts, and selection of included trials.
Study Selection
Criteria for inclusion of a study were (1) a randomized clinical
trial study design, (2) inclusion of a comparison of NOACs with
aspirin, (3) reporting of intracranial hemorrhage as an end
point, (4) reporting of the number of participants and the num-
ber of intracranial hemorrhage separately in each group, and
(5) a treatment duration of at least 3 months. When compari-
son of individual NOACs (eg, dabigatran and edoxaban) with
aspirinwerenotavailable,weselectedstudiescomparingdabi-
gatran or edoxaban with warfarin, as well as comparing aspi-
rin with warfarin, to obtain the indirect comparison between
dabigatran or edoxaban and aspirin.
Criteriaforexclusionofastudywerethatit(1)wasanNOAC
trial that did not use at least of 1 of the 4 eligible NOACs
(ie, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), be-
cause only these NOACs are approved for use in atrial fibrilla-
tion in current guidelines; (2) included a combination of 2 or
more antithrombotic agents as a treatment strategy in a study
arm; (3) used antiplatelet agents other than aspirin; and (4) was
published prior to 2000. In addition, we excluded all studies
that included a population in which most participants had
(5) cancer; (6) a mechanic heart valve (because the use of
1 NOAC, dabigatran, in patients with mechanical heart
valves was associated with increased rates of thromboem-
bolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin,
and NOAC use is thus not justified for these patients13); or
(7) end-stage renal disease.
Data Abstraction
We abstracted data about baseline characteristics, which in-
clude age, sex, duration of follow-up, and the number of
Key Points
Question How do individual non–vitamin K antagonist oral
anticoagulants compare with aspirin with regard to the risk of
intracranial hemorrhage?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 5
randomized clinical trials that had compared non–vitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulants with aspirin; the use of 15 to 20 mg
of rivaroxaban daily was associated with increased risk of
intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 3.31 [95% CI, 1.42 to 7.72]) compared
with aspirin, while 10 mg of rivaroxaban daily and 5 mg of apixaban
twice daily were not.
Meaning In this study, a rivaroxaban dose of 15 to 20 mg once
daily greatly increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage
compared with aspirin, while neither the lower doses of
rivaroxaban nor apixaban conferred such comparative risk.

 patients in each group. We also abstracted data on safety out-
comes from each trial, which include numbers with intracra-
nial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and fatal bleeding in each
group under NOACs and aspirin treatment. Two investigators
(M.L. and W.-Y.H.) independently abstracted data from eli-
gible studies. Any discrepant judgments were resolved by joint
discussion.
Quality Assessment
The risk of bias (eg, sequence generation, allocation conceal-
ment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective out-
come reporting, and other issues) in each trial was indepen-
dently assessed in accordance with the Cochrane risk of bias
tool. The risk of bias was rated as low, unclear, or high, accord-
ing to established criteria.14
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was the association of individual
NOACs (compared with aspirin) with risks for intracranial
hemorrhage. The secondary end points were risks of major
bleeding and fatal bleeding.
The definitions of intracranial hemorrhage and fatal bleed-
ing were consistent across trials. (Intracranial hemorrhage was
defined as traumatic and atraumatic intracerebral, subarach-
noid, and subdural or epidural hemorrhage. Fatal bleeding was
defined as mortality caused by bleeding.) However, major
bleeding differed slightly across trials. It was defined as clini-
cally overt bleeding accompanied by 1 or more of the follow-
ing: a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or more in a
24-hour period, transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red
cells, and bleeding at a critical site4 or any site in the body,6 as
per the criteria of the International Society of Thrombosis and
Hemostasis.
The dosage of each NOAC was taken into consideration.
Rivaroxabanwasfurthercategorizedinto15to20mgoncedaily
and 10 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily, because this differ-
ence of dosage was substantial.
Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were used as a measure
of the association of individual NOACs vs aspirin with the
risk of intracranial hemorrhage, fatal bleeding, or major
bleeding. We computed a fixed-effect estimate based on the
Mantel-Haenszel method when 2 or more studies provided
sufficient data for a given outcome. The principal analysis
was pairwise comparisons between individual NOACs and
aspirin.
In situations where pairwise comparisons were not avail-
able between certain NOACs (ie, dabigatran and edoxaban) and
aspirin, we conducted accessory analyses using dabigatran or
edoxaban vs warfarin and aspirin vs warfarin to obtain indi-
rect comparisons of dabigatran or edoxaban vs aspirin. Re-
sults from these indirect comparisons should be regarded as
suggestive rather than conclusive. Studies that compared ri-
varoxaban or apixaban with warfarin were excluded from the
study; because direct comparison between rivaroxaban or
apixaban vs aspirin has been available in randomized clinical
trials, it was not necessary to obtain results from indirect com-
parison.
Subgroup analyses for the primary end point, intracra-
nial hemorrhage, were conducted for different trial charac-
teristics: patients with a history of ischemic stroke, atrial
fibrillation, or venous thromboembolism at entry. This sub-
group analysis was driven by the fact that the risk of intra-
cranial hemorrhage within 1 year after ischemic stroke is
about 15 times higher than in the reference population,15
and patients with atrial fibrillation have a propensity to
have more incidents of bleeding compared with patients
without atrial fibrillation.16 Therefore it was important to
clarify whether individual NOACs were causing additional
risks of intracranial hemorrhage compared with aspirin in
these situations.
Heterogeneity was assessed by the P value of χ2 and I2 sta-
tistics, which describes the percentage of variability in the ef-
fect estimates that is because of heterogeneity rather than
chance.17,18 We considered study-level estimates to be hetero-
geneous if the χ2 test was significant (P < .05) or the I2 statis-
tic was greater than 50%. We report absolute risks in terms of
the difference in the number of events per 1000 patients and
therespective95%CI.Allanalyseswerebasedontheintention-
to-treat principle. We evaluated the quality of evidence for pri-
maryandsecondaryoutcomesreportedinthemeta-analysis.19
For all analyses, P < .05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. The Review Manager Software Package (RevMan 5; Coch-
rane Collaboration) and Stata version 13 (Stata Corp) were used
for this meta-analysis.
Results
The literature review identified 56 full articles for detailed as-
sessment, of which 31 were excluded for using placebo or no
treatment in the control group (k = 4), using another antiplate-
let drug rather than aspirin in the comparator group (k = 2),
continuing treatment for less than 3 months (k = 19), or com-
paring rivaroxaban or apixaban with warfarin (k = 6). Twenty
trials regarding dabigatran or edoxaban vs warfarin and aspi-
rin vs warfarin were included in accessory analyses for the pur-
pose of obtaining indirect comparisons of dabigatran or edoxa-
ban vs aspirin.
Our final principal analysis included 5 randomized clini-
cal trials comparing NOAC and aspirin, with 39 398 individu-
alsenrolled(eFigureintheSupplement).4,6,20-22Onetrial4com-
pared a 5-mg dose of apixaban twice daily with aspirin in
patients with atrial fibrillation. One trial6 compared 15 mg of
rivaroxaban once daily with aspirin in patients with embolic
stroke of undetermined source. One trial22 compared riva-
roxaban delivered in 20-mg or 10-mg doses once daily with as-
pirin in patients with venous thromboembolism. Two trials
compared a 5-mg dose of rivaroxaban twice daily with aspi-
rin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease20 and stable
peripheral or carotid artery disease.21
The characteristics of these 5 randomized clinical trials
are shown in Table 1. The overall quality of included trials
was considered good, because all trials showed low risk of
bias based on the Cochrane risk of bias assessment (eTable 1
in the Supplement).

 rivaroxaban (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.26 to 9.20]) and a 10-mg,
once-daily dose (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05 to 5.54]) were not sig-
nificantly associated with increased risks of intracranial
hemorrhage.22
Accessory Analysis
There was no direct comparison of dabigatran or edoxaban vs
aspirin. Therefore, 20 trials regarding dabigatran vs warfarin,
edoxaban vs warfarin, and aspirin vs warfarin were included
for the purpose of obtaining the indirect comparison of dabi-
gatran or edoxaban vs aspirin (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Indirect comparison implied both dabigatran at a dose of 110
mg to 150 mg twice daily and edoxaban at a dose of 30 to 60
mg once daily might be not associated with increased risks of
intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding compared with as-
pirin but might be associated with increased risks of major
bleeding (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis of 5 randomized clinical trials across all
indication of high-quality data from almost 40 000 people, we
found that a 15-mg to 20-mg dose of rivaroxaban once daily
was associated with substantially higher odds of intracranial
hemorrhage than aspirin, while a 5-mg dose of apixaban twice
dailyanda10-mgdoseofrivaroxabanoncedailyora5-mgdose
twice daily were not associated with increased risks. The qual-
ity of a body of evidence for outcome was moderate. Al-
though the results were derived from a few (even single) large
randomized clinical trials, it might provide evidence to in-
form the potential design and conduct of future NOAC trials
beyond atrial fibrillation. Also, indirect comparisons implied
that dabigatran in doses of 110 mg to 150 mg twice daily and
edoxaban in doses of 30 mg to 60 mg once daily might have
comparable risks of intracranial hemorrhage with aspirin, al-
though such results should be interpreted with caution be-
cause of the lack of head-to-head comparisons in any random-
ized clinical trial.
The novelty of this meta-analysis lies in the comparison
across all indications of intracranial hemorrhage with indi-
vidual NOAC vs aspirin. The efficacy and safety of NOACs as a
class in patients with atrial fibrillation has been well
established.24 However, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage
possessed by each individual NOAC is crucial when that NOAC
is to be considered in a clinical scenario other than treatment
of a patient with atrial fibrillation. For example, several large
prospective cohorts have shown that atrial abnormality was
associated with increased risks of stroke in patients without
recognized atrial fibrillation.9-11 Patients with ischemic stroke
who do not have atrial fibrillation but do have moderate to se-
vereleftatrialenlargement(vsnormalleftatrialsize)alsoshow
atrendtowardagreaterriskofrecurrentcardioembolicorcryp-
togenic stroke.25 Although cardiac emboli are likely to be the
cause for stroke, those patients would be treated by aspirin un-
less atrial fibrillation is recognized. Since a 5-mg dose of apixa-
ban twice daily had comparable risks of intracranial hemor-
rhage with aspirin, it could be an attractive alternative agent
foruseonthispopulation.Ontheotherhand,a15-mgto20-mg
dose of rivaroxaban once daily possessed substantial higher
risks of intracranial hemorrhage than aspirin, its use in people
without atrial fibrillation could not be encouraged. Although
10 mg of rivaroxaban once daily or 5 mg twice daily did not
show higher risks of intracranial hemorrhage than aspirin in
this meta-analysis, it is worthwhile to mention that such low-
dose rivaroxaban did not reduce major cardiovascular events
or stroke compared with aspirin in patients with vascular
disease,20,21 and even a 15-mg dose of rivaroxaban was not bet-

Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, a meta-analysis
may be biased when the literature search fails to identify all

 relevant trials or the selection criteria for including a trial are
applied in a subjective manner. To minimize these risks, we
performed thorough searches across multiple literature and
trial databases and used explicit criteria for study selection,
data abstraction, and data analysis.
Second, the results were derived from a few large clinical
trials, and in some cases from single trials, and the quality of
a body of evidence was moderate. Also, there is to our knowl-
edge no pairwise comparison in dabigatran or edoxaban vs as-
pirin in a published randomized clinical trial to date. Ongoing
trials with apixaban vs aspirin8 and dabigatran vs aspirin7 in
patients with embolic stroke with undetermined source may
help to resolve these concerns, at least partially.
Third, intracerebral hemorrhage is known to account for
alargerproportionofstrokesinAsianvswhitepopulations,26,27
and thus it is important to clarify the risks of intracranial hem-
orrhage between individual NOACs and aspirin in Asian indi-
viduals. However, no trials included in this analysis provided
ethnic subgroup analysis, and for this reason, further analy-
sis was not possible.
Finally, in this study-level meta-analysis, we were
only able to use data on major bleeding provided by the
original trials, which used a variety of differing definitions.
Because major bleeding was the secondary end point of this
study and the differences in definitions was not substantial,
this likely made little difference in the overall results of this
meta-analysis.
Conclusion
Inconclusion,inthismeta-analysisofrandomizedclinicaltrials
across all indications comparing individual NOACs and aspi-
rin, we found that patients receiving 15 to 20 mg of rivaroxa-
ban once daily had substantially increased risks of intracra-
nialhemorrhage,whilepatientswhotook10mgofrivaroxaban
once daily, 5 mg of rivaroxaban twice daily, or 5 mg of apixa-
ban twice daily had no increased risks. There was no pairwise
comparison between dabigatran or edoxaban vs aspirin, but
an indirect comparison suggests that taking 110 to 150 mg of
dabigatran twice daily or 30 to 60 mg of edoxaban once daily
might be not associated with increased risks of intracranial
hemorrhage, although such results should be interpreted with
caution. Based on these findings, only patients with atrial fi-
brillation should be considered for administration of 15 to 20
mg of rivaroxaban once daily. In addition, it may be worth-
while to conduct randomized clinical trials comparing cer-
tain NOAC dosages (eg, 5 mg of apixaban twice daily) and as-
pirin in patients who do not have atrial fibrillation but do have
potential sources of cardiac emboli that can cause stroke.
