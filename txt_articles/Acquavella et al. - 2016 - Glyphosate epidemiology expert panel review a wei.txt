ABSTRACT
We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic literature for glyphosate focusing on non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) – two cancers that were the focus of a
recent review by an International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group. Our approach
was consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines for systematic reviews. We evaluated each relevant study according to a priori criteria for
study quality: adequacy of study size, likelihood of confounding, potential for other biases and
adequacy of the statistical analyses. Our evaluation included seven unique studies for NHL and four
for MM, all but one of which were case control studies for each cancer. For NHL, the case-control
studies were all limited by the potential for recall bias and the lack of adequate multivariate adjust-
ment for multiple pesticide and other farming exposures. Only the Agricultural Health (cohort)
Study met our a priori quality standards and this study found no evidence of an association
between glyphosate and NHL. For MM, the case control studies shared the same limitations as
noted for the NHL case-control studies and, in aggregate, the data were too sparse to enable an
informed causal judgment. Overall, our review did not find support in the epidemiologic literature
for a causal association between glyphosate and NHL or MM.

Introduction
The epidemiologic literature for glyphosate was reviewed
recently as part of a multi-disciplinary scientific review by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 2015). In
the aftermath of the IARC review and the designation of gly-
phosate as probably carcinogenic to humans, the Monsanto
Company requested expert reviews of the glyphosate litera-
ture in several technical areas, including epidemiology. IARC’s
working group concluded that there was limited epidemio-
logic evidence1 in human studies for the carcinogenicity of
glyphosate, based on a positive association observed for non-
Hodgkin’s
lymphoma
(NHL).
The
panel
also noted
that
excesses had been observed for multiple myeloma (MM) in
three studies, but felt these results were less reliable because
of small numbers of cases in the available studies and the

 related inability to adjust findings for other pesticide and
farming exposures. Lastly, the panel concluded that there
was no epidemiologic evidence of a relationship for other
cancer sites with respect to glyphosate exposure.
In this epidemiology expert panel review, we focused on
the possible relationship between glyphosate exposure and
two cancers that were the focus of the IARC epidemiology
review: NHL and MM. The focus of our review was qualitative.
That is, we evaluated the published evidence according to
widely accepted validity considerations and criteria for causal-
ity. When there were two or more publications with overlap-
ping populations, we concentrated on the most recent
publication noting the relationship to a previous publication(s)
(see Table 1). Herein, in succeeding sections, we have pre-
sented our evaluation approach, reviewed the key validity
issues for epidemiologic studies of pesticides, detailed some
statistical considerations pertinent to the glyphosate literature,
critically evaluated published studies, and, lastly, provided an
overall weight of evidence assessment of the epidemiologic
evidence for causality between glyphosate and NHL or MM.
Methods
The approach we took was informed by and consistent with
the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews (Moher et al.
2009), standard approaches to critically evaluating epidemio-
logic studies (Aschengrau & Seage 2003a,b; Sanderson et al.
2007) and well-recognized interpretative methods – e.g. the
criteria-based methods of causal inference (Hill 1965, 1971) –
sometimes referred to as “weight of evidence” methods
(Weed 2005). With this approach in mind, we address the fol-
lowing questions:
1.
Does
the
current
published
epidemiologic
evidence
establish
a
causal
relationship
between
glyphosate
exposure and NHL?
2.
Does
the
current
published
epidemiologic
evidence
establish
a
causal
relationship
between
glyphosate
exposure and MM?
Other types of scientific evidence are often evaluated
when
making
causal
determinations,
including
data
on
human exposure as well as animal studies and studies on
mechanism. Since exposure assessment is critical for the val-
idity of occupational epidemiologic studies and biologic
plausibility is informed by presumed dose, the former were
considered in our overall assessments.
Literature search and included/excluded
published papers
A systematic search of the medical literature was per-
formed to identify all analytic epidemiological studies that
have examined the possible relationships between exposure
to glyphosate and NHL and MM. The aim was to include
all such publications – case control studies, cohort studies
and pooled analyses – published to the present. In this
process, other publications are typically identified, such as
reviews, commentaries, methodological investigations, letters
to the editor and case reports (or case series). Our primary
concern here, however, was the evaluation of the pub-
lished analytical epidemiological studies of glyphosate and
either NHL or MM. To the extent that other types of publi-
cations inform our assessment, those papers will be cited
in
this
report.

CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
29
 After removal of duplicates and examining the titles and
abstracts, 11 publications were identified as relevant. Reasons
for exclusions include: not analytical epidemiology, glypho-
sate not examined, and NHL and/or MM not examined.
An additional seven relevant analytic epidemiological stud-
ies were identified after examining reference lists from the
publications above, the IARC Monograph 112 (2015) wherein
glyphosate and cancer were evaluated, as well as personal
collections of relevant papers by the expert panel. Upon fur-
ther review, two of these references were excluded: Lee et al.
(2005) because it did not focus on NHL or MM (only glioma)
and the meta-analysis of Schinasi and Leon (2014) because
our focus was on the primary literature. A meta-analysis by
Chang and Delzell (2016) that was pending publication at the
time of our review would have been excluded for the same
reason.
The 16 relevant analytical epidemiological studies are
listed in Table 1. Data collected from each study included the
following: first author, year of publication, study design, num-
ber of cases and controls (for case-control studies), number
of participants in cohort studies, results (typically in terms of
an estimate of the relative risk [RR], e.g. an odds ratio [OR]
with accompanying 95% confidence interval [95% CI]), expo-
sure–response (if available), variables adjusted for in the
analyses, and outcome (e.g. NHL, MM). See Tables 2 and 3 for
details.
Each study was evaluated by the panel for the following
key features that relate to study validity: recall bias (likely/
unlikely3),
exposure
misclassification
(likely/unlikely),
exposure–response analyses with a trend test (yes/no), selec-
tion bias (likely/unlikely), adjustment for confounding by
other (non-glyphosate) pesticides (yes/no), adjustment for
confounding
from
other
variables
(yes/no),
pathological
review
of
cases
(yes/no),
proxy
respondents
(%cases/
%controls), bias from sparse data (possible/no), blinding of
interviews (yes/no/unclear) and consideration of induction/
latency (yes/no). See Table 4 for details.
Validity considerations
Selection bias and recall bias
With the exception of one notable cohort study (De Roos
et al. 2005), epidemiologists have employed the case control
design to investigate glyphosate. Case control and cohort
studies are related designs. Both study designs, if conducted
with high quality, can produce valid results. In fact, the case
control design is best thought of as including the cases that
would have been detected in a hypothetical cohort study

 along with a sample of the source population (Rothman et al.
2008). The purpose of the control group is to determine the
relative size of the exposed and unexposed populations that
gave rise to the cases, so as to enable valid risk estimates for
exposed versus unexposed populations. At times in case con-
trol studies, the control population is selected for conveni-
ence or practicality in a way that does not allow determining
the relative size of the exposed and unexposed populations.
For example, hospital controls may be less likely to have
strenuous occupations than the general population; hence
farmers and/or others with pesticide exposures might be
under-represented among hospital controls. Poor or selective
participation by potential controls can produce the same
result. Both scenarios are examples of selection bias that
would almost certainly generate spurious positive associa-
tions between farming exposures and cancers.
A particularly important and well-known potential bias in
case control studies of pesticides is recall bias. That is, cases
tend to be more likely to remember or report exposures than
are study participants who have not been diagnosed with
cancer. This bias results from the natural self-examination by
cases of what might have caused their grievous illness. Recall
bias is not a concern in the sole glyphosate cohort study (De
Roos et al. 2005) because exposure was determined from
study participants at study entry before follow-up began for
health outcomes. Recall bias tends to produce spurious posi-
tive associations between exposure and disease.
Concern about recall bias also extends to next-of-kin who
participate in epidemiologic studies in place of deceased or
disabled family members. Analyses of next-of-kin or proxy
respondents have been found to produce results similar to
those of first-hand study subjects (e.g. Kachuri et al. 2013) or
to show results quite different than those based on first-hand
responders (e.g. Lee et al. 2005 – ORs for glyphosate and gli-
oma were 0.4 based on primary respondents and 3.1 for
proxy respondents); one never knows the impact of having
appreciable numbers of next-of-kin respondents without a
thorough analysis of data with/without proxy respondents
(Johnson et al. 1993). This concern is noteworthy because the
case-control studies for glyphosate frequently have a high
proportion of next-of-kin participants and many studies did
not evaluate the potential bias from next-of-kin responders.

 Exposure assessment and misclassification
With few exceptions, epidemiologic studies of pesticides
assess exposure by questioning participants or their next-of-
kin about the prior use of specific pesticides and associated
work practices. This practice has limitations compared with
other branches of occupational research where epidemiolo-
gists often have access to objective documentation about
past industrial workplace conditions to aid in exposure
assessment (e.g. engineering diagrams, process descriptions,
job descriptions, area or personal exposure-monitoring data).
A number of publications provide insights about the valid-
ity or reliability of self-reported pesticide information used in
epidemiologic studies. In one study, approximately 60% of
farmers’ self-reports agreed with suppliers’ records of pur-
chases for specific pesticides (Hoar et al. 1986). In another art-
icle, researchers evaluated the repeatability of self-reported
pesticide information on enrollment questionnaires for 4188
licensed pesticide applicators, primarily farmers, who filled
out questionnaires in successive years (Blair et al. 2002). The
year-to-year reliability for reporting any lifetime use of 11
widely used pesticides varied from 79 to 87%; categorical
agreement varied from 50 to 59% for typical days of use per
year and from 50 to 77% for years of use. Based on this lit-
erature, it is apparent that perhaps 10–20% or more of partic-
ipants in epidemiologic studies may report incorrectly that
they have used a specific pesticide and that reporting on fre-
quency of use and years of use is even less certain.
There seems to be considerable under-appreciation of the
implications of the acknowledged degree of exposure mis-
classification in the pesticide literature. Many consider expos-
ure misclassification to almost always be non-differential (e.g.
similar for cases and controls) and, therefore, to bias analyses
toward the null (or no association between an exposure and
a disease). However, even assuming the misclassification is
non-differential overall over multiple analyses, the direction
of the resulting bias can be uncertain for any specific analysis.
As Rothman and Greenland (1998) pointed out, in any given
study, random fluctuations can lead to bias away from the
null (towards a positive or negative association) even if the
classification method satisfies all the conditions for being
non-differential (viz. on average). Hence, in the studies con-
sidered in this review, with hundreds of comparisons per
study, some fraction of results likely will be biased away from
the null even if misclassification is non-differential.
Finally, unlike the five days per week, 50 weeks per year
routine for exposures in industrial settings, glyphosate and
other pesticide applications are not a frequent occurrence for
farmers and applicators. In fact, for most, application of a
specific pesticide, like glyphosate, is seasonal and happens
only a few days per year. The high exposure category in the
glyphosate literature is usually two or more days per year –
reflecting extremely infrequent use for the great majority of
study subjects and, annually, long periods without exposure.
This implies that pesticide exposures are much less frequent
than other occupational exposures for those who use pesti-
cides in their occupations and that these other, daily expo-
sures need to be addressed comprehensively in any analysis
of infrequently used pesticides.
Biomonitoring studies, implications for exposure
assessment
Epidemiologists recognize that there is a difference between
exposure (viz. reported use) and dose (the quantity of a sub-
stance that is absorbed). In fact, dose is of more interest than
exposure in studying potential causal associations. For some
chemicals, exposure and dose correlate well. For other chemi-
cals, the correlation is low. Understanding the correlation
between exposure and dose is essential for exposure–response
analyses – an important indicator for a causal relationship.
The properties of a chemical affect dose. Glyphosate is usu-
ally formulated as the isopropylamine salt, which has an
extremely low vapor pressure of 1.6 � 10�8 mm Hg (Tomlin
2003). Inhalation of spray droplets was found to be a minor
route of glyphosate exposure in a study of glyphosate applica-
tors in Finland (Jauhiainen et al. 1991), leaving dermal contact
as the primary route of exposure. Dermal penetration experi-
ments, where glyphosate was left undisturbed on skin surfaces
of experimental animals and on human skin in vitro, indicate a
percutaneous absorption of less than 2% (Wester et al. 1991).
Biomonitoring studies show results consistent with glyph-
osate’s physical/chemical properties. In a study of 48 farmers
in Minnesota and South Carolina during a normal day of gly-
phosate application on their farms, 60% of applicators were
found to have quantifiable glyphosate in urine (the predomin-
ant route of excretion), while 40% of farmers did not
(Acquavella et al. 2004). The distribution of urinary concentra-
tions was highly skewed, with only a small percentage of val-
ues appreciably different than the one part per billion limit of
detection. Nine farmers completed applications in excess of
100 acres and did not have detectable values for glyphosate in
their urine. Evaluation of different approaches to exposure
assessment used in epidemiologic studies has not shown
good correlation with biomonitoring data for glyphosate
(Acquavella et al. 2006), implying appreciable misclassification
in studies that rely on traditional pesticide exposure assess-
ment approaches.
The maximum systemic dose found in a review of all gly-
phosate
biomonitoring
studies
completed
to
date
is
0.004 mg/kg (Niemann et al. 2015). For comparison, the US
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)’s reference dose
(viz. the daily oral exposure to the human population, includ-
ing sensitive subgroups such as children, that is not likely to
cause harmful effects during a lifetime) is 500-fold higher at
2 mg/kg/day (US EPA 1993). The geometric mean systemic
glyphosate dose for applicators is 0.0001 mg/kg/day.
Statistical considerations
In addition to the potential study biases discussed above,
other threats to validity arise from the statistical procedures
used (or not used) in the epidemiology studies reviewed for
glyphosate. First, glyphosate risk estimates in several studies
were based on small numbers of events in the exposure sub-
categories considered. For example, the case-control studies
of NHL reported by Hardell et al. (2002), Cocco et al. (2013),
and Eriksson et al. (2008) and of MM reported by Orsi et al.
(2009) involved less than 10 exposed cases and/or controls

 overall or in specific glyphosate exposure categories. Even
the large cohort study of 57 311 pesticide applicators con-
ducted by De Roos et al. (2005) and reanalyzed by Sorahan
(2015) included sparse data (viz., 10 or fewer glyphosate-
exposed MM cases in each of the three exposure categories
considered).
Sparse data not only leads to imprecise risk estimates, but
can decrease their validity when analyses are limited to
asymptotic procedures (Greenland et al. 2000; Hirji 2006). The
phenomenon of a bias away from the null due to small sam-
ples or sparse data is termed sparse data bias. It can occur if
case-control or cohort studies are analyzed by conventional
asymptotic methods such as logistic regression or Poisson
regression rather than their counterparts based on exact esti-
mation. For example, in the presence of sparse data, the esti-
mated
OR
derived
from
asymptotic
conditional
logistic
regression is substantially overestimated if the true OR is
greater than one (Breslow & Day 1980). Sparse data bias also
affects estimated CIs and p values (Greenland et al. 2000;
Subbiah & Srinivasan 2008). It appears that all studies involv-
ing sparse data relied upon asymptotic procedures only, and
were thus likely subject to sparse data bias and inflated risk
estimates.
As shown in Table 4, with few exceptions, the statistical
models used to evaluate NHL or MM risks among pesticide-
exposed individuals were deficient at many levels. As all stud-
ies were exploratory (viz. not testing a priori hypotheses
regarding specific pesticide exposures and NHL or MM risk),
they produced a large number of risk estimates along with a
high probability of some estimates being statistically signifi-
cant simply due to chance alone. No attempt was made in
any of the studies to adjust p values for these multiple com-
parisons, though one case control study (De Roos et al. 2003)
used a two stage hierarchical modeling approach to adjust
risk estimates based on pesticide class characteristics and
extant carcinogenic classification to minimize false positives.
Also, as shown in Table 4, most studies did not adjust gly-
phosate risk estimates for potential confounding by other
pesticide exposures or relevant medical variables, and only
one (Eriksson et al. 2008) considered latency period or the
time between first (or last) glyphosate exposure and health
outcome. Moreover, only one study (Hohenadel et al. 2011),
considered the possible interaction or effect modification
between pairs of commonly used pesticides.
Even among the few studies that incorporated potential
confounding or effect modifying factors, little if any informa-
tion was provided about the statistical model selection (e.g.
asymptotic or exact), model building strategy (e.g. criteria for
including/excluding co-variables) or the diagnostic proce-
dures used to evaluate the fit or robustness of intermediate
and final models. Thus, in most studies, reported glyphosate
risk
estimates
remained
relatively
crude
(viz.
not
fully
adjusted) and likely biased due to residual confounding, poor
model fit and in some cases, sparse data.
NHL studies
Cantor et al. (1992) conducted a NHL case control study in
Iowa and Minnesota to evaluate possible causal factors,
including pesticides. The data from this study were pooled
with two other US NHL case control studies and subsequently
reported by De Roos et al. (2003). We defer consideration to
that more recent analysis.
Nordstrom et al. (1998) conducted a population-based
case control study in Sweden that included 121 cases of hairy
cell leukemia (HCL) and 484 general population controls. The
intent of the study was to evaluate occupational exposures
and smoking as risk factors for HCL. The data from this study
are included with data from the Hardell and Eriksson (1999)
study in a later publication (Hardell et al. 2002). We defer
consideration of both primary studies to that more recent
analysis.
McDuffie et al. (2001) conducted a trans-Canada multi-cen-
ter case control study to evaluate the relationship between
pesticide exposures and NHL. Cases (n ¼ 517) were identified
from provincial Cancer Registries except in Quebec, for which
hospital ascertainment was used. Controls (n ¼ 1506) were
selected at random from the provincial Health Insurance
records (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec), compu-
terized telephone listings (Ontario) or voters’ lists (British
Columbia). Participation was much higher among invited
cases (67%) than among invited controls (48%). Pesticide
exposure was determined through telephone interviews of
study participants or their proxies (21% of cases, 15% of con-
trols). The authors used conditional logistic regression to esti-
mate ORs. The OR for any reported glyphosate use was 1.2
(95% CI 0.8–1.7) controlling for age, province and medical
variables associated with NHL. The strongest pesticide associ-
ations
were
with
mecoprop
(OR ¼ 2.3)
and
dicamba
(OR ¼ 1.9). A subsequent analysis by reported days of use per
year (none, �2 days/year, >2 days/year) showed glyphosate
ORs of 1.0, 1.0 (95% CI 0.6–1.6), and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3–2.7),
respectively. This latter analysis did not adjust for medical
variables that were controlled in the analysis of any glypho-
sate use or for the effects of other pesticides.
Assessment: The strengths of this study are the relatively large
number of NHL cases and the likelihood that almost all cases
were confirmed histologically. The limitations are likely residual
confounding in the analysis by days of use by the uncontrolled
effects of medical variables and other pesticides, selection bias
(differential participation by cases and more proxies for cases),
and possible recall bias.
Hardell et al. (2002) reported a pooled analysis of two case
control studies; one of NHL and the other of HCL. Both of
these studies were previously reported as separate case-con-
trol studies (Nordstrom et al. 1998; Hardell & Eriksson 1999).
HCL is rare, comprising 2% of lymphoid leukemias, and typic-
ally affects middle aged to elderly men (Foucar et al. 2008). It
is regarded as a mature B cell neoplasm, as are a high pro-
portion of NHLs. It appears that the authors pooled the two
separate studies principally to achieve a larger study size
under the assumption that the two neoplasms could be
treated as a homogeneous entity for etiologic research.
However, the pooled analysis is thereby heavily weighted by
HCL cases and the results not representative of NHL more
broadly. The 404 NHL cases were males aged 25 and older,
diagnosed in 1987–1990, and living in mid- and northern
Sweden,
drawn
from
regional
cancer
registries
(viz.

 histologically verified). Each case was matched on age and
sex to two controls drawn from the National Population
Registry. The 111 HCL cases were males diagnosed in
1987–1990, identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry cov-
ering the whole country. Each HCL case was matched on age,
sex and county to four controls drawn from the National
Population Registry. A total of 515 cases and 1141 controls
were included in pooled analyses of NHL and HCL. A ques-
tionnaire was completed by study subjects or next-of-kin
regarding complete working history and exposure to various
chemicals. Exposure to each chemical was dichotomized, with
at least one working day a year before diagnosis being
regarded as positive for exposure. Conditional logistic regres-
sion was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for
study (NHL versus HCL), study area, and vital status. In the
analyses, only subjects with no pesticide exposure were
regarded as unexposed4, whereas subjects who had not used
glyphosate but had used other pesticides were excluded.
Analysis for glyphosate, unadjusted for other pesticides,
showed a positive association (OR ¼ 3.0, 95% CI 1.1–8.5)
based on eight exposed cases and eight exposed controls.
Although multivariate analyses were done, it was not stated
how variables were selected for inclusion or which variables
were included in the multivariate models. The multivariate
model for glyphosate indicated appreciable confounding in
the unadjusted analysis and a reduced, statistically imprecise,
positive association for glyphosate (OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI 0.6–6.2).
Analyses based on increasing days of use were presented for
some pesticides, but not for glyphosate.
Assessment: The strengths of this study were that cases were
histologically confirmed and controls were population-based. The
limitations of this publication were many. First, the investigators
found a positive association for every class of pesticide and for
every individual pesticide, suggesting a systematic bias in either
the assessment of exposure (e.g. recall bias, interviewer or subject
(inadvertent) unblinding), in the reporting of results, or due to
selection bias. Second, the definition of unexposed (viz. no
exposure to any pesticide) used in the analysis distorted the
exposure prevalence for glyphosate and precluded being able to
control for possible confounding by other pesticides and farming
exposures. Third, there seems to be some inconsistency in
exposure assessment between the two studies that were pooled
in this publication. The prevalence of exposure to glyphosate was
three times higher among HCL cases and controls (1.3%) than it
was among NHL study subjects (0.4%), even though both studies
were contemporaneous and would be expected to have similar
exposure prevalences.
De Roos et al. (2003) reported a pooled analysis of three
NHL case-control studies of pesticides and other potential
causal factors (Hoar et al. 1986; Zahm et al. 1990; Cantor
et al. 1992). This analysis was limited to men and excluded
cases and controls with a history of living or working on a
farm before (but not after) age 18. Cases from the Nebraska
study by Zahm et al. (1990) were diagnosed between July
1983 and June 1986 and were identified using the Nebraska
Lymphoma Study Group as well as data from area hospitals.
Cases from the Kansas study by Hoar et al. (1986) represented
a random sample of cases diagnosed between 1979 and
1981 and selected from the Kansas Cancer Data Service.
Cases from the study in Iowa and Minnesota by Cantor et al.
(1992) were diagnosed between 1981 and 1983 and were
identified from the Iowa State Health Registry along with a
surveillance system established in Minnesota. Controls for
these studies were randomly selected from population data-
bases (e.g. Medicare, random digit dialing, and state mortality
files for deceased cases) and frequency matched to cases on
race, sex, age and vital status at time of interview. Cases and
controls were interviewed (including next-of-kin when neces-
sary) regarding use of pesticides and/or herbicides as well as
other known or suspected risk factors for NHL. The final ana-
lysis dataset included 650 cases and 1933 controls, after
exclusions of individuals for whom there was missing infor-
mation. Forty-seven pesticides were included in the analysis
after excluding pesticides for which there were not at least
20 persons exposed and data available from all three studies.
The exposure metric in the analysis was restricted to any
reported use of a specific pesticide, with no consideration of
extent of use. Two types of statistical models were used to
estimate ORs and 95% CIs: (1) standard logistic regression
and (2) hierarchical regression, wherein logistic regression
estimates
were
adjusted
in
a
second
stage
based
on
expected similarities of effects within pesticide classes and
the presumed a priori carcinogenic probability for specific
pesticides as determined by external review bodies. For pesti-
cides like glyphosate that were presumed to have a low
probability of being carcinogenic, this second stage adjust-
ment tended to draw positive associations toward the null.
All analyses were adjusted for age and for the use of 46 other
pesticides. Results for glyphosate showed an OR of 2.1 (95%
CI: 1.1–4.0) in the logistic regression and a lesser association
(OR ¼ 1.6, 95% CI: 0.9–2.8) in the hierarchical regression.
Assessment: The strengths of this analysis were the histological
confirmation of NHL cases and the large numbers of cases and
controls that enabled simultaneous adjustment of the effects of
47 pesticides. The weaknesses of this study were the reliance on a
relatively
crude
indicator
of
exposure
(ever
having
used
a
pesticide with no consideration of the extent of use) and the
limitations common to case control studies of pesticides – namely
recall bias and, in this case, an appreciably higher proportion of
proxy respondents for controls than cases (40% versus 31%).
De Roos et al. (2005) reported glyphosate findings from
the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a large prospective
cohort study of health outcomes related to numerous pesti-
cides among more than 53 000 licensed pesticide applicators
in North Carolina and Iowa. Analyses for glyphosate consid-
ered potential exposure in a number of ways including: ever/
never use, estimated cumulative exposure days (CED), and
estimated intensity-weighted exposure days (IWED). The stat-
istical approach was Poisson regression and effects were esti-
mated as RRs with 95% CIs. After adjusting for age, findings
for ever/never use of glyphosate showed a near null RR of
1.2 for NHL (95% CI 0.7–1.9), based on 92 cases. Further
adjustment for education level, pack-years of smoking, alco-
hol use in last 12 months, family history of cancer, state of
residence and 10 other pesticides that were correlated with
glyphosate use, and excluding applicators who had missing
data for any of these variables, had little effect on findings
for NHL (RR 1.1 95% CI 0.7–1.9). Analyses of potential expo-
sure–response effects using the first tertile of CEDs as a base-
line category and with adjustments as described above, and
CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY

 excluding the never-users from the analysis, found a slight
non-significant negative trend (1–20 days: RR 1.0; 21–56 days:
RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.4; 57–2678 days: RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5–1.6).
These categorical analyses were repeated for IWEDs and find-
ings were little changed. De Roos et al. (2005) qualified their
results as being based on small numbers, but concluded: “ …
the available data provided evidence of no association
between glyphosate exposure and NHL incidence.”
Assessment: The strengths of this study are the large size of the
study cohort, the high quality assessment of cancer incidence
based on statewide registries in Iowa and North Carolina, the lack
of proxy respondents, the control for confounding by other
pesticides, and the fact that collection of information about
pesticide use could not be influenced by health status. The
limitations of the study are the relatively short duration of follow-
up for AHS cohort members, the relatively small number of NHL
cases,
and
the
likelihood
of
some
degree
of
exposure
misclassification in the various analyses.
Eriksson et al. (2008) reported a population based case
control study of NHL in males and females aged 18–74 living
in Sweden in 1999–2002. Cases were identified through
physicians who diagnosed and treated NHL, and all cases
were histologically verified. Controls were randomly chosen
from population registries in the same health service regions
as the cases, and were frequency matched in 10-year age
and sex groups. A total of 910 NHL cases and 1016 controls
were included in the analyses. The authors emphasized that,
in contrast to their previous studies (Hardell et al. 1981;
Hardell & Eriksson 1999), the analyses evaluated newer types
of pesticides in relation to different histopathological sub-
types of NHL. All subjects received a mailed questionnaire
focusing on total work history and exposure to pesticides,
solvents and other chemicals. For all pesticides, the number
of years, number of days per year and length of exposure per
day were questioned. Exposure to each chemical was dicho-
tomized, with at least one working day at least a year before
diagnosis being regarded as positive. In the analyses, only
subjects with no pesticide exposure were regarded as unex-
posed5, whereas subjects with other pesticide exposures
were excluded. Unconditional logistic regression was used to
calculate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and year of
diagnosis. Analyses for individual herbicides showed positive
associations for every agent and ORs were elevated for every
other pesticide (although not in every analysis by NHL sub-
type or category of duration of exposure). In the model for
glyphosate and all NHL (not adjusted for other exposures),
the OR was 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.7 for ever/never exposure,
based
on
29
exposed
cases
and
18
exposed
controls.
Exposure to glyphosate for >10 days showed OR ¼ 2.4, 95%
CI 1.0–5.4 (not adjusted for other exposures). Analyses of gly-
phosate exposure and NHL subtypes (not adjusted for other
exposures) were positive for every subtype of NHL, and were
statistically
significant
for
lymphocytic
lymphoma/B-CLL
(OR ¼ 3.4, 95% CI 1.4–7.9) and unspecified NHL (OR ¼ 5.6,
95% CI 1.4–22.0). Results for other NHL subtypes were not
statistically
significant:
all
B-cell
NHL
(OR ¼ 1.9,
95%
CI
0.998–3.5); follicular NHL (OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI 0.6–5.8); DLBCL
(OR ¼ 1.2, 95% CI 0.4–3.4); other B-cell NHL (OR ¼ 1.6, 95% CI
0.5–5.0); unspecified B-cell NHL (OR ¼ 1.5, 95% CI 0.3–6.6) and
T-cell NHL (OR ¼ 2.3, 95% CI 0.5–10.4). Multivariate analysis of
glyphosate exposure was stated to include agents with statis-
tically significant increased ORs or with an OR >1.5 and at
least 10 exposed subjects. These models excluded subjects
with exposure to pesticides that did not meet these condi-
tions. The multivariate model for glyphosate and all NHL
showed a non-significant positive association (OR ¼ 1.5, 95%
CI 0.8–2.9) for ever/never exposure, indicating substantial
confounding in the analysis that were not adjusted for other
pesticides.
Assessment:
Strengths
of
the
study
include
histological
verification of cases and use of population-based controls. There
were,
however,
a
couple
of
major
limitations.
First,
the
investigators found a positive association for every herbicide and
for every individual pesticide (although not in every sub-analysis),
suggesting a systematic bias in either the assessment of exposure
(e.g. recall bias, interviewer or subject [inadvertent] unblinding), in
the reporting of results, or due to selection bias. Second, the
definition of unexposed (viz. no exposure to any pesticide) used
in the analysis distorted the exposure prevalence for glyphosate
for cases and controls and precluded being able to control for
possible confounding by other pesticides and farming exposures.
Hohenadel et al. (2011) conducted a reanalysis of data
included in the McDuffie publication to evaluate the relation-
ship between exposure to specific pesticide combinations
and NHL. The authors used unconditional logistic regression
to estimate ORs for the total number of pesticides used by
type and carcinogenic potential and for pairwise pesticide
combinations (neither, either only or both). Where the OR for
joint exposure was higher than the OR for exposure to either
pesticide alone, interaction on the additive scale was eval-
uated using an interaction contrast ratio (ICR). Exposure to
glyphosate alone yielded an estimated 8% deficit in NHL risk
(OR ¼ 0.92, 95% CI 0.5–1.6), whereas use of malathion only
was associated with an elevated NHL risk (OR ¼ 2.0, 95% CI
1.3–2.9). The OR of 2.1 (95% CI 1.3–3.4) for joint exposure to
glyphosate and malathion was similar to that for malathion
alone and there was no indication of a super additive joint
effect (ICR <0.5).
Assessment: The strengths and limitations of this study are
similar to those outlined for the related study by McDuffie et al.
(2001). The re-analysis was more an exploratory assessment of
joint exposures than it was a study of specific pesticides per se
and is of limited relevance for a possible association between
glyphosate and risk of NHL.
Orsi et al. (2009) reported a hospital-based case-control
study of occupational exposure to pesticides and lymphoid
neoplasms (including but not limited to NHL and MM) under-
taken in France. Incident cases of NHL (n ¼ 244) were identi-
fied from six French hospital center catchment areas between
2000 and 2004. A panel of pathologists and hematologists
confirmed pathology. Controls (n ¼ 436) were selected from
the same hospitals as cases; controls had no history of
lymphoid
neoplasms
and
were
primarily
patients
from
rheumatology and orthopedic departments. Patients admitted
for occupation-related diseases or diseases related to smoking
and/or alcohol abuse were not eligible as controls although a
past history of such diseases/conditions did not eliminate the
control. Controls were matched to cases by center, age (±3
years)
and
gender.

 involved a standardized self-administered questionnaire on
socioeconomic status, family medical history, and lifelong
residential and occupational histories. For additional informa-
tion (on personal and family history), smoking, alcohol, tea
and coffee consumption, use of pesticides (insecticides, fungi-
cides, and herbicides) as well as detailed questions about
work on farms, a trained interviewer performed a face-to-face
interview with cases and controls. Two exposure definitions
were used: definite or possible. Duration of exposure was
estimated. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using logistic
regression. Results for any use of glyphosate and NHL
showed no association (OR ¼ 1.0, 95% CI: 0.5–2.2) based on
12 exposed cases and 24 exposed controls.
Assessment: A strength of this study is that the NHL cases were
confirmed histologically. The limitations are no assessment of
potential confounding due to the uncontrolled effects of other
pesticides/exposures,
possible
recall
bias
and
selection
bias
(controls
were
primarily
selected

and

represented).
Scanning
the
ensemble
of
hundreds
of
effect
estimates shows that the vast majority of estimates (though not
for glyphosate) were greater than one, suggesting systematic
error across the various analyses.
Cocco et al. (2013) reported results from the EPILYMPH
case control study of NHL in six European countries, con-
ducted in 1998–2004. The study included 2348 incident
lymphoma cases and 2462 controls. Approximately 20% of
the cases had their tissue slides reviewed by a central panel
of pathologists. Controls were population-based in Germany

dence
area.
Hospital
controls
were
used
in
the
Czech
Republic, France, Ireland and Spain, excluding patients with
diagnoses of cancer, infectious disease, and immunodefi-
ciency. The participation rate was 88% in cases, 81% in hos-
pital
controls,
but
only
52%
in
population
controls
in
Germany and Italy (Cocco et al. 2010). Trained interviewers
conducted in-person interviews with a structured question-
naire regarding full time jobs held for a year or longer.
Industrial hygienists coded the occupations to the ISCO,
International Labour Office (1968) and the NACE, Statistical
Office of the European Communities (1996) classifications.
Subjects who reported having worked in agriculture were
given a job-specific module inquiring in detail about tasks,
kinds of crops, size of cultivated area, pests being treated,
pesticides used, procedures of crop treatment, use of per-
sonal protective equipment, reentry after application and fre-
quency of treatment in days/year. Hygienists reviewed the
job modules to assess exposure to pesticides in categories.
Exposure was scored in terms of confidence (probability and
proportion of workers exposed), intensity and frequency. A
cumulative exposure score was calculated. Subjects unex-
posed to any pesticide6 were the referent category for all
analyses. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calcu-
late ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, gender, education
and study center. The authors reported a moderate associ-
ation between glyphosate (ever/never exposure) and B-cell
NHL (OR ¼ 3.1, 95% CI 0.6–17.1) in a univariate analysis that
was statistically imprecise being based on only four exposed
cases and two exposed controls. Clearly, there were too few
exposed cases and controls to estimate an OR for glyphosate
controlling for other exposures.
Assessment: Glyphosate exposure was so infrequent in this study
that it precluded an informative analysis. Were that not the case,
there would have been obvious concerns about selection bias
(esp.
low
participation
for
controls),
confounding
by
other
exposures (esp. solvent exposures found to be associated with
NHL is a previous analysis of this data (Cocco et al. 2010), and
recall bias. In addition, the definition of unexposed (viz. no
exposure to any pesticide) used in the analysis distorted the
exposure prevalence for glyphosate and would have precluded
being able to control for possible confounding by other pesticides
and farming exposures had such analyses been attempted.
MM studies
Brown et al. (1993) conducted a re-analysis of the National
Cancer Institute Iowa population-based case-control study
(Brown et al. 1990; Cantor et al. 1992) to evaluate the rela-
tionship between exposure to specific pesticides and MM.
Cases (n ¼ 173) were identified from the Iowa Health Registry.
Controls (n ¼ 650) were frequency matched to cases by age
group and vital status at interview and selected from three
sources: random digit dialing (living cases under age 65);
Medicare records (living cases aged 65þ) and state death cer-
tificate files (for deceased cases). Participation was relatively
high and similar among cases (84%) and controls (78%).
Pesticide exposure for 34 crop insecticides, 38 herbicides
(including glyphosate) and 16 fungicides was determined
from in-person interviews with subjects or their proxies. The
authors used unconditional logistic regression to estimate
ORs for pesticides handled by at least five cases. Subjects
who did not farm7 were the referent exposure category for
these analyses. The OR for mixing, handling or applying gly-
phosate was 1.7 (95% CI 0.8–3.6) adjusted for vital status and
age. Failure to use protective equipment (obtained from
interviews) did not appreciably increase the risk for glypho-
sate (OR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI not reported). None of the pesticides
considered showed a statistically significant association with
MM risk.
Assessment:
Strengths
of
the
study
were
the
histological
confirmation of cases and the high and similar participation for
cases and controls. Study limitations were its exploratory nature
(as
noted
by
the
authors),
lack
of
control
for
potential
confounding by possibly relevant personal characteristics or by
exposure to other pesticides, and possible recall bias. In addition,
the definition of unexposed (viz. non-farmers) used in the analysis
excluded 64% of cases and 58% of controls, distorted the
exposure prevalence for glyphosate, and would have precluded
being able to control for possible confounding by other pesticides
and farming exposures had the investigators sought to control
potential confounding.
De Roos et al. (2005), based on data from the AHS cohort
study described previously, estimated the age-adjusted RR for
glyphosate and MM to be 1.1 (95% CI 0.5–2.4), based on 32
cases. Further adjustment for education level, pack-years of
smoking, alcohol use in the last 12 months, family history of
cancer and state of residence, together with the use of 10
other pesticides that were correlated with glyphosate use,
and excluding approximately 14 000 applicators and 13 MM
cases with missing data for any of these variables, markedly

37
 increased the RR for MM (RR ¼2.6, 95% CI 0.7–9.4). Analyses
of exposure–response effects using the first tertile of CEDs as
a baseline category and with adjustments as described above,
and excluding the never-users from the analysis, produced a
non-significant positive trend (1–20 days: RR ¼1.0; 21–56
days: RR ¼1.1, 95% CI 0.4–3.5; 57–2678 days: RR ¼ 1.9, 95% CI
0.6–6.3; p values for trend 0.27). This MM CED analysis was
based on 19 (of 32) cases, the other 41% of cases being
excluded for any missing covariate information. These analy-
ses were repeated for IWED categories and findings were lit-
tle changed (RRs 1.0, 1.2, and 2.1; p values for trend ¼ 0.17).
The authors also repeated the exposure–response analyses
for MM, using the never-use group as the baseline category
and found a monotonic positive trend (tertile 1: RR ¼ 2.3;
95% CI 0.6–8.9; tertile 2: RR ¼ 2.6; 95% CI, 0.6–11.5; tertile 3:
RR ¼ 4.4; 95% CI 1.0–20.2; p values for trend ¼ 0.09). The
authors noted that the marked difference between the age
adjusted MM findings and the more fully adjusted findings
(viz. RR ¼ 1.1 versus 2.6) could have been due to selection
bias related to the 14 000 AHS cohort members who were
dropped from the more fully adjusted analysis due to missing
values for one or more variables.
Assessment: The strengths of this study are the large size of the
study cohort, the high quality assessment of cancer incidence
based on statewide registries in Iowa and North Carolina, the lack
of proxy respondents, the control for confounding by other
pesticides, and the fact that collection of information about
pesticide use could not be influenced by health status. The
limitations of the study are the short duration of follow-up for
AHS cohort members, the relatively small number of MM cases,
the likelihood of some degree of exposure misclassification in the
various analyses, and the indications of selection bias affecting RR
estimates due to the exclusion of so many cohort members and
MM cases from the more fully adjusted analyses (addressed in a
subsequent publication by Sorahan 2015).
Orsi et al. (2009) reported a French hospital-based case-
control study of occupational exposure to pesticides and
lymphoid neoplasms (including but not limited to NHL and
MM), described previously. Included were 56 incident cases of
MM and 313 controls matched to cases by center, age (±3
years) and gender. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using
logistic regression. Results for glyphosate and MM showed a
moderate, but statistically imprecise, association (OR ¼ 2.4,
95% CI: 0.8–7.3) based on five exposed cases and 18 exposed
controls.
Assessment: A strength of this study is that the MM cases were
confirmed
histologically.
The
limitations
are
likely
residual
confounding due to the uncontrolled effects of other pesticides/
exposures in the assessment of the OR for glyphosate, possible
recall bias, and selection bias (controls were primarily selected
from orthopedic and rheumatological departments where general
population prevalence of pesticide exposure would likely be
under-represented). Scanning the ensemble of hundreds of ORs
shows that the vast majority was greater than 1.0, suggesting
systematic error across the various analyses.
Landgren et al. (2009) estimated the age-specific preva-
lence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signifi-
cance (MGUS) (a medical condition that is sometimes a
precursor to multiple myeloma) among a stratified random
sample of 678 AHS participants selected based on lifetime
organophosphate use. Subjects in the sample had completed
all three phases of the AHS questionnaires, were enrolled into
a neurobehavioral study nested within the AHS cohort, and
had provided serum for analysis. The authors compared
MGUS prevalence for this sample to that for the general
population of Olmsted County, Minnesota (due to availability
of Mayo Clinic MGUS screening data) and found higher
prevalence for AHS participants. Within the AHS sample, asso-
ciations between MGUS prevalence and pesticide exposures
and subject characteristics were assessed in logistic regres-
sion models adjusted for age and education level. The preva-
lence OR for MGUS for glyphosate users versus non-users,
adjusted for age and education level, was 0.5 (95% CI
0.2–1.0). None of the herbicides studied showed a strong
association with MGUS.
Assessment: This is a small exploratory study of pesticide effects
on a medical condition that is sometimes a precursor to MM.
Taken at face value, the results provide evidence of a weak
inverse association between risk of MGUS and glyphosate, though
the exploratory nature of this study, the lack of adjustment for
other pesticides in pesticide-specific analyses, the cross-sectional
nature of the study, and the implied speculative hypothesis
underlying the analysis (that pesticides might cause MM by
causing MGUS first) limit conclusions that can be drawn from this
work.
Pahwa et al. (2012) reported a trans-Canada, multi-center
case control study regarding the relationship between pesti-
cide exposures and MM. The publication is related to the
trans-Canada NHL study reported initially by McDuffie et al.
(2001) wherein there was a common control group for the
study of several lymphopoietic cancers. Pahwa et al. (2012)
was updated by Kachuri et al. (2013) and we defer consider-
ation to that more recent publication.
Kachuri et al. (2013) presented a reanalysis and extension of
Pahwa et al. (2012) in which they excluded 149 (of 1506) con-
trols who did not have an age match with the MM cases.
Kachuri et al. utilized unconditional logistic regression to esti-
mate ORs and presented analyses including and excluding
proxy respondents (15% of controls and 30% of cases) and
adjusting for smoking, which was associated with MM. They
also presented analyses by days of use for individual pesti-
cides. Approximately 9% of cases and controls reported use of
glyphosate. ORs adjusted for smoking were 1.2 (95% CI
0.8–1.9) including all cases and controls and 1.1 (95% CI
0.7–1.9) excluding cases and controls who had proxy respond-
ents. ORs excluding proxy respondents for one and two days/
year of glyphosate use and for two or more days/year were 0.7
(95% CI 0.4–1.3) in the lower use category and 2.0 (95% CI
0.98–4.2) in the higher use category. However, these results
for days of use per year were not adjusted for the potential
confounding effects of other pesticides or farm exposures.
Assessment: The strengths of this study are the relatively large
number of MM cases, the likelihood that almost all cases were
confirmed histologically, and the explicit consideration of proxy
respondents in the analysis. The limitations are likely residual
confounding in the
days of
use per year
analysis
by the
uncontrolled effects of other pesticides/exposures, selection bias
(58% participation for cases and 48% participation for controls),
and possible recall bias.
Sorahan (2015) conducted a re-analysis of data from the
AHS to assess the basis for the disparate age-adjusted and
38
J. ACQUAVELLA ET AL.
 more fully adjusted glyphosate MM findings reported by De
Roos et al. (2005). The author used Poisson regression to
estimate RRs for MM in relation to glyphosate exposure
categorized as ever versus never exposed and by levels of
CEDs and IWEDs. Applicators who had missing covariate
data were included in the analysis in a “not known” cat-
egory so that the entire AHS cohort could be maintained.
The RR for any glyphosate use adjusted for age and gender
was 1.1 (95% CI 0.5–2.5); further adjusting for lifestyle factors
and use of 10 other pesticides yielded a similar RR of 1.2
(95% CI 0.5–2.9). RRs for MM tended to increase with
increasing CED and IWED reaching a peak RR of 1.9 (95% CI
0.7–5.3; p values for trend ¼ 0.2) in the highest category of
IWED in the fully adjusted model; however, none of the
trend tests or category-specific RRs was statistically signifi-
cant. This reanalysis showed that selection bias was associ-
ated with inflated MM risk estimates in the paper by De
Roos et al. (2005). Those excluded from the analysis included
five of eight MM cases in the glyphosate never use category.
Sorahan’s secondary analysis of this AHS data does not sup-
port the hypothesis that glyphosate use is a risk factor for
MM and indicates that the practice of restricting analyses to
subjects with complete data for all variables can produce
appreciable bias.
Assessment: This reanalysis answers some of the questions about
the impact of selection bias in the MM analysis by De Roos et al.
(2005). Given that there were only 32 MM cases in the original
publication, there are obvious limitations to analyses by estimated
extent of exposure that can only be addressed with analyses of
the AHS cohort using more recent follow-up data.
A special consideration: selection bias in
the analysis
According to accepted case control theory (Rothman et al.
2008), the validity of case control studies depends on accur-
ately estimating the exposure prevalence in the population
that gave rise to the cases. Exposure prevalence cannot be
estimated accurately by excluding from the analysis cases
and controls with farm exposures other than glyphosate as
was done in several studies. This practice distorts the glypho-
sate exposure prevalence for cases and controls and biases
OR estimates. We illustrate this bias using data from such a
glyphosate analysis by Brown et al. (1993).
Brown et al. (1993) analyzed a case control study that had
173 MM cases and 650 controls. Of these, 11 of 173 cases
(6%) and 40 of 650 controls (6%) reported use of glyphosate.
Hence, there was no difference in exposure prevalence for
cases and controls. However, the authors calculated ORs
using non-farmers as the referent population with the ration-
ale that they were not exposed to any farm activities. This
seemingly well-intentioned modification of the referent popu-
lation violates a fundamental premise that underlies the val-
idity of case control studies – that controls should be drawn
from the population that gave rise to the cases, which, of
course, includes individuals with exposure to farm activities.
With these exclusions 100 of 173 cases (58%) and 338 of 650
controls (52%), the glyphosate exposure prevalence for cases
was increased to 15% (11 of 73 cases) and the glyphosate
exposure prevalence for controls was increased a lesser
amount to 13% (40 of 312 controls). This created a bias away
from the null as illustrated in Tables 5 and 6 in our OR ana-
lysis of the Brown et al. data with and without restriction of
the referent group to those not exposed to any farm related
activities (using Stata version 14).
Ironically, the reason for the clear bias away from the null
is that those with exposure to farm related activities and who
did not use glyphosate had higher MM risks than farmers
who used glyphosate. In addition, by excluding those without
exposure to glyphosate and exposure to other farm expo-
sures, the authors would have precluded being able to con-
trol fully for confounding had they attempted multivariate
analyses of pesticide exposures. Hardell et al. (2002), Eriksson
et al. (2008) and Cocco et al. (2013) made similar exclusions,
defining their referent population as those not exposed to
pesticides (other than glyphosate). The limited data presented
in those papers did not permit us to address statistically the
direction and extent of the bias as we have for Brown et al.
(1993).
In a similar vein, Sorahan’s reanalysis of the MM data from
the cohort analysis by De Roos et al. (2005) provides another
example of selection bias in the analysis that produced an
appreciable bias away from the null. In this case, Sorahan
(2015) showed that excluding those with any missing covari-
ate data increased the adjusted RR from 1.1 to 2.6, largely by
excluding five of eight MM cases from the glyphosate unex-
posed population.
Weight of evidence evaluation
Descriptive summary
We systematically collected, summarized and critiqued 16
analytical epidemiological publications examining aspects of
the possible relationship between reported use of glyphosate
and two cancer types: NHL and MM. We excluded redundant
publications (Cantor et al. 1992; Nordstrom et al. 1998;
Hardell & Eriksson 1999; Pahwa et al. 2012) in favor of more
recent published analyses of the same subjects. This resulted
in a final evaluative dataset of seven studies of glyphosate
exposure and NHL (see Table 2) and four studies of glypho-
sate exposure and MM (see Table 3), considering the Sorahan
publication (2015) as an extension of De Roos et al. (2005).

CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
39
 The descriptive characteristics of each of these studies
were examined for the likely presence or absence of validity
concerns (see Table 4). It is clear from Table 4 that only one
study in the glyphosate literature (highlighted in Table 4) –
the AHS cohort study (De Roos et al. 2005) – was designed to
minimize selection bias and recall bias, had only firsthand
respondents
reporting
about
exposures
(viz.
no
proxy
respondents), and conducted analyses that controlled compre-
hensively for confounding by personal characteristics and
occupational exposures. In addition, the AHS cohort study was
the only study that attempted to look at exposure–response
relationships while controlling for confounding exposures. As
such, it deserves the highest weight in our assessment of the
literature. The other studies have so many validity concerns
that they cannot be interpreted at face value. Indeed, there is
evidence in many of these studies that virtually every expos-
ure studied was associated with NHL or MM – a clear indica-
tion of widespread systematic bias and the unreliability of any
of the reported exposure-disease associations.
We note one potential limitation to our systematic review.
Although we were careful to systematically search the exist-
ing literature using search terms and secondary sources to
identify relevant studies, it is possible that some relevant
studies were not identified. Given the focus on glyphosate
epidemiology by IARC and the authors of two recent meta-
analyses, included among our secondary sources, we think
this potential limitation is unlikely to be consequential.
Assessment of causality
The assessment of causality is a complex process that relies
upon a family of well-recognized methods: the general scien-
tific method (familiar to all scientists), study design and statis-
tical methods, and research synthesis methods (e.g. the
systematic narrative review, meta-analysis and pooled ana-
lysis, and the so-called criteria-based methods of causal infer-
ence).
Of
these,
the
criteria-based
methods
are
often
described and considered in causal assessments, with the
most familiar having been proposed by Hill (1965) and uti-
lized extensively in the 1964 Surgeon General’s Committee
on Smoking and Health and the many publications on the
topic that dotted the scientific landscape in the late 1950s
and early 1960s (Surgeon General 1964; Weed 2005). These
“criteria” or “considerations” are substantive components of
the stated methodologies of agencies such as the US EPA
(2005) and IARC (2015).
At the center of these methods is the fundamental scien-
tific aim of selecting the best explanation from the alternative
explanations that exist for any body of scientific observations,
however carefully they were obtained. In epidemiological
terms, those alternative explanations typically are defined as
cause, bias, confounding (a type of bias) and chance. Some
studies are better at excluding alternative explanations than
others; cohort studies, for example, are typically better at
avoiding recall bias than interview based case-control studies,
and recall bias affects not only the exposure of interest (here,
glyphosate) but
also
potential
confounding
factors (e.g.
exposure to other pesticides). Similarly, any and all epidemio-
logic study designs can – and should – control statistically for
factors believed to be potential alternative explanations, i.e.
known and putative confounders. For example, studying gly-
phosate and any lymphohematopoietic cancer without con-
trolling
for
the
potential
confounding
effects
of
other
pesticides and herbicides, as was widely the case for almost
all of the case control studies, does not permit one to
exclude those confounders as an alternative explanation. And
finally, if the results of an epidemiologic study (whether case-
control or cohort) fail to achieve conventional levels of statis-
tical significance – whether defined in terms of “p values” or
“95% CIs” – then the alternative explanation of chance can-
not be excluded. Notably, however, as Greenland (1990)
pointed out, interpretation of p values and CIs at face value
requires the assumption that a particular OR or RR has been
estimated without bias (e.g. recall bias, selection bias, or con-
founding), elevating the importance of concerns about study
validity in the interpretation of results.
In essence, all the causal frameworks in epidemiology
focus on whether the observed associations are strong (viz.
the size of the OR or RR is appreciably different than 1.0),
whether the associations appear to have been estimated
without bias, whether the OR or RR increases or decreases
with increasing exposure (viz. exposure–response), whether
the temporal relationship between exposure and effect is
considered appropriate, and whether the results are statistic-
ally robust enough to rule out chance as an explanation (Hill
1965; Bhopal 2002; Aschengrau & Seage 2003a, 2003b;
Sanderson et al. 2007).
Assessment of the NHL studies
With these considerations in mind, for NHL, it is justified sci-
entifically to rely most on the results of the De Roos et al.
(2005) cohort study as those best suited to reveal the exist-
ence (or not) of an association between exposure to glypho-
sate and NHL. This cohort study was the only study where
information about pesticide use was collected independently
of the participants’ knowledge of cancer status, where there
were no proxies providing information about pesticide use,
where exposure–response was evaluated extensively, and
where there was statistical adjustment for other pesticide
exposures and personal factors in estimating RRs for glypho-
sate. As De Roos et al. (2005) concluded “ … the available
data provided evidence of no association between glyphosate
exposure and NHL incidence.” On the other hand, all the case
control studies had the potential limitation of recall bias,
many had clear indications of selection bias (either in terms
of subject participation or in the analysis), most had very
small numbers of glyphosate exposed cases and controls,
none showed evidence of an exposure–response relationship,
and most did not control for the potential confounding
effects of personal factors or other occupational exposures
in their glyphosate risk estimates. We consider the case
control studies to be inadequate for the assessment of a
relationship between glyphosate and NHL and consider the
AHS cohort study as the one reliable evaluation of NHL
risk from glyphosate. The two limitations of the AHS study
are the relatively small number of NHL cases (n ¼ 92) and
that the length of follow-up after enrollment was less than
40
J. ACQUAVELLA ET AL.
 a decade. Those limitations speak to statistical robustness,
not validity.
Assessment for MM
The glyphosate literature for MM is appreciably sparser than
the literature for NHL. Again, the AHS cohort study (De Roos
et al. 2005) is the best source of evidence when compared
with the three available case control studies. The AHS data
indicate that glyphosate users had about the same rate of
MM as non-users adjusting for confounding factors (factoring
in Sorahan’s (2015) reanalysis of the fully adjusted MM results
from De Roos et al. (2005) to correct the inadvertent selection
bias discussed previously). Exposure–response analyses by De
Roos et al. (2005) and Sorahan (2015) were relatively unin-
formative in light of the few MM cases split among exposure
categories. More informative analyses await additional follow-
up of the AHS cohort to increase the number of MM cases.
The three MM case control studies are based on very small
numbers, have concerns about recall bias and selection bias,
and did not control for confounding by other exposures.
Overall, then, we consider this literature inadequate to make
an
informed
judgment
about
a
potential
relationship
between glyphosate and MM.
Conclusions
The purpose of this literature review was to address two
questions:
1.
Does
the
current
published
epidemiologic
evidence
establish
a
causal
relationship
between
glyphosate
exposure and NHL?
2.
Does
the
current
published
epidemiologic
evidence
establish
a
causal
relationship
between
glyphosate
exposure and MM?
Our review of the glyphosate epidemiologic literature and
the application of commonly applied causal criteria do not indi-
cate a relationship with glyphosate exposure and NHL. In add-
ition, we consider the evidence for MM to be inadequate to
judge a relationship with glyphosate. Our conclusion for NHL
differs from that of the IARC workgroup seemingly because we
considered the null NHL findings from the AHS to be more con-
vincing than the case control studies, in aggregate, with their
major limitations. We utilized a structured systematic review
approach, we formally addressed pre-specified validity criteria
for each study, and our weight of evidence assessment
employed widely utilized criteria for causal inference.
Notes
1.
A positive association has been observed between exposure to the
agent and cancer for which a causal interpretation is considered by
the Working Group to be credible, but chance, bias or confounding
could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.

Whether recall bias, exposure misclassification or selection bias was
classified as likely or unlikely was based on a consensus after an in
person discussion of each study by the authors.
4.
According to accepted case control theory (see Rothman et al.
2008), the validity of case control studies depends on accurately
estimating the exposure prevalence in the population that gave rise
to the cases. Exposure prevalence cannot be estimated accurately
by excluding from the analysis cases and controls with farm
exposures
other
than
glyphosate.
This
practice
distorts
the
glyphosate exposure prevalence for cases and controls and biases
OR estimates. We illustrate this in the section on selection bias in
the analysis using data from such an analysis by Brown et al. (1993).
In addition, excluding those with exposure to other pesticides
hinders controlling for confounding by other farming exposures and
pesticides in multivariate models.

JA worked for Monsanto from 1989 through 2004 and is a consultant
on a legal case unrelated to glyphosate that involves a former Monsanto
industrial chemical plant. DG serves on a scientific advisory board to Dow
Agro Sciences, which markets pesticides including glyphosate, and has
consulted on behalf of Bayer Corp. on litigation matters concerning gly-
phosate and leukemia. GM has no additional declarations. TS has received
consultancy fees and travel grants from Monsanto Europe SA/NV as a
member of the European Glyphosate Toxicology Advisory Panel and par-
ticipated in the IARC Monograph Meeting for volume 112, as an Observer
for the Monsanto Company. In addition, TS has consulted for Monsanto
on litigation matters involving glyphosate. DW has consulted on litigation
matters concerning Monsanto that did not involve glyphosate.
