 Did the Food Environment Cause the Obesity Epidemic?
Kevin D. Hall
Several putative explanations of the obesity epidemic relate to the changing food environment. Individual
dietary macronutrients have each been theorized to be the prime culprit for population obesity, but these
explanations are unlikely. Rather, obesity probably resulted from changes in the caloric quantity and qual-
ity of the food supply in concert with an industrialized food system that produced and marketed conven-
ient, highly processed foods from cheap agricultural inputs. Such foods often contain high amounts of
salt, sugar, fat, and flavor additives and are engineered to have supernormal appetitive properties driving
increased consumption. Ubiquitous access to convenient and inexpensive food also changed normative
eating behavior, with more people snacking, eating in restaurants, and spending less time preparing
meals at home. While such changes in the food environment provide a likely explanation of the obesity
epidemic, definitive scientific demonstration is hindered by the difficulty in experimentally isolating and
manipulating important variables at the population level.

Introduction
Body size is highly heritable, and genetics plays a substantial role in
determining individual obesity susceptibility. However, our genes
have not changed appreciably over the past several decades, imply-
ing that environmental changes must have caused the current obesity
epidemic. Here, I describe putative explanations of obesity that
focus on aspects of the food environment, including dietary macro-
nutrient composition, energy content, and the overall quality of the
food supply.
Is it the Protein?
The “protein leverage model” of obesity postulates that the body
seeks to consume a target level of dietary protein, and lowering the
protein fraction of the diet leads to compensatory increases in over-
all energy intake, thereby resulting in obesity (1). A logical conse-
quence of the protein leverage model is that providing experimental
subjects with low-protein diets should increase ad libitum energy
intake to achieve the target protein level. One study, conducted by
the originators of the protein leverage model, found a significant
short-term increase in ad libitum energy intake when a low-protein
diet was compared with a moderate-protein diet (2). However, two
larger and longer studies failed to reproduce this effect (3,4). Further
evidence against the protein leverage model is that the protein con-
tent of the food supply did not significantly decrease during the rise
in US obesity prevalence (Figure 1A-1B). Thus, the protein leverage
model of obesity does not seem to provide a satisfactory explanation
of the obesity epidemic.
Is it the Fat?
The dietary fat model of obesity postulates that increased fat con-
sumption leads to increased overall energy intake. Compared with
carbohydrates and proteins that have less than half the calories per
gram and are typically associated with water in food, fat has a high
energy density, is less satiating, and results in a smaller postprandial
increment in energy expenditure (5,6). Covert experimental increases
in dietary fat result in higher ad libitum energy intake, positive energy
balance, and the accumulation of body fat (5,6). Dietary fat does not
substantially promote its own oxidation. Therefore, increasing fat
intake results in the efficient accumulation of body fat, which is rela-
tively unopposed until adipose tissue sufficiently expands such that
daily lipolysis increases to elevate circulating fatty acids and balance
fat oxidation with fat intake (7). Decreasing the fat content of meals
leads to lower ad libitum energy intake, and experimental overfeeding
of dietary fat results in greater increases in body fat compared with
isocaloric carbohydrate overfeeding (5,6). Furthermore, dietary fat in
the food supply has increased in absolute terms during the develop-
ment of the obesity epidemic (Figure 1B).
While these experimental observations favor the dietary fat model,

Obesity
 1990s did not appear to slow the progress of the US obesity epi-
demic. Furthermore, prescribing low-fat diets does not lead to
greater weight loss when compared with other diets (8).
Is it the Carbohydrates?
The “carbohydrate-insulin model” of obesity posits that dietary car-
bohydrates are particularly fattening because of their propensity to
elevate insulin secretion and thereby direct fat toward storage in
adipose tissue and away from oxidation by metabolically active tis-
sues. These changes in energy partitioning have been postulated to
decrease energy expenditure and increase hunger, leading to the
development of obesity (9). However, experimental tests of the
carbohydrate-insulin model using isocaloric diets widely varying in
carbohydrates and fat fail to support key model predictions regard-
ing changes in energy expenditure and body fat (9,10). Nevertheless,
it is possible that the increased carbohydrates in the food supply
(Figure 1B), particularly refined carbohydrates, contributed to the
obesity epidemic by augmenting overall calorie intake.
Is it the Calories?
Experimental studies in humans demonstrate that increasing the
overall amount of food available for consumption leads to increased
ad libitum energy intake (11). Over the past several decades, per
capita US food availability increased by about two to three times
more than is required to fully explain the observed population
weight gain (Figure 1C), with the surplus food resulting in a pro-
gressive �50% increase in per capita food waste (12). Globally, the
increase in per capita food energy availability is positively corre-
lated with increased weight gain across nations, and the magnitude
of the increase is more than sufficient to account for the observed
weight gain in 80% of nations (13). Thus, increased energy avail-
ability in the food supply is likely an important driver of the obesity
epidemic.
Is it the Food Quality?
Focusing solely on the increased calories in the food supply masks
the complexity of the simultaneous changes that occurred in the
food system during the rise in population obesity prevalence (14).
The increased food energy availability was driven by economic and
policy influences to maximize the agricultural production of cheap
inputs (e.g., corn, soy) to an increasingly industrialized food system
that produced and intensively marketed inexpensive, convenient,
highly processed, “added value” foods. Such foods contain relatively
high amounts of salt, sugar, fat, and flavor additives and are engi-
neered to have supernormal appetitive properties, thereby driving
increased consumption (15). Ubiquitous and continuous access to
food also influenced normative eating behaviors such that more peo-
ple snack between meals, eat in restaurants, and spend less time pre-
paring meals at home (15). These factors likely increased calorie
intake and thereby caused obesity.
Conclusion
It is difficult to imagine a definitive scientific demonstration of the
cause of the obesity epidemic because population environmental
changes are difficult to isolate and experimentally manipulate. It is
easier to rule out simple explanations of obesity, such as those based
on individual dietary macronutrients. More plausible explanations
invoke complex changes in the overall food environment and the
associated alterations in normative eating behaviors. Furthermore, a
confluence of multiple interrelated environmental changes apart
