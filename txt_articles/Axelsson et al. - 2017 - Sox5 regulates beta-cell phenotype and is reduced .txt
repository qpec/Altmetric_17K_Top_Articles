Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion,
but the mechanisms underlying insulin secretion failure are not completely understood. Here,
we show that a set of co-expressed genes, which is enriched for genes with islet-selective
open chromatin, is associated with T2D. These genes are perturbed in T2D and have a similar
expression pattern to that of dedifferentiated islets. We identify Sox5 as a regulator of the
module. Sox5 knockdown induces gene expression changes similar to those observed in T2D
and diabetic animals and has profound effects on insulin secretion, including reduced
depolarization-evoked Ca2 þ-influx and b-cell exocytosis. SOX5 overexpression reverses
the expression perturbations observed in a mouse model of T2D, increases the expression of
key b-cell genes and improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets from
donors with T2D. We suggest that human islets in T2D display changes reminiscent of
dedifferentiation and highlight SOX5 as a regulator of b-cell phenotype and function.

 T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) results from a combination
of insufficient insulin secretion from the pancreatic islets
and insulin resistance of target cells1.
Pancreatic b-cell mass is reduced by B50% in individuals
with T2D compared with non-diabetic subjects2,3. However,
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is decreased in isolated
islets from human donors with T2D, even after correction for
insulin content, suggesting an important role also of functional
defects4–6.
In the b-cell, glucose metabolism leads to increased cytosolic
ATP, closure of ATP-sensitive K þ channels (KATP-channels),
initiation of electrical activity and Ca2 þ-dependent exocytosis of
insulin-containing granules7. Despite the extensive characteri-
zation of the secretory process in normal b-cells, the mechanisms
that lead to b-cell failure in T2D remain largely unknown.
Recent
genome-wide
association
studies
have
identified
more than 80 loci associated with T2D risk6. Furthermore,
global gene expression studies have identified a plethora of genes
that are differentially expressed in islets from T2D donors
compared with control subjects7,8. However, these large-scale
data have not yet been maximally utilized to identify pathophy-
siological mechanisms.
Network models have been proposed as a useful framework
for studying complex data9. To take full advantage of such
models to provide pathophysiological insights and identify new
disease genes for T2D, it is important to combine bioinformatics
with detailed cellular investigations, as has recently been
demonstrated10,11.
To investigate the defects that lead to b-cell failure in T2D, we
analysed the co-expression networks of human pancreatic islets.
We identified a set of co-expressed genes (‘module’) that is
associated with T2D and reduced insulin secretion and show that
human islets display expression perturbations reminiscent of
b-cell dedifferentiation. The data also highlight Sox5 as a
previously unrecognized regulator of b-cell gene expression and
secretory function.
Results
A gene co-expression module associated with T2D. We
first obtained global microarray expression data from islets
from 64 human donors, of which 19 had T2D (Supplementary
Table 1), and explored gene co-expression using the weighted
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) framework12
(see
Experimental
Procedures).
First,
we
calculated
the
connectivity, reflecting the extent of co-expression for all pairs
of gene expression traits (Supplementary Table 2). We then used
the topological overlap, which for each gene pair measures the
number of similar connections of the two genes with all other
genes in the array, to identify 56 gene co-expression modules
(Fig. 1a).
Rather than analysing each gene individually, we used the first
principal component of the gene expression traits of each module
(the ‘module eigengene’, which reflects a summary expression
of all module genes). One eigengene, representing a module
with 3,032 genes (module 2 in Supplementary Table 3, nominal
P values), stood out as being correlated with both T2D status
(P ¼ 0.01; logistic regression; n ¼ 64) and HbA1c (P ¼ 0.003;
linear regression; n ¼ 52), as well as insulin secretion in response
to 16.7 mM glucose (P ¼ 0.006; linear regression; n ¼ 48) and
70 mM K þ (P ¼ 0.048; linear regression; n ¼ 26). Henceforth, we
refer to this as the T2D-associated module.
The T2D-associated module was enriched for genes known
to be highly expressed in the pancreas (1.8-fold enrichment;
Po1E-20 using Fisher’s exact test) and genes involved in vesicle
release (1.6-fold; P ¼ 3E-9; Fisher test) and secretory function
(2.1-fold; P ¼ 4E-6; Fisher test). On the basis of these data,
we hypothesized that the gene module contributes to the
maintenance of b-cell function and tested the hypothesis by
interrogating data on regulatory DNA in human islets13,14.
Gaulton and colleagues recently identified 340 genes located to
regions with islet-selective open chromatin13. The T2D-associated
module that we identified contained 168 of those genes
(Supplementary Table 4), corresponding to 49% of all genes
with islet-selective open chromatin (only 14% expected by
chance; Po1E-6; Fisher test).
The eigengene representing the 168 genes had an even stronger
association with T2D-related traits than that of the entire module
and was correlated with diabetes status, HbA1c, and glucose-
stimulated and K þ-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 1b–e).
When analysing only non-diabetic donors (n ¼ 45), there was no
association between the eigengene and insulin secretion among
those with BMI below median (27 kg m � 2). By contrast, among
non-diabetic donors with BMI above median, which may be at
higher risk of developing T2D, the eigengene was associated
with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (P ¼ 0.04;
b ¼ 1.36; linear regression).
Co-expression networks typically have a few highly linked hubs
that connect a large number of peripheral nodes9. We computed
the total connectivity of each gene (the degree kin, which reflects
the number of genes to which it is linked in the module) and
observed a significant correlation between kin and the gene
expression association with T2D (Po1E-6, Pearson correlation
r ¼ 0.35). The kin of the 168 open chromatin genes was on
average 50% higher than the overall connectivity of the module
genes (Po1E-6; Fisher test; Fig. 1f). These data suggest that the
168 open chromatin genes are at the core of the T2D-associated
module and may play an important role in maintaining normal
secretory function.
We replicated the analyses in an additional 59 human donors
(22 with T2D; Supplementary Tables 5 and 6), and identified
24 co-expression modules. The eigengene displaying the strongest
association with T2D and HbA1c in the replication set (nominal
P ¼ 0.06 for T2D and P ¼ 0.06 for HbA1c, one-sided regression)
represented a module of 2,439 genes. This module had a large
overlap with the T2D-associated module identified in the
initial analysis (1,198 overlapping genes; Po1E-20; Fisher test).
Of the 168 genes with islet-selective open chromatin in the initial
module, 90% (152 genes) were also present in the replication
module
(Po1E-20;
Fisher
test;
Supplementary
Table
7).
The eigengene of these genes had lower values in T2D islets
(P ¼ 0.04, one-sided logistic regression), was negatively correlated
with HbA1c (P ¼ 0.04, one-sided linear regression), and exhibited
a twofold higher connectivity (kin) compared with the other
module genes (Po1E-20; Fisher test), which further corroborates
the initial analyses.
The T2D gene signature is reminiscent of immature b-cells. We
next explored the possibility of using the expression profile
of the 168 open chromatin genes in diabetic versus non-diabetic
donors as a ‘T2D signature’ of human islets to learn more about
the associated pathophysiology. The signature was compared
with gene expression profiles from 48,100 publically available
microarray data sets. The expression profile exhibiting the
highest overlap with the T2D signature was from artificially
dedifferentiated human islets (GSE15543) (ref. 15) (130 genes in
common; P ¼ 3E-68; Fisher test; Fig. 1g). The data sets exhibiting

 respectively. Isolated human islet cultures may contain a
large number of non-endocrine cells, and the nature of the
expanded islet cells in GSE15543 is not fully characterized.
Therefore, we compared the T2D signature with expression data
on purified human b-cell fractions with low insulin expression
(Pdx1 þ/Inslow), suggestive of immature b-cells, and high insulin
expression (mature b-cells; Pdx1high/Inshigh), respectively14,16.
The T2D signature genes had higher expression in the purified
mature b-cell fraction versus unpurified intact islets (1.7-fold
enrichment; Po1E-6; Fisher test) and was perturbed in immature
versus mature human b-cells in a similar manner to that observed
in T2D versus non-diabetic islets (1.3-fold enrichment; Po1E-6;
Fig. 1h). Taken together, these findings suggest that perturbation
of the T2D module is associated with an immature b-cell state
and loss of secretory function. In support of this notion, b-cell
dedifferentiation has been shown to account for diabetes in
animals that are under physiological stress such as ageing and
multiparity17.
Putative key regulators of the T2D-associated module. We
next aimed to identify key regulators of the T2D module that
could have a pathogenetic role in b-cell failure. First, we analysed
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for the 168 genes
and found a high enrichment of putative binding sites for
SOX5 (P ¼ 1E-10; Fisher test) and TCF3 (P ¼ 4E-10). Second,
we found a significant overlap between the T2D signature
and the expression changes induced by knockdown of RORB
(GSE16585; P ¼ 0.0018; Fisher test), GRN (GSE13162; P ¼ 1E-16)
and PTCH1 (GSE24628; P ¼ 2E-19), respectively, and over-
expression of LPAR1 (GSE15263; P ¼ 2E-11). Third, we found
that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near SMARCA1

(Po1E-6;

correlation

and
TMEM63C
(Po1E-6; r ¼ 0.82) as being the most highly correlated genes with
the module eigengene of the 168 open chromatin genes.
We next analysed the expression of these putative regulators
after stressing rat islets with 20 mM glucose or 1 mM palmitate
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). We observed a protracted reduction
of Sox5, Lpar1, Ptch1, Smarca1, Tcf3, Tmem196 and Tmem63C
mRNA.
We
also
observed
a

decrease
of

levels of Pdx1 and Mafa and a B10-fold elevation of Ldha,
which is normally low in b-cells. These expression changes
are reminiscent of what has previously been observed in
immature b-cells18,19, although it should be stressed that the
48 h incubation is far different from the prolonged dysmetabolic
state characterizing T2D.
To directly assess the function of these genes, each of
the putative regulators was silenced using siRNA in clonal rat
INS-1 832/13 cells (Fig. 2a). Sox5 silencing (72±2%) reduced
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 50% (P ¼ 0.003), whereas
silencing of the other genes had no significant effect on insulin
secretion (using two different siRNAs for each gene). Sox5
silencing was repeated using a total of five different siRNAs in
separate experiments, with two of them causing a significant
reduction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, one causing a
20% increase and two being without a significant effect
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). The siRNAs that decreased insulin
secretion target different parts of the Sox5 mRNA sequence
corresponding to the conserved and functionally important first
coil region of the protein, while the siRNAs with no or
stimulatory effect on insulin secretion target sequences outside
of the coil region.
Sox5 knockdown impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
SOX5 encodes sex determining region Y-box 5, a transcription
factor involved in chondrogenesis and neurogenesis20. SOX5
lacks a transactivation domain but binds close to other trans-
cription factors, suggesting that it orchestrates the chromatin
structure20. SOX5 mRNA is expressed both in purified human
a- and b-cell fractions and to a smaller extent in the exocrine
pancreas7. To date SOX5 has not been implicated in b-cell
function or T2D.
We first analysed SOX5 mRNA levels in human islets and
observed reduced SOX5 expression in islets from T2D donors
compared to non-diabetic controls (P ¼ 0.04; Supplementary
Fig. 1c). Immunohistochemistry of pancreatic sections showed
that SOX5 protein was expressed both in a- and b-cells, and, to a
lower degree, in exocrine tissue. SOX5 was present both in the
nucleus and in the cytosol, and cytosolic expression was especially
evident in a-cells. Nuclear SOX5 was reduced by 67% in T2D
b-cells compared with non-diabetic b-cells (Po0.001; Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 2).
We next knocked down Sox5 (Sox5-kd) in INS-1 832/13 cells
(76±4% knockdown; P ¼ 1E-6; Student’s t-test was used in all
cellular experiments unless otherwise specified), which caused
decreased mRNA expression of Pdx1 (14%; P ¼ 0.0005) and Mafa
(52%; P ¼ 0.0004) relative to cells treated with a negative control
siRNA (Fig. 2b). Immunostainings showed a reduction of MAFA
expression in Sox5-kd cells, while MAFB, NKX6.1 and PAX6
were unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 3a). MAFA (P ¼ 0.01;
Supplementary Fig. 3b) but not PDX1 protein levels were
reduced in Sox5-kd cells as assessed by Western blot.
At low glucose levels, insulin secretion in Sox5-kd cells was
similar to control cells (Fig. 2c). By contrast, at 5 mM glucose and
above we observed a significant B50% reduction of insulin
secretion after Sox5-kd. Notably, the ratio between secreted
proinsulin versus insulin was 73% higher in Sox5-kd cells at
2.8 mM glucose (P ¼ 0.005) and 96% higher at 16.7 mM glucose
(P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 2d). The processing of proinsulin to insulin has
been shown to be impaired in T2D (ref. 21). The overall viability
was similar between Sox5-kd and control cells (Supplementary
Fig. 3c). There was no difference in insulin content between Sox5-
kd and control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Accordingly,
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was significantly reduced in
Sox5-kd cells also after normalization for insulin content
(Supplementary Fig. 3e).
To further define the mechanistic defects caused by Sox5
downregulation we treated cells with each of the mitochondrial
substrates leucine and a-ketoisocaproic acid (a-KIC), the KATP
channel
inhibitor
tolbutamide,
and
high
K þ
to
directly
depolarize the b-cells. The fold-stimulation of insulin secretion
was reduced in response to all these secretagogues in Sox5-kd cells
(Fig. 2e,f). Glucose-mediated amplification of insulin secretion
distal to KATP channel closure (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and the
responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 and the a2-adrenergic
receptor agonist clonidine were unaffected (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). Intracellular concentrations of cAMP were similar in
Sox5-kd and control cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c).
We also observed that SOX5 expression in human islets was
associated with both HbA1c (b ¼ –0.33; P ¼ 0.04; linear regres-
sion; n ¼ 123) and insulin secretion in response to high glucose
(b ¼ 0.22; P ¼ 0.02; n ¼ 48) and high K þ (b ¼ 0.93; P ¼ 0.02;
linear regression; n ¼ 26). There was no effect of sex on any of
these associations. When analysing human b-cells from six
diabetic donors by electron microscopy, we found an association
between decreased islet expression of SOX5 and reduced numbers
of insulin granules docked at the plasma membrane (P ¼ 0.01;
linear regression; Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 4d). There was
no association between SOX5 expression and docked granules in
non-diabetic donors (P ¼ 0.5; n ¼ 11 donors). By contrast, in
human a-cells decreased islet expression of SOX5 was rather
associated
with
increased
number
of
docked
granules
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). It should be noted that the changes in
the number of docked granules in T2D donors with low or high
SOX5 expression in islet is correlative, as these cells may have
reduced levels of several islet-enriched transcription factors.
Sox5 knockdown impairs glucose metabolism. There was a
50% decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
in response to glucose (P ¼ 0.02) or pyruvate (P ¼ 0.001) in
Sox5-kd cells (Fig. 3a), paralleled by an accumulation of early
glycolytic intermediates and a reduction of the Krebs cycle
intermediate fumarate (P ¼ 0.046; Fig. 3b). Alanine (P ¼ 0.04)
and lactate (P ¼ 0.009), which are both generated from pyruvate,
were elevated in Sox5-kd cells relative to control cells at
high glucose (Fig. 3c). These findings point to a clear metabolic
defect in Sox5-kd cells. This defect is unlikely to involve the
glycolytic machinery because OCR in response to pyruvate
(that bypasses glycolysis) was reduced to a similar extent as in
response to glucose. Rather, the data suggest a perturbation
in mitochondrial shuttles and a shift in the balance between
aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.
Sox5 knockdown reduces expression of L-type Ca2 þ channels.
We further explored the secretion defect in Sox5-kd cells
by measurements of cell capacitance to monitor the exocytotic
capacity. Total exocytosis in response to a train of ten depolar-
izations tended to be reduced (by 28%) in Sox5-kd cells, but the
decrease was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.07; Fig. 4a).
However, analysis of rapid exocytosis (estimated as the response

 to the first two depolarizations) and slow exocytosis (the response
to pulses 3–10), proposed to correlate with 1st- and 2nd-phase
insulin secretion22, revealed a distinct (44%) reduction of rapid
exocytosis in Sox5-kd cells (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 4b). Interestingly, the
first phase of insulin secretion has been suggested to be perturbed
in T2D patients23. There was a parallel reduction of the integrated
Ca2 þ current in Sox5-kd cells (P ¼ 0.002) (Fig. 4c). By contrast,
the Ca2 þ sensitivity (Fig. 4d) and the exocytotic rate (Fig. 4e)
were similar between Sox5-kd and control cells, indicating that
the exocytotic machinery was intact. There was no difference in
KATP-channel conductance between Sox5-kd and control cells,
suggesting
that
KATP-channel
activity
was
not
perturbed
(Supplementary Fig. 4f).
To specifically study the effect of Sox5 knockdown on glucose-
induced changes in intracellular Ca2 þ ([Ca2 þ]i), we conducted
measurements with the Ca2 þ sensor Fluo-5F (Fig. 4f). The
increase in [Ca2 þ]i elicited by an elevation of glucose from 2.8 to
20 mM was reduced in Sox5-kd cells (P ¼ 0.04 for area under the
curve). Moreover, analysis of the current–voltage relationship
revealed a pronounced reduction of the peak Ca2 þ current in
Sox5-kd (Fig. 4g). Blocking of L-type Ca2 þ
channels by
isradipine evoked a significant reduction of the peak Ca2 þ
current in control cells. By contrast, in Sox5-kd cells isradipine
had no further inhibitory effect on the peak Ca2 þ current,
showing that the L-type component of the Ca2 þ current was
affected by Sox5-kd (Fig. 4g). This was corroborated by
immunostaining, which demonstrated a B20% reduction of the
expression of L-type Ca2 þ channels (P ¼ 0.04 for CaV1.2 and
P ¼ 0.06 for CaV1.3) in Sox5-kd cells relative to control cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5a), and by Western blot, which showed that

 CaV1.2 was reduced by 20% (P ¼ 0.03) and CaV1.3 by 15%
(P ¼ 0.02; Supplementary Fig. 5b). The L-type Ca2 þ channels
CaV1.2 (CACNA1C) and CaV1.3 (CACNA1D) are contained in
the T2D-associated module and the expression of these genes was
strongly
correlated
with
SOX5
in
human
islets
(Pearson
correlation r ¼ 0.85; Po1E-6 for CACNA1C and r ¼ 0.82,
Po1E-6, for CACNA1D; n ¼ 123). These findings demonstrate
that Sox5-kd cells, in addition to pronounced metabolic defects,
have reduced L-type Ca2 þ channels, decreased depolarization-
evoked Ca2 þ influx and consequently reduced insulin exocytosis.
These observations were paralleled by patch clamp recordings
of human b-cells from 18 non-diabetic donors, which demon-
strated an association between SOX5 islet expression and b-cell
exocytosis (P ¼ 0.03 using one-sided linear regression). There was
also an association between SOX5 expression and the integrated
Ca2 þ current in response to the first depolarization in human
b-cells (P ¼ 0.04 using one-sided linear regression). Next, we
transfected dispersed human b-cells with siRNA targeting SOX5.
The cells were co-transfected with Alexa555-coupled oligonucleo-
tides to enable recordings of cells that were fluorescent, indicating
effective transfection. There was a 49% reduction of total
exocytosis following this treatment (P ¼ 0.04, one-sided t-test;
Fig. 4h). Moreover, early exocytosis was reduced by 54%
compared with control cells (P ¼ 0.04), which corroborates the
findings in INS-1 832/13 cells.
Overexpression
of
Sox5
improves
insulin
secretion.
We
transiently overexpressed Sox5 by co-transfecting INS-1 832/13
cells with Sox5- and GFP-expressing plasmids. Capacitance
measurements of GFP-fluorescent cells showed a 72% increase in
exocytosis relative to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Rapid
exocytosis was particularly pronounced (Supplementary Fig. 5d)
and the integrated Ca2 þ current was increased (Supplementary
Fig. 5e), which mirror the results observed in Sox5-kd cells.
Protein levels of CaV1.2 were increased by 30% (P ¼ 0.0076;
Supplementary Fig. 5f) as assessed by Western blot. We next
overexpressed Sox5 in intact rat islets using lentivirus infection.
Dispersion of transduced islets to single cells and separation of
the b-cell fraction using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
followed by PCR showed higher absolute values of MafA mRNA
in cells with Sox5 overexpression (100- to 600-fold Sox5 increase)
compared
with
control
cells,
without
reaching
statistical
significance (Supplementary Fig. 5g). We also analysed the
pure b-cell fraction compared with the b-cell-depleted fraction
(Ins1 expression in the latter fraction was B30% of that in the
pure fraction). We observed an increase in Pdx1 expression in the
pure b-cell fraction compared to the b-cell-depleted fraction after
Sox5 overexpression (P ¼ 0.02). Sox5 overexpression (70- and 7.5-
fold in two experiments) increased insulin secretion both in
response to 16.7 mM glucose (40%, P ¼ 0.01) and 70 mM K þ
(21%, P ¼ 0.03; Supplementary Fig. 5h).
Effects of Sox5 knockdown and overexpression on T2D module.
SOX5 has putative binding sites to 123 of the 168 open chromatin
genes (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Sox5-kd induced pronounced

 832/13 cells, as analysed by microarray. A total of 869 of the 2,889
module genes that were annotated on the array were differentially
expressed in Sox5-kd cells relative to control cells (at nominal
Po0.05), which represents a 1.5-fold enrichment over what
would be expected by chance (Po1E-6 using Fisher’s Exact test;
n ¼ 3 microarrays from each condition). We confirmed this
analysis in an independent experiment (1.5-fold enrichment;
Po1E-6; n ¼ 3). Overexpression of Sox5 (12-fold increase)
affected 421 of the module genes (at nominal Po0.05), which
also represents a significant enrichment (1.4-fold; Po1E-6;
n ¼ 3). Notably, the gene expression changes in response to
Sox5-kd were highly similar to those observed in islets from
T2D donors relative to non-diabetic donors (same direction
of change; Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 9), whereas the
opposite response was observed following Sox5 overexpression
(P ¼ 0.003; 1.9-fold enrichment of genes having a similar
expression change to that in T2D following Sox5-kd and
the opposite change after Sox5 overexpression at Po0.05 for
both Sox5-kd and Sox5 overexpression). Genes exhibiting such
consistent expression changes in response to Sox5 perturbation
had on average higher connectivity (P ¼ 0.047 using independent
t-test) and were more strongly correlated with T2D status
(P ¼ 1E-6 using independent t-test) compared with module genes
that were unaffected by Sox5-kd and overexpression. They were
also enriched for genes involved in membrane function (P ¼ 0.04)
and ion channel activity (P ¼ 0.03). Several genes of importance
to
the
Krebs
cycle
and
the
respiratory
chain
complex
were downregulated by Sox5-kd (Supplementary Table 10),
corroborating
the
metabolic
data
demonstrating

 Sox5 and gene signature perturbation in animal models of T2D.
To further investigate the relevance of the T2D-associated module
in b-cell failure, we analysed global gene expression in islets from
animal models characterized by increased b-cell stress. In
islets from db/db mice at 4 weeks of age (when they are still
normoglycemic; non-fasting blood glucose 8.0±0.3 mM), Sox5
expression was reduced by 20% and a large fraction of the module
genes were changed in a similar direction to that observed in T2D
islets (Po1E-6 using Fisher test; 1.4-fold enrichment; Fig. 5b).
The expression perturbations were even more pronounced in
islets from db/db mice at 10 weeks of age. These mice had a 49%
reduction of Sox5 expression, and compared with the pattern at 4
weeks there was a 47±19% higher differential expression of the
signature genes relative to age-matched control islets (Po1E-6;
Fisher test; Fig. 5c). At this age db/db mice have severely blunted
insulin secretion24 and overt hyperglycaemia (non-fasting blood
glucose 19.0±3 mM). The gene expression changes could be
reversed (Fig. 5b,c) by treating the mice with phlorizin, which
increases renal glucose excretion25.
In islets from 14-month-old mice, Sox5 expression was reduced
by 80% and a significant fraction of the module genes were
perturbed relative to young (8 weeks) mice (1.5-fold enrichment;
Po1E-6; Fisher test; Fig. 5d). Old mice have been shown to
have increased b-cell stress17 despite being normoglycemic
(non-fasting blood glucose 7.0±0.4 mM).
Islets from 6-week-old ob/ob mice displayed no significant
perturbation of the module (Fig. 5e). By contrast, in 13-week-old
ob/ob islets, Sox5 expression was reduced by 52% and a large
fraction of the module genes were changed (1.3-fold enrichment;
Po1E-6;
Fisher
test).
At
this
age
the
ob/ob
mice
are
normoglycemic but highly insulin-resistant with increased b-cell
demands24. We want to stress that the comparison of mouse
models to T2D in humans can only be correlated with changes in
Sox5 expression as many other genes and pathways are also
affected in these animal models.
Culturing human islets at 20 mM glucose for 3 days did not
significantly affect the module genes (Fig. 5f). It is, however, not
surprising that culturing human islets in high glucose for such a
short time period does not correlate with the T2D module, since
T2D occurs over decades and involves multiple organ systems.
Accordingly, we observed no consistent expression changes of the
signature genes when interrogating a data set of human islets
exposed to 48 h palmitate treatment26.
Pancreatic b-cells from both db/db mice and old mice have
been shown to exhibit dedifferentiation, as the expression of key
transcription factors is reduced and genes associated with
immature
cell
states
are
being
expressed17,25.
Our
data,
therefore, suggest that the gene expression signature in human
islets from T2D donors is reminiscent of a dedifferentiation
profile. The signature is not merely secondary to hyperglycemia,
since it was perturbed in several models characterized by
normoglycemia but increased b-cells stress and was unaffected
by culturing islets at high glucose. We want to emphasize that all
comparisons between T2D islets and animal models and short-
term culture should be interpreted with caution as T2D occurs
over decades and involves multiple organ systems.
Regulation of Sox5 expression. The upstream regulation of Sox5
expression remains unclear. Sox5 expression in INS-1 832/13 cells
was reduced both in response to 20 mM glucose and 0.5 or 1 mM
palmitate (Supplementary Fig. 6b).
As Foxo1 has recently been suggested to be involved in b-cell
dedifferentiation in animal models17 we analysed the effects of

 Foxo1 silencing on Sox5 expression. However, Foxo1 silencing
(by 74±7%) did not affect Sox5 expression or glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion (Supplementary Fig. 6c).
We next analysed transcriptional binding sites in the vicinity of
Sox5 and identified 39 putative regulators. We conducted a
siRNA screening to silence each of the 39 genes in INS-1 832/13
cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d) and observed significant changes in
Sox5 expression after knockdown of five of them (Fig. 6a). Sox5
expression was increased in response to silencing of both Nkx2.2
and Sox17, which are important for pancreatic development. It is
tempting to speculate that these transcription factors might
regulate Sox5 expression during islet development, although
the role of Sox5 in islet development remains to be studied.
In contrast, Sox5 expression was reduced after silencing the
transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (Yy1), which was in turn
significantly affected by palmitate treatment (Fig. 6b). Yy1
regulates genes involved in cellular differentiation, mitochondrial
function and stress response and has been suggested to protect
against
oxidative
stress
in
b-cells27.
There
was
a
strong
association between Yy1 and Sox5 expression (P ¼ 5E-7; linear
regression; Supplementary Fig. 6e). Moreover, the inhibitory
effect of palmitate on Sox5 expression was abolished after
Yy1 knockdown (Fig. 6c). Yy1 expression was also associated
with
glucose-stimulated
insulin
secretion
(P ¼ 0.004;
linear
regression;
Supplementary
Fig.
6f).
This
association
was
however non-significant when correcting for Sox5 expression
(P ¼ 0.93), while the association between Sox5 expression and
insulin secretion was significant (P ¼ 0.035; linear regression;

 Supplementary Fig. 6g) even after correcting for Yy1 expression.
Taken together the findings point to a vicious cycle in which
elevated nutrients, partly via Yy1, decrease Sox5 expression and
lead to impaired insulin secretion, which in turn may aggravate
the hyperglycemia.
Valproic acid elevates Sox5 expression and insulin secretion.
On the basis of the present findings, we postulate that the 168
open chromatin genes represent a core set of highly connected
genes in the T2D-associated module that are suppressed in T2D,
resulting in loss of secretory function. We therefore wanted to
investigate the effect on gene expression and b-cell function of the
HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) that remodels chromatin
structure.
Incubation of INS-1 832/13 cells with VPA at 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mM
for 48 h significantly increased Sox5 expression (Fig. 6d).
Moreover, VPA dose-dependently increased insulin secretion
(Fig. 6e). Silencing Sox5 attenuated but did not fully abolish the
stimulatory effect of VPA on insulin secretion, which might be a
result of incomplete knockdown of Sox5 and the involvement of
additional genes to the effect of VPA (Supplementary Fig. 7a).
In islets from
C57BL/6 mice,
1 mM
VPA elevated Sox5
mRNA fourfold and increased insulin secretion in response to
16.7 mM glucose (7.5-fold; P ¼ 0.02) and 70 mM K þ (6.4-fold;
P ¼ 0.01). The response to VPA was further potentiated by 72 h
co-incubation with palmitate (Supplementary Fig. 7b).
We observed a clear association between Sox5 expression and
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at all VPA doses (Fig. 6e). To
formally assess whether the increased Sox5 expression in response
to VPA is causally associated with improved insulin secretion or
rather represents a reactive or independent change, we applied a
causal inference test (CIT)28 based on four prerequisites. First,
VPA dose and Sox5 expression were associated (Po1E-6 by
linear regression; b ¼ 10.5). Second, VPA dose and insulin
secretion were associated (P ¼ 0.0001; b ¼ 0.73). Third, VPA
dose and Sox5 expression were associated conditional on insulin
secretion capacity (Po1E-6; b ¼ 9.7). Fourth, there was no
association between the VPA dose and insulin secretion when
data were adjusted for Sox5 expression (P ¼ 0.3). The omnibus
P value of the test suggests a causal relationship between VPA
dose, Sox5 expression and insulin secretion (P ¼ 0.03 for causal
relationship, P ¼ 0.75 for reactive) implying that the stimulatory
effect of VPA on insulin secretion is mediated by enhanced Sox5
expression.
Intriguingly, the majority (61%) of the genes in the T2D
module
that
were
differentially
expressed
following
Sox5
overexpression (at nominal Po0.05) were also significantly
affected by VPA (Po1E-6 for the enrichment; Fisher test).
Of the 168 open chromatin genes, 58 were differentially expressed
between cells exposed to Sox5-kd and Sox5 overexpression
(at Po0.05), while VPA changed 81 of the 168 genes (41 in
common,
1.6-fold
enrichment;
Po1E-6;
Fisher
test;
Supplementary Table 11). Taken together, the present data show
that VPA, similar to Sox5 overexpression, affects a significant
fraction of the genes in the T2D signature in human islets (Fig. 6f)
and demonstrate that VPA enhances insulin secretion via
increased Sox5 expression. It is important to emphasize that
VPA has global effects on gene expression (1,348 other module
genes were significantly affected) and is therefore not specific
to Sox5 despite the association between Sox5 expression and
VPA dose.
We also observed that VPA increased exocytosis by 86% in
INS-1 832/13 cells (Fig. 6g). Moreover, we treated NMRI mice
with VPA for 7 days and observed increased insulin secretion
in vivo by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose tolerance test (Fig. 6h).
SOX5 overexpression increases human islet insulin secretion.
Finally, we investigated the effects of SOX5 knockdown or
overexpression in human cells. In the human b-cell line
EndoC-BH1 (ref. 29), SOX5 knockdown (74±1% silencing)
reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 29% (P ¼ 0.004;
Fig.
7a).
We
next
overexpressed
SOX5
(2.8±0.4-fold;
Supplementary Fig. 8a) in human islets, which increased insulin
secretion both in response to 16.7 mM glucose (P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 7b)
and
70 mM
K þ
(P ¼ 0.01).
There
was
no
difference
in
insulin content between control islets and islets with SOX5
overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We hypothesized that
the effect of SOX5 overexpression would be greater in T2D islets
and therefore analysed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
separately in non-diabetic versus T2D islets (Fig. 7c). In
non-diabetic islets insulin secretion in response to 16.7 mM
glucose was 4.3% (of total insulin content) compared with 3.3% in
T2D islets (P ¼ 0.04). Overexpression of SOX5 in non-diabetic
islets increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 0.23
percentage points (of insulin content), while secretion was
improved by 0.68 percentage points in T2D islets (P ¼ 0.04),
partly restoring the impaired insulin release.
We also analysed 35 common genetic risk variants for T2D but
found no association with SOX5 expression or the eigengene
representing the 168 open chromatin genes in human islets
(Supplementary Table 12).
We have previously identified a genetic risk score (0–8 risk
alleles) that is associated with reduced insulin secretion in human
islets5. There was no correlation between the risk score and SOX5
expression. However, at four or more risk alleles, the effect of
SOX5 expression on insulin secretion was significantly more
pronounced (b ¼ 1.26; P ¼ 0.02; linear regression) compared with
islets from donors with three or fewer risk alleles (b ¼ 0.17;
P ¼ 0.08; P ¼ 0.001 for comparison of the beta values using t-test).
The findings suggest that the perturbations of SOX5 and the
T2D-associated module are not directly caused by common
genetic risk variants (but rather by b-cell stress). However,
the manifestation of these changes appears to be influenced by
DNA variants, such that genetically susceptible individuals
develop a more severe secretory failure in response to b-cell
stress. This model would be in agreement with the small
effect size of each of the individual genetic risk variants
identified for T2D.
We finally analysed eight key genes that are well-known
markers of differentiated human b-cells. These genes were all
downregulated in human islets from T2D donors compared with
non-diabetic donors (Supplementary Table 13), in agreement
with a dedifferentiation pattern. We also observed that six of
these eight genes were significantly upregulated after SOX5
overexpression in human T2D islets (Fig. 7d). Moreover, SOX5
overexpression increased the expression of CACNA1D mRNA
(P ¼ 0.007; Fig. 7d).
Taken together, the human data corroborate the observations
in INS-832/13 cells and rodent islets, showing that SOX5
overexpression induces expression changes opposite to that of
T2D islets, increases CACNA1D expression and improves b-cell
function in T2D islets.
Discussion
The present data identify a T2D-associated co-expression module
that is enriched for genes with islet-selective open chromatin. The
expression pattern of these genes in human islets from T2D
donors is highly reminiscent to that of dedifferentiated b-cells.
We also identify SOX5 as a regulator of the module. In addition to
SOX5, we also observed a consistent downregulation of LPAR1,
PTCH1, SMARCA1, TCF3, TMEM196 and TMEM63C both in

 response to high palmitate and glucose. We cannot exclude that
these other genes may also affect islet function and the gene
co-expression module as there are often many different regulators
that act in concert.
Insulin secretion following Sox5-kd was compromised by
impaired mitochondrial activity, reduction of L-type Ca2 þ
channel expression and decreased depolarization-evoked Ca2 þ
influx. Intracellular Ca2 þ
regulates the activity of several
enzymes, including ATP synthase30. The mitochondrial defect
and the impaired Ca2 þ influx could therefore act in concert to
aggravate the secretory defect.
Human T2D develops through a vicious cycle, characterized by
progressive changes in a plethora of genes leading to metabolic
perturbations,
including
b-cell
dysfunction18,22.
Chronically
elevated nutrient intake increases the secretory demands of the
b-cell, which produces a compensatory response that initially
maintains euglycemia but also evokes b-cell stress18. In this
context it is pertinent that db/db islets from 4-week-old mice,
which are normoglycemic but have increased insulin secretory
demands24, display expression perturbations similar to those of
T2D human islets. These gene expression changes were reversed
by treatment with phlorizin, which could be assumed to alleviate
the b-cell demands25.
In contrast to db/db mice, ob/ob mice compensate for the
increased insulin requirements over long time. However, ob/ob
islets display declining secretory response with time, likely due to
protracted b-cell stress24. Accordingly, we found that the gene
signature was unaffected in islets from 6-week-old ob/ob mice but
was perturbed at 13 weeks. It is also of interest that both SOX5
(P ¼ 0.02) and the T2D-associated gene signature (P ¼ 0.05) had
reduced expression in human islets from non-diabetic donors
(n ¼ 45) with BMI above median (27 kg m � 2), which may be
at higher risk of developing T2D, compared with islets from
non-diabetic donors with BMI below the median.
On the basis of the present data we propose a model for T2D
in which decreased Sox5 expression contributes to reduced
expression of genes with islet-selective open chromatin and loss
of b-cell secretory function, due to both metabolic and distal
secretory defects involving reduced Ca2 þ influx. The expression
perturbations are similar to those observed in models exhibiting
b-cell dedifferentiation, although the altered b-cell state in the
pathophysiology of human T2D may not be as severe as in some
genetic models17,31. There was no induction of NGN3, NANOG
or other developmental progenitor markers in the T2D islets, and
the T2D signature may therefore also be described as ‘immaturity’
or ‘loss of b-cell identity’. Our data suggest that changes of
SOX5 and the gene module represent early events in the vicious
cycle that leads to b-cell failure which is precipitated by
chronically elevated nutrient intake (for example, glucotoxicity).
Our data also show that impaired glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in T2D islets can be restored by SOX5 overexpression.
SOX5 overexpression improved insulin secretion by 18% in
T2D islets (secretion increased from 3.4 to 4.0% of total
insulin content) but had a mere 6% effect in non-diabetic islets
(secretion increased from 4.3 to 4.5% of insulin content).
Secretory function was not completely restored by SOX5
overexpression, which is not surprising considering that a
plethora of genes are perturbed in T2D and islet dysfunction
may be partly irreversible after long-standing disease.
The central role of the islet-selective open chromatin genes is
shown by the striking effects of VPA on b-cell gene expression
and function. VPA has not been clinically investigated for
T2D but has been associated with hyperinsulinemia in patients
with epilepsy who receive the drug32 and has been shown
to stimulate insulin secretion in vitro33. Our new findings that
VPA improves insulin secretion via elevated Sox5 expression,
restores the T2D-associated module and increases glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion in vivo raise the exciting possibility
that VPA and other HDAC inhibitors could be a potential means
to treat defective insulin secretion in T2D by counteracting an
immature b-cell state.
Methods
Human islets. Experimental procedures were approved for Lund University by
the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund. Donated human islets were obtained
(with research consent) from the Nordic Network for Clinical Islet Transplanta-
tions (Professor O. Korsgren). Some of these islets, but not the full cohort used
here, have been utilized in other studies from Lund University Diabetes
Centre5,11,34. Islets were extracted from multi-organ donors35,36. The pancreas was
perfused with ice-cold collagenase, cut into pieces and placed in a digestion
chamber at 37 �C. Separation of endocrine and exocrine tissues was achieved by a
continuous density gradient. Selected fractions were then centrifuged to enrich for
islets. Purity of islets was measured by dithizone staining35. From this suspension,
islets to be used for experiments were hand-picked under a microscope. The islets
were cultured at 5.6 mM glucose in CMRL-1066 (INC Biomedicals) supplemented
with 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 mg ml � 1 gentamicin, 0.25 mg ml � 1
Fungizone (GIBCO), 20 mg ml � 1 ciprofloxacin (Bayer Healthcare), 10 mM
nicotinamide and 10% human serum at 37 �C (95% O2 and 5% CO2) for 1–9 days
before experiments. Donors with known T2D or HbA1c46.0% and no GAD
antibodies were defined as having T2D. There was no difference in islet purity

 between non-diabetic and T2D donors. See Supplementary Tables 1 and 5 for data
on donors.
Animals. Male db/db and db/ þ mice (4 and 10 weeks of age) were from Charles
River, and male ob/ob and ob/ þ mice (6 and 13 weeks of age) were from Janvier
labs. A 14-months-old male C57BL/6J mice (kept at the local animal facility for
12 months) and 12-week-old female NMRI mice were from Taconic. All animal
experiments were approved for Lund University by the ethical committee for
animal research in Malmo
¨/Lund.
Rat and mouse islets. Pancreatic islets from rats or mice were prepared by
collagenase digestion of the exocrine pancreas. The islets were hand-picked in
Hank’s buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with 1 mg ml � 1 BSA and either used directly for
mRNA extraction or incubated in a humidified atmosphere in RPMI 1,640 tissue
culture medium containing 5 mM glucose (SVA, Sweden) supplemented with
10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, 100 IU ml � 1 penicillin and 100 mg ml � 1
streptomycin. RNA from mouse islets used for microarray analysis was prepared
with the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).
VPA treatment. NMRI mice were injected i.p. with VPA (250 mg kg � 1 daily) or
vehicle (PBS) for 7 days before performing an i.p. glucose tolerance test.
Phlorizin treatment of db/db mice. Phlorizin (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as a
20% stock (0.2 g ml � 1) in 1,2-propanediol (Sigma-Aldrich) and kept at 4 �C. Mice
were injected subcutaneous with 0.4 g kg � 1 phlorizin or vehicle once daily
for 7 days (10-week-old db/db; 3 phlorozin-treated and 7 vehicle-treated mice) or
10 days (4-week-old db/db; 3 phlorozin-treated and 7 vehicle-treated mice).
Non-fasted blood glucose was measured before killing. For the phlorizin-treated
4-week-old db/db mice it was 4.7±0.4 mM and for the control-treated 4-week-old
db/db mice it was 4.8±0.6 mM. For the phlorizin-treated 10-week-old db/db mice
it was 8.4±1.5 mM and for the control-treated 10-week-old db/db mice it was
20.0±3.2 mM. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation and pancreatic islets and
RNA was prepared as described above.
INS-1 832/13 cells. Rat insulinoma INS-1 832/13 cells developed by
Hohmeier et al.37 and kindly provided by Dr. Hindrik Mulder were used for
experiments involving siRNA and Sox5 overexpression. INS-1 832/13 cells
(passages 55–70) were cultured at 10 mM glucose in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) and supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum,
100 IU ml � 1 penicillin, 100 mg ml � 1 streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM
glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol.
EndoC BH1 cells. Human EndoC-BH1 cells, kindly provided by Dr Raphael
Scharfmann, were used for lentiviral RNA interference experiments. EndoC-BH1
cells were cultured in DMEM low glucose (1 g l–1, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2%
albumin from bovine serum fraction V, 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM
nicotinamide, 5.5 mg ml � 1 transferrin, 6.7 ng ml � 1 sodium selenite, 100 IU ml � 1
penicillin and 100 mg ml � 1 streptomycin. The culture vials were pre-coated with
DMEM (4.5 g l–1 glucose) containing 100 IU ml � 1 penicillin, 100 mg ml � 1
streptomycin, 2 mg ml � 1 fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% ECM
(Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 4 h. For glucose starvation before secretion
experiments, glucose-free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as
a base and glucose added to 2.8 mM.
Microarray analysis of islets and INS-1 832/13 cells. Total RNA was extracted
from human islets with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality
and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Bio-Rad)
and a Nanodrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies). The Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray chip (Affymetrix) was used for gene expression
analysis in accordance with the standard protocol. Briefly, total RNA was converted
into biotin-targeted cDNA following the manufacturer’s specifications, and the
biotin-labelled cDNA was fragmented into strands with 35–200 nucleotides. This
was hybridized onto the chip overnight in a GeneChip Hybridization 6400 oven
using standard procedures. The arrays were washed and stained in a GeneChip
Fluidics Station 450. Scanning was carried out with the GeneChip Scanner 3000
and image analysis was done with the GeneChip Operating Software. Data
normalization was performed using Robust Multi-array Average.
Microarray analysis of INS-1 832/13 cells treated with siRNA, Sox5 plasmid or
VPA, was performed using SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K V2 Microarray Kit.
Microarray analysis of islets from db/db,db/ þ , ob/ob, ob/ þ , C57BL/6J and NMRI
mice was done using SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8 � 60K V2 Microarray Kit.
Microarray analysis of human islets cultured at low or high glucose was done using
SurePrint G3 Human GE 8 � 60K V2 Microarray Kit. Data were pre-processed
using quantile normalization in Partek Genomic Suite.
Co-expression network analysis. The co-expression network analysis was
performed in R (version 2.15.1) using log2-transformed microarray expression
data from human islets. Using the WGCNA framework12 and the corresponding
Bioconductor package38, we first calculated the pair-wise co-expression for
all genes and formed a similarity matrix based on the Pearson correlation
coefficients si,j ¼ |cor(xi,xj)|, where xi denotes the expression vector for gene
i across the samples.
Next, the similarity matrix was transformed into an adjacency matrix
ai,j ¼ |cor(xi,xj)|b. The connectivity of a gene in a network (the degree k) equals the
sum of all connections for that gene.
Biological networks have been suggested to exhibit a scale-free property9, which
means that the probability that a node is connected with k other nodes (the degree
distribution p(k)) decays as a power function p(k)Bk � g. Linear regression analysis
of log-transformed k and p(k) was used to estimate how well the co-expression
network satisfied the scale-free topology for different values of b. We found that for
bZ5 (bZ8 in the replication set) R2 for the fit was 40.8. On the basis of the
adjacency matrix, the topological overlap, which reflects the relative gene
interconnectedness, was calculated for all gene pairs9. The non-negative and
symmetric topological overlap matrix O ¼ [oi,j] was converted to dissimilarity
(distance) measures di,j ¼ 1 � oi,j, which were used for module identification. The
eigengene, defined as the 1st principal component of the gene expression matrix,
was determined for each module and was correlated with the phenotype traits. The
human islet insulin secretion data showed non-Gaussian distributions. Gaussian
distribution was obtained using logarithm transformation, and analyses of human
islet insulin secretion data were therefore performed using log-transformed data.
For each gene in the T2D-associated module the connectivity within the module
(kin) was determined. In addition, the correlation between the gene expression trait
and T2D status was calculated. Next, the correlation between gene connectivity and
the trait associations was analysed across the genes by Spearman’s rank correlation.
Comparisons with public microarray data. Gene expression profiles from
48,100 publically available microarray data sets (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) analysed by Affymetrix, Agilent or Illumina
chips were downloaded and processed (all Affymetrix, Agilent or Illumina chips
from which raw data were available, including all tissue and conditions). Only data
sets for which the full raw data were available were included. The processed data
are freely available at www.trialomics.com. The probe-level data were processed
using the Supervised Normalization of Microarrays (SNM) framework to
normalize for array effects, detect and remove outlier arrays, and facilitate
cross-data set analysis. Our specific implementation of this framework were as
follows: (1) for each array, we calculated the average value of all probes aligning to
gene g; (2) we defined an overall average for gene g across all microarrays from that
platform; (3) for every sample, we used a b-spline basis function to remove any
intensity-dependent variation between the gene-level mean values calculated in
step 1 with the average values calculated in step 2 as the reference.
Next, summary statistics were calculated for each gene in each study. These
statistics were then aggregated into matrices where each row corresponds to a gene,
each column a study, and each element a summary statistic (mean or variance).
The corresponding matrix of gene variances across samples used to identify studies
in which the 168-gene signature was, as a group, more variable than expected by
chance. When comparing differential expression we used a chi-squared test to
assess relationships between differentially expressed genes between studies.
In silico analysis of TFBS. TFBS were detected using the Regulatory Genomics
Toolbox (regen.googlecode.com). A region 1 kilobases (kb) upstream of the gene
promoter (Ensembl built GRCh37.p13) was used to find binding sites. Next, a
motif match analysis was performed using the motif matching tool available in
Biopython39 with a false positive rate of 0.0001 in these regions40. Motifs were
obtained in Jaspar, Transfact (public) and the Uniprobe databases41,42. The same
procedure was repeated 100 times on random genomic regions with the same
length as the original regions. We employed a one-tailed Fisher’s Exact test to
measure if the proportion of binding sites of a motif inside the gene promoters was
higher than the proportion of binding sites in random regions. P values were
corrected by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. For detection of candidate
regulators of SOX5, we performed motif matches in open chromatin regions close
to SOX5 (that is, overlapped with the gene or promoter region or 1 kb upstream).
Genotype analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from human islets from
all donors. The SNPs shown in Table S10 were genotyped using an allelic
discrimination assay-by-design method on an ABI 7900 analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). For global analysis of SNPs affecting the module eigengene, we used
the Affymetrix Human SNP array 6.0. The association between the SNPs and SOX5
expression or the module eigengene was analysed by linear models and in-house R
and Perl code (at Sage Bionetworks)43. For the analyses of expression SNPs
(eSNPs), we made ten permutations of the expression file. The permutation was
done by swapping columns preserving the co-expression structure of the data.
The analysis of SNP enrichment among the 168 open chromatin genes used the
following procedure. (1) SNPs within 50 kb of each of the 168 genes were identified.
(2) Published genome-wide association data were interrogated to identify SNPs

168 genes was assessed by SNP set enrichment analysis44.
Causal inference test. The CIT28 was used to assess whether there was a causal
relationship between VPA dose, Sox5 expression and glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion such that VPA-Sox5-insulin secretion, or whether there was rather
a reactive or independent relationship. The CIT takes into account all four
prerequisites that have been suggested for inferring a causal relationship. VPA dose
was treated as a categorical variable with no VPA, low dose (0.1 mM) or high dose
VPA (1 mM). Sox5 expression and insulin secretion were treated as continuous
variables. The CIT determines an omnibus P value for the causal relationship.
Other bioinformatics analyses. Gene enrichment analysis was performed using
DAVID version 6.7 (ref. 45). Islet-selective open chromatin genes were identified as
having open chromatin in the transcription starting site or gene body
(Supplementary Table 2 in ref. 13).
Transmission electron microscopy. Human islets were fixated in 2.5%
Glutaraldehyde in freshly prepared Millionig’s buffer (1.88% NaH2PO4 � H2O
(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.43% NaOH, pH 7.2) and refrigerated for 2 h. After a wash in
Millionig’s buffer, the islets were post-fixated in osmium tetroxide (1%) for 1 h, and
then carefully washed in Millionig’s buffer. Finally, the islets were dehydrated and
embedded in AGAR 100 (Oxford Instruments Nordiska AB, Sweden). Samples
were cut into 70–90 nm ultrathin sections. The sections were placed on Cu-grids
and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before examination in a JEM
1,230 electron microscope (JEOL-USA. Inc., USA). Granules (large dense core
vesicles) were defined as docked when the centre of the granule was located
within 150 nm from the plasma membrane. The number of granule profiles within
150 nm from the plasma membrane was calculated using an in-house software
programmed in MatLab 7 (MathWorks, Natick, USA)46. Electron micrographs
were analysed from at least three different cells per donor (median seven cells).
Insulin secretion and insulin content measurements in INS-1 832/13 cells.
Approximately 350,000–400,000 INS-1 832/13 cells were seeded per well in
a 24-well plate 72 h before secretion experiments. Cells were washed twice with a
secretion assay buffer (SAB) containing 114 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM
KH2PO4, 1.16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 25.5 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM
CaCl2, 0.2% BSA with 2.8 mM glucose. This was followed by 2 h preincubation at
37 �C with 5% CO2 in 2 ml SAB. Next, the buffer was removed and cells were
incubated for 1 h in SAB supplemented with glucose, tolbutamide (Sigma-Aldrich),
clonidine (Sigma-Aldrich), diazoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), KCl (Sigma-Aldrich),
carbachol (Sigma-Aldrich), L-Leucine (Sigma-Aldrich), a-ketosicaproic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich) or Glp-1 (Bachem, Switzerland) as indicated. Immediately after
incubation, an aliquot of the medium was removed and insulin was analysed
directly or after storage at � 20 �C for later analysis with the Coat-a-Count kit
(Siemens) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For protein and total insulin
analysis the remaining cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8,
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40/Triton X, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM
EDTA and 50 mM NaF). Cells were shaken on ice for 30 min followed by collection
of the lysate and centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min (4 �C). The supernatant was
collected and analysed for total protein and insulin content directly or stored at
� 20 �C for later analysis. Total protein was measured with the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Total insulin was assessed at a 1:100 dilution in PBS
with the Coat-a-Count kit.
Average values based on technical replicates (2–8 wells) from three or more
experiments were compared using Student’s t-test. For the correlation analysis of
insulin secretion versus mRNA expression (Fig. 6e), all secretion data were first
normalized to values for non-treated cells.
Insulin secretion and insulin content measurements in EndoC-BH1 cells.
EndoC-BH1 cells were seeded in 48-well plates at 100,000 cells per well 144 h
before secretion experiments. The cells were cultured in medium containing
5.6 mM glucose, but 18–22 h before the experiments the medium was changed to
medium containing 2.8 mM glucose. Cells were washed twice with secretion assay
buffer (SAB; see above) containing 1 mM glucose and then preincubated in this
buffer for 2 h at 37 �C with 5% CO2. The buffer was removed and cells were
incubated for 1 h in SAB supplemented with 1 or 20 mM glucose. Immediately after
incubation, an aliquot of the medium was removed for measurement of secreted
insulin, and the cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (see above) for analysis of total
insulin content. Insulin levels were analysed using Mercodia Insulin ELISA.
Insulin secretion and content measurements in human and mouse islets. For
static insulin secretion measurements, 10 or 12 islets were distributed into separate
tubes and preincubated in 1 ml KREBS buffer (120 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM
CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 10 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaHCO3) with
2.8 mM glucose at 37 �C in a water bath for 30 min. The buffer was then exchanged
to KREBS buffer with 2.8 mM (with or without 70 mM K þ) or 16.7 mM glucose,
and after 1 h incubation samples (800 ml) were collected and insulin content was
analysed with the Millipore rat or human specific RIA kit. Some experimental
series on human islets were analysed using Mercodia Insulin ELISA. The islets
from each tube were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer for determination of total
insulin and protein content.
Incubation of rat islets and INS-1 832/13 cells with palmitate and glucose.
INS-1 832/13 cells were incubated for 48 h at 20 mM glucose or with 0.25, 0.5 and
1 mM palmitate. Palmitate-BSA stock solution (5 mM palmitate and 10% BSA)47
was prepared by heating 10.5% fatty-acid free BSA in a water in a 55 �C water bath
for 30 min, heating 100 mM palmitate in 100 mM NaOH in a 70 �C water bath
until dissolved, and then adding 100 mM palmitate to 10.5% BSA at a 1:19 ratio.
The solution was stirred at 37 �C for 30 min and allowed to cool down before being
filter sterilized and aliquoted. Aliquotes were kept at � 20 �C and warmed to 37 �C
before use. Control cells were cultured at 10 mM glucose. Mannitol (at 10 mM) was
used as an osmotic control for the incubations at 20 mM glucose. After 48 h, RNA
was isolated and used for quantification of mRNA levels.
For experiments using freshly isolated rat islets, these were incubated in RPMI
medium containing 20 mM glucose or 1 mM palmitate. The medium was replaced
by fresh medium after 24 h. RNA was extracted 48 h after incubation start and used
for mRNA expression analysis.
Incubation of INS-1 832/13 cells with valproic acid. A 250 mM stock of VPA
(Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared fresh at the time of use in distilled water and filter
sterilized. VPA at 0.1, 0.3 or 1 mM was added to cells at the time of transfection
with Sox5 or control siRNA. Medium was changed to fresh VPA-containing
medium the day after transfection, and insulin secretion or RNA isolation was
performed 48 h post-transfection as described in the corresponding sections. For
electrophysiological measurements fresh medium with or without 0.3 mM VPA
was added to cells the day after seeding. The cells were split 24 h later and new
medium with or without VPA was added. The cells were used for experiments after
a total incubation time of 48 h with or without 0.3 mM VPA.
RNA interference in INS-1 832/13 cells. The day before transfection
350,000–400,000 INS-1 832/13 cells were seeded in each well in a 24-well plate.
Cells were transfected with RNA interference oligonucleotides using DharmaFECT
1 (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s description. Silencer Select
siRNAs from Life Technologies were used for all genes. For Sox5, two additional
siRNAs from Sigma-Aldrich and two siRNAs from Thermo Scientific were used.
Final oligonucleotide concentration was 30 nM. We used negative control siRNA
from the same manufacturer as the active siRNA: Silencer Select Negative
Control no. 2 (Life Technologies), Mission siRNA universal negative control # 1
(Sigma-Aldrich) and On-Target plus non-targeting siRNA # 1 (Thermo Scientific),
respectively. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. For immunohis-
tochemistry cells were re-seeded after 24 h onto a 0.175 mm thick glass and
incubated for another 24 h. Transfection efficiency was assessed by qPCR as
described below. For capacitance measurements, cells were re-seeded in new dishes
after 48 h and used for experiments at 48–72 h post-transfection.
RNA interference in EndoC-BH1 cells. Sox5 was knocked down in EndoC-BH1
cells using BLOCK-iT HiPerform Lentiviral Pol II miR RNAi Expression System
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). A pre-miRNA sequence targeting base 128–148 of
human Sox5 transcript variant 1 was designed using BLOCK-It RNAi Designer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). This sequence was used to create a pre-miRNA
expression cassette, which was cloned into the pLenti6.4/R4R2/V5-DEST MultiSite
Gateway vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) together with a 409 bp sequence
of the RIPII promotor (bp � 696 to þ 12). The pre-miRNA was expressed
co-cistronically with EmGFP in the expression cassette to allow detection of RNAi
by fluorescence. For the control plasmid, instead of the Sox5 128–148 pre-miRNA
sequence, a pre-miRNA hairpin sequence predicted not to target any known
vertebrate gene was used (provided with the kit). Lentiviruses were produced at the
Vector Unit at Lund University, and viral titres were determined by transducing
INS-1 832/13 cells and measuring GFP-positive cells by FACS 72 h post
transduction. EndoC-BH1 cells were transduced with Sox5 RNAi lentivirus
at 5 MOI at the time of seeding. Medium was changed after 24 h and secretion was
performed after 144 h (at this time full knockdown effect was observed).
Preparation of dispersed human islets for electrophysiological measurements.
Human islets were hand-picked, dispersed into single cells and seeded on
plates pre-coated with poly-L-lysine. Cells were transfected with SOX5 siRNA
(targeting bp 1,428–1,448 of human SOX5 transcript variant 1) or negative control
siRNA (Lifetech) using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific).
The BLOCK-It Alexa Fluor Red Fluorescent Oligo was added to allow for
visualization of transfected cells. As the Alexa Fluor Red-coupled oligonuclotides
are more bulky than the SOX5 siRNA oligonucleotides, this approach is unlikely to
overestimate the transfection rate. Cells were used for experiments 36 h after
transfection.

 Electrophysiological measurements. The electrophysiological measurements
were conducted using an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier with the PULSE software
(HEKA, Germany). The plastic Petri dishes were used as the experimental chamber
with a plastic insert to reduce the volume to B0.5 ml. The dish was continuously
perfused at a rate of B2 ml min � 1 at 31–33 �C. Patch pipettes were pulled from
borosilicate glass, coated with Sylgard and fire-polished to an average resistance of
4–6 MO when filled with pipette solution. The zero-current potential of the pipette
was adjusted with the pipette in the bath. Exocytosis was elicited by a train of ten
depolarizations from � 70 to 0 mV, which was applied to simulate glucose-induced
electrical activity. Exocytosis was monitored as increases in cell capacitance using
the sine þ DC mode of the lock-in amplifier included in the PULSE software and
the standard whole-cell configuration. Human b-cells were identified based on
their size (B10 pF) and/or immunostaining48. The extracellular solution consisted
of (mM) 118 NaCl, 20 TEACl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES and 5.0
glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution in Fig. 4e contained (mM)
125 K-glutamate, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 3 ATP, 0.1 cAMP, 10 EGTA
and 9 CaCl2 (pH 7.2 with KOH). The pipette solution used in the remaining
experiments was composed of (mM) 125 Cs-glutamate, 10 CsCl, 10 NaCl,
1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 3 ATP, and 0.1 cAMP and 0.05 EGTA, (pH 7.2 with CsOH).
All reagents were of analytical grade. Isradipine was added to the extracellular
solution at 2 mM. Tetrodotoxin (0.1 mg ml � 1) was present to block the Na þ
currents. The current–voltage relationship was measured by 100 ms depolarizations
from the holding potential at � 70 mV. The depolarization potential was increased
stepwise from � 40 to þ 40 mV.
Ca2 þ imaging in INS-1 832/13. A low-affinity Ca2 þ indicator, Fluo-5F
(Kd ¼ 2.3 mM) (Invitrogen), was used for measuring intracellular Ca2 þ. Cells were
loaded with 1 mM Fluo-5 F for 30 min at 37 �C. Cells were first perfused in a
Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing 116 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl,
2.6 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 20 mM NaHCO3, 16 mM HEPES
and 2 mg ml � 1 BSA, supplemented with 2.8 mM glucose. The cells were stimulated
with a 20 mM glucose KRB buffer at room temperature.
Images were acquired by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Germany) using a
� 63 oil immersion objective (NA ¼ 1.25). An argon laser (488 nm) was used to
excite the cells and the emitted light was collected using a 500–530 nm bandpass
filter. The ratio of fluorescence intensity at each time point (Fi) versus the average
fluorescence intensity (F0) under pre-stimulatory conditions was determined49.
The integrated fluorescence signal (area under the curve) was calculated using the
function Pi
i¼0 0:5�Dt�ðRi þ Ri þ 1Þ, where Dt denotes the time interval and Ri the
ratio (Fi/F0) at time point i.
Immunostaining INS-1 322/13 cells. INS-1 832/13 cells were washed twice in
PBS and fixed with 3% PFA in PBS for 30 min at 37 �C followed by washing
3 � 10 min with PBS before permeabilization for 30 min with BD Phosphflow
Perm buffer III (BD Biosciences). Samples were blocked using 5% normal donkey
serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight
at 4 �C with antibodies against Cav1.2 (1:200, code C1603, Sigma-Aldrich), Cav1.3
(1:100, code ACC 005, Alomone Labs), MafA (1:100, code ab26405, Abcam), MafB
(1:100, code IHC00351, Bethyl Labs), Pax6 (1:100, code MAB2237, Millipore) or
Nkx6.1 (1:100, code AF5857, R&D Systems) diluted in the blocking solution. All
antibodies were from rabbit except Nkx6.1, which was generated in mouse.
Immunoreactivity against the rabbit antibodies was detected by a Delight
488-conjugated antibody (1:400, code 715-545-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch).
A Cy5-conjugated antibody (1:400, code 715-175-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch)
was used to detect the Nk � 6.1 antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained with
Hoechst 34580 (1:500, Life Technologies). Immunofluorescence images were
acquired by confocal microscopy and Zen software (Carl Zeiss).
Immunostaining human pancreatic sections. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
human T2D and control pancreatic sections were deparaffinized and processed
for heat-induced antigen retrieval using Retrievit 2 buffer (Biogenex). For
immunohistochemistry the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit
anti-Sox5 (1:250, code sc-20091, Santa Cruz), guinea pig anti-insulin
(1:1,000, DAKO), mouse anti-glucagon (1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary
antibodies applied were Cy3-, Cy2- and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-guinea
pig and anti-mouse (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. DAPI
dye was used to perform nuclear counterstaining (1:6,000, Invitrogen).
Immunofluorescence images were acquired at � 40 magnification using confocal
microscopy and Zen software (LSM 780, Carl Zeiss).
Quantitative PCR. Islets were homogenized in Qiazol reagent (Qiagen) followed
by vortexing. RNA was extracted with chloroform precipitation using the mRNeasy
kit (Qiagen). For total RNA extraction from INS-1 832/13 cells, RNeasy Plus Mini
kit (Qiagen) was used.
Reverse transcription was performed using either SuperScript III Reverse
transcriptase (Life Technologies) or SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit
(Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR was performed on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR
System (Life Technologies) using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays and TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Relative gene expression was
measured from triplicate average Cq-values normalized to the geometric mean of
reference genes. For human islets, HPRT1 and B2M were found to be stable and
were used as reference genes. For INS-1 832/13 cells with Sox5 knockdown, B2m
and Polr2a were found to be stable and were used as reference genes.
For experiments with low mRNA abundance, preamplification was performed
for 10 or 14 cycles before quantitative PCR using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix
(Life Technologies) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays at a dilution of 0.05.
In some experiments where data were available from both non-treated and
negative control samples, the relative gene expression in treated samples was
normalized to the relative gene expression in the non-treated sample. Average
value and s.e.m. from all experiments were then normalized to the average of the
negative controls. Statistical comparisons were made using paired Student’s t-test
on log2-transformed relative gene expression values.
Sox5 overexpression. INS-1 832/13 cells were transiently co-transfected with a
custom-made plasmid expressing rat Sox5 under the CMV promoter (BlueHeron)
and a plasmid encoding GFP (BlueHeron) using the Lipofectamine LTX Plus
reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Total plasmid
concentration was 0.625 mg ml � 1 and the concentration of Lipofectamine LTX was
4 ml mg � 1 plasmid.
The ratio of Sox5 plasmid to GFP plasmid was 1:1 in the capacitance
measurements in which GFP was used to identify transfected cells. The capacitance
measurements were performed 48–72 h after transfection. For microarray
analysis the Sox5 plasmid was co-transfected with an empty vector instead of the
GFP plasmid at a ratio of 1:1,000. RNA for microarray analysis was extracted 48 h
post-transfection. For Western blots cells were co-transfected with Sox5 and
GFP plasmid at a ratio of 1:1 or 1:1,000. These samples were lysed 72 h
post-transfection. For these experiments, we used cells transfected with the
equivalent amount of GFP plasmid alone as controls.
Human islets were transduced with SOX5 lentivirus or control virus 72 h before
insulin secretion measurements or RNA isolation. The sequence encoding human
SOX5 transcript variant 1 (Origene, RC224228) was cloned into a bicistronic
lentiviral vector (Sanbio CD630A-1) where the UBC promotor had been replaced
by a RIP promotor. Lentiviruses were produced at the Vector Unit at Lund
University. Viral titre was determined with Lenti-X qRT-PCR Titration Kit
(Clontech). Islets were transduced in a small volume of medium (400–900 ml for
250–600 islets) and after 24 h transferred to new medium. Measurements were
performed 72 h after transduction.
Rat islets were transduced with a LVX-TRE3G-Sox5-mCherry plasmid. This
plasmid was intended to be used as part of the Lenti-X Tet-On 3G Inducible
Expression System (Clontech), but in our case the response plasmid induced
expression of Sox5 without the Tet-On 3G transactivator protein. The experimental
procedure for transduction of rat islets was the same as for human islets.
Western blot. INS-1 832/13 cells were transfected with siRNA or Sox5 expression
plasmid as previously described. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection for
siRNA and 72 h after transfection for Sox5 overexpression. Briefly, cells were
washed once with ice-cold PBS, and then lyzed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCl,
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40/Triton X, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM
EDTA, 50 mM NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche).
Samples were kept on ice and lightly shaken until cells were detached. The lysate
was collected and centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was either
stored at � 80 �C or used directly for analysis. Approximately 20–30 mg of protein
was loaded per well and separated on 10% or 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast
polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane
(GE Healthcare) using regular transfer buffer (58 mM Tris, 186 mM glycine,
0.1% SDS, 20% Ethanol). Blocking of membrane and incubation with antibodies
was performed in TBST with 5% milk. Primary antibodies used were against MafA
(1:200, code ab26405, Abcam), CaV1.2 (1:400, code C1603, Sigma-Aldrich), CaV1.3
(1:400, code #ACC-311, Alomone Labs), Pdx1 (1:1,000, code #5679, Cell Signaling
Technology), b-actin (1:2,000, clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich) and cyclophilin B
(1:2,000, code ab16045, Abcam). Incubation with primary antibodies was per-
formed overnight at 4 �C. Secondary HRP-linked antibodies used were anti-rabbit
(1:4,000, code #7074, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-mouse (1:2,000, code P
0447 Dako). Incubation with secondary antibodies was performed overnight at
4 �C or for 2 h at room temperature. SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity
Substrate (ThermoPierce) was used for visualization of proteins with a CCD
camera (AlphaImager from Alpha Innotech or ChemiDoc XRS þ from Bio-Rad).
The intensity/volume of each protein band was normalized to the intensity/volume
of reference protein (b-actin or cyclophilin B) for each sample. Paired
Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis. The original pictures of
the blots displayed in this paper are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
cAMP measurements. Intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) were measured
with the cAMP Biotrak Enzyme Immunoassay System (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences) using the non-acetylation protocol as described by the manufacturer.
INS-1 832/13 cells (300,000 cells per well) were seeded in a 24-well plate,
transfected with Sox5 siRNA the following day and lysed with 1.5 ml Lysis reagent
1B 48 h post-transfection.

 Proinsulin-insulin ratio. The ratio of human proinsulin to human insulin in the
secretion buffer of INS-1 832/13 cells was determined using Mercodia Proinsulin
ELISA and Mercodia ELISA (Mercodia) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Human insulin and proinsulin were analysed since INS-1 832/13 cells,
in contrast to other INS-1 clones, are stably expressing the human proinsulin gene.
Insulin secretion in Sox5-kd cells was performed 48 h post-transfection, and an
aliquot of the secretion buffer was used for proinsulin analysis.
INS-1 832/13 cell viability. Cell viability was measured using a CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Reagent (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The measurement is based on the
spectrophotometric detection of a coloured formazan product converted from
a (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-
2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) compound by NADPH or NADH in metabolically active
cells. Cells were seeded at 50,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate the day before
transfection. Six hours after transfection, the medium was changed to a medium
containing 0.5 mM palmitate and/or 20 mM glucose. After 48 h incubation, the
cells were incubated for 1 h 30 min with CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent
before measuring the absorbance at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader.
Metabolomics. Metabolite profiling in INS-1 832/13 was performed as previously
described in detail50,51. In brief, cells were treated as described for insulin secretion,
followed by a quick wash in ice-cold PBS and quenching of metabolism by addition
of 70 ml ice-cold double distilled water. Metabolites were extracted using a one
phase extraction protocol, as previously described in detail50. Metabolites were
derivatized and analysed on a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent 6,890 N, Agilent
Technologies) connected to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS; Leco
Pegasus III TOFMS, Leco Corp., USA). Data were acquired using Leco ChromaTof
(Leco Corp.), exported as NetCDF files, and processed using hierarchal
multivariate curve resolution52 in MATLAB 7.0 (Mathworks, Natick, USA).
Metabolites were normalized using the scores from the first component of a
principal component analysis performed in Simca P þ 12.0 (Umetrics, Sweden) on
the uncentreed and unit variance scaled areas of internal standards53.
Mitochondria spare respiratory capacity measurements. OCR were measured
by the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience), as described by
Malmgren et al.54 and Brand et al.55. INS-1 832/13 cells were seeded onto
poly-D-Lysine coated XF24 24-well plates at 70,000 cells per well, transfected with
Sox5 siRNA and incubated for 48 h before the assay. The cells were preincubated in
500 ml assay buffer (114 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.16 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2,
0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2.8 mM glucose, pH 7.2) for 2 h at 37 �C in air after
which basal respiration was measured in the presence of 2.8 mM glucose. After the
assessment of basal respiration, 16.7 mM glucose or 10 mM pyruvate was added
and OCR was analysed during B1 h. Oligomycin (4 mg ml � 1), the ionophore
carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (4 mM) and
rotenone (1 mM) were added in sequence to inhibit ATP synthase, uncouple the
inner mitochondrial membrane proton gradient dissipation from ATP synthesis,
and to block the electron transport chain, respectively. Data were normalized to
basal respiration. Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis.
Isolation of b cell RNA for gene expression analysis. b cells from Wistar rat
islets were isolated, fixed, labelled intracellularly with insulin antibody and sorted
using the method describes by Hrvatin et al.56. Briefly, islets were dispersed by
pipetting up and down after incubation with TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher
Scientific) at 37 �C. The cells were passed through a strainer (50 mm), washed with
PBS, and fixed for 30 min with DEPC-treated PBS containing 4% PFA, 0.1%
saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1:20 RNasin Plus Rnase inhibitor (Promega). This
and remaining steps were performed at 4 �C using RNase-free equipment. The
fixed cells were centrifuged at 3,000g for 3 min, washed with DEPC-treated PBS
containing 0.2% BSA, 0.1% saponin and 1:100 RNasin Plus, strained through a
50 mm filter, and washed again. The cells were then incubated rotating for 30 min
with guinea pig anti-insulin primary antibody (1:1,000, code #2263B65-1,
Europroxima) in DEPC-treated PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% saponin and 1:20
RNasin Plus. After 2 � wash, the cells were incubated rotating for 30 min with
FITC-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibody (1:100, code
706-095-148, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were washed twice and
suspended in DEPC-treated PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 1:20 RNasin Plus for
FACS analysis. The cells were sorted into a b-cell fraction and a b-cell-depleted
fraction on a BD FACS Aria II cell sorter. RNA was purified using the RecoverAll
Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion), and SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis
kit was used for reverse transcription of isolated RNA.
Statistical analyses. Linear regression was used for comparisons between gene
expression in the microarray and continuous phenotypes and logistic regression
was used to analyse the association between gene expression and T2D status. The
regression analyses were corrected for age, sex and BMI. Fisher’s Exact test with
Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used for enrichment analyses.
A linear model was used for the association analyses with the risk score and the
continuous traits.
Student’s t-test was used when comparing two experimental groups unless
otherwise specified. Data from human islets were analysed using linear regression
using average insulin secretion from each individual. The single-cell data, including
electrophysiological recordings and granule distribution analysis, were analysed
using a linear model in which all single-cell recordings were included as discrete
observations but were grouped using donor ID as the subject cluster variable5.
b values for associations were obtained from the linear model.
Complete phenotype data on insulin secretion, electrophysiology and
granule distribution were not available from all human donors included in the
study, which is why the number of donors used for the different trait analyses vary
(see ‘n’ for the different series).
Two-sided tests were used unless otherwise specified. One-sided tests were used
for the replication analyses and analyses of one-sided hypotheses as specified in the
text. All statistical comparisons for animal- and cell experiments were performed
using Student’s t-test.
Details on the statistical procedure used to analyse data from specific methods
are given in the relevant sections. Statistical analyses were performed using R,
python 2.6 (additional packages: scipy 0.7.0, fisher 0.1.0 and statsmodels 0.4.0),
IBM SPSS Statistics (ver 20.0, 21.0 or 22.0) or Excel.
Data availability. All human islet microarray data are MIAME compliant, and the
raw data have been deposited in a MIAME database (GEO, accession number:
GSE38642).
