Ebola survivors (21/27 [77.8%]) suffered more disability than 
their close contacts (6/54 [11.1%]) (adjusted odds ratio, 23.5 
[95% confidence interval, 6.5–85.7]; P < .001) when measured 
by the Washington Group Disability Extended Questionnaire. 
Major limitations in vision, mobility, cognition, and affect were 
observed in survivors 1 year following the 2014–2016 Ebola 
outbreak, highlighting the need for long-term rehabilitation.

The scale of the 2014–2016 West African Ebola outbreak has 
resulted in an unprecedented number of survivors and the 
opportunity to vastly improve the understanding of the health 
challenges they face [1]. In early convalescence from Ebola virus 
disease (EVD), ocular, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric 
sequelae are common [2–5]. Reports from the Bundibuygo and 
Kikwit outbreaks suggest that there are also long-term compli-
cations [6, 7]. Difficulties of survivors in resuming work after 
EVD were reported following the Gulu outbreak in Uganda [8].
We assessed disability among a cohort of EVD survivors 
12 months following their discharge and compared with their 
close contacts in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
METHODS
We recruited study participants in June 2016 by systematic 
sampling from a list of attendees at the Ebola Survivors Clinic, 
34th Military Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Based on 
background disability surveys from Sierra Leone [9] and data 
from EVD cross-sectional studies, 50% of survivors were esti-
mated to have 1 or more forms of disability compared with 17% 
in the general population. A total sample size of 81 (27 EVD 
survivors and 54 contacts) was estimated as being required to 
detect a difference of this magnitude or greater with 80% power 
using a conventional 2-sided significance level of 5% (GPower 
3.1, formula based on Fisher exact test). Inclusion criteria for 
EVD survivors were confirmed EVD by polymerase chain reac-
tion testing, age over 19 years, completion of ≥12 months of 
convalescence at the time of recruitment, and verification of an 
EVD discharge certificate. Each EVD survivor recruited was 
requested to bring 2 close contacts (1:2) from during the time 
of disease, preferably members of their family, who had never 
been admitted to an Ebola treatment unit and were not enrolled 
in an EVD vaccine trial. All close contacts recruited as controls 
were from the same community as cases at time of disease, same 
language group, and similar socioeconomic status as the cases.
Disability was measured using the Washington Group Disability 
Extended Questionnaire for both the EVD survivors and their 
nonaffected contacts. The questionnaire measured self-reported 
physical and mental impairments present at the time of the inter-
view (Supplementary Materials). The questionnaire assesses 6 
domains: vision, hearing, mobility, self-care, communication, and 
cognition. Functionality scores were calculated from the severity 
and frequency of anxiety, depression, pain, and fatigability. We con-
ducted face-to-face interviews in Krio and English and recorded 
the responses in an electronic format of the questionnaire.
Categorical disability measures were summarized using 
frequency counts and percentages; differences between the 
exposed (survivor) and unaffected contacts (control) subjects 
were summarized as odds ratios (ORs) with their exact (bino-
mial) 95% confidence intervals (CIs), after adjustment for age 
and sex using logistic regression (aOR). Continuous disability 
measures were summarized using means and standard devia-
tions; differences between the exposed and unexposed subjects 
were summarized as mean differences with their 95% CIs, after 
adjustment for age, sex, and occupation using linear regression. 
The other demographic factors (including place of residence) 
did not contribute as confounding factors during statistical 
modeling. All statistical tests were 2 tailed, with significance set 
at the conventional 5% level. All analyses were done using Stata 
software version 14.
All participants provided written informed consent. The pro-
tocol was approved by the institutional ethics review board of 
The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom 
(10 May 2016), and the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific 
Review committee (31 May 2016).

 132 • CID 2018:66 (1 January) • BRIEF REPORT
RESULTS
Twenty-seven EVD survivors (cases) and 54 unaffected con-
tacts (controls) were recruited. The EVD survivors were more 
likely to be >25 years of age (n = 21 [77.8%]) than the controls 
(29 [53.7%]) and to be female (n = 21 [77.8%] vs 29 [53.7%]) 
(Fisher exact test P = .05 for both). At the time of the study, EVD 
survivors were less likely to live in the Western Urban area, out-
side Freetown (n = 11 [40.7%] vs 36 [66.7%]: Fisher exact test 
P = .03) and more likely to be unemployed due to health reasons 
(n = 4 [14.8%] vs 0; Fisher exact test P = .01). There was no sig-
nificant difference in preexisting comorbidities between the 2 
groups at a median time of 18 months postdischarge.
Disability in at least 1 of the 6 functional domains was 
reported by significantly more EVD survivors than controls 
(aOR, 23.5 [95% CI, 6.5–85.7]) (Table 1). EVD survivors had 
higher odds of blurred vision (aOR, 7.6 [2.0–27.9]). Subjective 
hearing loss was observed (OR, 12.05 [95% CI, 1.31–110.6]; 
P = .03), but this was not statistically significant when adjusted 
for age (aOR, 11.5 [95% CI, .6 – 214]; P = .1). Differences in 
physical disability were most marked with the survivors’ cohort 
being more likely to experience difficulty in walking 100 m, 500 
m, climbing 12 stairs, and “moderate disability in mobility” than 
controls (aOR for each ranging from 64 to 206; all P < .001).
Self-rated levels of pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression influ-
enced disability in mobility. Relative to controls, the EVD survi-
vors had very significantly increased mean pain scores (adjusted 
mean difference, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.33–3.69]), fatigue scores (2.23 
[95% CI, 1.36–3.09]), anxiety scores (1.89 [95% CI, .52–3.27]), 
and depression scores (3.32 [95% CI, 1.95–2.59]). Mean fatigue 
scores were significantly higher for female than for male EVD 
survivors (adjusted mean difference, 3.12 [95% CI, .88–5.36]; 
P = .008) but were similar for the 2 sexes among the controls 
(0.05 [95% CI, –.37 to .48]; P = .799). No EVD survivors or con-
tacts reported disturbances in self-care and communication.
When compared to their controls, EVD survivors had signifi-
cantly higher subjective difficulties remembering or concentrat-
ing (9/27 [33.3%] vs 0; P < .001).
DISCUSSION
This study provides case-controlled data on disability in EVD 
survivors, showing that they have higher odds of developing 
disability in vision, mobility, and cognition 1 year after recovery 
from acute disease in comparison to their contacts.
We observed that mobility limitation was the most com-
mon post-Ebola disability in EVD. The survivors reported 
significantly higher odds of limitations in walking 500 m and 
climbing stairs. Musculoskeletal pain was the major contribu-
tor to mobility limitations. Our findings reporting long-term 
musculoskeletal pain concur with the studies from Kikwit and 
Bundibuygo [6, 7].
We also observed that survivors of EVD are more likely to 
have blurred vision than their contacts. Ocular sequelae have

 BRIEF REPORT • CID 2018:66 (1 January) • 133
been demonstrated in survivors from West Africa [4, 10] and 
require specialist assessment, and in the long term cataract 
replacement is frequently indicated. We did not observe a sta-
tistically significant difference in self-reported hearing loss 
between the 2 groups. The evidence from the 1995 Ebola virus 
outbreak shows that the post-EVD complaint of hearing loss 
was not significant by audiometry, 21 months following the 
outbreak [7]. Subjective hearing loss described in studies [2, 4] 
during early convalescence may recover within months as it can 
with Lassa fever [11].
The psychological effects of EVD are often neglected in 
the acute setting but would be expected to persist into conva-
lescence and may compound physical disabilities. Our data 
showed that the adjusted mean difference of depression and 
anxiety scores were significantly higher in EVD survivors, com-
pared to controls, and that a third of survivors also had signif-
icant difficulties with concentration. This subjective post-EVD 
cognitive impairment coincides with the short-term memory 
problems that have been reported in earlier studies [5, 12]. This 
may be sequelae of critical illness or suggest direct viral neuro-
logical involvement.
The main limitation of the study is dependence on self-re-
porting of disabilities. We mitigated this by design using a val-
idated questionnaire with objective measurements of disability 
and community controls. The selection of controls (contacts 
not affected by EVD) by the survivors may have introduced 
some bias, although 22% did have evidence of disability, con-
sistent with previous population estimates [9]. We were una-
ble to screen serologically for asymptomatic EVD infection in 
the control group. However, asymptomatic EBOV infection has 
recently been shown to be uncommon in the Western area of 
Sierra Leone, even in close contacts [13]. Although adequately 
powered, the study sample size was small, resulting in wide con-
fidence intervals. This study only focused on the investigation 
of disability in adults, whereas pediatric survivors remain an 
important understudied and vulnerable group. Despite these 
limitations, the study provides statistically significant case-con-
trolled evidence on post-Ebola disability in EVD survivors 
using a standardized disability questionnaire. Displacement 
of survivors from their communities following the outbreak 
remains a concern to be addressed.
Further research in this cohort is required to understand the 
pathogenesis of sequelae and characterize disability further. 
It is clear that EVD survivors require an integrated package 
of care. Long-term treatment and rehabilitation strategies are 
challenging in the context of a constrained health system but 
require advocacy, investment, and a holistic approach. Specific 
interventions such as physiotherapy have been reported to be 
effective after chikungunya disease [14], and might benefit EVD 
survivors. Task shifting of rehabilitation services to communi-
ty-based rehabilitation programs for identifying disability and 
accessing assistive devices may prove an effective strategy.
This study has demonstrated that a year following acute dis-
ease, survivors of the recent EVD outbreak have higher odds of 
persisting disability in mobility, vision, and cognition. Mental 
health issues such as anxiety and depression persist in EVD 
survivors and must not be neglected. Further evaluation of the 
scale of disability in larger survivor cohorts is required, as is 
a new focus on sustainable long-term rehabilitation in EVD 
survivors.
