Vital Signs: Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Among Adults — 
United States 2011–2012
Abstract
Introduction: The 2016 National Academies of Sciences report “Hearing Health Care for Adults: Priorities for Improv-
ing Access and Affordability” included a call to action for government agencies to strengthen efforts to collect, analyze, 
and disseminate population-based data on hearing loss in adults.
Methods: CDC analyzed the most recent available data collected both by questionnaire and audiometric tests of adult 
participants aged 20–69 years in the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to 
determine the presence of audiometric notches indicative of noise-induced hearing loss. Prevalence of both unilateral 
and bilateral audiometric notches and their association with sociodemographics and self-reported exposure to loud noise 
were calculated.
Results: Nearly one in four adults (24%) had audiometric notches, suggesting a high prevalence of noise-induced hear-
ing loss. The prevalence of notches was higher among males. Almost one in four U.S. adults who reported excellent or 
good hearing had audiometric notches (5.5% bilateral and 18.0% unilateral). Among participants who reported expo-
sure to loud noise at work, almost one third had a notch.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant, often unrecog-
nized health problem among U.S. adults. Discussions between patients and personal health care providers about hearing 
loss symptoms, tests, and ways to protect hearing might help with early diagnosis of hearing loss and provide opportuni-
ties to prevent harmful noise exposures. Avoiding prolonged exposure to loud environments and using personal hearing 
protection devices can prevent noise-induced hearing loss.

Introduction
Hearing plays an important role in communication, health, 
function, and quality of life. Hearing loss is the third most 
common chronic physical condition in the United States and 
is twice as prevalent as diabetes or cancer (1). 
Untreated hearing loss is associated with decreased social, 
psychological, and cognitive functioning. Hearing ability is 
inversely associated with distress, somatization, depression, 
and loneliness among all age groups (2,3). The economic cost 
to society of age-related hearing loss has been estimated to be 
$297,000 over the lifetime of every affected person. Hearing 
loss is associated with low employment rates, lower worker 
productivity, and high health care costs. Adults with hearing 
loss are more likely to have low income and be unemployed 
or underemployed than adults with normal hearing (2,3). 
Nationally, the total cost of first-year hearing loss treatment is 
projected to increase fivefold between 2002 and 2030, from 
$8.2 billion to $51.4 billion (4).
Noise is the most common modifiable environmental cause 
of hearing loss among young and middle-aged adults, and the 
most common self-reported cause of hearing loss among men 
(5). In 2014, an estimated 21.0% of adults aged ≥18 years had 
difficulty following a conversation amid background noise, 
11.2% had tinnitus (i.e., the perception of ringing in the ears 
or other sounds such as buzzing, hissing, and clicking), and 
5.9% had sensitivity to everyday sounds (hyperacusis).* In 
addition to hearing loss, chronic exposure to noise has been 
associated with increased stress, anxiety, depression, blood 
pressure, heart disease incidence, distractibility, annoyance, 
tinnitus, hyperacusis, and other health problems (6).
The 2016 National Academies of Sciences report included 
a call to action for government agencies to strengthen efforts 
to collect, analyze, and disseminate population-based data 
on hearing loss in adults (2). CDC analyzed data from the

2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) to estimate the prevalence of audiometric 
notches and exposure to noise among adults aged 20–69 years.
Methods
NHANES† is a continuous, cross-sectional health interview 
and examination survey designed to assess the health and func-
tional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. 
The 2011–2012 NHANES cycle included audiometric testing 
and hearing-related questions for a nationally representative 
sample of adults aged 20–69 years. Using the standard NHANES 
audiometric protocols, audiograms were analyzed using an algo-
rithm (7) to identify high-frequency audiometric notches that 
suggest hearing loss caused by exposure to noise. An audiometric 
notch is a deterioration in the hearing threshold (the softest 
sound a person can hear). This study defined the presence of a 
high-frequency audiometric notch when any threshold at 3, 4, or 
6 kHz exceeded the average threshold at 0.5 and 1 kHz by ≥15 
decibel (dB) hearing level (HL) and the 8 kHz threshold was at 
least 5 dB HL lower (better) than the maximum threshold at 3, 
4, or 6 kHz. Statistical analyses were weighted as recommended 
for NHANES data. Logistic regression was performed to evalu-
ate the notch prevalence among age groups and its association 
with sociodemographic factors (sex, race/ ethnicity, education, 
income) and exposure to noise. NHANES 2011–2012 defined 
“loud” noise as when “you had to speak in a raised voice to be 
heard,” and “very loud” as when “you have to shout in order 
to be understood by someone standing 3 feet away from you.”
Results
During NHANES 2011–2012, a total of 3,583 participants 
aged 20–69 years had complete audiometric data (response rate 
76.6%, among 4,677 participants who completed household 
interviews). The weighted prevalence of an audiometric notch 
among U.S. adults aged 20–69 years was 39.4 million or 24.4% 
(6.2% bilateral notch and 18.2% unilateral notch) (Table 1).
Differences were identified by age, sex, and race/ethnic-
ity, and by whether participants were exposed to loud noise 
at work. The presence of an audiometric notch increased 
with age (p<0.01), ranging from 19.2% among persons aged 
20–29 years to 27.3% among persons aged 50–59 years 
(Table 1). The prevalence of notches was consistently higher 
in males than in females for both reported work exposure to 
noise and for no reported work exposure to noise (Table 2). 
This was true for both unilateral and bilateral notches (Figure). 
Twenty-one million U.S. adults (19.9%) who reported no 
exposure to loud or very loud noise at work had an audiometric 
notch (bilateral or unilateral) (Table 1). Persons exposed to loud 
noise at work were twice as likely to have bilateral or unilateral 
notches (Table 1) than those not exposed. However, 23.5% of 
persons who self-reported excellent or good hearing (irrespective of 
noise exposure reported) had bilateral or unilateral notches (5.5% 
and 18.0%, respectively) (Table 1). These numbers were higher 
(31.0%) among persons reporting exposure to noise at work and 
lower (20.1%) among those who were not exposed to noise at 
work (Table 2). Seventy percent of persons exposed to loud noise 
in the past 12 months never or seldom wore hearing protection.
Conclusions and Comments
Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant health problem 
among U.S. adults, is more prevalent among males, and 
increases with age. Persons with auditory damage caused by 
noise frequently do not recognize it; one in four U.S. adults 
who reported excellent or good hearing had an audiometric 
notch. Among persons who reported work exposure to loud 
noise, one third had a bilateral or unilateral notch.
Noise exposure is the second most common cause of acquired 
hearing loss (after aging) (8). An estimated 24% of hearing loss in 
the United States has been attributed to workplace exposures (9). 
Noise exposure is associated with numerous adverse health effects, 
and reducing noise exposure is likely to improve health. A recent 
study suggested that reducing environmental noise exposure might 
save lives by decreasing the prevalence of cardiovascular heart disease 
(10). Avoiding exposure to loud environments and effective use of 
personal hearing protection devices (earplugs or earmuffs) have been 
shown to prevent hearing loss (3). Evidence also exists that stronger 
occupational regulation leads to decreased noise levels (11). Persons 
who already have impaired hearing from noise exposure can benefit 
from clinical rehabilitation, such as amplification through hearing 
aids, learning to read lips, and other compensation strategies (2). 
Use of technology, such as smart phone apps to measure sound level, 
provides new ways of informing decisions and actions.§
Key Points
• Noise exposure at home and in the community can 
permanently damage hearing.
• Almost one in four adults who reported excellent to 
good hearing already have measurable hearing loss.
• The presence of noise-induced hearing loss increased 
from one in five among young adults aged 20–29 years 
to one in four among adults aged 50–59 years.

Noise reduction and avoidance can prevent hearing loss or 
slow its progression. This can be accomplished by avoiding 
high volumes on personal listening devices; reducing listening 
time to high volumes of music; taking breaks from exposure; 
requesting lower volumes in public settings (restaurants, movie 
theaters); using quieter products (e.g., household appliances, 
power tools, recreational vehicles); reducing equipment noise 
by replacing worn or unbalanced machine parts; moving as far 
as possible from the loudest sound-producing source, such as 
loudspeakers or cannons at college stadiums; and using hearing 
protection devices (2,3). Hearing protectors need to fit well to 
reduce noise exposure effectively.
Noise exposure at younger ages needs particular attention. 
Damage to hearing accumulates over time so that hazardous 
exposure that begins earlier in life has the potential to be more 
damaging as persons age. The high prevalence of audiometric 
notches (one in five) among persons aged 20–29 years suggests 
that early life interventions need to be developed.
Hearing screenings can help reduce delays in diagnosis and 
improve access to hearing aids for those with hearing loss, thus 
improving health-related quality of life (12), yet a 2014 report 
found that only 46.0% of adults who had any trouble hearing 
had seen a health care professional about their hearing in the 
past 5 years (5). Hearing loss often progresses for years before 
being self-perceived or diagnosed (13,14). Talking to one’s per-
sonal health care provider about hearing loss symptoms, tests, 
and ways to protect hearing, might support early diagnosis and 
access to hearing rehabilitation if needed.

* An audiometric notch is a deterioration in the hearing threshold (the softest sound a person can hear). An audiometric notch is present when one or more of the 
thresholds at 3–4, or 6 kHz exceeds the pure-tone average of the 0.5 and1 kHz thresholds by 15 dB hearing level (HL) or more, and the 8 kHz threshold is at least 5 dB HL 
lower (better) than the highest threshold in the 3–6 kHz range. Audiograms were not accepted if the test and retest results were greater of 10 dB. The average 1-kHz 
frequency was the value used in this study. Participants were excluded if they had partial audio exam, ear compliance ≤0.2mL or pressure more negative than 
-150 dekapascals (daPa) (normal air pressure is approximately equal on both sides of the tympanic membrane [zero daPa]).
† Persons with no work exposure to noise included both those who reported off-work exposure to noise (e.g. noise from power tools, lawn mowers, farm machinery, 
cars, trucks, motorcycles, motor boats or music for 10 or more hours a week) and those who did not report exposure to off-work noise. Persons with work exposure 
to noise reported exposure to loud or very loud noise at work.
§ Participants were asked: “Which statement best describes your hearing (without a hearing aid)? Would you say your hearing is excellent, good, that you have a little 
trouble, moderate trouble, a lot of trouble, or are you deaf?”

During routine exams, primary care providers can examine 
patients’ hearing; ask about patients’ hearing and noise expo-
sures and inform them about the benefits of hearing protection; 
monitor patients with hearing loss symptoms, recommend or 
provide hearing tests when indicated; and counsel patients 
with hearing loss (2,8,15). Studies indicate, however, that 
40%–77% of primary care providers have not asked about or 
screened for hearing loss (16,17). Patients reporting hearing-
related symptoms (15) or risk factors such as noise exposure 
need to be referred for objective hearing assessment.¶,** 
Although there is currently a lack of data to support the 
benefits of regular hearing screening in adults aged >50 years, 
the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association†† recom-
mends that adults be screened at least every decade through 
age 50 years and every 3 years thereafter. Healthy People 2020§§

* An audiometric notch is a deterioration in the hearing threshold (the softest sound a person can hear). An audiometric notch is present when one or more of the 
thresholds at 3, 4, or 6 kHz exceeds the pure-tone average of the 0.5 and1 kHz thresholds by ≥15 dB hearing level (HL), and the 8 kHz threshold is at least 5 dB HL 
lower (better) than the highest threshold in the 3–6 kHz range. Audiograms were not accepted if the test and retest results were greater of 10 dB. The average 1-kHz 
frequency was the value used in this study. Participants were excluded if they had partial audio exam, ear compliance ≤0.2mL or pressure more negative than 
-150 dekapascals (daPa) (normal air pressure is approximately equal on both sides of the tympanic membrane [zero daPa]).
† Persons with no work exposure to noise included both those who reported off-work exposure to noise (e.g. noise from power tools, lawn mowers, farm machinery, 
cars, trucks, motorcycles, motor boats or music for 10 or more hours a week) and those who did not report exposure to off-work noise. Persons with work exposure 
to noise reported exposure to loud or very loud noise at work.
§ Statistical difference at p<0.5 compared with the referent group.
¶ Participants were asked: “Which statement best describes your hearing (without a hearing aid)? Would you say your hearing is excellent, good, that you have a little 
trouble, moderate trouble, a lot of trouble, or are you deaf?”

increase the number referred by their health care provider for 
hearing evaluation and treatment.
Although there are no federal regulations regarding exposure 
to nonoccupational noise, a 1974 Environmental Protections 
Agency report¶¶ identified 70 dB over 24 hours (75 dB over 
8 hours) as the average exposure limit for intermittent envi-
ronmental noise. World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 
Guidelines for Community Noise*** recommend avoiding 
noise exposure levels that exceed 70 dB(A)††† over a 24-hour 
period or 85 dB(A) over a 1-hour period. CDC’s National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has 
established an 8-hour, time-weighted average 85 dB(A) recom-
mended exposure limit to protect most workers from devel-
oping hearing loss from noise exposure over a 40-year career. 
However, at that sound pressure level [85 dB(A) time-weighted 
average], approximately 8% of workers could still develop hear-
ing loss, and thus NIOSH recommends that hearing protection 
be worn whenever noise levels exceed 85 dB(A), regardless of 
the length of exposure.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) and WHO are raising awareness about noise-induced 
hearing loss. DHHS is collecting data on hearing status and 
risk factors, as well as developing guidelines on hearing aids. 
WHO is developing guidelines on noise exposure. Other 
public entities, such as states and counties, partner with com-
munity groups to reduce noisy environments and use evidence 
to inform policies that decrease noise exposures. Other ways 
to reduce environmental noise exposure include using sound-
absorbent materials in office buildings and public venues, erect-
ing highway barriers, and passing noise ordinances. Managers 
and owners of public venues can decrease the loudest sound 
levels at those locations to help decrease noise exposure.
Study Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, this is a report of audiometric notches as a proxy for 
noise-induced hearing loss, and it is possible that some of the 
hearing loss observed through this method could be caused by 
factors other than noise. Second, establishing prevalence rates 
of hearing damage attributed to risk factors such as noise is 
confounded by multiple data limitations, such as reliance on 
self-reported rather than measured noise exposures, complexity 
of categorizing hearing loss; and co-occurrence of risk factors, 
including genetic predisposition, and aging.
Data Needs
This study examines evidence of hearing loss related to noise 
exposure in a single NHANES 2-year data cycle. It does not 
provide a longitudinal assessment of persons over time, nor 
does it compare the results of hearing examinations across 
different NHANES cycles. A need exists for longitudinal data 
that measure cumulative effects of noise exposure on hearing 
over time. These data also show high prevalence of audiometric 
notches in young adults. Recent studies have shown an increase 
in the number of young persons exposed to loud noise and 
music via personal listening devices and at entertainment 
venues. Future work is needed on early life exposure to noise 
and its relation to hearing later in life.

 ††† dBA indicates A-weighted decibels, an expression of the relative loudness of 
sounds in air as perceived by the human ear. In the A-weighted system, the 
decibel values of sounds at low frequencies are reduced, compared with 
unweighted decibels, in which no correction is made for audio frequency.
