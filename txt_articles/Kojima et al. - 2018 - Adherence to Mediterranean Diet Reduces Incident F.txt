Adherence to Mediterranean Diet Reduces Incident Frailty Risk:
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Gotaro Kojima, MD, Christina Avgerinou, PhD, Steve Iliffe, BSc and Kate Walters, PhD
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the lit-
erature on prospective cohort studies examining associa-
tions between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and
incident frailty and to perform a meta-analysis to synthe-
size the pooled risk estimates.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
SETTING: Embase,
MEDLINE,
CINAHL,
PsycINFO,
and Cochrane Library were systematically searched on
September 14, 2017. We reviewed references of included
studies and relevant review papers and performed forward
citation tracking for additional studies. Corresponding
authors were contacted for additional data necessary for a
meta-analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (mean
age ≥60).
MEASUREMENTS: Incident
frailty
risk
according
to
adherence to a Mediterranean diet.
RESULTS: Two
reviewers
independently
screened
the
title, abstract, and full text to ascertain the eligibility of
125 studies that the systematic search of the literature
identified, and four studies were included (5,789 older peo-
ple with mean follow-up of 3.9 years). Two reviewers
extracted data from the studies independently. All four
studies provided adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of incident
frailty risk according to three Mediterranean diet score
(MDS) groups (0–3, 4–5, and 6–9). Greater adherence to a
Mediterranean diet was associated with significantly lower
incident frailty risk (pooled OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.47–
0.82, P = .001 for MDS 4–5; pooled OR = 0.44, 95%
CI = 0.31–0.64, P < .001 for MDS 6–9) than poorer
adherence (MDS 0–3). Neither significant heterogeneity
(I2 = 0–16%, P = .30) nor evidence of publication bias
was observed.
CONCLUSION: Greater adherence to a Mediterranean
diet is associated with significantly lower risk of incident
frailty in community-dwelling older people. Future studies
should confirm these findings and evaluate whether adher-
ence to a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of frailty,
including in non-Mediterranean populations. J Am Geriatr

F
railty is a geriatric syndrome common in older people,
and its prevalence is considered to increase with popu-
lation aging.1 Although consensus has not been reached on
a criterion standard definition, frailty is generally defined
as a state of greater vulnerability due to age-related accu-
mulation of deficits and low physiological reserves across
multiple
systems.1
Frailty
predicts
numerous
negative
health outcomes in older people, including falls,2 frac-
tures,3 hospitalization,4 nursing home placement,5 disabil-
ity,6 dementia,7 and premature death,8 and is associated
with poorer quality of life.9
Nutrition is considered to play a crucial role in the
complex
pathogenesis
of
frailty.10
Nutrition
provides
energy and essential nutrients and helps the human body
to function properly and maintain homeostasis. The nutri-
ents found in observational and intervention studies to
show promising results in relation to frailty are protein
and some selected micronutrients, such as carotenoids and
vitamins.11,12 Although evidence on individual nutrients or
food items is important, when the food is consumed, vari-
ous micro- and macronutrients interact with each other,
and may cause synergistic effects. Therefore, instead of
focusing on a single dietary component, it may be more
reasonable to describe the overall consumption of a diet as
a dietary pattern.13
The Mediterranean diet is based on food patterns typ-
ical of Greece and southern Italy in the 1960s. This diet-
ary pattern, which is traditionally presented as a food
pyramid,14 consists of abundant plant foods (fruit, veg-
etable, cereals, potatoes, beans, nuts and seeds), olive oil
as the principal source of fat, dairy products, fish and
poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts, 0 to 4

 eggs per week, red meat consumed in low amounts, and
wine consumed in low to moderate amounts, normally
with meals. This diet is low in saturated fat and has been
associated with multiple health benefits, including lower
incidence of cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative dis-
eases, diabetes, and overall cancer, as well as longer sur-
vival.15–17 Only a few studies have examined associations
between the Mediterranean diet and frailty risk, and the
results have been mixed and inconclusive.11,13 Further-
more, to our knowledge, no meta-analysis has been per-
formed. The objectives of the current study were thus to
conduct a systematic review of the literature on prospec-
tive cohort studies examining associations between adher-
ence to a Mediterranean diet and incident frailty and to
perform a meta-analysis to synthesize the pooled risk
estimates.
METHODS
Data Source and Search Strategy
A systematic search of the literature was conducted on
September 14, 2017, based on a protocol generated in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for
systematic reviews.18 The 5 databases used were Embase,
MEDLINE,
CINAHL
Plus,
PsycINFO,
and
Cochrane
Library (Table S1). We searched for studies published in
2000 or later, because the most commonly used frailty
phenotype criteria were first published in 2001.19 The
search terms used were a combination of Medical Subject
Heading (MeSH) and text terms, including “Mediter-
ranean diet” (MeSH) OR “Mediterranean*” AND “Frailty
Syndrome” (MeSH) OR “frail*.” We used explosion func-
tions where available and did not restrict the search by
language. We reviewed references of included studies and
relevant review papers and performed forward citation
tracking using Google Scholar for additional studies. We
also contacted corresponding authors for additional data
necessary for a meta-analysis.
Study Selection
Two reviewers (GK, CA) independently screened titles,
abstracts, and full texts to ascertain the eligibility of the
studies identified in the literature search. Disagreements
were resolved by discussion. Studies were included if they
involved community-dwelling older people with a mean
age of 60 and older; assessed adherence to a Mediter-
ranean diet using a tool such as the Mediterranean Diet
Score (MDS)17; prospectively examined risk of developing
frailty, defined using an original or modified version of val-
idated criteria designed to define frailty, according to
adherence to a Mediterranean diet at baseline; and pro-
vided odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), or risk ratios
(RRs) to quantify risk or sufficient information to calculate
these risk estimates.
Studies were excluded if they defined frailty according
to a single factor (e.g., being certified for long-term care
insurance) or an individual component of frailty criteria
(e.g., slow walking speed); used selected cohorts with
specific diseases or conditions; or were review papers,
randomized controlled trials, conference abstracts, com-
ments, or editorials.
Methodological Quality Assessment
We used the 9-item Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort
studies to assess methodological quality of eligible stud-
ies.20 A study was considered to have adequate method-
ological quality when the study met 5 criteria or more out
of 9.
Data Extraction
Two reviewers (GK, CA) independently extracted the fol-
lowing data from the included studies: first author, publi-
cation year, cohort name if any, location, sample size,
proportion of female participants, mean age, age range,
tool used to measure adherence to a Mediterranean diet,
frailty criteria, and follow-up period. We also extracted
risk estimates along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of
the final models and covariates used for adjustment.
Statistical Analysis
A meta-analysis was attempted when there were 3 or more
studies providing the same type of effect measures of
frailty risk and adherence to a Mediterranean diet was
based on the same tool. Adjusted effect measures were pre-
ferred to unadjusted ones when a study reported both. The
presence and degree of heterogeneity were assessed using
the chi-square test and I2 statistic, respectively, and I2 val-
ues of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered to be low,
moderate,
and
high
degrees
of
heterogeneity,
respec-
tively.21 A fixed-effects model was used if heterogeneity
was absent, and a random-effects model was used if
heterogeneity was present, to calculate a pooled risk esti-
mate using the generic inverse variance method. Publica-
tion bias was assessed using visual inspection of funnel
plots. If significant heterogeneity was observed, sensitivity
analysis, subgroup analysis, and random-effects metare-
gression analysis would be performed to further explore
the cause of the heterogeneity. Review Manager 5, version
5.2 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark)
was used for all analyses, and the level of significance was
set at P < .05.
RESULTS
Selection Process and Study Characteristics
Figure 1 presents the PRISMA flowchart of the study selec-
tion process. Of a total of 125 studies identified, 4 were
included (5,789 older people with a mean follow-up of
3.9 years), all of which met 7 or more of the 9 items of
the
Newcastle-Ottawa
scale
(mean
8.0,
range
7–9,
Table S2). Characteristics of the 4 included studies are
summarized in Table 1. All 4 studies used the MDS, which
is a tool used to measure adherence to the traditional
Mediterranean diet based on the salient characteristic of
this diet; scores range from 0 to 9, with a higher score
indicative of greater adherence.17 Three studies22–24 used
modified versions of the Cardiovascular Health Study

 frailty criteria, which is one of the most widely used mea-
sures to define physical frailty based on 5 criteria (uninten-
tional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness,
slow walking speed, low physical activity).19 One study25
used the FRAIL scale, which can measure frailty according
to the answers to 5 simple questions about fatigue, resis-
tance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight.26 Two
studies divided their cohort into 3 groups (MDS 0–3, 4–5,
6–9),23,24 and 1 study used sex-stratified tertiles.22 Two
studies used the MDS as a continuous variable.24,25 All 4
studies included in this review provided ORs of incident
frailty risks and used the MDS to measure adherence to a
Mediterranean diet,22–25 so ORs according to the MDS
were chosen for the meta-analysis. One of the 4 studies
showed results using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence
Screener as well.22 All ORs were adjusted for multiple
confounders, which included age, sex, education, marital
status, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, living status,
energy intake, medication, physical activity, and comor-
bidities (Table 1).
Adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and Risk of
Incident Frailty
ORs of incident frailty risk according to 3 MDS groups
(0–3, 4–5, 6–9) were available from 4 studies22–25 and
used for a fixed-effects meta-analysis because no significant
heterogeneity
(I2 = 0%,
P = .84;
I2 = 16%,
P = .31,
respectively) was observed. The forest plots are shown in
Figure 2. Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet was
associated with significantly lower incident frailty risks

OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.47–0.82, P = .001 for MDS 4–5;
pooled OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.31–0.64, P < .001 for
MDS 6–9). No obvious asymmetry was observed in the
funnel plots for either analysis. We repeated meta-analyses
using
a
random-effects
model
(4

pooled
OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.47–0.82, P = .001 for MDS 4–5;
pooled OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.29–0.66, P < .001 for
MDS 6–9) and excluding the Chinese study25 (3 studies:
pooled OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.44–0.82, P = .001 for
MDS
4–5;
pooled
OR = 0.40,
95%
CI = 0.27–0.65,
P < .001 for MDS 6–9). These made little difference in
our findings. Subgroup analysis and metaregression analy-
sis were not performed because of the low degree of
heterogeneity and the small number of included studies.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis identified 4 stud-
ies that included a total of 5,789 community-dwelling
older people followed for a mean 3.9 years and found that
greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet was significantly
associated with lower risk of incident frailty.
Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was measured
using the MDS17 in all the included studies. The MDS is
based on intake of food items specific to the traditional
Mediterranean
dietary
pattern:

 vegetables, legumes, nuts, cereals, fish, and olive oil (cou-
pled with low intake of saturated fats); low intake of meat
and dairy products; and regular but moderate intake of
alcohol, mostly wine.17 The beneficial effects of a Mediter-
ranean dietary pattern on frailty that we observed is con-
sistent with findings from a cross-sectional study of 923
older Taiwanese adults that explored 79 food items to find
the dietary pattern most protective against frailty using
reduced rank regression analysis.27 In the dietary pattern
identified as best for explaining frailty status, fresh fruits,
nuts and seeds, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and break-
fast cereals were among the top food items demonstrating
protective
effects
against
frailty
(factor
loading
value = �0.48, �0.39, �0.33, �0.27, �0.20, and �0.17,
respectively).27 Olive oil and wine were not included, per-
haps because this non-Mediterranean population did not
commonly consume them.
In addition to the Mediterranean diet, other dietary
patterns have been investigated and found to be associated
with future frailty risks. A “prudent” dietary pattern char-
acterized by high consumption of olive oil, vegetables,
potatoes, legumes, blue fish, pasta, and meat was identified
using principal component analysis and was shown to be
associated with lower risk of incident frailty over 3.5 years
of follow-up in 1,872 older Spanish adults.28 Another
study used the Three-City Study Bordeaux cohort of 972
older adults and showed that a “healthy” cluster defined
according to a hybrid clustering method, which is associ-
ated with high intake of fish in men and fruits and vegeta-
bles
in
women,
was
associated
with
lower
risk
of
developing frailty during a follow-up of 12 years.29 A
study from the Netherlands found that high adherence to
a “traditional” dietary pattern, characterized by a high
intake of savory snacks, legumes, eggs, fried potatoes,
alcohol, processed meat, and soup, was also associated
with less frailty defined according to the Frailty Index
4 years later.30 This effect was observed despite this diet-
ary pattern including foods such as fried potatoes and

 processed meat, which are associated with higher incidence
of cardiovascular disease. Three studies examined associa-
tions between quality of diet using the Dietary Quality
Index (based on dietary variety; adequacy of vegetables,
fruits, grains, fiber, protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin C;
moderation of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium,
and empty calorie foods; and overall balance of macronu-
trient ratio and fatty acid ratio)25,31 and the Dutch
Healthy Diet index (based on vegetables, fruits, fiber, fish
and fish oil, saturated fatty acid, trans-fatty acids, sodium,
and alcohol)30 and subsequent frailty risks and found that
higher dietary quality was consistently associated with
lower future frailty risks. These findings are at least par-
tially in line with ours in that some dietary components
are in common with a Mediterranean diet, such as olive
oil, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fish.
This study’s strengths include its robust methodology,
including a comprehensive and reproducible search strat-
egy following PRISMA guidelines.18 Two authors indepen-
dently reviewed the search results and extracted the data.
In addition, methodological quality, heterogeneity, and
publication bias were assessed. We were able to include all
4 of the studies in the meta-analysis by obtaining addi-
tional data from the authors of the original articles.22,25
All 4 studies had adequate methodological quality, and
there was low degree of heterogeneity in their findings.
Furthermore, all the effect measures combined in the meta-
analysis were fully adjusted for multiple confounders,
including age, sex and education, which should contribute
to the robustness of our synthesized results. Nevertheless,
the current study is not without limitations. Only a small
number
(n = 4)
of
studies
were
identified,
probably
because frailty research in relation to diet has only recently
emerged. Further studies are warranted to elucidate associ-
ations between the Mediterranean diet and frailty, in par-
ticular
in
non-Mediterranean
countries.
In
addition,
further information on which components of the Mediter-
ranean diet are associated with frailty (e.g. fruit and veg-
etable, red wine) and which components of frailty are
most affected (e.g. measure of muscle strength, exhaustion
or weight loss) would give further insight. Adherence to a
Mediterranean diet was measured using the MDS in all the
studies included. Although the MDS may be a good indi-
cator of adherence to a Mediterranean diet in Mediter-
ranean populations, its relevance to non-Mediterranean
populations is contested.32 Some of the MDS components
were based on actual food consumption with cut-points
specific to the study population (e.g., median value of the
intake), rather than based on the intake recommended in a
traditional Mediterranean diet.17 Therefore the findings
based on the MDS may not reflect true adherence to a
Mediterranean
diet,33
especially
in
non-Mediterranean
populations.25 Lastly, there may be potentially unmeasured
confounding because not all studies adjusted for factors
related to a healthier lifestyle in general, such as smoking,
alcohol, and physical activity.
There are several potential mechanisms underlying the
association between greater adherence to a Mediterranean
diet and lower risk of frailty. One possibility is the high
intake of foods rich in antioxidants. Fruits and vegetables
are rich in carotenoids and vitamins, and red wine con-
tains abundant polyphenols. Oxidative stress is a risk
factor for frailty,34 and fruits and vegetables rich in
antioxidants may decrease the risk of frailty by counteract-
ing oxidative status. Inflammation is another possible
explanation. Frail individuals have higher levels of inflam-
matory markers, and inflammation is considered to be clo-
sely associated with frailty.35 A Mediterranean diet is
associated with low levels of inflammatory markers36 and
may reduce frailty risk through this mechanism. Adherence
to a Mediterranean diet has been associated with better
cognitive function, lower rates of cognitive decline, and
lower
risks
of Alzheimer’s
disease
and
dementia.37,38
Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been associated
with lower incidence of cardiovascular disease39 and cer-
tain types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer.40 All of
the above may contribute to the accumulation of fewer
health deficits over time, resulting in a lower incidence of
frailty.
CONCLUSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis shows the first
pooled evidence that greater adherence to a Mediterranean
diet is associated with significantly lower risk of incident
frailty in community-dwelling older people. Related topics
warranting future research include a focus on which com-
ponents
or
combination
of
foods
contributes
to
the
decrease in frailty. We now also need studies to confirm
these findings and determine whether increasing adherence
to a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of frailty,
including in non-Mediterranean populations.
