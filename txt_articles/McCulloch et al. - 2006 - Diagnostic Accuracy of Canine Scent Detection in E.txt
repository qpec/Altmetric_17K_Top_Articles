Canine Scent Detection of Lung and Breast Cancers
Diagnostic Accuracy of Canine Scent Detection in
Early- and Late-Stage Lung and Breast Cancers
Michael McCulloch, Tadeusz Jezierski, Michael Broffman, Alan Hubbard, Kirk Turner,
and Teresa Janecki
Background: Lung and breast cancers are leading causes of
cancer death worldwide. Prior exploratory work has shown
that patterns of biochemical markers have been found in the
exhaled breath of patients with lung and breast cancers that
are distinguishable from those of controls. However, chemi-
cal analysis of exhaled breath has not shown suitability for
individual clinical diagnosis. Methods: The authors used a
food reward-based method of training 5 ordinary household
dogs to distinguish, by scent alone, exhaled breath samples
of 55 lung and 31 breast cancer patients from those of 83
healthy controls. A correct indication of cancer samples by
the dogs was sitting/lying in front of the sample. A correct
response to control samples was to ignore the sample. The
authors first trained the dogs in a 3-phase sequential process
with gradually increasing levels of challenge. Once trained,
the dogs’ ability to distinguish cancer patients from controls
was then tested using breath samples from subjects not pre-
viously encountered by the dogs. The researchers blinded
both dog handlers and experimental observers to the iden-
tity of breath samples. The diagnostic accuracy data re-
ported were obtained solely from the dogs’ sniffing, in
double-blinded conditions, of these breath samples ob-
tained from subjects not previously encountered by the dogs
during the training period. Results: Among lung cancer pa-
tients and controls, overall sensitivity of canine scent detec-
tion compared to biopsy-confirmed conventional diagnosis
was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99, 1.00) and over-
all specificity 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96, 1.00). Among breast can-
cer patients and controls, sensitivity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75,
1.00) and specificity 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90, 0.99). Sensitivity
and specificity were remarkably similar across all 4 stages of
both diseases. Conclusion: Training was efficient and cancer
identification was accurate; in a matter of weeks, ordinary
household dogs with only basic behavioral “puppy training”
were trained to accurately distinguish breath samples of lung
and breast cancer patients from those of controls. This pilot
work using canine scent detection demonstrates the validity
of using a biological system to examine exhaled breath in the
diagnostic identification of lung and breast cancers. Future
work should closely examine the chemistry of exhaled
breath to identify which chemical compounds can most
accurately identify the presence of cancer.

Early detection of cancer is a desirable goal as it often
allows treatment with lower toxicity and predicts lon-
ger survival. In many cancers, however, the limited
capabilities of existing diagnostic methods may con-
tribute to high cancer mortality.
When lung cancer is detected in early stages, surgi-
cal resection alone can achieve 5-year survival rates as
high as 50%.
1 However, chest x-ray and sputum cytol-
ogy have a high false-negative rate and therefore fail to
detect many early-stage cases.
1 Furthermore, com-
puted tomography (CT) scan, able to detect lesions as
small as 1 mm in diameter, produces many false
positives, which lead to unnecessary surgery for
biopsy.
2 The high false-positive rate of the CT scan can
be reduced through confirmation with positron emis-
sion tomography scan.
3
In breast cancer, although evidence suggests mam-
mography screening reduces breast cancer mortality
4,5
and allows treatment with lower toxicity,
6 there is still
uncertainty due to variable quality of studies
7 and
inconsistency of results across studies.
8 Mammogra-
phy screening detects noncancerous lesions, leading
to unnecessary testing, treatment, and anxiety.
9 In
addition, mammography is more likely to fail to detect
cancers in women with dense breast tissue.

 An alternate approach to these traditional diagnos-
tic tools has been the search to identify biomarkers
that could be identified through testing blood sam-
ples with analytical chemistry methods.
However, these methods have significant draw-
backs. In lung cancer, many biomarkers, when consid-
ered individually, have not shown suitability for use as
screening tests, and it is not yet clear what panel of
tests used together will provide sufficient diagnos-
tic sensitivity and specificity.
11,12 In breast cancer, evi-
dence is limited by a lack of assay standardization
and by studies that are too small and are not easily
comparable, with heterogeneous patient and tumor
characteristics.
13
Canine scent detection may possibly help over-
come some of these drawbacks due to the extraordi-
nary scenting ability of the dog’s nose, which has
detection thresholds as low as parts per trillion.
14,15 In
addition, the canine olfactory system appears to go
beyond simply low detection thresholds to the capabil-
ity of discriminating between complex chemical mix-
tures, such as would be found in exhaled human
breath.
Volatile organic compounds potentially diagnostic
of cancer, such as alkanes, methylated alkanes, aro-
matic compounds, and benzene derivatives, have
been identified using gas chromatography/mass spec-
troscopy (GCMS) in the exhaled breath of patients
with lung and breast cancers.
16-22 In both lung
19,22 and
breast cancers,
18 relative concentrations of these
exhaled compounds differ between patients and
healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, GCMS cannot
detect all or even nearly all chemicals present, poten-
tially missing the most important diagnostic markers.
Furthermore, it is not yet standard practice in cancer
diagnosis.
Case reports of patient-dog interactions leading to
cancer diagnoses first appeared in 1989
23 and then in
2001.
24 This was followed by intriguing evidence that
melanoma
25 and bladder cancers
26 could be detected
by dogs through their use of their scenting abilities.
In the present study, we set out to explore 3 ques-
tions. Our first objective was to see whether ordinary
dogs, with no prior scent discrimination training,
could be rapidly trained to identify lung and breast
cancer patients by smelling samples of their breath
when compared to blank unused sample tubes. Our
second objective was to investigate whether dogs
could distinguish breath samples of lung and breast
cancer patients from those of healthy controls. Finally,
we sought to examine whether the dog’s diagnostic
performance would be affected by disease stage of
cancer patients and age, smoking, or most recently
eaten meal among either cancer patients or controls.
Methods
Patients and Control Breath Donors
Eligible patients were men and women older than 18
years with a very recent biopsy-confirmed conven-
tional diagnosis of lung or breast cancer. We specifi-
cally requested that recruitment centers refer patients
as soon as possible following definitive diagnosis so
that breath sampling would not interfere with or delay
planned conventional treatment. As we suspected that
chemotherapy treatment would change the exhaled
chemicals in cancer patients, we sought patients who
had not yet undergone chemotherapy treatment. As
we also suspected that patients with more advanced
disease, and thus larger tumors, might be exhaling
higher concentrations of the chemicals associated
with cancer cells and would therefore be more easily
identified by the dogs, we sought patients with any
stage disease.
We recruited both patients and controls through
local medical centers (Pine Street Clinic, San
Anselmo, Calif; Golden Gate Center for Integrative
Cancer Care, San Francisco, Calif; California Cancer
Care, Greenbrae, Calif). All subjects, both patients
and controls, completed a questionnaire about factors
we thought could affect exhaled chemicals in the
breath: age, current or past smoking, diabetes, dental
infection, and most recently eaten meal (described
below; see “Analysis”). We recruited 55 patients (35
men and 20 women) with lung cancer and 31 patients
(1 man and 30 women) with breast cancer (Table 1).
We also recruited as controls 83 volunteers with no
prior cancer history. Excluded patients were those
who responded to our study recruitment brochure
after having begun standard therapy or for whom a
positive biopsy report was not available.
All subjects provided written informed consent.
Our protocol and patient recruitment materials were
approved by an institutional review board (Independ-
ent Review Consulting, Corte Madera, Calif). In addi-
tion, our animal-training and -handling methods were
designed in consultation with 2 veterinarians, an inde-
pendent dog trainer, and the dog owners, all of whom
approved our methods. We did not provide any com-
pensation to subjects for providing breath samples or
to dog owners for volunteering use of their dogs in the
study.
Equipment and Breath Sampling
For breath sampling, we obtained a cylindrical poly-
propylene organic vapor sampling tube (Defencetek,
Pretoria, South Africa). Each tube is open at either
end, is 6 inches long, has an outer diameter of 1 inch,
has an inner diameter of 0.75 inches, and has remov-

 able end caps. A removable 2-inch-long insert of sili-
cone oil-coated polypropylene “wool” captures
volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath as
breath passes through the tube.
To collect breath samples, we asked donors to
exhale 3 to 5 times through the tube. We then fitted
the tubes with their end caps and sealed them in ordi-
nary grocery store Ziplock-style bags at room tempera-
ture between the time of breath sampling and presen-
tation to the dogs.
We believed that breath from deep in the lungs,
where oxygen exchange takes place, would contain a
higher concentration of exhaled chemical com-
pounds potentially diagnostic of cancer. Therefore,
we asked subjects to make their exhalations through
the tube as long and deep as comfortably possible. We
stopped sampling if subjects became breathless,
began to cough, or did not want to continue; thus, the
number of breath sample tubes we were able to collect
per subject ranged from 4 to 18.
For each person sampled, all of the breath samples
were collected during 1 visit. The researcher gather-
ing breath samples was asked to subjectively note
whether the forcefulness of subjects’ breathing
through the tube was “mild” or “strong.” Because of
variations in recruitment rates and the limited window
of time between date of diagnosis and beginning of
chemotherapy, sample storage time varied between 1
and 60 days.
Dogs
Five dogs, aged 7 to 18 months, were chosen from a to-
tal of 13: 3 Labrador retrievers (2 males and 1 female)
and 2 Portuguese water dogs (1 male and 1 female).
Dogs were provided by local dog owners and by Guide
Dogs for the Blind (San Rafael, Calif). Our selection
criteria called for dogs older than 6 months with basic
obedience training typically given to household pets,
as defined by the American Kennel Club. The experi-
menters screened recruited dogs for their level of ea-
gerness to sniff objects and respond to commands.
Our training method was a reward-based approach in
which the correct behavior is rewarded by simulta-
neously activating a clicker device and presenting a
food snack. Between training sessions, dogs were
housed in clean, well-ventilated kennel crates appro-
priate for the size of each dog. Water was freely avail-
able, and high-value treats were provided during each
morning’s training and testing session. Between each
trial, which lasted approximately 10 minutes, each dog
was allowed time for free play with dog handlers and
was given access to a large fenced play yard. Veterinary
care was made available to each dog; however, it was
not needed as all dogs completed training and testing
without any adverse events and no dogs experienced
any injury or illness during the course of our study. In
Table 2, we illustrate the sequential training and test-
ing process we used to first train dogs to detect cancer
samples, then distinguish them from controls, and
finally test their discrimination ability in a double-
blind design.
Experimental Setup

 ambient temperatures during our study (March
through August) ranged from 68°F to 75°F. At the end
of each working day, the floor was cleaned with
Murphy’s Oil Soap and water.
Personnel. During training phases, dog handlers led
the dogs on a leash one at a time into the room and,
with praise, encouraged the dogs to sniff the stations
with a simple command: “Go to work!” Two investiga-
tors observed from behind a curtain, concealed from
the dogs and handlers.
Breath sample stations. We positioned 5 sample sta-
tions on the floor of the room in a single straight line
spaced 1 yard apart. Each station consisted of a poly-
propylene plastic storage container measuring 15 in.
long, 12 in. wide, and 10 in. tall. Each station also con-
tained a well 8 in. deep within which we placed the
breath sample tubes. To prevent the dog’s nose from
touching the breath sample tubes, we placed the
breath sample tubes in clear half-pint polypropylene
containers measuring 4.5-in. wide by 1.5-in. tall and
used new container covers for each trial. To allow
exchange of air and exhaled breath chemicals, 7 holes
measuring a quarter inch in diameter were drilled
into the canister lids.
Breath sample locations. A single trial consisted of a
dog walking past and sniffing each of the 5 stations (1
cancer patient breath sample and 4 control subject
breath samples). After each of the 5 dogs in succession
had sniffed the lineup of sample stations, both patient
and control breath samples were replaced with new
samples. To prevent dogs from predicting the location
of the cancer patient breath samples, the experi-
menter rotated the location of the cancer breath sam-
ple within the 5 stations using a random number table.
One day’s training consisted of 5 trials performed by
all 5 dogs, 4 times within a day (total of 100 trials per
day).
Classification of dogs’ response. Correct responses
were (1) indicating by a sitting or lying down response
directly in front of a sample station containing a can-
cer sample (a true positive in sensitivity calculations)
and (2) sniffing but not indicating on a control sample

 (true negative). Incorrect responses were (1) indicat-
ing on a control sample (false positive), (2) sniffing
but not indicating on a cancer sample (false negative),
and (3) hesitation, an incomplete reaction either
toward cancer or control samples (either false-positive
or false-negative depending on whether hesitation was
on a cancer or control sample).
Training
Training consisted of 3 phases (Table 2). For each dog,
each training phase was considered completed when
he or she could correctly distinguish, for at least 30
consecutive trials, the cancer patient’s breath sample
from among those of 4 controls, in the experimental
lineup of 5 breath samples.
During phase 1 of training, the location of the can-
cer breath sample was known by both experimenter
and trainer (Table 2). One station contained a cancer
breath sample, and the remaining 4 stations con-
tained blank sample tubes that had not been used in
any breath sampling. To encourage the dogs to seek
out the exhaled chemicals associated with cancer, we
placed a piece of dog food in the station with the can-
cer breath sample and covered the container with a
piece of paper so the food would not be visible. Dogs
walked unleashed past the stations. We did not assign
any time limit on the amount of time the dogs spent
sniffing samples or the number of times a dog could
sniff any sample. To train the dogs to indicate on a can-
cer sample, when the dog sniffed the station contain-
ing the cancer breath sample, an investigator would
trigger the clicker device, signaling the dog handler to
issue the “sit” command, praise the dog, and offer the
dog a food reward before leading him or her out of the
room. A trial was considered complete when the
clicker was activated, whereupon the dog handler
would lead the dog out of the room.
During phase 2 of training, only the experimenter
was aware of the location of the cancer breath sample
and apart from encouraging the dog with encourag-
ing phrases such as “go to work,” gave no “sit” or other
verbal commands to the dog. Clicker signal by the
experimenter and subsequent food reward and praise
by the trainer were given only after the dog correctly
indicated on the cancer breath sample. When the dog
indicated incorrectly on a control, the experimenter
would not signal with the clicker and the handler
would remain silent, not give the dog any praise
reward, and mildly rebuke the dog by saying “no.”
Samples used in phases 1 and 2 (contaminated with
food scent) were not used again.
Phase 3 of training was identical to phase 2, except
that food was no longer placed with the cancer breath
samples (Table 2). In summary, this training phase was
to train dogs to detect cancer patient breath samples.
Testing: Single-Blinded Experiment
During the single-blinded canine scent-testing experi-
ment, using samples previously used in phase 3 of
training, the level of challenge to the dogs was in-
creased by placing a cancer breath sample in 1 station
and control subject breath samples in the remaining 4
stations. Thus, dogs now had to distinguish cancer pa-
tient breath samples from those of healthy controls.
Furthermore, the handler was blinded to the location
and status of patient and control breath samples. Al-
though the experimenter did not know the location
and status of patient and control breath samples dur-
ing the single-blinded experiments, the possibility of
the experimenter giving the dogs cues was minimized
by positioning the experimenter in an adjacent room,
behind an opaque curtain that almost completely
covered the doorway between the training and
observation rooms.
Testing: Double-Blinded Experiment
We designed our double-blinded experiment so that
each dog would have the opportunity to sniff breath
samples from each subject and each control. During
the entire double-blinded testing phase, all breath
samples sniffed by dogs, for both cases and controls,
were from completely different subjects not previously
encountered by the dogs during training or single-
blinded testing. Furthermore, all of these breath sam-
ples used during double-blinded testing, for both
cases and controls, contribute to the overall results re-
ported in Table 3. For each trial, we used a random-
number table to determine the location of the sample
being tested in the lineup.
All other methods were identical to the single-
blinded testing phase, except that we now (1) placed
the target breath sample of interest, whether from
patient or control, within the lineup along with 4
other controls and (2) blinded both the experiment-
ers and dog handlers to the status of that target sample
in the lineup. Whereas in the single-blinded experi-
ments only the dog handler was blinded to knowledge
of the target sample, in the double-blinded experi-
ments, both handler and experimenter were blinded
to ensure that neither experimenters nor handlers
could be giving any clues to the dogs. Since the experi-
menters now no longer knew the status of the target
breath sample, they did not activate the clicker device
after a sitting indication by the dog, and therefore the
handler did not reward the dog with any food. After
being given the opportunity to sniff and indicate on
samples, the dog was simply led out of the room. Only
after leaving the training room was the dog acknowl-
edged with the phrase “good work!” During double-
blinded testing, each tube was used a median of 20
times (x = 32.35, SD = 24.46; range, 4-99).

Data Management and Analysis
During both the training and testing phases, experi-
menters monitored each trial, recording observations
both on paper and videotape. We audited the entire
data set of dog performance for accuracy, comparing
paper to videotape records.
Diagnostic accuracy of the double-blinded testing
phase was calculated as sensitivity and specificity of the
dogs’ indication of breath samples compared to
biopsy-confirmed conventional diagnosis. Confi-
dence intervals for sensitivity and specificity were esti-
mated using general estimating equations (GEE) ran-
dom effects linear regression, with standard errors
adjusted for clustering on donor.
27 The dogs’ response
to each of the 5 samples sniffed was included in our
analysis; dogs were allowed the opportunity to visit
each sample station and thus could have potentially
indicated every one of the samples in a trial, although
in our experiments, this never occurred. Dog han-
dlers did not try to prevent dogs from visiting any indi-
vidual station. Therefore, since each individual sam-
ple station was considered as a unit of analysis, the use
of 4 control subject breath samples along with a cancer
patient sample in each experimental trial would not
change sensitivity or specificity.
During each double-blinded experimental trial,
since neither experimenter nor handler knew the
location of the cancer sample, there were no clicker
activation or food rewards offered to the dogs. Never-
theless, to examine whether there was systematic
change in the dogs’ ability to detect a subject’s breath
sample after sniffing it more than once during the
series of double-blinded experimental trials, we esti-
mated sensitivity and specificity at 2 points: (1) for the
all double-blinded trials combined and (2) only the
first occurrence of each dog-subject combination.
We used the Fisher 2-sided exact test to test for dif-
ferences between patients and controls in the follow-
ing characteristics: sampling (time from breath sam-
pling to dog sniffing as well as forcefulness of breath
during sampling) and donor characteristics from
questionnaire (age, smoking, diabetes, dental infec-
tion, and most recent eating of foods that may affect
breath, such as fish, spicy foods, alcohol, lamb, pork,
coffee, tea, and garlic).
Results
Effectiveness of Training
Each of our 5 dogs, who entered our study with only
basic behavioral puppy training, completed our scent
detection training within 2 to 3 weeks’ time. During
the 3 phases of training, we used the breath samples
from 27 lung cancer patients, 25 breast cancer pa-
tients, and 66 controls.
Diagnostic Accuracy: Sensitivity and Specificity
in Double-Blind Testing
During double-blinded testing, we used the breath
samples from 28 lung cancer patients, 6 breast cancer
patients, and 17 controls. To calculate sensitivity and
specificity, we counted the dogs’ response to each sam-
ple sniffed as the unit of analysis (defined above, “Clas-
sification of Dogs’ Response”).
Among lung cancer patients and controls, as com-
pared to biopsy-confirmed conventional diagnosis,
overall sensitivity of canine scent detection was 0.99
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99, 1.00) and overall
specificity was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96, 1.00; Table 3).
These results were GEE adjusted for confounding by
the presence of current smoking among 4 lung cancer
patients (Table 3).
Among breast cancer patients and controls, overall
sensitivity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75, 1.00) and overall
specificity 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90, 0.99). For both cancers,
sensitivity and specificity were remarkably similar
across all 4 stages of disease (Table 3).
Sensitivity and specificity were virtually identical at
the 2 points analyzed: (1) for all double-blinded trials
combined and (2) for only the first occurrence of each
dog-donor combination, suggesting that there was no
systematic increase in learning by the dogs as the
double-blinded testing process continued.
To compare dogs, we counted each trial of 5 breath
samples as the unit of analysis, in which the possible
responses were simply categorized as “located cancer”
or “failed to locate cancer”; the only correct response
in this analysis was when the dogs performed perfectly
(correctly locating the cancer sample and ignoring all
4 control samples). There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in accuracy between the 5 different
dogs (�

Several recruitment protocol exceptions occurred
during our study. The first protocol exception was 3

 patients who had been previously treated for cancer
and were in remission at the time of our study. For 1
patient in remission from breast cancer, in 24 of 25
scent trials, the dogs indicated on her breath samples,
thus considering her to be a “patient.” She continued
diagnostic surveillance, including 1 negative mag-
netic resonance imaging scan 12 months later; 18
months after being identified by the dogs as a cancer
case, she was found to have a local recurrence of her
breast cancer in the surgical margins. For the other 2
patients in remission, one with lung cancer and the
other breast cancer, the dogs did not indicate, thus
considering them to be “controls” (90 of 90 trials and
46 of 47 trials). The second protocol exception was 2
patients with lung cancer whose chemotherapy had al-
ready begun. In 20 trials, the dogs indicated on these 2
patients with markedly lower sensitivity (40.4%).
Analysis for Potential Confounders
Time from sampling to testing. There was no statisti-
cally significant difference between patients and con-
trols in the time from breath sampling to testing (P =
.52, Fisher 2-sided exact test; Table 5).
Age. There was a statistically significant difference
in age distribution between patients and controls (P <
.001). Since there were no cancer patients younger
than 44 years, we dropped from the analysis the 15
controls that were younger than 44. In this restricted
analysis, no association between age and cancer status
remained between patients and controls (P = 1.00).
Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity remained
virtually unchanged.
Breast cancer. There was no statistically significant
difference between patients and controls in either cur-
rent smoking (no current smokers among patients) or
past smoking (P = 1.00).
Lung cancer. There was an association by current
smoking (P = .01) but not for past smoking (P = .57).
We therefore adjusted our analysis of overall sensitivity
and specificity in lung cancer patients by current
smoking.
Interpretation
Using a simple and inexpensive training method, we
trained dogs to distinguish breath samples of lung and
breast cancer patients from those of healthy controls
in only 2 to 3 weeks’ time. Among lung cancer patients
and controls, overall sensitivity of canine scent detec-
tion compared to biopsy-confirmed conventional di-
agnosis was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99, 1.00) and overall
specificity 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96, 1.00). Among breast
cancer patients and controls, sensitivity was 0.88 (95%
CI, 0.75, 1.00) and specificity 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90,
0.99). The lack of any statistically significant evidence
of differences in accuracy between dogs suggests that
our training method can be applied to different dogs
with similar results. However, our article is subject to
limitations.
Our high sensitivity compares favorably with that of
chest x-ray in detecting early-stage lung cancer, and
our high specificity compares favorably with that of CT
scan in ruling out lung cancer. In addition, our high
sensitivity compares favorably with that of mammogra-
phy in detecting breast cancer, and our high specificity
compares favorably with that of mammography in rul-
ing out breast cancer. However, our specificity may be
overestimated because we used only healthy controls
(rather than a broad spectrum of subjects that
included, for example, those with bronchitis or
emphysema as controls for lung cancer or those with
fibrocystic breast disease or mastitis as controls for
breast cancer). These questions could be better
understood by further study in a prospective cohort
design that included both cases and controls repre-
senting the full spectrum of disease severity seen in the
general population.
Although we measured for potential confounding
by other odors, our dogs may nevertheless have
detected and responded to odors associated with can-
cer, such as inflammation, infection, or necrosis
rather than to cancer specifically. That question could

 be answered in follow-up research that includes both
healthy controls and those with nonmalignant inflam-
matory conditions and in whom we specifically exam-
ine the chemistry of exhaled breath.
Current smoking varied between lung cancer
patients and controls. Although after adjusting for
confounding by smoking high sensitivity and specific-
ity remained, the design of future trials should include
specific recruitment strategies to avoid differences in
smoking status between patients and controls.
Because there was no statistically significant differ-
ence between patients and controls in the most
recently eaten meal, we do not yet know whether sig-
nificant differences between patients and controls
with respect to odors on the breath associated with
dietary factors could interfere with training and scent-
ing accuracy of dogs. A larger study with appropriately
sequenced training methods may help resolve this
uncertainty. In addition, future work should use spe-
cific recruitment strategies to minimize confounding
between patients and controls and a prospective
cohort design that includes both cases and controls,
representing the full spectrum of disease severity seen
in the general population. Future research should
combine and compare canine scent detection and
analytical chemistry methods to identify the optimal
diagnostic applications for each method. Breath anal-
ysis may provide a substantial reduction in the
uncertainty currently seen in cancer diagnosis.
