BACKGROUND
We reported previously that, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were at 
moderate-to-high risk for death, a restrictive transfusion strategy was noninferior to 
a liberal strategy with respect to the composite outcome of death from any cause, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis by hospital 
discharge or 28 days after surgery, whichever came first. We now report the clinical 
outcomes at 6 months after surgery.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 5243 adults undergoing cardiac surgery to a restrictive red-cell 
transfusion strategy (transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration was <7.5 g per 
deciliter intraoperatively or postoperatively) or a liberal red-cell transfusion strategy 
(transfusion if the hemoglobin concentration was <9.5 g per deciliter intraopera-
tively or postoperatively when the patient was in the intensive care unit [ICU] or was 
<8.5 g per deciliter when the patient was in the non-ICU ward). The primary com-
posite outcome was death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-
onset renal failure with dialysis occurring within 6 months after the initial surgery. 
An expanded secondary composite outcome included all the components of the pri-
mary outcome as well as emergency department visit, hospital readmission, or coro-
nary revascularization occurring within 6 months after the index surgery. The second-
ary outcomes included the individual components of the two composite outcomes.
RESULTS
At 6 months after surgery, the primary composite outcome had occurred in 402 of 2317 
patients (17.4%) in the restrictive-threshold group and in 402 of 2347 patients (17.1%) 
in the liberal-threshold group (absolute risk difference before rounding, 0.22 percent-
age points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.95 to 2.39; odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 
to 1.18; P 
= 
0.006 for noninferiority). Mortality was 6.2% in the restrictive-threshold 
group and 6.4% in the liberal-threshold group (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.21). 
There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were at moderate-to-high risk for death, 
a restrictive strategy for red-cell transfusion was noninferior to a liberal strategy with 
respect to the composite outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis at 6 months after surgery. (Funded by

Six-Month Outcomes of Restrictive or Liberal Transfusion
R
estrictive strategies for red-cell 
transfusion (in which lower hemoglobin 
concentrations are used for transfusion) 
in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have been 
shown to result in the use of fewer units of allo-
geneic red cells than liberal strategies (in which 
higher hemoglobin concentrations are used for 
transfusion) and to produce short-term clinical 
outcomes that are noninferior to those with lib-
eral strategies.1,2 However, findings from observa-
tional and randomized studies have aroused con-
cerns about the effects of transfusion strategies on 
longer-term outcomes, because both anemia and 
allogeneic transfusion can have effects that per-
sist beyond hospitalization for surgery. Anemia 
can lead to tissue hypoxia in patients who are at 
high risk for perioperative complications, and per-
sistent anemia-induced tissue hypoxia may be det-
rimental in such patients.3 Allogeneic transfusion 
has short-term and long-lasting effects on the in-
nate and adaptive immune system, which can po-
tentially lead to poor clinical outcomes.4-8 There-
fore, although a short-term noninferiority between 
transfusion approaches may be shown, it is plau-
sible that subacute or protracted anemia, immune 
modulation, or both may affect intermediate-term 
and long-term outcomes. Indeed, in the Transfu-
sion Indication Threshold Reduction (TITRe2) 
randomized, controlled trial that compared post-
operative restrictive transfusion thresholds with 
liberal transfusion thresholds, no significant dif-
ference in mortality was observed at 30 days, but 
by 90 days, mortality was significantly higher in 
the restrictive-threshold group than in the liberal-
threshold group (4.2% vs. 2.6%; hazard ratio for 
death, 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 
2.67; P 
= 
0.045).9
We conducted the Transfusion Requirements 
in Cardiac Surgery (TRICS) III trial to compare a 
restrictive transfusion strategy with a liberal strat-
egy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with 
cardiopulmonary bypass who had at least a mod-
erate risk of death. To overcome some of the limi-
tations in previous trials, we conducted TRICS III 
in a wide range of hospitals and countries and 
enrolled more than 5000 patients. We found no 
significant differences in outcomes between the 
restrictive-threshold group and the liberal-thresh-
old group within 28 days after surgery,1 findings 
that are similar to those from the TITRe2 trial.9 
We prospectively evaluated and now report the 
6-month clinical outcomes in the TRICS III trial.
Methods
Trial Design
The TRICS III trial was a randomized, open-label, 
noninferiority trial that compared a restrictive 
red-cell transfusion strategy with a liberal strat-
egy in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
with cardiopulmonary bypass who were at mod-
erate-to-high predicted risk for death, as defined 
by an additive European System for Cardiac Op-
erative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) I score of 6 or 
higher (on a scale from 0 to 47, with higher scores 
indicating a higher risk of death after cardiac 
surgery); in-hospital primary outcomes were adju-
dicated in a blinded manner. The trial protocol and 
in-hospital results have been published previous-
ly.1,10 The final 6-month statistical analysis plan 
is included in the current trial protocol, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The trial was designed by the executive com-
mittee and was carried out by the investigators 
(a complete list of investigators and sites is pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). The trial was funded by national peer-
review organizations. The funders had no role in 
the design or conduct of the trial; in the collec-
tion, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or in 
the preparation, review, or approval of the manu-
script for submission. The authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Ethics ap-
proval was provided by all relevant local institu-
tional review boards. An independent data and 
safety monitoring board provided trial oversight.
Patients
We enrolled patients who were scheduled to 
undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary 
bypass and who had a preoperative additive 
EuroSCORE I score of 6 or higher. We excluded 
patients who were unable to receive blood prod-
ucts, declined blood products, were participating 
in a preoperative autologous blood donation pro-
gram, were undergoing heart transplantation, were 
having surgery solely for the insertion of a ven-
tricular assist device, or were pregnant or lactat-
ing. All participants provided written informed 
consent.
The patients who were randomly assigned to 
the restrictive transfusion strategy received a red-
cell transfusion if their hemoglobin concentration 
was less than 7.5 g per deciliter intraoperatively

or postoperatively. The patients who were ran-
domly assigned to the liberal transfusion strat-
egy received a red-cell transfusion if their hemo-
globin concentration was less than 9.5 g per 
deciliter intraoperatively or postoperatively when 
the patient was in the intensive care unit (ICU) or 
was less than 8.5 g per deciliter when the patient 
was in the non-ICU ward. The treating physicians 
followed the transfusion protocol until 28 days 
after surgery or hospital discharge, whichever 
came first.
Outcomes
The prespecified 6-month primary composite out-
come included the same components of the pri-
mary composite outcome in our initial trial1,10: 
death from any cause, myocardial infarction, new 
focal neurologic deficit (stroke), or new-onset re-
nal failure with dialysis occurring within 6 months 
after the index surgery. An expanded secondary 
composite outcome included all the components 
of the primary outcome as well as emergency de-
partment visit, hospital readmission, or coronary 
revascularization occurring within 6 months after 
the index surgery. The secondary outcomes in-
cluded the individual components of the two com-
posite outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses of the primary composite outcome 
and secondary outcomes were performed on a per-
protocol basis and included all patients who had 
undergone randomization and underwent surgery 
with cardiopulmonary bypass, except those who 
had a protocol adherence of less than 90%, who 
were withdrawn from the trial by the treating 
physician, or who withdrew consent. The primary 
composite outcome was analyzed for noninferi-
ority with the use of the same 3 percentage-point 
margin of noninferiority (at a one-sided alpha level 
of 0.025) that was defined for the primary out-
come analysis in our initial trial. The trial was 
originally designed to have at least 85% power to 
detect noninferiority with the use of a noninfe-
riority margin of 3 percentage points for the be-
tween-group difference in the percentage of pa-
tients who had a primary composite outcome event 
from the start of surgery until hospital discharge 
or 28 days after surgery, whichever came first.1,10 
Analyses of the primary composite outcome in-
cluded an unadjusted comparison of the percent-
ages of patients who had a primary composite 
outcome event against the noninferiority margin 
as well as calculation of an unadjusted odds ratio 
(for comparison with the adjusted analyses). In 
addition, the adjusted treatment effect on an odds-
ratio scale (with 95% confidence intervals) was 
estimated with the use of logistic regression to 
control for age, sex, diabetes, type of surgery, pre-
existing pulmonary disease, baseline creatinine 
clearance and hemoglobin concentration, and left 
ventricular function at baseline.
The adjusted treatment effects (with two-sided 
95% confidence intervals) for each of the remain-
ing outcomes, including the expanded secondary 
composite outcome, were estimated with the same 
variables that were used in the adjusted analysis 
of the primary composite outcome. The time to 
death was summarized with the use of Kaplan–
Meier curves, and the treatment groups were com-
pared with the use of the log-rank test.
Subgroup analyses were performed to deter-
mine whether the effect of the transfusion strat-
egy varied according to prespecified subgroups. 
Subgroup-specific estimates of the treatment ef-
fect and P values for interaction were derived from 
both unadjusted and adjusted models that included 
all the variables used to define the subgroups. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed in subgroups 
of patients that were defined according to proto-
col adherence, transfusion exposure, hemoglobin 
concentrations, and study site. Modified inten-
tion-to-treat analyses of the primary and second-
ary outcomes examined the consistency of the 
treatment effect. Because the widths of 95% confi-
dence intervals of absolute risk differences and 
odds ratios of secondary outcomes were not ad-
justed for multiple comparisons, these intervals 
should not be used for inference about treatment 
effects.
Data for this report may be shared in accor-
dance with a data-sharing agreement. Analyses 
were performed with the use of the R statistical 
package, version 3.4.3 (R Core Team, November

Six-Month Outcomes of Restrictive or Liberal Transfusion
sis (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Six-
month follow-up data on the primary outcome 
were available for 96% of the patients. The base-
line characteristics were well balanced between 
groups (Table 1). Patients in the restrictive-thresh-
old group received fewer units of red cells during 
transfusion and were less likely to receive a trans-
fusion than those in the liberal-threshold group; 
they also had a lower mean predischarge hemo-
globin concentration (Table 1).
Clinical Outcomes
At 6 months, a primary outcome event had oc-
curred in 402 of 2317 patients (17.4%) in the re-
strictive-threshold group and in 402 of 2347 
patients (17.1%) in the liberal-threshold group 
(absolute risk difference before rounding, 0.22 
percentage points; 95% CI, −1.95 to 2.39; odds ra-
tio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.18) (Table 2). The 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 
the absolute risk difference in the primary out-
come was below the prespecified 3 percentage-
point noninferiority margin (P 
= 
0.006). Similar 
results were obtained in the intention-to-treat 
population (absolute risk difference, 0.44 percent-
age points; 95% CI, −1.72 to 2.60; odds ratio, 
1.03; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.19; P 
= 
0.01 for noninfe-
riority). There were no significant between-group 
differences in the individual components of the 
primary composite outcome in both the per-pro-
tocol analysis and the modified intention-to-treat 
analysis (Table 2, and Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
At 6 months of follow-up, 141 of 2291 patients 
(6.2%) in the restrictive-threshold group had died, 
as compared with 149 of 2318 patients (6.4%) 
in the liberal-threshold group (odds ratio, 0.95; 
95% CI, 0.75 to 1.21). Time to death is shown in 
Figure 1.
The expanded secondary composite outcome 
that included the components of the primary 
composite outcomes plus hospital readmission, 
emergency department visit, or coronary revas-
cularization occurred in 43.8% of patients in the 
restrictive-threshold group and in 42.8% of pa-
tients in the liberal-threshold group (odds ratio, 
1.04; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.17). There were no signifi-
cant between-group differences in the individual 
components of the expanded secondary compos-
ite outcome (Table 2).
Subgroup analyses of the primary outcome 
identified a qualitative interaction between trans-
fusion strategy and age but not between transfu-
sion strategy and other variables (Fig. 2). The re-
strictive transfusion strategy was associated with 
a lower risk of the primary composite outcome 
than the liberal strategy among patients 75 years 
of age or older, whereas the liberal strategy was 
associated with a lower risk of the primary com-
posite outcome than the restrictive strategy among 
patients younger than 75 years of age. This effect 
was consistent in the analyses according to de-
cades of age (Fig. 2) (P 
= 
0.004 for interaction), 
with dichotomization at age 75 years (P 
= 
0.001 
for interaction), with age as a continuous variable 
with the use of restricted cubic splines (P 
= 
0.006 
for interaction), after adjustment for all the vari-
ables used to define the subgroups (Figs. S2 and 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Adjusted 
analyses in which logistic regression was used to 
control for age, sex, preoperative renal function, 
diabetes, left ventricular function, pulmonary 
disease, and type of surgery yielded results that 
were consistent with those of the primary analy-
ses (Fig. S3 and Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Sensitivity analyses that included only 
the populations with at least 70%, at least 80%, 
and 100% adherence to the transfusion protocol 
or that excluded patients who had a protocol 
suspension, who did not receive a red-cell trans-
fusion during the first 28 days of hospitalization 
after the index surgery, or who had a hemoglobin 
concentration that was never measured below 
9.5 g per deciliter during the trial also yielded 
results that were consistent with those of the 
primary analyses (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Discussion
The 6-month follow-up of the TRICS III trial 
showed that, in patients who had a moderate-
to-high risk of death after cardiac surgery, a re-
strictive strategy of red-cell transfusion was non-
inferior to a liberal strategy in terms of the 
prespecified primary composite outcome of death 
from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or 
renal failure with dialysis. At 6 months, there were 
no significant differences between the restrictive 
strategy and the liberal strategy in the individual 
components of the primary composite outcome 
and of the expanded composite outcome that in-
cluded hospital readmission, emergency depart-
ment visit, or coronary revascularization.

sented for the per‑protocol population (all the participants who had undergone randomization and who underwent surgery with cardiopul‑
monary bypass, except for patients who had a protocol adherence of less than 90%, patients who were withdrawn from the trial by the treat‑
ing physician at any time, and patients who withdrew consent). Details on baseline characteristics and transfusion outcomes of the inten‑
tion‑to‑treat population are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The restrictive transfusion threshold was a hemoglobin 
concentration of less than 7.5 g per deciliter intraoperatively and postoperatively, and the liberal transfusion threshold was a hemoglobin 
concentration of less than 9.5 g per deciliter intraoperatively or postoperatively when the patient was in the intensive care unit (ICU) or less

of 6 is predictive of increased risk. Data were missing for two patients in the restrictive‑threshold group and for three in the liberal‑threshold 
group.

Six-Month Outcomes of Restrictive or Liberal Transfusion
Both transfusion and anemia have been as-
sociated with adverse short-term and long-term 
outcomes after surgery. Observational studies have 
shown an association between red-cell transfusion 
and increased mortality and major morbidity with-
in 10 years after cardiac surgery.4-7 This may be 
mediated in part by the immunomodulatory ef-
fects of red-cell transfusion, which can produce 
both immunosuppressive and proinflammatory 
effects and lead to the development of infection 
or organ dysfunction.8 In addition, the perception 
that allogeneic red-cell transfusion is associated 
with risk is prevalent among patients, with 20% 
of patients perceiving that transfusion is very of-
ten or always risky.11 Activation of adaptive hy-
poxic mechanisms has been shown in models of 
short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term 
anemia,12,13 suggesting that prolonged, anemia-
induced reductions in tissue oxygen delivery may 
place an ongoing hypoxic burden that could pro-
mote adverse outcomes, a finding that has been 
reported in observational studies and in patients 
with cardiovascular disease.14-21

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The primary composite outcome was death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new‑onset 
renal failure with dialysis within 6 months after the index surgery. The expanded secondary composite outcome was death from any cause, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, new‑onset renal failure with dialysis, coronary revascularization, hospital readmission, or emergency depart‑

None of the between‑group differences in secondary outcomes were significant after Bonferroni correction that accounted for multiple com‑
parisons. Because the widths of 95% confidence intervals of secondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, these inter‑
vals should not be used for inference about treatment effects.

Randomized, controlled trials and meta-analy-
ses of studies of cardiac surgery have reported 
no significant differences in short-term outcomes 
with restrictive transfusion as compared with lib-
eral transfusion, but the long-term effects have 
not been well described.1,2,9,22-25 Until the current 
analysis, the longest follow-up duration in a 
randomized, controlled trial was 90 days (in the 
TITRe2 trial). In that trial, there was no signifi-
cant difference between the liberal-transfusion 
group and the restrictive-transfusion group in 
the primary outcome or in most of the second-
ary outcomes, although a significant difference 
in mortality at 90 days after surgery that favored 
liberal transfusion was observed (4.2% vs. 2.6%, 
P 
= 
0.045).9 Because the number of patients en-
rolled in the TRICS III trial was more than double 
that in the TITRe2 trial, with a duration of fol-

The solid gray vertical line indicates the overall treatment estimate for the primary outcome in the primary‑analysis cohort (per‑protocol 
population), and the dashed lines the 95% confidence interval. The size of the circles is proportional to the statistical precision of the 
estimates. An arrow indicates that the 95% confidence interval is outside the range shown. Chronic pulmonary disease was defined as 
the long‑term use of bronchodilators or glucocorticoids for lung disease. Left ventricular function was defined according to the following 
categories: good (left ventricular ejection fraction, ≥51%), moderately reduced (31 to 50%), poor (21 to 30%), and very poor (≤20%).

Six-Month Outcomes of Restrictive or Liberal Transfusion
low-up that was twice as long, the findings pro-
vide new information about the long-term out-
comes of perioperative transfusion strategies.
The rate of hospital readmission after cardiac 
surgery was consistent with the rates in other 
studies.26,27 Predictors of hospital readmission 
have included age, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, lower socioeconomic status, prolonged 
length of hospital stay, postoperative infection, 
postoperative renal failure, and left ventricular 
dysfunction.27-29 The role of anemia in hospital 
readmission is unclear. Although a small study 
identified an association between a hematocrit 
of less than 30% at discharge and hospital read-
mission within 30 days,30 we and others have 
reported previously that neither red-cell transfu-
sion during the index hospitalization nor the last 
hemoglobin concentration measured before hos-
pital discharge were associated with hospital re-
admission for any cause, readmission due to car-
diac causes, or death after discharge.27,31,32
A significant interaction between transfusion 
threshold and age was found in our previous study 
of the 28-day outcomes, in which the restrictive 
transfusion strategy was associated with a lower 
risk of the composite outcome than the liberal 
strategy among patients 75 years of age or older 
but not among younger patients.1 At 6 months, the 
interaction between age and transfusion threshold 
became qualitative, with a divergent effect of the 
restrictive strategy according to age; in patients 
75 years or older, the restrictive strategy appeared 
to be superior to the liberal strategy, whereas in 
patients younger than 75 years, the liberal strat-
egy was associated with a lower risk of the com-
posite outcome than the restrictive strategy. The 
interaction was robust in a series of sensitivity 
analyses according to decades of age, with age 
as a continuous variable, with restricted cubic 
splines, and after adjustment for all the variables 
used to define subgroups. The findings in patients 
75 years of age or older appear to contradict the 
current practice, in which a liberal transfusion 
strategy is used in older patients undergoing 
cardiac or noncardiac surgery who thus receive 
more red cell transfusions than do younger pa-
tients.33,34 One could hypothesize that older 
patients may have unacceptable adverse effects 
related to transfusion (e.g., volume overload and 
inflammatory and infectious complications) or 
that there may be age-related differences in the 
adverse-effect profile of transfusion or anemia. 
Although not significant, the direction of this 
finding was also present in the TITRe2 trial.9 
The mechanisms underlying any potential differ-
ential effect of age on outcomes of transfusion 
must be further studied within the cardiac sur-
gery population. Our findings suggest the value 
of incorporating long-term follow-up into stud-
ies of perioperative transfusion. Whether trans-
fusion thresholds should differ according to 
age also needs to be determined in other popu-
lations at risk for anemia requiring transfusion.
This analysis has some limitations. First, we 
did not require physicians to follow the transfu-
sion protocol after day 28 or hospital discharge 
and are unable to determine the degree to which 
the differences in hemoglobin concentrations or 
transfusions continued thereafter. Second, out-
come data were obtained from a variety of sources, 
including telephone contact, hospital records, 
and database registries. It is possible that some 
follow-up visits were missed, although there is no 
reason to believe that missed visits would be more 
frequent in one treatment group than in the 
other. In addition, determination of cause of death 
was not possible. Primary outcome data were 
available for 96% of the patients; much of the 
missing data were for patients in the pilot study, 
in which long-term follow-up was not specified in 
the study design. Although the possibility of bias 
in an open-label trial cannot be ruled out, the 
findings from the various sensitivity analyses 
were consistent with those of the primary analy-
sis and suggest that the results of our trial are 
robust.
In conclusion, we performed a large, multi-
center, randomized trial comparing a restrictive 
red-cell transfusion strategy with a liberal strat-
egy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who 
had a moderate-to-high risk of death. Overall, the 
restrictive strategy was noninferior to the liberal 
strategy with respect to death from any cause, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, and new-onset re-
nal failure with dialysis at 6 months after surgery.
