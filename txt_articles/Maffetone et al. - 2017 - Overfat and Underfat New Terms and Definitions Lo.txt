For the first time in human history, the number of obese people worldwide now exceeds 
those who are underweight. However, it is possible that there is an even more serious 
problem—an overfat pandemic comprised of people who exhibit metabolic health 
impairments associated with excess fat mass relative to lean body mass. Many overfat 
individuals, however, are not necessarily classified clinically as overweight or obese, 
despite the common use of body mass index as the clinical classifier of obesity and 
overweight. The well-documented obesity epidemic may merely be the tip of the overfat 
iceberg. The counterpart to the overfat condition is the underfat state, also a common 
and dangerous health circumstance associated with chronic illness and starvation. 
Currently (and paradoxically), high rates of obesity and overweight development coexist 
with undernutrition in developing countries. Studies in cognitive linguistics suggest that 
accurate, useful, and unintimidating terminology regarding abnormal body fat condi-
tions could help increase a person’s awareness of their situation, helping the process 
of implementing prevention and simple remedies. Our contention is that promoting the 
terms “overfat” and “underfat” to describe body composition states to the point where 
they enter into common usage may help in creating substantive improvements in world 
health.

introdUCtion
Obesity, together with the overweight condition, continues to be a serious global epidemic that 
significantly affects population health and economy (1). Obesity affects people of all ages and 
incomes throughout the world. In the last three decades, no country has reduced obesity rates, 
which are expected to continue increasing as incomes rise in low- and middle-income countries in 
particular (2). Most of these statistics have been derived using the most frequently used proxy for 
body composition estimate, the body mass index (BMI).
The estimation of body fat composition has been studied in various populations around the world. 
The accuracy of these statistics may be partly skewed by the variety of different indirect methods of 
body composition assessment (3–5). However, most of these studies showed average body fat per-
centages above healthy recommended levels reported by Bray (6), which, for example, are 21–32% 
for 21- to 39-year-old normal-weight women and 8–20% for men of the same age and BMI category.
It is well documented that serious limitations exist when estimating body composition using BMI, 
due to the fact that it underestimates adiposity (body fat percentage) levels in the population at large 
(7–10). Different ethnic and gender cutoffs for BMI also exist (11). The morbidity and downstream 
diseases associated with obesity—metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease (12, 13), and in fact

most non-infectious chronic diseases (14)—are pathophysiologi-
cal consequences of excess adiposity.
The metabolic underpinnings of excess adiposity (15), as well 
as its many adverse consequences (16), have been documented 
to lead to states of chronic illness later in life (12, 13). These 
states are often characterized by loss of lean muscle mass (sar-
copenia) and loss of both lean and fat mass (FM) (cachexia) 
(17–20). Sarcopenia is another serious global condition (17–20), 
and cachexia is now considered a public health crisis (20), whose 
incidence may be underestimated (21). In light of the prob-
able underestimation of overfat individuals, this health crisis 
becomes compounded: this has created a population of overfat 
individuals whose health needs may be unmet and overlooked. 
Combined, this exacerbates future rates of chronically ill, sar-
copenic and cachexic individuals—another health crisis in its 
own right.
The widespread, institutionalized underestimation of 
adiposity levels, caused by the blanket adoption of BMI 
as the main indicator of obesity, poses serious challenges 
to the accurate diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of 
obesity-related diseases (8). We argue that new methods and 
associated terms are needed to more appropriately identify a 
person’s adiposity.
More appropriate terms could help all those in public health 
and those using health services. Adopting new terminology has 
been argued on the grounds that more descriptive terminology 
has a downstream positive effect on the systems and practices 
that surround the phenomenon (22, 23). It is well established 
that, in addition to health practitioners, health consumer/patient 
opinions should be considered in the design, delivery, and evalu-
ation of health services, with consumer expectations as one of 
the criteria used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
evaluate health system performance (24, 25). As one example Sav 
et al. (24) use the term consumer instead of patient, believing that 
the latter term can be disempowering.
Herein, we define new overfat and underfat conditions, esti-
mate their worldwide frequencies, and argue for the importance 
of implementing these terms into popular and scientific literature. 
Our contention is that promoting the terms overfat and underfat 
to the point where they enter into common usage may help in 
creating substantive improvements in world health.
CLiniCaL MarKers oF Body 
CoMposition
The present standard for gaining an estimate of body composi-
tion in the clinical setting is through measurement of the BMI; 
an individual’s weight in kilogram divided by their height in 
square meter. Different standardized cutoff points indicate the 
clinical diagnoses of being underweight, of normal weight, over-
weight, or obese, according to the following demarcation points 
 
(in kilograms per square meter) (9, 26):
• <18.5 = underweight
• 18.5–24.9 = normal weight
• 25–29.9 = overweight (pre-obese)
• >30 = obese.
While BMI is a reasonable general indicator of body fat (made 
up mostly of triacylglycerols) and WHO defines overweight and 
obese as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation for both adults 
and children (26), it does not measure body fat directly. The US 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against 
using BMI as a diagnostic tool (27) and instead recommends that 
it can be used as a measure to track weight status in populations 
and as a screening tool to identify potential weight problems in 
individuals. Indeed, high BMI levels are associated with future 
health risks, including the prediction of morbidity and death (27).
According to the most comprehensive BMI trend analysis to 
date, global obesity numbers have risen dramatically, from 105 
million adults in 1975 to 641 million in 2014. Worldwide, the 
age-corrected proportion of men who were obese climbed from 
3.2 to 10.8% in that time and the rate among women more than 
doubled, from 6.4 to 14.9%. During the same 40-year period, the 
proportion of men who were underweight globally fell from 13.8 
to 8.8% and among women declined from 14.6 to 9.7% (1, 28). 
Obese and overweight children also make up a rapidly increasing 
population, with Lobstein et al. (29) estimating ~12% of children 
worldwide aged 5–17 years being affected with annual increases 
of 1%. Prevalence of obesity alone in US children aged 2–19 years 
is estimated at 17% (30).
Importantly, however, these statistics do not always include 
the population that is overweight. When the incidence of being 
overweight is included within obesity statistics, rates of excess 
weight have been shown to be dramatically greater. Indeed, the 
WHO has reported that, as a group, the obese and overweight 
adult population is now approaching 40% of the world’s popula-
tion (26), with rates in the US now at ~66% (31).
proBLeMs WitH BMi as a MeasUre oF 
oBesity
The fundamental problem with using the measurement of one’s 
height and weight to indirectly ascertain an individual’s body 
composition is that high percent body fat values are often associ-
ated with lower BMI categories (8). In addition, a person’s body 
weight is in itself unlikely to be a primary contributor to the 
negative health effects that are associated with obesity. Obesity 
of course is now accepted as merely a sign of a metabolic phe-
nomenon associated with unhealthy changes in levels of body fat 
(15, 32).
The limitations associated with using BMI clinically have 
been well documented. As one example, Tomiyama et al. (9) 
showed that 30% of individuals classified as being healthy based 
on their BMI scores were in fact metabolically unhealthy based 
on clinical evaluations. In another study, nearly 50% of men 
and women classified as obese using densitometric methods 
were determined to be of normal BMI (33). Athletes who build 
high levels of muscle (lean body) mass often possess BMI levels 
above 30 and would be inappropriately classified as obese (34). 
However, when they retire, many will increase their body fat 
levels substantially, while maintaining their high BMI. A study 
of 926 retired NFL players whose mean BMI was 30 and mean 
waist circumference was 40 showed that 61% were at risk for

atherosclerosis; the most at risk being those with larger waist 
circumference (10). A number of other studies have reported 
various discrepancies between BMI and the accumulation of 
body fat in various other populations (10, 35–37). Clearly, BMI 
has limited relevance for assessing accurate markers of body 
composition and body fat distribution, which are important 
signs of metabolic health (1).

issUes?
The WHO is currently undertaking a review and assessment of 
available data on the relationship between waist circumference, 
morbidity, health risk, and the interaction with BMI measure-
ments (38). Waist circumference, more than BMI, has a very 
strong association with health risk (12) and is part of a series 
of practical tools that have greater assessment value than BMI, 
including blood pressure, triglyceride, glucose, insulin resistance, 
and C-reactive protein (9, 37). These tests could appropriately 
replace BMI in both a clinical and, in the case of waist circumfer-
ence, in the home environment to help measure and monitor body 
fat as a way to improve health and reduce the risk of mortality 
 
(37, 39). In view of tests such as waist circumference, it is striking 
that the most prolific measure used to ascertain a body composi-
tion level that is likely to be not healthy is BMI (40), a measure-
ment that does not distinguish between adipose tissue and other 
tissues of the body.
Waist circumference has increased significantly in both 
children and adults worldwide over the past 20–25 years (41). 
Some of these increases are greater than what would be expected 
based on changes in BMI (42). As another example, a Canadian 
government health survey evaluated 6,306 healthy people aged 
6–79 years between 2009 and 2011 using waist circumference 
(43) and showed that up to 50% of men, 70% of women, 20% of 
boys, and 41% of girls had increased or high health risk based on 
National Institutes of Health measurement guidelines (44).
tHe terMinoLoGy oF oBesity and 
its iMpLiCations
A contributing condition to this unfortunate reality may be the 
fact that current terminology used to describe the state of being 
overfat and its related metabolic conditions centers on weight, not 
fat. As Baumgartner et al. (45) write: “There are very few reports 
of associations between more exact measures of body fatness, 
such as percent body fat (%BF) or FM, and chronic disease risk.” 
For this reason, various authors (46–48) have argued that defini-
tions of obesity based on height and weight be modified.
Conflation of “Weight” and “Fat”
Compounding the problem further is that researchers and 
health-care practitioners have been known to treat terms relating 
to weight the same as those that relate to fat. Two examples of this 
are shown in recent reports appearing in popular online websites. 
Both sources reported on a new study published in JAMA Internal 
Medicine showing that in monozygous twins, higher BMI was 
not associated with increased risk of heart attack, but was associ-
ated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (49). The American 
Heart Association News quoted the study’s lead researcher Peter 
Nordstrom as saying, “The fatter twin actually had a lower risk 
of myocardial infarction or death, although risk of diabetes was 
higher” (50). The published study (49) does not address body 
fat, but uses the words “heavier,” “leaner,” “fatter,” and “obese” 
interchangeably throughout. Another article about this study 
from http://ScienceDaily.com stated that “all twins in the study 
had different levels of body fat” (51), when of course, body fat 
was not assessed.
social Factors affecting the Use of 
terminology
While the perception of healthy body size and composition 
differs worldwide, within ethnic groups, cultures, and even 
the health-care community (20), many of the terms that sur-
round obesity (such as “fat” and “obese”) are often viewed as 
personal insult (52, 53). In a study on perceptions of obesity 
terminology in childhood, it was found that doctors’ use of 
terms related to weight (“unhealthy weight,” “weight problem,” 
 
and “weight loss”) was seen as far more desirable by parents 
than those related to “fat” or “obesity,” which were viewed more 
negatively (54). Interestingly, however, Puhl et al. (54) ranked 
this terminology with respect to parents’ perceptions of the level 
that each term would motivate their children to lose weight 
and found an inverse correlation between perceived stigma and 
motivation. That is, the most stigmatizing terms were viewed 
as the least motivating, whereas the least stigmatizing terms 
were the most motivating (54). However, Tailor and Ogden (55) 
found that healthy subjects were more likely to be offended by 
doctors’ use of the term obese, whereas obese patients found 
euphemisms more upsetting. Thus, healthy and obese patients 
appear to have the opposite response to the same terminology. 
In fact, Tailor and Ogden (55) speculate that the meaningfulness 
of the term “obesity,” what healthy subjects might refer to as a 
“stigma” may itself help drive obese patients’ desire to improve 
their health status.
The perception that the most stigmatizing terminology 
may be the least motivating may be just that: a perception. 
While such studies may be germane to interactions between 
patient and doctor, there are undoubtedly many social arenas 
 
(e.g., the playground) where the terms found most stigmatizing 
by Puhl et al. (54) are wielded to the disadvantage of overfat 
individuals. Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that 
the “weight”-based terminology used to describe the overfat 
phenomenon gained prevalence over “fat”-based terms precisely 
due to its euphemistic function. Unfortunately, the euphemistic 
conflation of “fat” and “weight” may have caused the reality of 
these metabolic issues to be obscured from health-care profes-
sionals and the general public, making it more difficult to create 
lasting positive changes in the public health sector.

Overfat and Underfat

tHe MetaBoLiC pHenoMenon
The body’s adipose tissue plays an important role in endocrine 
function, as well as various other systems in the body. The hor-
monal role of adiposity is so influential that some authors suggest 
adipose tissue be understood as an endocrine organ (56–58). It is 
precisely the endocrine dysfunction associated with high body fat 
that can lead to the pathophysiology of obesity, as well as illnesses 
with an underweight component such as cachexia. The metabolic 
phenomena that open the door to excessive accumulation of fat 
(in the case of obesity) or an unhealthy loss of fat (in the case of 
being underweight) are causes of the negative signs and symp-
toms associated with each of these two conditions.
High levels of body fat are associated with low-grade chronic 
inflammation (59). In turn, such inflammation is associated 
with various downstream diseases, including type 2 diabetes 
(60, 61), heart disease (16), cancer (62), stroke (63), Alzheimer’s 
(64), and others (65, 66). These health epidemics are currently 
having devastating effects on the world economy. In 2014 for 
example, skyrocketing health-care costs climbed to $3 trillion 
in the US alone (67). Worldwide, chronic diseases are estimated 
to be responsible for a $17.3 trillion cumulative economic loss 
between 2011 and 2030 due to health-care expenditures, reduced 
productivity, and lost capital (68).
Conversely, weight itself may play only a tangential role in both 
the pathophysiology and the symptomatology of obesity, as well 
as conditions associated with being underweight. While excess 
weight can directly and adversely affect the musculoskeletal 
system, there is little indication that excess weight, when not pro-
duced by a relative or absolute increase in FM, a relative or absolute 
decrease in lean mass, or a combination of both, is causally related 
to the metabolic underpinnings of obesity. Studies on the risk for 
cardiovascular disease in Football Players—a high-BMI popula-
tion with large percentages of lean mass—caution that reliance on 
BMI as a sole determinant of disease risk may be inappropriate 
(10, 69). This and various other populations may be contributing 
to the percentage of false-positives observed through the use of 
BMI to ascertain metabolic disease risk (33). In simpler terms, 
we can say that weight relates to obesity and being underweight, 
primarily with respect to the fact that more fat typically (but not 
always) means more weight, and less fat (typically but not always) 
means less weight. These problems create confusion for doctors 
and patients alike and may often play a significant role in reducing 
quality of life and lifespan in all populations (70).
A critical factor associated with the health of underweight 
individuals is the loss of fatty tissue and its endocrine and meta-
bolic functions (45, 58). In conditions of malnutrition, such as 
cancer cachexia and anorexia, there may be significant alterations 
in the production of many proteins, such as leptin, secreted from 
adipocytes with important metabolic and regulatory implications 
(45). Due to the importance of fatty tissue on health outcomes 
of underweight people, we argue that the phenomenon of being 
underweight may, to a large degree, relate to being underfat, a 
condition that may coexist with the loss of lean body mass. Indeed, 
cachexia, a condition characterized by severe body weight, fat, 
and muscle loss as a result of chronic illness occurs in about 80% 
of all cancer patients (21) and is frequent in patients with chronic 
heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic 
kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, Crohn’s disease, 
rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, neurological degenerative diseases, 
and other chronic illness (20).
Sarcopenia is defined as the progressive loss of type II fast-
twitch muscle fibers and strength with aging and is a key public 
health problem, with the prevalence in the elderly as high as 50% 
(71). In addition to muscle atrophy, there is an accumulation 
of fat within existing muscle (72). The combination of higher 
body fat and sarcopenia has been termed sarcopenic obesity and 
is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin 
resistance, among other conditions (73). Sarcopenia increases the 
risk of disability and poor quality of life and death and may be an 
important association with chronic illness. Many who become 
underfat due to chronic illness may in fact owe their underfat 
status to a previously developed overfat metabolism associated 
with chronic inflammation and disease, as illustrated in Figure 1. 
This same metabolic status could lead to cachexia and other forms 
of unhealthy fat loss later in life (74).
In summary, cachexia and sarcopenia, which are partly defined 
by loss of muscle mass (72), may occur in part due to unhealthy 
changes in fatty tissue. The metabolic markers associated with 
excess fat, such as systemic inflammation, elevated C-reactive 
protein, and excessive oxidative stress, drive both sarcopenic 
obesity and cachexia (72, 75). In particular, an imbalance 
between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may play a key 
role in the pathogenesis of cachexia (72). Indeed, improvements 
in fat metabolism through the administration of fatty acids can 
eliminate in large part the signs and symptoms of sarcopenia 
and cachexia. For example, eicosapentaenoic fatty acid has been 
successfully used to stabilize weight in late-stage cancer patients 
(76) and may function due to its primary effects of reducing 
inflammation, C-reactive protein, and oxidative stress.
neW terMs
In view of the above, we propose that the terms overfat and 
underfat become common for three main reasons:
 
1. Measuring adipose tissue tends to better predict risk for the 
symptomatology of being overfat than measuring weight.
 
2. The symptomatology of being overfat is also found in popula-
tions who do not fit the weight-based criteria of obesity, while 
weight-based measures such as BMI can underestimate the 
incidence of being overfat and lead to misdiagnosis.
 
3. Being “underweight” is also importantly a problem. Any of 
the main health concerns in an underweight population may 
stem from endocrine dysregulation due to the loss of fatty 
tissue secondary to chronic illness or starvation, including 
disordered eating and excess exercise (discussed below).
The term overfat accurately specifies the precise problem of 
excess body fat and impaired fat metabolism that directly influ-
ences health and fitness. It also eliminates common terms that are 
not accurate, including being overweight (not a measurement of 
fat) and obese, which references individuals being above a certain 
BMI (9, 26).

WHo is “oVerFat”?
While some data are available [reviewed by St-Onge (8)], one 
problem with estimating the number of overfat people worldwide 
is the lack of sufficient body fat data associated with the inad-
equate definitions used to estimate it more accurately. However, 
extrapolations might be made from other existing data. The 
notion of a worldwide overfat pandemic that well exceeds that 
of obesity- and overweight-defined conditions may be based on 
the facts regarding a variety of different and existing unhealthy 
states, which include:
 
1. Adults who are overweight and obese. The WHO has reported 
that in 2014, 39% of the world’s population was overweight, 
with 13% being obese (26, 77).
 
2. Those who are metabolically obese, normal weight (MONW) 
individuals (9, 48, 78) and could include up to 40% of normal-
weight individuals. We estimate that the percentage of MONW 
individuals in the overall population is 20% (2).
 
3. Individuals with sufficient excess body fat stores to substan-
tially impair health (46) but who are not part of the above 
categories, and are sometimes labeled as “normal weight 
obesity” (79). Included are people with deposition of excess fat 
in organs such as the liver, heart, and muscles that can occur 
with aging (80).
 
4. Individuals with sarcopenic obesity (73).
 
5. Those with increased abdominal fat stores who may not fit 
the first two categories, as many are not overweight or have 
high BMIs. Abdominal fat stores are more metabolically 
active and have a greater impact on health, regardless of the 
person’s weight (10, 48, 81, 82). Ruderman et al. (48) suggest 
that many MONW individuals are included in this category. 
This has been taken into account in our Figure 2 overfat 
estimate.
 
6. As of 2014, 17–22% of children. Indeed, in 2004, Lobstein 
et al. (29) estimated the incidence of being overweight and 
obese worldwide for children over age 5 at 12%, with an 
annual increase of 1%. The WHO estimates overweight chil-
dren under age 5 (2013) to be 6.3%, and that this figure could 
be 11% by 2025 (77).
If we consider that the percentage of individuals who are either 
overweight or obese or MONW (categories 1 and 2) is under-
estimated, the combined number makes up a shockingly large 
amount of the population (Figure 2). While substantially fewer 
individuals fit into categories 3, 4, and 5, and we have found no 
data available to estimate these numbers, such frightening statis-
tics suggest that an unrecognized high percentage of the world 
population is overfat enough for their health to be negatively 
impacted.
An important reason for estimating the number of overfat 
people in the world is that they may represent a common source 
of chronic disease. This estimation, however, is particularly dif-
ficult for a number of reasons. First, appropriate studies that have 
accurately measured body fat in both adults and children are 
lacking. Second, using data only for previously categorized obese 
and overweight individuals may significantly underestimate the 
number of overfat individuals. Third, data available for obese 
and overfat children often use different age ranges, making total 
estimates of overfat children difficult. Finally, adults and children 
who have not been classified as obese or overweight can still be 
overfat.
Figure 2 (below) portrays how alarming the overfat pandemic 
may be when compared to the numbers and percentages of over-
weight and obese people in the world based on best estimates 
from the available data (1, 2, 29, 77, 83–87).
WHo is UnderFat?
There are two main categories of people at risk for being underfat, 
in addition to those who have malnutrition due to starvation:
 
1. Individuals with chronic illness, especially with cachexia: 
cachexia increases mortality in those with chronic disease 
and is present in 30% of patients who die, making it one of the 
major contributors to death worldwide (20). Of the estimated 
57 million global deaths in 2008, 36 million (63%) were due 
to chronic diseases (84).
 
2. Those with eating disorders: 70 million people world-
wide, including those who exercise excessively (anorexia 
athletica) (85).
While present percentages of starvation-related underfat 
people are diminishing, it is still a serious disorder in developing 
nations. During the dramatic rise in obesity over the last four 
decades, the proportion of underweight adults globally fell from 
about 14% to about 9% (2). But as the world becomes more 
westernized, chronically ill people will stay alive longer through 
medical interventions. In 2010, an estimated 524 million people 
were aged 65 and older, making up 8% of the world’s population.

By 2050, this number may triple to 1.5 billion, making up 
about 16% of the world population (88). When we include the 
increasing population of those with eating disorders, including 
anorexia athletica, we may see future increases in the underfat 
population, despite reductions of those who are underfat due to 
starvation. Effectively, this may create a shrinking population of 
healthy people. The effects of normal aging may compound this 
situation further. Changes in body composition, resulting from 
a shift across the overfat conditions toward one of decreased 
muscle mass in combination with maintained or increased FM 
(89), may increase rates of sarcopenic obesity, described as the 
combination of increased body fat in conjunction with reduced 
muscle mass (66, 72).
Cachexia is leading to a growing number of underfat people 
due to increasing rates of chronic disease. Furthermore, the com-
bined increasing global aging population and worldwide west-
ernization further escalates the numbers of underfat people due 
to non-malnutrition (cachexia and eating disorders). The finding 
that approximately 30% of those who die from chronic disease 
have cachexia (20), combined with the statistic that worldwide 
death rates from chronic disease in 2008 totaled 36 million, sug-
gests that nearly 11 million people who died from chronic disease 
in 2008 also had cachexia. As mortality from chronic diseases rise 
(from 60% of all deaths in 2001 to 63% in 2008 to an extrapolated 
71% by 2020) (83, 90), in combination with the ballooning elderly 
population (88), leads us to extrapolate that the figure of 11 million 
 
deaths of people with cachexia will increase dramatically 
(Figure 3).

It is not the case that measures of illness (such as BMI) fail or succeed 
only in terms of how accurately they measure the illness in question. 
The view that they do overlooks the fact that in addition to being 
a health phenomenon, public health is a public (that is, a social) 
phenomenon. In this section, we present evidence that whether or 
not the tropes, ideas, and concepts surrounding a particular public 
health phenomenon are in fact emblematic of the physiological 
underpinnings of the actual problem—whether the public mistakes 
a fat-based phenomenon for a weight-based one—can indirectly 
drive the success (or failure) of public health initiatives.
The title of the article Are Normal-weight Americans Over-Fat? 
elucidates the extent of the problem (8). In previous sections, we 
discussed how the relevance of weight to the bulk of metabolic 
diseases is contingent on fat, and limited to those situations where 
excess (or a lack of) fat has created excess weight (or a lack thereof). 
 
We have found no evidence supporting the notion that when 
a “normal weight” individual is overfat, consideration of their 
weight status provides additional information relevant to the 
determination of their metabolic disease risk. In these cases, the 
“normal” status of this weight statistic draws attention away from 
the fact that this person’s relevant metabolic metrics indicate that 
they are in fact at increased risk of disease. We argue that the 
notion and mention of an overfat individual’s “normal weight” 
status provides an unfortunate barrier to the understanding 
that they are at increased risk of disease, which may dampen 
the motivation to improve health status, as well as confound the

relevance of the strategies used to improve health. Due to the 
increasing frequency of “normal-weight but overfat” individuals 
in the world population, we believe that terms relating to, refer-
ring to, and including “weight” are effectively functioning as a 
red herring, obscuring the problem (and its possible solutions).
An online University of Houston document states that, “The 
terms overfat and underfat are very useful because they describe 
how much of your total body weight is made up of fat. Underfat 
means having too little body fat; overfat means having too much 
body fat. Obesity is a term used to describe people who are very 
overfat” (91). Introducing the terms overfat and underfat into the 
medical lexicon as well as common parlance could have a variety 
of benefits that include:
 
1. Describing these serious health issues with terminology that 
centers and obviates the main issue: unhealthy surpluses and 
lack of fatty tissue.
 
2. Clear and transparent terminology helps patients, health 
practitioners, and the public make better health decisions and 
set better health goals.
 
3. Using the term “overfat” may help mitigate the problems 
associated with those who do not perceive themselves to be at 
health risk due to having normal BMI (Figure 4).
Studies on semantic priming show that the word-form, or 
surface-shape, of a particular term (say “overweight”) deeply 
influences our cognition (92) and drives our attention toward 
other words, images, and even goals (93), which are semantically 
related to that word-form (94). While dictionary definitions of 
being “overweight” often include its cause as excess fat, the shape 
of the word-form directs attention toward weight and away from 
fat. This may make it more likely for individuals to think that 
weight loss generally, rather than fat loss specifically, will lead to 
better health.
The view that weight is the primary indicator of health is wide-
spread in the public consciousness. The bathroom scale (which 
measures weight) is the cultural icon of leanness, fitness, and 
health. For comparison, the skinfold caliper and other devices 
(that measure fat) are far less used. Other associations that relate 
to fat—such as the measurement of waist circumference—are also 
overshadowed by our familiarity with the bathroom scale. That 
the prevalence of overweight terminology would co-occur with 
the cultural dominance of the bathroom scale should come as little 
surprise. Indeed, the frequency with which we encounter termi-
nology associated with a particular topic or concept increases our 
ability to recognize it, which in turn drives decision-making (95). 
 
Moreover, terminology does not only prime attention. It can 
also influence decision-making and goal setting without our 
conscious awareness (93). In fact, it has been suggested that the 
primary function of attention is to influence our decision-making 
processes, known as Goal Contagion (96).
In light of this, we believe that promoting the term overfat to 
the point where it becomes more common than the term over-
weight (and other health-related terms that refer to weight) will 
promote greater public understanding that the obesity epidemic 
is the tip of an overfat iceberg. In turn, the problems associated 
with being overfat and underfat will be more easily addressed

by health-care professionals, public health officials, and the lay 
public alike.
ConCLUsion
Given the many associations between weight, obesity, and poor 
health in scientific corpora (and the fact that associations with 
fat are fewer), better terminology is needed to describe the phe-
nomena associated with inappropriate body compositions more 
accurately, so that people exposed to the term “overfat” versus 
“overweight” may make improved choices and set better goals 
because the term more accurately encapsulates the problem itself. 
To improve accuracy, end confusion, and encourage healthier 
lifestyles that reduce excess body fat, while helping prevent 
chronic illness, it is proposed that both the scientific and clinical 
community and the general population, especially the media who 
encourage the use of specific terms, simplify these two very com-
mon states of unhealthiness with simple, straightforward terms, 
replacing others that are frequently not accurate, sometimes 
wrong, and often confusing. We propose that promoting the 
terms “overfat” and “underfat” to the point where they enter into 
common usage may help in creating substantive improvements 
in world health.
