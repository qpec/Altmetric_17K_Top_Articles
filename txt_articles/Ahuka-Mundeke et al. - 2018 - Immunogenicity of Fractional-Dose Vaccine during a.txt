KEY UPDATES 
 Angola epidemiological update (as of 20 October): 
o The last confirmed case had symptom onset on 23 June. 
o  Two new probable cases without a history of yellow fever vaccination were 
reported from Kwanza Sul province in the last week. 
o Phase two of the vaccination campaign is ongoing, targeting more than two million 
people in 10 provinces.  
 Democratic Republic of the Congo epidemiological update (as of 26 October): 
o The last confirmed non-sylvatic case had symptom onset on 12 July. 
o A new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in Sud 
Ubangui province.  
o Fourteen probable cases remain under investigation.  
o The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province, which began on 
20 October, is ongoing.  
ANALYSIS 
 The majority of the probable cases in Angola have been ruled out as yellow fever cases 
by the Institut Pasteur of Dakar. They will remain classified as probable cases until a full 
battery of tests has been run to determine other possible causes of illness. Once the final 
results are received the cases will be reclassified. Coincidentally, a previously scheduled 
pre-emptive vaccination campaign is ongoing in Kwanza Sul province where two new 
probable cases were reported. 
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION 
Angola 
 Two new probable cases without a history of yellow fever vaccination were reported 
from Kwanza Sul province in the last week.  
 Of the forty-five probable cases that were reported in the four weeks to 13 October: 31 
have been discarded, two are undergoing further testing and 12 await classification by 
the committee (Fig. 1). 
 From 5 December 2015 to 20 October 2016 (Table 1): 
o 4347 suspected cases, with 377 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 8.7%); 
o 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR: 13.7%).

Democratic Republic of the Congo  
 From 1 January to 26 October 2016 (Fig. 2, Table 1): 
o 2987 notified cases reported from all 26 provinces; 
o 78 confirmed cases have been identified from 2800 suspected cases that have been 
laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21%); 
o Of the 78 confirmed cases, reported from eight provinces (Fig. 4), 57 acquired 
infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous1, and eight are cases of sylvatic2 
transmission (not related to the outbreak).  
 One new confirmed, sylvatic case was reported from Bominenge Health Zone in 
Sud Ubangui province. This was one of the sixteen probable cases that were 
reported under investigation last week. This new sylvatic case reportedly had 
symptom onset on 17 August. 
 Fourteen probable cases remain under investigation (three in Kinshasa, eight in Kwango 
and one case each in Bas Uele, Kwilu, and Lualaba provinces). In addition to the case in 
Sud Ubangui that was under investigation and is now classified as a new sylvatic case, 
one case in Kinshasa was ruled out due to previous yellow fever vaccination history.

RESPONSE 
 
 Information on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website3.  
 In Angola, phase two of the vaccination campaign targeting more than two million people 
in 12 districts in 10 provinces is ongoing.    
 In Democratic Republic of the Congo, the reactive vaccination campaign in Feshi Health 
Zone in Kwango province ended after 152 492 people were vaccinated among a target of 
146 449 (104.1%). The reactive campaign in Mushenge Health Zone in Kasai province 
which began on 20 October is ongoing. Monitoring continues in the 62 Health Zones 
where the pre-emptive vaccination campaigns were conducted in August.  
 WHO has sent more than 30 million vaccine doses to Angola, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and Uganda since the beginning of the outbreak through the International 
Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile, with additional vaccine doses from the 
manufacturer Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.  
 As of 25 October 2016, 20 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 
million doses for Democratic Republic of the Congo (Table 3). 
 The number of vaccine doses currently available in the ICG global stockpile for emergency 
response is 6.9 million (Table 4). The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the 
outbreak is not included in this number.
