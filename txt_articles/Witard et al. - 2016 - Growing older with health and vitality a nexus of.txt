Abstract
The preservation of skeletal muscle mass
and strength with advancing age are, we propose, critical
aspects of ageing with health and vitality. Physical
inactivity and poor nutrition are known to accelerate the
gradual
age-related decline in
muscle mass and
strength—sarcopenia—however, both are subject to
modification. The main purpose of this review is to
present the latest, evidence-based recommendations for
physical activity and exercise, as well as diet for older
adults that would help in preserving muscle mass and
strength. We take the position that future physical
activity/exercise guidelines need to make specific refer-
ence to resistance exercise and highlight the benefits of
higher-intensity aerobic exercise training, alongside
advocating older adults perform aerobic-based physical
activity and household tasks (e.g., carrying groceries). In
terms of dietary recommendations, greater emphasis
should be placed on optimal rather than minimum protein
intakes for older adults. Indeed, guidelines that endorse a
daily protein intake of 1.2–1.5 g/kg BM/day, which are
levels 50–90 % greater than the current protein Recom-
mendation Dietary Allowance (0.8 g/kg BM/day), are
likely to help preserve muscle mass and strength and are
safe for healthy older adults. Being cognisant of factors
(e.g., reduced appetite) that may preclude older adults
from increasing their total daily protein intake, we echo
the viewpoint of other active researchers in advocating
that protein recommendations for older adults be based
on a per meal approach in order to maximize muscle
protein synthesis (MPS). On this basis, assuming three
meals are consumed daily, a protein dose of 0.4–0.5 g/kg
BM should be contained in each meal. We are beginning
to understand ways in which to increase the utilization of
ingested protein for the stimulation of MPS, namely by
increasing the proportion of leucine contained in a given
dose of protein, co-ingesting other nutrients (e.g.,
carbohydrate and fat or supplementation with n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids) or being physically active
prior to protein intake. Clearly, developing simple
lifestyle interventions targeted at preserving muscle mass
and strength with advancing age is crucial for facilitating
longer, healthier lives into older age.

65 years increased from 12 % in 1985 to 17 % in
2010 (Office for National Statistics 2012). With the
rate of avoidable mortality among people aged 60?
years old continuing to fall (Mathers et al. 2015), by
2035 *25 % of Europe’s total population is projected
to be [
65 years old (Office for National Statistics.
2012). Fundamentally, this ageing demographic is
testament to continued improvements in healthcare
services. However, a disproportionate use of health-
care services by older people highlights the economic
cost of population ageing, alongside the high preva-
lence of morbidity that can reduce quality of life with
advancing age. As a consequence, there is a perception
that society (in some European countries more than
others) often views older people as a societal and
economic burden. An opposing viewpoint is the socio-
economic implications of human longevity are often
misrepresented (Lloyd-Sherlock et al. 2012). The
position of the present review is that advancing age
does not necessarily have to be synonymous with poor
health. Instead, older people remain capable of making
significant social, economic and cultural contributions
to society. Moving forward, ‘ageing well’ and a
‘healthy and independent life expectancy’ are two
concepts that are being championed as priority public
health messages by influential bodies such as the
World Health Organization. As such, there are calls to
prioritize ‘health span’, but exactly how this aim can
be achieved remains an interesting topic of research.
We view, as essential practices in ageing well, being
physically active, a structured exercise programme
and following good nutrition practice.
Sarcopenia and the threat of physical disability
Sarcopenia is a late-life multifactorial syndrome with
the potential to curtail quality of life and increase risk
for physical disability. According to the consensus
operational definition of the European Working Group
on Sarcopenia in older people (EWGSOP) (Cruz-
Jentoft et al. 2010), diagnosis of sarcopenia is
characterized operationally by a low skeletal muscle
mass, accompanied by low muscle strength and/or low
physical performance. Whilst other definitions of
sarcopenia have been proposed, all definitions have
as essential elements a reduction in muscle mass,
strength, and mobility. A gradual, but progressive,
decline in skeletal muscle size and quality is an
inevitable consequence of advancing age. The onset of
muscle mass loss typically begins by the fourth decade
of life (Janssen et al. 2000), having peaked between 20
and 30 years of age. Thereafter, the average rate of
muscle mass loss is estimated at 8 % per decade
(*0.5–1 %/year) until the age of 70 years (Mitchell
et al. 2012), increasing to *15 % per decade in
octogenarians and beyond (Delmonico et al. 2009).
Hence, most individuals 70–80 years old possess only
60–80 % of the muscle mass they had at *30 years
old, declining to\
50 % in octogenarians.
Alarmingly, compared to muscle mass loss, the
trajectory of strength loss is even more precipitous,
with annual declines of 3–4 % reported in men and
2.5–3 % in women (Goodpaster et al. 2006). The
clinical implications of sarcopenia include functional
impairments (e.g. slow walking speed, poor balance)
(Landi et al. 2012b, 2013) and, in severe cases,
physical disabilities (e.g. difficulty performing activ-
ities of daily living, increased risk of falls) (Janssen
et al. 2002), increased risk of cardiovascular and
metabolic disease (e.g. type 2 diabetes and obesity)
(Srikanthan et al. 2010) and all-cause mortality (Landi
et al. 2012a). Conceptually, cutpoints of skeletal
muscle mass index (appendicular muscle mass 7
body mass) have been identified, below which the risk
for physical disability increases in older adults
(Janssen et al. 2004). This threshold assists clinicians
in predicting the likelihood of functional impairments
and physical disabilities across different ageing sub-
populations. In the United States (no equivalent
European data are available), it is estimated that 5 %
of 65 year olds and 50 % of 80? year olds suffer from
sarcopenia (Morley 2012). Due to a lower starting
muscle mass and energy intake, prevalence estimates
are greater in women compared with men (Janssen
et al. 2002). Taken together, this body of evidence
highlights the potential detrimental impact of sarcope-
nia on functional independence and metabolic health
and emphasises the necessity to try and slow the
decline in skeletal muscle mass throughout life, but
particularly in a person’s latter years.
One important, but often overlooked, consideration
is that the cited rate of muscle mass and strength loss in
older adults does not occur in a linear fashion. In fact,
we and others (English and Paddon-Jones 2010)
theorise that the natural decline in muscle mass and
function with advancing age is punctuated by spo-
radic, but potentially inevitable bouts of muscle disuse
530

123
 (Fig. 1). These periods of disuse can result from a
variety of situations, including convalescence, pro-
longed inclement weather (e.g., extreme heat or cold
and snow), and hospitalization/bedrest due to injury or
illness. Irrespective of causality, disuse independently
results in skeletal muscle atrophy at any age (Paddon-
Jones 2006; Wall et al. 2015); thus, in older individ-
uals who experience protracted and/or frequent peri-
ods of disuse, normal age-related declines in muscle
mass and function act synergistically with muscle
disuse to accelerate the losses of muscle mass and
strength (Fig. 1). Indeed, even two-weeks of reduced
daily steps (
\
1000) has been shown to result in a
decline of bone and fat-free mass, suppress postpran-
dial rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS), and
reduce muscle function in older adults (Breen et al.
2013; Devries et al. 2015). Tackling the cause of such
events remains a great challenge in both the scientific
and built environment but, despite many years of
work, we are still unaware of the distinguishing
physiological mechanisms underpinning muscle dis-
use atrophy and sarcopenia. Whilst both sarcopenia
and muscle disuse possess many mutually exclusive
characteristics, there are some characteristics that are
consistent observations in both conditions. Although
we will review some common observations with
ageing, sarcopenia, and muscle disuse, we acknowl-
edge that a detailed discussion of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of muscle disuse atrophy and
sarcopenia are not within the scope of the present
article. Instead, we refer the interested reader to other
informative papers (Cohen et al. 2015; Phillips et al.
2009).
Aetiology of age-related muscle loss
The underlying causes of sarcopenia are multifacto-
rial, interconnected and complex. Contributing pro-
cesses include, but are not limited to: activity levels,
nutrition, chronic inflammation, DNA damage, ele-
vated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
changes in hormonal milieu (Morley 2012). Ulti-
mately however, a net muscle protein balance (NBAL)
favouring rates of muscle protein breakdown (MPB)
over MPS underpins the age-associated decline in
muscle mass. In this regard, studies have shown no
clear difference in basal postabsorptive rates of MPS
between young and older adults (Cuthbertson et al.
2005; Volpi 2001). Whilst the suppressive action of
insulin on MPB has been reported to be diminished in
older adults (Wilkes et al. 2009), a key mechanism
proposed to underpin age-related muscle loss is
anabolic resistance: defined here as a reduced ability
of skeletal muscle to mount a youthful response of
MPS to ingesting meal-like quantities of protein

 (Cuthbertson et al. 2005; Guillet et al. 2004) and/or
other normally anabolic stimuli such as muscle
loading (Durham et al. 2010; Fry et al. 2011; Kumar
et al. 2009). Over time, anabolic resistance would, we
(and others) propose, contribute to the gradual loss of
muscle mass with advancing age via several mecha-
nisms detailed below (Phillips et al. 2012).
The underlying cause of anabolic resistance can be
explained at both cellular and molecular levels. The
stimulation of MPS is fundamentally regulated by the
availability of amino acids (Kimball and Jefferson
2002). Several metabolic factors, both at the cellular
and molecular level, explain the age-related decline in
amino acid availability and thus anabolic resistance.
At the cellular level these factors include, but are not
limited to, dysfunctional gut processes involving
protein/amino acid digestion, absorption and transport
kinetics, an increased retention of amino acids within
splanchnic tissues (Boirie et al. 1997; Volpi et al.
1999) and impairments in microvascular perfusion
(capillary recruitment and dilation). Hence, a relative
hypoaminoacidemia (reduced amino acid availability)
in older persons to ingesting a given quantity of
protein has been proposed to result in a diminished
capacity for stimulation of MPS.
At the molecular level, proposed mechanisms can
be categorised into impaired translational efficiency
(Cuthbertson et al. 2005; Guillet et al. 2004) and
translational capacity (Kirby et al. 2015). With regards
to both translational efficiency and translational
capacity, some studies show that activation of the
mechanistic/mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(mTOR)/p70s6 kinase 1 (p70s6K1) signalling path-
way—an integral signalling axis that regulates MPS—
may be impaired in older adults in response to both
protein feeding and exercise (Cuthbertson et al. 2005;
Guillet et al. 2004). However, other studies in fact
show an enhanced activation of these pathways in
older muscle in response to resistance exercise or
feeding (Farnfield et al. 2012; Mayhew et al. 2009).
Furthermore, a systematic analysis of the basal
activation of these pathways in young and old muscle
demonstrates that they are higher in the fasted state in
older individuals (Markofski et al. 2015). Thus, there
appears to be discordance between the molecular
pathways that control MPS and the actual rates/ca-
pacity for stimulation of MPS in older muscle. One
interpretation could be that a molecular block else-
where exists in a place other than between mTOR and
p70s6K1 in the pathway(s) from sensing nutrition/
mechanical strain and the molecular induction of a
protein synthetic response. Ultimately, it appears that
older muscle does have a reduced ability to transduce
nutritional and loading signals and thus stimulate
MPS, however the precise location of this reduced
signal transduction is not known.
With regards to the nutritional stimulation of MPS,
amino acid availability is modulated by several dietary
factors, including the essential amino acid (EAA)
content of the protein source, amount of protein
ingested (as a single dose), timing, pattern and
coingestion of other nutrients. In addition, physical
activity/exercise enhances the ability of skeletal
muscle to respond to amino acid provision (Pennings
et al. 2011a, b; Timmerman et al. 2012). In this regard,
the most likely contributing mechanism is an exercise-
induced increase in blood flow to the muscle (Biolo
et al. 1997) that increases the delivery of amino acids
to the muscle, thus increasing the provision of
substrate for MPS (Biolo et al. 1997). Conceptually,
interventions that enhance postprandial amino acid
utilization in the ageing population would be benefi-
cial. Whilst some pharmaceutical anabolic agents,
such as testosterone, growth hormone and dehy-
droepiandosterone therapy have been shown to coun-
teract muscle loss, their utility is limited due to a poor
side-effect profile (Osterberg et al. 2014; Rolf and
Nieschlag 1998). Thus, identifying simple (and sus-
tainable) non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions
targeted at preserving muscle mass and function are
crucial for facilitating longer, healthier lives into old
age. Physical activity and nutrition offer the most
promising candidates and, in the context of this
review, are considered to be at the nexus of getting
older with health and vitality.
Refining physical activity and exercise guidelines
Physical activity is associated with a panoply of health
benefits including, but not limited to, improved
cardiovascular fitness and strength, as well as a
reduced risk for multiple chronic diseases. Current
guidelines for physical activity in the United Kingdom
recommend that adults 65? years old should aim to
perform 30 min of physical activity, in bouts of
10 min or more, at least 5 days per week (National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2009).
532

 These guidelines include brisk walking, ballroom
dancing, climbing stairs and running as examples of
physical activity. Additional suggestions, in terms of
physical activity modality, have been made for
improving muscle strength of older adults. For
instance, carrying or moving heavy loads such as
groceries, as well as weight-bearing activities that
involve stepping and jumping (i.e., dancing). As such,
current physical activity guidelines for older adults
take a broad approach encompassing a diversity of
activities, ranging from everyday tasks to organised
recreational activities. These guidelines are, in our
view, somewhat ambiguous and non-specific for older
adults. A conspicuous omission from these guidelines
is the specific recommendation of structured resis-
tance exercise for promoting the retention of strength
and balance and an associated improvement in the
health and vitality of older adults (Ferreira et al. 2012).
Resistance exercise has been widely used to
enhance muscle mass and strength in a variety of
populations (Peterson et al. 2010), including adults
older than 75 years of age (i.e., those at greatest risk of
anabolic resistance) who also display a marked ability
to increase muscle mass and strength in response to
resistance exercise training (Churchward-Venne et al.
2015). For example, in one study, 24 weeks of
resistance exercise training in healthy elderly men
and women significantly increased leg muscle mass by
*10 %, type 2 muscle fibre cross sectional area by
*25 % and one repetition maximum strength by
*40 %, and as well as reducing sit-to-stand time by
*18 % (Leenders et al. 2013). Other researchers
investigating the impact of structured resistance
exercise on skeletal muscle strength and morphology
have observed similar results (Churchward-Venne
et al. 2015). It is important to note that varying degrees
of hypertrophy are often apparent between individu-
als, with those exhibiting the least gains commonly
referred to as ‘non-responders’ (Davidsen et al. 2011).
However, in a recent retrospective analysis from three
separate resistance exercise-training studies, Church-
ward-Venne and colleagues (Churchward-Venne et al.
2015) demonstrated that there are in fact, no true non-
responders to resistance training. What these authors
show is that, whilst some older men and women failed
to show significant improvement in an end-point
measure such as muscle mass in response to a given
resistance exercise protocol, they did show improve-
ments in other clinically relevant parameters such as
strength. Moreover, these improvements were posi-
tively associated with the duration of training (i.e., the
longer the training the greater the improvements).
Thus, refraining from resistance exercise in the belief
that someone may not sufficiently ‘respond’ is
currently an unsubstantiated assertion. Based on the
available evidence, we therefore propose that resis-
tance exercise should become a critical component of
any future refined directives aimed at improving the
functional independence of older adults.
Whilst the beneficial impact of resistance exercise
on skeletal muscle mass and strength has received
significant scientific attention, less emphasis has been
placed on the role of aerobic exercise for preserving
muscle mass of older adults. Since walking is the
preferred mode of physical activity for older adults
(Booth et al. 1997), as reflected by higher participation
rates compared with resistance exercise (Manson et al.
2002), aerobic-based physical activity may be con-
sidered an important, albeit underappreciated, inter-
vention targeted at overcoming age-related muscle
mass and strength loss. Traditionally, aerobic exercise
has been associated with improved oxidative capacity
(Short et al. 2003), glycemic control (Lukacs and
Barkai 2015) and cardiovascular fitness (Gibala et al.
2012). However, recent data also highlight the
anabolic potential of aerobic-based exercise. For
instance, one study reported a significant increase in
quadriceps muscle volume and muscle power in older
individuals who cycled for 20–45 min, at 60–80 %
heart rate reserve, 3–4 times per week for 12 weeks
(Harber et al. 2012). Similarly, older women who
performed 12 weeks of progressive cycling showed
increased quadriceps size (*12 %) and aerobic
capacity (*30 %) (Harber et al. 2009). It is important
to acknowledge that other studies have failed to detect
an impact of aerobic exercise training on muscle mass
in older adults (Short et al. 2004; Sipila and Suominen
1995). Such discrepant findings may be related to
between-study differences in participant characteris-
tics, such as training history and/or age, as well as
exercise modality and intensity. Support for the latter
contention arises from studies demonstrating that high
intensity interval training (HIT) has the capacity to
stimulate increases in MPS comparable to those of
resistance-based exercise (Bell et al. 2015; Di Donato
et al. 2014). Whereas continuous (low-intensity)
aerobic-based exercise is characterised by exercise
performed at a constant workload, HIT consists of

 brief, intermittent bursts of vigorous activity inter-
spersed by periods of reduced activity or rest (Gibala
et al. 2014). These bursts of activity are thought to be a
key factor in stimulating MPS. A common miscon-
ception of HIT relates to health and safety, with the
perception that HIT may render individuals, specifi-
cally those with cardiac issues, more susceptible to
adverse cardiac events. However, closer inspection of
available literature reveals that older individuals are at
no greater risk when performing HIT compared to
continuous training (Rognmo et al. 2012).
The physiological mechanisms underpinning the
hypertrophic impact of aerobic exercise on skeletal
muscle remain to be elucidated, but are thought to be
distinct from those regulating resistance exercise-
induced increases in muscle mass (Philp et al. 2015).
Some
evidence
suggests
that
aerobic
exercise
improves nutrient delivery to skeletal muscle by
resulting in an enhanced feeding-induced vasodilation
and thus amino acid delivery. Indeed, Timmerman and
colleagues (Timmerman et al. 2012) demonstrated that
performing a bout of aerobic exercise (45 min on a
treadmill at 60–70 % heart rate reserve) enhanced the
rates of MPS in response to essential amino acid and
sucrose ingestion 18 h later. A key mechanistic
finding of this study was that the prior bout of aerobic
exercise increased microvascular perfusion and amino
acid delivery to the muscle. Given that anabolic
resistance may be, in part, due to reduced amino acid
delivery to the muscle (Boirie et al. 1997; Volpi et al.
1999), aerobic exercise could be a viable means to
improve the anabolic impact of protein feeding. Thus,
aerobic exercise not only appears to be effective at
improving aerobic capacity, but also other clinically
relevant health factors such as muscle mass, and in
some instances, muscle strength. However, in order
for adaptations to resistance or aerobic-based exercise
to be sustained in the long-term, the adequate provi-
sion of nutrition, specifically dietary protein intake, is
essential. In this regard, we review here the latest,
evidence-based, nutritional recommendations for sup-
porting musculoskeletal health with advancing age.
Optimizing the quantity of protein recommended
on a per meal basis
Several recent insightful reviews propose the most
pragmatic approach to devising protein recommen-
dations for older adults is to express protein intakes on
a meal-by-meal basis, rather than the more traditional
daily basis (Moore 2014; Paddon-Jones and Ras-
mussen 2009; Paddon-Jones et al. 2015). This argu-
ment is primarily driven by results from a series of
acute metabolic studies, in both young and older
adults, that characterised the relationship between
ingesting a single dose of protein and the postprandial
stimulation of MPS (Cuthbertson et al. 2005; Moore
et al. 2009; Pennings et al. 2012; Robinson et al. 2013;
Symons et al. 2009; Witard et al. 2014; Yang et al.
2012a, b). As such, the optimal meal protein intake
represents the dose of protein that acutely stimulates a
maximal postprandial response of MPS. These studies
examined a range of protein sources, including intact
proteins (whey, soy) and complete protein-rich foods
(e.g. beef) at rest and during exercise recovery in either
young (Cuthbertson et al. 2005; Moore et al. 2009;
Witard et al. 2014) or older (Cuthbertson et al. 2005;
Pennings et al. 2012; Robinson et al. 2013; Yang et al.
2012a, b) adults. In young adults (of *75–80 kg body
mass), the postprandial response of MPS reached a
plateau with 20 g of ingested protein (Moore et al.
2009; Witard et al. 2014). Forty grams of protein
stimulated non-anabolic processes such as increased
rates of amino acid oxidation and urea production, but
failed to potentiate an increased stimulation of MPS.
By comparison, in middle- to older-aged adults, the
protein dose-MPS response curve was shifted to the
right and exhibited a lower gain per protein dose
relative to young adults. The postprandial response of
MPS continued to increase with ingestion of 35–40 g
compared with 20 g of protein (Pennings et al. 2011b;
Yang et al. 2012a). A growing consensus is this
rightward shift is not mediated by biological age per
se, but also is influenced by increased prevalence of
muscle disuse due to reduced physical activity levels
associated with advanced age. Nonetheless, whereas
these collective data are unable to identify the optimal
meal protein intake (expressed on an absolute basis)
for maximal stimulation of MPS in older adults, it is
clear that the optimal meal protein intake for older
adults exceeds that of young adults. Interestingly,
whereas a sex-specific difference in the response of
MPS to exercise and protein ingestion is not seen in
young adults (Dreyer et al. 2010; Scalzo et al. 2014;
Smith et al. 2009), a sex-based difference in the
postprandial response of MPS has been reported in
older adults (Smith et al. 2008). Thus, although not
534

 directly evaluated, these data suggest that the optimal
single bolus dose of protein in older adults may differ
between men and women. Future studies are war-
ranted to test this thesis and to fully establish the
optimum meal protein intake for older adults.
Whereas the postprandial response of MPS to a
single protein feed has received much attention, the
aggregate daytime stimulation of MPS in response to
multiple protein feeds (mimicking a typical daily meal
feeding cycle) has only recently been investigated in
young (Areta et al. 2013; Mamerow et al. 2014) and
older (Kim et al. 2014) adults. Theoretically, the
daytime stimulation of MPS depends, not only on
stimulating a maximal response of MPS to each meal,
but also on the spacing and frequency of daily meals.
A recent study in young adults (Mamerow et al. 2014)
demonstrated a greater 24 h response of MPS to a
balanced meal pattern that distributed 90 g of protein
evenly between three meals (3 9 30 g), spaced
3.5–4 h apart versus a conventional (Tieland et al.
2012; Valenzuela et al. 2013) skewed meal pattern that
biased daily protein intake (*63/90 g) towards the
evening meal. Thus, despite an equal total daily
protein intake (90 g), the aggregate daytime stimula-
tion of MPS was greater with a balanced meal pattern
that spread daily protein intake evenly between meals.
A theoretical explanation for this differential aggre-
gate daytime response of MPS is a more favourable
cyclical fluctuation pattern of aminoacidemia, in
particular leucinemia, with a balanced pattern of
protein ingestion (Mamerow et al. 2014). In light of
this fluctuating pattern of amino acid availability, a
threshold leucine availability was surpassed with each
meal, switching on the muscle anabolic signalling
proteins that stimulate MPS. Thus, there is preliminary
evidence that distributing total daily protein intake
evenly between meals offers an effective strategy to
potentiate the aggregate daytime stimulation of MPS
in young adults.
The impact of protein meal pattern on muscle mass
regulation in older adults is not well established.
Previous studies have collected measurements of
(acute) muscle protein metabolism (Kim et al. 2014),
whole body protein metabolism (Arnal et al. 2000;
Kim et al. 2014) and/or (chronic) changes in muscle
mass (Bouillanne et al. 2013) and reported equivocal
findings. For example, an observational study (Boll-
wein et al. 2013) compared the habitual protein
distribution pattern between frail and non-frail older
adults of similar age and reported that frail older adults
(i.e., those that suffered the most muscle loss)
habitually consumed a large proportion of daily
protein intake in a single meal, whereas non-frail
adults (i.e., those suffering the least muscle loss)
balanced their daily protein intake more evenly
between meals. In contrast, an intervention-based
study (Bouillanne et al. 2013) in institutionalised, frail
older adults reported a greater increase in muscle mass
when total daily protein intake was consumed primar-
ily as one discrete lunchtime meal rather than a more
balanced spread of daily protein intake between
breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and evening meals.
These conflicting findings (Bouillanne et al. 2013) to
results in young adults (Areta et al. 2013; Mamerow
et al. 2014) may be reconciled by the quantity of
protein contained in each meal of the balanced pattern
(range: 12–21 g) being insufficient for the maximal
acute stimulation of MPS in the older adults studies by
Bouillanne et al. (2013). As we (Moore et al. 2014)
and others (Pennings et al. 2011b; Yang et al. 2012a)
have previously established the maximal per meal
protein dose in older subjects is well beyond 21 g per
meal.
A recent study (Kim et al. 2014) demonstrated that
a balanced protein meal pattern, whereby each meal
likely contained a sufficient quantity of protein
(*37 g) for the maximal acute stimulation of MPS,
conferred no advantage regarding the daytime stimu-
lation of MPS in healthy older adults. However, this
study (Kim et al. 2014) was likely underpowered given
that the sample size of the unbalanced group was only
four participants. In theory, older adults that follow a
meal pattern spacing each optimal protein dose
sufficiently far apart to allow for a repeated stimula-
tion of MPS will delay the onset, or slow the
progression, of muscle mass loss with advanced age
(Paddon-Jones and Rasmussen 2009). On a practical
level, modifications of daily protein distribution
should target the breakfast meal that is often the meal
with lowest protein content. However, to date no study
has comprehensively investigated the influence of
protein meal pattern, combined with resistance or
aerobic-based physical activity, on the aggregate
daytime response of MPS to multiple meals in older
adults. Exciting recent developments in tracer method-
ology, namely the oral deuterium oxide (2H2O)
method, allows for the measurement of integrated
rates of MPS and MPB over prolonged periods (days

 to weeks) (Bell et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2013;
Wilkinson et al. 2014) and thus is ideally suited to
evaluating the impact of protein meal pattern on
muscle
protein
metabolism
over
extended
time
periods.
Whilst data from acute metabolic dose-response
studies provide the basis for informing recommenda-
tions regarding the optimal quantity of protein to
consume in each meal or combination of meals, the
practical application of these data has been questioned
(Drummond 2015; Moore et al. 2014). Essentially,
these studies plotted the postprandial response of MPS
against set quantities (i.e., not adjusted for BM or lean
body mass) of high-quality protein, ranging from 0 to
40 g. As discussed below, protein guidelines (mini-
mum protein requirement and optimal protein recom-
mendations) are typically expressed relative to total
body mass. Thus, it may be argued that establishing an
optimal meal protein intake on a relative basis (g/kg
BM/meal) provides a more informative approach for
older adults. Accordingly, a retrospective analysis of
serial dose-response studies revealed the optimal
relative dose of protein in a single serving for the
maximal resting postprandial stimulation of myofib-
rillar-MPS to be 0.40 g/kg BM in older adults; *68 %
greater than calculated in young adults (0.24 g/kg
body mass) (Moore et al. 2014). Thus, assuming three
meals are consumed each day, a relative protein dose
of 0.4–0.5 g/kg BM/meal is consistent with recent
expert opinions concerning the optimal daily protein
intake (1.2–1.5 g/kg BM/day) for healthy older adults
(Bauer et al. 2013; Deutz et al. 2014), as discussed
below.
Optimizing the quality and utilization of protein
intake on a per meal basis
In practice, the recommendation to consume larger
(e.g. exceeding a meal-like portion) and frequent
(3–49 day) protein feeds (%30 g protein/meal for a
70 kg person at 0.4–0.5 g/kg BM/meal) may be
challenging, or even counter-productive, for some
older adults. Appetite is often suppressed with
advancing age (Westenhoefer 2005). Several other
factors, including physical and mental disabilities that
limit shopping, food preparation and food insecurity
due to financial and social limitations (Deutz et al.
2014) may also make it difficult for older adults to
consume sufficient protein. To compound this issue,
protein-rich foods exhibit greater satiety value than
carbohydrate- or fat-rich food sources (Rolls et al.
1988). Hence, optimizing the quality of protein
ingested in each meal also is considered to be of
significant clinical value for offsetting age-related
muscle loss.
In the context of muscle mass regulation, high
quality protein refers to the efficient utilisation of
ingested protein for maximising the postprandial
stimulation of MPS (Millward et al. 2008). Protein
quality is defined by the biological and physical
properties of a protein source. Biological quality is
dictated by two inter-related factors, namely the amino
acid content and digestibility (and subsequent absorp-
tion kinetics) of the protein source that collectively
determine amino acid bioavailability. As described
previously, in terms of amino acid profile, the leucine
content of a protein source is of particular importance
for stimulating a postprandial response of MPS.
Leucine not only provides substrate for the synthesis
of new muscle protein, but also serves as a key
anabolic signal for skeletal muscle by activating
enzymes within the mTOR signalling pathway (An-
thony et al. 2001). Indeed, the leucine threshold
hypothesis (Rieu et al. 2006) has been proposed to
explain the observation that young muscle appears
relatively sensitive to the anabolic action of small
(*1 g) quantities of ingested leucine, whereas older
muscle requires C2 g of leucine (typically contained
in *20 g of high-quality protein) to increase MPS
above resting rates (Phillips 2015). The physical
property of protein sources refers to the food matrix
(solid, semi-solid or liquid form). Food matrix also
impacts amino acid digestibility (Conley et al. 2011).
Thus, from a protein quality standpoint, it is com-
monly accepted that a rapidly digested and leucine-
rich protein source is best positioned to activate
mTOR and stimulate a postprandial response of MPS.
As already mentioned, leucine acts both as a trigger
for initiating MPS, and as substrate for the synthesis of
new muscle protein. Therefore, the efficient utilization
of ingested amino acids for the postprandial stimula-
tion of MPS depends, in part, on the leucine content of
the protein source. Three lines of evidence suggest that
enhancing the proportion of leucine contained in a
protein source confers an anabolic advantage in older
adults. First, two studies in older adults matched the
dose of ingested EAA between conditions, but
536
Biogerontology (2016) 17:529–546
123
 manipulated the leucine composition of the ingested
EAA source (Dickinson et al. 2014; Katsanos et al.
2006). Results showed that ingestion of a leucine-
enriched EAA feed amplified the resting postprandial
stimulation of MPS (Katsanos et al. 2006) and
prolonged the post-exercise (Dickinson et al. 2014)
stimulation of MPS in response to ingesting a subop-
timal dose (6.7–10 g) of EAA. Second, a recent study
in older adults extended these findings by reporting a
similar
resting
postprandial
and
post-exercise
response of myofibrillar-MPS to ingestion of a
leucine-enriched low dose of EAA (containing 1.2 g
leucine; 3 g EAA) compared with feeding a 20 g bolus
of whey protein (containing 2 g leucine; 9.6 g EAA)
(Bukhari et al. 2015). These data corroborate, in part,
earlier findings in young adults whereby ingestion of a
leucine-enriched suboptimal (6.25 g) dose of whey
protein stimulated a similar resting postprandial
response of MPS compared with an optimal (25 g)
dose of whey protein (Churchward-Venne et al. 2012).
Thus, in terms of optimizing the utilisation of ingested
amino acids for the postprandial stimulation of MPS,
increasing the proportion of leucine contained in a
suboptimal dose of protein offers a practical, low
calorie and less satiating alternative to ingesting an
appreciably larger amount of protein for some older
adults. Future studies should provide a similar com-
parison between a leucine-enriched suboptimal pro-
tein dose (i.e., 20 g of whey protein) and an optimal
protein dose (*40 g of whey protein) in older adults
at rest and during exercise recovery. Finally, several
studies in older adults have manipulated the leucine
content of an amino acid source by providing
additional leucine (Casperson et al. 2012; Koopman
et al. 2008; Verhoeven et al. 2009; Wall et al. 2013).
The addition of leucine (?2.5 g) to a meal-like feed of
casein protein (20 g) increased the utilisation of
ingested amino acids (Wall et al. 2013) for the
postprandial stimulation of MPS (Rieu et al. 2006;
Wall et al. 2013). In addition, 2 weeks of leucine
supplementation increased the resting postabsorptive
and postprandial response of MPS to a suboptimal
dose of EAA plus carbohydrate (Casperson et al.
2012). However, the addition of leucine to a protein
source does not necessarily enhance the muscle
protein anabolic response. For instance, coingesting
leucine with a ‘leucine-rich’ whey protein plus
carbohydrate mixture failed to potentiate the response
of MPS during exercise recovery (Koopman et al.
2005) and no chronic change in muscle mass was
observed after 12 weeks of supplementing a moderate
protein diet (*1.0 g/kg BM/day, *6.3 g leucine per
day) with additional leucine at each main meal
(Verhoeven et al. 2009). Taken together, these data
suggest the efficacy of supplemental leucine for
modulating muscle mass in older adults depends on
the leucine content of the original protein source or
diet. Future work is warranted to investigate the
influence of adding leucine to other isolated types of
lower leucine-containing proteins, such as soy, rice of
pea protein, on resting postprandial and post-exercise
rates of MPS in older adults.
Other nutrients may increase the utilisation
of ingested protein
Since protein is typically coingested with carbohy-
drate and fat, it is important to understand the impact
of macronutrient coingestion on the utilisation of
ingested protein. The independent ingestion of carbo-
hydrate and fat exerts negligible impact on MPS
following exercise, at least in young adults, likely due
to an insufficient availability of EAA (Borsheim et al.
2004; Miller et al. 2003). Moreover, when meal-like
(*20 g) doses of protein are ingested, coingestion of
moderate (40 g) or larger (60 g) doses of carbohydrate
with protein does not increase the resting postprandial
response of MPS in older adults (Gorissen et al. 2014;
Hamer et al. 2013). The absence of an additive effect is
evident despite a markedly greater increase in blood
insulin concentrations with carbohydrate coingestion
(Gorissen et al. 2014; Hamer et al. 2013). However,
this observation may be limited to the response to
ingestion of a moderate/large protein dose. A previous
study in young adults suggests MPS may be enhanced
when carbohydrates were ingested concurrently with a
small dose of amino acids (containing *6 g EAA)
(Miller et al. 2003). Moreover, ingestion of whole milk
has been shown to stimulate a superior response of
NBAL compared with skimmed milk (both containing
*4 g EAA) in young adults (Elliot et al. 2006). Given
that the only difference between conditions in this
study (Elliot et al. 2006) was the fat content, these data
suggest the combined ingestion of fat and carbohy-
drate may enhance the utilisation of a suboptimal
amount of EAA for MPS or even suppress MPB. More
recent results, also in young adults, are consistent with
Biogerontology (2016) 17:529–546
537
123
 the notion that adding carbohydrate and fat to smaller
amounts of EAA (in the form of an intact protein) may
enhance the response of MPS (Churchward-Venne
et al. 2012, 2014). Indeed, a leucine-enriched subop-
timal dose of whey protein stimulated an inferior post-
exercise response of MPS compared with an optimal
dose of whey protein when consumed independent of
other macronutrients (Churchward-Venne et al. 2012).
However, coingesting carbohydrate and fat with a
leucine-enriched suboptimal protein dose stimulated a
similar post-exercise response of MPS compared with
an optimal protein dose (Churchward-Venne et al.
2014). Taken together, these data (Churchward-Venne
et al. 2012, 2014) suggest that carbohydrate and fat
intake may impact the utilisation of ingested EAA for
MPS following exercise, particularly if the amount of
EAA is suboptimal. Clearly, more work is now
needed, especially in older adults, regarding the
impact of macronutrient co-ingestion on muscle
anabolism both at rest and following exercise.
The efficacy of other nutritional interventions, such
as supplementation with fish oil-derived n-3 polyun-
saturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs), for increasing the
utilisation of ingested protein has been studied (Smith
et al. 2011b, 2015). Indeed, 8 weeks of supplementa-
tion with a daily dose of 1.86 g of eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and 1.50 g of docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) was shown to potentiate rates of MPS in
response to simulated feeding (a hyperaminoaci-
demic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp) in young, middle-
aged and older adults (Smith et al. 2011a, b). The
authors also identified this potentiated response of
MPS with n-3 PUFAs was associated with enhanced
mTORC-p70S6K1 phosphorylation, thus providing
one potential mechanism of action. There also have
been other reports corroborating the anabolic influ-
ence of n-3 PUFA consumption on skeletal muscle.
Indeed, one such study supplemented older adults with
0.40 g/d of EPA and 0.3 g/d DHA during 90 days of
resistance exercise training and reported greater
strength gains in older women compared with a
placebo (Rodacki et al. 2012). Moreover, expanding
upon their initial work, Smith and colleagues recently
demonstrated that daily ingestion of n-3 PUFAs (1.86
EPA and 1.50 DHA) increased handgrip strength and
thigh volume in older men even in the absence of
structured exercise training (Smith et al. 2015). The
clinical implications of these data are particularly
significant given that handgrip strength (Leong et al.
2015), and strength in general (Metter et al. 2002), are
known predictors of all-cause mortality. The mecha-
nism by which n-3 PUFA consumption confers this
positive influence is proposed to be attributed to
increases in the n-3 PUFA composition of muscle. In
this regard, we have shown that fish oil supplemen-
tation (3.50 g g/d EPA and 0.9 g g/d DHA) results in
a detectable increase in skeletal muscle n-3 PUFA
composition within 2 wks in young men, and this
increase is related to positive changes in the content of
anabolic
signaling
molecules
(mTOR,
FAK)
(McGlory et al. 2014). Thus, taken together, it appears
that n-3 PUFA supplementation expands the n-3
PUFA composition of muscle that serves to prime
muscle to respond to anabolic stimulation in the form
of feeding and potentially resistance exercise.
As a result of these (Rodacki et al. 2012; Smith et al.
2015) and other investigations, n-3 PUFA supplemen-
tation is now receiving significant attention as a
potential non-pharmacological therapy to combat skele-
tal muscle wasting and promote physical independence
in a variety of settings. However, in our view, the
aforementioned studies should be interpreted with a
degree of caution. For instance, it is important to note
that in the studies by Smith and colleagues (Smith et al.
2011a, b), the provision of amino acids was via an
intravenous infusion, which is not indicative of habitual
protein ingestion, (i.e.,oralintake) andmeasurementsof
MPS were limited to a matter of hours and were not
reflective of mixed meal consumption. Furthermore, in
the work of Rodacki and colleagues (Rodacki et al.
2012), no placebo group was employed, the changes in
n-3 blood composition were very small, and no direct
measures of muscle mass and MPS were made. Even in
our own study (McGlory et al. 2014), measured changes
in the n-3 PUFA composition with n-3 PUFA ingestion
were limited to 4 wks, using a single dose, made in the
absence of changes of muscle function, and were
conducted in a healthy young, male population. So,
before population-wide recommendations can be made,
future work is required, specifically relating to dose, to
establish the efficacy of n-3 PUFA ingestion to enhance
muscle mass and function in older adults. Nevertheless,
these emergent data are promising and may provide a
valuable means in conjunction with exercise to atten-
uate the age-related decline in muscle mass and
function.

 Optimizing protein recommendations on a daily
basis
Despite convincing arguments for communicating
nutritional recommendations on a per meal basis,
currently guidelines are expressed on a daily basis. In
this regard, several recent reviews highlight the
importance of distinguishing between the concepts
of minimum and optimum daily protein intakes for
older adults (Layman et al. 2015; Moore 2014;
Rodriguez and Miller 2015). At present, the Recom-
mended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is set at
0.8 g/kg ideal body mass (BM)/day for healthy adults,
regardless of age and sex. By characterising the
minimum daily protein intake required to achieve
nitrogen balance, this standard approach (i.e., the
RDA) is intended to estimate the minimum daily
protein requirement necessary to avoid negative
nitrogen balance. However, the application of the
protein RDA to informing the protein requirement of
older adults has been criticised for several reasons
other than the well documented methodological lim-
itations associated with accurately quantifying all
routes of nitrogen input and output (Bauer et al. 2013).
First, the meta-analysis of long-term nitrogen balance
studies used to determine the protein RDA primarily
included studies in young adults (18/19 studies) (Rand
et al. 2003). Hence, the RDA value for older adults has
essentially been extrapolated from data generated in
young adults. Second, the adequacy of the current
protein RDA for maintaining whole body nitrogen
equilibrium in older adults, in particular hospitalized
patients (Gaillard et al. 2008), is not supported by
some short-term nitrogen balance studies (Durham
et al. 2010; Fry et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2009). Indeed,
a retrospective assessment of data in older adults
estimated nitrogen equilibrium was achieved at a
protein intake of 0.91 g/kg BM/day (Campbell et al.
1994), which is 15 % greater than the current RDA. In
addition, studies using the indicator amino acid
oxidation technique have reported a greater require-
ment for protein for older women (Rafii et al. 2015;
Tang et al. 2014). Taken together, these lines of
evidence suggest that even the protein RDA value of
0.8 g/kg BM/day underestimates the minimal protein
requirement for older adults. In essence, we and others
(Rodriguez and Miller 2015) propose that the termi-
nology Recommended Dietary Allowance is mislead-
ing
and
likely
contributes
to
the
common
misconception that the protein RDA is intended to
guide a recommended protein intake that people are
allowed to have, rather than minimum protein require-
ment for older adults. Accordingly, new recommen-
dations from international study groups (Bauer et al.
2013; Deutz et al. 2014) propose the minimum daily
protein intake for healthy older adults should be
increased to 1.0–1.2 g/kg BM/day.
Evidence is accumulating that the optimum daily
protein intake for older adults markedly exceeds the
current RDA. International study groups (Bauer et al.
2013; Deutz et al. 2014) recommended 1.2–1.5 g
protein/kg BM/day for adults older than 65 years.
Three separate lines of evidence support this recom-
mendation. First, two long-term intervention studies
standardised the protein intake of healthy older adults
at 0.8 g/kg BM/day (RDA) and reported a decline in
mid-thigh muscle area after 14 weeks (Campbell et al.
2001, 2002). These data suggest the protein RDA is
insufficient for healthy older adults to maintain
skeletal muscle mass. Second, several larger-scale
longitudinal studies reported that higher (
[
1.0 g/kg
BM/day) daily protein intakes could offset the age-
related decline in muscle mass (Gray-Donald et al.
2014; Houston et al. 2008; Meng et al. 2009; Stookey
et al. 2005), strength (Bartali et al. 2012; Beasley et al.
2013; Scott et al. 2010) and physical performance
(Gregorio et al. 2014; Vellas et al. 1997). Although
causality cannot be established from observational
studies, these data suggest older adults who consume a
diet with protein intake higher than the RDA better
preserve muscle size and functional ability. Finally, a
recent intervention study demonstrated a greater
daytime (22 h) MPS response with consumption of a
protein intake equivalent to 2 9 RDA (1.6 g/kg
BM/day) compared with the RDA (0.8 g/kg BM/day)
(Kim et al. 2014). Taken together, these data in older
adults highlight the acute and chronic benefits of
consuming a protein intake greater than the current
RDA on MPS, muscle mass and muscle function.
Future work is needed to refine the recommendation
for an optimum, as opposed to minimum daily protein
intake for musculoskeletal health in older adults.
Whilst the health benefits of recommending protein
intakes above the RDA have received scientific
support (Bauer et al. 2013; Deutz et al. 2014),
concerns over potential negative health implications
to kidney function and bone metabolism in healthy
older adults remain. The age-related decline in
Biogerontology (2016) 17:529–546
539
123
 glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the belief
that high protein intakes are detrimental to kidney
function in older adults (Jiang et al. 2012). In
opposition, scientific evidence has shown that protein
intake increases kidney volume and GFR (Beasley
et al. 2014; Skov et al. 1999), without adverse change
in renal function (Beasley et al. 2011; Knight et al.
2003). According to the acid-ash hypothesis, it has
erroneously been proposed that chronic high protein
diets are detrimental to bone health since protein
(particularly from animal sources) is an important
‘‘acid generating’’ component of the diet, and struc-
tural bone mineral is dissolved to neutralize acids and
avoid systemic acidosis (Buclin et al. 2001; Remer and
Manz 1994). However, a systematic review and meta-
analysis of 35 RCT’s and prospective cohort studies
revealed no association and failure to establish
causality between protein intake and bone health
(assessed by bone calcium retention and bone mineral
density) (Fenton et al. 2011). Indeed, several studies
have reported a positive relationship between protein
intake and peak bone mass in older adults (Hannan
et al. 2000; Sahni et al. 2014). In sum, the assertion
that higher protein intakes result in negative health
outcomes for kidney function and bone metabolism
appears largely flawed. To date, the safe upper limit
for protein intake in older adults has not been
established (Layman et al. 2015); however, based on
available evidence, there is no reason to believe that
protein recommendations of 1.5 g/kg BM/day will
exceed this upper limit for healthy older adults.
Closing remarks
From both an economic and social perspective, older
adults make a positive contribution to today’s society.
However, an inevitable consequence of advancing age
is the gradual loss of muscle mass and strength, termed
sarcopenia. This geriatric condition has known nega-
tive impacts on metabolic health, and in later life, the
ability to perform acts of daily living. Such outcomes
are exacerbated by brief periods of muscle disuse,
which unfortunately are experienced with greater
frequency in older adults. Currently, interventions to
combat sarcopenia are lacking but it is our view that
increasing levels of physical activity, resistance exer-
cise in particular, and adequate protein nutrition
should be the focus. Specifically, physical activity
guidelines for older adults should discourage pro-
longed periods of muscle disuse and should be refined
to include reference to performing some form of
resistive-type exercise as being fundamental to pre-
serving muscle mass and function. Future dietary
recommendations must also consider ways to increase
protein intake whilst taking into account the low
appetite levels often experienced by older adults. Thus
recommendations should target increasing the utilisa-
tion of meal-like quantities of protein for the stimu-
lation of MPS: the key mechanism that regulates
maintenance of skeletal muscle mass with advanced
age. Future nutritional recommendations for older
adults will, we propose, take into consideration the
role other nutrients (ingested alongside protein) play
in sensitising senescent muscle to a protein stimulus.
Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that adequate
spacing of protein ingestion as well as fortification of
protein meals with either leucine or n-3 PUFAs could
be a viable means to enhance daily rates of MPS.
