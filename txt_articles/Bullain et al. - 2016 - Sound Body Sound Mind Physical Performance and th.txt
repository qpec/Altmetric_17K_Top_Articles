OBJECTIVES: To examine the longitudinal association
between physical performance and risk of dementia in
individuals aged 90 and older without dementia.
DESIGN: Population-based longitudinal study.
SETTINGS: The 90+ Study, Laguna Woods, California.
PARTICIPANTS: Men
n = 176
and
women
n = 402
without dementia from The 90+ Study (n = 578, mean age
93.3). At baseline, 54% of participants were cognitively
normal, and 46% had cognitive impairment, no dementia.
MEASUREMENTS: Physical performance measures (4-m
walk, 5 chair stands, handgrip, standing balance) were
scored from 0 (unable to perform) to 4 (best performance).
The outcome was dementia, diagnosed according to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, criteria. Hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia
in relation to baseline physical performance were estimated
using
Cox
regression
after
adjustment
for
potential
confounders. HRs and P-values for the overall Wald
chi-square are reported to show the magnitude of each
physical performance measure and the strength of the asso-
ciation between each measure and incident dementia.
RESULTS: Poor physical performance in most measures
was associated with greater risk of incident dementia over a
mean follow-up of 2.6 years (range 0.6–9.0 years). After
controlling for potential confounders, standing balance had
the
strongest
association
with
incident
dementia
(HRs = 1.9–2.5, overall P = .02), followed by 4-m walk
(HRs = 1.1–1.8, overall P = .04) and handgrip (HRs = 1.0–
2.0, overall P = .03). The association with five chair stands
was not significant. In a subanalysis limited to cognitively
normal
participants,
HRs
were
attenuated,
but
most
remained in the same direction.
CONCLUSION: Poor physical performance is associated
with risk of developing dementia over an average 2.6-year
follow-up in the oldest-old, indicating that poor physical
performance may be an early sign of late-age dementia. J

n the United States, the number of people living to age
90 and older the oldest-old, is projected to quadruple by
2050, resulting in 8.7 million of the oldest-old individuals
by midcentury.1,2 Living longer does not necessarily mean
living well, as the oldest-old has the highest incidence of
dementia.3 The combination of rapid growth of the oldest
population and high rates of dementia is one of the great-
est public health challenges facing the United States unless
effective treatment or preventive options are identified.
In The 90+ Study, a strong, dose-dependent, cross-
sectional association between poor physical performance
on 4-m walk, balance, five chair stands, and grip strength
and dementia was previously shown, with poorer physical
performance associated with greater odds of prevalent
dementia in the oldest-old.4
Although studies in younger adults (mean age <85)
have shown that poor physical performance is associated
with greater odds of poor cognition cross-sectionally5,6
and longitudinally,7,8 the longitudinal association has not
been evaluated in the oldest-old. Evaluating this associa-
tion in the oldest adults in particular is important because
risk factors for dementia do not have the same effect in
the oldest-old as they have in younger elderly.9,10
Balance-based physical performance measures, espe-
cially walking, are among the most complex neurological
functions of the central nervous system (CNS),11 whereas
strength-based tests rely more on the integrity of the proxi-
mal (five chair stands)12 and distal (handgrip)13 skeletal
muscles and the peripheral nervous system. Similar to bal-
ance-based performance, cognition relies on the integrity
of the CNS. Accordingly, if poor physical performance on

 these measures is associated with the development of
dementia, it may suggest that poor physical performance is
an early manifestation of a shared, underlying central ner-
vous system process.
This study tested the hypothesis that poor physical
performance is prospectively associated with risk of devel-
oping dementia after age 90. Furthermore, based on the
findings of the current authors’ previous cross-sectional
study, it was hypothesized that poor performance on the
balance-based
measures
(4-m
walk,
standing
balance)
would be associated with higher risk of incident dementia
than poor performance on the strength-based measures
(handgrip, five chair stands).
Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine
the prospective association between four measures of phys-
ical performance and incident dementia in the oldest-old.
METHODS
Study Population
Participants were from The 90+ Study, a population-based,
longitudinal study of aging and dementia in people aged 90
and older.14 The sample consisted of survivors of the Leisure
World Cohort, an epidemiological investigation of a south-
ern California retirement community established in the early
1980s.15 The 90+ Study has conducted longitudinal clinical
evaluations,
including
neuropsychological,
neurological,
physical performance, and functional status evaluations, in
addition to medical history assessments, since January 1,
2003. Participants are seen every 6 months. This study of
physical performance included 578 participants from The
90+ Study who were free of dementia, completed at least
one of the physical performance measure tests at baseline,
and had at least one follow-up visit between October 1,
2002, and February 28, 2012.
The University of California at Irvine institutional
review board reviewed and approved the study protocol,
which is consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki.

participants
before they were enrolled in The 90+ Study.
Physical Performance Evaluation
Physical performance tests, based on measures from the
Adult Changes in Thought Study,16 using items from the
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; 4-m timed
walk, five chair stands time, 10-second standing balance,
grip strength),17 were evaluated at baseline. To maintain
consistency with prior publications on physical perfor-
mance, cutoff values of sex-specific performance quartiles
previously
established
in
this
cohort
were
used.4
In
accordance with an earlier study,4 all four physical per-
formance measures were scored from 0 to 4 (0 = unable
to perform, 1 = below first quartile of performance cut-
off, 2 = between first and second quartile of performance
cutoffs, 3 = between second and third quartile of perfor-
mance cutoffs, 4 = best performance, above the cutoff of
the third performance quartile). A detailed description of
the evaluation of physical performance measures in The
90+ Study has been published elsewhere.4
Cognitive Status Evaluation
Cognition was determined at baseline in an in-person eval-
uation based on neurological examination (92%) or Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE)18 score (8%), when a
neurological examination was not available, and classified
as normal; cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND); or
dementia.
During the neurological examination, trained exam-
iners evaluated cognitive status using the MMSE, the
Modified MMSE (3MS),19 and questions from the Clini-
cal Dementia Rating Scale (CDR).20 Cognitive perfor-
mance was determined to be normal or impaired in nine
domains:
memory,
orientation,
language,
calculation,
visuospatial skills, praxis, abstract thinking, judgment,
and other (e.g., attention). Examiners also determined
functional status using the Functional Activities Ques-
tionnaire
(FAQ),21
which
consists
of
12
questions
regarding the participant’s ability to perform instrumen-
tal activities of daily living. Dementia was diagnosed if
participants had impairment in two or more cognitive
domains
and
there
was
evidence
of
functional
loss
because of cognition as outlined by the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,22
criteria. CIND was defined as presence of cognitive or
functional impairment not severe enough to meet the cri-
teria for dementia. Normal cognition was defined as
having
no
evidence
of
impairment
in
any
cognitive
domain
and
having
no
evidence
of
functional
loss
because of cognition.
Age- and education-specific MMSE cutoff scores previ-
ously validated in this cohort were used to determine cog-
nitive status of the small number of participants who did
not undergo a full, in-person neurological examination at
baseline. First, it was determined whether participants had
dementia using age- and education-adjusted cutoff scores
for dementia.23 Participants without dementia were then
further classified as having normal baseline cognition if
their MMSE scores were above the age-specific median
score of the oldest-old without dementia2 or CIND if they
fell below the median. Only participants with normal cog-
nitive status or CIND at baseline were included in the
analyses.
Participants were reevaluated every 6 months during
follow-up. For 84.4% of participants, cognitive status
during follow-up was determined in an in-person neuro-
logical examination. When follow-up data from a full,
in-person
neurological
examination

(10%)
or

yses on February 28, 2012 (5.6%), other available infor-
mation was used in a hierarchical order. MMSE score
was used first (3.1%), and if that was not available,
informant questionnaires were used (7.8%). If neither
MMSE score nor informant questionnaire was available,
the

tive status. For the short CASI, a score of 25 was used

the use of this algorithm have previously been pub-
lished.3

potential
con-
founding variables such as age, sex, level of education,
history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), depres-
sion, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, and
living status were assessed at baseline and included in the
analyses. Education was defined as a categorical variable
(≤high school, vocational school or some college, ≥college
degree). Living status was also defined as a categorical
variable (alone, at home with family or caregiver, assisted
living facility or nursing home). Detailed medical history
was obtained directly from participants. CVD was defined
as history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarc-
tion, atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia, congestive
heart failure, or heart valve disease. Depression was
defined as present if the participant scored 5 or greater
on the Geriatric Depression Scale–Short Form (GDS).29 If
baseline GDS score was missing (21.5%), history of
depression (yes/no) was used to define baseline depression
status.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics
of
participants
who
did
and
did
not
develop dementia were compared using t-tests for continu-
ous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
The relationship between each physical performance
measure and dementia was examined using Cox regression
models that adjusted for age (using chronological age as
the time scale) and including sex as a covariate (Model 1).
Delayed entry into the risk set was used, and participants
were considered at risk and included in analyses from their
age at their baseline evaluation. Participants who devel-
oped dementia contributed to the analyses until their age
at the follow-up evaluation at which they were determined
to have dementia. If it was determined that participants
did not have dementia, they were censored at the age of
their last available follow-up. Physical performance was
included in the models as a categorical variable coded
from 0 (unable to perform) to 4 (best performance), and
the hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia were estimated using
the best-performing group as the reference. The Type 3
Wald chi-squared values are reported for each measure to
estimate the overall association of each physical perfor-
mance measure.
Additional Cox regression analyses (Model 2) were
performed that included the confounders living status, edu-
cation, baseline cognition (normal vs CIND), history of
stroke, TIA, CVD, diabetes mellitus, and depression. To
further evaluate the role of baseline cognition in the
model, the analyses described above (Model 1 and Model
2) we repeated the analyses including only participants
with normal cognition at baseline. Separate analyses were
conducted for each physical performance measure. All
analyses were performed using SAS for Windows version
9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The participant inclusion process is illustrated in Figure 1.
Of 936 participants who agreed to longitudinal, in-person
evaluations every 6 months, 578 who did not have demen-
tia at baseline and had completed at least one physical per-
formance measure test were included in the analyses. The
baseline characteristics of the 578 participants are detailed
in Table 1. Their mean age at baseline was 93.3; 70.0%
were female, 75.8% had more than a high school educa-
tion, 46.0% were classified with CIND, and the rest were
considered cognitively normal. Mean follow-up for all par-
ticipants was 2.6 years, and 36.7% of participants devel-
oped dementia during this time. When participants who
developed dementia were compared with those who did
not, there was no difference in history of TIA (16.1% vs
16.0%, P = .98), stroke (7.4% vs 11.8, P = .07), CVD
(39.6% vs 38.2%, P = .75), depression (12.1% vs 16.0%,
P = .18), or diabetes mellitus (6.0% vs 5.2%, P = .67).
Participants who did not develop dementia had higher

 mean baseline MMSE scores than participants who did
(27.1 vs 25.5 P < .001).
Table 2 shows the number of participants who devel-
oped dementia within each physical performance category.
On all four physical performance measures, the category
“unable to perform” had the highest proportion of partici-
pants with incident dementia.
Table 3 shows the number of participants in the five
performance categories of each performance measure using
the previously published sex-specific performance cutoffs.4
The distribution of participants was somewhat dispropor-
tionate in this study, with more participants falling into
the higher-performance groups (score 3 and 4).
Table 3 also shows the HRs of dementia for each
physical performance score in all participants. In Model 1,
adjusted for age and sex, impairment in any physical per-
formance measure was associated with greater risk of inci-
dent dementia and showed the strongest associations for
the balance-based tests of 4-m walk and standing balance.
Model 2 adjusted for potential confounders in addition to
age and sex, including baseline cognitive status (normal vs
CIND); history of stroke, TIA, depression, CVD, and dia-
betes mellitus; living status; and level of education. The
HR estimates in Model 2 were slightly attenuated, but
their trends remained similar to those in Model 1. Stand-
ing balance had the strongest association with incident
dementia (overall Wald v2 = 12.10, P = .02), followed by
4-m walk (Wald v2 = 10.28, P = .04) and handgrip (Wald

 v2 = 10.73, P = .03). There was no association between
five chair stands and incident dementia (overall Wald
v2 = 4.13, P = .39).
Table 4 presents the analyses limited to participants
with normal baseline cognition. These analyses examined
only participants whose baseline cognition was defined as
normal because of the concern that the physical perfor-
mance of participants classified with CIND may have been
impaired because they were already in the process of con-
verting to dementia. The results of Models 1 and 2 in this
subset of participants with normal baseline cognition
showed trends similar to those of the main analyses that
included all participants (Table 3), although most of the
associations in these repeat analyses lost their statistical
significance.
Last, to compare the effect of assigning cognitive diag-
noses from in-person neurological examination with that
of other sources of information, the main analyses were
repeated excluding all participants whose final cognitive
diagnosis was not determined in an in-person neurological
examination (15.6%). In these analyses, the overall associ-
ations weakened but remained similar to the results of the
main analyses. Balance-based tests (4-m walk, standing
balance) continued to show the strongest overall associa-
tion with incident dementia (Wald v2 = 9.41, P = .05 for
4-m walk; Wald v2 = 9.16, P = .06 for balance). HRs for
handgrip were significant only for unable to perform, and
the overall association was not significantly associated
with the outcome (Wald v2 = 8.88, P = .06). Results for
five chair stands also showed no overall association with
incident dementia (Wald v2 = 2.95, P = .57).
DISCUSSION
Performance on the standing balance test, 4-m walk, and
handgrip was associated with risk of dementia, after con-
trolling for potential confounding variables. Performance
on the five chair stands test was not associated with inci-
dent dementia in the oldest-old. In a subanalysis limited to
participants with normal baseline cognition, the signifi-
cance of the associations lessened, but the overall trend of
the association remained unchanged, with the exception of
4-m walk, for which there was no longer an association.
This observation supports the hypothesis that physical per-
formance outside of the best performance category, espe-
cially poor balance, may be an early sign of late-age
dementia.
To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study
to demonstrate the prospective association between poor
physical performance and dementia in the oldest-old,

 although others have found similar associations in younger
elderly adults (mean age 70.8–80.2).27,30–34
The Adult Changes in Thought study27 examined the
association between physical performance and incident
dementia in 2,288 individuals aged 65 and older and
found that poorer physical performance was associated
with greater risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) over 5.9 years of follow-up. Similar to the
current findings, the strongest associations were observed
in balance-based measures of standing balance and walk-
ing speed. Other studies have reported greater cognitive
decline in people with poor performance on walking
speed33 and handgrip32 and on a composite performance
measure
of
multiple
physical
performance
tests.30
Although these studies were conducted in younger elderly,
the magnitude of the associations was similar to the cur-
rent findings.
The temporal pattern of the association, in which
poor physical performance is detected 2–3 years before
the onset of dementia, is consistent with the idea that
poor physical performance may be an early sign of late-
age dementia. Supporting this concept are previous find-
ings from The 90+ Study, in which the presence of CNS
pathology
was
related
to
cognitive
and
physical
performance.35,36 We hypothesize that a stronger rela-
tionship between balanced-based tests (standing balance
and 4-m walk) and dementia than between strength-
based tests (handgrip and 5 chair stands) and dementia
may be a manifestation of underlying CNS pathology
affecting both cognition and balance-based measures.
Walking and standing balance are two of the most-
complex neurological functions,11,37 requiring seamless
integration of sensory and motor systems, including the
pyramidal
and
extrapyramidal
systems,
along
with
cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits. The functions of
these
neuronal
structures
involve
most
longitudinal
tracts of the CNS, making them particularly susceptible
to
accumulating
CNS
pathologies.
In
contrast,
five
chair stands and handgrip strength are primarily mea-
sures of proximal and distal muscle strength, respec-
tively.12,13,38
Therefore,
strength-based
tests
may
be
more vulnerable to conditions that affect the muscu-
loskeletal systems (e.g., sarcopenia) than to those that
affect
the
CNS
and,
therefore,
cognition.
Other
researchers also noted that slow gait predicts cognitive
impairment39 and dementia40 and conjectured that a
common underlying CNS pathological process might
cause them.28

OLDEST-OLD PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND DEMENTIA
1413
 If the same underlying pathological process(es) affect
both physical performance and cognition, the temporal
pattern of the relationship may be explained in several
ways. First, there may be a different threshold at which
the underlying disease burden leads to detectable physical
impairment before cognitive impairment. Alternatively, it
is possible that the disease burden affects physical perfor-
mance and cognition to the same extent but that these par-
ticipants were better at compensating for cognitive loss.
This scenario is particularly feasible in this highly educated
cohort. Last, there could be a difference in the sensitivity
of the measures for physical impairment and cognitive
impairment, with subtle changes in physical performance
being detected earlier.
Regardless of the mechanism by which poor physical
performance precedes the onset of dementia, the temporal
pattern of this relationship suggests that evaluating for
poor physical performance may be a clinically useful way
of identifying the oldest-old individuals who are at greater
risk for developing dementia. In addition, this study
demonstrated not only the utility, but also the feasibility
of these measures in one of the world’s largest oldest-old
cohorts exhibiting the entire spectrum of motor abilities.
This study had a number of strengths. It included a
large number of oldest-old participants from a well-charac-
terized cohort. Frequent follow-up evaluations were con-
ducted, allowing the first signs of subtle cognitive changes
to be detected. Alternative sources of information were
used to capture incident dementia when full, in-person
neurological
examination
was
not
available,
usually
because of the participant’s failing health. A subanalysis
including only participants with cognitive diagnosis from a
full, in-person neurological examination demonstrated that
using this combined approach to capture incident dementia
did not change the overall results. Furthermore, the testing
methods were specifically adapted to the needs and limita-
tions of the cohort, further improving the ability to diag-
nose dementia in this cohort in which a large percentage
of participants had sensory deficits.41 Last, the prospective
nature of the study allowed the temporal relationship
between poor physical performance and dementia to be
tested.
Despite the many strengths of the study, it had limita-
tions. First, it was limited to participants aged 90 and
older. Although this may limit the generalizability of the
results to younger elderly, the participants were fairly rep-
resentative of the current oldest-old U.S. population, espe-
cially with regard to sex and race.1 Second, follow-up was
relatively short, in large part because of the high mortality
of this age group. Third, participants with the baseline
diagnosis of CIND, who may already be in the incipient
stages of dementia, were included. Despite this possibility,
a subanalysis limited to participants with normal baseline
cognition showed that exclusion of those with CIND did
not change the overall trend of the associations, even
though the precision of the estimate was lower because of
the limited number of participants in this subanalysis.
Fourth, the distribution of participants in the five levels of
physical performance measures was skewed, with the “un-
able to perform group” being smaller than the other
groups. This skewness was a result of using previously
established cutoff values4 to determine performance level
to maintain consistency with previous publications on
physical performance in the oldest-old. Finally, the out-
come measure was limited to all-cause dementia, and the
association between the various underlying neuropatholo-
gies and poor physical performance was not examined.
Exploration of this relationship is an important next step.
In summary, poor performance in balance-based phys-
ical performance measures (4-m walk, standing balance)
was associated with greater risk of dementia in the oldest-
old. Impairment in these measures may correspond to
underlying CNS pathological processes that lead to physi-
cal and cognitive impairment. Further evaluation of this
relationship will be crucial for developing comprehensive
prevention and treatment strategies for late-age dementia.
