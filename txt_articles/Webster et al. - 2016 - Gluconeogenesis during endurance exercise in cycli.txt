Key points
r Blood glucose is an important fuel for endurance exercise. It can be derived from ingested
carbohydrate, stored liver glycogen and newly synthesized glucose (gluconeogenesis).
r We hypothesized that athletes habitually following a low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet
would have higher rates of gluconeogenesis during exercise compared to those who follow a
mixed macronutrient diet.
r We used stable isotope tracers to study glucose production kinetics during a 2 h ride in cyclists
habituated to either a LCHF or mixed macronutrient diet.
r The LCHF cyclists had lower rates of total glucose production and hepatic glycogenolysis but
similar rates of gluconeogenesis compared to those on the mixed diet.
r The LCHF cyclists did not compensate for reduced dietary carbohydrate availability by
increasing glucose synthesis during exercise but rather adapted by altering whole body substrate
utilization.
Abstract Endogenous glucose production (EGP) occurs via hepatic glycogenolysis (GLY) and
gluconeogenesis (GNG) and plays an important role in maintaining euglycaemia. Rates of GLY
and GNG increase during exercise in athletes following a mixed macronutrient diet; however,
these processes have not been investigated in athletes following a low carbohydrate high fat
(LCHF) diet. Therefore, we studied seven well-trained male cyclists that were habituated to either
a LCHF (7% carbohydrate, 72% fat, 21% protein) or a mixed diet (51% carbohydrate, 33% fat,
16% protein) for longer than 8 months. After an overnight fast, participants performed a 2 h
laboratory ride at 72% of maximal oxygen consumption. Glucose kinetics were measured at rest
and during the final 30 min of exercise by infusion of [6,6-2H2]-glucose and the ingestion of
2H2O tracers. Rates of EGP and GLY both at rest and during exercise were significantly lower
in the LCHF group than the mixed diet group (Exercise EGP: LCHF, 6.0 ± 0.9 mg kg−1 min−1,
Mixed, 7.8 ± 1.1 mg kg−1 min−1, P < 0.01; Exercise GLY: LCHF, 3.2 ± 0.7 mg kg−1 min−1,
Mixed, 5.3 ± 0.9 mg kg−1 min−1, P < 0.01). Conversely, no difference was detected in rates
of GNG between groups at rest or during exercise (Exercise: LCHF, 2.8 ± 0.4 mg kg−1 min−1,
Mixed, 2.5 ± 0.3 mg kg−1 min−1, P = 0.15). We conclude that athletes on a LCHF diet do not
compensate for reduced glucose availability via higher rates of glucose synthesis compared to
athletes on a mixed diet. Instead, GNG remains relatively stable, whereas glucose oxidation and
GLY are influenced by dietary factors.

Introduction
Plasma glucose is an important source of energy for
exercise and can be derived from the ingestion of
exogenous carbohydrate and from glucose produced end-
ogenously by the liver and, to a lesser extent, by the kidneys
(Nuttall et al. 2008). As exercise duration and intensity
increase, the demand for plasma glucose becomes greater
(Romijn et al. 1993; van Loon et al. 2001; Trimmer et al.
2002) such that the termination of exhaustive endurance
exercise is often associated with hypoglycaemia (Coyle
et al. 1986; Cermak & van Loon, 2013). Thus, the liver
plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis
during endurance exercise, particularly when exogenous
carbohydrate is not freely available. Endogenous glucose
production(EGP)occursviatwoprocesses:glycogenolysis
(GLY), which is the hydrolysis of stored liver glycogen, and
gluconeogenesis (GNG), which is the synthesis of new
glucose in the liver and kidneys from precursors such
as lactate, glycerol, certain amino acids and potentially
ketone bodies (Glew, 2010). EGP and particulary hepatic
GLY are potently suppressed by carbohydrate ingestion
and the consequent rise in plasma glucose and insulin
concentrations (Jeukendrup et al. 1999). On the other
hand, low plasma glucose and insulin concentrations
and a rise in plasma glucagon, catecholamine and/or
glucocorticoid concentrations can stimulate EGP. This
tight regulation maintains euglycaemia by matching the
rate of EGP to the rate at which glucose is taken out of the
circulation by tissues.
In endurance athletes who eat a conventional high
carbohydrate or mixed macronutrient diet, the rate of
EGP after an overnight fast doubles from rest to exercise at
�50% of maximal oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2max) (Trimmer et al.
2002) and can increase up to 4-fold from rest to exercise
at 75% ˙
VO2max (Emhoff et al. 2013). These changes are
the result of higher rates of both hepatic GLY and GNG,
although hepatic GLY appears to play the dominant role,
particularly as the intensity of exercise increases. Indeed,
hepatic GLY has been reported to account for as much as
80% of EGP during exercise at 65% ˙
VO2max (Trimmer et al.
2002; Emhoff et al. 2013).
Rates of hepatic GLY are dependent on hepatic glycogen
content (Arkinstall et al. 2004) and are therefore greatest
after a period of high carbohydrate feeding (Bisschop
et al. 2000), although they gradually decline with fasting
(Landau et al. 1996) or as endurance exercise progresses
(Ahlborg et al. 1974). Conversely, the main factor that
determines the rate of GNG is gluconeogenic substrate
delivery to the liver (Miller et al. 2002; Gustavson et al.
2003). For example, lactate is considered the primary pre-
cursor for hepatic GNG (Ahlborg et al. 1974; Consoli
et al. 1990; Meyer et al. 2002) and becomes especially
important as exercise intensity increases and plasma
lactate concentrations rise. During very high intensity
exercise, however, there is a marked reduction in hepatic
blood flow (Wahren et al. 1971), which potentially limits
GNG as a result of reduced precursor delivery (Sumida
et al. 2006). Glycerol becomes an important precursor
during prolonged fasting (Landau et al. 1996; Jensen et al.
2001) or during prolonged exercise when the rates of
lipolysis are increased (Ahlborg et al. 1974). Additionally,
increased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations may
directly stimulate the production of glucose via GNG
(Chen et al. 1999; Roden et al. 2000; Stingl et al. 2001).
Clearly, substrate availability can have a profound
influence on the nature of EGP; however, it is unclear
how altering the macronutrient content of an athlete’s diet
affects rates of GNG and hepatic GLY during exercise. This
is important because low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF)
diets are becoming increasingly popular among athletes as
a potential means of improving endurance performance,
managing weight or reducing the risk of developing
chronic disease (Paoli et al. 2013; Paoli et al. 2015; Volek
et al. 2016). Athletes eating a LCHF diet experience
a dramatic shift away from carbohydrate towards fat
oxidation during exercise (Phinney et al. 1983; Goedecke
et al. 1999; Volek et al. 2016). Even so, they are still able
to sustain relatively high carbohydrate oxidation rates of
between 1.0 and 1.5 g min−1 during prolonged endurance
exercise in the fasted state (Lambert et al. 1994; Zajac et al.
2014). These rates are lower than in control athletes eating
a mixed macronutrient diet (2.0 to 2.5 g min−1) but, in
the context of very limited dietary carbohydrate intake,

it is unclear from where this carbohydrate is derived.
Because athletes eating a LCHF diet have reduced muscle
and liver glycogen stores (Bergstr¨
om et al. 1967; Nilsson
& Hultman, 1973; Phinney et al. 1983; Lambert et al.
1994) and often eat less than 50 g of carbohydrate per
day, we hypothesized that they will produce substantially
more glucose from GNG than athletes eating a diet higher
in carbohydrate. Therefore, the present study aimed to
determine whether there are differences in rates of EGP,
hepatic GLY and total GNG during exercise between
groups of endurance-trained cyclists who habitually eat
either a mixed macronutrient or LCHF diet.
Methods
Ethical approval
The present study was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences,
University of Cape Town, and was performed in
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants before they were enrolled in the study.
Overview of study
The participants in this cross-sectional study included a
group of seven healthy, well-trained male cyclists who
had habitually eaten a LCHF diet for at least the pre-
vious 8 months, and a group of seven healthy ‘control’
cyclists matched for age, body mass index (BMI), cycling
ability and body fat percentage who had habitually eaten
a mixed macronutrient diet for at least as long as the
LCHF group. To confirm eligibility and to match the two
groups, participants underwent a screening phase where
in-depth diet history and anthropometry were assessed.
They also completed a peak power output (PPO) / ˙
VO2max
test on a cycle ergometer and a familiarization trial ride.
Eligible participants then performed a 2 h laboratory ride
at 55% of their PPO, during which stable isotope tracers
were used to study glucose kinetics, whereas indirect
calorimetry was used to estimate whole body substrate
oxidation.
Participants and inclusion/exclusion criteria
Participants were eligible if they were well-trained male
cyclists who had at least 2 years of cycling experience and
hadbeenactivelycompetingand/ortrainingforatleastthe
past 3 months; were free from known metabolic medical
conditions; were not currently taking any medications;
were between the ages of 18 and 45 years; had not gained
or lost more than 2 kg of body weight for at least the
previous 6 weeks; and had not substantially changed their
diet composition for the previous 6 months. Participants
in the LCHF group were included if they ate less than
50 g of carbohydrate per day or no more than 10% of
total calories as carbohydrate. Participants in the mixed
diet group were included if they ate more than 350 g of
carbohydrate per day or more than 50% of total calories
as carbohydrate.
Diet assessment
Habitual diet was assessed using in-depth interviews,
written questionnaires about their diet history and a
non-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. These
tools were used to identify participants that we were
confident had not significantly changed their diets within
the past 6 months and probably fit into either the
LCHF or mixed diet groups. Participants who reported
conflicting information were not enrolled in the study.
Participants then kept a first 3 day diet record, which
included at least one exercising day and one non-work day.
Participants were counselled how to accurately record the
description and quantities of their food intake. With the
assistance of the participant, the investigator then entered
foods and dietary information from the 3 day record
into online Automated Self-Administered 24 hour Recall
(ASA24)software,whichisbasedontheUSDAAutomated
Multiple-Pass Method that has been validated previously
(Kipnis et al. 2003; Moshfegh et al. 2008). Nutrients of
foods not available on ASA24 were entered manually and
all nutrient data in the ASA24 reports were checked by the
investigator. This dietary record was used to determine
eligibility and served as a familiarization for the diet
assessment immediately prior to the tracer infusion trial.
Participants who qualified for the trial were then asked to
maintain their habitual diet for the duration of the study
and the investigators were in regular communication with
the participants during the trial to check that they only
ate foods suitable for their respective diets. In the 3 days
prior to the tracer infusion trial, a second detailed diet
record was kept by the participant, which was captured
into ASA24 on the day of the tracer infusion trial as
described above. All reported data are from this second
3 day diet record. Every participant ate an evening meal
between 18.30 and 19.00 h the day before the experimental
trial. This meal was chosen to be typical of their usual
pre-race meal and was consistent with their habitual
diet assessment in terms of macronutrient content. The
study design allowed glucose kinetics to be investigated
under LCHF or mixed diet conditions closely reflecting
how the respective participants had adapted to train
and race.

(Computrainer Pro 3D; RacerMate, Seattle, Washington,
USA), which was calibrated before and after warm-up
as described previously (Lamberts et al. 2009). After a
10 min warm-up, an incremental test was started at a work
rate of 100 W and the load increased continuously by
20 W min–1 until the participant could no longer sustain a
cadence greater than 70 rpm. Minute ventilation volume
( ˙
VE) and the volume of oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2) and carbon
dioxide production ( ˙
VCO2) per minute were recorded
using a breath-by-breath gas analyser (Jaeger Oxycon
Pro, Hoechberg, Germany) (Macfarlane, 2001), which
was calibrated immediately before each trial. PPO was
calculated as the average workload over the last minute
of the test. ˙
VO2max was calculated as the highest ˙
VO2
averaged over 15 s. Heart rate (HR) was measured during
all exercise trials using a Suunto T6 HR monitor (Suunto
Oy, Vantaa, Finland). Maximal heart rate (HRmax) was
calculated as the highest HR averaged over 4 s during the
PPO test.
Submaximal exercise trials
Participants performed two similar 2 h laboratory rides
separated by 72 h. They were required to use motorized
transport to travel to the laboratory and were instructed to
keep their physical activity to a minimum on the morning
of the rides. The first ride served as a familiarization trial.
Participants performed a light recovery exercise session in
their own time on the day after this familiarization ride but
refrained from exercise the day prior to the experimental
trial. During the experimental ride, stable isotope tracers
were used to study glucose kinetics. Both rides started at a
work rate of 100 W less than 55% of the participant’s PPO.
The work rate was continuously increased up to 55% of
theirPPOoverthefirst12minandthenremainedconstant
at 55% of PPO for the duration of the ride. During the last
5 min of each 15 min interval during the ride, participants
were fitted with a respiration gas analysis mask to record
˙
VE, ˙
VO2 and ˙
VCO2. The first 1 min and last 15 s of each
measurement period were excluded from the analysis to
ensure that steady-state data were used. HR was recorded
continuously during the ride and averaged during the
measurement period. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE)
was recorded before and after each 5 min respiratory gas
collection period using the Borg 6–20 RPE scale (Borg,
1970).
Experimental protocol
An overview of the experimental trial is presented in Fig. 1.
The day before the experimental trial, a baseline blood
sample was collected. That evening, participants ate their
usual pre-race meal between 18.30 and 19.00 h, after which
they fasted until the end of the experimental ride. Between
21.00 and 23.00 h, participants ingested 4 g kg−1 body
weight 2H2O (99.8 atom percent 2H; Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories,Cambridge,MA,USA),whichenrichedtheir
body water to �0.5 % 2H2O (data not shown). The next
morning, participants arrived at the laboratory at 06.00 h
and remained in a supine position when a cannula was
inserted into the antecubital vein of each arm. The right
cannula was used to sample blood and the left was used
for the infusion of [6,6-2H2]-glucose (99 atom percent
2H; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). A heating blanket
was placed over the lower right arm to ensure that the
sampled blood was arterialized. At �06.30 h, a 6.5 mg kg−1
priming dose of [6,6-2H2]-glucose was injected, followed
by a 2 h continuous infusion of [6,6-2H2]-glucose at a rate
of 0.055 mg kg−1 min−1 using an automated syringe pump
(Travenol Auto Syringe Model 5C; Travenol Laboratories
Inc, Hooksett, NH, USA). After 2 h, the [6,6-2H2]-glucose
infusion rate was doubled to 0.11 mg kg−1 min−1 and
the participant commenced the ride. This [6,6-2H2]-
glucose infusion, blood sampling and exercise protocol
is similar to that used previously (Febbraio et al. 2004)
and achieved adequate isotopic equilibrium (data not
shown).
Sample collection
Blood samples for isotope analysis were collected in EDTA
containing tubes prior to the start of [6,6-2H2]-glucose
infusion (–120 min); during the final 20 min of the resting
infusion period (−20, −10 and 0 min); and during the
final 30 min of exercise (90, 105 and 120 min). Blood
samples for hormone and substrate analysis were collected
immediately prior to exercise (0 min), as well as at 30, 60,
90 and 120 min during exercise. Blood for plasma glucose
and lactate analysis was collected in tubes containing
fluoride and oxalate; blood for serum FFA and insulin
analysis was collected in tubes with a clot activator and gel
barrier; blood for plasma glucagon and glycerol analysis
was collected in tubes containing EDTA. All blood samples
for plasma and serum analysis were centrifuged at 3000 g
at 4°C for 10 min immediately after collection. They
were then kept frozen on dry ice for the remainder of
the trial before being stored at −20 or −80 °C prior to
subsequent analysis. Whole blood was used immediately
for β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) analysis. To measure muscle
glycogen usage during the ride, a muscle biopsy was
collected from the vastus lateralis muscle of the right leg
�15 min prior to the start of exercise and from the left leg
within 5–10 min of ending exercise. The suction-assisted
needle biopsy technique described by Bergstr¨
om et al.
(1967) and as modified by Evans et al. (1982) was used.
Muscle samples were rapidly dissected free of connective
tissue and frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for later
analysis.

Isotope enrichment analysis
The fraction of EGP derived from GNG (fractional GNG)
was estimated from plasma samples using the average
deuterium enrichment method (Chacko et al. 2008).
The principle behind this technique is that the glucose
produced via GNG incorporates hydrogen from body
water at all carbon (C) positions (C-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 6),
whereas glucose derived from GLY incorporates hydrogen
ions only at the C-2 position (Wolfe, 1992). Moreover, 2H
incorporation at C-2 is the result of complete 2H exchange
with body water during extensive glucose 6-phosphate to
fructose 6-phosphate isomerization and rapidly achieves
2H enrichment equivalent to that in body water (Landau
et al. 1996). Therefore, after ingestion and equilibration of
2H2O in the total body water pool, the average deuterium
enrichment of glucose at any position besides C-2 reflects
glucose produced via gluconeogenic pathways (Chacko
et al. 2008). Assuming complete equilibration of plasma
2H2O enrichment with deuterium enrichment of glucose
at C-2, fractional GNG can be calculated as the ratio of
average deuterium enrichment of glucose at C-1, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 6 (i.e. not at C-2) to enrichment of plasma 2H2O
(Landau et al. 1996; Chacko et al. 2008). To quantify
these specific glucose isotope enrichments, selective
ion monitoring was performed as described previously
(Chacko et al. 2008). Briefly, the pentaacetate derivatives
of plasma glucose were prepared and analysed using gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (6890N/5975B inert
EI/CI; Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) in
the positive chemical ionization mode using methane as
the reagent gas. Selective ion monitoring of m/z 170/169
was performed to determine the M+1 enrichment of
deuteriuminthecirculatingglucosecarbons(C-1,3,4,5,6
or6)whereMisthebasemass169,representingunlabelled
glucose (Chacko et al. 2008). To accurately measure the
deuterium labelling of glucose from ingested 2H2O, the
enrichment of M+1 resulting from natural abundance
was subtracted. Deuterium enrichment in plasma water
was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(Delta+XL IRMS; Thermo Finnigan, Bremen, Germany)
as described previously (Chacko et al. 2008). The M+2
enrichment of glucose derived from infusion of [6,6-
2H2]-glucose was determined from plasma samples using
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in the electron
impact ionization mode by selective ion monitoring of
m/z 244/242 and was used to measure appearance rate of
glucose as described previously (Bier et al. 1977; Chacko
& Sunehag, 2010).
Kinetics calculations
Rate of appearance (Ra) and rate of disappearance (Rd) of
glucose was calculated during the last 20 min of rest (−20,
−10 and 0 min) and during the last 30 min of exercise (90,
105 and 120 min) using the non-steady-state equations of
Steele modified for use with stable isotopes (Wolfe, 1992):
Ra = [F − V((C1 + C2)/2)((IE2 − IE1)/(t2 − t1))]/
[(IE1 + IE2)/2]
Rd = Ra − V[(C2 − C1)/(t2 − t1)]
Where Ra and Rd are in mg kg–1 min–1, F is the infusion
rate (mg kg–1 min–1), V is the blood pool (0.18 l kg−1)
(Emhoff et al. 2013), C is the plasma concentration of
glucose (mg dl–1), IE is the M+2 enrichment (molar
percent excess) and t is the sampling time (min). The
infusion rate was subtracted from Ra to calculate the rate
of EGP (mg kg–1 min–1).

Fractional GNG was calculated from the average M+1
enrichment of 2H2O as:
Average M+1 enrichment = (M+1)(2H)(m/z170/169)/6
Fractional GNG = Average M + 1 enrichment/E 2H2O)
Where (M+1)(2H)(m/z 170/169) is the M+1 enrichment of
deuterium in glucose measured using m/z 170/169 minus
the natural abundance M+1 enrichment, ‘6’ is the number

(Chacko et al. 2008).
Absolute rates of GNG and hepatic GLY were calculated
as:

Substrate analysis
All sample analyses except for βHB were performed
in duplicate and the intra-assay coefficient of variation
(CV) is provided for each assay. Plasma glucose (CV,
1.82%) and lactate concentrations (CV, 0.9%) were
determined using the glucose oxidase method (YSI 2300;
STAT PLUS, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). Serum insulin
concentrations (CV, 0.58%) were determined using auto-
mated chemiluminescence (Centaur CP system; Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., New York, NY, USA). Blood
βHB concentrations were determined immediately after
sampling using a FreeStyle Optium Xceed β-ketone meter
and FreeStyle Optium H test strips (Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL, USA). Serum FFA concentrations (CV,
4.6%) were determined using a commercial kit (FFA
half-micro test; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany) and a Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek
Synergy HT; BioTek Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Plasma
glucagon concentrations (CV, 19%) were determined
using a commercial kit (Glucagon EIA Kit; Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA). Serum glycerol concentrations (CV,
6.7%) were determined using a commercial kit (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK).
Muscle glycogen
Muscle glycogen content was measured as glucose
equivalents using the glucose oxidase method following
the acid hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose (Passonneau
& Lauderdale, 1974). Approximately 20 mg of muscle
(wet weight) was weighed and freeze dried prior to the
analysis. The rate of muscle glycogen utilization (g min–1)
was calculated using 15 kg as an estimate of leg muscle
mass (Janssen et al. 2000).
Statistical analysis
Normality was tested using Shapiro-Wilk’s W test and
Levine’s test for equality of variance. Where normally
distributed, differences between groups were detected
using the independent t test. Where not normally
distributed, the Mann–Whitney U test was used. Two-way
ANOVA for repeated measures was used to determine
differences in substrate oxidation rates, substrate and
hormone concentrations and muscle glycogen content.
Where a significant interaction effect was detected,
further statistical analysis was performed using Tukey’s
honestly significant post hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed
using Statistica, version 12 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA).
Results
Participant and dietary characteristics
As intended, the two groups were well matched for
age, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, PPO and ˙
VO2max
(Table 1). The macronutrient composition of the diets
during the 3 days prior to the experimental trial was 21%
protein, 72% fat and 7% carbohydrate in the LCHF group
and 16% protein, 33% fat and 51% carbohydrate in the
mixed diet group. The LCHF group averaged between 15

rate of GNG during exercise (2.8 ± 0.4 mg kg−1 min−1

although the fractional contribution of GNG to EGP was
significantly higher in the LCHF group compared to the
mixed diet group (0.47 ± 0.05 LCHF; 0.32 ± 0.03 Mixed;
P = 0.04). Rates of hepatic GLY (3.2 ± 0.6 mg kg−1 min−1

(Fig. 3B) during exercise were significantly lower in the

(6.4 ± 1.0 mg kg−1 min−1 LCHF; 8.2 ± 1.0 mg kg−1 min−1

Muscle glycogen
Pre-exercise muscle glycogen content was 1.8-fold greater

(P < 0.01), although no difference was detected between
groups at the end of exercise (P = 0.98) (Fig. 5). Both
groups had a significant reduction in muscle glycogen

rate of utilization was significantly lower in the LCHF
group (0.06±0.03vs.0.15±0.04gkg−1 wetweightmin–1,

utilization rate of 1.0 ± 0.4 g min−1 in the LCHF group
and 2.2 ± 0.7 g min−1 in the mixed diet group (P < 0.01)
over the course of the exercise trial, assuming an active

(P < 0.01) (Fig. 6). Total EGP could provide 42 ± 16
% of glucose oxidation requirements during exercise in
the LCHF group, which is significantly higher than the
20 ± 6 % estimated for the mixed diet group (P < 0.01).
The difference between the rates of total glucose oxidation
(measured using indirect calorimetry) and EGP towards
the end of the ride is similar to the average rates of

Glucose production during low carbohydrate exercise
4399
Discussion
The present study is the first to report rates of EGP and
GNG during exercise in athletes on a LCHF diet and the
first to quantify total GNG during endurance exercise
in trained athletes using the deuterium oxide method.
The main finding was that there was no difference in
the absolute rates of GNG during exercise between fasted
cyclists who habitually ate a LCHF diet and those who ate a
mixed diet. Conversely, the rates of EGP were significantly
higher in the mixed diet group and this was attributable
entirely to their greater rates of hepatic GLY.
Glucose production at rest
Our glucose production results prior to exercise are in
agreement with a short-term but well-controlled diet
intervention study by Bisschop et al. (2000), which found
that resting GNG was relatively stable across a wide range
of carbohydrate and fat intakes, whereas GLY was variable
and positively associated with carbohydrate intake. Using
a similar tracer methodology to that of the present study,
their rates of GNG were 1.1 mg kg−1 min−1 after 11 days
on the LCHF diet, which was slightly but significantly
higher than after either a mixed or high carbohydrate
diet (�1.0 mg kg−1 min−1) (Bisschop et al. 2000). These
values are very similar to those of the present study;
however, we did not observe a significant difference
between groups. After the LCHF diet, participants in
the study by Bisschop et al. (2000) had EGP rates of
1.8 mg kg−1 min−1 compared to 2.1 mg kg−1 min−1
after the mixed diet. These values are also similar to
the corresponding groups from the present study, which
had resting EGP rates of 1.6 and 2.0 mg kg−1 min−1,
respectively.ThissuggeststhatreductionsinEGPprobably
occur soon after restricting dietary carbohydrate and this
effect is probably not influenced by long-term adaptation
to a LCHF diet or with endurance training. These results
also support the findings of Nuttall et al. (2008) who
reported that the rate of GNG in healthy individuals at rest
is relatively stable across a wide range of dietary conditions
and that changes in EGP because of dietary status are
mainly a result of differences in GLY.
Glucose production during exercise
The finding that GNG was similar between groups during
exercisewassomewhatsurprisingbecauseithasoftenbeen
speculated that LCHF athletes would rely primarily on
newly synthesized glucose from fat- and protein-derived
precursors (Volek et al. 2015). One possible explanation is
that, because hepatic blood flow is reduced at increasing
exercise intensities (Rowell et al. 1964), reduced hepatic
blood flow at 72% of ˙
VO2max in the present study may
have limited GNG to a similar degree in both groups. This
is supported by the finding that GNG can be increased
under conditions of hyperlactatemia, although only at
an exercise intensity below the lactate threshold (Emhoff
et al. 2013). Alternatively, the combined availability of
gluconeogenic substrates, whether from lactate, glycerol
or amino acids, may have been similar between groups,
which led to similar rates of GNG. Catabolism of muscle
glycogen is considered the primary source of plasma
lactate (Jacobs, 1981; Hagberg et al. 1982) and therefore
the mixed diet group, with their greater muscle glycogen
utilization, would have had a greater lactate flux through
the circulation. Conversely, the LCHF athletes probbaly
would have had a greater release of glycerol from lipolysis
of I.M. triglyceride (Zderic et al. 2004), plasma very low
densitylipoproteinsandadiposetissuetriglycerides(Helge
et al. 2001). Therefore, despite similar rates of GNG, LCHF
athletes would probably have derived a greater proportion
of their newly synthesized glucose from glycerol, whereas
the mixed diet athletes would have derived a greater
proportion from lactate.
Inthemixeddietgroupofthepresentstudy,theabsolute
rate of GNG from all precursors was 2.5 mg kg−1 min−1
during minutes 90 to 120 of cycling at 72% ˙
VO2max.
As expected, this was higher than reported previously
(1.7 and 1.9 mg kg−1 min−1) when only lactate-derived
GNG was determined under similar exercise and dietary
conditions (Emhoff et al. 2013). Of note, rates of EGP
in our mixed diet group were consistent with the
study by Emhoff et al. (2013). Their method used a
[3-13C]-lactate tracer, which would also include glucose
derived from metabolites in equilibrium with lactate,
such as pyruvate and alanine but not glycerol or other
amino acids (Emhoff et al. 2013). Therefore, even though
lactate is considered the primary precursor for GNG
during exercise (Ahlborg et al. 1974; Consoli et al. 1990;
Wolfe, 1992), measuring glucose production from only
lactate may considerably underestimate the rate of total
GNG. This underestimation may be even larger in LCHF
athletes or during prolonged low intensity exercise, in
which fat oxidation rates are higher and glycerol may
contribute a greater proportion of gluconeogenic sub-
strates. In another study by Trimmer (2002), the rates
of total GNG were only 1.25 mg kg−1 min−1 and EGP
was 6.0 mg kg−1 min−1 after 60 min of cycling at
65% ˙
VO2max. Therefore, GNG contributed only �21%
towards EGP, unlike the present study in which GNG
contributed 32% (Mixed) and 46% (LCHF) towards
EGP. Trimmer (2002) used mass isotopomer distribution
analysis (MIDA) from a [2-13C]-glycerol precursor to
estimates the contributions to GNG from all precursors
(Wolfe, 1992) and a [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer to measure
EGP, and so it is unclear why absolute and relative rates
of GNG were so much lower than the mixed diet cyclists
in the current and previous studies (Emhoff et al. 2013).
However, the validity of MIDA for this application has
C

been questioned (Landau et al. 1995; Previs et al. 1995;
Previs et al. 1999). Additionally, direct comparison of
methods in resting post-absorptive individuals has shown
that the [2-13C]-glycerol MIDA method produced GNG
rates 50% lower than that of a deuterium oxide method
similar to the one used in the present study (Ackermans
et al. 2001). The present study and that of Emhoff et al.
(2013) provide further evidence that the MIDA method
may underestimate total rates of GNG.
It is important to consider that, in all of the studies
discussed above, glucose production was determined after
a 12–14 h fast and after a period of exercise when hepatic
glycogen content would have been partially depleted
(Nilsson&Hultman,1973).Becauseliverglycogencontent
is acutely sensitive to carbohydrate ingestion (Nilsson &
Hultman, 1973) and LCHF adaptation decreases oxidative
and up-regulates non-oxidative (storage) glucose disposal
pathways (Cutler et al. 1995; Bisschop et al. 2001), the
mixed diet group would probably have experienced a
greater drop in hepatic glycogen content during this
period. Therefore, the difference in GLY (and EGP)
between groups would have been greater at the start of
exercise or early in the post-absorptive period. Even so,
an unexpectedly large proportion of EGP in the LCHF
group was derived from liver glycogen (3.2 mg kg−1 min−1
or �50%). The probable source of this hepatic glycogen
is the GNG of dietary and endogenous substrates at
rest. This is supported by the findings of Bisschop et al.
(2000) who reported that significant rates of hepatic GLY
(0.6 mg kg−1 min−1) can be sustained under resting
conditions, despite severe dietary carbohydrate restriction
(Bisschop et al. 2000). In the present study, participants
performed a light recovery ride followed by a rest day
on the 2 days in between the familiarization and main
exercise trials. The effect of these rest days on hepatic
glycogen storage in the LCHF group is not clear because
hepatic glycogen repletion in adapted LCHF athletes
has not been measured during recovery from exercise.
Nevertheless, we show that, after long-term adaptation to
a LCHF diet, liver glycogen in rested athletes makes a sub-
stantial contribution towards EGP during prolonged high
intensity exercise.
Hormonal regulation of EGP and substrate
metabolism
The
role
of
insulin
in
regulating
GNG
remains
controversial because it has been reported to suppress
GNG according to Klover & Mooney (2004) but has
little effect according to Nuttall et al. (2008). In both
our experimental groups, serum insulin concentrations
decreased as exercise progressed and were slightly lower
in the LCHF group compared to the mixed diet group
(Fig. 3C). However, the largest absolute difference between
groups was only 1.5 U l−1, which is likely too small to
be of physiological significance. Furthermore, during the
period when EGP and GNG were measured, there was
no difference in serum insulin concentrations between
groups. We also found no difference between groups in
plasmaglucagonconcentrationsorintheinsulin/glucagon
ratio during the last 30 min of exercise. Although we
did not measure blood catecholamine concentrations,
eating a LCHF diet does not appear to drastically
alter epinephrine concentrations (Helge et al. 1996;
Bisschop et al. 2000) but has been reported to increase
norepinephrine concentrations and exercising heart rate
compared to a control diet (Jansson & Kaijser, 1982; Helge
et al. 1996). Although the precise role of these hormones in
regulating hepatic glucose production in the present study
is not clear, the similar hormonal milieu between groups
may have accounted for the similar rates of GNG.
Whole body fat and carbohydrate oxidation
A number of short-term intervention studies (5 days to
8 weeks) have shown that a LCHF diet rapidly reduces
the RER during submaximal exercise, which reflects an
increase in fat and a reduction in carbohydrate oxidation
(Phinney et al. 1983; Lambert et al. 1994; Goedecke et al.
1999; Rowlands & Hopkins, 2002). In most cases in which
exercise was performed at 65–75% ˙
VO2max, rates of fat
oxidation double from �0.5 g min−1 during the control
diet, to �1.0 g min−1 after a LCHF intervention. Although
there was a gradual increase in fat oxidation towards the
end of exercise in the mixed diet group, the LCHF group
consistentlyoxidizedfatatarateof1.2gmin−1 throughout
the ride. A similar trend was seen in elite ultra-distance
runners who had followed a LCHF diet for longer than
9 months (Volek et al. 2016). Surprisingly, the rates of
fat oxidation after long-term LCHF adaptation are only
marginally higher than those of shorter-term studies at
similar exercise intensities (Cameron-Smith et al. 2003).
However, when an incremental exercise protocol was
used specifically to determine the rate and intensity
of maximal fat oxidation, the long-term LCHF-adapted
runners oxidized fat at 1.54 g min−1 at a relative running
intensity of 70.3 % ˙
VO2max (Volek et al. 2016), both of
which are considerably higher than had been reported
previously.
The rate of carbohydrate oxidation in the mixed
diet group was more than double that of the LCHF
group throughout the entire 2 h exercise session. This
is consistent with greater use of muscle and liver glycogen
and a greater plasma glucose uptake (Rd) in athletes
eating the mixed diet. Consequently, GNG contributed
a much greater proportion towards the carbohydrate
requirements of the LCHF group (20% LCHF; 7% Mixed),
even though both groups had similar rates of absolute
GNG. Muscle GLY presumably accounts for the shortfall
between total glucose oxidation and EGP in these fasted

athletes. Interestingly, the mixed diet group retained
high carbohydrate and low fat oxidation rates at the
end of exercise despite low but similar muscle (and
presumably liver) glycogen stores as the LCHF group.
This trend underlies the arguments both for and against
LCHF diets as a tool to enhance endurance performance.
On the one hand, LCHF athletes potentially have a
metabolic and performance advantage during prolonged
low-to-moderate intensity exercise once endogenous
carbohydrate stores are largely reduced (Lambert et al.
1994).Ontheotherhand,itisuncleartowhatextentLCHF
athletes are able to sustain high-intensity exercise in the
face of reduced starting muscle glycogen and carbohydrate
oxidation rates (Havemann et al. 2006; Stellingwerff et al.
2006). Further research is required to assess the role
of fat oxidation during high intensity exercise in LCHF
athletes. In addition, the role of muscle glycogen and
muscle glycogen kinetics requires further investigation in
adapted LCHF athletes. By contrast to the findings of the
present study, as well as previous studies (Phinney et al.
1983; Lambert et al. 1994), a recent investigation by Volek
(2016) found no difference in muscle glycogen content
pre-, post- and 120 min post-exercise between long-term
LCHF and high-carbohydrate adapted athletes. This was
despite much lower rates of carbohydrate oxidation in the
LCHF group.
Diet
The ability of the ‘keto-adapted’ brain to utilize ketones
as an alternate fuel to glucose is considered to be integral
for any therapeutic and potential performance advantage
of the ketogenic diet (Paoli et al. 2013). In one of the
earliest studies to investigate exercise metabolism during
nutritional ketogenesis, Phinney (1983) used a 4 week
well-controlled diet, which contained 85% of calories
as fat and 15% as protein, to raise resting plasma βHB
concentrations to 1.2 mmol l−1. The LCHF group in the
present study consumed �50 g day−1 of carbohydrate
(7% of calories), which was sufficiently low to induce a
moderate state of nutritional ketosis with resting βHB
concentrationsof0.8mmoll–1.Itremainstobedetermined
to what extent ketones are an important fuel for muscular
energy production in these athletes and their impact on
endurance performance.
Despite
initially
attempting
to
recruit
control
participants who ate more than 65% of their calories
as carbohydrate, our mixed diet group only consumed
an average of 394 g day−1 of carbohydrate (51%
of calories). Competitive endurance athletes are often
advised to consume in the region of 8–10 g kg−1 day−1 of
carbohydrate(Coyle,1991),yetthemixeddietparticipants
in the present study ate only 5.5 g kg−1 day−1. Although
this level of carbohydrate was sufficient to inhibit fat
oxidation rates compared to the LCHF group, a truly
high-carbohydrate group may have had even lower fat
oxidation rates and a greater use of carbohydrate during
exercise. Protein intake was similar between groups, which
is consistent with recommendations that individuals
on a LCHF diet should replace carbohydrate with fat
rather than protein. PUFA consumption was also similar
between groups despite the LCHF group consuming
approximately double the amount of total fat, saturated
fat and MUFA than the mixed diet group. Generally,
advocates of LCHF diets promote saturated fat and
advise against the consumption of omega-6 fatty acids,
whereas conventional advice encourages the consumption
of PUFA rather than saturated fats (Hooper et al. 2001;
Jakobsen et al. 2009). The dietary fat profile of our LCHF
participants therefore reflects the LCHF advice that has
been broadcasted by the media in South Africa for the
past 2–3 years.
Limitations
The present study comprised a cross-sectional study of
athletes who had voluntarily chosen their respective diets.
Therefore, it is possible that participants in the LCHF
group were drawn towards their diet because they were
particularly suited to it. Conversely, it is possible that
those in the mixed diet group chose not to follow a
LCHF diet because they were unsuited to it. Prospective
randomized controlled dietary intervention studies would
help corroborate the findings of the present study.
The use of any tracer technique for metabolic
research requires certain assumptions and will have
potential errors. The [6,6-2H2]-glucose dilution and
average deuterium enrichment from 2H2O methods were
chosen because they are well validated and are currently
considered to be the most appropriate approaches
for assessing EGP and fractional GNG, respectively
(Chacko et al. 2008; Chung et al. 2015). Both methods
assume that near steady-state isotopic enrichment was
reached. The [6,6-2H2]-glucose infusion, blood sampling
and exercise protocol that we used is similar to that
validated previously (Febbraio et al. 2004) and achieved
approximate isotopic equilibrium (data not shown).
[6,6-2H2]-glucose is also considered a non-recyclable
tracer. When the [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer undergoes
degradation during glycolytic pathways, the deuteriums
on C-6 are mostly lost and undetectable, before being
recycled up via the gluconeogenic pathway (Chung et al.
2015). Furthermore, because both labels are on the same
carbon of [6,6-2H2]-glucose, any potential recycling of
infused tracer (M+2 in this instance) will not interfere
with the GNG measurement (M+1) (Chacko et al. 2008).
Recently, it was reported that the 2H2O C5-HMT method
might overestimate GNG as a result of transaldalose
exchange of the bottom carbons of fructose-6-phosphate
(Browning & Burgess, 2012). By assessing the average

incorporation of deuterium on multiple glucose carbons,
any potential error that results in inequality between the
top and bottom half of glucose (if real) will probably
be reduced (Chung et al. 2015). Furthermore, it has
been shown that measured fractional GNG in overnight
fasted individuals (similar to that used in the present
study) was comparable when using the average deuterium
incorporation method and the 13C-NMR method, which
is not influenced by transaldolase exchange (Chung et al.
2015).
Participants were tested after a 14 h fast to simplify
interpretation of the stable isotope tracer results and to be
consistent with previous studies that investigated glucose
kinetics during exercise (Trimmer et al. 2002; Emhoff
et al. 2013). However, nutrient ingestion, and in particular
carbohydrate ingestion, has profound effects on glucose
production during exercise (Jeukendrup et al. 1999)
and endurance athletes, particularly those on a mixed
macronutrient diet, would usually ingest carbohydrate
containing foods in the hours before and during exercise.
Caution is required when interpreting these results in
the context of normal exercising conditions. Additional
studies that investigate glucose production kinetics in the
fed state are therefore warranted.
The nutrients consumed in the days (and particularly
the day) before the experimental trial would have had
the most important impact on the glucose production
results. We are confident that the 3 day diet record
provides an accurate estimate of dietary intake during this
period (reported data). However, accurate estimates of
past habitual diets are notoriously difficult to determine.
Although considerable effort was made to only select
participants whose diet history we could trust, we cannot
be certain that participants had truthfully followed a strict
LCHF diet, or a mixed macronutrient diet, for the entire
period that they specified. However, because there were
no differences between the two 3 day diet records and
these were consistent with the food frequency and diet
history questionnaires, the reported diet data probably
provide a reasonable reflection of past habitual diets.
Although food was not provided for the participants, the
extensive participant-investigator interaction during the
testing period helped to ensure that participants adhered
to their respective diets, particularly on the evening prior
to the experiment.
The use of indirect calorimetry and stoichiometric
equations is widely accepted as a valid technique for
estimating whole body substrate utilization during sub-
maximal exercise. It assumes that additional metabolic
processes that consume oxygen or produce carbon
dioxide are quantitatively negligible. Gluconeogenesis
from alanine, lipogenesis and ketogenesis can alter the
RER if their products are stored rather than oxidized
(Frayn, 1983; Jeukendrup & Wallis, 2005). Although these
processes are potentially different between the groups
in the present study, their effect on substrate utilization
calculations during exercise at 72% ˙
VO2max is probably
too small to significantly influence the reported results
(Jeukendrup & Wallis, 2005). Figure 6 was used to
contextualize the glucose kinetics findings but has a
number of limitations. First, the absolute rate of muscle
glycogenuse(gmin–1)shouldbetreatedasanapproximate
estimate because the mass of active skeletal muscle during
cyclingat72% ˙
VO2max wasassumedtobe15kg.Second,the
average rate of muscle glycogen use over the 2 h ride was
calculated from pre- and post-exercise muscle biopsies. It
is unclear how this rate might have changed as exercise
progressed and it may not reflect the actual rates during
the final 30 min of exercise when glucose production was
measured.
Summary and conclusions
Although there were profound differences in whole body
fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates between fasted
athletes on either a LCHF or mixed macronutrient diet,
we found no difference in the rates of total GNG at rest
or during exercise. However, the rates of EGP at rest
and during exercise were greater in the mixed diet group
compared to the LCHF group and this was entirely a result
of higher rates of GLY. Even though plasma lactate and
serum glycerol concentrations were fairly similar between
groups, we would suggest that the LCHF group derived
more hepatic glucose from glycerol than the mixed diet
group, whereas the mixed diet group derived more glucose
from lactate than the LCHF group. The exact proportions
of glycerol to lactate derived GNG in these groups and the
effect of feeding prior to and during exercise, requires
further investigation. We conclude that rates of GNG
during exercise after an overnight fast are relatively stable
across a broad range of habitual diets that can significantly
alter substrate utilization, although GLY and therefore
EGP are influenced by dietary carbohydrate.
