In Brief
Crowley et al. demonstrate that kappa
opioid receptors (KORs) in the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)
inhibit pathway-specific glutamate
transmission and show optogenetic
control of dynorphin release in the BNST.
The findings indicate that the basolateral
amygdala (BLA), BNST, and KORs are
important for the control of anxiety-
related behaviors.

SUMMARY
Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are involved in a va-
riety of aversive behavioral states, including anxiety.
To date, a circuit-based mechanism for KOR-driven
anxiety has not been described. Here, we show that
activation of KORs inhibits glutamate release from
basolateral amygdala (BLA) inputs to the bed nu-
cleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and occludes
the anxiolytic phenotype seen with optogenetic
activation of BLA-BNST projections. In addition,
deletion of KORs from amygdala neurons results in
an anxiolytic phenotype. Furthermore, we identify a
frequency-dependent, optically evoked local dynor-
phin-induced heterosynaptic plasticity of glutamate
inputs in the BNST. We also find that there is cell
type specificity to the KOR modulation of the BLA-
BNST input with greater KOR-mediated inhibition of
BLA dynorphin-expressing neurons. Collectively,
these results provide support for a model in which
local dynorphin release can inhibit an anxiolytic
pathway, providing a discrete therapeutic target for
the treatment of anxiety disorders.
INTRODUCTION
Anxiety disorders are a major health concern, with 7.3% of the
global population suffering from an anxiety disorder at any given
time (Baxter et al., 2013; Le
´ pine, 2002). Despite the high expense
of anxiety disorder treatments (Le
´ pine, 2002), many of the most
common treatments, including tricyclic antidepressants, mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors, have side effects that limit their utility
(Ravindran and Stein, 2010). In light of these limitations, there
has been a greater effort to discover new modulatory systems
for the treatment of anxiety disorders (Deisseroth, 2014; Holden,
2003; Johansen, 2013; Tye et al., 2011). To develop new
and more efficacious therapeutics, however, a more thorough
understanding of the circuitry underlying anxiety disorders is
required.
Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) have been proposed as a po-
tential target for stress and anxiety disorders, as well as sub-
stance abuse disorders (Wee and Koob, 2010). An abundance
of behavioral pharmacological experiments have shown the
anxiolytic effect of KOR antagonists are capable of overcoming
the anxiogenic effects of a chronic or acute stressor, ethanol
withdrawal, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and KOR ago-
nism (Bruchas et al., 2009; Knoll et al., 2007; Valdez and Harsh-
berger, 2012). Findings have implicated recruitment of KOR
signaling by its endogenous ligand dynorphin (Chavkin et al.,
1982) as playing a key role in preclinical and clinical models of
anxiety (Knoll et al., 2011); however, the mechanism that under-
lies this effect and the circuitry involved has not yet been defined
(Crowley and Kash, 2015). KOR modulation has been identified
in key anxiety-related regions such as the dorsal raphe nucleus
(Bruchas et al., 2010; Land et al., 2009), the ventral tegmental
area (Spanagel et al., 1992), and the prefrontal cortex (Svingos
and Colago, 2002; Tejeda et al., 2013). These regions interact
with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a key region
involved in anxiety-related behaviors (Kash, 2012); however,
thus far investigation of KORs in the BNST has been lacking.
In addition, the BNST is known to express preprodynorphin
(Poulin et al., 2009), and previous work from our lab has demon-
strated KOR modulation of GABAergic transmission in the BNST
2774
Cell Reports 14, 2774–2783, March 29, 2016 ª2016 The Authors
 (Li et al., 2012a). Together, these studies support the idea that
KORs in the BNST could be a promising and important target
for neuropsychiatric manipulations.
Based on the abundance of evidence implicating KORs in anx-
iety disorders, and the known role of the BNST in regulating anx-
iety-like behavior, we evaluated the role of KOR modulation of
glutamate transmission in the BNST. We also examined the abil-
ity of local BNST dynorphin neurons to heterosynaptically modu-
late glutamatergic transmission. Here, we report that KORs in the
BNST inhibit glutamatergic transmission on the basolateral
amygdala (BLA) but not the prefrontal cortex (PFC) inputs.
We also demonstrate alterations in anxiety-related behaviors
through complementary manipulations of KORs and this circuit.
Furthermore, we identify a technological approach to assessing
peptidergic transmission in slice.
RESULTS
KORs Signal via a Presynaptic, p38-, and
Calcium-Dependent Mechanism to Inhibit Glutamate
Release in the BNST
An extensive body of literature links glutamate signaling in the
BNST to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic behavior (Davis et al.,
2010; Hubert and Muly, 2014; Kim et al., 2013). Therefore, we
first examined whether KOR activation could alter glutamate
function in the BNST. We found that multiple KOR-selective ag-
onists (Dynorphin-A and U69,593) inhibited electrically-evoked
excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) in the BNST, both
of which were blocked by pre-application of the selective
KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) (Figures 1A–1D).
This KOR-mediated inhibition was not reversed by norBNI (Fig-
ures 1E and 1F), suggesting that this is a form of long-lasting
plasticity. We next assessed the intracellular signaling mecha-
nism of this KOR modulation, because KORs have been shown
to signal through both p38 (Bruchas et al., 2007) and MAPK/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase and extracellular signal-
regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK/ERK) (Li et al., 2012a). p38 signaling
in particular is necessary for the dysphoria associated with KOR
activation (Bruchas et al., 2007). The KOR agonist effect was
blocked in the presence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 but
not the MEK/ERK inhibitor SL-327 (Figure 1G) or the protein ki-
nase A (PKA) inhibitor RP-Camps (Figure 1H). Together, these
results suggest that KOR-mediated inhibition of glutamate
function in the BNST involves p38 but not MEK/ERK or PKA
signaling.
We next determined the impact of KOR agonists on minia-
ture excitatory synaptic transmission to more clearly under-
stand the mechanism of inhibition. KOR activation reduced
miniature EPSC frequency but not amplitude, with no alter-
ations in miniature EPSC kinetics (Figures 1I–1K). This KOR
modulation of mEPSCs was absent when recordings were
conducted in zero calcium conditions similar to those previ-
ously published (Figures 1L and 1M). Taken together, this
demonstrates a presynaptic, p38-, and calcium-dependent
form of glutamate inhibition, mechanistically similar to a form
of long-term depression (LTD) that has been seen in the dorsal
striatum following activation of opioid receptors (Atwood et al.,
2014).
KORs Inhibit Pathway-Specific Glutamate Inputs to the
BNST
Glutamatergic innervation to the BNST arises from multiple
cortical and subcortical nuclei (Dong et al., 2001; Kim et al.,
2013). We next probed KOR inhibition of two of these pathways,
the PFC and the BLA. We injected ChR2 (AAV2-CaMKIIa-ChR2-
eYFP) in either the BLA or PFC and conducted slice electrophys-
iology experiments in the BNST. Independent activation of these
pathways produced a robust, light-evoked EPSC, consistent with
other studies examining BLA projections (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013)
(Figures 2A–2C). The light-evoked BLA-BNST EPSC was in-
hibited by KOR activation, whereas the light-evoked PFC-BNST
EPSC not altered by KOR agonist (Figure 2D), demonstrating
that KOR modulation of glutamate transmission is pathway
specific. Optogenetic activation of the BLA input to the BNSTpro-
duced action potentials in BNST neurons reliably up to 20–40 Hz
(Figure 2E). Because we have shown that KOR activation can
inhibit GABA release (Li et al., 2012b), we wanted to test whether
activation of KOR signaling would lead to a net reduction of BLA-
inducedactionpotentials intheBNST. Consistent witha netinhib-
itory action of KOR on this pathway, the KOR agonist significantly
reduced the fidelity of these BLA-BNST-induced action poten-
tials. This demonstrates that presynaptic KORs show specificity
in inhibition of glutamate inputs in the BNST.
KORs Are Expressed Presynaptically and Modulate
BLA-BNST Anxiety-Related Behaviors
Next, we investigated the role of KORs in this pathway in vivo and
invitrousingageneticapproach.WeinjectedAAV5-CaMKIIa-Cre-
GFP (Cre) or AAV5-CaMKIIa-ChR2-eYFP (Control) into the amyg-
dala of conditional KOR knockout mice (Chefer et al., 2013) and
assessed changes in anxiety-related behavior (Figures 3A–3C).
Viral deletion of KORs expressed on amygdala neurons resulted
in an increase in elevated plus maze (EPM) open arm time (Fig-
ure 3C) with no alteration in total distance traveled (Figure 3D). In
these experimentstargeting neuronsinthe BLA,therewas expres-
sion of the cre virus in both the CeA and adjacent cortex in subsets
of animals; however, the expression in these regions did not
correlate to any behavioral measures. In order to confirm the pre-
synaptic locus of KOR modulation at BLA-BNST synapses in vitro,
we injected a cocktail of CaMKIIa-ChR2-eYFP and CaMKIIa-Cre-
GFP into the BLA of KOR KO mice. This approach deletes KORs
expressed on amygdalar neurons, while simultaneously allowing
us to optogenetically activate this specific circuit in slice electro-
physiologyexperiments.KOR-mediatedinhibitionofthe BLA input
was absent when KORs were genetically deleted from the BLA
(Figure 3E). Together, this confirms that KORs are expressed
presynaptically on BLA neurons, and demonstrates that deletion
of amygdala KORs results in an anxiolytic phenotype.
To further understand the role of BNST KORs in anxiety-
related behavior, we next probed this system using in vivo opto-
genetics (Figure 3F). Optogenetic activation of the BLA-BNST
pathway produced a robust anxiolytic effect in the open field,
replicating the effects found by others (Kim et al., 2013).
Following administration of a sub-anxiogenic dose of the KOR
agonist U50,488 (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]), activation of
the BLA-BNST-induced anxiolytic phenotype, as well as loco-
motor behavior, was reduced as compared to control mice

2775
 (Figures 3G–3I). Together, these complementary behavioral ap-
proaches demonstrate that, globally, KORs are an important
regulator of the BLA-BNST anxiety circuit, and that BLA KORs
are critically involved in anxiogenic behavior.
Dynorphin Is a Heterosynaptic Messenger in the BNST,
and Dynorphin Neurons Are Preferentially Modulated by
KORs on BLA to BNST Synapses
Finally, we assessed the capacity of dynorphin neurons in the
BNST to release dynorphin following optogenetic stimulation.
We stereotaxically injected ChR2 using a Cre-dependent vector
(AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-EYFP) in the BNST of Preprodynorphin-
IRES-Cre mice (Al-Hasani et al., 2015; Krashes et al., 2014).
Dynorphin-positive (DYN+) neurons were located throughout
the dorsal-lateral BNST (Figure 4A). Light activation of these cells
reliably produced action potentials up to 20 Hz and resulted in a
monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC; mean =
422.9, SEM = 149.0), but no EPSC (mean = �17.64, SEM =
6.414) (Figure 4B) onto neighboring, putatively non-dynorphin
(DYN�) neurons, indicating BNST DYN+ neurons form robust

(B) KOR activation by U69,593 inhibited eEPSC amplitude (red circles, paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 30.70, p < 0.001) and was blocked by
continuous application of the KOR antagonist norBNI, 100 nM (yellow circles, paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 0.003, p > 0.05); the KOR agonist
U69,593 significantly inhibited eEPSC amplitude as compared to the norBNI block effect (unpaired t test, acsf versus norBNI, min 16–20, t8 = 10.22, p < 0.001).
(C) Representative experiment demonstrating KOR inhibition by 300 nM Dynorphin-A.
(D) KOR activation by 300 nM Dynorphin-A produces a robust inhibition of eEPSCs (red circles, paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 18.65, p < 0.001) that
is blocked by the KOR antagonist norBNI (yellow circles, paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 2.783, p = 0.05) mimicking the results seen with U69,593
(Figure 1B).
(E and F) Both U69,593 (E) and Dynorphin-A (F) activation of KORs are nonreversible forms of inhibition. Post-U69,593 application of the KOR antagonist norBNI
(100 nm) failed to reverse the inhibition by either KOR agonist (U69,593, paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 13.88, p < 0.001; Dynorphin-A, paired t test,
baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 14.30, p < 0.001).
(G) The p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 mM) but not the MEK/ERK inhibitor SL-327 (20 mM) blocked KOR-mediated inhibition of eEPSCs (SB203580 effect, baseline
versus min 16–20, t4 = 2.619, p > 0.05; SL-327 effect, baseline versus min 16–20, t4 = 14, p < 0.0001).
(H) The PKA inhibitor RpCamps (5 mM) does not alter eEPSC amplitude (paired t test, baseline versus min 16–20, t4 = 10, p = 0.0004).
(I) Representative mEPSC traces (top and bottom) pre- (left) and post- (right) U69,593 application, conducted in 500 nM TTX and 5 mM picrotoxin. No significant
changes in mEPSC decay kinetics were seen (not shown, paired t test, t6 = 0.8170, p > 0.1).
(J and K) mEPSC frequency (J) (paired t test, t5 = 5.567, p < 0.001) but not amplitude (K) (paired t test, t5 = 0.2141, p > 0.1) was reduced following application of the
KOR agonist U69,593. Raw values for mEPSC frequency (not shown, baseline frequency mean = 3.406, SEM = 3.475; post-U69,593 frequency mean = 2.179,
SEM = 1.118) and amplitude (not shown, baseline amplitude mean = �29.36, SEM = 1.944, post-U69,593 amplitude mean = �25.71, SEM = 1.465).
(L and M) This inhibition is abolished in zero calcium aCSF, where both frequency (L) (paired t test, t5 = 1.959, p > 0.05) and amplitude (M) (paired t test, t5 = 2.017
p > 0.05) of mEPSCs remain unaltered by U69,593.

whether optogenetic activation of these DYN+ neurons was
capable of altering electrically evoked glutamate release within
the BNST. A 5 Hz activation of DYN+ neurons for 150 s produced

of
eEPSCs (Figure 4C); however, the EPSC amplitude returned to
baseline within minutes. A 20 Hz stimulation for 150 s produced
a robust and lasting inhibition of eEPSCs (Figure 4D); this inhibi-
tion was blocked by pre-application of the selective KOR antag-
onist norBNI. This effect was indistinguishable from that seen
with KOR agonist application (Figures 1A–1D). This effect was
not seen when an identical approach was performed assessing
a GABAergic dynorphin projection to the BNST from the para-
ventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) (Figure 4E).

an inhibition of eEPSCs, but this inhibition
was not KOR-dependent, suggesting that
another modulatory system may be play-
ing a role in this distal inhibition by dynor-
phin
neurons
(Bodnar,
2013).
Taken
together, these experiments demonstrate
that activation of local BNST dynorphin
neurons can inhibit electrically evoked
glutamatergic transmission in the BNST.
Additionally, these experiments suggest
a possible timing-dependent component in the persistence of
KOR plasticity, similar to what has been demonstrated with
norepinephrine-induced LTD in the BNST (McElligott and
Winder, 2008).
Next, we assessed the relationship between BLA inputs to
the BNST and BNST dynorphin neurons. To assess the BLA
inputs onto DYN+ and DYN� neurons separately, ChR2
(AAV2-CaMKIIa-ChR2-eYFP) was injected into the BLA and a
cre-dependent fluorophore (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-mCherry) was in-
jected into the BNST of Preprodynorphin-IRES-Cre mice (Fig-
ure 4F). DYN+ neurons had smaller membrane resistance than
their DYN� counterparts, and a trend toward significant differ-
ences in cell capacitance (Figures S1A and S1B), consistent
with known classifications of BNST neuron types (Hammack
et al., 2007). DYN� neurons had more action potentials per

(C) Cre mice showed significantly greater open arm time compared to Control mice (unpaired t test, Cre versus ChR2, t14 = 2.215, p < 0.05).
(D) No differences in total distance traveled were seen (unpaired t test, Cre- versus ChR2, t14 = 0.4226, p > 0.05).
(E) Deletion of KORs from BLA neurons prevented the KOR-mediated inhibition of BLA-BNST synapses, confirming that KORs act pre-synaptically to inhibit
evoked glutamate release. Mice were injected with ChR2 (AAV2-CaMKIIa-ChR2-eYFP) and Cre (AAV2-CaMKII-Cre-GFP) into the BLA, and light-evoked EPSCs
were recorded in the BNST. U69,593 no longer inhibited light-evoked EPSCs (paired t test, baseline versus min. 16–20, t4 = 1.474, p > 0.1). Top, representative
traces from before (black) and after (grey) U69,593 application.

BNST. Following ample time for virus to express, experiments were conducted. Bottom: representative injection of ChR2 into the BLA, and fiber placement in the
BNST. Scale bar represents 100 mM.
(G) A 2-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of drug (F1,31 = 22.28, p < 0.001) as well as an interaction between drug and ChR2 (F1,31 = 5.210, p < 0.05) on
number of entries into the center of the open field. Tukey’s multiple comparisons showed a significant decrease of entries into the center in ChR2-U50 mice as
compared to ChR2-Saline mice (p < 0.05).
(H) A 2-way ANOVA revealed a trend toward a ChR2 effect (F1,38 = 3.606, p = 0.06) and interaction between ChR2 and drug (F1,38 = 3.097, p = 0.08) on amount of
time spent in the center of the open field. Based on the previous findings, our planned comparisons revealed a significant increase amount of time spent in the
center of the open field of ChR2-Saline mice as compared to eYFP-Saline mice (t17 = 3.034, p < 0.01) and ChR2-U50 mice as compared to ChR2-Saline mice
(t18 = 2.178, p < 0.05), indicating that although ChR2 activation of BLA-BNST neurons produced an anxiolytic effect, this was blocked by the KOR agonist
U50,488. In addition, changes in locomotor behavior were seen in ChR2-U50 and eYFP-U50 mice (data not shown). A 2-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect
of U50,488 treatment on overall activity (F1,30 = 53.91, p < 0.0001). Tukey’s post hoc tests showed that eYFP-U50 mice showed significantly decreased overall
locomotor activity as compared to eYFP-saline mice (p < 0.05). Similarly, as expected, ChR2-U50 mice showed significant decreased overall locomotor as
compared to ChR2-saline controls (p < 0.05).

Inhibit Glutamate Release onto DYN+ Neurons
(A) Localization of DYN+ neurons in the BNST. DYN+ cells were found throughout the dorsal BNST in a Dyn-L10-EGFP reporter mouse.
(B) Left: local dynorphin cells showed reliable light-evoked action potentials at 20 Hz. These cells synapsed locally, producing a light-evoked IPSC of approx-
imately 423 pA, but no light-evoked EPSC.
(C) 5 Hz stimulation of DYN+ neurons produced a significant transient change in eEPSC amplitude (paired t test, baseline versus min. 5–8, t4 = 6.033, p < 0.05),
which returned to baseline (paired t test, baseline versus min 11–15, t4 = 2.474, p > 0.05).
(D) 20 Hz stimulation of local DYN+ neurons produces a significant and lasting inhibition of eEPSC (paired t test, baseline versus min 11–15, t4 = 10.42, p < 0.001).
This effect is partially blocked by norBNI (unpaired t test acsf versus norBNI block, min 16–20, t8 = 10.59, p < 0.0001).
(E) 20 Hz optogenetic stimulation of PVN to BNST DYN+ neurons produces a significant inhibition of eEPSC (paired t test, baseline versus min 11–15, t4 = 8.566,
p < 0.001) but this was not significantly different from the inhibition seen when in the presence of the KOR antagonist norBNI (unpaired t test, acsf+picrotoxin
versus norBNI block, t8 = 1.191, p > 0.1).
(F) Mice were injected with a cre-inducible mCherry (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-mCherry) to the BNST, and ChR2 (AAV2-CaMKIIa-ChR2-EYFP) to the BLA. Optogenetic
activation of BLA-BNST DYN+ and DYN� neurons was then assessed.
(G) Application of the KOR agonist U69,593 significantly reduced the BLA-BNST eEPSC amplitude onto both DYN+ (paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25,
t4 = 12.14, p < 0.001) and DYN� neurons (paired t test, baseline versus min 21–25, t4 = 9.039, p < 0.001). However, the effect of KOR-mediated inhibition was
significantly larger on DYN+ neurons compared to DYN� neurons (unpaired t test, DYN+ min 21–25 versus DYN� 21–25, t8 = 7.071, p < 0.001), indicating KOR
activation in the BNST may preferentially inhibit BLA-DYN+ neurons.

 current injection when held at RMP, indicative of greater intrinsic
excitability (Figures S1C–S1K). Both DYN+ and DYN� neurons
received a glutamate projection from the BLA, as well as a poly-
synaptic GABAergic projection, but no basal differences were
seen with BLA innervation of these cells as indicated by similar
paired pulse ratio and amplitude of evoked responses (Figures
S2A–S2D). We next examined KOR modulation of BLA inputs
to these two discrete cell types. We found that KOR activation
more robustly inhibited BLA-induced eEPSCs in DYN+ neurons
compared to DYN� neurons (Figure 2G). Taken together, these
data suggest that there is both pathway- and cell-type depen-
dent modulation of glutamate function in the BNST by KOR, al-
lowing for important gating of glutamate transmission at DYN+
and DYN� neurons.
DISCUSSION
The BNST orchestrates both rewarding and aversive behaviors
(Jennings et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013). KORs have historically
been thought to modulate aversive (or negatively regulate
rewarding) systems (Chefer et al., 2005) or anxiety-related be-
haviors, although recent literature has shown that that the neuro-
anatomical location of KORs may be important in behavioral
effects seen with their activation. Castro and Berridge (2014)
demonstrated that activation of KORs in the nucleus accumbens
can mediate both conditioned place preference and conditioned
place aversion. This work was recently expanded upon when
Al-Hasani et al. (2015) demonstrated that activation of DYN+
neurons themselves in distinct subpopulations of the nucleus ac-
cumbens are responsible for rewarding or aversive behavioral
phenotypes and found that photo-activation of the aversive sub-
population of accumbens dynorphin neurons did not results in
anxiogenic behavior. The diversity in effects seen with KOR acti-
vation, coupled with the multitude of behavioral outcomes seen
with the BNST activation in this study, places KORs in the BNST
at the interesting and likely position of being able to modulate
anxiety-related behaviors. Furthermore, these results suggest
that KORs are poised to regulate negative affective behavioral
states (aversion) and anxiety via discrete brain subnuclei.
We demonstrate that KOR activation in the BNST inhibits glu-
tamatergic inputs by a presynaptic, p38-, and calcium- depen-
dent mechanism. Previous work has shown p38-dependent
effects of KOR modulation in other brain regions, such as the
dorsal raphe nucleus (Bruchas et al., 2011; Land et al., 2008;
Lemos et al., 2012), and others have postulated that this intracel-
lular signaling pathway may be critical for the dysphoric effects
of KOR agonists (Bruchas et al., 2007). In addition, previous
work by our lab demonstrated that KORs inhibit BNST
GABAergic transmission via MEK/ERK signaling (Li et al.,
2012a). We therefore show that KORs within the BNST are
capable of altering neurotransmitter transmission via pharmaco-
logically distinct mechanisms at different synapses. Differential
use of signaling pathways by KORs has been demonstrated in
the nucleus accumbens (Hjelmstad and Fields, 2003), and these
pharmacologically distinct signaling mechanisms may play a key
role in the development of functionally biased compounds.
Development or identification of biased ligands, capable of tar-
geting individual signaling pathways, may be useful in devel-
oping therapeutic treatments without the unpleasant side effects
seen with KOR activation (White et al., 2014).
Beyond a pharmacologically distinct mechanism of KOR inhi-
bition, we also demonstrate a pathway-specific inhibition of glu-
tamatergic inputs to the BNST. KORs inhibit BLA but not PFC
inputs to the BNST; this mechanism may provide for gating of in-
formation flow both to and from the BNST. Future work should
address other inputs to the BNST, including the multitude of in-
puts recently identified in the human brain (Avery et al., 2014). We
also demonstrate a mechanism by which KORs are activated:
GABAergic/dynorphin co-expressing neurons in the BNST
release dynorphin to presynaptically inhibit glutamate inputs to
the BNST. This signaling mechanism through which dynorphin
regulates transmission may be a common motif throughout the
brain; it was originally postulated to be the mechanism of inhibi-
tion in the hippocampus (Drake et al., 1994), and, more recently,
was shown to be the mechanism of inhibition in the PVN (Ire-
monger and Bains, 2009). We not only show similar findings in
the BNST, but also expand upon this literature by demonstrating
an optogenetic mechanism for activation of such release. This al-
lows for peptidergic and optogenetic coupling, greatly expand-
ing upon the ability to assess peptide release both in vitro and
in vivo.
In addition, we used complementary approaches to identify
behavioral changes in anxiety-related behaviors following ma-
nipulations of the KOR system. When KORs were genetically
deleted from BLA neurons using a viral cre approach coupled
with a floxed KOR mouse, we saw a decrease in anxiety-related
behavior in the EPM. Though other projections such as those to
the CeA and hippocampus are likely also important pathways in
this phenotype, the BLA-BNST pathway has been previously
demonstrated to be involved in anxiety-like behavior, as seen
by changes in EPM exploration (Kim et al., 2013). Therefore,
KORs are likely to be a key regulator of this pathway and pheno-
type. In a complementary series of experiments, we demon-
strated in vivo activation of BLA-BNST neurons produced a
robust anxiolytic phenotype (replicating the work by Kim et al.,
2013). Importantly, systemic activation of KORs occludes the
anxiolytic effect seen with BLA-BNST activation; although opto-
genetic activation of the BLA-BNST pathway can produce a
robust anxiolytic phenotype, this pathway is gated by the dynor-
phin/KOR system.
Importantly, we found this KOR inhibition exhibited both
cell-type and pathway-dependent differences in function.
Though BLA inputs to the BNST show similar properties
onto both DYN+ and DYN� neurons, there is a greater
KOR-mediated
inhibition
of
BLA-DYN+
synapses
versus
BLA-DYN� synapses. These results suggest a model in which
activation of the BNST by the BLA excites DYN+ neurons, and
this activation leads to a local retrograde release of dynorphin.
This dynorphin release then gates inputs to the BNST, poten-
tially providing a homeostatic balance within the system during
times of heightened activity, suggesting a mechanism by
which KOR antagonists exhibit anxiolytic actions. In addition,
this further illuminates the micro-circuitry of the BNST and
how it may coordinate such a broad range of behavioral
states, such as those involved in stress and addiction. Further-
more, this raises a strategy for development of anxiolytic

 compounds—blocking endogenous inhibitors of defined cir-
cuits that reduce anxiety.
Additional work is necessary to elucidate the downstream
effects of BNST dynorphin neurons. Specifically, an under-
standing is needed of their projection and activation patterns;
this is especially important in light of several recent findings
detailing various sub-domains in the BNST that are linked
with specific behaviors. This work provides an important
framework to begin that research; although the circuitry of
DYN+ and DYN� neurons may be equal, their activation and
inhibition may not be. Taken together, this work demonstrates
a pathway specific, p38-, and calcium- dependent form of
KOR inhibition of glutamate. It also demonstrates a mecha-
nism by which local dynorphin release may mediate this
presynaptic effect. Finally, this work shows that KORs may
preferentially inhibit glutamatergic inputs onto DYN+ neurons,
versus DYN� neurons, allowing for specific gating of informa-
tion flow. This circuit-based approach has numerous advan-
tages over existing approaches because it allows higher
precision in defining the substrate and mechanism of action.
Given the lack of efficacious and well-tolerated anxiolytic med-
ications currently available, this work introduces a site-specific
manipulation of the mammalian anxiety system.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
and the Animal Care and Use Committee of Washington University, conform-
ing to NIH guidelines. Experiments were performed on adult male C57BL/6J
mice and DBA/2J mice, both from Jackson Laboratory. In addition, Preprody-
norphin-IRES-Cre and R26-loxSTOPlox-L10-GFP (Al-Hasani et al., 2015;
Krashes et al., 2014), and Floxed KOR conditional knockout mice (Chefer
et al., 2013) were generated as described previously, and bred in house at
UNC. All mice were group housed in colony rooms with a 12:12 hr light-dark
cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.) with ad libitum access to rodent chow and water.
Slice Electrophysiology
Coronal sections containing the BNST (300 mM) were obtained from behavior-
ally naive mice rapidly decapitated under isoflurane. All experiments were con-
ducted in the dorsolateral portion of the BNST. Lidocaine N-ethyl bromide
(1 mg/ml) was included in the intracellular recording solution to prevent post-
synaptic sodium spikes for all voltage-clamp experiments. For basal KOR
pharmacological effects and characterization, picrotoxin (25 mM) was added
to aCSF to isolate EPSCs. Tetrodotoxin (500 nM) and picrotoxin (25 mM)
were added to the aCSF to isolate miniature EPSCs. Cells were held at
�70 mV to isolate AMPAR-mediated current (see the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures).
For in vitro optogenetic experiments, all brains were evaluated for light-
evoked action potentials in the injection region (BLA, PFC, PVN, or BNST)
using a potassium-gluconate-based internal recording solution. Brains were
discarded and not used for further experimentation if action potentials were
not obtained or injection sites were missed. A blue LED (470 nm, CoolLed)
was used to optically stimulate release from channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-
containing fibers (5 ms pulse for voltage-clamp experiments, 1 ms for current
clamp experiments).
Stereotaxic Surgery
Male mice were injected with viral constructs into regions of interest. A crani-
otomy was performed, and mice were bilaterally injected using a blunt needle
(86200 and 65458-01, Hamilton), with 400–500 nl of the vector into the BLA
(stereotaxic coordinates from bregma: �1.30 anterior-posterior, ±3.15
medial-lateral,�4.95 mm dorsal-ventral), 350 nl of the vector into the BNST
(stereotaxic
coordinates
from
bregma:
+0.27
anterior-posterior,
±0.90
medial-lateral, �4.25 dorsal-ventral), or 400–500 nl of the vector into the
PFC (stereotaxic coordinates from bregma: +1.8 anterior-posterior, ±0.3–0.5
medial-lateral, �2.5 dorsal-ventral). For floxed KOR slice electrophysiology
experiments, ChR2/CRE cocktail was prepared (250 nl ChR2, 250 nl CRE)
and injected into the BLA.
Mice were allowed to recover for at least 6 weeks before behavioral exper-
iments or electrophysiology (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Behavior
Anxiety-related behavioral assays were conducted as described previously
(Pleil et al., 2015). Briefly, in the first series of experiments, floxed KOR
knockout mice with either ChR2-eYFP or Cre-GFP injected in the BLA were
placed in the EPM for 5 minutes. For these experiments, a virus encoding
ChR2 was injected into control mice, but no in vivo illumination was used. In
the second series of experiments, mice with either ChR2-eYFP or eYFP in-
jected in the BLA with optical fibers in the BNST were systemically adminis-
tered either saline or a KOR agonist. Thirty minutes later, they were tested in
the open field.
Elevated Plus Maze
The EPM (Med Associates) was made of white-and-black plastic and con-
sisted of two open arms (75 3 7 cm) and two closed arms (75 3 7 3 25 cm)
adjoined by a central area (7 3 7 3 25 cm). The arms were arranged in a
plus configuration with arms of the same type (open or closed) opposite of
each other. The maze was elevated 75 cm with light levels maintained at 15
lux throughout the experiment. Mice were placed in the center of the EPM
and allowed to explore freely. The EPM was cleaned with 70% ethanol be-
tween each trial. Movements were video recorded and analyzed using Ethovi-
sion 9.0 (Noldus Information Technologies). The primary measures of reduced
anxiety-like behavior were time spent in the open arm and number of entries
into the open arm.
Open Field Test
Mice were injected with the KOR agonist U50,488 (5 mg/kg in saline, i.p.) or
vehicle control (saline) and returned to their home cage for 30 min. The open
field test was performed in a square enclosure (55 3 55 cm) with light levels
maintained at 25 lux. Mice were placed in the center of the open field and
allowed to roam freely for 21 min. Photostimulation alternated between off
and on states in 3 min time segments, beginning with 3 min of no stimulation.
For the photostimulated time segments, animals received 10 Hz (10 ms
width) photostimulation (�10 mW light power). The open field was cleaned
with 70% ethanol between each trial. Movements were video recorded and
analyzed using Ethovision 8.5 (Noldus Information Technologies, Leesburg,
VA). The center was defined as a square comprised of 50% the total area of
the open field test. Time in the center was the primary measure of anxiety-
like behaviors.
Histological Verification
Nissl staining was performed in cohorts of mice used for in vivo optogenetics
to confirm injections and fiber placements (see the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures).
