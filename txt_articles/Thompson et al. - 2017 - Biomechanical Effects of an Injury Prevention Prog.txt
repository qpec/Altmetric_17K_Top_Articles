Abstract
Background—Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common, and children as young as 
10 years of age exhibit movement patterns associated with an ACL injury risk. Prevention 
programs have been shown to reduce injury rates, but the mechanisms behind these programs are 
largely unknown. Few studies have investigated biomechanical changes after injury prevention 
programs in children.
Purpose/Hypothesis—To investigate the effects of the F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-
up program on changes to biomechanical risk factors for an ACL injury in preadolescent female 
soccer players. We hypothesized that the primary ACL injury risk factor of peak knee valgus 
moment would improve after training. In addition, we explored other kinematic and kinetic 
variables associated with ACL injuries.
Study Design—Controlled laboratory study.
Methods—A total of 51 female athletes aged 10 to 12 years were recruited from soccer clubs and 
were placed into an intervention group (n = 28; mean [±SD] age, 11.8 ± 0.8 years) and a control 
group (n = 23; mean age, 11.2 ± 0.6 years). The intervention group participated in 15 in-season 
sessions of the F-MARC 11+ program (2 times/wk). Pre- and postseason motion capture data were 
collected during preplanned cutting, unanticipated cutting, double-leg jump, and single-leg jump 
tasks. Lower extremity joint angles and moments were estimated using OpenSim, a biomechanical 
modeling system.
Results—Athletes in the intervention group reduced their peak knee valgus moment compared 
with the control group during the double-leg jump (mean [±standard error of the mean] pre- to 
posttest change, −0.57 ± 0.27 %BW×HT vs 0.25 ± 0.25 %BW×HT, respectively; P = .034). No

 significant differences in the change in peak knee valgus moment were found between the groups 
for any other activity; however, the intervention group displayed a significant pre- to posttest 
increase in peak knee valgus moment during unanticipated cutting (P = .044). Additional analyses 
revealed an improvement in peak ankle eversion moment after training during preplanned cutting 
(P = .015), unanticipated cutting (P = .004), and the double-leg jump (P = .016) compared with the 
control group. Other secondary risk factors did not significantly improve after training, although 
the peak knee valgus angle improved in the control group compared with the intervention group 
during unanticipated cutting (P = .018).
Conclusion—The F-MARC 11+ program may be effective in improving some risk factors for an 
ACL injury during a double-leg jump in preadolescent athletes, most notably by reducing peak 
knee valgus moment.
Clinical Relevance—This study provides motivation for enhancing injury prevention programs 
to produce improvement in other ACL risk factors, particularly during cutting and single-leg tasks.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common in athletes and often require surgery, 
followed by extensive rehabilitation. Estimates of the incidence of ACL injuries in soccer 
range from 0.06 to 3.7 per 1000 hours of active play (training and games).3,12 More than 
25% of soccer athletes who sustain an ACL injury do not return to their previous activity 
levels, and at 7 years after an ACL injury, 65% of players no longer play soccer.6 In 
recognition of these facts, several injury prevention programs have been developed and 
shown to reduce ACL injury rates in athletes.23,32,36 However, the mechanisms by which 
these programs reduce injury rates are unclear.
The ACL injury risk is multifactorial24 and includes anatomic, hormonal, neuromuscular, 
and biomechanical factors.1,24 Biomechanical and neuromuscular factors may be modifiable 
and provide the greatest potential for injury prevention. Peak knee valgus moment during 
landing has been shown to be the primary risk factor associated with noncontact ACL 
injuries.26 Video analysis of noncontact injuries also suggests a combination of hip 
adduction and internal rotation, knee valgus, tibial external rotation, and ankle eversion; 
together, these create “dynamic knee valgus” and increase the risk of ACL injuries.5,24,27 Of 
these measurements, increased frontal-plane ankle range of motion and joint moment have 
been shown to be related to an increased ACL injury risk during drop jumps and cutting in 
female athletes.15,16,29 Injury prevention programs attempt to modify biomechanical risk 
factors, with the assumption that they will improve after training, but most programs have 
not been systematically evaluated.
Female athletes are 2 to 9 times more likely to experience an ACL injury than male 
athletes,39,44 most of which (∼70%) occur by noncontact mechanisms.19,33,45 Compared 
with male athletes, adolescent female athletes exhibit greater normalized landing forces and 
loading rates and greater frontal-plane motion during cutting and jump-landing 
tasks.14,16,25,40 It is possible that the disparity between male and female athletes arises

 during puberty. While female athletes in late adolescence are at the greatest risk of injuries, 
the incidence of ACL injuries starts to increase between 10 and 12 years of age.17 Children 
as young as 10 years old demonstrate “risky” movement patterns during landing tasks,22,43 
which include decreased knee flexion and increased knee valgus.4,28 Training implemented 
in preadolescence may reduce the risk of injuries,35 but only a handful of studies have 
investigated changes in biomechanics after an injury prevention program in children younger 
than 13 years of age.9,10,18 A recent review of injury prevention programs in youth athletes 
concluded that the benefit of preventive exercises in children remains unknown.30
The F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-up program was developed with the aim of 
reducing the risk of injuries in soccer athletes.41 This program can be completed in less than 
30 minutes, requires minimal training to implement, and does not require any special 
equipment. Previous studies examining the effectiveness of the F-MARC 11+ program in 
adolescent male and female athletes have reported overall injury reductions as high as 
81%,20,31,41 although none specifically reported a reduction in ACL injuries. Furthermore, 
these studies did not investigate the biomechanical mechanisms underlying the program's 
success in reducing injuries. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the F-
MARC 11+ program reduces injury rates may aid in the development of more efficient and 
focused intervention programs that address specific injury risk factors.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the F-MARC 11+ injury 
prevention warm-up program on changes to biomechanical risk factors for an ACL injury in 
preadolescent female soccer players. We examined cutting and jump-landing tasks, which 
are associated with the majority of noncontact ACL injuries.4,12,13 For each of these 
activities, we hypothesized that the primary ACL injury risk factor of peak knee valgus 
moment would improve after the F-MARC 11+ program. Additionally, we explored and 
reported changes in other kinematic and kinetic variables associated with ACL injuries, 
particularly hip adduction, knee valgus, and ankle eversion angles and moments, all of 
which contribute to a “dynamic knee valgus” position.
Methods
Participants
Before testing, institutional review board approval was obtained, and written informed 
consent was acquired for 51 female soccer athletes between 10 to 12 years of age recruited 
from local area soccer club teams (Table 1). Exclusion criteria included a prior ACL injury, 
lower extremity surgery within the past year, a serious lower extremity injury within the past 
6 months (defined as an injury requiring more than 4 weeks of absence from participation in 
soccer activity), and prior or current participation in an ACL injury prevention program. A 
total of 28 players, from 2 separate soccer teams, participated in the laboratory testing 
component of the research study. On-field injury prevention training was completed by all 
athletes from both teams regardless of participation in the study. Athletes from 11 other 
teams served as a control and completed baseline laboratory testing (n = 23). There were no 
differences in height (P = .094) or mass (P = .136) between the intervention and control 
groups before testing, despite a small but significant 0.6-year age difference (P = .017).

 Preintervention Testing
The positions of 36 retroreflective markers were recorded at 200 Hz using an 8-camera 
optical motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corp) and were synchronized with 
measurements from 3 floor-mounted force plates collected at 2000 Hz (Bertec Corp). Each 
participant performed an initial static, standing calibration trial. Participants then completed 
2 jump-landing tasks from a 30-cm box in random order: double-leg jump and single-leg 
jump on the dominant limb (Figure 1, B and C). The dominant limb was identified by the 
participant when asked which leg she would use to kick a soccer ball as far as possible. For 
the double-leg jump, participants jumped forward from the box onto 2 force plates at a 
distance of 50% body height. The participant landed with each foot on a separate force plate 
and immediately performed a countermovement jump to achieve maximal height. For the 
single-leg jump, participants jumped forward from the box with their dominant leg onto a 
force plate at a distance of 40% body height. The participant landed on her dominant leg and 
immediately performed a countermovement jump to achieve maximal height. Upon 
completion of the jump-landing tasks, participants performed 2 cutting tasks: preplanned 
and unanticipated. For both tasks, the participants performed a running, sidestepping cut-off 
of their dominant limb at approximately 45° from the line of approach (Figure 1A), with an 
approach speed of 3.8 ± 0.5 m/s monitored with timing gates (Fusion Sport). For the 
unanticipated cutting task, the cutting direction was randomly cued with 1 of 2 timing lights. 
A trial was considered good if the athlete landed with the entire dominant foot on a single 
force plate.
Intervention
The F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-up program41 was started approximately 2 weeks 
after preintervention testing (mean [±SD], 12 ± 6 days). The intervention was conducted 
during the soccer season and consisted of 15 sessions (approximately 2 per week for 7-8 
weeks). Each session was allotted approximately 25 minutes and replaced each intervention 
team's standard warm-up before the start of regular practice. Full details on the exercises can 
be found at www.f-marc.com/11plus. The program consists of 3 components: (1) 6 running 
exercises at moderate speed combined with dynamic stretching and controlled contact with a 
partner; (2) 6 exercises targeting strength, balance, and jump-landing techniques with 3 
levels of increasing difficulty; and (3) 3 high-speed running and cutting drills. For the 
second component only, athletes progressed to the next difficulty level of an exercise once 
they demonstrated the correct form for the entire duration of the exercise. A minimum of 1 
of 4 trained research staff members attended each training session. The research staff 
administered the intervention program and provided feedback on the proper technique 
(Figure 2). Athlete attendance, defined as the percentage of total training sessions 
completed, was a mean 70.2% ± 14.0%. This statistic also took into account partial 
attendance during a training session (eg, if an athlete showed up late and only completed 
half of the program, she received an attendance score of 50% for that session).
Postintervention Testing
The athletes returned to participate in postintervention laboratory testing within 2 weeks of 
completing the intervention phase (mean [±SD], 8 ± 6 days). During this time, athletes

 continued to practice and compete with their teams. Postintervention data collection 
followed the same procedure used for preintervention data collection. Twenty-six 
participants in the intervention group returned for postintervention testing (mean, 67 ± 8 
days after preintervention testing). One participant did not return because of an injury, and 1 
did not return because of scheduling conflicts. Twenty control participants returned for 
follow-up laboratory testing (mean, 63 ± 7 days after baseline testing). Two participants did 
not return because of an injury, and 1 participant withdrew from the study.
Musculoskeletal Modeling
The ground-reaction force data were low-pass filtered using a fourth-order critically damped 
filter with a cutoff frequency of 30 Hz. We analyzed 3 trials for each activity and participant 
using OpenSim software version 3.2.8 A generic 34 degrees of freedom musculoskeletal 
model7 was scaled to match the anthropometric data of the individual participants using 
markers located on anatomic landmarks. Joint angles were estimated using the inverse 
kinematics tool, which reproduced the experimental movement patterns in the scaled model 
using a weighted least-squares approach to minimize the differences between the 
experimental marker locations and the model's virtual marker locations. Kinematic data were 
then filtered at 30 Hz using the filter included in the OpenSim software (low-pass IIR 
Butterworth, third order) and input to the inverse dynamics tool to estimate joint moments. 
The same 30-Hz filter used for the ground-reaction force data was then reapplied to the joint 
moments to reduce kinetic artifacts.2 Joint moments were normalized by the participants' 
body weight and height (%BW×HT). All joint moments are reported as external moments.
Statistical Analysis
Three trials from each activity were analyzed. For each trial, activity, and variable of 
interest, we identified the peak values during weight acceptance, which was defined as the 
interval between initial contact and peak knee flexion. The values from the 3 trials were 
averaged, and a repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to test the effect of 
time (pre- vs posttest) and the interaction of time and group (intervention vs control) for 
each variable of interest. Post hoc analyses were subsequently performed using the Tukey 
honest significant difference test to evaluate significant group × time interactions. In 
addition, paired-samples t tests were used to test for differences between pre- and posttest 
peak knee valgus moments for both groups. All statistical analyses were performed with 
SPSS software (version 21.0; IBM Corp), and the level of significance was set at α = .05. 
Results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean.
Results
Peak Knee Valgus Moment
Athletes who participated in the F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-up program 
improved their peak knee valgus moment compared with control athletes during the double-
leg jump task (mean change, −0.57 ± 0.27 %BW×HT vs 0.25 ± 0.25 %BW×HT, 
respectively; P = .034). The mean change in peak knee valgus moment was not significantly 
different between the intervention and control groups for any of the other activities (Figure 
3). Athletes in the intervention group reduced their peak knee valgus moment from 3.62 to

 3.05 %BW×HT during the double-leg jump (P = .045) (Table 2). In comparison, the control 
athletes did not change (P = .331). The only other effect of time was observed with a 
significant increase in peak knee valgus moment during unanticipated cutting (P = .042), 
indicating that the athletes, regardless of their group, increased their peak knee valgus 
moment from pre- to post-test during unanticipated cutting (Table 3).
Secondary Kinematic and Kinetic Variables
Of the secondary variables investigated, the intervention group improved peak ankle 
eversion during most activities compared with the control group (Table 3). Compared with 
the control group, the intervention group decreased peak ankle eversion angles during 
unanticipated cutting (P = .034) and decreased peak ankle eversion moments during 
preplanned cutting (P = .015), unanticipated cutting (P = .004), and the double-leg jump (P 
= .016). The only other significant pre- to posttest difference between the groups in the 
secondary variables was an improvement and decrease in peak knee valgus angles in the 
control group compared with the intervention group during unanticipated cutting (P = .018). 
The only significant main effect of time in the secondary kinetic variables was peak hip 
adduction moment during the single-leg jump (P = .006), indicating that athletes, regardless 
of their group, reduced their peak hip adduction moment from pre- to posttest.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in biomechanical risk factors for an ACL 
injury after participation in the F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-up program in female 
preadolescent soccer players. In partial support of our hypothesis, we measured a reduction 
in peak knee valgus moment during the double-leg jump task after training. However, we 
found no difference in the change in peak knee valgus moment between the intervention and 
control groups for the single-leg jump or cutting tasks.
The effectiveness of injury prevention programs in improving risk factors for an ACL injury 
in children has not been comprehensively investigated.9,10,18 For example, Grandstrand et 
al18 and DiStefano et al10 examined changes during a jump-landing task, but neither study 
reported joint angles or moments and instead reported knee separation distance and Landing 
Error Scoring System (LESS) scores38 as outcome measures, respectively. We sought to 
expand on these studies by reporting kinematic and kinetic variables associated with ACL 
injuries, including what is thought to be the primary risk factor: peak knee valgus moment. 
The results of our study suggest that it is possible to improve peak knee valgus moment in a 
preadolescent population during a double-leg jump.
We further built upon previous studies by investigating unanticipated cutting and single-leg 
jump tasks, movements that have not previously been investigated in preadolescent athletes 
after participation in an injury prevention program. DiStefano and colleagues9 reported 
findings for a large number of angle and moment variables during a preplanned cutting task 
but only found improvement in knee external rotation at initial contact. Similarly, our results 
revealed only minimal changes during both unanticipated cutting and single-leg jump tasks. 
A potentially concerning finding of our study was the increase in peak knee valgus moment 
during the unanticipated cutting task for both the control and intervention groups. Although

 the pre- to posttest increase in peak knee valgus moment was greater for the intervention 
group (Figure 3), the increase was not statistically different from that of the control group. 
Because the program does not include an unanticipated cutting task, the athletes did not 
receive training in this type of movement. This likely suggests that the F-MARC 11+ 
program was not responsible for making the athletes “worse” in the unanticipated cutting 
task. Rather, the F-MARC 11+ program does not appear to adequately address deficits in 
cutting biomechanics in preadolescent athletes.
The distribution of exercises included in the F-MARC 11+ program may have contributed to 
our finding of an improvement in peak knee valgus moment during the double-leg jump task 
but not during the single-leg jump, preplanned cutting, or unanticipated cutting. The second 
component of the program includes multiple squatting and jumping exercises, for which the 
athletes can, and did, progress to increasing levels of difficulty. Level 1 of the squat and 
jump exercises emphasize proper double-leg form. Twelve athletes of the intervention group 
progressed to level 2 for the squat (walking lunges) and jump (lateral side-to-side) exercises. 
All athletes of the intervention group progressed to level 2 on the single-leg stance exercise 
(single-leg balance while throwing a ball to a partner), but the exercise emphasizes balance 
rather than jump-landing mechanics, which may explain why we measured no change in the 
single-leg jump task. The third component of the program includes a single plant-and-cut 
maneuver, for which the athletes cannot progress in difficulty. The cutting movement proved 
to be a greater challenge compared with the other exercises because many of the 
preadolescent girls had not yet learned to execute true plant-and-cut maneuvers. The lack of 
improvement in the single-leg jump and cutting tasks may suggest that the F-MARC 11+ 
program does not address some key mechanisms of injuries, which often involve single-leg 
landings or quick changes in direction.4,33,37
Our investigation of other kinematic and kinetic variables associated with ACL injuries 
revealed few changes after the intervention, with the exception of peak ankle eversion 
moment. Athletes improved their peak ankle eversion moment significantly after training 
during preplanned cutting, unanticipated cutting, and the double-leg jump compared with 
control athletes. Excessive ankle eversion is part of the dynamic knee valgus position 
observed in many noncontact ACL injuries.5,24,27 Previous work suggests that improper foot 
and ankle kinematics may play a role in an increased ACL injury risk.11,21 Nevertheless, this 
is not universally accepted; Mitchell et al34 found no relationship between foot loading 
patterns and knee biomechanics during a drop jump in collegiate female soccer players. In 
our study, an improvement in peak ankle eversion moment coincided with an improvement 
in peak knee valgus moment in only the double-leg jump task, suggesting a possible 
association between foot eversion and knee valgus in double-leg landings. However, the 
exact effect of foot biomechanics on the ACL injury risk, particularly in the preadolescent 
athlete, remains unknown and warrants further investigation.
The results of the current study should be considered in light of several limitations. The 
duration of the intervention program was limited to the duration of the athletes' soccer 
season, which included 15 sessions of in-season training over the course of 8 weeks. While 
some previous studies have shown a reduction in ACL injuries using lengthy training 
sessions23 or high-frequency programs,32 other research suggests that brief training sessions

 may be sufficient to show benefits.36,42 An additional limitation was the lack of progression 
of the athletes to higher level exercises. Significant improvements may have been observed 
had the athletes progressed to the more challenging balance and plyometric exercises, 
particularly single-leg exercises. The F-MARC 11+ program may therefore require a longer 
intervention period for preadolescent athletes to acclimate and progress to higher levels 
compared with older athletes.
Whether the biomechanical changes that we observed will translate to a reduction in ACL 
injuries in this population remains unknown and is beyond the scope of this study. Previous 
studies that implemented the F-MARC 11+ program found a significant reduction in overall 
injuries and various other injury categories, but none of them reported a significant reduction 
in ACL injuries.20,31,41 While the F-MARC 11+ program appears to reduce overall injury 
rates, it remains unknown if the F-MARC 11+ program reduces ACL injuries in particular. 
Additional work is needed to determine what components hold the greatest potential for 
ACL injury prevention.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to measure changes in biomechanical risk factors for 
an ACL injury after implementation of the F-MARC 11+ program and the first to evaluate 
biomechanical changes during an unanticipated cutting task and single-leg jump task after 
any prevention program in preadolescent athletes. Our findings suggest that the F-MARC 
11+ injury prevention warm-up program may be effective in improving peak knee valgus 
moment, a risk factor for ACL injuries, during a double-leg jump in preadolescent athletes. 
However, the finding of increased peak knee valgus moment during the unanticipated cutting 
task also provides motivation for modifying intervention programs to produce more 
comprehensive improvement in other movement patterns associated with the ACL injury 
risk, particularly cutting and single-leg tasks. The potential to improve or prevent risky 
movement patterns in young athletes, before they reach adolescence and the peak age for 
injuries, is a largely untapped avenue of research that merits future study.
