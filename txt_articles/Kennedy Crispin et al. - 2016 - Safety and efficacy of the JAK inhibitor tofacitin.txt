Introduction
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease with a lifetime prevalence of 2% (1). Loss of immune 
privilege leads to hair cycle growth arrest of the anagen hair, resulting in nonscarring hair loss. AA is 
characterized by small patches of hair loss within normal hair-bearing skin. The variants of AA include 
alopecia totalis (AT), characterized by complete loss of scalp hair; alopecia universalis (AU), character-
ized by complete loss of scalp and other body hair; and ophiasis pattern AA, characterized by hair loss 
BACKGROUND. Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by hair loss mediated 
by CD8+ T cells. There are no reliably effective therapies for AA. Based on recent developments in 
the understanding of the pathomechanism of AA, JAK inhibitors appear to be a therapeutic option; 
however, their efficacy for the treatment of AA has not been systematically examined.
METHODS. This was a 2-center, open-label, single-arm trial using the pan-JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib 
citrate, for AA with >50% scalp hair loss, alopecia totalis (AT), and alopecia universalis (AU). 
Tofacitinib (5 mg) was given twice daily for 3 months. Endpoints included regrowth of scalp hair, 
as assessed by the severity of alopecia tool (SALT), duration of hair growth after completion of 
therapy, and disease transcriptome.
RESULTS. Of 66 subjects treated, 32% experienced 50% or greater improvement in SALT score. AA 
and ophiasis subtypes were more responsive than AT and AU subtypes. Shorter duration of disease 
and histological peribulbar inflammation on pretreatment scalp biopsies were associated with 
improvement in SALT score. Drug cessation resulted in disease relapse in 8.5 weeks. Adverse events 
were limited to grade I and II infections. An AA responsiveness to JAK/STAT inhibitors score was 
developed to segregate responders and nonresponders, and the previously developed AA disease 
activity index score tracked response to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS. At the dose and duration studied, tofacitinib is a safe and effective treatment 
for severe AA, though it does not result in a durable response. Transcriptome changes reveal 
unexpected molecular complexity within the disease.

localized to the temporal and occipital scalp.
Treatment of AA is challenging, and there is no 
FDA-approved therapy. While a variety of therapies are 
commonly used, none of them are reliably effective, espe-
cially for the treatment of severe AA, AT, and AU (2).
Two decades of experimental research using animal 
models of AA and genome-wide association studies both in 
mice and humans have elucidated key factors in AA patho-
genesis (3, 4). An important therapeutic insight was the dis-
covery that blockade of common signaling pathways down-
stream of cytokine receptors, in particular JAK/STAT, could 
reverse AA in mice (5). Subsequently, treatment of 1 patient 
with the pan-JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib citrate (6); 3 patients 
with the JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib (5); and 1 patient 
with JAK1/2 inhibitor, baricitinib (7), induced inflamma-
tory remission and hair regrowth. Accordingly, a 2-center, 
open-label trial was performed to assess the safety and effi-
cacy of tofacitinib in patients with severe AA, AT, and AU.
Results
Participants. Of the 70 patients enrolled, 66 completed the 
trial (Figure 1). Two patients withdrew prior to receiving tofacitinib, one patient withdrew after 1 month 
due to inability to attend study visits, and another patient withdrew after 11 weeks due to esophageal reflux 
thought to be unrelated to the drug. There were 31 (47%) men and 35 (53%) women, with a median age of 
37 years (range 19–65 years). The median duration of the current episode of AA was 5 years (range 0.5–43 
years). Different clinical subtypes were represented, including 11 patients with AA (16.7%), 3 with ophiasis 
(4.6%), 6 with AT (7.6%), and 46 with AU (71.2%). Scalp biopsies were performed in 28 patients, 23 (82%) 
of which exhibited follicular peribulbar inflammation prior to treatment. Several patients had concomitant 
autoimmune comorbidities, including atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, thyroid disease, asthma, vitiligo, 
and psoriasis (Table 1).
Clinical response and associations. After 3 months of treatment, the median percentage change in the 
severity of alopecia tool (SALT) score was 21%. Treatment response was divided into 3 groups: nonre-
sponders (NRs) had a percentage change in SALT score improvement of less than 5% (36% of patients), 
intermediate responders (IRs) had a percentage change in SALT score improvement of between 5% and 
50% (32% of patients), and strong responders (SRs) had a percentage change in SALT score improvement 
of greater than 50% (32% of patients) (Figure 2A).
The relationship between demographics and clinical characteristics with percentage change in SALT 
score after 3 months was assessed. There was no correlation between age and percentage change in SALT 
score (r = 0.03918, P = 0.7548). The median improvement for men was 23.7% compared with 13.9% in 
women, but this was not found to be statistically significant in either the univariate (P = 0.2256) or multi-
variate (P = 0.0990) analyses (Figure 2B and Table 2). The subtype affected the median percentage change 
in SALT: AA (70.0%), ophiasis (68.0%), AT (11.8%), and AU (10.5%) (P = 0.0024) (Figure 2C). In the 
multivariate analysis, patients with AA had a 34% greater percentage change in SALT score compared with 
patients with AU (P = 0.0005), and patients with ophiasis had a 48% greater percentage change in SALT 
score compared with patients with AU (P = 0.006) (Table 2). There was a significant negative correlation 
between duration of current episode of AA and percentage change in SALT score (–0.35559, P = 0.0034) 
(Figure 2D). In a multivariate model that included duration of current episode of AA (in years), gender, 
and AA subtype, each additional year of disease accounted for a decrease in percentage change in SALT 
score of 0.78 (P = 0.0247) (Table 2). Principal component analysis of genome-wide RNA sequencing of 
pretreatment biopsies demonstrated that SRs with more longstanding disease (SR >20 years) more closely

of the trial prior to receiving medication due to inability to attend trial visits. Two additional patients withdrew 
from the study prior to completing 3 months of tofacitinib citrate.

matched SRs with shorter duration disease (SR <10 years) than disease duration-matched NRs 
(NR >20 years), suggesting that the signaling status of the scalp, rather than the duration of 
disease, predicts response (Figure 2E).
Scalp biopsy specimens were examined in order to assess the association of disease response 
and preexisting inflammation. In patients with peribulbar inflammation (23 of 28), a median 
percentage change in SALT score of 32.9% (range, 1.2%–87.4%) was observed, while in patients 
without peribulbar inflammation (5 of 28), a median percentage change in SALT score of only 
1.2% (range 0–65) (P = 0.05) was seen (Figure 2F). The results of a representative NR are shown 
in Figure 3A, wherein minimal peribulbar inflammation on pretreatment scalp biopsy (Figure 
3A) is visible, and the patient did not demonstrate hair growth between 0 (Figure 3B) and 3 
months (Figure 3C). In contrast, the results of a SR show marked peribulbar inflammation on 
pretreatment scalp biopsy (Figure 3D). The corresponding upregulation of phosphorylated 
STAT3 (pSTAT3) in hair follicles visible with indirect immunofluorescence (Figure 3E) was 
reduced after 2 months of tofacitinib (Figure 3F) in this patient, with an initial SALT score of 
100 (Figure 3G) and a SALT score of 13 after 3 months (Figure 3H).
Molecular biomarker analysis. In all patients for whom biopsies were performed, the activity 
of tofacitinib was further confirmed using transcriptome analysis and the trivariate composite 
AA disease activity index (ALADIN) score. This score is derived from analyzing a composite 
of 16 genes that have been shown to characterize pathogenic IFN and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) 
responses and hair growth in ruxolitinib-treated AA (5); it effectively stratifies a large cohort of 
AA patients based on disease phenotype (8). In AU and AT patients, from baseline to week 8, 
the change in IFN scores was significant for NRs and SRs (Z = 2.07, P = 0.039 and Z = 2.07, P 
= 0.039, respectively) (Figure 4, purple genes), and the change in CTL scores approached signif-
icance within NRs and SRs (Z = 1.84, P = 0.07, and Z = 1.836, P = 0.074, respectively) (Figure 
4, blue genes, and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this 
article; doi:10.1172/jci.insight.89776DS1), consistent with JAK inhibition by tofacitinib.
In contrast to previous reports however (5), no significant difference in CTL or IFN scores 
was observed between NRs and SRs at baseline or at week 8 (Supplemental Figure 1, A–C), indi-
cating that these markers do not distinguish responders from NRs at baseline in our study group. 
Despite reduction in inflammation (ALADIN, IFN and CTL signaling), the RNA sequencing data reveals an 
increased molecular complexity for hair growth not captured in the ALADIN score.
To generate a signature of early tofacitinib response, a naive, unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
(HCL) analysis was performed at 8 weeks of treatment using the AA gene signatures (AAGS) derived 
from previously published work, which are a validated representation of AA pathogenesis and severity (9). 
This disease signature accurately separated SRs and NRs at 8 weeks (Supplemental Figure 2), indicating 
that the course of response in this trial followed comparable molecular tracks that have been validated as 
characterizing AA pathology.
Performing the same analysis comparing pretreatment and 8-week scalp biopsy specimens also 
revealed distinct patterns of coclustering across time (Supplemental Figure 3). Differences between 
patient-paired samples revealed the existence of 2 subclusters of NRs. One of these subclusters had a 
molecular behavior similar to that in the SRs and the other had a molecular behavior discordant with 
response. This was used to partition the NRs into presumptive slow responders, who may eventually

respond to treatment and are simply delayed, and likely true NRs, who exhibit no indication of 
improvement at a molecular level.
Since these classes were naively identified using the AAGS, it was possible to subsequently 
generate biomarker signatures that directly maximize the molecular separation between the class-
es, independent of the AAGS. The top 50 most differentially expressed genes, which we call the 
AA responsiveness to JAK/STAT inhibitors (AARSIN) genes, were selected as a biomarker pan-
el for SRs, slow responders, and true NRs (Supplemental Table 1). Of the 50 genes encompassing 
this list, approximately 60% are coding and 40% noncoding. Included in the coding genes are 
HHLA2, encoding the CD28 costimulatory ligand B7-H7, while among the noncoding genes are 
RAETK1, a lncRNA expressed in the intergenic region expressing natural killer G2D (NKG2D) 
ligands; ULBP1–6; and PSORS1C3, a psoriasis-associated lncRNA expressed near HLABC and 
NKG2D ligand MICA.
The AARSIN genes were used to perform a cluster analysis across all patient biopsies at 
baseline to test whether or not this signature would accurately cluster all responders with the 
designated slow responders (Figure 5A). A positive result in this analysis indicated that the 
biomarker panel derived from the AAGS true NRs versus slow responders was sufficient to 
predict SR versus NR across the treatment cohort, as near-perfect clustering was achieved, 
with only 1 outlier patient from the SR cohort (Figure 5B). The AARSIN genes appear to 
reflect the molecular complexity of the tofacitinib-treated patients in this study.
Durability of  response. To assess durability of hair regrowth after drug cessation, patients were 
followed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of tofacitinib. Twenty patients were available 
for evaluation, and all of them experienced hair loss (median 8.5 weeks) (Supplemental Figure 4).
Adverse events. In studies of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, transaminitis 
and infections were observed (8, 10). In this AA study, relatively few adverse effects were noted 
(Tables 3 and 4), and these were limited to grade I and II infections. Mild clinical infections that 
included paronychia and upper respiratory tract infection were reported in 25% of patients. One 
patient with a history of atopic dermatitis and herpes zoster experienced uncomplicated derma-
tomal zoster after 2 months of tofacitinib. No patients required hospitalization. A single patient 
with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis experienced a mild elevation of AST and ALT during treatment 
that resolved subsequent to the clinical trial after weight loss (and continuing to take tofacitinib).
Discussion
This study is the first and largest clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the pan-JAK inhibitor, 
tofacitinib, for the treatment of severe AA and variants, AT and AU. The results suggest that tofacitinib is 
a safe and effective treatment for severe AA, AT, and AU. In this study, 64% of patients responded to treat-
ment, and 32% of patients achieved an improvement in SALT score of 50% or greater in only 3 months of 
therapy. Tofacitinib was well tolerated, with grade I and grade II adverse events only. This is corroborated 
by large studies of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis, in which 4% of active-treatment patients discon-
tinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 3% of patients in the placebo groups (10, 11–13). 
Ruxolitinib, another JAK inhibitor, is associated with infection, bone marrow suppression, and transami-
nitis (14). While tofacitinib was efficacious, all responders began losing hair again approximately 2 months 
after stopping the medication, indicating the recurrence of inflammatory stimuli following removal of JAK 
inhibitor treatment.
The effect of tofacitinib on the JAK/STAT pathway in AA is evidenced by the downregulation of 
pSTAT3 in hair follicles during treatment. A recent study of normal murine cycling hair demonstrated that 
JAK signaling induces a telogen block, preventing the hair from entering anagen phase and that JAK inhib-
itors induce anagen hair growth similar to a hedgehog pathway agonist (15). Another study demonstrated 
upregulation of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 signaling in hair follicles in AA but not normal hair follicles due 
to IFN-γ signaling (5), supporting the idea that immune dysregulation enforces a similar hair cycle arrest.
Unlike in the murine studies, the data herein show that inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway by 
tofacitinib is not entirely predictive of short-term hair growth in AA and reveal a more complex molec-
ular pathogenesis. While shorter duration of current episode of disease is positively associated with 
response, patients with duration of current episode of disease up to 24 years exhibited a molecular 
signature similar to those with shorter duration disease. The ALADIN score, previously validated in

ruxolitinib-treated patients (5) and in Mackay-Wiggan et al. (16), adequately predicted patient response 
to ruxolitinib, and it was not able to stratify SRs from NRs to tofacitinib. This is not surprising, as the 
target specificity of the drugs differs and because there was a predominance of AT and AU patients 
in this study, rather than patch-stage AA in the ruxolitinib trial, or, alternatively, because our study 
analyzed patients at 2 months after treatment with tofacitinib, which may not represent a complete 
response or reversion of gene expression signatures.
The AARSIN gene list developed in this study stratifies SRs, slow responders, and true NRs to 
tofacitinib and suggests a molecular scoring system for predicting responsiveness to treatment with 
Figure 3. Association of disease response and inflammation. (A) A representative nonresponder had minimal peribulbar inflammation on initial

this drug. Preliminary data indicate that the AARSIN gene list 
may also stratify ruxolitinib-treated patients, although the small 
number of patients prevents achievement of statistical signifi-
cance (Mackay-Wiggan et al., ref. 16). The identification of a slow 
responder group suggests that longer treatment duration or more 
potent JAK inhibitors may be beneficial for some patients who 
do respond clinically early in treatment. Indeed, 2 patients in the 
slow responder group who continued the medication for an addi-
tional 3 months experienced percentage change in SALT score of 
50%–90% (J.M. Ko and M.K. Crispin, unpublished observations).
In summary, tofacitinib is safe and effective for the treatment of 
severe AA, AT, and AU, though it does not give a durable response 
at the dose and duration studied. JAK inhibition represents a target-
ed therapy for this disease. Additional trials are needed to validate 
the AARSIN and ALADIN scores and to elucidate dosing regimens 
that may provide durable responses.
Methods
Study design. Patients were enrolled at 2 centers between July 2014 and March 2015. Patients received 5 mg 
tofacitinib twice daily for 3 months. Optional scalp biopsies were performed at one center at the time of 
enrollment and after 2 months of treatment and were analyzed for histology and RNA sequencing.
A dose escalation model was initially planned, whereby patients would receive 5 mg every other day; 
if no hair regrowth occurred after 1 month, the dose would be increased to 5 mg daily. If no regrowth 
occurred at this dose after 1 month, the dose would be increased to 5 mg twice daily for a total of 3 months. 
Due to a lack of hair regrowth observed at 5 mg every other day and 5 mg daily, all patients were treated 
with 5 mg twice daily after the first 13 patients completed treatment with the dose escalation model.
The primary endpoint was the percentage change in scalp hair growth, measured with SALT (17). 
Secondary endpoints included the effect on treatment response of patient age, sex, duration of current 
episode of AA, AA subtype, and the presence of peribulbar inflammation on pretreatment scalp biopsy 
as well as duration of hair growth following drug cessation and scalp biopsy transcriptome analysis.
Study participants. Patients 18 years of age or older with a clinical diagnosis of AA with at least 
50% hair loss involving the scalp, AT, or AU were eligible for the study if hair loss had been present 
for at least 6 months without evidence of hair regrowth. Patients were recruited to the study by self-re-
ferral or referral from their dermatologists. Patients must not have received any treatments known to 
affect AA within 2 months of enrollment and were not permitted to use any other treatment known to 
affect AA while taking tofacitinib. Patients were excluded if they had active malignancy or a history of 
malignancy other than successfully treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, leukopenia, anemia, hepatic or 
renal impairment, peptic ulcer disease, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, posi-
tive tuberculin skin test, or positive serum QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Qiagen). Patients taking systemic 
immunomodulatory medications were excluded. Women who were pregnant or nursing and women of 
childbearing age who were unwilling or unable to use contraception were excluded.
Evaluations for efficacy and safety. The evaluations were performed and data were collected in academ-
ic dermatology clinical practices. Scalp hair growth during the study was assessed using SALT score at 
the beginning of the study, after 3 months of treatment, and during a 12-week period after completion 
of treatment. SALT is a validated tool used to quantify the scalp surface area that is affected by alope-
cia (17), where a SALT score of 100 indicates complete scalp hair loss and a score of 0 corresponds to 
no scalp hair loss. Safety was evaluated by monthly monitoring of review of systems, complete blood 
count with differential, complete metabolic panel, and fasting lipid panel. Adverse events were charac-
terized according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (18).

Histology and indirect immunofluorescence. 4-mm punch biopsies were taken at enrollment and after 2 
months of treatment. For assessment of follicular peribulbar inflammation, biopsies were paraffin-embed-
ded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard procedures. Presence of 
peribulbar inflammation was assessed by a dermatopathologist. For indirect immunofluorescence, biopsies 
were embedded in OCT and snap frozen and 7-μM cryosections were cut on a cryostat (Leica). Sam-
ples were methanol fixed, washed with TBS, and blocked with 10% donkey serum. Slides were stained 
with pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling) and β4-integrin (Millipore) overnight, washed with TBS, and incubated 
with Alexa Fluor 555 Goat anti Rabbit IgG (H+L) (A-21428, ThermoFisher Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 
488 Goat anti Mouse IgG (H+L) (A-11029, ThermoFisher Scientific) secondary antibodies together with 
Hoechst counterstain for 1 hour. After washing, slides were mounted using Fluoromount (Southern Bio-
tech). Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope at ×10 and ×63 magnification and 
processed using ImageJ (NIH).
RNA sequencing. RNA from 4-mm punch biopsies was submitted for RNA sequencing to the Columbia 
University sequencing facility. For the RNA sequencing analysis, reads were aligned to the human refer-
ence genome (hg19). Gene counts were calculated using HTSeq and were used as an input for differential 
gene expression analysis with DESeq (version 1.20.0). Comparing pretreatment group 1 to group 3, genes 
Figure 5. Unsupervised biomarker signature predicting nonresponse to 
tofacitinib. (A) Differences between patient-paired samples revealed the 
existence of 2 subclusters of nonresponders. One of these subclusters had 
a molecular behavior similar to that in the SR group, and the other had a 
molecular behavior discordant with response. This was used to partition 
the nonresponders into presumptive slow responders, who may eventu-
ally respond to treatment and are simply delayed, and likely true nonre-
sponders, who exhibit no indication of improvement at a molecular level. 
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the tofacitinib patients using the 
“slow responder versus nonresponder” gene signature is shown. This gene 
signature was derived from the top 50 most differentially expressed genes 
when comparing true nonresponders and slow responders (P < 0.05). The 
clustering demonstrates that the signature is capable of robustly separat-
ing molecular true nonresponders (red patients, n = 8) from slow respond-
ers (orange patients, n = 11), which in turn segregated with the molecular 
true responders (blue patients, n = 9). White lines are superimposed as a 
visual aid to demarcate the primary superclusters in both gene and sample 
clustering. (B) A 3-dimensional representation of the first 3 principal com-
ponents underlying the clustering results provides a spatial representation 
of the molecular divergence between patients based on predicted molecular 
response. The true nonresponders (red spheres, n = 8) segregate from a 
second cluster consisting of a mix of true responders (blue spheres, n = 9) 
and slow responders (orange spheres, n = 11).

with a P value of less than 0.05 as well as a 2-fold change were chosen for further anal-
ysis. PCA analysis was performed in R on the Z scores of the genes that are a part of 
the ALADIN index. Z score was also used for visualizing the genes associated with the 
ALADIN index in a heatmap.
The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE80688 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80688) (19).
Calculation of  ALADIN score. The IFN, CTL, and KRT scores were determined fol-
lowing procedures outlined in Xing et al. (5). Previously, Z scores were calculated for 
each Affymetrix probe set ID (PSID) relative to the mean and standard deviation of 
normal controls (5). Scores for each gene were obtained by averaging Z scores of PSIDs 
mapping to that gene. In this study, Z scores were calculated for each gene relative to 
the mean and standard deviation of responders (patients in group 3) at week 8. Signature scores were the 
calculated averages of the scores for genes belonging to the corresponding signature.
AA gene expression validation in TOFA trial. The AAGS used to validate the molecular separation of 
responders and NRs (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4) was obtained from previous studies of AA8 (9). 
This gene signature was previous derived from a cohort independent of this study and biologically 
validated via master regulator analysis. This signature was subsequently used in unsupervised HCL 
projected onto the tofacitinib week 8 cohort to ascertain the strength of segregation between respond-
ers and NRs. Statistical separation was assayed by Fisher’s exact test across the primary superclusters 
generated by the HCL. The analysis was performed using Pearson’s correlation as the clustering metric 
with leave-one-out cross-validation.
Defining slow responder and NRs. Using the AAGS, we repeated the HCL on the entire cohort of group 1 
and group 3 samples across both time points. This clustering analysis was designed to ascertain the relative 
molecular distances of patient-matched biosamples across time. The group 1 cohort molecularly coseg-
regated into two secondary clusters based on the AAGS. Rather than define subgroups based directly on 
this cosegregation (since each cluster is a mix of time points), we instead computed the overall molecular 
distance vectors between patient-matched samples. Slow responders were subsequently defined as patients 
whose molecular vectors followed similar trajectories to the responder patients, while NRs were defined as 
those samples whose trajectories deviated in molecular space.
Training and validation of  responder signature. Since the slow responder and NR cohorts were iden-
tified naively from an externally validated gene expression signature, we next sought to identify 
biomarkers that maximally predict and segregate these subtypes from each other. We performed a 
standard differential expression analysis between these subtypes, taking the top 50 most differentially 
expressed genes (arrayed by absolute value of the log2 fold change for all genes differentially expressed, 
P < 0.05). Using this signature, we performed HCL on the initial time point biosamples to ascertain 
whether the signature was sufficient to cluster all true responders and slow responders separately from 
the molecular NRs.
Statistics. The analyses included only the patients who completed the planned treatment with tofaci-
tinib. Absolute change in SALT score was calculated by subtracting the final SALT score from the initial 
SALT score. Percentage change in SALT score was calculated by dividing the absolute change in SALT 
score by the initial SALT score. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to test whether the absolute 
SALT score change and percentage change in SALT score was different from 0. Spearman correla-
tion coefficient was calculated on age and current episode, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to 
explore whether SALT scores differ among each layer of categorical variables. Variables with P values 
of less than 0.20 were retained in a linear regression model to estimate the effects on percentage change 
in SALT score, and residual plots were checked to assess the model fit. To estimate the likelihood of 
percentage change in SALT score equal or greater than 50%, logistic regression was applied, including 
variables with P values of less than 0.20 in univariate analyses. All analyses were conducted in SAS 
(version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.). Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Study approval. The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the IRBs at Stanford University 
and Yale University. Patients provided informed consent prior to enrolling in the studies. Permission was 
obtained from patients for publication of photos.
