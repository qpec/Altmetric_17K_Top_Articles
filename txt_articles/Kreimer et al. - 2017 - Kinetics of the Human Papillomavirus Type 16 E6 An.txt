Abstract
Background: In a European cohort, it was previously reported that 35% of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients were human
papillomavirus type-16 (HPV16) seropositive up to 10 years before diagnosis vs 0.6% of cancer-free controls. Here, we describe
the kinetics of HPV16-E6 antibodies prior to OPC diagnosis.
Methods: We used annual serial prediagnostic blood samples from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. Antibodies to HPV were
initially assessed in prediagnostic blood drawn at study enrollment from 198 incident head and neck cancer patients (median
years to cancer diagnosis ¼ 6.6) and 924 matched control subjects using multiplex serology, and subsequently in serial samples
(median ¼ 5/individual). Available tumor samples were identified and tested for HPV16 RNA to define HPV-driven OPC.
Results: HPV16-E6 antibodies were present at baseline in 42.3% of 52 OPC patients and 0.5% of 924 control subjects. HPV16-E6
antibody levels were highly elevated and stable across serial blood samples for 21 OPC patients who were seropositive at base-
line, as well as for one OPC patient who seroconverted closer to diagnosis. All five subjects with HPV16-driven OPC tumors were
HPV16-E6-seropositive, and the four subjects with HPV16-negative OPC tumors were seronegative. The estimated 10-year cumu-
lative risk of OPC was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.8% to 21.5%) for HPV16-E6-seropositive men, 1.3% (95% CI¼ 0.1% to
15.3%) for HPV16-E6-seropositive women, and 0.04% (95% CI¼ 0.03% to 0.06%) among HPV16-E6-seronegative individuals.
Conclusions: Forty-two percent of subjects diagnosed with OPC between 1994 and 2009 in a US cohort were HPV16-E6 sero-
positive, with stable antibody levels during annual follow-up for up to 13 years prior to diagnosis. Tumor analysis indicated
that the sensitivity and specificity of HPV16-E6 antibodies were exceptionally high in predicting HPV-driven OPC.
Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) incidence has increased in parts
of the developed world (1–11), likely due to human papilloma-
virus type-16 (HPV16) (1–3). In the United States, incidence of
OPC has risen more than 200% during the past three decades,
and HPV16 infection has been estimated to be responsible for
more than 70% of cases diagnosed in the 2000s (1).
In a European cohort, we identified HPV16-E6 antibody posi-
tivity as a potential biomarker for OPC (12). In this study, 35% of

 OPC patients were seropositive for HPV16-E6 compared with
0.6% of controls. The proportion of HPV16-E6-seropositive OPC
was similar to the attributable fraction of HPV-positive OPC
tumors in Europe from this time (13). When the lead time be-
tween the collection of the single blood sample and OPC diagno-
sis was evaluated, the proportion of HPV16-E6-seropositive
cases was similar in cases with a blood draw within five and 10
or more years of OPC diagnosis. Intriguingly, this finding sug-
gests that testing HPV16-E6 in a single blood draw might predict
a large proportion of future OPC cases, particularly in countries
with large HPV-attributable OPC fractions such as the United
States (1). However, a number of questions remain unanswered,
including the time between HPV infection to malignant trans-
formation and seroconversion, the kinetics of the antibody re-
sponse approaching OPC diagnosis, and the sensitivity of the
HPV16-E6 biomarker in a prospective setting. Few cohort studies
have the necessary serial blood samples or tumor specimens
available to address such novel questions.
In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial (PLCO) (14), blood samples were collected annually over six
years from screening arm participants, allowing for the investiga-
tion of the kinetics of potential biomarkers. Subsequently, a tumor
retrieval effort was also conducted across the United States. PLCO
enrolled participants (n > 154 000) from 1993 to 2001, with
follow-up ongoing, spanning a time when 50% to 70% of OPC
cases in the United States were attributed to HPV16 infection (1).
Methods
Study Cohort
PLCO is a randomized trial (clinicaltrials.gov trial registration:
NCT00339495) to determine the effects of prostate, lung, colo-
rectal, and ovarian cancer screening on disease-specific mortal-
ity (14); 154 935 individuals were recruited between 1993 and
2001 from 10 US screening centers. Eligibility criteria included
age 55 to 74 years and no history of prostate, lung, colorectal, or
ovarian cancer. Relevant exclusion criteria were current cancer
treatment (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) and concurrent

 participation in another cancer-screening study. Participants
provided written informed consent, and the research was
approved by the local ethics committees and the National
Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.
Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio ei-
ther to the control arm (who followed their normal health care
routine) or to the intervention arm. In the intervention arm,
study participants were screened for prostate (men), lung, colo-
rectal, and ovarian (women) cancer over six years, and blood
was collected at each of these annual study visits. Participants
with positive screening results were referred to their physicians
for diagnostic follow-up. Because blood was not collected
among participants in the control arm, we nested our study in
the intervention arm.
At study entry, participants completed a questionnaire cov-
ering demographic information, smoking, and other variables.
Incident cancer cases were identified during follow-up using
self-report, death certificates, linkage to the National Death
Index, and information from next of kin. Certified tumor regis-
trars abstracted pathology reports, and cancer diagnoses were
verified by review of medical records.
Selection of Cases and Controls
There were 77 444 individuals in the intervention arm of PLCO;
70 045 (90.4%) consented to research testing, 64 848 (83.7%) had
no cancer prior to random assignment and at least one day of
follow-up, and 62 237 (80.4%) had serum collected prior to can-
cer diagnosis (cases) or the matched date (controls). Within this
subcohort, 231 incident head and neck cancer (HNC) cases were
identified during the follow-up, including cancers of the oral
cavity (C020-C023, C030-C050, C060-69), oropharynx (C019, C024,
C051, C052, C090-C109), and larynx (C320-C329); a “mixed sites”
category was included to account for overlapping lesions (C028,
C029, C058, C059, C140, C142, C148, C149).
For each case, four controls were randomly chosen from ap-
propriate risk sets consisting of all cohort members alive and
free of cancer (except NMSC) at the time of diagnosis of the
index case. Matching criteria were year of blood draw (calendar
and study year), birth year, sex, race, and smoking status (never,
former, current). After excluding 33 cases with nonsquamous
cell carcinomas, the final study population included 198 cases
and 924 controls. Of these, 52 cases had OPC diagnosed during
follow-up.
Serology analyses were run in two phases in order to justify
the use of serial samples from PLCO (Figure 1). We initially con-
ducted a nested case-control analysis using the serum samples
collected at baseline (at enrollment or close to it; “baseline
serum”), mirroring our initial study in the European cohort (12).
Results at baseline were similar to our initial findings [12], so we
obtained access to serial samples for 1) 45 of 52 OPC cases re-
gardless of baseline HPV16-E6 serostatus (two excluded due to
lack of specimen; five HPV16-E6-seronegative cases originally
classified as oral cavity and thus did not meet criteria for serial
sample testing), 2) five HPV16-E6-seropositive mixed-site cases,
3) five HPV16-E6-seropositive controls, and 4) six new OPC cases
that occurred following completion of the nested case-control
study (diagnosed between June 2010 and August 2013). In 2013,
PLCO undertook collection of tumor tissue from multiple cancer
sites, including HPV-driven cancers (HNSCC and anogenital).
Serologic Analyses
Briefly, antigens were bacterially expressed, affinity-purified fu-
sion proteins with N-terminal Glutathione S-transferase (15,16).
Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were dichotomized
based on previously established cut-points (12); specifically for
HPV16-E6, a prespecified cutoff for seropositivity of MFI values
greater than 1000 used as this cutoff resulted in optimal specifi-
city without losing sensitivity in our previous study (12). Quality
control (QC) measures for the multiplex serology assay were at-
tained by intermixing four QC samples (A, B, C, and D) with the
study samples across the 14 plates tested (based on available
volume, between 11 and 14 aliquots were made and tested as
blinded replicates). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)
across all antigens for the QC samples were sample A 0.97 (95%
CI ¼ 0.95 to 0.99), sample B 1 (95% CI ¼ 1 to 1), sample C 0.98 (95%
CI ¼ 0.96 to 0.99), and sample D 0.99 (95% CI ¼ 0.98 to 0.99).
Tumor Analyses
DNA and RNA were extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue sample sections (17); water samples
were included to monitor cross-contamination. HPV DNA ana-
lysis was conducted using Multiplex Papillomavirus Genotyping
(18,19). Samples positive for HPV and/or beta-globin were con-
sidered DNA valid. HPV RNA analysis, that is, detection of viral
transcripts, was performed by HPV type-specific reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and hybridization
assays (17), which amplify HPV E6*I and ubiquitin C (ubC) cDNA
as a cellular mRNA QC. Specimens that were HPV E6*I and/or
ubC mRNA-positive were considered RNA valid.
Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of the cancer cases and controls were evaluated.
Utilizing the baseline samples, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) were calculated (oral cavity, oropharynx,
larynx) using unconditional (to allow calculation of OR for rare
exposures) logistic regression adjusted for matching variables
for seropositivity by HPV16 proteins. Further adjustments for al-
cohol (never/ever/missing) and education (up to high school
[HS] completion/post-HS or some college/college graduate or
higher/missing) did not qualitatively alter the odds ratios.
Differences in descriptive characteristics by HPV16-E6 serosta-
tus were assessed using chi-square tests.
The kinetics of HPV16-E6 antibody levels were evaluated
graphically by plotting the MFI values on a semi-log scale for
each serial serum sample for mixed-site cases and controls who
were HPV16-E6 seropositive at baseline and all OPC cases. To
determine if the slope of the oropharynx cases was statistically
significantly different from zero, we fit a linear regression to the
log-transformed marker values as a function of time since blood
draw and used a generalized estimation equations (GEE) ap-
proach to accommodate correlations among observations on
the same person in the variance computation (20).
HPV16 mRNA positivity was considered a marker for HPV-
driven tumors (17) and applied as gold standard for assessing
the sensitivity and specificity of HPV16-E6 serology (21).
The absolute risk of OPC was estimated in the PLCO popula-
tion by HPV16-E6 serology status. Weights were applied based
on

 1. The sampling probability for each control participant being
sampled for HPV16-E6 testing was calculated based on age, sex,
race, smoking status, calendar year of blood draw, and time in
follow-up. Logistic regression with sampling selection as the
outcome was used; a model-based approach was necessary to
cross-classify the six variables as stratification would have re-
sulted in a large number of strata (likely with some cells having
few individuals, resulting in difficultly calculating robust prob-
ability estimates). The inverse of the sampling probabilities was
then used as weights in a Cox model to calculate 10-year cumu-
lative risk of OPC, overall and by sex, age, and HPV16-E6 serosta-
tus, not accounting for competing risks (22). Confidence limits
were calculated by jackknifing (ie, taking repeated n-1 samples
of the population) the logit of the cumulative risk (23). To deter-
mine whether incidence differed by individual characteristics,
covariates were included in weighted Cox models to calculate
hazard ratios and P values. Because we calculated cumulative
risk over the first 10 years postenrollment, 14 OPC cases that
occurred after 10 years were excluded from this analysis.
All P values are two-sided, and statistical analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.2 (Raleigh, NC, USA). A P value of
less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Eighty two percent of study participants were male, median age
at study enrollment (and first blood draw) was 63 years (in-
terquartile range [IQR] ¼ 59–67 years), and 40.8% were smokers
at enrollment. Among cases, median age at cancer diagnosis
was 69.5 years (IQR ¼ 65.0–75.0 years), median time between
blood draw and diagnosis was 6.6 years (IQR ¼ 3.3–10.3 years),
and median calendar year of diagnosis was 2005 (IQR ¼ 2002–
2007; range ¼ 1994–2009). On average, five serial samples drawn
annually during the follow-up were available for the OPC cases
(median ¼ 5, IQR ¼ 4 to 6). Age, sex, and smoking status (match-
ing variables) were similar among cases and controls but dif-
fered across cancer sites (Supplementary Table 1, available
online).
HPV16-E6 Seropositivity and Risk of OPC
Seropositivity to HPV16-E6 was present in the baseline serum of
42.3% (n ¼ 22 of 52) cases with OPC and 0.5% (n ¼ 5 of 924) of con-
trols (OR ¼ 140, 95% CI ¼ 40.2 to 491) (Table 1). By anatomic sub-
site within the oropharynx, 58.8% of tonsillar cancer (n ¼ 10 of
17), 50.0% of base of tongue cancer (n ¼ 12 of 24), and 0.0% of
other oropharynx cancer (n ¼ 0 of 11) were HPV16-E6 seroposi-
tive prior to diagnosis.
In
serial
blood
samples,
individual
study
participants’
HPV16-E6 levels remained highly elevated and stable for all OPC
cases who were HPV16-E6 seropositive at baseline (Figure 2A).
The slope of the HPV16-E6-seropositive cases was not different
from zero (P ¼ .54), indicating no change over time in average
MFI values. For only one OPC case (tonsillar cancer, age 75 years
at diagnosis) who was HPV16-E6 seronegative at baseline, nine
years prior to diagnosis, HPV16-E6 antibody levels increased
during the first three visits and then remained high and stable
until diagnosis (highlighted in blue in Figure 2A). This indicates
that this case had not fully seroconverted at study enrollment,
but then developed strong seropositivity against HPV16-E6 dur-
ing the follow-up, similar to the OPC cases who were already
seropositive. In addition, one OPC case (tonsillar cancer, age 65 years
at diagnosis) had low anti-HPV16-E6 levels that fluctuated be-
tween positive and negative (Figure 2A, highlighted in orange).
Conversely, for the remaining OPC cases that were HPV16-E6
seronegative at baseline, HPV16-E6 antibody levels remained
low over the entire follow-up period, well below the threshold
for seropositivity. Individual plots of HPV16-L1, -E1, -E2, -E4, -E6,
and -E7 serologic markers of all OPC cases (and HPV16-E6-
seropositive controls) are shown in Supplementary Figure 1, A
to C (available online).
Of the five HPV16-E6-seropositive controls, three were con-
sistently positive across serial samples; one seroconverted over
time, and one was HPV16-E6 positive in two of six serial samples
(Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure 1D, available online). None de-
veloped an HPV-related cancer (ie, anogenital or oropharynx)
during the documented follow-up period.
Sensitivity and Specificity of HPV16-E6 Antibodies
Tumor specimens were retrieved from nine OPC cases (six tonsil
and three base of tongue). Of these tumor samples, five were
identified as HPV-driven based on evidence of HPV16 transcrip-
tional activity (presence of RNA), all of which were HPV16-E6
positive in corresponding enrolment serum samples (sensitivity
¼ 100%, 95% CI ¼ 47.8% to 100%). Similarly, the four HPV RNA-
negative
(not
HPV-driven)
tumors
were
all
HPV16-E6-
seronegative (specificity ¼ 100%, 95% CI ¼ 39.8% to 100%; data
not shown).
HPV16 Seropositivity for Non-E6 Proteins and Risk of
OPC
Increases in OPC risk were observed in the baseline serum for
all tested HPV16 proteins, including E7 (OR ¼ 6.1, 95% CI ¼ 2.8 to
13.2), E1 (OR ¼ 6.8, 95% CI ¼ 2.8 to 19.8), E2 (OR ¼ 29.2, 95%
CI ¼ 10.3 to 83.0), and L1 (OR ¼ 8.3, 95% CI ¼ 3.8 to 18.3) (Table 1).
After stratifying OPC cases on E6 seropositivity, antibody levels
for the other serologic markers were higher in cases who were
already E6 seropositive (Figure 3).
Cumulative Risk of OPC by HPV16-E6 Seropositivity
Status
Because HPV16-E6-seropositive OPC cases were more likely to
be
male
(94.5%,
n ¼ 21
of
22)
compared
with
HPV16-E6-
seronegative OPC (73.3%, n ¼ 22 of 30, P ¼ .04) and to be never
smokers (45.5% among HPV16-E6 seropositive cases [n ¼ 10 of
22] compared with 16.7% of HPV16-E6 seronegative cases [n ¼ 5
of 30], P ¼ 0.02), we estimated cumulative risks of OPC both
overall and stratified by sex and smoking status. Incidence of
OPC did not vary by age group (Ptrend ¼ .71) (Table 2) and thus
was not included as a covariate. The overall 10-year cumulative
incidence per 100 000 person-years within PLCO was 6.5 (95%
CI ¼ 4.6 to 9.2) overall, and incidence rates were higher among
males (10.6, 95% CI ¼ 7.4 to 15.4) than among females (2.6, 95%
CI ¼ 1.2 to 5.4), as well as in ever smokers than in never smokers
irrespective of sex (Table 2). Using the weighted Cox model, we
estimated the 10-year cumulative risk for OPC at 6.2% (95%
CI ¼ 1.8% to 21.5%) for HPV16-E6 seropositive males and 1.3%
(95% CI ¼ 0.1% to 15.3%) for HPV16-E6 seropositive females,
while the 10-year cumulative risk of OPC among HPV16-E6 sero-
negative subjects was extremely low (0.04%, 95% CI ¼ 0.03% to
0.06%) (Figure 4).

 HPV16-E6 Seropositivity and Non-OPC/Mixed Site
Cancer Risk
Mixed-site tumors had increased odds of HPV16-E6 seropositiv-
ity (Table 1; Supplementary Material, available online), and the
results from the baseline sample appeared representative of the
positives throughout the serial samples (Supplementary Figure
1C, available online). No associations with HPV16 antibodies
were observed for oral cavity or laryngeal cancer (Table 1). HPV
serology and tumor results generally corresponded among non-
OPC cases (Supplementary Material, available online).
Discussion
This is the first study to evaluate the kinetics of HPV16-E6 anti-
bodies in serial samples of OPC cases leading up to cancer diag-
nosis. In a US-based cohort and during a calendar period where
approximately half of OPCs were caused by HPV16 (1), 42.3% of
OPC cases were HPV16-E6 seropositive up to 13 years prior to
cancer diagnosis, with antibody patterns that were high and
stable throughout follow-up. This is also the first study to deter-
mine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker using
serostatus in prediagnostic samples and viral transcriptional
activity as the gold standard (21). While the tumor analysis was
based on small numbers, it did confirm that the sensitivity and
specificity of HPV16-E6 antibodies were exceptionally high (esti-
mated at 100%) in predicting HPV-driven OPC cases.
This study informs our understanding of the etiology of
HPV-driven OPC. In particular, the data strongly suggest that
precursor states manifest many years prior to clinical presenta-
tion of OPC and will help establish the important role of HPV in-
fection throughout the carcinogenic process. These results may
also have translational implications, in particular for secondary
prevention by using HPV16-E6 serology for OPC screening and
early detection. Whether this is a realistic scenario will primar-
ily depend on population incidence rates of OPC and the propor-
tion of cases caused by HPV16 infection. In the PLCO cohort, a
population of relatively low OPC incidence relative to the gen-
eral population (24), we estimated the 10-year absolute risk to
be 6.2% for HPV16-E6-seropositive men. This implies that one in
17 seropositive PLCO men age 55 to 74 years would have under-
lying HPV-driven OPC over the course of 10 years, although this
positive predictive value would improve in higher-incidence
settings. Our analysis suggested a four-fold absolute risk ratio
between HPV16-E6-seropositive male and female PLCO partici-
pants,
suggesting
screening
females
would
be
inefficient.
Identification of a population at high risk of HPV-driven OPC,
such as white men born since the mid-1940s (25), would further
improve efficiency (nb, smoking did not achieve additional risk
stratification).
Even if HPV16-E6-based screening was warranted, additional
research on subsequent steps following a positive screen is
needed. It is questionable whether current diagnostic imaging
technologies would be able to detect asymptomatic early oro-
pharyngeal tumors. PET scans can identify tumors larger than 5
mm, but the relevant oropharynx lesions may be smaller.
Diagnostic techniques with higher sensitivity may be needed,
and novel imaging techniques, such as transcervical ultrasound,
have shown promise in detecting primary tumors when trad-
itional imagining techniques have failed (26). Further, given the
survival advantage of HPV16-driven oropharyngeal cancer, the
clinical community is investigating dose de-intensification in
the treatment of these cancers (27). Given that this marker may
identify early cancers, or even precancers, cure may be possible
with relatively mild treatment regimes, such as tonsillectomy
(28), robotic surgery (29), or therapeutic HPV vaccines (30). Yet,

Figure 2. Kinetics of HPV16-E6 in prediagnostic samples from oropharyngeal cancer cases and selected controls. A) This panel shows HPV16-E6 (MFI) values by years
from blood draw to diagnosis among (OPC) cases. HPV16-E6 levels remained clearly positive and stable for all OPC cases who were HPV16-E6 seropositive at baseline.
One OPC case who was HPV16-E6 seronegative at baseline displayed increasing levels during the first three visits, after which strong and stable levels were established,
similar to the other OPC cases that were seropositive at baseline (highlighted in blue). One OPC case had HPV16-E6 levels that fluctuated between positive and negative
(highlighted in orange). B) This panel shows HPV16-E6 MFI values by year from time since study enrollment among controls. Of the five HPV16-E6-seropositive controls,
three were consistently positive across serial samples; one seroconverted over time (highlighted in purple), and one was HPV16-E6 positive in two of six serial samples
(highlighted in green). HPV ¼ human papillomavirus; MFI ¼ median fluorescence intensity; OPC ¼ oropharyngeal cancer.

 as in all secondary prevention efforts, the pitfalls of screening
need to be weighed against the potential gains.
The PLCO tumor retrieval represented a major effort across
the United States, but resulted in a relatively low number of
OPC tumors available for analysis. Thus, the main limitation to
this work is the small number of tumor samples available for
HPV RNA analysis, and while the results were encouraging in
that the concordance between tumor and serology HPV status
was perfect (100%), ongoing parallel efforts by our group will ex-
pand this analysis to confirm the high marker sensitivity (21).
We were additionally limited by small numbers of OPC overall
as OPC is currently a rare cancer. Finally, we did not test all ser-
ial samples among oral cavity cases and controls as a check for
specificity; yet only one OPC (2%) seroconverted in the serial
sample analysis, and it would thus seem unlikely that many
seroconverting oral cavity cases and/or controls were missed.
The incidence of HPV-positive OPC may continue to increase
in the coming decades (1). Highly effective HPV vaccines, which
were first introduced to 11- to 12-year-old girls in the mid-
2000s, will not curtail this male-dominated trend until at least

 2060, when the vaccinated birth cohorts reach the median age
of OPC diagnosis (�60 years). Thus, research in secondary pre-
vention of OPC is important. This study demonstrates high sen-
sitivity and specificity of the HPV16-E6 biomarker. Furthermore,
the antibody response is remarkably stable and strong up to
13 years prior to cancer diagnosis, suggesting that testing
HPV16-E6 in a single blood draw might predict the vast majority
of future HPV-driven OPCs. Yet, while these data are promising,
the incidence of OPC even among white men in the United States
is much lower than the incidence of other cancers for which
screening is currently recommended, and our data indicate that a
large number of people testing positive for HPV16-E6 would
not get cancer (0.5% of controls were HPV16-E6 seropositive).
High-risk subgroups would likely need to be identified in order
to attain a reasonable screening efficacy using the HVP16-E6
serology test.
To consider the translational potential of HPV16-E6 ser-
ology in the early detection of OPC, necessary subsequent
steps include identifying high-risk groups where screening is
warranted, identifying a histologic precursor lesion, improve-
ments in diagnostics, and establishment of low-harm treat-
ment regimens. Screening for oropharyngeal cancer using
HPV16-E6 will not be possible until these challenges are satis-
factorily solved.

for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) overall at 3.4% (95% CI ¼ 0.6% to 20.8%); by sex, the 10-year cumulative risk was 6.2% (95% CI ¼ 1.8% to 21.5%) for HPV16-E6-seropositive
males and 1.3% (95% CI ¼ 0.1% to 15.3%) for HPV16-E6-seropositive females. The 10-year cumulative risk of OPC among HPV16-E6-seronegative subjects was extremely
low (0.04%, 95% CI ¼ 0.03% to 0.06%). A separate graph of the HPV16-E6-seronegative individuals is nested in the figure in order to better visualize the curve. Please note
