in Heart Failure

R
andomized clinical trials have established the effi-
cacy of certain therapies to reduce all-cause mortality
for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF), but uptake in clinical practice has been
variable.1 More recently, the angiotensin receptor neprilysin
inhibitor (ARNI, sacubitril/valsartan) has been demonstrated
to reduce cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization com-
pared with enalapril in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI
With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and
Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial.2 A prior
study has determined the potential mortality reductions that
could be achieved with optimal implementation of other
HFrEF therapies.3 However, to date, the potential magnitude
of benefits of implementation with ARNI therapy in terms of
preventing or postponing deaths has not been quantified at
the population level.
Methods
Potential patient eligibility for ARNI therapy and the expected
mortality benefits with ARNI treatment were identified using
published sources, following the methods applied in a previ-
ous study.3 Eligibility for ARNI therapy was based on the popu-
lation of patients with HF covered in the current US Food and
Drug Administration–approved labeling.4 The number of pa-
tients with HF in the United States was based on data selected
for the 2016 American Heart Association Heart Disease and
Stroke Statistics Update.5 Rates of medical exceptions, poten-
tial contraindications, intolerance, or other patient, physi-
cian, or system reasons for not applying angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor
blocker (ARB)/ARNI therapy were derived from published
IMPORTANCE Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibition (ARNI) therapy provided incremental
survival benefit to patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in
clinical trials. To date, estimation of the potential benefits that could be gained from optimal
implementation of ARNI therapy at the population level have not been quantified.
OBJECTIVE To quantify the projected gains for deaths prevented or postponed with
comprehensive implementation of ARNI therapy for patients with HFrEF in the
United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Eligibility criteria for ARNI therapy, population-based
estimates of patients with HFrEF in the United States, and numbers needed to treat to overt
death were obtained from published sources. The potential numbers of deaths prevented or
postponed as a result of ARNI were estimated along with multiple-way sensitivity analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE All-cause mortality.
RESULTS Of 2 736 000 patients with HFrEF patients in the United States, 2 287 296 (84%)
were projected to be candidates for ARNI therapy. Optimal implementation of ARNI therapy
was empirically estimated to prevent 28 484 deaths a year (range, 18 230-41 017 deaths per
year).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A substantial number of deaths in the United States could
potentially be prevented by optimal implementation of ARNI therapy. These data support
implementation of evidence into practice in a timely manner because this may have a
material impact on population health among patients with HFrEF.

sources.2,3,6,7 The magnitude of mortality reduction for ARNI
was determined from the PARADIGM-HF trial.2 The number
needed to treat (NNT), standardized to 12 months, was used to
calculatethenumberofpotentiallivessavedperyearwithARNI
therapy, as previously described.3 We also evaluated benefit in
a multiple-way sensitivity analysis, using the analysis-of-
extremes method.8 This approach assigns a lower value and an
upper value, using ±20% relative differences for the number
of patients eligible for treatment and risk reduction variables.
An additional sensitivity analysis was performed, applying ad-
ditional inclusion criteria from the PARADIGM-HF trial based
on natriuretic peptide levels, renal function, ACEI/ARB dos-
ing, and dropouts during the run-in phase.
Results
TheprevalenceofHFis5 700 000casespertheentireUSpopu-
lation, and 48% of these patients have a left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction of less than 40%. Of the 2 736 000 patients with
HFrEF, there were additional exclusions applied for patients
under hospice or comfort care–only measures (4%) and those
receivingcontinuousinotropicagents,requiringventricularas-
sist devices, or requiring urgent heart transplantation (1%). For
the remaining 2 599 200 patients with HFrEF, 7% were ex-
cluded based on contraindications/intolerance of ACEI/ARB/
ARNI, and an additional 5% for having systolic blood pres-
sure of less than 95 mm Hg, leaving 2 287 296 patients as
candidates for ARNI therapy (Figure).
The magnitude of benefit demonstrated with ARNI
therapy incremental to ACEI therapy, along with those for
other evidenced-based HFrEF therapies, are shown in the
Table. The NNT to prevent 1 death, standardized to 12
months, was calculated to be 80.3. The number of deaths
that could potentially be prevented each year with optimal
implementation of ARNI therapy would be 28 484. Multiple-
way sensitivity analyses using the analysis-of-extremes
method yields the range of deaths potentially avoided from a
lower limit of 18 230 to an upper limit of 41 017. Using prod-
uct limit survival rates and actual follow-up times from the
PARADIGM-HF trial yields a NNT of 71.3. Based on this alter-
native NNT value, 32 080 patient deaths could potentially be
prevented each year. Applying additional exclusions (totaling
an additional 35% excluded) based on the PARADIGM-HF
trial entry criteria yields 1 486 742 patients eligible and 18 515
deaths potentially prevented per year.
Discussion
Heart failure continues to result in more than 300 000 deaths
a year, highlighting the need for therapies that provide addi-
tionalbenefitsbeyondpreviouslyestablishedtherapies.5Based
on the findings of this study, if ARNI therapy were compre-
hensively applied to eligible patients with HFrEF in the United
States, then 28 484 deaths per year could be prevented or post-
poned. These findings have significant clinical and public
health implications, providing the first quantification of the
magnitude of the survival benefits at the population level that
may result from full implementation of ARNI therapy for pa-
tients with HFrEF.
Establishing the potential population-level benefits with
optimal implementation of a new HF therapy may be of con-
siderable importance when weighing the extent to which re-
sources should be devoted to implementation of the new
therapy relative to other ongoing national quality-improve-
ment efforts.3 Some have advocated that a substantial period
of time (2-7 years) should pass from when a new therapy is first
approved to when it is routinely prescribed in clinical prac-
tice, allowing for potential issues regarding safety to emerge.9

These findings suggest that there may be substantial down-
sides in delaying implementation of this new therapy in clini-
cal practice, even if subsequent unforeseen safety issues were
to emerge, with potentially tens of thousands of deaths result-
ing that otherwise could have been prevented or postponed
with more timely and complete implementation.
This analysis is based on the premise that the magnitude
of efficacy demonstrated in the PARADIGM-HF trial will
translate into a similar degree of effectiveness when applied
to the population of patients with HFrEF encountered in
clinical practice. Prior observational studies of the clinical
effectiveness of ACEI/ARB therapy suggest that the observed
relative risk reductions are similar to those observed in clini-
cal trials, even in older patients.10 In a study of national pat-
terns of discharge prescription of either ACEI or ARB in Medi-
care patients, the risk-adjusted relative risk reduction in
1-year mortality was 17%, as seen in the clinical trials.10 How-
ever, because the age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid condi-
tions, and other characteristics of patients with HFrEF in
clinical practice do differ from those enrolled in randomized
clinical trials, including the PARADIGM-HF trial, the efficacy
established in this trial may not translate to the same degree
of clinical effectiveness in practice. This may particularly be
the case for patient cohorts not adequately represented in the
trial. In addition, the expected survival benefits of imple-
mentation of ARNI are also fully contingent on being able to
apply this therapy with similar safety, tolerability, and dosing
as achieved in clinical trials.
While this study focused on mortality, ARNI therapy has
been shown to have other clinical benefits that are incremen-
tal to ACEI therapy, including reduced HF hospitalizations
and the possibility of improved health status.2 The adoption
of ARNI therapy would involve a substantial increase in
medication costs, yet HF itself is a costly condition and cost-
effectiveness studies suggest that ARNI therapy may provide
high to intermediate value.11-13 Nevertheless, additional
analyses of the financial implications of implementation at
the population level are warranted.
The limitations of this study include that the proportion
ofpatientseligibleandwithcontraindicationsforARNItherapy
may deviate from the estimates used in this study. Applica-
tion of more restrictive criteria would reduce the number of
patients eligible and projected to benefit. If the broader HFrEF
population has a greater proportion of patients with lesser or
no response to ARNI or who tolerate therapy less well, the po-
tential benefits would be less in real-world use. In the pri-
mary analysis, we accounted for 17% of patients with HFrEF
patients who were ineligible, had contraindications, or were
intolerant to ARNI, yet the actual rates could be higher. Out-
comes other than mortality, adverse events, and the cost-
effectiveness (ie, value) of ARNI therapy were not evaluated,
but they should be evaluated in future studies.
Conclusions
Wehavedemonstratedthepotentialgainsthatmaybeachieved
with the application of ARNI therapy for patients with HFrEF
in the United States. Given the substantial HF burden and po-
tential benefits of implementation for preventing deaths, ef-
fortstoensurecomprehensiveimplementationofARNItherapy
