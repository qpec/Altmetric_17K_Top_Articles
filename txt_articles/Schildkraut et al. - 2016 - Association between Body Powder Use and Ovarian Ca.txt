Abstract
Background: Epidemiologic studies indicate increased ovar-
ian cancer risk among women who use genital powder, but
this has not been thoroughly investigated in African Amer-
ican (AA) women, a group with a high prevalence of use. We
evaluate the relationship between use of genital powder and
nongenital
powder
in
invasive
epithelial
ovarian
cancer
(EOC).
Methods: Subjects are 584 cases and 745 controls enrolled in
the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES), an
ongoing, population-based case–control study of EOC in AA
women in 11 geographic locations in the United States. AA
controls were frequency matched to cases on residence and
age. Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for associations between genital and
nongenital powder exposure and EOC risk, controlling for
potential confounders.
Results: Powder use was common (62.8% of cases and 52.9%
of controls). Genital powder was associated with an increased
risk of EOC (OR ¼ 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11–1.86) and a dose–
response relationship was found for duration of use and
number of lifetime applications (P < 0.05). Nongenital use
was also associated with EOC risk, particularly among non-
serous EOC cases (OR ¼ 2.28; 95% CI, 1.39–3.74). An asso-
ciation between powder use and upper respiratory conditions
suggests an enhanced inflammatory response may explain the
association between body powder and EOC.
Conclusions: In a study of AA women, body powder use was
significantly associated with EOC risk.
Impact: The results support that body powder is a modifiable
risk factor for EOC among AA women. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers

Introduction
Genital powder use may be a modifiable risk factor for
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the most deadly of all gyne-
cologic cancers (1). In 2010, the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) classified perineal (genital) use of
nonasbestos–containing, talc-based body powder as "possi-
bly" carcinogenic to humans (2). Although particles of asbes-
tos have been found in older body powder formulations,
particularly prior to 1976 (3), more recent body powder
formulations no longer contain asbestos (4, 5). However,
the relationship between genital powder use and ovarian
cancer appears to persist (6). It has been proposed that
talc-containing powders may promote cancer development
through local inflammation, increased rates of cell division
and DNA repair, increased oxidative stress, and increased
cytokine levels (7).
A recent pooled analysis of eight population-based case–
control studies demonstrated an elevated OR of 1.24 for the
association between genital powder use and EOC (6). Some
(7–15) but not all (6, 8, 16) previously published studies of talc
and ovarian cancer reported a dose–response relationship with
genital powder use for frequency, duration, or number of
applications. In addition, some studies reported a stronger
association among the most common serous histologic subtype
(4, 10, 14, 16, 17) although the pooled analysis did not confirm
this finding (6). Only one prospective study (17) found a
significant association with ever genital talc use and invasive
serous EOC (RR ¼ 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02–1.91), although no
overall association with EOC was found. The Women's Health
Initiative (WHI; ref. 18) did not detect an association with

 genital talc use and EOC. Neither prospective study found
evidence of a dose–response relationship.
Previous studies of genital powder use have included mostly
white women. However, two studies reported analyses stratified
by race and both found an increased EOC risk among African
American (AA) women who used genital talc (14, 15). One
study reported a nonsignificant association between one or
more years of talc use and risk of ovarian cancer, OR ¼ 1.56,
[95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80–3.04] among a small
sample of 128 AA EOC cases and 143 AA controls, who were
shown to have higher prevalence of talc use compared with
whites (14). A second study reported an imprecise but signif-
icant association with genital talc use with an OR of 5.08 (95%
CI, 1.32–19.6) among a very small sample of 16 cases and 17
controls (15). In this article, we present analyses of the rela-
tionship between both genital powder and nongenital powder
exposure from the African American Cancer Epidemiology
Study (AACES), an ongoing, multicenter case–control study of
invasive EOC in AA women.
Materials and Methods
Study population
AACES is an ongoing, population-based, case–control study of
invasive EOC in AA women in 11 locations (Alabama, Georgia,
Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio,
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas). Institutional review board
approval was obtained from all participating institutions. Meth-
ods have been described in detail elsewhere (19). Briefly, cases
include AA women 20 to 79 years of age with newly diagnosed
EOC. With a goal of enrolling an equal number of cases and
controls, controls were AA women identified through random
digit dialing, with at least one intact ovary and no history of
ovarian cancer, and frequency matched to cases on region of
residence and 5-year age categories. Participants complete a
baseline telephone interview, which includes detailed questions
on demographic characteristics; reproductive, gynecologic, and
medical history; hormone therapy (HT) and oral contraceptive
(OC) use; cancer family history and lifestyle characteristics includ-
ing smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. In an
effort to obtain information from as many women as possible, a
short version of the questionnaire is offered to those who would
otherwise refuse to participate in the study. Accrual began in
December 2010 and as of August 31, 2015, 593 cases and 750
controls were enrolled. Eligibility for this analysis was restricted to
participants for whom data on body powder use and all covariates
were available, resulting in a final sample size of 584 cases and 745
controls; of these, 49 cases and 16 controls completed the short
questionnaire.
Exposure to body powder and talc
In the baseline interview, participants were asked whether
they had ever regularly used talc, cornstarch, baby, or deodor-
izing powders. Participants were considered "regular users" if
they reported using any of these powders at least one time per
month for at least 6 months, and "never users" if they did not.
Regular users were asked about their frequency and duration of
use, age at first use, and whether they applied powders to
genital areas (including on underwear or sanitary napkins, or
on birth control devices like diaphragms) and/or nongenital
areas. Participants were categorized according to their type of
application as nongenital use only, genital use only, or genital
and nongenital use. Lifetime number of applications was
calculated by multiplying the number of body powder applica-
tions per month by the number of months used. Occupational
exposure to talc (yes, no) was available only for subjects
completing the long baseline survey.
Statistical analysis
The prevalence of demographic characteristics was calculated
and t tests and c2 tests were performed to compare distributions
between cases and controls. Because of the relatively small num-
ber of women who reported having only used genital powder (43
cases and 44 controls), we merged this exposure category with
those who reported use of both nongenital and genital powder,
creating an exposure category of "any" genital powder use.
Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was performed
to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for the associations between body
powder exposure ("only" nongenital use, and "any" genital use)
and risk of EOC. Body powder exposure was further examined by
frequency of use (less than 30 times per month, daily), duration of
use categorized as less than the median or the median and greater
among the controls (<20 years, �20 years), and lifetime number
of applications categorized as less than the median or the median
and greater among controls (<3,600, �3,600 lifetime applica-
tions). Trend tests for frequency, duration, and lifetime applica-
tions of powder use by route of exposure were conducted sepa-
rately in two subsamples: only nongenital users plus never users
and any genital users plus never users. For each subsample, each of
the above variables was entered into a logistic regression as
multiple indicator variables representing three levels and two
degrees of freedom (i.e., for frequency of use: no exposure, less
than daily, daily), adjusting for confounders. Trends were eval-
uated by statistical tests for the association between frequency/
duration/lifetime applications with EOC risk, using Wald tests to
simultaneously test the equality of parameter estimates with zero.
Because experimental data suggest a relationship between inhaled
inert particles and asthma (20), a logistic regression analysis was
conducted to determine the association between body powder
use and upper respiratory conditions (yes/no), controlling for
EOC case/control status.
Covariates included reference age in years (age at diagnosis
for cases and age at baseline interview for controls); study site
[Alabama, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, South
Carolina, Texas, Michigan and Illinois (combined because of
sample size and regional similarities), Georgia and Tennessee
(combined because of sample size)]; education (�high school,
some after high school training, college or graduate degree);
parity (0, 1, 2, 3þ); duration of oral contraceptives (never, <60
months, �60 months); history of tubal ligation (yes/no);
family history of breast or ovarian cancer in a first-degree
relative (yes/no); smoking (ever/never); and body mass index
(BMI < 25, 25–29.9, �30 kg/m2). Two class action lawsuits
were filed in 2014 (21) concerning possible carcinogenic effects
of body powder, which may have influenced recall of use.
Therefore, year of interview 2014 or later (yes/no) was included
as a covariate in the logistic regression models. To assess
potential reporting bias, we also examined whether there were
differences in prevalence of reported powder use by interview
year (before 2014, 2014 and later) for cases and controls as well
as whether interview year was an effect modifier of the rela-
tionship between powder use and EOC risk.

 Analyses by the histologic subtype versus all controls were also
conducted and heterogeneity of risk estimates was tested by
seemingly unrelated regression (22). Because of the missing data
for histology, 48 cases were omitted from these analyses. Through
stratified analyses, we also assessed possible effect modification of
the association with powder use and ever use of HT among
postmenopausal women using logistic regression. Experimental
data show that the inflammatory response is enhanced in the
presence of estrogen and progesterone and we therefore tested for
interaction of the association with body powder use by meno-
pausal status (20). Logistic regression and trend analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Descriptive statistics for cases and controls are presented
in Table 1. Cases were older than controls and had lower educa-
tional achievement. Although this study was designed to match
controls to cases by 5-year age group, the difference in the age at
diagnosis/age at interview may, in part, be because the study is
actively enrolling subjects. However, age ranges of cases (20–79
years) and controls (20–79 years) overlap. Significant differences
in the distributions of well-established risk factors, including a
shorter duration of oral contraceptive use, and lower prevalence of
tubal ligation in cases as compared with controls, were as
expected. As expected, parity was lower among cases compared
with controls, but the difference was not significant. In addition,
cases were more likely to report a family history of breast or
ovarian cancer. No significant difference in the median years of
use of body powder or occupational exposure of talc in cases
compared with controls was observed.
Table 2 shows the results of logistic regression models exam-
ining the relationship between any use of body powder (either
"only" nongenital powder or "any" genital powder) as well as the
use of body powder by type of application: "only" nongenital
powder use or "any" genital powder use. Adjusting for potential
confounders, we observed a significant positive association
between any powder use and EOC (OR ¼ 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10–
1.76). The OR for the association with "any" genital powder use
was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.11–1.86). An OR of 1.31 (95% CI, 0.95–
1.79) for the measure of association between "only" nongenital
powder use and EOC was only slightly lower in magnitude
compared with the association when "any" genital use was
reported, but not statistically different from one another (P ¼
0.56). In 2014 and later, we observed an increase in any powder
use of 12% and 6% of cases and controls, respectively. Although
increased, these exposure prevalences were not significantly dif-
ferent from those interviewed before 2014 (P ¼ 0.30). For those
interviewed in 2014 or later, we observed an OR for "any" genital
powder use of 2.91 (95% CI, 1.70–4.97) compared with 1.19
(95% CI, 0.87–1.63) before 2014. We observed a weaker OR
of 1.26 (95% CI, 0.69–2.32) for 2014 and later compared with
1.40 (95% CI, 0.96–2.03) before 2014 for those who reported
"only" nongenital use. A test for effect modification by year of
interview was statistically significant (P ¼ 0.005).
The ORs for the association between daily use of powder for
either "only" nongenital powder use (OR ¼ 1.53; 95% CI, 1.00–
2.35) or "any" genital powder use (OR ¼ 1.71; 95% CI, 1.26–
2.33) with EOC were larger in magnitude than ORs for less than
daily use compared with never use but the test for trend was
significant for only "any" genital powder use (Table 2). There is a
moderately stronger association for �20 years of "any" genital
powder use (OR ¼ 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11–2.06) compared with <20
years of use (OR ¼ 1.33; 95% CI, 0.95–1.86; Ptrend ¼ 0.02). No
dose–response with years of use was detected for "only" nongen-
ital powder use. The ORs for the number of lifetime applications

 of body powder at or above and below the median support a
dose–response with "any" genital powder use (Ptrend < 0.01) but
not for nongenital powder use (Ptrend ¼ 0.14).
A report of any occupational talc exposure, for those com-
pleting the long baseline questionnaire, was found to be
positively, but not statistically significantly, associated with
EOC (OR ¼ 1.31; 95% CI, 0.88–1.93; data not shown). Table 3
shows an OR of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.03–1.85) for the association
in serous cases with "any" genital powder use. Among serous
cases, the OR for "only" nongenital powder use was lower in
magnitude and not significant (OR ¼ 1.10; 95% CI, 0.76–1.58).
Compared with serous cases, larger and statistically significant
ORs are found for the associations with type of powder appli-
cation in nonserous EOC cases; ORs were 1.63 (95% CI, 1.04–
2.55) and 2.28 (95% CI, 1.39–3.74), for "any" genital powder
use and "only" nongenital powder use, respectively (Table 3). A
comparison of adjusted odds ratios between serous and non-
serous histologic subtypes and powder use, detected a differ-
ence in "only" nongenital powder use (P ¼ 0.008), but did not
detect significant differences in association for "any" genital
powder use (P ¼ 0.50).
The stratified results by menopausal status (Table 4) suggest
differences in the association for exposure to "only" nongenital
powder use among premenopausal where no association is
seen for "only" nongenital powder use, whereas the association
with the risk of EOC and "any" genital use is elevated. Among
postmenopausal women, we observed positive associations of
similar magnitude for both the association between EOC and
"only" nongenital powder use (OR ¼ 1.49; 95% CI, 1.04–2.15)
and "any" genital powder use (OR ¼ 1.41; CI, 1.03–1.92).
However, tests of interaction indicate no evidence for interac-
tion by menopausal status for either route of exposure. Among
menopausal women, analyses stratified by HT use suggest a
stronger association among users compared with nonusers of
HT for both routes of applications, although we detected a
borderline, nonsignificant interaction for the associations with
"any" genital body powder by HT use (P ¼ 0.06). The test for
interaction for nongenital body powder by HT use was not
significant (P ¼ 0.76).
To further consider the underlying mechanism for the rela-
tionship between use of body powder and the risk of EOC, we
calculated the association between both "only" nongenital
powder use and "any" genital powder use and having an upper
respiratory condition. Controlling for case–control status, age
at diagnosis/interview, study site, education, smoking, and
BMI, we found ORs of 1.35 (95% CI, 0.89–2.05) and 1.45
(95% CI, 1.03–2.05) for "only" nongenital and "any" genital
powder use, respectively, in relation to a reported respiratory
condition, respectively (data not shown). A nonsignificant, but
elevated OR of 1.26 (95% CI, 0.77–2.06) was observed with
occupational exposure to talc and respiratory conditions (data
not shown).

 Discussion
In the largest EOC case–control study in AA women to date, we
observed a positive association between regular use of powder
and EOC regardless of the route of application. Users of genital
powder were shown to have greater than a 40% increased risk of
EOC compared with an increased risk of more than 30% among
those who used only nongenital powder. The OR for the associ-
ation with genital powder use in the current study is consistent
with the association reported in AA women by Wu and colleagues
(14). Of note, a high proportion of EOC cases (63%) and controls
(53%) reported any use of body powder. A dose–response trend
was evident for median years of use or greater as well as median
number or greater of lifetime applications of "any" genital powder
but not for use of "only" nongenital powder. Our results support
that the association with "any" genital powder use is similar in
premenopausal and postmenopausal women, whereas there
appears to be an association with use of "only" nongenital powder
use among postmenopausal but not premenopausal women.
Associations were found among nonserous EOC cases and among
postmenopausal users of HT exposed to either genital or non-
genital powder.
Most previous case–control studies have not found an asso-
ciation between nongenital powder use and ovarian cancer,
including a large pooled analysis by Terry and colleagues who
reported an adjusted OR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.89–1.07; refs. 6,
16). No prospective studies have evaluated nongenital powder
use, nor has any study examined these associations by histo-
logic subtype (17, 18). In the current study, the overall asso-
ciation with nongenital use and EOC was similar to that for
genital powder use though it did not reach statistical signifi-
cance possibly due to small numbers and random variation.
However, we also did not find a dose–response relationship
with frequency, duration, or lifetime applications of "only"
nongenital powder use. Furthermore, we did not detect a
significant association with use of "only" nongenital powder
among serous cases, whereas the OR for the association with
use of "only" nongenital powder showed over a 2-fold signif-
icant increased risk for nonserous EOC. In fact, we found a
statistically significant difference between associations by sub-
type for "only" nongenital use. Given the inconsistency with
previous published findings, it is also reasonable that under-
reporting genital powder use, such as abdominal powder use
that reaches the genital area, may have led to a spurious result.
Another possible explanation for our finding may be that there
is a higher inflammatory response in AAs compared with whites
(23–25). Our results also suggest that the route of powder
exposure may have different effects by histologic subtype. As
most high-grade serous EOC, but not nonserous subtypes, arise
in the fallopian tubes (26), it is possible that direct exposure
through the genital tract specifically affects this disease subtype.
The association with any genital powder use and nonserous
cases may be due to the overlap between genital and nongenital
powder use (83% of cases and 83% of controls). We were
unable to examine associations with "only" genital powder
users due to sample size considerations. In contrast, nongenital
powder use may be related to inhalation of the exposure
through the lungs. Several large pooled analyses have demon-
strated risk factor associations with inflammatory-associated
exposures, such as smoking (27), endometriosis (28), and
obesity (29) with nonserous histologic subtypes of ovarian
cancer but not high-grade serous EOC, providing a plausible
theoretical basis for differences we found in associations by
histologic subtype.
Akin to talc powders, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is another
inert particle that induces an inflammatory response upon
inhalation and has been considered to be "possibly carcino-
genic to humans" by IARC (2). Experimental evidence of
enhanced inflammation due to exposure to inert environmen-
tal particulates of TiO2 showed inhibition of phagocytic activity
of alveolar macrophages in pregnancy, and was found to be
associated with increased asthma risk in the offspring of BALB/
c mice exposed to TiO2. In this study, elevated estrogen levels
during pregnancy were found to contribute to the resulting
asthma risk (20). Our findings also support that enhanced
airway inflammation is due to exposure to inert particles.

 Consistent with a recent study (15) where an association with
powder use and asthma was reported, the relationship between
body powder use and respiratory conditions likely reflects an
enhanced inflammatory response due to powder use, suggest-
ing a mechanism by which EOC risk is increased. Therefore,
lung inhalation of powder could be a biologically plausible
mechanism for the association between nongenital body pow-
der use and increased EOC risk, particularly in nonserous EOC
cases.
To further explore whether estrogen influences the inflam-
matory response, we performed stratified analyses by meno-
pausal status. We did not see a difference in the association with
premenopausal compared with postmenopausal use of "any"
genital powder use, which is not consistent with a recent report
(15) where an association with premenopausal use but not
postmenopausal use was found. However, consistent with this
report, we found a stronger association between "any" genital
powder use and EOC among postmenopausal women who
reported HT use compared with nonusers. This finding is also
consistent with experimental data showing that in the presence
of estrogen and/or estrogen and progesterone, the ability of
macrophages to clear inert particulates is altered, enhancing the
inflammatory response leading to the development of asthma
in mouse offspring (20). It has also been proposed that chronic
inflammation, resulting from exposure to body powder, wheth-
er through inhalation or through a transvaginal route, may
exert a suppressive effect on adaptive immunity, leading to
increased risk of EOC (30). These findings suggest that AA
women may be particularly susceptible to exposure to body
powder due to having higher endogenous estrogen levels com-
pared with white women (31, 32). Because of the limited
sample size, we were not able to evaluate associations with
the timing or duration of HT use or the concurrent effects of
both HT and powder use. Tests for interaction of the associa-
tions in the stratified analyses by HT use were not significant
and our findings should be considered exploratory.
The results of the current study showed that genital powder use
was associated with ovarian cancer risk in AA women and are
consistent with localized chronic inflammation in the ovary due
to particulates that travel through a direct transvaginal route. The
dose–response observed for duration of genital powder use
provides further evidence for the relationship between genital
powder and overall EOC risk. Our data suggest that the increased
risk due to use of genital powder applies to both serous and
nonserous histologic subtypes of EOC. Use of "only" nongenital
powder was not found to be associated with the serous subtype,
but our data suggest a relationship with nonserous EOC. The
association with serous EOC is consistent with several previous
studies (4, 6, 14–17). Only the pooled analysis found associations
with the endometrioid and clear cell subtypes (6). The association
with any occupational talc exposure and EOC (OR ¼ 1.31; data
not shown), though not statistically significant, is also consistent
with the results for "only" nongenital powder use and suggest
other routes of exposure, aside transvaginal, may effect EOC risk.
A recent publication of data from the WHI, which did not find
an association with genital talc use and ovarian cancer (18), was
accompanied by an editorial that emphasized the challenges in
assessing the exposure to talc due to the reliance on self-report
(33). This limitation in the measurement of theexposure variables
in the current study needs to be considered when interpreting our
results. The possibility of differential misclassification exists in a
case–control study such as AACES, especially due to heightened
awareness of the exposure as a result of two recent class action
lawsuits (21). Because of such publicity, we adjusted for date of
interview in the analysis. However, there is still a possibility that
recall bias may have caused some inflation of the ORs. Although
our findings suggest that the publicity of the class action lawsuits
may have resulted in increased reporting of body powder use, our
data do not support that recall bias alone before 2014 versus 2014
or later would account for the associations with body powder use
and EOC. It is possible that the lawsuits sharpened memories of
body powder use and improved the accuracy of reported use for
both cases and controls interviewed in 2014 or later. As the
association with nongenital body powder use is not consistent
with the published literature, the possibility of misclassification of
exposure, residual confounding, or a chance finding cannot be
ruled out as an explanation for the associations with nongenital
powder use.
In summary, we found that the application of genital powder is
associated with serous and nonserous EOC in AA women, a novel
observation in this population that is consistent with some large
studies in whites. Our data are consistent with the notion that
localized chronic inflammation in the ovary caused by exposure
to genital powder contributes to the development of EOC.
Although associations with nongenital powder use and EOC have
not been previously reported, we cannot rule out the possibility
that this relationship may be specific to AA women. The high
prevalence of exposure to both genital and nongenital body
powder among AA women compared with the mostly white
subjects (41%), as in the large pooled analysis (6), underscores
the importance of the study's findings. The results of the current
study suggest that the use of body powder is an especially
important modifiable risk factor for EOC in AA women.
