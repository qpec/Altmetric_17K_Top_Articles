Visual Abstract
When intentionally pushed or insulted, one can either flee from
the provoker or retaliate. The implementation of such fight-or-
flight decisions is a central aspect in the genesis and evolution
of aggression episodes, yet it is usually investigated only
indirectly or in nonsocial situations. In the present fMRI study,
we aimed to distinguish brain regions associated with aggres-
sive and avoidant responses to interpersonal provocation in
humans. Participants (thirty-six healthy young women) could
either avoid or face a highly (HP) and a lowly (LP) provoking
opponent in a competitive reaction time task: the fight-or-
escape (FOE) paradigm. Subjects avoided the HP more often,
but retaliated when facing her. Moreover, they chose to fight
the HP more quickly, and showed increased heart rate (HR)
right before confronting her. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and
sensorimotor cortex were more active when participants de-
cided to fight, whereas the mentalizing network was engaged
when deciding to avoid. Importantly, avoiding the HP relative
to the LP was associated with both higher activation in the
right basolateral amygdala and lower relative activity in several
mentalizing regions [e.g., medial and inferior frontal gyrus
(IFG), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)]. These results suggest
that avoidant responses to provocation might result from
heightened threat anticipation and are associated with re-
Significance Statement
Much research has focused on why individuals react aggressively to provocation, but it is also crucial to understand
why they avoid confrontation. Here, we investigated the neural basis of aggressive and avoidant responses to
interpersonal provocation. Brain regions typically recruited when thinking about others’ intentions were activated
when avoiding an encounter, but less so against a highly provoking rival. The basolateral amygdala, a structure
involved in rapid threat detection, was more active when participants avoided a highly provoking opponent. This
indicates that provocation increases threat anticipation, thereby leading to cognitive and behavioral disengagement.
Our study thus identifies plausible neuropsychological processes underlying avoidant and aggressive reactions to
provocation and helps to resolve inconsistencies in the neuroscientific literature on aggression.

 duced perspective taking. Furthermore, our study helps to reconcile conflicting findings on the role of the
mentalizing network, the amygdala, and the OFC in aggression.
Introduction
Human aggression is a complex social behavior with a
profound personal and societal impact (Waters et al.,
2005). Since many instances of aggression are triggered
by perceived provocation (Anderson and Bushman,
2002), many studies have investigated the social and
biological factors by which individuals retaliate when pro-
voked (Nelson and Trainor, 2007; Coccaro et al., 2011).
However, it is just as pertinent to inquire into why individ-
uals would avoid confrontation, as this could provide cues
on how to prevent escalation (Anderson et al., 2008). This
point has been hitherto largely overlooked. Investigating
both aggressive and avoidant responses to provocation,
as well as their neurobiological underpinnings, should
thus help to predict the occurrence and development of
aggression episodes, and ideally inform preventive and
management strategies for aggressive behavior (DeWall
et al., 2011).
In laboratory aggression studies, participants are typi-
cally exposed to interpersonal threat or provocation (e.g.,
insults, mild electroshocks) delivered by an ostensible
opponent, and experimenters measure to which extent
they retaliate. Unfortunately, a nonaggressive option is
not always available (Tedeschi and Quigley, 1996). Even
when there is one, it usually implies not responding at all,
hence not really mimicking a retreat strategy (Ritter and
Eslea, 2005). Another line of research focuses on active
escape, i.e., instances in which individuals must perform a
task to avoid a threat. There are many studies on active
escape in both humans (Mobbs et al., 2007; Mobbs et al.,
2009; Löw et al., 2015) and rodents (Bravo-Rivera et al.,
2015; Ramirez et al., 2015; Campese et al., 2016), but in
these cases, threat cues are often nonsocial, subjects
cannot retaliate, and avoidance, when possible, is exclu-
sively performance dependent. At best, these tasks mimic
encounters with predators, but not reciprocal aggressive
interactions with conspecifics (Gross and Canteras,
2012).
In rodents, a circuit formed by the medial amygdala, the
ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothala-
mus, and the dorsomedial periaqueductal gray (PAG) is
thought to detect danger cues from conspecifics, thereby
triggering innate defensive responses (Gross and Can-
teras, 2012). Indeed, conspecific aggression can be op-
togenetically controlled by stimulating or silencing these
areas (Falkner and Lin, 2014; Miczek et al., 2015; Unger
et al., 2015; Falkner et al., 2016). This neural mechanism
is roughly conserved in humans, although the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an arguably more promi-
nent role therein (Panksepp, 2011; Yu et al., 2014). Spe-
cifically, it has been suggested that mPFC encodes social
dominance in concert with other brain areas involved in
social cognition such as the temporal-parietal junction
(TPJ) or the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) among others (Zink
et al., 2008; Bault et al., 2011; Mason et al., 2014). Cru-
cially, Ligneul et al. (2016) have recently shown that vic-
tories against a better-performing opponent recruit the
mPFC, and that electrically upregulating this region po-
tentiates dominance-based decisions. Taken together,
these findings suggest that avoidant and aggressive re-
sponses to provocation might partly rely on social-
cognitive processes.
In a previous fMRI study, researchers measured fear
potentiation (FP) of the startle response as a measure of
emotional reactivity to threat, and then set participants to
play the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), an extensively
employed competitive reaction time task, against two
purported opponents (Beyer et al., 2014b). In line with the
results commented in the previous paragraph, partici-
pants with higher FP had lower activity in brain areas
involved in understanding others such as mPFC, TPJ,
precuneus, or IFG (Schurz et al., 2014) when confronting
a highly provoking opponent. This pattern of activity in the
so-called mentalizing network suggested that individuals
high in threat reactivity cognitively disengage from the
situation when provoked. This effect was nevertheless
unrelated to behavior, presumably because participants
did not have the chance to escape and thus overtly
manifest their avoidant tendencies.
Here, we developed a version of the TAP that incorpo-
rates an avoidance option: the fight-or-escape (FOE)
paradigm. Using the FOE, we investigated the neural
correlates of aggressive and avoidant decisions against a
highly and a lowly provoking opponent. Behaviorally, we
expected that participants would be more aggressive
against the highly provoking (HP) than the lowly provoking
(LP), but would avoid the former more often. Drawing on
the studies commented, we had two main hypotheses
concerning brain activity. On a within-participant basis,
we expected a disengagement of mentalizing regions
when avoiding the HP compared with the LP. On a
between-participant basis, we hypothesized that lower
reactivity to provocation in mentalizing regions, reflecting
cognitive disengagement from the aggressive interaction,

would be stronger for participants high in trait avoidance.
Materials and Methods
Participants
We recruited only female participants to circumvent
possible
gender
differences
in
competitiveness
and
approach-avoidance motivation (Kivikangas et al., 2014).
We gathered participants through flyers and emails from
the local student population. One participant was ex-
cluded due to excessive head movements (�3 mm in any
direction) and three because they guessed that the para-
digm was preprogrammed. Hence, the sample was com-
prised of 36 participants (mean age � 22, SD � 4) who
reported to be free of psychiatric or neurologic disorders.
The study was approved by the university Ethics Commit-
tee and performed in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Subjects provided informed consent, and were
compensated for participation.
Procedure
On each measurement, we met participants as well as
two female confederates. We told them they would play
an interactive game with each other, which one of them
would play from inside the scanner, and the other two with
laptops connected to the scanner. Participant and con-
federates read the instructions together, and then the
participant was taken to the scanner. We placed an MR-
compatible pulse oximeter in the thumb of the left hand
(see below, Heart rate [HR] data acquisition). After four
practice trials, the functional measurement took place
(�30 min). The paradigm was presented through scanner-
compatible goggles, with diopter-matched lenses if re-
quired. Participants’ responses were recorded with two
4-button devices strapped to their waist. After the TAP,
participants fulfilled a series of questionnaires, plus two
computerized tasks (see below, Computerized and self-
report measures).
The FOE paradigm
The task was developed as a variant of the TAP (Taylor,
1967). The TAP is a widely used competitive reaction time
task that elicits aggression through provocation. Here, we
operationalized provocation as an aversive sound blast
(i.e., a styrofoam scratching noise). In this version of the
TAP, which we called FOE paradigm, participants faced
each of the two purported opponents in alternating order,
and had the option to avoid a limited number of trials.
In the escape phase (6 s), participants were informed of
which of the two opponents they were playing with and
had to choose whether to avoid the encounter. If they did,
they waited until the next trial (7 s � inter-trial interval).
They could do so a maximum of 5 out of the 20 trials in
each of the three runs. They played equally often against
each opponent. If they did not avoid, they had to select
the loudness of a sound blast (scale 1-8) to be later
directed at their purported opponent (selection phase,
3 s). This was followed by the reaction time task (2 s), in
which they had to press a button quicker than the rival
when a jittered target (0.5 s) appeared. In the outcome
phase (2 s), they were informed of whether they had won
or lost and of the opponent’s punishment selection. If they
lost, they also received the corresponding sound blast.
The inter-trial interval (10–12 s) had a randomized variable
length (Fig. 1).
The task was preprogrammed such that participants
lost two thirds of the trials, equally distributed against
both opponents. One opponent selected on average
higher punishments (high punisher, HP; range 4–8) than
the other (low punisher, LP; range 1–5). The cover story
was set in the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) universe (Tolkien,
1954) to engage participants and to make the task easier
to understand. Participants were told that they would play
as Frodo (protagonist of the novel), and that the oppo-
nents would play as Sauron and Saruman (antagonists).
The avoidance option was phrased as “putting the Ring
on” because said ring confers invisibility to its wearer in
Figure 1. Example trials of the FOE paradigm. Participants confronted a HP and a LP opponent alternatingly. In the escape phase,
they could choose whether to fight (upper row) or avoid the encounter (lower row). Fighting led to the punishment selection phase,
followed by a reaction time task in which they had to press any button faster than their alleged opponent. In the outcome phase,
participants were informed of whether they won or lost and, in the latter case, received the corresponding sound blast through the
headphones. If they chose to avoid the trial, they had a short pause. Avoidance decisions were limited to 5 out of 20 trials per run
(three runs in total). The fixation cross is only depicted for the avoidance trial, but appeared between all trials regardless of the
participant’s decision. For details, see Materials and Methods.

 the LOTR mythology (Tolkien, 1954). The targets in the
reaction time task were three orc pictures from the LOTR
movies, presented in random order. For half of the par-
ticipants the HP was Sauron, and for the other half it was
Saruman. The maximal loudness of the sound blast was
adapted to each participant’s tolerance. The paradigm
was programmed and implemented in Presentation (ver-
sion 16.5, www.neurobs.com, RRID: SCR_002521).
Computerized and self-report measures
Approach-avoidance task (AAT)
This task was used to measure approach-avoidance
motor responses to threat and reward signals, which were
operationalized as happy and angry faces, respectively
(Roelofs et al., 2009; Volman et al., 2011). Participants
played with a joystick (Speedlink Dark Tornado), which
they either had to pull or push when seeing a happy or an
angry face, depending on the condition. The size of the
faces was gradually increased in size when pushing and
decreased when pulling, giving the impression that the
images approached or receded. Participants should thus
be slower to pull angry faces “toward them,” and slower
to push happy faces “away,” allowing to calculate an
avoidant bias score from reaction times (Roelofs et al.,
2005).
Pictures were extracted from the Radboud Faces Da-
tabase (Langner et al., 2010). We used photographs of 30
persons (15 female), each showing an angry facial expres-
sion in one picture, and a happy expression in the other.
Pictures of nine different individuals (four female) were
used for practice blocks. The pictures were cropped into
an oval shape, removing hair, ears and neck.
In a first block, participants had to pull happy faces
toward them, and push angry faces away. In a second
block, the rule was reversed. The size of the faces was
increased or decreased in seven gradual steps. Images
had an initial size of 6 cm (�7.6° of the visual angle), and
could be shrunk to 2 cm (�1.2°) or enlarged to 22 cm
(�13.9°). Each trial started by pressing the joystick’s trig-
ger button, and a central fixation cross of was presented
between trials. Each block consisted of 30 happy and 30
angry trials, and we used the same pictures in both
blocks. Each block was preceded by a practice run, in
which feedback was provided: a green check-mark for
correct reactions, and a red cross for errors. The practice
run for the first block consisted of 20 trials, whereas the
second consisted of 28 trials because participants had to
learn the reverse rule. No feedback was provided during
the task proper.
The main outcome measure was the response latency
until the first movement. We rejected trials in which the
first movement was in the wrong direction, as well as trials
with responses shorter than 150 ms or longer than twice
the participant’s own standard deviation. We calculated
an implicit avoidant bias as the pull-push reaction time
difference in angry trials, and an implicit approach bias as
the pull-push reaction time difference in happy trials (Ro-
elofs et al., 2009). Reaction times per condition were push
angry: 573 � 8 ms (main � SE), pull angry: 644 � 16 ms,
push happy: 630 � 15 ms, pull happy: 577 � 10 ms.
Dot-probe paradigm (DPP)
The DPP is a well-established measure of attentional
avoidance (MacLeod et al., 1986). In the version em-
ployed here, participants were presented with an angry
and a neutral face, which were followed by a target (a dot)
appearing either on the right or the left side of the screen.
In half of the trials, the target was presented in the former
position of the angry face (congruent condition) and in the
other half in the previous location of the neutral face
(incongruent condition). As individuals tend to initially al-
locate attention to threatening stimuli and then look away
(Cooper and Langton, 2006), we programmed the task
with a long exposition time (1 s) to measure this general
avoidant bias.
Face stimuli were 40 pictures extracted from a set of
previously validated videos (Kircher et al., 2013). The
pictures were stills of 20 professional actors (nine women)
displaying angry and neutral facial expressions. In each
trial, two pictures of the same person with a neutral and an
angry expression were presented together, to the left and
right of the screen center.
Each trial began with a fixation cross being presented
for a jittered interval between 500 and 1000 ms. Then, two
pictures (4.5 cm/�3.6° each) of one person with a neutral
and angry expression were presented for 1000 ms. At
picture offset, a dot appeared to the left or right, at the
position where the center of the corresponding picture
had been. Participants were instructed to react as quickly
as possible to the dot, by pressing the A key on the
computer keyboard if the dot was presented on the left,
and L if it was presented on the right side.
Participants completed 80 trials in each of the two
blocks. Each picture pair was presented four times with
the following configurations: angry face and target on the
left (congruent); angry face and target on the right (con-
gruent); angry face on the left, target on the right (incon-
gruent); angry face on the right, target on the left
(incongruent). Scores were calculated as the difference in
reaction time between congruent and incongruent correct
trials, such that higher values would indicate attentional
avoidance of the threatening stimulus. Reaction times per
condition were: congruent: 391 � 10 ms, and incongru-
ent: 390 � 11 ms.
Both computerized tasks were run in Presentation (ver-
sion 17.2, www.neurobs.com) on a Dell Latitude E6400.
The monitor had a resolution of 1440 � 900 pixels and a
60 Hz refresh rate. Participants’ head was at a distance of
�90 cm from the screen during the AAT and �70 cm
during the DPP (the joystick was removed and the com-
puter was brought closer for the DPP).
Questionnaires
Participants fulfilled the harm avoidance (HA) scale from
the revised temperament and character inventory (TCI-R)
in German (Brändström et al., 2003), a dichotomous 35-
item measure with four subscales: anticipatory worry, fear
of uncertainty, shyness, and fatigability. We also used the
German version of Carver and White’s BIS scale (Strobel
et al., 2001), which is based on Gray’s biopsychological
theory of personality and is thought to measure punish-
ment sensitivity and general avoidant tendencies. The

 scale employed here has sevven items, scored on a 1–4
(“completely disagree” to “completely agree”) Likert
scale. In addition, participants fulfilled the German version
of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Stangier and
Heidenreich, 2005), which uses a 4-point scale to mea-
sure fear (“none” to “severe”) and avoidance (“never” to
“usually”) of different social situations.
We used a questionnaire to check whether the experi-
mental manipulation had succeeded. Participants rated
the unpleasantness of the highest and lowest tones (scale
1–8), and the fairness of their two opponents (1–8). We
assessed whether they had been successfully deceived
with three qualitative questions (“Have you noticed any-
thing special in the opponents’ behavior?”; “Have you
followed any specific strategy during the game?”; and
“What do you think this study investigated?”) and in the
debriefing. In addition, we administered the 27-item Ger-
man version of the aggression questionnaire (AQ; Herz-
berg, 2003), an ad hoc translated German version of the
revised competitiveness index (RCI; Harris and Houston,
2010) with 14 items, and one extra question inquiring on
weekly hours of videogame use. Scores for all question-
naires were: BIS: 19.92 � 0.60, LSAS-Fear: 15.44 � 1.65,
LSAS-Avoidance: 14 � 1.72, HA: 12.56 � 1.01, RCI-
Competitiveness: 28.03 � 1.17, RCI-Contentiousness:
15.25 � 0.63, and AQ: 2.00 � 0.06. The internal consis-
tency of all scales was satisfactory (� � [0.780, 0.961]).
Heart rate (HR) data acquisition
Photoplethysmography was performed with an in vivo
Precess Model 3160 pulse oximeter attached to the
thumb of the left hand. The device had the following
technical specifications: saturation precision � 70–100%
� 3%, pulse range � 30–240 bpm � 3 bpm, pulse
accuracy � �3, LED1 wavelength � 663 nm, LED2 wave-
length � 948 nm, LED1 output power � 66.9 uW, LED2
output power � 39.1 uW, pulse duration � 6.06 � 10�4 s.
Neuroimaging data acquisition
We acquired all scans with a 32-channel head coil
mounted on a Philips Ingenia 3.0T scanner supporting
gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI). We obtained ana-
tomic images with a T1-weighted EPI sequence (180
sagittal slices, TR � 7.7, TE � 3.5, FOV � 240, matrix �
240 � 240 mm, flip angle � 8°, voxel size � 1 mm
isotropic). For functional scans, we used a T2�-weighted
EPI scanning protocol sensitive to changes in the blood-
oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal (47 axial slices per
volume, TR � 2.5 s; TE � 25 ms; FOV � 200 mm, matrix
� 80 � 80 mm; flip angle � 90°; voxel size � 2.5 mm
isotropic). The beginning of each trial of the task (see
above, The FOE paradigm) was timed to coincide with the
start of a volume to reduce sampling variability in the
escape phase, our main epoch of interest. We recorded
three consecutive runs of 216 volumes each (i.e., 9 min
per run), with five dummy scans at the start of each run to
permit steady-state tissue magnetization.
Behavioral data analysis
We first calculated the cumulative proportion of sub-
jects who used up all avoidance options in each trial,
which provides information on participants’ overall strat-
egy (i.e., whether they exhausted all avoidance options
early in the run or saved them for later trials). Subsequent
inferential statistics were computed with linear mixed-
effect models (LMMs, also known as hierarchical or mul-
tilevel models), which are appropriate for unbalanced data
and permit to model trial-wise behavior (Baayen et al.,
2008; Aarts et al., 2015). These analyses were performed
with the lmerTest package version 2.0–33 (Kuznetsova
et al., 2015) implemented in R version 3.1.3. First, we
tested the effects of provocation (coded as 0 � low, 1 �
high) and run (coded as �1, 0, and 1 for runs one to three)
on aggression and avoidance. Provocation and run were
defined as fixed-effect factors, whereas subject was de-
fined as a random factor. Additionally, we ran a LMM on
trial-wise response latencies in the escape phase with
factors decision (coded as 0 � fight, 1 � avoid), run, and
provocation, aiming to test whether participants took more
time to choose the avoidance or fight options against one or
the other opponent. In this model, decision was defined as a
participant random-effect variable. We also modeled reac-
tion times in the punishment selection phase and in the
reaction time task with factors provocation and run. For
avoidance, we fitted a generalized LMM (function glmer) with
a logit link function for binomial outcomes, whereas all other
variables were modeled with standard LMMs (function lmer)
for continuous outcomes. We report parameter estimates (b)
and their associated statistics (t/Z and p values) for all
LMMs. Where appropriate, we performed pairwise post hoc
t/Z tests (Tukey-adjusted for multiple comparisons) with the
function lsmeans (Lenth, 2016). The means/proportions and
SEs extracted with lsmeans were used to plot the observed
effects.
Regarding self-report data, we first analyzed the ma-
nipulation check. We inspected whether participants
rated the lowest and the highest tone differently, and
whether they perceived the high punisher as less fair than
the low punisher by means of paired t tests. Finally, we
tested whether the mean difference in avoidance or ag-
gression between the high and low provoker (i.e., the
provocation effect) was related to any of the avoidance or
control measures with Pearson correlation coefficients.
We only used questionnaires’ total scores, and not sub-
scales, to avoid inflating the number of tests. Only mea-
sures related to avoidance or aggression were used to
explore further brain-behavior relationships. Significance
was set at p � 0.05 (uncorrected). These analyses were
performed with built-in R functions.
HR data analysis
We visually inspected the HR data for artifacts, which
left 30 participants with complete usable data. We re-
moved linear drifts with the detrend function from MAT-
LAB R2015b and computed HR change as the pulse
count difference between the 1 s prestimulus baseline
and each second of the escape and selection phases
(Bradley et al., 2001). Since we expected an initial freezing
response to provocation (Lang and Bradley, 2013), we
extracted the maximum deceleration (i.e., the minimum
value) across the duration of the escape phase for each

eNeuro.org
 trial. We then ran a series of LMMs on these scores with
within-subject factors decision, run, and provocation as
we did for behavioral data. In the selection phase, we
expected to observe a preparatory HR acceleration (van
Honk et al., 2001), and so we extracted the maximum
acceleration in HR relative to baseline. In this case, we
fitted a run by provocation LMM.
Neuroimaging data analysis
We used Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM 12;
Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Univer-
sity College London, London, UK, RRID: SCR_007037)
implemented in MATLAB R2015b for the analysis of neu-
roimaging data. We first realigned all scans manually
according to the anterior-posterior commissure. We ap-
plied standard preprocessing steps, namely slice-timing
correction to the middle slice, realignment to the first
functional volume, coregistration of anatomic and mean
functional images, segmentation of the anatomic image
with the standard SPM12 “Segment” function (known as
“New Segment” in SPM8), normalization to the native
voxel size in Montreal Neurologic Insitute (MNI) space,
and smoothing with an 8 mm full width at half maximum
(FWHM) Gaussian kernel.
We then fitted two first level models to answer our
different research questions. In all cases, regressors in the
escape phase were defined to be 6 s long. In a first model,
we specified two regressors in the escape phase and two
in the selection phase for high and low provocation trials,
as well as four 3-s regressors in the outcome phase (won
and lost against the high and low provoker). We also
modeled the reaction time task (onset of the target), the
sound of the punishment in lost trials, and movement
parameters derived from realignment as regressors of no
interest. The onset of motor responses (i.e., button
presses) rather than reaction times were also included as
nuisance regressors, since modeling the latter can re-
move genuine decision-related activity (Grinband et al.,
2008). Regressors were convolved with the canonical
hemodynamic response function, and we applied a 128-s
high-pass filter to remove signal drifts, as well as SPM’s
autoregressive function.
To test for differential brain reactivity to the high relative
to low provocation, we performed one sample t tests
contrasting high versus low trials in the escape phase. In
addition, we performed multiple regression analyses to
probe whether avoidance could predict brain reactivity to
provocation across participants. Hence, we regressed
brain activity in the high � low contrast in the escape
phase against the provocation effect for avoidance (i.e.,
difference in number of avoided trials between HP and
LP). Although our focus was on the escape phase, we also
analyzed the selection and outcome phases. In the selec-
tion phase, we compared high versus low provocation,
and regressed the behavioral provocation effect for ag-
gression (i.e., difference in mean punishment selections
between HP and LP) on this contrast. In the outcome
phase, we conducted a flexible factorial analysis with
factors won versus lost and high versus low provocation,
and tested both main effects (won � lost, lost � won, high
� low, low � high) and the interaction (won high � won
low: lost low � lost high and won low � won high: lost
high � lost low) with t tests.
In a second set of analyses, we investigated brain
activity associated with fight versus avoidance decisions,
and whether these could be modulated by provocation.
In these analyses, we only included participants who
avoided each opponent at least once in the same run (n �
27). We did so for two reasons. First, including partici-
pants with too few trials can reduce statistical power
when conducting ANOVA on unbalanced data (Tibon and
Levy, 2015). By including only participants who avoided
both opponents in the same run we ensured that a mini-
mum amount of avoidance trials per run (i.e., 2 out of 20
or 10%) was modeled and thereby achieved higher power
to detect avoidance-related effects. Such an approach
is common practice in fMRI studies conducting perfor-
mance-dependent contrasts (Rodehacke et al., 2014; Ma-
dipakkam et al., 2015; Marchewka et al., 2016). Second,
this procedure permits to create a balanced second level
design, which ensures orthogonality between the different
effects (McFarquhar, 2016). First-level models were fitted
identically as before, but included four regressors in the
escape phase defined by participants’ decision: avoid
high, avoid low, fight high, and fight low. Pauses (7 s)
when using the avoidance option were also modeled
separately for the HP and the LP. If participants used up
all avoidance options in a given run, the escape phase
was modeled as a pause, since there was no decision to
be taken. If they never decided to avoid or avoided only
one opponent in a given run, that run was excluded from
the analysis. At the second level we performed a flexible
factorial ANOVA with factors decision (avoid vs fight) and
provocation (high versus low). Given that there were con-
siderably less avoidance than fight trials, we assumed
unequal variance between the levels of this factor. We
then tested the main effects of decision (avoid � fight and
fight � avoid) and its interaction with provocation (avoid
high � avoid low: fight low � fight high and avoid low �
avoid high: fight high � fight low).
In all analyses, we applied a whole-brain family-wise
error (FWE) corrected threshold of p � 0.05 at the cluster
level with a cluster-forming threshold of p � 0.001 (un-
corrected). Anatomic regions were labeled according to
the atlases implemented in xjView (http://www.alivelearn.
net/xjview8/, RRID: SCR_008642). We extracted mean
parameter estimates for each condition within a 7.5-mm
radius sphere (i.e., three voxels) around the peak of sig-
nificant clusters for data visualization using MarsBar
(http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/, RRID: SCR_009605).
Results
Behavioral and self-report results
Participants rated the loudest tone as more distressing
than the lowest one (t35 � 18.03, p � 0.001), and per-
ceived the HP to be less fair than the LP (t35 � 9.20, p �
0.001). No �25% of participants (i.e., 9 out of 36) used up
all avoidance options in any run. Furthermore, participants
tended to exhaust avoidance options toward the end of
each run (Fig. 2A).

 As predicted, participants were more likely to avoid the
HP than the LP (b � 0.50, Z � 4.00, p � 0.001; Fig. 2B).
In the punishment selection phase, they selected higher
punishments against the HP compared with the LP (b �
0.69, t1806 � 8.86, p � 0.001; Fig. 2C). There were no main
effects of run (both p � 0.097). The run by provocation
interaction was significant for punishment selections
(b � 0.32, t1804.4 � 3.40, p � 0.001) and near-significant
for avoidance (b � 0.29, Z � 1.91, p � 0.055). Hence,
we compared avoidance and aggression scores for
high versus low provocation in each run to clarify
whether participants learned the difference between
both opponents over time. For avoidance, the differ-
ence between the HP and the LP was significant in the
second (Z � 2.12, p � 0.033) and third runs (Z � 3.65,
p � 0.001), but not in the first (p � 0.282). For aggres-
sion, it was significant in all runs (run 1: t1802.60 � 2.40,
p � 0.016, run 2: t1802.87 � 5.67, p � 0.001; run 3:
t1802.60 � 7.22, p � 0.001). The increasing effect sizes
indicate that the provocation effect became stronger
over time for both avoidance and aggression.
Participants were generally quicker to decide in the
escape phase when facing the HP than the LP (b �
�0.09, t2091.9 � �3.34, p � 0.001) and over time (b �
�0.08, t2085.9 � �3.55, p � 0.001). Importantly, we found
a significant interaction (b � 0.21, t2067.20 � 2.70, p �
0.006) between provocation and decision (Fig. 2D), such
that participants were faster to choose the fight option
against the HP than the LP (t2082.95 � 3.23, p � .001), but
took a comparable amount of time to avoid each oppo-
nent (p � 0.112). There were no other main effects or
interactions (all p � 0.265).
Reaction times in the punishment selection phase were
unaffected by run or provocation (p � 0.123 for main
effect and interaction). In the reaction time task partici-
pants became faster over runs (b � �0.02, t1804 � �2.58,

 p � 0.009), but there were no main or interactive effects of
provocation (both p � .634).
DPT scores, avoidance scores in the AAT, personality
and control measures were not associated with the prov-
ocation effect for either avoidance or aggression (all p �
0.178). However, participants who rated the HP as more
unfair than the LP showed stronger provocation effects
for both avoidance (r � 0.40, p � 0.015) and aggression
(r � 0.52, p � 0.001). Furthermore, participants with a
higher approach bias in the AAT (i.e., those who were
faster to pull relative to push happy faces) were, at trend
level, less avoidant (r � �0.32, p � 0.054) and more
aggressive (r � 0.32, p � 0.052) when facing the HP
relative to the LP.
Heart rate results
Regarding the escape phase, we found no differences
between opponents in heart rate (HR) reactivity (p �
0.362), nor a run by provocation interaction (p � 0.275).
HR did not differ either between fight and avoid decisions
(p � 0.605), nor was there a decision by provocation (p �
0.284) or three-way interaction (p � 0.225).
In the selection phase, we found a main effect of prov-
ocation (b � 0.12, t1507 � 4.05, p � 0.001; Fig. 2E) such
that participants had a higher HR increase relative to
baseline in HP (0.46 � 0.03) than in LP trials (0.34 � 0.03).
Time had no main or interactive effects (both p � 0.341).
Neuroimaging results
Neural reactivity to provocation in the escape phase
No region was differentially active in the high � low or
low � high comparisons in the escape phase. In regres-
sion analyses, we did not find any association between
brain activity in this contrast and the provocation effect for
avoidance across participants.
Neural activation in fight versus avoid decisions
When participants decided to avoid, we observed wide-
spread bilateral activation across the superior temporal sul-
cus (STS), mPFC, IFG, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
extending to the ventral precuneus among other regions
(Table 1; Fig. 3A). When participants decided to fight, we
found increased activation in motor and somatosensory
cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal precuneus,
ventral thalamus, and middle occipital lobe (Table 1; Fig. 3B).
Interaction between provocation and decision
The right amygdala, the cuneus extending to the middle
precuneus, and bilateral posterior cerebellum showed in-
creased activation when participants chose the avoidance
option in the high compared with low provocation condi-
tion (Table 1; Fig. 4).
The intraparietal sulcus extending to the supramarginal
gyrus (SMG), middle frontal gyrus, mPFC, IFG, inferior
parietal lobule (IPL) covering the TPJ, and subgenual
anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) showed lower activation
when participants avoided the HP relative to the the LP
(Table 1; Fig. 5).
Neural reactivity to provocation in the selection phase
In the punishment selection phase, we found increased
reactivity to provocation (high � low) in IFG, IPL covering
the TPJ, PCC, precuneus, and the brainstem peaking in
the PAG but including the red nucleus and the ventral
thalamus (Table 2; Fig. 6A,B). No clusters survived in the
opposite contrast (low � high), and no region was asso-
ciated with the provocation effect for aggression across
participants (Fig. 6).
Brain activity in the outcome phase
In the outcome phase, won relative to lost trials elicited
brain activity in the ventral striatum (VS; Table 2; Fig. 6C)

 as well as in a number of cortical areas, chiefly in the
dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. Lost
relative to won trials were associated with large clusters
across the superior temporal gyrus, as well as with acti-
vation in the lingual gyrus and the anterior insula (AI;
Table 2; Fig. 6D). There were no main or interactive effects
of provocation in the outcome phase.
Discussion
We investigated the neural correlates of fight and avoid-
ance decisions in response to provocation. Participants
avoided the HP more often, but selected louder sound
blasts when confronting her. Nevertheless, these behav-
ioral provocation effects were not related to computerized
and self-report measures of avoidance on a between-
participant basis. Fight decisions yielded increased acti-
vation in OFC, dorsal precuneus, and the sensorimotor
cortex among other regions. Avoidance decisions were
accompanied by increased activity in the mentalizing net-
work, but this effect was less pronounced in high provo-
cation trials. On the other hand, amygdala, precuneus,
and posterior cerebellum were more active when avoiding
the HP compared with the LP. Our study therefore iden-
tifies direct neural correlates of fight-or-flight decisions,
and helps to delineate the contribution of OFC, amygdala,
and mentalizing regions in aggressive and avoidant re-
sponses to provocation.
Behavioral and cardiac responses to provocation
Participants avoided the HP more frequently and se-
lected higher punishments against her than against the
LP. They were also generally quicker to decide when
facing the HP, and more so when choosing to fight her. In
the selection phase and reaction time task, subjects be-
came quicker over time independently of the opponent or
the decision, implying that they learned the task dynam-
ics. Importantly, participants did not generally use all
avoidance options. When they did, it was in the last trials,
when the end of the run neared. This suggests that par-
ticipants might have also pondered whether to use up
avoidance options or save them for later, which, as
pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, adds another
layer of cognitive complexity to the decision process. We
did not find the expected deceleration in HR in the escape
phase, likely because having the opportunity to escape
conferred participants a sense of safety (Lang and Brad-
ley, 2013). In the selection phase, however, HR increased
when facing the HP, reflecting a typical circa-strike phys-
iologic response to an incoming threat (Lang and Bradley,
2013; Haller et al., 2014). The magnitude of this response

 was small due to the short duration of this epoch (i.e., 3 s).
Overall, results suggest that the FOE paradigm was able
to successfully provoke participants and motivated gen-
uine fight and flight responses.
There was no direct relationship between any measure
of trait avoidance and avoidant behavior in the FOE.
Rather, avoidance and aggression were related to fairness
ratings, indicating that participants’ behavior depended
more on transient appraisals of the opponent than on
broad avoidant tendencies. Alternatively, variability in
avoidance might have been too low to detect correlations
with personality (Bates et al., 1996). It can also be that the
computerized avoidance tasks inadequately captured the
construct of interest, given that the DPT has shown poor
reliability in nonclinical samples (Schmukle, 2005). Nota-
bly, the AAT approach bias toward happy faces was
marginally associated with decreased avoidance and in-
creased aggression against the HP relative to the LP. This
indicates that participants with high approach motivation
were more sensitive to provocation, and is in line with
theories suggesting than anger and aggression are
approach-driven behaviors (Carver and Harmon-Jones,
2009; Berkowitz, 2012). The finding that participants were
faster to select the fight, but not the avoidance, option
against the HP also fits this notion. Further developments
of the FOE could include, e.g., a shorter time limit to
decide and/or additional tradeoffs for fight and avoid
decisions. Such constraints would better recreate real
world aggression episodes, in which responses to prov-
ocation are likely adopted after one-shot, impulsive deci-
sions (Lowe and May, 2011; Simons et al., 2015).
Neural responses to provocation
We found no general differences in neural activation
between the HP and the LP in the escape phase despite
the stark contrast in behavior toward each opponent. In
previous studies, differential brain reactivity to provoca-
tion was only observed when deciding the punishment
intensity (Krämer et al., 2007; Beyer et al., 2014b), which
presumably entails qualitatively different cognitive pro-
cesses than choosing whether to avoid or fight. The latter
decision might have been complex enough to constrict
differences in neural reactivity to provocation, which were
only visible within avoid and fight trials. This is supported
by the widespread brain activity observed in the avoid
versus fight contrasts, and the greater reaction times in
avoid relative to fight decisions.
When selecting the punishment, some areas of the
mentalizing network (IFG, TPJ, precuneus) were activated
in high relative to low provocation trials. This could reflect
a more intense deliberation of the consequences of pun-
ishing the HP, as is often assumed in competitive or
bargaining paradigms (Krach et al., 2008; Assaf et al.,
2009; Polosan et al., 2011). This effect was accompanied
by increased activity in the PAG extending to the ventral
thalamus and other midbrain nuclei, an established de-
fensive reaction to imminent threat (Mobbs et al., 2007;
Mobbs et al., 2009). Remarkably, no mPFC activity was
observed in this epoch. This finding is in agreement with
studies reporting a shift from prefrontal to subcortical

 activation as a function of threat proximity (Mobbs et al.,
2007; Mobbs et al., 2009). Across studies, the mPFC is
less strongly recruited in tasks involving quick, one-shot
judgements, than in tasks that require inferring stable
characteristics (Schurz et al., 2014). Hence, provocation
seems to foster alertness and rapid social-cognitive pro-
cessing in the seconds preceding the aggressive encoun-
ter. It is noticeable that other studies with the TAP did not
report PAG reactivity to provocation during punishment
selection (Krämer et al., 2007; Beyer et al., 2014b). This
might be due to the fact that the punishment selection
phase here was shorter (3 vs 6 s), so the sense of incom-
ing threat was probably heightened.
Neural activation underlying fight decisions
When participants decided to fight, we observed in-
creased activity in OFC, sensorimotor regions, the ventral
thalamus, and the bilateral precuneus. Somatomotor ac-
tivation in retaliatory decisions probably reflected lower-
level preparatory processes, which might have been
exacerbated by the potential value of the task’s outcomes
(Iyer et al., 2010). Importantly, this motor activity is unlikely
due to differences in reaction times between fight and
avoid decisions, which were small in absolute value
(around 115 ms) and had been controlled for by including
button presses as a nuisance regressor. Medial OFC
activation was also increased when participants decided
to fight relative to avoid. This shows that the function of
the OFC in aggression is not confined to impulse control
(Blair, 2001; Mehta and Beer, 2009). Instead, our results
indicate that this area accomplishes a more general eval-
uative role (Stalnaker et al., 2015). From this perspective,
the observed OFC activation could correspond to threat
assessment (Beyer et al., 2015), and/or vindictive ap-
proach motivation (Seymour et al., 2007). Notably, the
ventral thalamus was recruited in fight relative to avoid
decisions. This subregion has been proposed to integrate
motivational and motor proprioceptive inputs, thereby
contributing to action selection (Bosch-Bouju et al., 2013).
The above commented somatomotor activity and the fact
that the PAG cluster observed in the selection phase
extended into the ventral thalamus concur with this inter-
pretation.
Neural activation underlying avoid decisions
In a previously commented fMRI study, participants
with high emotional reactivity to threat had less mentaliz-
ing network activity when facing a provoking opponent,
but there was no relationship between this effect and
aggressive behavior (Beyer et al., 2014b). Here, by giving
participants an escape option, we expected to observe a
direct link between threat-induced deactivation of men-
talizing regions and active avoidance. Indeed, activity in
mentalizing and “mirror neuron” regions was generally
increased when deciding to avoid an aggressive encoun-
ter, but was relatively reduced when avoiding the HP. This

 suggests that participants engaged in mentalizing pro-
cesses during avoidance decisions, but disengaged from
the situation when they perceived high threat, i.e., in HP
trials. This is consistent with the reduced reaction times
for these trials, with the increased amygdala activation,
and with studies showing that social stress disrupts social
cognition both at the behavioral (Smeets et al., 2009) and
neural level (Nolte et al., 2013). Nonetheless, our interpre-
tation is partly based on reverse inference (Hutzler, 2014),
and so alternative explanations, such as, e.g., reduced
cognitive effort (Halko et al., 2009) could also account for
these effects. In fact, considering that the escape phase
was relatively long (i.e., 6 s), we might have captured not
only decision-related but also postdecision cognitive pro-
cesses. This might especially concern activation in the
rostral prefrontal cortex and the inferior parietal lobe,
which increases during post-decision evaluation and cor-
relates with self-reported uncertainty about the chosen
option (Wan et al., 2016). Provocation might thus impair
the cognitive processes leading to avoidance decisions
as well as the reevaluation of such decisions. On the other
hand, mPFC and IFG activity in avoidance decisions
could also correspond to the experience of safety, given
that relief from pain has been associated with increased
activation in these areas (Leknes et al., 2011). If that was
the case, the sense of relief and the corresponding BOLD
signal in these regions should be greater when avoiding
the HP, but we observed the opposite pattern. Relief is
therefore unlikely to explain the present results. All in all,
we deem it reasonable to assume that activity in these
areas corresponds at least in part to social-cognitive pro-
cesses, although their exact nature and timing (i.e., pre-
vs postdecision) cannot be ultimately clarified with the
present data.
Remarkably, regions typically regarded as part the mir-
ror neuron system such as the anterior SMG showed a
similar pattern of activity in avoid decisions as mentalizing
ones. Mirror neurons are thought to be involved in auto-
matic action perception, whereas mentalizing regions
contribute to the more complex understanding of others’
cognitive and emotional state (Yang et al., 2015). Although
some authors argue that these processes are indepen-
dent (Catmur, 2015), others construe mirror activity as
necessary for higher-level mentalizing inferences (Tidoni
and Candidi, 2016). Our data suggests that both systems
have a convergent role in deciding how individuals re-
spond to provocation. Supporting this formulation, mirror
and mentalizing systems increase their coupling during
real-time social interactions (Sperduti et al., 2014), and
reactivity to emotional stimuli in the precentral gyrus, a
motor mirror region, has been related to aggression
(Beyer et al., 2014a).
Unlike the rest of the mentalizing network, we observed
a spatial gradient in the precuneus. Dorsal regions were
recruited in fight responses, ventral parts were involved in
avoid decisions, and the middle area was specifically
activated when avoiding and when about to face the HP
relative to the LP. Our data agrees with the proposed
functional segregation between a sensorimotor and a
limbic precuneus (Margulies et al., 2009), and suggests
that the differential activation of these subareas might
contribute to either aggressive or avoidant responses to
provocation.
We found that the right basolateral amygdala was more
active when avoiding a highly relative to a lowly provoking
opponent. Amygdala reactivity to threat has been linked
to aggression (Lotze et al., 2007; Gospic et al., 2011;
McCloskey et al., 2016). Albeit this is often interpreted as
an approach-driven phenomenon (Beaver et al., 2008),
the paradigms used in these studies lack an avoidance
option. The present data implies that the amygdala is not
involved in either approach or avoidance per se (Fernando
et al., 2013; Weymar and Schwabe, 2016), but potentiates
defensive behavior adaptively. If escape is possible,
amygdala activation will favor avoidance, if not, it will
facilitate aggression (LeDoux, 2003; Lang and Bradley,
2013). Furthermore, our results indicate that this structure
can signal threat proactively, thereby contributing to con-
trolled decision processes (Pessoa, 2010).
It is also worth noting that posterior cerebellar activity
closely resembled that of the amygdala, rather than that of
the motor cortex. Activation in the cerebellum was highest
when avoiding the HP, and its peak was located on its
posterior aspect extending to the vermis. The latter sub-
region is often termed limbic cerebellum (Schmahmann
et al., 2007), and is thought to be involved in inferential
social-cognitive processes (Van Overwalle et al., 2014).
However, since the function of the cerebellum in higher-
order cognition is still far from clear (Koziol et al., 2014), its
precise contribution to avoidant behavior cannot be read-
ily delimited.
In summary, participants showed increased amygdala
activity, reduced mentalizing network activity, and short
reaction times in trials in which they avoided the HP. The
most plausible explanation of these results is that, on a
trial-wise basis, perceived threat caused participants to
avoid the opponent both cognitively (not thinking about
her intentions) and behaviorally (choosing not to engage
in the confrontation). This is consistent with the proposed
role of the amygdala in coordinating cortical responses to
threat (Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010).
Brain activity in the outcome phase
Winning relative to losing was linked to activity in the
VS. This midbrain dopaminergic structure is thought to
code for both general and social rewards (Sescousse
et al., 2013). Indeed, VS activation after wins is a highly
robust finding in fMRI studies with the TAP (Krämer et al.,
2007; Brunnlieb et al., 2013; Beyer et al., 2014b; Emmer-
ling et al., 2016) as well as in other competitive paradigms
(Delgado et al., 2008; Bault et al., 2011; Kätsyri et al.,
2013). Losing was linked to large clusters of activity in the
superior temporal gyrus, peaking in the auditory cortex
and hence attributable to the sound blast. However, we
also observed a defeat-related cluster on the AI, again
mimicking previous findings (Krämer et al., 2007; Beyer
et al., 2014b) and presumably corresponding to the ob-
noxiousness of the punishment (Lamm et al., 2011). This
might also account for lingual gyrus activity, which has
been related to aversive learning with auditory stimuli

 (Miskovic and Keil, 2014; McTeague et al., 2015; Gu et al.,
2016). Results in the outcome phase thus replicated es-
tablished effects, arguing for the reliability of the para-
digm.
Limitations
Some shortcomings of the study should be kept in
mind. First, the limited temporal resolution of fMRI does
not permit to reliably isolate brain activity preceding the
decisions, which were taken on average in little �1 s. This
also implies, as commented earlier, that brain activity in
the escape phase might partly reflect postdecision cog-
nitive processes. Electroencephalography could better
track the temporal dynamics of such a quick process
(Gluth et al., 2013). Note also that onsets and data acqui-
sition in the escape phase were synchronous, which
might compromise statistical power. We did so because
the crucial contrasts in this study involved a reduced
number of trials, so that making onsets and acquisition
asynchronous could add unwanted variability. Further-
more, at relatively short sampling rates (i.e., below 2.68 s),
both methods yield similar estimates of the BOLD re-
sponse (Miezin et al., 2000). Second, as our sample was
limited to healthy young women, it should be tested
whether similar results can be obtained in other popula-
tions. Third, we used HR to keep comparability with pre-
vious studies (van Honk et al., 2001; Lang and Bradley,
2013), but the relationship between vagal input and HR is
not linear and might be better captured by heart period
(Berntson et al., 1995). Fourth, our paradigm did not tap
important variables that can influence how one responds
to provocation, such as presence of bystanders (Vasquez
et al., 2013). This is an interesting venue for future studies
with the FOE.
Conclusions
We explored aggressive and avoidant reactions to in-
terpersonal provocation, as well as their underlying neu-
rophysiological signature. Cardiac and behavioral data
suggest that the FOE, our newly developed competitive
task, successfully provoked participants. We showed that
avoidance was related to activity in mentalizing regions,
whereas retaliation was associated with OFC and so-
matomotor activation. Activity in some areas was how-
ever modulated by provocation. Specifically, the right
amygdala was upregulated when avoiding a provoking
opponent, whereas certain mentalizing and mirror regions
(mPFC, TPJ, IFG, SMG) showed relatively decreased ac-
tivation. Taken together, our results indicate that avoidant
responses to provocation might stem from anticipatory
threat signaling and are associated with reduced per-
spective taking. Moreover, our study suggests that threat
escapability is a major situational factor that should be
considered in laboratory measures of aggression.
