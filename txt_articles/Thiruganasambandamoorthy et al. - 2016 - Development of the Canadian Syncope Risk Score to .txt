yncope is common both in the general 
population and in acute care settings, 
accounting for 1%–3% of all emergency 
department visits.1–3 It is a transient loss of con-
sciousness due to transient global cerebral hypo-
perfusion followed by spontaneous complete 
recovery.4 Although often benign, syncope can 
be caused by potentially life-threatening condi-
tions such as ventricular arrhythmias.5 These 
serious conditions and the associated morbidity 
and mortality constitute serious adverse events 
among patients with syncope. A substantial pro-
portion of serious adverse events are not appar-
ent during initial evaluation in the emergency 
department.6 From 7% to 23% of patients with 
syncope will experience a serious adverse event 
within 7–30 days, with about half being evident 
only after disposition from the emergency 
department, either while admitted in hospital or 
after discharge home.7–9
The proportion of patients with syncope who 
are admitted to hospital, and the evaluation and 
investigations ordered both in the emergency de-
partment and in hospital vary greatly among 
physicians, institutions and countries.1,10,11 A re-
cent study showed wide variations in the man-

Background: Syncope can be caused by serious 
conditions not evident during initial evalua-
tion, which can lead to serious adverse events, 
including death, after disposition from the 
emergency department. We sought to de-
velop a clinical decision tool to identify adult 
patients with syncope who are at risk of a 
 
serious adverse event within 30 days after dis-
position from the emergency department.
Methods: We prospectively enrolled adults (age 
≥ 16 yr) with syncope who presented within 24 
hours after the event to 1 of 6 large emergency 
departments from Sept. 29, 2010, to Feb. 27, 
2014. We collected standardized variables at in-
dex presentation from clinical evaluation and 
investigations. Adjudicated  
serious adverse 
events included death, myocardial infarction, 
arrhythmia, structural heart disease, pulmonary 
embolism, serious hemorrhage and procedural 
interventions within 30 days.
Results: We enrolled 4030 patients with syn-
cope; the mean age was 53.6 years, 55.5% 
were women, and 9.5% were admitted to 
hospital. Serious adverse events occurred in 
147 (3.6%) of the patients within 30 days 
 
after disposition from the emergency depart-
ment. Of 43 candidate predictors examined, 
we included 9 in the final model: predisposi-
tion to vasovagal syncope, heart disease, any 
systolic pressure reading in the emergency de-
partment < 90 or > 180 mm Hg, troponin level 
above 99th percentile for the normal popula-
tion, abnormal QRS axis (< −30° or > 100°), 
QRS duration longer than 130 ms, QTc interval 
longer than 480 ms, emergency department 
diagnosis of cardiac syncope and emergency 
department diagnosis of vasovagal syncope 
(C statistic 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.85–0.90; optimism 0.015; goodness-of-fit p = 
0.11). The risk of a serious adverse event 
within 30 days ranged from 0.4% for a score 
of −3 to 83.6% for a score of 11. The sensitiv-
ity was 99.2% (95% CI 95.9%–100%) for a 
threshold score of −2 or higher and 97.7% 
(95% CI 93.5%–99.5%) for a threshold score 
of −1 or higher.
Interpretation: The Canadian Syncope Risk 
Score showed good discrimination and cali-
bration for 30-day risk of serious adverse 
events after disposition from the emergency 
department. Once validated, the tool will be 
able to accurately stratify the risk of serious 
adverse events among patients presenting 
with syncope, including those at low risk who 
can be discharged home quickly.

sions by physicians and significant differences in 
the 30-day rate of serious outcomes across the 
study centres.11 Risk stratification and disposi-
tion of patients with syncope is challenging be-
cause valid and reliable evidence guiding dispo-
sition decisions is lacking.12 A few prospective 
studies developed clinical decision tools to iden-
tify patients at risk of serious adverse events 
within 30 days.8,9,13,14 However, they have poor 
diagnostic test characteristics and several meth-
odological flaws that preclude their widespread 
adoption by clinicians.
We conducted a prospective cohort study to 
develop a clinical decision tool to identify adult 
patients with syncope who are at risk of a serious 
adverse event within 30 days after disposition 
from the emergency department.
Methods
Study setting and population
We conducted a prospective cohort study at 
6 large emergency departments in teaching hospi-
tals in 4 Canadian cities (The Ottawa Hospital – 
Civic and General Campuses, Ottawa; the Kings-
ton General Hospital and the Hotel Dieu Hospital, 
Kingston, Ontario; the Foothills Medical Centre, 
Calgary; and the University of Alberta Hospital, 
Edmonton). 
We included adults (age ≥ 16 yr) with syn-
cope who presented within 24 hours after the 
event from Sept. 29, 2010, to Feb. 27, 2014. We 
excluded patients who had prolonged loss of 
consciousness (> 5 min), a change in their men-
tal status from baseline after the syncope, an ob-
vious witnessed seizure, major trauma requiring 
hospital admission, intoxication with alcohol or 
illicit drugs, a language barrier or head trauma 
causing loss of consciousness. We chose these 
exclusion criteria because they are routinely used 
in syncope studies to exclude  
patients without 
true syncope.4,15 We also excluded patients who 
had a serious adverse event identified during the 
index emergency department visit. Because of 
wide variation in the disposition of patients with 
syncope at the study sites,11 we included both ad-
mitted and discharged patients in our analysis to 
avoid bias.
Because our study was observational, the ethics 
committees at all of the sites approved the protocol 
with the requirement of only verbal consent.
Data collection
Emergency physicians and emergency medicine 
residents under staff physicians’ supervision 
screened consecutive patients, confirmed eligi-
bility and obtained consent before inclusion in 
the study. The physicians and residents attended 
a 1-hour training session on how to assess for 
standardized variables from the history and 
physical examination, and how to arrive at the fi-
nal diagnosis based on the European Society of 
Cardiology guidelines.4 All electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) performed during the index visit to the 
emergency department were reviewed by at least 
1 cardiologist; ECGs with abnormalities were re-
viewed by a study cardiologist for extraction of 
ECG variables.16 
We chose the list of variables for data collec-
tion on the basis of a comprehensive literature 
review, the results of previously completed stud-
ies and expert consensus.15,17–19 We identified a 
subset of these variables as candidate predictors 
for the study. When feasible, a second emer-
gency physician assessed a subset of study 
patients to estimate interobserver agreement of 
the eligibility criteria and predictor variables. 
Trained research assistants reviewed the present-
ing problems and discharge diagnoses for all vis-
its to the participating emergency departments 
during the study period to identify additional 
patients who would have been eligible for the 
study but were not enrolled.
Serious adverse events
We defined a serious adverse event as the detec-
tion or occurrence of any serious condition related 
to syncope within 30 days after disposition from 
the emergency department. The composite out-
come included any of the following serious ad-
verse events: death, arrhythmia, myocardial in-
farction, serious structural heart disease, aortic 
dissection, pulmonary embolism, severe pulmo-
nary hypertension, severe hemorrhage, subarach-
noid hemorrhage, any other serious condition 
causing syncope and procedural interventions for 
the treatment of syncope (details are provided in 
Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151469/-/DC1). These 
adverse events have been identified by 2 interna-
tional panels of syncope researchers as pertinent 
ones that should be reported in risk-stratification 
studies of syncope management in emergency de-
partments in an effort to standardize the reporting 
of outcomes.15,20 For patients who experienced a 
serious adverse event, we collected information 
on the place of the occurrence (inside or outside 
the hospital).
We assessed for the composite outcome using 
a multistep approach: (a) a structured review of 
patients’ health records for documents related to 
the index and subsequent visits to the emergency 
department; inpatient, outpatient and operative 
notes; results of all investigations; and hospital 
death records; (b) scripted telephone follow-up 
immediately after 30 days; (c) at the Ontario

study sites, a review of patients’ health records at 
all local adult hospitals and the provincial coro-
ner’s office for death records; and (d) at the 
Alberta study sites, a review of the Alberta 
health systems database (Netcare) to ascertain 
return visits to the emergency department. All 
serious adverse events were confirmed by an 
adjudication committee composed of 2 physi-
cians blinded to the predictors and a third physi-
cian who adjudicated in cases of disagreement.
Statistical analysis
We describe study participants using means, 
ranges and standard deviations for continuous 
variables, and frequencies with proportions for 
categorical variables. The interobserver agree-
ment was calculated with the use of the κ coeffi-
cient, the proportion of agreement beyond chance.
We screened the initial list of variables of in-
terest to identify a subset of candidate predictors 
for bivariable and multivariable analysis. We ex-
cluded candidate predictors with fewer than 5 ex-
pected events because they were likely to cause 
model instability; those with variance inflation 
factors for multicollinearity exceeding a thresh-
old of 5; those with missing values for more than 
25% of the patients; and those with unacceptable 
interobserver agreement (κ value < 0.4).21 Be-
cause there were more candidate predictors than 
available degrees of freedom, we selected candi-
date predictors for multivariable logistic regres-
sion by testing the bivariable association of each 
predictor with the outcome at the 5% significance 
level, using the χ2 or Fisher exact test for categor-
ical predictors and the 2-sample t test for continu-
ous predictors. Before the regression analysis, we 
performed multiple imputation for missing pre-
dictors to create a complete data set for analysis. 
Ten multiple imputation data sets were generated 
with the use of the Markov chain Monte Carlo 
method with inclusion of the outcome, all candi-
date predictors and additional variables expected 
to be correlated with the missing predictors.22
After multiple imputation, we dichotomized 
continuous predictors using a combination of 
clinical rationale and analysis of receiver operat-
ing characteristic curves, which identified the op-
timal cut-off point based on measures of sensitiv-
ity, specificity and the Youden Index.12,17,18 After 
categorization, predictors selected by bivariable 
analysis were included in a multivariable logistic 
regression model, which was reduced by step-
wise backward elimination with a 5% signifi-
cance level to stay in the model. The regression 
estimates for the reduced model were combined 
across the 10 multiple imputation data sets.22
Internal validation was carried out with the 
use of 500 bootstrap samples. The variable selec-
tion procedure was repeated in each bootstrap 
sample, and the percentage of times each vari-
able was selected was determined to examine the 
stability of the stepwise variable selection proce-
dure. A well-known problem in multivariable 
regression modelling is overfitting — the model 
performs well for predicting outcomes among 
the patients used to derive the model but poorly 
among new patients.21 This leads to an overly 
optimistic impression of the model’s perfor-
mance. The optimism (overfitting) in our model 
performance measures was estimated, and opti-
mism-corrected performance indicators with 
95% bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) were 
obtained. As a result of overfitting, predictions 
tend to be too low for patients with low risk 
scores and too high for those with high risk 
scores. A solution is to apply shrinkage, which 
adjusts estimated regression coefficients to be 
closer to 0. To correct for overfitting, we calcu-
lated the model shrinkage using the calibration 
slopes across the bootstrap samples and applied 
it to the regression coefficients.23 
We translated the shrinkage-corrected model 
into a point-scoring system by dividing all of the

regression coefficients by the smallest coefficient 
and rounding to the nearest integer.24 We assessed 
the calibration of the model using a comparison of 
observed versus expected risk at each level of the 
score, as well as the Hosmer–Lemeshow good-
ness-of-fit statistic by risk percentiles. We also 
tested the ability of the model to discriminate the 
4 subtypes of serious adverse event (death, 
arrhythmia, nonarrhythmia cardiac, and noncar-
diac) that form the composite outcome. 
We used SAS versions 9.3 and 9.4 for data 
analysis.
Sample size
We determined the sample size based on the esti-
mation of precision of the sensitivity of the pre-
diction tool to be developed in the study popula-
tion.25 We determined that 125 patients with 
syncope who had a serious adverse event within 
30 days after disposition from the emergency 
department would be required to achieve a target 
of 99% sensitivity with a 95% exact binomial CI 
of 95.6%–100%. Conservatively assuming a 
prevalence of 3.5% for serious adverse events 
after disposition, we calculated a total required 
sample size of 3571 patients.
Results
We enrolled 4322 patients with syncope at the 
study hospitals from Sept. 29, 2010, to Feb. 27, 
2014 (Figure 1). We excluded 292 (6.8%) be-
cause they had incomplete outcome assessments 
(they could not be contacted for follow-up by 
telephone or had no matching records in the da-
tabases searched), which left 4030 for analysis. 
Of these patients, we were able to achieve fol-
low-up by direct telephone contact with 3855 
(95.7%) or their family; for the remaining 175 
patients (4.3%), we were able to ascertain posi-
tive or negative outcome status by reviewing 
hospital health records, coroner’s records or the 
health systems database. The demographic char-
acteristics of the 1263 (20.5%) potentially eligi-
ble patients who were not enrolled were similar 
to those of the enrolled patients (mean age 56.0 
v. 53.6 yr; 54.1% v. 55.5% females). Interrater 
reliability assessments were performed by a sec-
ond physician for 190 (4.7%) of the 4030 pa-
tients, and the κ value for syncope confirmation 
and inclusion in the study was 0.76 (95% CI 
0.64–0.87).
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 4030 
patients, their management in the emergency 
department and their outcomes. Within the 
30-day follow-up period, 147 patients (3.6%, 
95% CI 3.1%–4.3%) experienced a serious 
adverse event after disposition from the emer-
gency department, of whom 61 (1.5% [41.5% of 
those with serious adverse events]) had it outside 
the hospital (Table 2).
We selected an initial list of 43 candidate pre-
dictors for analysis (Appendix 2, available at www.
cmaj 
.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
.151469

DC1). Of these, 10 were excluded because of 
sparse distributions; none was excluded because of 
a low κ value or large proportion of missing values. 
For troponin levels, assays performed at the study 
sites differed, and the values were not comparable. 
In addition, troponin levels were not measured in 
52.1% of patients. We investigated the plausibility 
of the assumption that patients with missing val-
ues would be within the normal range by compar-
ing the characteristics of patients with and without 
troponin measurements; we found that those 
whose levels were not measured were younger, 
had a lower prevalence of comorbidities and had a 
lower proportion who experienced a serious ad-
verse event (Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup 
/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151469/-/DC1). 
We therefore dichotomized troponin at the 99th

percentile cut-off value for the normal population 
and assumed that all missing values were within 
the normal range. Bivariable tests of association 
were performed for the remaining 33 candidate 
predictors. A total of 8 predictors were not signifi-
cant, and after categorization, 2 additional predic-
tors (triage oxygen saturation and hemoglobin) had 
very low prevalence at abnormal cut-off values. 
We excluded these 10 predictors from further con-
sideration. A final list of 23 candidate predictors 
was selected for multivariable modelling, and none 
was involved in near linear dependencies (Table 3).
After exclusion of the predictor troponin, the 
percentage of missing values for the remaining 
candidate predictors ranged from 0% to 23.8%. 
Data for 4 predictors were missing for more than 
10% of patients: urea (23.8%), triage respiratory 
rate (20.2%), creatinine (18.1%) and hematocrit 
(16.4%). The predictor history of heart disease 
was missing for 6.3% of patients, and the ECG 
predictors were missing for 4.9% of patients. 
The remaining predictors were missing for less 
than 2% of patients. A total of 1887 participants 
(46.8%) had missing values for at least 1 of the 
22 predictors, most of whom were in the group 
with no serious adverse event (Table 3). After 
multiple imputation, all 4030 participants were 
included in the analysis. The 12 continuous pre-
dictors were dichotomized; after stepwise back-
ward elimination, the results were combined 
across the multiple imputation data sets to 
account for imputation uncertainty.
The final model included 9 predictors (Table 
4). Three predictors were from clinical evaluation 
(predisposition to vasovagal syncope; history of 
heart disease; and any systolic pressure reading in 
the emergency department < 90 or > 180 mm Hg). 
Four predictors were from investigations (troponin 
level > 99th percentile for normal population; and 
3 ECG predictors [abnormal QRS axis, prolonged

QRS interval and prolonged corrected QT inter-
val]). The final 2 predictors were related to emer-
gency department diagnosis (vasovagal or cardiac 
syncope). The apparent C statistic for the model 
was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90); after accounting for 
optimism of 0.015, the optimism-corrected C sta-
tistic was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84–0.89). The model 
shrinkage factor was calculated as 0.91 using the 
bootstrap internal validation, which indicated that 
about 9% of the apparent model performance can 
be attributed to statistical overfitting.
After multiplying the regression coefficients 
by the shrinkage factor, we created the Canadian 
Syncope Risk Score (Figure 2). The scores range 
from −3 to 11, with a shrinkage-adjusted ex-
pected risk ranging from 0.4% to 83.6%, respec-
tively. We found that the model was well cali-
brated, with close agreement between the 
observed and expected probabilities of a serious 
adverse event at various score levels (Figure 3). 
In addition, the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-
fit statistic was not significant (χ2 = 13.1, 7 de-
grees of freedom, p = 0.11), which confirmed the 
adequacy of calibration. 
The distribution of patients with each score and 
the diagnostic characteristics at specific thresholds 
are presented in Appendix 4 (available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151469/-/
DC1). The sensitivity was 99.2% (95% CI 95.9%–
100%) for a threshold score of −2 or higher and 
97.7% (95% CI 93.5%–99.5%) for a threshold 
score of −1 or higher. Because of small numbers 
of patients with higher scores, both for calibration 
and for reporting distribution of patients with each 
score, we collapsed scores of 6 or higher. When 
we examined the frequency of predictor selections 
in the backward elimination across the bootstrap 
samples, we found that the components of the 
score were the top 9 predictors selected in the 500 
replications (Appendix 5, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151469/-/DC1). 
We found that the model performed very well in 
its ability to discriminate between the 4 subtypes 
of serious adverse event (death, arrhythmia, nonar-
rhythmic cardiac and noncardiac) as shown in 
Appendix 6 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151469/-/DC1.
Interpretation
Using data from our prospective multicentre 
study, we developed the Canadian Syncope Risk 
Score as a clinical decision tool to identify adult 
patients at risk of serious adverse events not evi-
dent during the initial evaluation of syncope in the 
emergency department. An important number of 
patients with syncope had serious adverse events, 
including death, within 30 days after disposition 
from the emergency department, with a substan-
tial proportion of events occurring outside the 
hospital. A score of −2 or lower confers a very 
low risk (< 1%), scores of −1 to 3 confer a low to 
medium risk (1%–8%), and scores of 4 or more 
confer a high or very high risk (> 12%). This

scoring system will allow physicians to identify 
patients with syncope at higher risk of serious out-
comes, and after its validation, the tool will aid in 
the identification and quick disposition of lower-
risk patients from the emergency department.
Five prospective syncope studies attempted to 
develop tools for identification of short-term risk 
of serious adverse events.8,9,13,14,26 The San Fran-
cisco Syncope Rule was developed to predict such 
outcomes within 7 days.13 It performed poorly on 
external validation at various study sites, which 
made it unacceptable for adoption into prac-
tice.7,12,27 The Risk Stratification of Syncope in the 
Emergency Department (ROSE) rule was devel-
oped to predict serious adverse events within 1 
month.9 The rule performed suboptimally when 
validated and requires B-type natriuretic peptide 
testing, which is not easily available in many 
emergency departments. The Short-Term Progno-
sis in Syncope (STePS) Study identified risk fac-
tors for death and therapeutic interventions within 
10 days.14 The STePS predictors “concomitant 
trauma” and “male sex” make it impractical to use. 
The Boston Syncope Criteria comprise a long list 
of 25 plausible predictors for 30-day serious ad-
verse events without mathematical modelling.8 
Kayayurt and colleagues26 published the Anatolian 
Syncope Rule, but it was developed from a small 
sample of 231 Turkish patients with 39 serious ad-
verse events. Three of the studies13,14,26 included re-
admission to hospital without identification of seri-
ous underlying conditions as an outcome. All of 
the studies except 214,26 included cortical stroke as 
an outcome and patients with obvious serious ad-
verse events identified in the emergency depart-
ment for derivation of the prediction tool. Because 
cortical strokes are not related to global hypoperfu-
sion, the European Society of Cardiology recom-
mended that they not be included as a serious ad-
verse event.4 Inclusion of patients with serious 
adverse events identified in the emergency depart-
ment introduces bias in the tool (e.g., low hemato-
crit is identified as a risk factor if patients with ob-
vious gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency 
department were included, but it is no longer sig-
nificant after exclusion of these patients).9,13,28
In our study, we found predisposition to vaso-
vagal syncope to be negatively associated with 
serious adverse events. The Evaluation of Guide-
lines in Syncope Study (EGSYS) score, developed 
to identify patients with cardiac syncope, reported 
a similar finding.29 Similar to our study, a retro-
spective study to develop a score to predict 30-day 
serious adverse events among older (≥ 60 yr) 
patients with syncope found abnormal troponin 
(> 99th percentile of normal population) an inde-
pendent risk factor.28 Several previous prospective 
studies have reported heart disease and abnormal

ECG findings as independent risk factors for seri-
ous outcomes among patients with syncope.13,14,29 
Our final model includes 2 predictors related to the 
final emergency department diagnosis: vasovagal 
and cardiac syncope. Although subjective, these 
predictors had good interobserver agreement and 
were robust, as evidenced by the odds ratio esti-
mates. In addition, both predictors were selected 
100% of the time during the bootstrap internal val-
idation. Use of physicians’ diagnostic impression 
has been previously incorporated into successful 
models for venous thromboembolism detection.30
Strengths and limitations
Our study is the largest prospective syncope 
study to date, with 4030 enrolled patients, 
including a large number who had serious out-
comes after disposition from the emergency 
department. Previously published syncope tools 
were developed with fewer than 700 patients. 
We conducted our study as per methodologic 
standards for clinical decision tool studies,31 and 
our report meets all of the criteria listed in the 
Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Predic-
tion Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagno-
sis (TRIPOD) statement.32 We designed our 
study by avoiding the limitations identified in 
previous ones, for example by developing a tool 
for syncope-specific serious outcomes and for 
serious outcomes after disposition from the 
emergency department. Different definitions of 
“abnormal ECG” were used in the previous stud-
ies, and none were based on evidence. In our 
study, we collected ECG predictor variables sep-
arately rather than using an a priori definition of 
“abnormal ECG.” We used robust statistical 
techniques to develop the score, including safe-
guards to prevent overfitting and overestimation 
of the model’s performance. Our score includes 
relatively simple and well-defined predictors 
based on clinical evaluation, ECG findings and 
readily available blood test results that can be 
easily incorporated into practice.
Our study has limitations. About one-fifth of 
eligible patients were not enrolled because the 
emergency physicians were too busy to complete 
the study forms. However, this is an overestima-
tion because doubtful cases were assigned as eli-
gible non-enrolled patients. We are not aware of 
systematic reasons for non 
recruitment. 
Although it is difficult to establish a clear 
link between the adverse event and the index 
syncope, 2 international panels of syncope 
researchers have recommended that serious 
conditions occurring in patients with syncope 
after disposition from the emergency depart-
ment be reported as outcomes in emergency 
department risk-stratification studies.15,20
For patients without troponin measurements, 
we assumed the levels to be normal because the 
patients were younger with few comorbidities. 
On the basis of clinical judgment, we believe 
that troponin does not necessarily need to be 
measured in all patients with syncope. 
Most of the patients with missing predictors 
were in the group with no serious adverse events. 
Apart from the troponin predictor, history of heart 
disease was missing for 6.3% of patients, and the 
rest were missing for less than 2% of patients. We 
imputed these missing predictors using multiple 
imputation. In addition, given the large number of 
patients with no serious adverse event, we believe 
the effect of these missing predictors would have 
been minimal to change the results of our study. 
A small proportion of patients were lost to 
follow-up and not included in our analysis. It is 
unlikely that many of these patients would have 
had a serious outcome, and their exclusion is 
unlikely to have biased our results.
Conclusion
About 1 in 20 patients with syncope experienced 
severe adverse events, including death, after ini-
tial evaluation in the emergency department. Us-
ing data from the clinical evaluation, ECG find-
ings and readily available blood test results, and 
robust methodology, we developed the Can 
adian 
Syncope Risk Score to predict which patients 
will have severe adverse events after disposition 
from the emergency department. Once validated, 
the tool will aid in the identification and quick
