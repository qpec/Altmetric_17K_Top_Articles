Background
Aphasia is an acquired language impairment following brain damage that affects some or all language modalities: expression and
understanding of speech, reading, and writing. Approximately one third of people who have a stroke experience aphasia.
Objectives
To assess the effects of speech and language therapy (SLT) for aphasia following stroke.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 9 September 2015), CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5) and other
Cochrane Library Databases (CDSR, DARE, HTA, to 22 September 2015), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2015), EMBASE (1980
to September 2015), CINAHL (1982 to September 2015), AMED (1985 to September 2015), LLBA (1973 to September 2015), and
SpeechBITE (2008 to September 2015). We also searched major trials registers for ongoing trials including ClinicalTrials.gov (to 21
September 2015), the Stroke Trials Registry (to 21 September 2015), Current Controlled Trials (to 22 September 2015), and WHO
ICTRP (to 22 September 2015). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we also handsearched the
International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders (1969 to 2005) and reference lists of relevant articles, and we contacted
academic institutions and other researchers. There were no language restrictions.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SLT (a formal intervention that aims to improve language and communication abilities,
activity and participation) versus no SLT; social support or stimulation (an intervention that provides social support and communication
stimulation but does not include targeted therapeutic interventions); or another SLT intervention (differing in duration, intensity,
frequency, intervention methodology or theoretical approach).
Data collection and analysis
We independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of included trials. We sought missing data from investigators.

 Main results
We included 57 RCTs (74 randomised comparisons) involving 3002 participants in this review (some appearing in more than one
comparison). Twenty-seven randomised comparisons (1620 participants) assessed SLT versus no SLT; SLT resulted in clinically and
statistically significant benefits to patients’ functional communication (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.49, P = 0.01), reading, writing, and expressive language, but (based on smaller numbers) benefits were not
evident at follow-up. Nine randomised comparisons (447 participants) assessed SLT with social support and stimulation; meta-analyses
found no evidence of a difference in functional communication, but more participants withdrew from social support interventions
than SLT. Thirty-eight randomised comparisons (1242 participants) assessed two approaches to SLT. Functional communication was
significantly better in people with aphasia that received therapy at a high intensity, high dose, or over a long duration compared to
those that received therapy at a lower intensity, lower dose, or over a shorter period of time. The benefits of a high intensity or a high
dose of SLT were confounded by a significantly higher dropout rate in these intervention groups. Generally, trials randomised small
numbers of participants across a range of characteristics (age, time since stroke, and severity profiles), interventions, and outcomes.
Authors’ conclusions
Our review provides evidence of the effectiveness of SLT for people with aphasia following stroke in terms of improved functional
communication, reading, writing, and expressive language compared with no therapy. There is some indication that therapy at high
intensity, high dose or over a longer period may be beneficial. HIgh-intensity and high dose interventions may not be acceptable to all.

Speech and language therapy for language problems after a stroke
Review question
We reviewed the evidence of the effect of speech and language therapy (SLT) on language problems experienced by people after a stroke
(known as aphasia).
Background
About a third of people who suffer a stroke develop aphasia. One or more areas of communication can be affected: speaking, oral
comprehension, reading, and writing. Speech and language therapists assess, diagnose, and treat aphasia at all stages of recovery after
stroke. They work closely with the person with aphasia, families, and other healthcare professionals. We wanted to see whether SLT for
aphasia was effective and whether it was better or worse than non-specialist social support. We also wanted to see which approaches to
therapy offered the best recovery.
Study characteristics
The evidence is current to September 2015. We found and included 57 studies involving 3002 people with aphasia in our review. We
reviewed all SLT types, regimens, and methods of delivery.
Key results
Based on 27 studies (and 1620 people with aphasia), speech and language therapy benefits functional use of language, language
comprehension (for example listening or reading), and language production (speaking or writing), when compared with no access to
therapy, but it was unclear how long these benefits may last.
There was little information available to compare SLT with social support. Information from nine trials (447 people with aphasia)
suggests there may be little difference in measures of language ability. However, more people stopped taking part in social support
compared with those that attended SLT.
Thirty-eight studies compared two different types of SLT (involving 1242 people with aphasia). Studies compared SLT that differed in
therapy regimen (intensity, dosage and duration), delivery models (group, one-to-one, volunteer, computer-facilitated), and approach.
We need more information on these comparisons. Many hours of therapy over a short period of time (high intensity) appeared to help
participants’ language use in daily life and reduced the severity of their aphasia problems. However, more people stopped attending
these highly intensive treatments (up to 15 hours a week) than those that had a less intensive therapy schedule.
Quality of the evidence

 Generally, the quality of the studies conducted and reported could be improved. Key quality features were only reported by half of the
latest trials. Thus, it is unclear whether this was the result of poorly conducted studies or poorly reported studies. Most comparisons
we made would benefit from the availability of more studies involving more people with aphasia.

Description of the condition
The term aphasia (less commonly referred to as dysphasia) is used
to describe an acquired loss or impairment of the language system
following brain damage (Benson 1996). Usually associated specif-
ically with language problems arising after a stroke, it excludes
other communication difficulties attributed to sensory loss, con-
fusion, dementia or speech difficulties due to muscular weakness
or dysfunction, such as dysarthria. The most common cause of
aphasia is a stroke (or cerebrovascular accident), mainly to the left
hemisphere, where the language function of the brain is usually
situated for right-handed people. About a third of all people who
experience a stroke develop aphasia (Engelter 2006; Laska 2001).
The aphasic population is heterogeneous, with individual profiles
of language impairment varying in terms of severity and degree of
involvement across the modalities of language processing, includ-
ing the expression and comprehension of speech, reading, writing,
and gesture (Code 2003; Parr 1997). Variation in the severity of
expressive impairments, for example, may range from the individ-
ual experiencing occasional word-finding difficulties to having no
effective means of verbal communication. The severity of apha-
sia can also change over time as one aspect of language difficulty
may improve while others remain impaired. The impact and the
consequential implications of having aphasia for the individuals
themselves, their families, and society highlight the importance of
the effective management and rehabilitation of language difficul-
ties caused by aphasia.
Description of the intervention
The primary aim of speech and language therapy (SLT)* in apha-
sia management and rehabilitation is to maximise individuals’ lan-
guage and communication abilities, activity, and participation.
Speech and language therapists are typically responsible for the
assessment, diagnosis, and, where appropriate, rehabilitation of
aphasia arising as a result of stroke. The ability to successfully com-
municate a message via spoken, written, or non-verbal modali-
ties (or a combination of these) within day-to-day interactions is
known as functional communication. Recent developments have
seen speech and language therapists working closely with the per-
son with aphasia, and in partnership with their families and care-
givers, tomaximise the individual’sfunctional communicationand
participation.
* For the purposes of clarity within this review we have reserved
SLT as an abbreviation for speech and language therapy alone.
Why it is important to do this review
There is no universally accepted treatment that can be applied to
every person with aphasia, and typically therapists select from a va-
riety of theoretical approaches, delivery models, and intervention
regimens to manage and facilitate rehabilitation. We undertook
this 2016 review update to incorporate new evidence and system-
atic review methodologies and to reflect recent developments in
clinical practice. A summary of the differences between the 2016
version and the original 1999 review is presented in Differences
between protocol and review.
O B J E C T I V E S
To assess the effects of speech and language therapy (SLT) for
aphasia following stroke. In particular, we aimed to investigate
whether:
• SLT is more effective than no SLT;
• SLT is more effective than social support and stimulation;
• one SLT intervention (SLT A) is more effective than
another SLT intervention (SLT B).
SLT intervention A or B refers to variations in intervention that
differinduration, intensity, frequency, method, ortheoretical basis
(e.g. early SLT versus delayed SLT interventions).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated one or more
SLT interventions designed to improve language or communica-
tion. We included trials that recruited participants with mixed ae-
tiologies or impairments provided it was possible to extract the
data specific to individuals with poststroke aphasia. We did not
employ any language restriction.
Types of participants
Adults (as defined by the trialists) who had acquired aphasia as a
result of a stroke, and families of participating stroke survivors.

 Types of interventions
In a change from the 1999 version of the review, all subsequent
updates compressed the intervention into three broad groups. We
included trials that reported a comparison between a group that
received an SLT intervention designed to have an impact on com-
munication and a group that received:
• no SLT intervention;
• social support and stimulation; or
• an alternative SLT intervention.
SLT
We considered SLT interventions to be any form of targeted prac-
tice tasks or methodologies with the aim of improving language
or communication abilities, activities, or participation. These are
typically delivered by speech and language therapists. In the UK,
’speech and language therapist’ is a protected professional title and
refers to individuals holding a professional qualification recognised
by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and reg-
istered with the Health and Care Professions Council, UK. For
the purposes of this review, we extended this definition to include
therapists belonging to a body of similar professional standing
elsewhere in the world.
We are aware that the SLT profession does not exist in many coun-
tries. In trials conducted in such settings, where other clinical staff
(e.g.medical ornursingstaff)ledtargetedinterventionsthataimed
to improve participants’ communicative functioning, we included
these interventions within this review as SLT interventions. We
planned a sensitivity analysis of the impact of professional SLT
training on the provision of an intervention where data allowed.
We also recognise that current rehabilitation practice may include
SLT interventions that aim to improve communicative function-
ing but are delivered by non-therapists (family members, SLT as-
sistants, SLT students, voluntary support groups). Where those
delivering the intervention received training from a speech and
language therapist and delivered an intervention designed by a
speech and language therapist, we described these as volunteer-
facilitated SLT interventions.
Social support and stimulation
Social support and stimulation refers to an intervention that pro-
vides social support or stimulation but does not include targeted
therapeutic interventions that aim to resolve participants’ expres-
sive or receptive speech and language impairments. Interventions
in this category might include, for example, emotional, psycho-
logical, or creative interventions (such as art, dance, or music) as
delivered by other healthcare professionals (e.g. art, physical, or
music therapists). Other social stimulation interventions, such as
conversation or other informal, unstructured communicative in-
teractions, are also included in this category.
We did not include pharmacological interventions for aphasia as
they are addressed within a separate review (Greener 2001). We
also excluded magnetic or electrical stimulation interventions (e.g.
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial mag-
netic stimulation, or epidural cortical stimulation) or auditory
temporal processing training procedures, as we considered these to
be adjuncts to SLT rather than an SLT approach. The effectiveness
of tDCS interventions for aphasia is addressed within a separate
review (Elsner 2012).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome chosen to indicate the effectiveness of an
intervention that aims to improve communicative ability must re-
flect communication activity in real world settings, that is, func-
tional communication. Providing a definition for the concept of
functional communication is problematic and makes evaluation
difficult. The ability to functionally communicate relates to lan-
guage or communicational skills sufficient to permit the transmis-
sion of a message via spoken, written, or non-verbal modalities, or
through a combination of these channels. Success is typically and
naturalistically demonstrated through successful communication
of the message - the speaker communicates their message, and
the listener understands the message communicated. Attempts to
measure this communication success formally vary from analysis
of discourse interaction in real life or sampling of discourse during
specific tasks (known as discourse analysis). Other more formal
tools might include the Communicative Abilities of Daily Liv-
ing (CADL) or the Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI)
(Holland 1980; Lomas 1989).
Secondary outcomes
Given the lack of a comprehensive, reliable, valid, and globally ac-
cepted functional communication evaluation tool, surrogate out-
come measures of communication impairment (or ability) include
formal measures of receptive language (oral, written and gestu-
ral), expressive language (oral, written and gestural) or overall level
of severity of aphasia where receptive and expressive language are
measured using language batteries. Such tools might include, for
example, the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) or the Porch Index
of Communicative Abilities (PICA) (Kertesz 1982; Porch 1967).
Other secondary outcomes of relevance to this review include psy-
chosocial impact (i.e. impact on psychological or social well-be-
ing including mood, depression, anxiety, and distress), satisfac-
tion with intervention, number of dropouts (i.e. the number of
participants dropping out at treatment or follow-up phases for
any reason), adherence to allocated intervention (i.e. the num-
ber of participants voluntarily withdrawing from their allocated
intervention), economic outcomes (such as costs to the patient,
caregivers, families, health service, and society) and caregiver and
family quality of life. We extracted measures of overall functional

 status (e.g. Barthel) in the original review as one of a number of
primary outcomes. We also extracted these data, where available,
as an indicator of overall severity of stroke, but this information
is now presented as a patient descriptor within the Characteristics
of included studies table. A full list of outcome measures included
in the review and their references can be found in Appendix 1.
Search methods for identification of studies
See the ’Specializedregister’ sectioninthe Cochrane Stroke Group
module. We did not impose any language restrictions.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last
searched 9 September 2015), CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5) and
other Cochrane Library Databases (CDSR, DARE, HTA, to 22
September 2015) (Appendix 2), MEDLINE (1946 to Septem-
ber 2015) (Appendix 3), EMBASE (1980 to September 2015)
(Appendix 4), CINAHL (1982 to September 2015) (Appendix
5), AMED (1985 to September 2015) (Appendix 6), LLBA (1973
to September 2015), and SpeechBITE (2008 to September 2015)
using comprehensive search strategies.
We also searched major trials registers for ongoing trials in-
cluding ClinicalTrials.gov (to 21 September 2015) (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/), the Stroke Trials Registry (to 21 Septem-
ber 2015) (www.strokecenter.org/trials/), Current Controlled Tri-
als (to 22 September 2015) (www.controlled-trials.com), and
WHO ICTRP (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/) (to 22
September 2015).
Searching other resources
• We handsearched the International Journal of Language and
Communication Disorders (formerly the International Journal of
Disorders of Communication, the European Journal of Disorders of
Communication, and the British Journal of Disorders of
Communication) from 1969 to December 2005. Since 2006, this
journal has been indexed in MEDLINE so our comprehensive
electronic search identified any relevant trials published in the
journal after that date.
• We checked reference lists of all relevant articles to identify
other potentially relevant randomised studies.
• We contacted all British universities and colleges where
speech and language therapists receive training and all relevant
Special Interest Groups in the UK to enquire about any relevant
published, unpublished, or ongoing studies.
• We approached colleagues and authors of relevant
randomised trials to identify additional studies of relevance to
this review.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Our selection criteria for inclusion in this review were as follows.
• Study participants included people with aphasia as a result
of stroke, together with their families.
• The SLT intervention was designed to have an impact on

• The methodological design was a randomised controlled
trial.
One review author (PC) screened titles and abstracts of the records
identified through the electronic searches described above and ex-
cluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained full-text copies of
all the remaining studies that fulfilled the listed inclusion criteria.
Two review authors (MB and PC) independently assessed the stud-
ies based on the inclusion criteria and decided whether to include
or exclude studies. We resolved any disagreements through discus-
sion and involvement of the wider review team. Studies judged
ineligible for inclusion, together with reasons for their exclusion,
are listed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
Data extraction and management
We created and piloted an electronic data extraction tool for use in
this 2016 review update. Two review authors (MB and PC) inde-
pendently confirmed the data for the trials included and extracted
the data for the additional trials included in this update. We re-
solved any disagreements through discussion. We extracted many
data elements, including: number and location of sites, methods
of randomisation, blinding, attrition from intervention, co-inter-
ventions, confounder details, number of participants, age, educa-
tion, handedness, sex, native language, severity of aphasia, time
post onset, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of intervention
in accordance with the template for intervention description and
replication (TIDieR) checklist (Hoffmann 2014), outcome mea-
sures and time points used, evidence of an a priori sample size
calculation, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and summary data.
We attempted to contact investigators for any missing data (or
data in a suitable format) for inclusion in the review.
Where we identified a cross-over trial, we based decisions relating
to the suitability of the data (either up to or beyond the cross-over
phase) on careful consideration of a range of factors including the
intervention(s) used, the timing of the intervention(s), the impact
of any treatment carryover, and whether data from relevant paired
comparisons within the trial were available. Whenever possible, in
such cases we sought individual patient data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed the trials for methodological quality, paying attention
to whether there was protection from the following types of bias:
8

 selection bias (i.e. true random sequencing and true concealment
up to the time of allocation), performance bias (i.e. differences
in co-interventions between the groups), attrition bias (i.e. with-
drawal after trial entry), and detection bias (i.e. ’unmasked’ assess-
ment of outcome). We coded concealed allocation as ’low risk’,
’unclear’ or ’high risk’ according to the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). In addition, we
extracted information on whether trialists employed power cal-
culations and ITT analyses. In some cases, for example where all
participants were accounted for in the final results, this was not
applicable.
Measures of treatment effect
We conducted the review using Review Manager 5 (RevMan) for
statistical analysis (RevMan 2014). We recorded descriptive infor-
mation for each trial (characteristics of participants, interventions,
and outcomes) in the Characteristics of included studies table and
issues relating to the methodological quality of the trial in the
’Risk of bias’ tables. Where trials made a similar comparison and
appeared to be sufficiently similar with respect to their descrip-
tive information, we pooled the summary data (where available)
using meta-analysis. We expressed continuous data as differences
in means or standardised difference in means and dichotomised
data as odds ratios (OR). We used 95% confidence intervals (CI)
throughout the review.
The results of the trials in this review reported measures based
on differences in final value scores (scores taken at the end of
the intervention) and change-from-baseline scores (also known as
change scores). Although the mean differences (MD) based on
change-from-baseline scores in randomised trials can generally be
assumed to address the same intervention effects as MD analysis
based on final value scores, change-from-baseline scores are given
higher weights in analysis than final value scores (Higgins 2011).
For this reason, we have used final value scores within the meta-
analyseswhereverpossible.We donotreportchange-from-baseline
scores unless they were the only available values (Higgins 2011).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, where any het-
erogeneity observed may be considered moderate (an I2 value of
30% to 60%), substantial (50% to 90%) or considerable (75%
to 100%) (Higgins 2011). Where we observed important hetero-
geneity (based of the I2 value together with significant evidence
of heterogeneity as per the Chi2 test P value), we used a random-
effects model (Higgins 2011).
Data synthesis
Where a single outcome measure was assessed and reported across
trials using different measurement tools, we presented these data
in a meta-analysis using a standardised mean difference (SMD)
summary statistic. In cases where the direction of measurement
differed, it was necessary to adjust the direction of some measures
to ensure that all the scales operated in the same direction. For ex-
ample, measures of comprehension ability generally increase with
increasing ability, but in some cases (e.g. the Token Test) improv-
ing comprehension skills might be reflected by decreasing scores,
so it was necessary to multiply the mean values by −1 to ensure
that all the scales operated in the same direction. This method did
not affect standard deviation (SD) values, and we have presented
these within the meta-analyses without the need for a directional
change.
In cases where trials only reported partial summary data, for ex-
ample mean final value scores but not SDs (for example Wertz
1981), we attempted to calculate these values from available in-
formation. When this was not possible, we imputed the SD to
facilitate inclusion of the trial within the review by using a SD
value from a similar participant group (Higgins 2011). We have
reported details of the source of any imputed SD values within the
text. Where there was a choice of possible SD values, we imputed
the highest and lowest values to ensure that both methods pro-
vided a similar overall conclusion and then used the highest value
in the presentation of the trial within the forest plot.
Where results in a particular comparison were only available in
a mixture of final value and change-from-baseline scores, we pre-
sented these data graphically using SMDs, but we were unable to
pool these results in a meta-analysis.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We did not plan any subgroup analyses.
Sensitivity analysis
The original 1999 review did not include any planned sensitivity
analyses. However, we aimed to reflect developments in clinical
practice including trials where SLT interventions were delivered or
facilitated by non-speech and language therapists. We planned to
conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate any impact the inclusion
of these groups of trials may have had on the results of the review
and the impact of trial quality.

Description of studies
The 1999 version of this review included 12 trials, including
Kinsey 1986 and Hartman 1987. Following access to unpublished
data from the authors, we excluded quasi-randomised trials such
as Hartman 1987. We also excluded Kinsey 1986, which is a com-
parison of methods of providing therapy materials rather than a

 comparison of therapy interventions. Thus, of the 12 trials in-
cluded in the 1999 review, 10 trials remained in the subsequent
review updates. We identified an additional 46 trials in the search
updates, and we revised the decision to exclude one other trial,
Shewan 1984, from the original review following communication
with the trialists, who confirmed that it was an RCT. This updated
review is based on data from a total of 57 included trials.
Results of the search
Our search strategy identified 11,314 records from electronic
databases. The flow of literature through the searching and screen-
ing process is shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). De-
tails of the information requested from the authors of included tri-
als, and whether this was obtained, are given in the Characteristics
of included studies table.

 Following our updated search, we identified 18 new trials (23
randomised comparisons) for inclusion in this 2016 review up-
date (B.A.Bar 2011i; B.A.Bar 2011ii; CACTUS 2013; Conklyn
2012; Crosson 2014; FUATAC; Mattioli 2014; MIT 2014i; MIT

2015; Woolf 2015i; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii; Wu 2013;
Xie 2002). In addition we identified 18 ongoing studies (TNT

sion in the review at a later date. These studies are detailed in the
Characteristics of ongoing studies table.
Included studies
We included a total of 57 trials involving 3002 participants in this
review. Several trials contributed to more than one comparison
and so numbers of participants contributing to each comparison
should be considered separately (SLT versus no SLT N = 1620;
SLT versus social support and stimulation N = 447; SLT A versus
SLT B N = 1242) and cannot be summed across comparisons.
Ten trials randomised individuals across three or more groups
(trial arms) but for the purposes of this review and the meta-anal-
yses we have presented and pooled the data within randomised
paired comparisons indicated as i, ii or iii. For example, data from
Yao 2005 are presented across three ’trials’ of SLT versus no SLT
(Yao 2005i), individual SLT versus no SLT (Yao 2005ii) and SLT
versus individual SLT (Yao 2005iii). Other trials affected were

1982i, Lincoln 1982ii, Lincoln 1982iii, MIT 2014i, MIT 2014ii,

Woolf 2015iii, Zhang 2007i, and Zhang 2007ii. In other cases
where a single research group published different trials within the
same year; these are indicated as for example Lincoln 1984a, and
Lincoln 1984b. Further details can be found in the Characteristics
of included studies. In the ’duplicate’ trials, there was a risk of in-
cluding the same group of participants (usually the control group)
twice in a single meta-analysis, so we split the number of partic-
ipants in the control group across the two ’trials’ that shared that
comparison group (Higgins 2011). In the case of continuous data,
the mean and SD values remained the same. In the case of dichoto-
mous data, we split both the number of events and total number
of patients across the relevant number of arms. In keeping with
previous reviews where this method has been used and for ease of
reading, these paired randomised comparisons will be referred to
as trials from this point onwards.
Thirteen trials employed a cross-over design (B.A.Bar 2011i;
B.A.Bar2011ii; Crerar1996; Elman1999; Lincoln 1982i; Lincoln
1982ii; Lincoln 1982iii; Lincoln 1984b; Varley 2016i; Varley
2016ii; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Wertz 1986iii). We carefully
considered the suitability of each cross-over trial for inclusion
within the review. We considered factors including the suitability
of the design, the intervention(s) used, the timing of the interven-
tion(s), the impact of any treatment carry-over and finally whether
data from relevant paired comparisons from the cross-over data
were available. For eight trials we extracted data up to the point
of cross-over (B.A.Bar 2011i; Crerar 1996; Elman 1999; Lincoln
1982iii; Lincoln 1984b; Varley2016i; Wertz1986i; Wertz1986ii).
In some cases though, the treatment that participants were allo-
cated to receive following cross-over was ’no SLT’ or similar. In
these cases, the ’no SLT’ input after cross-over could be used as
a follow-up period or deferred delivery of therapy (e.g. B.A.Bar
2011ii; Varley 2016ii).
In contrast, Lincoln 1982 was also a cross-over trial in design,
with participants randomly allocated to one of four groups with
a sequence of interventions that included one active treatment or
placebo, either preceded by or followed by conventional SLT. We
were able to access the unpublished individual patient trial data for
this review. This access to the data, the design, nature and manner
of SLT delivery within the trial and the clinical relevance of the
comparisons made it possible to include two paired comparisons
of those groups within the review.
• SLT + operant training versus SLT + social support
(Lincoln 1982i).
• Operant training + SLT versus social support + SLT
(Lincoln 1982ii).
Taking the individual data at the point of measurement prior to
the cross-over, it was also possible to extract and compare the data
from those that had received conventional SLT and compare it to
those participants that received a social support and stimulation
intervention (Lincoln 1982iii).
We present data from 73 randomised comparisons as they relate to
the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke, which com-
pare: SLT versus no SLT, SLT versus social support and stimula-
tion, and SLT A versus SLT B. We have presented details of data
within each comparison below with further details on each trial
available in the Characteristics of included studies table. Details
of participants (age, sex, time since stroke, and aphasia severity
by trial (Table 1)), SLT interventions (Appendix 7), and assess-
ment tools (Appendix 1) by randomised group are also available.
A summary of the findings is available at the end of the Results
section (Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary
of findings 2; Summary of findings 3; Summary of findings 4;
Summary of findings 5).

 1. SLT versus no SLT
We included 27 randomised comparisons involving 1620 ran-
domised participants in this section (B.A.Bar 2011i; CACTUS
2013; Conklyn 2012; Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii;
Laska 2011; Lincoln 1984a; Liu 2006a; Lyon 1997; MacKay
1988; Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii;
Szaflarski 2014; Varley 2016i; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Wu
2004; Wu 2013; Xie 2002; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i;
Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000). The SLT intervention was typically
delivered by a speech and language therapist. In three trials, a
therapist-trained volunteer facilitated therapy (CACTUS 2013;
MacKay 1988; Wertz 1986ii), but some trials were based on in-
dependent practice with SLT support (B.A.Bar 2011i; Szaflarski
2014; Varley 2016i). Alternative models of intervention delivery
included administration by a doctor or nurse (Wu 2004; Xie 2002;
Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhao 2000), a music therapist (Conklyn
2012), or other therapists in the rehabilitation setting (Zhang
2007i; Zhang 2007ii). In two trials, it was unclear who facilitated
the SLT intervention (Liu 2006a; Wu 2013). Two additional trials
compared groups that did and did not receive SLT, but the par-
ticipants were not randomly assigned to these ’no SLT’ groups, so
we excluded them from this review (Prins 1989; Shewan 1984).
The trials in this section employed a range of SLT interventions
that might be broadly grouped as conventional SLT (Lincoln
1984a; Liu 2006a; Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006; Smith 1981ii;
Wertz 1986i; Wu 2004; Wu 2013; Xie 2002; Yao 2005ii;
Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii), constraint-induced aphasia therapy
(Szaflarski 2014), melodic intonation therapy (Conklyn 2012),
intensive SLT (B.A.Bar 2011i; Laska 2011; Szaflarski 2014; Smith
1981i; Xie 2002), group SLT (Yao 2005i), volunteer-facilitated
(MacKay 1988; Wertz 1986ii), computer-mediated SLT (B.A.Bar
2011i; CACTUS 2013; Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz
1997ii; Varley 2016i), and functionally-based SLT involving a
communicative partner (Lyon 1997). An acupuncture co-inter-
ventionwasdeliveredalongside the SLTintervention in three com-
parisons (Liu 2006a; Zhao 2000; Zhang 2007ii).
Most participants randomised to the ’no SLT’ groups received no
alternative treatment or support (Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i;
Laska 2011; Lincoln 1984a; Liu 2006a; Lyon 1997; MacKay
1988; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Wu 2004; Yao 2005i; Yao
2005ii). Only seven trials described an intervention within these
’no SLT’ groups. In CACTUS 2013, we considered the control
interventions to be similar to standard poststroke care in the local
region at that time; in Smith 1981i and Smith 1981ii, a health
visitor went to participants’ homes; in Smania 2006, participants
received limb apraxia therapy; and in Zhang 2007i, Zhang 2007ii,
and Zhao 2000, they received medication. The control groups
in Katz 1997ii received computer-based cognitive tasks (’arcade-
style games’) and in B.A.Bar 2011i and Varley 2016i, they received
visual-cognitive computer games, all interventions designed not
to target language rehabilitation.
The timing of SLT interventions after the onset of aphasia varied
widely and is difficult to summarise because of a lack of detailed
reporting. Some trialists recruited participants within two to four
days after the onset of stroke (Laska 2011; Mattioli 2014), while
others recruited participants up to 45 days (Liu 2006a), 10 weeks
(Lincoln 1984a), three months (Conklyn 2012; Wu 2013; Zhang
2007i; Zhang 2007ii) or six months (Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii)
after the stroke. Other trials recruited participants longer after
stroke, for example between two months and three years after
stroke (Smania 2006), or for up to four years (B.A.Bar 2011i).
Other participants were recruited one year or more after their
stroke - up to 17 months in Doesborgh 2004, two years in MacKay
1988, eight years in Varley 2016i, 10 years in Lyon 1997, 19 years
in Katz 1997i, 22 years in Katz 1997ii, and 29 years in CACTUS
2013 (see Table 1 fordetails).Eighttrialsfailedtoreportthe timing
of the SLT intervention in relation to the onset of participants’
aphasia (Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Szaflarski 2014; Wu 2004;
Xie 2002; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhao 2000).
The frequency of SLT was reported as the number of times daily
or as hours per day or per week. Participants received daily SLT
(duration unclear) in two trials (Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii), weekly
SLTforuptoanhour(CACTUS 2013; Conklyn 2012), twohours
(Doesborgh 2004; Lincoln 1984a; Smith 1981ii), three hours (
Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Smania 2006; Wu 2013), four hours
(Laska 2011; Smith 1981i), five hours (Mattioli 2014; Varley
2016i), six hours (MacKay 1988; Xie 2002), eight hours (Lyon
1997), nine hours (B.A.Bar 2011i), or 10 hours (Wertz 1986i;
Wertz 1986ii). An additional six comparisons did not report the
frequencyof the SLTintervention(Liu 2006a; Szaflarski 2014;Wu
2004; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000). Where specified,
the duration of the SLT intervention varied from one session (
Conklyn 2012), two weeks (Mattioli 2014), three weeks (Laska
2011), four weeks (B.A.Bar 2011i), six weeks (Varley 2016i), two
months (Zhao 2000), up to three months (Doesborgh 2004;
Smania 2006; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii);
between five and six months (CACTUS 2013; Katz 1997i; Katz
1997ii; Lincoln 1984a; Lyon 1997; Wu 2004), or for up to one
year (MacKay 1988; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Xie 2002).
The 19 randomised comparisons in this section used a wide range
of outcome measures including functional communication, recep-
tive language, expressive language, severity of impairment, psy-
chosocial impact and economic outcomes. One of the 14 trials did
not report any outcome measures (Wu 2004). Eleven trials carried
out follow-up assessments after SLT at 2 months (Smania 2006),
3 months (B.A.Bar 2011i; Szaflarski 2014; Wertz 1986i; Wertz
1986ii; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii), 5 months (CACTUS 2013), 6
months (Laska 2011; MacKay 1988; Mattioli 2014), 8 months
(CACTUS 2013), and 12 months (MacKay 1988).
2. SLT versus social support and stimulation
We included nine trials with 447 randomised participants in this
section (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982; Elman 1999; Lincoln
13

 1982iii; Rochon 2005; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii; Woolf
2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). They reported a range of SLT ap-
proaches, including conventional SLT (ACTNoW 2011; David
1982; Lincoln 1982iii; Shewan 1984iii; Woolf 2015iii), group
SLT (Elman 1999), telerehabilitation SLT (Woolf 2015ii), lan-
guage-oriented SLT (Shewan 1984ii), and sentence mapping SLT
(Rochon 2005). The social support and stimulation interventions
were provided by paid visitors not previously known to the par-
ticipants with aphasia (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982), nursing
staff (Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii), speech and language ther-
apists or speech and language therapy students (Lincoln 1982iii;
Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), a trained research assistant (Rochon
2005), or through other social group activities including move-
ment classes, creative arts groups, church activities or support
groups (Elman 1999). All visitors providing the ACTNoW 2011
social support received training and a manual of non-therapeu-
tic activities, suitable conversation topics, and access to equip-
ment. David 1982 provided its volunteers with detailed informa-
tion on their patients’ communication problems, and they received
instructions to “encourage their patient to communicate as well
as possible”. Similarly, the nursing staff volunteers received some
information about aphasia and instructions to “stimulate com-
munication to the best of their ability” (Shewan 1984ii; Shewan
1984iii). The volunteers did not receive guidance or instruction
in SLT techniques in any of the four trials. Speech and language
therapy students received a training session in supported conver-
sation approaches (e.g. initiation and adaptation of communica-
tion) and a handbook (Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii).
The duration of participants’ aphasia varied between trials and was
reported as: an average of 12 days (ACTNoW 2011), an average of
between3and5years(Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), upto4weeks
(Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii), up to 3 years (David 1982;
Lincoln 1982iii), 7 months to 28 years (Elman 1999), or between
2 and 9 years (Rochon 2005). Interventions were provided weekly
for up to two hours (David 1982; Lincoln 1982iii; Woolf 2015ii;
Woolf 2015iii), three hours (ACTNoW 2011; Shewan 1984ii;
Shewan 1984iii), or five hours (Elman 1999); or over the course 1
month (Lincoln 1982iii; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), 4 months
(ACTNoW 2011; Elman 1999), 5 months (David 1982), or 12
months (Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii).
Outcome measures used in this comparison included measures
of functional communication, receptive language, expressive lan-
guage and levels of severity of impairment. Five trials carried out
follow-up measures at four weeks (Rochon 2005), three months
(David 1982; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), and six months
(David 1982).
3. SLT A versus SLT B
We included 38 trials involving 1242 randomised participants
in this section (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Bakheit 2007; Crerar 1996;

reported additional groups, but these participants were not ade-
quately randomised to the groups, so we excluded them from this
review (Bakheit 2007; ORLA 2006; Prins 1989; Shewan 1984).
Studies reported a wide range of SLT interventions, including vari-
ations in therapy regimen such as therapy intensity (Bakheit 2007;
Denes 1996; FUATAC; ORLA 2006; Smith 1981iii; SP-I-RiT;
VERSE I), duration of therapy (Di Carlo 1980; Meikle 1979;
ORLA 2010; Pulvermuller 2001; SP-I-RiT), or delayed delivery
(B.A.Bar 2011ii; MIT 2014i; Lyon 1997; Varley 2016ii). Other
comparisons included variation in the delivery approach, such
as volunteer-facilitated SLT (Meikle 1979; Meinzer 2007; Leal
1993; Wertz 1986iii), computer-facilitated SLT (ORLA 2010),
and group SLT (FUATAC; Pulvermuller 2001; Wertz 1981; Yao
2005iii). Variations in the theoretical approach included con-
straint-induced aphasia therapy (FUATAC; Pulvermuller 2001;
Sickert 2014; VERSE II; Wilssens 2015), semantic therapy
(RATS; RATS-2; SEMaFORE; Wilssens 2015), phonological ap-
proaches (Wilssens 2015) or melodic intonation therapy (MIT
2014i; MIT 2014ii). Other trials compared verb versus prepo-
sition therapies (Crerar 1996), filmed programmed instructions
versus non-programmed activity (Di Carlo 1980), or programmed
instruction versus a placebo (Lincoln 1984b).
The average time since onset of participants’ aphasia varied from
less than a week (VERSE I; VERSE II), up to 1 month (Bakheit
2007, Leal 1993; RATS-2; Shewan 1984i; Sickert 2014; Wertz
1981), 2 months (SP-I-RiT; Varley 2016ii; Wertz 1986iii), 3
months (Denes 1996; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii), 4 months
(RATS), 5 months (Lincoln 1982i), 6 months (Lincoln 1984b),
9 months (Lincoln 1982ii, Meikle 1979), 10 months to one
year (Prins 1989), two years (Di Carlo 1980, Drummond 1981;
Hinckley 2001; Van Steenbrugge 1981), three years (B.A.Bar
2011ii; Crosson 2014; Meinzer 2007; Woolf 2015i), four years
(NARNIA 2013; ORLA 2006), five years (Wilssens 2015), six
years (ORLA 2010), seven years (Crerar 1996), or eight years
(Pulvermuller2001). The durationof participants’ aphasiawasun-
available for other trials (FUATAC; SEMaFORE; Smith 1981iii;
Yao 2005iii).
Participants received therapy daily for an unclear time period (
Yao 2005iii), for up to two hours (Crerar 1996; SP-I-RiT), or
for three hours (Meinzer 2007; Pulvermuller 2001). Participants
receiving SLT weekly had cumulative sessions for up to 30 minutes
(Drummond 1981), 45 minutes (FUATAC), 1 hour (Lincoln
1984b), 1.5 hours (Lincoln 1982i; Smith 1981iii), 2 hours (Prins
1989; SEMaFORE; Van Steenbrugge 1981; Woolf 2015i), 3hours
(Di Carlo 1980; FUATAC; RATS; Leal 1993; Shewan 1984i),

 4 hours (Meikle 1979; NARNIA 2013; Smith 1981iii), 5 hours
(Bakheit 2007; Denes 1996; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii; RATS-2;
SP-I-RiT; VERSE II), 6 hours (Varley 2016ii), 7 hours (VERSE
I), 8 hours (Wertz 1981), 9 hours (B.A.Bar 2011ii), 10 hours
(Crosson 2014; ORLA 2006; Wertz 1986iii), 15 hours (Wilssens
2015), or 20 hours (Hinckley 2001). The duration of therapy
ranged from 2 weeks (Drummond 1981; Meinzer 2007; Wilssens
2015), 3 weeks (Crerar 1996; Crosson 2014; SP-I-RiT), 4 weeks
(Lincoln 1984b; VERSE I; Woolf 2015i; Yao 2005iii), 5 weeks (
Hinckley 2001; NARNIA 2013; Pulvermuller2001; VERSEII), 6
weeks (FUATAC; MIT 2014i; ORLA 2006; SEMaFORE; Varley
2016ii), 8 weeks (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Lincoln 1982i; Lincoln 1982ii),
9 weeks (Van Steenbrugge 1981), 10 weeks (SP-I-RiT), 12 weeks
(Bakheit 2007; MIT 2014ii; Wertz 1986iii), 30 weeks (Di Carlo
1980), 5 months (Prins 1989), up to 6 months (Denes 1996; Leal
1993; RATS-2), 9 months (RATS), 10 months (Wertz 1981), one
year (Shewan 1984i; Smith 1981iii), or two years (Meikle 1979).
The self directed therapy intervention varied across participants in
ORLA 2010, with each participant receiving 24 hours of therapy
over a mean treatment duration of 12.62 weeks (range 6 to 22
weeks), and in Varley 2016ii (means reported above).
There was a wide range of outcome measures used in this compar-
ison, including measures of functional communication, receptive
language, expressive language, severity of impairment, and psy-
chosocial impact. Investigators carried out post-treatment follow-
up assessments at five weeks (NARNIA 2013), six weeks (Wertz
1986iii), eight weeks (Sickert 2014; Varley 2016ii), nine weeks
(Van Steenbrugge 1981), three months (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Bakheit
2007; Crosson 2014; SP-I-RiT; VERSE II; Wertz 1986iii; Woolf
2015i; Yao 2005iii), six months (VERSE I, VERSE II), and 12
months (Sickert 2014) .
Excluded studies
We excluded 65 studies. Reasons for exclusion were primarily due
to inadequate randomisation and the unavailability of aphasia-
specific data (see details in the Characteristics of excluded studies
table).
Risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently reviewed the methodological
quality of the included studies and resolved disagreements through
discussion. We present details in the ’Risk of bias’ tables for each
of the trials in the Characteristics of included studies table.
The numberof randomisedparticipantsinincludedstudiesranged
from five participants in Rochon 2005 and Wu 2013 to 327
participants in Lincoln 1984a. Nine comparisons randomised 10
participants or fewer (Crerar 1996; Drummond 1981; Rochon
2005; Van Steenbrugge 1981; Wilssens 2015; Woolf 2015i; Woolf
2015ii; Woolf 2015iii; Wu 2013), 17 randomised between 11
and 20 participants (B.A.Bar 2011i; B.A.Bar 2011ii; Crosson
2014; Denes 1996; Di Carlo 1980; Doesborgh 2004; Hinckley

1984b; Mattioli 2014; Meinzer 2007; NARNIA 2013; ORLA
2006; Pulvermuller 2001; VERSE II), 26 trials randomised up
to 50 participants (CACTUS 2013; Conklyn 2012; Elman 1999;
FUATAC; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Liu 2006a; Lyon 1997;

Varley 2016ii; Xie 2002; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii), 16 trials
randomised between 51 and 100 participants (Bakheit 2007; Leal
1993; MacKay 1988; RATS; RATS-2; Shewan 1984i; Shewan
1984ii; Sickert 2014; VERSE I; Wertz 1981; Wertz 1986i; Wertz
1986ii; Wertz 1986iii; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Yao 2005iii), 2 tri-
als randomised between 101 and 150 (Laska 2011; Zhao 2000),
and 4 randomised more than 150 participants (ACTNoW 2011;
David 1982; Lincoln 1984a; Wu 2004) (see Table 1).
Of the 74 randomised comparisons, only 44 listed both inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Details of exclusion criteria were unavail-
able for an additional 28 trials (B.A.Bar 2011i; B.A.Bar 2011ii;
Crerar 1996; Denes 1996; Di Carlo 1980; Hinckley 2001; Lincoln
1984b; Lyon 1997; MacKay 1988; Meikle 1979; Meinzer 2007;
ORLA 2006; Prins 1989; Rochon 2005; Szaflarski 2014; Van

Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000). Inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria were unavailable for two trials (Drummond 1981;
Wu 2004) (see Characteristics of included studies table).
Suitable statistical data for communication outcomes were only
available for 55 of the 74 trials. Appropriate statistical data for
communication outcomes were not provided or could not be ex-
tracted in the remaining 18 randomised comparisons (Conklyn
2012; Drummond 1981; Elman 1999; FUATAC; Leal 1993;Lyon
1997; MacKay 1988; MIT 2014ii; SEMaFORE; Shewan 1984i;
Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii;
Smith 1981iii; Szaflarski 2014; Wu2004; Wu 2013). Nine of these
trials contributed data on the trial dropouts or withdrawals (Elman
1999; Leal 1993; MacKay 1988; Shewan 1984i; Shewan 1984ii;
Shewan 1984iii; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Smith 1981iii).The
nine remaining trials did not contribute any data to the review
meta-analyses(Conklyn 2012; Drummond 1981; FUATAC;Lyon
1997; MIT 2014ii; SEMaFORE; Szaflarski 2014; Wu 2004; Wu
2013). Psychosocial data were available for three trials (ACTNoW
2011; Lincoln 1984a; SP-I-RiT).
There was a wide range of variation in the descriptions of the SLT
interventions. Most reported the use of a conventional SLT ap-
proach or described an intervention, which reflects clinical prac-
tice where the therapist was responsible for design and content of
the treatment delivered. Other trials evaluated more prescriptive
SLT interventions (including volunteer-facilitated therapy, inten-
sive therapy, constraint-induced asphasia therapy for example); we
will describe these in later sections. We systematically extracted in-
tervention details according to the Template for Intervention De-

 scription and Replication (TIDieR) checklist (Hoffmann 2014),
communicating directly with the trialists to supplement published
information where possible. We present these intervention detail
in the Characteristics of included studies table.
Forty-nine randomised comparisons reported similar groups at
baseline. Comparison between the groups at baseline was unclear
in 10 randomised comparisons (FUATAC; Lincoln 1984b; Lyon
1997; MacKay 1988; SEMaFORE; Wu 2004; Wu 2013; Yao
2005i; Yao 2005ii; Yao 2005iii). For 15 randomised comparisons,
the groups differed despite randomisation in relation to their time
post onset (Pulvermuller 2001), the severity or type of their stroke
(VERSE I; VERSE II), severity of their aphasia (Smith 1981i;
Smith 1981ii), sex (Crerar 1996; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii; RATS-
2; Varley 2016ii), and age (David 1982; RATS; Meinzer 2007;
Prins 1989); in Meikle 1979 the participants that were allocated to
SLT received more weeks of the intervention than the volunteer-
facilitated group (P = 0.01).
Allocation
Details of the method of generating the randomisation sequence
were only available for 32 of the 74 trials (see Figure 2; Figure
3). Twelve used random numbers tables (Bakheit 2007; Conklyn
2012; David 1982; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Laska 2011; Lincoln
1982i; Lincoln 1982ii; Lincoln 1982iii; Lincoln 1984a; Lincoln
1984b; Smania 2006), 20 used computer-generated or web-
based sequence generation (ACTNoW 2011; CACTUS 2013;
Doesborgh 2004; Mattioli 2014; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii;
NARNIA 2013; Varley 2016i; Varley 2016ii; Pulvermuller 2001;
RATS; RATS-2; SP-I-RiT; Sickert 2014; VERSE I; VERSE II;
Wilssens 2015; Woolf 2015i; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), and
one drew lots (Crerar 1996). The remaining 42 trials stated that
participants were randomly allocated but did not report any fur-
ther details. Eight trials described stratifying participants by type
or severity of aphasia (ACTNoW 2011; CACTUS 2013; Crosson
2014; Leal 1993; Shewan 1984i; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii;
SP-I-RiT), and two stratified by recruitment site (ACTNoW
2011; RATS-2).

 Details of the allocation concealment were available for 31 of
the 74 trials (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). Nineteen used sequen-
tially numbered sealed envelopes or similar methods of allocation
and were considered to be adequately concealed (Bakheit 2007;
CACTUS 2013; Conklyn 2012; David 1982; Doesborgh 2004;
Lincoln 1984a; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii; NARNIA 2013; RATS;
SP-I-RiT; Sickert 2014; Varley 2016i; Varley 2016ii; VERSE II;
Wilssens 2015; Woolf 2015i; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). Five
described using an allocation service that was external to the
trial team (ACTNoW 2011; Laska 2011; RATS-2; SEMaFORE;
VERSE I). Seven described a trialist-led allocation method that
inadequately concealed allocation to the groups (Crerar 1996;
Lincoln 1982i; Lincoln 1982ii; Lincoln 1982iii; Lincoln 1984b;
Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006).
Blinding
Due to the nature of SLT, it is difficult to blind either the patient
or the person carrying out the intervention. However, blinding of
the outcome assessor is possible and should be in place to avert de-
tection bias. More than half of the included trials (43/74) reported
blinding of outcome assessors (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). In other
cases, blinding was partially in place. The method of assessment
ensured blinding in some of the outcome measures for three trials
(Crerar 1996; Lincoln 1984b; RATS-2), while six additional tri-
als ensured blinding of a second assessor who checked a propor-
tion of measurements scores (Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Rochon
2005; Woolf 2015i; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). Four trial re-
ports acknowledged the possibility that measures may have been
confounded to some extent by indications from the participants
being assessed as to which group they were attending (ACTNoW
2011; David 1982; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii). This is likely to
have occurred but went unreported in several other trials as well.
Blinding was unclear for 20 trials (Crosson 2014; Di Carlo 1980;
Drummond 1981; FUATAC; Hinckley 2001; Lincoln 1984b; Liu
2006a; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii; ORLA 2006; ORLA 2010; Prins
1989; RATS-2; Shewan 1984i; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii;
Van Steenbrugge 1981; Wilssens 2015; Wu 2013; Zhao 2000),
and we considered it inadequate in 11 trials (Doesborgh 2004;
Elman 1999; Lyon 1997; Meikle 1979; Rochon 2005; Smith
1981i; Smith 1981ii; Smith 1981iii; Woolf 2015i; Woolf 2015ii;
Woolf 2015iii).
Incomplete outcome data
Overall, 25% of the 3002 participants randomised across the 74
comparisons included in this review withdrew from the interven-
tion (N = 518 participants) or were lost to follow-up (N = 254
participants). By specific comparisons, of the 1620 participants in
the SLT versus no SLT comparison, 235 (15%) withdrew from the
treatment phase of the studies: 116 from the SLT interventions
and 117 from the ’no SLT’ allocation. In addition, 46 participants
were lost during the follow-up assessment phase (21 withdrawing
from the SLT groups and 25 from the ’no SLT’ groups). The tri-
als that compared SLT with social support and stimulation ran-
domised a total of 447 participants, but 105 participants (23%)
were lost during the treatment phase (40 from the SLT group and
65 from the social support groups). Twenty-five additional par-
ticipants were not included in the follow-up (David 1982; Elman
1999). The final comparison of SLT A versus SLT B involved 1242
randomised participants. A total of 224 participants (18%) with-
drew from these trials during the treatment phase, with an addi-
tional 90 withdrawing from the follow-up phase. Across the re-
view, studies reported an additional five participants withdrawing
from a trial, but it was unclear to which group(s) those participants
were allocated (Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Smith 1981iii). Par-
ticipants in Meikle 1979 remained in the trial until two successful
estimations on an outcome measure showed no appreciable im-
provement, until participants requested withdrawal, or until the
end of the trial; however, authors gave no further details. Where
available, we present details of dropouts in Table 2.
Selective reporting
Recruitment and retention of stroke rehabilitation trial partici-
pants is known to be a challenge, and the trials in this review
were no exception. However, seven trials only reported data (in-
cluding demographic data) from participants that remained in the
trial at the end of treatment or at follow-up. David 1982 reported
data from 133 of 155 randomised participants, Doesborgh 2004
reported 18 of 19 randomised participants, Katz 1997i reported
36 of 42 randomised participants, Katz 1997ii reported 40 of 42
randomised participants, Lincoln 1984a reported 191 of 327 ran-
domisedparticipants,MacKay 1988 reported95of 96randomised
participants, and Smania 2006 reported 33 of 41 randomised par-
ticipants.
We considered most included studies (54/74) to be at low risk of
reporting bias (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). We judged 11 stud-
ies as having an unclear risk of reporting bias (Conklyn 2012;
Drummond 1981; Elman 1999; Leal 1993; SEMaFORE; Smania
2006; Szaflarski 2014; Wertz 1981; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii;
Zhao 2000), and we considered eight trials to be at high risk
of reporting bias (FUATAC; MacKay 1988; Smith 1981i; Smith
1981ii; Smith 1981iii; Wu 2004; Wu 2013; Xie 2002). We pro-
vide details of the reporting bias in the Characteristics of included
studies.
Twelve trials reported using ITT analysis (ACTNoW 2011;
Bakheit 2007; CACTUS 2013; Laska 2011; MIT 2014i; MIT
2014ii; RATS; RATS-2; SP-I-RiT; Varley 2016i; Varley 2016ii,
VERSE I). Not all participants appeared to be included in the
18

 final analyses within two trials (Bakheit 2007; RATS). In addi-
tion, 28 trials that reported participants that had dropped out
did not report using ITT analysis (David 1982; Doesborgh 2004;
Elman 1999; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Leal 1993; Lincoln 1982i;
Lincoln 1982ii; Lincoln 1982iii; Lincoln 1984a; MacKay 1988;
Mattioli 2014; Meikle 1979; Pulvermuller 2001; SEMaFORE;
Shewan 1984i; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii; Sickert 2014;
Smania 2006; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Smith 1981iii; VERSE
II; Wertz 1981; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Wertz 1986iii). We
were unable to clarify the number of drop-outs in three trials
(Conklyn 2012; FUATAC; Szaflarski 2014). All randomised par-
ticipants were included in the final analyses for the remaining 31
trials.
Other potential sources of bias
Some trials that compared the effects of SLT with no SLT also
reported co-interventions. Two groups that received SLT also re-
ceived acupuncture (Liu 2006a; Zhang 2007ii). Some participants
in Doesborgh 2004 received additional psychosocial group ther-
apy, and some (or all) of the participants reported in Smith 1981i
may have benefited from other intensive treatment as part of the
larger multidisciplinary stroke trial. In both cases, the number
and allocation of the participants and specific details of the co-
intervention were unavailable. In other cases, not all participants
received the planned number of treatment sessions (Laska 2011;
Lincoln 1984a; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii).
Similarly, 11 trials that compared two different approaches with
SLT provision reported that not all participants received the
planned number of treatment sessions (Bakheit 2007; Lincoln
1982i; Lincoln 1982ii; Meikle 1979; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii;
RATS-2; Smith 1981iii; SP-I-RiT; VERSE I; VERSE II). Meikle
1979 reported that 5 of the 16 participants receiving conventional
SLT missed up to half of their possible treatment. Six trials com-
paring a high-intensity SLT with a low-intensity SLT also reported
difficulties providing intensive SLT interventions as planned. For
example, Bakheit 2007 reported that only 13 of the 51 partici-
pants received 80% or more of the planned intensive interven-
tion. Smith 1981iii reported that participants allocated to inten-
sive therapy only received an average of 21 hours of therapy com-
pared to the planned minimum of 50 hours during the first three
months. Such difficulties in maintaining a clear distinction be-
tween the two treatment groups has significant implications when
evaluating the results and considering the clinical implications of
such treatment regimens. Similarly, VERSE I found that six indi-
viduals did not reach the intensive SLT intervention target of 2.5
hours, but they also reported that resource limitations in the con-
ventional acute care service meant that 23 individuals in the usual
care group failed to receive the maximum once weekly therapy as
allocated. ORLA 2010 reported difficulty maintaining a consis-
tent intensity of treatment across two treatment arms, with some
participants choosing to have more of the allocated 24 treatment
sessions per week than others.
Though all the speech and language therapists in Hinckley 2001
received training in the characteristics of the two treatment ap-
proaches being compared, treatment review processes were in place
to minimise any possible risk of overlap in therapy approach.
ACTNoW 2011, Woolf 2015i, Woolf 2015ii, and Woolf 2015iii
employed a similar monitoring approach to ensure fidelity to the
planned interventions. The computer-based intervention used in
Varley 2016i and Varley 2016ii recorded the self directed com-
putertreatmentactivityandduration. Datafromthree randomised
comparisons were subgroups of participants with aphasia extracted
from within a larger trial examining models of stroke care (Smith
1981i; Smith 1981ii; Smith 1981iii). Being part of a larger stroke
trial may have affected their levels of fatigue and ability to partic-
ipate fully in the SLT intervention. The main trial described the
inclusion of 20 participants with mild dementia, but it is unclear
whether any of these individuals were included in the aphasia-
specific data.

The results of this review are presented below within the three
comparisons: SLT versus no SLT, SLT versus social support and
stimulation, and SLT A versus SLT B. Where data availability
permitted, we also report results from meta-analyses. As described
in the Measures of treatment effect section, we extracted the final
value scores for inclusion within this review whenever possible.
Change-from-baseline data were also available for three trials, but
we do not present them in the review (Denes 1996; Hinckley
2001; RATS).
Comparison 1: SLT versus no SLT
A total of 1620 participants were randomised across 27 compar-
isons that assessed SLT versus no SLT (B.A.Bar 2011i; CACTUS
2013; Conklyn 2012; Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii;
Laska 2011; Lincoln 1984a; Liu 2006a; Lyon 1997; MacKay
1988; Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii;
Szaflarski 2014; Varley 2016i; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Wu
2004; Wu 2013; Xie 2002; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i;
Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000). Reporting of age and other participant
characteristics varied between trials, making it difficult to give an
overview of the participants involved in this comparison. Eight tri-
als reported age ranges, spanning 28 to 94 years of age (CACTUS
2013; Laska 2011; Lincoln 1984a; Lyon 1997; Mattioli 2014;

 Smania 2006; Varley 2016i; Wu 2004), while others reported par-
ticipants’ mean age or age bands (Table 1). Nineteen trials reported
the length of time since onset of aphasia: spanning from two days
in Mattioli 2014 to 29 years in CACTUS 2013. The shortest
mean length of time since the onset of participants’ aphasia was
2.2 (SD 1.3) days (Mattioli 2014). Fourteen trials reported sever-
ity of aphasia (B.A.Bar 2011i; CACTUS 2013; Doesborgh 2004;
Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Laska 2011; Liu 2006a; Mattioli 2014;
Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Zhang
2007i; Zhang 2007ii), although three additional trials provided
some indication of severity of impairment (Conklyn 2012; Lyon
1997; Smania 2006) (Table 1).
Among the SLT interventions compared to a ’no SLT’ group
were interventions considered to be conventional SLT (Liu 2006a;
Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006; Smith 1981ii; Wertz 1986i; Wu
2004; Wu 2013; Xie 2002; Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang
2007ii; Zhao 2000), computer-mediated SLT (B.A.Bar 2011i;
CACTUS 2013; Doesborgh 2004; Katz1997i; Katz1997ii; Varley
2016i), group SLT (Yao 2005i), functional SLT (Lyon 1997), in-
tensive SLT (Laska 2011; Smith 1981i; Szaflarski 2014), language
enrichment therapy (Laska 2011), constraint-induced aphasia
therapy (Szaflarski 2014), melodic intonation therapy (Conklyn
2012), SLT plus operant training (Lincoln 1984a), independent
training (B.A.Bar 2011i; Varley 2016i), and volunteer-facilitated
SLT (CACTUS 2013; MacKay 1988; Wertz 1986ii). We planned
to conduct a sensitivity analysis on trials that involved the pro-
vision of SLT by non-speech and language therapists (Conklyn
2012; Liu 2006a; MacKay 1988; Wertz 1986ii; Xie 2002; Yao
2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000), but
because of the present availability of data within each outcome, it
was not useful to undertake this analysis.
Appropriate summary data for communication outcomes (allow-
ing inclusion in the meta-analyses) were available for 17 of the
27 trials (B.A.Bar 2011i; CACTUS 2013; Doesborgh 2004; Katz
1997i; Katz 1997ii; Liu 2006a; Lincoln 1984a; Mattioli 2014;
Smania 2006; Varley 2016i; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Yao
2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000). In
addition, Lincoln 1984a also reported statistical data for psychoso-
cial outcomes. Suitable communication outcome summary data
were not reported (or available on request) for the remaining nine
trials (Conklyn 2012, Lyon 1997; MacKay 1988; Szaflarski 2014;
Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Wu 2004; Wu 2013; Xie 2002). How-
ever, Xie 2002 presented some summary data in a table that indi-
cated language function at end of the trial intervention on a scale
(no effect, progress, obvious effect, recovery), and using this data,
we constructed means and standard deviation data by assigning
numerical values (0 to 3) to each scale point. However, we noted
that the presentation of the table did not match the description of
results in the text; in fact, the table reported an adverse interven-
tion effect and deterioration over time, which we believe was an
error that was rectified by inverting the scale reported. Where data
for this comparison were available, we present them below in rela-
tion to: functional communication, receptive language, expressive
language, severity of impairment, psychosocial impact, number
of dropouts, adherence to allocated intervention, and economic
outcomes.
1. Functional communication
Thirteen trials compared participants that received SLT with
those that did not, by measuring functional communication out-
comes (B.A.Bar 2011i; Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii;
Mattioli 2014; Laska 2011; Lincoln 1984a; Lyon 1997; MacKay
1988; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii).
Tools used included the spontaneous speech subtest of the West-
ern Aphasia Battery (WAB) (Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii), the Am-
sterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT) (B.A.Bar
2011i; Doesborgh 2004; Laska 2011), the AAT (spontaneous
speech) (Mattioli 2014) the Communication Activities of Daily
Living (CADL) (Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii), the Functional
Communication Profile (FCP) (Lincoln 1984a; Wertz 1986i;
Wertz 1986ii), the Aachen-Sprach-Analysis (B.A.Bar 2011i), and
the Chinese Functional Communication Profile (Zhang 2007i;
Zhang 2007ii). Ten trials provided suitable statistical data per-
mitting inclusion within the meta-analyses (B.A.Bar 2011i;
Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Laska 2011; Mattioli
2014; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii).
Spontaneous speech
Six trials evaluated the impact of SLT by contrasting the sponta-
neous speech of participants. Intervention groups received com-
puter-mediated SLT in four trials (B.A.Bar 2011i; Doesborgh
2004; Katz1997i; Katz1997ii), andtheyreceivedlanguage enrich-
ment therapy in two (Laska 2011; Mattioli 2014). Control groups
received no intervention in Doesborgh 2004, Katz 1997i, Laska
2011, and Mattioli 2014, and they received computer-mediated
non-linguistic tasks in B.A.Bar 2011i and Katz 1997ii). Investi-
gators carried out comparisons using a subtest of the WAB (Katz
1997i; Katz 1997ii), the ANELT (B.A.Bar 2011i; Doesborgh
2004; Laska 2011), or the AAT (Mattioli 2014).
Communication Activities of Daily Living (CADL)
Four trials used the CADL to compare the functional communi-
cation skills of participants that received conventional SLT (Wertz
1986i), volunteer-facilitated SLT (MacKay 1988; Wertz 1986ii),
and functional SLT (Lyon 1997), versus those that received no
SLT intervention. Two trials provided statistical data that allowed
inclusion within a meta-analysis (Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii).
Functional Communication Profile (FCP)
20
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Three trials compared the pragmatic provision of SLT (approach
tailored to individual participants’ needs) to a deferred SLT in-
tervention using the FCP (Lincoln 1984a; Wertz 1986i; Wertz
1986ii). Appropriate summary data for Lincoln 1984a on this out-
come measure were not available.
Chinese Functional Communication Profile (CFCP)
Zhang 2007i and Zhang 2007ii used the CFCP to compare groups
that received SLT and no SLT. One SLT group also received an
acupuncture co-intervention and scored higher on the CFCP than
those that had received no SLT (Zhang 2007ii).
We pooled the results of functional communication measures re-
ported across the trials within a meta-analysis. We only included
one set of functional communication measures from Wertz 1986i
and Wertz 1986ii at a time. Participants that received SLT per-
formed better on measures of functional communication than
those that did not receive SLT (when including the CADL data: P
= 0.03, SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.44 or when including FCP
data: P = 0.01, SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49). We have chosen
to present the data from the FCP within the forest plot (Analysis
1.1).
2. Receptive language
Twelve of the 27 trials measured participants’ receptive language
skills (CACTUS 2013, Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Laska 2011;
Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006; Varley 2016i; Wertz 1986i; Wertz
1986ii; Xie 2002; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii), and all but two
reported statistical data that permitted inclusion in the meta-
analyses (Varley 2016i; Xie 2002). We calculated suitable sum-
mary data from Xie 2002’s published table of results (as described
above). Investigators assessed auditory comprehension using the
Token Test and subtests of the WAB, the Norsk Grunntest for
Afasi (NGA), the Aphasia Battery of Chinese (ABC), the Com-
prehensive Aphasia Test (CAT), and the PICA. Reading compre-
hension was measured using the Reading Comprehension Battery
for Aphasia (RCBA) and the reading subtests of the PICA, the
CAT, and the ABC. Gesture comprehension was measured using
an unnamed assessment.
Auditory comprehension
Five trials used the Token Test to measure changes in participants’
auditory comprehension (CACTUS 2013, Mattioli 2014; Smania
2006; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii). Two trials used the ABC audi-
tory comprehension subtest (Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii). Laska
2011 reported using the NGA, CACTUS 2013 the CAT spo-
ken word and spoken sentence subtests, and Mattioli 2014 the
AAT subtest. Two trials used both the WAB and PICA subtests to
measure participants’ auditory comprehension (Katz 1997i; Katz
1997ii). We could not include both sets of data from Katz 1997i;
Katz 1997ii, CACTUS 2013 and Mattioli 2014 in the same meta-
analysis. On pooling the data within two separate meta-analy-
ses, there was no evidence of a significant difference between the
groups. We have chosen to present the PICA (Katz 1997i; Katz
1997ii), the CAT (spoken sentence comprehension subtest), and
Token Test data (Mattioli 2014) within the forest plot (Analysis
1.2). For pooled analyses using the Mattioli 2014 AAT data and
the Katz 1997i and Katz 1997ii WAB data, there was no evidence
of a difference between the groups (P = 0.57, SMD 0.06, 95% CI
−0.15 to 0.26).
Reading comprehension
Nine trials assessed reading comprehension, comparing partici-
pants that received SLT and those that did not (CACTUS 2013,
Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Meikle 1979; Varley 2016i; Wertz 1986i;
Wertz 1986ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii). Two trials used the
RCBA to compare participants that received volunteer-facilitated
SLT with those that received no SLT (Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii).
Similarly, two trials used the PICA reading subtest to compare
participants that received computer-mediated SLT to those that
received no treatment or computer-mediated non-linguistic tasks
(Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii). Another three trials compared the per-
formance of participants that received SLT with those that did
not using the reading subtest of the ABC (Zhang 2007i; Zhang
2007ii), subtests from the CAT (written word or sentence com-
prehension; CACTUS 2013), or the AAT reading comprehension
subtest (Mattioli 2014). Varley 2016i did not report data suitable
for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The participants that received
SLT in Zhang 2007ii also received an acupuncture co-interven-
tion. On pooling of the available data with the CAT data on writ-
ten word comprehension, the participants that received SLT per-
formed better on tests of reading comprehension than those that
did not receive SLT (P = 0.03, SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.55;
CACTUS 2013; Analysis 1.3). If pooling data from CACTUS
2013 CAT subtest of written sentence comprehension, there was
no longer evidence of a difference between the groups (P = 0.05;
SMD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.52). Plotting these outcome mea-
sures against the estimated standard errors within a funnel plot, we
found that the result from one of the trials based on the ABC fell
outside the 95% CI (Figure 4). We will consider this issue further
in the Discussion section.

Other comprehension
Four trials used the PICA gestural subtest, which measures gestu-
ral abilities alongside auditory and written comprehension skills
(Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii). Xie 2002
employed the Chinese Language Impairment Examination. Fol-
lowingpooling, participantsthatreceivedSLT hadachievedhigher
scores on measures of gesture use than the groups that received no
SLT (P = 0.03, SMD 1.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.36). However, we
also observed significant heterogeneity (P < 0.00001; I2 = 91%)
which was no longer observed when the Xie 2002 data was re-
moved from the meta-analysis, al though this did not impact on
the findings (P = 0.04, SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67) (Analysis
1.4).
3. Expressive language
Twelve trials formally evaluated participants’ expressive language
skills using single word picture naming (Boston Naming Test
(BNT), the WAB and NGA naming subtests, the AAT, the Ob-
ject and Action Naming Battery or other naming tests), rep-
etition (WAB and NGA repetition subtests), and other verbal
expression (PICA and ABC sub tests) skills (CACTUS 2013;
Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Laska 2011; Mattioli
2014; Szaflarski 2014; Varley 2016i; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii;
Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii). Written language expressive skills
were measured using the PICA copying and writing subtests and
the ABC writing subtest, while the ability to communicate using
gesture was measured using the PICA gesture subtest.
Expressive language: naming
Eight trials measured participants’ naming abilities (CACTUS
2013; Doesborgh 2004; Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Laska 2011
Mattioli 2014; Szaflarski 2014; Varley 2016i). Three trials used
the BNT or naming accuracy (treated, matched and control items)
to compare a group receiving computer-mediated SLT or con-
straint-induced aphasia therapy versus a group that did not receive
SLT (Doesborgh 2004; Szaflarski 2014; Varley 2016i). Data from
22

 Szaflarski 2014 were not available at the time of this review. Katz
1997i and Katz 1997ii employed the WAB naming subtest, while
Laska 2011 used the NGA naming subtest, Mattioli 2014 used
the AAT subtest, and CACTUS 2013 used items from the Object
and Action Naming Battery. On pooling, there was no evidence of
a difference between the groups regardless of whether the treated,
matched or control items from Varley 2016i were included in the
analysis. We present the meta-analysis that includes the matched
items from Varley 2016i (P = 0.26, SMD 0.14, 95% CI −0.10 to
0.38; Analysis 1.5).
Expressive language: general
Five trials used the PICA verbal subtest to compare the spoken
language skills of patient groups that received SLT and those that
did not (Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii;
Xie 2002). Two additional trials captured participants’ expressive
language skills using a subtest of the ABC (Zhang 2007i; Zhang
2007ii). On pooling the data using SMDs, there was evidence
of significant statistical heterogeneity between the groups (P <
0.00001; I2 = 89%), so we used a random-effects model to pool
the data. Participants that had received SLT scored significantly
better on general measures of expressive language skills (P = 0.005,
SMD 1.28, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.19) (Analysis 1.6). Conducting a
sensitivity analysis, we found that when we removed Xie 2002,
Zhang 2007i, and Zhang 2007ii from the analysis, the hetero-
geneity disappeared (I2 = 0%), and the pooled results no longer
demonstrated a significant difference between the groups. We will
consider this issue further in the Discussion section.
Expressive language: written
Eight trials reported comparing a group receiving SLT with a
group receiving no SLT using writing subtests of the PICA (Katz
1997i; Katz 1997ii), the ABC (Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii), the
AAT (Mattioli 2014), the CAT (CACTUS 2013), and the PICA
graphic subtest (Wertz 1986i; Wertz 1986ii). Following pooling,
participants that had received SLT performed better on the writ-
ing subtests than those that had not received SLT (P = 0.003,
SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.67) (Analysis 1.7). Plotting these
outcome measures against the estimated standard errors within a
funnel plot, we found that the result from one of the trials based
on the ABC fell outside the 95% CI (Figure 5). We will consider
this issue further in the Discussion section.

Funnel plot of comparison: 1 SLT versus no SLT, outcome: 1.7 Expressive language: written.
Expressive language: copying text
Two trials compared a group receiving computer-mediated SLT
with a group receiving no SLT or a group receiving computer-
mediated non-linguistic tasks using the PICA copying subtest (
Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii). There was no evidence of a difference
between the groups’ copying skills (Analysis 1.8).
Expressive language: repetition
Four trials compared participants that received SLT and those that
did not by measuring their repetition skills on the WAB subtest
(Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii), the NGA subtest (Laska 2011), and a
repetition accuracy test (Varley 2016i). Following pooling of the
available data (using the matched items from Varley 2016i), there
was no evidence of a difference in the participants’ repetition skills
(Analysis 1.9). This did not alter if the treated or control items
were used from Varley 2016i.
Expressive language: fluency
B.A.Bar 2011i measured changes in word fluency using the Re-
gensburg Word Fluency Test (food and animals). Szaflarski 2014
used the Semantic Fluency Test, but there were no data available.
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
1.10).
4. Severity of impairment
Seventeen trials compared a group that received SLT with one
that did not receive any SLT by measuring the severity of the par-
ticipants’ aphasia impairment. Language assessment batteries in-
cluded the PICA (Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii; Lincoln 1984a; Wertz
1986i; Wertz 1986ii), the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examina-
tion (BDAE) (Liu 2006a; Lyon 1997, Wu 2013), the Chinese
Aphasia Measurement (Zhao 2000), the WAB (Katz 1997i; Katz
1997ii; Wu 2013), the Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis
of Aphasia (MTDDA) (Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii), the NGA
(Laska 2011), the Chinese RehabilitationResearch Centre Aphasia
24

 Examination (CRRCAE) (Wu 2013; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii), the
Aphasia Battery of Chinese (ABC) (Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii),
and the Chinese Language Impairment Examination (Xie 2002).
Included trials compared the severity of participants’ aphasia be-
tween groups that received group SLT (Yao 2005i), computer-
mediated SLT (Katz 1997i; Katz 1997ii), conventional SLT (Liu
2006a; Wertz 1986i; Wu 2013, Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang
2007ii; Zhao 2000), language training (Xie 2002), and volunteer-
facilitated SLT (Wertz 1986ii), versus groups that received no SLT
or a computer-mediated non-SLT intervention (Katz 1997ii). We
were able to obtain statistical summary data suitable for inclusion
within a meta-analysis from all but six trials (Lincoln 1984a; Lyon
1997; Smith 1981i; Smith 1981ii; Xie 2002; Wu 2013).
Pooling the available data (selectively including the PICA data
from Katz 1997i and Katz 1997ii) using SMDs, we observed sig-
nificant heterogeneity (I2 = 93%, P < 0.00001). Thus, we pooled
the data using a random-effects model. The heterogeneity re-
mained. There was no evidence of a significant difference between
the groups that received SLT and those that did not (Analysis
1.11). On conducting a sensitivity analysis to identify the source
of the heterogeneity, we observed that removing the Zhao 2000
data from the meta-analysis eliminated the heterogeneity (I2 =
0%). The pooled data also demonstrated no significant difference
between the aphasia severity ratings between the groups regardless
of whether the PICA data from Katz 1997i and Katz 1997ii were
included (P = 0.08, SMD 0.17, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.36). Con-
ducting the same analysis but including the WAB data from Katz
1997i and Katz 1997ii resulted in no evidence of a significant dif-
ference between the groups (P = 0.09, SMD 0.15, 95% CI −0.04
to 0.34). We have chosen to present the PICA data (Analysis 1.11).
The funnel plot of Analysis 1.11 (Figure 6) showed that the out-
come based on the Chinese Aphasia Measurement fell outside the
95% CI. We will return to this issue within the Discussion section.

 5. Mood
Five trials compared the benefits of an SLT intervention to no SLT
by employing psychosocial measures including the Multiple Affect
Adjective Checklist (MAACL), the General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ), the Affect Balance Scale (ABS), the Psychological Well-
being Index, the EuroQoL, and the Nottingham Health Profile
(NHP) (Laska 2011; Lincoln 1984a; Lyon 1997; Smith 1981i;
Smith 1981ii).
Lyon 1997 used the ABS and Psychological Wellbeing Index to
compare a group of triads (person with aphasia, caregiver and com-
munication partner) that received functional SLT aiming to es-
tablish and maximise effective means of communication between
communication partners and a group that received no SLT. Smith
1981i and Smith 1981ii used the GHQ to compare groups that
received either intensive SLT or conventional SLT with a group
that received no treatment, while Laska 2001 reported capturing
data using the EuroQol and the NHP
. No suitable data were avail-
able from these trials. In contrast, Lincoln 1984a used the anxi-
ety, depression and hostility scales of the MAACL to compare the
psychosocial well-being of a group that received SLT (determined
by the therapist) with a group that received no SLT. Comparison
of the groups failed to show any evidence of a difference in the
participants’ anxiety, depression or hostility as measured on these
scales (Analysis 1.12).
6. Number of dropouts
Information relating to the numbers of participant dropouts
(where they occurred) was available for all but two trials in this
comparison (Conklyn 2012, Szaflarski 2014). A total of 235 in-
dividuals withdrew during the treatment phase. Thirteen trials
reported no withdrawals (B.A.Bar 2011i; CACTUS 2013; Liu
2006a; Lyon 1997; Mattioli 2014; Wu 2004; Wu 2013, Xie 2002,
Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii; Zhao 2000).
An additional five participants withdrew from Smith 1981i and
Smith 1981ii (group allocation is unclear, but these withdrawals
are included in the number above), and they failed to report the
number of withdrawals from the ’no SLT’ group. There was a
range of reasons for the attrition of participants from the trials
(see Table 2 for details). On pooling of the available data relating
to dropouts, there was no evidence of a difference between the
groups (Analysis 1.14).
7. Adherence to allocated intervention
Only 5 of the 15 trials reporting participant dropouts described
the reasons for the 26 participants’ withdrawal (CACTUS 2013;
Doesborgh 2004; Laska 2011; Smania 2006; Varley 2016i). Of
these, a total of 21 participants were described as withdrawing be-
cause they were uncooperative or they refused the allocated treat-
ment with nine withdrawing from the conventional SLT group
and 12 withdrawing from the ’no SLT’ group. Four participants in
Laska 2011 refused testing (one from the SLT group; three from
the no SLT group). Details can be found in Table 2. On pooling
there was no indication of a difference in adherence rates between
the groups.
8. Economic outcomes
Two of the 19 randomised comparisons described the measure-
ment of economic outcomes: MacKay 1988 using structured ques-
tionnaires and CACTUS 2013 the EQ-5D (and the patient visual
analogue scale (VAS)) and resource use (diary based). Only data
from CACTUS 2013 were available for this review, and there was
no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 1.13).
9. Follow-up data (comparison 1: SLT versus no SLT)
Eight trials comparing SLT versus no SLT also gathered data at
a follow-up point after the formal intervention period. Of these
trials, B.A.Bar 2011ii and Szaflarski 2014 did not report data suit-
able for inclusion in the review, while data from the remaining six
trials are presented below in relation to: functional communica-
tion, receptive language, expressive language, severity of impair-
ment, number of dropouts, and adherence to allocated interven-
tion (CACTUS 2013; Laska 2011, Mattioli 2014; Smania 2006;
Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii).
1. Functional communication
Both Laska 2011 and Mattioli 2014 measured functional com-
munication at six months using the ANELT and the AAT and
compared performance of people who received SLT and those that
did not. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(Analysis 2.1).
2. Receptive language
Auditory comprehension
Participants’ auditory comprehension six months following inter-
vention was compared using the AAT subtest (Mattioli 2014), the
Token Test (Mattioli 2014), and the NGA (Laska 2011). To avoid
double-counting the Mattioli 2014 trial data, we presented the
pooled data using the AAT auditory comprehension subtest data
(Analysis 2.2). There was no evidence of a difference between the
groups. We obtained similar findings in the meta-analysis using
the Token Test (P = 0.45; 1.24 CI 95% −1.94 to 4.41).
Reading
Mattioli 2014 also assessed reading in participants receiving SLT
versus no SLT using the AAT subtest; there was no evidence of a
different between the groups (Analysis 2.3).

 4. Expressive language
Naming
CACTUS 2013 evaluated the naming abilities of participants who
had received SLT versus those that had not at three months follow-
up using items from the Object and Action Naming Battery, while
at six months, Laska 2011 used the NGA, and Mattioli 2014 the
AAT naming subtest (Analysis 2.4).
Writing
Similarly, Mattioli 2014 used the AAT written subtest to evaluate
writing abilities (Analysis 2.5).
Repetition
Mattioli 2014 and Laska 2011 also assessed repetition abilities
using the AAT repetition subtest and the NGA, respectively, at six
months after intervention (Analysis 2.6). There was no evidence
of a difference between the groups on any of these measures of
expressive language ability at three or six months’ follow-up.
5. Severity of impairment
At six months follow-up, Laska 2011 compared the severity of
participants’ aphasia using the NGA, and Yao 2005i and Yao
2005ii used the CRRCAE Aphasia Quotient. On pooling the data,
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
2.7).
6. Economic outcomes
The CACTUS 2013 trial captured EQ-5D and Patient VAS data
at three-month follow-up after the end of treatment and found no
evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 2.8).
7. Number of dropouts
Six trials also reported attrition from the follow-up data collection
point (CACTUS 2013; Laska 2011, Smania 2006, Mattioli 2014;
Wertz 1986i, Wertz 1986ii). Of 181 participants receiving SLT, 21
were reported as lost to follow-up, while 25 of the 136 people who
did not receive SLT were not followed up. There was no evidence
of a difference between the groups (Analysis 2.9).
Comparison 2: SLT versus social support and
stimulation
Nine trials compared the provision of SLT to the provision of
informal social support and stimulation in a total of 447 par-
ticipants (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982; Elman 1999; Lincoln
1982iii; Rochon 2005; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii, Woolf
2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). Descriptions of participant groups within
trials were variable, so it is difficult to give a precise overview of
the participants included in this comparison. Most trials described
the participants’ age range, which spanned from 18 to 97 years
(ACTNoW 2011; Elman 1999; Lincoln 1982iii; Rochon 2005;
Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii). David 1982 reported that par-
ticipants in the SLT and social support and stimulation groups
had a mean age of 70 (SD 8.7) years and 65 (SD 10.6) years,
respectively, indicating a significant difference between the groups
(P = 0.003). Details can be found in Table 1. All nine trials de-
tailed the length of time since aphasia onset. ACTNoW 2011 ran-
domised participants with the most acute aphasia (interquartile
range (IQR) 9 to 16 days duration). Similarly, Shewan 1984ii and
Shewan 1984iii recruited people at two to four weeks post onset
of aphasia. In contrast, Lincoln 1982iii recruited participants at 1
to 36 months’ poststroke, while Woolf 2015ii and Woolf 2015iii
recruited at a mean of 31.8 (14.11) and 35.2 (33.16) months post
onset, respectively. Other trials recruited participants much later
after stroke, ranging from 2 to 9 years in Rochon 2005 to 7 months
to 28 years in Elman 1999. All nine trials reported on severity of
aphasia to varying degrees of detail. Lincoln 1982iii recruited par-
ticipants with moderate degrees of aphasia. Six trials described the
recruitment of participants with a range of mild to severe apha-
sia (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982; Elman 1999; Rochon 2005;
Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii), and two trials reported scores
on a naming measure (Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii) (Table 1).
There were a number of approaches to the provision of SLT inter-
ventions in the trials: five provided conventional SLT (ACTNoW
2011; David 1982; Lincoln 1982iii; Shewan 1984iii; Woolf
2015iii), and the others provided group SLT (Elman 1999),
sentence-mapping SLT (Rochon 2005), language-orientated SLT
(Shewan 1984ii), or telerehabilitation SLT (Woolf 2015ii). These
SLT interventions were then compared with the provision of social
support and stimulation, which also took a variety of formats. Un-
structured support and communicative stimulation were provided
by nurses (Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii), a trained research as-
sistant (Rochon 2005), a clinical psychologist (Lincoln 1982iii),
speech and language therapy students (Woolf 2015ii ; Woolf
2015iii), paid visitors (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982), or through
attendance at an externally organised support group or class, for
example dance classes or church groups (Elman 1999). Most were
face-to-face social support. Two used an Internet-supported video-
conferencing tool. Some volunteers had been given detailed in-
formation about their own participant’s particular presentation
of aphasia (David 1982), but they were not given any train-
ing in SLT techniques (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982; Lincoln
1982iii; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii). Two trials had a spe-
cific, non-therapeutic intervention protocol for the people pro-
viding the social support and stimulation intervention, which de-
tailed the role and suitable non-communication therapy activi-
ties (ACTNoW 2011; Lincoln 1982iii). Other providers of so-
cial support received a handbook and training in supported con-
versation (Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). Six trials described in-
tervention fidelity monitoring (ACTNoW 2011; Shewan 1984ii;
27
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Shewan 1984iii; David 1982; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), to-
gether with monitoring of a percentage of the overall sessions
in three of these (David 1982; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii).
The participants in these groups received social support for up
to one hour (ACTNoW 2011; Rochon 2005), two hours (David
1982; Lincoln 1982iii; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii), or three
hours (Elman 1999; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii), each week
over a period of up to 1 month (Lincoln 1982iii; Woolf 2015ii;
Woolf 2015iii), 2.5months(Rochon 2005), 4months(ACTNoW
2011; Elman 1999), 5 months (David 1982), or one year (Shewan
1984ii; Shewan 1984iii). Statistical data for communication out-
comeswere available forsixof the includedtrials(ACTNoW 2011;
David 1982; Lincoln 1982iii; Rochon 2005; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf
2015iii). Suitable data allowing inclusion within the meta-analy-
ses were unavailable for the remaining three trials (Elman 1999;
Shewan 1984ii; Shewan1984iii). We reportthe comparisonsmade
(with meta-analysis where possible) below as they relate to mea-
sures of: functional communication, receptive language, expressive
language, severity of impairment, psychosocial impact, number
of dropouts, adherence to allocated intervention, and economic
outcomes.
1. Functional communication
Five trials measured functional communication using the FCP
, the
CADL, the CETI, Therapy Outcome Measures (TOMs), and dis-
course analysis approaches (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982; Elman
1999; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii).
Functional Communication Profile (FCP)
David 1982 used the FCP to compare a group who received con-
ventional SLT with a group that received communication treat-
ment by volunteers. There was no evidence of a difference between
the groups (Analysis 3.1).
Communication Abilities of Daily Living (CADL) and the
Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI)
Elman 1999 used the CADL, the CETI and measures of con-
nected speech to compare the functional communication skills
of participants that received conventional SLT and those that at-
tended social groups and activities instead. The trial did not pro-
vide suitable summary data, so we could not include the results in
the meta-analysis.
Therapy Outcome Measures (TOMs)
ACTNoW 2011 used the TOMs to compare blinded ratings of
video-recorded samples of functional communication skills in par-
ticipants that had received conventional SLT and those that had
received social support and stimulation from a volunteer.
Discourse analyses approaches
Two trials used discourse analysis approaches to examine the use
of substantive turns, content words per turn and the number of
nouns per turn used by participants in a conversational interaction
(Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). The groups had received either
SLT or an Internet-based conference conversational intervention.
The measure of content words per turn was pooled with the other
data in Analysis 3.1, and there was no evidence of a significant
difference between the groups that had received SLT and those
that had received informal social support. Pooling using the other
discourse measures made no difference to this finding.
2. Receptive language
Four of the nine trials that compared participants that received
SLT or a social support and stimulation intervention did so by
comparing the groups’ receptive language skills (Lincoln 1982iii;
Rochon 2005; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii). Measures used
included the Philadelphia Comprehension Battery (PCB), the Au-
ditory Comprehension Test for Sentences (ACTS), the Token Test
and the PICA gestural subtest.
Philadelphia Comprehension Battery (PCB)
Rochon 2005 measured participants’ receptive language skills on
the PCB, which includes subtests for sentence comprehension and
picture comprehension. There was no evidence of a difference be-
tween the receptive language skills of the participants that received
sentence-mapping SLT and those that received unstructured social
support and stimulation (Analysis 3.2).
Auditory Comprehension Test for Sentences (ACTS)
Two additional trials measured receptive language skills by mea-
suring auditory comprehension of sentences in participants that
received either language-oriented therapy or conventional SLT
versus an intervention that provided unstructured social support
(Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii). Both trials used the ACTS to
make this comparison, but the manner in which they reported
data prevented inclusion within the meta-analysis.
Token Test
Lincoln 1982iii measured participants’ receptive language skills
using the Token Test. There was no evidence of a difference be-
tween the groups (Analysis 3.2).
Receptive language: other comprehension
Lincoln 1982iii assessed participants’ auditory and written com-
prehension skills using the PICA gestural subtest; those that had
access to social support and stimulation performed significantly
better on these measures than those that had access to SLT (P =
0.04, MD −0.87, 95% CI −1.70 to −0.04) (Analysis 3.3).
3. Expressive language
Five of the nine trials that compared participants that received SLT
or a social support and stimulation intervention did so by compar-
ing the groups’ expressive language skills (Elman 1999; Lincoln
1982iii; Rochon 2005; Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). Measures
28
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)

 usedincludedthe ObjectNamingTest(ONT), CaplanandHanna
Sentence Production Test (CHSPT), the Picture Description with
Structured Modeling (PDSM), the PICA and the Spoken Picture
Naming Test.
Expressive language: single words
Lincoln 1982iii measured participants’ naming skills on the ONT,
while Woolf 2015ii and Woolf 2015iii used the Spoken Picture
Naming test. On pooling the data, there was no evidence of a dif-
ference between the groups that received social support and stim-
ulation and those that had received SLT, but there was significant
heterogeneity (P = 0.0002; I2 = 84%) (Analysis 3.4).
Expressive language: sentences
Rochon 2005 compared the participants who receivedsentence-
mapping SLT and a group receiving unstructured social support
and stimulation. Comparison of the two groups showed no ev-
idence of a difference between the groups’ performance on the
CHSPT scores. Those that had received SLT did perform signifi-
cantly better on treated items from the test (P = 0.01, MD 3.00,
95% CI 0.63 to 5.37) than the participants who received social
support, but there was no evidence of a difference between the
groups on the untreated items (Analysis 3.5).
Expressive language: picture description
Two trials elicited samples of participants’ connected speech using
picture description tasks (Lincoln 1982iii; Rochon 2005). There
was no evidence of a difference between the two groups. Rochon
2005 also reported the two groups’ scores on the treated and un-
treated items, but there was no evidence of a between-group dif-
ference on the treated or untreated items (Analysis 3.6).
Expressive language: general
Lincoln 1982iii and Elman 1999 compared the groups’ perfor-
mances on the PICA verbal subtest. Suitable statistical data were
unavailable from Elman 1999, so we could not include the results
in the meta-analysis. Participants who had received social support
and stimulation scored significantly better than those who received
SLT (P = 0.0007, MD −1.56, 95% CI −2.46 to −0.66) (Analysis
3.7).
Expressive language: written
Similarly, Lincoln 1982iii compared the groups’ performances on
the PICA graphic subtests and found participants that received
social support performed significantly better than those that had
received SLT (P = 0.01, MD −1.39, 95% CI −2.49 to −0.29)
(Analysis 3.8).
Expressive language: word fluency
Participants that received social support performed significantly
better on measures of word fluency than those that had received
SLT (Lincoln 1982iii; Analysis 3.9)
4. Severity of impairment
Elman 1999, Lincoln 1982iii, Shewan 1984ii and Shewan 1984iii
compared groups that had access to SLT and those that received
social support and stimulation by measuring participants’ aphasia
severity. The assessments used included the PICA and the Western
Aphasia Battery-Aphasia Quotient (WABAQ).
PICA
Two trials used the Shortened PICA to compare participants who
had received group SLT and those who had attended other social
activities or groups that provided social support and stimulation
(Elman 1999; Lincoln 1982iii). Suitable statistical data were un-
available from Elman 1999, so we could not include them in the
meta-analysis. Lincoln 1982iii found that participants provided
with social support and stimulation were less impaired as a result
of aphasia (as measured on the PICA) than those who received
SLT (P = 0.005, MD −1.13, 95% CI −1.91 to −0.35). Suitable
summary data were not available from Elman 1999 to allow in-
clusion within the meta-analysis (Analysis 3.10).
WAB
Two additional trials assessed the severity of participants’ aphasia
using the WAB, comparing participants who received language-
oriented SLT or conventional SLT versus psychological support
and unstructured communication provided by trained nurses (
Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii). Suitable summary data were
unavailable, so we could not include them in the meta-analysis.
5. Psychosocial impact
ACTNoW 2011 and Elman 1999 evaluated psychosocial impact
in participants who had received SLT versus social support and
stimulation using the ABS and the Communication Outcomes
After STroke (COAST) scale from both the patients’ and care-
givers’ perspectives.
Affect Balance Scale
Elman 1999 compared participants that had received SLT and
those that had received social support using the ABS, but appro-
priate summary values were unavailable, so we could not include
them in the meta-analysis.
COAST
Participants and caregivers completed separate versions of the
COAST scale to indicate the impact of the participant’s aphasia
on their functional communication and quality of life (ACTNoW
2011). Measures were then used to compare the participants that
had received SLT and those that had received social support. There
was no evidence of a difference between the groups on this mea-
sure as reported by the participants or by the caregivers (Analysis
3.11).

 6. Number of dropouts
Six of the nine trials in this section reported dropouts from the
original randomised participants (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982;
Elman 1999; Lincoln 1982iii; Shewan 1984ii; Shewan 1984iii).
The main Lincoln 1982 trial (from which the randomised com-
parison Lincoln 1982iii has been extracted) excluded 13 partic-
ipants for failing to complete the full treatment intervention. It
is unclear which intervention arms these participants were ran-
domised to, so we could not include these dropouts in meta-anal-
ysis. The remaining trials lost a total of 40 participants from the
groups allocated to SLT while 65 were lost to the social support
and stimulation interventions. Fewer participants allocated to SLT
were lost to the trial than those that were allocated to social sup-
port and stimulation (P = 0.005, OR 0.51 95% CI 0.32 to 0.81)
(Analysis 3.12).
7. Adherence to allocated intervention
Five trials with dropouts also described the reasons for the drop-
outs to allow identification of those who had voluntarily with-
drawn from the allocated intervention. A total of 11 participants
in the SLT groups and 45 participants in the social support and
stimulation intervention groups did not adhere to the allocated in-
tervention (ACTNoW 2011; David 1982; Elman 1999; Shewan
1984ii; Shewan 1984iii) (P < 0.00001, OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09
to 0.37; Analysis 3.13). In addition, David 1982 also described
the withdrawal of four more participants from the social support
group because of ’volunteer problems’ (details can be found in
Table 2).
8. Economic outcomes
Only one of the nine trials measured economic outcomes (
ACTNoW 2011). The cost favoured the provision of SLT (P <
0.00001,MD−3035.00,95%CI−4342.44to −1727.56), while
the utility data favoured the social support intervention (P = 0.02,
MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; Analysis 3.14).
9. Follow-up data
Three trials comparing SLT versus social support and stimulation
also gathered follow-up data: at six weeks in Woolf 2015ii and
Woolf 2015iii) and at three and six months in David 1982. Of
these trials, we present data relating to functional communication
and expressive language below.
1. Functional communication
David 1982 used the FCP to compare a group who received con-
ventional SLT with a group that received communication treat-
ment by volunteers. There was no evidence of a difference be-
tween the groups at three and six months’ follow-up. Similarly,
Woolf 2015ii and Woolf 2015iii measured functional communi-
cation using discourse measures and found no evidence of a dif-
ference between the groups six weeks after the intervention based
on measures of substantive turns, content words, or nouns per
turn during an unstructured conversation. On pooling FCP data
at three months from David 1982 with data on content words per
turn in Woolf 2015ii and Woolf 2015iii, there was no evidence
of a difference between the groups. This did not change when we
substituted other discourse data described above in the analysis
(Woolf 2015ii; Woolf 2015iii; see Analysis 5.1).
2. Expressive language
Six weeks after the intervention, two trials measured participants’
naming abilities using the Spoken Picture Naming Test (Woolf
2015ii; Woolf 2015iii). Pooling this data, the individuals that re-
ceived SLT were able to name more words than those that re-
ceived social support (P = 0.03; SMD 2.25, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.32;
Analysis 5.2).
Comparisons: SLT A versus SLT B
A total of 1242 participants were included in 38 randomised com-
parisons of one SLT intervention (SLT A) with another SLT in-
tervention (SLT B) (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Bakheit 2007; Crerar 1996;
Crosson 2014; Denes 1996; Di Carlo 1980; Drummond 1981;
FUATAC; Hinckley 2001; Leal 1993; Lincoln 1982i; Lincoln
1982ii; Lincoln 1984b; Meikle 1979; Meinzer 2007; MIT 2014i;

Steenbrugge 1981; VERSEI; VERSEII ; Yao 2005iii; Wertz1981;
Wertz 1986iii; Wilssens 2015; Woolf 2015i). As within other sec-
tions of this review, descriptions of the participants’ age and other
characteristics across trials varied (Table 1).
Participants’ age ranges, spanning 17 to 92 years, were available
for 15 trials, while 22 trials reported mean ages (B.A.Bar 2011ii
; Crosson 2014; Denes 1996; Drummond 1981; Hinckley 2001;
Leal 1993; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii ; NARNIA 2013; RATS;
RATS-2; SEMaFORE; Smith 1981iii; Sickert 2014; SP-I-RiT;
Varley 2016i; Varley 2016ii; VERSE I; VERSE II; Wertz 1986iii;
Wilssens 2015; Woolf 2015i), and one reported the number of
participants within age bands (Yao 2005iii) (Table 1).
All but four trials reported the length of time since their
participants had experienced the onset of aphasia (FUATAC;
SEMaFORE; Smith 1981iii; Yao 2005iii). Mean time since on-
set varied from less than a week after stroke (VERSE I; VERSE
II), to within the first month (Bakheit 2007; Leal 1993; Shewan
1984i; Wertz 1981), two months (Sickert 2014; SP-I-RiT), three
months (MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii), or even up to one year or more
after stroke (B.A.Bar 2011ii ; Crosson 2014; Drummond 1981;
Hinckley 2001; Meinzer 2007; NARNIA 2013; ORLA 2006;
ORLA 2010; Pulvermuller 2001; Prins 1989; Van Steenbrugge
1981; Varley 2016i; Varley 2016ii; Wilssens 2015; Woolf 2015i)
30

 (Table 1). Similarly, almost all trials reported the severity of apha-
sia, with only four failing to report how severe participants’ aphasia
was (Drummond 1981; FUATAC; SEMaFORE; Yao 2005iii). In
most cases, trials reported the range of participants’ aphasia sever-
ity using a suitable assessment tool, but in some cases this aspect
was reported in more general terms (Table 1). Some trials focused
specifically on participants with moderate (Wilssens 2015), severe
(Denes 1996; Di Carlo 1980; Lincoln 1984b), or moderate to se-
vere presentations of aphasia (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Lincoln 1982i; Leal
1993).
Trials in this section compared one SLT approach to an alternative
approach to SLT intervention, where the interventions differed in
relation to the therapy regimen (intensity, dose, duration), deliv-
ery model (one-to-one or group therapy, volunteer or computer
facilitated therapy), or theoretical underpinnings of the therapy
delivered.
High-intensity versus low-intensity SLT
As prespecified, we looked at the data from eight trials which
compared a high-intensity SLT intervention with a low-intensity
SLT intervention (Bakheit 2007; Denes 1996; FUATAC; ORLA
2006; Pulvermuller 2001; Smith 1981iii; SP-I-RiT; VERSE I).
For participants in the high-intensity groups, the number of hours
weekly ranged from 4 hours (Smith 1981iii), 5 hours (Bakheit
2007; Denes 1996), 7.5 hours (VERSE I), 10 hours (ORLA
2006; Pulvermuller 2001; SP-I-RiT), or 15 hours (FUATAC).
In contrast the low-intensity SLT groups received 1.5 hours
(Smith 1981iii; VERSE I), 2 hours (Bakheit 2007; SP-I-RiT),
3 hours (Denes 1996), 4 hours (FUATAC ; ORLA 2006),
or 5 hours (Pulvermuller 2001) weekly. The participants’ time
since stroke ranged from recruitment at an average of three
days after stroke (VERSE I), approximately a month (Bakheit
2007), two months (Denes 1996, SP-I-RiT), up to three months
(FUATAC, unreported but estimated in Smith 1981iii), and two
years (Pulvermuller 2001 low intensity group), three to four years
(ORLA 2006), and eight years (Pulvermuller 2001 high-intensity
SLT group).
Statistical data for communication outcomes were only avail-
able for six trials (Bakheit 2007; Denes 1996; ORLA 2006;
Pulvermuller 2001; SP-I-RiT; VERSE I), and we made compar-
isons by measuring participants’ functional communication, re-
ceptive language, expressive language, severity of impairment, psy-
chosocial impact, number of dropouts, and adherence to allocated
intervention. The trials did not report on economic outcome mea-
sures.
1. Functional communication
VERSE I and SP-I-RiT compared high versus low intensity in-
terventions (both within a couple of months after stroke onset),
measuring participants’ functional communication using the FCP
.
VERSE I also used Discourse Analysis (DA) scores (informative-
ness and efficiency (Nicholas 1995)). On pooling the FCP data,
the groups that received high-intensity SLT had better functional
communication than those that received low intensity SLT (P =
0.003; MD 11.75 95% CI 4.09 to 19.40; Analysis 4.1). When
the VERSE I DA data were pooled with the SP-I-RiT FCP data,
there was a similar finding (P = 0.002, SMD 0.69 95% CI 0.25
to 1.13).
2. Receptive language
Auditory comprehension
Measures of participants’ receptive language skills were available
for Denes 1996, SP-I-RiT and Pulvermuller 2001. These trials
measured participants’ auditory comprehension using the Token
Test, the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT) and Lisbon Aphasia As-
sessment Batter comprehension subtests. On pooling the final
value scores reported by Pulvermuller 2001 and SP-I-RiT from
the Token Test, we observed significant heterogeneity (P = 0.03; I
2 = 79%) that could represent substantial heterogeneity (Higgins
2011). However, there was no indication of a significant difference
between comprehension skills in participants that had received
high-intensity SLT versus those that had received low-intensity
SLT (Analysis 4.2). Denes 1996 only reported change-from-base-
line scores, and thus they are not presented here.
Reading
SP-I-RiT measured participants’ reading abilities using the Por-
tuguese version of the AAT and found no evidence of a difference
between participants that received high-intensity SLT and those
that received low-intensity SLT (Analysis 4.3).
3. Expressive language
Three trials compared the expressive language skills of participants
that received a high-intensity SLT with those that received a low-
intensitySLTinterventiononnaming, repetition, and writing tests
(Denes 1996; Pulvermuller 2001; SP-I-RiT). Denes 1996 mea-
sured expressive language skills using the AAT nNaming, repeti-
tion and written subtests, but only the groups’ change-from-base-
line scores were available, so we do not present them here.
Expressive language: naming
Pulvermuller 2001 and SP-I-RiT measured participants’ naming
skills using the AAT naming subtest and the Lisbon Aphasia As-
sessment Battery. There was no indication of a difference between
the groups (Analysis 4.4).
Expressive language: written
Trialists compared the writing skills of participants that had re-
ceived high- and low-intensity SLT using the AAT (Denes 1996;
31
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)

 SP-I-RiT). Only change-from-baseline data were available from
Denes 1996, so we do not present them here (Analysis 4.5).
Expressive language: repetition
On pooling data from the repetition subtests of the AAT and
the Lisbon Aphasia Assessment Battery (Pulvermuller 2001; SP-
I-RiT), there was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(Analysis 4.6).
Expressive language: repetition
SP-I-RiT also captured the participants’ fluency and found no
evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 4.7).
4. Severity of impairment
Seven trials compared participants’ overall level of aphasia severity
following interventions that varied in intensity by using the WAB
(Bakheit 2007; ORLA 2006; VERSE I), the AAT (Pulvermuller
2001), the BDAE (SP-I-RiT), the Lisbon Aphasia Assessment Bat-
tery (SP-I-RiT), and the MTDDA (Smith 1981iii). Suitable sta-
tistical data allowing inclusion in the meta-analysis were unavail-
able from Smith 1981iii, and only change-from-baseline scores
were available for the AAT, preventing inclusion in the meta-anal-
ysis. On pooling the available final scores summary data (using
the BDAE data from the SP-I-RiT trial), the groups that received
high-intensity SLT performed significantly better on measures of
aphasia severity than those that received a low-intensity SLT inter-
vention (P = 0.02, SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.69; Analysis 4.8).
We did observe some non-significant heterogeneity (P = 0.37; I2
= 7%). We obtained a similar result when pooling the data for the
Lisbon Aphasia Assessment Battery (SP-I-RiT) (P = 0.02; SMD
0.40 95% CI 0.07 to 0.74).
Following Cochrane editorial review comments, we conducted a
post hoc subgroup analysis that considered the trials’ recruitment
time point since aphasia onset. Data from trials delivering inter-
ventions to participants up to three months poststroke (a clini-
cally relevant timeframe) continued to demonstrate benefit from
intensive intervention (N = 157; P = 0.03; SMD 0.47 95% CI
0.05 to 0.88) in the presence of some non-significant heterogene-
ity (P = 0.21; I2 = 36%; Bakheit 2007; SP-I-RiT; VERSE I). Con-
versely, when we conducted the post hoc analyses on data from the
subgroup of trials recruiting participants several years after stroke
(ORLA 2006; Pulvermuller 2001), there was no longer evidence
of a difference between the small numbers of participants that re-
ceived high-intensity SLT (N = 16) versus low-intensity SLT (N
= 14). We will revisit this issue within the Discussion.
5. Mood
Smith 1981iii used the GHQ while SP-I-RiT used the Stroke
Aphasia Depression Questionnaire to compare groups receiving
high-intensity and low-intensity SLT. Appropriate summary data
from Smith 1981iii were unavailable. Presenting data from SP-I-
RiT, there wasnoevidence of adifference betweenthe participants’
experience of depression (Analysis 4.9).
6. Number of dropouts
Data on participants that dropped out of trials included in this
comparison were available for Bakheit 2007, Denes 1996, ORLA
2006, Pulvermuller 2001, SP-I-RiT and VERSE I and were par-
tially available for Smith 1981iii. Smith 1981iii excluded five ad-
ditional participants from the final analysis (three were found not
to have aphasia and two died), but their group allocation was un-
clear. These five individuals were not included in this meta-anal-
ysis. It was unclear whether any were lost in FUATAC. No par-
ticipants appear to have been lost from the treatment or follow-
up time points in the Denes 1996, ORLA 2006, or Pulvermuller
2001 studies. Both ORLA 2006 and Pulvermuller 2001 recruited
between an average of two and eight years after stroke.
Across the trials, significantly more participants (N = 35) were
lost to the high-intensity SLT intervention groups compared with
those lost to low-intensity SLT interventions (N = 17) (P = 0.01,
OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.60) (Analysis 4.10).
7. Adherence to allocated intervention
Bakheit 2007 (in part), SP-I-RiT, and VERSE I reported the rea-
sons for loss of participants from within the study. Of these, seven
voluntarily withdrew from the high-intensity SLT group during
the treatment phase, while one withdrew from the low-intensity
group. There was no significant difference between the groups on
this measure.
8. Follow-up data (high-intensity versus low-intensity SLT)
Three trials comparing participants who received high-intensity
SLT versus low intensity SLT included a follow-up data collection
point after the intervention period in relation to: functional com-
munication, receptive language, expressive language, severity of
impairment, and number of dropouts (Bakheit 2007; SP-I-RiT;
VERSE I).
Functional communication
We collected follow-up data on functional communication as mea-
sured by the FCP in SP-I-RiT and VERSE I by discourse analy-
sis in VERSE I at 40 weeks (SP-I-RiT), six months (VERSE I),
and 12 months postintervention (SP-I-RiT) (Analysis 6.1). On
pooling the FCP data, participants who had received high-inten-
sity SLT continued to perform significantly better on measures
of functional communication than those who had received low-
intensity SLT (P = 0.02; SMD 0.53; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.99). Other
measures did not demonstrate a significant difference between the
groups.
Receptive language
32
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The SP-I-RiT trial captured auditory comprehension (LAAB and
the Token Test) and reading comprehension (AAT subtest) at 40
weeks and 12 months postintervention. There was evidence of sig-
nificantly better performance on measures of auditory comprehen-
sion by participants that had received the high-intensity SLT com-
pared with those that had received the low-intensity SLT. These
and other data are presented in Analysis 6.2.
Expressive language
Similarly, data on participants’ expressive language skills were col-
lected in the SP-I-RiT trial relating to their naming, writing to dic-
tation, repetition, and fluency at 40 weeks and 12 months. There
was evidence of a difference between participants’ performance
(Analysis 6.3).
Severity of impairment
Three trials followed up participants at three months (Bakheit
2007), six months (VERSE I), and 40 weeks and 12 months (SP-I-
RiT) to compare participants who had received high-intensity SLT
versus low-intensity SLT on measures of aphasia severity including
the WABAQ (Bakheit 2007; VERSE I), the BDAE (SP-I-RiT),
and the LAAB-AQ (SP-I-RiT). On pooling the data (using the
BDAE SP-I-RiT data only), there was no evidence of a difference
between the groups (P = 0.07; SMD 0.37 95% CI −0.03 to 0.77)
(Analysis 6.4).
Mood
SP-I-RiT used the Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire to
compare those that received high- and low-intensity SLT. There
was no evidence of a difference between the groups at 40 weeks or
12 months follow-up (Analysis 6.5).
Number of dropouts
Three trials reported the number of participants lost to follow-
up (Bakheit 2007; Smith 1981iii; SP-I-RiT; VERSE I) from the
high-intensity groups (N = 15) and the low-intensity groups (N
= 10). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(Analysis 6.6)
High versus low dose SLT
As planned, we considered six trials that compared a high dose with
a low dose SLT intervention as measured in hours of therapy provi-
sion. The number of therapy hours in the high dose SLT interven-
tion varied from a total of 27 hours (VERSE I), 60 hours (Bakheit
2007; ORLA 2006), 90 hours (FUATAC), 97 to 129 hours (Denes
1996), and up to 208 hours (ORLA 2006). Participants receiving
a low dose SLT intervention received 5 hours (VERSE I), 23 hours
(FUATAC; Smith1981iii), 24hours(Bakheit 2007; ORLA 2006),
69 hours (Smith 1981iii), or 78 hours (Denes 1996). These high
andlowdose SLTgroupswere comparedonmeasuresof functional
communication, receptive language, expressive language, severity
of impairment, number of dropouts, and adherence to allocated
intervention.
1. Functional communication
VERSE I measured participants’ functional communication using
the FCP and Discourse Analysis (DA) scores (informativeness and
efficiency; Nicholas 1995). The participants that had received a
high dose of SLT (up to 27 hours) had significantly better func-
tional communication scores on both measures than those that
received low dose (five hours) SLT (Analysis 7.1).
2. Receptive language
Denes 1996 measured and compared participants’ receptive lan-
guage on the AAT Comprehension subtest and the Token Test.
Only change-from-baseline data were available, which we present
here (Analysis 7.2). There was no evidence of a difference between
the high and low dose SLT groups.
3. Expressive language
Similarly, Denes 1996 measured participants’ expressive language
on the AAT naming and repetition subtests. Only change-from-
baseline data were available (Analysis 7.3). There was no evidence
of a difference between the high and low dose SLT groups. How-
ever, on measures of written language, the participants that re-
ceived high dose of SLT performed significantly better than those
that received a low dose of SLT (Analysis 7.4).
4. Severity of impairment
Five trials compared participants’ overall level of aphasia severity
following a high and low dose of SLT using the WAB (Bakheit
2007; ORLA 2006; VERSE I), the AAT (Denes 1996), and the
MTDDA (Smith 1981iii). Suitable statistical data allowing inclu-
sion in the meta-analysis were unavailable from Smith 1981iii, and
Denes 1996 only reported change-from-baseline data, which are
not included in this meta-analysis of final value scores. On pooling
the data, there was no evidence of a difference in the participants
that received a high or low dose of SLT on measures of aphasia
severity (Analysis 7.5), although we did observe some non-signif-
icant heterogeneity (P = 0.14; I2 = 49%).
5. Number of dropouts
The numbers of participants that dropped out of trials in this
comparison were available for Bakheit 2007, Denes 1996, ORLA
2006 and VERSE I and were partially available for Smith 1981iii.
No participants appear to have been lost from the treatment or fol-
low-up time points in Denes 1996 or ORLA 2006. It was unclear
whether any were lost from FUATAC. Smith 1981iii excluded five
additional participants (not included in this meta-analysis) from
the final analysis (three were found not to have aphasia and two
died), but their group allocation was unclear. On pooling the data,
33

 significantly more participants (N = 99) were lost to the high dose
SLT intervention groups versus the low dose SLT interventions
(N = 87) (P = 0.03; OR 2.01 95% CI 1.07 to 3.79). There was
no indication of heterogeneity. Of these participants, some were
lost at follow-up (eight from high dose and five from the low dose
SLT groups) (Bakheit 2007; VERSE I; Analysis 7.6).
6. Adherence to allocated intervention
Two of the five trials reporting dropouts described the reasons
for loss of participants from within the study. Six participants
voluntarily withdrew from the high dose SLT groups during the
treatment phase, while one withdrew from the low dose group.
There was no evidence of a significant difference between the
groups (Analysis 7.7).
7. Follow-up data (high dose versus low dose SLT)
Both Bakheit 2007 and VERSE I compared participants who re-
ceived a high dose of SLT with those who received a low dose of
SLT at follow-up data collection points in relation to functional
communication, severity of impairment, and number of dropouts.
Functional communication
VERSE I compared participants’ functional language skills using
the FCP and Discourse Analysis methods but found no evidence of
a significant difference between the groups at follow-up (Analysis
8.1).
Severity of impairment
Similarly, using the WAB as a measure of aphasia severity, there
was no evidence of a difference between the groups at follow-up
when pooling data from Bakheit 2007 and VERSE I (Analysis
8.2).
Number of dropouts
On pooling the follow-up data across the three trials that reported
dropouts (Bakheit 2007; Smith 1981iii; VERSE I), there was no
evidence of a difference between the groups that received a high
dose of SLT and those that received a low dose (Analysis 8.3).
Early versus delayed SLT
Four trials delivered an early SLT intervention and delayed the SLT
intervention for the other group (B.A.Bar 2011ii; MIT 2014ii,
Lyon 1997; Varley 2016ii). While Lyon 1997 incorporated a de-
layed intervention, we could not include the data in this compar-
ison; the data collection point was prior to the delayed interven-
tion, and thus the trial data contributes to the SLT versus no SLT
comparison. The remaining trials compared groups on measures
of functional communication, receptive language, expressive lan-
guage, severity of impairment, number of dropouts, and adher-
ence to allocated intervention.
1. Functional communication
Both B.A.Bar 2011ii and MIT 2014i measured participants’ func-
tional communication using the ANELT. The data for MIT 2014i,
however, were unavailable at the time of updating this review and
could not be included here. Data from B.A.Bar 2011ii demon-
strate no evidence of a difference between the group that received
early SLT versus SLT later after aphasia onset. Findings were simi-
lar on follow-up of the participants four weeks later (Analysis 9.1).
2. Receptive language
B.A.Bar 2011ii compared participants’ auditory comprehension
skills using the Token Test but found no evidence of a difference
between the groups that received early SLT versus delayed SLT
(Analysis 9.2).
3. Expressive language
Similarly, participants’ expressive language skills were captured us-
ing measures of naming (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Varley 2016ii), writing
(B.A.Bar 2011ii), repetition (B.A.Bar 2011ii; Varley 2016ii) and
word fluency (food and animal words) (B.A.Bar 2011ii). Inves-
tigators measured outcomes immediately after the intervention
and one month later in B.A.Bar 2011ii or two months later in
Varley 2016ii. There was no evidence of a difference between the
groups on any of these measures or at these time points. We only
present the naming (matched) and repetition (matched) data in
these meta-analyses (Analysis 9.3 to Analysis 9.6). Pooling using
the treated or control items from Varley 2016ii data did not alter
this finding. We do not present these data here.
4. Severity of impairment
The participants’ performance on the AAT overall demonstrated
no evidence of a difference between the severity of their aphasia
(Analysis 9.7).
5. Number of dropouts
MIT 2014i and Varley 2016ii reported dropouts, with six partici-
pants leaving the early SLT group and two leaving the delayed SLT
group. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(Analysis 9.8). B.A.Bar 2011ii did not report any dropouts.
6. Follow-up data (8 weeks)
Varley 2016ii followed up participants eight weeks after the de-
layed treatment and measured expressive language (naming and
repetition) across treated, matched and control items. There was
no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 10.1;
Analysis 10.2). Similarly there was no evidence of a difference in
the number of participants dropping out form the early SLT in-
tervention versus the delayed SLT group (Analysis 10.3).

 SLT: short versus long duration
Five trials compared therapy of a long and short duration as mea-
sured by the weeks or months over which the SLT intervention
was delivered. Examples of short SLT interventions lasted 2 weeks
(Pulvermuller 2001), 10 weeks (SP-I-RiT), or they had a mean
duration of 11.4 weeks (ORLA 2010), 20.8 weeks (Meikle 1979),
or they lasted between 6 and 9 months (Di Carlo 1980). These
were compared with therapy delivered over a longer period of
time, ranging from 3 to 5 weeks (Pulvermuller 2001), a mean of
13.31 weeks (ORLA 2010), 37.13 weeks (Meikle 1979), 50 weeks
(SP-I-RiT), or between 5 and 22 months (Di Carlo 1980). Groups
were compared on measures of functional communication, recep-
tive language, expressive language, mood, severity of impairment,
and number of dropouts and adherence to allocated intervention
(Analysis 11.1 to Analysis 11.16).
1. Functional communication
Two trials compared participants’ functional communication us-
ing measures of discourse or the Functional Communication Pro-
file (ORLA 2010; SP-I-RiT). Pooling the data demonstrated that
those individualsthathadreceivedSLToveralongerperiodof time
performed significantly better on measures of functional commu-
nication than those who had received therapy over a short period
of time (P = 0.002, SMD 0.81, CI 95% 0.23 to 1.40; (Analysis
11.1). This finding was no longer evident at 50 weeks and one
year follow-up during the SP-I-RiT trial (Analysis 11.2).
2. Receptive language
Two trials measured participants’ auditory comprehension (
Pulvermuller2001; SP-I-RiT), and three assessed written language
comprehension (Di Carlo 1980; ORLA 2010; SP-I-RiT). Trials
evaluating auditory comprehension used the AAT comprehension
subtest (Pulvermuller 2001), the Token Test (Pulvermuller 2001),
and the Lisbon Aphasia Assessment Battery (SP-I-RiT). On pool-
ing the AAT data with the LAAB data, there was a significant
difference between the groups: participants who received therapy
over a long period of time scored significantly higher on auditory
comprehension tests than those who received SLT over a short
period of time (P = 0.01, SMD 0.81, CI 95% 0.17 to 1.45 and
low heterogeneity: I2 = 0%). However, on pooling the Token Test
data with the LAAB data, we observed significant heterogeneity
(I2 = 69%) and no evidence of a difference between the groups’
auditory comprehension (SMD 0.49 CI 95% −0.67 to 1.65). We
present the AAT data in Analysis 11.3. There was no evidence
of this extending to follow-up data collected at 50 or 62 weeks
(Analysis 11.4; Analysis 11.5).
After pooling data from across three trials, participants’ ability to
read did not differ between groups (ORLA 2010, SP-I-RiT, Di
Carlo 1980; Analysis 11.6).
3. Expressive language
Three trials found no evidence of a difference between the
groups’ naming abilities when using the AAT naming subtest
(Pulvermuller 2001), the Lisbon Aphasia Assessment Battery
(SP-I-RiT), or the Thorndike Lorge Word List by Thorndike
1944 (Di Carlo 1980) (Analysis 11.7). Similarly, there was no evi-
dence of a difference between groups in writing abilities (Analysis
11.8) or repetition (Analysis 11.9). One small trial found that the
group that received an SLT intervention for a longer period per-
formedsignificantlybetteronmeasuresof wordfluency(SP-I-RiT;
Analysis 11.10). Based on data from the same trial, there was no
evidence of a difference between the groups at 50 or 62 weeks’
follow-up (Analysis 11.11).
4. Mood
SP-I-RiT also compared participants using the Stroke Aphasia De-
pression Questoinnaire following SLT of a long or short duration
immediately after treatment and at 50 and 62 weeks’ follow-up.
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
11.12).
5. Severity of impairment
Four trials measured aphasia severity and compared participants
who had received SLT over a long and short period of time. After
pooling data from the WABAQ (ORLA 2010), the PICA (Meikle
1979), the AAT (Pulvermuller 2001), and the BDAE (SP-I-RiT),
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
11.13). SP-I-RiT also gathered data on severity using the LIsbon
Aphasia Assessment Battery Aphasia Quotient, but pooling this
data instead of the BDAE did not alter the finding. At follow-up,
there was little indication of a difference between the groups - no
differences were observed on measures using the LAAB, while at
one year the group that received a long period of SLT performed
significantly better on the BDAE than those who had received SLT
over a short period of time (Analysis 11.14).
6. Number of dropouts and adherence to allocated
intervention
Only Meikle 1979 reported any dropouts in this comparison, and
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
11.15) or in relation to adherence to the allocated intervention
(Analysis 11.16).
Group versus one-to-one SLT
Six trials compared a group-based SLT intervention with con-
ventional one-to-one SLT (FUATAC; Pulvermuller 2001; VERSE
II; Wertz 1981; Wilssens 2015; Yao 2005iii). Within the group
SLT interventions, participants received SLT in groups of 2 to 3
(FUATAC), 3 (Pulvermuller2001), 2 to 4 (VERSEII), 5 (Wilssens
2015), between 3 to 7 (Wertz 1981), and 10 (Yao 2005iii). Several
group SLT interventions used a constraint-induced aphasia ther-
apy approach (FUATAC; Pulvermuller 2001; VERSE II; Wilssens
2015) (only verbal responses were allowed). In contrast, other
35

 group interventions encouraged group discussion and recreational
activities with a therapist (Wertz 1981), or they focused on ’col-
lective language strengthening training’ (Yao 2005iii).
Participants receiving the one-to-one SLT intervention received a
semantic therapy in Visch-Brink 2001 and Wilssens 2015 or con-
ventional SLT in FUATAC, Pulvermuller 2001, VERSE II, Wertz
1981 and Yao 2005iii. Investigators made between-intervention
comparisons on a variety of measures: functional communication,
receptive language, expressive language, quality of life, severity of
impairment, number of dropouts, and adherence to allocated in-
tervention. Studies did not measure psychosocial impact or eco-
nomic measures.
1. Functional communication
Two trials measured change in functional communication using
the CAL (Pulvermuller 2001), the Conversational Rating Scale
(CRS) (Wertz 1981), and the Informants Rating of Functional
Language (adapted form of the FCP) (Wertz 1981). However,
suitable statistical data were unavailable from these measures, and
so we could not include them within the review. A later study took
a subset of data from the Wertz 1981 trial and evaluated func-
tional communication using the Pragmatic Protocol. In addition,
we pooled data from Wilssens 2015 based on the ANELT with
data from VERSE II on the percentage of content information
units per minute in a sample of discourse. There was no evidence
of a difference between the groups’ performance on measures of
functional communication (Analysis 12.1).
2. Receptive language
Receptive language: auditory comprehension
Three trials measured participants’ receptive language skills using
the Token Test (Pulvermuller 2001; Wertz 1981; Wilssens 2015),
and two used the language comprehension subtest of the AAT
(Pulvermuller 2001; Wilssens 2015). Wertz 1981 reported mean
values, but the SD values were unavailable. To facilitate inclusion
of these data within the review, we imputed the SD value (13.93)
from the Lincoln 1982 Token Test summary data. The reason for
choosing this value was that both Wertz 1981 and Lincoln 1982
used the same form of the Token Test and used it to measure
the language skills of similar participant groups. On pooling these
data, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups’
auditory comprehension skills as measured by either comprehen-
sion subtest (Pulvermuller 2001; see Analysis 12.2).
Receptive language: other
Wertz 1981 used the PICA Gestural subtest to compare partic-
ipants that had received group SLT and those that had received
one-to-one SLT. Though the mean values were available to the re-
view, the SD values were unavailable. We identified and imputed
an SD value of 25.67 from Wertz 1986, where the highest of three
possible values in this trial from relevant clinical groups was chosen
to facilitate inclusion of the study within the review. There was no
evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 12.3).
3. Expressive language
Expressive language: spoken
Participants’ expressive language skills were compared using the
naming subtest of the AAT (Pulvermuller 2001; Wilssens 2015),
the Boston Naming Test (Wilssens 2015), measures of word flu-
ency, repetition, and the PICA verbal subtest. On pooling the
AAT naming data, there was no evidence of a difference between
the groups’ expressive language skills (Analysis 12.4). This did not
change when using the BNT data from Wilssens 2015) in the
meta-analysis in place of the AAT subtest data from the same trial
(P = 0.58; SMD 0.22 95% CI −0.56 to 1.00).
Expressive language: general
Wertz 1981 used the verbal subtest of the PICA to measure partic-
ipants’ language expression. The mean scores of participants who
received group SLT and those that received one-to-one SLT were
available, but SD data were not. We identified and imputed an SD
value (20.01) from Wertz 1986, choosing the highest of three pos-
sible values in this trial from relevant clinical groups to facilitate
inclusion of the study within the review. There was no evidence
of a difference between the groups (Analysis 12.5).
Expressive language: word fluency
Wertz 1981 used measures of word fluency to compare partici-
pants’ word-finding skills. Authors reported mean values for the
participants receiving group SLT and those receiving one-to-one
SLT, but not the SDs, so we could not include these results in the
review.
Expressive language: repetition
Both Pulvermuller 2001 and Wilssens 2015 measured partici-
pants’ repetition abilities using the AAT repetition subtest. They
found no evidence of a difference between the participants who
had received group SLT and those that received one-to-one SLT
(Analysis 12.6).
Expressive language: written
Wertz 1981 captured participants’ written language skills using
the graphic subtest of the PICA, and Wilssens 2015 used the
AAT subtest. Authors reported mean values for participants who
received group SLT and those who received one-to-one SLT, but
SDs were unavailable. As with the other PICA data from Wertz
1981, we identified and imputed an SD value (21.74) from Wertz
36

 1986, choosing the highest of three possible values in this trial
from relevant clinical groups to facilitate inclusion of the study
within the review. There was no evidence of a difference between
participants’ written language skills (Analysis 12.7).
4. Quality of life
Of the trials in this section, only VERSE II measured participants’
quality of life. Using the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life scale
(SAQoL), the authors found no evidence of a difference between
those that received group therapy and those that received one-to-
one SLT (Analysis 12.8).
5. Severity of impairment
Four trials measured the severity of participants’ aphasia following
one-to-one versus group SLT interventions using the CRRCAE
AQ (Yao 2005iii), the PICA (Wertz 1981), the AAT (Pulvermuller
2001), and the WABAQ (VERSE II). Although the mean values
for Wertz 1981 trial were available, the SD data were missing. We
imputed an SD value (24.64) from Wertz 1986 to facilitate inclu-
sion of the data within the review. On pooling the data from all
four trials, there was no evidence of a difference between the scores
of participants that received group SLT and those that received
one-to-one SLT on this measure (Analysis 12.9).
6. Number of dropouts
Information on the number of participants leaving during the
trials were available for most trials (Pulvermuller 2001; VERSE II;
Wertz1981; Wilssens 2015; Yao 2005iii). Numbersof participants
remaining in the trial were unclear for FUATAC. Three trials had
no dropouts (Pulvermuller 2001; Wilssens 2015; Yao 2005iii). In
contrast, almost half of those randomised in Wertz 1981 failed to
remain in the study (33 dropouts); when we pooled these results
with the data from VERSE II, there was no evidence of a difference
in the numbers lost, with 25 leaving the group interventions and
20 leaving the one-to-one interventions (Analysis 12.10).
7. Adherence to allocated intervention
Wertz 1981 reported that 22 participants returned home or de-
clined to travel to receive the allocated treatment intervention (see
Table 2), but further details on the exact number of participants
declining the interventions or how these numbers were split across
intervention groups were unavailable. Similarly, while we know
that three participants dropped out of the VERSE II trial, the rea-
sons are unclear.
8. Follow-up data (group versus one-to-one SLT)
Two trials continued to follow up participants who had received
SLT in group or one-to-one sessions (VERSE II; Yao 2005iii),
measuring functional communication, severity of aphasia, quality
of life, and number of dropouts during the follow-up period.
Functional communication
VERSE II assessed functional communication, measuring the per-
centage of content units per minute in the discourse analysis sam-
ples at 12 weeks’ and 26 weeks’ follow-up. There was no evidence
of a difference between the groups (Analysis 13.1).
Severity of aphasia
VERSE II used the WABAQ to evaluate the severity of partic-
ipants’ aphasia, while Yao 2005iii used the CRRCAE AQ. On
pooling the three-month follow-up data, there was no evidence of
a difference between the groups (VERSE II; Yao 2005iii; and is
presented in Analysis 13.2). Pooling the WABAQ 26-week data
with the CRRCAE AQ data, showed that the participants that had
received group therapy performed significantly better on measures
of aphasia severity than those who had received one-to-one ther-
apy (P = 0.03, SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.58).
Quality of life
Similarly, VERSE II measured quality of life using the SAQoL at
12 and 26 weeks and found no evidence of a difference between
the groups at either time point (Analysis 13.3).
Number of dropouts
Only VERSE II reported the number of dropouts at follow-up
points. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(Analysis 13.4).
Volunteer-facilitated SLT versus professionally facilitated
SLT
Four trials compared participants who received volunteer-facili-
tated SLT versus SLT provided directly by a professional therapist
(Leal 1993; Meikle 1979; Meinzer 2007; Wertz 1986iii). In most
cases a speech and language therapist delivered the professional
SLT (Leal 1993; Meikle 1979; Wertz 1986iii), although a special-
ist psychologist delivered the constraint-induced SLT intervention
in Meinzer 2007. We believed that this trial was suitable for in-
clusion in this comparison, as it compared interventions delivered
by a professional clinician with delivery facilitated by a trained
volunteer.
Most volunteers were family members (Leal 1993; Meinzer 2007;
Wertz 1986iii), although some trialists also engaged friends or
recruited volunteers unknown to the participants (Meikle 1979;
Wertz 1986iii). Volunteer groups across the trials all received SLT
training, information on their patient’s communication impair-
ment, access to working materials or equipment, and ongoing sup-
port or supervision. Most studies indicated that the professional
therapist was accountable for, or informed the design and content
of, the volunteer-facilitated SLT (Meikle 1979; Meinzer 2007;
Wertz 1986iii).
37

 The professional therapists intervened in a formal or clinical set-
ting (Leal 1993; Meikle 1979; Meinzer 2007; Wertz 1986iii). The
duration of the professional SLT interventions varied from three
hours daily for 10 consecutive days in Meinzer 2007, up to three
hours weekly for six months in Leal 1993, four hours weekly for
an average of nine months (SD 22 weeks) in Meikle 1979, or 10
hours weekly for approximately three months in Wertz 1986iii).
The duration of volunteer-facilitated SLT and professionally de-
livered SLT was the same for two trials (Meinzer 2007; Wertz
1986iii). The volunteers in Meikle 1979 visited participants four
times weekly over a shorter period of time (average of five months,
SD 13.5 weeks), while the duration of the volunteer-facilitated
SLT in Leal 1993 is unclear. The four trials used a range of mea-
sures to compare volunteer-facilitated SLT with professional SLT
delivery including functional communication, receptive language,
expressive language, severity of impairment, number of dropouts,
and adherence to allocation.The studies did not compare psy-
chosocial or economic measures.
1. Functional communication
Only Wertz 1986iii formally measured the functional communi-
cation skills of the participants that received volunteer-facilitated
SLT or professional SLT using the CADL and the FCP
. There was
no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 14.1).
2. Receptive language
Receptive language: auditory comprehension
Three trials evaluated participants’ language comprehension abil-
ities using the Token Test (Leal 1993; Meinzer 2007; Wertz
1986iii), but suitable statistical data were unavailable for Leal
1993. Meinzer 2007 and Wertz 1986iii used the Token Test to
measure differences in the auditory comprehension of participants
that received volunteer-facilitated SLT and those that received pro-
fessional therapy input. There was no significant difference be-
tween the two groups’ auditory comprehension (Analysis 14.2).
The comprehension subtest of the AAT measures both auditory
and reading comprehension and was used by Meinzer 2007 to
compare a group receiving volunteer-facilitated SLT or SLT de-
livered by experienced professionals. There was no evidence of a
difference between the groups’ comprehension on these measures
(Analysis 14.2).
Receptive language: reading comprehension
Wertz 1986iii measured participants’ reading comprehension us-
ing the RCBA. There was no evidence of a difference between the
groups. Data from the AAT that Meinzer 2007 used to measure
both auditory and reading comprehension are also presented (but
not pooled) in this section (Analysis 14.3).
Receptive language: other
Wertz 1986iii compared participants’ receptive language skills us-
ing the PICA gestural subtest. There was no evidence of a differ-
ence between the groups (Analysis 14.4).
3. Expressive language
Expressive language: spoken
Meinzer 2007 measured expressive language skills using the nam-
ing subtest of the AAT, while Wertz 1986iii used the PICA verbal
subtest to compare participants that received volunteer-facilitated
SLT and those that received professional SLT. There was no evi-
dence of a difference between the groups (Analysis 14.5).
Expressive language: repetition
The group that received the volunteer-facilitated SLT interven-
tion in Meinzer 2007 scored significantly higher on the repetition
subtest (AAT) than those that received SLT from a professional
therapist (P = 0.05, MD 13.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 26.81) (Analysis
14.6).
Expressive language: written
The written language subtest of the AAT measures reading aloud
and writing to dictation. Meinzer 2007 compared the groups that
received volunteer-facilitated SLT versus professionally delivered
SLT using this measure. Similarly, Wertz 1986iii used the PICA
graphic subtest to compare the groups. They found no evidence
of a difference (Analysis 14.7).
4. Severity of impairment
Four trials compared the two groups using measures of overall
severity of aphasia following either volunteer-facilitated SLT or
professional SLT using the PICA (Meikle 1979; Wertz 1986iii), an
AQ (Leal 1993), and the AAT profile (Meinzer 2007). Summary
data from the groups’ performance was unavailable for Leal 1993,
preventing inclusion within the review. There was no evidence of a
difference between the two groups following pooling of data from
the PICA and AAT profile (Analysis 14.8).
5. Number of dropouts
All four trials reported the number of participants that were lost
to the trial following randomisation. Three trials lost a total of 30
participants from the groups receiving volunteer-facilitated SLT,
while 22 participants dropped out of the groups that received
professional SLT interventions (Leal 1993; Meikle 1979; Wertz
1986iii). Meinzer 2007 had no participant withdrawals. An addi-
tional participant that had received volunteer-facilitated SLT and
two participants that had received professional SLT were lost at
follow-up (Wertz 1986iii). No participants were reported lost at
follow-up from Leal 1993. Overall, there was no evidence of a
38

 difference in the numbers of dropouts between the groups that re-
ceived volunteer-facilitated SLT and those that had professionally
delivered SLT (Analysis 14.9).
6. Adherence to allocated intervention
Only two of the three trials provided details for participant with-
drawals (Leal 1993; Meikle 1979). Overall there was no differ-
ence between the groups. Five participants declined to continue
participating in the volunteer-facilitated SLT groups, while four
declined in the professional SLT groups (Analysis 14.10).
Computer-facilitated versus professionally facilitated SLT
Three trials compared an SLT intervention that was facilitated by
a computer versus SLT that relied only on professional therapist
support (ORLA 2010, Woolf 2015i, Wertz 1981). In ORLA 2010
all 25 participants received 24 one-hour sessions of an Oral Read-
ing for Language in Aphasia (ORLA) treatment. The rate of deliv-
ery of therapy ranged from one to four sessions per week per par-
ticipant, with a mean overall treatment duration of 12.26 weeks
(range 6 to 22 weeks). The dosage of therapy was similar across the
comparison groups randomised within Wertz 1981 (352 hours)
and Woolf 2015i (8 hours). Similarly, the groups within the trials
did not differ in the number of weeks of treatment received. The
trial compared computer-facilitated SLT with professional SLT
delivery across a range of measures, including functional commu-
nication, receptive language, expressive language, severity of im-
pairment, number of dropouts, and follow-up data. Studies did
not evaluate psychosocial or economic measures.
1. Functional communication
ORLA 2010 reported two measures of discourse efficiency based
on a picture description and narrative discourse samples (words
per minute and content information units per minute; Nicholas
1995). Woolf 2015i also captured discourse measures (substantive
turns, content words per turn and nouns per turn) based on an
unstructured conversational sample. On pooling the content in-
formation data from both Woolf 2015i and ORLA 2010 with the
Wertz 1981 Pragmatic Protocol data, there was no indication of
a difference between the two groups’ functional communication
(Analysis 15.1), nor did this finding alter on pooling the Wertz
1981 data with the other discourse summary data.
2. Receptive language
Investigators compared participants’ auditory and reading com-
prehension using the Token Test (Wertz 1981), the PICA gestu-
ral subtest (Wertz 1981), and the WAB reading comprehension
subtest (ORLA 2010). There was no indication of a difference
between the groups that received SLT facilitated by computer and
those that received SLT via a professional therapist on these recep-
tive language measures (Analysis 15.2).
3. Expressive language
Both Wertz 1981 (PICA verbal subtest) and Woolf 2015i (pic-
ture naming test with score for treated, untreated and total) used
measures of expressive language to compare trial groups. Partici-
pants who used a computer during therapy performed better on
measures of untreated words than the participants who worked
directly with a professional therapist. There was no other evidence
of a difference between the groups (Analysis 15.3). ORLA 2010
assessed participants’ writing skills using the WAB writing sub-
test, and Wertz 1981 used the PICA graphic subtest. There was
no evidence of a difference between the two groups’ writing skills
(Analysis 15.4).
4. Severity of impairment
On pooling the data from ORLA 2010 (WABAQ) and the PICA
overall (Wertz 1981), there was no evidence of a significant differ-
ence between the participants that accessed SLT via a computer
interface and those that had accessed it via a professional therapist
(Analysis 15.5).
5. Number of dropouts
None of the participants in ORLA 2010 were lost during the
study. While Wertz 1981 lost participants in both the group with
access to a computer during therapy (N=15) and the group that
had a professional therapist to support their therapy (N=16), there
was no evidence of a difference between the number of dropouts
between these groups (Analysis 15.6).
6. Follow-up data
Functional communication
Woolf 2015i followed participants up at six weeks and found no
evidence of a difference between the groups accessing therapy via
computer and those via a professional therapist as measured by
the substantive turns, content words per turn, or the number of
nouns per turn in an unstructured conversational sample (Analysis
16.1).
Expressive language
Similarly, Woolf 2015i measured participants’ expressive language
skills at six weeks’ follow-up looking at treated and untreated Spo-
ken Picture Naming items. They found no evidence of a difference
in total Spoken Picture Naming treated items from the test. The
participants who had access to computer-facilitated SLT named
more of the untreated items than the participants who had the
support of a professional therapist face-to-face (Analysis 16.2).
Semantic SLT versus other approaches to SLT
Four trials compared participants that received SLT interventions
based on a semantic therapeutic approach with those that re-
39
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)

 ceived phonologically based SLT (RATS), communicative SLT
(RATS-2), a repetition in the presence of a picture approach SLT
(SEMaFORE), or CIAT approach to SLT (Wilssens 2015). In the
RATS-2 semantic SLT intervention, participants in this arm could
also have received a phonologically based SLT in conjunction with
or instead of the semantic approach depending on the individ-
ual participant’s needs. Therapy regimen was similar across both
groups, with the semantic intervention being delivered over 9 to 10
days (Wilssens 2015), six weeks (SEMaFORE), up to six months
(RATS-2), or 40 weeks (RATS). Regardless of whether they were
randomised to receive a semantically based SLT approach or an-
other type of SLT, participants received 13.5 hours (SEMaFORE),
an average of 19 hours (Wilssens 2015), 40 to 60 hours (RATS),
or 52 hours of SLT (RATS-2). Studies compared groups across a
range of measures, including functional communication, receptive
language, expressive language, number of dropouts, and adherence
to allocated intervention. The trials did not assess psychosocial or
economic measures. The SEMaFORE trial, although complete,
was not yet fully published, so no suitable data were available for
inclusion in the meta-analyses in this section.
1. Functional communication
Three trials measured functional communication using the
ANELT (RATS; RATS-2; Wilssens 2015), and one used the CETI
(Wilssens 2015). On pooling the ANELT data, there was no ev-
idence of a difference between the functional communication of
groups that received a semantic SLT approach compared with
those that received another SLT approach (Analysis 17.1). There
was no change in this finding upon pooling the Wilssens 2015
CETI data with the ANELT data from RATS and RATS-2.
2. Receptive language
Receptive language: auditory comprehension
Both RATS-2 and Wilssens 2015 measured participants’ auditory
comprehension using the Token Test, and on pooling the data,
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
17.2). Wilssens 2015 also used the AAT comprehension test but
found no difference between the groups’ comprehension skills (
Analysis 17.2).
Receptive language: other
Three trials compared participants’ language skills using the Se-
mantic Association Test (RATS; RATS-2; Wilssens 2015). On
pooling the data there was no evidence of a difference between the
groups that received semantic-based SLT and those that received
another SLT approach. Similarly, on the PALPA measures of Se-
mantic Association (RATS-2; Wilssens 2015), the Auditory Lex-
ical Decision (RATS; RATS-2; Wilssens 2015), or the Auditory
Synonym Judgement test (Wilssens 2015), there was no evidence
of a difference between the groups’ performance (Analysis 17.3).
3. Expressive language
Expressing language: naming
Wilssens 2015 compared participants’ naming abilities using the
AAT naming subtest and the BNT (Analysis 17.4). There was no
evidence of a difference between the groups.
Expressing language: writing
Similarly, Wilssens 2015 used the AAT writing subtest to compare
participants’ writing skills and found no evidence of a difference
between the groups (Analysis 17.5).
Expressing language: repetition
Twotrialscomparedparticipants’ repetitionskillsusingthe PALPA
non-word repetition test (RATS-2; Wilssens 2015), and one used
the AAT repetition subtest (Wilssens 2015). There was no indica-
tion of a difference between the groups (Analysis 17.6).
Expressing language: fluency
RATS-2 measured participants’ word fluency using letters and se-
mantic subtests but found no evidence of a difference between the
groups (Analysis 17.7).
4. Number of dropouts
Wilssens 2015 had no dropouts during the course of the trial. In
contrast, between RATS and RATS-2, 10 participants were lost
from the semantic SLT interventions compared with 12 from the
other SLT interventions (Analysis 17.8).
5. Adherence to allocated intervention
Of the trials that reported dropouts, eight participants were unable
to comply with the allocated semantic SLT intervention compared
with eight from the phonological SLT and communicative SLT
groups (RATS; RATS-2; see Analysis 17.9).
Constraint-induced aphasia therapy versus other SLT
Five trials have recently emerged comparing a CIAT SLT approach
with either conventional one-to-one SLT (FUATAC; Pulvermuller
2001; VERSE II), another group therapy (Sickert 2014), or a
semantic SLT approach (Wilssens 2015). The CIAT was delivered
over 10 days (Pulvermuller 2001; Wilssens 2015), 15 days (Sickert
2014), five weeks (VERSE II), and six weeks (FUATAC). The
comparator SLT approach was delivered over 15 to 20 hours (
VERSE II), 19 hours (Wilssens 2015), 22.5 hours (FUATAC),
30 hours (Sickert 2014), or an average of 34 hours (Pulvermuller
2001). The duration of the contrasting therapy provision ranged
from 9 to 10 days (Wilssens 2015), 15 days (Sickert 2014), three
to five weeks (Pulvermuller 2001), five weeks (VERSE II), and six
40

 weeks (FUATAC). Three trials controlled the duration and dose
of therapy across both groups (Sickert 2014; VERSE II; Wilssens
2015).
1. Functional communication
Three trials compared participants that received CIAT to those
that received another SLT approach on measures of functional
communication, including the ANELT (Wilssens 2015), Dis-
course Analysis (correct information numbers per minute during
samples of picture description and procedural discourse) (VERSE
II), the spontaneous speech AAT subtest (Sickert 2014), and the
CETI (Wilssens 2015). On pooling the ANELT, Discourse Anala-
ysis scores, and the AAT subtest data, there was no evidence of a
difference between the groups (Analysis 18.1). This finding did
not change when the CETI data were included in the meta-anal-
ysis instead of the ANELT data.
2. Receptive language
Receptive language: auditory comprehension
Three trials used both the Token Test and the AAT auditory com-
prehension subtest to compare participants’ auditory language
skills (Pulvermuller 2001; Sickert 2014; Wilssens 2015). Despite
pooling the data from across these trials on each of these measures,
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
18.2).
Receptive language: other
Wilssens 2015 also compared the groups receiving CIAT versus
a semantic SLT approach on the Semantic Association Test, the
PALPA Semantic Association, the Auditory Lexical Decision test,
and Auditory Synonym Judgement. There was no indication of a
difference between the groups (Analysis 18.3).
3. Expressive language
Expressive language: naming
Investigators compared participants’ naming abilities using the
AAT naming subtest in three trials (Pulvermuller 2001; Sickert
2014; Wilssens 2015), while one trial used the Boston Naming
Test (Wilssens 2015). On pooling the AAT naming subtest data,
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups nor was
there any indication of a difference on the BNT (Analysis 18.4).
Expressive language: repetition
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups’ per-
formance on measuring repetition using the AAT subtest in
Pulvermuller 2001, Sickert 2014, and Wilssens 2015 nor when
using the PALPA non-words repetition subtest in Wilssens 2015
(Analysis 18.5).
Expressive language: writing
Both Sickert 2014 and Wilssens 2015 measured participants’ writ-
ing skills on the AAT writing subtests, but on pooling the data
there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
18.6).
4. Quality of Life
VERSE II measured participants’ quality of life using the SAQoL
and found no evidence of a difference between those that received
CIAT SLT and those that received a conventional SLT approach
(Analysis 18.7).
5. Severity of impairment
Only two trials measured the severity of participants’ aphasia:
Pulvermuller2001 used the AAT overall score, and VERSE II used
the WABAQ. On pooling the data, there was no evidence of a
difference between the groups (Analysis 18.8).
6. Follow-up data
VERSE II measured participants’ functional communication us-
ing a Discourse Analysis score, quality of life using the SAQoL, and
the severity of aphasia using the WABAQ at 12 and 26 weeks fol-
low-up. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups
that had received CIAT versus conventional SLT at these time
points (Analysis 19.1; Analysis 19.2; Analysis 19.3).
Experimental SLT versus other SLT
Additional studies evaluated a range of other experimental ap-
proaches to SLT versus an alternative SLT approach.
• SLT with a gestural adjunct during language production.
• Melodic intonation therapy (MIT)
• Functional SLT
• Operant training
• Verb comprehension
• Discourse therapy
• Task-specific naming and sentence production
• Language oriented therapy
• Systematic Therapy for Auditory Comprehension
Disorders in Aphasic Patients (STACDAP)
• Filmed programmed instruction
In most cases, investigators broadly described the comparison
treatment as ’conventional’ SLT. In MIT 2014i the comparison
was to therapy that focused on language comprehension and writ-
ten language, while in Crerar 1996 the comparison was to prepo-
sition therapy. Additionally, many of these experimental interven-
tions were evaluated in randomised controlled trials that were fea-
sibility studies in nature and have so far occurred in isolation.

 Thus, pooled analysis was not possible. For completeness within
this review, however, we have presented these interventions below.
SLT with gestural adjunct versus ’conventional’ SLT (no
gesture)
Two trials compared conventional therapy (with no gestural move-
ment) versus an SLT intervention with a gestural adjunct: Crosson
2014 by encouraging the use of a gesture during naming activities,
and Drummond 1981 by supporting cueing. The format of the
summary data reported within Drummond 1981 prevented in-
clusion in the meta-analyses. We present data from Crosson 2014
comparing functional communication, expressive language and
severity of aphasia measures post-therapy and at three-month fol-
low-up in Analysis 20.1 to Analysis 20.6. There was no evidence
of a significant difference between the groups.
MIT versus SLT (excluding targeted spoken verbal
production)
One trial compared a melodic intonation therapy approach (MIT)
to SLT, focusing on written language production, language com-
prehension, and non-verbal communication strategies (i.e. non-
language production target) (MIT 2014i). The data for this trial
relating to measures of functional communication, expressive lan-
guage (naming and repetition), and number of dropouts can be
seen in Analysis 21.1 to Analysis 21.4. Repetition of trained MIT
items showed some evidence of effect, but otherwise there was
no evidence of a difference between the groups. Data from MIT
2014ii are as yet unavailable.
Functional versus conventional SLT
The randomised comparison of a functional SLT approach with
a conventional SLT intervention is presented as measured by rat-
ings on the CETI (Hinckley 2001). There was no evidence of a
difference between the groups (Analysis 22.1). Other data were
available but only as change from baseline summary data and thus
we did not include them here.
Operant training SLT versus conventional SLT
The randomisedcomparisonstakenfromthe cross-overtrialscom-
pared an operant training SLT intervention with conventional SLT
plus an attention control (Lincoln 1984b; Lincoln 1982i; Lincoln
1982ii). We present these results separately within the data and
analysis tables for information purposes (Analysis 23.1 to Analysis
23.5). Lincoln 1982i and Lincoln 1982ii randomised participants
across four groups that compared SLT plus an operant training
adjunct versus SLT plus a social support and stimulation adjunct.
In both of these trials, we extracted the means and SD from un-
published individual patient data, which are inclusive of the treat-
ment cross-over period. Given the complementary nature of the
cross-over intervention (SLT plus operant training or SLT plus
social support) and the clinically relevant nature of the cross-over
treatments, we felt it was appropriate to include these data within
the review. We present data relating to measures of receptive and
expressive language and severity of aphasia in Analysis 23.1 to
Analysis 23.5.
Verb comprehension SLT versus preposition comprehension
SLT
Crerar 1996 compared a computer-mediated approach to verb
comprehension therapy with a computer-mediated preposition
comprehension therapy. The trial had a cross-over design, and we
only included data collected prior to the point of cross-over in
the review. The participant group included people with acquired
language impairment as a result of other neurological causes, and
some participants in the main trial were not truly randomly allo-
cated to an intervention, undergoing a quasi-random allocation as
a result of their language impairment profile, transport situation,
or geographical location. We extracted and included in the review
only the data from participants with aphasia as a result of stroke
that underwent an adequate randomisation procedure. We present
the data from the measures of receptive language, expressive lan-
guage and severity of aphasia in Analysis 24.1 to Analysis 24.4 .
Discourse therapy versus conventional SLT
One trial compared participants that received therapy aiming to
support the development and production of discourse language
with those that received conventional deficit-focused SLT on mea-
sures of word, sentence and discourse performance across four dis-
course genre, measures of naming, sentence production, and com-
prehension (NARNIA 2013). There was no evidence of a differ-
ence between the groups (Analysis 25.1 to Analysis 25.3).
Task-specific naming and sentence production SLT versus
conventional SLT
Van Steenbrugge 1981 compared participants that received a ’task-
specific’ approach to SLT focused on naming and sentence produc-
tion versus a conventional ’general stimulation’ approach to SLT
using measures of the Functional Expression (FE) Scale, measures
of naming, and sentence construction. There was no evidence of
a difference between the groups (Analysis 26.1 to Analysis 26.6).
Language oriented therapy (LOT) versus conventional SLT
Based on psycholinguistic principles, Shewan 1984i compared
LOT versus a conventional stimulation-facilitation approach, us-
ing the WAB and the ACTS to measure outcomes but suitable
summary data were unavailable and so these could not be included
in the meta-analyses. There was no evidence of a difference be-
tween the groups in relation to numbers of participants dropping
out or adherence rates (Analysis 27.1; Analysis 27.2).

 Task-specific SLT versus conventional SLT
Prins 1989 compared an SLT intervention focusing specifically on
auditory comprehension problems (STACDAP) versus conven-
tional stimulation therapy using functional communication indi-
cators and receptive and expressive language outcome measures.
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
28.1 to Analysis 28.7).
Filmed programme instruction plus SLT versus conventional
SLT
Di Carlo 1980 compared the use of a filmed adjunct to SLT with
conventional SLT approaches on measures of receptive language.
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (Analysis
29.1).

Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 D I S C U S S I O N
We updated this complex review of the effectiveness of SLT inter-
ventions for people with aphasia following stroke to reflect new ev-
idence and developments in clinical practice. We assessed whether
SLT is more effective than no SLT, whether SLT is more effective
than social support and stimulation, and whether one SLT inter-
vention is more effective than another. We identified, synthesised
and presented data from 57 trials (and 3002 participants) in this
review.
Summary of main results
Our review includes information on a total of 3002 participants
randomised across 74 comparisons. We synthesise the data into
three broad comparisons, and we consider these findings below as
they relate to SLT versus no SLT, SLT versus social support, and
one type of SLT versus a different SLT approach.
SLT versus no SLT
Based on 27 trials involving 1620 participants, we found signif-
icant differences between the scores of participants who received
SLT and those that did not. Specifically, these differences were
evidenced in measures of functional communication, receptive
language (including reading), and expressive language (including
writing), all of which favoured the provision of SLT (Summary
of findings for the main comparison). However, significant differ-
ences were not evident across all measures. Sample sizes remain
small, and there is some indication of one or two trials’ highly
significant findings impacting upon the meta-analyses. We have
profiled the available evidence relating to therapy follow-up data
from these trials which is (as yet) limited in the number of trials
and contributing participants (Summary of findings 2).
We observed notable statistical heterogeneity among some of the
SLT versus no SLT comparisons (e.g. expressive language: general,
I2 =76%andthe severityof impairmentcomparison,I2 =93%).In
addition, we also noted measures based on either the Aphasia Bat-
tery of Chinese or the Chinese Aphasia Measurement tools fell out-
side of the 95% CIs of the associated funnel plots. While we might
expect that a proportion (5%) of the results would be observed in
this manner by chance, the frequency of the observation is above
what we might expect to occur by chance alone. There are a num-
ber of possible explanations for these observations. The Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions suggests consid-
eration of several possible sources of heterogeneity and asymmetry
in funnel plots. Selection bias, poor methodological quality, true
heterogeneity, artefact, or chance may have contributed (Higgins
2011). Zhang 2007i, Zhang 2007ii and Zhao 2000 took place in
China, where doctors and nurses deliver SLT interventions rather
than professional therapists, as may be the case for the other trials
in this meta-analysis. Other aspects of stroke care may also have
differed. We also have limited information on the study popula-
tions included within these trials, particularly from the Zhao 2000
trial, which does not report time post onset, patient demograph-
ics or aphasia severity. Information on the methodological design
is also very limited, particularly in relation to the randomisation,
concealment of allocation, and blinding of outcome assessors.
Abstracts of these Chinese trials were published in English, thus
the contribution of professional translators unfamiliar with some
of the technical specifications or methodological terms used in
health services research may have had an impact. Within these
articles, authors report that the participants within the trials were
randomised to the different interventions. Thus, they were eligible
for inclusion within this review. Our attempts to access trial details
similarly required translation of the trial reports, which may also
have introduced some discrepancies between the original meaning
of the trialists and our translations. The exact nature of the ran-
domisation processes is unclear, and if we look at the sample sizes
of the groups (within Zhao 2000 for example), there is consider-
able imbalance between the numbers that received SLT (98 par-
ticipants) and those that did not (40 participants) raising further
questions regarding the randomisation processes employed within
some studies. Information about some of the tools (and subtests
of these tools) used within these trials (such as the Aphasia Battery
of Chinese or the Chinese Aphasia Measurement) were unavail-
able to us. Our pooling of data relating to ’verbal presentation’
may not exactly capture the same aspects of verbal expression as
other tools within our meta-analysis. Similarly, issues relating to
the tools’ validity and reliability were unavailable. Despite our best
efforts, we failed to communicate with the Zhang 2007i, Zhang
2007ii or Zhao 2000 trialists to confirm or obtain clarification on
any of these issues. In the meantime, the reader should be mind-
ful of the inconsistencies observed within our meta-analyses when
interpreting the findings from this section of the review. We look
forward to the availability of the currently ongoing trials in the
future, which will further inform this comparison.
SLT versus social support
A total of 447 people were randomised across nine trials to receive
either SLT or a social support and stimulation intervention. While
we observed some significant differences in the performance of
the groups on various measures of language performance (favour-
ing those that received social support), most findings were derived
from one small trial of 18 participants (Lincoln 1982iii). The more
recent, large, rigorously conducted ACTNoW 2011 trial found
no evidence of a significant difference between the functional lan-
guage skills of the two groups. Additional data are required to
confirm whether social support and stimulation provides benefits
to some aspects of participants’ language skills and on measures
of severity of aphasia impairment. In contrast, other significant
differences observed (informed by five trials in this comparison)
showed that significantly more participants allocated to social sup-
port and stimulation interventions dropped out or did not adhere
to the intervention when compared with the participants allocated
to SLT. While social support and stimulation may be beneficial to
48
Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke (Review)

 some aspects of participants’ language performance, we need addi-
tional evidence to support this. Where social support and stimu-
lation interventions are being delivered, practitioners should pro-
vide clear explanation of the nature and purpose of the support to
individuals to reduce any dissatisfaction that might be experienced
and which may have resulted in the significantly higher dropout
rates observed.
SLT A versus SLT B
Thirty-eight trials, involving 1242 participants, compared two dif-
ferent types of SLT. This section of the review has grown consid-
erably since our 2012 review, and thus we were able to compare
different therapy regimens (differing in intensity, dosage and du-
ration), different therapy delivery models (group, one-to-one, vol-
unteer, computer facilitated) and different theoretical approaches
(e.g. constraint-induced therapy, semantic therapy). In general,
comparisons continue to be based on a small number of trials in-
volving few participants (typically less than 20). Additional data
are still required to further inform these comparisons. The effec-
tiveness of popular SLT approaches such as functional SLT or con-
straint-induced aphasia therapy were informed by a small num-
ber of trials and did not demonstrate evidence of the effectiveness
of these approaches over conventional SLT approaches. Some of
the data from these trials were unavailable to this review, so we
could not include them in the meta-analyses. While we hope that
these data may become available in the future, we are also looking
forward to the availability of data from ongoing trials, which will
further inform these comparisons.
There was little evidence of any difference between group SLT and
one-to-one SLT, computer-facilitated, or volunteer-facilitated SLT
versus professional SLT, although these comparisons were based on
limited numbers of trials involving small numbers of participants.
The available evidence, however, indicates there is no evidence
of a difference in the provision of SLT interventions facilitated
by volunteers or computers (under the direction of professional
therapists and with appropriate access to relevant therapy materials
and therapeutic intervention plans) compared with direct therapy
provision by a professional therapist.
We identified eight trials that compared high-intensity to low-in-
tensity SLT. There was some indication of benefits to participants’
functional language skills based on the synthesis of data from two
trials. Based on pooled data from five different trials, we also ob-
served improvements in severity of aphasia following high-inten-
sity SLT. However, the number of participants dropping out from
the high-intensity SLT groups was significantly higher than in the
low-intensity SLT groups, confounding the results and suggesting
that high-intensity approaches to therapy (4 to 15 hours per week)
may not be suited to all patients. Following Cochrane editorial
review, we considered the timing of participant recruitment to the
contributing trials as a possible factor to the tolerance of high-
intensity interventions. The trials contributing to this analyses re-
cruited with two weeks (two RCTs), one to three months (four
RCTs), and between two to eight years (two RCTs) after onset of
aphasia. Effects were no longer observed in a post hoc comparison
of trials recruiting participants several years after stroke (nor did
those trials report any dropouts). The beneficial effect remained
for trials that recruited within three months of aphasia onset, al-
though the significantly higher dropouts from the high-intensity
groups came only from those trials. Similarly, we observed some
indication of a benefit of a high dose of therapy (between 60 and
208 hours of therapy) compared with a lower dose of SLT (rang-
ing from 5 to 78 hours), but significant differences were based on
findings from a single trial with small numbers of participants.
However, where trial data overlapped, as in the number of trial
dropouts reported by three trials, the participants who received
the lower dose of therapy were less likely to drop out than those
that received the higher dose.
It is possible that the timing of an intervention after stroke may be
an important factor in both the effectiveness of and tolerance to
specific intervention approaches. There are possible interactions
between specific individual, aphasia and stroke profiles and the
characteristics of complex SLT interventions that vary by inter-
vention regimen, delivery model, and theoretical approach. Explo-
ration of these issues is not suited to Cochrane review methodolo-
gies. Instead a large, international, multidisciplinary collaboration
of aphasia researchers is aiming to examine such aspects through
the RELEASE project.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
We identified a substantial number of trials of relevance to our
review; most were eligible for inclusion. Across the included trials
there was a lack of comprehensive data collection, a wide range of
outcome tools employed, and disappointingly inadequate report-
ing of outcome measures. Many of the trialists generously shared
unpublished data and supplementary information to enable accu-
rate representation of their trial in this review. We are very grateful
for their time and efforts to provide this information.
Within the review, just over half of the trials described measuring
receptive (N = 45) and expressive language skills (N = 56), but not
all reported suitable data in a published format that permitted in-
clusion within this review. We were able to include most trials that
described measures of receptive language (67%; N = 30/45) and
most expressive language measures (66%; N = 37/56). Forty-seven
trials evaluated the severity of participants’ aphasia impairment,
and we included suitable data from 29 trials. Similarly, while five
trials reported measuring economic outcomes, only data from two
were available. Many trials measured participants’ functional and
psychosocial outcomes, measures that are probably most closely
aligned to the patients’ sense of recovery and return to ’normal’.
From the total of 74 randomised comparisons, more than half (N
= 44) described measuring changes in functional communication
and of these, most (N = 33/44) reported data that could be in-
49

 cluded within the meta-analyses. Few trials measured psychosocial
outcomes (N = 8) with five reporting (or providing) data suitable
for inclusion within the review.
The degree to which the models of conventional SLT employed
within the trials are reflective of therapists’ current practice should
be carefully considered across individual treatments in terms of
the frequency, duration, and the extent of therapeutic interven-
tion. To this end, we employed the TIDieR Checklist to sup-
port full data extraction of the SLT interventions within the trials
(Hoffmann 2014). In this way, the reader has access to a more com-
prehensive overview of the interventions being compared in the
Characteristics of included studies table. Participants came from
across a wide age range and were experiencing a range of apha-
sia impairments. However, the length of time since participants’
stroke raises questions of how clinically relevant some recruitment
parameters were to an SLT clinical population.
Less than a fifth (N = 13; 18%) of the included trials recruited
participants within the first month following their stroke (a par-
ticipant group of high clinical relevance) and only four of these
recruited participants within the first week after their stroke (Laska
2011; Mattioli 2014; VERSE I; VERSE II). Most recruited par-
ticipants more than one month, and in some cases many years
following their stroke (N = 49), or they did not report the time
post onset (N = 12; FUATAC; SEMaFORE; Smith 1981i; Smith
1981ii; Smith 1981iii; Szaflarski 2014; Wu 2004; Xie 2002; Yao
2005i; Yao 2005ii; Yao 2005iii; Zhao 2000). Recruitment proce-
dures involving participants up to 29 years after the onset of their
aphasia are of limited application to either a clinical or treatment
evaluation setting and raise the question of whether such inclusion
criteria are apt to demonstrate effectiveness of an SLT interven-
tion.
Quality of the evidence
Our 2016 update adds a significant amount of data and so, to-
gether with continually improving systematic review and report-
ing methodologies, we are in a better position to draw conclusions
regarding the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke.
This review included a total of 74 randomised comparisons in-
volving data from 3002 individual patients.
Methods of random sequence generation and concealment of al-
location were considered adequate in 35 and 25 trials, respectively
(Figure 2; Figure 3). The randomisation methodology for the re-
maining trials had been inadequately described, so it was not pos-
sible to judge the quality. Similarly, only seven trials reported in-
formation on allocation concealment. The lack of description and
detail does not necessarily mean inadequate procedures were in
place but rather a lack of reporting of this detail (Soares 2004).
The prevalence of good methodology in relation to blinding of
outcome assessors supports this interpretation, as more than half of
the trials within the review (N = 43) described adequate blinding
procedures. We only considered 11 to have inadequately blinded
assessors, while 20 provided too little detail to make a judgement.
Half of the trials in this review (N = 36, 49%) were published
before the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of Re-
porting Trials) (Altman 2001; Moher 2001). Disappointingly, of
the 38 trials published from 2005 (and after the implementa-
tion of the CONSORT statement) only 25 (66%) reported ad-
equate methods of generating the randomisation sequence, and
only 19 (50%) reported adequate methods of concealing alloca-
tion. Of the 20 that failed to adhere to the CONSORT state-
ment (B.A.Bar 2011i; B.A.Bar 2011ii; Conklyn 2012; Crosson
2014; FUATAC; Laska 2011; Liu 2006a; Mattioli 2014; Meinzer
2007; ORLA 2006; ORLA 2010; Rochon 2005; Smania 2006;
Szaflarski 2014; Wu 2013; Yao 2005i; Yao 2005ii; Yao 2005iii;
Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii), seven were published in Chinese
medicine or nursing journals, and three were based on an abstract
or short report of a full trial (FUATAC; ORLA 2006; Szaflarski
2014). It is essential that future trial reports adhere to these inter-
nationally accepted standards of trial reporting.
Twelve trials reported an a priori power size calculation, which is
reflected in the small numbers of randomised participants across
the trials included in the review (ACTNoW 2011; B.A.Bar 2011i;
Doesborgh 2004; Laska 2011; MIT 2014i; MIT 2014ii; NARNIA
2013; RATS; RATS-2; SP-I-RiT; Varley 2016i; Varley 2016ii).
Nine randomised 10 or fewer participants; 43 randomised up to
50 participants; 16 randomised between 51 and 100 participants;
two randomised over 100 participants and only four involved 150
individuals or more. The randomisation of such relatively small
numbers of participants reduces the power of the statistical anal-
yses, raises questions of the reliability of findings and (given the
complexity of various aphasia impairments) causes difficulties in
ensuring the comparability of the groups at baseline. Fifteen of the
included trials had groups that significantly differed at baseline,
and group comparability was unclear in another 10 randomised
comparisons.
Despite these reporting and methodological limitations, we have
synthesised a large number of trials that address the effectiveness
of SLT for aphasia following stroke across a number of outcome
measures. Across these measures, there is evidence of the effec-
tiveness of SLT for people with aphasia when compared with no
therapy provision. While the consistency in the direction of results
observed in the previous version of this review remains follow-
ing the inclusion of additional trial data, many of the significant
differences between pooled data from patients that received SLT
and those that did not include data from a single three-armed trial
(Zhang 2007i; Zhang 2007ii). Caution is required in interpreting
this trial evidence, as the randomisation procedure, concealment
of allocation, blinding, and even details of the SLT intervention
evaluated (contents, duration, frequency, intensity) are unclear.
With at least 18 additional trials of relevance to this review cur-
rently ongoing or about to report, the picture based on the cur-
rent evidence for SLT for aphasia following stroke will develop
50

 further over time. We can be confident that with the availability
of well-conducted and reported trials, the evidence will continue
to strengthen, providing more indications of the effectiveness of
specific approaches to SLT.
Thirty-one of the 74 trials in this review included all randomised
participants in their final analyses. The remaining 43 trials lost
participants during the treatment or follow-up phases, but only
eleven employed an ITT analysis. In some cases large proportions
of participants withdrew from some interventions, and at times
this appeared to be linked to the intervention itself, with signif-
icantly more participants withdrawing from both intensive SLT
and social support interventions than from comparator SLT inter-
ventions. Similarly, there was evidence of significantly fewer peo-
ple adhering to their allocated intervention when that intervention
was a social support intervention and a trend towards this when
the intervention was a high-intensity SLT.
Potential biases in the review process
Within this review, we expanded the 2012 search strategy and con-
ducted a comprehensive search for high quality trials that evalu-
ated the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke. While
we are confident we have identified most published trials of rel-
evance to the review, it is still possible that despite our efforts,
we may be unaware of additional unpublished work. Our search
strategy and study selection criteria were agreed in advance and
applied to all identified trials. Our data extraction processes were
completed independently and then compared. Whenever possi-
ble, we extracted all relevant data and sought missing data directly
from the trialists for inclusion within the review. We considered
it appropriate to include cross-over data within our review given
the nature of the comparisons, the points at which the data were
extracted and, in some cases, the availability of individual patient
data.
This review has been informed by the availability of individual
patient data (N = 323). In three trials the individual data were
presented within the associated publications, while for the remain-
ing 10 trials we are very grateful to the trialists for access to their
unpublished data, facilitating inclusion of their trial data within
the review. In addition, other trialists generously contributed the
relevant summary values thus permitting the full inclusion of im-
portant trials from this field within the meta-analyses (e.g. Wertz
1986i; Wertz 1986ii; Wertz 1986iii). However, there still remain
a number of other relevant trials that could not be fully included.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
One of the first reviews in this area was Robey 1994, which in-
cluded 21 published studies (restricted to English language but
not to RCTs). The reviewers identified at least 19 more studies
that they were unable to include because of the manner in which
the data had been reported. They concluded that the provision
of SLT in the acute stages of aphasia following stroke was twice
as effective as natural recovery patterns. Delayed therapy had a
smaller, though still evident, impact. The authors called for bet-
ter reporting of data and the use of large sample sizes. This team
later updated their review, employing the same methodologies and
including 55 studies that focused specifically on the amount and
type of SLT intervention and its impact on the severity and type
of aphasia (Robey 1998a). Again, they concluded that SLT was
effective, particularly SLT in the acute stages following stroke and
if two or more hours of therapy were provided each week. How-
ever, they again did not have access to all the relevant data, and
they excluded some key trials, such as Wertz 1986.
Bhogal 2003 reviewed 10 English language publications of con-
trolled trials from a MEDLINE search (1975 to 2002) and asso-
ciated references. They found that intensive SLT delivered signif-
icant treatment effects (when at least nine hours per week were
delivered) and that studies that failed to demonstrate a treatment
effect had only provided about two hours of SLT per week. The
total duration of SLT provision was also negatively correlated with
language outcomes. Cherney 2008 also reviewed 10 English lan-
guage publications (1990 to 2006; 15 electronic databases; not all
RCTs) and found modest evidence for intensive SLT and benefits
of constraint-induced aphasia therapy.
In contrast, Moss 2006 reviewed 23 single patient reports involv-
ing the provision by a therapist on a one-to-one basis of SLT that
targeted spoken output or auditory comprehension in 57 partic-
ipants identified following a systematic search (1985 to 2003) of
published or indexed work. They concluded that time since stroke
(and aphasia onset) is not linked to the response to SLT though
they indicate (based on their data) that response to SLT may de-
cline eight years after stroke. However, the highly selective nature
of participants in published single cases studies means that reviews
based on such a population group are of questionable applicability
to a general clinical population. Individuals (and their caregivers)
within such reports are likely to be highly motivated, educated,
dedicated, and reliable therapy participants (Moss 2006).

Implications for practice
Our review presents evidence of the benefits of SLT for people with
aphasia following stroke as measured by their functional commu-
nication, reading, comprehension, expressive language, and writ-
ing. While there is an overall consistency in the findings across all
trials included in these analyses, some of our significant findings
were dependent on data from a single trial with limited informa-
tion on the nature of the SLT intervention and the quality of the
trial. Thus, we must exercise some caution in interpreting these
51

 results. It is also of note that the SLT provided in the included
trials could be considered to be at a high level of intensity over
variable periods of time.
Based on a smaller number of trials, we also observed some indi-
cation of the benefits of high-intensity approaches to SLT in re-
lation to functional communication and severity of impairment.
The intensity of the interventions varied, as did the duration of
therapy input, but such high-intensity approaches to SLT may not
have suited all participants. Significantly more participants in the
intensive groups dropped out from these trials than from the non-
intensive groups.
Similarly, one small trial indicated that social support and stim-
ulation may be beneficial to some aspects of patients’ language
skills, but the findings were confounded by a significantly higher
participant dropout from social support interventions than from
SLT interventions.
There was insufficient evidence within this review to establish the
effectiveness of one SLT theoretical approach over another, with
little indication of a difference between group SLT versus one-to-
one SLT, and computer-mediated SLT versus therapist-delivered
SLT. Similarly, there was little indication of a difference in the
effectiveness of SLT facilitated by a trained volunteer versus SLT
delivered by a therapist. This is unsurprising, as the volunteers
in these trials received specialist training, had access to therapy
materials and in many cases were delivering therapy interventions
designed and overseen by a professional therapist. This model of
SLT treatment delivery is often used in the UK.
Implications for research
In the course of updating this review, we identified many ongoing
trials and trials that are about to report findings. In this context of
a rapidly developing evidence base, there will be a need to update
the findings of this review once the results of these ongoing trials
become available. As aphasia researchers, we need to continue to
improve the quality of SLT trials conducted. It is in pursuit of
this goal that the Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists has been es-
tablished. Funded by the European COST Association, this in-
ternational collaboration of multidisciplinary aphasia researchers
seek to enhance the development, conduct, and reporting of apha-
sia research. Aphasia researchers, funders, reviewers, and editors
should be encouraged to publish all findings from completed tri-
als. Investigators should adhere to the recommendations of the
CONSORT statement, thus ensuring that the quality of the trial is
fully demonstrated in the published report (Altman 2001; Moher
2001). In addition, the recent TIDieR guidelines seek to support
better reporting of complex interventions such as SLT for aphasia
and to ensure the transparency and transferability of research ap-
proaches into clinical practice (Hoffmann 2014). These guidelines
have also enhanced the description and profiling of included trial
SLT interventions within our Characteristics of included studies
table. Trialists should also provide full descriptions of the relevant
statistical summary data (means and SDs of final value scores)
thus allowing inclusion of their data within any subsequent rel-
evant meta-analyses. A priori sample size calculations should be
employed, ensuring SLT trials are adequately powered to demon-
strate differences. The challenge for SLT researchers and clinicians
will be to design, develop, conduct, and support larger trials. It
is essential for the success of these trials that the work is under-
taken in a collaborative manner between patients, clinicians, and
researchers. Standardised outcome measures should be employed
to evaluate the impact of SLT on participants’ functional commu-
nication, expressive and receptive language skills, and the severity
of their aphasia. We welcome the work currently ongoing in the
ROMA study to achieve international consensus on a minimum
core data set for aphasia research.
Supported by UK NIHR funding, the RELEASE project is con-
ducting a more detailed examination of the effectiveness of SLT
and the interaction between specific individuals, aphasia and
stroke profiles, therapy regimens, theoretical approaches, and de-
livery models. The internationally collaborative group of aphasia
researchers is gathering individual patient data from across more
than 50 pre-existing aphasia research studies for the purposes of
secondary data analyses, which will specifically examine many of
the issues raised in this review. Additional expressions of interest
in contribution of aphasia research data sets are welcome.
Our overall aim for future research should be to establish what
is the optimum approach, frequency, duration of allocation, and
format of SLT provision for specific patient groups.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
ACTNoW 2011
Methods
Multicentre RCT stratified by severity of communication impairment and recruiting
site, UK
Participants
Inclusion criteria: communication impairment as a result of aphasia, therapist considers
able to engage in therapy and likely to benefit, consent
Exclusion criteria: subarachnoid haemorrhage, dementia, learning disabilities, non-En-
glish speaker, serious comorbidity, unable to complete screening procedure within 3 at-
tempts or 2 weeks, family or caregiver objection, therapist assessment required prior to
trial screening
Group 1: 76 participants
Group 2: 77 participants
Details of participants are shown in Table 1
Interventions
1. Conventional SLT
Intervention: speech and language therapy. Materials: communication charts, person-
alised advice booklet, session record, patient life book, AAC devices. Procedures: man-
ualised (assessment, information provision, provision of communication materials, care-
giver contact, indirect contact (with MDT), direct contact). Direct remediation of speech
and language: impairment (hypothesis-driven approach to rehabilitation of language
skills), activity (compensatory strategies and conversational skills training), and partic-
ipation (specific exercises) approaches. Promotion of alternative means of communica-
tion, support adjustment to communication impairment, improving communication
environment. Provided by: 4 therapists. Led by highly experienced speech and language
therapists plus delivery by other therapists. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, clinic or home.
Regimen: Per protocol. 3 sessions (varied length) weekly up to 16 weeks. Delivered
average of 22 sessions (18 h) over 13 weeks. Tailoring: individualised. Modification:
therapy amount. Adherence: monitored.
2. Social support and stimulation
Intervention: 9 part-time paid trained visitors. Attention control. Materials: approved
board games and activities. Procedures: manualised. Participant-led. Everyday activities
building rapport including general conversation and activities (reading to the participant,
watching television, playing board games (e.g. chess), creative activities, gardening) TV,
music. Plus sessions to prepare participants for cessation of visits. Provided by: trained
paid visitors. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, hospital and at home. Regimen: Per protocol
up to 3 sessions (varied length up to 60 mins) weekly for 16 weeks. Delivered max
45 sessions (average 15 h; 1-45 contacts, max 41 h) up to 16 weeks. Tailoring: yes.
Individualised. Modification: amount of visits (above). Adherence: monitored
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: functional communication; expert blinded therapist rating of semi-
structured conversation using TOMs
Secondary outcomes: participant and caregivers’ own perception of functional commu-
nication and quality of life, costs of communication therapy compared with that of at-
tention control
Data collection: baseline and 6 months postrandomisation

Interventions
1. Supervised intensive language self training
Intervention: computer SLT. Designed to facilitate dialogue skills in everyday life, use
of adjacency pairs (Schegloff 2007). The turns are functionally related to each other
(e.g. greeting-greeting: “Hello”-“Hi”; leave-taking leave-taking: “Goodbye”-“Bye!”) or
information acts (e.g. question-answer: “When is the doctor’s office open?”-“From 2
until 5 p.m.”). The guiding principle is “talk-in-interaction” (Schegloff 2004).
Materials: B.A.Bar equipment. Simple electronic device makes use of barcodes that carry
linguistic information suited to language learning. Speech of various levels of complexity
(words, phrases, sentences, texts) can be recorded, stored, and replayed as often as needed
during learning. When a barcode is scanned, the recorded language is replayed to facili-
tate reproduction. The learning material consisted of short dialogues composed of 3 ad-
jacency pairs: a conventional beginning (e.g. greeting-greeting), a main information part
(e.g. question-answer, offer-affirmation), and a conventional ending (e.g. leave-taking
leave-taking). Each half-day training of dialogues had to be complemented by corre-
sponding vocabulary drill exercises that required auditory word comprehension (word-
picture matching) and oral naming.The items were always related to the topics conveyed
by the dialogues. The 2 tasks were again carried out by means of barcode scanning.
Moreover, the drill exercises contained 6 to 8 items for oral naming and 6 items for
comprehension. Procedures: weekly supervision of the home training. B.A.Bar dialogue
training. Exercise sheets with dialogues were given to the participants so that learners with
aphasia could placethemselves in the role of the responding partner. The home training
material consisted of 48 dialogues that represented characteristic scenes from 2 different
thematic fields of daily living. Half of the dialogues were related to shopping, food, and
drinking, the other half to health and illness. For each thematic field, a separate booklet
with practice material containing 24 dialogues was prepared. Booklets were separated
into 4 chapters with 2 subchapters each. The participants were instructed to practice the
8 subchapters in sequence, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, 4 d a week. Thus,
every half day, 3 dialogues had to be practiced. During the 4-week training, the total
material was practiced twice: the first thematic field during the 1st and 3rd week and the
second thematic field during the 2nd and 4th week. Provided by: B.A.Bar Equipment,
which reads barcodes provided to therapists in private practice for use with randomised
patients. Each therapist received 1 h of training before participant began to use B.A.Barr.
Delivery: computer-facilitated, 1 participant using 1 computer at home plus 1 h in clinic
with therapist (and no computer). Regimen: practice twice a day for 1 h per session, 4
d per week (for 4 weeks) plus 1 h private session with speech and language therapist.
Tailoring: yes. Modification: SLT focused on items described as difficult by patient and
selected dialogues practiced. Adherence: monitored through supervision once a week
by speech and language therapist in private practice and supported through dialogue,
roleplay, review of difficult items, planning of future sessions, self evaluation forms from
therapists
2. Visual-cognitive tasks
Intervention: no SLT. Attention control. Materials non-linguistic cognitive training
focusedonbasicfunctionsof visual exploration andattention. Itinvolvedvisual-cognitive
exercises such as visual matching of a part to the whole, maze games, comparing 2 pictures
to find differences, or searching for target objects in complex pictures. A separate booklet
of worksheets was developed for each week of training, again-like the language training-
separated into 4 chapters and 8 subchapters. During the 4-week treatment, the total

(Continued)
visual-cognitive material was also practiced twice, the first booklet during the 1st and
3rd week and the second booklet during the 2nd and 4th week. Similar to the language
training, the participants recorded the practice time after each session on protocol sheets.
Each individual training session was based on a subchapter of the booklet containing 15
exercises: 5 pictures with visual differences, 4 maze games, 3 matching exercises, and 3
searching exercises. The time required to complete 1 session of cognitive training was
calculated to be equal to the time needed for 1 session of B.A.Bar language training
(approximately 30 min each). It should be noted that the B.A.Bar technology was not
used during cognitive training, and feedback on correct solutions was given only during
supervision but not during the home training. Procedures: visual-cognitive exercises.
Provided by: speech and language therapist supervision, professional. Delivery: 1-to-
1 and self management; face-to-face and self management, at home plus 1 h in clinic.
Regimen: practice twice a day for 1 h per session, 4 d per week (for 4 weeks) plus 1 h
private clinic session with speech and language therapist. Total dose = 36 h. Tailoring:
yes. Modification: cognitive problem-solving strategies were checked, and alternative
strategies were shown to the participants. Adherence: monitored through supervision
once a week by speech and language therapist in private practice and supported through
diaglogue, roleplay, review of difficult items, planning of future sessions, self evaluation
forms from therapists

Methods
Multicentre RCT stratified by severity of aphasia (mild/moderate/severe) and time post-
stroke (< 2 years/≥ 2 years), UK
Participants
Inclusion criteria: diagnosis of stroke and aphasia with word-finding difficulties as 1 of
the predominant features as assessed by the Object and Action Naming Battery and
the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (Druks 2000; Swinburn 2004, respectively). Partici-
pants were included only if they had the ability to repeat spoken words presented by
the recruiting speech and language therapist. Eligible participants no longer received
impairment-focused speech and language therapy enabling the computer treatment to
be better isolated and evaluated. Participants with motor deficits poststroke were not
excluded from the study. Where upper limb impairments made physical manipulation
of the computer hardware difficult, assistive devices such as tracker balls or touchscreen
computers were offered to enable access to the computer treatment
Exclusion criteria: 3 people with severe visual or cognitive difficulties reducing ability to
use the computer programme were excluded from the study, tested by the ability to see
and perform a simple, nonlanguage-based computer game
Group 1: 16 participants
Group 2: 17 participants
Details of participants are shown in Table 1
Interventions
1. Computer-mediated word finding therapy
Intervention: StepbyStep. Computer programmes developed for the treatment of apha-
sia provide exercises that can be carried out on a regular basis, targeting personal vocabu-
lary and focusing on the patient’s conversational needs. Such software has been reported
to be useful in the provision of intensive independent language practice, giving rise to
new opportunities to provide self management of continued aphasia treatment. There
is growing evidence to suggest that the use of aphasia software can help to improve out-
comes in language domains including reading, spelling, and expressive language. Mate-
rials: usual language activities (as described in no SLT arm). In addition, they received
speech and language therapy intervention delivered through independent use of a com-
puter therapy programme (StepbyStep) configured by a speech and language therapist
and supported by a volunteer. A library of more than 13,000 language exercises. Pho-
tographic images can be added to enable practice of personally relevant words such as
names of people and pets. The intervention group practiced Object and Action Nam-
ing battery words during the treatment (Druks 2000). In addition, participants in the
intervention group practiced 48 words of personal relevance. Procedures: each exercise
follows steps progressing from listening to target words, producing words with visual, se-

mantic, phonemic, or written letter/word cues through to saying the words in sentences.
Speech and language therapist also provided initial instruction to the participant and
caregiver on how to use the computer exercises and progress through the therapy steps.
Volunteers provided assistance in using the software and hardware, encouragement to
practice, and activities to promote use of the new words in daily life. Provided by: speech
and language therapist tailored the steps in the therapy process. Volunteers provided
assistance in using the software and hardware, encouragement to practice, and activities
to promote use of the new words in daily life. Volunteers contacted the participants
once a week in the first month and at least once a month thereafter by telephone or
home visit. Speech and language therapists trained. Volunteers included SLT students
and existing volunteers from communication support groups. Volunteers were given a 3
h training session on how to use the StepbyStep programme and their role in supporting
the intervention. Delivery: 1-to-1, computer facilitated. Speech and language therapist
supported face-to-face, at home. Regimen: per protocol: 20 minutes 3 d a week for 5
months (approximately 1500 minutes of practice time in total). Volunteers contacted
the participants once a week in the first month and at least once a month thereafter by
telephone or home visit. Total dose = 25 h therapy. Tailoring: yes. Speech and language
therapist tailored the steps in the therapy process as appropriate to the abilities and needs
of the individual participant and provided initial instruction to the participant and care-
giver on how to use the computer exercises and progress through the therapy steps.as
appropriate to the abilities and needs of the individual. Modification: tailored choice of
words and level of difficulty. Adherence: collected data via computer programme

Outcomes
Primary outcomes: feasibility of carrying out the study design and using self managed
computer treatment supported by volunteers as a long-term intervention. Primary mea-
sures of feasibility were the recruitment rate, completion rates, and statistical variability.
Outcomes indicating feasibility of the intervention included the percentage of the eligible
population interested in receiving the intervention, the ability to offer the intervention
per protocol (provision of computer software and volunteer support), and the ability
of the participants to carry out the intervention per protocol (using the computer for
at least 20 min 3 times a week for 5 months). Amount of practice time was stored by
the StepbyStep computer software automatically and reviewed by a speech and language
therapist at the end of treatment
Secondary outcome: measures of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Naming words that had
been practiced in treatment at 5 and 8 months from baseline from the Object and Action
Naming Battery (Druks 2000). Cost-effectiveness was investigated by estimating total
costs (including intervention costs and other healthcare resource use costs collected using
patient and caregiver diaries) and total quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated
using a pictorial version of the EQ5D26 questionnaire for an incremental cost-effective-
ness ratio to be calculated
Data collection: baseline, at 1 month and 3 month. Follow-up at 5 and 8 months

Methods
RCT, USA
Participants
Inclusion criteria: at least 6 months poststroke and had single or multiple lesions limited
to the left hemisphere that included the precentral gyrus or underlying white matter
as confirmed by medical records and MRI; standard score greater than 69.92 on the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV (PPVT-IV; Dunn 2007); an ability to consistently
follow one-step commands; scores on the WAB-AQ below the aphasia cutoff of 93.8
(Kertesz1982); (d) right-handedness prior to the stroke, as determined by the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory (Oldfield 1971); and (e) English as their first language.
Exclusion criteria: not eligible for participation in MRI or if they had a history of
head trauma, neurological disorder other than stroke (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease), learning
disability (e.g. dyslexia), psychiatric disorder (e.g. schizophrenia), drug or alcohol abuse,
or chronic medical conditions likely to impair cognition (e.g. renal or hepatic failure)

Interventions
1. Naming therapy with gesture
Intervention: gesture SLT. Literature suggests the advantages of recruitment of right-
hemisphere mechanisms during language recovery in aphasia. Crosson 2007 devised
an intention-based treatment technique that engaged the right hemisphere by shifting
intention and language production mechanisms to homologous right-hemisphere re-
gions. Crosson 2007 defined intention as the ability to select and initiate an action
from many possible competing actions. Because the intentional circuits for volitional
hand movement overlap, those for word generation in the pre-supplementary motor area
(pre-SMA) preceding a naming attempt with a volitional complex left-hand movement
could facilitate picture naming. Materials: prior to treatment, all subjects named a set
of more than 400 black-and-white line drawings of objects and generated members of
120 categories twice. Items missed consistently were selected for treatment, beginning
with the highest frequency items and progressing to lower frequency items until enough
items were identified to construct the counterbalanced treatment lists and probe stimuli.
Specifically, from the set of 400 pictures and 120 categories, 120 pictures and 60 cate-
gories were individually selected for each subject, with the selected picture and category
sets each containing 25% consistently correct and 75% consistently incorrect at pre-
treatment testing. Procedures: trained on both picture naming and category generation.
Phase 1 consisted of treatment sessions 1-10 and focused on the naming of 50 pictures.
Phase 2 consisted of treatment sessions 11-20 and trained subjects on the naming of
50 different pictures. Phase 3 consisted of treatment sessions 21-30 and required the
generation of an exemplar of each of 40 different categories. Naming trials in Phases 1
and 2 consisted of the presentation of a picture on a computer monitor for naming. In
Phase 3, trials consisted of auditory and orthographic presentations of a category name
for which the subject generated 1 category member. For all trials in all phases, a therapist
verified response accuracy. If treatment trials were completed correctly (i.e., a picture was
named correctly or a correct category exemplar was generated), subjects began the next
trial. If an item was not named correctly, the therapist would provide the correct name,
and subjects would then practice saying the correct response. Similarly, if a subject was
unable to generate a member of a category, the therapist would provide an example, and
the subject would practice saying this correct response. This correction procedure was
repeated up to 3 times maximum or until the subject named the item correctly. The

number of times a subject repeated the correct response was not regulated. Each member
of the gesture group initiated each treatment trial with his or her left hand by opening and
reaching into a box and pushing a red button. Second, during each correction procedure,
each member of the gesture group also made a non-meaningful circular gesture with
his or her left hand. Provided by: speech and language therapists. The same therapists
administered both the gesture and the no gesture treatments. Training not reported.
Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face and computer, location not reported. Regimen: treatment
was delivered in 3 phases (10 sessions per phase), with two 1 h treatment sessions per day,
5 d a week, for a total of 30 treatment sessions. The 2 sessions each day were at least half
an hour apart. Total dose = 30 h therapy. Tailoring: yes, naming targets by successful/
unsuccessful attempts on baseline measure. During therapy correction and prompt and
advancement through levels based on patient ability. Modification: not reported.Adher-
ence: therapist monitored patient’s protocol adherence. For treatment sessions a research
assistant-who was trained in both treatments and who was not administering treatment
at any of the sites-evaluated 1 session per treatment phase (i.e., once a week) per subject
for correct delivery of the assigned treatment and subsequent correction procedures
2. SLT
Intervention: SLT. Usual care. Materials: described above. Procedures: trained on both
picture naming and category generation. Phase 1 to Phase 3 treatment sessions described
above. For all trials in all phases, a therapist verified response accuracy, as described above.
For the no gesture group, a therapist pushed a button to initiate each treatment trial.
No hand movement was required by the participant during the correction procedure.
Provided by: speech and language therapists. The same therapists administered both
the gesture and the no gesture treatments. Training not reported. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-
to-face and computer, location not reported. Regimen: treatment was delivered in 3
phases (10 sessions per phase), with two 1 h treatment sessions per day, 5 d a week, for a
total of 30 treatment sessions. The 2 sessions each day were at least half an hour apart.
Total dose = 30 h therapy. Tailoring: yes, naming targets by successful/unsuccessful
attempts on baseline measure. During therapy correction and prompt and advancement
through levels based on patient ability. Modification: not reported. Adherence: therapist
monitored patient’s protocol adherence. For treatment sessions a research assistant-who
was trained in both treatments and who was not administering treatment at any of the
sites-evaluated 1 session per treatment phase (i.e., once a week) per subject for correct
delivery of the assigned treatment and subsequent correction procedures

Interventions
1. Functional SLT
Intervention: functional SLT. Disability-based, context-trained. Activity based, personal
relevance emphasised. Establish compensatory strategies based on clients strengths to
achieve targeted task. Materials: roleplay scripts, various actual catalogues, practice order
forms, phone, credit cars, pen/paper, cue cards as individualised for each client. Proce-
dures: roleplays of functional tasks, establish compensatory strategies (practice ordering
by telephone, self generate individualised strategies). Use different strategies and modal-
ities to achieve goal/task. Provided by: speech and language therapist trained in both
treatment approaches. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, location not reported. Regimen:
20 h weekly for 5 weeks. Total dose = 100 h of therapy. Tailoring: materials individ-
ualised. Modification: materials individualised. Adherence: reviewed for adherence to
allocated intervention.
2. Conventional SLT

proach. Materials: stimulus items from targeted vocabulary that combine both picture
and written words. Pictured stimuli for auditory comprehension tasks. Procedures: im-
pairment-based, skill trained, remediating naming deficit areas using cueing hierarchies
using various modalities. Centred on targeted dimensions of performance (e.g. accuracy,
speed or response, nature of required cueing). Provided by: speech and language thera-
pists trained in both treatment approaches. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, location not
reported. Regimen: 20 h weekly over 5 weeks. Total dose = 100 h therapy. Tailoring:

stimulation approach. Targeting maximised interaction within challenging tasks. Mate-
rials: 32 activities, 232 sequentially arranged visual matching and reading activities from
2-5 choices. Text characters (letters, numbers, symbols). No pictures. Stimulus in centre
of top third of screen. Response choices simultaneously displayed bottom half of screen.
Tasks sequential in hierarchy of difficulty. 10 matching activities, 22 reading comprehen-
sion tasks with 8 difficulty levels. 4 comprehension tasks had 2 difficulty levels. Matching
activities were perceptual visual matching to familiarise patient with software. Reading
comprehension stimuli (letters numbers, words, phrases and sentences). Procedures:
visual matching and reading comprehension tasks. Speech and language therapist famil-
iarised patient with computer, programme and tasks. Demonstrated response modes.
Provided by: 4 therapists but minimal involvement. Supportive functions but not in
room. Delivery: computer-facilitated; 1-to-1; SLT dept (2 occasionally at home with
support; not clear which group). Regimen (frequency (sessions weekly) x duration)
: 3 h weekly for 26 weeks. Total dose = 78 h therapy. Tailoring: 4 participants needed
additional cues during 1 or more sessions. Each task had a baseline set of 20 tasks. If
criterion performance of 80% correct in 3 consecutive baseline tasks then programme
proceeded to next task. Typically, movement up and down training hierarchy was con-
trolled automatically by the programme. Modification: each task had a baseline set of
20 tasks. If criterion performance of 80% correct in 3 consecutive baseline tasks then
programme proceeded to next task. If criterion performance not reached on baseline
then therapist used Editor option to divide baseline 20 items into 2 sets of 10 items. Ad-
herence: therapist monitored attendance and performance. Overall report - participants
completed mean of 76.14 tasks (range 1-167) after computerised treatment. 19 or 21
participants completed at least 40 tasks

Interventions
1. Programmed instruction + operant training + SLT
Intervention: “programmed instruction with operant training and SLT”. Useful and
effective methods that merit further investigation in aphasia intervention. SLT: aim
of improving communication ability. Materials: electric board graded language tasks.
Matching letters, cards with object names or line drawings of objects. Increasing difficulty
based on frequency of use of the word. 13 sets of 6 object names in graded order of
difficulty. SLT not reported. Procedures: cards arranged in 13 sets of 6 cards for both
names and pictures. Sets representing words of decreasing frequency of occurrence in
spoken English. Board lights in response to correct answer plus therapist provides verbal
praise; for incorrect answers, there is no light response, therapist shakes head and provides

Group 1: 21 participants (7 triads)
Group 2: 9 participants (3 triads)
Each triad comprised 1 person with aphasia, 1 caregiver, 1 communication partner
Details of participants are shown in Table 1
Interventions
1. Functionally-based SLT
Intervention: “Communication partners”. Aims to restore a sense of purpose, direction
and control to daily life for both patient and caregiver. A programme aimed at enhancing
communication and well-being in settings where patient and caregiver live and choose to
interact. The plan underscores the viability of communication with a naive normal adult
while concurrently strengthening more active, self determined and controlled role in
daily life. Increased participation in life provides a much richer experiential base for sub-
sequent communication between caregiver and patient. Life experience provides some-
thing to talk about. Rejuvenating the self is shown to be at the core of communication
dysfunction. Materials: individualised plausible situations Procedures: 2 Phases; phase
A: 6 week long. Establishing effective communication strategies between partner and
person with aphasia. phase B: 14 weeks of activities of participant choice. Provided by:
community volunteer communication partner. Protocol, examples. Delivery: face-to-
face; triad (patient, volunteer, caregiver); at home or in community and 1 session, bridge
between phase A and phase B, in clinic. Regimen: phase A: 1-1.5 h twice weekly for 6
weeks; phase B: 1-2 h session (clinic) plus 2-4 h session (community) once weekly for 14
weeks. Total dose = not reported, estimated as phase A: 18 h, phase B: up to 110-128 h

Interventions
1. Daily language rehabilitation
Intervention: SLT. Daily language rehab leads to improved language recovery and
improved functional correlates, brain plasticity. Materials: Snodgrass and Vanderwart
(1980) set (Snodgrass 1980). Procedures: mainly focusing on verbal comprehension
and lexical retrieval. In each session, after a short and simple dialogue with the patient,
covering his mood and status, as well as any relevant episodes occurred during the day,
a naming task was usually conducted, where patients had to spontaneously name items
taken from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) set (Snodgrass 1980). In the case of
failure, all the facilitations were given. Single word as well as sentence comprehension
was also treated with the help of available common objects and objects pictures. A semi-
structured rehabilitation setting was used, instead of a rigidly predetermined set of tasks
identical for all the subjects, due to the clinical condition of the acute phase and the
location (the stroke unit) where the rehabilitation was conducted. Generally, a stimula-
tion of the impaired linguistic functions was conducted by the therapist, according to
the deficits shown by the AAT. Provided by: speech and language therapists. Training
not reported. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face; location not reported. Regimen: 1 h ses-
sion per day, for 5 d per week for 2 weeks. Total dose = 10 h therapy. Tailoring: yes.
Modification: yes. Adherence: not reported.
2. No SLT
Intervention: no SLT. As per usual clinical practice in that centre. But all exposed to the
natural speech environment of people they were visited, and this could be considered an
unstructured language therapy. Materials: none. Procedures: none. Provided by: none.
Delivery: none. Regimen: none. Tailoring: none. Modification: none. Adherence:
none.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT)
Secondary outcomes: AAT subtests of repetition, naming, reading, writing, oral, and
written comprehension; a 50-item version of the Token test; and a semi-quantitative
scoring of several aspects of spontaneous speech (communicative ability, articulation and
prosody, automatic speech, semantic, phonemic, and syntactic structure)
Data collection: baseline (T1: mean (SD), 2.2 (1.3) d after stroke), 2 weeks poststroke
(T2: 16.2 (1.3) d after stroke). Follow-up 6 months (T3: 190.0 (25.5) d after stroke)

Interventions
1. Volunteer-facilitated SLT
Intervention: “volunteer-facilitated SLT”. Efficient resource use. Materials: volunteers
given basic background to aphasia, standard items of SLT equipment, initial and ongoing
support and advice, encouraged to use initiative and ingenuity in developing therapeutic
techniques. Procedures: SLT provided explanations to volunteers of nature of patient’s
disability, and test results indicated treatment focus with verbal, gestural and graphic
tasks determining treatment strategy. Provided by: recruited volunteers (via newspapers,
word of mouth). Included housewives, students, secretaries, retired nurse, postman. All
passed interview. Introductory course (stroke, aphasia) and film. Each patient assigned
4 volunteers for 4 home visits weekly. Delivery: face-to-face; 1-to-1 and group; home
(group sessions in rehab centre). Regimen: 4 home visits weekly plus group sessions for
a mean of 20.8 (SD 13.5; range 2-46) weeks. Varied. Participants remained in trial until
2 successful estimations on PICA showed no appreciable improvement, they requested
withdrawal, or until end of trial in December 1978. Participants who plateaued exited
trial and counted as successes. Tailoring: individualised therapy based on PICA results.
Modification: not reported. Adherence: attendance recorded by therapists and volun-
teers. Not all documentation available at study end. 2 from volunteer group failed to
complete treatment programme and excluded from analyses
2. Conventional SLT
Intervention: conventional SLT. Materials: chosen by speech and language therapist (no
details). Procedures: as provided by qualified speech and language therapist. Provided
by: speech and language therapist. Delivery: face-to-face; 1-to-1 and group; hospital.
Regimen: 45 min session 3-5 times weekly plus group sessions for a mean of 37.13 (SD
21.89; range 7 to 84) weeks. But varied, participants remained in trial until 2 successful
estimations on PICA showed no appreciable improvement, they requested withdrawal
or until end of trial. Participants who plateaued exited trial and counted as successes.

Interventions
1. MIT
Intervention: MIT. Critical role of rhythm and formulaic language in MIT contribu-
tion of the right hemisphere is still not reported: some report increased right hemisphere
activation related to MIT success. Others suggest that MIT-induced language recovery
is related to reactivation of left perilesional regions. Materials: set of utterances of in-
creasing complexity to be trained. The first utterances in frequent use in daily life com-
munication (e.g. “coffee please”). Later the utterances became longer, more complex,
and less frequent in daily life. In addition, the patient composed a set of self chosen
utterances that were functionally relevant to them (e.g. relating to hobbies). Home prac-
tice included - iPod application containing short videos of a mouth singing the target

utterances; patients could sing along with the video or repeat the utterance afterwards.
Procedures: MIT following the American manual. The patient and the therapist sang
short utterances together, while handtapping the rhythm. Gradually, the support from
the therapist decreased and singing was replaced by speaking. A minimum of 50% of the
therapy time was spent on the utterances provided. Provided by: speech and language
therapists experienced in language rehabilitation. All trained to deliver MIT according
to protocol. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered in the rehabilitation centre or nurs-
ing home with rehabilitation facilities. Regimen: 6 weeks; 5 h/week (minimum face-
to-face time 3 h/week). Total dose = 30 h of therapy. Tailoring: yes, based on selection
of functionally relevant target utterances. Modification: yes, as above. Adherence: PI
contacted the speech and language therapists at least once a week and asked them about
what they were doing during therapy, patient acceptability, and if they had any questions
or encountered problems. Speech and language therapists also were free to contact the
PI whenever they had questions
2. Control SLT
Intervention: control SLT. Not aiming at language production. Used linguistic tasks of-
ten trained in severe nonfluent aphasia (e.g. written language production, language com-
prehension, and nonverbal communication strategies). Materials: home assignments in-
cluded paper-and-pencil tasks (e.g. written sentence completion, word-picture matching,
and word categorising tasks). Procedures: did not emphasise spoken output. Focused on
other linguistic modalities usually trained in severe nonfluent aphasia (writing, language
comprehension, nonverbal communication strategies). Spoken output was not discour-
aged but the therapists did not provide feedback regarding patients’ verbal production
and offered no structural training of language production. Provided by: speech and
language therapists. Therapists delivering the control SLT received a protocol of what
was permitted and what was not, as well as a manual containing practice materials and
references that could be used. PI also helped create tailor-made tasks for a specific patient.
Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered in the rehabilitation centre or nursing home
with rehabilitation facilities. Regimen: 6 weeks; 5 h/week (minimum face-to-face time 3
h/week). Total dose = 30 h of therapy. Tailoring: individualised therapy Modification:
not reported. Adherence: PI contacted the speech and language therapists at least once a
week, and asked them about what they were doing during therapy, patient acceptability,
and if they had any questions or encountered problems. Speech and language therapists
also were free to contact the PI whenever they had questions
Outcomes

Interventions
1. Narrative
Intervention: NARNIA. Therapy directly targets discourse organisation to support ear-
lier levels of language production and improve discourse production. Materials: narra-
tive production using published picture sequences (Toomey’s ’Sequence Plus’, 1992) fo-
cusing initially on identifying the main event(s), production of relevant verb and nouns
and creating a complete argument structure. Functionally relevant materials were chosen
e.g. planning a holiday, shaving. A framework for narrative discourse, based on story
grammar, was introduced, and the sentences organised around “setting the scene” (the
beginning), “the events taking place” (the middle), and “concluding the story” (the end)
. Following sucess in use of the narrative framework, other discourse genre frameworks
(recount, procedure and exposition) were used. Mind-mapping was used to populate
discourse frameworks and link ideas, events and words which in turn supported dis-
course structre and organisation. Use of visual prompts was gradually decreased as ther-
apy progressed. Some pictorial resources were used to stimulate opinions (e.g. Skills for
Daily Living: Social Behaviour, Speechmark, 2002), most topics were prompted from
personal experiences. Procedures: metalinguistic approach to increase awareness of both
sentence and discourse structure, at all times focusing attention on the word, sentence
and discourse levels. Drew on developmental frameworks for discourse production used
in the pedagogy of oral and written language. Word, sentence and discourse levels were
integrated to increase metalinguistic awareness of specific microstructure elements of
language, followed by frameworks for macrostructure that were used to scaffold the pro-
duction of discourse across a range of everyday discourse genres. Once the principles of
coherence were in place, cohesive devices were targeted. Self evaluation of performance
was employed after each attempt using a visual scale that required self-monitoring of
performance on 7 different indices including success at finding nouns and verbs, to com-
pleting sentences, to structural components of the discourse sample, and overall clarity
of the sample. Provided by: 2 speech and language therapists. Speech and language ther-
apist professional and trial training. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered predomi-
nantly within a clinical setting as most participants were inpatients at a rehabilitation
hospital or attended outpatient services. In some instances, sessions were delivered in
the participant’s home. Regimen: 20 individual treatment sessions delivered, with few
exceptions, 4 times weekly, over 5 weeks. Total dose = 20 h of therapy. In a small number
of cases, participants could not commit to 4 x weekly sessions (over 5 weeks). Sessions
were then spread over a longer period of time, e.g. 20 sessions delivered 3 times weekly
over a (nearly) 7 week period. Tailoring: yes. Modification: the protocol was adhered to
for each participant. Minor variations were permitted in delivery according to individ-
ual differences, e.g. more prompts could be provided in the presence of comprehension

difficulties, greater elaboration of topics could be encouraged when participants were
less severe to maintain motivation, visual templates could be faded out more quickly if
participants showed a disinclination to them, but all core elements of the protocol were
included. Adherence: regular discussion and recording a proportion of sessions on video
to monitor adherence to the treatment protocol. Actual adherence: no instances of non-
adherence were noted in the sessions reviewed. The clinicians engaged in regular and
informal reflection of delivery of the intervention. Client rating forms on their perfor-
mance on all core elements of the protocol from each session that demonstrated that all
components of the protocol had been focused on
2. Conventional SLT
Intervention: conventional SLT. Therapy focusing on training specific deficits. Mate-
rials: any SLT routinely used in clinical practice. Access to all assessment data with the
exception of the Curtin University Discourse Protocol (CUDP) data. Procedures: based
on usual practice procedures around goal setting - exercises including sentence comple-
tion, improving patients’ retrieval of words, learning sentence patterns, conversation on
current topics, listening, to words, and repeating and following instructions. The thera-
pist initiated the communicative activities. The aimed to target several modes of commu-
nication. Participants were permitted to use any communication mode, including non-
verbal communication. aimed to improve word or sentence production, reading, writing
or more functional activities that frequently drew on several domains. Discourse could
be included in usual care as a context for generalisation of therapy targets. Provided by:
speech and language therapists. Training not reported. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face,
delivered predominantly within a clinical setting as most participants were inpatients at
a rehabilitation hospital or attended outpatient services. In some instances, sessions were
delivered in the participant’s home. Regimen: 20 individual treatment sessions delivered,
with few exceptions, 4 times weekly, over 5 weeks. Total dose = 20 h of therapy. In a
small number of cases, participants could not commit to 4 x weekly sessions (over 5
weeks). Sessions were then spread over a longer period of time, e.g. 20 sessions delivered
3 times weekly over a (nearly) 7-week period.Tailoring: yes, individualised to patient
needs. Modification: the protocol was adhered to for each participant. Minor variations
were permitted in delivery according to individual differences, e.g. more prompts could
be provided in the presence of comprehension difficulties, greater elaboration of topics
could be encouraged when participants were less severe to maintain motivation, visual
templates could be faded out more quickly if participants showed a disinclination to
them, but all core elements of the protocol were included. Adherence: regular discussion
and recording a proportion of sessions on video to monitor adherence to the treatment
protocol. Actual adherence: no instances of non-adherence were noted in the sessions
reviewed. The clinicians engaged in regular and informal reflection of delivery of the
intervention. Client rating forms on their performance on all core elements of the pro-

sentences. Canonical and non-canonical sentences were also closely matched. (Sample of
treatment protocol provided Rochon 2005). Materials: stimuli came from large sentence
bank of > 500 semantically reversible sentences. 144 sentences in treatment phase. Stim-
uli to elicit sentences were colour photos of actors clearly depicting action taken against
a plain backdrop. 2 small black/white icons used to reinforce difference between agent/
theme in target sentence. 6 sets of 24 sentences. Random order of presentation. Proce-
dures: each session 12 sentences levels 1-2 and 24 at levels 3-4. Provided by: trained
RA. Delivery: face-to-face; 1-to-1; location not reported. Regimen: 1-h session twice
weekly for approximately 2.5 months. Total dose (estimated) = 22 h therapy. Tailoring:
not reported. Modification: not reported. Adherence: no dropouts.
2. Social support
Intervention: attention “control intervention”. Materials: none. Narrative re-telling task
Rochon 1994. Procedures: unstructured conversation about current events. Narrative
retelling task on alternate sessions. Provided by: trained RA Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-
face, location not reported. Regimen: 1 h session twice weekly for approximately 2.5
months. Total dose (estimated) = 22 h therapy. Tailoring: not reported. Modification:
not reported. Adherence: no dropouts.
Outcomes
Outcomes: trained sentence structures: active, subject cleft, assive, object cleft; CHSPT;
Picture Description and Structure Modeling Test; narrative task: mean length of utter-
ance, percentage words in sentences, percentage well-formed words, sentence elaboration
index; PCB (reversible sentences); Picture Comprehension Test
Social support and stimulation group also participated in between level probes
Data collection: baseline, end of treatment and 4-week follow-up
Notes
Only 1 Group 1 participant entered all 4 levels; 1 only entered levels 1 and 2 (did not
need levels 3 to 4); 1 participant entered levels 1, 2 and 4

Methods
RCT, Germany
Participants
Inclusioncriteria:first-everstroke with aphasiainthe sub-acute stage defined astime since
lesion onset from 1 to 4 months poststroke. Aphasia as per Aachener Aphasia Test (AAT).
All patientshadtounderstandthe rulesof the game forthe CIATgroup. Thisrequirement
was assessed by a test game. If the patients satisfied the criteria of understanding the aim
of the game, naming of items with therapeutic help and identifying 1 of 4 presented
cards with object drawings, they were included in the study. All participants were native
German speakers. Pre-morbid handedness was assessed with the Edinburgh Handedness
Inventory
Exclusion criteria: residual aphasia, dysarthria (scale values 0-3, dysarthria rating scale10)
and apraxia of speech
Group 1: 50 participants
Group 2: 50 participants
Details of participants are shown in Table 1
Interventions
1. Constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT)
Intervention: CIAT. Avoiding learned non-use phenomenon. Communication in verbal
format has to be engaged with, thus forcing practice. Materials: therapeutic language
games using card-based object drawings, photos of everyday situations. Written language
tasks (Meinzer 2005b). Visual barrier also used. Procedures: therapeutic language games.
Massed practice, shaping and constraint of non-verbal strategies. Where verbal skills
good, writing to single word dictation used. Progressive degrees of difficulty built in.
Also included 2 non-aphasic patients from rehab centre in the group as groups members
and ’able communicators’. Groups established of 4-6 patients plus speech therapist and 2
patients without aphasia (from the medical professional rehabilitation team). No home
practice in the in the CIAT setting, but patients and relatives of both groups received
professional advice. Provided by: speech and language therapist professional. Delivery:
group, face-to-face with visual barrier between group members so they could not see
each others’ hands/cards, local rehab centre. Regimen: 2 h of training over 15 d. Total
dose = 30 h of therapy. Tailoring: yes. The rules of communication were formulated,
individualised for each participant and were gradually increased. The therapist provided
as much cueing as necessary, depending on the level of each participant’s verbal ability, for
a successful response. Modification: yes, individualised to patient needs. After discharge

from research programme continued to receive outpatient treatment at a comparable
intensity level at an average of 1.9 h per week. Adherence: progressive difficulty, addition
of writing tasks. Monitored
2. Conventional SLT
Intervention: conventional SLT. Usual care. Materials: not reported Procedures: stan-
dard SLT ’focused on training specific deficits’ e.g. sentence completion, improving pa-
tients’ retrieval of words, learning sentence patterns, conversation on current topics, lis-
tening to words, and repeating and following instructions. The therapist initiated the
communicative activities. The interventions aimed to target several modes of communi-
cation. Provided by: speech and language therapists. Training not reported. Delivery:
1-to-1, face-to-face, local rehab centre. Regimen: 2 h of training over 15 d. Total dose
= 30 h of therapy. Tailoring: yes. Modification: yes, individualised to patient needs.
After discharge from research programme continued to receive outpatient treatment at
a comparable intensity level at an average of 2.13 h per week. Adherence: progressive
difficulty, addition of writing tasks. Monitored

Interventions
1. Task Specific Naming SLT
Intervention: task-specific SLT. Materials: therapy equipment for the practice of nam-
ing was formed by half the number of items of the naming test. The 40 images were
distributed as follows: 10 animals, 10 objects from the house, 10 objects without any re-
lation to each other and 10 action verbs. The therapy material for practicing the sentence
making also contained half of the number of items that was used for the test for ’making
sentences’. The 15 training sentences had the following structure: 3 sentences NP-V,
NP-5 sentences V-NP
, and NP-7 sentences V-PP
. Procedures: systematic tracking of a
number of steps. The steps that must be carried out by the practitioner are dependent
on the response of the patient. This response consists of a description (B), a semantic
(C) or a phonological paraphasia (D), the therapist responds with cues as respectively:
”Yes, it is to sleep in, so ..“ (bed) , ”It’s not a table, but a ...?“ (chair), or ”It’s not unicorn,
but ..?“ (squirrel). If the patient after these cues did not give the right response, or no
response (A), then the patient will be prompted for the initial sound of the target word.
If the patient does not know the initial sound, then this is offered by the therapist. In the
next step, the patient is invited to designate the target word on a map, where there are 4
words in large letters (the target word, a semantically related word, a phonetic-cognate
and non-cognate) are presented. The final step in the practice consists of the repetition
of the intended word. For the naming task: for each picture, the patient is first given
the opportunity to produce the appropriate sentence. When the patient fails, the patient
is helped depending on the response. The patient is helped with questions like, ”Who
is this? ’(e.g. a girl), “What is she doing? ”(e.g. letter) and “What do they write?” (e.g.
letter). After the lack of proper response to any of these questions, the answer is always
offered by the therapist. When the patient, despite these cues, is not able to produce
the correct sense, the whole sentence is offered, which the patient has to repeat. In each
therapy session, the 15 items were offered once. Provided by: phase 1: research speech
and language therapists, phase 2: participant’s own speech and language therapist De-
livery: 1-to-1, face-to-face, location not reported. Regimen: phase 1: 1 h twice weekly
for 6 weeks. Phase 2: 3 weeks ’free therapy’. Tailoring: individualised. Modification:

2. Conventional SLT
Intervention: general stimulation speech and language therapy especially expressive
tasks. Materials: not reported.Procedures: spontaneous language (approximately 15
minutes), repeating words (approximately 10 minutes), reading out sentences (about 10
minutes), and sentence construction (about 15 minutes). With the exception of spon-
taneous speech, the emphasis in all these tasks was on repeated exposure to the items. If
the patient was not able to produce the correct response, the correct response was given
by the therapist, and the patient repeated the response. The therapy material was the
same for every patient. Provided by: speech and language therapist Delivery: 1-to-1,
face-to-face, location not reported. Regimen: not reported but continued for 9 weeks.

Interventions
1. CIAT
Intervention: CIAT. Based on principles of constraint induced movement therapy and
neuroplasticity, provision of intensive therapy and massed practice. CIAT also provides
pragmatically communicative therapeutic context thus communicative effectiveness is
maximised and learned non-use of expressive language minimised. Materials: target ma-
terials designed to shape individuals’ language production with rules and reinforcement
contingencies used to extend expressive output. The picture stimuli within each set of
cards accommodated a verbal response ranging from single words to sentences. Increased
target description, extended phrasal and clausal structures and politeness markers were
encouraged to achieve increased utterance complexity and appropriateness according
153

to each player’s ability. The therapist provided language support as required to each
player according to their individual needs. This was established at initial assessment and
monitored and adjusted in response to the individual’s performance within the treat-
ment sessions. Full treatment protocol is available. Procedures: on CIAT as outlined by
Pulvermuller 2001. Due to the early nature of the intervention, therapy was modified
from the original 3 h per day to 1 h per day. Therapy was conducted by 1 speech patholo-
gist with groups of 2-4 people with aphasia playing CIAT. The therapy task of CIAT was
a request and response language game in which participants aimed to collect the highest
number of pairs of picture cards. Participants were constrained to interact through verbal
production only. Sitting around a table, each participant had a visual barrier preventing
them from seeing the cards of other group members, while allowing them to see and hear
each other. Shielded by the screen, participants could use self cued gesture to facilitate
their verbal production. Participants took turns to try to obtain a card from another
player by verbally requesting a card. Each request prompted a verbal response such as
confirmation, clarification or negation. Provided by: 8 speech and language therapists.
Range of experience (1-23 years), All had 3 h of therapy training prior to delivery of
therapy in trial. Delivery: group, face-to-face, acute or rehab hospitals. Regimen: 45-60
minutes, 5 d a week for 20 sessions over 5 weeks. Total dose = 15-20 h therapy. Tailor-
ing: increased target description, extended phrasal and clausal structures and politeness
markers were encouraged to achieve increased utterance complexity and appropriateness
according to each player’s ability. The therapist provided language support as required
to each player according to their individual needs. This was established at initial assess-
ment and monitored and adjusted in response to the individual’s performance within the
treatment sessions. Modification: (as described in Tailoring). Adherence: not reported
2. Conventional SLT
Intervention: conventional SLT. Usual care. Materials: Semantic Feature Therapy
(Boyle 1995), Cued Naming Therapy (Nettleton 1991), Lexical Semantic (BOX) Ther-
apy (Visch-Brink 1997), Mapping Therapy (Schwartz 1994), and Phonological Feature
Mapping (Raymer 1993). The therapies were administered following the respective pub-
lished instructions. Participants received either 1 therapy or a combination of therapy
types as appropriate. Procedures: participants in this therapy arm received an individu-
alised programme tailored to meet their needs. Using the individual’s initial assessment
results to inform their decision making, the treating therapist selected the appropriate
therapy from a range of approaches. Provided by: 8 speech and language therapists.
Range of experience (1-23 years), All had 3 h of therapy training prior to delivery of
therapy in trial. Delivery: 1-to-1, face-to-face. Acute or rehab hospitals. Regimen: 45-
60 minutes, 5 d a week for 20 sessions over 5 weeks. Total dose = 15-20 h therapy.
Tailoring: yes, individualised programme tailored to meet individual patient needs. Ini-
tial assessment results informed decision making and selection of appropriate therapy.
Modification: as therapy progressed based on individual monitoring of patient and pro-
gression through treatment hierarchies accordingly. Adherence: not reported

Participants
Inclusion criteria: adult, isolated first stroke, imaging confirmed left hemisphere stroke,
moderate fluent aphasia with phonological and semantic deficits (based on (lang) Sta-
nine norms of Token test; (semantic) AAT comprehension; Verbal Semantic Association
Test; PALPA Synonym Judgement and Semantic Word Association of low imageability
words, (phonological) AAT Repetition, PALPA Nonword Repetition and Auditory Lex-
ical Decision), also had to score above the 75th percentile on Raven’s Coloured Progres-
sive Matrices (Raven 1976) (visuoperceptual problem solving). by means of a standard
handedness inventory (Oldfield 1971)
Exclusion criteria: participation in other treatment programme, additional neurological
or psychiatric disorder, and patients with severe perceptual, additional speech (e.g. verbal
apraxia), or cognitive deficits evidenced by formal neuropsychological testing
Group 1: 5 participants
Group 2: 4 participants
Details of participants are shown in Table 1
Interventions
1. Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy
Intervention: CIAT. Intensive constraint-based intervention thought to be effective.
Materials: CIAT treatment is a communication-based group interaction by means of
communicative card games. The picture cards contain objects of high as well as low
frequent words, black-and-white line drawings as well as colored pictures, pictures of
objects as well as action cards, and pictures with minimal pairs (e.g. sock and rock)
based on Maher 2006, Meinzer 2005b, Meinzer 2007, Pulvermuller 2001. Patients were
allowed to produce gestures in order to facilitate verbal output, but their gestures were
hidden from the other participants by a 40 cm high screen between the patient and the
other participants. Procedures: dual card game was used (e.g. Maher 2006). Participants
dealt cards from a set of 32-42 coloured cards (i.e., 16-21 pairs of identical cards) per
45 min treatments. They take turns either requesting an identical card from the other
participant (4 to 6 cards per participant) or responding to that request. Constraints were
along 3 dimensions: difficulty of the material; the rules of the game, as indicated by
verbal instruction and shaping; and reinforcement contingencies (Pulvermuller 2001).
Provided by: 7 trained speech language therapy students (3rd year professional bachelor
level). Students under supervision of 6 experienced and professionally trained speech
and language therapists. Students were trained according to the training protocol of lay

people designed by Meinzer 2007. The speech and language therapists had been given
detailedinstructionsbymeansof a2h presentation in which the studywaspresented. The
basic principles of BOX and CIAT were introduced, and the materials, procedures, and
approaches of both types of intervention were carefully explained. In addition, students
were given a 1 h practical training session. Instruction sessions contained illustrative
video materials. The students and therapists were given a detailed manual with explicit
guidelines about CIAT and BOX. Delivery: group, face-to-face, 1 of 4 hospital settings
in the Netherlands. Regimen: 2-3 h sessions per day on 9 or 10 consecutive working
days (total mean duration ± SD = 1195 ± 59, pauses not included). Each session was
interrupted by 2 breaks of 10 to 15 min. Tailoring: daily records were used for a daily
evaluation and critical assessment of each session in order to adjust individual or group
task difficulty for the next session. Modification: yes, adjusted to individual or group
task difficulty for the next session. Adherence: students and therapists kept a detailed
daily record of each intervention, specifying the presence of participants and therapists,
the duration of the training in minutes, and the training materials used. Actual adherence
or fidelity to treatment not reported
2. BOX
Intervention: Semantic SLT. A Dutch drill-based lexical-semantic treatment therapy
programme (Visch-Brink 2001). Materials: focuses on the interpretation of written
words,sentences, andtexts(alsowith anauditorypresentation bythe speech andlanguage
therapist if required). Procedures: BOX contains a variety of semantic decision tasks
aimed at enhancing semantic processing. 8 different types of exercises within each task,
and the patient is required to deny or confirm the semantic relationship between (written
and auditorily presented) content words, either presented separately or within the context
of a sentence or text. Word choice, number of distractors, semantic relatedness, and
ambiguity were taken into account in creating the different levels of difficulty (Visch-
Brink 1997). The patients in the BOX group worked alternatively by themselves on
worksheets and with the therapist according to a therapy schedule (see Table 2), which
allowed 1 therapist to supervise 2 patients. For example, on the first day, patient 1 started
with 30 min of therapy (Therapy Schedule BOX 1) whereas patient 2 began with a 30
min individual working session (Therapy Schedule BOX 2). The next day, participants
swapped therapy schedules. Patients were able to adjust their personal level of difficulty.
In order to apply the shaping principle, therapists monitored performance and solicited
patient feedback to ensure that patients were challenged but not overly frustrated. Pro-
vided by: 7 trained speech language therapy students (3rd year professional bachelor
level). Students under supervision of 6 experienced and professionally trained speech and
language therapists. Students were trained according to the training protocol of laypeople
designed by Meinzer 2007. The speech and language therapists had been given detailed
instructions by means of a 2 h presentation in which the study was presented. The ba-
sic principles of BOX and CIAT were introduced, and the materials, procedures, and
approaches of both types of intervention were carefully explained. In addition, students
were given a 1 h practical training session. Instruction sessions contained illustrative
video materials. The students and therapists were given a detailed manual with explicit
guidelines about CIAT and BOX. Delivery: independent practice and 1-to-1, face-to-
face, 1 of 4 hospital settings in the Netherlands. Regimen: 2-3 h sessions per day on 9
or 10 consecutive working days (total mean duration ± SD = 1150 ± 69 min, pauses
not included). Each session was interrupted by 2 breaks of 10 to 15 min. Tailoring:
daily records were used for a daily evaluation and critical assessment of each session in

adjusted to individual or group task difficulty for the next session. Adherence: students
and therapists kept a detailed daily record of each intervention, specifying the presence
of participants and therapists, the duration of the training in minutes, and the training
materials used. Actual adherence or fidelity to treatment not reported
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test
Secondary outcomes: AAT, BNT, PALPA, SAT, ANELT CETI. Particpants also com-
pleted a written nonstandardised questionnaire (6 questions on a 7-point Likert rating
scale) regarding their satisfaction. Questions were about the satisfaction of participation,
whether or not they would participate a second time, the feasibility and the pleasantness
of the intensive treatment, and the preference of an intensive treatment above a nonin-
tensive treatment
Data collection: pretreatment and 1 week after treatment

Interventions
1. Remote telerehab
Intervention: telerehab SLT. Telerehabilitation enables patients to “access remote reha-
bilitation services in their own homes, typically by using internet video conferencing
technologies. There are efficiency savings for both patients and service providers, mainly
because the need to travel is eliminated. Such savings are particularly relevant in the
context of stroke rehabilitation, where there are high levels of unmet need, and where
demands on services are likely to increase”. Materials: standard protocol, manualised
therapy. Participants had workshop comprising pictures of their target words. Proce-
dures: 50 words each targeted at least once per session. The therapist worked with a
corresponding book, which also delineated the tasks and cues that were to be used with
each word. The therapy tasks were as follows. semantic verification: the therapist pointed
to the target picture and asked 2 yes/no questions about the properties of the item (e.g.
for lemon: “Can you squeeze it?”; “Is it sweet?”); picture naming: the therapist pointed
to the picture and asked the participant to name it. If the participant was successful, they
were asked to repeat the word 3 times. If the participant was unable to name the item the
therapist offered the following cues (in the given order): semantic cue (e.g. for lemon:
“We eat it with sugar on pancakes”), sentence or phrase completion cue (e.g. “sour as a
…” lemon), first phoneme (sound) cue (“it begins with /l/”), first syllable cue (“It begins
with /l/”), whole word for repetition. Once the word was produced, the participant was
asked to repeat it 3 times. If they were unable to say it, the therapist repeated the word
3 times. Provided by: speech and language therapist. Therapist training not reported.
Participants and partners had at least 1 technology training session and a simple written
and pictorial instructions. Delivery: FaceTime via iPad (or in 1 case via Skype and PC)
and use of workbook; 1-to-1 (with partner support) delivered at home. Regimen: 1 h
sessions of therapy delivered twice a week over 4 weeks.Total dose = 8 h. Tailoring: yes.

dures: 50 words each targeted at least once per session. The therapist worked with a
corresponding book, which also delineated the tasks and cues that were to be used with
each word. The therapy tasks were as follows: semantic verification: the therapist pointed
to the target picture and asked 2 yes/no questions about the properties of the item (e.g.
for lemon: “Can you squeeze it?”; “Is it sweet?”); picture naming: the therapist pointed
to the picture and asked the participant to name it. If the participant was successful, they
were asked to repeat the word 3 times. If the participant was unable to name the item the
therapist offered the following cues (in the given order): semantic cue (e.g. for lemon:
“We eat it with sugar on pancakes”), sentence or phrase completion cue (e.g. “sour as a
…” lemon), first phoneme (sound) cue (“it begins with /l/”), first syllable cue (“It begins
with /l/”), whole word for repetition. Once the word was produced, the participant was
asked to repeat it 3 times. If they were unable to say it, the therapist repeated the word
3 times. Provided by: speech and language therapist. Therapist training not reported.
Participants and partners had at least 1 technology training session and a simple written
and pictorial instructions. Delivery: FaceTime via iPad (or in 1 case via Skype and PC)
and use of workbook; 1-to-1 (with partner support) delivered at home. Regimen: 1 h
sessions of therapy delivered twice a week over 4 weeks.Total dose = 8 h. Tailoring: yes.
Degree of difficulty and self administered practice. Modification: yes. Degree of diffi-
culty and self administered practice. Adherence: monitored attendance and intervention
fidelity. Of those randomised, no sessions missed
2. Teleconference-supported conversation
Intervention: social support. Attention control. Materials: none. Procedures: conversa-
tional support techniques from trained SLT students. Provided by: speech and language
therapy students. Received 1/2 day training session in supported conversation techniques

Outcomes
Primary outcomes: feasibility issues, spoken picture naming (Best 2013) with selection
of 100 (2 matched sets of 50) words (treated/untreated for the SLT group)
Secondary outcomes: free conversation with partner. Discourse analysis (substantive
turns, number of content words per turn, number of nouns per turn)
Data collection: baseline, post-treatment (8 weeks) and 6 week follow-up (14 weeks)

Methods
“Prospective comparative study, randomised, multicenter, superiority, a student study group for 3 months using the
workbook C.COM compared to a control group not using it, but receiving the same amount of speech therapy using
such non-imaged media of communication”
Participants
29 recent stroke patients with severe expressive aphasia from 43 to 91 years, without visual gnostic disorder, were
included in 6 participating centres of the great Southwest. The 2 groups did not differ at baseline in terms of severity
of aphasia, related disorders, and pragmatic assessment of the communication
Interventions
“In France, the communication workbook C.COM, associated with a specific procedure for the construction, use,
and guidance of partner and caregiver, has been used since 2004. Communication is studied on a test of pragmatic
communication (test of the 6 tasks) with 6 arbitrary instructions, graded according to 2 levels of difficulty, with
a double-blind videotape evaluation. Secondarily, the study examines what patient and partner think about the
effectiveness of the C.COM, its effective use every day, the scores on tests assessing associated verbal communication,
functional communication, the analytical capabilities of language, the depressive state”

Characteristics of ongoing studies [ordered by study ID]
ASK
Trial name or title
Reducing the psychosocial impact of aphasia on mood and quality of life in people with aphasia and the impact
of caregiving in family members through the Aphasia Action Success Knowledge (Aphasia ASK) program:
a cluster randomised controlled trial (“In stroke patients with aphasia and their caregivers does the Aphasia
ASK Action Success Knowledge (ASK) program, compared to an attention control package, promote better
mood and overall quality of life outcomes?”)
Methods
RCT. Hospital clusters will be randomised to either 1 of the 2 treatment arms. Participants will undergo the
assigned treatment arm with a qualified speech pathologist from when they are first recruited until 12 months
poststroke. Allocation is not concealed
Participants
344 people with aphasia and their family members
Inclusion criteria: within 6 months poststroke, diagnosis of aphasia as a result of first stroke (as assessed using
the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised), 18 years of age or older, have adequate hearing and vision levels to
participate as judged by the treating speech pathologist
Exclusion criteria: concomitant cognitive disorders such as dementia or primary progressive aphasia, aphasia
of an aetiology other than stroke, a history of recurrent depression (3 or more previous diagnosed episodes
defined as needing to see a health practitioner for treatment - either psychotherapy or medication prescribed,
confirmed by self report), current psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. depressive disorder; anxiety disorder, confirmed by

Hospital Version-10 (score of 9 or more) or the Depression Intensity Scale Circles (score of 3 or more)
, currently receiving treatment in a psychiatric setting, enrolment in other aphasia or depression clinical
treatment studies
Interventions
1. The Aphasia ASK intervention consists of a face-to-face intervention and follow-up phone calls provided by
a speech pathologist up until 12 months poststroke. The intervention is for 6-8 weeks for an hour each week.
The topics in the intervention include a number of modules and cover a range of areas including: caregiver
training(e.g.communicationpartnertraining),education (on aphasia, successful coping strategiesandsupport
services) stress management, positive adaptive strategies, sharing of personal stories and developing peer-based
support. The participants will be able to prioritise the order of modules based on their personal interest and
needs. The prioritisation occurs during the module ’Before we begin’. The first session establishes the goals
for the programme using collaborative goal setting techniques. The goals form the basis for prioritising the
modules that are covered in future weeks. For example, if the participant’s goal is to stay positive, there is a
module on positive thinking that includes information about and practice on exercises for strategies which
were drawn from the counselling literature. At the end of each module, further resources are recommended
including community based options/programmes/resources. Goals are revisited each session. The modules
are designed as a guide and should be incorporated with clinical skill and knowledge to ensure the programme
is person-centred. Aphasia ASK is to be delivered as individual sessions with only 1 participant with aphasia
and their family member(s) involved at any time. Follow-up monthly phone calls or visits (whichever method
is suitable for the participants) will be made until 12 months poststroke. The follow-up calls with revisit
the participant goals set during the programme and provide additional information and resources where
necessary. An Aphasia ASK programme manual has been written for the provider therapist and a separate
aphasia friendly workbook has been written for the recipients. Recipients will receive the written materials
prior to each session
2. A secondary stroke prevention programme forms the content of the attention control package. It will be
provided in a similar dosage (1 h session per week for 6-8 weeks and follow-up monthly phone calls until 12
months poststroke) and similar format (written support materials, delivered to both patients and their family)
to the Aphasia ASK intervention The information that will inform the modules will include: What is stroke?
Recovery from stroke Understanding risk factors for stroke; Lifestyle interventions; Barriers to implementing
lifestyle changes; Understanding your medication
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: Assessment for Living with Aphasia (ALA); Stroke and Aphasia Depression Questionnaire
(SADQ-21)
Secondary outcomes: Bakas Caregiver Outcomes Scale -Revised (BCOS); General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-28), self reported stroke risk-related behaviours of people with aphasia
Data collection: baseline (enrolment of study, within 6 months of aphasia onset) and at postintervention (at
12 months post aphasia onset) of stroke

 Big CACTUS
Trial name or title
A study to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of aphasia computer treatment versus usual stimulation or
attention control long term post stroke (Big CACTUS)
Methods
Pragmatic, parallel group randomised controlled adjunct trial design
Participants
N = 285
Inclusion criteria: participants will be included if aged 18 or over, diagnosis of stroke(s), onset of stroke at
least 4 months prior to randomisation, diagnosis of aphasia, subsequent to stroke, as confirmed by a trained
speech and language therapist, word retrieval difficulties tested by the naming test of the Comprehensive
Aphasia Test (score of 10%-90%, 5-43/48) and ability to perform a simple matching task with the StepbyStep
programme (to confirm sufficient vision and cognitive ability to participate in the intervention)
Exclusion criteria: participants will be excluded from the study if they have another premorbid speech and
language disorder caused by a neurological deficit other than stroke (a formal diagnosis can be reported by
the participant or relatives and confirmed by the recruiting speech and language therapist); they are unable
to repeat words (suggesting presence of severe dyspraxia), they require treatment for a language other than
English (as the software is in English) and they are currently using the StepbyStep computer programme or
other computer speech therapy aimed at word retrieval/naming
Interventions
1. self managed computerised therapy intervention plus usual care (UC) (N = 95). The intervention targets
word retrieval as it is 1 of the challenges most frequently experienced by people with aphasia, restricting their
communication. The intervention is composed of 3 components: SLT-tailored computer exercises; regular self
managed practice and volunteer support to assist with treatment adherence and carryover into daily activity
2. Usual care control arm (N = 95). Usual care may consist of participation in a range of activities to a greater
or lesser extent. This may include face-to-face speech and language therapy targeting language impairment
(reading, writing, speaking or understanding); therapy focusing on compensatory communication strategies,
provision of communication aids or psychological support; attendance at voluntary support groups or informal
communication support from family and friends. Participants randomised to the UC group will not receive
any project-specific intervention
3. Attention control plus UC group (N = 95). SLT to select puzzle book of appropriate level. Contacted
month by research team to check progress with puzzles and see if need another book
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: change in the number of words (of personal relevance to the participant) named correctly
at 6 months will be measured by a picture-naming task; improvement in functional communication will be
measured by blinded ratings of video-recorded conversations between a speech and language therapist and
participants using the activity scale of the Therapy Outcome Measures and number of target words used in
conversation, at 6 months
Secondary outcomes: improvement in patient perception of communication will be measured using the
COAST - a patient-reported measure of communication participation and related quality of life
Data collection: baseline, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months

Short title: Can a new intensive model of aphasia rehabilitation achieve better outcomes than usual care?
Methods
Parallel single blinded 2 arm stratified block randomisation pragmatic trial
Stratified randomisation will be used in order to ensure balance between LIFT and usual care groups with
respect to severity of aphasia (mild/moderate, severe) using the Language Screening Test (LAST) screening
assessment
Participants

Treating speech pathologists (N = up to 50):
Stakeholders (N = 30)
Inclusion criteria: Participants with aphasia: confirmed stroke (medical chart) and confirmed aphasia using
the Language Screening Test; score above cut-off on the cognitive subtest of the Comprehensive Aphasia
Test; willing to forego other speech therapy for the duration of the study and during follow-up; able to toilet
independently or with the assistance of an accompanying caregiver; requires at least 7 more weeks of therapy
as reported by the referring speech pathologist; English language, hearing and vision sufficient for therapy as
judged by the referring speech pathologist and the research assistant. Family members/carers of participants

Family members/carers of people with aphasia: must not have dementia or other cognitive impairments;
must not have uncorrected vision or hearing impairments that will prevent participation. Treating speech
pathologists: no exclusion criteria. Speech pathology stakeholders: no exclusion criteria
Interventions
1. LIFT: 3 week intensive programme + 4 weeks maintenance, delivered by trained speech pathologists at
The UQ CCRE Aphasia Clinic and other rehabilitation centres of our Partner Organisations. Participants
in LIFT attend 60 minute sessions 10 times a week for individual therapy, 60 minute sessions 5 times each
week of computer-based therapy and 60 minute sessions twice per week of group therapy
2. Usual care: any aphasia therapy up to 12 months poststroke, delivered by typical speech pathology service
providers in outpatient hospital setting or community based rehabilitation setting in the patients’ homes or
centres

Trial name or title
To study the effectiveness of ’Comprehensive Neuropsychological Rehabilitation’ as an adjunct to standard
pharmacological treatment for improving language and quality of life in patients with post stroke aphasia: a
randomised controlled clinical trial
Methods
Randomised, parallel group, placebo controlled trial
Participants
N = 40
Inclusion criteria: participants of either sex aged 18-65 years; any education level; language: Hindi or English;
handedness: right; patients suffering first-time ischaemic stroke diagnosed with non-fluent or fluent aphasia
within a year of index event; all consenting patients; caregiver (taking up the role of home-based therapist)
is available who has frequent contact with the subject (e.g. an average of 10 h per week or more), and can
accompany the subject to all clinic visits for the duration of the rehabilitation programme
Exclusion criteria: patients suffering from more than 1 episode of stroke affecting language and cognition, any
medical condition limiting life expectancy; any major neurological disorder affecting cognition; any major
psychiatric disorder; use of psychoactive drugs; active participation in other stroke recovery trials testing
experimental intervention about cognition; pregnant women; patients with any contraindication for MRI
and patients having claustrophobia
Interventions
1. Intervention: comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation with aphasia therapy would be given along
with normal clinical course of treatment by the treating doctor(neurologist). The rehabilitation would be
patient specific and would likely be 4-8 weeks for each patient. The next session would only be introduced
if the patient is able to reach the ceiling effect for the tasks of the current week. The patient would be called
once a week. Each session would last for 45 minutes to an hour
2. Control group: no comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation with aphasia therapy would be given,
however, the normal clinical course of treatment would continue by the treating doctor. The control group
patients would be called the same number of times as the patients of the intervention group by maintaining
a follow-up with the treating doctor (neurologist) and not the clinical neuropsychologist
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: change in the scores of language functioning from pre to postintervention in the following
domains: acoustic problems; speech and language problems; simple mathematical problems; perceptuo-motor
and writing problems; and visual and reading problems. Change in the scores from pre to postintervention
of quality of life
Secondary outcomes: change in scores from pre to postintervention of the following: cognitive functioning
(memory, attention and executive functioning); depression and correlate with changes in neural activations
(imaging using fMRI)
Data collection: baseline, post-1 month treatment and post-3 months of comprehensive neuropsychological
rehabilitation with aphasia therapy with the use of fMRI

Appendix 8. Search strategies used in previous versions of this review
For the original version of the review searches of MEDLINE (1966 to 1998) and CINAHL (1982 to 1998) were carried out using
simple combinations of text words describing aphasia and SLT. We also searched major trials registers for ongoing trials including
ClinicalTrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/), the Stroke Trials Registry (www.strokecenter.org/trials/) and Current Controlled
Trials (www.controlled-trials.com).

details of the amendments are listed in the Background
section of the review.
We have included a total of 39 studies involving 2518
participants
The findings provide some evidence of the effective-
ness of SLT for people with aphasia following stroke
in relation to improvements in measures of func-
tional communication, receptive and expressive lan-
guage when compared to no SLT. The potential bene-
fits of intensive SLT over conventional SLT were con-
founded by a significantly higher dropout from inten-
sive SLT. More participants also withdrew from social
support than SLT interventions

Amendments to the original 1999 review
Following close inspection of the original review and detailed discussion among this review team (Greener 1999), we made adjustments
to the review, many of which reflect changes in Cochrane procedures, review methodologies, and style and structure in the time since
the publication of the original review. These amendments were ratified by the Cochrane Stroke Group Editorial Board on 23 November
2006.
Background
We updated the Background section to include a definition of SLT and aphasia, and to reflect current approaches and rationale to SLT
interventions and outcomes.
Objectives
We amended the Objectives to a single statement according to the standard format of Cochrane reviews; that is, to assess the effects of
SLT interventions for aphasia following stroke.
Types of studies
It was unclear whether or not quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in the original review. We have excluded quasi-
randomised trials.
Types of interventions
We compressed the Types of interventions into three broad categories: SLT versus no SLT intervention, SLT versus social support or
stimulation, and SLT intervention A versus SLT intervention B (where A and B refer to two different types of therapeutic interventions
or approaches).
Types of outcome measures
We refined the Types of outcome measures to a single primary outcome measure of functional communication. Secondary outcomes
include other measures of communication (receptive or expressive language, or both), psychosocial outcomes, patient satisfaction with
the intervention, number of participant dropouts for any reason, adherence to the allocated intervention, economic outcomes (such as
cost to the patient, caregivers, families, health service, and society) and caregiver or family satisfaction. We extracted data relating to
death, morbidity and cognitive skills in the original review, but on reflection, we did not consider these to be relevant indicators of the
effectiveness of an SLT intervention, and we therefore excluded them from this update. The original review reported overall functional
status (e.g. Barthel Index) as one of a number of primary outcomes. As described above, we focused on a single primary outcome (in
line with the current review methodology).

 Data extraction tool
For this 2016 version of the review, PC and MB created and piloted a new electronically based data extraction tool. MB and HK or
PE had extracted data from trials included the 2012 review using a paper-based tool.
Search methods for identification of studies
Re-running the original search strategy for the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases raised over 12.6 million references. Therefore,
Brenda Thomas, the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Search Co-ordinator, devised up-to-date search strategies. We handsearched the
International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders (previously named the British Journal of Disorders of Communication,
theEuropean Journal of Disorders of Communication and the International Journal of Disorders of Communication) from 1969 to 2005.
This journal has been indexed by MEDLINE since 2006 and was thus included in our electronic searches from this date.
Description of studies
The original 1999 review listed studies other than identified RCTs in the Characteristics of excluded studies table, including single
case or case series studies. As there are a vast number of such studies, the updated table now only presents potentially relevant studies
that appear to be randomised but which we excluded for other reasons (e.g. quasi-randomised or where we could not extract aphasia-
specific data).
Comparisons
Mid-trial outcome scores were included in the 1999 review. We have focused our reporting on postintervention and follow-up scores.
We have not included analyses of the number of participants who deteriorated on particular outcome measures.
Other amendments
As we were unable to obtain the extraction sheets for the trials included in the review (published in 1999), we cross-checked the data
extracted for the original review with the available published and unpublished data. We made some amendments regarding the exclusion
of some studies and the categorisation of the methods of allocation concealment used in the included trials.
In the 2012 review update, we excluded quasi-randomised studies, so we excluded one study that had contributed to the 1999 review
(Hartman 1987). In addition, on reviewing the data from another trial (Kinsey 1986), we decided that the reported comparison was
not a therapy intervention as such, but rather a comparison of task performance (computer-based or with a therapist). We thus excluded
this trial from subsequent reviews. The review team considered allocation concealment for one study to be ’inadequate’ in the 1999
review (MacKay 1988). We failed to get confirmation of the method of allocation from the authors, and therefore we amended the
allocation for this trial to ’unclear’. The 1999 review included a matched control group of no SLT intervention for one trial (Prins
1989). However, unlike the other groups in this trial, this group was not randomised, therefore we have excluded it from this update.
Another study had been excluded from the original review on the grounds that it was not an RCT (Shewan 1984). Discussion with the
trialists has since revealed that it was, and we have now included it in the 2012 and 2016 reviews.The original 1999 review included
outcomes relating to the impact of SLT on the emotional well-being of family members (Lincoln 1984a). Such outcomes do not directly
relate to the aims of this review, so we have not included these measures.

 Information added to the 1999 review
Following an extensive search up to April 2009, we identified an additional 20 trials as suitable for inclusion in the review. The 2010
review included data from 30 trials involving 1840 randomised participants (Kelly 2010).
Information added to the 2012 review
Following an extensive search from inception of the electronic databases up to July 2011, we identified an additional nine trials eligible
for inclusion in the review. This 2012 review update now includes data from 39 trials involving 2518 randomised participants.
Information added to the 2016 review
Following a revised and extended search (incorporating additional electronic databases) from inception of the databases up to 22
September 2015, we identified an additional 18 trials (22 randomised comparisons) eligible for inclusion in the review. This 2016
review update now includes data from 57 completed trials (74 randomised comparisons) involving 3002 randomised participants.
