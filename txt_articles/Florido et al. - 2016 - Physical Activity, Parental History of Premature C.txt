Background-—The effects of some atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors vary according to whether an
individual has a family history (FHx) of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Physical activity (PA) is associated with reduced
risk of ASCVD, but whether this association varies by FHx status is not well established.
Methods and Results-—We evaluated 9996 participants free of ASCVD at baseline. FHx of premature CHD was defined as CHD
occurring in a father before age 55 or mother before age 60. PA, assessed by a Baecke questionnaire, was converted into minutes/
week of moderate or vigorous exercise and categorized per American Heart Association guidelines as recommended, intermediate, or
poor. Incident ASCVD was defined as incident myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, or stroke. Multivariable-adjusted Cox hazard models
were used. The mean age was 54�6 years, 56% were women, and 21% of black race. Participants with and without a FHx of premature
CHD reported similar levels of PA at baseline (423 versus 409 metabolic equivalents of task9min/week, respectively, P=0.852), and
�40% of both groups met American Heart Association recommended PA levels. Over a mean follow�up of 20.9 years, there were
1723 incident ASCVD events. Compared to those with poor PA adherence to American Heart Association guidelines, participants who
reported PA at recommended levels had significantly lower risk of incident ASCVD after adjustment for demographics and lifestyle
factors (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.94), but this association was not modified by FHx status (P�interaction=0.680).
Conclusions-—PA was associated with a reduced risk of ASCVD among individuals with and without a FHx of premature CHD.

A
therosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed
countries. A history of premature coronary heart disease
(CHD) among first-degree relatives has been shown in
multiple epidemiologic studies to be strongly associated with
incident myocardial infarction, coronary death, and stroke.1–4
Studies have demonstrated a 2- to 7-fold increase in risk of
CHD associated with a positive family history (FHx).5
Familial clustering of CHD risk factors such as hyperten-
sion, smoking, and dyslipidemia is well established.5,6 Such
clustering may be explained by varying degrees of genetic
predisposition as well as shared habits among family mem-
bers.5 Interestingly, prior data suggest that the risk factors for
ASCVD may have differential effects among those with and
without a FHx of premature CHD. For example, comparable
risk factor profiles have been associated with increased
atherosclerotic disease among those with a FHx.6–8 Similarly,
the risk reduction associated with certain interventions such
as smoking cessation may differ according to the presence of
a FHx of CHD.9,10
A fundamental component of preventive strategies to
reduce cardiovascular risk is to increase physical activity (PA).
Higher levels of PA are associated with improvement in all
forms of ASCVD, including risk factors, CHD, heart failure, and

Although clustering of behavioral
cardiovascular
risk
factors has been noted in many studies, data have been
conflicting regarding levels of PA performed by those with
compared to those without a FHx of CHD.15 Given their higher
risk status, it would be important to understand whether
individuals with a FHx of premature CHD are more (or less)
likely to meet AHA recommended levels of PA than those
without a similar FHx. Furthermore, the relative impact of
higher levels of PA for ASCVD prevention among those
specifically with a FHx of premature CHD compared to those
without such a history is currently unknown. Lastly, we pose
the question of whether increasing PA levels over time (ie,
going from poor levels to recommended levels) could further
reduce ASCVD risk compared to those whose PA levels
remained poor, and if that differs among those with and
without a FHx.
We hypothesized that baseline PA levels would be higher
among those with a FHx of CHD because persons with FHx
may be more likely to adopt healthy lifestyle because of
knowledge of their baseline risk. We also hypothesized that a
positive FHx of premature CHD would modify the association
between PA and incident ASCVD.
Methods
Study Population
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study is a
multicenter, predominantly biracial, prospective cohort of
middle-aged men and women from 4 US communities:
Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburbs
of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Mary-
land. The ARIC Study design has been previously reported.16
Individuals aged 45 to 64 years were enrolled between 1987
and 1989 when they took part in a baseline (visit 1) clinic
examination. Participants have taken part in up to 4 additional
main visits: 1990–1992 (visit 2), 1993–1995 (visit 3), 1996–
1998 (visit 4), and 2011–2013 (visit 5).
Of 15 792 participants evaluated at ARIC visit 1, we
excluded those with prevalent CHD (n=766), defined by self-
reported prior physician diagnosis of myocardial infarction or
coronary revascularization, or prevalent myocardial infarction
by 12-lead ECG at visit 1. We also excluded those with
prevalent heart failure at visit 1 (n=599), defined by (1) those
with an affirmative response to the question: “Were any of the
medications you took during the last 2 weeks for heart
failure?” or (2) those with stage 3 or “manifest heart failure”
as determined by Gothenburg criteria.17 Participants with
prevalent CHD and heart failure were excluded because their
underlying health conditions may limit their ability to maxi-
mally perform PA, or they may have restrictions placed on
their allowed PA intensity/duration as prescribed by their
healthcare provider. Additionally, because of small numbers,
individuals who were nonblack or nonwhite (n=46), as well as
blacks from the Minnesota and Maryland centers (n=49) were
not included. We also excluded 2391 participants with
missing data on parental history of premature CHD or who
answered “don’t know” when asked about parental history of
premature CHD and 1945 participants with missing data on
PA. A total of 9996 individuals were eligible for the present
analysis.
The Institutional Review Boards at all ARIC study sites and
the Coordinating Center approved study protocols, and all
participants provided written informed consent at each study
visit.
Exposures
The primary exposure of interest was PA at visit 1, with a
focus on its relationship with incident ASCVD. A FHx of
premature CHD was considered as a possible effect modifier
of this association. FHx of premature CHD was assessed at
visit 1 by self-report via a questionnaire administered to each
ARIC participant. Subjects were asked if they had a parent
who had a heart attack occurring in a father before the age 55
or in a mother before age 60. Subjects who answered “yes”
were counted as yes (“a positive FHx”), whereas those who
said “no” were counted as no FHx of premature CHD.
Participants who answered “don’t know” were excluded from
the analyses.
Sports, leisure, and work PA were assessed via a modified
Baecke questionnaire at visit 1 and visit 3. For our study, we
used data from the sports questionnaire in which individuals
reported participation in up to 4 sports within the previous
year, as well as the number of hours per week and months per
year spent on each sport. As has been done in prior ARIC
studies,18,19 each sport was converted into metabolic equiv-
alents of task (METS) as per the Compendium of Physical
Activities. Moderate activities were defined as those involving
a workload of 3 to 6 METS and vigorous activities were those
involving a workload of ≥6 METS. For both visit 1 and visit 3
separately, information from the questionnaires was subse-
quently converted into minutes per week of moderate or
vigorous PA, and categorized as per AHA recommendations
into 3 groups: recommended (≥75 min/week of vigorous
intensity or ≥150 min/week of any combination of moder-
ate+vigorous intensity), intermediate (1–74 min/week of
vigorous intensity or 1–149 min/week of any combination
of moderate+vigorous intensity), or poor (0 min/week of
moderate or vigorous exercise). We also modeled PA 3
additional ways: (1) continuously as METS9min/week, (2)

 categorized into quartiles (in METS9min/week), and (3) by
comparing the 90th to the 10th percentile of PA levels.
Furthermore, we examined change in PA from visit 1 to visit 3;
this was modeled as change in overall METS9min/week
(continuous) as well as change in AHA-defined categories (ie,
poor, intermediate, and recommended).
Covariates of Interest
Demographics and information on other covariates of interest
were obtained from history, physical examination, and
laboratory data at visit 1. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated from measured height and weight. Smoking status
was categorized as never, former, and current smoker, and
alcohol consumption as current drinkers versus former/never
drinkers.
Diabetes
mellitus
was
defined
as
a
fasting
(≥8 hours)
glucose
≥126 mg/dL,
a
nonfasting
glucose
≥200 mg/dL, a self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus or the reported use of hypoglycemic agents. Systolic
blood pressure was the mean calculated from the second and
third measurements obtained at the visit examination.
Hypertension
was
defined
as
systolic
blood
pressure
≥140 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or
reported use of blood pressure–lowering medications. Total
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyc-
erides were measured using standardized enzymatic assays
and reported in mg/dL. Estimated glomerular filtration rate
was calculated from serum creatinine from blood samples
collected at visit 1 using the CKD-Epi equation.20
Outcomes
The primary outcome was incident ASCVD determined from
hospital discharge codes or death certificates. Incident
ASCVD was defined as definite or probable myocardial
infarction, definite coronary death, and definite or probable
stroke, defined as sudden or rapid onset of neurological
symptoms that lasted for 24 hours or led to death in the
absence of another cause.17,21,22 Information on hospitaliza-
tions was obtained from participants via yearly telephone
calls, and vital records were examined for all deaths.
Additionally, ARIC investigators conducted continuous surveil-
lance for all cardiovascular disease–related hospitalizations
and deaths. Study participants contributed follow-up time
from the date of the participant’s baseline visit until the date
of incident ASCVD event, death, loss-to-follow-up, or the end
of follow-up (December 31, 2012), whichever came first.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline
characteristics
of
the
study
population
were
described using means, medians, and proportions stratified
by status of FHx of premature CHD. We used v2 and ANOVA
tests for categorical and continuous variables, in order to
assess for differences in demographic, clinical, and laboratory
characteristics among the study population. Kaplan–Meier
curves were constructed for ASCVD-free survival by FHx
groups.
We used multivariable-adjusted multinomial logistic regres-
sion and linear regression methods to determine whether
baseline PA groups and change in PA levels between visit 1
and visit 3 differed by FHx of premature CHD status. We then
used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models
to evaluate the associations of PA at visit 1 with incident
ASCVD events stratified by FHx of premature CHD status. PA
was modeled according to AHA categories, as quartiles, and
continuous (90th compared to 10th percentile). All analyses
were progressively adjusted as follows: Model 1 included
demographics of age, sex, and race/center. Model 2 included
the variables from Model 1 as well as possible confounding
lifestyle factors of education, BMI, smoking status, and
current alcohol intake. Model 2 was considered our primary
model. We also examined a third model that included the
variables from Model 2 as well as possible mediators of the
association of PA and ASCVD including systolic blood
pressure, antihypertensive use, diabetes mellitus, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
triglycerides, use of lipid-lowering medications, and estimated
glomerular filtration rate.
We tested for whether there was a multiplicative interac-
tion between PA and FHx of premature CHD for incident
ASCVD using Wald Tests, with adjustment for Model 2
covariates.
Additionally, to investigate for a possible dose–response
relationship, in analyses stratified by FHx of premature CHD,
we modeled the continuous association of PA in METS9min/
week with risk of incident ASCVD using restricted cubic
splines with knots at 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles,
adjusted for the factors in Model 2.
Finally, using the same progressively adjusted regression
models as above, we assessed the risk of incident ASCVD for
change in PA category from visit 1 to visit 3, stratified by FHx
of premature CHD status. For this analysis, we excluded 263
participants who developed ASCVD before or on visit 3.
Results
Characteristics of the study population among individuals with
and without a FHx of premature CHD are presented in
Table 1. Of 9996 ARIC participants included in the study, 990
(9.9%) reported a FHx for premature CHD. The mean age of
the study population was 54�6 years, 56% were women and
21% of black race. Compared to those without a FHx of
premature CHD, participants with a known FHx of premature

were more likely to be current smokers.
Participants with and without a FHx of premature CHD
reported similar levels of PA at baseline visit 1 (423 versus
409 MET9min/week, respectively, P=0.852), and �40% of
both groups met AHA recommended PA levels. In multivari-
able-adjusted models, individuals with a FHx of premature
CHD were not more likely to engage in intermediate (odds
ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.79, 1.12], Model 2) or recommended

without a FHx (Table 2).
Over a mean follow-up of 20.9 years, there were a total of
1545 ASCVD events within the group without a FHx of CHD
(incidence rate: 8.2 per 1000 person-years), and 178 ASCVD
events among individuals with a positive parental history of
premature CHD (incidence rate: 8.7 per 1000 person-years).
The time to 90% event-free survival was 14.7 years for those
without a FHx and 13.8 years for those with a FHx (Figure 1).
In the overall cohort, after adjustment for demographics
and lifestyle factors, meeting AHA-recommended levels of PA,
versus poor levels of PA, was associated with lower risk of

status (P-interaction=0.680) (Table 3).
Consistent results were also found when evaluating
quartiles of PA, with those in the highest quartile, compared
to the lowest quartile, having lower risk of ASCVD in the
overall cohort after adjustment for demographics/lifestyle
factors (HR 0.79 [0.69, 0.91], Model 2) and also with further
adjustment for ASCVD risk factors (HR 0.80 [0.70, 0.92],
Model 3). Results were again similar among those with and
without a FHx of premature CHD (0.90 [0.59, 1.39] and 0.78
[0.68, 0.90], Model 2), without significant interaction by FHx
status (P-interaction=0.939) (Table 4). Finally, when compar-
ing the 90th to the 10th percentile of PA levels, the benefit
conferred by high PA for ASCVD was modestly stronger
among those with a FHx (0.76 [0.51, 1.12], Model 2)
compared to those without a FHx (0.83 [0.73, 0.94]) but
confidence intervals were wide and overlapping for those with
a FHx and no significant interaction by FHx status was found
(P-interaction=0.533).
Similar patterns were observed when considering a FHx of
any CHD (regardless of whether premature or not), with no
significant interactions by FHx status (Table 5).
We also modeled PA as a continuous variable measured in
METS9min/week. Using restricted cubic spline models, we
found a graded association of higher levels of PA and lower
ASCVD risk in those without a FHx of premature CHD
(Figure 2A). Among those with a FHx of premature CHD the
confidence intervals are wide, making interpretation difficult
(Figure 2B).
When assessing changes in AHA categories of PA from visit 1
to visit 3 in the overall cohort, we found that the majority of
study participants, 54%, maintained the same levels of PA from
visit 1 to visit 3. Over this 6-year period, 22% of the participants
decreased, and 24% increased their levels of PA. In multivari-
able-adjusted analyses, there was no significant difference in
the change in PA levels from visit 1 to visit 3 among those with a
FHx of premature CHD compared to those without such a
history (Table 2). Compared to those whose PA levels remained
poor, we observed that maintaining recommended levels of PA
or increasing levels of PA over time are associated with lower
risk of incident ASCVD in both individuals with and without a
FHx of premature CHD (P-interaction=0.678) (Table 6).

 baseline, we found that less than half of the study participants
engaged in AHA-recommended levels of PA. Individuals with a
positive FHx of premature CHD had higher levels of total and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglycerides,
but had similarly low levels of PA both at baseline and at a 6-
year follow-up compared to those without a positive FHx of
premature CHD. Our findings confirm prior studies that higher
levels of PA are associated with lower incidence ASCVD, and
we now suggest that this association could be similar among
individuals with and without a FHx of premature CHD,
although more definitive conclusions are limited by the small
number of individuals in the former group.
Our study findings corroborate recent data that greater
than 50% of the American population perform less than the
recommended levels of PA23 and that �250 000 annual
deaths can be attributed to the consequences of physical
inactivity.24 The AHA considers meeting recommended levels
of PA as one of the metrics with the greatest potential for
improvement,14 and our study further highlights the impor-
tance of increasing PA for ASCVD risk prevention. In our
study, despite having more adverse lipid profiles and being at
an increased risk for ASCVD, only 40% of participants with a
FHx of premature CHD performed recommended levels of PA.
Such findings emphasize the importance of assessing PA
levels at every patient encounter and increasing efforts to
counsel patients on the benefits of exercise.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the
impact of higher levels of PA among individuals with a FHx of
premature CHD compared to those without. No interaction
was found between higher levels of PA and a FHx of
premature CHD. However, despite the lack of statistical
significance among the group with a FHx of premature CHD,
both groups had similar magnitude of decrease in the risk of
ASCVD events. The lack of statistical significance within the
group with a FHx of premature CHD is likely explained by the
small number of individuals in that group leading to reduced
power to detect a significant difference.
FHx of premature CHD has been associated with a
significantly increased risk of ASCVD events,25 and prior
studies have indicated that these individuals are more
susceptible to the deleterious effects of certain behaviors
such as smoking.9 Screening for FHx of premature CHD is an
effective way of identifying a high-risk group that may benefit
from receiving more intensive preventative interventions.26
Tailored counseling of high-risk individuals identified through
family risk assessment has been shown to increase healthy
behaviors such as consumption of fruits and vegetables, and
performing PA for 30 minutes 5 to 6 times a week.27 Our
study demonstrates the high prevalence of modifiable behav-
ior within this high-risk population and suggests a potential
benefit with targeted approaches that would lead to increases
in PA levels.
In our study, �10% of the population reported a parental
history of premature CHD. In contrast to other studies, the
crude (unadjusted) incidence rates of ASCVD events was not
much higher among this subgroup when compared to
individuals without such FHx, with only a small difference in
time to first event on average. Although simple definitions of
FHx have been shown to be associated with ASCVD risk, not
everyone has the same family structure, or knowledge of their

 family members’ health status. FHx of premature CHD was
ascertained at ARIC visit 1 (1987–1989); during this time
period, there might have been less emphasis on the
importance of FHx compared to the present, and perhaps
participants were less knowledgeable about their FHx status,
potentially leading to misclassification of study participants.
A FHx of premature CHD in a sibling may be a stronger risk
for ASCVD compared to a parental FHx.28 Furthermore, a
more comprehensive approach called “family risk scores,”
which compare observed and expected number of relatives
with ASCVD in a family compared to population estimates of
age/sex disease rates, may further improve risk stratification
and allow for inclusion of second- and even third-degree
relatives into risk estimates.3,29 These data were not available
in the overall ARIC cohort. Finally, the relative risks associated
with a FHx of premature CHD tend to be largest for people in
middle age; the mean age of our study population at baseline
was 54 years, so by the end of follow-up, the mean age of the
cohort is in their mid-70s. Thus, the relative difference that
the presence of a positive FHx confers on incident ASCVD
rates would likely be more pronounced in a younger cohort.
Our study has some limitations. As with all observational
studies, there is the potential for residual confounding. PA
was assessed via a questionnaire with the potential for
reporting bias. Directly measured fitness correlates better
with cardiometabolic risk factors30 and CHD risk31 than self-
reported PA. Another important limitation is ascertainment of
FHx of premature CHD. In ARIC, FHx of premature CHD was
self-reported, leading to possible misclassification. Partici-
pants may not have been aware of the medical history of
family members, or may have reported premature deaths that
were not from CHD. However, self-reported FHx of premature
CHD is what is commonly used in multiple large population-
based cohorts. Furthermore, when evaluating a patient in a
clinical setting, ascertainment of FHx is also usually self-
reported and not validated. Prior studies have found that self-
reported FHx of CHD is reasonably accurate compared to
validated FHx using medical records obtained from first-
degree relatives of the proband.32,33
Finally, we were limited by the small number of individuals
in the group with a parental history of premature CHD, which
decreased the power to detect statistically significant differ-
ences. Since the lack of interaction by FHx status was actually
contrary to our original a priori hypotheses, we performed a
post-hoc power calculation. We determined that our study had
adequate power to detect moderate to large differences in the
associations between participants with and without a FHx of
CHD, although it had limited power to detect small differ-
ences. For instance, in the fully adjusted models, we had
�92% power to detect hazard ratios twice as large in one FHx
group compared to the other, but only 50% power to detect
hazard ratios 1.5 times as large.
Despite these limitations, our study has many strengths.
ARIC is a well-characterized bi-ethnic cohort of middle-aged
individuals, with long-term (21-year) follow-up, and ASCVD
events adjudicated by an expert panel. Another strength of
the study is the assessment of PA at 2 points in time, over a
6-year period to evaluate change in PA levels by FHx status.
In summary, our study demonstrated that despite more
adverse lipid profiles, individuals with a FHx of premature CHD
had similar PA patterns as compared to a lower-risk group
without such FHx, with less than half meeting AHA recom-
mended levels. PA was associated with a lower risk for
incident ASCVD in those without a FHx, and a similar trend
was observed within the smaller group of participants with a
FHx of premature CHD. These findings have significant clinical
implications for strategies to prevent ASCVD in the general
population, as well as within this high-risk subgroup. Promo-
tion of PA should be encouraged for all regardless of FHx
status. Better strategies for increasing PA levels in the general
population as well as in high-risk subgroups are needed.
Better ascertainment of FHx (such as using a validated FHx or
Family Risk Scores) and of PA (such as using objectively
measured PA and/or measured fitness) will enhance the
quality of future studies in this field.
