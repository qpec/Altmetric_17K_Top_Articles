Abstract
Life history theory predicts trade-offs between reproductive effort and maternal survivorship
in energy-restricted environments. However, empirical evidence for the positive association
between maternal mortality and reproductive effort from energetically challenged human
populations are mixed and physiological mechanisms that may underlie this association are
poorly understood. We hypothesized that increases in aerobic metabolism during repeated
periods of pregnancy and lactation result in increased oxidative stress that may contribute
to somatic deterioration, vulnerability to illness, and accelerated aging. We therefore pre-
dicted that lifetime gravidity and parity would be related to levels of biomarkers of oxidative
stress, as well as antioxidative defence enzymes in post-menopausal women. Our hypothe-
sis was supported by positive linear associations between levels of 8-OHdG, a biomarker of
DNA oxidative damage (β = 0.21, p<0.05), levels of antioxidative defence enzyme Cu-Zn
SOD (β = 0.25, p<0.05), and number of lifetime pregnancies. Furthermore, independent of
age and health status, post-menopausal women with higher gravidity and parity (> = 4 preg-
nancies per lifetime) had 20% higher levels of 8-OHdG and 60% higher levels of Cu-Zn
SOD compared to women with lower gravidity and parity (<4 pregnancies per lifetime). Our
results present the first evidence for oxidative stress as a possible cost of reproductive effort
in humans.
Introduction
Humans, like all other organisms, face trade-offs between reproduction and maintenance when
energy resources are limited [1]. Due to the metabolic costs of pregnancy and lactation, women

 bear significant physiological costs associated with reproductive effort and thus are susceptible
to the negative consequences of these trade-offs [2]. Oxidative stress (OS), the state of imbal-
ance between generation and management of damaging reactive oxidative species (ROS) and
peroxidative agents through aerobic metabolism, is postulated as a central factor contributing
to somatic deterioration with age [3]. Moreover, the intensity and effects of OS are influenced
by environmental and life history factors. Among those factors, reproductive effort is hypothe-
sized to be a key cost, contributing to increased OS throughout an organism’s lifespan [4].
Although this theoretical prediction has been extensively investigated in animals [5–6], com-
pelling evidence is absent in humans.
Of the many sources of variation in oxidative stress, pregnancy, followed by lactation and
childcare, are proposed to be central since they incur major increases in energy metabolism
due to the costs of fetal development, milk production, and energy expenditure associated with
maternal maintenance and physical activity [7]. This major rise in metabolism and energy flux
might be associated with increased production of ROS and greater risk of oxidative stress [8].
The Disposable Soma Theory [9] predicts that in energetically constrained environments,
organisms will benefit by investing limited resources in reproduction rather than in mainte-
nance and repair. Over a lifetime, this leads to the accumulation of the cellular damage that
impairs normal functioning of cells and tissues and contributes to faster somatic deterioration
and aging [10]. Therefore, it can be expected that increases in energy metabolism related to
high reproductive effort will contribute to maternal aging and lifespan reduction via accumula-
tion of oxidative stress, especially in energetically constrained environments.
Up to date evidence in favor of these predictions in humans are mixed [11]. Studies of his-
torical populations have been inconsistent, showing positive, negative, or no relationship
between total parity and post-menopausal survival [12]. This inconsistency might be explained
by several factors impossible to control for from archives data such as breastfeeding (consti-
tutes the highest cost of single reproductive episode) or overall energy budget of woman [1,11].
Studies of contemporary populations have demonstrated a U-shaped relationship, with nulli-
parity and multipartiy (above 4 children) associated with highest mortality [12].
Significant increases in oxidative stress during gestation are evident, but only a few studies
have investigated oxidative stress during the menstrual cycle [13–14], and virtually no studies
have explored maternal oxidative stress during lactation [15]. Furthermore, the relationship
between lifetime reproductive effort and accumulated oxidative stress in women has not been
investigated.
To fill this gap, we conducted a study at the Mogielica Human Ecology Study Site [2], which
includes 5 villages in the mountainous area of Southern Poland. During their reproductive
period, women of this area have a broad range of parity (from 0 to 16 children) and intense
physical activity associated with seasonally demanding agricultural work. Due to the moun-
tainous terrain, operating heavy machinery is difficult and much of the work is done by hand.
Previous studies by Jasienska and Ellison [16–17] documented very heavy physical activity lev-
els during the summer season and light-moderate physical activity level during the winter sea-
son (according to the FAO/WHO/UNU1985 definition) [18] for women of reproductive age
from this area. High reproductive effort accompanied by high energy flux during the reproduc-
tive period may intensify trade-offs incurred by reproductive processes later in post- reproduc-
tive life [1]. Indeed, previous studies conducted in this population demonstrated a reduction in
maternal longevity in association with number of children [19].
Based on the recent observation of increased levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress in mul-
tiparous women suggesting that acute oxidative stress effects may accumulate over the conse-
cutive reproductive episodes [20] we hypothesized that increased lifetime reproductive effort is
associated with higher oxidative stress in postmenopausal women. To test this hypothesis in

 100 postmenopausal, non-smoking women (median age 65 years) we measured urinary levels
of three biomarkers: 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase
(Cu-Zn SOD), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) that together provide a
composite assessment of whole body oxidative stress. These three biomarkers are widely and
commonly deployed to assess oxidative stress in human studies [21–23]. In particular, levels of
8-OHdG depict the amount of oxidative damage accumulated in cellular DNA through the
repaired lesions formed by ROS on the guanine base pair. Cu-Zn SOD represents the level of
superoxide dismutase enzyme produced in cytoplasm, which contributes to the neutralization
of ROS and serves as a main line of defense against ongoing oxidative stress. TBARS assess-
ment reflects cellular lipid peroxidation as a result of oxidative stress.
Methods
Subjects
One hundred and twelve postmenopausal women were recruited from the general population
of the villages during door-to-door visits to women’s houses. Postmenopausal women from all
households in villages were invited to participate. Out of this number 12 women were excluded
due to past and current smoking, which has been demonstrated to significantly impact oxida-
tive stress biomarkers [24].
All women were examined by a physician on the day of sample collection to diagnose and
exclude from participation any cases of ongoing bacterial or viral infection. Due to advanced
age, over 70% of the postmenopausal women in the sample had long-term health problems
resulting in past hospitalization or long-term use of medication. Vitamin supplementation was
declared by about 30% of women. All women signed written consent for participation in the
study. Study protocol was reviewed and approved by Bioethical Committee of the Jagiellonian
University.
General questionnaire and reproductive history
A general questionnaire was designed to collect information about participant’s age, level of
education, marital status, current and previous employment and workload, long-term health
problems, current and past use of medication, occurrence of diseases and medical conditions,
lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and reproductive history. Based on
this information, the following reproductive effort variables were calculated: lifetime reproduc-
tive period (years between giving birth to the first and to the last child) and lifetime number of
months spent pregnant and lactating. In addition, total energetic costs of reproduction were
estimated based on data about pregnancy and lactation energetic requirements published by
Butte and King [7]. Pregnancies that resulted in miscarriage were also included in these esti-
mates, with the energy cost of the early-terminated pregnancy calculated for the first half of the
normal pregnancy.
Anthropometrics
Trained study assistants collected anthropometrical measurements of body height, sitting
height, body mass, total and abdominal body fat, and body circumferences. These measure-
ments were conducted during the initial visit to participants’ houses.
Body mass, body fat percentage, and abdominal fat rating were measured by bioelectrical
impedance analysis (BIA) using a TANITA scale (model BC 545) with the accuracy to the near-
est 0.1 kg (for body mass) and 0.1% (for body fat). Body height and sitting height were

 measured with a stadiometer, according to the standard methods, with the accuracy to the
nearest 0.1 cm.
Blood sample analysis
Trained nurses in the local outpatient clinic collected fasting blood sample from each partici-
pant. Samples were analyzed for basic blood parameters such as: hematocrit (HCT), hemoglo-
bin (Hgb), red blood cells (RBC), platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white
blood cells (WBC), glucose concentration, (GLU) low and high density lipoprotein concentra-
tion (LDL and HDL) and CRP to assess general health status of participating women. All analy-
ses were performed in the laboratory of local, nearby hospital in Limanowa. Evaluation of
HCT, Hgb, RBC, MCV, WBC and platelet count was performed by an automated hematology
analyzer (SYSMEX k-4500). ESR was determined automatically by Westergren method using
SEDI 15. GLU, HDL, LDL and CRP concentrations were tested automatically using Pentra 400
analyzer by Horiba ABX.
Urine samples analysis
Women collected a single first morning urine sample in sterile specimen containers provided
by study assistants and delivered samples to the local outpatient clinic. All samples were col-
lected during summer months (July and August) of 2013. Samples were aliquoted to separate
vials and frozen within one hour of collection at -80C. Frozen samples were transported on dry
ice to the Reproductive Ecology Laboratory in the Department of Anthropology at Yale Uni-
versity in order to conduct assay assessments of oxidative stress biomarkers. Samples were
thawed and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 G immediately before starting the assays to
eliminate particulate matter that could interfere with the analyses. All assays were conducted
using commercial ELISA kits in accordance to manufacturer directions and procedures. DNA
damage EIA kit (Enzo Life Sciences, catalogue nr ADI-EKS-350) was used to measure levels of
8-OHdG. 8-hydroxy-2’- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a modified nucleotide base and by-prod-
uct of DNA damage that is excreted in the urine upon DNA repair. The sensitivity of the DNA
Damage assay has been determined to be 0.59 ng/mL. The human Cu-Zn SOD enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Enzo Life Sciences, catalog nr ALX-850-033) was used to analyse level
of Cu-Zn superoxidase dismutase. This enzyme, which is present in the cytoplasm, catalyses
the dismutation of superoxide anion radicals to free oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The assay
sensitivity according to manufacturer protocol is 0.04 ng/ml. Levels of Thiobaturic Acid Reac-
tive Substances (TBARS) were analyzed using TBARS Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Company,
catalogue nr 10009055) to determine cellular lipid peroxidation occurring as a consequence of
oxidative stress.
All analyses were run in duplicates. Samples were randomly assigned to each assay. The
average inter-assay variability for 8-OHdG, SOD, and TBARS analysis was 14% while intra-
assay variability was 5%. All obtained results were corrected for urine concentration based on
samples’ specific gravity.
Statistical analysis
Values of oxidative stress and antioxidative defense biomarkers were log- transformed to
insure a normal distribution. Gravidity was used as a composite measure of reproductive effort,
which includes number of pregnancies, birth, and miscarriages and is highly correlated with
time spent on lactation (see Results). Student’s t-test for independent sample was used to test
the differences in health status, selected demographic and reproductive history variables
between lower (<4 pregnancies) and higher (> = 4 pregnancies) gravidity group. Women’s

 assignment to these two groups was established based on results of several previous studies
demonstrating increased costs of reproduction to mortality in women who gave birth to at
least 4 children [12, 25–27].
General linear models (GLM) were used to test for the effect of gravidity on the level of
oxidative stress and antioxidative defense biomarkers. Differences in biomarkers of oxidative
stress between higher and lower gravidity groups were tested using Multivariate Analysis of
Variance (MANOVA) and Covariance (MANCOVA). In these models log-transformed lev-
els of 8-OHdG, Cu-Zn SOD and TBARS were entered together as the dependent variables
because they all measure underlying concept of oxidative stress. Gravidity groups were used
as the categorical independent variables. Age and abdominal fat were entered as the covar-
iants, because both of these measures were previously shown to influence oxidative stress
biomarkers [28]. Furthermore, selected blood parameters were entered to the models to
account for participants’ health status. In particular, high glucose level and high ESR associ-
ated with increased and high HDL associated with decreased oxidative stress [28–30] were
added to the models.
To test for linear association between gravidity and levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, lin-
ear regression models were used, with levels of the oxidative stress biomarkers entered as the
dependent variables and gravidity entered as the independent predictors. Potential confound-
ers (age, abdominal fat, GLU and LDL concentration, and ESR after 2 hours) were introduced
as candidate covariates using backward step-wise regression methods with entrance and
removal criteria of a p value of less than 0.05 and F value equal to 3.
In addition, as U-shaped association between postmenopausal mortality and parity was
demonstrated in previous studies [11–12] we tested for the same shape of the association
between oxidative stress biomarkers and gravidity using polynomial regression models.
All analyses were conducted using STATISTICA version 10 with p-values set on 0.05.
Results
Descriptive statistics and simple correlations
Average levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in the sample of postmenopausal women were
109.0 ng/ml (SD = 44.45) for 8-OHdG, 0.56 ng/ml (SD = 0.437) for Cu-Zn SOD, and 2.1 μM/g
(SD = 1.75) for TBARS. As indicated by BMI (31.2; SD = 5.41) and percent of abdominal body
fat (10.8; SD = 2.96), women participating in the study had good nutritional status. Although
all of them were previously involved in occupational physical work, most of them did not work
anymore, neither at their farms or houses nor outside of them. Thus the level of their current
physical activity was relatively low. All descriptive statistics for women participating in the
study are presented in Table 1.
Significant and positive correlations were found between levels of all oxidative stress bio-
markers (r = 0.59, p<0.01 for ln 8-OHdG and ln Cu-Zn SOD; r = 0.31, p<0.01 for ln 8-OHdG
and ln TBARS; and r = 0.33, p<0.01 for ln Cu-Zn SOD and ln TBARS).
No significant differences in oxidative stress biomarkers were found between women who
did and did not report long-term health problems (hospitalization, long-term use of medica-
tion) (t = -1.91, p>0.05 for ln 8-OHdG; t = -0.73, p>0.1 for ln Cu-ZnSOD; t = 0.79, p>0.1 for
ln TBARS). No significant differences were also found between women who did and did not
supplement vitamins (t = -1.35, p>0.1 for ln 8-OHdG; t = -1.63, p>0.1 for ln Cu-Zn SOD; t =
-0.31, p>0.7 for ln TBARS).
In contrast, significant associations were found between levels of oxidative stress biomarkers
and health status parameters measured in blood. In particular, levels of TBARS were negatively
associated with HDL (r = -0.25, p<0.05) and positively associated with GLU level (r = 0.27,

 p<0.01), while levels of 8-OHdG were negatively associated with ESR measured after 2 hours
(r = -0.20, p<0.05).
Significant and robust positive correlations were found between gravidity and all investi-
gated parameters of reproductive effort, namely between parity (r = 0.94, p<0.001), number of
sons (r = 0.67, p<0.001), number of daughters (r = 0.65, p<0.001), lifetime lactation period
(r = 0.57, p<0.001), lifetime reproductive period (r = 0.56, p<0.001) and number of miscar-
riages (r = 0.35, p<0.01). Furthermore, gravidity correlated negatively with age at first birth
(r = -0.24, p<0.02) and positively with age at last birth (r = 0.40, p<0.001). Based on the above
results, gravidity was chosen as a composite measure of reproductive effort.
Oxidative stress in women with low and high reproductive effort
As expected, women with at least four pregnancies during a lifetime (higher gravidity) spent
twice as long being pregnant and triple the amount of time lactating (t = -14.17, p<0.001 for
number of months pregnant; t = -6.53, p<0.001 for number of months lactating). Conse-
quently, they spent almost two times more energy on reproduction than women with lower
gravidity, as indicated by estimated energetic cost of their pregnancies and lactations (t = -5.82,

health status parameters between women from lower vs higher gravidity group are presented
in Table 1.
The multivariate results of MANOVA showed significant effect of low and high gravidity
on the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers (Pillai’s Trace = 0.09, F = 3.28, p<0.05), indicating
that consistent with our prediction, postmenopausal women with higher gravidity had higher
levels of oxidative stress biomarkers than women with lower gravidity. In particular, the uni-
variate F tests results showed significant difference between lower and higher gravidity group
for log-transformed levels of 8-OHdG (F = 5.14, p = 0.025) and Cu-Zn SOD (F = 9.28,
p = 0.003). No difference between those two groups was found for log-transformed TBARS lev-
els (F = 2.24, p = 0.138) (Fig 1).
The observed differences in oxidative stress biomarkers remained significant when factors
such as age and health status parameters (abdominal fat, ESR after 2 hours, GLU and HDL lev-
els) were introduced to MANCOVA models (Pillai’s Trace = 0.09, F = 2.89, p<0.05).

 Consistently, higher gravidity was associated with significantly higher levels of log-transformed
8-OHdG (F = 5.38, p<0.05), and Cu-Zn SOD (F = 8.23, p<0.01). No significant difference
between high and low gravidity group was found for TBARS levels (F = 0.82, p>0.3). Detailed
results of MANCOVA model are presented in Table 2.
Association between biomarkers of oxidative stress and reproductive
effort
Simple regression models confirmed predicted positive association between biomarkers of oxi-
dative stress and gravidity for log-transformed values of 8-OHdG (β = 0.19, p = 0.05), Cu-Zn
SOD (β = 0.27, p<0.01) and TBARS (β = 0.21, p<0.05). Furthermore, results of backward step-
wise multiple linear regression models with age and health status parameters (abdominal fat,
GLU, ESR, HDL) evidenced independent effect of gravidity on the levels of 8-OHdG (R2
adj =
0.06, p<0.02) and Cu-Zn SOD (R2
adj = 0.05, p<0.02). Final model for ln 8-OHdG included
abdominal fat (β = -0.26, p<0.02) and number of pregnancies (β = 0.21, p<0.05) and for ln
Cu-Zn SOD only number of pregnancies (β = 0.25, p<0.02) (Fig 2). Although results of step-
wise regression analysis for TBARS were statistically significant (R2
adj = 0.14, p<0.01) gravidity
was removed from the model in the third step (Fremov = 0.97, p>0.3) leaving GLU and HDL as
the best predictors of ln TBARS in the model (β = 0.28, p<0.01 for GLU and β = -0.25, p<0.02
for ESR).
Results of second order polynomial regression analysis showed no evidence for U-shaped
association between gravidity and levels of oxidative stress biomarkers. Detailed results of the
analysis are presented in Table 3.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that clearly demonstrates higher oxidative stress in
association with elevated lifetime reproductive effort in women. We found that women with
higher lifetime gravidity had nearly 20% higher levels of 8-OHdG, a biomarker of oxidative
damage to DNA, and 60% higher levels of Cu-Zn SOD, a biomarker of antioxidative defense
compared to women with lower gravidity. Moreover, levels of 8-OHdG and Cu-Zn SOD exhib-
ited a linear association with lifetime gravidity suggesting a dose dependent response between
reproductive effort and oxidative stress.
Increased level of DNA oxidation in women with higher gravidity reflects an imbalance
between ROS production and ROS-mediated damage repair, and indicates elevated oxidative
stress in response to increased reproductive effort. Similarly, higher levels of Cu-Zn SOD, the
front-line defense enzyme against reactive oxygen species-mediated injury, indicates higher
ROS production and should be also interpreted as a biomarker of increased oxidative stress

 [22]. While these results might also be construed as reflecting acute differences in oxidative
stress between high and low gravidity women, the lack of differences in lifestyle variables asso-
ciated with oxidative stress makes this unlikely. Instead, we offer that the cumulative effects of
reproductive effort contribute to greater susceptibility to oxidative stress in post-menopausal
women.
In accordance with our results, other studies have shown that levels of oxidative stress bio-
markers increase, while antioxidant capacity decreases, during pregnancy and when compared
to non-pregnant status [31–33]. Moreover, oxidative damage associated with pregnancy may
accumulate with consecutive pregnancies. Oxidative stress index is more than 50% higher and
total antioxidant capacity is about 10% lower in cord blood of multiparous women when com-
pared to primiparous women [20].
Elevated oxidative stress observed in women with higher gravidity might be attributed to
higher energy metabolism associated with the reproductive process. Indeed, as shown in our
sample women with higher gravidity spent over two times more energy on reproduction when

 compared to women with lower gravidity. On average, daily energy requirements rise by about
20% during woman’s pregnancy and up to 50% during lactation [7]. During pregnancy, this
additional energy is utilized to facilitate foetus tissue development and metabolism. In late
pregnancy, about 55% of foetal total glucose utilization is used for oxidation [34]. In addition,
maternal carbohydrate oxidation increases about 30% when compared to postpartum period
[35]. Thus, amplified oxidation during gestation may create an extra burden to maternal oxida-
tive/antioxidative balance and result in increased oxidative stress.
Although convincing evidence does not exist for women, studies in post-partum cows imply
gradual increases in oxidative damage and decreases in antioxidant capacity during the early
process of lactation. These effects on females’ oxidative/antioxidative profiles tend to intensify
during the lactation of consecutive offspring [36–37]. Lactation periods in red squirrels were
associated with an almost 50% increase in daily energy expenditure (DEE), resulting in a 2-fold
increase in oxidative damage compared to the non- lactating period [38].
During lactation in humans, surplus energy is used for breast milk synthesis but glucose oxi-
dation does not differ between lactating and non-pregnant, non-lactating women [39], which
suggests that other sources of fuels are utilized during this period. Indeed, several studies report
high lipid mobilization during lactation [40]. In contrast to glucose, which is a primary source
of free radical production, lipids metabolism produces significantly less ROS [41]. This differ-
ence in fuels utilization may explain why the number of pregnancies but not periods of lacta-
tion was associated with oxidative damage and antioxidative defense in postmenopausal
women in our study.
High reproductive effort might lead to oxidative stress and accumulation of the oxidative
damage, especially when accompanied by elevated physical activity levels that may limit the
energy available for repair mechanisms during the reproductive period [9]. Women from our
rural population devoted a considerable amount of energy to intensive physical work during
their reproductive period as shown by previous studies [16–17]. Seasonal increases in workload
led to a reduction in levels of ovarian steroids, which suggests that energy expenditure associ-
ated with physical activity constituted a biologically significant constraint on women’s energy
budget. On the average, mean energy expenditure for women of reproductive age in this popu-
lation was 10.7 MJ/day. During August, a month with the most demanding physical work,
mean total daily energy expenditure was 2.02 (expressed as a multiple of BMR) [16]. Although
acute physical activity may constitute independent and additional source of oxidative damage,
[42] it is unlikely that physical activity at present had any significant effect on oxidative stress,

 as most of the participating women were unable to maintain high physical activity due to their
advanced age. Instead, we propose that high physical activity during the reproductive period in
addition to high reproductive energy investment might disturb oxidative/antioxidative balance
and generate oxidative damage.
Recently published, critical review on oxidative stress as a cost of reproduction by Speakman
and Garratt [6] concluded that in order to magnify the allocation trade-off more studies should
be conducted in females that are highly challenged during their reproduction by energetically
costly environmental burdens and in females that engage in repeated reproductive attempts. Our
sample of postmenopausal rural women from Poland fulfills both criteria. We demonstrated the
positive association between oxidative stress and reproductive effort, that may evidence the
trade-off, in individuals under high environmental pressure associated with seasonal changes in
physical workload and diet, engaging in several (up to 10) consecutive reproductive episodes. It is
however possible, that the observed variation in oxidative stress may result from completely dif-
ferent source than the trade-off itself. For instance, antagonistic pleiotropic effect of genes may
play a role here as evidenced by our recent study on ApoE4 allele [43]. The ApoE4 allele (at the
ApoE locus, encoding apolipoprotein E) is associated with significantly increased risk of poor
health. We demonstrated that women who carry at least one ApoE4 allele had significantly higher
level of progesterone than women without ApoE4 allele. This result indicates that higher fertility
in women might be associated with increased risk of poor health and possibly higher oxidative
stress via genetic pathway. Moreover, psychosocial stress associated with trauma episodes during
life may also influence level of oxidative stress [44]. Thus future studies investigating the associa-
tion between oxidative stress and reproductive effort should take these factors into account.
The biological significance of the oxidative stress difference between high and low gravidity
remains to be determined. However higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated
with greater mortality in older individuals after controlling for smoking, alcohol consumption,
and other factors that are commonly linked to decreased lifespan [45]. Moreover, Semba et al.
[46] demonstrated that oxidative stress is associated with increased mortality at older ages in
women. Although these investigations used different biomarkers e.g. reactive oxygen metabo-
lites (d-ROM), total thiol levels (TTL) and protein carbonyls, their results suggest that the dif-
ferences in oxidative stress biomarkers found in our study might be indicative of greater risk of
decreased lifespan due to accelerated aging.
Life history theory predicts trade-offs between reproductive effort and longevity when
energy resources are limited [47–48]. Accordingly, lifetime parity was demonstrated to shorten
lifespan in some but not all energetically constrained environments [19, 49–52]. Lifetime parity
and gravidity has been also observed to be a risk factor to many diseases associated with higher
mortality in post reproductive life such as cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer, insulin
resistance, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease [53–56]. Oxidative stress is implicated to play cen-
tral role in pathophysiology of these diseases [57–58]. Our study links these phenomena by
presenting evidence for the oxidative stress as a possible physiological cost of high reproductive
effort in humans.
