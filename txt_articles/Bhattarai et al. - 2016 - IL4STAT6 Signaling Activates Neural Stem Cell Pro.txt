In Brief
Bhattarai et al. shows that adult zebrafish
brain displays Alzheimer’s disease-like
phenotypes after Amyloid-b42 (Ab42)
aggregation. Ab42 can also activate
neural stem cell proliferation and
neurogenesis. Interleukin-4, which
induces STAT6 phosphorylation, is a key
factor for mediating the neuro-immune
crosstalk between diseased neurons,
immune cells, and stem cells.

SUMMARY
Human brains are prone to neurodegeneration,
given that endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells
(NSPCs) fail to support neurogenesis. To investigate
the molecular programs potentially mediating neu-
rodegeneration-induced NSPC plasticity in regen-
erating organisms, we generated an Amyloid-b42
(Ab42)-dependent neurotoxic model in adult zebra-
fish brain through cerebroventricular microinjection
of cell-penetrating Ab42 derivatives. Ab42 deposits
in neurons and causes phenotypes reminiscent of
amyloid pathophysiology: apoptosis, microglial acti-
vation, synaptic degeneration, and learning deficits.
Ab42 also induces NSPC proliferation and enhanced
neurogenesis. Interleukin-4 (IL4) is activated primarily
in neurons and microglia/macrophages in response
to Ab42 and is sufficient to increase NSPC prolifera-
tion and neurogenesis via STAT6 phosphorylation
through the IL4 receptor in NSPCs. Our results reveal
a crosstalk between neurons and immune cells medi-
ated by IL4/STAT6 signaling, which induces NSPC
plasticity in zebrafish brains.
INTRODUCTION
Human brains are prone to neurodegenerative disorders, which
cannot be counteracted by the regeneration of lost cells.
Patients with neurodegenerative conditions progressively lose
neurons yet cannot form new ones; namely, they lack the proper
differentiation/survival response of stem-cell-derived neurons
(Demars et al., 2010). Therefore, inducing a functional ‘‘prolifera-
tion-differentiation-survival cascade’’ upon neurodegenerative
conditions in mammalian neural stem cells, which otherwise
bear neurogenic capacity (Doetsch et al., 1997), could serve as
a therapeutic tool. In nature, several vertebrates such as zebra-
fish bear widespread regenerative ability (Tanaka and Ferretti,
2009), and studies aiming to understand the natural competency
of regeneration in zebrafish would be clinically important.
Inflammatory conditions in neurodegenerative diseases are
multi-faceted and have pleitropic effects on microglia, neurons,
and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) (Das and Basu,
2008; Kizil et al., 2015b). Inflammation has beneficial and detri-
mental effects on stem cells, and this ambiguity could be due
to the automodulatory effects of inflammatory milieu on micro-
glia, which indirectly affect the stem cell behavior (Ekdahl
et al., 2009; Kokaia et al., 2012; Kyritsis et al., 2014; Monje
et al., 2003; Schwartz and Shechter, 2010). There is increasing
evidence that neural stem cells also use immune-type signaling
molecules, which might set up a direct interaction of neurons and
microglia with the neural stem cells (Ben-Hur et al., 2003; Ekdahl
et al., 2009; Kizil et al., 2012a, 2012c; Kyritsis et al., 2012). There-
fore, in vivo assay systems to address the direct role of inflam-
mation on stem cells are necessary. Zebrafish offers an excellent
tool due to its regenerative ability in the CNS (Chapouton et al.,
2007; Kizil et al., 2012b). Also, neurodegeneration models in
adult zebrafish brain could help in investigating whether neural
stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) would be activated and whether
we could find out the molecular differences between zebrafish
and mammalian NSPCs to harness them for regenerative thera-
pies (Cosacak et al., 2015). Thus, we generated a rapid and
reproducible model of neurodegeneration in adult zebrafish
brain using Amyloid-b42 (Ab42), which is the hallmark of
Alzheimer’s disease pathology (Haass and Selkoe, 2007). We
investigated the response of NSPCs after amyloid toxicity and
the molecular programs that could govern this response.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

human Ab42 uncoupled or coupled to two cell-penetrating

 peptides, poly-arginine (R9-Ab42) and transportan (TR-Ab42)
(Kizil et al., 2015a). We detected Ab42 in zebrafish brain at 1,
3, and 14 days post-injection (dpi) (Figures 1A–1D). All peptides
accumulate with different temporal dynamics, TR-Ab42 being
the fastest (Figure 1E). To determine whether coupling Ab42 to
penetrating peptides affected their capacity to form b sheets,
we performed circular dichroism (CD) and aggregation studies
(Figures 1F and S1A–S1G). Although all Ab42 versions form
b sheets, TR-Ab42 is more potent (Figure 1F). TR peptide alone
is also not toxic to the cells (Figures S1H–S1M).
To test whether injected TR-Ab42 would form b sheets, we
performed electron microscopy in TR- (Figures 1G and 1G’) or
TR-Ab42-injected brains (Figures 1H and 1H’). TR-Ab42 forms
intracellular b sheet aggregations and could be used for our sub-
sequent analyses as a new model of amyloidosis.
Ab42 Leads to Neurodegeneration Phenotypes in Adult
Zebrafish Brain
In humans, Ab42 deposition causes cell death (Shaked et al.,
2006), unlike many animal models (Duff et al., 1996). To check
whether TR-Ab42 in adult zebrafish brain (Figures 1I and 1I’)
would cause cell death, we performed TUNEL staining (Figures
1J and 1J’). TR-Ab42 significantly increased apoptosis (Fig-
ure 1M) more than uncoupled Ab42 and R9-Ab42 (Figure S1N).
A hallmark of Ab42 in mammalian models is the activation of
microglia/macrophages (mg/mØ) (Wyss-Coray, 2006). To test
whether in zebrafish mg/mØ would be activated after Ab42 (either
through recruitment from periphery or mobilization of brain-resi-
dent cells), we measured the number and activation state (based
on morphology) of mg/mØ after Ab42 injection (Figures 1K and
1K’). Amyloid deposition significantly and persistently increased
the number of amoeboid mg/mØ after all Ab42 versions (Fig-
ure S1O), but was most pronounced after TR-Ab42 (Figure 1M),
suggesting that Ab42 leads to immune response and pro-inflam-
matory gene expression (Figure S1T) in zebrafish brain.
Ab42 causes synaptic degeneration and memory deficits
in mammalian brains (Selkoe, 2002). To investigate whether
TR-Ab42 in adult zebrafish brain would affect synaptic connec-
tions, we detected synaptophysin after injection of TR-Ab42.
TR-Ab42 reduces synaptophysin-positive synapses (Figures
1L–1M) and synaptic gene expression (Figure S1U), suggesting
that synapses degenerate.
To investigate whether Ab42 accumulates in neurons that
undergo apoptosis, we detected HuC/D, TUNEL, and TR-Ab42
(Figure 1N). Quantification of TUNEL-positive cells showed that
the only significantly increasing cell population was Ab42-
containing neurons (HuC/D-Ab42-TUNEL triple-positive cells)
(Figure 1O), indicating that Ab42-containing neurons specifically
undergo apoptosis after Ab42 injection.
To test the specificity of the toxicity of Ab42, we injected
Ab38—a short Ab peptide not found in patients’ plaques
and having higher solubility than Ab42—or scrambled Ab42
(Figure S1Q). Compared to controls, TR-Ab38 and scrambled
Ab42 did not alter cell death, microglial activation, synaptophy-
sin immunoreactivity, or the homeostatic proliferation of NSPCs
(Figures S1R and S1S), suggesting that, in zebrafish brain, TR-
Ab42 is specifically causing toxicity, cell death, inflammation,
and synaptic loss reminiscent of mammalian brains.
One symptom of Alzheimer’s disease is memory deficits and
cognitive decline (Chen et al., 2000). To examine whether Ab42
in adult zebrafish brain would lead to learning deficits, we per-
formed a passive avoidance test (Figures S2A–S2C). Although
control and TR-Ab42-injected fish swam normally before condi-
tioning (Figure S2D), control fish significantly avoided the side
paired with the electric shock after 3 days of conditioning, while
TR-Ab42-injected fish did not (Figure S2E). The swimming speed
of TR-Ab42-injected fish in the shock-paired compartment was
slower than that of control fish (Figure S2E), suggesting a lower
anxiety response. These results demonstrate that Ab42-medi-
ated neurodegeneration and synaptic loss impairs zebrafish
learning.
Ab42 Leads to NSPC Proliferation and Neurogenesis
Compared to control brains, TR-Ab42 leads to significantly
elevated levels of progenitor cell proliferation (Figures 2A–2C).
Other Ab42 versions, but not Ab38, show this effect to a lesser
extent (Figures S1P–S1S). To investigate whether the increase
in progenitor proliferation leads to neurogenesis, we performed
bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU)
pulse-chase
analyses
labeling
the proliferating cells at earlier phases after TR-Ab42 injection
and determining their progeny (Figures 2D–2G). Compared
to controls, TR-Ab42-injected zebrafish generated significantly
increased numbers of neurons that migrated longer distances
(Figures 2F and 2G). We also tested the effects of Ab42 on
neurogenesis by using a mature neuronal marker, HuC/D (Fig-
ures 2H–2J), and observed a significant increase in the number
of newborn neurons (Figure 2J).
To address whether TR-Ab42-injected fish would regain
learning functions, we performed conditional learning tests at
12 weeks post-injection (wpi) with the same fish used for previ-
ous tests (Figure S2F). The control fish froze after the first electric
shock and could not be experimented on further (data not
shown). TR-Ab42-injected fish failed to fully restore the behav-
ioral phenotype. This suggests that restoration of learning ca-
pacity would either take longer time or more intense conditioning
schemes.
TUNEL, L-plastin, synaptophysin, and S100/PCNA (prolifer-
ating cell nuclear antigen) stainings in a longitudinal manner
from 1 to 30 dpi (Figure S3) showed that cell death, microglial
activation, and synaptic degeneration phenotypes are persis-
tent,
which
coincides
with
increased
NSPC
proliferation.
Newborn neurons also survive for long periods (3 months; Fig-
ures 2K and 2L). Thus, in contrast to human brains, where

 adult zebrafish brain can induce plasticity and neurogenesis,
despite the prevailing toxic environment.
Interleukin-4 Induces Stem Cell Plasticity after Ab42
Aggregation
To determine the changes in gene expression in zebrafish
NSPCs after Ab42 toxicity, we performed transcriptome anal-
ysis. Immune-related signaling pathways were highly enriched
(Figure S1T; Table S1). Therefore, to determine whether mg/mØ
activity is required for enhanced cell proliferation in fish brain,
we injected clodronate liposomes, which kill the mg/mØ (Jenkins
et al., 2011) (Figure 3). After TR-Ab42 and control liposome injec-
tion, the number of mg/mØ increases, and clodronate treatment
reduces the mg/mØ significantly (Figures 3A–3D, 3F, and 3G).
Ab42-induced NSPC proliferation is reduced significantly in
clodronate-injected brains (Figures 3E and 3F’). Additionally,
quantification of the total PCNA-positive cells showed that
overall cell proliferation, which is increased by TR-Ab42, was
reduced to control levels with clodronate. These results indicate
that immune activity is required for induced NSPC plasticity
upon Ab42-induced neurodegeneration in adult zebrafish brain.
Transcriptome analyses showed that interleukin-4 (IL4) is upre-
gulated in fish brain after Ab42 injection (Figure S1T). Compared
to control brains (Figures 4A–4A’’), TR-Ab42 injection induces
IL4 (Figures 4B–4B’’), suggesting that IL4 may constitute a spe-
cific signaling associated with neurodegeneration in zebrafish
brain. We found that neurons and mg/mØ express IL4 (Figures
4C and 4C’) and that the majority of the IL4-positive cells are
Ab42-containing neurons (Figure 4C’). The receptor il4r is ex-
pressed in ventricular cells (Figures 4D–4D’’), suggesting a role
for IL4 in establishing a crosstalk mechanism between NSPCs
and the neurodegenerative milieu.
To test whether IL4 is sufficient to induce proliferation, we in-
jected human IL4 into healthy adult zebrafish brains. Compared
to controls (Figures 4E and 4H), IL4 significantly increased NSPC
proliferation and neurogenesis (Figures 4F, 4G, 4I, and 4J). To
check whether IL4 is necessary for enhanced progenitor cell pro-
liferation, we used an IL4-neutralizing antibody (Acosta-Rodri-
guez et al., 2007), which detects zebrafish IL4 (Figures 4K and
4K’) and, when injected into zebrafish brain, can target the ven-
tricular region containing NSPCs (Figures 4L and 4L’). Compared
to TR-Ab42 injection only, proliferation of NSPCs is reduced after
co-injection of TR-Ab42 and the neutralizing antibody (Figures
4M–4O). To test whether the neutralizing antibody is specifically
acting on IL4, we performed a control experiment where co-
injection of the neutralizing antibody with IL4 into healthy fish
brains resulted in the abrogation of IL4-induced proliferation
(Figures S4A–S4D), suggesting a specific knockdown on IL4.
IL4 is known to induce phosphorylation of transcription factor
STAT6. Compared to control brains (Figure 4P), TR-Ab42 and IL4
induced STAT6 phosphorylation (Figures 4P’ and 4P’’), which
can be blocked by antagonizing IL4 (nIL4ab; Figure 4P’’’).
Thus, STAT6 phosphorylation is downstream to IL4 signaling in
NSPCs in adult zebrafish brain.

Cell Reports 17, 941–948, October 18, 2016
 IL4 acts together with IL13 to form dimers that bind to the IL4
receptor (Wang and Secombes, 2015). To test whether IL13 acts
similarly to IL4 in mediating radial glial cell proliferation in zebra-
fish brain, we injected interleukin-13 (IL13) into healthy brains.
IL13 only slightly increased NSPC proliferation in adult zebrafish
brain (Figures S4E–S4G), suggesting that IL4 is the major
component that regulates progenitor cell proliferation in the
IL4/IL13 signaling pathway.
The knockdown of IL4 receptor using morpholinos led to the
reduction of NSPC proliferation similar to that of the neutralizing
antibody (Figures 4Q–4S). Additionally, expression of IL4 after
Ab42 is reduced by clodronate treatment (Figures 4T and 4U),
and exogenous IL4 significantly increased the reduced NPSC
proliferation after macrophage depletion by clodronate (Figures
4V–4Z). These findings show that Ab42 toxicity induces progen-
itor cells through a neuron-glia-immune crosstalk mediated by
IL4/STAT6 signaling.
To test whether the IL4 signaling is specific to amyloid toxicity,
but not other means of neuronal loss, we checked IL4 expression
in brains that are traumatically lesioned. IL4 is not expressed in
controls, while in lesioned brains, expression is low and in very
few cells that cannot account for a major signaling pathway for
induced regeneration (Figures S4H and S4I). Additionally, a spe-
cific molecular program activated after traumatic lesions in zebra-
fish brain—gata3 expression—is not activated after Ab42-medi-
ated neurodegeneration (Figure S4J), suggesting that different
specific molecular programs could govern the regenerative ability
of zebrafish brain after different modes of neuronal loss. Thus, IL4
signaling might be a specific, but not a generic, type of regenera-
tion response after Ab42-mediated neurodegeneration.
IL4 mediates neuronal survival or microglial dynamics during
neurodegeneration (de Araujo et al., 2009). Microglial expression
of IL4 seems to positively affect hippocampal cell proliferation
(Nunan et al., 2014), while IL4 attenuates Alzheimer-like pheno-
types in APP1/PS1 mice by reducing the microgliosis (Kiyota
et al., 2010), suggesting that the effects of IL4 on NSPCs and
the microglia in constitutive neurogenesis and disease states
differ. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of IL4 is likely to
be indirect on mammalian NSPC proliferation and is due to the
inactivation of microglia, which repress NSPC proliferation in
mammalian brains (Das and Basu, 2008; Ekdahl et al., 2009;
Monje et al., 2003). Thus, the effects of IL4 were mostly related
to altered microglial environment and its effects on NSPCs. How-
ever, our studies show that IL4 directly acts on NSPCs.
In zebrafish, inflammation acts as a ‘‘positive cue’’ for neuro-
regeneration (Kizil et al., 2012a, 2012c, 2015b; Kyritsis et al.,
2012, 2014), while in humans, this is not the case, possibly due
to cumulative effects of positive and negative cues. Zebrafish,
as a valuable reductionist model, thus, could help us to directly
address the role of individual factors on stem cells and distin-
guish the positive and negative inflammatory cues, which could
be tested in mammalian systems to find candidates for clinical
trials. This understanding may help designing regenerative ther-
apies in neurodegenerative environment of human brains by
tweaking the inflammatory milieu and its players, such as IL4.

 Peptide Synthesis
Peptides (Table S2) were synthesized using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
(Fmoc) chemistry with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronoium-
hexafluorphosphate (HBTU) activation on an automated solid-phase peptide
synthesizer (ResPep SL, Intavis). The peptide was cleaved from the resin
with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/tri-isopropylsilane (TIS)/water/DTT (90 [v/v]:
5 [v/v]: 2.5 [v/v]: 2.5 [m/v]) and was precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether.
The peptides were dissolved in 1:1 Milli-Q water:acetonitrile and purified via
reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a semi-prepar-
ative HPLC column (Waters) equipped with a porous polystyrene divinylben-
zene column (PolymerX; bead size, 10 mm, 250 mm 3 10 mm; Phenomenex).
Purity was confirmed by analytical reverse-phase ultra-HPLC (UPLC Aquity
with UV Detector), using an analytical C18 column (bead size, 1.7 mm), and
the peptide products were characterized by electrospray ionization-mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS; ACQUITY TQ Detector) (Figure S1).
CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra were recorded using Chirascan Plus (Applied Photophysics). The
experiments were performed at a 20 mM concentration in water or 10 mM so-
dium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) incubated at 37�C. The spectra were recorded
using a quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm path length in the far-UV range (190–260 nm),
applying a scanning rate of 120 nm/min. For a typical spectrum, five scans
were averaged, and the baseline was corrected.
Light Scattering
The experiments were performed at 20 mM concentration in water or 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Turbidity was measured at room tempera-
ture with orbital shaking in half-area, nonbinding-surface, 384-well plates
(Greiner) on a plate reader (Paradigm, Beckman Coulter). The total volume
was 60 mL, and the experiments were performed in triplicate.
Microinjections
Cerebroventricular microinjections (CVMIs) were performed as described
elsewhere (Kizil and Brand, 2011; Kizil et al., 2015a). 2 mL peptides (20 mM),
PBS, clodronate liposomes (1 mg/mL), and neutralizing antibody for IL4
(Novus Biological; MAB204; 10 mg/mL), human IL4, and IL13 (R&D Sys-
tems, 1 mg/mL) were injected. An antisense morpholino (50-AGGCAAGTA
CAAACACTCACTCATA-30;
Gene
Tools) directed
against
zebrafish
il4r
(ENSDARG00000102583) was injected at a 10 mM concentration.
Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry
Tissue preparations and stainings were performed as previously described
(Kizil et al., 2012c, 2014), using various antibodies (Table S1).

Fish brains were immersed in modified Karnovsky’s fixative (2% glutaralde-
hyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 50 mM HEPES) overnight at 4�C. Samples
were postfixed in 1% OsO4/water for 2 hr on ice, en bloc contrasted with
1% uranyl acetate/water for 2 hr on ice, and dehydrated in a graded series
of ethanol. Brains were infiltrated in epon gradient, embedded in flat embed-
ding molds, and cured at 65�C. Ultrathin sections were prepared with Leica
UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems), collected on formvar-coated slot
grids, stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate as described elsewhere
(Venable and Coggeshall, 1965), and analyzed on a Morgagni 268D transmis-
sion electron microscope (FEI) at 80 kV acceleration voltage.
BrdU Experiments
Zebrafish were immersed in freshly prepared 10 mM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich)
solution in E3 for 8 hr/day at 48 and 72 hours post-infection (hpi). Fish were
sacrificed, and heads were subjected to histological preparations as
described previously (Kizil et al., 2012c).
Imaging and Statistical Analyses
Images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioImager Z1. Only sections between
the caudal end of the olfactory bulb and anterior commissure were counted.
The quantification of the average signal intensities and synaptophysin-positive
synapses were performed using a 3D object counter module of ImageJ
software. Cell counting was performed manually. The statistical evaluation
was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6.02) for one-way ANOVA, fol-
lowed by a Tukey’s post hoc test, and for Student’s t test. Error bars shown
indicate the SEM, and asterisks indicate significance: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
and ***p < 0.001. p > 0.05 is considered not significant (n.s.). Student’s t test
was performed for paired samples, and a t test was performed for independent
measurements.
