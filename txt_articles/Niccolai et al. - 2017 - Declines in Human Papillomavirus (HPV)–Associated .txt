Background. Trends in human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated cervical lesions can provide an indication of vaccine impact. 
Our purpose was to measure trends in cervical lesions during 2008–2015 and to consider possible explanations including vaccina-
tion coverage, changes in screening for cervical cancer, and risk behaviors for acquiring HPV.
Methods. Connecticut (CT) implemented mandatory reporting of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2/3 and adenocar-
cinoma in situ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher [CIN2+]) in 2008. Trends by age and birth cohort were modeled 
using negative binomial regression and change-point methods. To evaluate possible explanations for changes, these trends were 
compared to changes in HPV vaccination coverage, cervical cancer screening, an antecedent event to detection of a high-grade 
lesion, and changes in sexual behaviors and Chlamydia trachomatis, an infection with similar epidemiology to and shared risk factors 
for HPV.
Results. A significant decline in CIN2+ was first evident among women aged 21 years in 2010, followed by successive declines 
in women aged 22–26 years during 2011–2012. During 2008–2015, the rates of CIN2+ declined by 30%–74% among women aged 
21–26 years, with greater declines observed in the younger women. Birth cohorts between 1985 and 1994 all experienced significant 
declines during the surveillance period, ranging from 25% to 82%. Ecological comparisons revealed substantial increases in HPV 
vaccination during this time period, and more modest reductions in cervical cancer screening and sexual risk behaviors.
Conclusions. The age and cohort patterns in our data suggest that declines in CIN2+ during 2008–2015 are more likely driven 
by HPV vaccination, introduced in 2006, than by changes in screening or risk behavior.

Postlicensure monitoring of human papillomavirus (HPV) vac-
cines is important to demonstrate the population-level impact 
on clinical outcomes, to provide data to inform policy and prac-
tice, and to measure progress of immunization programs [1]. 
Using a variety of data sources and approaches, studies from 
Australia, Europe, North America, and New Zealand have 
been largely consistent in showing significant declines in HPV-
related outcomes among young women, particularly in settings 
that have achieved high coverage with HPV vaccines [2–4]. 
Though evidence of the impact of HPV vaccines on cervical 
infections and genital warts is growing, less is known about 
trends in precancerous high-grade cervical lesions [2]. Cervical 
lesions are clinically important outcomes to monitor because 
they are most closely related to the development of cervical can-
cer and because they are diagnoses that incur substantial mor-
bidity, psychological distress, and treatment costs [5, 6].
In countries that have national or regional healthcare and dis-
ease registries (eg, Australia and Denmark), data linkage studies 
are able to examine rates of HPV-associated outcomes in relation 
to individual vaccination status to assess direct effectiveness of vac-
cines [7–11]. Unfortunately, registries for these types of studies are 
not widely available in many settings, including the United States. 
In such areas, evidence of vaccine impact may be assessed by 
examining population-level trends in HPV-associated outcomes 
over time. A strength of this approach is that these trends reflect 
both direct and indirect effects of vaccination [12]. However, a 
challenge with this type of trend analysis is that declines due to 
the vaccine may not be easily disentangled from declines that 
might occur for other reasons. For example, in the United States, 
recent changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines that now 
recommend less frequent screening may also contribute to fewer 
diagnoses of cervical lesions [13]. First put forth in 2009 and 
more widely adopted in 2012, guidelines changed to recommend

no screening prior to age 21 years and to lengthen the screen-
ing interval to every 3 years (instead of annually). Furthermore, 
because HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, declines may also 
be due to underlying changes in sexual behaviors.
We conducted the present analyses to describe trends in cer-
vical lesions in Connecticut (CT) during 2008–2015 by single 
year of age and birth cohort. In CT, as in the rest of the United 
States, HPV vaccination was introduced in 2006 for routine use 
in females aged 11–12 years and catch-up vaccination to age 
26 years. Administration of HPV vaccine is practice-based and 
typically provided in medical offices. All vaccines in use during 
the study period covered HPV types 16 and 18, associated with 
approximately 70% of cervical cancers and approximately 50% 
of high-grade cervical lesions. To disentangle changes associ-
ated with vaccination from other factors that could influence 
reported rates, we also evaluated changes in HPV vaccina-
tion coverage; rates of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing, a necessary 
screening test for the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neo-
plasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+); and changes in the sexual 
behaviors and the rate of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, 
a common sexually transmitted infection that is a marker of 
sexual risk. This analysis makes use of a unique data set from 
the state of CT (population 3.6 million) that enacted mandatory 
reporting of CIN grades 2, 2/3, and 3 and adenocarcinoma in 
situ (CIN2+) in 2008. These data add to our knowledge about 
the population-level impact of HPV vaccines from countries 
with high coverage of >70% for all 3 doses among adolescent 
females by showing trends in a geographic area with moderate 
HPV vaccine coverage of approximately 50% [14]. Furthermore, 
by testing whether the trends in CIN2+ vary by individual years 
of age and by birth cohorts and by examining different possi-
ble explanations for trends (likelihood of detection, underlying 
risk), we may better understand the potential role of HPV vac-
cine impact on cervical lesions in the United States.
METHODS
Surveillance methods have been previously described [15, 
16]. In brief, in 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention began to monitor the impact of HPV vaccination 
through population-based surveillance of CIN2+ conducted by 
the Emerging Infections Program network. To facilitate imple-
mentation in CT, the state’s Department of Public Health added 
CIN2+ to the list of mandatory reportable diseases, effective 1 
January 2008. All 34 pathology laboratories that serve CT res-
idents are in compliance with the reporting requirement. All 
laboratories are regularly contacted to ensure ongoing, com-
plete, and timely reporting, and quality assurance protocols 
include logic and range checks and double data entry for a sub-
set of cases. Pathology laboratories that report >80% of cases 
are routinely audited for completeness. This work has been 
deemed public health surveillance by university, state, and fed-
eral institutional review boards and thus exempt from the need 
for human subjects approval. Population denominators esti-
mated for each year were obtained from the US Census Bureau 
American Community Survey. We restricted these analyses to 
women diagnosed at ages 21–39 years. Age 21 years was used 
for the lower limit because of changes to screening guidelines 
during the surveillance period that no longer recommend cer-
vical cancer screening prior to that age.
We examined changes in rates of CIN2+ by single year of 
age because each subsequent cohort of women will have had a 
greater opportunity to be vaccinated at younger ages and prior 
to natural infections, thus producing declines in the rate of 
CIN2+ in consecutive years. To test whether the year in which 
declines might begin could vary by age, we fit change-point 
models to estimate both the timing of when a decline begins and 
the rate of decline after the change-point [17]. For these change-
point analyses, we used negative binomial regression models, 
where the outcome was the rate of CIN2+ for an age group (sin-
gle years of age). These models were fit separately for each age 
group. Eight alternative regression models were fit, one for each 
year in which the declines could begin: an intercept-only model 
(no trend), and models where the rates were steady and then 
began declining (log) linearly in each year during the period 
2009–2015. The Akaike information criterion scores were used 
to generate a weight for each of these alternative models (bet-
ter-fitting models receive a higher weight), and the predicted 
values and parameter estimates were then averaged together.
Negative binomial regression models were also used to ana-
lyze changes in rates of CIN2+ by birth cohorts. We included 
dummy variables for the birth cohorts and controlled for age in 
years using a cubic spline. The exponentiated regression coeffi-
cient for the dummy variables gave the relative decline in cases 
among the indicated birth cohort compared with the referent 
birth cohort of 1979. Women in this birth cohort were 27 years 
old in 2006 when vaccines were first available in the United 
States and are not likely to have experienced declines attributa-
ble to vaccination because they were not in the recommended 
age group postlicensure.
To explore possible factors that could explain changes in 
CIN2+, we gathered data from other sources for ecological com-
parisons. First, we considered HPV vaccination coverage from 
2 sources. State-specific estimates of coverage were available for 
adolescents aged 13–17 years from the National Immunization 
Survey–Teen, a population-based telephone survey that verifies 
vaccination histories with review of medical provider records 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/about.html). 
National estimates of coverage for women aged 19–26 years were 
available from the National Health Interview Survey, a national 
household in-person survey of the noninstitutionalized US civil-
ian population (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/). Both of these 
sources were used to cover the full age range for which HPV 
vaccination has been recommended. Second, because CIN2+ is 
only detected after an abnormal cervical cancer screening test

such as a Pap test, trends in CIN2+ may also be influenced by 
recent changes to guidelines that now recommend less frequent 
screening (every 3 years instead of annually). Therefore, we esti-
mated the percentage of CT women who reported a Pap test in 
the past year from data available through the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS; https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/). 
BRFSS is a federally funded, population-based national survey 
that collects state-level data about a variety of health status indi-
cators. Data were analyzed for the following age groups to cor-
respond to rates we estimated for CIN2+: 21–24, 25–29, 30–34, 
and 35–39 years during 2008–2014 (the last year for which these 
data are currently available). Finally, we considered changes in 
sexual behaviors, a risk factor for acquiring HPV. State-level data 
on sexual behaviors are readily available from the Youth Risk 
Behavior Surveillance System, a school-based survey of repre-
sentative samples of students in grades 9–12 (https://www.cdc.
gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/). We included measures of ever 
having had sexual intercourse, having had sex with ≥4 persons, 
and not using a condom at last sexual intercourse. We also col-
lected data about C. trachomatis diagnoses that share epidemi-
ologic features with HPV (eg, sexually transmitted, common, 
and disproportionately affecting young women) because these 
estimates are readily available for comparable age groups includ-
ing young adult women. Chlamydia trachomatis is a reportable 
infection, and the number of cases among women in CT by year 
and age were obtained from CT Department of Public Health. 
Data were available for the following standard age groups: 20–24, 
25–29, 30–34, and 35–39 years. Annual counts were available for 
2008 through 2015 and rates estimated by dividing the number 
of cases by the estimated annual population size obtained from 
the US Census Bureau American Community Survey. For all 
measures, we calculated the average annual percentage change 
during the study period years for which data were available.
RESULTS
A total of 15 218 cases of CIN2+ were reported during 2008–
2015 among residents of CT aged 21–39 years (Table 1). The 
total number of cases reported during this surveillance period 
declined from 2163 in 2008 to 1540 in 2015.
Significant declines in CIN2+ after 2008 were observed 
among women between the ages of 21 and 26 years, whereas 
no significant declines were observed among women aged 
≥27 years (Figure 1A and 1B; Supplementary Table 1). The tim-
ing of when declines began varied by single year of age, with 
the earliest significant decline beginning among 21-year-olds 
in 2010 and declines among women aged 22–26 years in 2011 
and 2012. Comparing estimated rates in 2015 with the period 
prior to the change-point in each age group, we observed sta-
tistically significant declines of 74% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 67%–79%) among women aged 21 years, 73% (95% CI,

women aged 25 years, and 30% (95% CI, 13%–46%) among 
women aged 26 years.
Compared to the 1979 birth cohort, the first birth cohort 
to see a significant decline was born in 1985 (22% [95% CI, 
4%–36%]) (Figure 2). Increasingly larger declines were also 
observed in subsequent birth cohorts through 1994 (82% [95% 
CI, 74%–88%]), the last birth cohort for which data were avail-
able during the study period.
Ecological comparisons are presented in Table 2. Among 
women aged 21–24 years, rates of CIN2+ declined by 14.8% per 
year, concomitant with a 1.6% per year decrease in Pap screen-
ing and <1% annual change in reported C. trachomatis rates. 
Sexual risk behaviors including ever having had sex and hav-
ing had sex with ≥4 people decreased among adolescents in CT 
during this time period (declines of 3.1% and 7.4% per year). 
HPV vaccination coverage with at least 1 dose increased 6.7% 
per year among adolescents aged 13–17 years in CT during 
2008–2015 and 18.0% per year among females aged 19–26 years 
in the United States during 2010–2014.
DISCUSSION
We found that rates of precancerous high-grade cervical lesions 
declined significantly and substantially among women aged 
21–26 years in CT during 2008–2015, with the earliest and larg-
est declines occurring among younger women. Birth cohorts 
that experienced significant declines began in 1985 and con-
tinued with larger declines through 1994. These results build 
on a small but growing body of research in the United States 
on trends in CIN2+ [18, 19] by using more robust analytic 
approaches of examining individual years of age and change-
point regression models, and by considering other possible fac-
tors that could be contributing to trends in CIN2+.
In places like the United States where data linkage studies 
with immunization registries are not generally possible, inter-
pretation of these trends requires consideration of other pos-
sible explanations in addition to HPV vaccine impact. One 
possible explanation for declines in high-grade cervical lesions 
is that changes in screening guidelines for cervical cancer now 
recommend less frequent screening among women included 
in our analysis [13]. The extent to which these guidelines, first 
recommended in 2009 and adopted more widely by 2012, have 
been implemented in practice is likely to vary and has not 
yet been fully described. Using population-based survey data 
(BRFSS), we noted only a 1.6% annual decline in screening 
among women aged 21–24 in CT during 2008–2014, during 
which time CIN2+ declined in this age group by 14.8% per 
year. Additionally, the patterns of sequential declines by age 
and birth cohort suggest that the declines are not principally 
driven by changes in screening, which might be expected to 
affect all age groups similarly. Thus, it is not likely that changes 
in screening can fully explain the decline in CIN2+. The rela-
tively small decline in screening in this age group could reflect 
the new guidelines to begin screening at age 21 years; thus, all 
women in this age group should have a Pap smear. We are not 
aware of other published estimates of changes in screening by 
comparable age groups (eg, 21–24 years, 25–29 years, or even 
individual year of age). Such data would be very useful to inter-
preting trends in precancerous cervical lesions. Furthermore, 
we note that our observations are consistent with data from 
other countries, including Australia and Denmark, that experi-
enced comparable declines in high-grade cervical lesions after

HPV vaccine introduction in the absence of similar changes to 
screening recommendations during the same period [20–22].
Changes in sexual risk behaviors are also not likely to explain 
the declines we observed in CIN2+. Rates of C. trachomatis 
among women aged 20–24 years in CT remained steady during 
2008–2015 while rates of CIN2+ were declining significantly 
and substantially. Though reported rates of C. trachomatis 
may be influenced not only by sexual risk behaviors but also 
by changes in diagnostic, screening, and reporting practices 
[23], and screening practices may vary by age, these data do not 
provide compelling evidence of substantial reductions in the 
likelihood of acquiring HPV during the study period. We also 
examined sexual behaviors among high school students that 
revealed declines in risk, but not of a comparable magnitude to 
changes in rates of CIN2+. These data are somewhat limited for 
comparison due to the different age groups.
During the study period, declines in rates of CIN2+ among 
young women were accompanied by substantial increases in 
HPV vaccination coverage, among both adolescent and young 
adult females. Furthermore, the pattern and timing of the 
declines we observed are consistent with HPV vaccine impact 
as evidenced by the changes observed for individual years of 
age and birth cohorts. Each year, as more women who had the 
opportunity to be vaccinated as young adolescents (prior to 
sexual exposure to HPV) age into the high-risk group for cervi-
cal lesions, we expect progressive declines in the rate of disease 
by individual year. This is consistent with our results. Previous 
studies that examined trends in high-grade cervical lesions did 
not report data by individual years of age or birth cohorts but 
rather broader age categories (eg, 21–29 years) that likely con-
found the effects of vaccine impact and changes to cervical can-
cer screening guidelines [16, 24].
Our findings should be interpreted in light of certain con-
siderations. First, this is an ecological analysis that does not 
include vaccination histories for cases. Other study designs 
such as vaccine effectiveness studies that compare vaccina-
tion histories at the individual level between women with and 
without HPV-related outcomes are also important approaches 
and should be conducted when possible. However, an impor-
tant strength of our design is that it measures population-level 
impact and can assess both direct and indirect effects of vac-
cination, thereby capturing any possible effect of herd immu-
nity. Second, the extent to which these findings that are specific 
to CT may apply to other regions of the United States is not 
known. Finally, some of our ecological measures are not directly 
comparable due to limitations in available data sources such as 
different age groups, years, and/or regions.
Our results add to the small but growing body of literature about 
trends in CIN2+, an important clinical outcome, since introduc-
tion of HPV vaccines. Though it is encouraging that declines in 
CT have been achieved with only moderate vaccine coverage, 
these results should promote renewed efforts to increase vaccina-
tion coverage to achieve the vaccines full prevention potential.
