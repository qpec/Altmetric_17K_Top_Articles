Chronic inflammation contributes to a wide range of human
diseases, and environments in infancy and childhood are impor-
tant determinants of inflammatory phenotypes. The underlying
biological mechanisms connecting early environments with the
regulation of inflammation in adulthood are not known, but
epigenetic processes are plausible candidates. We tested the
hypothesis that patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm) in inflam-
matory genes in young adulthood would be predicted by early life
nutritional, microbial, and psychosocial exposures previously asso-
ciated with levels of inflammation. Data come from a population-
based longitudinal birth cohort study in metropolitan Cebu, the
Philippines, and DNAm was characterized in whole blood samples
from 494 participants (age 20–22 y). Analyses focused on probes in
114 target genes involved in the regulation of inflammation, and
we identified 10 sites across nine genes where the level of DNAm
was significantly predicted by the following variables: household
socioeconomic status in childhood, extended absence of a parent
in childhood, exposure to animal feces in infancy, birth in the dry
season, or duration of exclusive breastfeeding. To evaluate the bio-
logical significance of these sites, we tested for associations with a
panel of inflammatory biomarkers measured in plasma obtained at
the same age as DNAm assessment. Three sites predicted elevated
inflammation, and one site predicted lower inflammation, consis-
tent with the interpretation that levels of DNAm at these sites are
functionally relevant. This pattern of results points toward DNAm as
a potentially important biological mechanism through which devel-
opmental environments shape inflammatory phenotypes across the
life course.

nflammation plays a central role in immune defenses against
infectious disease (1), but dysregulated or chronic, low-grade
inflammatory processes contribute to the pathophysiology of a
wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type
2 diabetes, and autoimmune/atopic conditions (2, 3). Inflam-
matory activity is also central to normal pregnancy, but dysre-
gulated inflammation can contribute to pregnancy complications
and adverse birth outcomes (4, 5). The factors that influence the
regulation of inflammation are therefore relevant to clinical
practice, and they are of central interest to current research in
genomics and immunology as well as epidemiology, demography,
and psychobiology (6–11).
Recent empirical work has identified environments in infancy
and early childhood as important determinants of inflammatory
phenotypes, and concepts from life history theory and ecological
immunology have provided a theoretical basis for anticipating
these associations (12–14). Individuals born at lower birth
weight, and infants who are breastfed for shorter durations, have
higher concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP)—a key bio-
marker of inflammation—as adults (15–19). Higher levels of
microbial exposure in infancy are associated with reduced levels
of chronic inflammation in adulthood (18, 20), consistent with
broader human and animal model literatures showing that mi-
crobial exposures during sensitive periods of immune develop-
ment have lasting beneficial effects on the regulation of inflammation
(21–23). In addition, an emerging body of research in developmental
psychobiology reports that major psychosocial stressors (e.g., child
neglect, extended parental absence) and socioeconomic adversity
in childhood are associated with dysregulated and proinflammatory
activity in adulthood (15, 24–26).
Although the underlying biological mechanisms that connect
early nutritional, microbial, and psychosocial environments with
adult inflammatory phenotypes are not known, epigenetic pro-
cesses are likely candidates for preserving cellular memories of
early experience in the immune system. Indeed, recent human
studies suggest that socioeconomic and psychosocial environ-
ments in infancy and childhood leave a molecular imprint that
has lasting effects on genomic regulation and the developing
phenotype (27–30). Of the many marks contributing to the epi-
genome, DNA methylation (DNAm) has been the major focus of
human research and involves the covalent linkage of methyl
groups to cytosine residues primarily in the context of CpG
dinucleotides. Methylation of sites in gene promoter regions
Significance
Environments in infancy and childhood influence levels of in-
flammation in adulthood—an important risk factor for multiple
diseases of aging—but the underlying biological mechanisms
remain uncertain. Using data from a unique cohort study in the
Philippines with a lifetime of information on each participant,
we provide evidence that nutritional, microbial, and psycho-
social exposures in infancy and childhood predict adult levels
of DNA methylation—biochemical marks on the genome that
affect gene expression—in genes that regulate inflammation.
We also show that DNA methylation in these genes relates to
levels of inflammatory biomarkers implicated in cardiovascular
and other diseases. These results suggest that epigenetic
mechanisms may partially explain how early environments
have enduring effects on inflammation and inflammation-
related diseases.

ANTHROPOLOGY
 limits access of transcriptional machinery and is typically asso-
ciated with reduced gene expression, whereas methylation within
gene bodies often is associated with enhanced expression (31).
The potential biological relevance of these processes is under-
scored by several studies documenting associations between
DNAm and expression of genes involved in the regulation of
inflammation as well as biomarkers of inflammation and risk for
inflammation-related disorders (30, 32, 33).
Few studies possess the range and time depth of prospectively
collected measures needed to test the hypothesis that nutritional,
microbial, and psychosocial environments early in development
predict patterns of DNAm in inflammatory genes in adulthood.
In addition, current understandings of the regulation of inflam-
mation are based almost exclusively on studies with animal
models and with human participants residing in affluent, industrial-
ized settings like the United States (34, 35). A broader perspective is
important, as 81% of the world’s population resides in low- and
middle-income nations (36), where rates of inflammation-related
diseases—including cardiovascular, metabolic, atopic, and autoim-
mune diseases—are rapidly rising (37). The limited variation in
microbial, nutritional, and socioeconomic environments in samples
drawn from affluent, industrialized settings may constrain investi-
gations into important developmental determinants of inflammatory
phenotypes (35).
We use data from a long-term birth cohort study in the Philippines
to address both these limitations. Data collection began in 1983,
and DNAm as well as concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers
were assessed in blood samples collected in 2005, when partici-
pants were ∼21 y old. In addition to the prospective design, an
advantage of the study is the relatively wide range of ecological
variation represented by the sample: Participants were born into
areas that were classified as urban residential, congested urban
poor, peri-urban, and remote rural (38). In 1983, approximately
half the homes had electricity, more than three-quarters collected
water from an open source, and less than half used a flush toilet
(18). Furthermore, the study initially focused on detailed and
frequent assessment of the contextual determinants of maternal
and infant health. Beginning with the first interview of the mother
during pregnancy and continuing through the offspring’s infancy
and childhood, careful attention was given to detailed measure-
ment of proximate nutritional, microbial, psychosocial, and socio-
economic exposures of relevance to growth and development.
We implemented a hypothesis-driven investigation of the as-
sociation between DNAm in young adulthood and early life
environmental exposures. Analyses focused on methylation sites
in 114 target genes shown previously to regulate inflammation,
which were identified before statistical analyses. The rationale
for our targeted analytic approach was twofold. First, limiting
our analysis to genes involved in the regulation of inflammation
takes advantage of existing knowledge and increases statistical
power for detecting meaningful biological associations. Second,
venous blood sampling provides access to the tissue of interest—
immune cells that increase and decrease inflammation—where
patterns of DNAm in regulatory regions are most likely to have
functional relevance for inflammation due to the tissue-specific
nature of epigenetic processes (39).
We hypothesized that measures of early life environmental
exposures, identified in prior research as important to shaping
inflammatory phenotypes, would be significant predictors of
DNAm in young adulthood. To evaluate the functional relevance
of associations between early environments and DNAm, we
considered whether differentially methylated sites predicted
concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, measured concur-
rently in young adulthood. Our analyses identified 10 differen-
tially methylated sites across nine genes, four of which were
associated with a composite measure of inflammation. These
results provide support for DNAm as a biological mechanism
through which experiences early in life may have lasting effects
on the regulation of inflammation.
Results
DNAm was characterized in 494 participants with the Illumina
450K array, using DNA extracted from cells in antecubital whole
blood, collected by venipuncture when participants were 20.9 y of
age (range, 20–22 y). Analyses focused on 222 variable probes in
114 genes (Tables S1 and S2) (40). Before statistical analysis,
DNAm values were corrected for interindividual differences in
blood cell type composition, bioinformatically derived from
450K DNAm profiles (41).
We hypothesized that measures of nutritional, microbial,
psychosocial, and socioeconomic exposures early in life—selected
before statistical analyses—would predict DNAm in inflammatory
genes in adulthood (Table 1). For each probe, we fit linear re-
gression models with parametric Bayes smoothing and included
participant sex as a covariate. Multiple comparisons were accoun-
ted for by controlling false discovery rate (FDR) with the Benjamini
and Hochberg step-up procedure (42), and probes with adjusted
P values less than 0.15 are reported in Table 2. Overall, we iden-
tified 10 sites across nine genes where DNAm was associated with
early life exposures (Fig. 1) (coefficients for all 222 probes are
presented in Dataset S1).
Household socioeconomic status was indicated by the number
of physical assets owned by the family in infancy and childhood,
which provides a more stable measure of socioeconomic adversity
than income reports in low-income settings (43). Having fewer
household assets was associated with lower DNAm for a probe
located in the first intron of C1S and higher DNAm for a probe in
the promoter region of GNG2. Another measure of adversity in
childhood—extended absence of the participant’s mother or fa-
ther (24)—was also associated with DNAm. Parental absence
predicted higher DNAm in EGR4, in a site located in the 3′ un-
translated region in the second exon. Parental absence was not sig-
nificantly associated with household assets (3.3 assets with parental
absence vs. 3.0 without; t = –1.47, P = 0.14).
We considered the hypothesis that three measures of micro-
bial exposures in infancy—frequency of infectious diarrhea, ex-
posure to animal feces in the home, and season of birth—would
predict DNAm. Previously, all three measures were shown to
predict adult CRP in this population (18), and they are only
moderately intercorrelated. The Philippines is a highly seasonal
tropical environment, and the frequency of infectious diarrhea in
infancy was positively correlated with birth in the dry season
(Pearson R = 0.14, P = 0.002) and frequency of exposure to
animal feces (R = 0.11, P = 0.02). Season of birth and exposure
to animal feces were not correlated (R = 0.01, P = 0.78).
Exposure to animal feces significantly predicted DNAm for
three sites across two genes: CD8A and APBA2. For each probe,
increased frequency of fecal exposure was associated with less
methylation. Both probes for CD8A are located in a CpG island
in the promoter region, whereas the APBA2 probe is located in
the second intron, in a high-density CpG shore. Birth in the dry
season predicted higher DNAm for a probe in the first exon,
5′ UTR of IL-1A, and for another probe in the third intron of
Table 1.

 PIK3C2B. Frequency of infectious diarrhea in infancy was not
associated with DNAm in any of the target genes.
Mode of feeding is a defining component of the postnatal
nutritional environment, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding
predicted DNAm for two sites associated with TLR1 and
SULT1C2. Breastfeeding duration was positively associated with
DNAm in the second intron 5′ UTR of TLR1 and negatively
associated with DNAm in the first exon, 5′ UTR of SULT1C2.
There were no significant associations between participant birth
weight (adjusted for gestational age) and DNAm in young
adulthood at any of the sites considered.
To evaluate functional biological relevance, we tested for as-
sociations between DNAm at sites identified in Table 2 and in-
flammatory biomarkers measured in plasma collected during the
same blood draw as the methylation analysis: CRP, IL-6, TNFα,
IL-10, IFNγ, IL-1β, and IL-8. Due to the level of intercorrelation
across the markers (Table S3), we constructed a summary index
averaging standardized values; this approach also reduced the
probability of type 1 error. Higher DNAm at sites in C1S and
PIK3C2B predicted significantly lower overall levels of in-
flammation, with a trend toward lower inflammation with higher
DNAm in EGR4 (Fig. 2). Inflammation was positively associated
with DNAm in TLR1. Patterns of association between DNAm
and each of the inflammatory markers in the index are presented
as supplementary material (Table S4). The magnitude of many
associations was substantial, with cytokine concentrations that
differed by 8.3–75.0% for individuals with low versus high levels
of DNAm at the identified sites (Fig. S1).
In these analyses, we inferred that differential methylation was
contributing to differences in inflammatory biomarker pro-
duction within our sample. However, the reverse process is
possible, in which increases in inflammation can affect DNAm in
white blood cells (44). To evaluate this scenario, we reran our
models with early life exposures and DNAm for the probes
identified in Table 2, adding the inflammation index as a cova-
riate. If inflammatory processes are more causally proximate to
early life exposures, then associations between these exposures
and DNAm should be attenuated in the presence of adjustment
for inflammatory biomarkers. Coefficients were virtually identical,
suggesting that inflammation does not account for the association
between early exposures and DNAm (Table S5).
Individual genetic differences can contribute to patterns of
DNAm and may confound associations with early environmental
exposures (45). To determine whether this was a factor in our
analysis, we reran our models including the top three principal
components of genetic variation, as previously derived for this
population (46). Adjusting for the principal components did not
alter the magnitude or significance of associations reported in
Table 2, indicating that our results are not likely to be con-
founded by genetic factors (Table S6).
Discussion
Developmental plasticity and ecological sensitivity are defining
characteristics of the human immune system (12), but the
mechanisms shaping the development and regulation of in-
flammation are poorly understood. Prior research, in a wide
range of ecological settings, suggests that nutritional, microbial,
and psychosocial exposures during sensitive periods of immune
development have lasting effects on inflammation (10, 16, 18,
19). In this study, we use a prospective design to link these expo-
sures with patterns of DNAm in inflammatory genes in young
adulthood, providing evidence that DNAm may be an important

ANTHROPOLOGY
 epigenetic mechanism through which early environments have en-
during effects on inflammatory phenotypes. We also show that
variations in DNAm relate to expression of inflammatory bio-
markers implicated in a host of prevalent chronic diseases, under-
scoring the potential public health significance of these results.
Our analyses focused on target genes known to be involved in
the regulation of inflammation, and we identified 10 CpG sites
across nine genes that were predicted by developmental envi-
ronments. The most statistically significant associations were for
sites in the C1S and GNG2 genes, which were predicted by
household assets, a measure of socioeconomic adversity in in-
fancy/childhood. C1S is a protein-coding gene that contributes to
the production of C1, the first component of the classical path-
way of the complement system, and GNG2 produces proteins
that are involved with transmembrane signaling mechanisms.
Similarly, we identified parental absence—a different type of
childhood adversity—as a significant predictor of DNAm in the
EGR4 gene. EGR4 is a protein coding gene and transcription
factor that regulates cell proliferation and proinflammatory cyto-
kine production. These results are consistent with several studies
documenting associations between early life socioeconomic status
and DNAm in adulthood, drawing on samples from the United
States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Italy (30, 47–49), and with a
recent study in the United States showing that higher levels of
stress in infancy/early childhood are biologically embedded in the
epigenome (27). Our study reports associations between early
adversity and DNAm in adulthood in a non-Western, lower income
setting. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with experimental
animal models documenting durable effects of maternal separation
on the regulation of inflammation (50–52).
A unique advantage of our study is the depth of prospectively
collected data on more proximate environmental factors, be-
ginning in infancy. As hypothesized, exposure to animal feces
and season of birth—two proxy measures of the intensity and
diversity of microbial encounters in infancy—predicted DNAm
at five sites across four genes. Increased animal feces exposure
was associated with reduced DNAm at two promoter sites in
CD8A and one upstream site in a high-density CpG shore in
APBA2. APBA2 encodes a protein that interacts with amyloid
precursor protein and is involved in signal transduction processes.
As part of the T-cell receptor complex, CD8A recognizes an-
tigens and initiates phosphorylation cascades that lead to the
activation of transcription factors such as NFAT, NF-κB, and
AP-1, all of which play important roles in the regulation of
inflammation. We document strong, negative associations be-
tween intensity of exposure to animal feces in infancy and
DNAm at two sites in the CD8A promoter, ∼300 bp apart, which
are associated with a DNase hypersensitivity cluster. The po-
tential significance of this finding is underscored by the consis-
tent pattern of DNAm in two neighboring sites, the likely
regulatory role of the gene region, and the established impor-
tance of the T-cell receptor complex to immune activity.
Birth in the dry season predicted higher DNAm in the first
exon, 5′ UTR region of IL-1A and the third intron of PIK3C2B.
Both CpG sites are located in regions marked by increased
chromatin accessibility, DNase hypersensitivity, and transcrip-
tion factor binding sites. IL-1A produces a cytokine in the in-
terleukin 1 family (IL-1α) that is involved in several immune and
inflammatory processes. PIK3C2B is a protein coding gene that
plays roles in signal pathways related to cell proliferation, sur-
vival, and migration.
The pattern of associations between postnatal microbial ex-
posures and methylation of inflammatory genes underscores the
relevance of epigenetic processes to the “hygiene” or “old
friends” hypotheses, which link the development of immuno-
regulatory pathways to microbial environments early in devel-
opment (22, 53). More specifically, our findings are consistent
with experimental animal models documenting negative associ-
ations between early exposure to microbes/microbial products
and inflammatory processes later in life (54–56). Similarly, a rel-
atively recent study in the Gambia has reported an association
between season of birth and DNAm of metastable epialleles (57),
while our analysis reports an association between season of birth
and DNAm of genes involved in the regulation of inflammation.
Longer durations of breastfeeding in infancy have been asso-
ciated with reduced inflammation in adulthood (19), and we
identified sites in two genes where breastfeeding duration pre-
dicted levels of DNAm. Breastfeeding duration was negatively
associated with DNAm in the 5′ UTR region of SULT1C2, which
encodes a protein in the SULT1 subfamily that facilitates sulfate
conjugation of phenol-containing compounds. Breastfeeding
duration predicted higher DNAm in the 5′ UTR region of TLR1,
which is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family that is
centrally involved in pathogen recognition and the activation of
innate immune processes, including inflammation. The TLR
family is highly conserved and widely expressed on immune cells,
and TLR1 forms a cluster with TLR2 and CD14 to recognize
bacterial lipoproteins and transduce signals that lead to NF-κB
activation, cytokine production, and the inflammatory response
(58). Prior research has documented associations between
breastfeeding and DNAm in the LEP gene (59), while our study
links breastfeeding with DNAm in immunoregulatory genes (19).
The range and time depth of measures in our study are major
strengths, but the design does not include direct measures of
gene expression, making it more difficult to infer the functional
consequences of varying levels of DNAm at the identified sites.
Similarly, the pattern of association with inflammatory bio-
markers is not consistent for all sites, and we document associ-
ations between 4 of 10 DNAm sites and production of inflammatory
biomarkers. Prior research has documented stronger associations
between DNAm and inflammatory biomarkers in stimulated sam-
ples than in basal samples (47), suggesting that our tests of as-
sociation between DNAm and inflammation in nonstimulated
samples may represent a conservative estimate of the functional
significance of the identified sites. Additional research is needed
to determine the extent to which DNAm directly mediates
transcriptional activity at these sites or, alternatively, whether it
serves as a marker for other regulatory processes. The use of
in vivo or ex vivo experimental protocols (e.g., vaccination, cell
culture systems) to stimulate and measure the inflammatory re-
sponse would provide better indicators of the inflammatory mi-
lieu, however the logistics of our field location precluded this
approach. Despite these limitations, single measures of baseline
concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers have been shown to
predict increased risk for the onset of cardiovascular, metabolic,

 and other diseases linked to inflammation (2, 3), attesting to
their biological and clinical significance.
Another potential limitation of our study is the use of methyl-
ation data to estimate and adjust for blood cell composition in the
absence of direct cell counts. Although this bioinformatic ap-
proach has been validated for use with whole blood samples (41,
60), the possibility of residual confounding by cell composition
remains. In addition, we measured DNAm and inflammatory cyto-
kines concurrently and conceptualized cytokine production as a
downstream consequence of differential methylation in immuno-
regulatory genes. Because our study design precludes formal
mediation analyses, we cannot rule out the possibility that in-
creases in inflammation are causing changes in DNAm. Our tests
of reverse causality suggest this is not the case, although they are
limited by the cross-sectional measures and the mixed pattern of
association between inflammatory biomarkers and DNAm in our
sample. Lastly, we rely on proxy—rather than direct—measures of
microbial exposure that are only moderately correlated. The dis-
tinct pattern of results for season of birth and exposure to animal
feces may be attributable to this fact, and additional research is
needed to determine the timing of microbial exposure and the
types of exposures that impact DNAm in inflammatory genes.
Recent studies demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms can in-
fluence patterns of DNAm as well as moderate patterns of asso-
ciation between environmental exposures, DNAm, and phenotypic
outcomes (45, 61). In our analyses, we determined that adjusting
for principal components of genetic variation did not alter associ-
ations between early environmental exposures and DNAm, but this
is a relatively limited test of genetic confounding that does not
consider the potential role of specific genes in moderating patterns
of association. Future research should consider the possibility of
interactions between early environmental exposures and allelic
variation in shaping DNAm and the regulation of inflammation.
Our results contribute to a rapidly growing body of literature
investigating the importance of early life environments to the
regulation of inflammation later in life (35). They point to
DNAm as a potentially important biological mechanism through
which nutritional, microbial, psychosocial, and socioeconomic
exposures impact inflammatory phenotypes across the life course.
These findings highlight specific genes that may be particularly
promising foci for future research, and they contribute to the
emerging emphasis on epigenetic processes in the developmental
origins of health and disease (62–66).

participants in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS),
an ongoing birth cohort study in the Philippines (see SI Materials and
Methods for additional information on identification of study participants).
The study began in 1983 with the recruitment of a community-based sample
of 3,327 pregnant women, and home visits were made before birth, im-
mediately following birth, and every 2 mo for 2 y (38). A follow-up survey in
2005 included the collection of venous blood, when the participants were
20–22 y of age. All data were collected and analyzed under conditions of
informed consent with institutional review board approvals from the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Northwestern University, and the
University of British Columbia.
DNAm. Overnight fasting blood samples were collected into EDTA-coated
vacutainer tubes and kept in coolers on ice packs for no more than 2 h
during transport to a central facility, where samples were centrifuged to
separate plasma and white blood cells before freezing at –70 °C. Genomic
DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite (Zymo Research), and converted DNA
was applied to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip using the
manufacturer’s standard conditions (Illumina Inc.). Additional details on
laboratory procedures, quality control analyses, and data processing are
provided in SI Materials and Methods. Proportions of blood cell types were
predicted using a previously established algorithm, and variance associated
with cell composition was removed before statistical analyses (41, 60).
Data Analysis. The following independent variables were considered as
measures of the early life nutritional, microbial, and psychosocial environ-
ment: birth weight (measured in the home immediately after delivery);
duration of exclusive breastfeeding (based on maternal reports collected in
the home during bimonthly interviews); frequency of infectious diarrhea,
birth to 24 mo (maternal report during bimonthly interviews); exposure to
animal feces, 6–12 mo (interviewer observation during bimonthly inter-
views); birth in the dry season (February through April; indicator of higher
levels of microbial exposure in early infancy) (18); and household assets in
infancy and childhood [sum of items, averaged across four surveys; extended
absence of the participant’s mother or father in childhood (up to ∼11 y of
age)] (additional details on variable construction and validation are pro-
vided in SI Materials and Methods).
Tests of association between early environments and DNAm were limited
to highly variable methylation sites in target genes involved in the regulation
of inflammation (Table S1). Target genes were identified using a web-based
gene network and functional annotation tool (genemania.org/) and review
of prior human studies investigating the genetic and epigenetic control of
inflammation (30, 48, 67–70) (additional details on target gene selection are
provided in SI Materials and Methods). A total of 249 target genes were
identified. Probes were matched to target genes based on proximity of the
nearest transcription start site (71), resulting in 5,152 probes, which were then
filtered to exclude probes for which variability in beta-values between the 10th
and 90th percentiles was <10% (72). The final dataset included beta-values for
222 variable probes across 114 target genes (Table S2 and Dataset S2). Beta-
values were converted to M-values before statistical analysis (73).
For hypothesis testing, probe-wise variance was determined by fitting
linear regression models and applying a parametric empirical Bayes smoothing
formula using the R bioconductor package limma (74). All models adjusted for
participant sex. We accounted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini
and Hochberg step-up procedure for controlling FDR, with q = 0.05 (42). For
exploratory purposes and to capture associations of potential biological rele-
vance, we report all associations with adjusted P values < 0.15. To evaluate the
functional relevance of identified sites, we tested for associations between
these sites and the following inflammatory biomarkers quantified in the same
set of blood samples used to measure DNAm: CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFNγ,
and TNFα (see SI Materials and Methods for additional information on
statistical analyses).
