Background
Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure.
Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve
knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression.
Objectives
1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological,
pharmacological, and/or other therapies.
2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression.
Search methods
We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR; from
inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/
Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL),
Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP),
ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research
Theses (DART)-Europe E-theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to
7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject
experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the
“Awaiting classification” section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate.

Music therapy for depression (Review)

 Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU),
psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated
standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic.
Main results
We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta-analysis examining
short-term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate-quality evidence of large effects
favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.69 to -
0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n =
142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy
plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone
for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low-quality evidence). We found no significant
discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n =
293, moderate-quality evidence). Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short-term
beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy
versus psychological therapies on clinician-rated depression (SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality
evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low-quality evidence), quality
of life (SMD -1.31, 95% CI - 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low-quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI
0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate-quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and
anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician-rated depressive symptoms (SMD -
0.52, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), patient-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -
1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-quality evidence), quality of life (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low-
quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing
adverse events, functioning, or anxiety.
Authors’ conclusions
Findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that music therapy provides short-term beneficial effects for people with depression.
Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally,
music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in
decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals.
Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers
should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression. It is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the
comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes.

Music therapy for depression
Why is this review important?
Depression is a common problem that causes changes in mood and loss of interest and pleasure. Music therapy, an intervention that
involves regular meetings with a qualified music therapist, may help in improving mood through emotional expression. This review
might add new information about effects of music therapy in depressed individuals.
Who will be interested in this review?
Our review will be of interest for the following people: people with depression and their families, friends, and carers; general practitioners,
psychiatrists, psychologists, and other professionals working in mental health; music therapists working in mental health; and mental
health policy makers.

 What questions does this review aim to answer?
1. Is music therapy more effective than treatment as usual alone or psychological therapy?
2. Is any form of music therapy better than another form of music therapy?
Which studies were included in the review?
We included nine studies with a total of 421 people of any age group (from adolescents to older people). Studies compared effects
of music therapy versus treatment as usual, and versus psychological therapy. Additionally, we examined the differences between two
different forms of music therapy: active (where people sing or play music) and receptive (where people listen to music).
What does evidence from the review tell us?
We found that music therapy plus treatment as usual is more effective than treatment as usual alone. Music therapy seems to reduce
depressive symptoms and anxiety and helps to improve functioning (e.g. maintaining involvement in job, activities, and relationships).
We are not sure whether music therapy is better than psychological therapy. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is
better than another. The small numbers of identified studies and participants make it hard to be confident about these comparisons.
What should happen next?
Music therapy for depression is likely to be effective for people in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Music therapy also
helps people to function in their everyday life. However, our findings are not complete and need to be clarified through additional
research. Future trials should study depression in children and adolescents, and future trial reports should thoroughly describe music
therapy interventions, other interventions, and the person who delivers these interventions.

Music therapy for depression (Review)

 B A C K G R O U N D
Description of the condition
Depression is a mood disorder and a common mental illness that
affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Depression is
projected to become the leading cause of disability by the year
2020. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide, and it has been
linked to approximately 800,000 cases of suicide per year (WHO
2017).
Depression is characterised by core symptoms of persistent low
mood, diminished interest, loss of pleasure, and lack of energy,
along with other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, appetite and
weight disturbance, poor concentration, psychomotor changes,
and feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and low self-esteem (WHO
1992). Affective disturbance is at the core of depression (Gotlib
2014).
As with most psychiatric disorders, the aetiology of depression ap-
pears to be multi-factorial, involving both genetic and environ-
mental factors, and current evidence points towards a complex in-
teraction between neurotransmitter availability and receptor reg-
ulation within the brain (Palazidou 2012).
A major depressive disorder (MDD) can be diagnosed on the basis
of one of two widely used classification systems: the World Health
Organization’s International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revi-
sion (ICD-10) (WHO 1992), and the American Psychiatric As-
sociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
5th edition (DSM-5) (APA 2013). In both systems, diagnosis re-
quires the presence of at least one core symptom for most of the
day, almost every day for at least two weeks. Severity of depression
- mild, moderate, or severe - is determined by the number and
severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment.
Depressive disorders are comorbid with a vast array of other psy-
chiatric disorders, health problems, and diseases, and with many
types of severely dysfunctional relationships (Richards 2014).
Depressive symptoms can become chronic and recurrent and can
lead to substantial impairment in an individual’s ability to function
in everyday life (WHO 2012). It is important to recognise that
individualsexperiencingpersistentdepressive symptomsbelow the
thresholdforadiagnosisof MDD, previouslycategorisedas having
a ‘minor depressive disorder’, may find their symptoms equally as
distressing and disabling (Fils 2010).
Description of the intervention
Music therapy can be defined as “the professional use of music
and its elements as an intervention in medical, educational, and
everyday environment with individuals, groups, families, or com-
munities, who seek to optimise their quality of life and improve
their physical, social, communicative, emotional, intellectual and
spiritual health and well-being. Research, practice, education, and
clinical training in music therapy are based on professional stan-
dards according to cultural, social, and political contexts (WFMT
2011)“.
Music therapy is delivered in a variety of contexts (e.g. mental
health, medical, community, developmental, and educational con-
texts) (Edwards 2016). Music therapy can be delivered to groups
or individually, and participants may drop into an open group
(e.g. in a psychiatric ward setting) or may be referred and assessed
by the music therapist before placement in individual treatment
or closed group therapy.
Music therapy approaches across the world have emerged from di-
verse traditions such as behavioural, psychoanalytical, educational,
or humanistic models of therapy. Music therapy methods can be
active and/or receptive and include verbal processing of feelings
and experiences. In active methods (improvisational, re-creative,
compositional), participants are ‘making music’, and in receptive
music therapy, participants are ‘receiving’ (e.g. listening to) music
(Bruscia 2014; Wheeler 2015). Improvisation might be the ac-
tive method most commonly used in adult mental health (Gold
2009). Often, different methods and techniques are combined in
the same therapy. In recent years, specialisations have evolved (e.g.
neurologic music therapy (NMT)), to improve cognitive, sensory,
and motor functioning (Thaut 1999; Thaut 2014).
The aim of music therapy is to improve health via therapeutic
change agents such as music, relationships, and reflections. In both
active and receptive methods, the music therapist and participants
are actively involved and musical interaction takes place between
therapist and patient, or between therapist and group. Sessions are
carried out within a structured therapeutic framework that serves
as the basis for the music therapy intervention. Music therapy
training is delivered at the Master’s level, at the Bachelor’s level, or
at completion of extended undergraduate degree programmes.
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is receiving increased attention
in music therapy (Edwards 2016; Silverman 2015; Wigram
2014). This work involves integration of the best available re-
search evidence, the therapist’s clinical expertise, and the patient’s
unique values and circumstances (Hoffmann 2013; Straus 2011).
Cochrane reviews are an important source of information on EBP
of music therapy and have been conducted to provide a guide for
music therapy treatment, music therapy education, and develop-
ment of meaningful guidelines (Edwards 2016).
How the intervention might work
Music is a powerful stimulus that evokes and modulates moods
and emotions (Baumgartner 2006; Baumgartner 2006a; Koelsch
2015); music is often used intentionally to regulate moods and
emotions in daily life (Juslin 2010). Juslin reports that music may
influence motivation, self-image, and coping mechanisms around
difficultfeelingstates; insome formsof musictherapy, the therapist
explicitly helps individuals process feelings that have been aroused
by music (Juslin 2010). Other possible mechanisms of action have
6

Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 been described by Maratos and colleagues (Maratos 2011), who
suggest that high levels of engagement are seen in music therapy
trials because music-making is largely a social, pleasurable, and
meaningful activity, and that therapists use these affordances in a
variety of ways to help people.
In active music therapy, the music therapist uses improvisational,
re-creative, or compositional methods. Improvisational methods
in music therapy include any experience by which the patient
actively participates in spontaneous music-making with the mu-
sic therapist or with other individuals while playing instruments,
vocalising, or sounding their bodies or other objects. Re-creative
methods involve reproduction of pre-composed musical material
vocally or instrumentally. With compositional methods, the pro-
cess of composition helps patients generate and refine personal
opinions, ideas, and fantasies, and puts them into a workable mu-
sical structure (Bruscia 2014).
The putative mechanism of action in active music therapy for de-
pression is that the co-created musical relationship between the
therapist and the patient or the patient group enables the patient
to experience and to gain insight into relational and emotional
problems by talking about the musical dialogue (Nordoff 1977;
Odell-Miller 1995); to organise, problem-solve, take responsi-
bility, communicate, improve attention, and experience feelings
of self-worth and achievement (Bruscia 2014); to meet a vari-
ety of emotional states and physical needs (Wheeler 2015a); and
to express emotions by creating musical sounds and structures
(Punkanen 2011). Synchronisation and attuned musical expres-
sion can modulate levels of stress and anxiety. Intersubjective mo-
ments form the basis for development of subjectivity, together-
ness, creation of meaning, and possibilities of actions and language
(Trondalen 2016).
Active music therapy is likely to be influenced by psychodynamic,
cognitive-behavioural, or humanistic traditions, and sometimes is
combined with other forms of art, such as writing, drawing, and
movement.
In receptive music therapy, the music therapist uses methods and
techniques by which the patient is a recipient of the music expe-
rience (Grocke 2007). The music in music therapy may consist
of live or recorded improvisations, performances, or compositions
presented in various styles, such as classical, rock, jazz, and coun-
try. The patient is encouraged to listen to music and to respond
silently, verbally, or in another modality. Methods include music
relaxation, song discussion, listening to the patient’s preferred mu-
sic, and imaginal listening, for which Guided Imagery and Music
(GIM) is an internationally well-known method (Bruscia 2014).
The putative mechanism of action in receptive music therapy for
depression is that different types of musical stimuli directly in-
duce shifts in consciousness, stimulate imaging and senses, induce
moods and evoke feelings, influence the body, stimulate or sedate
physical or mental energy, motivate or discourage physical activ-
ity, motivate interaction, and evoke introspection, reflection, and
insight (Bruscia 2015). It has been suggested that receptive music
therapy can help reduce stress, soothe pain, and energise the body
(Bruscia 1991; Standley 1991). Intentional listening via images
enables the patient to focus, relax, experience, and share experi-
ences, and leads to reduced anxiety (Grocke 2007; Grocke 2015).
Receptive musictherapyisalsolikelytobe influencedbycognitive-
behavioural, humanistic, or psychodynamic traditions and may
involve an adjunctive activity performed whilst listening, such as
relaxation, meditation, movement, drawing, or reminiscence.
Why it is important to do this review
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008
(Maratos 2008). Authors of the original review stated that music
therapy has been offered to people with mental disorders across
the world, yet the evidence base of music therapy for depression
had not been examined. Trials were not reviewed, and randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) included small sample sizes, making out-
comes difficult to gauge accurately. Participant groups were often
heterogeneous, and approaches to and methods of music therapy
varied. Since the first review was published, several larger, more
robust RCTs of music therapy for depression have been reported,
and an update of the 2008 systematic review has become neces-
sary to assess available evidence on music therapy with the goals
of understanding its effectiveness for patients with depression and
comparing effects of different forms of music therapy.
Maratos and colleagues included five studies in the first version of
this review (Chen 1992; Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Radulovic
1996; Zerhusen 1995); review authors concluded at that time that
music therapy was accepted by people with depression and was
associated with improvement in depressive symptoms. Because of
the small number and low methodological quality of identified
studies, review authors could not confidently provide conclusions
about the effectiveness of music therapy. Those review authors
suggested that high-quality trials evaluating effects of music ther-
apy on depression were required (Maratos 2008). Additionally,
Maratos and colleagues did not conduct a meta-analysis owing to
heterogeneity of studies.
To date, several other trials related to music therapy and depres-
sion have been conducted, but they have not yet been systemat-
ically reviewed. Authors of a narrative review on music therapy
and depression concluded that current research regarding music
therapy and depression suggests a significant and persistent reduc-
tion in patients’ symptoms, along with improvements in quality
of life (Assche 2015). However, review authors did not include all
relevant data from the most recent trials and did not conduct a
meta-analysis. Also, the authors of another recent systematic re-
view and meta-analysis concluded that music therapy reduces de-
pressive symptoms, but that review was limited to studies of older
adults (Zhao 2016).
We prepared the current update to provide up-to-date conclusions
on the effectiveness of music therapy for individuals of all age
groupswith adiagnosisof depression,inanysetting. We alsoaimed
7

 to compare different music therapy methods and approaches to
enable better understanding of the relationship between process
and outcomes. Finally, results of this systematic review might lead
to new implications for research, guidelines, clinical practice, pol-
icy, and music therapy education.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled tri-
als (CCTs), published and unpublished, undertaken in any coun-
try, were eligible for inclusion.
Types of participants
Participant characteristics
People of any age, gender, and ethnicity, in any country.
Diagnosis
The primary diagnosis for trial participants was clinical depres-
sion, as classified by the International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (WHO 1992), or the Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition (DSM-III) (APA
1980), DSM, 3rd revised edition (DSM-III-R) (APA 1987), DSM,
4th edition (DSM-IV) (APA 1994), DSM, 4th text revised edition
(DSM-IV-TR) (APA 2000), or DSM, 5th edition (DSM-5) (APA
2013). Review authors identified this diagnosis by (1) performing
a psychological assessment, or making a psychiatric diagnosis; (2)
scoring above a cutoff score on a validated self-rating depression
questionnaire; or (3) scoring above a cutoff score on a validated
clinician-rated instrument.
Comorbidities
Given that depression is often related to other health problems
and may co-occur with other diagnoses, we accepted for inclusion
any kind of comorbidity such as anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse,
personality disorder, dementia, autism, schizophrenia, psychosis,
or somatoform comorbidity.
Setting
We included all settings in this review.
Types of interventions
Music therapy
Any form of music therapy (e.g. improvisational, re-creative, com-
positional, or receptive methods) provided alone or in addition to
any form of treatment as usual (TAU), as defined by trialists.
To be included, music therapy had to be provided by a trained
therapist or health professional. To be classified as well-defined
music therapy, a coherent theoretical framework underpinning the
intervention must have been described. Trials involving trainees
in formal music therapy training programmes were considered,
as were programmes provided by music therapists without formal
training. Some untrained practitioners call their practice music
therapy; owing to the relative newness of music therapy as a reg-
ulated profession, we included these studies in this review as well.
In summary, to be classified as well-defined music therapy, the
intervention had to comprise the following features.
1. Sessions were carried out within a structured therapeutic
framework.
2. Some kind of musical interaction took place between
therapist and participant, or between therapist and members of a
group (e.g. improvisation, other forms of musical expression,
listening to music).
3. The aim of therapy was to improve health.
4. The main therapeutic change agent could be described as
the music; the relationship; or reflections induced by the music.
Comparator interventions
1. TAU (as defined by trialists)
2. Psychological therapies
3. Pharmacological therapies
4. Another form of music therapy
TAU, which can be defined as the combination of different ther-
apies or activities (e.g. psychotherapy, medication, collaborative
care, occupational therapy, re-creative activities), represents stan-
dard treatment for individuals with mental health conditions, such
as depression.

 Main comparisons
1. Music therapy alone versus TAU
2. Music therapy plus TAU versus TAU alone
3. Music therapy alone versus psychological therapies
4. Music therapy alone versus pharmacological therapies
5. One form of music therapy versus another form of music

Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Depressive symptoms: We assessed depressive symptoms
according to continuous validated depression measures. We
analysed clinician-rated scales, such as the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HAM-D; Hamilton 1960), separately
from patient-reported scales, such as the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI; Beck 1961).
2. Adverse effects: We assessed the number of adverse events.
Secondary outcomes
1. Social and occupational functioning, as measured by a
validated tool, such as the Social Functioning Questionnaire
(SFQ; Tyrer 2005)
2. Self-esteem, as measured by a validated tool, such as the
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (RSE; Rosenberg 1979)
3. Quality of life, as assessed on a validated measure scale, such
as EuroQol (Brooks 1995)
4. Costs or cost-effectiveness (or a combination) of treatment,
as assessed by any type of qualitative or quantitative analysis,
such as TiC-P (commonly applied questionnaire on healthcare
utilisation and productivity losses in patients with a psychiatric
disorder) (Bouwmans 2013)
5. Leaving the study early owing to non-acceptability or
tolerability of treatment for any reason, based on any type of
qualitative or quantitative analysis
6. Anxiety, as measured by a validated assessor-rating scale,
such as the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A; Hamilton 1959),
or a self-rating scale, such as the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI;
Beck 1988)
7. Satisfaction with treatment, as measured by validated tools,
such as the howRwe questionnaire (Benson 2014)
Timing of outcome assessment
We included in the review any duration of treatment period and
all time frames of outcome assessment. We grouped time points
of outcome assessments and classified them into short-term (up
to three months from randomisation), medium-term (up to six
months), and long-term (longer than six months) outcomes. We
decided that short-term outcomes were most important to include
in the ’Summary of findings’ tables. If a study reported more than
one time point within the considered time frame, we chose the
latest time point for analyses.
Hierarchy of outcome measures
If a study used multiple measures per outcome, we planned to give
preference to measures of validated instruments, such as the Mont-
gomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery
1979), the HAM-D (Hamilton 1960), the Beck Depression In-
ventory(BDI; Beck 1961; Beck1988), the Inventoryof Depressive
Symptomatology (IDS; Rush 1986), and the Symptom Check-
list-90-Revision (SCL-90-R; Derogatis 1977). If several measures
assessed the same outcomes in one particular study, we prioritised
the measures with highest validity and reliability. Rating scales
were completed by participants, their significant others, an inde-
pendent observer who may or may not have been masked, or mu-
sic therapists conducting the music therapy. We decided to report
both clinician-rated and patient-reported outcomes in the ’Sum-
mary of findings’, when available.
Search methods for identification of studies
Specialised Register of the Cochrane Common
Mental Disorders Group (CCMD-CTR)
The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group maintains a
specialised register of RCTs - the CCMD-CTR. This register con-
tains over 40,000 reference records (reports of RCTs) for anxi-
ety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, self-
harm, and other mental disorders within the scope of this Group.
The CCMD-CTR is a partially studies-based register with more
than 50% of reference records tagged to 12,500 individually
PICO-coded study records. We collated reports of trials for in-
clusion in the register from (weekly) generic searches of MED-
LINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-); through
quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL); and by review-specific searches of additional
databases. We also sourced reports of trials from international
trial registries and drug companies, and handsearched key jour-
nals, conference proceedings, and other (non-Cochrane) system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses. Details of CCMD’s core search
strategies (used to identify RCTs) can be found on the Group’s
website; an example of the core MEDLINE search is displayed in
Appendix 1.

a further search in August 2017 (Appendix 3). We have added
those results to ’Studies awaiting classification’ and will incorpo-
rate them into this systematic review at the next update.
Searching other resources
Reference lists
We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant
systematic reviews to identify additional studies missing from the
original electronic searches (e.g. unpublished or in-press citations).
Personal communication
We contacted trialists and subject experts for information on un-
published or ongoing studies, or to request additional trial data.
Other resources
We planned to search the International Music Therapy Research
Register, which is specialised in music therapy studies, but this
register was no longer available. We did not handsearch specialist
journalsinmusictherapyforthisreviewupdate because all journals
are now available online, and articles could be obtained in the
databases mentioned above.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We consideredstudiesforinclusioniftheyhadanRCTorCCTde-
sign. We downloaded all search results into EndNote and Review
Manager (RevMan 2014). One review author (SA) removed exact
duplicates. Two review authors (SA, RF) independently screened
remaining titles and abstracts for inclusion to select all potentially
relevant studies. To prevent bias in assessment, the first review
author was knowledgeable about music therapy, and the second
review author was knowledgeable about mental health care. We
identified multiple reports related to the same study to determine
which studies were eligible for inclusion. If uncertainties about
duplication remained, review authors contacted authors of study
reports. We coded all articles as potentially eligible or not eligible.
After reading full-text articles, the same review authors indepen-
dently decided whether studies met the inclusion criteria. We re-
solved disagreements through discussion or by consultation with
a third review author (AV). We have shown the selection process
in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). We listed included studies
under Characteristics of included studies; we identified potentially
relevant studies that we ultimately excluded under Characteristics
of excluded studies, and provided the primary reason for exclu-
sion.

 Data extraction and management
Two review authors (SA, RF) independently extracted study char-
acteristics and outcome data from included studies, using a stan-
dardised data extraction form in Word, which was piloted at seven
studies before use, and double-entered the data into Review Man-
ager (RevMan 2014) software. In cases of disagreement between
review authors, we sought clarification from trial investigators. We
obtained missing information from investigators when possible
(SA). We resolved disagreements by discussion or through con-
sultation with a third review author (AV). If outcome data were
not reported in a usable way, we mentioned this in the notes in
the Characteristics of included studies table. SA transferred data
into the Review Manager file (RevMan 2014). SA and RF double-
checked whether data were correctly entered. Other review au-
thors (LF, CG) checked study characteristics for accuracy against
the trial report and extracted the following study characteristics.
1. Source: study ID, report ID, review author ID, date of
study, citation and contact details.
2. Methods: study design, power calculation, date of study,
duration of study, sequence generation, allocation sequence
concealment, blinding, other concerns of bias, ethics.
3. Participants: total number, setting, diagnostic criteria,
severity of depression, number of prior depressive episodes, age,
sex, country, comorbidity, sociodemographics, ethnicity.
4. Intervention: total number of groups, music therapy
method, intensity of sessions, duration of session, duration of
treatment, individual or group, therapist’s training, therapist’s
post-qualifying experience, monitoring of adherence to music
therapy paradigm/protocol, comparison, concomitant treatment,
medication, excluded interventions, integrity of interventions.
5. Outcomes: primary outcomes, secondary outcomes,
collected and reported (for scales) upper and lower limits and
whether high or low score is good, time points reported.
6. Results: number of participants allocated to each
intervention group, total sample size, summary data for each
intervention group (2 × 2 table for dichotomous data; means and
standard deviations (SDs) for continuous data).
7. Miscellaneous: funding for trial, notable conflicts of interest
of trial authors, other and key conclusions (Higgins 2015).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias according to the new Cochrane method
(Higgins 2015). Two review authors (SA, RF) independently as-
sessed risk of bias for each included study using the criteria out-
lined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions, to prevent overestimation or underestimation of the true in-
tervention effect (Higgins 2015). We assessed risk of bias accord-
ing to the following domains.
1. Random sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Blinding of participants.
4. Blinding of personnel.
5. Outcome assessment.
6. Incomplete outcome data.
7. Selective outcome reporting.
8. Other potential threats to validity.
We judged each potential source of bias as having high, low, or
unclear risk. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consen-
sus or, in cases of no consensus, by involving a third review author
(AV). We provided a supporting quotation from the study report,
together with a justification for judgements, in the Risk of bias
in included studies table. We summarised risk of bias judgements
across different studies for each of the domains listed. In the case
that information on risk of bias was related to unpublished data or
to correspondence with a trialist, we planned to quote this in the
‘Risk of bias’ table. When considering conclusions on treatment
effects, we took into account risk of bias of trials that contributed
to that outcome (Higgins 2015).
For cluster-randomised trials, we considered particular biases (e.g.
recruitment bias), along with baseline imbalance, loss of clus-
ters, incorrect analysis, and comparability with individually ran-
domised trials. To assess risk of bias in cross-over trials, we took the
following topics into account: whether the cross-over design was
suitable, whether a carry-over effect was evident, whether only first
period data were available, whether findings on analysis were in-
correct, and whether results were comparable with those reported
by parallel-group trials (Higgins 2015).
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
We analysed dichotomous outcome data using odds ratios (ORs)
and calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each effect esti-
mate.
Continuous data
We planned to analyse continuous outcomes as mean differences
(MDs) if outcomes were measured on the same scale, and as stan-
dardised mean differences (SMDs) if outcomes were measured on
differentscales.We hadtocombine differentscalesforall outcomes
and therefore used only SMDs. We calculated 95% confidence
intervals for each effect estimate. Because baseline group means
varied across studies, we examined change scores (differences be-
tween baseline and treatment end or follow-up). We decided that

 treatment, participants, and the underlying clinical question were
sufficiently similar for pooling, and therefore undertook meta-
analysis. In case multiple trial arms were reported in a single trial,
we included only relevant arms (Higgins 2015).
We planned to narratively describe skewed data reported as medi-
ans and interquartile ranges.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
To incorporate cluster-randomised trials, we intended to reduce
the size of each trial to its ‘effective sample size’. If intracluster cor-
relation coefficients were not reported, we planned to find external
estimates from similar studies.
Cross-over trials
To avoid carry-over effects, we planned to include data from only
the first period of cross-over studies. We detected no cross-over
trials.
Studies with multiple treatment groups
We treated with care included studies that compared more than
two intervention groups. To overcome a unit of analysis error,
we combined all relevant experimental intervention groups into
a single group, and all relevant control intervention groups into
a single control group, to create a single pair-wise comparison
(Higgins 2015).
Dealing with missing data
We contacted trial authors to verify key study characteristics and
to obtain missing numerical outcome data when possible (e.g.
when a study was identified as abstract only, when a study was
identified as full text and data regarding an outcome of interest
were not reported). We assumed that dropouts from treatment
were treatment failures unless trialists expressly stated otherwise.
We used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis when data were missing
for participants who dropped out of trials before completion. We
documented all correspondence with trialists (Higgins 2015).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity by examin-
ing the characteristics of studies. We reported similarities between
interventions, participants, design, and outcomes in the Included
studies subsection. We visually inspected forest plots to investigate
the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. To assess whether ob-
served differences in results were compatible with chance alone, we
applied the Cochrane Chi². We regarded a P value less than 0.10
as statistically significant, which means that evidence suggested
heterogeneity of intervention effects. We took care in interpreting
the Chi² test because it has low power in cases of a small sample
size. As heterogeneity will always exist, we decided to quantify in-
consistency by applying the I² statistic to estimate the observed
degree of heterogeneity (Higgins 2015).
Assessment of reporting biases
To avoid publication bias, we obtained and included data from
unpublished trials and took into account that unpublished studies
could introduce new bias through, for example, poor methodolog-
ical quality or missing data. If we had identified more than ten
studies, we planned to create a funnel plot to detect possible pub-
lication bias (in the absence of bias, the plot should approximately
resemble a symmetrical funnel). If we thought that asymmetry of
the funnel (bias) was explained by other reasons, such as lack of
unpublished smaller studies (Higgins 2015), selection bias, poor
methodological quality, or chance (Egger 1997; Sterne 2000), we
planned to report this information in the Discussion section.
Data synthesis
We analysed data using Review Manager software and pooled data
for meta-analysis when studies assessed similar treatments and
had similar outcomes (RevMan 2014). We conducted a meta-
analysis using available or calculated standardised mean differ-
ences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs)
for dichotomous outcomes. We chose SMD because we expected
many different scales to be used across studies, and because exist-
ing guidelines facilitate clinical interpretation, particularly when
lesser- known scales are used (Cohen 1988). We expected that true
effects for all included studies would not be the same; therefore,
we planned to analyse data by applying a random-effects model to
combine results and produce a summary of findings of all included
studies. We included in the results measures of uncertainty, such
as 95% confidence intervals and estimates of T² and I². When
suitable numerical data were not available for meta-analysis, or
when meta-analyses were considered inappropriate to yield clin-
ically meaningful results, we planned to produce only narrative
summaries of all included studies to provide a systematic assess-
ment of available evidence. We produced a descriptive paragraph
for each study, presenting all studies consistently (e.g. using the
same elements of information for each study and in the same or-
der) (Higgins 2015).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
When we identified heterogeneity, we planned to present the re-
sults of subgroups separately. We planned to examine clinical het-
erogeneity according to the following.
1. Participant characteristics - age, length of depression
history, comorbidity.
13

 2. Duration of treatment - 20 sessions versus more than 20
sessions.
3. Modality of treatment - individual versus group therapy.
4. Type of music therapy.
Sensitivity analysis
When applicable, we planned to conduct the following sensitivity
analyses for primary outcomes to examine the robustness of ob-
served findings.
1. Excluding studies with high risk of bias. We defined a study
as having an overall ”high risk of bias“ if we judged that it had
high risk of bias in at least one domain.
’Summary of findings’ tables
We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE ap-
proach for our main comparisons and outcomes (as listed in Types
of outcome measures). We plannedtocreate ‘Summaryof findings’
tables to provide key information regarding the quality of evidence
and the magnitude of effect of interventions examined, and to
summarise available data on all outcomes for a given comparison.
To ensure consistency of use across reviews, we prepared standard
Cochrane ’Summary of findings’ tables by using GRADEproGDT
2015 and including the following elements: comparison, popula-
tion, setting, intervention, comparator intervention, primary and
secondary outcomes, burden of outcomes (illustrative risk, or il-
lustrative mean, on control intervention; source of any external
information used in this column), absolute and relative magnitude
of effect, numbers of participants and studies, rating of evidence
quality, and space for comments. For every comparison, we pro-
duced another table.
We decided that music therapy versus treatment as usual was our
main comparison. In the ’Summary of findings’ table, we reported
the seven main outcomes. Primary outcomes were short-term clin-
ician-rated and patient-reported depression and adverse events.
Secondary outcomes included functioning, quality of life, leaving
the study early, and anxiety. We created our ’Summary of findings’
tables before writing the abstract, discussion, and conclusions to
consider how risk of bias in studies contributing to each outcome
affected mean treatment effects and our confidence in mean treat-
ment effects (Higgins 2015).

Description of studies
Results of the search
In total, we identified 2867 records. Of these, we retrieved 2784
records through database searching. We found 83 additional refer-
ences by searching the World Health Organization International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (n = 4), Clinical
Trials.gov (n = 25), the National Guideline Clearing House (n =
11), OpenGrey (n = 11), the Digital Access to Research Theses
(DART)-Europe E-theses Portal (n = 16), the ProQuest Disser-
tations and Theses database (n = 1), personal communications
(n = 5), and published systematic reviews on music therapy for
depression (n = 10). We found no additional references in the
Electronic Theses Online Service (EthOS), the British Libraries
e-thesis online service, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, or
the reference lists of included studies.
After removing 1165 duplicates, we screened 1702 titles and ab-
stracts and excluded 1661 irrelevant records. We retrieved full-
text reports for the remaining 41 studies. After reading the full
texts, we excluded 30 studies, as they did not meet review eli-
gibility criteria. We have provided primary reasons for exclusion
in the Characteristics of excluded studies table and in Figure 1.
Two studies are awaiting assessment owing to insufficient informa-
tion on design, intervention, and analysis (see Characteristics of
studies awaiting classification). We added to the Studies awaiting
classification section three study reports obtained from an updated
search conducted in August 2017 (Ahessy 2016; Jasemi 2016; Kim
2014). In preparing this review, we identified no records of ongo-
ing studies. Finally, we included nine trials in both qualitative and
quantitative syntheses.
Included studies
We included in the present review a total of nine studies with
421 participants (of whom we included 411 in the meta-analy-
ses) (see Characteristics of included studies). Of these, we had in-
cluded five studies in the first version of this review (Chen 1992;
Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen 1995)
(Maratos 2008); we added the other four studies to the current up-
date (Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat 2016; Erkkilä2011; Hendricks
2001).
Design
Eight of the included studies were randomised trials (Albornoz
2011; Atiwannapat 2016; Chen1992; Erkkilä2011; Hanser1994;
Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Zerhusen 1995), and one was
a controlled clinical trial (Radulovic 1996). All were single-centre
trials.
Participants
Participants across all studies had received a diagnosis of a de-
pressive disorder. Methods of diagnosing depression varied across
studies. Three studies performed diagnosis according to ICD-
10 criteria (Atiwannapat 2016; Erkkilä 2011; Radulovic 1996);
14

 one study performed diagnosis according to DSM-III-R criteria
(Chen 1992). Atiwannapat 2016 also required a score of 7 or
above on the MADRS. Other studies confirmed the presence of
a depressive disorder exclusively by using a validated scale, such
as the BDI (Albornoz 2011; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001;
Zerhusen 1995), or the Schedule of Affective Disorders (SADS;
Hanser 1994). Chen 1992 reported that some participants had a
history of bipolar disorder.
In Albornoz 2011, depression was not the primary diagnosis but
was diagnosed in comorbidity with a substance disorder. Another
psychiatric comorbidity across included studies was represented
by anxiety (Erkkilä 2011). In Chen 1992 and Radulovic 1996,
anxiety was an outcome, but whether it was diagnosed was not
reported.
Information regarding the history of depression was available only
for Atiwannapat 2016, with a mean clinical history of 9.07 years.
Ages of participants were heterogeneous among the included stud-
ies. In particular, two studies recruited only adolescents aged 14
to 18 years (Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001). Three studies ex-
clusively included adults aged 18 to 65 years (Atiwannapat 2016;
Erkkilä 2011; Radulovic 1996). Three studies focused on a geri-
atric population of participants aged 60 to 86 years (Chen 1992;
Hanser 1994; Zerhusen 1995). Finally, Albornoz 2011 investi-
gated depression in both adolescents and adults, with an age range
of 16 to 60 years.
In seven studies, samples included participants of both sexes;
prevalence of males ranged from 10.53% in Hendricks 1999 to
49.21% in Hendricks 2001. Albornoz 2011 recruited only male
participants. Zerhusen 1995 did not provide information regard-
ing the sex of participants.
Sample size
The total number of participants enrolled in the nine studies was
421; however, one study randomised 10 participants to an arm
that was outside the scope of this review (Hanser 1994). Study
sizes varied from 14 participants in Atiwannapat 2016 to 79 par-
ticipants in Erkkil 2011.
Setting
Five of the includedtrialsrecruitedparticipantsfrommental health
services(Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat 2016; Erkkilä2011; Hanser
1994; Radulovic 1996). Zerhusen 1995 enrolled participants who
were hospitalised in a nursing home, and participants in Chen
1992 resided in a geriatric facility. Two studies recruited partici-
pants from high schools (Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001).
Four studies took place in North America, more precisely, in the
United States (Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Hanser 1994;
Zerhusen 1995). Two trials took place in Asia: Chen 1992 was
conducted in China, and Atiwannapat 2016 in Thailand. Two
studies were realised in European countries: Erkkilä 2011 was
conducted in Finland, and Radulovic 1996 took place in Serbia.
Finally, one study was conducted in South-America - Venezuela
(Albornoz 2011).
Interventions
We included studies for the following comparisons: music therapy
plus TAU versus TAU alone, music therapy alone versus psycho-
logical therapies, and one form of music therapy versus another
form of music therapy. We found no studies comparing music
therapy alone versus TAU or pharmacological therapies.
Music therapy
Music therapy methods were heterogeneous across the included
studies. In three studies, researchers adopted an active music ther-
apy method (Albornoz 2011; Chen 1992, Erkkilä 2011). Two
studies took into consideration a combination of active and re-
ceptive music therapy (Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999). Of note,
Albornoz 2011 provided a specific music therapy intervention by
combining music, movement, poetry, psychodrama, and public
performance (Artistic Music Therapy; MAR). The intervention
wasmore thoroughlydescribedinaseparate publication(Albornoz
2016). Hendricks 2001, Radulovic 1996, andZerhusen1995 eval-
uated receptive music therapy. In Atiwannapat 2016, two of the
three arms of treatment involved music therapy: one arm, active
music therapy, and the other arm, receptive music therapy.
In seven studies, music therapy sessions were conducted in a
group setting (Albornoz 2011, Atiwannapat 2016, Chen 1992,
Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen
1995). Two studies provided individual sessions (Erkkilä 2011;
Hanser 1994).
In four studies, trained music therapists provided music ther-
apy (Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat 2016; Hanser 1994; Erkkilä
2011). In the remaining studies it was not clear whether a trained
music therapist provided therapy, although trained therapists,
counsellors, or other healthcare professionals were mentioned
(Chen 1992; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic 1996;
Zerhusen 1995).
Lengths of intervention varied from six weeks in Radulovic 1996
to 12 weeks in Atiwannapat 2016 and Hendricks 2001, with the
total number of sessions ranging from eight in Hanser 1994 to
48 in Chen 1992. The duration of each session varied from 20
minutes in Radulovic 1996 to 120 minutes in Albornoz 2011.
Comparator interventions
Six studies had one comparator (Albornoz 2011; Chen 1992;
Erkkilä2011; Hendricks1999; Hendricks2001; Radulovic 1996).
Three studies each included three treatment arms (Atiwannapat
2016; Hanser 1994; Zerhusen 1995).
Five studies compared music therapy versus treatment as usual
(Albornoz 2011; Chen 1992; Erkkilä 2011; Radulovic 1996;
15

 Zerhusen 1995). Extent of treatment as usual varied both between
and within studies, but treatment commonly included antide-
pressant medication and group or individual psychotherapy. Four
studies mentioned antidepressant medication (Albornoz 2011;
Chen 1992; Erkkilä 2011; Radulovic 1996). Two studies men-
tionedgrouporindividual psychotherapy(Albornoz 2011; Erkkilä
2011). Two studies mentioned rehabilitation services and related
activities (Albornoz 2011; Zerhusen 1995). Hanser 1994 men-
tioned no specific therapy as researchers used a waiting list, but
all participants were patients from a family research and resource
centre.
Four studies used active comparators, which included cogni-
tive-behavioural therapy in Hendricks 1999, Hendricks 2001,
and Zerhusen 1995, and counselling in Atiwannapat 2016.
Atiwannapat 2016 compared two types of music therapy (active
and receptive) versus each other. We excluded self-directed music
listening from Hanser 1994 as a comparator because this was out-
side the scope of the review.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
Depression symptoms
All studies assessed depression symptoms using different scales.
Two studies used only a clinician-rated depression scale (Chen
1992; Erkkilä 2011); four used only a self-reported depression
scale (Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Zerhusen
1995); and three used both types (Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat
2016; Radulovic 1996).
Researchers used two clinician-rated depression scales.
1. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (various
abbreviations are encountered: HRSD, HDRS, HAM-D; in this
review, abbreviated as HAM-D) is a measure of depressive
symptoms in adults with a diagnosis of depressive disorder. The
original version (Hamilton 1960) contained 17 items, but four
questions were added to later revisions (Hamilton 1966;
Hamilton 1967; Hamilton 1969; Hamilton 1980). Each item
on the questionnaire is scored on a 3- or 5-point scale. Total
score can range from 0 to 54 points, with scores from 7 to 17
indicating mild depression, from 18 to 24 indicating moderate
depression, and above 24 indicating severe depression. Three
studies used the HAM-D. Albornoz 2011 used the original 17-
item version, and Chen 1992 and Radulovic 1996 did not
specify which version investigators used. Although this is one of
the most widely used scales, information on its typical standard
deviation (SD) in people with depression is not available from
the original validation studies. The included studies for which
SDs could be derived showed SDs around 10 (Albornoz 2011;
Chen 1992), and we imputed this value when the SD was
missing (see notes in Characteristics of included studies).
2. The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) is a ten-item questionnaire used to measure the
severity of depressive episodes in people with mood disorders.
Each item yields a score of 0 to 6, and the overall score can range
from 0 to 60 (Davidson 1986). Two studies used MADRS
(Atiwannapat 2016; Erkkilä 2011). Its typical SD in people with
depression is around 7 (Davidson 1986; Erkkilä 2011), so we
imputed this value when it was missing.
Investigators used three self-rated depression scales.
1. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-report measure
of the severity of depression, composed of 21 multiple choice
questions related to depression symptoms. The overall score has a
possible range from 0 to 63. Five studies used the BDI (
Albornoz 2011; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic
1997; Zerhusen 1995). Two of these failed to report SDs (
Radulovic 1997; Zerhusen 1995), so we had to impute a typical
SD derived from other studies. In particular, as the original
report describing the BDI presented SD 10 based on a sample of
409 participants (Beck 1961), we used this value as the best
available estimate when the SD was missing (see notes in
Characteristics of included studies section).
2. Thai Depression Inventory (TDI) is a self-rating instrument
composed of 20 items and used to evaluate the severity of
depression (Lotrakul 1999). The score for each item in the TDI
ranges from 0 to 3. The overall score has a possible range from 0
to 60. One study used the TDI (Atiwannapat 2016).
3. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a self-report assessment
specifically designed to identify depression in older adults. This
scale is composed of 30 items with yes/no answers. A score of 11
or above is usually considered as indicative of depression
(Yesavage 1983). One study used the GDS (Hanser 1994).
For all depression scales, higher scores represent greater severity of
depression symptoms.
Adverse events
Adverse events reported in these studies included worsening of
depression and lower back pain (Erkkilä 2011). None of the other
studies reported whether any adverse events occurred.
Secondary outcomes
Functioning
Only one study assessed functioning using the Global Assessment
of Functioning scale (GAF; APA 2000) (Erkkilä 2011). The GAF
is a clinician-reported scale that is used to rate the social, occupa-
tional, and psychological functioning of an individual. Values can
16

 range from a minimum score of 0 (severely impaired functioning)
to a maximum score of 100 (extremely high functioning).
Quality of life
Two studies measured quality of life. Specifically, Atiwannapat
2016 used the Thai version of the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-
36; Ware 1992), and Erkkilä 2011 used the Finnish translation
of the health-related quality of life survey distributed by RAND
(RAND-36; Hays 1993). SF-36 and RAND-36 are closely related
patient-reported measures that are based on the same set of 36
items but with slightly different scoring (Hays 1993). Lower scores
indicate increased disability.
Leaving the study early
Data on leaving the study early were available for all nine studies,
although events occurred in only four trials (Atiwannapat 2016;
Erkkilä 2011; Hanser 1994; Zerhusen 1995). Of the remaining
five studies, four reported no dropouts (Albornoz 2011; Chen
1992; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic 1996), and one did not report
to which arm dropouts belonged (Hendricks 1999), thus con-
tributing no usable data for this outcome.
Anxiety
Three studies assessed anxiety (Chen 1992; Erkkilä 2011;
Radulovic 1996). Two studies used the clinician-rated Hamilton
Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) as described in Maier 1988 (Chen 1992;
Radulovic 1996), and one study used the clinician-rated Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A), as described
in Zigmond 1983 (Erkkilä 2011).
The HAM-A is a clinician-rated scale that intends to provide an
analysis of the severity of anxiety in adults, adolescents, and chil-
dren. It is composed of 14 items. Each item can receive a score
between 0 and 4, and the composite score can range from 0 to
56. Its validity and reliability in people with depression are well
established (Maier 1988), with a typical SD of around 7 (Maier
1988 reported standard error (SE) = 0.8 with n = 73, leading to
SD 7).
The HADS is a clinician-rated scale that comprises 14 items (
Zigmond 1983), seven of which are related to anxiety (HADS-A);
the other seven are related to depression (HADS-D). Erkkilä 2011
used the HADS-A. Each item on the HADS-A is scored from 0
to 3, yielding a total score between 0 and 21.
Self-esteem
One study assessed self-esteem (Hanser 1994), using the Rosen-
berg Self-esteem Inventory (RSE; Rosenberg 1979). The RSE is
a 10-item scale that evaluates global self-worth. All items are an-
swered via a 4-point Likert scale format ranging from strongly
agree to strongly disagree. Total score ranges from 0 to 30. Scores
below 15 suggest low self-esteem.
Costs and cost-effectiveness
No studies addressed costs or cost-effectiveness.
Satisfaction
No studies addressed satisfaction.
Excluded studies
We excluded 30 studies. Two studies were not RCTs or CCTs
(Carolan 2016; No author 2008). Nineteen studies included an
ineligible population (Ashida 2000; Bae 2011; Bittman 2001;
Boothby 2011; Broersen 2013; Carr 2012; Cassileth 2003; Chen
2016; Choi 2008; Chu 2014; Clark 2006; Cross 2012; Iliya
2015; Lu 2013; Mohammadi 2011; Raglio 2015; Romito 2013;
Schwantes 2014; Werner 2015). In four studies. the intervention
was not music therapy (Brandes 2010; Castillo-Pérez 2010; Lu
2012; Huang 2010), and two studies did not include a relevant
comparator intervention (Chen 2015; Wu 2002). Full-text reports
were not available for three studies (Bradford 1991; Li 2002; Liu
2014). See also Characteristics of excluded studies.
Ongoing studies
We identified no ongoing studies.
Studies awaiting classification
Two studies are awaiting classification (Kumar 2013; Tang 2011).
Kumar 2013 provided insufficient information about study de-
sign, and Tang 2011 provided insufficient details related to the
music therapy intervention and statistical results. We were un-
able to obtain more information. See also Characteristics of
studies awaiting classification. We added to the Studies awaiting
classification section three study reports obtained from an updated
search conducted in August 2017 (Ahessy 2016; Jasemi 2016; Kim
2014).

 New studies found at this update
We added four new studies to the current update of the review
(Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat 2016; Erkkilä 2011; Hendricks
2001). Of note, Albornoz 2011 evaluated the effect of improvi-
sational music therapy on depressed individuals with substance
abuse. We did not include this particular population in the previ-
ous version of the review. Atiwannapat 2016 compared active and
receptive music therapy for adult outpatients with major depres-
sion. Hendricks 2001 was a replication of a study that was included
in the previous version of this review (Hendricks 1999). Investi-
gators evaluated the effects of school-based music therapy among
adolescentswith depressive symptoms.Finally, Erkkilä 2011 inves-
tigated individual music therapy provided to a working-age group
of depressed individuals.

 Allocation
Random sequence generation
Two studies specified that researchers used spreadsheet software to
generate random number lists in blocks (Albornoz 2011, Erkkilä
2011); Atiwannapat 2016 reported drawing lots in a 1:1:1 ratio.
We judged these studies to be at low risk of bias. Most studies
were at unclear risk of bias because study authors stated only that
participants were randomised, but did not describe how (Chen
1992; Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Zerhusen
1995). One studydidnotdescribe howparticipantswere allocated,
and we judged it to be at high risk of bias (Radulovic 1996).
Allocation concealment
In three studies, participants and investigators enrolling partici-
pants could not foresee assignment (Albornoz 2011; Erkkilä 2011;
Hendricks 2001).Albornoz 2011 used sequentially numbered en-
velopes; Erkkilä 2011 used remote email randomisation; and
Hendricks 2001 used coded packets. We judged the remaining
six studies to be at unclear risk (Atiwannapat 2016; Chen 1992;
Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen 1995).
Blinding
We judged one of nine studies to be at low risk of bias (Erkkilä
2011). In this study, investigators did not blind participants,
but one masked clinical expert conducted all psychiatric assess-
ments. Review authors judged that outcomes in this study were
not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. The remaining
eight studies were at unclear risk (Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat
2016; Chen 1992; Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks
2001; Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen 1995). In two of these studies
(Albornoz 2011; Atiwannapat 2016), both important personnel
and clinician-reported outcomes (HRSD; MADRS) were blinded.
However, blinding for participants and for self-reported outcomes
in depression (BDI) was not possible in two studies (Albornoz
2011; Atiwannapat 2016); and blinding for quality of life (SF-
36) was not possible in Atiwannapat 2016. Six studies did not
address blinding of personnel and participants and provided in-
sufficient information to permit a clear judgement (Chen 1992;
Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic 1996;
Zerhusen 1995).
Incomplete outcome data
We judged eight out of nine studies to be at low risk of
bias (Albornoz 2011; Chen 1992; Erkkilä 2011; Hanser 1994;
Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen
1995). For five of these studies, reports indicated no missing out-
come data (Albornoz 2011; Chen 1992; Hanser 1994; Hendricks
2001. Radulovic 1996). In one study, missing outcome data were
balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar rea-
sons noted for missing data across groups (e.g. one resident left
the study early, and corresponding participants in the other two
groups were therefore also discarded from the data analysis, leav-
ing 19 participants in each group available for the purpose of data
analysis) (Zerhusen 1995). One other study imputed data using
appropriate methods (Erkkilä 2011). In another study. it remains
unclear to which group participants leaving the study early were
originally allocated, although study authors stated that partici-
pants dropped out of the music therapy group and the treatment
as usual group (Hendricks 1999). We judged one study to be at
high risk (Atiwannapat 2016). In this study, the proportion of and
reasons for missing data in one of the control arms were sufficient
to have a clinically relevant effect because of the small study group.
Selective reporting
We judged two of nine studies to be at low risk (Albornoz 2011;
Erkkilä 2011). For Albornoz 2011, an earlier published disser-
tation was available, and all outcomes were reported as planned
(Albornoz 2009). For the other study (Erkkilä 2011), a study pro-
tocol was available, and all expected outcomes were identified and
reported as planned (Erkkilä 2008). We judged the remaining
seven studies to be at unclear risk (Atiwannapat 2016; Chen 1992;
Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Radulovic 1996;
Zerhusen 1995). For these studies, a protocol was not available,
and all outcomes were reported as planned in the Methods section.
Therefore, information was insufficient to permit judgement of
low or high risk.
Other potential sources of bias
We judged three of eight studies to be at low risk of bias (Albornoz
2011; Atiwannapat 2016; Erkkilä 2011), as these studies appeared
to be free of other sources of bias. We judged the six remaining
studies to be at unclear risk because risk of bias could be present
(Chen 1992; Hanser 1994; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001;
Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen1995), butinformationwasinsufficient
to show whether an important risk of bias existed.

 findings 3 Active music therapy versus receptive music therapy
for depression
Comparison 1. Music therapy plus treatment as usual
(TAU) versus TAU alone
Primary outcomes
Severity of depression symptoms (clinician-rated)
Four studies addressed clinician-rated severity of depression symp-
toms in the short term (up to three months) (Albornoz 2011;
Chen 1992; Erkkilä 2011; Radulovic 1996). A significant short-
term effect favoured music therapy (standardised mean difference
(SMD) -0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.69 to -0.27, P =
0.007, 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 1 clinical controlled
trial (CCT), n = 219, moderate-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.1).
Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 83%). See Summary of findings for
the main comparison.
Only one study evaluated the medium-term effect (up to six
months) of clinician-rated depressive symptoms and found no sig-
nificant effect (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.12, P = 0.14, 1
RCT, n = 64, moderate-quality evidence) (Erkkilä 2011) (Analysis
1.1).
Severity of depression symptoms (patient-reported)
In total, four studies evaluated patient-reported severity of symp-
toms. Three studies used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
(Albornoz 2011; Radulovic 1996; Zerhusen 1995). Hanser 1994
preferred to use the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). At short
term, a significant effect favoured music therapy in patient-re-
ported severity of symptoms (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.37 to -
0.34, P = 0.001, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142, moderate-quality ev-
idence) (Analysis 1.2). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 49%).
See Summary of findings for the main comparison. Researchers
reported no data at medium term (Analysis 1.2).
Adverse events
One RCT provided data concerning this outcome, revealing no
significant evidence that music therapy was associated with more
or fewer adverse events than treatment as usual in the short term
(odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.02 to 11.46, P = 0.63, n = 79,
low-quality evidence) or in the medium term (OR 0.69, 95% CI
0.06to7.91, P=0.76, n=79, low-qualityevidence)(Erkkilä 2011)
(Analysis 1.3). See Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Secondary outcomes
Functioning
Only one RCT measured level of functioning using the Global
Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) (Erkkilä 2011). A signifi-
cant effect favoured music therapy in the short term (SMD 0.51,
95% CI 0.02 to 1, P = 0.04, n = 67, low-quality evidence). On
the contrary, investigators found no significant differences in the
medium term (SMD 0.38, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.88, P = 0.13, n = 64,
low-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was not applicable (Analysis
1.4). See Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Quality of life
Only one study used the health-related quality of life survey dis-
tributed by RAND (RAND-36) to evaluate quality of life (Erkkilä
2011). Researchers found no significant differences between the
music therapy group and the treatment as usual group, both in the
short term (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67,
low-quality evidence) and in the medium term (SMD 0.26, 95%
CI -0.23 to 0.76, P = 0.30, n = 64, low-quality evidence) (Analysis
1.5). Heterogeneity was not applicable. See Summary of findings
for the main comparison.
Leaving the study early
Included studies reported no significant differences in rates of
leaving the study early between participants who attended music
therapy and those in the treatment as usual group at short term
(OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n
= 293, moderate-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was low (I2 =
0%) (Analysis 1.6). At medium term, only Erkkilä 2011 reported
events of leaving the study early and noted no significant differ-
ences (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.53, P = 0.20, n = 79, moder-
ate-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was not applicable (Analysis
1.6). See Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Anxiety
Three studies evaluated anxiety in the short term (Chen 1992;
Erkkilä 2011; Radulovic 1996). Chen 1992 and Radulovic 1996
used the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) to assess outcome
measures, and Erkkilä 2011 used the Hospital Anxiety and De-
pression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A). Trialists reported a significant
reduction in anxiety favouring music therapy in the short term
(SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.40 to -0.08, P = 0.03, 2 RCTs, 1 CCT,
n = 195, low-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.7). Heterogeneity was
high (I2 = 80%). Similarly, as for the outcome of clinician-rated
depression reported above, Chen 1992 was the study showing the
strongest positive effect, again possibly as a result of the geriatric

quality evidence) (Analysis 1.7). See Summary of findings for the
main comparison.
Self-esteem
One study measured self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Inventory (RSE) (Hanser 1994). Results showed no significant
differences between music therapy and treatment as usual groups
(SMD -0.63, 95% CI -1.53 to 0.27, P = 0.17, n = 20, low-quality
evidence) (Analysis 1.8). Heterogeneity was not applicable. No
data were available at medium term (Analysis 1.8).

We found no eligible studies addressing this outcome.
Satisfaction with treatment
We found no eligible studies addressing this outcome.
Comparison 2. Music therapy versus psychological
therapy
Primary outcomes
Severity of depression symptoms (clinician-rated)
One RCT measured severity of depressive symptoms at both short
term and medium term (Atiwannapat 2016). Upon combining
data regarding active and receptive music therapy approaches, we
found no significant differences in comparison with psychological
therapy (short-term: SMD -0.78, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.81, P = 0.34,
n = 11, very low-quality evidence; medium-term: SMD -1.11,
95% CI -2.74 to 0.53, P = 0.19, n = 11, very low-quality evidence)
(Analysis 2.1). Heterogeneity was not applicable. See Summary of
findings 2.
Severity of depression symptoms (patient-reported)
Investigators found no significant differences in patient-reported
severity of depression symptoms, both at short term and at
mediumterm.Inparticular, fourRCTsevaluatedchangesin symp-
toms at short term (SMD -1.28, 95% CI -3.75 to 1.02, P = 0.28,
n = 131, low-quality evidence) (Atiwannapat 2016; Hendricks
1999; Hendricks 2001; Zerhusen 1995). Heterogeneity was high
(I2 = 96%). Only Atiwannapat 2016 evaluated patient-reported
symptoms at medium term, noting no significant effects (SMD -
0.68, 95% CI -2.26 to 0.89, P = 0.40, n = 11, very low-quality
evidence) (Analysis 2.2). See Summary of findings 2.

Secondary outcomes
Functioning

Quality of life
Only one study evaluated quality of life using the Thai version
of Short Form (SF)-36 (Atiwannapat 2016). In the short term,
researchers found no significant differences between music therapy
groups and psychological therapy groups (SMD 1.31, 95% CI -
0.36 to 2.99, P = 0.12, n = 11, very low-quality evidence) (Analysis
2.3). Heterogeneity was not applicable. Investigators also found
no significant effects in the medium term (SMD 0.93, 95% CI -
0.67 to 2.54, P = 0.25, n = 11, very low-quality evidence) (Analysis
2.3). See Summary of findings 2.
Leaving the study early
Four included studies recruited a total of 137 participants
(Atiwannapat 2016; Hendricks 1999; Hendricks 2001; Zerhusen
1995). At short term, one participant in the music therapy group
and three participants in the psychological therapy group left the
study early (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.49, P = 0.11, n = 137,
moderate-quality evidence). Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%)
(Analysis 2.4). Of note, in Hendricks 1999, two participants who
were initially randomised left the study early. However, the study
reportdoesnotspecifytowhich groupthese participantsbelonged;
we therefore decided to consider this missing information and as-
signed a value of zero. At medium term, data from Atiwannapat
2016 revealed no additional dropouts compared with the number
reported at three-month follow-up, and showed no statistically
significant differences between music therapy and psychological
therapy groups (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.92, P = 0.13, n =
14, very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.4). See Summary of

Comparison 3. Active music therapy versus receptive
music therapy
Primary outcomes
Severity of depression symptoms (clinician-rated)
One RCT evaluated severity of depression symptoms in active
and receptive music therapy (Atiwannapat 2016). An expert clini-
cian administered the MADRS to study participants. Investigators
found no significant differences between the two music therapy
interventions in the short term (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.87 to
0.83, P = 0.45, n = 9, very low-quality evidence) or in the medium
term (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -2.02 to 0.73, P = 0.36, n = 9, very
low-quality evidence) (Analysis 3.1). Heterogeneity was not ap-
plicable. See Summary of findings 3.
Severity of depression symptoms (patient-reported)
Atiwannapat 2016 used the Thai Depression Inventory (TDI)
to evaluate patient-reported depressive symptoms. Trialists found
no statistically significant differences between active and receptive
music therapy groups in the short term (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -
1.33 to 1.30, P = 0.98; n = 9, very low-quality evidence). Quality
of evidence was low in the short term. See Summary of findings 3.
Also in the medium term, analysis showed no differences between
the two groups (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -1.48 to 1.16, P = 0.82,
n = 9, very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 3.2). See Summary of
findings 3.

Secondary outcomes
Functioning

Quality of life
Atiwannapat 2016 evaluated quality of life using the Thai version
of SF-36. Investigators found no significant differences between
active music therapy and receptive music therapy in the short term
(SMD -0.24, 95% CI -1.57 to 1.08, P = 0.72, n = 9, very low-
quality evidence) (Analysis 3.3). They also found no significant
effects in the medium term (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -1.29 to 1.34, P
= 0.97, n = 9, very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 3.3). Hetero-
geneity was not applicable. One study including nine participants
contributed data to this comparison. See Summary of findings 3.
Leaving the study early
According to Atiwannapat 2016, the number of dropouts was
higher in the receptive music therapy group, with one participant
leaving the study in the first three months. On the contrary, no
participants in the active music therapy group left the study early.
However, this difference cannot be considered statistically signifi-
cant (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.46, P = 0.46, n = 10, very low-
quality evidence) (Analysis 3.4). Heterogeneity was not applica-
ble. See Summary of findings 3.

 Sensitivity analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of the
risk of bias of included studies on primary outcomes.
For Comparison 1 (Music therapy plus TAU vs TAU), removing
the study at high risk of bias from the meta-analysis did not change
the significance of effects (Radulovic 1996). The effect estimate
for clinician-rated depression symptoms (Analysis 1.1) became
larger (SMD -1.12, 95% CI -2.10 to -0.14, P = 0.03, n = 159);
and the effect estimate for patient-reported depression symptoms
(Analysis 1.2) remained similar (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.82 to -
0.14, P = 0.02, n = 82), both in favour of music therapy plus TAU.
Heterogeneity remained high for clinician-rated depression (I2 =
86%), and moderate for patient-reported depression symptoms (I
2 = 66%).
For Comparison 2 (Music therapy vs psychological therapy), re-
moving the study at high risk of bias did not change the non-sig-
nificance of effects (Atiwannapat 2016). No studies remained for
clinician-rated depression symptoms nor for patient-reported de-
pression symptoms at medium term. Effects on patient-reported
depression symptoms at short term (Analysis 2.2) remained non-
significant (SMD -1.41, 95% CI -4.26 to 1.44, P = 0.33, n = 120).
Heterogeneity remained high (I2 = 97%).
In summary, sensitivity analyses did not change results.

Summary of main results
Comparison 1. Music therapy plus treatment as usual
(TAU) versus TAU
Review authors found a significant short-term effect of music ther-
apy combined with treatment as usual versus treatment as usual
alone according to both clinician-rated and patient-reported mea-
sures of depressive symptoms. The effect sizes found can be inter-
preted in accordance with common guidelines for interventions
in the behavioural sciences (Cohen 1988), by which effect sizes
of up to 0.2 are considered small, those around 0.5 medium, and
those at 0.8 and above large.
Our results show a large effect size of music therapy for clinician-
rated depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD)
-0.98; moderate-quality evidence). The effect size translates to a
difference of 9.8 points on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depres-
sion (HAM-D), which normally has a standard deviation (SD) of
around 10. This is likely to be a clinically important difference.
We found a large effect size for music therapy (SMD -0.85), with
moderate quality of evidence, when depressive symptoms were
evaluated by means of self-reported instruments. This effect size
can be translated to a change of 8.5 points on the Beck Depres-
sion Inventory (BDI). This difference is also likely to be clinically
relevant. The beneficial effect of music therapy did not seem to be
maintained in the medium term. However, only one study eval-
uated depressive symptoms over a period of six months (Erkkilä
2011), showing a trend towards significance in favour of music
therapy. Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer ad-
verse events than treatment as usual, with low quality of evidence.
In the short term, we found a significant reduction in anxiety
symptoms, with a medium effect size (SMD -0.71; low-quality
evidence). This effect size translates to a change of 5 points on the
Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), which has an SD 7. This is
likely to be a clinically relevant effect. Also the level of functioning
improved in the short term with a medium effect size (SMD 0.51;
low-quality evidence). The effect size translates to a change of
about 5 points on the Global Assessment of Functioning scale
(GAF) (SD 10), which could be clinically relevant. We found
no differences between music therapy added to treatment as usual
versus treatment as usual alone in terms of quality of life/self-
esteem/number of adverse events, with low quality of evidence.
The proportion of participants who left the study early did not
significantly differ between music therapy plus TAU and TAU
alone groups, and the quality of evidence was moderate.
Comparison 2. Music therapy versus psychological
therapy
Review authors noted no significant differences between music
therapy and psychological therapy in severity of depressive symp-
toms, for both clinician-rated (very low-quality evidence) and pa-
tient-reported outcomes (low-quality evidence). Also, we found
no differences in quality of life and in the number of participants
who left the study early, with evidence of very low and moderate
quality, respectively. No studies reported the number of adverse
events, and no studies measured anxiety and level of functioning.
Comparison 3. Active music therapy versus receptive
music therapy
Review authors found no significant differences between active
and receptive music therapy in severity of depressive symptoms for
both clinician-ratedandpatient-reportedoutcomes.We alsonoted
no differences in quality of life and in the number of participants
who left the study early. Quality of evidence was very low for all
outcomes. No studies reported the number of adverse events, and
no studies measured anxiety and level of functioning.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The present review included nine studies with a total of 421 partic-
ipants. Of these, we included 411 participants in the meta-analy-
sis. These individuals belonged to almost all age groups that could
be affected by a depressive disorder, from adolescents to older peo-
ple. However, investigators did not always report the specific type
of depressive disorder, and, in some cases, expert clinicians did not
perform diagnosis according to valid diagnostic criteria. Even if the
included studies comprised participants from a broad age range,
it would be useful to evaluate the effects of music therapy in larger
samples of adults with a specific diagnosis of major depressive dis-
order, which is a chronic and severe condition for which patients
might benefit from music therapy more than for minor depressive
disorders. Additionally, included studies did not evaluate depres-
sion, and future researchers should take this into consideration. As
clinical depression is not usually diagnosed in children, a future
review may need to apply wider inclusion criteria to encompass
studies that include this group. The largest randomised controlled
trial (RCT) of music therapy ever completed (n = 251) found that
children with emotional and behavioural problems aged 8 to 16
years who had received music therapy alongside treatment as usual
had significantly reduced symptoms of depression compared with
those who did not (Porter 2016).
With regards to the intervention, review authors considered ac-
tive, receptive, and mixed music therapy methods. Seven studies
conducted music therapy sessions in groups, and only two studies
provided individual sessions. This aspect is important to consider
because individual music therapy might be personalised and tai-
lored to the characteristics of individual patients and might show
a more beneficial effect than group sessions.

 It is important to mention that only single studies addressed some
outcomes (i.e. self-esteem, level of functioning), making these re-
sults not generalisable.
Quality of the evidence
Review authors rated quality of evidence for all comparisons us-
ing the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consis-
tency of effect, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias;
Schünemann 2009).
Limitations in study design or execution (risk of bias)
Concerning the main comparison, we downgraded the quality
of evidence for the following outcomes for risk of bias (e.g. un-
clear randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, absence of
a study protocol): clinician-rated depression, patient-reported de-
pression, leaving the study early, and anxiety. For both compar-
isons 2 and 3, we downgraded clinician-rated depression, patient-
reported depression, quality of life, and leaving the study early by
one level for similar reasons.
Inconsistency of results
We downgraded the quality of evidence by one level for incon-
sistency concerning anxiety in the main comparison and for pa-
tient-reported depression in the second comparison, because we
noted some variation in effect sizes, small or non-overlap of con-
fidence intervals, and high heterogeneity. Heterogeneity could be
explained by differences in age groups, methods of music therapy,
professionals providing music therapy, and quality of studies.
Indirectness of evidence
All included trials addressed the main review questions (PICO):
treatment of depression in men and women of any age group,
and receiving a music therapy intervention. Therefore, we did not
downgrade any outcome in all comparisons for indirectness of
evidence.
Imprecision
For the main comparison, we downgraded the quality of evidence
for adverse events, functioning, and quality of life by two levels
owing to wide confidence intervals, although we based this deci-
sion on an adequately powered, well-performed, and well-reported
trial (Erkkilä 2011). For the second comparison, we downgraded
clinician-rated depression and quality of life by two levels owing to
small sample size. For the same reason, we downgraded by two lev-
els the quality of evidence for clinician-rated depression, patient-
reported depression, quality of life, and leaving the study early in
the third comparison.
Publication bias
For all comparisons and for all outcomes, we did not downgrade
the quality of evidence for publication bias, as we did not detect
publication bias. We asked experts and known researchers in the
field whether they were aware of reported or ongoing trials on
music therapy for depression. We did not produce a funnel plot
to assess possible publication bias, as the total number of studies
(fewer than 10) meant that application of a formal test of asym-
metry was not appropriate (Sterne 2011).
Potential biases in the review process
We undertook an extensive search of databases and additional
sources and applied no restrictions concerning nationality or lan-
guage within the search process; thus we believe that we have iden-
tified and included in the present systematic review all potentially
relevant studies. We translated non-English abstracts into English
for assessment of eligibility. We translated possibly relevant and
relevantnon-English full-textstudyreportsintoEnglish,tofinalise
the eligibility process. We included relevant non-English articles
in the review. Furthermore, at least two review authors systemati-
cally extracted and managed trial data.
Some reports did not provide all information required to per-
form the meta-analysis (e.g. pre-post values, standard deviations).
In such cases, as stated in the methods and results sections, we
searched previously published literature (e.g. validation studies,
similar studies with large sample sizes) to retrieve the missing in-
formation. This may limit the accuracy of the results.
We attempted to conduct a comprehensive search for studies, but
the fact that studies found in the updated search have not yet been
incorporated may present a source of potential bias.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In the current literature, we found a limited number of studies
for comparison. Our meta-analysis confirms the conclusions of
Maratos 2008 and Assche 2015, which showed a beneficial effect
of music therapy on depressive symptoms. However, the previous
Cochrane review only narratively reviewed the efficacy of music
therapy for depression (Maratos 2008). Our findings are strength-
ened by the fact that data provided by included studies were meta-
analysed. Assche 2015 did not meta-analyse data from included
studies. Zhao 2016 considered music therapy for older adults only
andincludedtrialsthatassessedparticipantsand interventions that
were not eligible for this review. In a broader review, Gold 2009
noted beneficial effects of music therapy on depressive symptoms,
with a meta-regression analysis suggesting that effects increased
with the number of sessions.

Implications for practice
For people affected by depressive disorders
Evidence suggests that music therapy, when added to treatment as
usual (e.g. psychotherapy in combination with medication, col-
laborative care, occupational therapy), can help people affected
by depressive disorders, such as major depression, by improving
symptoms related to the condition (moderate quality) and its most
frequent comorbidities, such as anxiety (low quality). Additionally,
social, occupational, and psychological functioning may improve
among individuals who are involved in music therapy in addition
to treatment as usual (low-quality evidence). Music therapy was
not associated with more or fewer adverse events than treatment as
usual (low-quality evidence). We highlighted no differences in im-
proving depressive symptoms between a music therapy interven-
tion and a psychological therapy or medication only. We noted no
differences between active and receptive music therapy approaches
(very low-quality evidence).
Active participation is crucial for the success of music therapy.
Participants do not need musical skills, but motivation to work
actively within a music therapy process is important. Some char-
acteristics of these individuals, such as a tendency toward sym-
bolic processing and imagery, or particular personality traits, may
favour engagement in music therapy.
For clinicians
Music therapy, when added to treatment as usual, seems to im-
prove symptoms of depression (moderate-quality evidence). Mu-
sic therapy seems to be beneficial also for anxiety (low-quality ev-
idence), which is often a comorbidity of depression. Severely de-
pressed individuals often experience impairment in maintaining
relationships and work engagements. In this regard, evidence sug-
gests significant amelioration in the level of functioning among
those who attended music therapy sessions (low-quality evidence).
Improvements in depressive symptoms and functioning are likely
interrelated: Mitigation of depressive symptoms may lead to better
outcomes in the socio-occupational sphere, and vice versa. In fact,
positive effects might help support motivation as well as emotional
and relational competencies of people affected by depression, from
adolescents to older adults. Our results do not suggest superiority
of music therapy over other psychological therapies (evidence of
low to very low quality). Rather, music therapy should be consid-
ered in combination with standard care, with respect to patient
preferences. We do not know whether one form of music therapy
is better than another (very low-quality evidence).
When providing music therapy, clinicians must be mindful that
the specific methods and techniques of music therapy, including
among others adaptation of musical material to individual needs,
musical improvisation, and discussion of personal topics emerging
through musical processes, require specialised music therapy train-
ing. Training courses and qualified music therapists are available
in many countries, but in some countries, training programmes
of better quality may be needed.
For managers/policy makers
Evidence suggests that music therapy, when added to treatment
as usual, can help people affected by depressive disorders, such as
major depression, by improving symptoms related to depression
(moderate-quality evidence; large effect size for clinician-reported
depression and patient-reported depression) and its most frequent
comorbidities, such as anxiety (low-quality evidence). We are un-
certain whether music therapy is better than psychological ther-
apy (evidence of low to very low quality). Neither do we know
whether one form of music therapy is better than the other (very
low-quality evidence).
Depression incurs high costs for healthcare systems and for society
because it may cause impairment in both psychological and socio-
occupational functioning. Reductions in depressive and anxious
symptoms and consequent improvement in everyday life func-
tioning may reduce the costs that burden both healthcare systems
and society. Wider implementation may be slow because trained
music therapists are not available everywhere. Currently, around
6000 qualified music therapists are practising in Europe (EMTC
2017) and 7000 in the USA (CBMT 2017), with large differences
in numbers between and within countries.
Implications for research
In general, the quality of research concerning music therapy for
patients with depressive disorders could be improved. Future re-
searchers should adhere to guidelines such as the CONSORT
statement and should focus on particular points that deserve to be
addressed (Schulz 2010).
Characteristics of the population
Further research is needed on the effectiveness of music therapy for
adults with a specific diagnosis of major depressive disorder and
other depressive disorders. It appears of primary importance to
clarify the type of diagnosis, which should be possibly performed
by clinicians according to an international diagnostic classification
(e.g. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)), not just according
to self-reported scales or questionnaires. Additionally, it would be
desirable to investigate effects of music therapy both in recurrent
depressive disorders and in single depressive episodes.
Relatively little research has focused on working-age people with
depression. Only four of the nine included studies specifically
addressed this broad and important age group, although the largest
study did include working-age people. Future studies should also
consider depression in children and adolescents.

 Characteristics of the intervention
Music therapy characteristics
Future reports should better describe characteristics of the mu-
sic therapy approaches adopted in these trials. Researchers should
clearly describe the aims and rationale and specific methods, tech-
niques, and procedures implemented by music therapists. First, it
should be more consistently stated whether or not the interven-
tion is conducted by a trained music therapist or a music therapy
trainee. Interventions developed and conducted in trials by a cer-
tified music therapist are needed. Second, a thorough description
of the interventions appears essential, to give professionals the op-
portunity to learn and apply effective methods and techniques in
their clinical practice, as well as in music therapy training pro-
grammes and future trials. The topic of treatment fidelity is also
relevant (Erkkilä 2014). In fact, only one study reported that ther-
apists participated in extensive training to guarantee reliability of
the intervention provided (Erkkilä 2011).
It would be desirable to conduct trials in which different music
therapy methods are adopted, such as active and receptive music
therapy or combinations thereof. This would be important for
improved understanding of which form of music therapy could be
better tolerated and more pleasant and beneficial for participants,
as well as for enhanced knowledge of the mechanisms underlying
treatmenteffects.Itcouldalsobe hypothesisedthataportionof the
population is more likely to respond positively to music therapy
as the result of individual features. This information could prove
helpful in the development of different music therapy techniques
that can be tailored to patient characteristics.
Duration of the intervention
To date, researchers have mainly considered short-term interven-
tions and have provided limited attention to long-term effects of
music therapy extending over more than six months. Actually, only
one study evaluated effects of the intervention at medium term (
Erkkil 2011). Interventions of longer duration and longer follow-
up periods are needed to better elucidate the medium-term and
long-term effects of music therapy on symptoms of depression and
its correlates. This is particularly important because the length of
trials often does not reflect the complexity of therapeutic processes,
which usually last months or years.
Additionally, it would be useful to know the rate of attendance of
participants at music therapy sessions; this information is rarely
reported. In fact, analyses considering patient compliance could be
useful toward understanding whether treatment adherence might
influence outcomes.
Dosage of the intervention
Studies randomising high versus low ’dosage’ of music therapy
would be required. Such trials would require considerably larger
sample sizes because expected differences in effect sizes between
two active treatments will be smaller than those between music
therapy as add-on treatment and standard care alone.
Outcomes
This review indicates that reduction in symptoms of depression
and anxiety could be identified as the most frequently assessed out-
comes. These are of general clinical importance in mental health
care, but other health-related aspects (e.g. quality of life, level of
functioning, personality, self-esteem) supported by music therapy
could be similarly relevant to both the patient and the music ther-
apeutic method. Of note, none of the included studies addressed
outcomes such as cost, cost-effectiveness, or satisfaction with treat-
ment. To gain knowledge about effects, mechanisms, and ingredi-
ents of music therapy for depression, better-designed trials must
include similar and meaningful outcomes, as well as mixed meth-
ods and outcomes more directly related to music therapy processes,
such as the impact of music elements and specific music therapy
techniques.
The studies included under Studies awaiting classification, once
assessed, may alter the conclusions of this review.

Outcomes
Clinician-rated depression: HRSD
Patient-reported depression: BDI
Notes
Funding for trial: not reported
Notable conflicts: not reported
Other: none
Key conclusions: (1) Individuals with substance abuse showed significant improvement in
clinician-reported depression (HRSD) as a result of improvisation therapy, but did not
show significant improvement in patient-reported depression (BDI), when compared
with individuals in regular treatment programme alone. (2) Psychologists apparently
perceived greater improvement in depression among participants than participants per-
ceived in themselves
Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
The investigators describe a random com-
ponent in the sequence generation process
Quote: “Each set of newly admitted pa-
tients who met inclusion criteria was ran-
domly assigned to the experimental or con-
trol condition. A statistician used the Ex-
cel1 program to generate random number
lists in blocks; each list contained the num-
bers of subjects to be assigned to control
and experimental groups.”
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
Participants and investigators enrolling
participants could not foresee assignment
Quote: “Sequentially numbered envelopes
were created to ensure allocation conceal-
ment.“
Blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk
Personnel were blinded. For participants,
blinding was not possible
Quote: ”The psychologist provided an eval-
uation of the participant’s level of depres-
sion on the HRSD. The psychologist did
notknowwhich participantswere inthe ex-
perimental and control groups. Moreover,
the psychologist did not treat any of the
participants.“
Quote: ”Dependent variables used in this
study were: (1) self-rated depression scores
on the BDI, and (2) psychologist-rated de-
pression scores on the HRSD.“

Aims and rationale: to decrease depressive symptoms
Method: active music therapy
What was done:(materials) digital piano, accordion, guitar, violin, erhu, several types
of percussion instruments; enough material to ensure that 1 was available for every
procedure; (procedures) the doctor and the music therapist chose lyrical, smooth, and
livelily music. The choice of music was based on the participant’s situation. The music
therapist also wrote 9 songs based on participant preferences. These songs had been
evaluated by composers and psychiatrists, who considered them suitable for use in the
treatment of geriatric depression, easy to learn, and having a clear rhythm. Apart from the
musical performance, the music therapist wrote a number of songs in call and response
style, in which a question-answer pattern in the music was used to ask participants
whether they had slept well and what they had on their mind; these questions and
answers allowed for an emotional connection with participants and gave rise to emotional
resonance, which increased emotional response and interest in life;(mode of delivery) face-
to-face; (co-interventions) standard care, e.g. medication and hospitalisation; (medication)

Key conclusions: (1) Results of this report show that under equivalent conditions, partic-
ipants with geriatric depression treated with music therapy showed quicker alleviation
of clinical symptoms, and the dose of medication was lower, with lighter side effects.
(2) Data show no significant differences between results of music therapy in terms of
individual symptoms, and no relation with whether or not participants had a musical
hobby. (3) Easy-listening, smooth, and lively music was accepted more easily by par-
ticipants with geriatric depression and yielded better treatment results. (4) The rate of
bedriddenness decreased over the course of treatment. The atmosphere in the patient
area was lively, and worry and fear among older adults with regard to hospitalisation were
eliminated. Music therapy is a way for participant and the therapist to communicate
emotions, mobilise participant co-operation in treatment, and decrease the difficulty of
nursing those with geriatric depression. This benefited management of the treatment
area

Name of intervention: home-based music therapy
Aims and rationale: stress reduction, provide pleasant experiences, compatible with dys-
functional thinking and depressed mood, to improve self-esteem
Method: receptive music therapy
What was done:(materials) set of music-facilitated techniques, when necessary cassette
players, additional tapes;(procedures) appropriate music was selected by participants with
assistance of a registered and board-certified music therapist and after participants were
interviewed. After observing relaxation response, music was recommended. Music ther-
apist recommended music. Participants were instructed to find some time each day to
practice techniques, also to complete a music listening log. The therapist introduced
a single technique every week;(mode of delivery) face-to-face; (co-interventions) no co-
interventions; (medication) no medication
Location: at home
Tailoring (how, when, why, what): The therapist interviewed participants individually
to determine music preferences and previous experiences with music and helped them
to identify compositions that had been paired with positive associations or meaningful
memories.Wheneverpossible,familiarmusic, preferablyfromthe participant’scollection
of recordings, was recommended to accompany the various techniques

new behaviours, especially in relating to other people in 4 phases: phase 1: preparation
of residents for cognitive therapy; phase 2: basic techniques for changing behaviour;
phase 3: basic techniques for changing cognition; phase 4: preparation of residents for
termination of treatment;(mode of delivery) face-to-face;(co-interventions) not reported;
(medication) not reported
Location: private meeting rooms
Tailoring (how, when, why, what): not reported
Modification intervention: not reported
Quality of delivery: Preparation of group leaders was carried out in videotaped sessions,
instructions, role playing, brief lectures, blackboard demonstrations, case studies, and
homework assignments of reading the cognitive therapy manual and listening to cassette
tapes on techniques. Performance of leaders was rated by their group members
Intensity of sessions: twice weekly

Duration of treatment: 10 weeks
Delivered number of sessions: not reported
Individual or group: group of 20, divided into 3 smaller groups
Who delivered intervention: group leaders: professional personnel of the nursing home;
nurses; 2 RNs and 1 social worker
Therapist training: 1 Associate degree in nursing and a Bachelor of Science in education;
1 diploma in nursing; social worker had a Bachelor of Arts degree in social psychology
and experience in the field of social work
Therapist’s post-qualifying experience: varied from a first job to semiretirement
Monitoring of adherence to paradigm/protocol: Attendance records were kept to determine
if residents would attend the groups regularly

Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Unclear risk
Information about the sequence generation
process was insufficient to permit judge-
ment of ‘Low risk’ or ‘High risk’
The method of randomisation was not re-
ported.
Quote: “Those who qualified as moderately
to severely depressed and free from organic
brain syndrome were randomly assigned to
one of three groups.”
Allocation concealment (selection bias)

In compliance with developments in systematic review methods since publication of the first version of this review (Maratos 2008), we
have made a distinction between primary and secondary outcomes. To avoid lack of balance and the possibility of bias, we added adverse
events as a primary outcome (Higgins 2015). We added anxiety as a secondary outcome because anxiety is a common comorbidity with
depression (Gotlib 2014). We examined clinician-rated and patient-reported depression separately to retain both sources of information
and because many studies reported both; the Cochrane Group approved this change. We commented on the quality of the body evidence
using GRADE profile software and included ’Summary of findings’ tables as recommended by Higgins and colleagues (Higgins 2015).
We submitted these protocol amendments and received approval before we began work on the review update.
