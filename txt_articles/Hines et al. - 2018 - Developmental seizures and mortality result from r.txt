Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission is mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors
(GABAARs) that are enriched at functionally diverse synapses via mechanisms that remain
unclear. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and complementary methods we demonstrate
an exclusive low micromolar binding of collybistin to the α2-subunit of GABAARs. To explore
the biological relevance of collybistin-α2-subunit selectivity, we generate mice with a
mutation in the α2-subunit-collybistin binding region (Gabra2-1). The mutation results in loss
of a distinct subset of inhibitory synapses and decreased amplitude of inhibitory synaptic
currents. Gabra2–1 mice have a striking phenotype characterized by increased susceptibility
to seizures and early mortality. Surviving Gabra2-1 mice show anxiety and elevations in
electroencephalogram δ power, which are ameliorated by treatment with the α2/α3-selective
positive modulator, AZD7325. Taken together, our results demonstrate an α2-subunit
selective binding of collybistin, which plays a key role in patterned brain activity, particularly
during development.

he brain functions via a dynamic partnership between
excitatory principal cells and inhibitory interneurons,
ensuring regulation of global cell firing rates, yet allowing
for local control of excitability. Fast inhibitory synaptic trans-
mission is mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors
(GABAARs), which are composed of combinations of subunit
families α(1–6), β(1–3), γ(1–3), δ, ε, θ, and π1. Despite GABAAR-
α-subunits being highly homologous, they are known to be spe-
cifically localized, with GABAARs containing α1 enriched at
dendritic and somatic synapses, and α2 localized to synapses on
the axon initial segment (AIS)2–4. It has been long speculated that
α-subunits are prime mediators in selective targeting5; however,
the precise mechanisms regulating this targeting remain unclear.
Comparison of α1 and α2 structures reveals that the large
intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is the
most divergent, but its necessity for targeting is unclear. Given the
important role of AIS synapses in regulating excitatory cell out-
put6,7, and that α-subunit isoforms determine the decay of inhi-
bitory postsynaptic currents8, enrichment of α2 to AIS synapses
may profoundly affect neuronal excitability. Therefore, it is of
fundamental importance to understand how neurons regulate the
formation of synapse subtypes and control selective targeting of
α2-containing GABAARs.
A well-known inhibitory synaptic organizer, gephyrin, has
been shown to interact with multiple α-subunits of GABAARs9–
12. Structural and mutational studies have identified a universal
binding site within gephyrin that allows for the alternative
recruitment of glycine and GABAAR subunits9. Mutations that
weaken the receptor–gephyrin interaction have been shown to
alter receptor accumulation, diffusion, clustering, and transport,
and can be related to severe phenotypes, including epilepsy13–15.
Early studies demonstrated a link between the GABAAR-α2-
subunit and gephyrin11, however, quantification of the interaction
later revealed a very low interaction strength16. Collybistin (CB;
ARHGEF9) has also been shown to interact with gephyrin, as well
as GABAARs17–20, but quantification of the interaction strength
has not been possible. CB and its human homolog hPEM-2
(human homolog of posterior end mark-2) are guanine nucleo-
tide exchange factors that activate the small GTPase CDC-42,
regulating the actin cytoskeleton21. CB is generally composed of a
catalytic Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, a
pleckstrin homology (PH) phosphoinositide-binding domain, as
well as an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Yeast-two-hybrid
(Y2H)
assays
suggested
the
GABAAR-α2-subunit19
and
neuroligin-222 as possible activators for CB by directly interacting
with the SH3 domain, resulting in its release from the PH and
DH domains. Mapping studies proposed an overlapping binding
site for gephyrin and CB on the large intracellular loop of the
GABAAR-α2-subunit, and it has been suggested that synergistic
binding could produce a tripartite complex19.
The study of both mouse models and human neurodevelop-
mental syndromes characterized by CB loss supports a functional
link to GABAARs. Deletion of Arhgef9 in mice leads to selective
reductions in the number of inhibitory synapses within the hip-
pocampus21,23. A naturally occurring missense mutation of
ARHGEF9 (G55A) is associated with hyperekplexia, epilepsy, and
mental retardation24,25, and has been shown to disrupt the
clustering of α2-containing GABAARs and gephyrin19. Similarly,
a translocation mutation within the ARHGEF9 gene has been
shown to result in a neurodevelopmental syndrome that includes
epilepsy, anxiety, aggressive behavior, sleep–wake disruptions,
and mental retardation, but not hyperekplexia24,26,27, suggesting
a broad disruption of GABAergic but not glycinergic signaling in
this variant of the disorder. Despite these findings, the respective
affinity
of
CB
for
specific
GABAAR
subunits
remains
unknown24,28.
Further,
the
precise
molecular
and
cellular
mechanisms mediating the severe symptoms seen following
mutations in ARHGEF9 remain unknown.
Using isothermal titration calorimetry and complementary
methods, we identify an exclusive binding of CB to the GABAAR-
α2-subunit. Notably, this is the first report of a high-affinity
protein interaction for both CB and α2. To reveal the biological
relevance, we create a novel knock-in mouse where amino acids
358–375 from the α1 loop are substituted into α2 (Gabra2-1), a
substitution that reduces CB binding. This mutation alters the
expression of α2 and CB, inhibitory current amplitude and decay
time, and results in the loss of AIS synapses. Gabra2-1 mice
display a remarkable phenotype characterized by spontaneous
seizures and early mortality, reminiscent of the human syndrome
linked to ARHGEF9 mutation. Surviving Gabra2-1 mice do not
show behavioral seizures, but are more susceptible to seizure
induction by kainate. Gabra2-1 mice also display anxiety-like
behavior, and an enhancement of power in the δ-band using
electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, both of which are ame-
liorated by treatment with the α2/α3-selective GABAAR positive
modulator AZD7325.
Results
Collybistin binds the GABAAR-α2-subunit with high affinity.
Quantitative binding studies have shown that gephyrin displays a
subunit binding profile that dictates receptor recruitment9,16.
Prompted by Y2H studies reporting GABAAR-CB interactions19,
we speculated that CB might display subunit specificity. We used
purified proteins, including the GABAAR-α1, -α2, and -α3 loops,
the SH3 domain of CB (CB-SH3), and the E domain of gephyrin
(GephE; Fig. 1a). We applied mixtures of purified CB-SH3 and
the intracellular loops of GABAAR-α1–3 to native agarose gel
electrophoresis (NAGE) for identification of low affinity inter-
actions by altered migration of the native proteins upon complex
formation. While the SH3-GABAAR-α1L and -α2L complexes are
retained in the pocket, the GABAAR-α3-subunit allows SH3 to
enter the gel (Fig. 1b), suggesting that -α1L and -α2L (but not
-α3L) are capable of forming a complex with CB-SH3.
To estimate the stability of the GABAAR-SH3 complexes we
further characterized them by analytical size exclusion chroma-
tography (SEC). Either single proteins (Fig. 1c top) or equimolar
mixtures of the SH3 domain combined with either -α1L, -α2L, or
-α3L were applied to a column and the resulting fractions were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. While the NAGE-assay revealed an SH3-
α1L complex, SEC analysis demonstrated its low stability, as the
SH3 domain elution profile was unaltered by -α1L (Fig. 1c). In
line with the NAGE experiments, -α3L did not alter SH3 elution
(Fig. 1c). SEC demonstrated a tight SH3-α2L complex, resulting
in a significant 10 ml shift of the SH3 domain toward higher
molecular weights and correspondingly lower elution volumes
(Fig. 1c). Taken together, the SEC and NAGE results define a
weak SH3-α1L complex and a tight SH3-α2L complex.
Encouraged by the NAGE and SEC, we next quantified the
interactions using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; Fig. 1d).
ITC revealed that the -α2L forms a tight complex (Kd = 1 μM),
while -α1L forms a rather weak complex (Kd ~500 μM; Table 1).
To narrow down the GABAAR-α2 binding site, we determined
the SH3 affinity of different truncated constructs. The first half of
the
receptor large
intracellular
loop displayed
an
affinity
comparable to the full-length receptor loop (Supplementary
Table 1). Further N-terminal truncations of this construct
significantly decreased the SH3 affinity (Supplementary Table 2),
suggesting an important role of secondary structure and/or
cooperative effects for this interaction.
Based on the proposal of a tripartite complex19, and the
overlapping binding site of GephE and CB-SH3 on -α2L, we

 probed these interactions for possible synergistic or competitive
binding. This set of experiments revealed that GephE and CB-
SH3 do not interact but instead compete for -α2L (Fig. 1e). After
verification of an overlapping -α2L binding site for GephE and
CB-SH3, we explored whether GephE can modulate the binding
of SH3-α2L. Therefore, we titrated -α2L in the presence or
absence of GephE with the SH3 domain (Fig. 1f). While the heat
signatures were altered by differing concentrations of the -α2L,
curve fitting revealed that the interaction strength remained
unaltered in the presence of gephyrin (Fig. 1f). To compare the
interaction of the full-length proteins, we performed GFP bead
trap assays with pHlorin-tagged-α2, or a mutant form of pHlorin-
tagged-α2, wherein amino acids 358–375 within the intracellular
loop were replaced with those from GABAAR-α1 (α2–1; Fig. 2),
which were expressed along with CB in human embryonic kidney
(HEK) cells. We found that pHlorin-α2 could coimmunopreci-
pitate CB, while pHlorin-α2–1 coimmunoprecipitated signifi-
cantly lower amounts of CB (Fig. 2b, c). These results validate
that amino acids 358–375 within the intracellular loop of
GABAAR-α2 are also important for interaction with CB in
the context of the full-length proteins. Taken together, we
establish a complementary subunit preference of CB compared to
gephyrin, and competition between both proteins for α2-subunit
binding.

Fig. 1 Analyzing the interaction of GABAAR α subunits with collybistin. a Cartoon showing the purified proteins used for biochemical studies of α-subunit
interaction with gephyrin and CB. b Receptor subunits were subject to NAGE (pockets mark sites of protein application) followed by coomassie staining,
revealing that α-subunit loops slowly migrate to the cathode. CB-SH3 alone or mixed with a threefold excess of GABAAR intracellular domains reveals that
α2L markedly alters the migration of SH3 (red arrow). c SEC analysis was used to explore the behavior of CB-SH3 alone or when mixed with equimolar
amounts of α1L, α2L, or α3L. Fusion proteins were detected in eluates using absorbance at 280 nM and coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE (insets),
verifying the presence of the SH3 domain at lower elution volumes in the fraction containing α2L. d CB-SH3 was titrated against α1L and α2L. The measured
binding enthalpies are plotted as a function of the molar ratio of the SH3 domain to the GABAAR α1 and α2 loops. e GephE and GephE + CB-SH3 were
subject to NAGE. The migration of the respective proteins is indicated. In presence of the SH3 domain the migration of gephyrin is not altered indicating
that the proteins do not interact on NAGE (left panel). GephE in the presence of a fivefold molar excess of α2L is partly retained in the pocket and partly
migrates towards the anode (lane 1 right panel). Addition of increasing amounts of the SH3 domain to the GephE-α2L complex allows more gephyrin to
enter the gel and migrate towards the anode. At the same time SH3 binding to α2L retains SH3 in the pocket. This indicates that SH3 and gephyrin compete
for α2 binding. f CB-SH3 was titrated against α2L alone or in combination with GephE, and the measured binding enthalpies are plotted

 A mouse model with reduced collybistin-GABAAR-α2 binding.
After having identified a tight complex between CB and the
GABAAR-α2-subunit, we next wanted to investigate the func-
tional and physiological relevance of this interaction, due to the
implications of ARHGEF9 mutations in human disease24,26,27. To
do so, we generated a knock-in mouse where amino acids
358–375 within the large intracellular loop of GABAAR-α2 were
replaced by those of GABAAR-α1 (Gabra2–1; Fig. 3a).
To confirm the Gabra2–1 mutation we amplified this portion
of genomic DNA from wildtype and homozygous Gabra2–1 mice
and sequenced the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product
(Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 1B, C). Sequencing results showed
the site of mutation, and the predicted amino acid sequence
alignments revealed insertion of the gephyrin-binding motif
(GABAAR-α1 loop) into α210 (Fig. 3b), comparable to the
alignment of α1 and α2 (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Further
validation was obtained using an antibody that recognizes the α2-
subunit loop (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 2), which showed a
reduction in antibody recognition by a factor of ~2 in
hippocampal lysates from heterozygous mice, and a complete
loss in homozygotes. Using an antibody that recognizes the α2-
subunit c-terminus we could demonstrate that α2 expression is
maintained in Gabra2–1 mice (Fig. 3c). We also examined the
expression of gephyrin and collybistin in hippocampal lysates and
found that although total gephyrin was unchanged, collybistin
decreased in expression in Gabra2–1 mice relative to control

 (Fig. 3d). To examine the regional expression of α2, we conducted
DAB immunostaining using a GABAAR-α2-subunit c-terminal
antibody comparing Gabra2–1 mice to wildtype controls (Fig. 3e,
Supplementary Fig. 3A). GABAAR-α2-subunit c-terminal immu-
noreactivity was generally increased in Gabra2–1, with cortex,
basal forebrain, and hippocampus showing increases (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3B, C). Within the hippocampus, GABAAR-α2-
subunit immunoreactivity was increased along the cell body layer
of CA1, and in the molecular layer (Supplementary Fig. 3C).
These studies confirmed effective Gabra2–1 loop mutation, and
demonstrated that the mutated α2-subunit is stably expressed.
Mislocalization of GABAAR-α2 and collybistin in Gabra2-1. To
investigate clustering of inhibitory synaptic proteins we con-
ducted immunofluorescent staining for GABAAR-α2, -α1, CB,
and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT; Fig. 4). Consistent
with our immunoblotting and DAB immunohistochemistry
(IHC) findings, we saw an increase in the total number of α2
clusters (Fig. 4a, c), although these clusters were reduced in size
(Fig.
4b).
Examination
of
α1-subunit
immunofluorescence
revealed no significant change in either the size or density of
positive clusters (Fig. 4d, e; Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). The
relationship between cluster size and intensity revealed a shift
toward an increased number of smaller clusters of α2 in
Gabra2–1,
whereas
the
α1
relationship
appears
unaltered
(Fig. 4e). Examination of CB immunostaining revealed a dramatic
reduction in CB positive cluster size and number (Fig. 4f, h, i),
while immunostaining for VGAT revealed no significant change
in Gabra2–1 (Fig. 4g, j; Supplementary Fig. 4C). As a secondary
measure of inhibitory presynaptic terminals we also stained for
glutamate decarboxylase (GAD-65), which was also unaffected by
the Gabra2–1 mutation (Supplementary Fig. 4F). To further
evaluate inhibitory synapses we also assessed the colocalization of
gephyrin and α2, as well as VGAT and α2. No change was
observed in either the percentage of gephyrin colocalized with α2,
or VGAT colocalized with α2 (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). A
decrease in the percentage of α2 clusters colocalized with both
gephyrin (Supplementary Fig. 5), and VGAT (Supplementary
Fig. 6) declined upon Gabra2-1 mutation, which may reflect the
increased expression and more diffuse localization of α2. These
changes, however, do not reflect a loss of total numbers of inhi-
bitory synapses, evidenced by unchanged VGAT and GAD-65
immunoreactivity, and maintenance of VGAT, and gephyrin,
colocalization with α2. Taken together, the replacement of the CB
binding site in α2 resulted in loss of CB and altered GABAAR-α2-
subunit cluster distribution.
Smaller sIPSC amplitude and faster decay time in Gabra2-1.
Our immunoblotting and IHC experiments demonstrate mod-
ifications in the expression and clustering of α2. Based on these
findings we assessed the impact of the Gabra2–1 mutation on
inhibitory synaptic signaling. To address this, we recorded
spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in CA1 prin-
cipal neurons of hippocampal slices at postnatal day (PND)
2129,30 (Fig. 5). Quantification of sIPSC amplitudes revealed a
significant decrease in Gabra2-1 heterozygous and homozygous
slices compared to littermate controls (Fig. 5b, c). Analysis
revealed a decrease of sIPSC decay times in CA1 neurons com-
pared to littermate controls (Fig. 5d, e). Previous studies have
indicated that the α-subunit in part determines the decay of
GABAAR-mediated currents, thus this result may suggest a
replacement of α2- with α1-subunits in CA18,31. Assessments of
sIPSC frequency did not reveal a significant difference between
Gabra2–1 slices and littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. 7).
These results reveal that despite no loss of inhibitory synaptic
contacts, Gabra2–1 mice have compromised inhibitory synaptic
transmission that may be related to a decrease in α2 cluster size.
Loss of GABAAR-α2 clusters at specific types of synapses.
GABAARs containing α2 have been identified at a variety of
different types of synaptic contacts, but are strongly enriched at
synaptic contacts onto the AIS2–4, hence we examined the sub-
cellular localization of α2. We began by culturing cortical cells to
more readily identify the AIS (pan-Na+ channel antibody), and
colabeled for the GABAAR-α2 subunit, which revealed a dramatic
loss of α2-subunit clusters on the AIS in Gabra2–1 derived cul-
tures (Fig. 6a, b). We followed with colocalization of α2 with PV
(marker for interneurons including axo-axonic chandelier cells
and terminals), and CB1R (marker for CCK positive basket cell
terminals) in cortical sections. Overlay images reveal segregated
populations of GABAAR-α2-subunit clusters (Fig. 6c) where α2
can be seen colocalized with either PV (teal–green + blue), or
CB1R (yellow–green + red) in zoomed panels. Despite a total
increase in GABAAR-α2 cluster density in Gabra2-1 mice, there
was a significant decrease in the percent of α2 colocalized with PV
(Fig. 6c, d). Percent colocalization with CB1R positive clusters
was not altered (Fig. 6c, e). These findings suggest a specific loss
of α2 positive clusters opposing contacts from PV positive cells,
including chandelier cells. To follow up on this, we examined the
number of inhibitory presynaptic contacts stained with VGAT,
onto the AIS of cortical pyramidal cells (Fig. 6f). We found that
both heterozygous and homozygous cells showed a significant
reduction in the number of VGAT positive clusters per 5 µm AIS
(Fig. 6f, g). The number of VGAT positive clusters per 100 µm2 of
soma was unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 4D, E). These data
indicate a selective loss of α2 opposed to PV positive contacts,
paralleled by a reduction of VGAT positive clusters along the AIS.

in
Gabra2–1. Gabra2–1 mice are viable and fertile, but a subset of
heterozygous and homozygous Gabra2–1 pups die prior to
weaning, with the peak of mortality falling on PND 20 (Fig. 7a).
At PND 5, wildtype × heterozygous matings produce normal
Mendelian ratios (1:1 wt:het), whereas pups genotyped following
weaning are approximately 63% wildtype and 37% heterozygous,
further demonstrating mortality in Gabra2–1 prior to weaning,
but after PND 5. We genotyped the offspring found dead from
heterozygous × heterozygous mating pairs and found that when
corrected for predicted offspring ratio (2:1 het:homo), hetero-
zygous and homozygous offspring have similar likelihood of
mortality, but homozygous mice appear to die earlier in devel-
opment (mode: het = PND 20, homo = PND 17; Fig. 7b). A
representative survival plot from a heterozygous × homozygous
mating, again reflects the peak of mortality around PND 20
(Fig. 7c). We also compared the percentage of litters that had one
or more dead pups, and the percentage of pups weaned com-
paring all mating schemes (shown on the x-axis; Fig. 7d, e). Dead
pups were rarely found in wildtype × wildtype mating pairs and
approximately 98% of wildtype pups born survive through
weaning. In contrast, Gabra2–1 mating schemes had at least 69%
of litters with one or more pups found dead after PND 5, and
only about 36% of pups born survive through weaning in
Gabra2–1 homozygous mating pairs.
We evaluated failure to thrive by assessing size, weight, and
gross physical development of Gabra2–1 pups, finding no
difference from wildtype (Supplementary Fig. 8A, B, Supplemen-
tary Table 4). Extensive monitoring did reveal the occurrence of
rare spontaneous seizures in Gabra2–1 offspring, with clear
behavioral characteristics that we classified according to the
Racine scale (Fig. 7f; Supplementary Movie 1). To confirm this

recordings also revealed increased sensitivity to kainate, with all
Gabra2–1 mice developing status epilepticus (SE—less than a 2-

developed SE. The latency to the development of SE was reduced
in Gabra2–1 mice (Fig. 7h, i), while latency to the first seizure
event did not differ (Fig. 7h, j). Gabra2–1 mice also have seizure
events of increased duration (Fig. 7h, k). Taken together,

 to evaluate hyperekplexia, which is linked to glycine receptor
function33 and human mutations in ARHGEF924, revealed no
significant difference between Gabra2–1 and littermate controls
(Supplementary Fig. 8E, F). We also evaluated the possibility of a
deficit in prepulse inhibition due to reports of mislocalization of
the GABAAR-α2-subunit on the AIS in post mortem tissue from
schizophrenic patients34, but no difference was detected between
Gabra2–1 mice and littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. 8G,
H). Next, we assessed anxiety behavior, due to the role of the
GABAAR-α2-subunit in mediating the anxiolytic effects of ben-
zodiazepines35. Using both the light–dark boxes and elevated plus
maze, we detected increased anxiety behavior in Gabra2–1 mice
shown by increases in total time spent in the dark chamber, and
percent time spent in the closed arms respectively (Fig. 8a, b).
Due to the low numbers of viable homozygotes we examined the
responsiveness of Gabra2–1 heterozygotes to the nonselective
benzodiazepine, diazepam (2 mg kg−1), and the α2/α3-selective
GABAAR positive modulator AZD7325 (3 mg kg−1). As expected,
wildtype mice showed a reduction in anxiety behavior following
treatment with either diazepam or AZD7325 as evidenced by an
increased percent time spent in the open arms (Fig. 8c), and
increased open arm entries (Supplementary Fig. 9A). In contrast,

 Gabra2–1 mice did not show a reduction in anxiety behavior
following diazepam treatment, but were responsive to treatment
with AZD7325 (Fig. 8c, d; Supplementary Fig. 9A). Analysis of
total distance traveled did not reveal any differences in explora-
tion of the maze between genotypes, or treatment compared to
vehicle control (Supplementary Fig. 9B). It is possible that
Gabra2–1 mice require an increased dose of diazepam to exert
anxiolytic effects; however, higher doses of diazepam cause
sedation. As such, we also examined the responsiveness of
Gabra2–1 mice to sedative doses of diazepam (10 mg kg−1) to
rule out any difference in drug metabolism. We found no dif-
ference in the sedative effects of diazepam comparing wildtype
and Gabra2–1 mice (Supplementary Fig. 9C, D). These results
suggest that Gabra2–1 mice display an anxiety phenotype pos-
sibly related to impaired clustering and function of α2-containing
GABAARs.
We next assessed adult Gabra2–1 mice for baseline abnorm-
alities in EEG recordings. Gabra2–1 mice and controls were
recorded during 1 h of wakefulness at least one week following
implantation.
Representative
spectrograms
and
fast-Fourier
analysis revealed increased power of specific frequency bands
when Gabra2–1 mice and littermate controls were compared
(Fig. 8e, f). To examine this more closely, we parsed the EEG into
frequency bands as follows: δ (0.25-4 Hz), θ (4–12 Hz), α (12–18
Hz), β (18–30 Hz), and γ (>30 Hz), revealing an elevation
particularly in δ and θ ranges in Gabra2–1 mice (Fig. 8g;
Supplementary Fig. 10). To follow up on the findings with anxiety
behavior, we investigated the beneficial effects of AZD7325 (3 mg
kg−1) in correcting the EEG abnormalities in Gabra2–1 (Fig. 8e,
g). We found that AZD7325 was successful in reducing EEG δ
and θ power in Gabra2–1 mice (Fig. 8e, g; Supplementary
Fig. 10A–E). We also found that AZD7325 resulted in increases
in the power of high frequency bands in both wildtype and
Gabra2–1 heterozygotes (Supplementary Fig. 10F, G) similar to
previous findings36. Diazepam is also known to suppress δ-power,
so we conducted assessment of the response to diazepam
following 1 h of baseline EEG, comparing wildtype to Gabra2–1.
Diazepam suppressed δ in wildtype mice, but not in Gabra2–1
mice (Supplementary Fig. 10H), which is in keeping with the lack
of behavioral response to diazepam (Fig. 8c, d). Collectively, the
EEG analysis revealed abnormally elevated δ power in Gabra2–1
mice compared to wildtype controls, which could be alleviated by
treatment with AZD7325 but not diazepam, mirroring the
behavioral results.
Discussion
We show that the CB-SH3 domain specifically binds the
GABAAR-α2-subunit loop with low micromolar affinity, which is
the strongest interaction identified for both proteins to date.
Despite its high affinity, the interacting α2-subunit fragment is
devoid of canonical PxxP motifs, indicating an atypical SH3
interaction. Earlier Y2H studies demonstrated that full-length CB
and gephyrin together exhibit a potentiated GABAAR-α2 affi-
nity19. Our results exclude a possible gephyrin-SH3 domain
interaction, as well as synergistic binding to the GABAAR-α2-
subunit in the presence of gephyrin. Instead we propose that
Y2H-demonstration of gephyrin’s ability to amplify CB’s binding
uncovered gephyrin-mediated un-masking of CB-SH337. Isolated
CB-SH3 therefore might exhibit the maximal affinity displayed by
CB after full activation by gephyrin37. Comparison with gephyrin
reveals a striking reciprocal relationship in CB-affinities with
different α-subunits. A possible gephyrin–CB complex would,
therefore, have the potential to interact with all three synaptic α-
subunits, thus explaining reports of both CB and gephyrin
colocalizing with GABAARs containing α1–3-subunits. Therefore,
our results indicate that the molecular basis of GABAAR and,
possibly, also GlyR accumulation at synaptic sites lies in the so far
unknown architecture and modulation of the CB–gephyrin
complex, as well as in its exact interplay with other binding
partners (PI3P, neuroligin-2, and CDC 42).
Both GABAAR-subunits38–40 and CB24–27 have been impli-
cated in human disease. We have previously shown that GABAAR
signaling can be modulated by interfering with the underlying
protein–protein interactions41,42. Here, we used a novel mouse
expressing a chimeric α2–α1 loop to investigate the dis-
ease relevance of the CB-GABAAR-α2 interaction. The Gabra2–1
mutation reduces GABAAR-α2 interaction with CB in vitro, and
results in an increase in α2, but a decrease in CB expression
in vivo. The increase in α2 density may reflect an increased sta-
bility due to interaction with gephyrin or other partners in place
of CB, or may reflect poor clustering of α2-containing receptors,
which is suggested by decreased cluster size and reduced mIPSC
amplitude. Although the Gabra2–1 mutation appears to reduce
clustering of α2-containing receptors, we do not see a detectable
reduction in the size or density of VGAT (or GAD-65) positive
clusters, or when measured specifically on the soma, or in the
proportion of VGAT clusters that have α2, suggesting no wide-
spread loss of inhibitory synaptic contacts. These results suggest
that the Gabra2–1 mutation is impairing the interaction of α2
with CB, leading to reduced clustering of α2-containing receptors
and increased turnover of CB. CB-KO mice show a loss of α2-
containing GABAARs in CA1 pyramidal cells, accompanied by a
loss of gephyrin and α1-containing GABAARs23. In contrast, PV
interneurons retain gephyrin and α1 expression upon CB KO23.
This may suggest that CA1 pyramidal cells express heteromeric
α1–α2 receptors, which rely upon CB–α2 for expression and
retention at synapses, while other cells expressing GABAARs with
two α1-subunits are not impacted by the loss of CB–α2 interac-
tion43. We also found that the Gabra2–1 mutation has a

 significant effect on inhibitory synaptic currents recorded from
CA1, reducing their amplitude and accelerating decay time. A
decrease in decay time in Gabra2–1 slices likely reflects the loss of
effective activation of α2-containing GABAARs, which have been
shown to display a 2–6 times slower deactivation8,31.
As we could not detect a reduction in total GABAergic
synapses (VGAT, GAD-65 clusters; colocalization of VGAT-α2)
we next evaluated the effect of the Gabra2–1 mutation on specific
subsets of synapses. We observed fewer α2 positive clusters along
the AIS in Gabra2–1 cells compared to wildtype cells. We com-
pared the colocalization of α2 with CB1R and PV in tissue sec-
tions, to differentiate between axo-somatic contacts and AIS
contacts from chandelier cells. We found that the Gabra2–1
mutation caused a substantial loss of α2 at PV + sites, and no
significant difference in α2 at CB1R + sites, suggesting an impact
on AIS synapses. Gabra2–1 mice indeed displayed a significant

 reduction in the number of VGAT clusters opposed to the AIS,
suggesting that other subunits do not compensate for the loss of
α2. A recent study has questioned the selective segregation of α2,
suggesting that α1-subunits are also enriched on the AIS44. The
approach relied upon different polyclonal antibodies that have
distinct affinities, hence an absolute quantification of subunit
levels is not possible. Moreover, data interpretation is complicated
by estimates that in excess of 20% of GABAARs containing α2-
subunits also contain α145,46. Another recent study identified
some region-specific expression of α1 and α3 on the AIS, by
comparing AIS expression to non-AIS expression to overcome
antibody affinity differences47. While α1 and α3 are detected on
the AIS, α2 shows the greatest enrichment, and further gephyrin
is not preferentially enriched and may not contribute to AIS
recruitment of GABAAR-α-subunits47. Our new findings suggest
that α2 interaction with CB is the primary mediator of localiza-
tion of GABAARs to AIS synapses, and that other subunits and
gephyrin may be localized there in small amounts when com-
plexed with α2 and CB. The specific impact of Gabra2–1 muta-
tion on AIS inhibitory synapses may be related to interaction of
the α2–CB complex with other proteins that have been implicated
in the stabilization of AIS functional components such as
ankyrinG48, neurofascin49, NrCAM50, and βIV-spectrin51.
Stemming from these alterations to GABAergic synapses and
inhibitory synaptic function, Gabra2–1 mice display a remarkable
phenotype characterized by spontaneous seizures, resulting in
mortality in a subset of both heterozygous and homozygous mice.
This is particularly striking since a relatively small number of
GABAAR-subunit mutations result in spontaneous seizures38–
40,52–54. A role for AIS abnormalities in epilepsy has been sug-
gested in other studies55–57, implicating trafficking and localiza-
tion of voltage-gated channels to the AIS. Other analyses have
found alterations to AIS inhibitory synapses resulting from or
contributing to epilepsy; however, both decreases and increases in
AIS synapse number have been found, leaving the contribution of
this synaptic subtype unclear58–60. Our results directly link a
mutation in a specific GABAAR-subunit, accompanied by an
alteration in AIS GABAergic synapses, to an epileptic phenotype.
An additional feature of the Gabra2–1 model is that it reduces the
possibility of gene compensation relative to a subunit knock-out.
This is supported by the fact that spontaneous seizures and early
mortality are not reported in the α261 or CB21 knock-out models
where a compensatory feedback enhancing the expression of
other proteins may occur.
Surviving Gabra2–1 mice show anxiety-like behavior and
alterations in EEG, including an enhancement of δ-power.
Gabra2–1 anxiety may be related to prior seizures, as it is well
documented that anxiety is a common comorbidity in human
epilepsy and in animal models62. The alterations in δ-power also
corroborate the anxiety findings. δ-frequency oscillations have
been most closely tied to salience detection63,64, and anxiety as a
heightened salience state is correspondingly linked to elevations
in the δ-range65. Further, nonsedating doses of diazepam and
other benzodiazepines are known to decrease δ-power66,67. While
AZD7325 reduced anxiety-like behavior in both Gabra2–1 mice
and wildtype controls, we found that the classical benzodiazepine
diazepam was not effective at reducing anxiety-like behavior in
Gabra2–1 mice. Further, when we analyzed the impact of dia-
zepam on the EEG, we also found that Gabra2–1 mice do not
show the typical suppression of δ. Previous studies have suggested
that binding of benzodiazepines to α2-containing receptors is
required for the suppression of EEG δ-power68, while α1 and α3
binding has a limited role in δ-suppression69,70. Although it is not
immediately apparent why diazepam is ineffective in Gabra2–1
mice, this difference may be related to the predominance of α1-/
α3-mediated effects of diazepam when α2-containing receptors
are compromised. In contrast, since AZD7325 acts preferentially
on α2-containing receptors, it remains effective at suppressing δ
and reducing anxiety-like behavior.
The Gabra2–1 mutation demonstrates a striking parallel with
the effects of ARHGEF9 mutation in human syndromes, whose
symptoms include epilepsy, anxiety, mental retardation, aggres-
sive behavior, sleep–wake cycle disruptions, early mortality, and
hyperekplexia24–27. It is likely that the hyperekplexia is linked to
CB interaction with glycine receptors15, however, the remaining
symptoms may be linked to dysfunctions at the AIS due to
mislocalization of α2-containing GABAARs. Gabra2–1 mice do
not display hyperekplexia, but have increased seizure suscept-
ibility, early mortality, and anxiety, drawing several parallels. The
responsiveness of the anxiety and EEG phenotype to the α2/α3-
selective GABAA positive modulator AZD7325 suggests a possible
novel therapeutic strategy to relieve symptoms in this set of
human developmental syndromes linked to CB dysfunction.
Taken together, our results reveal a clear and selective inter-
action between the α2-subunit of GABAARs and CB, an inter-
action that has been long speculated about but has not previously
been characterized. Furthermore, using the novel Gabra2–1
mouse model, we demonstrate that this interaction is critical for
the targeting of α2-containing GABAARs, specifically to AIS sites
needed for the stabilization of VGAT positive contacts onto the
AIS. Gabra2–1 mice display spontaneous seizures during devel-
opment, accompanied by early mortality in a subset of pups.
Adult Gabra2–1 mice that survive have increased anxiety-like
behavior and EEG abnormalities that are responsive to α2-
selective benzodiazepines, revealing a novel therapeutic potential
for these compounds.
Methods
Protein expression and purification. GephE (AA 318–736) as well as the large
cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR β (AA 378–425), GABAAR α1 (AA334–420), α2 (AA
335–419) and α3 (AA 392–406) subunits and the corresponding truncation var-
iants GABAAR α2 (AA 307–334), and (AA 307–350) were expressed and purified.
The pGEX Vector SH3 construct provided by T. Soykan from the Brose Lab
corresponds to residues 4–72 of murine CB1 and encompasses the complete SH3
domain (residues 8–67) of this protein which is identical to the SH3 domain of the
human CB isoform, hPEM-2. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and
purified via its N terminal GST-tag. After in-situ thrombin cleavage the GST–SH3

 mixture was applied to a 26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham
Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-
mercaptoethanol. Two separate peaks could be resolved, one containing both the
cleaved and uncleaved GST and GST–SH3, respectively, and the other containing
pure SH3 domain.
Peptide synthesis. Peptides were purchased as lyophilized powder from Genscript
(USA) at a minimal purity of 90%.
GFP bead trap and western blotting. HEK293T cells were transfected by elec-
troporation with 2 µg DNA of each construct, and used for experiments 48 h later.
HEK cells were transfected with full-length CB and either phluorin-tagged full-
length α2 or phluorin-tagged full-length α2–1 constructs. Cultures were chilled on
ice and lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1% triton, 5 mM EDTA,
10 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na4P2O7 with protease inhibitors. Lysates
were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with GFP-trap overnight at 4 °C.
After four washes in lysis buffer, bound proteins were detected by western blotting.
A table of antibodies, their sources and concentrations used can be found in
Supplementary Table 3. For western blotting, HEK cells or brain tissue samples (n
= 6 mice per genotype in >2 independent experiments) were rapidly harvested and
homogenized in TEEN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl)
supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).
Following homogenization the protein concentration was assessed using a BCA
assay (Pierce) and heated to 65 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 10% β-
mercaptoethanol for 15 min. After SDS-PAGE, western blot signals were detected
using ECL. For quantification, specific protein levels were determined by
densitometry and were normalized to actin loading densitometry results. Results
were quantified using Image J and were analyzed using t test (bead trap) or analysis
of variance (ANOVA) (western blotting) to compare mean values, graph plotted as
mean ± standard error.
Mouse generation and maintenance. Animals were cared for according to the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals71 and protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Tufts
University School of Medicine or the IACUC of the University of Nevada Las
Vegas. Germ line transmission of the transgenes was detected using PCR with
primers spanning the intronic region which contained the remaining loxP site
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Nontransgenic littermates were used as controls in all
experiments (wildtype). Following genotyping, animals of each genotype were
randomly assigned to treatment and/or assessment groups. Animals were gener-
ated by Genoway and maintained at the vivarium for Tufts University’s Boston
campus, as well as at the University of Nevada Las Vegas vivarium. Mice were
group housed with a 12 h light–dark cycle with constant temperature. After
founders were received, mice were back-crossed onto C57 Bl6J for more than ten
generations (congenic) prior to behavioral and EEG assessments. For tissue IHC,
behavior, pharmacology, and EEG experiments, only male mice, aged 6–10 weeks,
were used. All other experiments included both males and females (western blot-
ting, culture immuno (cultures made a P0), electrophysiology (slices cut at P18-22),
and assessments of mortality).

Immunocytochemistry and IHC. A table of antibodies, their sources and con-
centrations used can be found in supplementary Table 3. For immunocytochem-
istry (ICC) and IHC, four preservation protocols were used (n = 4 coverslips per
genotype ICC; n = 6 mice per genotype per tissue preparation method IHC). (1)
For ICC, at day in vitro 14 (DIV 14) coverslips of cultured cortical cells were fixed
in −20 °C methanol for 10 min. (2) For nonfluorescent IHC of GABAA receptor
α2-subunits, animals were transcardially perfused with a periodate lysine paraf-
ormaldehyde fixative solution. (3) For fluorescent IHC of GABAAR-α1- and -2-
subunits, animals were transcardially perfused with oxygenated artificial cere-
brospinal fluid followed by post fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB. (4) For
fluorescent IHC of CB, VGAT, colocalization of α2 subunit with parvalbumin and
cannabinoid receptor 1, and VGAT/sodium channel experiments, brains were
harvested freshly and flash frozen in optimal cutting temperature embedding
medium in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane. Following one of the above pre-
paration methods, sections were cut on a cryostat at thicknesses of 10 μm (fresh
frozen—mounted directly on slides, fixed in −20 °C methanol) or 30 μm (paraf-
ormaldehyde fixed—free floating) and were incubated in blocking solution (2.5%
Bovine Serum Albumin, 5% Normal Goat Serum, 0.1% triton-x, and 0.02% sodium
azide in PBS) for 45 min, followed by primary antibody incubations diluted in
modified blocking solution (2% Normal Goat Serum) overnight at 4 °C, and bio-
tinylated (Vector) or Alexa conjugated (ThermoFisher) secondary antibody
incubations diluted (1:2000) in modified blocking solution for 1 h at room tem-
perature. Immunostaining intensity, density and colocalization was quantified
using ImageJ, and results were analyzed using ANOVA to compare mean values,
graphs were plotted as mean ± standard error.
Electrophysiology. Brain slices were prepared from 3-week-old male Gabra2–1
mice (n = 6–13 cells/genotype, slices prepared from 5–6 mice and assessed inde-
pendently, one mouse sliced per day) in ice-cold cutting solution (mM: 126 NaCl,
2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 1.5 sodium
pyruvate, and 3 kynurenic acid), and measurements of sIPSCs in CA1 principal
neurons were performed. Slices were then transferred into incubation chamber
filled with prewarmed (31–32 °C) oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid of the
following composition (mM: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3,
1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 1.5 sodium pyruvate, 1 glutamine, 3 kynurenic acid, and
0.005 GABA bubbled with 95% O2–5% CO2).
Whole-cell currents were recorded from the hippocampal CA1 region using
patch pipettes (5–7 MΩ) pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision
Instruments) and filled with intracellular solution (mM: 140 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1
EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 4 NaCl and 0.3 Na-GTP; pH = 7.2 with CsOH). A 5
min period for stabilization after obtaining the whole-cell recording conformation
(holding potential of −60 mV) was allowed before currents were recorded using an
Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, digitized
at 20 kHz (Digidata 1440A; Molecular Devices), and stored for off-line analysis.
Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were analyzed using
Synaptosoft minianalysis software, and were analyzed using t test to compare mean
values, graphs were plotted as mean ± standard error.
Electroencephalography. EEG and electromyography electrodes were implanted
under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia (n = 6 mice per genotype per experimental
agent—kainate and AZD7325). After a minimum of 5 d of postoperative recovery,
EEG activity was measured using the Pinnacle system for mouse, during the dark
phase of the cycle. For kainate experiments, mice were acclimatized to the
recording chamber and preamplifier for one hour, then recorded for one hour of
baseline before receiving 20 mg kg−1 kainate i.p. The animals were then recorded
for an additional 2 h postinjection. For baseline and AZD7325 experiments, mice
were acclimatized to the recording chamber and preamplifier for 1 h, then recorded
for 1 h of baseline before receiving 3 mg kg−1 AZD7325 (or 40% (2-hydro-
xypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin vehicle control) i.p. For these experiments, vigilance was
further promoted by providing animals with a fresh nestlet just prior to initiation
of recordings. Thus, during the recording period mice were engaged with nest
building, grooming, eating and drinking behaviors, and if mice became inactive a
series of random tones was played. Results were quantified using SleepSign, and
MatLab, and were analyzed using ANOVA (two way—Kainate and AZD7325
average experiments; repeated measures—FFT spectral analysis) to compare mean
values, graphs were plotted as mean ± standard error.
Behavioral assessments. Genotype-blinded behavioral assessments were con-
ducted on Gabra2–1 and wildtype mice during the light phase. For behavioral
scoring of seizures, mice were assessed based on a Racine scale modified for mice,
with 0 = normal behavior/no change; 1 = behavioral arrest, shivering; 2 = head
nodding, Straub tail; 3 = forelimb clonus, champing; 4 = forelimb clonus with
rearing; 5 = generalized tonic clonic, wild jumping; animals were assigned a 6 upon
death. The preliminary screen was based on the modified SHIRPA protocol used by
European Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardized Screens (EMPReSS)
designed to evaluate the basic phenotype of transgenic mouse strains (n = 8 mice
per genotype run in >2 independent cohorts). The open field apparatus was based
on that used in the EMPReSS resource. Open field behavior of mice was assessed
using the Noldus Ethovision Tracking system from video recordings taken from
above. To assess the sedative effects of diazepam, naïve mice were first habituated
to the open field for 30 min, and then removed and dosed with 10 mg kg−1 dia-
zepam i.p. before being returned to the open field for an additional 60 min.
Protocols for both the light/dark exploration test and the elevated plus maze (n
= 8 mice per genotype per treatment run in >2 independent cohorts) were based
on standard protocols. The light/dark arena is composed of a larger chamber that is
transparent and brightly illuminated from above, and a smaller chamber that is
black walled and dark. The two chambers are separated by a partition with a small
doorway to allow the animal to freely pass from chamber to chamber while
exploring for 10 min. The elevated plus maze was composed of two open and two
closed arms extending from a central platform, elevated to a height of 40 cm above
the floor. Test sessions were initiated by placing individual animals in the center
square facing an open arm, and were terminated after 5 min of free exploration. For
light-dark and elevated plus, video recordings (30 fps) of test sessions were digitized
and both manually assessed by a genotype-blinded observer and analyzed using
Noldus Ethovision, to quantify number of transitions between the light and dark
compartments, and the total time spent in the light and dark compartments
(light–dark), or the number of entries (all four paws into an arm) and time spent in
open and closed arms (elevated plus). To test the anxiolytic effects of diazepam (2
mg kg−1, 15 min prior to testing) or AZD7325 (3 mg kg−1 in 40% (2-
hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin, 45 min prior to testing) animals were given an ip

 injection prior to initiation of the elevated plus maze, and compared to 40% (2-
hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin vehicle controls. Results from all behavioral
assessments (n = 8 mice per genotype, per treatment, run in 2–3 independent
cohorts) were analyzed using ANOVA to compare mean values.
Data collection and analyses. Power analyses run on pools of data from inde-
pendent drug treatment or genetic modification experiments reveal a range of
sample sizes between 5 and 12 animals (with n = 5 animals per group yielding a
power of 80% on simple tests, and n = 10 yielding a power close to 100%). For the
purposes of the behavioral assessments within this set of studies, we estimated that
eight animals would be required per genetic manipulation, and per drug group, per
behavioral experiment.
Biochemistry, EEG and confocal imaging experiments are subject to somewhat
less variability, and thus we estimated that fewer animals (n = 6) would be needed
to obtain statistical power for these experiments. For electrophysiology, power
analysis of prior data sets provided an estimate of five to six animals needed per
group to achieve a power close to 100%. All findings were reproduced in >2
independent experiments (biochemistry, confocal microscopy, electrophysiology)
or matched cohorts (EEG and behavior). Data from independent experiments or
cohorts were compared to ensure that findings were reproduced, and then the data
was combined for statistical analysis. Data were normally distributed, and data
being compared had similar variance. No data were excluded from this manuscript.
Investigators were blinded to genotype and/or treatment group for all confocal,
electrophysiology, behavioral and EEG experiments, and subsequent analyses.
Data availability. The data that support the findings of this study have been
deposited in an institutional repository, and are available from the primary author
upon reasonable request.
