Abstract
The human prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, have captivated our 
imaginations since their discovery in the Fore linguistic group in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s. 
The mysterious and poorly understood “infectious protein” has become somewhat of a household 
name in many regions across the globe. From bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), 
commonly identified as mad cow disease, to endocannibalism, media outlets have capitalized on 
these devastatingly fatal neurological conditions. Interestingly, since their discovery, there have 
been more than 492 incidents of iatrogenic transmission of prion diseases, largely resulting from 
prion-contaminated growth hormone and dura mater grafts. Although fewer than 9 cases of 
probable iatrogenic neurosurgical cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been reported 
worldwide, the likelihood of some missed cases and the potential for prion transmission by 
neurosurgery create considerable concern. Laboratory studies indicate that standard 
decontamination and sterilization procedures may be insufficient to completely remove infectivity 
from prion-contaminated instruments. In this unfortunate event, the instruments may transmit the

 prion disease to others. Much caution therefore should be taken in the absence of strong evidence 
against the presence of a prion disease in a neurosurgical patient. While the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) have devised risk 
assessment and decontamination protocols for the prevention of iatrogenic transmission of the 
prion diseases, incidents of possible exposure to prions have unfortunately occurred in the United 
States. In this article, the authors outline the historical discoveries that led from kuru to the 
identification and isolation of the pathological prion proteins in addition to providing a brief 
description of human prion diseases and iatrogenic forms of CJD, a brief history of prion disease 
nosocomial transmission, and a summary of the CDC and WHO guidelines for prevention of prion 
disease transmission and decontamination of prion-contaminated neurosurgical instruments.

The human prion diseases are a rare group of uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disorders 
characterized by a rapid decline in cognition and movement with features of cerebral and 
cerebellar dysfunction.37,55,79 Although they differ in their specific clinical and pathological 
manifestations (Table 1), the prion diseases have in common the accumulation of small, 
highly resilient proteins traditionally known as prions, which are capable of self-propagation 
via autocatalytic templating activity.2,35 Prions have been demonstrated to be resistant to 
conventional methods of decontamination.88 The presence of prion-contaminated 
instruments in the operating room can pose a serious risk to health care providers and 
patients.3,11 In the absence of strong evidence against a prion disease diagnosis in a 
neurosurgical patient, cautionary measures should be taken to prevent iatrogenic 
transmission of prions via the surgical instruments, as neural tissue presents the highest 
infectious burden of the disease.8
Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests using cerebrospinal fluid and/or nasal 
brushings are becoming available at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance 
Center (Cleveland, Ohio).70,71 Nevertheless, a definitive antemortem diagnosis of prion 
disease can only be made by tissue biopsy. The current difficulties in identifying prion-
infected living patients constitute one of several challenges faced by institutions when 
determining whether specific prion decontamination measures should be taken during a 
neurosurgical procedure. In addition, the inability to identify patients who have been 
recently infected with the prion agent complicates responses to inadvertent exposures of 
surgical patients to potentially prion-contaminated instruments. This issue may arise when a 
patient who previously underwent a neurosurgical procedure receives a postoperative 
diagnosis of prion disease. Assessing the risk to those potentially exposed to contaminated 
instruments and making decisions related to informing such patients and preventing further 
exposures to the instruments can be difficult, time consuming, and costly. Fortunately, only a 
very small fraction of the total number of prion disease cases reported to date resulted from 
iatrogenic transmission following neurological surgery with contaminated instruments, 
although complete case ascertainment is very difficult.12,17 Preventing iatrogenic

 transmission of prions remains important primarily because prion diseases are invariably 
fatal. The social costs of iatrogenic transmission must also be considered; such costs include 
loss of public trust in medical personnel and institutions, investigative costs, and potential 
lawsuits.
This review seeks to provide an update on the existing information on the transmission of 
human prion diseases. A general background of the historical, epidemiological, 
pathobiological, and clinical aspects of the prion diseases is first provided, followed by 
descriptions of previous incidents and corresponding recommendations by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). This review 
is intended to disseminate information on how iatrogenic transmission of prion disease can 
be avoided in the hospital setting.
Human Prion Diseases: Historical Perspective
Human prion disease first came to the attention of the global scientific community during 
the 1950s when D. Carleton Gajdusek, a US physician and medical researcher, was called to 
investigate a “strange, encephalitis-like disease” occurring predominately among women and 
children of the Fore linguistic region of Papua New Guinea.33,59 Oral history provided by 
the inhabitants of the region indicated that the first appearance of the disease may have 
occurred around 1910.62 At the time of Gajdusek’s initial report, a full epidemic had been 
recognized, with more than 1000 cases identified in the first 10 months of the opening of a 
native hospital for the treatment and study of the disease.34 Kuru, as the disease was known 
among the Fore, is a word used to designate the trembling associated with fear or cold. 
Gajdusek and his colleague V. Zigas, a medical officer in the Fore tribe region of New 
Guinea, lived among the Fore and investigated this major medical problem.
In describing kuru to the (then) director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Gajdusek 
wrote:
Emotional instability is certain; a tendency to excessive hilarity, etc. is certain. The 
“mask-like” facies is rather a fixed facies—but not “mask-like”.… The entire 
postural tremor situation is most complex. It is not a true cerebellar, nor a true 
parkinsonism tremor. It is, rather, a tremor and other types of involuntary 
movements which are very irregular and difficult to describe.… Toes are constantly 
gripping and searching when a patient tries to stand unaided—or, if more advanced, 
even when supported. Sudden loss of antigravity postural support, given passively 
by an examiner to head or upper extremities, suddenly sets off repetitive, irregular 
tremors or a choreiform pattern of movement. Rigidity is minimal, if at all present. 
It appears late. Instead, there is an increased tone to the muscles that are associated 
with attempts at maintaining posture and preventing the antigravity tremors which 
fight the slightest instability of standing, sitting, lying, head posture, etc. and which 
initiate as a startle response. If well and firmly supported passively, even in late 
cases, this “intermittent rigidity” subsides to complete relaxation.56
Gajdusek later noted the similarity of kuru to “heterofamilial degenerative disorders of the 
central nervous system,”34 whereas Igor Klatzo, neuropathologist at NIH, compared kuru to 
Bonda et al.

 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the latter being documented only 20 times and never 
observed in children.59 In 1957, Klatzo wrote: “[kuru] seems to be definitely a new 
condition without anything similar described in the literature. The closest condition that I 
can think of is that described by Jacob and Creutzfeldt.”6 Klatzo detected the vacuoles and 
the amyloidal kuru plaques in the brain of individuals with kuru, and, in 1959, he published 
a paper describing kuru’s histopathological features and the similarities between kuru and 
CJD.51 In 1966, Gajdusek, Gibbs, and Alpers experimentally transmitted kuru to 
chimpanzees, confirming that kuru was an infectious condition.32,43
Two years later, CJD was shown to be transmissible. Gibbs and Gajdusek proposed the name 
of “subacute spongiform encephalopathy” for the entire class of scrapie-like diseases.42,43 
The pathogenesis of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, however, remained a 
mystery, the solution to which would have an enormous impact on medicine.
Kuru and Cannabalism
Epidemiological and clinical research conducted by Zigas and Gajdusek revealed a 
complicated picture. According to their 1959 report,34 kuru had the following properties. 1) 
It was responsible for the death of approximately 1% of the population per year (up to 50% 
in certain areas). 2) It mainly affected adult females, with up to 25% of cases involving 
children. 3) It was restricted to the Fore people and some of their tribal neighbors. 4) Its 
histopathological hallmarks included neurological degeneration, myelin degeneration, 
astroglial and microglial proliferation, most predominately in the cerebellum and 
extrapyramidal system. 5) Cases of kuru had no identifiable relationship with cases of 
(presumably viral) infectious meningoencephalitis or with any toxic ingestion.
Gajdusek himself postulated a genetic predisposition to the spread of kuru; however, little 
evidence could be found to support such a hypothesis. Currently, however, we understand 
that heterozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP) is protective (see 
below).
Remarkably, the kuru-affected people of Papua New Guinea were unique in their practice of 
“endocannabalism.” As Alpers describes, the people of the Fore region believed the 
“mortuary practice of consumption of the dead and incorporation of the body of the dead 
person into the bodies of living relatives, thus [helped] to free the spirit of the dead.”4 In 
fact, the whole body of the deceased kin was eaten by female relatives and children of both 
sexes. Adult males, which included boys above age 7, rarely took part in this practice.61,87 
The sex and age distribution of the kuru epidemic could thus be satisfactorily explained by 
the mortuary practices of the affected people. In fact, after the abandonment of the practice 
by the early 1960s (following the urging of the Australian administration), there was a sharp 
decline in cases that was characterized by the long incubation period of the disease.4
The ensuing decades of clinical and basic research revealed the etiologic agent of kuru to be 
a small, self-aggregating protein unlike any infectious entity previously identified in biology. 
The agent, now known as “prion,” introduced to the scientific community principles of 
molecular catalytic activity that would influence the fields of molecular biology, genetics,

 virology, amyloidology, and aging. Such was the impact of the elucidation of the 
pathophysiology of kuru that D. Carleton Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine in 1976 for his work on the transmission of the disease. Stanley 
Prusiner, whose work is described below, also received the Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work 
on the molecular identification and characterization of the prion protein. The detailed 
findings of the investigation into kuru and the discovery and development of the concept of 
transmissible prion proteins were summarized by Dr. Gajdusck and Dr. Prusiner, 
respectively, in Fields’ Fundamentals of Virology, published in 1996.31,78
Human Prion Diseases in the 21st Century
The term “prion” was coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner to describe “proteinaceous 
infectious” particles responsible for scrapie in goats and sheep.77 Since their initial 
elucidation, much work has been done to understand and categorize these fatal 
neurodegenerative conditions. Prion diseases have different etiologies: they can arise 
sporadically, be genetically inherited, or acquired by infection.
The normal or cellular PrP (PrPC) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane 
glycoprotein that is largely expressed in neural and nonneural tissues and found primarily on 
the cell surface–plasma membrane of the central nervous system. PrPC is encoded by the 
PRNP gene on chromosome 20 and comprises 209 amino acids that fold to produce an α-
helix–rich conformation that is soluble in buffers containing detergent and readily digested 
by proteases (e.g., by the proteinase K).48,77,80 The function of PrPC is largely 
unknown.61,86
The abnormal or pathological form of PrP (PrPSc) displays a predominantly β-sheet 
conformation with a C-terminal region that is partially resistant to proteolytic 
degradation.7,22,35 The conformational conversion of PrPC to PrPSc seems to occur in a 
reaction whereby α-helical structures of PrPC refold into a β-sheets structure using a 
preexisting PrPSc as a template.1,27,40,49 Although the accumulation of the proteinase K–
resistant PrPSc, a gold standard marker for prion disease, may not always be observed with 
standard detection procedures in a few human prion diseases, a central pathogenic event is 
the accumulation of PrPSc that is partially resistant to proteases.84
Polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene, encoding for either methionine (M) or valine 
(V), has been demonstrated to play a role in host susceptibility to phenotypic expression of 
sporadic, familial, and acquired or iatrogenic forms of prion disease.23,25,74 Codon 129 M/V 
heterozygosity seems to be protective against human prion diseases,93 and several studies 
have indicated a prominence of homozygosity for either methionine (129 M/M) or valine 
(129 V/V) in individuals with prion disease.23,52,63 Although the biophysical interplay 
between codon 129 and PrPSc conversion is incompletely understood, the epidemiological 
association is of considerable clinical predictive value.
There is a great deal of phenotypic heterogeneity in the prion diseases. The 
clinicopathological phenotype in CJD and other prion diseases is also influenced by the 
different types of the pathological PrPSc, identified as Type 1 and Type 2.66,72,75

 Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
The most common human prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), with an 
estimated incidence of 1–1.5 cases per million people per year.8 Approximately 85% of all 
CJD cases are sporadic (sCJD) and considered to arise from somatic alteration in PrPC.30,35 
A modern classification of sCJD into 5 distinct subtypes combines 2 types of PrPSc (Type 1 
and Type 2) and 3 possible genotypes at codon 129 (129 M/M, 129 M/V, and 129 V/V). 
Each subtype of sCJD is characterized by a distinct clinical and histopathological 
phenotype.19,74 Genetic or familial CJD (fCJD) represents 5%–15% of all CJD cases39 and 
is associated with several pathogenic mutations in the PRNP gene. Patients with fCJD are 
usually younger than those with sCJD. Clinically, fCJD presents with rapidly progressive 
neurological and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, including dementia, visual abnormalities, 
muscle incoordination and myoclonus, and gait and speech abnormalities (Table 1). The 
rates of progression and symptoms at onset vary depending on the sCJD subtype. In about 
85%–90% of cases, however, patients deteriorate rapidly, with death occurring within 12 
months of the onset of illness.8 Variant CJD (vCJD) was initially reported in 1996 as a small 
case series of CJD-like illnesses in the United Kingdom that was epidemiologically linked to 
an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Affected patients exhibited early-
onset disease (median age 28 years) with prominent behavioral changes at clinical 
presentation followed by neurological abnormalities, dementia, and myoclonus later in the 
course of the illness.91 Epidemiological and laboratory studies indicated that the same prion 
agent was responsible for BSE and vCJD.46,64 Iatrogenic transmission of vCJD has been 
linked to blood products (3 clinical cases and 2 subclinical cases)5,82 rendering iatrogenic 
transmission of prion diseases a greater potential problem.
Fatal Insomnia
Sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI) and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) are characterized by bilateral 
symmetric degeneration of the thalamus with marked gliosis and absence of minimal 
spongiform degeneration.38 Patients predominantly exhibit severe sleep disturbances, often 
with intractable insomnia, and autonomic dysfunction, characterized by hyperhidrosis, 
hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension.39 It is most commonly associated with PRNP 
gene mutation at codon 178 (FFI), but sporadic cases have been identified lacking such 
mutation (sFI).39,73
Kuru
The clinical picture of kuru, as described above, is considerably distinct from that of classic 
CJD. Cases occurring 50 years after participation in ritual cannibalism have been reported,24 
suggesting that measuring the full risk of person-to-person transmissions of prion disease 
can be challenging due to possibly decades-long incubation periods.
Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker Syndrome
Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) is a slowly progressive hereditary 
cerebellar syndrome associated with PRNP point mutations at different codons.60 The 
incidence of GSS is estimated at approximately 1–10 cases per 100 million people per 
year.59 Typically reported neurological symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, gait

 abnormalities, dementia, dysarthria, ocular dysmetria, and hyporeflexia or areflexia in the 
lower extremities. As with sCJD, however, the different mutations confer different clinical 
and histopathological phenotypes.
Variably Protease-Sensitive Prionopathy
Variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) is a recently identified prion disease 
affecting an estimated 2–3 people per 100 million per year.36,94 Clinical onset is 
characterized by psychosis, mood changes, speech impairment, and dementia, whereas 
progressive motor dysfunction is usually observed at later stages of the disease. About 30% 
of the affected individuals have a family history of dementia. The median age of disease 
onset, and the disease duration, is 70 years and 2 years, respectively. In VPSPr, disease 
prevalence in association with the 3 codon 129 genotypes of the PRNP gene (i.e., M/M, 
M/V, and V/V) is different from that of sCJD, suggesting a different role of codon 129 as a 
risk factor in the 2 conditions (VPSPr: 62% V/V, 26% M/V, and 12% M/M; sCJD: 19% V/V, 
11% M/V, and 70% M/M).79 Other features of VPSPr are different sensitivity of PrPSc to 
proteolytic digestion with proteinase K (hence “variably protease-sensitive”), and poor 
transmission of the disease to transgenic mice expressing the human PrPC.69
Iatrogenic CJD: Historical Context
Iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) refers to the transmission of prions via inadvertent medical exposure. 
The first documented case of iCJD occurred via infected corneal transplant, and was 
described by Duffy in 1974.28 Three earlier iatrogenic prion transmissions by surgical 
instruments were suggested by examination of case notes of CJD cases described in a report 
by Nevins et al. in 1960.67,90 A fourth case of iatrogenic CJD attributed to a contaminated 
neurosurgical instrument was described by el Hachimi and colleagues in 1977; the case 
involved a 46-year-old man who had undergone cranial surgery in the same department 3 
days after a cortical biopsy had confirmed CJD in a 59-year-old woman.29 In 1977, 
Christoph Bernoulli realized that a cortical electrode probe used in an elderly patient had 
transmitted CJD to 2 younger patients undergoing subsequent epilepsy surgery.10 
Subsequent reports demonstrated the transmission of CJD to the frontal lobes of 
chimpanzees with the same electrodes, even after scrupulous attempts to clean them.42
More than 492 (personal communication to L.B.S., 2015) cases of iCJD have been identified 
worldwide (Table 2).15 The majority of such cases resulted from the administration of prion-
contaminated human growth hormone (hGH) and cadaveric dura mater graft. Other sources 
of iatrogenic transmission of the disease are contaminated blood, corneas, and neurosurgical 
instrumentation. Because of the latter risk, Drs. Paul Brown and Michael Farrell recently 
proposed routine use of prion diagnostic testing on all patients admitted with symptoms of 
either dementia or cerebellar disease and containment of infectivity commensurate with the 
degree of potential risk.16
Cadaveric Dura Mater Transplantation
The transmission of CJD by transplantation of commercially distributed cadaveric dura 
mater (dCJD) was first recognized in 1987.21 Since then, at least 238 dCJD cases (personal

 communication to L.B.S., 2015) have been identified worldwide, with over 60% occurring 
in Japan, reflecting primarily the frequent use of Lyodura. Lyodura was produced by the 
German manufacturer B. Braun Melsungen AG and was the major source of the outbreak. In 
1987, the manufacturer reported that it changed its procedures to reduce the risk of prion 
contamination of its product. The mean incubation period for exposed dCJD patients has 
been estimated to be 12 years (range 1.2–30 years), although cases with even longer 
incubation periods are likely to occur. The predominant symptomatology has been atypical 
(slowly progressive and without characteristic electroencephalography [EEG] findings).15,53 
In Japan, 2 groups of dCJD with distinct phenotypes and molecular features have been 
recently described.53
Human Growth Hormone Administration
The treatment of short stature with pituitary-derived human growth hormone (hGH) began in 
the 1950s and has been associated with more than 238 iCJD cases to date15,20 (personal 
communication to L.B.S., 2015). The majority of hGH-CJD cases have occurred in France, 
specifically among patients who received hGH treatment between December 1983 and July 
1985 (119 cases in 1170 exposed patients). In the UK and the US, the numbers of cases are 
fewer (75 and 31, respectively). Except for 1 case of CJD associated with commercially 
derived hGH, 30 of the 31 patients in the US cases received hGH treatment through the 
government-supported National Hormone and Pituitary Program. In this program, no CJD 
cases have been identified among recipients who began their hormone treatment after 1977, 
the year when a highly selective column chromatography step was included in the 
purification protocol.15 The mean incubation time for hGH-CJD patients worldwide has 
been estimated to be 17 years (range 5–42 years), and the associated clinical picture is 
predominantly cerebellar, with dementia occurring late in the development should it appear.
Blood Transfusion
The first convincing evidence for blood transfusion transmission of a human prion disease 
was reported for vCJD in 2003. As indicated in Table 2, 5 cases of vCJD infection, including 
3 involving patients who became ill with vCJD, have been documented among recipients of 
blood products from donors who subsequently developed vCJD. (Table 2).26,50,76
Other Sources
Although the vast majority of iCJD cases have occurred because of contaminated hGH or 
dura mater graft, other identified sources include corneal transplantation65 and contaminated 
stereotactic EEG depth electrodes.14,44,46 In four cases, patients underwent corneal 
transplantation or EEG with grafts from or instruments previously used on patients in 
patients subsequently discovered to have died of confirmed CJD.. The latency period for 
corneal transplant cases ranged from 18 months to 30 years, whereas the latency periods for 
the cases ascribed to the contaminated EEG depth electrodes were 16 months and 20 
months.13,45

 Transmission of Human Prions by Neurosurgical Instruments
Iatrogenic transmission of CJD via neurosurgical instrumentation is a worrisome, although 
rare, phenomenon. Four cases have been documented in the literature, with three having 
occurred in the UK and one in France during the 1950s.29,90 Exposed patients presented 
back to the hospital with onset of CJD between 1.4 and 2.2 years after their surgery. 
Although there have been no documented cases in the US, the unusual pathology of one CJD 
case in a US neurosurgeon has been reported to suggest iatrogenic rather than sporadic 
disease.54 In addition, several potential exposures have been described.9,85
In the 15-year period (1998–2012), 19 incidents of suspected CJD exposure via 
contaminated surgical instruments in the US were reported to the CDC. Two cases involved 
ophthalmological procedures, whereas 17 involved intracranial neurological operations that 
were performed as a diagnostic workup in most of the cases. Operative personnel were not 
aware that their patient was infected with the CJD agent, so no recommended CJD-related 
protocols for instrument tracking/decontamination were followed. The contaminated 
instruments were cycled through the normal decontamination process and reused on 
subsequent patients. Several hospitals reported having multiple neurosurgical instrument 
sets, and in most of these hospitals (11 of 19) the originally contaminated set could not be 
identified.
The potential nosocomial exposure to the CJD agent raises several concerns. Most important 
is the prevention of further exposure of patients to CJD. This requires identification of 
potentially contaminated instruments and their proper quarantine and sterilization. As 
demonstrated by these cases, instrument tracking can be very difficult when there are 
multiple instrument sets and when a large amount of time has passed since the initial 
neurosurgery. In some of the above-mentioned hospitals, the entire collection of sets had to 
be quarantined and decontaminated.9 Instruments used for neurosurgery in patients with 
dementia or cerebellar signs for whom there is not convincing evidence against a prion 
disease should be decontaminated using the sterilization protocols developed by WHO.
A second important consideration is patient notification. The hospital should try to identify 
the patients potentially exposed to the index instruments (another epidemiological obstacle) 
and decide if anyone, appropriately, should be notified. In this regard, several factors should 
be taken into account.9
Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Given the difficulty of tracking instruments and connecting them to patients, it is crucial to 
identify patients who have, or are at risk for having, a prion disease before they undergo 
surgical procedures. Successful implementation of the appropriate precautions can 
effectively eliminate the risk of subsequent iatrogenic events. Suggestions for mitigation are 
provided in the WHO Infection Control Guidelines for the Transmissible Spongiform 
Encephalopathies.88
According to these guidelines, prior to the operation, efforts should be made to minimize the 
extent of contamination. The WHO specifically suggests that all staff directly involved in the

 procedure or the reprocessing or disposal of the contaminated items be made aware of 
recommended precautions; operative and relevant staff must be given enough time to obtain 
suitable instrumentation and equipment; specific protocols are followed; and staff is 
appropriately trained for these protocols. It is also suggested that the procedure in question 
be scheduled for the end of the day (i.e., as the last case) to ensure adequate time for 
decontamination. These procedures may have a visible effect on the surgical instrument to 
which the procedure is applied.18
The WHO also lists basic protective measures to be taken within the operating room:88 1) 
involve a minimum number of health care personnel in the operating room; 2) use single-use 
equipment whenever possible; 3) cover all nondisposable equipment (Fig. 1); 4) maintain a 
“one-way flow” of instruments; 5) dispose of single-use items via incineration when 
possible; and 6) clean all work surface areas according to guidelines.
Prion Protein Resilience and Decontamination
The most commonly used methods for disinfection and sterilization may not be adequate to 
remove all prion in fectivity. Chemical disinfectants (e.g., alcohol, ammonia, formalin, 
hydrochloric acid, and phenolics) and common thermal or ionizing treatments (boiling, dry 
heating, and ultraviolet light or microwave exposure) do not effectively denature the prion 
particles. Prion stability is, in fact, enhanced by drying or by fixation in alcohol, formalin, 
and glutaraldehyde.57 Therefore, traditional means of instrument decontamination may not 
suffice for prion-infected utensils. The recommended prion decontamination protocols for 
reusable surgical instruments and surfaces recommended by WHO and CDC have been 
published and are readily available on CDC’s website (http://www.cdc.gov/prions/cjd/
infection-control.html).11
Conclusions
Iatrogenic forms of CJD represent a unique challenge to neurosurgeons. Although their 
incidence is rare, and the likelihood of encountering them in surgical practice is low, a 
missed diagnosis of prion disease in a neurosurgical patient can severely and negatively 
impact patients and associated hospitals. It is therefore important to remain vigilant during 
preoperative workup, especially when the preprocedural differential diagnosis could include 
the suspicion of a prion disease. Although intensive, the recommended precautions can 
reduce the potential risk of nosocomial prion infections and minimize the negative 
consequences.

†In order of decreasing frequency.
‡Based on the 228 cases reported by Brown et al.15
§Excludes 2 CJD decedents who were homozygous for methionine encoding at codon 129 of their PRNP gene, a neurosurgeon and a patient who 
had undergone a neurosurgical procedure 14 years before onset, whose atypical neuropathology indicated iatrogenic disease.
¶Based on the 226 cases reported by Brown et al.15
**Excludes 2 vCJD-infected decedents who died from causes other than prion disease and had received either non-leukoreduced blood cells or 
Factor VIII from donors who subsequently developed vCJD.
