Variants in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) were recently found to increase the risk for
developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the brain, TREM2 is predom-
inately expressed on microglia, and its association with AD adds to
increasing evidence implicating a role for the innate immune system
in AD initiation and progression. Thus far, studies have found
TREM2 is protective in the response to amyloid pathology while var-
iants leading to a loss of TREM2 function impair microglial signaling
and are deleterious. However, the potential role of TREM2 in the
context of tau pathology has not yet been characterized. In this study,
we crossed Trem2+/+ (T2+/+) and Trem2−/− (T2−/−) mice to the PS19
human tau transgenic line (PS) to investigate whether loss of TREM2
function affected tau pathology, the microglial response to tau pathol-
ogy, or neurodegeneration. Strikingly, by 9 mo of age, T2−/−PS mice
exhibited significantly less brain atrophy as quantified by ventricular
enlargement and preserved cortical volume in the entorhinal and piri-
form regions compared with T2+/+PS mice. However, no TREM2-
dependent differences were observed for phosphorylated tau staining
or insoluble tau levels. Rather, T2−/−PS mice exhibited significantly
reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus and piriform cortex com-
pared with T2+/+PS mice. Gene expression analyses and immunostain-
ing revealed microglial activation was significantly attenuated in T2−/−
PS mice, and there were lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and
astrogliosis. These unexpected findings suggest that impairing micro-
glial TREM2 signaling reduces neuroinflammation and is protective
against neurodegeneration in the setting of pure tauopathy.
TREM2 | Alzheimer’s disease | neurodegeneration | neuroinflammation | tau
A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of de-
mentia and is thought to be caused by accumulation of two
different proteins in the brain. Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates form
extracellular plaques, while hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) is
present in intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (1). Microgliosis, or
activation of the innate immune cells in the brain, is an additional
pathological signature routinely found in regions affected by
abundant plaques and tangles (2, 3). Chronic microgliosis has long
been hypothesized to influence accumulation of Aβ and tau, con-
tribute to neuronal damage, and ultimately exacerbate neuro-
degeneration (4, 5). However, studies over the past two decades
have reported both beneficial and detrimental effects of microglia
in AD (4, 5). Thus, the role of microglia and inflammation in
disease onset and progression remains poorly understood.
The discovery that rare coding variants in the triggering re-
ceptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with
a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing sporadic, late-
onset AD further implicates the role of microglia in AD (6, 7).
TREM2 is specifically expressed in microglia in the brain and has
been shown to impact a multitude of functions including activa-
tion, inflammation, phagocytosis, proliferation, and survival (8).
Although the exact molecular effects of AD-associated risk variants
in TREM2 are still being investigated, the most common position
47 arginine-to-histidine (R47H) variant appears to reduce binding
to anionic phospholipids, including binding to apolipoproteins such
as ApoE, and reduce lipid-induced TREM2 activity (9–14). The
exact physiological ligand(s) of TREM2 are currently unknown, but
it is this thought that decreased ligand binding results in a loss of
microglial functions, which consequently increases risk for the de-
velopment of AD (8).
AD pathology is characterized first by the appearance of Aβ
plaques followed by the spread of neurofibrillary tau tangles from
the transentorhinal region, to the hippocampus, and into the neo-
cortex (15). Several studies have investigated the effects of TREM2
on plaque deposition and associated pathologies (14, 16–20). One
consistent observation has been that reduction or loss of TREM2
function reduces the number of plaque-associated microglia.
However, the effects of TREM2 deficiency on overall plaque
load have been variable (8). Interestingly, two recent reports
found that, despite no difference in the number of plaques, al-
terations in plaque composition and morphology corresponded
Significance
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia
and is a major public health problem for which there is currently
no disease-modifying treatment. There is an urgent need for
greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
neurodegeneration in patients to create better therapeutic op-
tions. Recently, genetic studies uncovered novel AD risk variants in
the microglial receptor, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells 2 (TREM2). Previous studies suggested that loss of TREM2
function worsens amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque-related toxicity. In con-
trast, we observe TREM2 deficiency mitigates neuroinflammation
and protects against brain atrophy in the context of tau pathology.
These findings indicate dual roles for TREM2 and microglia in the
context of amyloid versus tau pathology, which are important to
consider for potential treatments targeting TREM2.

 to increased neuritic dystrophy and p-tau accumulation around
plaques in Trem2-deficient mouse models and in human R47H
variant carriers (19, 20). Therefore, TREM2 is currently thought to
be protective in the response to amyloid pathology, while variants
leading to a loss of TREM2 function impair microglia signaling
and are deleterious. However, the potential role of TREM2 in the
context of tau pathology has not yet been characterized.
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether TREM2 affected
tau pathology, the microglial response to tau pathology, or neu-
rodegeneration. Surprisingly, despite finding no significant changes
in tau accumulation, we observed attenuated brain atrophy to-
gether with reduced microglial activation in PS19 human tau
(htau) transgenic mice lacking TREM2. Collectively, our data
demonstrate that TREM2 mitigates the microglial response to tau
pathology or damage induced by tau aggregates, which protects
against neurodegeneration.

Neurodegeneration. To investigate the effects of TREM2 on tauop-
athy, we crossed Trem2+/+ (T2+/+) and Trem2−/− (T2−/−) mice (21)
to PS19 tau-transgenic mice to generate T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS mice.
PS19 mice express an htau transgene containing a P301S mutation
that is causative for a familial form of frontal temporal dementia
(FTD). These mice acquire substantial tangle deposition and gliosis
by 9 mo of age (22). Additionally, PS19 mice develop gross neuro-
degeneration culminating in severe brain atrophy that can be visibly
observed through enlargement of the lateral ventricles and thinning
of hippocampal and certain cortical regions (22). In this study, we
only examined male mice as there is significantly more tau pathology
and neurodegeneration in male versus female PS19 mice (23).
We initially observed a striking and unexpected attenuation of
neurodegeneration in T2−/−PS compared with T2+/+PS mice (Fig.
1A). By performing a stereological assessment, we determined that
there was significantly less ventricular enlargement in T2−/−PS
mice compared with T2+/+PS littermates (Fig. 1 A and B). Notably,
there is variability in that mice appear to have substantial ven-
tricular enlargement (ventricles >1 mm3) or not, with ∼47% of
T2+/+PS mice showing markedly enlarged ventricles as opposed to
∼16% of T2−/−PS mice (Fig. 1B). This finding corresponded with
significant preservation of the entorhinal and piriform cortex vol-
ume in T2−/−PS mice (Fig. 1 A and C). While no significant
changes in hippocampal volume were observed (Fig. 1 A and D),
levels of the synaptic protein, PSD-95, were significantly lower in
T2+/+PS mice (Fig. 1 E and F), indicating more synaptic de-
generation in this region compared with T2−/−PS mice. The re-
duced brain atrophy and preservation of PSD-95 in T2−/−PS mice
suggests that loss of TREM2 function is neuroprotective in the
setting of tauopathy.
TREM2 Deficiency Does Not Alter Phosphorylated or Insoluble Tau
Levels. To investigate whether the preservation of brain volume
in T2−/−PS mice was due to a reduction in overall tau deposition,
we assessed the accumulation of p-tau and insoluble tau aggre-
gates in T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS mice. The tau monoclonal anti-
body, AT8, recognizes a double phosphorylation epitope (pS202,
pT205) and has been shown to primarily stain intraneuronal and
extraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles associated with Braak
stages IV, V, and VI (24). Staining with biotinylated AT8 did not
reveal any significant differences in p-tau deposition between
9-mo-old T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS mice in the piriform cortex (Fig.
2 A and B) or hippocampus (Fig. 2 C and D). To further examine
tau aggregation in these mice, we performed a sequential bio-
chemical extraction of hippocampal brain tissue. Samples were
first extracted in a high-salt RAB buffer, the subsequent pellet
was resuspended in a detergent radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer, and the final pellet was solubilized in 70% formic
acid (FA). RAB and RIPA fractions contain more soluble tau
species while the 70% FA fraction contains insoluble, tau aggre-
gates. The concentration of tau in each fraction was measured
using an htau-specific ELISA. We observed no significant differ-
ences in tau levels in any fraction between T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS
mice (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that TREM2 deficiency does
not result in obvious changes to p-tau accumulation or tau solu-
bility despite the attenuated neurodegenerative phenotype.
Microgliosis Is Impaired in T2−/−PS Mice in the Presence of Tauopathy.
Given that the lack of Trem2 expression did not significantly affect
p-tau or insoluble tau levels in PS19 mice, we hypothesized that
attenuation of the neurodegenerative phenotype in these mice
may be attributed to the microglial response to tau accumulation.
Reactive microglia have been described in brain regions affected
by a high density of tau tangles both in AD as well as in other
primary tauopathies such as FTD (2, 5, 25). Staining for the
microglial marker, Iba1, revealed significantly reduced micro-
gliosis in the piriform cortex (Fig. 3 A and B) and hippocampus
(Fig. 3 C and D) of T2−/−PS mice compared with T2+/+PS mice.
To further assess these findings, we quantified the total number of
immunofluorescence-labeled Iba1-positive microglial cell bodies by
confocal microscopy and found significantly fewer microglia in the
piriform cortex of T2−/−PS mice (Fig. 3E). Additionally, we ob-
served that microglia in T2+/+PS mice were amoeboid, consistent

 with a more activated phenotype, whereas microglia in T2−/−PS
mice appeared ramified (Fig. 3F). Costaining with the proliferative
cell marker, KI-67 (19), did not reveal differences between T2+/+PS
and T2−/−PS mice (Fig. S2). There were very few proliferative
microglia in either group (on average, approximately two microglia
from two sections per mouse for both genotypes). Therefore,
microglial proliferation does not appear to account for the de-
crease in the total number of microglia observed in T2−/−PS mice.
The amount of reactive gliosis in human AD patient brains has
been reported to more closely correlate with the degree of neu-
rofibrillary tangle pathology as opposed to amyloid plaque burden
(26, 27). Indeed, we observed that microgliosis, as measured by
Iba1 staining in T2+/+PS mice, significantly correlated with
AT8 p-tau staining (Fig. S3A) and the amount of FA-soluble htau
(Fig. S3B) in the hippocampus. Interestingly, these correlations
were blunted in the absence of TREM2 (Fig. S3 A and B). Like-
wise, the amount of brain atrophy, indicated by increased ventric-
ular volume, significantly correlated with the degree of p-tau
staining (Fig. S3C) and amount of FA-soluble htau (Fig. S3D) in
T2+/+PS mice. However, these correlations were ablated in T2−/−
PS mice (Fig. S3 C and D). Since the p-tau and insoluble tau
burden were not significantly different in T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS
mice, this suggests that TREM2 deficiency impairs the microglial
response to tau accumulation, which protects against brain atrophy.
Nine-Month-Old T2−/−PS Mice Have Decreased Microglial Activation and
Expression of Inflammatory Genes. We further wanted to examine
whether the loss of TREM2 influenced microglial homeostasis and
expression of proinflammatory genes in T2−/−PS mice despite
equivalent levels of tauopathy. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed on cortical tissue from T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS mice to
assess the expression of several genes that have been reported as
homeostatic (Tmem119 and P2ry12) versus activated (Cst7, Spp1,
and Apoe) microglia markers (28–31) (Fig. 4A). Only Apoe and Cst7
transcripts were significantly altered and were lower in T2−/−PS
mice, indicating less microglial activation. While Cst7 is a microglia-
specific gene (32), Apoe is expressed by both astrocytes and
microglia in the brain (33). Increased expression of Apoe in
microglia has been recently reported in several neurodegenerative
disease models as an indicator of microglial activation in response
to amassing pathologies and subsequent cell damage (28–31).
Therefore, we investigated whether accrual of tau pathology in the
piriform cortex altered accumulation of ApoE specifically in
microglia. Coimmunostaining revealed ApoE-positive puncta colo-
calized within Iba1-positive microglial cell bodies (Fig. 4B). Fur-
thermore, the percentage of microglia displaying this phenotype was
significantly lower in T2−/−PS mice (Fig. 4C). These data indicate an
overall reduction in microglial activation in the absence of TREM2.
We also assessed several inflammatory markers previously im-
plicated in AD (5). Consistent with the reduction in reactive
microglia in T2−/−PS mice, we observed a significant decrease in the
expression of both IL-1 isoforms, IL-1β and IL-1α (Fig. 4D). IL-
1 signaling has been shown to induce expression of other proin-
flammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-6 (5). Accordingly,
TNF-α was significantly down-regulated in T2−/−PS mice; however,
IL-6 transcript levels were unaltered (Fig. 4D). In addition to cy-
tokines, complement proteins are reported to be increased in brain
regions with AD pathology (5). We found the early subcomponent
of the complement cascade, C1q, was significantly down-regulated

 in T2−/−PS mice (Fig. 4D). Thus, there is a decrease in neuro-
inflammation in T2−/−PS mice despite tangle deposition and tau-
induced damage.
Astrogliosis Is Reduced in T2−/−PS Mice. Regions burdened by pa-
thology in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions are also
characterized by the presence of reactive astrocytes. Recent studies
have further demonstrated that microglia can influence astrocyte
reactivity in several disease models (34, 35). In our qRT-PCR
analyses for inflammatory mediators, we found that the reactive
astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was signif-
icantly reduced in the cortex of T2−/−PS mice (Fig. 5A). Immu-
nostaining for GFAP confirmed significantly less astrogliosis in both
the piriform cortex (Fig. 5 B and D) and hippocampus (Fig. 5 C and
E) of T2−/−PS compared with T2+/+PS mice. The degree of GFAP
staining in the hippocampus strongly correlated with the amount of
p-tau pathology in both groups (Fig. S4A). Interestingly, however,
the correlation between GFAP astrocyte and Iba1 microglia staining
was diminished in T2−/−PS compared with T2+/+PS mice (Fig. S4B).
This supports the notion that microglia influence reactive astrocytes
in tauopathy and that this occurs in a TREM2-dependent manner.
Discussion
Our study provides insights into how loss of TREM2 function im-
pacts tau-associated pathologies and the neurodegeneration that
ensues in the brain. Surprisingly, it indicates that TREM2 deficiency
in the setting of pure tauopathy limits gliosis and neuroinflammation
as well as protects against brain atrophy. T2−/−PS mice had signifi-
cantly attenuated ventricular enlargement and thinning of the
entorhinal and piriform cortex layers compared with T2+/+PS mice
despite no significant differences in p-tau and insoluble tau accu-
mulation. Further analysis revealed decreased microgliosis and
astrogliosis in regions affected by tauopathy in T2−/−PS mice, which
corresponded with reduced expression of several proinflammatory
genes. These observations suggest that TREM2 facilitates a micro-
glial response to tau pathology and or tau-mediated damage in the
brain. Furthermore, our results support that microglia can contrib-
ute to the neurodegenerative process in tauopathy without altering
tau aggregation.
The absence of TREM2 is associated with decreased micro-
gliosis in a variety of disease models, but the ultimate effects on the
different pathologies and neuronal integrity differ. It has previously
been shown that TREM2 mediates a microglial response to amy-
loidosis although not necessarily impacting total plaque load (20,
23). Reminiscent of these observations, we did not detect any
obvious effects on tau deposition in T2−/−PS mice but did find
decreased microgliosis in areas with abundant tauopathy. Alto-
gether, these data suggest that lack of TREM2 function impairs
microglial response to protein aggregation in AD but does not
necessarily aggravate it. However, the consequences of TREM2-
mediated microgliosis in the context of plaque and tangle pathol-
ogies diverge. Previous work illustrates that TREM2 helps sustain

 a microglial response around plaques that may function to contain
toxic Aβ species and protect surrounding neurites (19, 20). Thus,
TREM2 signaling may be beneficial in responding to amyloid
pathology, while variants leading to a loss of TREM2 function are
detrimental. In contrast, our study revealed lack of TREM2 dur-
ing tauopathy was neuroprotective, reducing gliosis and neuro-
inflammation, which corresponded with preservation of brain
volume. Furthermore, no effects on p-tau pathology were seen in
this model, as opposed to observations of increased neuritic dys-
trophy and p-tau accumulation surrounding amyloid plaques in
TREM2-deficient mice (19, 20). We hypothesize that the increase
in p-tau detected around plaques in Trem2−/− mice results from
either increased damage from amyloid to surrounding neurites or
decreased phagocytic clearance of neurites due to less plaque-
associated microglia, whereas the p-tau detected in the PS19
mice is attributable to neuronal tau aggregation. Another report
also observed beneficial effects of TREM2 deficiency on neuro-
inflammation and degeneration. Trem2−/− mice had reduced levels
of inflammatory transcripts, less hippocampal atrophy, and rescue
of behavioral deficits 120 d after traumatic brain injury (36).
Overall, these studies indicate TREM2 signaling is important for
facilitating the microglial response to damage in the brain and
echo the juxtaposing roles that have been described for microglia
in neurodegenerative diseases.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how loss
of TREM2 function impacts microglial fitness and contributes to
various disease phenotypes. For instance, decreased neuro-
inflammatory markers in TREM2-deficient stroke, traumatic
brain injury, and neuropathic pain models may result from im-
paired chemotaxis following neuronal injury (30) and decreased
microglial activation (36–38). Similarly, we found decreases in
the percentage of reactive microglia in regions affected by tau-
opathy in aged T2−/−PS were associated with reduction in in-
flammatory transcripts, specifically IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and
C1q, suggesting loss of TREM2 function impacts microglia acti-
vation, hindering inflammatory responses. However, these obser-
vations cannot be definitively attributed to deficits in microglial
activation since microgliosis and astrogliosis were reduced as well,
making it unclear whether lower cytokines levels are merely a re-
sult of overall decreased gliosis. Administration of an agonistic
TREM2 antibody significantly increased TNF-α and IL-1β levels
in vivo, supporting a microglia activating, proinflammatory role for
TREM2 signaling (38). However, TREM2 has classically been
described as modestly antiinflammatory and loss of function has
also been shown to reduce the same inflammatory markers, such as
IL-1β and TNF-α, in other studies (21, 39). Therefore, it remains
unclear whether and how TREM2 contributes to microglial acti-
vation and regulation of neuroinflammation.
TREM2-deficient microglia have also been shown to have
impaired proliferative ability and decreased viability. Trem2−/−
plaque-associated microglia have increased TUNEL staining
indicative of cellular apoptosis (14) and decreased staining of the
proliferation marker KI-67 (19). A recent report further detailed
that deficits in cellular metabolism lead to accumulation of
autophagic bodies in Trem2−/− microglia and are responsible for
decreasing microglial health (40). We did not observe significant
differences in microglial proliferation in PS19 mice regardless of
Trem2 genotype. Given the reduction in the number of total
microglia in T2−/−PS mice is not attributable to cellular pro-
liferation, TREM2-deficient microglia may be undergoing simi-
lar metabolic stress which impacts their fitness and capacity to
respond to accumulating damage incited by tauopathy, possibly
leading to inadvertent cell death. This would also account for the
total decrease in microgliosis that was observed. Recent studies
provided further evidence that TREM2 promotes microglial
survival via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (41, 42). These
results suggest that reduced TREM2 signaling leaves microglia
vulnerable to succumbing to pathological insults and injury.
It should be noted that microgliosis deficits do not always equate
with increased neuronal injury. Chronic microglial activation has
been hypothesized to lead to excessive neuroinflammation that may
exacerbate AD pathologies and neurodegeneration (43). Analysis
of human AD brain tissue has revealed up-regulation of several
inflammatory cytokines in areas of dense tangle pathology and
gliosis in AD and other tauopathies (44, 45). Microgliosis induced
by protein aggregation may enhance local neuroinflammation and
neuronal damage to accelerate disease progression. In this study,
we observed that decreased microgliosis, caused by TREM2 de-
ficiency, was associated with less brain atrophy in the context of tau
pathology. Since loss-of-function variants in TREM2 are associated
with increased risk of AD, we were surprised by this striking pro-
tective effect. The attenuation of neurodegeneration and micro-
gliosis observed in TREM2-deficient mice coincides with other
recent data from our laboratory in which we found that there was
strikingly reduced inflammation and neurodegeneration in PS19
mice lacking ApoE (35). Taken together, these studies suggest
that microglial inflammation promotes tau-dependent degener-
ation. One caveat is that the PS19 mouse is a model of pure
tauopathy that expresses a variant of tau that causes FTD and,
unlike in AD, does not first develop amyloid plaques. Many
groups have reported that loss of TREM2 function exacerbates
amyloid-dependent toxicity in mouse models, including accu-
mulation of p-tau and neuritic dystrophy around plaques. Taken
together, it is possible that TREM2 function is critical for miti-
gating amyloid-dependent toxicity early in AD, but subsequently,
TREM2-dependent microgliosis becomes detrimental following
the onset of tau pathology to promote neurodegeneration. In
other words, there may be stage and pathology-specific effects of
TREM2 in AD. Moving forward, it is critical that we gain a
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the potential
protective and deleterious effects of TREM2 signaling in the
setting of AD pathologies. This may be facilitated by mechanistic
in vitro studies, further analysis of mouse models, and examining
soluble TREM2 fragments detectable in human cerebral spinal
fluid throughout the course of AD (46, 47). Elucidating the
functions of TREM2 during the progression of AD may lead to
increased understanding of the role of innate immunity in AD
and aid in developing novel disease-altering treatment strategies.
Methods
Animals. PS19 htau transgenic mice (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory,
https://www.jax.org/strain/008169) expressing the T34 isoform (1N4R) with a
P301S mutation were crossed with Trem2−/− or Trem2+/+ mice to generate
Trem2+/+ × PS19 (T2+/+PS) and Trem2−/− × PS19 (T2−/−PS) mice. Only male
T2+/+PS and T2−/−PS mice were used for analysis in this study. All mice were
on a C57BL/6 background. Animal procedures were performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington
University School of Medicine.
Brain Extraction and Preparation of Tissue Homogenates. Mice were anes-
thetized with i.p. pentobarbital (200 mg/kg), followed by perfusion with 3 U/mL
heparin in cold Dulbecco’s PBS. The brains were carefully extracted and cut
into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere was collected for immunostain-
ing and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight before being transferred
to 30% sucrose and stored at 4 °C until they were sectioned. Brains were cut
coronally into 50-μm sections on a freezing sliding microtome (SM1020R;
Leica) and stored in cryoprotectant solution (0.2 M PBS, 15% sucrose, 33%
ethylene glycol) at −20 °C until use. The right hemisphere was dissected to
isolate the hippocampus for biochemical analysis, and the tissue was kept
at −80 °C until analyzed. Biochemical extractions on brain tissue were per-
formed as previously described (48) to assess tau solubility.
Volumetric Analysis of Brain Sections. Seven coronal brain sections (300 μm
between sections) beginning rostrally at the ventricle to the dorsal end of the
hippocampus were mounted on slides and allowed to dry overnight. These
sections correspond to bregma coordinates −1.23 to −2.69 in the mouse brain
atlas (49). The following day, sections were stained in cresyl violet for 6 min
and dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations followed by xylene and

 coverslipped with Cytoseal 60. Slides were imaged and processed as previously
described. Volumes were quantified by tracing the ventricle or entorhinal-
piriform cortex region using NDP viewing software.
Immunostaining for Tau and Glial Markers. Immunostaining was performed on
free-floating sections in 12-well plates. All steps were performed at room
temperature, unless indicated otherwise. Immunofluorescence and immu-
nohistochemical stains were performed as described in SI Methods. All stains
were quantified in the specified brain region in two to three sections
(300 μm between sections) per mouse using ImageJ software, version 2.0.0
(National Institutes of Health), unless otherwise indicated.
Immunoblot for PSD-95. Total protein concentrations in hippocampal RIPA ly-
sates were determined using a BCA kit (23235; Thermo Fisher) per manufac-
turer’s instructions. For analyses of PSD-95, 25 μg from each sample was run as
described in SI Methods, and detection of ERK was used as a loading control.
RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Analyses. RNA was isolated from cortical
tissue using TRIzol (15596018; Thermo Fisher) per the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription kit (4387406; Applied Biosystems) per the manufacturer’s
protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using standard TaqMan probes
(4453320; Thermo Fisher) on a Quantstudio 12k Flex System (Applied
Biosystems). Relative expression was quantified using the ΔΔCt method.
Β-actin was used as the reference gene and expression as normalized to T2+/+PS.
Tau ELISA. The concentration of tau species in hippocampal tissue extracts was
quantified in a tau sandwich ELISA as previously described (48) using Tau-5 as
the coating antibody and human-specific biotinylated HT7 for detection
described in SI Methods. No modifications were made to the protocol.
Statistical Analyses. All graphs represent the mean of all samples in each
group ± SEM. GraphPad Prism 5.01 was used to perform statistical analyses.
Significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s test, unless otherwise
indicated, and P < 0.05 was considered significant.
