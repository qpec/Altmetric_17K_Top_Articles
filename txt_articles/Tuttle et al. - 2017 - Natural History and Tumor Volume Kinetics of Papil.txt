IMPORTANCE Active surveillance of low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is now an accepted
alternative to immediate surgery, but experience with this approach outside of Japan is
limited. The kinetics (probability, rate, and magnitude) of PTC tumor growth under active
surveillance have not been well defined.
OBJECTIVE To describe the kinetics of PTC tumor growth during active surveillance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study of 291 patients undergoing active
surveillance for low-risk PTC (intrathyroidal tumors �1.5 cm) with serial tumor measurements
via ultrasonography at a tertiary referral center in the United States.
INTERVENTION Active surveillance.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The cumulative incidence, rate, and magnitude of the
change in tumor diameter or volume, as well as associations with patient and tumor
characteristics.
RESULTS Of the 291 patients, 219 (75.3%) were women; mean (SD) age was 52 (15) years.
During a median (range) active surveillance of 25 (6-166) months, growth in tumor diameter
of 3 mm or more was observed in 11 of 291 (3.8%) patients, with a cumulative incidence of
2.5% (2 years) and 12.1% (5 years). No regional or distant metastases developed during active
surveillance. In all cases, 3-dimensional measurements of tumor volume allowed for earlier
identification of growth (median, 8.2 months; range, 3-46 months before increase in tumor
diameter). In multivariable analysis, both younger age at diagnosis (hazard ratio per year,
0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P = .006) and risk category at presentation (hazard ratio for
inappropriate, 55.17; 95% CI, 9.4-323.19; P < .001) were independently associated with the
likelihood of tumor growth. Of the tumors experiencing volume growth, kinetics
demonstrated a classic exponential growth pattern, with a median doubling time of 2.2 years
(range, 0.5-4.8 years; median r2 = 0.75; range, 0.42-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The rates of tumor growth during active surveillance in a US
cohort with PTCs measuring 1.5 cm or less were low. Serial measurement of tumor volumes
may facilitate early identification of tumors that will continue to grow and thereby inform the
timing of surveillance imaging and therapeutic interventions.

 T
he recent dramatic increase in thyroid cancer inci-
dence in the United States and other countries has been
characterized as an “epidemic of diagnosis” rather than
an epidemic of disease.1 With wider use of diagnostic and
imaging technologies, many small, subclinical papillary thy-
roid cancers (PTCs) are now being detected.2-4 If never diag-
nosedandtreated,most(estimatedas50%-90%)ofthesePTCs
wouldnotgoontocausesymptomsordeath.5Recognizingthis
indolent behavior, American Thyroid Association guidelines
now endorse active surveillance as an alternative to immedi-
ate thyroidectomy in properly selected patients with very low-
risk tumors.6
In landmark Japanese studies establishing the safety of
active surveillance for papillary thyroid microcarcinomas
(<1.0-cm diameter), 10% to 15% of patients experienced tu-
mor growth, usually within 5 years.7 Growth of 3 mm—the
smallest difference reliably measured with ultrasonography—
was also the threshold for surgical intervention. Beyond this
singlebinaryendpoint,thekinetics(probability,rate,andmag-
nitude)ofPTCgrowthduringactivesurveillancehavenotbeen
well described. A more dynamic characterization of tumor
growth based on 3-D volume measurements may allow for ear-
lier determination of whether a PTC is stable or growing. Such
information would be of value in more precise tailoring of sur-
veillance imaging and, if needed, intervention, in patients un-
dergoing active surveillance. In this study, we describe tumor
volume kinetics in 291 patients undergoing active surveil-
lance for low-risk PTCs (≤1.5 cm) at a tertiary referral center in
the United States.
Methods
We identified a cohort of 291 patients with PTC prospectively
followed with active surveillance at Memorial Sloan Ketter-
ing Cancer Center, New York, New York (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement and Table 1), with
1. thyroid nodules classified as PTC (Bethesda category VI), or
suspicious for PTC (Bethesda category V) with suspicious
ultrasonographic characteristics (hypoechoic with irregu-
lar margins, microcalcifications, or taller-than-wide shape),
2. tumor size 1.5 cm or less in maximal dimension at diagno-
sis,
3. no clinical or radiographic evidence of extrathyroidal ex-
tension, invasion of local structures, or regional or distant
metastases,
4. thyroid-stimulating hormone level within the reference
range,
5. cytopathology interpretation by Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center thyroid cytopathologists,
6. ultrasonography examinations by Memorial Sloan Ketter-
ing Cancer Center radiologists every 6 months for 2 years,
then yearly, and
7. minimum of 6 months’follow-up at Memorial Sloan Ket-
tering Cancer Center.
At diagnosis, patients were classified under a previously
described clinical framework as ideal, appropriate, or inap-
propriate for active surveillance.8 Surgery was recom-
mended if the primary tumor increased 3 mm or more in great-
est dimension over baseline or if there was evidence for
extrathyroidal extension or nodal or distant metastases.9 Tu-
mor volumes were measured and calculated relative to pre-
biopsy baseline. A meaningful change in volume was defined
as a greater than 50% increase from baseline.10 The study was
approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center In-
stitutional Review Board. Written informed consent for pro-
spective data collection and tumor acquisition was obtained
from 249 participants. Data from the remaining 42 partici-
pants were collected and analyzed after a waiver was ob-
tained from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center In-
stitutionalReviewBoardforretrospectivedatacollection.None
of the participants received financial compensation.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous data are presented as means (SDs) or medians
(ranges), as appropriate for each variable. Tumor growth rates
were calculated by fitting a least-squares regression model to
log-transformed tumor volume measurements and plotted on
semi-log curves. Doubling time was calculated by dividing log
(2) by log (1 + growth rate). The volume (milliliters) of the tu-
mor was calculated using the ellipsoid equation: π/6 ×
length × width × height.Percentagechangeinvolumewascal-
culated relative to the baseline before the initial fine-needle
aspiration. A meaningful change in tumor volume was de-
fined as a greater than 50% increase from baseline. Results are
presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. The cumula-
tive incidence of tumor diameter or volume growth was cal-
culated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical test-
ing was performed using the log rank test or univariate Cox
regression analysis. Multivariable Cox regression was used to
analyze clinical and pathologic factors associated with tumor
growth, with the model including all covariates with P values
<.05 on univariate analysis. Analyses were performed using
SPSS, version 24.0 (IBM Corp) and R, version 3.3.1 (R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing).

Key Points
Question What are the natural history and growth kinetics of
low-risk papillary thyroid cancers in patients undergoing active
surveillance in the United States?
Findings In this cohort study of 291 patients undergoing active
surveillance for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer, most cancers
remained stable over several years of observation. Serial
measurements of tumor volume defined the rate of growth for
each tumor and can facilitate early identification of tumor growth.
Meaning Tumor volume kinetics can inform the timing of
surveillance imaging and therapeutic interventions for patients
with papillary thyroid cancer undergoing active surveillance.

 months) (median age at diagnosis, 51 years [range, 20-86
years], 75.3% women, 79.7% with tumors ≤1.0 cm, and
20.3% with tumors 1.1-1.5 cm maximal diameter) (Table 1).
Few patients (13 [4.5%]) were classified as ideal candidates
for observation (age >60 years, solitary papillary microcar-
cinoma within an otherwise normal thyroid gland). Most
patients (273 [93.8%]) were classified as appropriate for
observation on the basis of either age (<60 years old), the
presence of other benign appearing nodules or ultrasono-
graphic characteristics of thyroiditis, or close proximity to
the thyroid capsule (≤2 mm of normal thyroid tissue
between the nodule and the thyroid capsule).
At the time of writing, 279 (95.9%) patients remained un-
der active surveillance, 5 (1.7%) underwent thyroidectomy af-
ter an increase in tumor size of 3 mm or more, 5 (1.7%) elected
to undergo surgery despite no increase in tumor size, and 2
(0.7%) were lost to follow-up. No regional or distant metasta-
ses developed during active surveillance.
Five patients (1.7%) classified as inappropriate for obser-
vation refused surgery at the time of diagnosis and elected
to be monitored with observational management despite
ultrasonographic features suspicious for minor extrathyroi-
dal extension into overlying strap muscles (n = 3) or subcen-
timeter suspicious lymph nodes adjacent to the thyroid in
the central or lateral neck (n = 2). Two of these patients
underwent surgery for an increase in tumor diameter and
tumor volume after 12 and 18 months of active surveillance,
respectively.
Six patients demonstrating a tumor diameter increase of
3 mm or more had not had surgery at the time of writing (2
were scheduled for thyroid surgery, 2 were planning to
schedule surgery at a more convenient time, and 2 whose
tumors increased in diameter by 3 mm after more than 4
years refused surgery). Among the 10 patients who under-
went surgery, none of the cancers had histologically adverse
features, such as extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular
invasion, or metastatic lymph node involvement. No patients
received radioactive iodine ablation. None of the patients had
biochemical or structural evidence of residual or recurrent
disease during a mean of 7.3 (range, 3-32) months of postop-
erative follow-up.
Changes in Tumor Size During Active Surveillance
Tumor diameter growth of 3 mm or more was observed in 11
of 291 (3.8%) patients. The cumulative incidence of growth of
3 mm or more was 2.5% at 2 years and 12.1% at 5 years. The
cumulative incidence of volume increase greater than 50%
was 11.5% at 2 years and 24.8% at 5 years (Figure 1). Volume
increased by more than 50% in 36 patients, was stable in 229
patients, decreased by more than 50% in 19 patients, and
could not be determined in 7 patients (Figure 2). All tumors
experiencing 3-mm growth also demonstrated a volume
increase greater than 50% (mean increase, 178%; range, 96%-
364%).

 risk category (HR for inappropriate, 55.17; 95% CI, 9.40-
323.19; P < .001) were independently associated with the
likelihood of 3-mm diameter growth. Patients younger than
50 years at diagnosis had a nearly 5-fold likelihood of experi-
encing tumor growth compared with patients 50 years or
older (27.3% vs 4.6% at 5 years; HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.2-17.0;
P = .03) (eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement). Similar results
were observed for tumor volume, with both younger age (HR,
0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P = .01) and risk category (HR for
inappropriate, 10.54; 95% CI, 2.39-46.53; P = .002) indepen-
dently associated with the likelihood of 50% volume growth.
Tumor size (<1.0 cm vs 1.0-1.5 cm) at presentation was not
associated with an increase in either volume or diameter (HR,
0.93; 95% CI, 0.36-2.41 and HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.41-9.23,
respectively).
Volume Growth Kinetics
Each tumor experiencing a greater than 50% increase in vol-
ume demonstrated growth kinetics consistent with classic ex-
ponential growth patterns (Figure 3), with a median doubling
timeof2.2years(range,0.5-4.8years)(medianr2 = 0.75;range,
0.42-0.99). Among these tumors, the mean (SD) time to 50%
volume increase was 22.9 (15.0) months. Among the 11
tumorsexperiencing3mmormorediametergrowth,themean
time to reach this threshold was 34.1 (15.5) months. In all
cases, a 50% increase in volume preceded the 3-mm or more
increase in tumor diameter by a median of 8.2 months (range,
3-46 months).
Discussion
We report the outcomes of 291 patients undergoing active sur-
veillance for PTC in the United States. Consistent with previ-
ous reports from Japan, our findings confirm that only 10% to
15% of small PTCs will increase in tumor diameter by 3 mm or
more during the first 5 years of active surveillance and that an
increase in tumor size is more likely in younger patients.7 In
thisstudy,weextendtheseobservationsbydemonstratingthat
(1) the kinetics of PTC volume growth follow classic exponen-
tial growth patterns, indicating that growth can be accurately
modeled, (2) tumor volume measurements appear to iden-
tify growth before the tumor diameter reaches the 3-mm
threshold, (3) small PTCs above the traditional 1.0-cm cutoff
(1.0-1.5 cm) show a similarly low likelihood of growth, (4) a
small percentage of patients experience tumor regression, (5)
active surveillance can be successfully implemented outside
of a Japanese population, and (6) our institution’
s previously
described clinicopathologic classification of appropriateness
for active surveillance was associated with likelihood of
growth.8,9,11
Limitations
There is little doubt that the success of our active surveil-
lance management program depends on the availability of
specialized and highly skilled radiologists who are an inte-
gral part of our thyroid cancer disease management team. A
senior radiologist reviews all images prepared by the ultra-
sonography technician and compares them with previous
ultrasonographic images before the patient is released from
the suite. This approach minimizes the expected variation

 between examiners and examinations and also allows us to
be confident that the serial 3-D measurements used to cal-
culate the tumor value fall within the ±3-mm range of varia-
tion that we expected. In the few patients who did not have
reliable 3-D measurements (2.4%) (Figure 2), we used the
maximum diameter of the nodule as the indicator of tumor
growth. With experience, expertise, and careful attention to
detail, we are confident that these types of ultrasonographic
examinations can be done outside of major medical centers.
The other important limitation was that the number of
patients in the inappropriate for active surveillance category
was small, and therefore the association between this vari-
able and outcomes will require further validation as we

As the number of small, incidentally detected PTCs contin-
ues to increase, new approaches are needed to avoid over-
treatmentoftumorsthatwouldotherwiseremainindolentand
asymptomatic while identifying the small percentage of such
tumors that will continue to grow. Because PTCs appear to fol-
low predictable growth kinetics under active surveillance, se-
rial measurements of tumor volume hold significant promise
in triaging patients to observation vs surgery. Additional stud-
ies will helpful to determine the clinical significance of mild
growth in PTC diameter and volume and further refine the
thresholds for intervention.
