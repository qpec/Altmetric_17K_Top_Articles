Health organizations recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months of life. The
current study contributes to a growing body of research that examines whether the purported benefits of
breastfeeding are causal. We systematically evaluated the role of an expectant mother’s prenatal breastfeeding
intentions, which reflect not only demographic characteristics, but also knowledge, attitudes, and social norms
about infant feeding, and therefore serve as a proxy for positive maternal selection into breastfeeding. We used
the Infant Feeding Practices Study (IFPS) II (n = 1008) to examine a heretofore overlooked group of mo-
thers—those who intended to breastfeed but did not actually breastfeed. Results suggest that mothers who
intended to breastfeed had infants with fewer ear infections and respiratory syncytial viruses, and used fewer
antibiotics in the first year of life compared to infants whose mothers did not intend to breastfeed, irrespective of
whether they actually breastfed. Because breastfeeding intention is a confounding characteristic that proxies for
positive maternal selection and does not represent a causal mechanism for infant health, we further examined
how mothers who intended to breastfeed differed from mothers who did not intend to breastfeed. Results suggest
that mothers who intended to breastfeed had more knowledge about potential food contaminants and consulted
more sources of information about nutrition and diet than mothers who did not intend to breastfeed. Taken
together, our results underscore the need for new policy interventions aimed at improving infant health.
1. Introduction
One of the very first decisions a new mother will make is how to
feed her newborn infant. This is an important decision, as early nutri-
tion is related to health in infancy and later in life (Almond, Currie, &
Duque, in press). Given evidence that breastfeeding is associated with
positive infant health outcomes, the World Health Organization (WHO)
and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that mo-
thers exclusively breastfeed for six months, and then continue for one
year or longer according to the preferences of the mother and infant
(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2012; World Health Organization,
2003). The AAP further asserts that breastfeeding “should be con-
sidered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice” (American
Academy of Pediatrics, 2012). This message has been internalized by
the medical community and the general public, as evidenced by na-
tional, state, and local policies that promote breastfeeding (Naylor,
2001; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010).
Despite being endorsed as an important factor for infant health, the
evidence on the causal effect of breastfeeding is mixed. Although some
research suggests that breastfeeding is linked with infant health benefits
(Ip et al., 2007; Kramer, 2010), there is also evidence that the benefits
are overstated due to selection bias, a specific type of confounding that
can bias statistical estimates if unaddressed (Colen and Ramey, 2014;
Der, Batty, & Deary, 2006; Evenhouse & Reilly, 2005). Most studies
draw on observational data, and must therefore carefully account for
the fact that mothers who breastfeed tend to be more advantaged
compared to mothers who formula feed. Without accounting for base-
line maternal differences through research design or fully including all
confounding variables, statistical models may overstate the positive
relationship between breastfeeding and infant health.
The novelty of our study is to critically re-evaluate the relationship
between breastfeeding and infant health outcomes by examining a
proxy for maternal characteristics and advantage– the mother’s pre-
natal intention to breastfeed. This also allows us to evaluate a here-
tofore overlooked group: mothers who intended to breastfeed but did
not actually breastfeed. Prenatal breastfeeding intentions may capture
maternal characteristics that are largely overlooked in existing studies.
There is evidence that maternal breastfeeding intentions are a stronger
factor in predicting breastfeeding behavior than demographic char-
acteristics alone (Donath & Amir, 2003). Prenatal breastfeeding inten-
tions reflect sociodemographic characteristics and maternal knowledge,
attitudes, and social norms about infant feeding methods (Barnes, Stein,

 Smith & Pollock, 1997; Humphreys, Thompson, & Miner, 1998; Mitra,
Khoury, Hinton & Carothers, 2004; Persad & Mensinger, 2007), all of
which may play a critical role in infant health.
In this study, we draw on longitudinal data from the Infant Feeding
Practices Study (IFPS) II, and address two specific research questions:
(1) do prenatal breastfeeding intentions serve as a proxy for positive
maternal selection into breastfeeding, a specific type of confounding
characteristic that lessens or fully accounts for the association between
breastfeeding behavior and three infant health outcomes in the first
year of life?; (2) how do mothers who intend to breastfeed differ from
mothers who do not intend to breastfeed, in terms of their knowledge of
nutritional practices and access to information?
By probing these questions, our research makes two important
contributions. First, ours is the first study to account for the mother’s
prenatal intention to breastfeed when estimating the relationship be-
tween breastfeeding and infant health. Second, we move beyond re-
gression adjustment to understand how intending and non-intending
mothers differ in their health knowledge. Prior research focuses on
demographic characteristics as potential confounders and therefore
identifies population groups that are less likely to breastfeed, but this
strategy does not uncover the mechanisms that account for better
health among breastfed babies compared to formula-fed babies. This
prior research therefore does little to improve our understanding of
how to enhance infant health via program or policy interventions, apart
from encouraging breastfeeding among these groups. If intending and
non-intending mothers differ in terms of access to information and
health knowledge, this may suggest a different course of action than
simply promoting breastfeeding in targeted populations to improve
health in infancy and throughout the life course.
2. Background
2.1. Breastfeeding and infant health
There is mounting evidence to support a positive causal relationship
between early nutrition and improved individual outcomes throughout
the life course (Almond et al., forthcoming; Currie & Rossin-Slater,
2015). The most rapid period of physical growth and neural develop-
ment is between birth and age 3, making early nutrition an especially
important foundation for current and later health (Case & Paxson,
2010). Therefore, an important issue for mothers, doctors, and policy-
makers is to understand the nutritional value of breastmilk relative to
the most likely alternative: infant formula.
Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for establishing
causal relationships, are difficult to implement in breastfeeding studies
due to logistical and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, there is one often-
cited randomized controlled trial of a breastfeeding intervention in
Belarus that provides some evidence of a causal link between exclusive
and prolonged breastfeeding and children’s health (Kramer, Chalmers,
Hodnett, Sevkovskaya, Dzikovich & Shapiro, 2001). Using a sample of
about 17,000 mothers in Belarus from 1996–1997, this study found that
breastfeeding reduced the risk of gastrointestinal infections and eczema
in the first year of life, but was unrelated to the risk of respiratory in-
fections (Kramer, 2010; Kramer et al., 2001). This study implicitly ac-
counted for prenatal breastfeeding intentions by limiting the sample to
mothers who intended to breastfeed, but could not explicitly examine
the confounding role of positive selection into breastfeeding. Further-
more, these findings may not be generalizable to an American context.
For example, Belarus’s drinking water, a crucial ingredient for infant
formula, is historically of poor quality (The World Bank, 2013). These
conditions may not be generalizable to the United States.
A comprehensive meta-analysis of observational studies in devel-
oped countries found evidence that breastfeeding is associated with
several health benefits for infants and children, including reduced risk
of ear infections (acute otitis media), eczema (atopic dermatitis), severe
lower-respiratory tract diseases, diarrhea (non-specific gastroenteritis),
and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Ip et al., 2007). The meta-analysis
found weak or inconclusive evidence on the link between breastfeeding
and asthma, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, childhood leu-
kemia, infant mortality, and cognitive development. The study also
noted that existing research often yields mixed or inconclusive evi-
dence, in part due to the inconsistent quality of the studies, sample
selection criteria, and varying ability to adjust for potentially con-
founding factors (Ip et al., 2007).
A central challenge for observational studies of breastfeeding is
addressing selection bias, which is the nonrandom sorting of women
who breastfeed or formula feed. Breastfeeding mothers are more likely
to be well-educated, white, married, and have higher income than non-
breastfeeding mothers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2013; Forste and Hoffmann, 2008; Jones, Power, Queenan & Schulkin,
2015; Wen, Kong, Eiden, Sharma & Xie, 2014). It is possible that these
sociodemographic advantages are related to both successful breast-
feeding and better infant health outcomes. Indeed, several studies have
found that when these demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
are taken into account, the long-term benefits of breastfeeding are weak
or insignificant (Cesur, Sabia, Kelly & Yang, 2017; Colen & Ramey,
2014; Der et al., 2006; Evenhouse & Reilly, 2005; Grube, Von Der
Lippe, Schlaud & Brettschneider, 2015; Jenkins & Foster, 2013; Jiang,
Foster, & Gibson-Davis, 2011; Kramer, 2010; for exceptions see Belfield
& Kelly 2012; Rees and Sabia 2015; Wehby 2014). In other words, the
nonrandom selection of mothers who successfully breastfeed confounds
estimates of infant health outcomes.
Sibling fixed effects studies, which compare a breastfed sibling to a
formula-fed sibling, may help to address some concerns about the
confounding variables attributable to maternal selection bias. In this
quasi-experimental design, the assumption is that many of the time-
invariant characteristics of the family, such as genetic endowments or
parental quality, are held constant while only the breastfeeding treat-
ment varies. Several studies employing this strategy found that among
breast and formula- feeding discordant sibling pairs, outcomes were
similar for children regardless of whether they were breast or formula
fed. This suggests that most physical health benefits associated with
breastfeeding are likely attributable to demographic characteristics
such as race and socioeconomic status, and other difficult to measure
unobservable characteristics (Cesur et al., 2017; Colen & Ramey, 2014;
Evenhouse & Reilly, 2005). While studies that employ sibling fixed-ef-
fects have several advantages, they are limited to families with siblings
who were fed differently, and cannot evaluate families with only one
child or siblings who were fed the same way. In addition to general-
izability concerns, these models also assume that the feeding method is
randomly assigned and not associated with other factors such as infant
or maternal health, or some other omitted time-varying characteristics
(Rees & Sabia, 2009), and this assumption may be difficult to justify.
While breastfeeding provides excellent nutrition for infants, mixed
research evidence shows the tradeoffs between breastmilk and formula
are not well understood. The “breast is best” message has been so
deeply internalized that failure to meet breastfeeding recommendations
makes many mothers feel inadequate (Shah, 2013), placing them at
increased risk for maternal depression (Borra, Iacovou, & Sevilla,
2015). Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months requires a significant in-
vestment from mothers and may be difficult to achieve, particularly for
mothers who work outside the home, face physiological challenges, or
have little social support. It is important to contextualize breastfeeding
research in light of the realistic trade-offs that many mothers face
(Colen & Ramey, 2014).
2.2. Breastfeeding intentions as a proxy for positive maternal selection
Many mothers make breastfeeding plans when they are pregnant
(Lawson & Tulloch, 1995). Prenatal breastfeeding intentions (hereafter
“intentions”) are an antecedent to breastfeeding behavior that may
provide insight into relevant maternal characteristics. The theory of
K.M. Raissian, J.H. Su

87
 planned behavior posits that intentions (i.e., “planned behavior”) arise
from a combination of motivation, attitudes, subjective norms, and
perceived control (Ajzen, 2002; Manstead, Proffitt, & Smart, 1983;
Wambach, 1997). Similarly, breastfeeding self-efficacy theory posits
that a mother’s perceived ability to breastfeed, which is informed by
past breastfeeding experience, observations of other women breast-
feeding, encouragement from friends and family, and physiological
responses such as fatigue or stress, is related to breastfeeding intentions
(Blyth, Creedy, Dennis, Moyle, Pratt & De Vries, 2002). Intentions are,
in turn, predictive of actual behavior.
These theoretical frameworks are useful for understanding the link
between prenatal breastfeeding intentions, behavior, and infant health.
It is possible that intentions may be related to infant health regardless
of the mother’s actual breastfeeding behavior, given evidence that they
act as a proxy for other positive maternal characteristics, such as
knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and social norms about infant
feeding practices (Blyth et al., 2002; Manstead et al., 1983; Wambach,
1997). In addition, studies analyzing samples of low-income and dis-
advantaged women found that those with higher education, breast-
feeding experience, breastfeeding knowledge, self-efficacy, and per-
ceived social support were more likely to intend to breastfeed
(Humphreys et al., 1998; Mitra et al., 2004; Persad & Mensinger, 2007).
Intentions might also reflect a commitment to children’s overall health.
Women who intend to breastfeed may engage in other healthy beha-
viors related to sleep, nutrition, exercise, and medical care. For ex-
ample, women may also improve their own health practices, such as
improving their diet and exercise, in anticipation of breastfeeding.
Although prenatal intentions are strongly associated with breast-
feeding behavior, they are not deterministic (Persad & Mensinger,
2007). Approximately one-third of mothers who intend to exclusively
breastfeed are able to achieve this goal (Perrine, Scanlon, Li, Odom &
Grummer-Strawn, 2012). There are several exogenous factors that may
prevent mothers from fulfilling their intentions. For example, biological
barriers include low milk supply, pain, infections (mastitis), or clogged
milk ducts (Li, Fein, Chen & Grummer-Strawn, 2008; Thulier & Mercer,
2009). The baby may have a poor latch, be an ineffective nurser, or
have food intolerances. Institutional factors, such as hospital policies
that do not promote early breastfeeding, or encourage supplemental
formula or pacifiers, can also impede breastfeeding goals (Perrine et al.,
2012). Some factors may act as both an influence on a mother’s in-
tentions as well as her ability to realize those intentions. For example,
maternal employment, lack of social support, limited knowledge, or
limited access to professional support such as lactation consultants may
first undermine intentions and then breastfeeding success (Chezem,
Friesen, & Boettcher, 2003; McInnes & Chambers, 2008; Persad &
Mensinger, 2007).
In sum, prenatal breastfeeding intentions may be an important
factor in examining the relationship between breastfeeding and infant
health as they help us to overcome a key identification challenge in
measuring the effect of breastfeeding on infant health: that the same
characteristics that lead a mother to breastfeed may also lead to an
infant having improved health. While prior research has rigorously
examined the role of breastfeeding on infant and child outcomes using
various identification strategies, none have accounted for prenatal
breastfeeding intentions. Given mixed research evidence and the im-
portance of promoting infant health, we believe a parsimonious
strategy, whereby a proxy for maternal selection is included in the
models – thereby accounting for or reducing the confounding effects,
will be informative.
3. Material and methods
3.1. Data and sample
We draw on data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study (IFPS) II,
which was designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to examine infant
feeding practices, maternal dietary selections, and health outcomes.
The IFPS II mailed surveys to women during their third trimester of
pregnancy in 2005 (referred to as the prenatal module), and surveyed
women nearly monthly throughout the infant’s first year. The sampling
frame
was
a
nationally
distributed
consumer
opinion
panel.
Respondents were adult, healthy expectant mothers, who gave birth to
a healthy full or near-full term infant (Fein, Labiner-Wolfe, Shealy, Li,
Chen & Grummer-Strawn, 2008). The baseline sample included 4902
pregnant women. Our final analytic sample includes 1008 respondents.
Respondents were excluded due to attrition (primarily occurring be-
tween the prenatal and first postnatal interview) and, to a lesser extent,
item non-response. Table A1 compares the analytic and baseline sam-
ples, and provides detail about attrition. While the initial sample was
not nationally representative, our sample of breastfeeding mothers
(described below) is similar – though perhaps still slightly more ad-
vantaged - to the nationally representative sample described in the
Pediatric Nutrition Handbook (6th edition), which is produced by the
American Academy of Pediatrics.1 Our analytic sample of exclusively
breastfed infants is also consistent with the exclusively breastfed infant
sample in the CDC’s National Immunization Survey from 2009, which
was a nationally representative sample when appropriately weighted.
All samples show that exclusively breastfed infants are advantaged on
socio-economic indicators, though direct comparisons are difficult be-
cause of survey-to-survey covariate differences. More convincing to us
is that our first models that quantify the association between breast-
feeding and infant health are consistent with findings in extant litera-
ture, which we take as evidence that our findings are not idiosyncratic
to our sample.
3.2. Measures
When the mother was approximately 7 months pregnant – and
therefore before the birth of the infant or onset of breast or formula
feeding- she was asked, “What method do you plan to use to feed your
new baby in the first few weeks?” The response options included:
Breastfeed only, Formula feed only, Both breast and formula feed, or
Don’t know yet. The variable “intended to breastfeed” is coded 1 if she
answered “breastfeed only” and 0 otherwise.2,3
Breastfeeding behavior is captured from mothers’ postnatal (after
the infant’s birth) responses. “Exclusively Breastfed at 2 months” was
coded 1 if the infant consumed only breastmilk at two months of age,
and 0 otherwise. This is our preferred measure of breastfeeding beha-
vior, but we also created “Supplemented breastfeeding”, which was
coded 1 if a mother breastfed her infant at all at the second month and 0
otherwise. Before the 2nd month, many mothers switched from sup-
plemented to exclusive breastfeeding, which motivates our decision to
examine feeding at 2 months (Fig. 1). We also notice that the propor-
tion of breastfeeding mothers at months 2, 3, and 4 is relatively stable,
but declines in the following months. Breastfeeding at 2 months is our
preferred measure of breastfeeding because this seems to be a critical
timeframe for new mothers to make their feeding decisions. Moreover,
according to the National Immunization Survey conducted by the CDC,
1 The sample referenced by the Pediatric Nutrition Handbook comes from a study that
examined a nationally representative sample of mothers published by Ryan, Wenjun &
Acosta, (2002).
2 We also constructed “intended to breastfeed any”, which was equal to 1 if a mother
indicated she intended to “breastfeed only” or “both breast and formula feed.” Our results
are robust to the choice of intentions measure.
3 We note that a non-intending mother may state that she intends to breastfeed due to
social desirability bias. This kind of measurement error is not problematic in our study, as
intentions are simply a proxy for positive maternal selection. If a mother knows that
breastfeeding is desirable, then she likely knows about other healthy behaviors, which is
the essence of what we hope to capture with the intentions variable. Furthermore, in the
event a mother declares a breastfeeding intention but does not have enhanced knowledge
of healthy behaviors, this would attenuate the intentions variable in our regressions.

 most infants in the United States are exclusively breastfeed for only 1–2
months before mothers stop breastfeeding or initiate supplementing
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Therefore, we
chose to measure the effect of breastfeeding duration (2 months) that is
the most commonly experienced by American infants.
However, in order to evaluate policy alternatives and consider the
benefits of extended breastfeeding, we also measured the effect of the
AAP’s recommendation to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months; we
constructed variables with categories for “breastfed exclusively at 6
months,” “supplemented at or before 6 months,” “never breastfed but
intended to do so,” and “never intended and did not breastfeed.”
To examine the overlap between prenatal intentions and behavior,
we created a variable with categories for women who intended to ex-
clusively breastfeed and did, women who intended to breastfeed but did
not, and women who did not intend to and did not breastfeed. Table 1
shows that in our sample, approximately 60% of women who intended
to breastfeed were exclusively breastfeeding at the infant’s 2 month
milestone.4
We focus on three infant health outcomes: ear infections, respiratory
syncytial viruses (RSV), and antibiotic usage in the infant’s first year.5
As the IFPS II survey relies on mother-reported health information, we
examine outcomes that likely involved a medical practitioner’s diag-
nosis to minimize reporting bias. At near monthly interviews, mothers
were asked if her infant experienced the aforementioned health out-
comes in the past 2 weeks. The mother’s reports were summed across
the infant’s first year; therefore, outcomes range from 0 (never reported
health event) to 10 (always reported health event).
The short interval between surveys and confined time period of the
question (within the last two weeks) likely minimizes response error
and provides a more accurate measure of infant health than is available
in surveys administered with larger time intervals. While these mea-
sures capture a rather complete history, some events may be under-
reported.6 Measurement error in the outcome variables should not be
correlated with breastfeeding or intentions, and - if present - would
simply enlarge our standard errors.
Expectant mothers were asked if they had heard about problems in
food related to listeria, mercury, and dioxins. We created variables
indicating whether mothers had heard of each contaminant (1 = yes, 0
= no). We also constructed “heard of any contaminants,” which is
coded 1 if the mother had heard of any of the contaminants and 0
otherwise. Next, we constructed “number of contaminants heard of” by
summing those with positive responses (range: 0–3).
We also examined the dietary information sources mothers con-
sulted. Expectant mothers were asked, “Have you obtained information
about your diet or about feeding babies from any of the following
sources for this pregnancy or a previous one? For information about
feeding babies, please think of breastfeeding, formula feeding, feeding
solid foods, or any other infant feeding information.” Mothers could
provide a “yes” or “no” response to many information sources for her
prenatal diet and/or infant nutrition, respectively. We collapsed the
response options into categories for medical professionals, WIC re-
presentative, relative or family member, print source (e.g., book or
magazine), or government website. We created “any sources,” which is
equal to 1 if a mother consulted any sources and 0 if she consulted
none. “Number of sources” is equal to the number of positive responses
(range 0–6). All measures were created separately for maternal diet and
infant feeding.
We control for a host of prenatal demographic characteristics, all of
which were captured in the prenatal module, i.e. before the birth of the
Fig. 1. Proportion of women exclusively breastfeeding (Analytic Sample).

5 Breastmilk’s SIgA antibodies may protect against infections, which would reduce
antibiotic use (Hanson & Korotkova, 2002; Slade & Schwartz, 1987). Also, colostrum,
which is present in the first hours and days after birth, is thought to be rich in antibodies
and is often referred to as “liquid gold”.
6 Also note that our outcomes undercount the annual prevalence of these outcomes.
Respondents are only asked to reflect on a two week period, and surveys were not con-
ducted each month. Likewise, marginal effects generated by our models (presented in the
tables), which estimate the change in the number of health events, will also represent an
undercount.

 child or any breastfeeding has occurred: mother’s age, marital status
and household composition (married, not married and not living with
another adult, or not married but living with another adult7), education
(less than high school, high school, some college, or college graduate),
race/ethnicity (white, non-Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; other, non-
Hispanic; or Hispanic), and the number of children in the home8. An-
nual household income was measured with the midpoint value of 26
categories that ranged from less than $5,000 to over $300,000. We also
adjust for the type of intended child care (the mother herself, a relative,
or non-family care), the number of smokers in the home, and the mo-
ther’s pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI). Initiation of prenatal care
is captured with variables that indicate whether she began by week 4,
in weeks 5–8, in weeks 9–12, in weeks 13–15, or in weeks 16–20 of her
pregnancy. Finally, we control for the mother’s enrollment in the Spe-
cial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC), and region of the country (North, South, Midwest, and West).
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics. Mothers were approximately 30
years of age and relatively advantaged: 86% were married, over 80%
obtained some college education, 90% were white, non-Hispanic, and
the annual average household income was $55,000. We disaggregate
the descriptive statistics into 3 groups by breastfeeding intentions and
behavior at two months. Consistent with the literature, breastfeeding
mothers were more advantaged relative to non-breastfeeding mothers.
Notably, mothers who simply intend to breastfeed are also more ad-
vantaged than mothers who do not share this intention, which further
justifies intentions as a potential proxy for positive maternal selection
into breastfeeding.
3.3. Analytic strategy
Our study will first seek to replicate the conventional finding in the
literature that breastfeeding reduces adverse infant health outcomes.
We will then see if this effect persists after accounting for a rich set of
prenatal maternal characteristics, many of which are used in other
studies that seek to address selection on observables. Our main objec-
tive is to directly examine the confounding role of positive maternal
selection, as proxied by prenatal intentions, in the association between
breastfeeding and infant health. If prenatal intentions account for the
protective relationship between breastfeeding and infant health, this
provides new evidence that the benefits of breastfeeding are overstated.
We do not interpret that intentions alone have a causal role in produ-
cing infant health, but rather, the bundle of maternal characteristics

 that are captured with prenatal breastfeeding intentions would be
linked to infant health. Then, we examine how mothers who intend to
breastfeed differ from mothers who do not intend to breastfeed, in
terms of their knowledge of nutritional practices and access to in-
formation.
We hypothesize that the omission of maternal selection likely con-
founds estimates of breastfeeding on infant health. Therefore, we
simply incorporate the prenatal breastfeeding intention measure, which
is a proxy for maternal advantage, into regression models estimating
the association between breastfeeding and infant health. Due to the
count nature of the outcome variables we use negative binomial re-
gression models to examine the effect of early breastfeeding and pre-
natal intentions on infant health9.
We illustrate the importance of including breastfeeding intentions
by first estimating a naïve model. In Eq. (1), which represents Model 1,
Yi represents the health outcome for respondent i’s infant. “Breastfed
Exclusively2m” indicates whether the mother breastfed exclusively at
two months.

In Eq. (4), the coefficients λ1 and λ2 represent the average differ-
ence in the infant health relative to mothers who did not intend to
breastfeed and did not breastfeed. We also perform T-tests to evaluate
the null hypothesis that λ1 and λ2 are equal.
Supplemental analyses evaluate whether exclusive or supplemented
breastfeeding at 6 months is linked with infant health. In the 6 month
models, we expand our analytic strategy to incorporate exclusive
breastfeeding, supplemented breastfeeding, and exclusive formula
feeding. We run the same sequential analysis outlined in Eqs. (1)–(4),
but expand our breastfeeding behaviors to acknowledge that infants
may be both breast and formula fed and to understand if the relation-
ship between maternal advantage and infant outcomes is weakened if
breastmilk is persistently consumed by the infant.
Finally, we examine whether information asymmetries exist be-
tween intending and non-intending mothers. Models 5 and 6 (Eq. (5))
show the statistical relationship between a mother’s prenatal breast-
feeding intentions and her knowledge of dietary contaminants or the
sources of nutritional information she consulted while pregnant. The
prenatal demographic controls are unchanged from the previous ana-
lyses. We used a linear probability model for binary outcomes, and a
negative binomial regression model for count variables.

4.1. Main results
In the tables and the discussion that follows, we present both the
coefficients, which represent the percent change in the health outcome
between the indicator category and the reference group, as well as the
marginal effects, which represent the change in the number of in-
cidents. Recall that the marginal effects are likely an undercount of the
actual change in health outcomes, and therefore represent a particu-
larly conservative estimate. Table 3 presents results from models esti-
mating the associations between breastfeeding and infant health out-
comes. Model 1 (bivariate model) suggests that exclusively breastfed

Coefficients provide the average percent difference in the outcome between the
indicator variable and omitted group. The marginal effect provides the average
difference in the number of reported outcome events between the indicator
variable and omitted group. For example, in the first set of results, a coefficient
of −0.273 implies that exclusively breastfed infants experienced 27.3% fewer
ear infections compared to non-exclusively breastfed babies, while the marginal
effect implies breastfed infants experienced −0.128 fewer ear infections com-
pared to non-exclusively within our sampled timeframe.
Models 2–4 contain controls for mother’s marital or household arrangement,
educational attainment, race, age, household income, WIC status, number of
children in the home, the number of people in the home who smoke, intended
childcare arrangement, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at which mother
started prenatal care, and regional dummies. Variables are described in text

 infants had 27% fewer ear infections (on average 0.128 fewer ear in-
fections), over 56% fewer episodes of RSV (0.038 fewer episodes), and
23% fewer incidents where antibiotics were prescribed (0.18 fewer
antibiotic prescriptions) compared to formula-fed infants. Model 2 adds
the previously described demographic and health covariates to the re-
gression. Even with a full array of controls, the breastfeeding coeffi-
cients are largely unchanged from Model 1. These results are consistent
with prior research linking breastfeeding with improved infant health
(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2012; Ip et al., 2007).
To examine positive maternal selection, we account for prenatal
intentions in Model 3. While the coefficients for exclusive breastfeeding
remain negative, they shrink by approximately half and become sta-
tistically insignificant. The intentions coefficient is comparable to the
magnitude of the breastfeeding coefficient from Models 1 and 2: it is
negatively associated with all health outcomes and statistically sig-
nificant. This suggests that breastfeeding intentions are an important
consideration in estimating the relationship between breastfeeding and
infant health. This set of results also strongly suggests that there is
something important about the “type” of mother who intends to
breastfeed rather than actual breastfeeding that stimulates infant
health, and this latent variable was not fully accounted for by the de-
mographic characteristics employed in Model 2. Maternal breastfeeding
intentions are a unique measure that is independently associated with
infant health, even after controlling for breastfeeding behavior and a
rich set of sociodemographic characteristics.
Model 4 compares three distinct groups of mothers: mothers who
did not intend to breastfeed and did not breastfeed (the omitted group),
mothers who intended to breastfeed and did breastfeed exclusively at
the 2nd month, and mothers who intended to breastfeed but did not
breastfeed exclusively at the 2nd month. An infant born to a mother who
intended and did breastfeed had approximately 35% (or 0.165) fewer
ear infections than infants born to mothers who had no intention of
breastfeeding, but an infant born to a mother who intended and did not
breastfeed had approximately 29% (or 0.136) fewer ear infections
compared to the same omitted group. There is no statistically sig-
nificant difference in ear infections between intending mothers who did
and did not breastfeed.
Next, we examine the RSV outcome. Compared to infants whose
mothers did not breastfeed and did not intend to do so, infants with
mothers who intend and do breastfeed are 83% less likely to have an
episode of RSV in their first year of life (a marginal effect of 0.056 fewer
episodes). The coefficient for infants born to mothers who intended but
did not breastfeed is not significant but suggests a qualitatively large
difference (36% less likely to have an RSV diagnosis, which is 0.024
fewer diagnoses). This substantial percent difference (83% vs 36%) is
likely due to RSV being a rare outcome; only 7% of mothers in our
sample reported RSV.
Finally, we focus on antibiotic usage, and our analysis suggests that
prenatal intentions are negatively linked to incidents of antibiotic use.
The infants whose mothers intended and did breastfeed had 38% fewer
incidents where antibiotics were used, compared to infants of non-in-
tending mothers, while infants whose mothers intended but did not
breastfeed had 40% (or 0.293) fewer incidents where antibiotics were
used compared to infants of non-intending mothers. Both coefficients
are statistically different from the omitted group, but the difference
between breastfeeding and formula-feeding mothers who intended to
breastfeed is insignificant.
4.2. Robustness and specification checks
The AAP and WHO recommend exclusive breastfeeding for 6
months, so we also examined how this longer-term exclusive or sup-
plemented breastfeeding is related to infant health. The results are very
similar (Table C1). Infants who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months
had significantly fewer ear infections, RSV episodes, and incidents of
antibiotic usage even when accounting for a robust set of demographic
controls. Yet again, after adjusting for intentions, the breastfeeding
coefficients shrink and become statistically insignificant. We also limit
the sample of mothers who intended to breastfeed but did not to those
who reported a physiological barrier to breastfeeding (pain, inadequate
milk supply, etc.). This examines a subset of mothers who intended to
breastfeed but did not breastfeed due to factors that are plausibly
exogenous. The results (found in Table D1) are consistent with the main
results. Finally, our main results do not include a measure for maternal
employment. The prenatal module questions regarding employment
suffered from high item-nonresponse and including this variable results
in an additional sample reduction of 13%. Nevertheless, Appendix E
includes a variable for the mother’s prenatal employment, and the re-
sults are robust to its inclusion. We do not include the mother’s post-
natal employment as this could be influenced by infant health (for ex-
ample, if the infant is sick a mother may choose not to work) and is
therefore not an appropriate regressor (Angrist & Pischke, 2009). We
also note that maternal employment is likely highly collinear with other
controls in the model: maternal education, family income, and the
mother’s intended childcare arrangement (herself, a family member, or
institutional care), which mitigates concerns about omitted variable
bias from the omission of maternal employment in the main results.
4.3. Intentions and knowledge gaps
The previous analyses demonstrate that prenatal intentions have a
strong and independent link with infant health regardless of the dura-
tion or exclusivity of breastfeeding. However, simply intending to en-
gage in healthy behaviors should not alone result in better health
outcomes. Our hypothesis is that our measure of breastfeeding inten-
tions is capturing one or more crucial and previously omitted variables
that are difficult to obtain in most types of survey data. Therefore, we
examined one of the underlying mechanisms potentially driving the
association between breastfeeding and infant health: knowledge about
nutrition and diet. In probing the differences between mothers who
intended versus did not intend to breastfeed, we see that there are
significant knowledge gaps (Table 4). Intending mothers were 9.6

Mothers who did not intend to breastfeed are the omitted category. Models
contain controls for mother’s marital or household arrangement, educational
attainment, race, age, household income, WIC status, number of children in the
home, the number of people in the home who smoke, intended childcare ar-
rangement, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at which mother started pre-
natal care, and regional dummies. Variables are described in text
Coefficients in columns 1–4 provide the average percentage point difference in
the likelihood an intending to breastfeed mother has heard of a particular
contaminant, relative to a non-intending to breastfeed mother, all else equal.
For example, intending to breastfeed mothers were 9.6 percentage points (or
21.1%) more likely to report knowing that listeria was a contaminant.
The coefficient in column 5 provides the average percent difference in the
outcome between the indicator variable and omitted group. For example, on
average intending to breastfeed mothers had heard of 18.9% (or 1.52) more
contaminants relative to non-intending to breastfeed mothers, all else equal.

 percentage points (21%) more likely to have heard of listeria, 11.5
percentage points (14.6%) more likely to have heard or mercury, and
6.2 percentage points (21.7%) more likely to have heard of dioxins.
Moreover, intending mothers were also nearly 10 percentage points
(12%) more likely to have heard of any of these contaminants, and they
had heard of 18% more contaminants on average (on average, mothers
had heard of 1.52 contaminants).
We next analyze where expectant mothers obtained information
about their prenatal diet and their baby’s diet. Table 5 suggests that
intending mothers have more points of information regarding both their
own diet and their baby’s feeding. The top panel of Table 5 relates to
the mother’s information sources for her own diet. Intending mothers
are 7.3 percentage points (15.3%) more likely to obtain information
from a relative and 10 percentage points (31%) more likely to obtain
information from a print source. Furthermore, they are 4.8 percentage
points (5.3%) more likely to have consulted any of the sources asked
about in the survey, and they had consulted 20.6% more sources of
information on average (on average, mothers had consulted 1.86
sources).
Similarly, when seeking information about their baby’s feeding,
intending mothers were 5.4 percentage points (9.4%) more like to have
consulted a medical professional’s advice, 3.6 percentage points
(14.9%) more likely to have obtained information from a WIC re-
presentative, 9.7 percentage points (14.9%) more likely to have re-
ceived advice from a relative, and 13 percentage points (37.4%) more
likely to have obtained information from a print source. We also note
that intending mothers obtained information from an average of 32.8%
more sources than non-intending mothers.
These results are likely a conservative estimate of the informational
disparities between intending and non-intending mothers. For example,
it is likely that a mother who sought advice from a medical professional
may have had several conversations with her provider throughout her
pregnancy, but the binary nature of the variable essentially “top codes”
at 1. Each interaction may have yielded increased knowledge and
confidence about dietary practices. Notably, mothers who did not ob-
tain information from a particular source entered their third trimester
of pregnancy without ever doing so.
Finally, it is important to state that these coefficients represent de-
scriptive differences in the average outcomes between intending and
non-intending mothers. As all of the measures were collected in the
prenatal module, we cannot establish a temporal ordering of events.
Therefore, we do not know if the mother sought out information from a
particular source and that increased her desire to breastfeed, if she
intended to breastfeed and therefore sought out information to help
with that process, or if there are other variables that influence both of
these processes. We therefore rely on a descriptive interpretation which
simply states that on average there are differences between intending
and non-intending mothers, and in many cases the difference is statis-
tically significant.
5. Discussion and conclusion
The slogan “breast is best” has been popularized by public health
campaigns and is deeply internalized by medical professionals, policy-
makers, and parents. However, the benefits of breastfeeding may be
partially or wholly attributed to the type of mother who intends to
breastfeed. To shed light on if and how estimates are confounded by
previously omitted positive maternal selection, we evaluated the role of
prenatal breastfeeding intentions in the link between breastfeeding and
infant health. We examined a heretofore overlooked group of mo-
thers—those who intended to breastfeed but did not.
Our study yielded two central findings. We were able to replicate
findings from prior research that linked breastfeeding with positive
infant health outcomes (Ip et al., 2007), and this finding persisted even
when controlling for a rich set of observable characteristics. However,
the inclusion of the prenatal intentions variable fully accounted for this
initial association. Mothers who intended to breastfeed but did not
actually breastfeed had infants with statistically equivalent ear infec-
tions, RSV episodes, and incidents of antibiotic usage in the first year of
life compared to infants who were breastfed. It is particularly striking
that prenatal intentions were strongly linked with infant health irre-
spective of whether the infant was actually breastfed. This indicates
that the omission of this variable from models quantifying the “effect”
of breastfeeding on infant health outcomes make breastfeeding appear
overly protective, and further suggests the importance of accounting for
maternal advantage in future research. This finding is consistent with a
growing body of literature suggesting that the benefits of breastfeeding
are overstated due to positive maternal selection bias (Colen & Ramey,
2014; Der et al., 2006; Evenhouse & Reilly, 2005).
We stress that the attendant policy prescription is not to promote
breastfeeding intentions. Rather, it is to understand how intending and
non-intending mothers differ. We therefore evaluated the link between

 breastfeeding intentions and self-reported prenatal and infant dietary
knowledge, which yielded our second key finding: women who in-
tended to breastfeed had greater knowledge about prenatal nutritional
recommendations, and accessed more sources of information about
prenatal and infant nutrition compared to their non-intending coun-
terparts. This suggests that limited knowledge is one potential me-
chanism that accounts for the increased likelihood of adverse health
outcomes among infants whose mothers did not intend to breastfeed
and those whose mothers did. Logical next steps include understanding
whether other information gaps exist and creating systems to address
the needs of non-intending mothers and their infants.
Our study is not without limitations. Respondents in the IFPS II and
our analytic sample are more advantaged than the baseline sample (see
Table A1), and more likely to breastfeed than the national average,
which is an important consideration when interpreting results. In some
respects, this study re-examines the effect of breastfeeding on the in-
fants of relatively advantaged children, and once a mother’s prenatal
intentions are controlled for, the purported benefits of breastfeeding
diminish for this group. Our study implicitly assumes that breastfeeding
has a similar effect across all populations, but differential effects are
possible. For instance, breastfeeding may be more or less protective
among relatively disadvantaged populations with fewer economic re-
sources, but the relative homogeneity of our sample does not allow us
to explore this question. This represents an avenue for future research.
We also note that if a mother intends to breastfeed, she may engage
in a host of healthy behaviors during her pregnancy – including those
that could ward off infections and help her child during fetal devel-
opment. She may also seek out more supportive environments, or
simply engage more with healthcare providers. Mothers who intend to
breastfeed but are unable to actualize those intentions may further
engage in compensating behaviors to overcome any perceived or real
disadvantages of not breastfeeding. For example, if a mother with a
high level of knowledge about healthy behaviors is unable to breast-
feed, she may compensate in other ways, such as using specialized
formula or homemade baby food, to bolster her infant’s health. We do
not know the extent to which either of these (or other) scenarios occurs
among the mothers in our sample, and though these endogenous
measures would not be appropriate controls in our models, these po-
tential health pathways are important considerations for future re-
search. If compensating behaviors do exist and are the mechanism by
which infants of intending, non-breastfeeding mothers have infants
with similar health outcomes to breastfed babies, it would be important
to raise awareness of these substitutes among the health community
and among mothers who do not wish to or are unable to breastfeed.
We provide a preliminary- though important- examination re-
garding the informational differences that might explain the link be-
tween intentions and infant health. If intending mothers have access to
more and higher quality health information, then it is no surprise that
their children have fewer adverse health events. It further demonstrates
that the relationship between breastfeeding and infant health may be
explained by other factors. A more in-depth analysis of the mechanisms
that link intentions with health outcomes deserves future consideration.
Taken together, our findings help to contextualize the finding that
“breast is best,” and add nuance to a body of literature on the benefits of
breastfeeding for infant health. Although we do not dispute that
breastmilk is an excellent source of nutrition, our results suggest that
formula offers similar health benefits for our relatively advantaged
sample of infants, once we take prenatal intentions into account.
Policymakers and health professionals wishing to promote infant health
should consider remedying maternal – and likely other environmental –
disadvantage.

 Appendix D. Dropping mothers without a physiological barrier to breastfeeding
see Appendix Table D1.
Mothers may not realize their prenatal breastfeeding intentions for a host of reasons – some of which are likely exogenous to infant health while
others are endogenous. Therefore, we employ a robustness check to limit the sample of mothers who “intended to breastfeed but did not” to those
who reported a physiological barrier to breastfeeding.
We use data from the Month 1 and Month 2 survey waves to determine which mothers experienced a physiological barrier to breastfeeding. At
the infant’s first month of life (Month 1 Wave), mothers were asked, “Did you have any of the following problems breastfeeding your baby during
your first 2 weeks of breastfeeding?” If a mother responded “yes” to the following reasons, we coded her as having a physiological barrier:
• My baby had trouble sucking or latching on
• My baby choked
• My baby wouldn’t wake up to nurse regularly enough
• My baby was not interested in nursing
• My baby got distracted
• It took too long for my milk to come in
• I had trouble getting the milk flow to start
• My baby didn’t gain enough weight or lost too much weight
• I didn’t have enough milk
• My nipples were sore, cracked, or bleeding
• I had a yeast infection of the breast
• I had a clogged milk duct
• My breasts were infected or abscessed
At the infant’s second month of life (Month 2 Wave), mothers were asked, “How important was each of the following reasons for your decision to
stop breastfeeding your baby?”: (1) Not at all important, (2) Not very important, (3) Somewhat important, or (4) Very important. If a mother
responded somewhat important or very important to the following reasons, we coded her as having a physiological barrier:
Barriers that are repeated from Month 1 Wave:
• My baby had trouble sucking or latching on
• My baby choked
• My baby wouldn’t wake up to nurse regularly enough
• My baby was not interested in nursing

Coefficients provide the average percent difference in the outcome between the omitted group and indicator variable groups. The marginal effect
provides the average difference in the number of reported outcome events between the omitted group and indicator variable groups. For example, in
the first set of results, a coefficient of −0.404 implies that exclusively breastfed infants experienced 40.4% fewer ear infections compared to those who
were never breastfed, while the marginal effect implies exclusively breastfed infants experienced 0.189 fewer ear infections compared to never
breastfed infants within our sampled timeframe. The coefficient of −0.312 implies that infants who received any breastmilk in their first 6 months of
life experienced 31.2% fewer ear infections compared to those who were never breastfed, while the marginal effect implies infants receiving any
breastmilk experienced 0.146 fewer ear infections compared to those who were never breastfed within our sampled timeframe.
Models 2–4 contain controls for mother’s marital or household arrangement, educational attainment, race, age, household income, WIC status,
number of children in the home, the number of people in the home who smoke, intended childcare arrangement, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age
at which mother started prenatal care, and regional dummies. Variables are described in text

 • My baby got distracted
• It took too long for my milk to come in
• I had trouble getting the milk flow to start
• My baby didn’t gain enough weight or lost too much weight
• I didn’t have enough milk
• My nipples were sore, cracked, or bleeding
• I had a yeast infection of the breast
• I had a clogged milk duct
• My breasts were infected or abscessed
New barriers in Month 2 Wave
• My baby became sick and could not breastfeed
• My baby began to bite
• Breast milk alone did not satisfy my baby
• I had trouble getting the milk flow to start
• Breastfeeding was too painful
This robustness check modifies the results presented in Model 4 of the paper. Eq. D1 groups women by their breastfeeding behavior and
intentions to highlight the effect of prenatal intentions on health outcomes. However, unlike the paper, the “Intended, Not Breastfed” group only
includes mothers who stated that they intended to breastfeed, did not breastfeed, and reported one of the above described physiological barriers in
waves 1 or 2. The coefficients λ1 and λ2 represent the average difference in the infant health relative to mothers who did not intend to breastfeed and
did not breastfeed. We also perform T-tests to evaluate the null hypothesis that λ1 and λ2 are equal.

Coefficients provide the average percent difference in the outcome between the indicator variable group and omitted group. The marginal effect provides
the average difference in the number of reported outcome events between the indicator variable and omitted group. For example, in the first set of results, a
coefficient of −0.282 implies that exclusively breastfed infants experienced 28.2% fewer ear infections compared to those who were not exclusively
breastfed, while the marginal effect implies breastfed infants experienced 0.158 fewer ear infections compared to those who were not exclusively breastfed
within our sampled timeframe
Models 2-4 contain controls for mother's marital or household arrangement, educational attainment, race, age, household income, WIC status, number of
children in the home, the number of people in the home who smoke, intended childcare arrangement, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at which mother
started prenatal care, and regional dummies. Variables are described in text
