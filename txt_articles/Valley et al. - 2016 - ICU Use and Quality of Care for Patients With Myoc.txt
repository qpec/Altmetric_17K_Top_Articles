 ICU Use and Quality of Care for
Patients With Myocardial Infarction
and Heart Failure
Thomas S. Valley, MD; Michael W. Sjoding, MD; Zachary D. Goldberger, MD; and Colin R. Cooke, MD
BACKGROUND: Quality of care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF)
varies across hospitals, but the factors driving variation are incompletely understood. We
evaluated the relationship between a hospital’s ICU or coronary care unit (CCU) admission
rate and quality of care provided to patients with AMI or HF.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 2010 with
AMI or HF was performed. Hospitals were grouped into quintiles according to their risk- and
reliability-adjusted ICU admission rates for AMI or HF. We examined the rates that hospitals
failed to deliver standard AMI or HF processes of care (process measure failure rates), 30-day
mortality, 30-day readmissions, and Medicare spending after adjusting for patient and
hospital characteristics.
RESULTS: Hospitals in the lowest quintile had ICU admission rates < 29% for AMI
or < 8% for HF. Hospitals in the top quintile had rates > 61% for AMI or > 24% for HF.
Hospitals in the highest quintile had higher process measure failure rates for some but not all
process
measures.
Hospitals
in
the
top
quintile
had
greater
30-day
mortality
(14.8% vs 14.0% [P ¼ .002] for AMI; 11.4% vs 10.6% [P < .001] for HF), but no differences in
30-day readmissions or Medicare spending were seen compared with hospitals in the lowest
quintile.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals with the highest rates of ICU admission for patients with AMI or
HF delivered lower quality of care and had higher 30-day mortality for these conditions.
Hospitals with high ICU use may be targets to improve care delivery.

 Cardiovascular conditions such as acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF) accounted for
1.6 million hospitalizations and $22 billion in health-
care costs in 2011.1 However, it has been suggested that
approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with these
conditions fail to receive standards of care, known as
process measures, which are often used as surrogates for
quality of care.2-5 The causes of the variation in quality
of care between hospitals remain largely unexplained.2
One potential explanation for the variability in the
quality of care for AMI or HF across hospitals could be
the different locations in the hospital where patients
receive care. Many patients with AMI or HF are
admitted to the ICU or coronary care unit (CCU)
(collectively referred to as ICU hereafter), while others
are cared for on the general or telemetry ward, as
universal guidelines for triage do not exist.6,7 Although
there are many reasons why some hospitals utilize the
ICU more frequently than others,8-10 understanding the
relationship between ICU use and overall quality of care
may provide additional insights as to how hospitals can
deliver optimal care for hospitalized patients.11,12
The goal of the present study was to investigate the
relationship between ICU admission rates for AMI or
HF, process measure failure rates, and patient outcomes.
Process measures for cardiovascular conditions include
guideline-recommended administration of medications,
counseling, heart function evaluation, and timely
interventions. Given previous research in pneumonia
processes of care, which showed that hospitals with
higher ICU admission rates failed to provide appropriate
processes of care and had higher 30-day mortality,11 we
hypothesized that similar findings would be present in
AMI and HF.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study of all acute care
hospitalizations among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged $
65 years by using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file from
2010 linked to mortality data in the Medicare Beneficiary Summary
file. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the 2009 American
Hospital Association’s Annual Survey and the 2010 Healthcare Cost
Reporting Information System. Income was defined according to the
patient’s ZIP code of residence by using 2010 US Census data.
All patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification, primary diagnosis code for AMI
(410.XX, excluding 410.X2) or, in a separate analysis, primary
diagnosis code for HF (402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.03, 404.11,
404.13, 404.91, 404.93, and 428.XX) were included.13,14 These methods
of identifying patients with AMI or HF have been validated with high
sensitivity and specificity.15,16 We excluded patients admitted to
hospitals without ICU capabilities, with < 25 total AMI or HF
admissions, transfers from another hospital, or those discharged
against medical advice.11,17 ICU admission was identified by the
presence of an ICU or CCU revenue center code in the administrative
billing record, excluding intermediate or psychiatric care units.18
Each condition (AMI or HF) was analyzed separately. The study’s
primary exposure variable was the hospital-specific ICU admission
rate for AMI or HF, defined as the proportion of patients admitted
to the ICU of all hospitalized patients with AMI or HF. Hospitals
were assigned to quintiles based on the distribution of ICU
admission rates for each condition.
Process measure information for AMI and HF was obtained from
Hospital Compare for 2010.19 For AMI, process measures included
aspirin on arrival, aspirin on discharge, angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
for left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, smoking cessation
counseling, beta-blocker at discharge, and percutaneous coronary
intervention within 90 min for ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction.
For
HF,
process
measures
included
HF
discharge
instructions, LV systolic function evaluation, ACE inhibitors/ARBs
for LV systolic dysfunction, and smoking cessation counseling. Some
of these process measures have since been replaced, but they were
considered standards of care in 2010. We therefore used the
processes that were in place in 2010 as surrogates for hospital
quality of care at that time.
Mortality was defined as death within 30 days of hospital admission
from any cause. Readmission was defined as hospitalization for any
cause within 30 days of hospital discharge among survivors of AMI
or HF. Payments were defined as the total amount reimbursed by
Medicare to the hospital for a patient’s care.
Statistical Analysis
Hospital-specific ICU admission rates were estimated by using methods
similar to those the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services use to
calculate
risk-
and
reliability-adjusted
hospital
mortality
and
readmission rates.20 This approach controls for any baseline patient
differences between hospitals, and it accounts for the lower reliability
of ICU admission rates for hospitals with few patients.21 Hospitals
with many ICU admissions will have estimates approximating their
actual rate, whereas hospitals with fewer ICU admissions will have
their rates weighted toward the mean ICU admission rate.20,21
Patient and hospital characteristics were compared across quintiles of
risk- and reliability-adjusted ICU admission rates by using c2 tests or
analyses of variance, as appropriate. To evaluate whether ICU
admission rates were associated with process measure failure rates for
AMI or HF at the hospital level, we used multivariable linear
regression; ICU admission rate quintile was entered as the exposure
variable and process measure failure rate as the outcome, with robust
SEs. Comparisons across quintiles after model estimation were
performed by using the Wald test. Process measure data were available
only at the hospital level. To estimate the relationship between quintile
of ICU admission rate and the patient-level outcomes of 30-day
mortality, 30-day readmission, and Medicare spending, generalized
estimating equations were used with robust SEs and a logit (30-day
mortality and 30-day readmission) or identity (Medicare spending)
link. Adjusted absolute rates were estimated by using predictive
margins across quintiles of hospital ICU admission rate.
Models adjusted for patient characteristics, including age, sex, race, and
preexisting comorbidities according to Elixhauser et al.22 Facility-level
risk adjustment included hospital type (nonprofit, for-profit, or

 government), hospital size according to number of beds, proportion of
ICU beds according to total beds, teaching status (high, low, or none
[defined by membership in the college of teaching hospitals]),
proportion of Medicaid patients, hospital nursing ratio (number of
full-time
equivalent
nurses
divided
by
total
patient-days
in
thousands), and proportion of nonwhite patients.23,24
Data management and analysis were performed by using SAS
version
9.3
(SAS
Institute,
Inc)
and
Stata
13.1
(Stata
Corporation). All tests were two-sided, with a P value < .05
considered significant. The Institutional Review Board for the
University of Michigan approved the study and provided a waiver
of consent (HUM00053488).
Results
A total of 157,033 acute care hospitalizations for AMI were
identified at 1,686 hospitals, of which 72,827 (46%)
received care in an ICU (e-Fig 1). We identified 421,165
acute care hospitalizations for HF at 2,199 hospitals, of
whom 67,823 (16%) received care in an ICU. After risk and

 reliabilityadjustments,the medianhospital ICUadmission
rate was 41.9% (range, 11.3%-90.9%; interquartile range,
29.9%-55.0%) for AMI and 11.3% (range, 2.8%-95.1%;
interquartile range, 7.5%-17.1%) for HF.
Hospitals with the highest ICU admission rates on
average had a lower volume of hospital admissions for
AMI or HF. These hospitals were more often for-profit
hospitals and had greater proportions of ICU beds to
total hospital beds (e-Tables 1, 2, Tables 1, 2). There was
no relationship between hospital size and ICU bed ratio
(r ¼ –0.05). Patients admitted to hospitals with high
ICU use were more likely to reside in lower income ZIP
codes.
After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics,
several factors were associated with greater odds of ICU
admission (Table 3). Hospital factors associated with
increased odds of ICU admission included admission to
nonteaching hospitals, hospitals with a higher
proportion of ICU beds, hospitals with more patients
per nurse, and hospitals with lower volume for either
condition. Patient characteristics associated with
increased odds of ICU admission for both conditions
included male sex and younger age, whereas white race
increased the odds of ICU admission for AMI only.
In an adjusted analysis of the relationship between
process measure failure rates for AMI and a hospital’s
ICU admission rate, hospitals with higher ICU
admission rates more often failed to deliver aspirin on
arrival (P ¼ .02) and provide ACE inhibitors/ARBs for
LV systolic dysfunction (P ¼ .004) (e-Table 3, Fig 1A).
For example, 1.7% of patients in the hospitals with the
highest ICU use did not receive aspirin on arrival
compared with 1.3% in the lowest ICU use hospitals,
and 4.9% of patients in the highest ICU use hospitals
failed to receive ACE inhibitors/ARBs compared with
3.0% in the lowest ICU use hospitals. At the highest
quintile hospitals, 12.0% of patients did not receive
percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 min for
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction compared
with 9.9% of patients at the lowest quintile hospitals; this
result was not statistically significant (P ¼ .06). Quintile
of ICU admission rate was not associated with failure to
deliver aspirin on discharge (P ¼ .39), smoking cessation
counseling (P ¼ .73), or beta-blockers on discharge
(P ¼ .51) (e-Fig 2).
Among the process measures for HF, hospitals in the
highest ICU admission rate quintile more often failed to
perform LV function evaluation (2.5% in highest ICU
use hospitals vs 1.3% in lowest ICU use hospitals;
P < .001), to deliver ACE inhibitors/ARBs for treatment
of LV systolic dysfunction (4.9% vs 3.0%; P < .001), and
provide smoking cessation counseling (2.1% vs 1.1%;
P ¼ .03) (Fig 1B). Quintile of ICU admission rate was
not associated with failure to deliver HF discharge
instructions (P ¼ .13) (e-Fig 2, e-Table 3).
After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics,
there was a statistically significant increase in 30-day
mortality rates across the quintiles of ICU admission rate
for AMI (14.0%-14.8%; P for trend ¼ .002) and HF
(10.6%-11.4%; P for trend < .001) (Table 4). There was no
significant difference in 30-day readmission rates (AMI,
16.7%-17.0% [P for trend ¼ .60]; HF, 22.8%-22.0% [P for
trend ¼ .16]) or Medicare spending across hospital

Discussion
The present study shows the wide variability across
hospitals in the use of the ICU for elderly patients with
AMI or HF. Hospitals with the highest ICU admission
rates reported worse adherence to several process
measures and higher 30-day mortality rates for both
AMI and HF, with no significant differences in 30-day
readmission rates or Medicare spending.
Our analysis builds on the findings of several previous
studies assessing ICU utilization and outcomes for HF
and AMI.14,25-27 Safavi et al14 assessed variation in ICU
admission practices between hospitals for HF, assessing
in-hospital mortality and interventions, and found that
hospitals vary widely in ICU utilization with no
differences in outcomes. The present study focused on an
older population and evaluated associations between ICU
admission rates and quality measures. Stolker et al28
showed that ICUs with low annual AMI volume had
higher mortality and provided less evidence-based
therapies. Our study looked at a hospital’s ICU admission
rate and found that hospitals with the highest ICU
admission rates had the lowest annual AMI volume.
Similarly to Stolker et al, these low-volume, high ICU use
hospitals had greater 30-day mortality and failed to
provide guideline-based process measures for AMI.
A number of variables have been associated with ICU
use and outcomes. Lower volume of AMI or HF
admissions has previously been associated with worse
outcomes,28,29 and hospitals that used the ICU
frequently in the present study tended to have lower
annual AMI or HF volume, perhaps utilizing the ICU
due to a lack of familiarity in caring for such patients.
Furthermore, increased ICU bed availability has been
associated with higher ICU admission rates.30,31
Hospitals in the present study with a greater proportion
of ICU beds were more likely to admit patients with
AMI or HF to the ICU. In addition, the presence of
certain hospital characteristics such as intermediate
care32 or cardiology specialty wards33 may be more
commonly found in larger teaching hospitals, which
could also affect ICU admission rates.
Although many factors have previously been associated
with ICU utilization,9 we showed that a hospital’s
quality of care for AMI or HF was also associated with
ICU use. Further research is necessary to determine the
mechanisms underlying this relationship. For example,
hospital inexperience with a given condition may result
in both poor overall quality of care and higher ICU
admission rates for that condition.
The present study should be interpreted in the context of
several limitations. First, although previously validated
definitions were used, our approach may have
improperly identified patients with AMI or HF.15,16
Second, risk adjustment was performed by using
available administrative claims, which, if inadequate,
may have introduced bias.34 For instance, administrative
claims may miss important clinical variables or
imperfectly capture severity of illness; however, we used
risk adjustment models similar to those used by the

 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Third, we
were unable to determine the time between admission to
the hospital and to the ICU, a factor that may provide
additional insight toward why the ICU is being utilized.
Fourth, we assessed quality of care aggregated for the
hospital and cannot differentiate between quality of care
provided in various areas of the hospitals (eg, between
the ICU, the CCU, and the general or telemetry ward).
In addition, a previous study35 showed that larger
hospitals had greater proportions of ICU beds to total
hospital beds. Our study failed to confirm this
relationship, as there was no correlation between
hospital size and ICU bed ratio. Finally, we assessed
adherence to process measures that were recommended
in 2010; however, since then, some of these process
measures have been removed from guidelines while
others have been added.19 The process measures studied
were considered standards of care in 2010, however, and
we therefore used them as surrogates of hospital quality
at that time. The most common reason for removal was
the lack of meaningful difference in performance
between providers, suggesting little opportunity for
improvement. In the present study, most quality
measure adherence rates were > 95% at most hospitals.
Thus, the quality measures we analyzed may not
precisely capture variation in quality across hospitals.
However, these process measures were accepted as
standards to measure hospital quality as they were
endorsed by the National Quality Forum, were used in
pay-for-performance programs, and were publicly
reported.
The present study has important implications for
clinicians and health policy makers. The association
between higher ICU admission rates and worse quality
of care for patients with AMI or HF suggests that
additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms
that link ICU admission with quality of care. By
identifying hospitals that provide worse quality of care
to patients, more resources may be devoted to
recognizing gaps and enhancing care. This study
underscores the need to understand the reasons why
hospitals use the ICU, independent of a patient’s severity
of illness, to improve quality of care.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that, on average, hospitals with the
highest ICU use for AMI or HF were less likely to
provide accepted standards of care and had higher
mortality rates than hospitals with the lowest ICU use.
High ICU use hospitals may be targets to improve care
delivery.
