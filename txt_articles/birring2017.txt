Summary
Background Cough can be a debilitating symptom of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and is difficult to treat. 
PA101 is a novel formulation of sodium cromoglicate delivered via a high-efficiency eFlow nebuliser that achieves 
significantly higher drug deposition in the lung compared with the existing formulations. We aimed to test the 
efficacy and safety of inhaled PA101 in patients with IPF and chronic cough and, to explore the antitussive mechanism 
of PA101, patients with chronic idiopathic cough (CIC) were also studied.
Methods This pilot, proof-of-concept study consisted of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 
patients with IPF and chronic cough and a parallel study of similar design in patients with CIC. Participants with IPF 
and chronic cough recruited from seven centres in the UK and the Netherlands were randomly assigned (1:1, using a 
computer-generated randomisation schedule) by site staff to receive PA101 (40 mg) or matching placebo three times 
a day via oral inhalation for 2 weeks, followed by a 2 week washout, and then crossed over to the other arm. Study 
participants, investigators, study staff, and the sponsor were masked to group assignment until all participants had 
completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in objective daytime cough frequency 
(from 24 h acoustic recording, Leicester Cough Monitor). The primary efficacy analysis included all participants who 
received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement. Safety analysis 
included all those who took at least one dose of study drug. In the second cohort, participants with CIC were randomly 
assigned in a study across four centres with similar design and endpoints. The study was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02412020) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT Number 2014-004025-40) and both 
cohorts are closed to new participants.
Findings Between Feb 13, 2015, and Feb 2, 2016, 24 participants with IPF were randomly assigned to treatment groups. 
28 participants with CIC were enrolled during the same period and 27 received study treatment. In patients with IPF, 
PA101 reduced daytime cough frequency by 31·1% at day 14 compared with placebo; daytime cough frequency 
decreased from a mean 55 (SD 55) coughs per h at baseline to 39 (29) coughs per h at day 14 following treatment with 
PA101, versus 51 (37) coughs per h at baseline to 52 (40) cough per h following placebo treatment (ratio of least-squares 
[LS] means 0·67, 95% CI 0·48–0·94, p=0·0241). By contrast, no treatment benefit for PA101 was observed in the CIC 
cohort; mean reduction of daytime cough frequency at day 14 for PA101 adjusted for placebo was 6·2% (ratio of LS 
means 1·27, 0·78–2·06, p=0·31). PA101 was well tolerated in both cohorts. The incidence of adverse events was 
similar between PA101 and placebo treatments, most adverse events were mild in severity, and no severe adverse 
events or serious adverse events were reported.
Interpretation This study suggests that the mechanism of cough in IPF might be disease specific. Inhaled PA101 
could be a treatment option for chronic cough in patients with IPF and warrants further investigation.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive life-
threatening disease with a median survival of 3–5 years.1 
The prevalence of IPF in the USA has been estimated to be 
42·7 per 100 000 people.2 Cough in IPF is often debilitating 
and is usually refractory to medical therapy.3–5 The 
prevalence of cough in IPF has been reported to be 80%, 
and it is an independent predictor of disease severity, time 
to death, or need for lung transplantation.3,6
Mast cells are thought to be important in the patho-
genesis of both cough and IPF.7,8 Sodium cromoglicate is 
used for maintenance treatment of allergic asthma and 
indolent systemic mastocytosis. The mechanism of action 
of the drug is not known, but it is believed to have 
pleotropic effects.9,10 Historically, cromoglicate’s activity 
has been attributed to inhibition of mast cell degranulation 
and the consequential inhibition of mast cell-mediated 
immune activation.9,11 Cromoglicate has been reported to 
reduce C-fibre sensory nerve activity via an orphan 
G-protein coupled receptor, GPR35.12 Furthermore, 
GPR35 has been described as a target for cromoglicate 
and is expressed on immune cells and small diameter 
sensory neurons.13–15 Previously approved formulations of 
inhaled sodium cromoglicate are thought to achieve low

lung deposition because of their low concentration and 
inefficient delivery devices.16 PA101 is a novel high-
concentration formulation of sodium cromoglicate with 
osmolality and pH adjusted to a physiologically tolerable 
range, delivered via a high-efficiency electronic nebuliser, 
eFlow (PARI, Grafelfing, Germany).
This pilot, proof-of-concept study investigated the 
safety and efficacy of inhaled PA101 on objective cough 
frequency and cough-specific quality of life in a random-
ised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients 
with IPF and chronic cough. To explore the mechanism 
of chronic cough and the antitussive activity of PA101, we 
did a parallel study of similar design in patients with 
chronic idiopathic cough (CIC).
Methods
Study design and participants
In the first of our two cohorts, we did a multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, 
crossover trial in participants with IPF across seven 
centres in the UK and the Netherlands. The diagnosis of 
IPF was made by consensus of a multidisciplinary team 
based on the presence of definitive or possible usual 
interstitial pneumonia pattern on high-resolution CT and 
after exclusion of alternative diagnoses (such as lung 
diseases associated with environmental and occupational 
exposure, connective tissue diseases, and drug therapy). 
Chronic cough was defined as cough of greater than 
8 weeks’ duration that was not responsive to targeted 
therapies for possible underlying triggers (gastro-
oesophageal reflux, asthma, and rhinitis). Participant 
inclusion criteria were age 40–79 years, daytime cough 
severity at least 40 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS), 
mean daytime objective frequency of 15 coughs or more 
per h as measured with the Leicester Cough Monitor, 
carbon 
monoxide 
transfer 
capacity 
corrected 
for 
haemoglobin more than 25% of predicted value within 
12 months, and forced vital capacity (FVC) more 
than 50% of the predicted value within 1 month.
Participant exclusion criteria were presence of signifi-
cant coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction within 
6 months or unstable angina within 1 month), upper or 
lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks, productive 
cough, acute exacerbation of IPF within 3 months, long-
term daily oxygen therapy (>10 h per day) and pulmonary 
arterial 
hypertension 
with 
limitation 
of 
activity. 
Participants who had taken the following medications 
within 2 weeks of the start of the study were also excluded: 
prednisone, narcotic anti 
tussives, gabapentin, inhaled 
corticosteroids, dextromethorphan, pentoxyverine, H1 
antihistamines, and sodium cromoglicate. Antifibrotic 
therapy (ie, pirfenidone or nintedanib) was allowed during 
the study provided that participants had taken a stable 
dose for at least 3 months before study start and remained 
on stable doses during the study. All eligible participants 
provided written informed consent.
A second cohort consisting of participants with CIC 
was investigated across four centres with the same 
study design and assessments. Participants with CIC 
who were unresponsive to targeted treatment for 
identified underlying triggers (ie, postnasal drip, 
asthmatic or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis,

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Chronic cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has a 
significant negative impact on the quality of life of patients, 
is usually refractory to medical therapy, and is a marker of 
disease progression. There are currently no approved drugs for 
the treatment of IPF cough. We did a general search on PubMed 
on Jan 31, 2017, using the search terms “IPF cough and clinical 
trials”. No date or language restrictions were applied. There has 
been only one randomised placebo-controlled trial for IPF 
cough, which was a single-centre study conducted in 20 patients 
with thalidomide. Thalidomide significantly improved 
cough-related quality of life, but was poorly tolerated.
Added value of this study
This is a randomised placebo-controlled multicentre trial of a 
novel formulation of sodium cromoglicate (inhaled PA101) for 
the treatment of IPF cough. We did a parallel study of similar 
design in patients with chronic idiopathic cough (CIC) to 
explore the mechanism of cough and the potential of PA101. 
Treatments were delivered via a high efficiency nebuliser over 
14 days. Treatment with PA101 in IPF was associated with a 
significant reduction in both objective daytime and 24 h cough 
frequency compared with placebo. PA101 was well tolerated, 
with adverse events comparable to placebo. By contrast no 
treatment benefit was observed for PA101 in patients with CIC.
Implications of all available evidence
The mechanism of cough in IPF appears to be disease specific. 
Inhaled PA101 might offer a treatment option for chronic 
cough in IPF. Future studies need to investigate dose 
response, treatment duration, and any potential effect on 
disease progression.

and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) were enrolled. 
Participant inclusion criteria were age 18–75 years, 
daytime cough severity 40 mm or more on VAS, daytime 
objective cough frequency 15 coughs or more per h, and 
no use of other antitussive medications within 2 weeks 
of the study start. Exclusion criteria were similar to 
those for the IPF cohort.
Ethics approval was granted by Liverpool Central/UK, 
reference number 14/NW
/1405, and METC Isala Zwolle 
and METC Erasmus Medical Center/Netherlands.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly allocated to PA101 40 mg or 
identical matching placebo (manufactured by Holopack 
GmbH, Sulzbach, Germany) three times per day via 
oral inhalation for 14 days (plus or minus 1 day) in a 
1:1 ratio to one of two sequences (PA101 40 mg in 
treatment period 1, identical matching placebo in 
treatment period 2; placebo in treatment period 1, 
PA101 40 mg in treatment period 2) using a computer-
generated randomisation schedule (generated by 
Perceptive Partner Program at PAREXEL International, 
Uxbridge, UK) by site staff, who were also involved in 
study assessments during the study. The random 
assignment was stratified by cohort (IPF, CIC), and a 
block size of four was used in each of the two strata. 
There was a washout period of 14 days (plus or minus 
2 days) between the two treatment periods (figure 1). 
Study participants, investigators, study staff, and the 
sponsor remained masked to the randomisation 
scheme until the blind was formally broken after all 
participants completed the study.
Procedures
Both the active and placebo treatments were administered 
with the eFlow high-efficiency nebuliser. The eFlow is 
a single-patient, multi-use, portable, silent, battery-
operated, electronic nebuliser that uses a vibrating mesh 
membrane to generate smaller particle aerosol, which 
allows for more targeted and homogeneous deposition of 
drug in the lung compared with a general-purpose 
nebuliser.17,18
Each participant attended a screening visit within 
14 days of the start of the study to undergo eligibility 
assessments that included medical history, physical 
examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and blood 
and urinary laboratory assessments. The cough monitor 
was attached in the morning for 24 h during pre-
treatment (day –1), day 7, and day 14 visits for 
assessment of efficacy. All participants had a safety 
follow-up call within 7 days after the last study 
treatment.

Outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome for both IPF and CIC 
cohorts was the change from baseline in daytime cough 
counts per h. The 24 h and night-time cough frequencies 
were also assessed. Daytime was defined as the period 
between the time the participant reported they were 
awake in the morning and the time they went to bed. 
Cough frequency was assessed from 24 h recorded with 
the Leicester Cough Monitor, a validated, objective, semi-
automated, ambulatory cough monitoring device.19–21 
Patient-reported secondary efficacy outcomes were 
cough-specific quality of life as measured by the Leicester 
Cough Questionnaire (LCQ)22 and cough severity as 
measured by VAS (0–100 mm). The LCQ is a validated 
19-item cough-specific health-related quality of life 
questionnaire that records overall scores from 3 to 21 
with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. The 
minimal clinically important difference for LCQ is 1·3.23
Exploratory efficacy variables included quality of life 
specific to interstitial lung disease (ILD) as measured by 
the King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (K-BILD) 
Questionnaire,24 pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and 
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) as measured by 
Niox Vero (Circassia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). PFTs were 
done in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society 2005 guidelines.25
The endpoints for IPF and CIC cohorts were similar 
except for the additional secondary endpoint of IPF-
specific quality of life for the IPF cohort, assessed 
with K-BILD. Treatment-emergent adverse events were 
coded according to the MedDRA dictionary version 18.0.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 24 participants would have approximately 
80% power to detect 30% change in daytime cough 
frequency at the 5% statistical significance level with a 
two-sided α error level of 5% in a two-treatment crossover 
study for each study cohort.26 Primary efficacy analysis 
for both IPF and CIC cohorts was based on the intention-
to-treat population (efficacy analysis set), which included 
all participants who received at least one dose of study 
drug and who had at least one post-baseline efficacy 
measure 
ment. An additional analysis was also done in a 
per-protocol population, which included all participants 
who completed both treatment periods and who did 
not have major protocol violations. Safety analysis was 
based on all participants who took at least one dose of 
study drug.
Before analysis of the daytime, night-time, and 24 h 
average cough counts at day 7 and day 14, a log 
transformation was applied at each visit. A mixed-
effects model was used for the change from baseline at 
each visit with sequence, treatment, and period as fixed 
effects, the baseline value as a covariate, and patient 
nested within sequence as a random effect. The percent 
change in cough frequency at day 14 was obtained from 
data from both treatment periods and no statistical 
comparisons were made. No imputation for dropouts 
or missing data for assessments not completed at 
individual visits were done. For the analyses, if any data 
were missing, then the F-tests from PROC MIXED 
were based on Kenward-Roger’s adjusted degrees of 
freedom. Responders were defined as those who had a 
greater than 30% percentage decrease in daytime cough 
frequency from baseline to day 14. All statistical 
analyses were done with SAS software version 9.2.
The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02412020) and the EU Clinical Trials Register 
(EudraCT Number 2014-004025-40).

Results
Between Feb 13, 2015, and Feb 2, 2016, 33 participants 
with IPF were screened and 24 eligible patients were 
randomly assigned. All but two patients completed both 
treatment periods; two patients were withdrawn from the 
study following completion of period 1 and before 
period 2 (figure 2A). The baseline demographics and 
clinical characteristics of randomly assigned patients are 
summarised in table 1. There were no differences in 
the baseline characteristics with respect to treatment 
sequences in both cohorts (appendix). No participant had 
a diagnosis of asthma and all had blood eosinophil 
concentrations at baseline within normal limits 
(<0·5 × 10⁹/L). No patients were taking an angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor. Of 24 total patients, 
13 (54%) were on antifibrotic IPF treatment (pirfenidone 
or nintedanib), 16 (67%) were taking proton-pump 
inhibitor treatment, and none were on H2 antagonist 
therapy.
The efficacy results for the efficacy analysis set and the 
per-protocol population were similar for all variables, so 
only the results for the efficacy analysis set are presented. 
At baseline, there was a significant correlation between 
daytime cough frequency and cough severity (VAS; 
r=0·683, p=0·0003) and cough-related quality of life (LCQ 
total score; r=–0·682, p=0·00002). There was no period 
effect (p=0·28), baseline value effect (p=0·18), or 
treatment sequence effect (p=0·91). Data from combined 
periods 1 and 2 are presented (the data for each treatment 
period are presented in the appendix).
At baseline, mean daytime cough counts for PA101 and 
placebo treatments were similar (55 [SD 55] vs 51 [37] 
coughs per h; figure 3) as were mean 24-h cough counts 
(40 [39] vs 38 [27] coughs per h). Following 14 days of 
treatment with PA101, there was a mean reduction in 
daytime cough frequency at day 14 of 31·1% and 24-h 
cough frequency at day 14 of 29·1% with PA101, when 
adjusted for placebo. The reduction in daytime mean 
cough frequency with PA101 was significant at day 14 
compared with placebo (ratio of least-squares [LS] 
means 0·67, 95% CI 0·48–0·94, p=0·0241; table 2). 
Similarly, the reduction in 24-h mean cough frequency 
with PA101 was significant at day 14 compared with 
placebo (0·68, 0·49–0·95, p=0·0245; figure 4A). Similar 
differences were seen at day 7 for daytime (p=0·0329; 
table 2) and 24-h cough frequency (p=0·0163) in favour of 
PA101 compared with placebo. Nocturnal cough was also

significantly reduced with PA101 at day 7 (0·53, 0·33–0·85, 
p=0·0122), but not at day 14 (0·64, 0·26–1·57, p=0·30).
A clinically meaningful response was defined as a 
reduction in daytime cough frequency greater than 30% 
at day 14 compared with baseline. There were no 
significant differences in patient characteristics between 
those who responded to therapy with PA101 versus 
non-responders (p=0·53 for age, p=0·66 for sex, p=0·58 
for duration of cough, p=0·28 for IPF duration, and 
p=0·37 for proportion of patients taking antifibrotic 
therapy). The percentage of patients with at least a 
30% reduction from baseline in daytime cough frequency 
following PA101 treatment was nearly twice that with 
placebo; eight (35%) of 23 patients taking PA101 
treatment, and four (19%) of 21 patients on placebo 
(figure 5). In patients who responded to PA101, the mean 
reduction in daytime cough frequency was 59%, 
reduction in cough severity VAS was 56%, and improve-
ment in cough quality of life was LCQ 2·3 points. 
No difference in responder rate was observed in patients 
on PA101 treatment with respect to antifibrotic IPF treat-
ments (four of eight responders were on IPF treatment).
There was no significant change in cough-specific 
quality of life (LCQ total score) with PA101 at day 14 
compared with placebo (p=0·09, table 3) or in cough 
severity (VAS score) with PA101 at day 14 compared with 
placebo (p=0·13, table 4). The study sample size was 
powered to detect differences in objective cough 
frequency and was insufficient to detect significant 
differences in subjective cough measures. There was, 
however, a significant correlation between change in 
cough severity (VAS score) and change in daytime cough 
frequency with PA101 at day 14 (r=0·415, p=0·048), 
suggesting that a reduction in cough frequency might 
lead to an improvement in subjective measures. There 
were significant improvements in favour of PA101 
treatment at day 14 compared with placebo in two 
domains of the K-BILD—chest symptoms (p=0·027) and 
psychological symptoms (p=0·032; table 5). There were 
no significant changes from baseline to day 14 in FEV1, 
FVC, and FENO measurements with PA101 or placebo or 
between groups.
28 participants with CIC were enrolled during the same 
period and 27 received study treatments. One patient 
withdrew consent before receiving any study treatment 
following an adverse event (electrocardiogram signs of 
myocardial ischaemia; figure 2B). The baseline demo-
graphics and clinical characteristics are summar 
ised in 
table 1. Daytime cough counts at baseline were 48 (SD 79) 
for the PA101 group and and 44 (35) for placebo. The mean 
reduction in daytime cough frequency was 25·9% with 
PA101 and 19·7% with placebo (6·2% greater mean 
reduction for PA101 when adjusted for placebo). The 
difference between PA101 and placebo treatments was not 
significant using the ratio of LS means for the change from 
baseline in the log-transformed daytime average cough 
count at day 14 (ratio of LS means 1·27, 95% CI 0·78–2·06,

p=0·31; table 2). Similarly, the difference between PA101 
and placebo was not significant using the ratio of LS means 
for the change from baseline in the log-transformed 24-h 
average cough count at day 14 (figure 4B). There were no 
significant differences between PA101 and placebo at day 14 
for the changes in patient-reported subjective endpoints 
(LCQ: 0·5, –0·80 to 1·80, p=0·42; VAS: –0·4, –9·37 to 
8·58, p=0·92; tables 3 and 4).
Treatment with PA101 was well tolerated by the 
participants in both cohorts. The incidence of all adverse 
events was similar for both treatments in both cohorts 
(table 6, figure 2). Most adverse events were mild in severity 
with both treatments, and there were no severe adverse 
events or serious adverse events reported. Disturbance of 
taste was not reported by any participant. In the IPF cohort, 
two patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events: 
one patient during placebo treatment (increased cough and 
dyspnoea), and one patient during PA101 treatment 
(common cold). In the CIC cohort, four patients 
dis 
continued the study due to adverse events: two patients 
during placebo treatment (headache, cough, and oropharyn-
geal pain; dizziness), and two patients during PA101 
treatment (angio-oedema and sinus tachycardia; pharyngeal 
hypoaesthesia, cough, and dyspnoea).
Discussion
This is the first study of the efficacy and safety of inhaled 
PA101 in patients with IPF and chronic cough. There was 
a significant 31% reduction in daytime and 24 h objective 
cough frequency following treatment with PA101 
compared with placebo. PA101 was also associated with 
an improvement in chest symptom and psychological 
domains of ILD-specific quality of life. PA101 was well 
tolerated; the incidence of adverse events was similar to 
placebo, and most adverse events were mild in severity. 
By contrast, no treatment benefit for PA101 was observed 
in patients with chronic idiopathic cough.
We assessed efficacy by assessment of objective cough 
frequency. This approach has several advantages over 
other objective and subjective cough measures; it is not 
susceptible to the patient’s perception of their symptoms, 
and can indicate an improvement in cough earlier than 
subjective measures can.27,28 Cough frequency decreased 
significantly with PA101 following 7 days of therapy, and 
cough frequency continued to reduce at day 14. The 
responder analysis was also consistent with the key finding 
of a reduction in cough frequency. A greater proportion of 
patients had a clinically meaningful reduction in cough 
frequency with PA101 compared with placebo. An analysis 
with differing thresholds for the definition of response was 
also consistent with an improvement in cough favouring 
PA101 compared with placebo (figure 5). The minimal 
clinically important difference for objective cough 
frequency has not been studied, but our finding of a 
30% reduction in cough frequency adjusted for placebo is 
similar to that reported for other antitussive therapies for 
chronic idiopathic cough, such as MK7264 (formerly 
AF-219), a P2X3 receptor antagonist, and physiotherapy 
and speech and language therapy intervention.27,29 
Subjective measures of ILD-specific quality of life im-
proved, favouring PA101 over placebo. The improvement 
in cough-specific quality of life with PA101 approached the

minimal clinically important difference for the LCQ of 
1·3 units.23 No issues relating to the use of eFlow nebuliser 
device were reported by patients. 
The mechanism of cough in IPF and other chronic 
cough conditions is poorly understood.30,31 Cough in IPF 
might be caused by several mechanisms—such as 
inflammation, mechanical stimulation from distorted 
lung, or gastro-oesophageal reflux—which could lead to 
cough reflex hypersensitivity.32–34 Airway inflammation 
has been reported in IPF; for example, increased numbers 
of mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils and their 
mediators have been observed in bronchoalveolar lavage 
and sputum samples from patients with IPF.8,35–39 Mast 
cells are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of 
cough. Degranulated mast cells release mediators such 
as substance P, histamine, serotonin, and proteases that 
activate sensory nerve C fibres.33,34,40 Airway inflammatory 
mediators and increased cough reflex sensitivity to 
capsaicin and substance P have been reported in IPF.34 
Mast cells and their mediators are thought to be 
profibrotic as well as inflammatory.8,41,42 Mast cells are 
found in close proximity to fibroblastic foci in IPF and 
have been reported to stimulate, migrate, proliferate, and 
activate fibroblasts.41–43 One study reported that mast cells 
in IPF can activate phenotypic change in lung fibroblasts, 
causing them to become myofibroblasts that contribute 
to fibrosis.43
Pirfenidone and nintedanib have been approved for the 
treatment of IPF. However, no drugs are currently 
approved for the treatment of cough in IPF. Phase 3 trials 
of pirfenidone reported no antitussive effect,44 although a 
post-hoc analysis reported stabilisation of cough in a 
subset of patients given low-dose pirfenidone.45 A study of 
pirfenidone in IPF cough reported a reduction in cough 
frequency, but this study did not include a control group 
for comparison.46 The only randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial to date in IPF cough has been with 
thalidomide,47 which is known to be anti-inflammatory and 
might also interact with sensory nerves.48,49 In a study of 
20 patients with IPF receiving treatment with thalidomide 
for 24 weeks, there was a significant improvement in 
cough-specific quality of life compared with placebo; 
however, a significant pro 
portion of patients reported 
troublesome side-effects with thalidomide.47 An open-label 
study of oral corticosteroids in six patients with IPF 
reported a significant re 
duction in subjective cough 
scores,34 but some immuno 
suppressive drug combinations 
with oral corticosteroids have failed in treating IPF and 
were not well tolerated by patients.50 In our study, 
participants had been assessed for common causes of 
cough, including asthma, before entering the study. 
Results of an open-label study of six patients with IPF 
receiving the antifibrotic drug interferon gamma reported 
an improve 
ment in cough-specific quality of life.51 An 
open-label trial of a high-dose proton-pump inhibitor plus 
ranitidine for 2 months in IPF reported no improvement 
in objective cough frequency.52
Sodium cromoglicate was the first non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drug approved for asthma in 1973. Its 
use declined following the introduction of inhaled 
corticosteroids. Previous formulations of cromoglicate 
were limited by the poor efficiency of drug delivery 
devices—such as dried powder inhaler, metered dose 
inhaler, or nebulisation via jet nebuliser16—which might 
have led to suboptimal drug deposition in the lung. 
PA101 is a high-concentration formulation of sodium 
cromoglicate, coupled with a high-efficiency nebuliser to 
optimise lung deposition. The combination of PA101 and 
eFlow nebuliser delivers an approximately five to ten 
times higher lung concentration when using systemic 
concentrations of cromoglicate as a surrogate marker.53 
The mechanism of the antitussive effect of PA101 is not 
known. PA101 has the potential to modulate a wide range 
of inflammatory cells and their mediators known to play 
an important role in cough—for example, mast cells, 
eosinophils, neutrophils, and their derivatives.54–56 PA101 
might also modulate airway sensory nerve function. 
Cromoglicate has been reported to reduce C-fibre sensory 
nerve activity.57 A study reported that the effect of 
cromoglicate on sensory nerves is mediated via an 
orphan G-protein coupled receptor, GPR35.12 We did not 
study the possibility that PA101 might modulate the 
underlying disease biology of IPF and reduce disease 
progression; this warrants further investigation with 
higher doses and longer duration of therapy. Cromoglicate 
has the potential to reduce disease progression because 
of its antifibrotic activity. Antifibrotic activity of cromo-
glicate has been reported in lungs, heart, liver, kidney, 
and skin.58–63 The efficacy of cromoglicate in a metered 
dose inhaler formulation has been investigated in a 
small, single-centre study in patients with advanced lung 
cancer with cough, which showed a reduction in cough 
severity compared with placebo following 2 weeks of 
treatment.64
The different results obtained with PA101 in patients 
with IPF compared with individuals with CIC in this 
study suggest that cromoglicate might suppress cough 
selectively in patients with underlying respiratory 
disease. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study 
suggesting that the mechanism of chronic cough might 
be disease specific. In CIC, there is no underlying 
respiratory disease and the potential drivers of cough are 
not clearly defined, whereas in IPF-related cough the 
observation of increased numbers of resident mast cells 
in fibrotic lungs is well established, and an interaction 
between mast cells and the cough reflex might provide 
a mechanistic basis.8,34,43,65,66 The sensory neural innerv-
ation of the distal airways is thought to differ from that of 
the proximal airways, and this might be another reason 
why the efficacy of an antitussive therapy might differ 
between IPF and disorders of the larynx and upper 
airways that are associated with cough.31
Our study has some limitations. We investigated a small 
number of patients, and the study was under 
powered to

assess subjective measures. Our findings need sub-
stantiation in a larger population with a parallel-group 
design. A larger study could also help to establish the 
characteristics of patients that are associated with a 
response to therapy. The duration of treatment in our 
study was brief, and improvements in cough frequency 
and quality of life might have been greater if the therapy 
had been administered for longer. As expected, there 
were differences in distribution of sexes between the 
cohorts, with more men in the IPF cohort and more 
women in the CIC cohort. Cough frequency monitors 
have been used largely in patients with CIC and in 
few studies in IPF. However, a strong correlation between 
objective cough frequency and subjective measures of 
cough, such as the LCQ, has been reported in IPF.4 The 
increase in LCQ scores with PA101 was not significant, by 
contrast with the results for cough frequency. The 
potential reasons for this result are that the study was 
underpowered to detect changes in subjective endpoints, 
and the study duration was too brief to suggest an 
improvement in quality of life. Assessment of cough 
frequency on a daily basis would have been useful to 
establish the onset of efficacy, but wearing a cough 
monitor continuously for 7 days would be burdensome 
for participants so consideration should be given to a 
daily cough-severity diary in future studies. We did not 
assess bronchial hyper-responsiveness at baseline, but a 
diagnosis of asthma is unlikely in our participants since 
none had a diagnosis of asthma and none had raised 
blood eosinophil counts at baseline.
In conclusion, treatment with inhaled PA101 via eFlow 
nebuliser was associated with a significant reduction in 
objective cough frequency in patients with IPF-associated 
chronic cough, but not in patients with CIC. These 
results suggest that the mechanism of cough in IPF is 
disease specific. PA101 was well tolerated and there were 
no severe or serious adverse events. Future studies, in 
particular dose-response studies and longer duration of 
treatment, are planned to assess the potential for inhaled 
PA101 to improve cough in IPF.
