We have previously shown in two randomized clinical trials that environmental enrichment is capable of ameliorating symptoms
of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and in the present study, we determined whether this therapy could be effective under real-
world circumstances. 1,002 children were given daily Sensory Enrichment Therapy, by their parents, using personalized therapy
instructions given over the Internet. Parents were asked to assess the symptoms of their child every 2 weeks for up to 7 months.
An intention-to-treat analysis showed significant overall gains for a wide range of symptoms in these children, including learning,
memory, anxiety, attention span, motor skills, eating, sleeping, sensory processing, self-awareness, communication, social skills,
and mood/autism behaviors. The children of compliant caregivers were more likely to experience a significant improvement in their
symptoms. The treatment was effective across a wide age range and there was equal progress reported for males and females, for
USA and international subjects, for those who paid and those who did not pay for the therapy, and for individuals at all levels of
initial symptom severity. Environmental enrichment, delivered via an online system, therefore appears to be an effective, low-cost
means of treating the symptoms of ASD.
1. Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neu-
rodevelopmental condition, presenting in early childhood in
1 of 45 children in the USA [1], and it appears to arise from
a complex interaction between genetic and environmental
factors [2–4]. Social interaction and communication skills
are impaired in this disorder, and individuals with ASD also
have unusual repetitive behaviors and/or narrow interests.
The condition can persist for life, with major implications
for the individual, the family, and the healthcare system [5].
There are currently limited medical treatments for individuals
with ASD [6], and while there are several behavioral therapies
available for treatment, these programs are inaccessible to
many [7, 8], are often costly [5, 9], are typically less effective
as patients age [10], are not reliably effective [11], and may
address a narrow range of symptoms [12–15]. A treatment
that successfully addresses the limitations of current therapies
therefore would be of great value.
How much can the environment affect the expression
of ASD symptoms? After reviewing the animal literature
regarding the substantial benefits of environmental enrich-
ment for animal models of autism, Reynolds et al. [16] noted
that the key aspects of environmental enrichment appear to
include novel and diverse sensorimotor experiences. They
went on to propose that environmental enrichment might be
a useful means of treating children with autism, presumably
by suppressing the expression of ASD symptoms through
neural compensatory mechanisms that would be evoked by
the environmental stimulation. In other words, the gene x
environment interaction that produced the expression of
autism symptoms may be shifted by changing the environ-
mental input to the children with ASD and thereby reducing
the expression of those symptoms.
To test that hypothesis, we conducted a randomized
clinical trial in which environmental enrichment was given
to 6–13-year-old children with classic autism for 6 months
by their parents [17]. The therapy included about three-dozen

novel sensory exercises that were given to the children in the
morning and evening. The children were assessed at baseline
and after 6 months by the same psychologists who were
unaware of the group assignment of the children. We found
clinically significant improvements in autism symptom sever-
ity in 42% of the children in the enriched group, as revealed
by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, while only 7% of the
standard-care controls experienced such an improvement.
We also reported improved cognition following environmen-
tal enrichment, with enriched children scoring 11.3 points
higher than controls on the objective Leiter International
Performance Scale (Leiter-R) after 6 months of therapy.
In a second randomized clinical trial, environmental
enrichment was used to treat 3–6-year-old children with
classic autism, and their assessments were also completed by
experienced psychologists who were blind to group assign-
ment. Woo et al. [18] again found significant improvements in
the cognitive scores of enriched children over 6 months using
the Leiter-R, with enriched children gaining 8.42 IQ points,
while the standard-care group gained 1.53 points, a statis-
tically significant difference. A significant improvement for
the enriched children was also found in receptive language,
using the Reynell Developmental Language Scales, another
objective test of symptom improvement. Enriched children
gained 7.42 points on the receptive language scale, whereas
the standard-care group had an average increase of 3.63
points on that assessment. Improvements for the enriched
children also outpaced that of controls in the reduction
of abnormal sensory responsiveness, as assessed by their
parents with the Short Sensory Profile [19]. Enriched children
gained 11.36 points on that survey, whereas the standard-care
children improved by 2.85 points. Finally, we found that 21%
of the children who were initially classified as having autism
with the objective Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
fell below the autism classification cutoff using that same test
after six months of environmental enrichment. None of the
children in the standard-care control group improved to that
extent. In both of these studies, standard care included var-
ious combinations of speech therapy, occupational therapy,
Applied Behavioral Analysis, social skills therapy, adapted
physical education, and physical therapy.
We then wanted to determine whether this therapy
could be provided to a large number of individuals with
autism via a telehealth system under real-world conditions.
Indeed, several forms of behavioral therapy have been made
available to relatively small numbers of parents via the
Internet with encouraging outcomes. Parental instruction
for autism behavioral therapies such as Pivotal Response
Training, Applied Behavior Analysis, and the Early Start
Denver Protocol have been made available over the Internet
and these at-home therapies have shown significant improve-
ments in parental confidence and parental treatment fidelity,
as well as improvements in spontaneous imitation skills,
communication skills, problem behaviors, and anxiety in
children with ASD [20–28].
Given the efficacy of environmental enrichment for
treatment of ASD symptom in our randomized clinical trials
and given its potential for increasing access to treatment for
children with ASD, the enrichment therapy has been adapted
for real-world circumstances and made available on the
Internet by Mendability, LLC, as a paid online service, which
has been accredited for the provision of behavioral healthcare
by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations. We set out to determine the efficacy of
environmental enrichment as provided via this telehealth
service. Unlike the therapy used in the two clinical trials, the
therapeutic exercises from this system were individualized,
based upon the specific challenges, age, abilities, and progress
of the children. In addition, while both of the clinical trials
included only children 3–12 years old with classic autism, this
study extended both the range of ages of the subjects who
received the therapy and the range of ASD severity of those
treated by including self-selected individuals across the entire
autism spectrum.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Intervention. All research activities adhered to the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and were in
compliance with its privacy, security, and electronic transac-
tion guidelines. The data set used in the study was stripped of
personal information prior to analysis.
The study was a nonconcurrent single-subject, multiple-
baseline design initiated by a retrospective review of the
behavioral assessments of parents regarding their children
at the start of their treatment and over the course of
their treatment. The individuals who received environmental
enrichment were given instructions for daily exposure to
multiple sensorimotor exercises via customized worksheets
that were generated by the online software after completion of
an extensive questionnaire. As the parents were delivering the
stimulation, there was also an increase in social interactions
for the enriched children. Licensed, experienced occupa-
tional therapists reviewed the worksheets to ensure that the
computer-generated exercises were within the capability of
each subject. These therapists made any adjustments to the
therapy if needed, but such interventions were rare. The
occupational therapists were also available for consultations
with the parents via email, phone, and video over the course
of the therapeutic intervention
Environmental enrichment, in the form of Sensory
Enrichment Therapy, pairs different types of sensory and
motor exercises on a daily basis. Varied textures, such as plas-
tic turf doormats, aluminum foil, sponges, artificial flowers,
adhesive tape, and bubble wrap, were used to stimulate the
sense of touch. For object manipulation, there were beads to
sort and arrange, discs to insert or pull, and rice or toothpicks
to insert into foam or Play-Doh, which was also used to
squeeze and shape. Thermal stimulation came from different
temperatures of water, spoons, or mugs. Visual stimulation
came in the form of fine art, photos, and other images.
Auditory stimulation came in the form of classical music
or sound makers. Proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation
came in the form of various exercises requiring walking or
ascending and descending stairs while carrying an object
overhead. Balance skills were elicited on a raised or angled
beam, and different movements were performed in place with
a blindfold. Pleasant scents provided olfactory stimulation.

A partial list of the exercises available to the children in
this study can be found in previous reports [17, 18]. The
online system selected exercises from a database of more
than 400 different sensory exercises, which allowed a new
individualized therapy worksheet to be developed for each 2-
week period.
The therapeutic exercises were administered once or
twice a day, with each session lasting 10–15 minutes. In addi-
tion, there were 4–6 daily pairings of olfactory stimuli and
gentle tactile stimuli for 30–60 seconds. Every 2 weeks, after
the detailed parental assessments of their child’s symptoms
were completed, the expert system software assigned new
exercises that were delivered in a new worksheet for the next
2-week period. The enrichment therapy was added to any
other therapies in which the child was engaged.
2.2. Assessments. Parents were initially asked to complete an
online assessment with 301 potential questions that probed
the behavioral symptoms associated with autism (a list of
which can be found in the Appendix). Care was given to
avoid questions that could be extracted from higher-level
questions. For example, if the parent reported that the child
had good reading comprehension, the system did not ask if
she/he knew the letters of the alphabet. Furthermore, parents
were presented only age-appropriate questions. For example,
if the parent reported that the child was 3 years old, a question
about reading comprehension would not be presented. The
parents were asked to assess each aspect of their behavior with
these descriptors: 0 = could not be worse, 1 = severe problem,
2 = big problem, 3 = bit of a problem, 4 = maybe a problem,
and 5 = not a problem. A progress bar was displayed for each
question to help the parent set the level of improvement on
the scale.
In the initial assessment, the system presented an average
of 280.46 (SD = 22.43, CI = 279.07–281.85) questions. When-
ever the parent rated a question as “not a problem,” (mean =
153 or 55% of the questions, SD = 48.81, CI = 150–156) or when
the parent was not able to generate an answer to a question for
various reasons (mean = 8 questions or 3% of the questions,
SD = 16, CI = 7–9), those questions were then omitted from
the subsequent questionnaires.
2.3. Participation. 1,002 subjects were recruited to initiate the
treatment, using Google ads, TEDx ads, Facebook ads, and
email messages. They had a mean age of 7.37 years (SD =
3.83, CI = 7.14–7.61) and ranged in age between 1 and 18 years.
There were 796 males and 206 females, 752 of whom were
from the USA, 239 were international residents, and 11 were
of unknown geographic location. There were 835 children
whose parents paid for the therapy and 167 children who
received the therapy at no charge. There were 559 parents who
indicated that their child had received a diagnosis of autism,
41 children who had a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome,
and 30 who had probable autism. In addition, 31 children
were regarded as having pervasive developmental disorder,
18 were regarded as having ADHD, 10 were described as
having global developmental delay, 42 were described as
having other disorders, and there were 271 children whose
parents did not provide a formal diagnosis. However, rather
than focusing on their presumptive diagnoses, we focused
on improvement in the symptoms that were revealed by the
answers to the assessment questions.
2.4. Calculating Composite Score. The parents completed
these questionnaires a mean of 1.75 times each month. The
mean number of questions to which the parents responded
over the course of their participation was 119 questions
at each assessment (SD = 43.54, CI = 116–122). The final
scores were recorded for each individual whenever they
stopped their participation and the change in symptom
severity was then calculated for each subject for all answered
questions in an intention-to-treat analysis. The range of
scores for the individual behavioral components was 0 to
5. The mean of all answered questions was then calculated
for a composite score that characterized the mean change in
symptom severity for each child, as assessed by their parent.
Questions that were not age-appropriate or were initially
answered as “not a problem” or “cannot measure” were not
subsequently presented and were therefore not included in
the calculations. If no assessment was taken in any month, we
interpolated the results by time-weighted averaging between
the last assessment and the next closest assessment. In
addition, we calculated the change in assessments for specific
categories of symptoms: anxiety, attention span, commu-
nication, eating, learning, memory, mood/behavior, motor
skills, self-awareness, sensory processing, sleep, and social
skills. We further clustered those categories into basic skills,
complex skills, and personality traits for analysis. We used
paired t-tests for two sample means to compare symptom
severity before and after Sensory Enrichment Therapy, and
we calculated R2 for evaluating correlations.
3. Results and Discussion
174 participants answered the questionnaire for 1 month, 144
for two months, 81 for 3 months, 65 for 4 months, 79 for 5
months, 59 for 6 months, and 400 for more than 6 months. In
all, we collected more than 650,000 answers to the questions
that are shown in the Appendix, along with the proportion
of subjects who indicated a problem in that area, the mean
initial score, and the mean change in that score at the final
assessment.
Figure 1 shows the correlation of the time spent in
environmental enrichment therapy in months, relative to the
mean difference in the composite score of the participants
from the initiation of the therapy to their final assessment: R2
= 0.14 (𝑝 < 0.05). The mean initial symptom severity score
for all subjects was 2.48 (SD = 0.60, CI = 2.44–2.51) and the
mean final score for all subjects improved to 2.93 (SD = 0.78,
CI = 2.88–2.98; df = 1,001, t = −26.58, 𝑝 < 0.00001). The effect
size should be considered to be large (Cohen’s d = −1.68).
The change in symptom severity as a function of parental
engagement with the therapy, as determined by the number
of sensory exercise worksheets that the parents downloaded,
is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The more assumed parental
engagement, the better outcome for the children (R2 =
0.26, 𝑝 < 0.05). Indeed, only 5.93% (2,036 out of 35,055) of
questions answered by the 295 parents who downloaded 1–3

point on the symptom severity scale, while 46.09% (11,467
out of 24,852) of questions answered by the 217 parents who

(mean = 0.18, SD = 0.34, CI = 0.14–0.22, t = −9.00, df = 294,

had a significantly better outcome than the children of the
noncompliant parents (t = −15.19, df = 309, 𝑝 < 0.00001).
To understand the impact of the passage of time on
symptom severity, we looked at the progress of 93 subjects
whose parents had completed the assessments for 6 or more
months but only downloaded 1–3 worksheets. These data
differ from the analysis above in that we only looked at
those children who had the therapy for at least 6 months,
whereas the above comparison included the outcomes of all
the children in these groups, regardless of the time that they
remained in the study. This noncompliant group had a mean
age of 7.77 (SD = 3.93, CI = 6.96–8.58) and a mean initial
severity of 2.53 (SD = 0.65, CI = 2.40–2.67) and the percent
of questions that were initially marked as “not a problem”
was 54% (SD = 17%, CI = 51%–58%), with mean composite
symptom improvement of 0.24 (SD = 0.35, CI = 0.17–0.31, t
= −6.72, df = 92, 𝑝 < 0.00001). Due to the low compliance
levels, this group likely reflects the improvement of symptoms
over time without significant Sensory Enrichment Therapy,
compared to the 182 subjects whose parents completed
assessments for 6 or more months and downloaded 10 or
more worksheets. That group had similar mean age: 7.46 (SD
= 3.87, CI = 6.89–8.02), similar mean initial severity: 2.45
(SD = 0.57, CI = 2.36–2.53), and similar percent of initial
questions that were marked as “not a problem”: 55% (SD
= 16%, CI = 52%–57%), but they had a mean composite
symptom improvement of 0.91 (SD = 0.63, CI = 0.82–1.00,
t = −19.40, df = 181, 𝑝 < 0.00001). A direct comparison of
these groups showed that the compliant parents had children
who experienced much larger symptom improvements than
the noncompliant parents even when time is kept constant (t
= −11.28, df = 272, 𝑝 < 0.00001).
The change in symptom severity as a function of initial
age is shown in Figures 4 and 5 and there was no statistically
significant difference between these factors. Initial symptom
severity also did not affect the eventual outcomes (Figure 6).

had problems in all areas of concern.

as “not a problem” (mean = 55%, SD = 17%, CI = 53%–56%),
and those who did not pay for the treatment (𝑛 = 167, mean
age = 8.17 years, SD = 4.08, CI = 7.54–8.79), mean initial
severity (mean = 2.47, SD = 0.65, CI = 2.37–2.57) and percent
of questions marked as “not a problem” (mean = 54%, SD
= 17%, CI = 52%–57%). Similarly, there was no significant
difference in improvement between the paying group and the
nonpaying group. The mean change in composite scores was
0.45 (𝑛 = 835, SD = 0.55, CI = 0.41–0.49, t = −23.79, df = 834,
𝑝 < 0.00001) for those who paid and 0.47 (𝑛 = 167, SD = 0.51,
CI = 0.39–0.55, t = −11.90, df = 166, 𝑝 < 0.00001) for those
who did not pay for the treatment.
The progress of those subjects with different reported
diagnoses is shown in Figure 8. Those reported to have
ADHD had a mean improvement in their symptoms of 0.33
(SD = 0.41, CI = 0.13–0.54, t = −3.46, df = 17, 𝑝 < 0.003). Those
described as having Asperger’s syndrome had a significant
improvement in their symptoms (mean improvement = 0.54,
SD = 0.61, CI = 0.34–0.73, t = −5.63, df = 40, 𝑝 < 0.00001),
those with ASD diagnoses improved by 0.47 (SD = 0.58,
CI = 0.43–0.52, t = −19.25, df = 558, 𝑝 < 0.00001), and
those who were regarded as having ASD by the occupational
therapists (coach) improved by 0.70 (SD = 0.46, CI = 0.53–
0.87, t = −8.40, df = 29, 𝑝 < 0.0001). Those with global
developmental delay also benefitted from the treatment,
with a mean composite severity score improvement of 0.56
(SD = 0.77, CI = 0.01–1.11, t = −2.31, df = 9, 𝑝 < 0.05).
Those individuals who were described as having PDD-NOS
improved by 0.33 (SD = 0.36, CI = 0.20–0.46, t = −5.18, df
= 30, 𝑝 < 0.0001). Subjects without a reported diagnostic
category improved by 0.39 (SD = 0.46, CI = 0.33–0.44, t =
−13.69, df = 270, 𝑝 < 0.00001) and those who were regarded
as being in a variety of diagnostic categories improved by 0.47
(SD = 0.44, CI = 0.33–0.60, t = −6.95, df = 41, 𝑝 < 0.00001).
3.1. Treatment Outcomes. Environmental enrichment in the
form of Sensory Enrichment Therapy, provided through an
online portal, appears to be effective in supporting a broad
range of symptomatic improvements in individuals with ASD
over a wide range of ages and symptom severity, as well as
across geographic locations, and for both genders. There was
also a significant association between treatment compliance
and therapeutic effectiveness.
The online treatment effects even appear to be stronger
than what was observed in the randomized clinical trials,
where the treatment effects based on Cohen’s d for the
standardized mean difference for the within-subject change
on the Leiter, Short Sensory Profile, and Reynell Receptive
Language assessments were 0.54, 0.51, and 0.45, respec-
tively [18], outcomes that should be regarded as produc-
ing medium/large effects. The magnitude of the effect for
improvement in composite scores using the online system
for all participants was 1.68, a large effect. The improvement
in effect size over the randomized clinical trials, all things
being equal, raises the possibility that the personalized
sensorimotor exercises used in the online system may have
been superior to the standardized exercises that were used
in the randomized clinical trials. The advice and guidance of
occupational therapists also may have contributed to the effi-
cacy of the online system. Parents may also have been hopeful
for a positive outcome for their child and that hope may
have been reflected in their assessments. It will be important,
therefore, to conduct a further study to test children treated
with the online system with objective, validated assessments.
The outcomes in this study compare well with other
parent-mediated therapies, particularly for those therapies
geared for children and adolescents [29–34]. Moreover,
environmental enrichment appears to benefit both core ASD
symptoms and symptoms that are typically comorbid with
autism [35, 36]. Indeed, 92% of children with ASD have at
least two cooccurring mental health problems [37].
It is also of interest that children who were at different
levels of symptom severity at the initiation of the therapy were
able to benefit equally from this therapeutic approach. Simi-
larly, both males and females benefitted from this approach
to the same extent. Perhaps the most compelling finding
is that older individuals benefitted to the same extent as
younger subjects. Given that standard-care interventions are
typically effective principally for young children [10, 38, 39],
it is encouraging to have a therapy that is effective over a wide
range of ages.
3.2. Sensory Impairment and ASD. We have again shown
that enhanced sensorimotor experiences appear to ameliorate
ASD symptoms. Conversely, it also appears that a degradation
of sensory experiences may increase the risk of autism. For
example, congenitally blind children have a 42% elevated
probability of having an ASD diagnosis [40]. Even children
with less serious ophthalmic problems have a 19% elevated
risk of ASD [41]. Indeed, 69% of children with ASD were
reported to have abnormal visual acuity [42]. Individuals
 Neural Plasticity
7
with autism also have deficits in visual motion processing,
as assessed by fMRI responses, which accompany deficits
in both primary visual cortex and extrastriate cortex [43].
Similarly, visually evoked electrophysiological potentials
reveal neural responses early in the visual pathway that are
compromised in individuals with ASD [44].
It is also the case that degradation of auditory stimulation
is associated with an increased risk of ASD. Up to 7% of deaf
children are diagnosed with ASD [45, 46] and 10% of individ-
uals with ASD were reported to have hearing problems [47].
M¨
obius syndrome typically involves both hearing loss
and visual difficulties, and 45% of these children are diag-
nosed with ASD [48, 49]. The congenital oculo-auriculo-
vertebral spectrum disorder also involves loss of vision and
audition and 42% of those individuals are given an ASD
diagnosis [50]. Furthermore, 68% of children with CHARGE
syndrome have ASD diagnoses, which involves an even
greater multisensory loss (hearing, olfaction, and vision) [51,
52]. Sensory loss therefore is associated with an increased risk
of the expression of ASD symptoms and greater sensory loss
is associated with a higher ASD risk.
Individuals with ASD also have problems integrating
multisensory information into a single percept [53–56]. Using
diffusion tensor imaging fiber tractography, Chang et al. [57]
evaluated the structural connectivity of white matter tracts in
individuals with ASD and they found that they had decreased
connectivity relative to controls in parietooccipital tracts
involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration.
Since the loss of sensory stimulation due to neural
anomalies or damage to sensory systems is associated with
the increased expression of ASD symptoms, it seems possible
that environmental restriction of sensory stimuli would have
a similar effect. Indeed, a significant proportion of children
who were raised in orphanages with very little sensory or
social stimulation develop what has been called postin-
stitutional autistic syndrome [58]. Such children display
symptoms similar to children with ASD: they have stereotypic
behaviors, an inability to identify human emotions, disor-
dered social communication, abnormal language, poor cog-
nition, abnormal executive function, altered theory of mind,
poor sensory integration, poor motor behavior, and abnor-
mal attachment responses [58–63].
These children also share some of the same neurological
abnormalities as children with autism. For example, both
groups have depressed activity in their orbitofrontal cor-
tex/amygdala circuit, areas associated with social cognition
and emotion [64–67]. Children raised in orphanages and
children with ASD also have diminished white-matter con-
nectivity in the uncinate fasciculus [68–71], which is a major
pathway for communication between the amygdala and
orbitofrontal cortex. Both socially/sensory deprived children
and children with ASD do not have the right-hemisphere spe-
cialization for their neurophysiological response to human
faces [72–76]. Finally, neither children with ASD nor insti-
tutionalized children have the normal increase in ventral
striatum activity as they anticipate a reward [77–81].
The importance of sensory/social stimulation was under-
lined in the deprived children when they were placed in
foster homes or were given environmental enrichment in
their orphanage. In these new circumstances, many of their
symptoms were greatly ameliorated and their cognitive abili-
ties improved significantly [82–84]. Moreover, the quality of
the foster care correlates with better improvements in their
outcomes, as does their early transfer into foster care [59, 85,
86]. Sensory deprivation therefore appears to be associated
with an increased risk of expressing ASD symptoms and sen-
sory enrichment seems to be able to ameliorate those symp-
toms.
3.3. Normal Sensory Stimulation and the Maintenance of Brain
Health. If individuals with ASD need enhanced sensory
stimulation to experience typical neurobehavioral responses,
is it the case that neurotypical individuals also need a high
level of sensory stimulation to sustain normal brain function?
In fact, the loss of sensory input is associated with a decline
in higher-order functioning, including both facilitating a
cognitive decline in older adults and increasing the risk of
intellectual disability in children [87, 88]. For example, visual
impairment and hearing impairment are associated with cog-
nitive dysfunction in humans [89–92]. Similarly, mastication
problems are also associated with cognitive loss [93, 94].
Longitudinal studies of older adults without initial cog-
nitive impairment found that the failure to identify odors
predicted the onset of mild cognitive impairment within
five years [95–98]. In another study of nondemented older
adults, poor odor identification, along with aging and having
the ApoE-4 allele, predicted an increased cognitive decline
over five years that could not be predicted by performance
on a vocabulary test [99]. Even within a three-year period,
poor olfactory discrimination predicted a significant cogni-
tive decline [100]. Similarly, self-reports of poor olfactory
function predicted the onset of dementia over a ten-year
period [101]. Among those individuals who already had mild
cognitive impairment, poor olfactory abilities predicted the
onset of dementia [102, 103].
Anosmic individuals experience a loss of gray matter
in their medial prefrontal cortex, the subcallosal gyrus, the
nucleus accumbens, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cere-
bellum, occipital gyrus, piriform cortex, anterior insular cor-
tex, orbital frontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus,
hippocampus, and parahippocampal region, brain areas that
include those involved in cognitive function [104]. The longer
the olfactory loss, the more severe the loss of gray matter in
these areas. Peng et al. [105] similarly showed extensive loss of
both gray and white matter in the brains of anosmics, a neural
loss which was exacerbated with increased duration of the
sensory loss. When hyposmic individuals who have impaired
olfactory function were examined, their gray matter was
diminished in the insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex,
orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, fusiform gyrus, precuneus,
middle temporal gyrus, and piriform cortex. In addition,
their white matter was diminished underneath the insular
cortex, in the cerebellum, and in the middle frontal gyrus
[106]. Even distorted olfactory experience in the case of
paranosmia is associated with a diminishment of gray matter
in a variety of brain areas [107].
While sensory loss and cognitive decline may be indepen-
dent of each other, there is at least some reason to believe
 8
Neural Plasticity
that their relationship can be causal: that sensory loss can
speed cognitive decline. For example, diminished olfactory
and auditory abilities accurately predict subsequent cognitive
decline in prospective studies [100, 108]. In addition, the use
of hearing aids or the provision of cochlear implants can
induce cognitive gains in people with hearing loss [109, 110].
Prevention of vision loss in a mouse model of glaucoma
prevented its cognitive decline [111] and active mastication
improved cognitive function in humans following its dimin-
ishment with the inability to chew normally [112].
3.4.
Animal Models of Autism Respond to Environmental
Enrichment. Animal models of syndromic forms of autism
have shown that enriched environments can ameliorate the
autism-like symptoms that are seen under low levels of sen-
sory stimulation. An enriched environment for experimental
animals allows for increased social interactions in a large
cage, along with the opportunity to engage with a variety
of inanimate objects and to have the ability to exercise
[113]. There is a mouse model of autism that mimics Rett
syndrome, with the same gene deletion as humans who
have the syndrome. When these mice are housed in an
enriched sensorimotor environment, their autism-like symp-
toms, motor coordination, memory, and anxiety improve
[114–116]. Moreover, an enriched environment normalizes the
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic densities in their cerebel-
lum and cortex [116], restores cortical long-term potentiation,
increases cortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and
improves the expression of synaptic markers [114, 116].
Fragile X syndrome results from a mutation of the FMR1
gene and often produces children with symptoms that are
characteristic of autism. Sensorimotor enrichment similarly
rescues FMR1 knockout mice from cognitive deficiencies,
reduces anxiety, and increases their exploratory behavior
[117].
Most humans with Potocki-Lupski syndrome are diag-
nosed with autism [118, 119] and the mouse model of this
syndrome also has autism-like symptoms, including abnor-
mal ultrasonic vocalizations, perseverative/stereotypic be-
haviors, anxiety, deficits in learning and memory, and motor
deficits when they are housed in a low-stimulation envi-
ronment [120]. Mice with this genetic anomaly living in an
enriched sensorimotor environment have improved motor
skills, improved learning and memory, reduced aggressive
behavior, and reduced anxiety, although it did not improve
their social abnormalities or their abnormal vocalizations
[120]. As a whole, these data point to the conclusion that these
genetic anomalies are only capable of producing their autism-
like syndrome under limited environmental stimulation.
There are three other animal models of autism that
also respond well to environmental enrichment. BTBR mice
have been differentially bred to express what appear to be
core symptoms of autism. Specifically, they have impaired
social interactions, deficits in communication, poor social
transmission of food preferences, and repetitive behaviors
[121–123]. This model of autism also responds well to environ-
mental enrichment, normalizing their repetitive grooming
behaviors and their repetitive exploration of objects, as well
as their cognitive ability [124, 125]. When BTBR mice were
given social enrichment by housing them with a very social
mouse strain, the BTBR mice showed improved sociability,
but it did not normalize their repetitive behaviors [126].
Deer mice who are kept isolated in a small cage engage in
repetitive, stereotyped behavior that resembles ASD behav-
ioral patterns. Such behavior is normalized in an enriched
environment [127].
Fetal exposure to valproic acid increases the expression
of ASD symptoms in humans, and it has similar effects in
rats [128]. Animals exposed to valproic acid in fetal life have a
suppressed pain response, increased anxiety, hypersensitivity
to sensory stimuli, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors,
decreased exploration, and limited social interactions [129].
In addition, these rats have lower acoustic prepulse inhibi-
tion, which is involved in adaptation to sensory input [129].
Again, sensory enrichment in such rats ameliorated their
autism-like symptoms, including decreased repetitive activity
and anxiety, while increasing normal exploratory activity and
social behaviors [129].
In addition to ASD, environmental enrichment is effec-
tive in ameliorating the symptoms of a large number of
neurological disorders [130–134] and it seems quite possible
that other neurological disorders can be treated with this
approach. Indeed, we have initiated an effort to determine
the efficacy of environmental enrichment for the treatment
of other developmental neurobehavioral disorders.
3.5. Sensory Abnormalities in ASD. How might increased
sensorimotor experiences ameliorate the symptoms of
autism? Up to 95% of children with autism have sensory pro-
cessing abnormalities that include increased sensory seeking
behavior, avoidance or diminished responses to some sen-
sory stimuli, and enhanced perceptual abilities [135–142].
Indeed, abnormal sensory reactivity is included in the
current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD [143].
Some of the sensory abnormalities that have been
described in ASD occur early in neural sensory processing
and therefore raise the possibility that the core symptoms of
ASD may be responses to abnormal sensory input [144–146].
For example, the strength of perceptual binding of audio-
visual speech observed in individuals with ASD is strongly
related to their low-level multisensory temporal processing
abilities, suggesting that sensory problems may underlie core
elements of their disorder [147, 148]. Alternatively, the anxiety
evoked by abnormal sensory responses may be ameliorated
by engaging in repetitive behaviors and/or rituals [149].
Indeed, anxiety in preschoolers with ASD increases the
probability of their engaging in rituals [150]. Differences in
temperament, personality, language, and social development
of children with ASD also appear to be related to their sensory
problems [151, 152]. Environmental enrichment decreases
abnormal sensory responses [18] and this ability may underlie
part of its effectiveness in reducing other symptoms of
autism.
3.6. Study Limitations. While these data suggest the fea-
sibility of a real-world online treatment for ASD using
environmental enrichment, there are several limitations of
this study. At the same time, it is important to point out
 Neural Plasticity
9
that these data are quite consistent with the outcomes of the
two randomized clinical trials that evaluated environmental
enrichment for the treatment of ASD [17, 18].
Because parents self-selected the number of worksheets
that they received, there are limits regarding the interpreta-
tion of these findings, as there may have been other variables
associated with that behavior that may have actually caused
the lower level of improvement in the children of those
parents who appeared to be unengaged with the therapy.
Another factor is that most parents were paying for this
therapy and financial considerations may well have been a
factor in determining the length of time that parents were
willing to participate in the program, or it may have affected
their evaluation of the outcomes for their child. However,
there was no difference in outcomes reported by parents who
were paying and parents who were scholarship recipients and
were not paying for the treatment. It also should be noted
that an even lower-cost alternative payment plan has recently
been instituted for this online therapy and this change has
reduced patient dropout from the program. In addition, while
finances may have been a variable in determining the length
of treatment, the fact that some children experienced a rapid,
large improvement in their symptoms raises the possibility
that their parents may have stopped treatment because their
child had made good progress on the therapy, rather than
stopping due to financial reasons or dissatisfaction with the
therapy.
An additional limitation of this study is that there were
no professional diagnoses for the subjects. The subjects in
this study had a variety of reported diagnoses or no reported
diagnosis. However, diagnostic categorization of psychiatric
disorders does not correlate well with the biological bases
of the disorders [153], and the National Institute for Mental
Health has concluded that it makes more sense to evaluate
psychiatric issues based on individual symptoms, as we have
done, rather than relying on diagnostic categories to describe
subjects in clinical trials [153].
Parents were also the only source of information regard-
ing the outcomes for their children. However, most assess-
ments of treatments for ASD rely on parental feedback
for the determination of symptom improvement, including
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Vineland
Adaptive Behavior Scale, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale,
the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Short Sensory Profile,
the Modified Checklist of Autism in Toddlers, the Autism
Diagnostic Interview, the Social Communication Question-
naire, the Autism Behavior Checklist, the Gilliam Autism
Rating Scale, the Parent Interview for Autism, the Asperger
Syndrome Diagnostic Scale, the Autism Spectrum Screening
Questionnaire, the PDD Behavior Inventory, the Children’s
Communication Checklist, and the Childhood Autism Spec-
trum Test. Direct observation, using, for example, both the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Global
Clinical Impression Scale, relies on limited time spent with
the child under atypical conditions. These assessment tools
are often inadequate, on their own, to reveal reliable changes
in outcomes over time. The former test requires an evaluator
to determine whether or not the subject’s highly variable
behavior is typical or atypical in sessions six months apart
and the latter asks the assessor to compare the behavior of the
child at the initiation of the therapy to the behavior shown
after 6 months of therapy. The reality is that it is difficult to
obtain critical information about the progress of ASD chil-
dren without being able to observe their behavior on a daily
basis. While the parents were the only source of assessment
in this study, their conclusions were consistent with both
the objective and subjective measures used in our previous
two randomized clinical trials that showed improvements for
children with ASD after Sensory Enrichment Therapy.
This study also did not have a control group to compare to
those given Sensory Enrichment Therapy, and it is therefore
possible that the benefits of this therapy may have been
seen simply with the passage of time. On the other hand,
the noncompliant parents who continued their assessments
for at least 6 months had a much smaller improvement in
their child’s symptoms than compliant parents. These data
suggest that there was a critical difference in the outcomes
that depended on the intensity of the treatment. It is also
the case that the outcomes of children treated with Sensory
Enrichment Therapy appear to be much better than the
developmental trajectories of 6,975 children with autism,
aged 2–14, who were assessed repeatedly over a long period of
time [154]. They found that children with ASD who did not
have access to this therapy had heterogeneous developmental
pathways. Unlike our treated children, the children that they
followed with a low initial ASD severity score tended to have
the greatest improvements over time, and few of the children
that they followed experienced a major improvement in their
symptoms, particularly over the initial 7 months.
There was also limited demographic information of
subjects and their parents in our study, aside from age,
gender, and geographic origin. Neither was there information
collected regarding their concurrent use of pharmaceuticals,
concurrent behavioral/medical treatments, or the training
level of concurrent treatment providers. The diagnoses and
patient age were heterogeneous, as one would expect in
the real world, but that enhances the generalizability of our
conclusions. In addition, while there was objective evidence
of whether the parents downloaded worksheets, there was no
objective assessment of the fidelity with which they admin-
istered the treatment to their children. We also do not know
whether the same parent completed all of the assessments.
There is always a trade-off between the internal validity
provided by well-run randomized clinical trials in evaluating
the efficacy of a treatment and the external validity evaluating
the effectiveness of the treatment when it is given to a broad
variety of individuals under real-world circumstances. In this
study, we have evaluated the effectiveness of Sensory Enrich-
ment Therapy with a large number of diverse individuals and
have shown that the efficacy previously demonstrated for this
therapy in clinical trials can also be seen to be effective in the
real world.
3.6.1. Gene-Environment Interactions in Autism. The genetic
underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder have been estab-
lished with studies of twins, families, and populations [3, 155–
158], but these data also make it clear that there is also a
significant environmental risk for the expression of autism

symptoms. The heterogeneity of both the symptoms and the
genetics are high, but the phenotypic heterogeneity does not
correlate well with the genetic heterogeneity [159]. There is
extraordinary complexity in the underlying genetics, with
hundreds of common and rare genetic variants increasing the
risk for ASD, with the preponderance of risk due to com-
mon variations [158]. In addition, the total burden of these
genetic variants is correlated with the expression of ASD
symptoms [158, 160]. Moreover, the same single-nucleotide
polymorphisms can be shared with ASD, attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive
disorder, or schizophrenia [161].
Although the early estimates from twin studies of the rel-
ative contribution of genes and environment greatly favored
the role of genes in elevating ASD risk [155–157], more recent
studies using genome-wide estimates have about equal risk
assigned to genes and environment [3, 158]. This change in the
relative importance of genes and environment may be due to
a number of variables, including changes in the ways by which
ASD is diagnosed, with the diagnostic category expanding
to include Asperger’s syndrome. Another possibility is that
those individuals with syndromic ASD are less likely to be
included in recent studies, as differential diagnoses of these
disorders has improved. Differences in statistical modeling of
the data may also have contributed to this shift.
There are a number of risk factors that suggest an
interaction between genes and environment in ASD. For
example, there is a strong relationship between paternal age
and ASD risk [162], perhaps due to an increase in genetic
anomalies with age [163]. Importantly, Hultman et al. [162]
showed that it was not due to having a father who had
ASD-like symptoms and was unable to find a mate earlier

in life. To the contrary, they showed that, in families with
one child diagnosed with ASD, that child was likely to
be born to the father when he was older than when the
children without autism were born. In addition, the time
since the birth of one child predicted the occurrence of ASD
in the other child. Advanced paternal age also predicted a
higher concordance rate for ASD between both monozygotic
and dizygotic twins, suggesting that the additional genetic
anomalies that come with advancing paternal age may add
to other genetic anomalies to result in an ASD diagnosis
[164]. Finally, Frans et al. [165] showed that increasing age of
the grandfather also predicted increased risk for ASD in the
grandchildren, suggesting that environmental experiences
well in advance of the child’s conception appear to increase
the risk of ASD.
Older mothers also have children with an increased ASD
risk [166], even where various other factors involved with
pregnancy and birth are considered. While younger mothers
have eggs that respond to DNA damage by arresting at
metaphase of the first meiosis, thereby preventing abnormal
embryos, older mothers have a reduced ability to engage this
developmental control point and therefore are more likely
to have increased chromosomal anomalies in embryos [167].
Such anomalies may result in an increased risk of ASD.
In another example of gene x environment interaction,
valproic acid has been given to pregnant women for the
treatment of epilepsy, migraine, or bipolar disorder. This
drug inhibits histone deacetylase, which impacts gene tran-
scription [168], and it induces DNA demethylation [169],
which dysregulates the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway that
is involved in brain development [170]. There is also an
increased risk of ASD in their children [170]. Recall that
when fetal rats are exposed to valproic acid, they develop
autism-like symptoms that are greatly ameliorated by living
in an enriched sensorimotor environment [114–116]. These
data show that the probability of expressing autism symptoms
can be increased or decreased, depending on environmen-
tal experiences. Decreased sensory stimulation, along with
valproic acid exposure, increases the expression of ASD
symptoms and increased sensory stimulation decreases the
expression of those symptoms in the animal model.
There are other environmental factors during fetal life
that can increase the risk of ASD. A clear example of a
gene x environment interaction can be found in the study of
the risk of ASD with exposure to air pollution. Specifically,
children who were exposed to high levels of air pollution
either during pregnancy or as infants are at increased risk
for ASD [171–174]. Air pollution appears to interact with
the MET receptor tyrosine kinase gene, which is involved
in mediating brain development. A variant of this gene that
disrupts MET transcription is associated with an increased
risk of ASD [175] and children exposed to high levels of air
pollution only had an elevated risk for ASD if they also had
this genetic variant [176].
4. Conclusions
Environmental enrichment in the form of Sensory Enrich-
ment Therapy provided online shows promise as an effective
approach for treatment of a wide range of symptoms in indi-
viduals with autism. This therapy appears to be an effective,
low-cost means of treating ASD symptoms and associated
symptoms across different ages, geographic location, gender,
and symptom severity under real-world conditions.
