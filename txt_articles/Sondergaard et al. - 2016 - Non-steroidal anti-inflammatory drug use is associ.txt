Aims
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used and have been associated with increased cardiovascular
risk. Nonetheless, it remains unknown whether use of NSAIDs is associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
From the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, all persons with OHCA during 2001–10 were identified.
NSAID use 30 days before OHCA was categorized as follows: diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, rofecoxib, cele-
coxib, and other. Risk of OHCA associated with use of NSAIDs was analysed by conditional logistic regression in
case–time–control models matching four controls on sex and age per case to account for variation in drug utiliza-
tion over time. We identified 28 947 persons with OHCA of whom 3376 were treated with an NSAID up to 30
days before OHCA. Ibuprofen and diclofenac were the most commonly used NSAIDs and represented 51.0% and
21.8% of total NSAID use, respectively. Use of diclofenac (odds ratio [OR], 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI)
1.23–1.82]) and ibuprofen [OR, 1.31 (95% CI 1.14–1.51)] was associated with a significantly increased risk of
OHCA. Use of naproxen [OR, 1.29 (95% CI 0.77–2.16)], celecoxib [OR, 1.13 (95% CI 0.74–1.70)], and rofecoxib
(OR, 1.28 [95% CI 0.74–1.70)] was not significantly associated with increased risk of OHCA; however, these
groups were characterized by few events.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Use of non-selective NSAIDs was associated with an increased early risk of OHCA. The result was driven by an
increased risk of OHCA in ibuprofen and diclofenac users.

Introduction
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the
most commonly used drugs worldwide. More than 50% of the adult
Danish population redeemed at least one prescription of an NSAID
during 1997–2005 and 29.6 million adults in the USA used NSAIDs
on a regular basis in 2010.1,2
Over the last decade, evidence of a cardiovascular risk associated
with use of NSAIDs has emerged. The selective cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibitors, and to a lesser extent the non-selective NSAIDs,
have been associated with cardiovascular adverse events, such as myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure in randomized and observa-
tional studies.3–11 Cardiac arrest is the ultimate adverse drug event,
and though it is closely linked to ischaemic disease and cardiovascular

morbidity, the association between NSAIDs and cardiac arrest has
never been investigated.12–14 Currently, there is no research pertaining
to NSAIDs pro-arrhythmic effects regarding ventricular arrhythmias as
isolated events; however, an association with NSAIDs and sudden car-
diac death as part of a composite endpoint with myocardial infarction
has been observed.5,15 Consequently, it remains to be established,
whether use of NSAIDs is associated with cardiac arrest.
This prompted us to conduct an observational case–time–control
study using data from the Danish nationwide registries to investigate
the association between use of NSAIDs and risk of out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OHCA).
Methods
Study design
The association between NSAID use and cardiac arrest was explored in
the case–time–control design, an acknowledged pharmacoepidemiologic
method designed to evaluate brief exposures with acute effects.16 The
design has been validated and used in several previous studies.16–19 The
case–time–control design is an extended case-crossover design where
each individual serves as both case and their own control in two different
time-periods. The ‘case period’ precedes outcome, and the ‘control
period’ of same length precedes the case period. Exposure to NSAIDs 30
days before cardiac arrest (case period) was assessed and compared with
exposure to NSAIDs in a preceding 30-day period where the individual
did not experience an event (control period). A 30-day washout period
separated case and control period to eliminate possible carry-over ef-
fects. A major advantage of the case-crossover design is the elimination
of unmeasured confounding from characteristics that remain stable over
time (e.g. comorbidity).
Although a case-crossover design is vulnerable to changes in prevalence
of exposure over time, a case–time–control design incorporates data from
a control group selected from the general population to adjust for possible
time-variant biases related to exposure. The prevalence of exposure to
NSAIDs in Denmark could have been influenced by changes in prescription
patterns over time due to safety alerts regarding the COX-2 selective in-
hibitors. Consequently, we performed a case–time–control analysis, con-
sisting of two separate case-crossover analyses for cardiac arrest cases and
the control group, respectively. Thus, the control group is used only to ad-
just for changes in prescribing patterns in the background population.
Controls were assigned a fictive date of cardiac arrest according to the case
they were matched upon. Only individuals with differing exposure in case
and control period contributed to the final analysis. Because median treat-
ment duration in Denmark for all types of NSAIDs is between 13 and 29
days and previous studies have observed enhanced cardiovascular risk asso-
ciated with less than 30 days of treatment with NSAIDs, the case period
was defined to 30 days.1,20,21 Using the odds ratio (OR) from the case-
crossover analysis of the control group as a measurement of time trends in
exposure, the case–time–control OR is calculated by dividing the OR from
cases by the OR from controls.22
Data sources
All residents in Denmark have a unique and permanent civil registration
number that enables individual-level linkage between the national Danish
registries. To identify patients with OHCA, we used data from the Danish
Cardiac Arrest Registry, which contains information about all OHCAs in
Denmark since June 2001. Data are close to complete, as all ambulance per-
sonnel in Denmark are required to fill out a form every time they encounter
a cardiac arrest, defined as a clinical condition of cardiac arrest where
resuscitative efforts are initiated. Persons with obvious late signs of death
where no resuscitation is attempted are not included in the registry.23
The Danish Patient Registry holds information about all admissions in
Denmark from 1978. Each admission is registered by one primary diag-
nose and one or more secondary diagnoses according to the
International Classification of Diagnoses. Information includes date and
duration of admissions, operations, treatments, and discharge diagnoses.
Information about cause and time of death is registered in The National
Causes of Death Registry.
Information on use of drugs is obtained from the Danish Prescription
Registry. The registry contains information about dosage, type, date of
delivery, and classification according to the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical Classification System. All pharmacies in Denmark are required
to register all redeemed prescriptions in the Danish Prescription Registry,
which ensures completeness of the registry.24
Study patients
Via the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, we identified all persons with
OHCA during 2001–10, who on 1 January 1997 wereaged >
_ 10 years.
From the Danish Patient Registry, four controls matched on age and sex
were selected for every case by using the greedy matching algorithm, a
method used and described previously.17 As previously done, information
on comorbidity in the cardiac arrest population was obtained via dis-
charge diagnoses from admissions up to 5 years before event, and con-
comitant pharmacotherapy was identified from redeemed prescriptions
up to 90 days before event.17 As the diagnosis code of diabetes has a low
sensitivity in the Danish registries, diabetes was identified based on re-
demption of a prescription for a glucose-lowering drug within 180 days
before cardiac arrest, as done previously.25
Exposure
We detected all redeemed prescriptions for NSAIDs divided into the
most commonly used NSAIDs in Denmark: non-selective NSAIDs (diclo-
fenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen), COX-2 selective inhibitors (rofecoxib
and celecoxib), and other.
To determine whether a patient was using NSAIDs during the case or
control period, we identified dates when prescriptions were redeemed and
then calculated duration of treatment by dividing the number of tablets in
the prescription of interest by daily dosage. As information about daily dos-
age is not included in the registries, daily dosage was estimated by calculat-
ing mean dosages from up to five consecutive prescriptions before the
prescription of interest. If only one prescription was identified, the minimal
recommended daily dosage was used as daily dosage. This method has
been used in several papers and has been described in detail previously.1,26
We did not have information on over-the-counter medication; however,
the only NSAID available in Denmark without prescription is ibuprofen
sold only in low dosage (200mg) and small packages (max 20 tablets).
For further details regarding Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
Classification codes, see Supplementary material online, Table S1.
Outcome
Our primary endpoint was OHCA. As cause of cardiac arrest is not regis-
tered in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, presumed cause of cardiac
arrest was classified using discharge diagnoses from The Danish Patient
Registry and death certificates from The National Causes of Death
Registry. A presumed cardiac cause of cardiac arrest was defined as an
event with diagnosis code covering a known cardiac disease, unknown
disease, or unexpected collapse according to the Utstein template.23,27
Other medical disorders were considered non-cardiac causes, as
was trauma, drug overdose, attempted suicide, and violent attack.23

75% of all OHCA recorded in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry
during 2001–10.23
Statistical methods
Differences in baseline characteristics in the cardiac arrest population be-
tween NSAID users versus non-users and among those using specific
types of NSAIDs were tested using the v2 test for binary variables and
the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables. Trends in
drug use over time were tested with the Cochran–Armitage trend test.
The association between NSAID use and cardiac arrest was tested by
conditional logistic regression in case–time–control models. We tested
for confounding by acute disease exacerbation by excluding individuals
admitted up to 60 days before cardiac arrest and excluding individuals
with cancer, respectively. This was done since the case–time–control
method does not eliminate confounding from characteristics that change
between case and control period and lack of clinical data in the Danish
registries makes control for time-varying variables impossible.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS insti-
tute Inc., NC, USA). A two-sided P-value< 0.05 was considered significant.
Ethics
The project was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency
(Ref.no. 2007-58-0015, local ref.no. GEH-2014-017, I-Suite.nr. 02735).
No ethical approval is required for register-based studies performed on
anonymized data in Denmark.
Results
We identified 28 947 persons with OHCA during 2001–10 and
matched 115 788 controls with cases on age and sex. Within the 30-
day case period, 3376 (11.7%) persons were treated with an NSAID.
Compared with non-users, NSAID users were more often women,
had generally less cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart dis-
ease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, but were more likely to
have cancer and rheumatic diseases (P for all <0.05, Table 1).
Moreover, NSAID users were more often treated with morphine, di-
uretics, and psychiatric medication (P for all < 0.05).
Ibuprofen was the most commonly prescribed NSAID followed by
diclofenac comprising 51.0% and 21.8% of total NSAIDs, respectively
(Table 2). Overall, baseline characteristics did not differ substantially
within groups of users of non-selective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac,
and naproxen) and COX-2 selective inhibitors (rofecoxib and cele-
coxib), respectively. However, baseline characteristics did differ be-
tween groups; non-selective NSAIDs were associated with younger
age, male gender, and lower prevalence of heart failure and cardiac ar-
rhythmias in comparison with users of the COX-2 selective inhibitors.
Figure 1 shows use of NSAIDs over time in the cardiac arrest popu-
lation (A) and in the control group (B) during 2001–10. Overall, the
utilization patterns between cases and controls were alike with a sta-
ble proportion of users of any NSAID of approximately 12% annually
for cases (P for trend= 0.65) and 10% annually for controls (P for
trend <0.0001).
The main results from the case–time–control analysis are depicted
in Figure 2. Use of any NSAID was associated with a significantly
increased risk of cardiac arrest, OR 1.31 (95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.17–1.46). Likewise, use of non-selective NSAIDs was associ-
ated with increased risk of cardiac arrest, OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.18–
1.48), whereas no risk was significantly associated with use of the
COX-2 selective inhibitors, OR 1.19 (95% CI 0.89–1.59).
The risk of cardiac arrest associated with use of the most common
types of NSAIDs is depicted in Figure 3. Use of ibuprofen was signifi-
cantly associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest, OR 1.31
(95% CI 1.14–1.51) as was use of diclofenac, OR 1.50 (95% CI 1.23–
1.82). Naproxen use was not significantly associated with cardiac ar-
rest, and we did not find any significant associations between cardiac
arrest and use of COX-2 selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and celecoxib.
Effect modification by age and sex was tested by stratified analyses,
see Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2.
For more details regarding the distribution of cardiac arrest subjects
in case and control period, respectively, and respective OR from cases
and control group, see Supplementary material online, Table S2.
Sensitivity analyses
The robustness of our results was confirmed by performing the
case–time control analysis on different time windows of 7, 14, 20,
and 40 days that yielded similar results: ibuprofen, OR 1.57 (95% CI
1.24–2.00), OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.27–1.83), OR 1.40 (95% CI 1.19–
1.64), OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.09–1.41), respectively, and diclofenac, OR
1.62 (95% CI 1.16–2.26), OR 1.42 (95% CI 1.10–1.83), OR 1.30 (95%
CI 1.04–1.63), and OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.24–1.79), respectively.
Excluding 253 subjects< 18 years yielded the exact same results.
The results were unaltered excluding all subjects with a hospital
admission 60 days before cardiac arrest: ibuprofen OR 1.32 (95% CI
1.13–1.55)
and
diclofenac
OR
1.45
(95%
CI
1.15–1.83),
Supplementary material online, Figure S3. Including only subjects with
a presumed cardiac cause of cardiac arrest did not change the results
either: ibuprofen OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.10–1.51) and diclofenac OR 1.
45 (95% CI 1.18–1.87), Supplementary material online, Figure S4.
Lastly, exclusion of subjects with cancer produced similar results; ibu-
profen OR 1.33 (95% CI 1.15–1.54); diclofenac OR 1.50 (1.21–1.85).
The association between cardiac arrest and naproxen, celecoxib, and
rofecoxib remained insignificant in all sensitivity analyses.
Discussion
In this nationwide case–time control study, we found that use of non-
selective NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of OHCA.
The result was primarily driven by an increased risk of cardiac arrest
in ibuprofen and diclofenac users. We found no significant association
between cardiac arrest and use of the COX-2 selective inhibitors,
rofecoxib and celecoxib, nor with the unselective NSAID naproxen.
The results were verified in multiple sensitivity analyses, including the
exclusion of presumed non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest, and using
different definitions of exposure periods.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the associ-
ation between NSAIDs and OHCA. Currently, no research relating
to NSAIDs’ pro-arrhythmic effects with regard to ventricular ar-
rhythmias has been published; consequently, we compared our find-
ings in relation to studies with other cardiovascular endpoints, such
as myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. However, although
cardiac arrest is a combined endpoint, it is closely related to cardio-
vascular morbidity, particularly ischaemic heart disease, which has

been observed in more than 60% of all OHCA and 80% of sudden
cardiac deaths.12–14,28
In this study, short-term use of ibuprofen was associated with an
increased risk of cardiac arrest, OR 1.31. In two recent meta-analyses
of randomized trials, ibuprofen was also reported to be associated
with a substantial cardiovascular hazard: Bhala et al.4 reported a two-
fold increased risk of major coronary events when using ibuprofen
compared with placebo and a non-significant increased risk of vascular
death and death from any cause; Trelle et al.7 reported a more than
30% increased risk of several cardiovascular endpoints, such as myo-
cardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and death from any cause,
comparing ibuprofen with placebo. As few randomized trials of ibu-
profen exist, the meta-analyses lack statistical power regarding ibupro-
fen. Moreover, the trials were investigating high-dose treatment only
with daily use of 2400mg ibuprofen, which is considerably higher than
dosages used in daily practice.1 Even though the case–time–control
method eliminates confounding from stable characteristics, such as
cardiac comorbidity and concomitant pharmacotherapy, we cannot
fully exclude confounding by indication related to fluctuations in dis-
ease severity that could lead to a change in NSAID use. Nonetheless,
our findings indicate a harmful association between ibuprofen and car-
diac arrest and support the emerging evidence of an unfavourable as-
sociation between ibuprofen and cardiovascular safety.
We found that diclofenac was associated with an increased risk of
cardiac arrest, OR 1.50, which concurs with findings in several other
studies: Bhala et al. found a significantly increased risk of major coron-
ary events and vascular death of 70% and 65%, respectively, and
Trelle et al.4,7 reported a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular
death with a rate ratio of four. Again, the composite nature of cardiac
arrest entails careful interpretation, yet our results add to the accu-
mulating evidence that diclofenac is associated with increased cardio-
vascular risk.

Notably, we found no significant association between cardiac
arrest and the COX-2 selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and cele-
coxib. Several randomized clinical trials found a dose-dependent
increased cardiovascular hazard with rofecoxib treatment, which
led to a complete withdrawal of rofecoxib from the market in
2004.3,9,10 Studies on celecoxib have had more ambiguous find-
ings, and although a large randomized clinical trial found a dose-
related risk of death from cardiovascular causes, acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, and heart failure, other studies, including the
meta-analysis by Trelle et al.,6,7 found no such risk. However,
when grouping the COX-2 selective inhibitors, Bhala et al.4 found
a significant increased risk of vascular death and death from any
cause. Rofecoxib and celecoxib are seldom used in Denmark, es-
pecially after 2006 when rofecoxib was withdrawn from the mar-
ket, and this combined with a hard endpoint (cardiac arrest)
entailed relatively few events in our study and possibly low statis-
tical power. Thus, in light of previous research, our findings of an
apparent safety regarding cardiac arrest and use of COX-2 select-
ive inhibitors should be interpreted with caution.
Lack of statistical power applies to naproxen as well. As naproxen is
rarely used in Denmark, there were few events and a wide CI. Though
the OR point estimate suggests an association with cardiac arrest simi-
lar to what we find in ibuprofen and diclofenac users, the study has in-
sufficient power to examine the importance of naproxen.
Limitations
The main limitation of the study is inherent in the observational na-
ture of the analyses. The treatment allocation is not randomized and
the study reports only associations and therefore any conclusion on
causality should be made with caution.

The case–time–control method accounts for fixed confounders
but could be influenced by transient factors, such as acute disease ex-
acerbation or fluctuation in disease severity. Although, the exclusion
of patients with admissions 60 days before index date did not change
our results, we cannot fully eliminate the risk of confounding by indi-
cation, as we do not have access to possibly confounding clinical
covariables, such as blood samples, electrocardiographic parameters,
or treatment indication, e.g. chest pain.
Information on drug use originates from the Danish pharmacies and
we have no information regarding compliance; however, as drug ex-
penses are only partially reimbursed by Danish Health Care authorities,
we assume that non-compliance had little influence on our results. In
addition, non-compliance would affect the results towards null and
thus reduce the association between exposure and outcome.
Moreover, we do not have information on use of over-the-counter
drugs. In Denmark, ibuprofen is the only NSAID sold as an over-the-
counter drug (since 1 November 2001) and accounts for 30% of total
ibuprofen sales during 1999–2012. It is sold only in 200mg dosages and
in small packages (maximum 30 tablets per package).29 Using prescrip-
tion data without information on over-the-counter ibuprofen entails a
risk of underestimating the true exposure prevalence. However, in our
study, the exposure misclassification should be equally distributed in
both case- and control period. Moreover, a study quantifying the effect
of missing information on over-the-counter NSAID found the effect
on study validity to be almost negligable.30 Acetylsalicylic acid is also
sold as an over-the-counter drug in Denmark, but since 2002 more
than 80% of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid has been dispensed by pre-
scription and the influence on our results should be minimal.29 Lastly,

the determination of treatment duration is an approximation, however,
used in numerous papers before.1,11
Conclusion
In a nationwide cohort of persons with OHCA, we found that short-
term treatment with non-selective NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen
and diclofenac, was associated with an increased early risk of cardiac
arrest. We found no association between cardiac arrest and use of
the COX-2 selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and celecoxib, nor the
non-selective NSAID naproxen.
Our findings support the accumulating evidence of an unfavourable
cardiovascular risk profile associated with use of the non-selective
NSAIDs. This calls for special awareness in order to balance risks
against benefits in treatment with NSAIDs.
