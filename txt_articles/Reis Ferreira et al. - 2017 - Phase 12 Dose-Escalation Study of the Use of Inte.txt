Summary
Elective pelvic lymph node
(PLN) radiation therapy and
hypofractionation for
advanced localized prostate
cancer remains controversial.
We report a single-center
sequential cohort study using
intensity modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) to deliver
conventionally fractionated
Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of dose escalation and hypofractionation of pelvic
lymph node intensity modulated radiation therapy (PLN-IMRT) in prostate cancer (PCa).
Methods and Materials: In a phase 1/2 study, patients with advanced localized PCa
were sequentially treated with 70 to 74 Gy to the prostate and dose-escalating
PLN-IMRT at doses of 50 Gy (cohort 1), 55 Gy (cohort 2), and 60 Gy (cohort
3) in 35 to 37 fractions. Two hypofractionated cohorts received 60 Gy to the pros-
tate and 47 Gy to PLN in 20 fractions over 4 weeks (cohort 4) and 5 weeks
(cohort 5). All patients received long-course androgen deprivation therapy.
Primary outcome was late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity at 2 years
after radiation therapy for all cohorts. Secondary outcomes were acute and
late toxicity using other clinician/patient-reported instruments and treatment effi-
cacy.

studied modest hypofractio-
nation delivering 60 Gy
(3 Gy per fraction) to the
prostate with 47 Gy to the

findings highlight the safety
of dose escalation and

Results: Between August 9, 2000, and June 9, 2010, 447 patients were enrolled.
Median follow-up was 90 months. The 2-year rates of grade 2þ bowel/bladder
toxicity were as follows: cohort 1, 8.3%/4.2% (95% confidence interval 2.2%-
29.4%/0.6%-26.1%); cohort 2, 8.9%/5.9% (4.1%-18.7%/2.3%-15.0%); cohort 3,

16.4%/4.8%
(9.2%-28.4%/
1.6%-14.3%); cohort 5, 12.2%/7.3% (7.6%-19.5%/3.9%-13.6%). Prevalence of
bowel and bladder toxicity seemed to be stable over time. Other scales mirrored
these results. The biochemical/clinical failureefree rate was 71% (66%-75%) at
5 years for the whole group, with pelvic lymph node control in 94% of patients.
Conclusions: This study shows the safety and tolerability of PLN-IMRT. Ongoing
and planned phase 3 studies will need to demonstrate an increase in efficacy using
PLN-IMRT to offset the small increase in bowel side effects compared with
prostate-only IMRT. � 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, ac-
counting for 27% of new cancer cases in 2014, and more
than 307,000 men died from prostate cancer in 2012
worldwide (1, 2). In the United Kingdom, 46,690 new cases
were diagnosed in 2014 (2). Most men are now diagnosed
with localized disease, but high-risk prostate cancer re-
mains life-threatening. Treatment with external beam ra-
diation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and
in selected cases, high-dose-rate brachytherapy has been
used in this patient group (3). Approximately 15,800 men
receive radical prostate radiation therapy every year in the
United Kingdom (4). However, the merit of elective pelvic
lymph node radiation therapy (PLNRT) compared with
treatment of prostate and seminal vesicles alone remains
controversial, and present guidelines suggest that PLNRT
should be considered but not mandated for high-risk dis-
ease (1, 5). This uncertainty may relate to the modest doses
of radiation therapy that are usually given with PLNRT so
as to avoid bowel toxicity.
Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) makes it
possible to increase bowel sparing, which is the dose-
limiting normal tissue when treating the pelvis (6, 7).
Intensity modulated radiation therapy brings the oppor-
tunity to dose escalate, which has been linked with
increased disease control in prostate cancer (8-11). The
low a/b ratio of prostate cancer makes hypofractionation
an attractive option for treatment, with recent data
demonstrating equivalent outcomes to standard dose
schedules treating the prostate alone (4). Dose escalation
and hypofractionation have not been adequately evaluated
for pelvic LNRT, with limited data available from small
case series (8-10, 12).
The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of using
IMRT to deliver LNRT to patients with high-risk prostate
cancer,
using
dose-escalated
conventional
and
hypo-
fractionated schedules.
Methods and Materials
Study design and participants
We performed a single-center, phase 1/2 study of IMRT to
irradiate the prostate and PLN in patients with advanced
localized prostate cancer. Eligible patients had prostate
cancer with very high risk (T3b/T4) or node-positive dis-
ease, high-risk disease with Gleason score �8 or �2 risk
factors, or an estimated risk of nodal metastases of >30%
based on the Roach formula (1, 13). Postprostatectomy
patients (T2-T3a, N0) with extensive Gleason score �8
disease and seminal vesicle or lymph node involvement
were also eligible. Patients unsuitable for radical radiation
therapy or with a history of pelvic surgery or inflammatory
bowel disease were excluded.
Patients were sequentially assigned to receive 3 different
dose schedules to the PLN of 50, 55, or 60 Gy (cohorts 1, 2,
and 3, respectively) giving 70 to 74 Gy in 2-Gy fractions over
7 weeks to the prostate. An integratedboost of 5 Gy was given
to radiologically suspicious PLN. Two hypofractionated
cohorts (cohorts 4 and 5) were then studied, based on
equivalent doses to the conventional schedule calculated
assuming an a/b ratio of 2.5 Gy. They received 60 Gy to the
prostate in 3-Gy fractions over 4 to 5 weeks and 47 Gy to the
PLN. An integrated boost of 4 Gy was given to radiologically
suspicious PLN. Patients were initially treated on a 4-week
schedule (cohort 4), which was later modified to a 5-week
schedule (cohort 5) because of acute gastrointestinal (GI)
toxicity. Patients irradiated after prostatectomy received
64 Gy in 32 fractions in cohorts 1 and 2, 65 Gy in 35 fractions
in cohort 3, or 55 Gy in 20 fractions in cohorts 4 and 5 (Table
E1; available online at www.redjournal.org).
Procedures
Patients received long-course (2-3 years) ADT with at least
6 months’ treatment before radiation therapy commenced.

Pelvic lymph node IMRT in prostate cancer 1235
 Patients underwent planning computed tomography
(CT) scans with a comfortably full bladder and empty
rectum. From 2011, sodium citrate enemas were used for
patients with rectal dilatation. Inverse radiation therapy
planning was performed for all patients, using mandatory
normal tissue dose constraints (Table E2; available
online at www.redjournal.org) as previously described
(14, 15). Clinical target volume-1 included the prostate
and any radiologically involved seminal vesicle, with a
margin of 8 mm posteriorly and 10 mm in all other
directions to create planning target volume-1. Clinical
target volume-2 included PLN and uninvolved seminal
vesicles (Text E2; available online at www.redjournal
.org). A uniform margin of 5 mm was applied to create
planning
target
volume-2.
Clinical
target
volume-3
included any radiologically involved lymph nodes, and
a uniform margin of 5 mm was applied to create planning
target volume-3. All organs at risk were contoured as
solid organs, by defining the outer wall of rectum, bowel,
and bladder. The rectum was contoured from the anus
(usually at the level of the ischial tuberosities or 1 cm
below the lower margin of the planning target volume,
whichever was more inferior) to the recto-sigmoid
junction.
Bowel
was
outlined
separately,
excluding
rectum and extending 2 cm above the superior extent of
planning target volume-2. The bladder was outlined from
base to dome. Treatment verification was performed
offline using bony anatomy for registration (Text E1;
available online at www.redjournal.org).
Staging investigations included prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) measurement, histologic diagnosis, radiologic or
surgical lymph node assessment, and staging magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), CT, or bone scan.
Acute side effects were recorded weekly using the
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring
system up to 18 weeks after initiating radiation therapy.
Late toxicity was scored according to the European Or-
ganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/RTOG

patient-reported
outcomes (16-18). Data were collected at baseline,
every 6 months up to 5 years after radiation therapy, and
yearly thereafter.
Prostate-specific antigen was measured every 6 months
for 8 years after the start of ADT and annually thereafter.
The nadir PSA level was the lowest level recorded after
radiation therapy. Biochemical failure was defined ac-
cording to the Phoenix consensus guidelines as a PSA value
greater than the nadir plus 2 ng/mL. Local recurrence was
confirmed on MRI of the pelvis or biopsy, and post-
prostatectomy patients (nZ34) were excluded from this
endpoint. Distant relapse was confirmed on MRI, CT scan,
bone scan, or choline positron emission tomographyeCT
scan.
Statistical considerations
The primary endpoint was late RTOG toxicity assessed
2 years after radiation therapy. Secondary endpoints
included assessment of all toxicity scales during follow-up
and disease recurrence. Patients were stratified by total
bowel volume outlined (<450 cm3 vs �450 cm3). For each
dose level stratified by bowel volume, at least 15 men were
treated and followed up for at least 1 year. If 0 of 15 men
had a grade 3 or higher (grade 3þ) RTOG complication,
then a 20% grade 3þ toxicity rate was excluded with
1-sided significance level of .05. Because the dose to the
initial cohort was modest, patients in the low bowel volume
group were recruited to the second dose level after 7 men
had �12 months of follow-up, provided none of these had
recorded a grade �3 complication. For other cohorts and
bowel volume groups, recruitment continued at that level
until such time as 15 men had been treated and followed up
for at least 1 year. This strategy ensured that the low bowel
volume group moved to the higher dose cohorts in advance
of the high bowel volume group. Because recruitment
continued in each cohort and bowel volume group until
such time as the required total of men had reached
�12 months of follow-up, in all cases the eventual sample
size in each group exceeded the required total to an extent
that varied according to the recruitment rate over time.
In cohorts 3 and 4, a further dose expansion phase was
planned, with a target sample size of 103 patients (of any
bowel volume) evaluable at 2 years, to rule out a late grade
2 or higher (grade 2þ) bowel toxicity rate of �25%, using a
1-sided alpha 0.05 and power of 80% with an assumed true
rate of toxicity not more than 15%. The sample size was
expanded to a total of 123 in each of cohort 3 and 4 to allow
for an expected dropout rate of 16% by 2 years. However,
because of high levels of acute bowel toxicity observed in
cohort 4 (4-weekly schedule), the treatment schedule was
amended to 5 weeks (cohort 5) with a target of 123 patients.
Late toxicity rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier
methods, with time measured from start of radiation ther-
apy. Rates by 1 and 2 years were calculated with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). One-sided 95% CIs were con-
structed for rate of RTOG grade 3þ bowel toxicity at 1 year
(cohorts 1 and 2) and for rate of RTOG grade 2þ bowel
toxicity at 2 years (cohorts 3 and 4), to assess safety of the
primary endpoint. In addition, the number of men experi-
encing defined toxicity grades at each time point was re-
ported as a percentage of all men assessed. Efficacy was
assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods to calculate duration
of disease control (defined as a composite endpoint of
biochemical
progression,
local
or
lymph
node/pelvic
recurrence, or distant metastasis, or recommencement of
ADT), duration of local disease control, duration of distant
disease control, and disease-specific and overall survival
from start of radiation therapy. For disease-specific and
overall survival, patients were censored at the date they
were last known to be alive. Rates at 2 and 5 years were

 calculated with 95% CIs. Data were extracted in September
2015 and analyzed using STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
Univariable Cox regression on duration of disease control
was performed using factors of dose cohort, N stage (N0 vs
N1-3), baseline PSA level (log transformed), clinical T stage
(grouped as T1/T2; T3a; T3bþ), and Gleason score (grouped
as �6; 7; �8). Forward and backward stepwise selection
methods were used to combine significant factors (P<.05 on
univariable analysis) into a multivariable model and produce
adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs.

approved the study, which was included in the National
Cancer Research Network portfolio in December 2003. The
trial was performed in accordance with the principles of
good clinical practice and overseen by a trial management
group. All patients provided written informed consent.
Results
Between August 9, 2000, and June 9, 2010, 447 male pa-
tients were recruited to cohorts 1 to 5; 426 were treated
according to protocol, and 421 were available for late
toxicity assessment (Fig. 1). Median age was 65 years
(interquartile range, 60-70 years), with median presenting
PSA level of 21.4 ng/mL (10.2-42.8 ng/mL). Forty-six
percent of patients had clinical T3/T4 disease, 54% had
Gleason �8 scores, and 17% PLN involvement. Cohort 1
had a higher proportion of patients with adverse features
than cohorts 2 to 5. Median duration of adjuvant hormone
therapy was 35 months (33-37 months), and median follow-
up was 90 months (Table 1), with 398 patients out of 426
followed up for toxicity for at least 2 years and 327 fol-
lowed up for at least 5 years. Thirty-four patients (8%) were
treated adjuvantly after undergoing a radical prostatectomy
before entering the trial (Table E6; available online at www
.redjournal.org).
Acute bowel toxicity peaked at 6 to 8 weeks in the
conventionally fractionated (CFRT) cohorts 1 to 3, compared
with 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 weeks in the hypofractionated (HFRT)
cohorts 4 and 5, respectively. Peak grade 2þ toxicity was
recorded in 40%, 56%, and 54% of cohorts 1 to 3 respec-
tively. Patients in cohort 4 developed the highest acute bowel
toxicity rates, with 66% reporting grade 2þ bowel toxicity,
compared with 48% in cohort 5. However, by 18 weeks after
treatment the incidence of grade 2þ RTOG bowel toxicity
was similar in all cohorts (Fig. 2 and Table E3 [available

 toxicity occurred in 0 (0%), 1 (1%), 5 (4%), 3 (5%), and 9
(7%) patients in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. One patient in
each of cohorts 4 and 5 developed grade 4 acute toxicity, and
there was 1 death (recorded as grade 5 toxicity), determined
at autopsy to have resulted from perforation of an undiag-
nosed caecal carcinoma.
Acute bladder toxicity was related to dose in the CFRT
cohorts, with peak grade 2þ toxicity recorded in 28%,
44%, and 53% of patients in cohorts 1 to 3, respectively.
Patients in cohort 4 experienced higher rates of bladder
toxicity of grade 2þ (61%) than patients in cohort 5 (53%).
However, rates of grade 2þ bladder toxicity at 18 weeks
were low and similar in all cohorts (Fig. 2).
The 2-year cumulative rate of RTOG grade 2þ/grade
3þ bowel toxicity was 8.3% (95% CI 2.7%-24.3%)/
0%, 8.9% (4.1%-18.7%)/1.5% (0.2%-10.4%), and 13.2%
(8.6%-20.2%)/2.2% (0.7%-6.7%) in cohorts 1 to 3 (CFRT),
respectively. In the HFRT cohorts 4 and 5, the 2-year rate of
grade 2þ/grade 3þ bowel toxicity was 16.4% (9.2%-
28.4%)/6.6% (2.5%-16.7%) and 12.2% (7.6%-19.5%)/0.8%
(0.1%-5.7%), respectively (Fig. 3 and Tables E4 and E5
[available online at www.redjournal.org]). A comparable
12.2% (4.7%-29.3%) of postprostatectomy patients expe-
rienced grade 2þ bowel toxicity, with no clear difference
between the cohorts in view of the small numbers included
(Table E6; available online at www.redjournal.org).

(1.1%-7.7%)/2.2% (0.7%-6.8%) in cohorts 1 to 3 (CFRT),
respectively. In cohorts 4 and 5 (HFRT), rates were 4.8%

(0.2%-10.9%),
and
7.3%
(3.9%-
13.6%)/1.2% (0.4%-6.4%), respectively (Fig. 3 and Tables
E4-E6 [available online at www.redjournal.org]). Post-
prostatectomy patients had a higher rate of urinary symp-
toms at 9.0%, albeit with a large CI (3.0%-25.4%), with no
clear differences between cohorts (Table E6; available on-
line at www.redjournal.org).
The prevalence of bowel and bladder toxicity seemed to

0/0 (0%/0%), 1/0 (2%/0%), 5/1 (5%/1%), 3/0 (6%/0%),
and 2/0 (2%/0%) men had grade 2þ/3þ RTOG bowel

 E5 (available online at www.redjournal.org). Table E6
(available online at www.redjournal.org) details rates of
late symptoms in patients treated after prostatectomy.
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) were obtained with the
UCLA-PCI instrument (Tables E4 and E5; available online
at www.redjournal.org). The cumulative 5-year rate of
small or worse bowel/bladder bother was 26% (95% CI
13%-50%)/37% (19%-63%), 49% (37%-63%)/35% (24%-
49%), 38% (30%-48%)/35% (27%-45%), 56% (43%-69%)/
45% (32%-59%), and 54% (44%-64%)/46% (37%-57%) in
cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. Prevalence of moderate/severe
bowel problems at 2 years was 1 of 22 patients (5%), 4 of
47 (9%), 6 of 84 (7%), 4 of 45 (9%), and 10 of 85 (12%) in
cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. Moderate/severe urinary
problems at 2 years were reported by 1 of 22 patients (5%),
5 of 47 (10%), 6 of 85 (7%), 6 of 47 (13%), and 10 of 85
(12%) in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. At 5 years, prevalence
rates for moderate/severe bowel problems were 0 of 12
patients (0%), 1 of 42 (2%), 1 of 76 (1%), 2 of 35 (6%), and
2 of 54 (4%) in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. No severe
bowel problems were reported at 5 years. Prevalence of
moderate/severe urinary problems at 5 years was 0 of 12
patients (0%), 2 of 42 (4%), 6 of 78 (7%), 2 of 35 (6%), and
3 of 57 (5%) in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. No men in the
HFRT cohorts had severe urinary problems at 5 years.
Biochemical or clinical progression occurred in 169 of
426 patients (39.7%). At first relapse, biochemical failure
alone occurred in 141 of 169 patients (59%), local recur-
rence in 11 of 169 patients (7%), distant metastases in 7 of
169 patients (4%), and 3 of 169 patients (2%) commenced
salvage hormone therapy in the absence of radiologic
confirmation of sites of disease. On subsequent follow-up
there were 41 of 426 patients (10%) with confirmed re-
lapses within the prostate, 26 of 426 (6%) with PLN re-
currences, 39 of 426 (9%) with relapses in distant nodal
groups, and 99 of 426 (23%) with relapses at other meta-
static sites. The biochemical/clinical failureefree rate was
71% (95% CI 66%-75%) at 5 years for the whole group,
with 38%, 61%, 70%, 80%, and 78% remaining recurrence
free in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively.
Disease-specific survival at 5 years was 92% (95% CI
89%-94%) for the whole cohort and 79%, 88%, 92%, 97%,
and 95% in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively. The 5-year overall
survival was 87% (95% CI 84%-90%) and 76%, 87%, 86%,
89%, and 91% in cohorts 1 to 5, respectively (Fig. 4).
Multivariate analysis identified pretreatment PSA level
(PZ.004), PLN involvement (PZ.02), T stage (PZ.05),
and dose cohort (PZ.05) as factors associated with dura-
tion of disease control. Patients treated in cohorts 4 and 5
had similar outcomes (Table 2).
Discussion
We found acceptable acute and late GI/genitourinary (GU)
toxicity measured using both clinician-reported outcomes
(CRO) and PRO in all patient cohorts. To assess the impact of
PLNRT, we compared these results with a large contempo-
raneous group of patients treated in the CHHiP phase 3 trial,
which used IMRT to treat the prostate alone using similar
CFRT/HFRT schedules and scored side effects with the same
compendium of CRO and PRO (4). We also used comparable
data reported in a recent systematic review by Holch et al
(19), which included no studies with PLNRT. We found that
acute grade 2þ GI toxicity occurred in 40% to 56% of CFRT
patients in cohorts 1 to 3, compared with 25% in CHHiP and
21% to 60% in Holch et al, with a rate of 66% in cohort 4 (4-
week HFRT), compared with 30% in the CHHiP HFRT group
and 36% in Holch et al. Increasing the overall treatment time
to 5 weeks reduced the rate to 48% in cohort 5. However,
these side effects settled rapidly in all groups. There were no
differences in grade 2þ toxicity by 18 weeks, although some

 increase in mild grade 1þ side-effect rates persisted with
PLNRT (25%-36%, compared with 21% in CHHiP). There
were no clear differences between grade 2þ peak/week-18 or
grade 1þ week-18 GU toxicities among cohorts 1 to 5 or
when comparing with the CHHiP or Holch et al GU toxicity
rates (Table E3; available online at www.redjournal.org).
Late GI side effects seemed highest in cohort 4 using
CRO scales, both 2 and 5 years after treatment. For
example, 2-year estimated cumulative proportions with
grade 2þ (CRO) or small or worse bowel problems (PRO)
were 16%, 16%, 34%, and 53% using the RTOG, RMH,
LENT-SOMA,
and
UCLA-PCI
scales,
respectively,
compared with 8% to 13%, 8% to 15%, 13% to 25%, and
21% to 43% for the other cohorts. The rates for the
comparator CHHiP group were 8% to 9%, 10% to 11%,
16% to 18%, and 25% to 27%, respectively. Applicable
results in the Holch et al systematic review (19) were
similar to those in CHHiP. The increased acute and late GI
toxicity seen in cohort 4 would be consistent with a
consequential late side effect (20, 21). Extending treatment
duration to 5 weeks by treating 4 times per week seems to
reduce any impact of hypofractionation (Tables E4 and E5;
available online at www.redjournal.org).
Late GU side effects, assessed using RTOG and RMH
CRO scales, were similar among all groups, with no
obvious impact from dose, fractionation schedule, or use of
PLNRT. However, the cumulative proportion of patients
with grade 2þ toxicity (LENT-SOMA, CRO) or small or
worse bladder bother (UCLA-PCI, PRO) at 2 years was
somewhat higher than in the CHHiP groups, suggesting
these scales are more sensitive. Any differences had dis-
appeared by 5 years, when the prevalence of small or worse
bladder bother was 8% to 20% in cohorts 1 to 5 and 17% in
the CHHiP comparator group (Tables E4 and E5; available
online at www.redjournal.org).
Late bowel and bladder side effects did not show
consistent differences when the subgroup of patients treated
after prostatectomy was analyzed, either with CRO or PRO
data (Table E6; available online at www.redjournal.org).
However, these results should be interpreted with caution
given that only 34 patients were treated adjuvantly in this
trial, and limited conclusions can be drawn.
The low level of side effects seen in the present series
probably relates to the use of a strict IMRT protocol and the
mandating of dose constraints for both bowel and bladder.
However, the doses delivered in cohorts 3 to 5 are at least
10% higher than used in past and contemporary practice
(Fig. E1; available online at www.redjournal.org). Similar
dose increments have been shown to improve disease
outcome in trials treating the prostate alone (22, 23).
The 5-year overall survival in this series (87%; 95% CI
84%-90%) is at least comparable to a recent retrospective
series from the National Cancer Database, in which 7606
patients were treated with PLNRT, with 5-year overall
survival of 81.6% (24). In the group randomized to PLNRT
in the RTOG 94-13 trial, a 4-year overall survival of 84%
was reported. The 5-year biochemical/clinical failureefree
rate of 71% for our entire series is similar to the control
group treated with radiation therapy in the contempora-
neous MRC STAMPEDE trial, which showed an estimated
75%/50% 5-year control in patients with N0/N1 disease,
respectively (25).
The low PLN recurrence rate of 6% is reassuring, but
further efforts to improve local control in the prostate for
patients with aggressive bulky disease seem warranted
(hazard ratio for local disease control in T3bþ: 1.70, 95%
CI 1.11-2.60; Table 2). Approaches using high-dose focal
radiation therapy boosts, prostatectomy, or additional
ablative focal therapies using, for example, high intensity
focused ultrasound or cryotherapy can be considered (26).
Avoidance of toxicity, however, is important, because a
considerable majority of patients have disease controlled by
IMRT and ADT or, alternatively, relapse with metastatic
disease outside the pelvis, making additional measures to
improve local control futile. The development of bio-
markers to predict the response to radiation therapy and
define patient groups destined to develop metastatic disease
would therefore be invaluable in guiding treatment indi-
vidualization (27). Treatment intensification with additional
systemic treatments, such as docetaxel or the new genera-
tion of hormonal therapies, can be considered (28). Addi-
tionally, radiogenomic and dosimetric studies are aiming to
refine estimates of an individual’s risk of developing side
effects (29, 30).
Conclusion
This study has provided the safety data to encourage further
investigation of high-dose LNRT. The treatment techniques
described have been generalized in a United Kingdom na-

Hypofractionated
radiation
therapy will become the United Kingdom standard of care
after the CHHiP trial (4). The safety data of hypofraction
ated schedules in the present study is encouraging, and the
use of HFRT in a new trial, PIVOTALboost, is planned. It
will assess the value of pelvic IMRT as well as the effects of
a focal high-dose intraprostatic boost to dominant lesions.
These studies will complement other ongoing phase 3
studies, RTOG 09-24 (NCT01368588) and PEACE 2
(NCT01952223), which should finally determine the role of
PLNRT in prostate cancer. An increase in efficacy will need
to be demonstrated to offset the small but expected adverse
effects of pelvic IMRT.
