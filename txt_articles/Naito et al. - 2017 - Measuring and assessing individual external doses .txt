Abstract
After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Iitate
village was placed under an evacuation order because the level of radioactive
materials drifting from the nuclear plant to the village was above a govern-
ment-set level for allowing residents to live in the area. The evacuation
advisory for most of the village was lifted on 31 March 2017. For displaced
residents deciding whether or not to return to their homes, it is important to
correctly understand and estimate the realistic individual external doses they
will receive after returning to the village. In this study, with the support of
residents of the village, we used a personal dosimeter (D-Shuttle) coupled with
a global positioning system device to measure and thus understand realistic
individual external doses while the residents were in Iitate village and to
project the individual external doses for different administrative districts as of
1 April 2017. The measured individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle
for 38 study participants showed that the doses measured during time
spent inside the village were higher and more widely distributed than the

 doses measured during time spent outside the village. The exposure ratio (ER)
was defined as the ratio of additional individual external dose measured by
D-Shuttle to the additional ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring
survey. The medians of the average ERs were 0.13 (min–max 0.06–0.27) for
time spent at home and 0.18 (min–max 0.08–0.36) for time spent outdoors.
Projected additional annual individual external doses as of 1 April 2017 for
different administrative districts in the village were calculated using ERs
obtained in this study. Assuming that individuals spent 8 h per day on outdoor
activities and 16 h on indoor activities, additional annual individual external
doses were estimated to be below 3 mSv using the mean of the average ERs
for most districts in the village, and these values were well below the indi-
vidual external doses estimated using the approach taken by the central gov-
ernment. The results of this study provide valuable information both for
understanding realistic radiological situations in the village and for those who
want to know their future individual external dose in order to make a decision
on whether or not to live in the village.

1. Introduction
In the days and weeks following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (F1NPP)
accident resulting from the East Japan earthquake of 11 March 2011, approximately 85 000
people from 12 municipalities were forced to evacuate from areas within a 20 km radius of
F1NPP (‘Restricted Area’) and heavily contaminated areas outside of this zone (‘Deliberate
Evacuation Area’) [1].
At the end of November 2012, the ‘Restricted Area’ and the ‘Deliberate Evacuation
Area’ were rearranged into three areas (Areas 1, 2 and 3), reflecting the annual cumulative
dose [2]. Area 1 encompasses areas for which evacuation orders are ready to be lifted, Area 2
comprises areas in which residents are not permitted to live, and Area 3 contains areas to
which residents are unlikely to return for a long time. The Ministry of Environment devised a
decontamination plan that would be implemented under the direct supervision of the gov-
ernment and announced the ‘Policy for Decontamination of Special Decontamination Areas’,
which overlaps with the evacuation order areas (‘Decontamination Road Map’; January 2012)
[3]. As of the end of November 2016, decontamination of the majority of the evacuation order
areas was complete, except for Area 3, and the evacuation order for five municipalities had
been lifted [4]. The evacuation order for two municipalities (Kawamata town and Iitate
village) was to be lifted at the end of March 2017 [4]. However, only a limited number of
residents have returned to their original homes in areas for which the evacuation order has
been lifted [5, 6], and their reasons for not returning include limited social infrastructure and
employment opportunities, and a concern regarding radiological conditions [7].
The village of Iitate is located about 40 km northwest of F1NPP and the population of the
village was approximately 6100 in 2010 [8]. The government issued an evacuation order for
the entire village after the F1NPP accident because of high radiation levels. Approximately
90% of the population was evacuated from the village to the areas located within a 1 h radius

607
 of the village, while approximately 10% of the population was evacuated to outside
Fukushima Prefecture [6]. In July 2016, the village offices returned to their functions inside
the village and registered residents were allowed to stay long term in the village. It was
planned for the village to lift the evacuation order, except in zones where the return of
residents is deemed difficult, at the end of March 2017. According to a residents’ awareness
questionnaire survey conducted by the village, approximately 33% of former residents
responded that they currently cannot determine whether or not they would return to the
village, approximately 30% were considering returning to the village, and approximately 27%
had decided not to return to the village [7]. Approximately 60% of the residents responded
that important information that would help them decide whether or not they would return to
the village included the likely future radiation situation and the effectiveness of decontami-
nation efforts [7]. This suggested that radiological conditions in the village remain a concern
to former residents when deciding whether or not to return to the village.
In order for residents to return to their original residential areas after lifting of the evacuation
order it is important to correctly understand and assess realistic individual external doses. Several
studies have attempted to use personal dosimeters along with personal diaries or global posi-
tioning system (GPS) data to understand realistic individual external doses related to time–activity
patterns in Fukushima [9–11]. Our previous studies [10, 11] used a semiconductor silicon per-
sonal dosimeter called ‘D-Shuttle’ (Chiyoda Technol Inc., Tokyo and AIST, Tsukuba, Japan)
together with a GPS and geographical information system (GIS) device to understand these

 external doses and compare them with airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates, mainly
outside the evacuation zones in Fukushima. Only a few attempts have been made to date to
measure and assess individual external doses in the evacuation zones, especially in Area 2, in
Fukushima [12, 13]. Sakumi et al [12] measured the annual individual external dose to indoor
workers in Iitate village and found that the dose for 70% of the workers was estimated to be less
than 2 mSv. These studies contributed valuable information towards understanding realistic
individual external dose levels and their variabilities in relation to the time–activity patterns of
indoor workers for limited areas in Iitate village. However, little attention has been given to
obtaining individual external doses applicable to assessing the future individual external doses of
people with different time–activity patterns living in different districts of the village after lifting of
the evacuation order.
In the current study, we used personal dosimeters (D-Shuttles) along with GPS and GIS
to understand the realistic individual external doses in Iitate village, and to estimate the
potential individual external doses of residents after returning to the village. This information
was based on the relationship between individual external doses, the activity patterns of
individuals and the ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring survey.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study participants and area
Thirty-eight local residents of Iitate village in Fukushima Prefecture participated in our study.
The village remains designated as an Evacuation Advisory Zone, and thus most participants
had lived in the village for only a short period of time as temporary registered residents and
visiting workers prior to the start of the survey. The locations of their original homes are
shown in figure 1. The study was conducted over periods of approximately 5–14 days
between September 2015 and May 2016. The airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates
at the homes of the participants ranged from 0.40–4.23 μSv h−1, based on the 10th Airborne
Monitoring Survey conducted between 12 September and 4 November 2015 [14].

 2.2. Determination of individual external doses, ambient doses and time–activity patterns
Personal dosimeters incorporating GPS receivers with time–activity diaries and a GIS were
used to determine when, where and how much external exposure occurred, based on previous
studies [10, 11]. The devices and methods are briefly described below. D-Shuttle dosimeters
were used to determine the hourly and total external dose (figure 2). Study participants were
instructed to always wear the D-Shuttle on their chest, except when sleeping or bathing, when
the D-Shuttle was to be nearby. Each D-Shuttle consists of a silicon semiconductor and can
measure total dose in the range 0.1 μSv to 99.9999 mSv. The sensitivity of each D-Shuttle
was calibrated with a 137Cs photon source, then tested at the Oharai Research Center, Chiyoda
Technol Corporation prior to use. The values measured by D-Shuttle are expressed as per-
sonal dose equivalent (Hp(10)). Hp(10) values measured under the conditions of the affected
areas in Fukushima are known to be comparable to the effective dose of isotropic (ISO) or
rotational (ROT) irradiation geometries [15, 16]. Consequently, we regarded the individual
external dose measured by D-Shuttle to be a realistic indicator of the effective dose due to
external radiation exposure. Several municipalities in the special decontamination areas in
Fukushima provide a D-Shuttle to each resident to measure and help them understand their
individual external dose. Moreover, D-Shuttle is recognised as a good communication tool for
understanding individual external doses and was used in a study to measure and compare the
individual external doses inside and outside Fukushima Prefecture [17].
The i-gotU device (GT-600, MobileAction Technology Inc., Taiwan), a commercial GPS
receiver with a data logger (figure 2), was used to determine the locations of study volunteers
at short time intervals. i-gotU uses an SiRF Star III low-power chipset with WASS (wide area
augmentation system) and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service)
support. In this study, the i-gotU devices were set to record latitude and longitude every 5 s. In
addition to GPS, self-reported time–activity and location diary data were used to fill any gaps
in the GPS data, and to determine indoor and outdoor positions. The GPS and time–activity
diary data were used to determine the locations and activities of the subjects.
The 10th Airborne Monitoring Survey was used to determine the ambient dose [14]. In
relating the individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle with the ambient dose determined
from the 10th Airborne Monitoring Survey, the values of the ambient dose were adjusted for
the study periods by taking into account physical decay. Both the individual external dose
measured by D-Shuttle and the ambient dose determined on the basis of the 10th Airborne
Monitoring Survey include doses resulting from artificial radionuclides (i.e. 134Cs and 137Cs)
and from natural radionuclides. Estimation of the ambient dose for the individual external
dose measurement was adjusted for the study period, and the physical decay of artificial
radionuclides only was taken into account.
Individual external dose data measured by each D-Shuttle, GPS receiver data with time–
activity diaries and ambient dose rate data were collated into a database by matching the
associated timestamps from each device, thereby integrating the data into a common array
using ESRI ArcGIS 10.2. The collated data were anonymised, then made available for post-
processing and analysis. Individual external dose data were used in this analysis, making it
possible to locate position and relate the ambient dose data.
2.3. Prediction of individual external doses
The exposure ratio (ER) is defined as the ratio of the additional individual external dose rate
to the additional ambient dose rate at the same location, and is expressed as:

where the Individual external dose rate is the personal dose rate measured by D-Shuttle, and
the Ambient dose rate is the estimated average ambient dose rate based on the airborne
monitoring data for the location where the personal dose data were obtained. PDRbk and
ADRbk are the natural background doses for personal dose rate and ambient dose rate,
respectively. We used a value of 0.06 μSv h−1 for PDRbk and 0.04 μSv h−1 for ADRbk [11].
The PDRbk value, 0.06 μSv h−1, is the personal dose estimated from natural sources set by
Chiyoda Technol Corporation as 0.54 mSv year–1. The ADRbk value, 0.04 μSv h−1, is a
national average of ambient dose from natural sources and is the same value as used by the
government [18]. The government has designed the decontamination work and the criteria for
lifting the evacuation orders on the basis of additional individual external dose estimates
using ambient dose levels. Both the individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle and the
ambient dose determined based on the 10th Airborne Monitoring Survey include doses
resulting from artificial radionuclides (i.e. 134Cs and 137Cs) and from natural radionuclides. In
order to be consistent with the existing regulatory approach, we followed the convention of
the additional doses resulting from artificial radionuclides in the current study, unless
otherwise stated.
Future individual external doses were projected by estimating ERhome and ERoutdoor.
ERhome is defined as the ratio of the additional individual external dose rate obtained by
staying at home in the village to the additional ambient dose rate based on the airborne
monitoring data. ERoutdoor is defined as the ratio of the additional individual external dose rate
obtained by staying outdoors in the village to the additional ambient dose rate based on the
airborne monitoring data. The average ERhome and ERoutdoor for each study participant were
determined and used for estimating annual additional individual external dose.
The central government uses the following formula to estimate the annual additional
individual external dose, AAIEDgov (mSv year–1):

where AADR is the additional ambient dose rate in μSv h–1, Tout and Tin are hours spent
outdoors and indoors in a day, respectively, and β is the shielding coefficient, which is
defined as the ratio of the indoor ambient dose rate to the outdoor ambient dose rate at the
same location. AADR is calculated by subtracting the natural background dose, which is
assumed to be 0.04 μSv h−1, from the ambient dose rate (μSv h–1). The central government
uses 8, 16 and 0.4 for Tout, Tin and β, respectively [18]. Referring to equation (2), we used the
following formula to estimate the annual additional individual external dose, AAIEDest (mSv

home, respectively, as defined above. The prospective individual external doses in Iitate
village will be calculated from the estimated ambient dose rate on 1 April 2017 determined by
considering only the physical decay of
134Cs and
137Cs based on the 10th Airborne
Monitoring Survey data. Details of the prospective ambient dose rate calculation are provided
elsewhere [19].

 Variabilities in the ambient dose rates in the residential areas were taken into account to
provide distributions of annual additional individual external doses for different adminis-
trative districts in the village. Variabilities in the ambient dose rates were expressed using
dwelling locations of the potential inhabitants of Iitate village defined by the 500 m mesh
population data from the 2010 population census [20]. The number of data points used to
estimate the distributions of the annual additional individual external doses for each
administrative district correspond to the population size of Iitate village defined by the 2010
population census [20].
2.4. Ethics
This study was approved by the Committee for Ergonomic Experiments at the National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects prior to conducting the study.
3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the measured individual external doses
Thirty-one residents participated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and seven in the second quarter
of 2016 (table 1). The majority of the participants in the former group were visiting workers
whereas the participants in the latter group were registered residents who were staying
temporarily. The dosimeters of the 38 participants provided 10 366 individual external dose
data points, expressed as μSv h−1. The mean hourly individual external dose measured by
D-Shuttle ranged between 0.09 and 0.38 μSv h−1 for all study periods, 0.09 and 0.58 μSv h−1
for time spent inside the village, and 0.08 and 0.16 μSv h−1 for time spent outside the village.
Distributions of hourly individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle from study partici-
pants for time spent inside the village and for time spent outside the village are presented in
figure 3. The median (min–max) of the individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle was
0.19 (0.01–2.43, N = 4046) μSv h−1 for time spent inside the village and 0.09 (0.01–0.63,

information were used for this analysis.

 N = 3268) μSv h−1 for time spent outside the village. Compared with the hourly individual
external doses for time spent outside the village, those for time spent inside the village were
higher and widely distributed. However, there was much overlap between the distributions.
Statistically significant differences were observed for all study participants when individual
external doses obtained for time spent inside the village were compared with those for time
spent outside the village (data not shown).
3.2. Location-specific exposure ratios in the village
The relationships between the average additional individual external dose measured by
D-Shuttle and the average additional ambient dose estimated based on the airborne mon-
itoring survey for time spent at home and outdoors in the village are presented in figure 4.
Individual external dose data made it possible to locate the position of the participant for that
data point and relate the ambient dose data to location in this analysis. We observed a
significant positive correlation between the average additional ambient dose and the addi-
tional individual external dose for both cases (p < 0.001). The regression line shows that the
average additional individual external doses were approximately 0.15 and 0.18 times the
average additional ambient doses obtained while at home and while outdoors, respectively.
The ER was calculated using the average additional external dose and the average
additional ambient dose of each participant. The median values of the average ERs were 0.13
(min–max 0.06–0.27) for time spent at home and 0.18 (min–max 0.08–0.36) for time spent
outdoors. The average ERs for time spent outdoors exhibit large variations.
The relationships between the ERs and the average additional ambient dose estimated
based on the airborne monitoring survey for time spent at home and outdoors in the village
are shown in figure 5. We observed no correlation between the average additional ambient

outdoors (r = 0.13, p = 0.49).

 3.3. Estimation of annual additional individual external doses for 20 administrative districts in
the village
Figures 6(a) and (b) show the annual additional individual external dose, AAIEDest (mSv
year–1), projected for 1 April 2017 using the mean and maximum of the average ER values
obtained from the estimated ambient dose rates of residential areas for 20 administrative
districts in the village. The number of residents in the year 2010 and the airborne-based
ambient doses for the locations of homes in each district were incorporated into this estimate.
The values of AAIEDest for the majority of the administrative districts were less than 3 mSv
using the mean of the average ERs, which is defined by the regression coefficients in figure 4
and 5 mSv using the maximum of the average ERs. Nagadoro district (no. 15) is designated as
a ‘difficult to return zone’ (Area 3) and showed the highest AAIEDest average of 5.3 mSv
using mean ERs and 9.0 mSv using maximum ERs. The percentages of AAIEDest exceeding
5 mSv to potential inhabitants were estimated to be approximately 65% for Nagadoro
(no. 15), 4% for Hiso (no. 14) and 1% for Warabidaira (no. 16) using mean ERs. Using
maximum ERs, the proportions of AAIEDest exceeding 5 mSv to potential inhabitants were
estimated to be 100% for Nagadoro (no. 15), approximately 88% for Warabidaira (no. 16),
20% for Hiso (no. 14), 18% for Komiya (no. 5), 7% for Maeta/Yawaki (no. 11), 6% for
Iitoimachi (Kuboso) (no. 10b) and 4% for Sekisawa (no. 4).
4. Discussion
4.1. Differences between individual external doses inside and outside the village
Overall, individual external doses obtained during time spent inside the village were widely
distributed and higher than those obtained outside the village, as the latter areas generally
have lower radiation levels. Comparisons between individual external doses measured by
D-Shuttle inside and outside Iitate village appeared to show overlaps in these distributions.

spent at home and outdoors in the village.

 This can be explained by the activity patterns of individuals while in the village and the
effectiveness of decontamination efforts.
Some of the study participants intended to stay inside their home or in well-deconta-
minated areas while in the village. To date, decontamination of most of the residential areas in
the village is complete and in most cases this has efficiently decreased the ambient dose rates,
resulting in individual external doses in the village being comparable to those outside the
village. However, individual external doses of some of participants were relatively higher
while in the village. According to their time–activity diaries, these individuals spent more
time in the garden outside their house or in less decontaminated areas.

 Our results suggest that, consistent with previous studies [9–11], individual external
doses can be attributed to the time–activity patterns and locations of individuals and the
ambient dose level (e.g. decontamination conditions) of different locations in the village.
4.2. Variabilities in exposure ratios
For practical reasons, we used the airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates to calculate
exposure ratios (ER). The airborne monitoring data were obtained using high-sensitivity
radiation detectors installed on helicopters: second-by-second measurements are taken of
gamma rays emitted from radioactive substances deposited in circles with a diameter
approximately twice the flight altitude (target altitude 150–300 m) and centred around ground
locations directly below the flight trajectory [21]. The airborne monitoring data were con-
sidered as the average value of radiation in a circle of radius 300 m on the ground [21].
Therefore, airborne monitoring-based ambient dose rates may be either over- or under-
estimates of the actual ambient dose rates measured on the ground near the locations of
individuals. According to previous studies, the individual external dose measured by
D-Shuttle, expressed as Hp(10) values, in affected areas in Fukushima were comparable with
the ISO or ROT irradiation geometries [15, 16]. In addition, the values of Hp(10) were about
0.7 times that of the ambient dose rate, expressed as H*(10), if the measurements were
conducted under outdoor field conditions in affected areas in Fukushima [22]. ERs estimated
in this study, which ranged from 0.06 to 0.27 for time spent at home and from 0.08 to 0.36 for
time spent outdoors, were well below the reported value of 0.7. This discrepancy is due to
several factors, such as the effect of decontamination, the behaviour and location of indivi-
duals and the shielding effects of buildings. A detailed discussion of this issue can be found
elsewhere [11].
Naito et al [11] investigated the relationship between personal dose and ambient dose,
mainly in non-evacuation zones of Fukushima. They estimated the mean values of ERs for
time spent at home and for time spent outdoors to be 0.16 (min–max 0.03–0.42) and 0.32
(min–max 0.01–0.80), respectively. Comparison with the ERs obtained in this study shows
similar values for time spent at home, whereas the current ER values for time spent outdoors
were on average about half those reported in the previous study. This may be due to the
decrease in ambient dose rates in residential areas resulting from decontamination efforts. The
airborne monitoring system did not detect this decrease and thus contributed to measurements
of lower individual external dose, which in turn provided relatively lower ER values for time
spent outdoors in Iitate village. Furthermore, about half of the study participants were visiting
workers and included members of the village security patrol, construction workers and out-
door workers. Individuals in the village security patrol were walking or riding in a car during
duty hours and this study considered these duty hours as time spent outdoors in the village.
However, a car provides shielding against radiation and thus time spent inside a car will
decrease the individual external dose rate. Consequently, the individual external dose data
obtained outdoors in the village may be lower than values obtained for time spent in actual
outdoor activities.
4.3. Comparisons with annual additional external doses estimated using the government-
proposed formula
The central government proposed a simple model that converts the ambient dose rate in
μSv h–1 to an annual additional external dose, assuming that 8 h are spent on outdoor
activities and 16 h on indoor activities [18]. The model provides a conservative estimate of the
J. Radiol. Prot. 37 (2017) 606
W Naito et al
618
 annual additional individual external dose that would be received by a ‘reference’ individual
living in an area with a given measured ambient dose rate. This model has been used to
determine areas requiring decontamination and evacuation. In a very simple expression, the
additional dose from the ambient dose is calculated by multiplying the ambient dose by a
conversion factor of 0.6.
Evidence indicates that the true additional dose from external irradiation may be well
below the estimated additional dose calculated by this simple model [10, 11, 23–25]. Con-
sistent with the assumption of time occupancy used in the central government model, our
results estimated the additional annual individual external dose to be on average 1.0–5.3 mSv
using the mean ERs and 1.2–9.0 mSv using the maximum ERs. On the other hand, the
additional annual individual dose estimated using the simple model proposed by the central
government was on average between 2.4 and 18.1 mSv if the same airborne monitoring data
were used.
This suggests that the additional annual individual external doses estimated in our study
were approximately 1/4 for the mean ERs and 1/2 for the maximum ERs of those estimated
using the simple model proposed by the central government. It is difficult to change the
existing approach to regulatory dose assessment. Realistic individual external dose estima-
tions, however, can be an important issue for those considering whether or not to return to
their original home after the lifting of an evacuation order.
In the rehabilitation stage, it is important to accurately understand or estimate realistic
individual external doses so that individuals can make informed decisions based on radi-
ological protection to return to restricted areas or not. The government has recently stressed
the importance of considering individual external dose data collected from personal dosi-
meters. Accurate information on individual external doses is needed by government policy-
makers, by people providing advice on health care and radiation dose mitigation, and
especially by affected residents. Our results provide valuable information for predicting
additional annual external doses following the return of residents to their homes in the
evacuation order areas in Fukushima.
In our assessment of additional annual individual external doses, we followed the pre-
vious assumption of 8 h of outdoor and 16 h of indoor activities. These fractions of the day
spent in each location were reported to be different from actual time fractions [9, 26]. The
fraction of time spent outdoors varied widely, and in many cases 8 h is likely to be an over-
estimate [26]. If an individual spends most of his or her time indoors, the decrease in time
spent outdoors would generally result in a decrease in the annual additional individual
external dose. This suggests that understanding the specific time–activity patterns of the daily
lives of people in the village would allow the formulation of realistic radiation exposure
scenarios, which in turn would lead to an examination of the need for further radiation
reduction measures.
4.4. Data needs
In Iitate village, collecting ‘Sansai’, edible wild plants, and wild mushrooms is an important
and traditional seasonal event for many people. The number of people collecting ‘Sansai’ and
mushrooms significantly decreased since the F1DPP incident due to concerns about radiation
effects from internal and external doses in Kawauchi village, where the evacuation order was
lifted for all areas of the village in 2016. What would be the additional individual external
dose obtained when collecting wild plants and mushrooms in the mountains? What is the
relationship between ambient dose rate and personal dose rate in non-decontaminated
mountains? What is the additional individual external dose when working in agricultural
J. Radiol. Prot. 37 (2017) 606
W Naito et al
619
 fields in the village? Data to answer these questions are indispensable for improving realistic
dose assessment, for understanding radiological conditions and for adopting protective
measures for everyday life in the village.
5. Conclusions
We used D-Shuttle personal dosimeters, along with GPS and GIS, to measure and assess
individual external doses in the village of Iitate. Although the individual external doses
obtained inside the village were higher on average than those obtained outside the village, the
former data were widely distributed and there was a large overlap between the distributions of
individual external doses obtained inside and outside the village. Our results showed that the
magnitude of individual external doses was influenced by the time–activity patterns and
locations of individuals in the village.
The ER for time spent outdoors in the village was found to be on average 0.18, which is
lower than the value obtained in a previous study. This suggests that decontamination efforts
in the village have been effective in reducing ambient dose rates around inhabited areas,
which in turn has reduced individual external doses.
Predictions of additional annual individual external dose following the return of residents
to their homes in different administrative districts in the village were estimated to range on
average between 1.0 and 5.3 mSv using mean ERs and 1.2 and 9.0 mSv using maximum ERs,
assuming 8 h of outside activities and 16 h of inside activities. The estimates of additional
annual individual external doses in the present study were far lower than the values estimated
using the government-proposed approach. The government-proposed approach may have
been appropriate in the absence of actual measurement data during the initial stages following
the accident. However, in the rehabilitation stage, it is important to understand or estimate
realistic individual external doses for those who want to make decisions based on their
radiological protection or to return to restricted areas.
The individual external dose is not the sole determinant for deciding whether or not to
return to the evacuation zone after lifting of the evacuation order, but is one of the most
important factors. The results of the current study provide valuable information for under-
standing the actual radiological situation in Iitate village, and for those wanting to know their
future individual external dose in order to make an informed decision regarding whether or
not to live in the village.
