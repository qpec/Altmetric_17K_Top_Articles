ABSTRACT
The capacity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to host jump from animal res-
ervoir species to humans presents an ongoing pandemic threat. Birds and swine are
considered major reservoirs of viral genetic diversity, whereas equines and canines
have historically been restricted to one or two stable IAV lineages with no transmis-
sion to humans. Here, by sequencing the complete genomes of 16 IAVs obtained
from canines in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region [Guangxi]) in
2013 to 2015, we demonstrate that the evolution of canine influenza viruses (CIVs)
in Asian dogs is increasingly complex, presenting a potential threat to humans. First,
two reassortant H1N1 virus genotypes were introduced independently from swine
into canines in Guangxi, including one genotype associated with a zoonotic infec-
tion. The genomes contain segments from three lineages that circulate in swine in
China: North American triple reassortant H3N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, and pan-
demic H1N1. Furthermore, the swine-origin H1N1 viruses have transmitted onward
in canines and reassorted with the CIV-H3N2 viruses that circulate endemically in
Asian dogs, producing three novel reassortant CIV genotypes (H1N1r, H1N2r, and
H3N2r [r stands for reassortant]). CIVs from this study were collected primarily from
pet dogs presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics, but dogs in
Guangxi are also raised for meat, and street dogs roam freely, creating a more com-
plex ecosystem for CIV transmission. Further surveillance is greatly needed to under-
stand the full genetic diversity of CIV in southern China, the nature of viral emer-
gence and persistence in the region’
s diverse canine populations, and the zoonotic
risk as the viruses continue to evolve.
IMPORTANCE
Mammals have emerged as critically underrecognized sources of in-
fluenza virus diversity, including pigs that were the source of the 2009 pandemic
and bats and bovines that harbor highly divergent viral lineages. Here, we identify
two reassortant IAVs that recently host switched from swine to canines in southern
China, including one virus with known zoonotic potential. Three additional geno-
types were generated via reassortment events in canine hosts, demonstrating the
capacity of dogs to serve as “mixing vessels.” The continued expansion of IAV diver-
sity in canines with high human contact rates requires enhanced surveillance and
ongoing evaluation of emerging pandemic threats.

nfluenza A viruses (IAVs) are segmented single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses that
infect a wide range of host species. At this time, wild aquatic birds are considered the
primary natural reservoir host, from which novel viral lineages are periodically intro-
duced into mammalian species, including humans, swine, equines, canines, and seals
(1). Sixteen subtypes based on the primary antigen, hemagglutinin (H1 to H16), have
been identified in wild birds, only two of which (H1 and H3) are currently established
in mammals (humans, swine, canines, and horses). Human infections with avian H5 and
H7 viruses have caused hundreds of deaths in Asia (2, 3), but so far, these viruses have
not acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission (4). However, H7 viruses
were prevalent in horses until their replacement by H3 viruses, indicating that these
viruses are able to establish infection cycles in mammals (5). Surveillance of IAVs is far
greater in humans and birds than in other mammalian host species, and the origins of
the 2009 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm [pdm stands for pandemic]) in swine in
Mexico underscore the threat presented by understudied mammalian populations in
regions where viral diversity has been undetected for many years (6).
The canine respiratory tract contains both types of sialic acid receptors used by IAVs
(�2,3- and �2,6-linked) (7). Dogs emerged as important IAV hosts in the 2000s, when
IAV lineages in canines became established independently on two continents. H3N8
viruses were introduced from horses into canines in the United States (8), and H3N2
was introduced from birds into canines in Asia (9). Sustained transmission of the H3N8
lineage in U.S. canines occurs primarily in dog shelters with high rates of animal
turnover (canine influenza virus H3N8 [CIV-H3N8]) (10). Equine H3N8 viruses were also
transmitted to dogs in Australia and the United Kingdom, but transmission was not
sustained (11, 12). The H3N2 lineage still circulates endemically in Asian dogs (CIV-
H3N2), with reported cases in South Korea (13), Thailand (14), and multiple provinces
in China (9, 15–17). A survey of canines in Guangdong Province in China reported that
~15% of farmed dogs and ~5% of pet dogs had antibodies in their serum to CIV-H3N2
(18). In 2015, CIV-H3N2 viruses were identified in U.S. dogs following a viral importation
event from Asia (19). Multiple reassortant IAV genotypes have been identified in
canines in Asia (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), including an H3N1 virus that
acquired an N1 segment from a human H1N1pdm virus in South Korea (20). Reassort-
ment between CIV-H3N2 and avian H5N1 viruses may also have occurred (21). Multiple
avian virus segments have been identified in dogs, including H5N1, H6N1, and H9N2
(22–24), but the extent of onward transmission remains unknown. There are many
outstanding questions concerning the genetic diversity, onward transmission, and
spatial distribution of CIVs in Asia, but at the time of this study, only 54 full-length
hemagglutinin (HA) sequences from CIVs in Asia were available in GenBank.
The expansion of the genetic diversity of CIVs since the 2000s has drawn compar-
isons to swine, which are considered key mammalian “mixing vessel” hosts. Swine
sustain multiple IAV lineages acquired from human and avian hosts that exchange
genome segments during coinfection via reassortment (25). The H1N1pdm virus pro-
vides a prime example of the mixing vessel capacity of pigs, as the pandemic virus
genome contained segments from three different swine virus (IAV-S) lineages (26): (i)
“classical” swine viruses (CswH1) that emerged during the 1918 H1N1 “Spanish flu” in
North American pigs (27), (ii) the Eurasian avian-origin (EAswH1) lineage that originated
in European swine in the 1970s (28), and (iii) “triple reassortant” swine H3N2 viruses
(TRswH3) that were generated by reassortment events between avian, human, and
swine viruses in North American swine in the mid-1990s (29). CswH1, EAswH1, and
TRswH3 viruses all cocirculate in pigs in China, which has the world’
s largest swine
population (almost half a billion) and was initially considered a possible source of the
H1N1pdm virus (26, 30). The identification of a progenitor virus of H1N1pdm in swine
in Mexico was unexpected (6), but it does not diminish the pandemic risk presented by
the large reservoir of IAV diversity in China’
s swine, which only continues to expand
following recent introductions of H1N1pdm viruses from humans (31, 32).
Opportunities for interspecies transmission of IAVs abound in southern China, where
diverse species are often raised in proximity and intermingle at live-animal markets. In

 China’
s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), dogs are kept as pets, roam as
street dogs, and are raised for meat, providing opportunities for contact between
canines and humans as well as other IAV host species at live-animal markets. Guangxi
is located in southern China, bordering Guangdong Province and Vietnam (Fig. 1A),
with a human population approaching 50 million. To further understand the genetic
diversity of CIVs in this critically understudied region, we analyzed the presence of IAVs
collected from dogs in Guangxi in 2013 to 2015, mainly from pet dogs presenting with
respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics. The complete genomes were sequenced for
16 isolated viruses (GenBank accession numbers MG254059 to MG254185). This re-
sulted in the identification of five novel reassortant CIV genotypes that have not been
previously described in canines, highlighting the capacity of dogs to serve ecologically
as mixing vessels for reassortment between IAV lineages from multiple diverse host
species.
RESULTS
CIVs identified in canines in Guangxi, China. From 2013 to 2015, 800 nasal swabs
were collected from canines presenting primarily with respiratory symptoms at veter-
inary clinics in 11 of the 14 prefectures in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
(Guangxi) (Fig. 1B). Of the 800 samples, 116 (14.5%) tested positive for influenza virus
by PCR (Table 1). The influenza virus-positive animals were primarily pets (115/116) (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material). Most were pure breeds, including Alaskan
malamute (n � 16), bichon frise (n � 3), border collie (n � 3), chihuahua (n � 3),
German shepherd (n � 7), golden retriever (n � 9), Siberian husky (n � 6), and poodle
(n � 20). The majority of influenza virus-positive animals (~67%) were young dogs less
than 1 year of age (median age of 5.5 months; range, 34 days to 9 years of age). The

 age profile of the influenza virus-positive animals did not differ significantly from
influenza virus-negative animals (median age of 4 months; range, 2 days to 15 years).
Twelve influenza virus-positive animals were rural Chinese dogs, including a 3-year-old
female that died during treatment. It is unclear whether the death was caused by
influenza. Approximately 70% (81/116) of the canines that tested positive presented
with respiratory symptoms. Other animals presented with diarrhea, fever, vomiting, or
injuries. Seven of the influenza virus-positive dogs were otherwise healthy. The first
influenza virus-positive samples were identified in Liuzhou prefecture in April 2013
(Fig. 1C and Table S1). The first successfully isolated virus was collected from a
2-month-old female Samoyed presenting with respiratory symptoms in the Wuzhou
district in October 2013 (Table 2).

 Influenza virus-positive samples were identified in 9 of the 11 sampled prefectures
and in each of the 3 years of sampling (2013 to 2015). Sampling was not conducted
evenly across prefectures or across time (Fig. 1C and Table S2), so the percentage of
positive samples in a location (Table 1) is likely to be biased and not appropriate for
quantitative spatial-temporal comparisons. Sampling was conducted in multiple veter-
inary clinics in two prefectures (Nanning and Liuzhou), which explains the larger
number of samples available from these locations (Fig. 1C). Sixteen viruses (2.0%) from
seven prefectures spanning multiple regions of Guangxi were successfully isolated, and
the whole genomes of the viruses were sequenced (Fig. 1B and Table 2). CIVs were
isolated from five prefectures in the fall of 2013: Wuzhou (WZ), Hechi (HC), Fangcheng-
gang (FCG), Qinzhou (QZ), and Liuzhou (LZ) (Fig. 2B). In 2014, CIVs were isolated in two
additional prefectures: Chongzuo (CZ) and Nanning (NN). In 2015, CIVs were again
isolated in Liuzhou and Nanning.

CIV-H3N2r, and CIV-H1N2r (Fig. 2A). Nine viruses had the CIV-H1N1(sw1) genotype
(Table 2). A 10th virus [A/canine/Guangxi/PX11/2014(HxN1)] had seven segments,
similar to CIV-H1N1(sw1), and clustered phylogenetically with a swine virus with a
CIV-H1N1(sw1)-like genotype (Fig. S2), but the hemagglutinin (HA) was not sequenced.
CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses (EE-PPPPPT) have HA and neuraminidase (NA) segments from
the EAswH1 lineage, a nonstructural (NS) segment from the TRswH3 lineage, and the
remaining five internal gene segments from the PDMswH1 lineage (Fig. 2A). Three
viruses were identified with the CIV-H1N1(sw2) genotype (EE-PPPPET), which is similar
to CIV-H1N1(sw1), except the matrix protein (MP) segment is derived from the EAswH1
lineage. The CIV-H1N1r genotype (EE-PPPPPC) is similar to CIV-H1N1(sw1), except the
NS segment was acquired from the CIV-H3N2 lineage. The CIV-H3N2r genotype (CC-
PPPPC) is similar to CIV-H1N1r, but this virus also acquired HA and NA segments from
CIV-H3N2 viruses. The CIV-H1N2r genotype (EC-CCCCCC) has seven segments from
CIV-H3N2 viruses, and an HA from the EAswH1 lineage.
Interspecies transmission of IAVs from swine to canines. For two of these
genotypes [CIV-H1N1(sw1) and CIV-H1N1(sw2)], all eight segments were derived from
IAV-S lineages (EAswH1, PDMswH1, and TRswH3) that cocirculate in swine in southern
China, which includes Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Guangdong Provinces. As inferred
from time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees, the EAswH1 lineage was
introduced from swine in Europe into China in the 2000s (Fig. 3A). The TRswH3 lineage
was introduced from swine in North America into China in the late 1990s. H1N1pdm
viruses were introduced from humans into swine in southern China multiple times in
the 2010s.

 and ferrets, was observed in phylogenies inferred for all segments of the IAV genome
(exemplified by the polymerase basic protein 2 [PB2] segment in Fig. 4A and summa-
rized quantitatively across the entire viral genome using “Markov jump” counts in
Fig. 4B). An estimate of the number of state transitions across phylogenies inferred for
all IAV segments (“Markov jump” counts) indicates that H1N1pdm viruses were inde-
pendently introduced from humans into swine populations in China, Japan, and South
Korea at least 52 times, and at least 25 of these introductions occurred in southern
China (Fig. 4B). Following their entry into the swine population, H1N1pdm viruses
underwent frequent reassortment events with other viruses in swine, generating at
least 14 new genotypes in swine in southern China (Fig. 3B). The vast majority of these
genotypes acquired H1N1pdm internal gene segments, but not HA or NA. Four
genotypes have evidence of sustained onward transmission in swine in southern China
(Fig. 3C). Two genotypes also transmitted onward from swine to canines in Guangxi:
CIV-H1N1(sw1) and CIV-H1N1(sw2) (Fig. 3D). Swine viruses with an EE-PPPPET genotype
similar to CIV-H1N1(sw2) also transmitted from swine to a human in Hunan Province,
as well as to swine in China’
s northern province of Shandong (Fig. 3D).
Although H1N1pdm viruses of human origin emerged in swine in southern China
multiple times independently, all CIVs identified in Guangxi canines, regardless of their
genotype, descend from a single clade of IAV-S viruses that traces its evolutionary
origins to a discrete introduction of H1N1pdm viruses from humans to pigs during the
2009–2010 pandemic (Fig. 4A). This swine clade is also associated with zoonotic
transmission to a human and with long-distance spatial dissemination to swine in other
regions of China. Although the human virus [A/Hunan/42443/2015(H1N1)] is positioned
within the same clade as canine viruses with the same genotype, the human virus is
more closely related to the swine viruses and appears to represent swine-to-human,
rather than canine-to-human, transmission (Fig. 5). Hunan Province borders Guangxi to
the northeast (Fig. 3D).
CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses in canines are not monophyletic but rather are interspersed
with swine viruses with the same genotype (Fig. 5), evidence that CIV-H1N1(sw1)-like
viruses were likely introduced from swine into canines multiple times. Only three
CIV-H1N1(sw2) viruses were identified in canines, but these also are not monophyletic,
again consistent with multiple independent swine-to-canine transmission events in-
volving this genotype (Fig. 5). An estimate of the number of “Markov jump” counts
indicates that at least five swine-to-canine transmission events occurred involving
CIV-H1N1(sw1) and CIV-H1N1(sw2) viruses (Fig. 4B).
Transmission of CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses in canines. The small number of viruses
sequenced for this study (n � 16) limits our ability to identify sustained viral transmis-
sion chains of novel CIVs in canines in southern China. The best evidence for sustained
viral transmission in canines over multiple years is for the CIV-H1N1(sw1) genotype,
based on the well-supported clustering of CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses collected in 2013 with
a CIV-H1N1(sw1) virus collected in 2015 [A/canine/Guangxi/LZ56/2015(H1N1)] (trans-
mission cluster number 1 in Fig. 5; Fig. S2). Additional clusters of CIVs collected in the
same year were also observed, evidence of at least short chains (�1 year) of onward
viral transmission in canines in 2013 (transmission cluster number 2 in Fig. 5) and
possibly in 2015 (Fig. 5). The close phylogenetic relationship between CIV-H1N1(sw1)
viruses and novel reassortants such as CIV-H1N1r and CIV-H1N2r (Fig. 5 and Fig. S2)
suggests that onward transmission of CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses in canines facilitated the
reassortment events between newly emerged CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses and endemic
CIV-H3N2 viruses.
Multiple reassortment events with CIV-H3N2 viruses in canine hosts. Three new
CIV genotypes (CIV-H1N1r, CIV-H3N2r, and CIV-H1N2r [Fig. 2A]) were generated by
reassortment events in canines between the newly introduced swine-origin viruses and
CIV-H3N2 viruses endemic in Asian canines (Fig. 4B). All three reassortant viruses cluster
with CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses on the phylogenies (Fig. 4A, 5, S2, and S3), indicating that
the reassortment events likely occurred between CIV-H3N2 and CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses

 cocirculating in canines in Guangxi. The swine/canine reassortants were not identified
until December 2014, indicating that CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses may have circulated in
canines in Guangxi for up to a year before undergoing reassortment with CIV-H3N2. At
this time, it is not possible to determine whether CIV-H1N1r, CIV-H3N2r, and CIV-H1N2r
viruses continue to circulate in canines, as only one virus has been isolated for each
genotype.
A phylogenetic analysis of all available CIV-H3N2 sequences determined that
long-distance movements have repeatedly spread the virus between locations in Asia
since it was first isolated from a canine in Guangdong, China, in 2006. Since 2006,
CIV-H3N2 viruses have disseminated throughout eastern Asia, spanning a distance of
�2,600 miles from Thailand in the south to China’
s Heilongjiang Province in the north
(Fig. 6). In the N2 phylogeny, the CIV-H3N2r and CIV-H1N2r viruses isolated in this study
from Guangxi cluster together within a larger clade of CIV-H3N2 viruses, including
those from neighboring Guangdong (Fig. 6). An isolate from Thailand [A/canine/
Thailand/CU-DC5299/2012(H3N2)] is also positioned in this clade, indicating that this
virus may have been an import from southern China (Fig. 6). In contrast, the clade of
CIV-H3N2 viruses isolated from the United States clusters with viruses from South
Korea, consistent with importation from South Korea, as suggested in prior studies (33).
CIV-H3N2 viruses were isolated from felines on four occasions in three locations (South
Korea, Guangdong, and Heilongjiang), but with no evidence of onward dissemination
in feline hosts. Viral movements within China were observed frequently, whereas viral
migrations between countries occurred only sporadically. Sampling of CIV-H3N2 in Asia
is too low to warrant strong conclusions about spatial dynamics within Asia, and it
remains unclear whether the CIV-H3N2 virus originated in Guangdong, where the virus
was first isolated in canines, or in South Korea, where the most closely related viruses
were identified in birds.
Molecular characteristics of CIV. The CIVs identified in Guangxi have features
similar to those of CIV-H3N2 and CIV-H3N8 viruses, including a truncated PA-X protein
that has evolved independently in canine and swine lineages (34) (Table 3). The
evolutionary origins of the truncated PA-X observed in CIVs in Guangxi can be traced
back to TRswH3 viruses in swine in North America, and the truncated protein emerged
in canines in China by way of multiple interspecies and migration events (Fig. 7). All
CIV-H1N1 viruses have the S31N substitution in the M2 ion channel that is associated
with resistance to adamantane antiviral drugs, since the matrix protein was either
derived from PDMswH1 viruses [CIV-H1N1(sw1), CIV-H1N1r, and CIV-H3N2r] or EAswH1
viruses [CIV-H1N1(sw2)], and both lineages have the S31N substitution. The CIV-H1N1
viruses have a neuraminidase protein that is sensitive to oseltamivir antiviral drugs
(H275 in the NA), since the NA segment derives from PDMswH1 viruses that obtained
an oseltamivir-sensitive NA from EAswH1 viruses. Similar to other CIV lineages, the
CIV-H1N1 viruses do not have the E627K substitution in the PB2 that increases repli-
cation efficiency in mammals (35). A complete list of amino acid changes defining the
CIV-H3N2, CIV-H3N8, and CIV-H1N1 lineages is provided in Table S3.

 DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates the capacity of canines in southern China to serve as
reservoirs for the evolution of novel reassortant IAVs. Importantly, we identified two
viruses of swine origin that were introduced into canines in Guangxi, China: CIV-
H1N1(sw1) and CIV-H1N1(sw2). CIV-H1N1(sw1) viruses were more frequently identified

 five genotypes continue to transmit in dogs in Guangxi, whether the viruses have
disseminated to other regions of China, and whether additional reassortant genotypes
have been generated.
The emergence of novel reassortant IAVs in swine and canines in Guangxi can be
traced to the recent expansion of the genetic diversity of IAV-S in swine herds in
southern China that began in the 2010s following multiple introductions of H1N1pdm
viruses from humans. The interspecies transmission of H1N1pdm viral segments be-
tween humans, swine, and canines in southern China provides another example of the
wide-ranging impact of reverse zoonosis on the ecology and evolution of influenza
viruses, including those with zoonotic potential. Although the reverse zoonotic trans-
mission of H1N1pdm has expanded IAV-S diversity in many countries (37–41), the
United States and China are the only countries thus far where novel swine viruses with
H1N1pdm segments have transmitted from swine back to humans. In the United States,
more than 400 infections of humans with swine-origin H3N2v viruses have been
observed since 2011 (42), including 50 in 2017. Although the number of observed
zoonotic transmission events is much lower in China, the detection of rare events is
highly sensitive to the strength and scope of surveillance in humans in a given location.
Evolutionarily, several similarities were observed between the zoonotic transmission
event in China and the spillovers of H3N2v variants that have occurred between U.S.
swine and humans (Fig. 8). In both countries, widespread reverse zoonotic transmission
of H1N1pdm viruses from humans to swine facilitated the evolution of novel reas-
sortant IAVs in commercial swine, which served as primary mixing vessels for reassort-
ment between IAV lineages of different origins. In the United States, transmission to
humans was facilitated by exhibition swine, which served as additional mixing vessels
for reassortment, and as intermediary hosts with high contact rates with humans.
Canines, similar to U.S. exhibition swine, could serve dual roles as (i) mixing vessel hosts
that actively generate new viruses via reassortment and (ii) intermediary hosts with the
capacity to transmit viral diversity generated in commercial swine onward to humans.
Consumption of dogs for meat is still practiced in Guangxi and other areas in Asia,
raising questions about the underlying ecology of CIVs in this region and the need for
additional surveillance in canine populations not typically seen at veterinary clinics.

 Although pet dogs presenting at veterinary clinics exhibited relatively high rates of IAV
infection in Guangxi (~15%), it is possible that the pet population is not primarily
responsible for the virus’
s persistence, and these infections could be mostly ongoing
spillovers from a permanent viral reservoir maintained in dogs raised at higher densities
for sale at live-animal markets, strays/street dogs, or both. In the United States,
transmission of CIV-H3N8 is largely maintained in dog shelters with high rates of animal
turnover, and spillover events into the pet population are generally not sustained (R0
hovers around 1) (43). In Asia, dogs raised for consumption may serve similarly as
reservoirs. However, CIV dynamics may be even more complex in Asia, where canine
populations comprise multiple overlapping networks of street dogs, dogs raised for
consumption, and a pet dog population that has been increasing rapidly since the
1980s, when having a pet dog in China was considered Western bourgeoisie and
forbidden. Over time, increased pet ownership in China has eroded public acceptance

 of long-standing customs of consuming dogs for meat, particularly in urban areas. In
Taiwan, both the sale and consumption of dog meat were recently banned. Each June,
Guangxi becomes a flashpoint for debate between dog owners and consumers during
the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival. International organizations have become increas-
ingly active in rescuing Asian dogs destined for market. However, these activities
increase the risk of spreading canine pathogens between continents, as evidenced by
the recent invasion of CIV-H3N2 into the United States (33). The purchase of animals by
international rescue organizations may also provide a secondary market for illicit
activities involved in the theft of pet or street dogs for market. China is a complex and
diverse nation with a rapid and spatially uneven rate of modernization. It is important
to understand how cultural changes in attitudes toward dogs could alter the frequency
of contacts between dogs, live-animal markets, and humans across the country, and in
turn impact CIV dynamics and pandemic risk.
Canines were not considered viable hosts for IAVs in the 20th century, but they have
rapidly emerged in the 21st century as important reservoirs for diverse IAVs introduced
from equines (H3N8), birds (H3N2), and swine (H1N1) and as potential mixing vessels
for the evolution of novel IAVs (44). To date, canines have been only on the receiving
end of IAV host jumps, with the exception of a few spillovers of CIV-H3N2 from canines
into felines in Asia (45, 46). However, as the CIV gene pool expands, so does the
likelihood that a new variant will emerge in dogs with the capacity to infect humans or
other species (47). The capacity of IAVs to host jump from swine to canines was
surprising, given their different distributions of key virus-binding sialic acid receptors in
the upper respiratory tract that IAVs bind to enter host cells (7). Humans and swine
have more similar distributions of sialic acid receptors, providing a mechanistic expla-
nation for the frequency of interspecies transmission events between humans and pigs
FIG 8 Emergence of zoonotic IAVs in China and the United States. Viruses with zoonotic potential in
humans evolve independently via similar evolutionary pathways in the United States and China. This
pathway includes (i) reverse zoonosis of H1N1pdm viruses from humans to commercial swine, (ii)
genomic reassortment with other IAVs circulating in commercial and exhibition swine, and (iii) trans-
mission to humans or to an intermediary host (canines or exhibition swine) with higher contact rates with
humans. The most common H3N2v genotype is presented for U.S. swine, with segments of the viral
genome ordered from longest to shortest. The CIV-H1N1(sw1) and CIV-H1N1(sw2) genotypes are
presented for swine and canines from southern China. The gray arrow and question mark indicate
uncertainty regarding whether CIVs could transmit to humans in the future.

 (7). Consequently, it is possible that CIVs of swine origin could present a higher risk for
humans than CIVs of avian and equine origin. At the very least, the detection of
multiple IAVs of swine origin in canines in Guangxi highlights gaps in our understand-
ing of biological barriers to interspecies transmission, including binding to sialic acid
receptors and evading innate immune responses (48–50). Our study also emphasizes
the need to conduct additional studies in other geographic areas to find how far the
new canine influenza virus strains we have detected have spread and whether a high
frequency of influenza virus infection in dogs is also found in other areas. At a time of
increased attention to the role of mammalian hosts in the ecology of influenza virus
(51), further research is greatly needed to assess the pandemic risk presented by the
expanding genetic diversity of IAVs in swine, canines, and potentially other hosts in
southern China (52, 53).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. From 2013 to 2015, a total of 800 nasal swabs were collected from canines
presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary hospitals and clinics in 11 prefectures of Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) of China, including Nanning (NN), Yulin (YL), Liuzhou (LZ), Hechi
(HC), Baise (BS), Qinzhou (QZ), Wuzhou (WZ), Chongzuo (CZ), Guilin (GL), Beihai (BH), and Fangchenggang
(FCG) (Fig. 1B). Most of the samples were collected from pet dogs presenting with coughing, sneezing,
nasal discharge, and fever (�39.5°
C). Full characteristics of the sampled dogs, including location,
collection date, symptoms, and dog breed are available for animals that tested positive and negative for
influenza virus by PCR, and are provided in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.
CIV isolation and sequencing. Sample processing and virus isolation were performed as previously
described (54). RNA was directly extracted from nasal swabs for screening. All of the M-gene-positive
samples were incubated on a monolayer of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for virus isolation.
The HA and NA subtypes were determined by direct sequencing of the PCR products. Whole genomes
were amplified by PCR and sequenced by segment-specific primers.
Phylogenetic analysis. Sequence alignments were constructed for the IAVs collected for this study
from canines and background sequences from canines, swine, humans, birds, and other species that
were downloaded from the Influenza Virus Resource at NCBI’
s GenBank (55). To capture the complete
multihost ecology of PDMhuH1 (hu stands for humans) in Asia, the data sets included viruses collected
from all host species from which PDMhuH1 viruses have been identified in Asia so far, including humans,
swine, canines, ferrets, and giant pandas. Alignments were constructed for each of the six internal gene
segments (polymerase basic protein 2 [PB2], PB1, polymerase acidic protein [PA], nucleoprotein [NP], MP,
and NS) and independently for different hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes using
MUSCLE v3.8.3 (56), with manual correction in Se-Al v2.0 (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/
seal/). Initial phylogenetic trees were inferred using the neighbor-joining method available in PAUP
v4.0b10 (available at http://paup.csit.fsu.edu) for each of the alignments to assign each sequence to one
of the genetic lineages found in swine (EAswH1, TRswH1, CswH1, and PDMswH1), canines (H3N2can), or
birds (H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, and H9N2). All xml files have been deposited in Dryad and are available at
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.16r2v07.
Phylogenetic relationships were inferred for each of the data sets separately using the time-scaled
Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) available via the BEAST v1.8.4 package (57)
and the computational resources of the NIH HPC Biowulf cluster (http://hpc.nih.gov). A strict molecular
clock was used, with a constant population size, and a general-time reversible (GTR) model of
nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. For viruses for which
only the year of viral collection was available, the lack of tip date precision was accommodated by
sampling uniformly across a 1-year window from 1 January to 31 December. The MCMC was run
separately at least three times for each of the data sets and for at least 100 million iterations with
subsampling every 10,000 iterations, using the BEAGLE library to improve computational perfor-
mance (58). All parameters reached convergence, as assessed visually using Tracer v.1.6, with
statistical uncertainty reflected in values of the 95% highest posterior density (HPD). At least 10% of
the chain was removed as burn-in, and runs for the same lineage and segment were combined using
LogCombiner v1.8.4 and down-sampled to generate a final posterior distribution of 1,000 trees that
was used in the subsequent spatial analysis.
Spatial analysis. To study the spatial patterns of interspecies transmission of H1N1pdm in Asia (PB2,
PB1, PA, NP, and MP segments), the following hosts and locations were defined: (i) canines from Guangxi,
China; (ii) canines from South Korea; (iii) humans from China (including Taiwan), Japan, and South Korea;
(iv) swine from southern China (including Hong Kong SAR, Guangdong Province, and Guangxi); (v) swine
from China (excluding southern China); (vi) swine from South Korea; (vii) swine from Japan; and (viii)
nonhuman/nonswine/noncanine host species (including ferret and giant panda) from China (including
Taiwan). To study the spatial patterns of EAswH1 viruses (HA and NA segments), the following hosts and
locations were defined: (i) canines from Guangxi, China; (ii) humans from China; (c) swine from southern
China (including Hong Kong SAR, Guangdong Province, and Guangxi); (iv) swine from China (excluding
southern China); (v) swine from South Korea; and (vi) swine from Europe. For the NA segment, viruses
from swine in Mexico and six representative viruses from human H1N1pdm viruses, including A/Califor-
nia/04/2009(H1N1), were also included for reference. To study the spatial patterns of CswH1 and TRswH3

 viruses (NS segment), the following hosts and locations were defined: (i) canines from Guangxi, China; (ii)
swine from southern China (including Hong Kong SAR, Guangdong Province, and Guangxi); (iii) swine
from China (excluding southern China); (iv) swine from South Korea; (v) swine from Japan; (vi) swine from
South-East Asia (including Thailand and Vietnam); (vii) swine from Europe; and (viii) swine from North
America. Six representative viruses from human H1N1pdm viruses, including A/California/04/2009(H1N1),
were also included for reference.
Using these defined geographic regions, the host and location were specified for each viral sequence,
allowing the expected number of state transitions in the ancestral history conditional on the data
observed at the tree tips to be estimated using “Markov jump” counts (59), which provided a
quantitative measure of asymmetry in gene flow between regions. For computational efficiency, the
phylogeographic analysis was run using an empirical distribution of 1,000 trees (60), allowing the
MCMC to be run for 25 million iterations, sampling every 1,000. A Bayesian stochastic search variable
selection (BSSVS) was employed to improve statistical efficiency for all data sets. Maximum clade
credibility (MCC) trees were summarized by using TreeAnnotator v1.8.0, and the trees were visual-
ized by using FigTree v1.4.3.
Amino acid analysis. We used the sequence-derived phenotype markers provided by the Influenza
Research Database (IRD) (61) to compare known phenotype-associated amino acid changes in the CIVs
collected for this study and other host species and lineages (available at https://www.fludb.org). We also
used IRD’
s HA subtype numbering tool (62).
Accession number(s). All sequence data were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MG254059
to MG254185).
