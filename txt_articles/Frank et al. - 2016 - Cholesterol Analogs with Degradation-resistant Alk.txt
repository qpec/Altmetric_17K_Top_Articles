Cholest-4-en-3-one, whether added exogenously or gener-
ated intracellularly from cholesterol, inhibits the growth of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis when CYP125A1 and CYP142A1,
the cytochrome P450 enzymes that initiate degradation of the
sterol side chain, are disabled. Here we demonstrate that a
16-hydroxy derivative of cholesterol, which was previously re-
ported to inhibit growth of M. tuberculosis, acts by preventing
the oxidation of the sterol side chain even in the presence of the
relevant cytochrome P450 enzymes. The finding that (25R)-
cholest-5-en-3�,16�,26-triol (1) (and its 3-keto metabolite)
inhibit growth suggests that cholesterol analogs with non-de-
gradable side chains represent a novel class of anti-mycobacte-
rial agents. In accord with this, two cholesterol analogs with
truncated, fluorinated side chains have been synthesized and
shown to similarly block the growth in culture of M. tubercu-
losis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)2 is the causative agent of
tuberculosis, a disease that the World Health Organization esti-
mates in 2014 caused illness in 9.6 million individuals and killed
1.5 million people (1), with the bulk of this disease burden fall-
ing on third world countries. The scale of this threat, com-
pounded by the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant
strains of Mtb, makes it imperative to find new ways to combat
tuberculosis (2).
Due to the absence of key enzymes, including squalene
monooxygenase and oxidosqualene cyclase, cholesterol is not
synthesized in Mtb, but its utilization is important for the infec-
tivity and virulence of this pathogenic agent (3). In vitro, Mtb
can grow on a defined medium that includes cholesterol as the
sole source of carbon and energy (4–6). Furthermore, the abil-
ity of Mtb to infect macrophages after their membranes have
been depleted of cholesterol is severely impaired (7). Early
experiments also established that the igr locus is required for
cholesterol metabolism, and its deletion impairs intracellular
growth and virulence (8, 9).
Cholesterol degradation in Mtb is initiated by oxidation of a
terminal methyl of the cholesterol side chain to a carboxylic
acid by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP125A1 (Rv3545c) and
CYP142A1 (Rv3518c) (4, 6, 10). This oxidation reaction can
occur with cholesterol itself, but does so more efficiently with
cholest-4-en-3-one (4), the metabolite formed by oxidation of
the 3-hydroxyl group to a ketone by a mycobacterial 3�-hy-
droxysterol dehydrogenase (3�-HSD, Rv1106c) (11–13). The
�-oxidation of the side chain gives rise to 4-androstenedione,
which can undergo further degradation (3). The acetyl- and
propionoyl-CoA fragments obtained from the side chain are
incorporated into cellular lipids and virulence factors (14, 15).
Mtb without functional CYP125A1 and CYP142A1 is unable
to grow on cholesterol as a carbon source, but grows readily on
carbon sources such as glycerol, glucose, or acetate (6, 14). In
these mycobacteria, cholesterol accumulates in the form of
cholest-4-en-3-one (14). We have shown that cholest-4-en-3-
one can inhibit the growth of Mtb in defined media with glyc-
erol as the carbon source, indicating that this steroid can act
adversely on the utilization of glycerol by the mycobacterium
(14). Cholest-4-en-3-one is not a useful growth inhibitor, how-
ever, because it is rapidly degraded by wild-type mycobacteria
and only causes transient inhibition. A screen of various 3�-hy-
droxy sterols as Mtb growth inhibitors recently demonstrated
that several, including (25R)-cholest-5-en-3�,16�,26-triol (1),
significantly inhibited the growth of the H37Rv strain of Mtb,
whereas they show no toxicity to the Vero mammalian cell line
(16).
Here we demonstrate that cholest-4-en-3-one inhibits
growth of Mtb on defined media with not only glycerol, as
already reported (14), but also with acetate and glucose as the
sole carbon source. We then establish that 1 is oxidized by the
mycobacterial 3�-HSD enzyme to the 3-keto form, but it is not
a substrate for CYP125A1 or CYP142A1, resulting in the accu-
mulation of a non-degradable analog of cholest-4-en-3-one.
This agent is a potent inhibitor of Mtb growth despite the nor-
mal presence of catalytically active CYP125A1 and CYP142A1.
Furthermore, two cholesterol analogs with truncated, fluori-
nated side chains (2 and 3) that are resistant to degradation
similarly inhibit Mtb growth.

the addition of 1 mM isopropyl �-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
and 0.5 mM �-aminolevulinic acid, and the culture continued
for 36 h at 25 °

on ice and resuspended with agitation in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM phenylmethylsul-
fonyl fluoride, followed by the addition of lysozyme (0.5 mg

Cytochrome P450 Substrate Oxidation Assays—CYP125A1
and CYP142A1 (5 �M) were incubated at ambient temperature
for 5 min with 0.1 mM substrate (compounds 1, 2, or 3) from a
10 mM stock dissolved in methanol in 50 mM potassium phos-
phate (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% (w/v) M�CD, 150 mM NaCl,

NADPH regeneration system consisting of 1 mM NADPH, 1 �M
spinach ferredoxin, 0.2 unit ml�1 of spinach ferredoxin-
NADP� reductase, 0.1 mg ml�1 of bovine liver catalase, 0.4 unit

6-phosphate. After 16 h the reactions were quenched with an
equal volume of 1 N HCl, and the mixtures dried under N2 gas
and then extracted five times with 0.5 ml of acetone. The com-
bined extracts were dried under N2 gas, derivatized for 1 h at
37 °
C with 75 �l of BSTFA (Sigma), and analyzed on an Agilent
6850 gas chromatograph fitted with an HP-5MS column (30 m,
0.25 mm internal diameter, Agilent) coupled to an Agilent 5973
network mass selective detector in the flame ionization mode
operating at 70 eV. Helium was the carrier gas. The tempera-

3�-HSD Expression and Purification—E.coli BL21(DE3)pLysS
competent cells were transformed with a PET15b plasmid
encoding M. tuberculosis 3�-HSD (Rv1106c) with a C-terminal
His6 tag (11). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were picked and
used to innoculate 100 ml of overnight small-scale LB cultures.
A 15-ml aliquot of the overnight LB culture was transferred to 1
liter of YT medium containing 100 �g/ml of ampicillin. The
cultures were grown at 37 °
C and 220 rpm for �4 h until the
optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8. Isopropyl �-D-1-thioga-
lactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.4 mM to
induce protein expression. The cultures were continued at
18 °
C at 180 rpm for 20 h before harvesting. The cell cultures
were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 � g for 30 min and the
cell pellets were frozen and stored at �80 °
C. All purification
steps were performed at 4 °
C. The cell pellet (15 g) was sus-
pended in 150 ml of buffer A (50 mM triethanolamine hydro-
chloride, pH 8.5) with one cOmpleteTM mini-protease inhibi-
tor mixture tablet, EDTA-free (Roche), and lysed with
sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 35,000
rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and 5 mM imidazole
was added before loading onto a HisTrap HP column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) that had been equilibrated with 10
column volumes of buffer A with 5 mM imidazole. After wash-
ing with 10 column volumes of buffer A with 5 mM imidazole,
10 column volumes of buffer A with 50 mM imidazole, and 10
column volumes of buffer A with 100 mM imidazole, the
3�-HSD protein was eluted with buffer A with 500 mM imidaz-
ole. The eluted 3�-HSD protein was pooled and assayed at
30 °
C by monitoring NADH absorbance at 340 nm in buffer A
in the presence of 120 �M cholesterol.
3�-HSD Oxidation of the 3�-Hydroxy Group in Cholesterol
Analogs—The 3�-HSD catalyzed reactions contained 0.41 pM
3�-HSD, 1.4 mM NAD, and 120 �M triol or difluoro compounds
in 50 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride buffer, pH 8.5. The
reactions were terminated with the same volume of 1 N HCl. For
HPLC analysis, the acidified samples were centrifuged and the
supernatants were collected and analyzed on an Agilent 1200
series HPLC system with a reverse phase C18 column (Waters
Xterra C18, 3.5 �m, 2.1 � 50 mm). The triol and difluoro com-
pounds and their metabolites were monitored at 240 nm. For
the reactions with difluoro compounds, the samples were
eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (solvent A,
H2O � 0.1% formic acid; solvent B, CH3CN � 0.1% formic acid)
with a gradient starting at 70% B for 1 min and then increasing to
100% B over 11 min. The elution was maintained at 100% B up
to 14 min and then decreased to 70% B over 1 min, followed by
equilibration at the same composition for 2 min before the next
run. For the triol reactions, the samples were eluted isocrati-
cally at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (solvent A, H2O � 0.1% formic
acid; solvent B, CH3CN � 0.1% formic acid) with a gradient
starting at 50% B for 1 min and then increasing to 80% B over 11
min. The solvent was then increased to 100% B over 0.5 min and
maintained at 100% B until 14 min and then decreased to 50% B
within 1 min, followed by equilibration at the same composi-
tion for 2 min before the next run. Identification of the metab-
olites of the triol compound was accomplished by GC-MS anal-
ysis. The terminated reaction samples (0.5 ml) were extracted
with hexane (2 � 2 ml). After vortexing, the mixture was cen-
trifuged (2,000 rpm, 5 min) and the organic layer was separated
and evaporated under nitrogen. The dried sample residue was
then trimethylsilylated to give the trimethylsilyl derivatives by
resuspension in 100 �l of BSTFA (Pierce) for 1 h at 37 °
C. The
reaction mixtures were analyzed using an HP5790 gas chroma-
tography system fitted with a DB5-MS column (30 m � 0.25

temperature of 70 °
C for 2 min, then increasing by 10 °
C/min to
300 °
C, and finally holding at 300 °
C for 5 min. The reaction
samples with difluoro compounds were analyzed by LC-MS.

M. tuberculosis in Vitro Culture—The wild-type CDC1551
strain was obtained from Colorado State University, and wild-
type Erdmann strain from the Cox laboratory (University of
California, San Francisco, CA). All experiments with M. tuber-
culosis cells were performed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facil-
ity. The CDC1551 �cyp125A1 mutant strain was created by
homologous recombination using specialized transducing
phages as described previously (4). M. tuberculosis cells were
cultured in 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% oleic acid-
albumin-dextrose complex, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80.
For growth in carbon-restricted media, log-phase cells grown in
7H9 medium were used to inoculate a defined minimal medium
(1 g/liter of KH2PO4, 2.5 g/liter of Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter of aspar-
agine, 50 mg/liter of ferric ammonium citrate, 10 mg/liter of
MgSO4�7H2O, 0.5 mg/liter of CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/liter of
ZnSO4), and 0.1% glycerol at an initial A600 nm of 0.05. Then
transferred to the same defined media without glycerol, with
the addition of the appropriate carbon source (0.1% glycerol,
0.5% glucose, or 0.5% acetate), with or without 0.1 mM oxysterol
supplements (4-cholesten-3-one, (25R)-cholest-5-en-3�, 16�,

(3)) at an initial A600 nm of 0.05. A stock solution of oxysterol (50
mg/ml) was prepared in tyloxapol/ethanol (1:1) and warmed at
65 °
C for 20 min before addition.
Results
Growth Inhibition by Cholest-4-en-3-one—As already noted,
CYP125A1 and CYP142A1 are required for the catabolism of
cholesterol in Mtb. In the absence of these enzymes in an active
form, cholest-4-en-3-one accumulates due to the action of a
mycobacterial 3�-sterol dehydrogenase. In wild-type Mtb,
growth on cholesterol is retarded in the presence of large
amounts of cholesterol, or added cholest-4-en-3-one, with
growth occurring as the cholest-4-en-3-one concentration de-
creases. Furthermore, cholest-4-en-3-one inhibits the growth of
Mtb in defined media with glycerol as the sole carbon source
(14). It is therefor able to interfere with the glycerol, as well
as cholesterol, metabolic pathways. To determine whether
cholest-4-en-3-one can inhibit growth on other carbon
sources, we investigated its effects on cells growing on acetate
or glucose. In effect, in the absence of CYP125A1 and
CYP142A1, growth on both of these alternative carbon sources

 was also blocked by exogenously added cholest-4-en-3-one
(Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E).
Interaction of (1) with CYP125A1 and CPY142A1—Triol 1
(the “triol”), an inhibitor of the growth of H37Rv Mtb in culture
(16), is closely related in structural terms to 26-hydroxycholes-
terol, the first product generated by the action of CYP125A1
and CYP142A1 on cholesterol (4). To determine whether this
cholesterol analog, like cholesterol, was a substrate for the sub-
sequent conversion of the 26-hydroxy group to the aldehyde
and carboxylic acid, we investigated the interaction of 1 with
these two mycobacterial P450 enzymes. As shown in Fig. 2, triol
(1) binds to CYP125A1 in a concentration-dependent manner
with a Ks � 15.4 � 1.1 �M. The reverse type-1 spectrum (Fig. 2,
inset) that is observed suggests that binding of the sterol does
not displace the distal water ligand from the heme iron atom,
but rather may sterically, or through hydrogen bonding, trap
the distal water, promoting its coordination as the distal ligand
(24). In contrast, only minor spectroscopic changes were
observed on attempted binding of 1 to CYP142A1. If the sterol
binds to this P450 enzyme, it does so with very little perturba-
tion of the active site environment.
Unexpectedly, catalytic assays searching for the oxidation of
1 to the corresponding aldehyde or acid were unsuccessful
under conditions where the conversion of cholesterol to the
acid was readily observed (data not shown). Thus, although
the triol binds to CYP125A1, it is not a detectable substrate of
the enzyme, and the triol is neither a detectable ligand nor sub-
strate of CYP142A1.
Inhibition of Mtb Growth by 1—The wild-type CDC1551
strain of Mtb has an active CYP125A1, but lacks a functional
CYP142A1. Knock-out of the cyp125A1 gene therefore pro-
duces a strain that lacks both of the P450 enzymes that are able
to effectively oxidize the C26-carbon of cholesterol and
cholest-4-en-3-one (4). As shown in Fig. 1A, the CDC1551
strain, which grows normally on glycerol, is able to grow,
perhaps even better, when 0.1 mM cholest-4-en-3-one is
added to the medium. The Erdmann strain of Mtb, which
retains active forms of both CYP125A1 and CYP142A1, also
grows well on glycerol with or without the addition of cholest-
4-en-3-one (Fig. 1C). However, as reported previously (14), the
CDC1551 �cyp125A1 mutant, which lacks both CYP125A1
and CYP142A1, is not able to grow on glycerol in the presence
of cholest-4-en-3-one.
In striking contrast, wild-type CDC1551, which grew well in
the presence of cholest-4-en-3-one because this compound can
be catabolized, was completely unable to grow on glycerol in
the presence of 1 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the triol completely
inhibits the growth of the wild-type Erdmann strain, which has
both active CYP125A1 and CYP142A1 (Fig. 1C). The triol thus
inhibits growth on glycerol whether the two P450 enzymes that
oxidize the cholesterol side chain are present or not. Further-
more, triol 1 blocks growth of the CDC1551 strain of Mtb not
only on glycerol, but also on acetate or glucose (not shown).
Synthesis of 2 and 3—Difluoromethyl analogs 2 and 3
(Scheme 1) were synthesized from the corresponding protected
aldehydes (4 and 8) by reaction with DeoxoFluor (25). The
rationale for the choice of these two compounds is presented
under “Discussion.” The side chain of all of the targets was
constructed from the known precursor (20S)-3�-(tert-butyldi-
methylsilyloxy)-20-hydroxymethylpregn-5-ene, using a variety
of standard transformations (Scheme 1) (18). The 5,6-double
bond was not completely inert to the hydrogenation conditions
utilized to remove the �16 alkene and consequently a small
amount (�10%) of the chromatographically inseparable com-
pounds lacking the C5 double bond was formed concomitantly
with the desired analogs (2 and 3).

 Inhibition of CDC1551 Mtb by Side Chain Fluorinated Cho-
lesterol Analogs 2 and 3—Incubation of CDC1551 Mtb in
defined medium with glycerol as the carbon source results in
normal growth of the mycobacteria. However, in the presence
of a 0.1 mM concentration of either 2 or 3, growth is completely
prevented (Fig. 3). The same is true if the �cyp125a1 mutant
strain of CDC1551 is substituted for the wild-type CDC1551
strain.
Oxidation of 1, 2, and 3 to the 3-Keto Derivatives by
3�-HSD—Earlier studies have shown that cholest-4-en-3-one
is a better substrate for oxidation by CYP125A1 and CYP142A1
than cholesterol itself (4). We therefore examined whether 1
could be oxidized by the mycobacterial 3�-HSD to the 3-keto-
4-ene form. As shown in (Fig. 4), triol 1 is readily converted to
the corresponding keto form under conditions that similarly
convert cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one. The structure of the
metabolite was firmly established by the mass spectrum, which
shows a loss of two hydrogen atoms, and by the acquisition of a
UV-visible spectrum consistent with the presence of the 3-ke-
to-4-ene chromophore. Similar experiments with fluoros-
teroids 2 and 3 (Fig. 4) establish that these compounds are also
readily oxidized to the 3-keto-4-ene forms by 3�-HSD. Thus,
the triol and the two fluorosteroids can be converted to the
presumably more inhibitory 3-keto-4-ene metabolites.
Discussion
An important finding of this study is that cholest-4-en-3-one
inhibits growth of Mtb on defined medium, not only when glyc-
erol is the sole source of carbon, but also when the glycerol is
replaced by acetate or glucose (Fig. 1). Cholest-4-en-3-one also
inhibits growth on cholesterol, but inhibition in all these cases
is transient, as cholest-4-en-3-one is catabolized by the myco-
bacteria if they retain the activity of either (or both) CYP125A1
or CYP142A1 (4). Cholest-4-en-3-one thus acts as an inhibitor
at one or more crucial sites in the pathways that enable the
utilization of all these carbon sources. The identities of these
sites remain unknown, but they are clearly of interest as poten-
tial sites for antitubercular drug development.
Cholest-4-en-3-one, whether generated within the myco-
bacteria from cholesterol or added exogenously, is not of inter-
est as an inhibitor of Mtb growth because it is rapidly catabo-
lized and only has a transient existence. Nevertheless, the
inhibitory properties of cholest-4-en-3-one become apparent
when examined with strains of Mtb that lack both CYP125A1

 and CYP142A1 (4, 14). These results suggest that analogs of
cholesterol (or cholest-4-en-3-one) with degradation-resistant
side chains might be inhibitors of wild-type Mtb growth, so long
as the modifications of the sterol structure do not interfere with
its interaction at the sites at which growth inhibition is
imposed. We establish here that, unexpectedly, this can be
achieved by placing a 16-hydroxyl group on the tetracyclic ste-
rol nucleus, as shown by the fact that 1 is not a substrate for
either CYP125A1 or CYP142A1. Although spectroscopic evi-
dence shows that this sterol can bind to CYP125A1 (but possi-
bly not to CYP142A1), it does so in a non-productive manner
that prevents side chain oxidation. Triol 1 has two more
hydroxyl groups than cholesterol, but the 26-hydroxyl group is
equivalent to the 26-hydroxyl group that is added to cholesterol
by the P450 enzymes in their first catalytic turnover and there-
fore cannot contribute to the resistance to side chain degrada-
tion. Furthermore, the mycobacterial 3�-HSD oxidizes the
3-hydroxyl group of 1 in the same way as it does the 3-hydroxyl
group of cholesterol (Fig. 4). Thus, the key substitution in this
molecule is the 16-hydroxyl group. The spectroscopic observa-
tion of a reverse type I binding spectrum with CYP125A1,
together with the failure of the P450 enzymes to oxidize the
triol, suggests that the 16-hydroxyl sterically interferes with
internalization of the sterol side chain into the P450 active site.
This is consistent with the observation of a reverse type I bind-
ing spectrum, which suggests that the water ligand on the heme
iron atom has not been displaced, a necessary step for electron
transfer, oxygen binding, and catalysis.
In effect, the 16-hydroxyl group of 1 makes it a degradation-
resistant analog of cholesterol, and its 3-keto metabolite a sim-
ilar analog of cholest-4-en-3-one. As a result, the triol is a
potent inhibitor of the growth of Mtb, presumably acting at the
same target sites as cholest-4-en-3-one.
To further test this hypothesis, we synthesized two choles-
terol analogs with truncated, fluorinated side chains. In one
case (3), one methyl of the terminal isopropyl function has been
deleted and the other substituted with two fluorine atoms. In
the other case, the entire isopropyl function has been deleted
and two fluorines added to the terminus of the truncated side
chain (2). In previous work (18), we have shown that 24-bro-
mochol-5-en-3-ol, in which the side chain is truncated to the
same extent as in 2, yields a sterol that binds to CYP125A1 and
CYP142A1, but is not a detectable substrate. Removal of one
methyl from the side chain terminus, as in 27-norcholesterol,
gives a compound that also binds to the two P450 enzymes, but
in this case is catalytically oxidized by the enzymes to give the
terminal hydroxylation product with kcat rates 5–8 times
slower than for cholesterol itself (18). As predicted from these
earlier findings, 2 did not give a detectable product when incu-
bated with either of the two P450 enzymes (data not shown).
Again, as predicted by the earlier work, 3 was slowly oxidized by
both enzymes to the carboxylic acid. HPLC and GC-MS analy-
sis showed formation of the acid metabolite with a retention
time of 26.5 min and the expected parent molecular ion of 546.5
Da for the di-trimethylsilylated derivative (Fig. 5). The acid is
expected from hydroxylation of the terminal -CHF2 group, as it
will spontaneously eliminate fluoride to give an acyl fluoride,
which in turn could undergo spontaneous hydrolysis to the acid
(26). A minor additional product with a GC-MS retention time
of 24.5 min and a parent molecular mass of 488.5 Da was also
observed. This metabolite corresponds to the same acid, but
with the carboxyl group present as a methyl ester due to trap-
ping of the acyl fluoride intermediate by methanol (Scheme 2).
Trimethylsilylation is then only possible at the 3�-hydroxyl
group (Fig. 5). Methanol is present in low amounts in the incu-
bation as the sterol substrate is added as a methanol solution.
Formation of the C26 methyl ester in itself confirms formation
of the acyl fluoride in the incubation. A nucleophile on the P450
enzyme could also conceivably compete with water (or metha-
nol) for addition to the acyl fluoride, resulting in covalent bind-
ing to the P450 enzyme, but we have no evidence in this regard.
Most importantly, both 2 and 3 completely block growth of
CDC1551 Mtb on media containing glycerol as the carbon
source. This inhibition does not depend on the presence or
absence of CYP125A1.

 Previous studies of the central carbon metabolism in Mtb
note the importance of the isocitrate lyase genes for growth on
cholesterol in vitro and for virulence during mouse infections
(27). This toxicity was attributed to the buildup of toxic
amounts of propionate, which would not be likely in our model
as cholesterol serves as a precursor to propionate. Indeed, pre-
vious work noted that supplementation of propionate inhibited
growth of Mtb on glycerol, but failed to inhibit growth on ace-
tate (28), unlike our findings. The results presented here thus
implicate a distinct and more robust mechanism of growth
inhibition. They define a new paradigm for the development of
agents that can, at least in culture, block the growth of M. tuber-
culosis. Further exploration of this paradigm is a promising
route for the development of therapeutically useful inhibitors.
