Introduction
Alopecia areata (AA) is a major medical problem and is among the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the 
US, with a lifetime risk of 1.7% (1). AA affects both sexes across all ethnicities and represents the second most 
common form of human hair loss, second only to androgenetic alopecia (2). AA usually presents with patchy 
hair loss. One-third of these patients will experience spontaneous remissions within the first year. However, 
many patients’ disease will progress to alopecia totalis (AT, total scalp hair loss) or alopecia universalis (AU, 
loss of all body hair). Persistent moderate-to-severe AA causes significant disfigurement and psychological 
distress in affected individuals (3). In clinical practice, there are no evidence-based treatments for AA (4), yet 
various treatments are offered, most commonly topical and intralesional steroids, which have limited efficacy.
Our recent mechanistic studies demonstrated a dominant role for type I cellular immunity in AA patho-
genesis, mediated by IFN-γ–producing NKG2D-bearing CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (5). The cen-
tral role of type I cellular immunity is also reflected in the transcriptional landscape of AA lesional skin in 
humans and mice, which is dominated by IFN response genes and a CTL signature. These findings provided 
BACKGROUND. Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease with a lifetime risk of 
1.7%; there are no FDA-approved treatments for AA. We previously identified a dominant IFN-γ 
transcriptional signature in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in human and mouse AA skin and 
showed that treatment with JAK inhibitors induced durable hair regrowth in mice by targeting this 
pathway. Here, we investigated the use of the oral JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in the treatment of 
patients with moderate-to-severe AA.
METHODS. We initiated an open-label clinical trial of 12 patients with moderate-to-severe AA, using 
oral ruxolitinib, 20 mg twice per day, for 3–6 months of treatment followed by 3 months follow-up 
off drug. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with 50% or greater hair regrowth 
from baseline to end of treatment.
RESULTS. Nine of twelve patients (75%) demonstrated a remarkable response to treatment, with 
average hair regrowth of 92% at the end of treatment. Safety parameters remained largely within 
normal limits, and no serious adverse effects were reported. Gene expression profiling revealed 
treatment-related downregulation of inflammatory markers, including signatures for CTLs and IFN 
response genes and upregulation of hair-specific markers.
CONCLUSION. In this pilot study, 9 of 12 patients (75%) treated with ruxolitinib showed significant 
scalp hair regrowth and improvement of AA. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to 
further assess the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in the treatment of AA.

the rationale for therapeutically targeting JAK1/2 kinases in AA, and, indeed, we showed that treatment with 
JAK inhibitors reversed AA in C3H/HeJ mice and eliminated the type I inflammatory response in the skin (6).
On the basis of our preclinical findings, we initiated a phase II efficacy signal-seeking clinical trial in 
moderate-to-severe AA, assessing the clinical and immunopathological response to treatment with oral 
ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor currently FDA approved for the treatment of myeloproliferative disorders.
Results
Efficacy. This study was an open-label clinical trial to investigate ruxolitinib (Jakafi, Incyte Pharmaceuticals), 20 
mg orally twice daily, in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AA (Table 1 and Figure 1A). All patients received 
ruxolitinib for 3–6 months, followed by a 3-month observational phase to assess treatment response durability.
Nine of twelve patients (75%) had significant hair regrowth and achieved the primary outcome of at 
least 50% regrowth (Table 2). The mean baseline severity of alopecia tool (SALT) score of 65.8% ± 28.0% 
decreased to a score of 24.8% ± 22.9% at 3 months and to a score of 7.3% ± 13.5% at the end of 6 months 
of treatment (P < 0.005, Table 2). As a group, the responders exhibited a 92% reduction in hair loss from 
baseline (Figure 1, B–D; Figure 2; and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available online with 
this article; doi:10.1172/jci.insight.89790DS1), with 7 of the 9 responders achieving over 95% regrowth 
by end of treatment.
Regrowth was seen in responders as soon as 4 weeks after study medication was initiated and initially 
presented as variably subtle patchy areas of regrowth, consisting of pigmented terminal hairs, with the 
exception of one patient (subject 4) with concurrent vitiligo, who exhibited primarily gray hair regrowth.

Of note, the areas of vitiligo in this patient were also noted to improve with ruxolitinib treatment (7). 
Hair regrowth for all responders increased steadily, with substantial increases each month, resulting in the 
majority (8 of 9) of responders achieving at least 50% regrowth by the week 12 visit. Responding patients 
with evidence of regrowth at 3 months continued treatment until they had either achieved 95%–100% 
regrowth or completed 6 months of treatment.
Durability of responses was assessed in the 3-month follow-up period off treatment. Three of nine 
responders noted shedding, beginning at week 3 following ruxolitinib discontinuation, and had marked 
hair loss at week 12 off drug (Supplemental Figure 1); however, hair loss did not reach baseline levels 
(Figure 1, B and C). Six of nine responders reported increased shedding without major hair loss.

taken at baseline and following 12 weeks of treatment, with additional optional biopsies performed 
earlier in the treatment course. Baseline scalp samples exhibited a distinct gene expression profile when 
compared with samples taken from unaffected patients (Figure 3A and Supplemental Table 2). Follow-
ing ruxolitinib treatment, gene expression profiles of AA patient scalp samples clustered more closely 
with healthy control scalp samples than with baseline AA samples (Figure 3B), indicating global nor-
malization of the AA pathogenic response. Gene expression profiles attributed to the IFN, CTL, and 
hair keratin (KRT) signatures were assessed in the trivariate AA disease activity index (ALADIN, Fig-
ure 3C), a summary index of the AA pathogenic inflammatory response and hair regrowth (8). Impor-
tantly, eventual AA responders clustered together on the ALADIN matrix at baseline, sharing high IFN 
and CTL scores (Figure 3, C and D).
Notably, baseline samples from eventual AA nonresponders exhibited relatively low IFN and CTL 
scores (Figure 3, D and E) that were not statistically different than normal control samples. Furthermore, 
in our cohort of AA patients on ruxolitinib treatment, the CTL and IFN signature scores were capable of 
distinguishing eventual nonresponders and responders at baseline (P < 0.036 and P < 0.036 for CTL and 
IFN scores, respectively).
Consistent with on-target activity of treatment, skin samples taken following 12 weeks of treatment 
from responding patients exhibited much lower IFN and CTL scores and clustered much more closely to 
skin samples taken from normal control patients on the ALADIN matrix (Figure 3, D and E). Decreased 
IFN and CTL scores in biopsies after treatment were demonstrable as early as 2 weeks after the initiation 
of treatment (Figure 3F).
Adverse events. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated and safely administered in all 12 patients. There were no 
serious adverse effects, and no patients required discontinuation of therapy. Observed adverse effects were 
infrequent and included 3 minor bacterial skin infections (in the same patient), 9 episodes of upper respira-
tory tract infection/allergy symptoms in 7 patients, 1 urinary tract infection, 1 case of mild pneumonia, 1 
conjunctival hemorrhage following a surgical procedure, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms. One patient 
developed lowered hemoglobin, which resolved with dose modification.

Discussion
In this proof-of-concept study, 20 mg ruxoli-
tinib twice per day for 3–6 months induced 
significant hair regrowth in 9 of 12 patients, 
an overall 75% rate of response to ruxolitinib 
in the treatment of AA. In contrast, the expect-
ed spontaneous remission rates (occurrence of 
hair regrowth, without treatment) in patients 
with moderate-to-severe AA is less than 12% 
based on two randomized controlled trials 
with similar subject populations (9, 10). Even 
the most severe forms of alopecia, AT/AU, 
responded, indicating that the autoimmune pro-
cess remains pathogenically active and remains 
reversible with JAK inhibition. Hair regrowth 
was evident within 1 month in responders and 
progressed at a rapid rate. Responses were near 
complete by 6 months of treatment in 8 of 9 
responders, suggesting that 6 months of ther-
apy is sufficient to induce maximal clinical 
remissions in the majority of responders.
In this 9-month study, ruxolitinib was well 
tolerated. The safety signals in this small study 
of AA patients, who are otherwise healthy, com-
pare favorably with the prior clinical experience 
of ruxolitinib in patients with myeloproliferative

disorders, in which adverse events, particularly those that are hematologically related, are understandably more 
frequent (11–13), and are consistent with findings from use of tofacitinib in the treatment of patients with 
psoriasis (14–19). The occurrence of hair shedding in responders following drug cessation suggests that main-
tenance therapy may be required to sustain remissions. Further clinical evaluation will be required to assess 
longer durations of therapy and/or investigations of alternative dosing schedules. Larger placebo controlled 
studies would be required to fully assess the benefit/risk profile of ruxolitinib in AA.
Transcriptional profiling of paired baseline and on-treatment scalp biopsies was both mechanistically 
and clinically informative. Baseline skin samples from responders had high inflammatory ALADIN IFN 
and CTL scores, with near normalization after 12 weeks of treatment, indicative of JAK1/2 inhibitor–
mediated suppression of the autoreactive CD8 T cell response. Indeed, early ALADIN normalization, as 
early as week 2 following initiating treatment (Figure 3F), may be predictive of favorable week 12 clinical 
outcomes. Conversely, nonresponder samples exhibited low baseline IFN/CTL scores and clustered rela-
tively closely to normal patient samples on the ALADIN matrix, suggestive of alternative inflammatory 
or noninflammatory etiologies of hair loss in these nonresponders (Supplemental Figure 2). One nonre-
sponder had both AA and androgenic alopecia, another nonresponder’s alopecia was consistent with AA 
histologically but appeared to be a rare diffuse form of the disease, and the final nonresponder exhibited 
an ophiasis AA pattern. Given our sample size, it is difficult to draw significant conclusions about the 
efficacy of ruxolitinib in these types of patients. Nevertheless, baseline ALADIN signatures, a measure of 
type I cellular immunity, may be useful as a predictive biomarker for response to JAK inhibitor treatment, 
although this needs confirmation in larger well-powered studies, given the caveats described.
Recent single-case reports have described clinical responses in AA patients treated with other JAK inhib-
itors, including tofacitinib (20), ruxolitinib (21), and baricitinib (22). In addition to this paper and Crispin et 
al. (23), these proof-of-concept data demonstrate immunopathological reversibility of the type I inflammato-
ry response that underlies AA, even in patients with longstanding or more severe forms of disease, providing 
a strong rationale for clinical development of oral and/or topical JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AA.
Methods
Study design, oversight, and participants
Study assessments and outcomes. The study’s primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders 
at end of treatment, defined as those subjects achieving at least 50% regrowth compared with baseline 
assessed by the SALT score, a standardized, validated method for estimating hair loss in AA (23). Second-
ary efficacy endpoints included hair regrowth as a continuous variable. Additionally, quality-of-life mea-
sures (Dermatology Quality of Life Index and Skindex) were done at regular prespecified intervals but did 
not show statistical differences in comparisons performed (data not shown). To assess response durability, 
responders were followed for 3 months after treatment was completed.
Safety analysis was included as a secondary endpoint for all subjects who received at least one dose of 
ruxolitinib and was monitored as described above at monthly visits.
Biomarker assessment and clinical correlative studies
Biopsies and peripheral blood were obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks for immune monitoring and 
molecular studies. Several patients provided additional biopsies at intermediate time points during the 
course of treatment, and one patient provided an additional sample at week 24. Tissues specimens were 
fixed and stored in PAXgene Tissue Containers (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from skin biopsy 
specimens harvested during the course of the clinical trial using the PAXgene tissue miRNA kit (Qia-
gen). Library prep was performed for microarray analysis using the Ovation RNA Amplification System 
V2 and Biotin Encore kits (NuGen Technologies Inc.). Samples were subsequently hybridized to Human 
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chips (Affymetrix) and scanned at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Library 
prep and microarray hybridization of RNA extracted from skin biopsies from 3 healthy controls were 
performed together with the samples from the treated patients for a total of 31 samples. Gene expres-
sion analyses included calculation of ALADIN scores, differential expression analysis of the expression 
levels for the identification of gene expression signatures, principal component analysis, and statistical 
analysis of the ALADIN scores. Microarray data from the 31 samples have been deposited in GEO 
under accession number GSE80342.

Statistics overview
Statistical analysis of  clinical data. All variables were examined for distributional assumptions and checked 
for accuracy and for out of range values. Based on our a priori definition, we classified a patient as a 
responder if the patient experienced 50% or greater hair regrowth from baseline, based on the SALT score 
at end of treatment. We examined the overall distribution of demographic factors and looked at possible 
differences between responders and nonresponders, testing for significance using Fisher’s exact test (2 sid-
ed) for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. We then examined the 
change among baseline, end of treatment, and end of study scores for relevant variables overall and for 
responders and nonresponders employing either a Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
To estimate the extent of regrowth across time, we considered both a generalized estimating equation and 
a mixed model approach to model the repeated-measures data and opted for the latter, given the strong 
normality assumption of generalized estimating equations and our relatively small sample size. For these 
mixed models, we first modeled regrowth from baseline to end of treatment, where time (in weeks) was the 
independent variable, and then, to assess maintenance of the observed effect, modeled regrowth from end 
of treatment to end of study, where time again was the independent variable. In both models, we specified 
compound symmetry as the initial covariance structure. For all applicable measures, a P value of less than 
or equal to 0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analysis of gene expression data and ALADIN score
In order to examine possible differences among each of the CTL, IFN, and KRT ALADIN scores in 
responders compared with nonresponders, in responders compared with normal controls, and in nonre-
sponders compared with normal controls, we tested for differences among the 3 groups using a Krus-
kal-Wallis test, followed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as implemented in the coin package in R. We then 
examined the change between baseline and ALADIN scores at 12 weeks for responders using Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test, as implemented in the coin package in R. We further tested for differences in the 3 scores 
between responders at 12 weeks and normal controls.
ALADIN scores are defined such that mean CTL, IFN, and KRT scores are equal to 0, resulting 
in mean overall (all patients) scores, responder-only scores, and nonresponder-only scores, corresponding 
to the mean differences between these and the normal controls. Statistically significant differences were 
observed between overall scores at baseline and normal controls in CTL (P < 0.0002), IFN (P < 0.005), 
and KRT (P < 0.0002) scores; between responders-only scores at baseline and normal controls in CTL 
 
(P < 0.0004), IFN (P < 0.0004), and KRT (P < 0.0004); between overall scores at week 12 and normal con-
trols in CTL (P < 0.04) and IFN (P < 0.0004); and between responders-only and normal controls in KRT 
 
(P < 0.0007) at α = 0.05. No statistically significant difference was observed in IFN scores at baseline over-
all versus normal controls or in CTL and IFN responders-only scores at week 12 versus normal controls. 
No statistically significant differences were observed between nonresponders at baseline and normal con-
trols in any of the 3 groups of ALADIN scores.
Changes in ALADIN scores within individual patients were assessed between baseline and week 
12. Statistically significant differences were observed between baseline and week 12 overall in the CTL 
and IFN scores, with KRT scores reaching marginal significance (α = 0.05). CTL scores declined from 
8.30 to 1.51 (P < 0.004), IFN scores declined from 31.08 to –0.37 (P < 0.004), and KRT scores increased 
from –39.36 to –15.02 (P = 0.054) (Table 2). Among responders only, CTL scores declined from 9.37 
to 1.6 (P < 0.008), IFN scores declined from 38.37 to 0.24 (P < 0.008), and KRT scores increased from 
–37.84 to –15.42 (P = 0.039). Statistically significant differences were observed between responders and 
nonresponders in CTL and IFN scores at baseline (mean score difference = 5.91 and 40.11, P < 0.036 and 
0.036, respectively) but not in KRT scores (mean score difference = –19.74, P = 0.22).
